1k92i78,My take on where exactly Lewis is struggling against Leclerc,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k92i78/my_take_on_where_exactly_lewis_is_struggling/,2025-04-27, Technical,"Hey everyone, 
Made this carousel for my Instagram page so I thought I’d share it here too. The 8th slide is actually a video of Lewis having a small moment of Oversteer. I tried my best to reduce as many variables as possible while comparing Telemetry. I took the Q3 final laps specifically from every weekend cause that’s when the drivers are pushing the most.

He's arguably the only one so far who has consistently shown that he can hang around Verstappen in a somewhat equal car without getting bullied, as well as being one of the best qualifiers right now, maybe even all time. People always bring up France 2022 or Miami 2023 to call him a 'choker' or crash prone but he has progressed leaps and bounds since then. \n\nIt was always going to be difficult for Lewis to be even remotely close to him in Qualy, especially after he struggled so much last year, as well as having a new car and engine like OP mentioned. While Leclerc has been in this team since literally his second year in the sport. What is to be seen is whether Lewis can match him in race pace down the line. Regardless, good analysis OP!"", ""The style that Lewis dominated with involved using extremely hard braking to force the weight forward onto the front wheels. The backend would lift and become lighter which he then used to rotate it rapidly. His skill was in keeping the rear under control while it whipped around.\n\n\nThe ground effect cars only work with rock hard suspension to maintain an unchanging ride height. Which means he can't get it nose-down rear-up any more. He has never been able to adapt to this.

If I'm reading correctly the number one was assigned to the winning team since 1974 not necessarily the driver?

The newest regulations where a driver has a permanent number and the ability to use number one I believe went into effect in 2014 with Vettel. 

Individuals that I believe did not:
- ~~Damon Hill (moved from Williams)~~
- ~~Jacques Villeneuve (moved teams after winning)~~
- ~~Kimi Räikkönen? With Ferrari assigning the number to Filipe Massa instead~~
- Nico Rosberg (retired)
- Lewis Hamilton chose to stick with #44 *but used it with McLaren*
- *Mansell (retired)*
- *Rindt (killed)*
- *Hawthorn (killed)*

They have also removed the criteria that spoke on not forcing people off of the track. \n\nSo essentially, it\'s worse now if that rule that covers ""you move or we crash"" overtakes doesn\'t work as intended.

Sporting Director Helmut Marko laments: ""This car has great potential, but it\'s difficult to unlock.""\n\n> How difficult depends on the track layout and conditions. Fast corners like those in Melbourne, Suzuka, or Jeddah help. Medium-fast or slow corners, where you have to turn the car sharply, are poison. If the asphalt is rough, the tires overheat too quickly. If it\'s smooth and offers plenty of grip, that helps Red Bull. Heat is a through ball for McLaren. As it gets cooler, the window opens up for Red Bull. Therefore, Marko is demanding: ""We can no longer rely on such randomness.""\n\n> On tracks like Shanghai and Bahrain, even Verstappen had no chance. The car\'s fundamental problem slows him down. Wherever the front wheels are turned sharply or the car rolls along its longitudinal axis, the balance shifts between turn-in and the apex. The car slides, and the tires heat up. This then punishes the driver in the subsequent corners, even if their profile would be better suited to the Red Bull. Over a race distance, the problem is exacerbated.\n\n> **More downforce is not a panacea.**\nRed Bull\'s peculiarities are nothing new. ""We\'ve been struggling with them since the Imola race last year,"" recalls Marko. That was the moment when Red Bull had to react to McLaren\'s offensive, a moment when Ferrari and Mercedes also grew stronger.\n\n> The engineers responded by increasing downforce. But that\'s a double-edged sword with these ground-effect cars. More downforce often comes with side effects like instability or indifferent balance. Once you\'re caught in this vicious cycle, it\'s hard to get out.\n\n> In 2022 and 2023, Red Bull was largely spared these phenomena because the car was vastly superior. The aerodynamicists didn\'t even have to push the limits, allowing them to operate on safe ground. When they took it to the extreme for the first time with an underbody upgrade at the 2023 Spanish GP, Verstappen immediately noticed that the rear end became light when turning, and the car began to understeer toward the apex.\n\n> But it was still subtle enough that the champion was able to overshadow it with his class. The bottom line was that the lap time was faster. That\'s what counted. So the engineers cautiously continued to move in that direction. Until at some point, the pendulum swung, and even Verstappen found the handling annoying. Former driver Sergio Perez was already lost by then.\n\n> **The teammate\'s problem.**\nLiam Lawson discovered the same thing. The New Zealander found the car undrivable. As soon as he was back in the Toro Rosso, Lawson regained his old speed. In Jeddah, he had the pace of Isack Hadjar. Now Yuki Tsunoda has to contend with the Red Bull. It helps him that his driving style leans more towards Verstappen.\n\n> Nevertheless, it\'s noticeable that Tsunoda is closer to the world champion while the drivers and engineers are still in the discovery phase and everyone is complaining about the car. When Verstappen is finally satisfied with the car, the gap widens. In Jeddah, from four to nine tenths. This suggests that a car that suits Verstappen only very rarely benefits his teammate.\n\n> The four-time world champion has an extreme driving style. He wants a front axle that steers on command. He controls the rear with his reflexes or the accelerator pedal, as long as the tendency to oversteer remains within limits. With the level of downforce that has now been achieved, it may no longer be possible on certain tracks and under certain conditions to tune the car so that it remains stable with Verstappen\'s driving style.\n\n> Lando Norris is currently experiencing this phenomenon at McLaren. Although the new MCL39 is a better and faster race car than its predecessor, Norris complains that it no longer suits his driving style as well as the 2024 model. Norris is the closest to Verstappen\'s driving style. His problem is that McLaren will be hesitant to tailor the car to the Englishman. They have a driver in Oscar Piastri who is just as fast. So the engineers will always look for the happy medium.\n\n> Verstappen and Norris need a lot of downforce on the front axle to turn in. Transferring the downforce to the rear in fast corners would require the front wing to flex more under load than is possible or permitted. This could become an even bigger problem for some with the new rules starting with the Spanish GP.', 'Interesting. Makes me wonder just how much the change in Spain will change things.\n\nLike imagine we roll up and Ferrari are the fastest car.', 'RBR investing in cloud seeding bigtime.', 'Spain TD will be an interesting one…. However, I still think Merc is the most brittle one. If it Happens, WDC will be in Piastri’s pocket.', '""If we could just unlock it\'s potential""... if that wasn\'t said by Toto every weekend from \'22 through 24', 'Can’t say if Max really needs help since he’s doing better than other drivers who have tried the seat. I would think given all the issues at Red Bull, Max is pushing the car to its best potential. \n\nNow if Red Bull did get the car in a broader window it would be nice but as I understand it, it’s been the car’s characteristic for along time dating back to Gasly and Albon’s stints.\n\nHowever if anyone did help them figure out that narrow slot better it was likely Newey on the pitwall and race operations - he understood the car better and could guide the team to optimizing the setup. Now he’s not there, Red Bull finds it difficult to tame the bull they made.', 'Thanks for the translation.\xa0', 'Ditto the thanks for the translation.\n\nInteresting to read this last paragraph that both Max and Lando need a lot more downforce on the front wing. \n\nRemoving the ability to transfer downforce from the front to the rear in fast corners, that a flexi front wing (from Spain onwards) could mean we see yet more quali and race drama.', ""Thanks for the translation. But I don't get the title of the article ? What help for Max ..""]",107,57,0.78,107,56,56,10,1,0.010000000000000009,10
1k90odl,1986 — The Professor’s Lesson on How to Win an F1 Championship,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k90odl/1986_the_professors_lesson_on_how_to_win_an_f1/,2025-04-27, Throwback,,"[""After last weekend's qualifying session in Jeddah where McLaren made life more difficult for themselves than necessary in the fastest car and Verstappen snatched a surprise pole, I was immediately reminded of what the great Alain Prost did in 1986.\n\nThat season is in my opinion one of the few times in F1 history when we can say almost for certain that a driver in a car which wasn't the best (in really any aspect) won the championship.\n\nThat opinion does seem to have gained some traction in recent years, which I'm glad of. However I do still see a remarkable number of people espousing the view that Prost merely got lucky that Mansell had his blowout in Adelaide, or that Williams subsequently called Piquet into the pits for a precautionary stop at that same race. By going into the season race-by-race in this article, I hope to highlight that Prost's triumph was not merely the product of luck, but rather one of the greatest sustained campaigns in Formula 1 history, and perhaps even a template for today's drivers on how to clinch a title against the odds..."", 'Thanks so much for putting this up it was a great read. Just like many I didn’t know much about 86 bar the race in Adelaide.\xa0', ""Prost didn't get lucky. He drove a car that was the least expected to break and drove very consistently throughout the season."", 'I guess this is a good time as any to ask this: Am I crazy or was the French calling him the teacher? As in le professeur?', 'for those who are interested, there is a [fantastic 1986 season review](https://youtu.be/Ncl4kUXON7U?si=r5ViJtB6x0sXGDsW) narrated by clive james, and his quick wit make them really fun to watch. he also did reviews for the 84 and 82 seasons which should also be on youtube if you look hard enough', 'Fantastic read. 1986 is one of my favourite seasons. Hopefully F1TV will have all the races up one day.', ""It should be an easy calculation. The fastest car should win.\n\n\nBut the best driver isn't necessarily in the fastest car, and sometimes a better driver in a slower car can still win.\n\n\nAnd then you throw in *luck*, or rather *bad luck*, which can happen to anyone, regardless of their skill or equipment.\n\n\nAnd you got something fun to watch."", 'This article screams George Russell as a serious contender quietly & consistently finishing top 5 every races and ready to pounce whenever the front runners fucks up.', ""IMO, Prost is, in retrospective, the most underrated driver of all time. His style and approach is the one that everyone adopts now. He was always optimizing for race results, effectiveness over flashiness. He wasn't the most spectacular and not always the fastest on qualy, but he never took unnecessary risks and racked up the points more effectively than anyone else. His racing philosophy is the prevalent one now.""]",88,44,0.9,88,237,237,4,0,0.0,4
