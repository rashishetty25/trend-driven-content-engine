1lvuyy0,No situations for wet tyres.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvuyy0/no_situations_for_wet_tyres/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"I must say I find it pretty annoying that there seems to be an overlap between intermediate tyres and SC/VSC/🚩. At Silverstone it seemed like Race Control had a perfect opportunity to let the teams squabble with tyre choices, as the forecast said there would be around ten minutes of rain, and no more to follow.

The obvious quandary is about safety, and as Martin Brundle said on commentary, he agreed with the decision of the safety car, because the standing water started to endanger the cars of aquaplaning. Personally I think a VSC would be sufficient in that instance, if anything, particularly for letting Piastri keep his advantage.

I remember that less than a decade ago, half of the pack used wet and the other half intermediate tyres in conditions like that, and I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution. I'm also wondering what other people's thoughts and opinions are, hence this post.

I clearly don't want drivers in danger, but like we often say, they are professionals and we need to trust that they will take precaution too. I think I lean towards letting them drive and enjoying the peril as a spectator, not of damage or injury, but of race-changing incidents due to the challenging conditions.","[""> I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution\n\nIt is the aero design of this regulation. It wasn't as bad in the beginning when teams were figuring it out still and having to raise ride height, but they've all dialed in so much now that the cars all produce more spray. So the increased spray combined with conditions that would warrant wet tires mean that visibility is not good enough to race safely where it would have been in past years, plus I think the sport is just more safety-minded in general now. That's my understanding at least. Happy to hear if others think there are other factors."", 'What changed is that the current generation of cars generate so much spray that when the conditions are bad enough for wets, visibility is dangerously bad. No amount of trusting drivers to “take precautions” matters when they can’t see anything more than 20 yards in front of them.', ""I feel it's a very mixed situation. \n\nThe wet tires are to no use at this moment. The spray that they, in combination with this era of ground effect cars, cause limits visibility so much that you cannot safely drive, let alone race. So by the time the weather becomes bad enough, it's time for a Safety car or a Red flag even. The Dutch GP of 2023 showed that really well. \n\nAlso it doesn't help that the crossover between Inters and Wets is at that same point where racing just becomes impossible. So teams tend to just stick to Inters, because chance is more likely that race is gonna get neutralized at that point anyway. \n\nAnd the reason to get a Full Safety car over a VSC, wasn't to ruin Piastri's advantage. It was for the safety of all drivers. Remember that Bernd Mayländer has all the information on track conditions, if there is a really wet part of the track he can limit the pace of all cars and have them evade especially risky puddles. while the movement of the cars, especially in closer proximity of each other, works really well to dry the track out. That's why sometimes after a heavy rain before a race start, they have 2-3 or even 4 formation laps, just to dry the track out. \n\nBut we'll see, Pirelli said that the usability window for wets should be better. And i hope the design of the 2026 cars limit spray somewhat more so we can actually have racing in the wet."", 'As a related issue, do safety cars actually make wet situations less safe? \n\nBy bunching cars up and then releasing them with cold tyres in wet conditions aren’t you just increasing the likelihood of a crash. Wouldn’t it be better to try and keep some distance between cars when they are released, like the VSC?', 'They can’t use the full wet because the amount of spray generated by an amount of water necessitating the full wet + the spray generated by the floor is extreme and visibility goes to zero.', ""it's not just about aquaplaning, it's that they literally cant see because of the spray"", 'Forecast was rain in ten minutes, initially light then heavier before tailing off. Not ‘dry in ten minutes’ \n\nIn Brazil they originally let them squabble. It brought out the red flag as certain teams stuck certain drivers on inters for speed and those drivers couldn’t do it. We got a red flag.\n\nRed flags are what race control are trying to avoid. SC for a few laps avoided the a red flag.', 'Beside the spray issues, Pirelli has stated that the wet tyres are overwhelmed by water in really heavy rain, because they cannot get proper data on using these car in the wet due to the races being stopped in bad conditions.', 'but if the wet tires are generating a lot of spray (plus the rest of the car), why they bother to manufacture and bring them to the races?']",180,103,0.83,180,1063,1063,0,1,0.0,0

It's all the fluff around it that's bad."", 'Go W16 and just have the whole grid set a billion dollars on fire.', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Mohammed bin Sulayem is once again pushing for new engine regulations. A few months ago, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident wanted to bring the naturally aspirated V10 back into Formula 1. Now there\'s a new idea. Furthermore, a twelfth F1 team could emerge.**\n\n> It was one of the most controversial political issues of the current Formula 1 season: the engine regulations for the upcoming season. Next year, there will be new power units. The electric component will increase to almost 50 percent, while the rest of the power will continue to be generated by the conventional 1.6-liter V6 turbo.\n\n> Since the start of the season, several teams and engine manufacturers in the paddock have been pursuing a policy against the new rules. Ferrari and Red Bull in particular are leading the way. Both top teams are apparently concerned about falling behind Mercedes on the powertrain side. Ferrari team principal Frédéric Vasseur and his Red Bull counterpart Christian Horner have advocated for a V10 comeback.\n\n> Both the Frenchman and the Englishman walked through a door opened by the current FIA President, Mohammed bin Sulayem. In February of this year, he announced that the team would be using synthetic fuel starting in 2026 anyway. This would have addressed the sustainability aspect. A return to the loud, screeching V10 naturally aspirated engines, so popular with fans, would be an option.\n\n> Bin Sulayem likely hoped to increase his popularity in Europe with this move. His first term ends in December 2025. He is seeking re-election as FIA President. He doesn\'t have many fans on the Old Continent.\xa0Since the Silverstone weekend, he has had a rival candidate\xa0in the race for the position: Tim Mayer.\n\n> **Engine meeting in Bahrain fizzles out.**\nThe V10 issue escalated so quickly that an engine meeting was called for the fourth Bahrain Grand Prix in mid-April. Bin Sulayem, F1 boss Stefano Domenicali, and the power unit manufacturers were present, as were the power unit manufacturers, who presented their positions. Mercedes and newcomer Audi declared that they would have no engines for next year if the regulations were changed to naturally aspirated V10s at short notice. The proposal was rejected.\n\n> A few months later, Mohammed bin Sulayem is now upping the ante. He told the news agency Reuters: ""The current engines are so complicated and very expensive. The research and development costs reach $200 million (around €170 million), and the engine costs about $1.8 million to $2.1 million.""\n\n> The 63-year-old is therefore emphasizing the advantages of the simpler naturally aspirated engines. Unlike in Winter, however, he is now offering a naturally aspirated V8 as an option. According to the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident, this should be half the price of the current and future engines.\n\n> The new engine regulations are actually designed to run for five years. However, there\'s the possibility of shortening the interval. Naturally aspirated engines could return in 2029 at the earliest. ""We have to do it quickly. It takes three years, so hopefully we\'ll have something by 2029,"" Bin Sulayem insists.\n\n> **Will a twelfth team come from China?**\nIn addition to the engine issue, Mohammed bin Sulayem also commented on a possible twelfth racing team in the premier class. After Cadillac fought its way into the championship against the wishes of the established F1 teams and will enter the race with a Ferrari engine in 2026, another newcomer is expected to join, according to the former rally driver.\n\n> ""The time will come when we believe it is right to reopen a bidding round,"" said Bin Sulayem. The twelfth team should come from China, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident explained.\n\n> Would the existing racing teams welcome this? Hardly. The team\'s payout fee would be reduced because more parties would get a piece of the pie. This was already a major contentious issue in the Cadillac case. Only after the US Congress launched an investigation into Formula 1, because the Americans considered the reasoning for its rejection to be unlawful, was Cadillac granted entry into the premier class.', ""I don't see either a V8 or V10 happening any time soon.

At what point has the flow of time changed cars to the point that comparing drivers becomes foolish? For instance our original conversation started with the question: 
“can Jim Clark be called the goat of F1 when he drove a version of F1 cars that didn’t even have downforce”

But one could pose the question saying the same thing about Senna, because his car didn’t have the technology requiring the level of multitasking today’s drivers have to deal with.

So my full question boils down to, were Clark, Senna, Schumacher, and Hamilton even champions of the same sport? Why even compare them in the first place? Because realistically, with a few exceptions of maybe some of the similar era cars. Most of them wouldn’t be able to drive each other’s cars with the same degree of proficiency.
","[""Congratulations!

He later says for him Schumacher is his greatest of all time, narrowly ahead of Fangio, but stresses it’s just an opinion and of course that’s a perfectly fine opinion to have (backed up by a long career in F1 journalism). For me, the top tier is Fangio, Clark, Senna, Prost, Schumacher, Hamilton, Verstappen in no particular order. I do not know who I would pick if forced, it would probably change every time.', ""You're right, F1 is unique in that different eras are essentially completely different sports. Generally speaking, apart from tactics and the weight of the ball, football/soccer has been the same for decades. Senna wouldn't be as good as Hamilton in today's machinery, and Clark wouldn't have been as good as Senna in 80s machinery. They're all completely different skillsets."", ""It's totally pointless comparing drivers even in the same era who weren't teammates, and even then the driver who's superior in one car might not be in another with different characteristics. There are so many external factors and circumstances that it's really quite pointless to try and come up with any slightly objective ranking. The driver who was fastest at old Spa in the wet in a 60s deathtrap might not be the driver who is fastest at Miami in modern cars. Traction control vs no traction control. Power steering, sequential gears etc. Which combination of conditions, driver aids, tracks are you comparing across. It's nonsensical really.\n\nAnyway, Jim Clark's the best."", 'Welcome to the rational club!', ""Frankly it's impossible.  It's entirely possible that Senna would dominate today but because he never had to contend with the driving load of today's cars we simply will never know.   We can't just assume that because something didn't exist the old drivers are incapable of mastering it.   It's simply unknowable."", ""At literally every point that they're not dirivng the same car at the same time with a comparable setup and traffic.

Only people that are clueless in F1 do that.', ""I'm going to disagree with everyone and get downvoted to hell, but meh.\n\nYou absolutely can compare drivers from different eras. It doesn't matter that technology has advanced etc, what matters is how good they were in comparison to their peers, who have the same technology, physical conditioning etc. The same as in any sport.\n\nDrivers can only master what is in front of them. Schumacher squeezed every last bit of performance he could out of the cars he won his titles in. If he had been born 30 years later, does anyone think he wouldn't have mastered today's cars in exactly the same way? It was his drive and determination to win that made him great, and he would have applied that to whatever technology was available to him.\n\nGranted, you couldn't use a time machine to transport 1990s Schumacher into a 2025 car and expect him to win a title instantly, but if he had grown up alongside today's racers, he would likely be just as successful in this era as he was during his own.\n\n(Or not, depending on how you think he compares to Hamilton and Verstappen...)""]",48,101,0.74,48,91,91,1,1,0.0,1

Please keep in mind the table above only covers the actual runs up the Goodwood Hill, and there's much more to see around the event itself around the paddock, as well as several so called Balcony Moments - dedicated mini-celebrations for the legends of motorsports or entire automotive brands - with this year's FOS holding one for F1 veterans like **Alain Prost and Derek Bell** throughout the weekend.

For more info about the complete ""75 Years of Formula One"" celebration programme, you can visit the following link [here](https://www.goodwood.com/motorsport/festival-of-speed/explore/f1-75-celebrations/)

1lwb4kw,Qualifying Championship Results,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lwb4kw/qualifying_championship_results/,2025-07-10, Statistics,"I figured for fun I’d look at what the F1 standings would be based purely on qualifying results, using the same points system as the Grand Prix and Sprints.

Here’s how the standings would look so far this season, with comparison to their actual championship positions:

🥈 Max Verstappen – 212 pts ⬆️ 1

🥉 Lando Norris – 195 pts ⬇️ 1

4th. George Russell – 165 pts ⟶ (same)

5th. Charles Leclerc – 119 pts ⟶ (same)

6th. Lewis Hamilton – 90 pts ⟶ (same)

7th. Kimi Antonelli – 87 pts ⟶ (same)

8th. Carlos Sainz – 29 pts ⬆️ 7

9th. Fernando Alonso – 27 pts ⬆️ 5

10th. Isack Hadjar – 26 pts ⬆️ 1

11th. Alex Albon – 26 pts ⬇️ 3

12th. Pierre Gasly – 21 pts ⬆️ 1

13th. Yuki Tsunoda – 19 pts ⬆️ 4

14th. Liam Lawson – 10 pts ⬆️ 2

15th. Esteban Ocon – 6 pts ⬇️ 5

16th. Ollie Bearman – 5 pts ⬆️ 2

17th. Lance Stroll – 4 pts ⬇️ 5

Also, who decides on what angle to show?

So they cycle between which cameras are streamed. I believe this is mostly automatic, but can also be manually overridden', 'I think in this particular instance, there was a problem with the forward view and it kept cutting out, so the switched it.\n\nBut in general they often make quite unfortunate decisions with the onboard selection because they think its better for the world feed, although i often think it isnt actually a good choice. Especially the rearward T-cam is way overused', 'This likely also has to do with sponsors. Certain moments in race broadcasts can be predicted, like the winner crossing the finish line.
