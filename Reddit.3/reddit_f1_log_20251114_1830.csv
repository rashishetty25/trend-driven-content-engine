The statement ""I can't be completely honest, but everyone improved a lot"" would allude to such a suspicion.

These teams have a good chance of dodging FIA checks, since they're only carried out on the top 5 and 2 randomly selected cars.","[""What's he talking about?\n\n\nPer the article Sauber and Alpine cars were checked.\n\n\nOllie Bearman placed 4th in Mexico, so Haas has been checked recently.

That's not at all a good chance\xa0"", ""> These teams have a good chance of dodging FIA checks, since they're only carried out on the top 5 and 2 randomly selected cars.\n\nWhich would still be a big risk. One surprising points result or just the 2 out of 15 chance would hit you quite soon. It's likely the opposite: Aston is driving the cars too low in the sprints and having to return to higher ride heights in the races. \n\nPremium shit steerer is doing budget shit steering. Aston is just that bad in car development. They always repeat the same cycle, get outside Infos, being it illegally like 2020 or legal by 2023, have a burst in performance only to fall back to obscurity."", ""This doesn't make sense, the odds to be caught is still high given it's pure random if you getting checked or not, checks who are also done after qualifying. \n\nAM didn't perform like expected, others done a better job that weekend, end of story."", 'Least insane Alonso conspiracy. \n\nThe guy really does not help himself man.', 'The ""suspicion"" part seems entirely made up by the writer.', 'In Interlagos there was another shrimp Sprint weekend for Aston Martin. Similar to what happened in Austin, the AMR25 went from attending the top floors of the standings in the first two days to anonymous GP Brazil, where not even the risk of trying a different strategy paid off. Fernando Alonso finished fourteenth and Lance Stroll sixteenth, while the contemporary exploits of the other center teams, in particular Racing Bulls and Haas, have complicated the situation in the Constructors ranking.\n\nALONSO: ""I\'D PREFER TO FINISH 14TH TRYING THAN 12TH WITHOUT TRYING""\nAfter the fifth half in the Sprint Qualifying and sixth place in the short race, Alonso missed access to Q3 and, like Stroll, chose to start by mounting the hard tire: ""We didn\'t have the pace and we couldn\'t even adopt a one-stop strategy - explained the Spaniard - We wanted to see if we could get to lap 40, but at lap 25 the tires were worn out. They provided neither grip nor durability and we had to go back to the pits. We tried. I prefer to arrive 13th or 14th by trying something rather than get to 12th without trying anything"".\n\nAlonso (Aston Martin)\n\nDespite the difficulties, there is a small regret for the two-time iridated. In the final laps Alonso managed to hook up the long train opened by Liam Lawson who occupied the seventh position: ""He had a strong degradation of the tires, he slowed down the whole group and we almost made it. Another four or five laps would have been interesting"".\n\nTHE DOUBTS OF THE SPANIARD ABOUT RIVALS\nLooking at the trend of the weekend and drawing a final balance, Alonso concluded with a sibilline sentence: ""We have lost a bit of rhythm. I can\'t be completely honest, but everyone has improved a lot"". Considering the weekend with Sprint format, the suspicion is that the Spaniard refers to the management of the ground heights of the single-seaters. A well-known theme this year, in particular after the double disqualification of Ferrari in the Chinese GP for excessive skate consumption.\n\nObviously this aspect changes a lot in the preparation of the cars for the Sprint, where it is enough to ship about 35 kg of fuel, and for the Grand Prix, where instead this ""ballast"" rises to about 105 kg. The Aston Martin AMR25 is a single-seater very sensitive to differences from the ground, as evidenced by its swaying performance on weekends with the short race, while other cars are probably less so. The opposite could be said for example for Haas, since Oliver Bearman went from elimination in the SQ2 on Friday (and in 12th place in the Sprint) to literally flying in qualifying and in the Grand Prix, closed in sixth place. Alonso\'s likely suspicion is that some of the center-ranking teams are playing at ground height, at the cost of risking disqualification for excessive consumption of the skate.\n\n\n\nFor these teams, in fact, there is a good chance of not running into the controls by the FIA. By regulation, in fact, the skate is checked after the race in the first 5 of the standings plus two random cars among the other classified. In Interlagos, for example, the single-seaters of Lando Norris, Kimi Antonelli, Max Verstappen, George Russell, Oscar Piastri plus those of Nico Hulkenberg and Pierre Gasly were verified.\n\nAlonso\'s veiled allusion is on the possibility that some of the direct rivals in the race for sixth place among the Constructors took a risk that Aston Martin never wanted to consider. Lawrence Stroll\'s team is now seventh in the Constructors, overtoot by Racing Bulls precisely by the 10 points that the Faenza team got in the Brazilian GP. Not only that: Haas is just 2 points behind and Sauber is not to be considered excluded from this fight, with 10 points away from Aston Martin: ""We\'ll try, I think it will depend on Abu Dhabi - said Alonso about the fight for sixth place - We lost from 12 to 15 points in Monaco for the engine, in China for the brakes, in Monza with the suspensions damaged by a rock. So we\'ll probably miss a couple of those spots in Abu Dhabi.”\n\nKRACK: “A TIGHT FIGHT AWAITS US”\nSpeaking about Aston Martin\'s performance at Interlagos, team principal Mike Krack also highlighted the episode that compromised Lance Stroll\'s race: ""We knew it would not be easy and we did not have the pace to compete for the points zone. We tried to do things differently with the strategy, with long initial stints with Hard tires, but we lacked the rhythm to challenge the cars in front of us.

I took a look at their gap between each other in actual time interval (seconds), and then also took a look at the gap between them as a percentage of overall lap time, to adjust for the range of different circuits' lap times. 

Notes:

* I excluded the races where either driver had a crash in Q3 (Jeddah for Norris, Baku for Piastri). I considered using their Q2 times, but Norris had the faster time in Q2 in Jeddah, so it didn’t really feel like it would be representative of their actual performances that weekend. If you want to take a look at what it would look like with Jeddah and Baku, [I made an alt graph here](https://imgur.com/a/JGc4GMM). For that one, I used Norris' Q2 time in Jeddah against Piastri's Q3 time, and used both of their Q2 times for Baku
* For Austria, I used Norris' first Q3 lap for comparison since Piastri was unable to get a second lap due to the yellow flag. Their actual gap in that qualifying was over 0.5s. if you’re curious what the graph would look like [I made another alternate here](https://imgur.com/a/qZrsiOd).
* I made both grand prix only and sprint inclusive versions to get a full picture of the entire season, since I know sprints are not usually considered in qualifying head-to-head records but ultimately still do show a trend on how teammates compare in a qualifying context.

I think he therefore chose to slam the door incredibly aggressively, and did not care what happened.

I'm new to F1, and DtS is partly why I became interested, but I've since recognized the danger of this show. For me, the worst of it is the potential for historical revisionism.  
  
Archived broadcasts of races and articles of races will probably be harder for future audiences to access and they will instead rely on DtS to ""learn"" how certain races and seasons went. They will have vastly different perceptions from those who watched the races live, or who at least read about them soon after they occurred or watched highlight vids.  


Archived races become paywalled. Articles get paywalled or even simply deleted all too often. Highlight vids get claimed and/or deleted all too often. Blogs come and go.

I think DtS is more likely to remain, and if that's all that future audiences have to easily assess legacies of those racing now, then the fictionalized narratives and misleading emphasis on certain elements will become the revised historical narrative. The new audience will outnumber those who saw it happen without a DtS episode.

  
I like the idea of a cinematic docu-series that highlights the drama of the sport, but can't it be done without inventing straight up fiction?

When that does likely happen, it will be pretty historic that ends of run of dominance by Red Bull and Mercedes. 

Norris/Lando would break the F1 WDC record of longest conscience wins by the same two constructors. A Red Bull or Mercedes driver has won last the 14 WDC among Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, and Max Verstappen. It also inches McLaren closer to tying Ferrari’s F1 leading 15 WDC by a constructor. 

The next closest run was from 1984-1993 when McLaren and Williams won 10 straight WDC with Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, and Nigel Mansell

It will stop another record from being broken as Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton are tied for the longest WDC consecutive streak of the same 2 drivers at 7 years. This is tied with Juan Manuel Fangio and Alberto Ascari also winning 7 straight years from 1951-1957

Maybe it’s because McLaren has had the fastest car on the grid for about a season and a half now, but this will truly mark an end of dominate era of F1. Feels like it’s not as big of a deal, but it truly is. Redbull and Mercedes have dominated the hybrid era (and the final stages of the V8 era) with so many changes over the last 14 years including the cost cap, ground effect being reintroduced, the mandating of the halo cockpit, the ever increasing size of the F1 car, DRS system, banning in-race refueling, etc.  Jensen Button’s winning car from 2009 looks so different and operated in such a different environment from the McLaren that will be on display likely soon. 

Obviously there is a chance that this is just a blip and Red Bull and Mercedes nail the 2026 regulations and Max Vertstappen still does indeed exist. Does just go to show how remarkable Red Bull and Mercedes run is given all the changes and still staying dominant and even the streak Verstappen and Hamilton have been on.

It gave a wider perspective about Senna's career and personality, and what I like about the book is that it doesn't uncritically glorify Senna (although it has an obvious bias), but recognises his flaws and how his driving style affected his relationships with the paddock.

The thing is we can assume that, although being of course a legitimate contender, Senna's GOAT status has a huge impulse from his death, an event which elevated himself as F1's biggest legend. But, besides that, I've seen general consensus about if he had fullfilled his F1 career, he'd have ended with more WDC than Prost or even Fangio (the record-holder at the moment).

I beg to differ. Assuming he had survived San Marino, FW16's issues would've still been around. And he was fighting a young and hungry Michael Schumacher, who was cut from his same cloth in terms of driving. Senna losing both 94 and 95 WDC is plausible IMO, and being 35 with a new kid on the block...

By Richard Williams' account, Senna's girlfriend, Adriane Galisteu, said that Senna was thinking about ending his career in Ferrari, even if they hadn't a championship-winning car. So after the hypothetical 95 defeat, options are:

A) He stays in Williams, probably winning the WDC as Hill did.

B) He leaves for Ferrari (not likely as they signed Schumacher).

C) He leaves for Benetton and takes Schumi's seat, and at least fights for the WDC (a Senna-Hill-Schumacher battle, I guess)

Anyway, I find quite unlikely that he could have reached Fangio's 5 championships, but at the same time I think he was the Alonso-type guy who could have stayed forever in the paddock (I mean, Fernando is 44, the age Senna'd had have in... 2004!).

1owh294,Is Martin Brundle this generation's Murray Walker in terms of commentating a race?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1owh294/is_martin_brundle_this_generations_murray_walker/,2025-11-13, Discussion,"I remember the days of Murray Walker, the man is a legend in terms of F1 commentary. 

From the Senna & Prost collision to the Belgian 1998 GP start (appalling, worst ever)... His commentary was always  straight to the point and just human reactions, no personal bias, no patriotic bias for English drivers, just simply true commentary of the events unfolding in front of him.

In recent age of F1 commentary, I think the only person who even comes close to that is Martin Brundle. All the other commentators always seem to be biased towards UK drivers. 
Brundle (while at times his fanboying of Hamilton came out) tried his best to be neutral and actually acknowledge the talent and performance of every other driver.

Am I wrong about this? I'd love to discuss this. 

FYI, This post was inspired by Brundle's commentary on the 2012 European GP in Valencia. There was a moment in that race when Hamilton passed Schumacher and Brundle almost said ""Hamilton passing slower traffic"" but stopped himself and recognized that it was Schumacher, and then even commented how he had to stop himself mid-sentence because calling Schumacher ""slower traffic"" wasn't right.

Brundle didn't care which driver was from what country, he respected talent no matter where it came from.
","['My favorite comment from Brundle was when he was talking about the trophies. He mentioned the large trophy was for the winner, and the 2nd and 3rd place trophies are much smaller to make sure you know you lost.', '""His commentary was always straight to the point and just human reactions, no personal bias, no patriotic bias for English drivers, just simply true commentary of the events unfolding in front of him.""\n\nin oppositty land.\n\nMurray was highly emotional, highly British biased, and often called it wrong in the heat of the moment.  Hunt often had to chime in with a level head and correct him on things he got wrong.\n\nAs for Brundle, I don\'t know which commentator is which when they are calling at the moment.  At least with Murray I always knew.', 'Murray Walker’s legendary status stems not only from his abilities on comms but also from his exposure to the public through the BBC. Having F1 available to everyone on public free TV meant that his voice was spread far and wide on Sunday afternoons. He also did other motor racing such as BTCC. Jacques, Croft and Co are also excellent but it’s just not the same when they’re hidden behind a paywall.\xa0', ""Brundle and Walker complimented each other but are totally different.\n\nBrundle is respected as knowledgeable and a great reader of a race and fantastic at making complex situations understandable without dumping it down. It is a balance that very few commentators can manage.\n\nBut Murray was just raw passion and enthusiasm, you couldn't help but be excited when Murray was (and he usually was). I don't think we will ever get anyone quite like that again.\n\nDavide Valsechhi was the closest but he wasn't as likeable."", 'Wouldn’t go that far. \n\nIf you do mention late Murray Walker, should also mention James Hunt. They both complemented each other. The blunt and dry humour from James Hunt was unmatched. \n\nHe’s defo best from the worst (Sky F1 team barring Anthony Davidson). I would defo suggest you to give a listen to Alex Jacques (another Anglian citizen). He’s right up there', ""I'd say no simply because I think of him in the James Hunt, DC, colour commentary role, not the broadcast role. For me Ben Edwards was the Murray replacement."", 'You spelled Alex Jacques wrong.', 'James Allen and Brundle was peak for me', 'Im surprised there’s comments here other than “of course” !! I mean that in the nicest way.\n\nI began watching in 2008 so never got to hear Murray Walker live, in period. But for over a decade F1 and Brundle were one and the same for me. Over the years he was paired with different people (eg James Allen, whoever it was in the BBC years, and Crofty at Sky) but Brundle was a constant. Whenever I had to watch F1 without him it was like trying to mix oil and water. \n\nI learned the very basics of the sport while listening to him. I grew my passion for the sport while listening to him. I experienced all the highs and lows I went through as a fan while listening to him.\n\nSadly over the last few years I noticed his old age was starting to show a bit. It’s not about age but about how you age. But he’s just not the same on the microphone as he was last decade.\n\nSo I’ve hard switched to F1 TV for the last 3-4 seasons and couldn’t be happier (okay I do miss the BBC pre and post shows) but Brundle for me will forever be the voice of F1. A real legend.']",0,88,0.34,0,360,360,0,3,0.010000000000000009,0
