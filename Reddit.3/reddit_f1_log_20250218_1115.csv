2009: Jenson Button (5 wins)

2010: Tie between Vettel & Alonso (5 wins each, though Vettel is declared champion by having more 4th place finishes than Alonso)

2011: Sebastian Vettel (11 wins)

2012: Sebastian Vettel (5 wins)

2013: Sebastian Vettel (13 wins)

But the son of racing legend Michael Schumacher believes he can return.\n\nAll doors in the premier class have closed for Mick Schumacher (25). The son of racing legend Michael Schumacher will drive in the World Endurance Championship in 2025, with Alpine - but the dream of Formula 1 remains, as he emphasises in Bild am Sonntag.\n\n‘Formula 1 will always be a part of my life. I decided at the age of eleven that I wanted to drive there. That is still my goal, this racing series was and is my lifelong dream. I still have unfinished business with Formula 1 and want to prove myself there once again.’\n\n‘When I look at the current starting grid of the premier class, I have no doubt that I could keep up. I'm no worse. It would be nice if I could get another chance and prove that. Because I think a lot of people have labelled me wrong.’\n\nThe young Schumacher believes that a false impression has been created. ‘My reputation was determined more by negative public comments about me and not by what I can do well. I had the image of a crash driver.’\n\n***This was confirmed by accident pictures that showed the Haas racing car being smashed. Mick continues: ‘That's true, but what is not taken into account is that our car was designed for this. Due to the lack of fixed points, the design envisaged that it would split in the event of a side impact. Other cars would have survived that in one piece. I didn't communicate that at the time because I didn't want to provoke any more friction with the team.’***\n\n‘I was insecure and didn't put up a fight because I was shy. But at the end of the day, you need self-confidence and support in order to perform. I would put up more of a fight today. I've matured as a person and would no longer be so quick to say ‘it's all good’, but would stand my ground internally without compromise. I had to go through this maturing process to become who I am today.’\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", ""Based on what, exactly?
