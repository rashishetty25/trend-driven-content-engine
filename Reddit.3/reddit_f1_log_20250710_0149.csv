AutoModerator will no longer be granting Hulkenpodium flairs**

Welcome to Thread #5! The original thread had blown up so much, the admins asked us to kindly lock it and set up a new one as it was causing too much stress on Reddit's servers. We will set up a new thread every time the number of comments starts causing issues. So we're back with another thread for everyone who hasn't yet claimed their special flair. Original post below:

---

In the past days we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating Hulkenberg's podium.

So in order to properly commemorate this historic event we decided to create a limited edition flair, featuring a limited edition emoji made by u/Blanchimont.

This flair can only be claimed in the next 27 hours. So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance. If you change your flair back after the 27 hours you will not be able to recover the limited edition flair.

To claim this flair all you have to do is to send a comment under this post including the words ""Hulkenpodium"" or ""Hulkengoat"" (and pray that AutoModerator doesn't crash and burn)

Edit: It can take a bit of time for Automod to get to you, so please don't spam if it doesn't update immediately. Right now there seems to be a processing delay of \~4 minutes

Edit 2: To all of those suddenly requesting to be unbanned via modmail, please be patient. To all of those requesting to be unbanned via DMs... Please don't

**Sprints are not included.**

**Race Head-to-Head:** Only includes races where both drivers finished. If a driver completed enough of the race to be classified but retired due to a crash or mechanical issue, that is treated as a DNF.

**Qualifying Head-to-Head:** Only includes qualifying sessions in which both drivers set a valid qualifying time. If a driver didn‚Äôt participate in qualifying at all, didn‚Äôt set a time, or their time was dropped for a violation of the technical regulations, that weekend wasn‚Äôt included and is listed as a DNQ in the table.

**Qualifying Time Differential:** Uses the time from the last qualifying session in which both drivers participated. For example, if one driver made it to Q2 and the other was knocked out in Q1, the Q1 time is used for both.

**Use of Average (Mean) for Qualifying Gap to Teammate:** Because the chart for qualifying gaps uses an average, some drivers were helped or hurt by a single bad qualifying session. The two most extreme examples in each direction are:

* Oscar Piastri crashed during Q3 of the 2023 Canadian GP due to weather, which meant that his lap for that session was 3.303 seconds slower than Lando Norris. If that qualifying session was dropped, he would only be 0.174 slower than Norris instead of 0.434.
* ¬†Pierre Gasly‚Äôs teammate Brendon Hartley set a time that was 12.858 seconds slower during Q1 of the 2018 Azerbaijan GP.

I feel there are so many better ways to do it that don't involve slowing down significantly to allow the SC to 'escape' - possibly losing tyre temps and just causing general havoc.

Surely there are better ways to restart?

Option 1 - Send the SC into the pit a lap early - at which point, all vehicles are under a Virtual Safety Car. Paint a new line towards the end of the lap, at which point the VSC ends - and the front driver is now the SC and can restart at any point as they do now, with no overtaking until the SC line. They no longer need to completely slow down to allow the SC to 'escape' to a safe distance. Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap. (Maybe not VSC - maybe speed limited is the better wording)

Option 2 - Move the SC line further into the track rather than at the pit lane exit - meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap.

Probably many other ways to do it.","[""I think better communication would be enough. The problem at Silverstone was:\n\n* The call for the SC to come in was made late.\n* The teams didn't have any advanced knowledge the SC was going to be in that lap - the first the drivers knew was the lights going off.\n* Because they choose to bring the SC late they turned the lights off at a high speed part of the circuit, only Oscar could see the lights had gone out. Max didn't expect Oscar to slow to restart speeds (because he was unaware the SC was coming in).\n\nHad race control put the SC in notice out in the complex or - at worst- maggots and Becketts there would have been no issues. The SC would have had more time to escape, Oscar wouldn't have had to slow down to such a low speed to build a gap."", ""Option 1. The point of the VSC is that cars are to maintain the time gaps. This is obviously impossible at the end of the SC period when everyone is bunched together. The problem is track layout dependent. Any track with a substantial front straight tends to benefit the cars following the leader if the front car doesn't game the situation somewhat. You'd end up with the situation that many race leaders going into a SC lose their lead when SC ends and this is what the SC shouldn't really do.\n\nOption 2 is just confusing."", ""> Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap.\n\nIt may? Mate, SC gets called in once it's safe to bring it in. Once that's happened, it'll almost always be safe to restart as well. You'd be delaying things by a lap in almost all cases of this.\n\n> meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap. \n\nAlso, this frankly hasn't been a valid concern since they disallowed overtaking before the start finish line. Before that, you need to create a gap to ensure cars wouldn't be racing past a safety car that's still out on track. Nowadays, creating gaps and whatnot is purely done for gamesmanship.\n\nIf that bites someone in the ass, it's genuinely their own fault."", 'I like your options but I disagree that it solves the fundamental issue.\n\nThe problem is not that the SC has to ‚Äúescape‚Äù because they really don‚Äôt have to.

I believe this is the thing to solve. At the moment, the way to do this (consistently) is to slow down and start at your own pace.\n\nThe problem this race is a combination of 2 things: safety car coming in message late (meaning leader cannot anticipate the SC light going out), plus Oscar continue accelerating and then slow down so abruptly AFTER SC lights go out. He could have coasted or follow SC closely, but that will diminish the advantage he could gain at restart.\n\nTLDR: there is no rule demanding the leader to ‚Äúslow to restart speed‚Äù or let the SC escape.

He doesn't need such a big gap. Usually at Silverstone restarts were done into vale or even as late as the exit onto the straight, not before stow.\n\nBut an easy solution would be: don't allow high speeds before safety car line 1.\n\nPS: safety car lines have multiple purposes.

1lvuyy0,No situations for wet tyres.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvuyy0/no_situations_for_wet_tyres/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"I must say I find it pretty annoying that there seems to be an overlap between intermediate tyres and SC/VSC/üö©. At Silverstone it seemed like Race Control had a perfect opportunity to let the teams squabble with tyre choices, as the forecast said there would be around ten minutes of rain, and no more to follow.

The obvious quandary is about safety, and as Martin Brundle said on commentary, he agreed with the decision of the safety car, because the standing water started to endanger the cars of aquaplaning. Personally I think a VSC would be sufficient in that instance, if anything, particularly for letting Piastri keep his advantage.

I remember that less than a decade ago, half of the pack used wet and the other half intermediate tyres in conditions like that, and I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution. I'm also wondering what other people's thoughts and opinions are, hence this post.

I clearly don't want drivers in danger, but like we often say, they are professionals and we need to trust that they will take precaution too. I think I lean towards letting them drive and enjoying the peril as a spectator, not of damage or injury, but of race-changing incidents due to the challenging conditions.","['What changed is that the current generation of cars generate so much spray that when the conditions are bad enough for wets, visibility is dangerously bad. No amount of trusting drivers to ‚Äútake precautions‚Äù matters when they can‚Äôt see anything more than 20 yards in front of them.', ""> I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution\n\nIt is the aero design of this regulation. It wasn't as bad in the beginning when teams were figuring it out still and having to raise ride height, but they've all dialed in so much now that the cars all produce more spray. So the increased spray combined with conditions that would warrant wet tires mean that visibility is not good enough to race safely where it would have been in past years, plus I think the sport is just more safety-minded in general now. That's my understanding at least. Happy to hear if others think there are other factors."", 'They can‚Äôt use the full wet because the amount of spray generated by an amount of water necessitating the full wet + the spray generated by the floor is extreme and visibility goes to zero.', 'Forecast was rain in ten minutes, initially light then heavier before tailing off. Not ‚Äòdry in ten minutes‚Äô \n\nIn Brazil they originally let them squabble.

SC for a few laps avoided the a red flag.', ""I feel it's a very mixed situation. \n\nThe wet tires are to no use at this moment. The spray that they, in combination with this era of ground effect cars, cause limits visibility so much that you cannot safely drive, let alone race. So by the time the weather becomes bad enough, it's time for a Safety car or a Red flag even. The Dutch GP of 2023 showed that really well. \n\nAlso it doesn't help that the crossover between Inters and Wets is at that same point where racing just becomes impossible. So teams tend to just stick to Inters, because chance is more likely that race is gonna get neutralized at that point anyway. \n\nAnd the reason to get a Full Safety car over a VSC, wasn't to ruin Piastri's advantage. It was for the safety of all drivers. Remember that Bernd Mayl√§nder has all the information on track conditions, if there is a really wet part of the track he can limit the pace of all cars and have them evade especially risky puddles. while the movement of the cars, especially in closer proximity of each other, works really well to dry the track out. That's why sometimes after a heavy rain before a race start, they have 2-3 or even 4 formation laps, just to dry the track out. \n\nBut we'll see, Pirelli said that the usability window for wets should be better.

The fact that a Red Bull employee had complained internally about inappropriate behaviour on the part of the team boss also contributed to the team's disintegration.\n\n>Those responsible at the energy drink empire were probably also annoyed by the fact that Red Bull has the lowest popularity ratings according to recent fan surveys.\n\n>The decisive factor for the sacking is also said to have been that Horner had too many positions that he did not want to relinquish.\n\n>Horner's power was apparently also a thorn in the side of Max Verstappen and his team of advisors.\n\nsummary of all the alleged reasons given"", 'AMuS have been consistent in saying the Verstappen camp wanted Horner to go as a condition for staying. So to be consistent with their own reporting they now say Max will definitely stay. We‚Äôll see if this pans out, it likely will. \n\nBut I think they‚Äôre underestimating how team morale is going to plunge even further and another wave of departures are likely. Like it or not Horner seemed to have the support of the actual staff on the ground in Milton Keynes. Can‚Äôt imagine all this chaos is that enticing on the eve of a whole new ruleset.', 'is this article just an ai summary? absolutely no ""that\'s why"" here', ""This does give a few more reasons as to why Horner was let go. Some interesting ones for me:\n\n* Red Bull being one of the most unpopular teams according to fan surveys. (Meanwhile Racing Bulls doing quite well, having a more wholesome image). \n* Having amassed too much power over the years, taking on more roles within the team and not being willing to share power. (For example CEO of Red Bull Racing, Red Bull Powertrains and Red Bull advanced technologies. I wouldn't be surprised if all these roles will be split up in the future). \n* The failing second seat and the mess that was having to let go of Perez financially and still the new drivers not delivering. So he cost Red Bull a lot of money without it making any change in how the second seat performed."", 'in line with their pevious reporting:\n\n>But now Red Bull sports director Oliver Mintzlaff has apparently been able to convince the owners to make the change at the top. The current reason for this is said to also have been that Horner had amassed too much power, which he did not want to share.\n\n>This was apparently also a thorn in the side of Max Verstappen and his team of advisors. The four-time world champion has repeatedly flirted with a move to Mercedes recently. With the departure of Horner, the danger of losing Verstappen should at least be averted \\[edit: ""for the time being"" was later added to the article at that point\\].', ""My German isn't great, but isn't this article a nothing burger?"", 'None of these seem to be the actual issues TBH. \nThe real issue is that Marko faction have been looking for reasons to oust Horner ever since he showed interest to acquire an actual stake in the Red Bull Racing Pie. Something he missed out on doing 20 years ago and he remained a mere employee. Mateschitz protected him when he was around. Horner somehow survived the Horndog scandal with a bit of help from the Thai owners. But we knew that his days were numbered. Sooner of later they would have found some excuse to fire him anyway. \n\nShould have invested in the team when it started, just like Toto did.', 'Hear me out‚Ä¶ Cadillac.', 'F1 is a world-class sport. Loyalty over performance should only go so far. Red Bull are losing millions in the constructors race, and now Max, the sole reason for their success, is out of the drivers‚Äô championship, too. Regardless of the spectacular success of Horner in building this team, RB has fallen hard. Almost any team would replace him. Combining this with the half year of intense terrible press (innocent till proven guilty, but, um‚Ä¶) that still might not be over, it should not be seen as a shocking decision.']",0,171,0.33,0,1823,1823,0,2,0.010000000000000009,0
