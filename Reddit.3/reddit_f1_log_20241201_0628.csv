I want to believe that the FIA is just incomeptent but not malicious but they are making it really hard to think that.  

Everyone always gets an reprimand for this. Even Checo got one yesterday. 1 place grid penalty is practically unheard of. Half of the grid violating starting procedures and endagering marshals and Stroll did not give out penalty points/grid drops but this incident does?  

Even the document clearly says GR wasn't on push lap and he could see Verstappen and it's on him to overtake safely if he wants to start his lap ahead of him.  

People get noted for this all the time. As long as they had another car in front (which Verstappen did), this doesn't even go to reprimand. In Brazil, 17 cars were noted for driving slowly in prep laps, ffs.  

What sort of precedent is this? You can just taillight to the car in front and saying ""Crikey. That's dangerous"" and the driver who is just driving and prepping for his push lap is now gonna get penalised no matter what?

But the Qatar track has no character whatsoever, I've never been able to discern the layout as it all looks exactly the same. It is a sea of flat tarmac, floodlights, and high-speed corners going into medium-speed corners. No identifiable corners, no landmarks for reference. 

Miami, a fairly universally disliked track, has distinct parts and buildings like the stadium and intersection for reference, so you can tell where in the track the rivers are. Bahrain, a similarly situated track with a barrage of floodlights in the middle of a desert, has the large tower by the first corner and goes up & down a hill for some kind of reference point. China has the gigantic pit building great first corner complex and a thrilling final few corners. Abu Dhabi, known for it's lack of character, is fairly nicely split into thirds with the high speed first sector, double-straight, and 90¬∞ corners galore.

Obviously, Pulling and Pin would probably survive in a higher series or an open one in general, given that pulling does have some experience in British F4 and Pin even managed a podium in WEC which is quite impressive, but what about the rest of the grid? I'm assuming the ones with no points would probably also flounder in F4 regional, but do the top 5 or top 10 have a good shot at podiums in weaker f4 regionals, or even F3/F2 for drivers such as pulling and pin.

Furthermore, how do they stack up to actual F1/F2 drivers. Does someone like Bianca Bustamante actually have the skill to backup mocking actual f1 drivers like Lance Stroll, or would Lance Stroll in a wig lap every single f1 academy driver comfortably without breaking a sweat in equivalent machinery over a full grand prix length. Would a talented F3 rookie, like Piastri in his F3 years be able to smoke the girls even?

Senna became successful, whereas Sutton started working as the Sao-Paolo native\'s personal photographer for a short period of time when he was in the lower ranks of open wheel racing (between 1981 and 1984).\nSenna first met Sutton when he took some pictures of him in his junior Formula car. Impressed, he asked Sutton to join his team and the two began working together, resulting in many prominent personalities getting to know the Brazilian driver, thanks to the clicks.\nEventually, Senna would meet the right people who would help accelerate his F1 dream, which not only did he realize, but also conquered. By winning three World Championships, he became one of the best and most beloved drivers of all time.\nSutton\'s role in shaping his career won\'t be forgotten and his time with Senna will be immortalized in the upcoming Netflix miniseries about the late great legend.\nSutton took to his own Instagram account to share his feelings about their friendship before the premiere.
