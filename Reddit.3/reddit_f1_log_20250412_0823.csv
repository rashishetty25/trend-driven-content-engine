1jx49gq,"With the C6 compound debuting at Imola, should Pirelli revisit the 2018 tire naming and color convention?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jx49gq/with_the_c6_compound_debuting_at_imola_should/,2025-04-11, Discussion,"The C6 compound is making its race weekend debut at the 2025 Emilia-Romagna GP, marking the first time we‚Äôve seen all six dry compounds actually used in a single season. This has me wondering‚Äîshould Pirelli bring back the 2018-style naming and color convention to improve clarity?

Back in 2018, each compound had its own name and color (e.g., Hypersoft, Ultrasoft, Supersoft...), which made it easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps. Since 2019, Pirelli has simplified this into just ‚ÄúSoft,‚Äù ‚ÄúMedium,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHard‚Äù regardless of which actual compound is selected, but that‚Äôs led to some confusion‚Äîespecially when C2 is called ‚ÄúSoft‚Äù one weekend and C5 gets the same label another.

So with six compounds now in regular use, and possibly staying that way into 2026 and beyond, is it time to revisit or modernize the naming system? Maybe bring back unique names and colors‚Äîor at least tweak the current system to reduce ambiguity?

Curious to hear what others think‚Äîwould reintroducing distinct compound names make things clearer, or is the current format better for casual fans?","[""I liked the rainbow, but I understand why some people didn't. Always sounded cooler when they called it the hypersoft."", "">easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps.\n\nIf everyone's tires are the same 3 compounds in a race, does it really matter? Having a different compound be called soft on different tracks doesn't really seem to make much of a difference since you can't compare across tracks directly anyways"", 'No, because it\'s terrible for viewing. Right now when you are watching a race, and you see someone pitting and putting on the ""Soft"" tyre, you know that they have put on the softest available tyre and you know they are going for a short and quick stint.\n\n\nBut with the old naming system, where ""Super Soft"" wasn\'t even the softest tyre at some tracks, you would basically have to memorise which specific tyres are available for that weekend and so if someone puts on the ""Super Soft"" when the ""Hyper Soft"" is available, it is confusing. It makes the racing much harder to follow.\n\n\nHaving the softest available for that race be the Soft, Medium, and Hard, makes the racing so much easier to follow.', 'I liked the pirelli rainbow more than what we have now. but i understand the ease of understanding just Soft - Medium - Hard and using C1-C6 for the more hardcore technical fanbase. \n\nFor someone who has no clue about the details behind the tires. Knowing that Soft goes fast but not far, Hard goes far but less fast. And medium goes in between. Is simple. Instead of having to remember one week, why they are driving on Ultrasoft, supersoft and soft tires. And the next week all of a sudden superhard, hard and medium tires.   \nHaving the same colour scheme across every week also helps distinguishing between what the soft medium or hards are. Instead having to remember this week we have orange which is the hardest, blue which is the medium, and white which is the softest. just for it to be a week later be blue for the hardest, and another race having white as the hardest tire. \n\nAnd using C1-C6 just removes any confusion between it.', ""No, the current format is better in pretty much every way. There's no loss of information, the most relevant information to the vast majority of fans is clearly visible, yet the detail of which compounds are being used is readily available.\n\nThe old system just had unnecessary confusion"", ""Minor point, the C2 can't be called a soft. It can be a hard (C2-C3-C4) or a medium (C1-C2-C3).\n\n\nCurrent format is best. It‚Äôs clear, it's concise.\xa0"", 'The Pirelli rainbow range (or whatever you want to call it) was fine for the more hardcore audience who new what compounds were being brought each weekend, but I imagine it was confusing as hell if you didn‚Äôt know what they had - one weekend one colour might have been the softest but the next it was the hardest. Was just an unnecessary barrier to entry for a newer viewer and left them at the mercy of the commentators explaining it every time. Current system is perfect because at a glance you know what‚Äôs going on.', 'God no.  That was horrendous.', 'F1 fans seem to have this weird obsession with specific things from the past. I don\'t get it. The current naming and colouring scheme is objectively easier to understand and identify easily. For the super casual fans, they can pretty easily understand that a soft is fast but short lived, a hard is slow but long lived, and a medium is in between, and this is a blanket statement that applies to every single race.\n\nFor the more well-versed fans, ""hard...hypersoft"" is functionally identical to ""C1...C6"". Anyone who actually cares (like me) about which specific compounds are being brought to each specific race can and probably do easily look it up, it\'s not that hard and doesnt take away from or add to the enjoyment of the sport.\n\nKeep it simple on top for those who dont care and add layer of complexity a bit deeper for those who care.']",286,115,0.83,286,109,109,32,15,0.0,32

Just to see what it was like. I wonder if he could set it up like he does the Red Bull. If he could I genuinely think he‚Äôd be faster.\xa0\n\nIn Australia Yuki qualified one tenth off of Max. However many would say Max is expected to be more than one tenth quicker than Yuki so was that made up time the Racing Bulls faster car?\xa0\nIn qualifying in China Hadjar was two tenths off Max. Most people would say that in an equal car Max would be a lot more than two tenths ahead of Hadjar.\xa0\nAlso last season, for the six races Yuki and Liam were team mates Yuki was better but it was close. This year there is a chasm between them.\xa0\n\nOn top of that the general consensus Ive seen on here is that Lawson would probably perform better in the Racing Bulls car, but yet they still say Red Bull is faster.\xa0\n\nThis is because of the way the car is set up for Max‚Äôs driving style.\xa0\n\nI do feel this is a little misunderstood by fans because as far as I have gathered from what Albon said on the high performance podcast ‚Äúthe car is what it is.‚Äù It‚Äôs the set up that Max changes. The other driver can try and choose a different less fronty set up but they will be nowhere near Max. So they have to try a similar set up to Max if they want to be close to him. But this leads to crashes and no confidence in the car.\xa0\n\nSo take a fast driver that is not Max. Let‚Äôs\xa0\xa0say Leclerc. Put Leclerc in the Red Bull and then the Racing Bull, which does he perform better in? I actually think it would be the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nI think the only argument that Red Bull is that Max couldn‚Äôt set up another car like he sets up the Red Bull.\xa0\xa0Of course it is hard to figure out weather this is true or not as Max has spent practically his whole career in Red Bull. Personally I think that Max‚Äôs set up is a factor but perhaps not to the same degree that some people argue.\xa0\nI also think for example that Verstappen would have likely put more than two tenths on Hadjar in China qualifying if both were in Racing Bulls. Thus Max would have set a faster time in the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nThere is also the argument to consider that Verstappen could also make set up changes to suit him on the Racing Bull which would make it faster for him. \xa0\nSo overall I would say that in qualifying pace Max would set faster times were he in the Racing Bull. Race pace is harder to say because there is usually a bigger gap between Max and the Racing Bulls. In fact race pace has been Red Bull‚Äôs big strength since the new ground effect era began in 2022, although even this could be exacerbated by the fact that over Perez‚Äôs whole career he was always better in races than qualifying.\xa0\n\nEither way it would be so interesting to see Max go into that Racing Bulls (obviously extremely extremely unlikely to ever happen) and it would be very telling about the performance of the two cars and Max himself‚Äôs talents (Were he to jump into the Racing Bull and put a huge gap on Liam and Hadjar, people could no longer argue Max is only good because he sets up his car so his team mate can‚Äôt drive it.\xa0', 'How much of a mess have you got yourself into if the Green Saubers are faster than your own green team?']",103,43,0.93,103,277,277,2,1,0.0,2
