There is a lot of expectation that Hamilton is going to step into the Ferrari and immediately be the Hamilton of old, challenging for race wins and championships immediately. But it takes time to adapt to a new team. Ferrari has its own culture, its own procedures that it follows. There are relationships that need to be formed between Hamilton and the people that he's working with. And then even if Ferrari build a car that can challenge for race wins from the jump, Hamilton has been struggling with the 2022 generation of cars -- the working theory at the moment is that the regulations themselves just don't suit his driving style, and that it's not something that he can just drive around. Because if anybody can do that, it's Lewis Hamilton. Since he hasn't been able to do that, it's probably not something that can be done. And then there's the way he turns 40 in less than a week. Age catches up to all of us eventually. So I think expectations need to be tempered a little bit; last time he switched teams -- back in 2013 -- he only got a single race win and finished fourth overall. If Ferrari aren't careful, people who expect Hamilton to immediately start winning are probably going to be disappointed, and so the team will be under extra pressure to deliver, and that's when mistakes start creeping in."", 'MY BODY IS GETTING READY TO BE HURT AGAIN', '![gif](giphy|l0HlF6YoW9cOSfpXG|downsized)', 'You have to wait', 'Who said anything about guessing pecking order?

It's about Wolff's ego. He's desperate to find the next Verstappen, even moreso once it became once clear that Hamilton was leaving Mercedes. Sure, everyone raves about Antonelli's success in Formula 4 and Formula Regional, but look at the careers of everyone he was racing against -- most of them went on to achieve very little in Formula 3. I think there's a chance that Antonelli is a very good driver who appears better than he actually is because he was racing against drivers who weren't all that good to begin with. To me, the real problem here comes from the aftermath of free practice in Monza. Mercedes spent the week beforehand hyping up Antonelli -- there were even rumours that Toto Wolff would get on the radio at the end of FP1 and announce his signing live in the middle of the broadcast -- but when he crashed, it was obvious that they had no idea what to do next because it never crossed their mind that this could happen. A lot of Hamilton's late-season comments about the readiness of young drivers seemed to be designed for an audience of one: Kimi Antonelli. They really do sound like a warning about the intense scrutiny he's going to face this year. He might be quick on track, but he's seventeen years old. He has next to no media experience and he's probably pretty naive when it comes to things like public relations. If Antonelli doesn't perform, it could be disastrous for his career. I cannot think of a single driver who has had this much pressure and expectation piled upon them before the even got into the car. Not even Hamilton.\n\nI genuinely think that the best thing for Antonelli would be to spend another year in Formula 2 and make a serious bid for the title. Because on balance, I'm not convinced that he's ready."", 'Antonelli is fast but the question is more about his consistency at this level, there’s no use in being quick if you put the car in the wall every third race']",0,22,0.41,0,20,20,0,1,-0.020000000000000018,0

McLaren will be WCC.

Lando will narrowly beat Oscar.

Lewis will struggle early and resurge late.

Max finishes 3rd in the standings and further cement himself as one of the greats having amazing drives on a Red Bull that will be the 3rd or 4th best car in most tracks.

Lawson won’t have a great year and RBR will be 4th in the constructors.

Mercedes will improve, but not enough to challenge for a title. 

George will have a great year, will win more than 2 races.

Kimi will be slower overall but show great glimpses.

Gasly will have a career year.

Jack doohan will be replaced by Paul Aron sometime after the summer break.

Despite that, Alpine will be 5th.

Aston will fight tooth and nail for the 6th place with Haas and VCARB.

Alonso will have some heroic drives as usual.

Lance will have his worst year yet, further demotivated on a bad car.

Ocon is going to have a good season.

Bearman will be inconsistent, but pretty good most of the time.

Yuki will be amazing and completely wipe the floor with Hadjar, despite it, VCARB will finish 8th.

Carlos will comfortably beat Alex and get a contract with RBR for 26.

Sauber will improve, but not a lot. Hulk will beat Bortoleto who’s going to have a few great drives.

Cadillac will announce an all-american lineup with Herta and Jak Crawford.","[""Generally think all of these are possible, except for Lando *narrowly* beating Oscar.

Hamilton won't have anything like the same qualifying issues relative to Leclerc that he had against Russell after signing for Ferrari last season. He will have the same level of competitiveness in qualifying against Leclerc that he had against Russell in 2022 and 2023, before he decided to join a rival team. That's my prediction."", 'Bold to call WDC when we’ve not even had testing…', 'These are some rather tame predictions not crazy at all.', ""Lol why's everyone underrating doohan"", ""I'll throw in some. Next year will be a Leclerc vs Norris title fight with Hamilton struggling early on to adapt to the Ferrari leading to him playing the supporting act for Charles in the second half of the season, while Oscar plateaus in his development as a driver leading him to drop out of the title race too, adding on to this Mclaren will win the constructors championship. Red Bull will have a fast but inconsistent car that doesn't allow Verstappen to challenge for the drivers, while Red Bull will never be higher than 3rd place in the constructor's championship all season long. Antonelli will get either a pole position or win in his first season. Bortoleto will beat Hulkenburg in Race Head-to-Head but will fail to outscore him. Doohan will be demolished by Gasly, while Ocon and Bearman are one of the closest pairings on the grid with Haas beating out Aston Martin and Alpine for 5th.""]",0,16,0.35,0,14,14,0,3,-0.050000000000000044,0
1hrh64v,Senna being disqualified or Hamilton in 2021?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hrh64v/senna_being_disqualified_or_hamilton_in_2021/,2025-01-02, Discussion,"Just finished watching Senna on Netflix, it covers historical events that helped me view F1 in a new light. The 80s they seem to have been full of controversy. Aside from that comparing 

1) Senna and the issues from the jump start, potential forced accident and disqualification from the race that should have won another world championship. 

2) Hamilton's 2021 in review and the last laps of the final race.

Which is more controversial? 

Which has a larger impact on their legacies? 

What could have been?","['Senna being disqualified didn’t cost him the championship.
