There is no point of moving up to shifters once you learned everything from TAG racing. Such as\n\n• being smooth with the steering wheel  •braking late as possible and getting on throttle as early as possible  \n•keeping minimum speed thru corner apex as high as possible. This is learned in younger categories because those karts have way less power. \n•general race-craft\n•developing confidence\n•driving in different weather and track conditions \n\nOnce you learn everything from TAG racing you might as well move into cars because you would want to continue your professional racing career. Another factor is racing drivers are getting younger and younger every year, Why stay racing shifters for an extra year when your competitors are moving into cars. Another reason is money, shifters are more costly than regular karts if that is a problem.', 'Karting techniques aren’t 1:1 to racing cars, it’s the starting point for drivers because it’s the only racing you can do from a young age. \n\nBut other than the high level grip circle, reaction time, and wheel to wheel racing experience the actual driving technique is not the same in karts as it is in cars. \n\nSo it makes more sense to go to cars as soon as able then doing more karting.', 'There are multiple reasons:\n\n1st is the fact that a lot drivers are british and in England KZ isn’t considered the most prestigious class, senior classes are much more highly viewed\n\n2nd is that Kz2 is much better for young drivers, Kz1 allows teams to come with non-homologation equipment, as a junior driver it’s basically impossible to land yourself in a position where you have access to that. There are a lot of drivers running kz2 that will be and are already in F1 (Nyck de Vries, Kimi Antonelli (he did Kz for the world championship), Logan Sargeant, Carlos Sainz, Pierre Gasly etc.) \n\n3rd It’s an insane learning curve, most of the things you learn from ok/okj/mini get thrown out the window, you sort of need to re-learn karting\n\n4th  is that winning the world karting championship is no easy feat, in kz/kz2  you are battling guys that have been at it for over 10 years, every weekend driving the same tracks and same kart.

Do you think lewis will win 8th championship? given the fact that he's 40 years old and he was 7th in 2024.

What do you think guys?

  
I think there's still a chance he will win 8th championship since Ferrari car is better than Mercedes's. If we compare to Max Verstappen, Lewis doesn't have a good chance.","['I don’t understand the point of such low effort posts!', 'No. Leclerc is more likely to win. Hamilton is past it (still a great driver and will absolutely win a few races)', 'Let me check my crystal ball brb', ""I honestly think he could, if Hamilton is motivated and meshes with Ferrari quickly, and has the car to do it, it's definitely not impossible for him to beat Leclerc over a season.\n\nBut it would probably be one of his toughest teammate battles ever.\n\nConsidering he isn't in his prime, and Leclerc is, it would be much more like a Nico win in 2016.\n\nBut this last season I don't think is anything to compare his current ability to, he almost came in P2 in the 2023 driver's championship while George came in P8, and RedBull had a rocketship then.\n\nThat Mercedes has been a dog since 2022, McLaren obliterated them in the constructors with the same engine, that means Mercedes doesn't have a clue how to build a car with the current regulations, whereas Ferrari has built a solid car each season of these regs.\n\n2026 is so different it's genuinely impossible to know what team will be at the front, so no point guessing about that yet.\n\nBut Leclerc is very talented, other than Alonso, he'll be the best teammate Lewis will have ever gone up against in the same car, making this one of his most difficult achievements if he were to pull it off."", ""I don't think he will. He's really struggling with the 2022 generation of cars, and it's not a problem that Ferrari can engineer out of it (whatever *The Race* might try to tell you). It's going to take time for him to adjust to working with Ferrari -- there are new people and processes involved and relationships to build -- so I think the idea that he'll step into the Ferrari and instantly return to the Hamilton of old is a bit of magical thinking. That's not to say that he doesn't have the talent to win and eighth title; I just think there's an ever-diminishing window of time in which he can do it. I honestly doubt he'll renew his contract with Ferrari once it's up; he'll be 42 in 2027. Age will eventually catch up him, as it does to us all."", 'Unlikely. I give it a 20% chance for next year.\n\nAnd maybe 40% in 2026 as the regs reset.

However, I could be wrong.\n\nYou also can't assume 2025 car quality before we even see the car. I do think Ferrari will be better than Mercedes, but we don't know that."", ""I'd like to see it. But, my pre season prediction is Charles winning it in 2025"", 'Lewis was in DGAF mode for the entire year in a team he knew he was leaving and with a car that was 4th best at its peak  and 5th in a lot of races. Lewis got washed in qualifying and in most races.
