This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

I must\'ve listened to about 5 bring back v10s ""your questions answered"" podcasts, and it\'s clear that they have a very high impression of him.\n\n[Here\'s the most recent example I just finished listening to - go to 24:30](https://youtu.be/D9qvO2Zuqmk?si=J2ve3zYcJLBpz8NI)\n\nMark Hughes: (paraphrasing) ""There\'s only two drivers who were head and shoulders above the others in the 1990s\xa0 and those were Hakkinen and Schumacher. The others were quite evenly matched. Irvine, Frentzen, Coulthard, Barrichello, Villeneuve, Fisichella were all evenly matched""\n\nI find this comment pretty bizarre because (among other things) it implies that Hakkinen was in the same league as Schumacher, but even weirder, a respected formula 1 journalist is saying something that is highly debatable and is just casually passing it off as an accepted fact. I get when people say Schumacher was the best of his generation and pass it off as a fact of conversation - he has the results to back that up, but there\'s zero basis to shoehorning Hakkinen there with him.\n\nWhy is Hakkinen rated so highly? Especially if you agree with Mark Hughes, I\'d like to understand why. I\'ve watched all of Hakkinen\'s races, analyzed all of his results, and I just don\'t understand it.', ""Michael Schumacher was racing the last time I watched F1. My favorite driver was Eddie Irvine. That's where my knowledge of F1 is at. \n\nI'm looking to at the very least follow the race results and pick up some general news (mostly from here) for this season. \n\nAre there any apps, (other) subs, or websites I should be using to help me keep track of things, or am I good just checking in here daily? \n\nMy intention is to absorb quite a bit this year and then make an informed decision on if I wanna watch F1 in a more serious manner again."", ""I am so hype for the annual Scarbs cars breakdown. It's when I let myself do this:\n\n![gif](giphy|KxhIhXaAmjOVy)"", ""Now that we're into the launch season proper, am I the only one who finds the car unveilings to be underwhelming? I think that's my issue with the F1 75 Live event -- it kind of took the wind out of the sails for the 2025 cars. This time last year, I was eagerly checking my calendar and refreshing the page, waiting for the next car to be revealed. This year Aston Martin released photos of the AMR25 and I barely even noticed it. It wasn't even headline news on sites like *Autosport*."", 'https://preview.redd.it/6xer2x1z23le1.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&s=85cdc75ae59f43e5c4da45ce58e8e180ebaa1017\n\nThoughts....on trademark infringements? I thought it was funny that the seller changed the Sparco logo but basically nothing else.', 'Uh... what happened to the sidebar? It used to have the countdown and dates between each race and a bunch of other links like F1calendar. Am I tripping or is all of that gone now?', 'Do all the cars use the same fuel or is it car specific?', 'Do drivers get to pick their own helmet designs and if so what are some drivers common things to go about it?', 'What do you all consider the start of the season? Is there an official start to the season?

1ix1lcv,Carlos Sainz’s ‘two top drivers’ dig after Red Bull snub,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ix1lcv/carlos_sainzs_two_top_drivers_dig_after_red_bull/,2025-02-24, News,,"[""Ahh we're back with the clickbait titles.\nHe didn't say this randomly and was referring to Williams and their line up when talking about this and what he would do if he was the team principal."", "">“Lando and I, Charles and I or Alex and I – two top drivers,” Sainz told\xa0\n\nLando and Charles yes. Alex? We'll see about that."", ""When Sainz left they had Verstappen paired with Ricciardo, I think it's fair to say those where two top drivers, probably more so than Verstappen + Sainz would be.\n\nAfter that they promoted from within, with little success.\n\nAfter that, they signed a top mid-field driver, who was at the time comfortably the strongest driver not already locked in with a team. Nobody really forsaw the total collapse he had.\n\nI don't think you can say Red Bull actively avoided having a strong driver next to Verstappen, they've not really had better options. Except maybe Sainz this year, but then is there really much reason to assume he'd do better than Perez? They tried getting a respected experienced driver from the outside and it didn't work out at all, why try the same thing again instead of promoting from within like they used to do?"", ""What Sainz is conveniently not thinking of is that you get someone like Verstappen or MSC once in a lifetime in your team. So it's best to do build everything around them. But no active driver would want to acknowledge this."", 'His statement will look a little bit weird in hindsight if Lawson is closer to Verstappen than Albon was.', 'I mean,  Marko (I know that old wind bag is full of shit) said about driver #2.  \n\n“He should become a consistent points scorer and help Max when he needs to, not try to,” he told”\n\nThat’s why they didn’t sign Carlos.  He is not that.', 'If Albon is deemed to be a top driver like Sainz claims, surely Lawson would be in the same category as a top driver?', ""Basically as we observed last year: because if you won't win the WCC, you could well win the WDC.\n\nMarko himself observed similar a while ago, that if the top 4 teams are very close in 2025, then being clear #1 is a massive advantage for Verstappen."", ""RBR wants to keep Max happy so he doesn't leave.  And the way to do that is to continue to give him weak 2nd drivers.  To be mentioned among the all-time greats one needs to have very good 2nd teammates to challenge them -- to really show the world how great they are.  Otherwise, it will always be: It was the car.  In this case: it was always Newey.""]",0,103,0.47,0,590,590,0,0,0.0,0
