It’s a bit more pressure now, because before we basically walked it up to the goal line and just needed to tap it in. Now we need to reset and perform. Likewise, the others now get this kind of extra chance, with almost nothing to lose. But the right attitude is to view it that’s nothing has changed.

I disagree slightly because controversy over stewarding decisions hasn\'t always been THIS bad. There have been periods in F1 where the stewards were able to quickly come to the correct decision without any problem. Of course it won\'t always be perfect.\n\nCharles also says that they need to introduce more common sense in to the stewarding process and less black and white guidelines because it is impossible for the guidelines to cover every single scenario and incident.

The guidelines are written very rigidly, and I put zero blame on the stewards making their decisions based on what the guidelines outright say.\n\nI cannot imagine it\'s possible to rigidly outline rules for every racing scenario - I think there needs to be some vagueness for something as fluid as w2w racing.', 'The problem with the stewarding is that they are having far too much impact on race outcomes for such subjective decisions (and I’m specifically talking about contact/passes not rules like moving before the start). Stewarding and reffing should not be so visibly fucking with the sport. I’d rather see no rules and let the drivers self-enforce like nascar does than have what we have now. I think Sainz’s idea makes sense - I’d like to see one season of a PAID group of former professional drivers or expert race analysts doing the stewarding for crashes.\n\nRegular Track limits, start/stop procedures etc can be done by volunteers but not these highly impactful subjective decisions about contact/passes.', 'I don’t mean to be controversial or a contrarian but can someone give me a good reason why the current rules don’t work? I understand that it discourages pass attempts like what Piastri attempted but in my opinion it enforces the driver to be better at judging and making the move. \n\nMax nearly always makes that same pass within the rules and whether you like it or not, it’s the rule. But when Piastri does it, causes a crash, and by the guidelines doesn’t meet the criteria for a safe pass everyone wants to blame the driver that closed the door. \n\nI guess my point is, the current rules are strong enough to make the drivers have to be certain on their judgement and not just wing it. While the alternative is far more risk for both drivers and allows more subjective judging to determine if it’s just “racing” or a penalty', ""The only problem with this is ... when a decision is controversial (and there's bound to be some) then there's nothing to fall back on.\xa0"", '\\>There have been periods in F1 where the stewards were able to quickly come to the correct decision without any problem.\n\n\\>Something myself and I\'m sure others have been saying for several years now.\n\nI don\'t want to sound harsh, but i\'ve read this take on litterally every sport i\'ve been a fan of.

What\'s common sense to one steward, isn\'t to another.\n\nIf they\'re gonna rely more on steward ""gut feeling"" rather than guidelines, then the first step is a paid stewards team, so we can (mostly) have the same stewards at every race.\n\nAnything beyond that will just swing the pendulum too far in the other direction.', ""To be fair the stewards don't really have big time constraints either.\n\nIt's not like in rugby where you have to make a decision on foul play within a minute or so. In F1 you can take up to 10minutes or so and they often do.

1. Lando Norris 390
2. Oscar Piastri 366
3. Max Verstappen 366

Breakdown: 

Lando needs to piece together 35 points out of a possible 58 available. Why? Because if Max or Oscar takes all 58 that would give them both a possible 424 total points. By taking all 58 I mean they win the Sprint of Qatar, the Grand Prix and then Abu Dhabi. So if you’re rooting for Lando he just needs 35 points which would give him 425. If you want Oscar or Max to win you hope Lando can’t scrounge out 35 points and scoop as many points as you can. ","['Thanks!

George Russell and others seem to ignore the fact, these people love it and get an experience many would PAY $1000s for?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p8jk9x/i_dont_get_the_anger_at_f1_and_fia_for_volunteer/,2025-11-28, Discussion,"i dont see it as abuse, i see it as symbiotic. 

 people love it and would actually PAY f1 to do it. Do they even talk to the people? of just think ""what billion dollar f1 isnt paying them???"" also alot of people in all these countries would never be able to get a ticket or get this close to the action. as it would be like 4 months pay or more

i do 100% think better training, better communication. or having  a mix of a few who are paid for the highest risk moments and to make sure the non paid people are being safe is a good thing. they can do more. but lets not just kill it becasue its not perfect

plus its part of the history. is f1 using them? Yeah kinda, but maybe, but just speak to these people and ask them. also if you pay them it changes everything.  no way would the same people get these gigs.

to be honest it seems a bit ivory tower like of George Russell telling f1 to kill something thats really important to alot of people and supports local racing club etc.
