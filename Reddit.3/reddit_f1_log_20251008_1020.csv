1o0b3o8,"Ferrari, chaos, tensions, excuses, behind the scenes: Leclerc is already looking elsewhere",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o0b3o8/ferrari_chaos_tensions_excuses_behind_the_scenes/,2025-10-07, News,,"['""already""? Poor man has endured it for many years too long.\xa0', 'If Ferrari screw up the regulations next year then 2026 has to be Charles Leclerc’s last year in that team. \n\nIt would be idiotic otherwise to stick with the team if they aren’t top of the pack or at least a close second. \n\nHe’s a phenomenal driver and at prime racing age. He needs to maximise that by driving for a team that will deliver him both the car and strategy good enough to win a championship. \n\nIf it comes down to it then its better to be champion in Mclaren Papaya or Mercedes Black than to never be champion at all in Ferrari Red.', '""already""... If true, he fucking earned and paid for that right', 'Looks like the Stockholm syndrome is finally clearing up. Good for him!', 'Max and Charles at Red Bull', ""Silly season '26 will be GOATed"", ""I've never wanted someone to win a title so bad in my lifetime. \n\nLeclerc in a Ferrari winnnig a title is a dream but really it's only a dream. \n\nI will follow him where ever he goes. Guy just seems like the best combination of all personalities"", 'Already?! Bro has been loving that pain and suffering for years now. He should’ve left a couple years ago.', ""Ferrari and the people who work there are the problem, I feel like their ego is the reason for the brand's failure, they probably think too highly of the logo and won't listen to drivers"", ""Translation with DeepL\n\n>**MODENA** - *A dense cold has descended on the Ferrari people, like a long, slow eclipse with no apparent end in sight. They will come out of it sooner or later, but when? And above all, how?*\n\n>*Things were better when they were worse, my dear lady, when there was someone who kept saying: we must understand. Because the approach to the problem, or problems, was straightforward: identification, understanding, correction.*\n\n>*Today, problems are not discovered one by one: they come thick and fast. And the trend is exactly the opposite of a year ago: the development of the car has not been a strong point for Maranello, but the exposed root that has repeatedly tripped them up. The fruit of the work of hyper-specialist Loic Serra has not been forthcoming.*\n\n>**Ferrari, a sharp decline in performance**\n\n>*As the season progressed, first with the rule against front wing flexing (which Mercedes managed to get around very well, as we saw in Singapore) and then with the rear suspension of the SF-25 revised after months of work, the performance of the Reds deteriorated. The curve has taken a nosedive - a sad coincidence - since Fred Vasseur's contract was extended for another three years: that was on 31 July, and since then there have been five races, whose separate rankings speak for themselves. Ferrari, with only 50 points (10 per GP), olapped by McLaren (134), Mercedes (105) and almost by Red Bull (98), has not performed much better than Williams, Aston Martin and Racing Bulls.*\n\n>**Ferrari, the latest headache**\n\n>*Overheating brakes and constant recommendations to drivers to slow down to cool them down were just the latest technical headache for a car that lacks aerodynamic downforce and has to drive low to the ground to go fast, but not too low, otherwise it ends up disqualified, as in China. What is disturbing is the perception of a team in which nothing works anymore: Leclerc points the finger at the car, Hamilton at the team (division of departments, procedures, working protocols). The engineers are struggling, and Vasseur has reached his sixth month of excuses: among the usual references to “good race pace”, “untapped potential” and “failure to execute”, on Sunday he said that “Lewis was fantastic but pushed so hard that he overheated the brakes”. In short, Ferrari's bug seems to be an excess of perfection, already mentioned after the double disqualification in Shanghai.*\n\n>**Tense atmosphere in Maranello, tensions in the pits**\n\n>*All this further ruins the atmosphere within the team, with new tensions emerging. On Saturday after qualifying, the tone between Vasseur and a senior technician became heated in a very tense discussion: sources in Maranello suggest that the other party was Matteo Togninalli, the highly capable head of track engineering.*\n\n>*Among the technicians themselves, there are those who are angry with Leclerc for his uncompromising criticism of the car and how it is managed. Charles was blunt on Sunday night: ‘Mercedes has made great strides forward, as Red Bull did a few races ago, but we haven't. It's difficult in these conditions to be optimistic and think that the situation can change in the last few GPs.’*\n\n>**Ferrari, the new technical cycle**\n\n>Now, his entourage is hinting at a desire to shift the focus of major decisions from the heart to the head: the new technical cycle that is coming cannot be wasted, so talks are underway with several teams with a view to 2027, as the driver cannot compromise his entire career for the sake of the Scuderia. The choices will only mature in 2026, and this applies to all drivers, who want to see the validity of the new projects before deciding on the direction of their future. The possible market variations today form a dense network, at the centre of which are Mercedes - said to have a big advantage in the design of the new engine - and its customer McLaren. \n\n>The frightening thing is that, amid all this technical confusion, in Maranello, this group with these ideas, in this gloomy and tense climate, with this team principal, is designing the car that will decide the fate of Ferrari for the next five years.""]",3123,563,0.97,3123,17242,17242,23,2,0.0,23

This video gives a really cool sense of the logistics and communications that happen during a GP just to keep the camera angles flowing.

Seeing this behind the scenes gives some cool perspective, though. You *really* can't just have some joe blow who knows wheel come in and do a good job with it - even to make poor decisions effectively, the director needs a level of experience in doing this specific task. 

And, it also begs a question for me. Considering all of the folks working in this room whose jobs are to execute this director's orderes for hours during the sessions' broadcasts, I wonder if there are any debriefs where those folks are asking ""hey, we missed a bunch of overtakes in the last 10 laps, how do we incorporate them in the the future"" or what's going on behind the scenes and between weekends.
