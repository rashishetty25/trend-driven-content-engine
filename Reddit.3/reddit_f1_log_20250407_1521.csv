1jsy8oq,[AMuS] McLaren curses the asphalt,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jsy8oq/amus_mclaren_curses_the_asphalt/,2025-04-06, News,,"['Cursing? $1,500 fine coming Macca’s way', '>At first glance, it would have made more sense to favor Norris in the fight for victory. But McLaren had to defend against George Russell in the Mercedes.  \n  \nMcLaren also believes in the George WDC run. 🙏', 'Translation and full article:\n\n> McLaren\'s dominance has been broken thanks to Max Verstappen\'s victory at the Japanese Grand Prix. How did the world champion\'s success come about, and what role did the asphalt play? We answer the most important questions about the race in Suzuka.\n\n> **What was the significance of qualifying?**\nThe celebrations at Red Bull were already loud after the time trial on Saturday (April 5). Max Verstappen had put the RB21 on pole position thanks to his fabulous lap. McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were left empty-handed. What no one could have predicted was that Saturday\'s result would also be the result on Sunday. All experts had assumed that the McLarens would better exploit their strengths in a dry race due to less tire wear.\n\n> But that didn\'t happen. Team principal Christian Horner summed it up after the Grand Prix: ""I can\'t remember any overtaking maneuvers. Almost everyone finished in their starting position. It was a flat-out race from the first to the last lap."" The Englishman praised his star driver: ""That was one of the best weekends of his career.""\n\n> Another crucial factor was that, with very few exceptions, he never allowed his pursuer, Norris, into the DRS window. Horner knew the reason: ""He was particularly strong at the exit of the chicane before the start and finish. He had already secured pole position there yesterday.""\n\n> On Friday\'s practice session (April 4), Red Bull was still in the woods. Sporting director Helmut Marko called it a ""bad car."" But massive setup changes paid off. The car hit the window just in time for Q3. From that moment on, the world champion delivered. Marko enthused: ""He parried all the attacks, was on the limit for 53 laps, and didn\'t make a single mistake.""\n\n> The only time things got tense was when Verstappen and Norris changed tires at the same time on lap 21. Red Bull\'s pit stop took longer than McLaren\'s. Verstappen and Norris exited the pit lane almost level with each other. While accelerating, Norris tried to overtake, but Verstappen didn\'t give in, and Norris briefly skidded through the grass.\n\n> The Englishman immediately complained over the radio, and Verstappen countered: ""He drove into the grass of his own accord."" The stewards did not initiate an investigation. After the race, Norris also had a different opinion, at least publicly: ""I think that\'s racing. And Max would have been the last driver to make way voluntarily anyway.""\n\n> Christian Horner explained why Verstappen\'s stop took too long: ""We wanted to adjust something on the front wing. But that didn\'t work and cost time. It also caused more understeer.""\n\n> **Why did McLaren bring in Piastri first?**\nRed Bull was fortunate that McLaren didn\'t attempt the undercut with Norris. Instead of pitting the second-placed driver first, Piastri was given the hard tire on lap 20. From that moment on, Red Bull knew that Norris would be pitting a lap later and ordered their driver to pit as well. At first glance, it would have made more sense to favor Norris in the fight for victory. But McLaren had to defend against George Russell in the Mercedes.\n\n> The Englishman had already pitted on lap 19. Mercedes calculated that the undercut added 1.5 seconds per lap when switching from the medium to the hard rubber. Piastri also had difficulties with the medium compound. ""I was already within the window to stop and also had some graining on the front tires. We did that to cover the guys behind me.""\n\n> **Why were there so few overtaking maneuvers?**\nWhile Verstappen\'s victory puts him just one point behind championship leader Norris, McLaren was unhappy despite finishing second and third. Team principal Andrea Stella was annoyed by the fact that they had laid new asphalt in the first sector and from the chicane exit at Suzuka. Combined with the hardest tire set available, which Pirelli had brought to Suzuka, there was hardly any tire wear. ""It was a race with almost no tire degradation, and that hurt us because we couldn\'t play to our strengths in that area,"" Stella explained.\n\n> Sauber veteran Beat Zehnder took a different view. ""I wouldn\'t say it should be blamed solely on the new asphalt. We also had the hardest tire compounds available here."" The Swiss driver can imagine that results like those in Suzuka will lead to a different approach from the tire supplier. ""Perhaps Pirelli will bring the softer compounds to Japan next year.\n\n> Zehnder also provided another reason for the few place swaps: ""When you look at how close the field is, overtaking maneuvers become almost impossible. After ten laps, the entire field was only 17 seconds apart."" The overtaking gap is simply too small. The Mercedes strategists spoke of a 1.2-second gap needed to overtake.\n\n> **Why didn\'t McLaren swap places?**\nThe race was like a procession. McLaren could have spiced things up a bit, though. Even in the first stint, Oscar Piastri seemed a bit faster than his teammate Lando Norris after the initial phase. However, there was no exchange of positions.\n\n> Even towards the end of the race, it seemed as if Piastri could set a faster pace than Norris. The Australian therefore asked on the radio if he could be allowed to pass so he could try to attack Max Verstappen.\n\n> McLaren decided against it. Team principal Andrea Stella explained: ""Oscar was barely faster. That wouldn\'t have made any difference. As soon as the gap was within a second, the turbulence from the dirty air was too great. The same would have happened to Oscar."" Red Bull Sport Director Helmut Marko said mischievously: ""We would have swapped. But McLaren has the Papaya Rules, and they\'re their own rules.""\n\n> **What was going on at Ferrari and Mercedes?**\nUntil qualifying, George Russell had been considered McLaren\'s main challenger. But starting fifth, his race was essentially lost. He couldn\'t get past Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari. The aforementioned undercut didn\'t work. Russell ran into Yuki Tsunoda in traffic. Leclerc controlled his opponent after the only stop. Russell\'s teammate, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, finally closed in on the team leader. This was due to the long first stint on the medium tires. The Italian was then able to take advantage of the significantly fresher rubber.\n\n> Lewis Hamilton crossed the finish line in seventh place. The record winner had started on the hard tires. Ferrari team principal Frédéric Vasseur explained the reason: ""It was due to the starting position. Lewis was only eighth. We didn\'t want to send both drivers into the race with the same strategy.""\n\n> The Frenchman was once again forced to face critical questions after an average weekend. Ferrari is too far behind its rivals. ""We\'re missing two to three tenths of a second in qualifying. In the race, it\'s even more. We\'re talking about three to four tenths."" However, the mixed start to the season hasn\'t led Vasseur to resort to impulsiveness: ""We don\'t have to and won\'t change our approach from last year."" However, he held out hope for a miracle: ""You\'ll never improve by three to four tenths in one fell swoop.""', '*I curse the asphalt down in Suzuka*', ""The asphalt thing is pretty interesting because that was my theory on why China and Japan were more difficult for McLaren, it's not just because of dirty air (since in Zandvoort or Baku last year McLaren was able to pass even with dirty air) although that played a part still. McLaren seems to only pull out big advantages at the end of stints where the tires are falling off a bit. Both China and Japan had resurfaced tracks and a relatively cool race day with  rain falling beforehand making the track too friendly on the tires for that fall off to even happen.\n\nSo far, McLaren was only able to pull a pace advantage at the very end in China (although Lando's brake issues prevented something interesting), and right at the tail end of the medium stint in Japan. And that's because there's so little tire deg that McLaren's advantage doesn't really form. I also have a theory that Lando seems to be able to run better at the end of stints when tyres are beginning to fall off, and not having that advantage also neuters his driving style more which is friendlier on the rear tyres."", ""Bringing Lando in on the same lap as Max was such a wasted opportunity. They should've pitted him first and try the undercut, or go long like Antonelli did. If Oscar got in the way they could swap places like they did in Hungary."", 'So then Red Bull says: ""Kiss my asphalt""', 'Why was Suzuka even repaved in the first place? The asphalt looked perfectly fine last year and that is with the tons of local racing and track days!', ""I'd be careful if I were McLaren here tbh. Sure, it's the last year of the current regulations and focus has already shifted to next year at most teams, but the rest of the grid isn't that far away from them, especially when you consider how the McLaren seems to be tricky when pushed to its limits in qualifying (their pace advantage has masked this as both drivers can back off and still qualify really well). Red Bull seemed invincible after 2023 too and their car seemed to have no weakness other than Perez, but it all switched in 2024. The order of things could flip really fast if Red Bull or ~~Ferrari~~ Mercedes nails an upgrade package.""]",78,45,0.85,78,283,283,3,0,0.010000000000000009,3

Thanks!","['RBR still has the best on track operations. They are the team who makes the changes between Friday and Saturday work the most.', ""I have to say - I do think people are overreacting a bit coming off of this race in regards to these regs. I think the reasons why we've had such an astoundingly tedious race (even by Suzuka standards) is a combination of factors such as - late track resurfacing that caught up Pirelli and their tyre choices off guard, and the weather that was too dull, to put it simply (cool, but not damp or cool enough to make it interesting, like making cars slide all over the place, but neither was it warm enough to induce serious tyre wear). Having said that - no changes to the regs did make it so the team's were completely unobstructed from adding elements and making changes to their cars that would make them even harder to follow, but I do think this was an unfortunate exaggeration of the problem. On top of that - Pirelli cannot be completely absolved of the blame here. Their task is horrible, difficult, and the combination of those words, yes, but fact of the matter is - Hard is just an op tyre now, and that shouldn't be the case."", 'Falling asleep on lap 7 and waking up with two laps left to the grid being almost identical was a trip.', ""I think people are being too harsh on McLaren. The race was won in qualifying because of a Max god lap. Undercuts and overcuts were both notoriously unsuccessful throughout the entire field, and the cool surface with zero tire deg made overcoming dirty air to overtake virtually impossible.\n\nI think alot of people were broken by the 2023 Red Bull. That's not the bar...no car has ever been that dominant when you factor in the complete package + reliability. McLaren's car isn't utterly dominant, they aren't going to win every race, and Suzuka has been Red Bull's most dominant track in these ground effect regs.\n\nThere are 21 races and a pretty substantial aero rule change still to occur this year, we all need to pump the brakes a bit."", 'For everyone saying McLaren could have challenged Max with a split strategy, they are correct. However, Lando and Oscar’s side of the garage clearly see each other as the main championship rival. \n\nOne side of the garage will not be ready to take a statistically weaker strategy that can hand an advantage to the other, not at this stage at least.\n\nIt’s like asking Nico to sacrifice a win in 2016 to let Hamilton win against Max/Seb or something.\n\nThe McL’s aren’t that ahead of the pack as a 2016 Merc yet not early season I do not see any driver sacrificing anything.', ""Ah, Suzuka. Probably the best circuit in the world, and one I plan to go to next year, but yesterday was absolutely dull.\n\nOn one hand, I don't mind there being races like that. The 2010 season is one of my all time favourites but it did also feature several dull races. I think what made yesterday frustrating was the fact that across the whole grid, very little happened. The race between the front three was pretty much the only battle across the grid, and even then Norris never got close enough to even get DRS. Max won the race on Saturday, and the overall performance from him was probably his best ever. I know people rank CoTA 2021 as his finest race but I think this was better overall.\n\nThe main worry I've got for the season is Pirelli. It's a small sample size but so far the Hard tyre in both China and Japan was absolutely incredible. Zero deg, zero graining and easily the outright fastest race tyre. As a result, there is only one strategic option available (M-H). Pirelli either need to be a bit braver and make all tyres softer, or where possible the H needs to be a step harder so that it is truly slow and a two stop becomes a better strategy. Ideally the hard should be between 1.5-2s slower than the Medium. \n\nOddly, last year at Suzuka tyre deg was a really issue and we saw a mixture of 1,2 and 3 pit stops across the grid. Perhaps the resurfacing has made the track too easy on the tyres? Likewise, the cold weather probably helped. A track as brutal as Suzuka should not be an easy one stop imo."", 'It will be interesting to see McLarens advantage at much hotter tracks considering we’ve had colder weather during the first 3 races. We will see if anyone can get near them in Bahrain and Jeddah where the weather is going to be much hotter.', 'Hirakawa going from FP1 in an Alpine to changing teams and doing FP1 in a Haas within a week is insane and I’m totally here for it', ""Well that was a bit of a dull race. I did enjoy the tension from the top three basically being close together the whole race. With Max being the one in front though, I wasn't really expecting him to make a mistake. After the pitstops I didn't really think McLaren could win the race, unless Max' tyres would've fallen off massively.\n\nThe biggest issue with this race was that the resurfaced part of the track meant that there was a lot less tyre degradation than expected. It was also quite cool. I don't remember who said it, but on Friday during practice apparently there was a lot more deg. Contrary to some people I saw yesterday, I don't really blame Pirelli. Last season they brought the correct tyre range in Japan and we had the two stop. They simply can't account for everything, they don't know how much deg the resurfacing will bring, they can't control the weather.\n\nMaybe a bit of a weird opinion but I'm kind of glad that the TV director missed the pit exit shenanigans by their stupid decision to switch to Leclercs pitstop. It was the only thing that brought some tention because we missed what actually happened. Meanwhile if we'd been with Max and Lando the whole time, we wouldn't even have had the tention of 'did Max do something?'. We would have just seen Lando drive himself into the grass the first time around.
