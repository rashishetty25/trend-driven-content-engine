1hmkuul,Trip to Modena and Maranello,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hmkuul/trip_to_modena_and_maranello/,2024-12-26, Discussion,"Hello, 
My wife and I are planning a trip to the Modena and Maranello museums soon. I know there have been many posts about visiting these museums, but I’m unsure how up-to-date the information is, and I still have a few questions.

1. How do we get from Modena to Maranello and back? We’ll be traveling by train from Bologna to Modena and back. I’ve seen that there’s a shuttle bus on the museum website, but the timetable seems a bit inconvenient. Are there any better options for getting between the two museums? And if there's a bus between them, how do we get the tickets?

2. Can we visit both museums in one day, or would you recommend dedicating a full day to each?

3. I read in another post that someone recommended taking a guide during the visit, but I didn’t see this option when booking tickets online. Is it possible to hire a guide on-site?

4. I’ve never used a simulator before—not even on a PC. Would the F1 simulator experience still be worth it, or would it likely be frustrating since I’m a complete beginner?

5. Are there any must-visit spots near the museums? This could be anything—great places to eat, nice walking areas, or other attractions in the vicinity.

6. Are there any must-buy souvenirs from either museum, or are there better shops nearby?
Is photography allowed in the museums, and are there any specific spots that are particularly great for photos?

Sorry for so many questions. Thanks in advance for your advice and tips!","['I did both this year in August.\n\n1.\tWe had a car so I can’t talk about transit unfortunately, we parked at Fiorano and got the coach in to Maranello. \n2.\tWe did both in the same day, it was just right, not too much to do at all. \n3.\tWe didn’t book a guide or feel like it was necessary. We did book tickets online beforehand. \n4.\tThe simulators are great and beginner friendly. Maranello has an F1 simulator, and Modena has a GT style one. The one in Modena is cheaper! \n5.\tWe just did these two, but if you get the coach in to the museum you can see Fiorano too. \n6.\tThe shops are very expensive, we didn’t buy anything there.', 'I didn’t visit Modena, but did go to Maranello and also took a bus tour around Maranello that goes into the production areas. \n\n2. A full day was not needed for me in Maranello museum. Couple hours personally. \n\n3. A guide wasn’t necessary to me…but would imagine it depends on the level of Ferrari you already know or care to know. \n\n4. I passed on this, it was something like an additional 30 USD for like 10 minutes. But I have a sim rig at home with arguably better hardware lol. Pretty confident they were running Assetto Corsa which is a standard available game, not some crazy secret proprietary software.  But still may be cool as it will allow your brain to see how fast some stuff comes at you. \n\n6. Photography was allowed and encouraged in Maranello. When I did the little bus through the campus tour it wasn’t allowed. I did not find the campus bus tour worth the extra money.', ""2. It depends how much time you'll spend there, but it took me about 1,5-2h to leasurly walk though the Museo in Maranello and have a close look at everything.\n\n  \n4. The simulators are fun, but very expensive. Obviously they are not real cockpits, but very roomy versions and you can chose your driving assist when you get in. So if you're unexperienced, you can still have a go. The chassis moves left and right underneath you to simulate the car movements, but personally I found it very distracting because - if i remember correctly - the screen didn't move.\n\n  \nJust have a great time there, usually there'll be interesting cars in the car park from other visitors"", ""There is a dedicated Ferrari bus from Modena's station to Maranello's museum. Look for it on the internet for more info, it's quite intuitive."", '5.  If you enjoy fine dining experiences I would recommend making a reservation for lunch at Ristorante Cavallino (Maranello).  We really enjoyed our lunch here.  We visited the Modena museum in the morning and then the Maranello in the afternoon with a fabulous lunch in between.', 'Hi! My 2 cents: I did both museums in one day, it is feasible if you don’t read every single thing you find around. I tried the sim, I think it’s worth it: ask to run at Monza, you’ll at least enjoy the straights and a couple of corners; if the guy there is into it you might want to ask them to tell you when to break, otherwise break as hard as you can at the 100 meters mark. You can visit Maranello, have lunch at Cavallino and move to Modena. I’m a long time fan and a bit of a mechanical engineering junkie, it was a blast: hope you’ll have a great time! Maybe you can spend a bit of time ahead with your wife researching and reading what you’ll find there (eg the cars that are in the gallery of champions) to have something to look forwards to!', 'If you will use a shuttle between the two museums make sure to purchase the tickets upfront (online). You can buy them onsite, but they prioritize people who already have tickets and in case there are a lot of people you will take the bus first.

Walked from Modena Station over to the Enzo Ferrari Museum. From there we took the shuttle bus to Museo Ferrari first and did our self guided tour. I dont think a guide is necessary to be honest. I booked the simulator experience on the spot since I wasnt sure how much time I would have before the factory tour started. Did the simulator experience and then did the factory bus tour. Then took the official Shuttle back to Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena and toured that. Then took the train back to Bologna.\xa0', '1. I did the bus and I am not sure there are better public transport. You can book the bus ticket when you book the museum tickets online.\n\n2. I think you can do both museums in one day, but if you are going for the factory tour as well then it may be a bit tight, but I think it should still be manageable. I would strongly recommend the factory bus tour and I quite like the guide. You can book the factory tour when booking museum tickets too. \n\n5. If you want to drive a Ferrari but not rich enough to buy one you can rent a Ferrari to driver around Maranello. Also, you can walk from the museum to the entrance of GeS (or whatever it is called now), which is where the Scuderia is, and when they take the iconic photo. You can see Haas and Scuderia Ferrari staff walking in and out. \n\n6. There are some souvenir shops near the museum. They sell some driver signed merch as well if you are interested.', 'I’d also like to add that r/grandprixtravel would be a really great resource for you!

Engines for example have been highly uniform. Everything has been very tightly homologated on that front since approx 1996 with the V10s, then after 2005 with the V8s and since 2014 with the hybrids. Those regs have included development freezes too. Compare that to the immediate post-turbo environment where you had Ford V8s vs Renault V10s and Ferrari & Honda V12s and it feels like a completely different sport, a Wild West version of F1.\n\nThen we have the circuits - Tilkedromes have basically been a constant since approx mid 2000s and the only real difference is they aren’t universally thought of as bad for the sport today. We’ve had more street circuits recently though and I like the variety they provide. Along with the circuits we have had the global expansion of the sport going back to 2004 with the introduction of Bahrain and China. Before then, F1 was basically a championship of Europe, a little bit of the Americas with Japan and Australia tacked on.\n\nIn-season testing also just hasn’t been much of a thing in our time. Gone is the unlimited Ferrari running around Fiorano. There’s probably far more I’m missing - I didn’t mention how bulletproof the cars seem in comparison to the 1990s, but I definitely feel like the F1 of circa 2001 has far more in common with today’s F1 than it does with the sport of ten years prior.', ""that's really funny! reminds me the stat that hamilton verstappen hold record for most 1-2 finishes. not sure what is the exact number, because that had some since [this article](https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1015574/1/alltime-joint-record-hamilton-and-verstappen-set) came out."", 'Reminds me of a vaguely similar quirk about 1997: Villeneuve and Schumacher were the two title contenders but they never once stood on the podium together.']",6,19,0.72,6,17,17,2,3,0.010000000000000009,2

But it’s not about reactions – which is the physical asset which most obviously begins to decline with age.\n\n>We know this because there have been many tests done of F1 driver reactions – and the outcome is completely normal; a range from fast to slow, just as in any control group of non-racing drivers. One of the greatest racing drivers of all time, Michael Schumacher, had notoriously poor reactions when measured.\n\n>“About the same as mine,” related his then-boss Ross Brawn. Dr. Ricardo Ceccarelli, whose Formula Medicine establishment has worked with a high proportion of the F1 grid of the last three decades, has conducted this test as a matter of routine. He says: “The range is completely normal from fast to slow reactions with the group. My secretary actually had one of the best scores.”\n\n>It's not about reactions, it’s about feel. Reactions measure the response time of our central nervous system to a stimulus. Research conducted by defence contractor (and one-time Williams sponsor) QinetiQ to determine physical suitability of candidates for fighter pilot roles found that sensitivity to rotation and yaw (the very things a racing driver is using to feel and balance a car through a corner) came from receptors in our lower spine which pass messages sub-consciously (and therefore instantly, with zero delay) to our middle ear.\n\n>This would seem to suggest that the effectiveness of this neural pathway is what actually differentiates who can feel a car better than someone else and probably therefore how naturally quick they are.\n\nShame the people who only read headlines and smugly make conclusions will likely miss out on it."", ""This is a really great article. As always Mark is one of the few writers who can explain how a driver like Lewis can find lap time, and link that to why the current cars don't work for him. \n\nThe section about the medical tests for reaction time is fascinating. You only have to look at Alonso's performance to see that age won't be a factor for Lewis."", '""So, another myth which needs to be put to bed: the ‘fastest driver’.\n\nThere is hardly ever such thing as a definitive ‘fastest driver’. That can be a different driver from one day to the next, depending upon what limitations the car is putting on their respective skill sets. Some drivers have a wider skill set than others – Fernando Alonso springs to mind. But sometimes only at the expense of the peak performance.\n\nBut when a super-skilled driver has a car which rewards his skillset fully, we can invariably see very special things from them and it is this which generally forms the perceptions. Max Verstappen is one such, Lewis Hamilton has been another, Charles Leclerc can do very special things with a car just as he likes it.""\n\nThis bit is so interesting.\n\nSo a potentially good way to ""rank"" drivers would be to see who can have the highest ceiling of performance in a range of car limitations.', ""I always felt the mark of a great driver is their adaptability.\n\nHamilton has driven in F1 since 2007? That's 18 years by now of competition, regulation changes and team changes and he has been mighty competitive in almost all those years\n\nPerhaps his relative decline is really more a function of age and/or motivation since 2021. It's a bit hard to expect an athlete to remain at his peak forevermore"", 'With the 2026 cars going down a different route, especially with the move back to higher running cars, I do wonder if Lewis might end up being much stronger then, even if Leclerc does convincingly outperform him next year.', 'Yapping']",0,40,0.5,0,35,35,0,1,0.06,0
