This is designed to show when the drivers have had good runs of form and also dips in there results. The first 4 races are just an average of all the races up until that point as a 5 race average is not possible. e.g. the ""average"" for Australia is just the race results for that race as there was no previous races.

His results then stayed around the same until Spain where they dropped off heavily after a DNF in Canada. His average was then down after that race as even though he was getting podiums, the DNF skewed his average. This is then compounded by the DNF in the Dutch GP after which he hasn't got a win since.

Oscar didn't have a great start to the season finishing P9 in Australia but his performances picked up and as he won the next race in China, After which he only finished off the podium once up until Azerbaijan where he DNFed and has not got on the podium since which as brought down his average significantly.

Max had a good start to the season but his average finish was slowly declining until is dramatically dropped off after he was taken out by Kimi Antonelli on the first lap in Austria.

Again.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oflyo6/the_wdc_may_go_down_to_the_wire_in_abu_dhabi_again/,2025-10-25, Discussion,"The championship might get decided in Abu Dhabi as we could end up with a 3-way tie in Qatar. I came across this nice website and played around with it a bit: https://ykstv.com

Current points (gap): 
* Piastri: 346
* Norris: 332 (14)
* Verstappen: 306 (40)

Let’s assume we have VER 1st, NOR 2nd and PIA 3rd in the next 4 races. Also, in the sprints we assume that Oscar goes 2nd and 4th, Lando 1st and 3rd, and Max 2nd and 4th.

Projected points:
* Piastri: 346 + 60 (race) + 12 (sprint) = 418
* Norris: 332 + 72 (race) + 14 (sprint) = 418 
* Verstappen: 306 +100 (race) + 12 (sprint) = 418

It’s a very specific scenario that gives us 3 drivers tied going into the last race. Not very likely but not out of the question either.

More likely is that we have something similar play out where their points are not exactly equal  but are close enough that the winner of Abu Dhabi will be crowned WDC.

Hopefully 2025 will not be mired in controversy like 2021.  But who knows? It might be something worse than that. This sport does not lack for drama, on track or off track.","[""Has had to win everything to get close, or McLaren needs to even more fuck up, and then still he has to win everything.

This is exactly what made ""IS THAT GLOCK?!"" moment special. Massa camp was already celebrating as Felipe crossed the line, but one position gained on the last corner flipped the scenario in Lewis\' favour.', ""I'll be amazed if Max hasn't wrapped it up by then. It isn't just the red bull is now competitive, it's the other crucial factor of Ferrari and merc coming good. Red Bull bring 4 upgrades this weekend, 2 of which are performance enhancing. McLaren being . . . nothing"", 'Is that so?', 'Lando might have it wrapped up before then if he wins this weekend I think', 'Or Mclaren has dominant pace again and Max loses points and will have a larger gap and fewer races.']",0,55,0.31,0,211,211,0,0,0.0,0
