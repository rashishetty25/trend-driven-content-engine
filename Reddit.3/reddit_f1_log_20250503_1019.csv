Also because the Papaya racer controls the tyre temperatures better than the competition. Red Bull is desperately trying to find out what trick is behind this.\n\nFour of this year's five Grands Prix went to a McLaren driver. The success of the Papaya racers has a name. Almost perfect tyre management. No other car in the field manages to get the tyres up to temperature quickly and then keep them in the magic window so reliably. No matter what the tarmac temperature, no matter what the track,\n\nThis quality helps the McLaren drivers on a fast qualifying lap and even more so in the race. On a lap, because the tyres deliver consistent grip from the first to the last lap. The sector times in Miami underline this. In the first sector, Max Verstappen takes a tenth of a second off the fastest McLaren. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri are ahead in the second and third.\n\nIn the race, the advantage is even more striking. Once the McLaren drivers are ahead, they are unstoppable. Oscar Piastri has always been merciful in defeating his pursuers. But only because he matched the pace of his pursuers. In Jeddah, the Australian set his personal fastest lap right at the end. To show the competition: I had them all under control.\n\n**Lots of blue, little red and orange**\n\nSince the start of the season, opponents have been puzzling over how McLaren manages to control tyre temperatures so well even under the most difficult conditions. Red Bull is making the greatest effort to unravel the mystery. Thermal imaging cameras are used to determine the temperature at the tyre cooling ducts during the pit stops.\n\nThere is a particular focus on the rear tyres because they generally overheat more quickly than the front tyres. And the thermal images, especially at the heat races in Bahrain and Jeddah, showed that there were many blue areas around the brake vents on the McLaren tyres, while all the other cars showed a lot of orange and red. Conclusion at Red Bull: ‚ÄòIt's impossible that you can cool so well with air alone.‚Äô\n\n**McLaren mocks Red Bull suspicion**\n\nRecently, the old suspicion that McLaren uses water in the tyres to keep the rubber rollers cool came up again. McLaren boss Zak Brown considers the allegation to be ‚Äòridiculous‚Äô. He provocatively had his drinks bottle labelled ‚ÄòTire water‚Äô at the command post.\n\nAccording to McLaren, the amazing capabilities of the MCL39 are a combination of plenty of downforce, good vehicle balance and innovation. Whatever that means. It could be particularly clever airflow within the brake ducts, the use of materials that keep the circulating air within a certain temperature window, or some other clever trick to cool the air.\n\nOpponents regularly bombard the FIA with requests to solve the mystery by process of elimination from the response of the world governing body's technicians. Red Bull and its sister team Toro Rosso stand out in particular. Whatever it is, it appears to be legal. The actionism of the opponents has led to the FIA taking a particularly close look."", ""Red Bull suspects McLaren has found a clever way to bring their tires into the ideal temperature window more quickly, especially in qualifying. Some believe McLaren might be optimizing brake duct design or using advanced thermal coatings or suspension geometry tweaks to manage tire temps more effectively. It's subtle, but in F1, tenths matter."", ""I think it's pretty clear they found some sort of trick, to suddenly have found their way from the middle of the grid to dominating the field in no time at all isn't just by improving the car I would assume.""]",111,62,0.89,111,58,58,9,4,0.010000000000000009,9

With a monster lap in the final qualifying session, the youngster left even the strong McLaren cars behind.**\n\n> Until his sixth Formula 1 weekend, Kimi Antonelli flew somewhat under the radar. The Mercedes rookie made few mistakes but always remained a touch behind teammate George Russell in terms of pace. But in Miami, his restraint was over. On a track Antonelli only knew from the simulator, the 18-year-old raced to the sprint pole on Friday (May 2).\n\n> The youngster repeatedly showed flashes of his talent in the first few laps of qualifying. Antonelli was consistently on par with Russell. It quickly became clear that the Mercedes drivers\' lap times could put them right up there with the front runners. But in the final top ten, the two Silver Arrows drivers drifted apart, largely due to the engineers\' tactics.\n\n> Russell was sent out for his fast run right after the start of the final session, when the asphalt didn\'t yet offer optimal grip. The Englishman\'s lap was only enough for fifth place. ""I didn\'t feel entirely comfortable in the car today. We thought there might be yellow flags at the end of the session. We wanted to be on the safe side,"" Russell explained the tactic.\n\n> **No official age record.**\nFortunately for Mercedes, Antonelli was able to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. In the end, the clock stopped at 1:26.482 minutes ‚Äì no one had ever been that fast in Miami before. ""That was an intense qualifying session,"" the rookie breathed a sigh of relief after the daring ride. ""I already felt good in practice. Then on the last lap, I pulled everything together. It\'s nice to start from the front. It\'s a completely new feeling. Let\'s see how it goes.""\n\n> Had it been a normal qualifying session, Antonelli would have beaten Sebastian Vettel\'s pole record by a full two and a half years. However, because it wasn\'t the right qualifying session, the Heppenheim native retains the age record. If Antonelli\'s learning curve continues to climb steeply, it\'s only a matter of time before the teenager starts from the front of the field in a proper Grand Prix.\n\n> With his lap, Antonelli even managed to keep the two more highly rated McLarens behind. Oscar Piastri, in the faster of the Papaya racers, ended up 45 thousandths of a second short of pole. Lando Norris couldn\'t beat Antonelli\'s time either. A tenth of a second behind means third place on the grid. Alongside the vice world champion, champion Max Verstappen will start the sprint from fourth place.\n\n> **H√ºlkenberg narrowly misses top ten.**\nThe two Ferraris were unable to compete for the top spots in Miami. Ultimately, the Scuderia drivers had to settle for sixth and seventh place. Charles Leclerc once again won the internal battle against Lewis Hamilton. Alex Albon, Isack Hadjar, and Fernando Alonso were at the bottom of the top ten.\n\n> Nico H√ºlkenberg narrowly missed the top ten finale, finishing 11th.
