1kj5t2q,McLaren's Brake (phase changing) Context,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kj5t2q/mclarens_brake_phase_changing_context/,2025-05-10, Discussion,"The videos on phase changing materials are complex and I see many people disregarding it because it seems far-fetched as the discussion has an air of ""ground breaking technology"" which attracts valid scepticism. But there is a more ""simple"" side to it which relates to Red Bull's rumoured ""water in the tyres"" claim. It might not be as unlikely as you think. 

Whether they are using a solid or not in F1, phase changing cooling has been a staple in mobile/small devices for decades as it is basically the only way to efficiently cool such a small device without a pump. If youre using a phone or laptop right now, you are using a phase changing coolant system. Heat pipes or vapor chambers in your device transition water into gas, then back into water when the temp drops. If you've ever had a hot laptop on your lap, its fighting for life to keep the temperature below 100 degrees by constantly changing state. Similar to how an engine circulates coolant to a radiator, except this is pumped so there is no need to rely on a state change to circulate the coolant. 

If a team suspects brakes have heat pipes to regulate brake and tyre temp, a state change and liquid is involved for circulation, hence the water rumour. The high temperatures involved mean they could be using a solid to liquid change as the videos discuss, or it could be a high temp liquid.

The point is that while it is an innovative motorsport idea, its not a scientific breakthrough. Which imo makes it more believable.","['Liquid cooling is strictly prehibited in any form for the brakes though, and the FIA wouldn’t have cleared it if that was the case.\n\nSSPCMs (shape stabilized phase changing materials), are a more likely candidate, but they are not as effective for this use case.\n\nThere’s also a lot of regulatory constrains in the form of legality boxes around the drums, which make the implementation really difficult.\n\nIt’s s cool idea definitely, and could end up being what they’re doing, but its far from being conclusively proven.', 'A ton of people are misunderstanding what phase change materials are \n\nThey’re not anything like moveable materials based off its heat, they’re as their name says, materials that absorb or expel heat using the properties of a phase change\n\nFor example, boiling water cannot exceed 100c at ambient pressures, meaning if you keep adding heat it will stay at a 100 until it all boils off completely', 'This post has a no yapping by just the glamour part of f1 fans.

The purpose of the phase change in heat pipes is so that convection can be used to transfer heat more efficiently. The PCMs rumored* have been the solid to liquid type, not the liquid the gas type. The applications of this type are more in line with the constant temperature thermal battery idea, though it’s still unclear to me how that results in the behavior that we see with the McLaren.\n\n* rumor is a strong word here, it’s a hypothesis from a former f1 engineer. It isn’t alleged to come from within the paddock so it’s basically meaningless.', ""It's a good theory, but I'm apprehensive about it. You generally want to minimise unsprung mass. How much of this material would you actually need? I'd love to see some estimates."", ""The materials will only absorb so much heat before it essentially become deadweight.

Its seems everyone keeps forgetting that McLaren haven’t even touched the car yet. one update and you can forget about qualifying ahead of them', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Max Verstappen has been complaining regularly about his car\'s handling this year. The understeer is particularly annoying. But the engineers fear the problem won\'t be completely resolved, even with upgrades.**\n\n> In Bahrain, the first warning sign had already been given. And in Miami, Max Verstappen was unable to compensate for his car\'s deficiencies. In the end, the world champion crossed the finish line just 40 seconds behind winner Oscar Piastri. ""Max was able to pull off a magic trick on one lap in qualifying. In the race, we saw that we were losing an average of seven-tenths to a second per lap to the McLaren,"" calculated Motorsport Director Helmut Marko.\n\n> Verstappen had already complained about his car\'s steering behavior in free practice. As has often been the case this season, the rear end initially feels light when braking and turning. Towards the apex, the balance shifts increasingly toward understeer. It\'s difficult for the drivers to adjust to this shift in balance. The lack of confidence leads to frustration and lost time on the clock.\n\n> To alleviate the problem, the engineers brought a new underbody to Miami. The upgrade was originally planned for Imola, but a sample was finally ready in time for the Florida trip. Naturally, it was installed on the number 1 race car. It\'s rare for such a major change to be used on a sprint weekend, where there\'s only one free practice session for testing and data collection.\n\n> **Underbody alleviates problem.**\nAccording to chief engineer Paul Monaghan, however, the risk was limited. ""We saw in the wind tunnel that the stability of the airflow was unchanged compared to the old underbody. Therefore, we weren\'t worried about it suddenly becoming aerodynamically unstable. The new underbody simply produces a little more downforce,"" the Briton explained.\n\n> The car\'s sensors then spit out the expected values. But it wasn\'t a cure for the problems: ""We know the areas where we need to improve. They\'re the same after Miami as they were before Miami,"" explained team principal Christian Horner. ""The new underbody delivered what we wanted. It\'s part of a series of upgrades that will come over the next few races.""\n\n> Helmut Marko also hopes that the engineers have something more up their sleeve: ""The understeer problem isn\'t solved yet. It improved somewhat with the new underbody, but we still have work to do. I hope that a solution will be ready by Imola so that the car can finally find balance.""\n\n> **No one-stop solution.**\nChief Engineer Monaghan tries to temper expectations somewhat in this regard: ""There\'s no one-size-fits-all solution. It\'s only possible with small advances in many areas. We know what\'s happening to the car, but finding a cure isn\'t so simple. It may never even go away completely. But we should at least be able to mitigate the extent of it. We have a lot of clever people in Milton Keynes working hard on it. I\'m sure it will get better.""\n\n> The question is whether it won\'t be too late for Verstappen\'s title dreams until the engineers finally cure the RB21\'s mood swings. With a current 32-point deficit, Horner sees the situation as already tense: ""The World Championship is over 24 races. The road is long. But McLaren looks very impressive in Miami. Things can change, of course. But we should start reducing the points deficit in the next few races.""\n\n> **Hope for Barcelona turnaround.**\nRed Bull\'s own upgrades aren\'t the only thing intended to bring them closer to McLaren. Hopes are also pinned on the new front wing regulations being introduced for the Spanish Grand Prix. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200bthe front end of the car is no longer allowed to flex as much under load. All top teams need to make improvements here to pass the more stringent FIA tests. This could potentially hit McLaren harder.\n\n> ""It\'s difficult to predict at this point what the impact will be,"" Horner pondered. ""But it\'s not just a small adjustment; it\'s a fundamental change. It will definitely affect all cars, in many areas. It\'s just a question of the extent.""', 'Im actually really excited for the Barcelona “reg” change. Horner says it will affect all the cars differently.\n\nLike imagine we show up and Ferrari are fastest or something\xa0', 'i can’t imagine how they’d be able to contend for the wdc unless they figure out a tyre cooling trick similar to mcl because even if they solve all their balance problems all of a sudden, their tyre deg will never be as good especially in hot conditions', 'So, just another day for a team not at the front row ;)', ""If only they had some sort of warning about the car balance or that they were heading into the wrong development direction!  \n\n\nNo one ever said anything, nothing at all, no way they could've known!"", 'As has been pointed out by AMUS and by Toto Wolff, this was not an overnight solution. McLaren had problems with brake ducts as far back as 2022 and at the start of 2023. The brakes were the centrepiece of their regulation era and 3 seasons into it, they appear to have perfected an idea that started in 2022. It takes time, it takes money and it took a lot of trial and error. \n\nThe fact that it’s something hidden within the brakes, means that even if they wreck the car and it gets craned 50ft into the air, the teams will still not be able to see what it is hidden behind the tyres. In a way that’s the beauty of what they’ve done.']",286,73,0.96,286,69,69,12,3,0.0,12

It's also not an issue if there's too many zones like in Australia, because it's not free lap time gain.
