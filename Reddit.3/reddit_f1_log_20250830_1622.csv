It happened on Sunday, June 9, 1957. Car races were also held on the dune circuit that day. In one of them, Willem Adriaan Gerlach, a doctor from the village Appelscha, started in his Porsche 1600 S. Shortly before the end of the race, however, he lost control of the car in the first corner after the Tarzan corner. The car rolled over three times and, according to a journalist from the Leeuwarder Courant, ended up in a potato field.  
  
Gerlach was thrown from the car. Unconscious, the driver was taken to the Sint Elisabethgasthuis hospital in Haarlem. There, his condition proved so serious that he died of his injuries that night.  
  
Gerlach was 47 years old. He had run a general practice in Appelscha since 1940, also serving residents of Fochteloo and Zorgvlied. He left behind a wife and three children. The bend where the fatal accident occurred was later named the Gerlach corner.  
  
The accompanying photo of Gerlach's crashed car appeared in several newspapers on Tuesday, June 11, 1957,  
","[""Other guys that had corners named after them in Zandvoort weren't doing much better in that regard. \n\nThe Slotemakerbocht is named after Rob Slotemaker, who suffered a fatal neck injury in a race at the track in 1979.

The times from the highest session reached by both drivers has been used - so for example if Max reached Q3 but Yuki went out Q1, I‚Äôve used the Q1 times for both. This is to try and control for track evolution the best I can.

If a driver couldn‚Äôt set a time in the highest session both reached its been excluded completely to try and make it fair. An example of why is Saudi with the McLarens - Lando crashed and didn‚Äôt set a Q3 time, but if I used Q2 instead it has him faster than Oscar, which doesn‚Äôt seem representative.

Sprints have been included because I don‚Äôt see why not :)","['Funny how there is so much criticism about some rookies but Kimi remains untouched by both the media and fans.', 'Thanks for this!\n\nVery tight fight for rookie of the year between Hadjar and Bortoleto!', ""Great presentation!
