1k5gu1b,Is Oscar Piastri's decision to snub Alpine for McLaren in 2022 one of the smartest career moves in F1 history?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k5gu1b/is_oscar_piastris_decision_to_snub_alpine_for/,2025-04-22, Discussion,"Aside from the obvious example of Hamilton’s gamble to join Mercedes, are there many career decisions in F1 that have worked out better than Piastri’s choice to ditch Alpine for McLaren?

Back in early July 2022, while still an Alpine reserve driver, it was already speculated that Piastri had signed a deal with McLaren — even though at the time, McLaren were behind Alpine in terms of car performance.

When Alonso made his shock move to Aston Martin, many expected Piastri to step up and partner Ocon at Alpine. Instead, he stuck with his McLaren move — a decision that completely altered his career path for the better. Rather than scrapping for the odd points finish at Alpine, Piastri now finds himself a championship contender in just his third F1 season.

For some perspective:

Points since Piastri joined F1:

Oscar Piastri — 488

Alpine F1 Team — 190

And just for fun: if Piastri had gone to Alpine as originally planned, who do you reckon would be Lando Norris’s teammate right now? I’d guess Gasly.","['Certainly, although Hamilton joining Mercedes in a shock move is probably better.', 'Lewis to Mercedes netted him 6 WDC. \n\nSchumacher to Ferrari netted him 5 WDC. \n\nNeither team on top when they moved. \n\nKimi to Lotus on a £50k per point contract is worth a mention too, if for different reasons.', ""Piastri obviously made the right call but he definitely didn't snub Alpine. It seems Alpine's propaganda is hard to fight.\n\nHe never had a seat at Alpine. By the time they came calling, he was already committed to McLaren.\n\nAlpine ran a smear campaign and Piastri couldn't fight back because his deal with McLaren wasn't public yet, but Alpine certainly knew about it."", 'I think the only better move I can think of to date was Hamilton to Mercedes in 2013, possibly Schumacher to Ferrari in 1996 but that took a few years to show championship level results', ""Not really, it was a common sense move because at the time the deal was made it was a guaranteed seat vs a potential seat at one of either Alpine or Williams.\n\nIt's similar to the Verstappen situation where he was being courted by everyone, but only Red Bull had an F1 drive to give him immediately. There was not much risk, if anything the risk was staying with Alpine. It was an opportunity."", ""Also, Mark Webber's biggest achievement in F1."", ""He's the anti-Alonso but in all honesty it didn't really appear like a risk at the time; merely a tremendous opportunity."", '100 race plan to win the title in full swing.

He hopes that through updates in three stages Red Bull can really take the fight to McLaren.*\n\nThe Bahrain Grand Prix, as is well known, has been the low point of the Formula One season so far for Red Bull Racing. Max Verstappen managed to limit the damage somewhat with a sixth place, but the reality was that Red Bull proved powerless with the RB21 at the Sakhir circuit. A weekend later, the world looked a lot better. Verstappen managed to claim pole position in Jeddah and, according to Christian Horner and Helmut Marko, would normally have won the race as well, were it not for a five-second time penalty that threw a spanner in the works.\n\n**Updates in three stages: “**We are taking small steps”\n\n“We were surprised, but positively surprised,” Marko revealed afterwards in the paddock in Jeddah about the race pace. “Compared to Bahrain we made a lot of progress, although this circuit also suits us better. Here you have many more fast corners and different asphalt, which helped us,” Marko acknowledged. Nevertheless, he also sees signs that the 81-year-old Austrian believes indicate more structural improvement. “We are making strides and trying to make the car more predictable. Furthermore, we are working on making the car a bigger window.” With those last words, Marko is referring to the car's set-up window. Horner has already explained that Red Bull was unable to find that in Bahrain, which made the picture look particularly bad, and that the optimal window was found for that circuit prior to qualifying in Jeddah.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Red Bull had some new parts on the car, with Marko explaining that these were three-step updates. In Miami - as in Jeddah - another small upgrade should follow, followed by more in Imola, according to the Austrian. “We are making small steps. I think that around Imola we should be in a position where we have the speed to beat the McLarens,” Marko reveals quite optimistically after a question from Motorsport.com.\n\n**Can heat in Miami still make things difficult for Red Bull?**\n\nBefore that follows the race weekend in Florida, and that could be an interesting one. For example, Horner revealed that McLaren was in a class of its own in the heat. The gap in practice sessions was at times 1.2 seconds per lap, according to the Briton, which made him laugh: “On Friday we still thought McLaren would lap everyone!” In the evening sessions it was still hot, but Red Bull performed better than expected. That said, the sessions in Miami are run during the day and it can be quite hot in The Sunshine State.\n\nDoes Marko fear the next Grand Prix somewhat because of that? “Well, fortunately the race is not around lunch time and normally the sun sets, of course. We have to see how it goes there and if we can find more performance, but I normally think we can be competitive there as well.”\n\nTranslated with DeepL"", ""it's clear the redbull works well around high speed tracks with a smoother surface, Japan and Jeddah played to that, but China and Bahrain didn't. so we'll go to Miami and they'll likely struggle all over again"", 'Think that Miami will suck for them, Imola will be good despite the upgrades due to high speed corners, Monaco depends on qualifying, it’s that stretch from Spain-Netherlands which the upgrades all depend on. If they work, great. If not, that’s going to be a nightmare stretch for Red Bull.', 'This has to do with the nature of the track. Fast and fast corners, like Suzuka work good for the RB. Slow tracks and slow corners will set them back again.', ""We know Max is very good at putting that car in qualifying where it shouldn't necessarily be. If he can manage that throughout the season he will probably manage to out qualify the Mclarens more than once and allowing him to win races a few more times.\xa0\nLando and Oscar meanwhile are taking points away from each other which will be picked up by Max.\xa0\n\n\nThis is what we want as fans instead of Mclaren driving off into the sun each race.""]",1595,216,0.96,1595,4223,4223,17,1,0.0,17

They had great pace when they were in clean air as shown last race. Since this article is based and focused on what happened last race, where Ferrari had good racepace, it\'s obvious what they meant with the title.\n\nI know it\'s hard for some people, but read the article first and not just the title. The amount of people who can\'t read properly around here is astonishing', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> **The Saudi Arabian GP showed that if you drive in clean air, you can beat faster cars. That\'s why the battle was so fierce in Turn 1. And that\'s why the timing of the pit stops was all about finding the golden opportunity.**\n\n> The McLaren is a faster car than the Red Bull. And it treats its tires more gently. Nevertheless, Max Verstappen pulled away from his tail, Oscar Piastri, at the end of the first stint. The Ferrari is a slower car than the McLaren, Red Bull, and Mercedes. Nevertheless, Charles Leclerc occasionally set faster lap times than Verstappen and Piastri.\n\n> The secret lies in the position on the track. Those at the front of a pack benefit in two ways. They drive in clean air. This allows the aerodynamics to work optimally. According to the engineers, this is a bonus of at least two-tenths of a second. Those with other cars in front of them experience a worse airflow. The car begins to slide, the tires heat up, and lose grip more quickly.\n\n> Good cars can afford to stay behind for longer than bad ones. But even they get caught up eventually. For 15 laps, Oscar Piastri stayed within Max Verstappen\'s DRS zone. Then the leader took three-tenths of a second per lap off his pursuer. In the second stint, Piastri enjoyed the luxury of a clear run. Until he gradually closed the gap on his teammate, who was driving countercyclically on hard tires. At a distance of 2.5 seconds, Piastri suddenly felt understeer. By then, he was already driving in the turbulent air of Lando Norris.\n\n> **A Grand Prix with two races.**\nIn the fourth year of the ground-effect era, aerodynamics have practically reached their limits. Even small disturbances in the airflow can have major consequences. Therefore, it\'s more important than ever to avoid any cars in front of you. This makes the starting grid, the start, and the timing of pit stops even more important than ever.\n\n> In four of the five Grands Prix, the driver who had the lead after the first corner won the race. That would likely have been the case in Jeddah as well, had Verstappen not received a five-second penalty for defending his position at the start by cutting the first chicane.\n\n> So it was a two-race Grand Prix. Verstappen dominated the first, and Piastri dominated the second. The world champion reduced a 4.8-second deficit to 2.8 seconds, but Piastri only drove as fast as he had to. On the very last lap, he showed his pursuer who was boss in the ring with his personal fastest lap.\n\n> **Lots of risk in the first corner.**\nVerstappen and Piastri knew the first corner would be decisive. Therefore, both took high risks at the braking point. Verstappen\'s was greater because, according to overtaking regulations, the driver on the outside lane is always at a disadvantage. He needs a half-car-length lead at the apex to make the corner his own. For the driver on the inside, the same height is sufficient.\n\n> Overtaking was difficult despite three DRS zones. There were 32 position changes due to differing strategies. Those who didn\'t manage it right away damaged their tires. That\'s why it was so important for Piastri to overtake Lewis Hamilton as quickly as possible after his pit stop. He risked it in the DRS zone, weaving at high speed.\n\n> Drivers stuck in a pack have to drive tactically. It\'s better to leave a three-second gap and only open up at the end of the stint. When timing pit stops, it\'s becoming increasingly important for teams to find gaps in the field to make an undercut or overcut effective. Esteban Ocon gained six positions with his early pit stop in Bahrain, because he had a ten-second gap to the car in front where he fell.\n\n\n> **Overcut gives Leclerc a clear path.**\nIn Jeddah, Ferrari did everything right with the overcut of Charles Leclerc. The fifth-placed driver in the World Championship was within two to three seconds of George Russell in the first stint. Nevertheless, he complained of slight understeer caused by the turbulent air emanating from the Mercedes in front of him.\n\n> When all the drivers ahead of the Ferrari had turned into the pits, Leclerc was in the lead. And he suddenly set lap times that astonished both friend and foe. Leclerc, on ancient medium tires, was getting faster instead of slower. Between laps 21 and 28, he improved from 1:33.9 to 1:33.3. His new pursuers on fresh hard tires were barely faster. Leclerc held on until lap 29, creating a tire gap of ten laps to Piastri, nine to Russell, and eight to Verstappen.\n\n> More importantly, Leclerc had eight laps of clear air before entering George Russell\'s DRS zone. By then, the Mercedes driver had already hit the wall. He had overtaxed his tires while trying to follow the leaders. The front tires became so hot that they blistered. This made Russell easy prey for Leclerc and Norris.\n\n> **Hamilton weak, despite clear driving.**\nRussell couldn\'t even complain about traffic that caused his tires to give out so dramatically. ""The speed in the race was higher than we expected. And we set up the setup a bit too front-heavy,"" the strategists explained.\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli also struggled with hot tires, but to a lesser extent than Russell. In the second stint, the Italian benefited from having the track to himself from the 30th lap onwards. The previous duel with Isack Hadjar had cost rubber, but Antonelli then used the quiet period to give his tires a rest. It paid off. When Hamilton closed in from behind, he had an answer. There was still life in his tires.\n\n> The fifth round of the World Championship was also a sobering experience for Lewis Hamilton. The record winner was on his own for large stretches of the race and yet failed to benefit. He was simply too slow. His personal fastest lap placed him only in seventh place. Given the good conditions, he should have achieved more.\n\n> The Williams drivers were also well positioned in the field from their pit stop. Carlos Sainz and Alexander Albon only had to briefly contend with Esteban Ocon, who had already switched to hard tires during the safety car period. After that, the Williams drivers were able to build up speed unhindered, aiming to get into Isack Hadjar\'s pit stop window. They succeeded. After his late stop on lap 34, Hadjar was up against two Williams cars and was left with a hopeless battle, as one was giving the other DRS.\n\n> **Safety car as friend and foe.**\nLando Norris and Isaac Hadjar proved that bucking the trend and starting with harder tires was a good decision. This automatically brought them into clear air at some point. Norris had clear air for 32 laps, Hadjar for 21.\n\n> Had Norris not been outsmarted twice by Hamilton\'s DRS on the home straight, he would have had more time in reserve later in the duel with Leclerc. Hadjar frustrated Albon twice. In the first stint, he drove six laps into the Williams\' gearbox, and in the second, twelve. Neither of these actions was good for the tires.\n\n> Anyone who tries to gain a clear path with a different tire sequence is playing with fire. You can either hit the bull\'s eye or pull a blank. Ferrari tried it in Bahrain and was cheated by the safety car. From Ferrari\'s perspective, it came too early. Norris, Hadjar, Stroll, and Hülkenberg would have preferred a safety car after lap 23 in Jeddah. That would have given them a free pit stop.', 'This may be the least funny thread in the history of Reddit so far.', 'Dirty air really that bad this season?', ""Like Fred said, F1 is becoming a qualifying world championship, Max was the only pole sitter to lose across the last 5 (6 with the sprint) races they've had, and he only lost because of the T1 incident and penalty."", ""Clean air is king sure, but Charles (granted much fresher tyres) was still able to push along nicely even when in the dirty air of others.

1k5o2yl,The Red Bull is not the second fastest car,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k5o2yl/the_red_bull_is_not_the_second_fastest_car/,2025-04-23, Discussion,"I’ve seen a lot of discussion about where the true performance of the Red Bull is, but I seriously doubt it has been the overall second fastest car over the course of the first 5 races. The second Red Bull driver has scored 2 points this season. Considering Ollie Bearman was able to score 6 points in Jeddah last year in the Ferrari (clearly second fastest) with zero F1 experience, I don’t buy that the second Red Bull driver would be scoring 2 points In 5 races in the second fastest car regardless of how difficult the car is to drive. Of course someone will bring up the “car is built around Max” narrative but I don’t really buy that either. My points is this, Max is an anomaly and a generational talent, you can’t use him to gauge the true performance of the Red Bull. With that being said, the Red Bull isn’t a tractor either like some fans claim. The true performance of the car lies somewhere between Max and his teammates. I think the McLaren, Mercedes, and Ferrari all have better overall packages but that’s where the list ends for me. Let me know if you disagree, I’m very curious what everyone thinks. ","['The RB21 looks fast, but hard to tune... in the end of the day, consistency takes the title.', 'It really depends on how you define ""fastest"". If you mean potential peak performance it\'s clearly the best behind McLaren and on certain high speed tracks, possibly even a little bit better. Where things get muddled is it needs to be set up in a very narrow window where Max is able to extract that performance without cooking the tires or dealing with mid corner imbalance. If they can\'t it\'s right in the Ferrari/Mercedes fight. Mercedes look good because of George\'s consistency but it\'s clear the car lacks the pace to hang with the Red Bull most races. They can set it up to come close in qualifying like they did in Jeddah but that comes at the cost of a 30+s race pace deficit to the Red Bull. Ferrari are also struggling with a lack of pace and Charles like George is very consistent. It has a narrower window than the Mercedes but potentially a higher ceiling if they hit it. I discount the Red Bull 2nd driver for these sorts of comparisons. Lawson just isn\'t a top driver and Yuki while competent has only had <200 laps total in the RB21. You have to use Max as the benchmark for the car because there aren\'t any real datapoints other than him. He\'s possibly the greatest driver since Senna but not so much of an anomaly that you can conclude the RB21 is 4th quickest because he\'s with the McLarens when they set the car up well and with the Mercedes/Ferrari when they don\'t. Logically they\'re somewhere between the two cases.', 'here we go again.', ""Max is driving the car to the limit, not 'outdriving' it. You can't just magically give a car more downforce or less drag down the straights then it's design is capable of. It's a simple answer. Max at this point has been with Red Bull for almost 10 seasons and he's fully in sync with the team and the car. It has a very small performance window that he extracts every time because he's one of the best drivers the sport has ever seen and has been with the team for almost 10 years and knows the car inside out. 'Outdriving' a car is a term that should've died off years ago because it literally defies physics."", 'You can\'t outdrive the car though. I feel like one of the reasons Max performs so well is because he has the ability to control a car that\'s as fast but sensitive as the RBR and drive it to its limit, not because he has the magical ability to unlock extra speed from it.\n\n\nSaying that the ""true"" performance of the RBR is between what Max can extract from it vs other drivers\' is just questionable, it\'s more realistic to think of Max being the closest to unlock its maximum potential.\n\n\nOther drivers say that they can be comfortable with the RBR, but when they\'re in their comfort zone it\'s quite slow. They start getting into trouble when they push themselves to reach Max\'s speed, they start crashing and it just utterly ruins their confidence.', 'You cannot out drive a car. Thats the end of it. You cannot drive a car in a way that reduces drag or gets more downforce than it otherwise would. The only thing you can do is get the optimal performance from it and Max is able to do so.\n\nThe Red Bull is the second fastest car and max is crazy consistent but it’s probably the 4th best car in general. Not 4th fastest but best. Taking into concern the way it drives it’s a 2012 Ferrari and Max is pulling an Alonso.', ""I don't understand the rationale here.  \n\nA car's maximum speed around a circuit is not determined by the person behind the wheel.  That's inherent in the build, the design, the conditions.  \n\nThe guy behind the wheel is the one who has to coax the potential performance into actual performance.  \n\nBased on results this season - Red Bull does have the 2nd fastest car.  \n\nMax is able to get more out of the Red Bull than Yuki can.  \n\nOscar seems better able to get the most out of the Mclaren than Lando can.  \n\n  \nI think  you're confusing the window and driveability with 'fastest'."", 'For goodness sake. This has been discussed relentlessly already, but you are trying to frame things so that you can put Max down as being this superhuman driver. Let’s clear this up.\n\nTo begin: Max is the best driver on the grid in terms of balancing overall speed, consistency and lack of mistakes. He is not the best when it comes to wheel-to-wheel racing, and I don’t think that can be disputed.\n\nHe has a very unique driving style where he likes it on a knife’s edge. The Red Bull has been gradually built to suit this specific driving style and this alone. No other driver on the grid can get what he gets out of the Red Bull - they would simply lose the back end of the car over and over again\n\nNow, this doesn’t mean the Red Bull is slow or that Max is significantly better than the other drivers. Every driver has their own style, and some of them get cars that support that style, and some don’t. Because of this fact, you can assume that Piastri is getting the most out of the McLaren because it is more suited to his driving style, and there is nothing to suggest Max would be able to get more out of it - because it is not designed to suit his driving style\n\nPlease just look back to the times where Perez was occasionally beating Max in races and in qualifying to get an indication of what is going on. If what you are saying is true then Max would have consistently significantly outperformed Perez as he would be able to use his superhuman powers to extract even more from the car', ""max isnt driving the car outside of its potential, that's not how physics works.""]",0,110,0.32,0,97,97,0,11,-0.010000000000000009,0
