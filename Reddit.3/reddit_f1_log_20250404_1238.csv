/edit: This is not about any one team, car or driver. More on the the pros/cons of the weigh in timing. I'm not defending or attacking anyone in particular.

1jr6xff,Is it justified if Alpine get rid of Doohan early?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jr6xff/is_it_justified_if_alpine_get_rid_of_doohan_early/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"So going into the season there were a lot of rumours that Alpine would replace Doohan after about five races. And those rumours were fuelled by Alpine signing Colapinto and 3 other reserve drivers. They also never publicly said that Doohan would stay even if he performed well.

Many fans, understandably, were outraged and felt for Jack. He had barely driven an F1 car and there were already rumours that he would be out the door after the flyaway races that kickstart the season. 
His crash this morning have sparked more even discussions about this and I've seen people discussing weather Alpine should replace him. 

So let's go through his season so far and see what we make of it. 

In testing, Doohan performed well enough. He was close enough to Gasly and actually set a faster time on day 2. 

In Australia it actually got off to a decent start and thoigh he went out in Q2 there was a feeling he had the pace to go faster but was impeded by yellow flags after the Hamilton spin. 
So He would start P14, 5 places off Gasly. 

However come race day it was all over in 5 corners after he spun off as they left sector one on the opening lap. Many other drivers did crash that day so you have to give him some forgiveness but I feel as though this video https://youtu.be/d_6DFoHWBC0 shows the difference between a good talent and a great talent. 

In China Alpine seemed hardest hit by the new rear wing directive and Doohan was P16 in SQ1. But he was ahead of Gasly which went a little under the radar but was very impressive. 
 
The sprint itself though, was a bad one for Jack. While Gasly worked his way up to P12, Doohan spent the  whole race battling with the Sauber's before making a silly lunge down the inside on tub last lap and crashing into Bortoleto, spinning him around. For this Doohan got a penalty that didn't change his P20. 

In the main qualifying session he was out in Q1 in P18. To be fair, he was only a tenth off Gasly. 

And for the first time we got to see his comparison to Gasly over a race distance and... it was fairly impressive. On lap 33 he was only a few seconds off Gasly. From then on he was battling with the late stoppers Bearman and Stroll as well as the two stoppers of the Racing Bulls. 

They had much fresher tyres but Doohan fought hard, though he picked up a penalty for forcing Hadjar off. He still held Hadjar off for the remainder of the race but the penalty dropped him a couple of places. But finishing ten seconds off of am experienced midfield driver like Gasly in his first race distance is actually pretty commendable and why I think he should be given a bit longer. 

Yes his crash today was big, and the main argument for replacikg him is that crashes like the ones he's having will cost the team valuable momey they could use for development in this era of the cost cap. 

But if Doohan stops crashing so much and just cuts out the small errors I think he deserves to stay because he does have that raw speed in him. He has outqualified Gasly in one out of three quails and gotten close in the other two. Gasly is one of the stronger qualifiers on the grid and it's no mean feat to be that close. 

Admittedly Australia and China are two of Gasly's worst tracks but if we get to Bahrain and the gap is still small then Doohan deserves the time. Also Doohan isnt that familiar with these tracks either. When we get to more of the circuits he drove in F3 and F2 let's see what he can do. 

In F1 what often seperates rookies is their raw pace. A driver like a young Max Verstappen who is fast but crahses a lot is actually much more impressive than a rookie driver like Sergey Sirotkin, who doenst really crash, but also doenst show any speed. 

I think the reason Jack is crashing is all the pressure Alpine have put him under to perform or get fired. He's pushing the car too much amd crashing due to that. If he continues to have an incident per race yes he should be home by the summer but I think he has shown enough raw pace to be kept on until at least the summer break and if he is very good at the tracks he's more familiar with he should be kept on for 2026. 

TLDR - He's shown enough raw pace to deserve to keep his seat.

But I think he'll get it out of his system: he's a rookie.\n\nThat said, Alpine and Briatore could literally do anything and nobody would be surprised.

Crash in Australia, crash in SQ1 in China with penalty points and a bad race in China, he only held off Hadjar cause it was very difficult to overtake in that race and even then he only managed due to illegal defence. All the crashes were his fault including the one today. So yeah, it's not good.

There's been a lot of talk about what is expected of Yuki as to how close he needs to get to Max, but how much would be upset if he beats him by a couple of tenths or destroys him by half a second or more? Liam's career would be over. Perez apologists would have to quieten down. Horner pressure dies down. Max loses negotiation power and ends up retiring. And so on, this is the little domino from the meme could end with something strange like Ferrari doing a great strategy or Alonso WDC in the Red Bull.

Edit: I have no preferences for either scenario, just think there are (somewhat unlikely) things that haven't been talked about and wondered what people's thought were.
