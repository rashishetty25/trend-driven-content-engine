1k0yqbd,Explanation of Aerodynamics in F1 Cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k0yqbd/explanation_of_aerodynamics_in_f1_cars/,2025-04-16, Discussion,"Hi - I am an aerospace engineer with almost 2 decades of experience in rocket engines, missile systems, and aircraft. I have never worked on formula 1 cars, or any car for that matter. However, I know aerodynamics and the core principles remain the same across applications.

In these first few weeks of the season, I have seen a lot of talk about the Red Bull car in particular. In a lot of these discussions (including articles from journalists...) people seem to falsely equate how hard the car is to drive with it's speed. What I hope people take away from this post is that a car that is hard to drive can still be very fast. In fact, a worse ""window"" can actually make a car faster when inside that window (speaking purely in terms of aerodynamics).

As a side note, this is not about drivers. There is no question that Max is amazing. There is also no debate that the McLaren is fast, but I do think that some people are underestimating how fast the Red Bull actually is just because it is hard to drive.

So into the explanation (trying to make it ELI5):

Let's start with airfoils - airfoils are one of the main ways to create aerodynamic structures. Airfoils are a 2D shape that look like a tear drop - if you look at an aircraft wing, it is an airfoil that is extruded to 3D. 

Camber is the degree to which the airfoil is bent. Typically, if you camber an airfoil more the lift/downforce will increase, but so will the drag. Think about holding your hand out of the window while driving - a flat hand has no camber and a cupped hand is more cambered. You can also do a lot with how ""sensitive"" an airfoil is - meaning, there are some airfoils that are ""twitchy"" when it hits a gust of air (colloquially referred to as turbulence). In something like a commercial jet, they design their airfoils to be very stable - this makes them easier to fly safely, less prone to ""turbulence"", etc. The downside is that these more stable airfoils are very slow for maneuvering by design. So in contrast, they design combat aircraft (e.g. F-15)) with much more unstable, but also much more responsive aero surfaces. Engineers put a lot of time into optimizing these aero surfaces to be both responsive and stable, but it is always a trade off on some level.

The other important concept for people to understand is stall. Ideally you want air to ""stick"" to your airfoil, so you generate maximum lift with minimal drag - however when you angle the airfoil (say turn an F1 car) you increase the amount of flow that starts to separate - which if it gets bad enough is called ""stall"" and the surface loses most of it's lift (or downforce in F1 terms). Similar to the camber, some airfoil designs can be more sensitive to stall, but typically these have the lowest drag in ideal conditions.

In an F1 car you have literally thousands of individual aerodynamics surfaces. Not all of them are airfoils, but  they all follow the same principles. Engineers need to balance drag, downforce, responsiveness, and risk of stall on each surface in a variety of speeds, turns, temperatures, winds, etc.  Not to mention how suspension, stiffness, dirty air, etc. can also impact aerodynamic performance. Unfortunately, if you increase downforce (all else being equal) you also increase drag. If you lower drag to go faster you can cause some surfaces to stall in a corner. If you are quickest in clean air, it's possible you are compromising your speed in dirty air (think the McLaren in Japan).

I think if you read this far, the issues with Red Bull's car are pretty obvious. It has a very narrow window of conditions where it has optimal aerodynamics. They clearly have gotten ""spoiled"" by having a driver like Max who can consistently keep it in the proper window for peak performance - and thus have gradually opted for a faster car rather than a car that is easy to drive. Unfortunately, even if Max drives perfectly there are things outside of his control like temperatures, track layout, wind, etc. I do think that when the Red Bull is in the window, it is probably faster than the McLaren, but that window is a lot smaller than McLaren's so you rarely if ever get to see it. 

Of course McLaren could have discovered some kind of black magic that allows them to be the fastest, most responsive, and easiest to drive all in one package. It is possible, but in my opinion based on the races so far, it is more likely that they just struck a better balance between those various factors that provides better performance across the all of the tracks. And I would wager that, that McLaren is also quite hard to drive even if it is not as bad as the Red Bull.","['r/F1technical would probably enjoy this write-up as well', ""Your point about stability in clean air vs. dirty air is a really good one, and of the things that is overlooked the most in my opinion. Everyone knows that dirty air is a thing, but it's often underestimated how important it is and how the magnitude of the impact varies with the car design.\n\nIt's one of the things that irked me about all the Lando vs. Oscar comparisons last year. Was Lando really so much faster in Zandvoort and Singapore, or was it just the benefit of clean air? Was Oscar really faster in Spa and Hungary? The McLaren seems particularly sensitive in this regard. I remember in one of the last races in the year (I forget which one), Lando had great pace, until he reached the backmarkers and commented on how much harder it was in dirty air.\n\nIt makes it very difficult to get an honest gauge comparative pace sometimes. It's all part of the fun, but the engineer in me desperately wants every driver to drive every car at every track in every condition, purely so I can scratch the itch of having a proper dataset."", 'I was thinking about a lot of this myself, but it‚Äôs nice to hear a more professional perspective on the matter. And indeed there is overlap between a hard to drive car, and a fast car. One does not exclude the other.\n\nOn your end conclusion though‚Ä¶ I mean, we‚Äôll see how it turns out, but I do not believe Red Bull are in this without significant (and correct, can‚Äôt be understated) upgrades, either for the actual speed of the car, or the capability of setting it up correctly. In that regard they are behind and/or too dependent on outside conditions, which is also part of the game. Can‚Äôt build a car that only works when it‚Äôs rainbows amd sunshine.\n\nGreat technical insight though, loved the read!', 'so basically people misconstrued speed and cornering', 'https://preview.redd.it/hcn1ga9efave1.jpeg?width=552&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2900abaa3638975d4b1f6459bcc991326dccee28', '![gif](giphy|JohcFDGT1HwBdcb0w2|downsized)', "">Of course McLaren could have discovered some kind of black magic that allows them to be the fastest, most responsive, and easiest to drive all in one package.

And I would wager that, that McLaren is also quite hard to drive even if it is not as bad as the Red Bull.\n\nThere's more to car handling than aerodynamics.  It's already known what is making the McLaren so fast -- they're running a more radical anti-dive angle on the front suspension than other teams are, which makes them more stable under braking, which has a wide variety of benefits.  Other teams are afraid to copy this because apparently the anti-dive angle that McLaren is running is more structurally fragile -- it's apparently seen by the other teams on the grid as a bold and risky move, which is not what you usually do in the last year of a regulation cycle."", 'I‚Äôm having a hard time following the discussion of a ‚Äústable airfoil‚Äù.  While there are angular moments resulting from lift generation this pales in comparison the resulting moments from other primary control surfaces (horizontal tail/canards, etc) in creating stable responses to disturbances. A key difference being that these are purely aerodynamic effects in airplanes but are tied more to physical structure (how the wing is connected to the body, suspension, and eventually the ground) of automobiles.  Any change in this relationship is solely due to aero elasticity.   The F-15 is also a remarkably stable aircraft it just has tons of pitch authority due to absolute units on a horizontal stab.  The wing has camber optimized for an elliptical lift profile at a wide variety of angles of attack while also being remarkably efficient at area ruling for supersonic flight.  Not bad for 1960s slide rule toting engineers!', ""[*...this bit here is what Adrian Newey sees in his mind's eye when he's on the drawing board...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlDnd3B1rhs&ab_channel=wickedender)""]",326,44,0.92,326,191,191,9,4,0.0,9

Let me preface this by saying I do not understand cars. I am not very car literate but I love F1, and although I understand the basics I‚Äôm really keen to learn allllll of it (more so bc my little boy is asking me questions I can‚Äôt answer). 
So, the new regs - Can someone explain how they will manage to use electric and fuel? Won‚Äôt they run out of battery? I know there‚Äôs Formula E, but I don‚Äôt really understand how that works either üò© Will this completely change F1 as we know it? 
Sorry for the stupid questions, and sorry if they have been explained before!!! 
Also, does anyone have recommendations for some good youtubers to help me learn? I have, so far, watched Mr V‚Äôs garage and Chainbear! TIA. ","[""If you have a car with just a petrol engine, a significant share of the energy is lost whenever it slows down. It makes the brakes hot, that energy then goes to the atmosphere.\xa0\n\n\nFormula 1 cars have a small power generator on their wheels that can slow the car down by charging a battery, using the rotation of the wheels.\xa0\n\n\nWhen they say 50:50 power, they mean it will recover enough energy that 50% of the power delivered to the wheels was collected from the braking system.\xa0\n\n\nTo give an example of how this is possible, when driving on urban roads (so lots of stop and start) my cheap and cheerful EV manages to recover 1kWh for every 2kWh of power consumption from the battery.\xa0\n\n\nIf F1 cars were driving on an oval circuit as is used for Indy500 they would struggle to run in this configuration, as there isn't enough braking to generate the power. However on most F1 tracks the cars are only on full power about 60% of the time, and the longest straight is about 2km, so there will be possibility to keep recharging and then deploying the power.\n\n\nIt is going to be interesting to see how this works out. It's a step forward in tech - yes my car can achieve 50% energy recovery but at much lower speeds. But obviously they can spend far more on a battery and recovery system than I can.\xa0\n\n\nThere have been some suggestions that drivers will struggle to harvest enough energy, and it's absolutely possible that at least just early years on long straights some cars run out of electrical power before the end and lose significant speed vs their rivals."", 'The cars will have more bzt bzt and less vroom vroom.\n\nI hope this helps.', ""It won't be a direct 50:50 power split - the MGU-K is limited to 350kw and ICE with turbos will produce whatever it will produce (rumoured anywhere between 400 and 470kw, depending on PU manufacturers).  \n  \nThe regeneration per lap and deployment per lap has been increased, meaning similarly to 2014, where MGU-K was able to deploy for around 30s per lap, the new regen capacity and increased deployment would allow something similar (guestimate of 25-30s per lap).  \n  \nMain issues will be on circuit with less braking or long straights like Monza, Spa, Las Vegas & Baku as an example, where they can run out of battery on straights, but regen enough after the long straight to have fresh electric deployment available after the corner.  \nBut we also haven't seen the X and Z modes of the cars, so it's possible the reduced drag mode and high drag mode in corners allows them to regenerate enough power for long straights."", 'Chainbear almost certainly has a video on this subject already. If he doesnt he will before next season. He probably has the best tech F1 channel.\n\nBut I\'ll nevertheless have a crack.\n\nIn the current regulation the battery provides approx 25% of power. On top of that there are 2 methods to regenerate electricity to charge the battery. Kinetic energy from brakes and engine and heat from the engine. With this combination, and after 11 years of development, its pretty straight forward for cars + drivers now to reliably regenerate battery energy so they can consistently push when they need. Unless a driver makes a mistake in how they deploy their energy, its rare to see a major offset in power.\n\nNext year the battery contribution doubles and they LOSE the MGUH. So regeneration is heavily compromised, while also relying even more on battery. This makes the delta in performance when someone is low on energy EXTREMELY significant. Furthermore, certain tracks do not have enough significant ""regeneration events"" (aka braking) to charge the batter enough. This will result in bizarre scenarios where cars start slowing down on the straight significantly as air resistance starts to overwhelm the power being put out by the power unit.', 'Eli5?\n\nhalf the car goes vroom vroom\n\nhalf the car goes whoosh whoosh', 'Combustion engine makes 400 horse power. 50%\n\nBattery system makes 400 horse power. 50%\n\n400 + 400 = 100%\n\n50/50 split.', 'Let‚Äôs say that the current engine have an 80/20 split. There are two batteries that recover energy, alongside a traditional internal combustion engine. \n\nWhat they‚Äôre doing now is making one single large battery a bigger size, and kinda making the normal engine a little ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù. \n\nOn paper it will be a 50/50 split with more horsepower, in the new engine. However the current rumor is that the engine isn‚Äôt more powerful and has created new problems. This is all rumor and hearsay because no one knows anything without actually seeing the cars in track. \n\nThere are a lot of road cars that are hybrids, f1 cars now are hybrid. The battery is rechargeable, so even if they run out, that can charge it like they already do. Will it change f1? Yes, that‚Äôs the point. \nThe sport of called formula 1, because they‚Äôre constantly changing the rules. Every few years the rules are changed, or tweaked, for a number of different reasons. This was all to make the sport cheaper and more attractive to new teams and engine manufacturers. Plus to make the racing better. We‚Äôll see if any of that better racing happens.

From what I heard, it seems that this aero regulations that was built to create close racing was corrupted slowly over the years, through upgrades that shouldn't have been allowed but that were allowed anyway like the front wing upgrade (from 2023/2024 Mercedes I think?) that was creating vortex, i.e. dirty air.\n\nAnd now here we are : every single driver complained about dirty air in Japan and not being able to chase even slightly close the driver in front of them. I am afraid that we are at a point of no return, where there is just too much dirty air to deal with.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the tyre issue, the ultra domination of the 1 stop strategy AND the seemingly constant resurfacing of all tracks making degradation non existant are making everything worse.\n\nI pray that I am wrong and that this year will be the best of this era regulations in terms of racing. \n\nBut beside all of that : What are your thoughts on the matter? Do you think the dirty air problem will not be that much of an issue this year? Or do you think the problem stems from somewhere else?"", 'Is Max leaving for Aston Martin?.\n\nhttps://www.gazzetta.it/motori/red-bull-racing/17-04-2025/verstappen-lascia-la-red-bull-f1-aston-martin-in-vantaggio.shtml?refresh_ce', 'When Mercedes first entered their period of dominance from 2014-2016, there was pretty much nobody who could challenge them (Vettel aside, and even he was severely disadvantaged by not being in a Merc).\n\nThis means that the only guy who could challenge Lewis Hamilton was his teammate, Nico Rosberg. They were called Brocedes because the two were ""bros"" - they came up through karting and junior racing together, and were good friends. \n\nThey also had very different upbringings; Rosberg had a WDC-winning dad, had a rich family, had connections while Hamilton was middle-class, his dad had to work two jobs to put him through junior racing, and he had to overcome institutional bias to achieve the historical feat of being the first Black driver in F1.\n\nThis meant that inevitably, when both of them became each other\'s biggest rival, there was a lot of hostility and a sense of betrayal from both sides, and lots of leveraging to try and get Mercedes to back them. Hence the fallout. It was basically the modern day version of Senna vs. Prost.']",8,36,0.76,8,34,34,0,4,-0.07999999999999996,0
1k0kdyl,Do you think Lawson will last the season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k0kdyl/do_you_think_lawson_will_last_the_season/,2025-04-16, Discussion,"Since being dropped by Red Bull, he is performing far worse than he was last year. I‚Äôm concerned for him, he‚Äôs been terrible in every race this year.

In Japan, he qualified P14 against Hadjar‚Äôs P7, and in the race finished 50 seconds behind Hadjar, P8 vs P17. This weekend, he qualified 0.5 seconds behind Hadjar and caused two crashes. 

Do you guys see Lawson lasting the season? Or will they drop him before the summer to throw in another Red Bull Rookie?","['He‚Äôll last the year, but if he doesn‚Äôt improve it‚Äôll be his only year.', ""This discourse is kind of sad for Lawson because Hadjar has seen some decent promise but it's only just the beginning. He did well last year all things considered so I expect him to just hold out for a while unless Red Bull decides to pull a swift one on him again."", ""As much as I wanna support the guy after the whole RB drama, and him saying Japan is something he's familiar with and also him driving the vcarb majority of last year, I don't see much coming from him\n\nHadjar has been on a better trajectory in just 4 races. Even Yuki did better in just 2 weekends in that RB"", 'I think so but I‚Äôm not sure if he will stay next year. It will depend on what happened to Max and Yuki as well as how Lindblad finishes his F2 season (at the moment he isn‚Äôt being impressive).', ""Hopefully - he has his good moments, but I think his confidence had been shot to pieces, and he's trying too hard. I think he will improve with time, and he has the benefit of this season's VCARB being quite a good car.\n\nPlus, dropping Liam right now would not paint RB in the best light."", 'Yeah I think so. Might even get a 2nd unless they\'re all in Lindblad.\n\nHe\'s started the season badly. But hes been thrown into 2 new cars with poor prep and then had the media, fans and his own team knock him.\n\nI mean people used anything to criticise him even ""I\'m not here to make friends"" which is such a milquetoast statement that almost every driver has said. People bringing that up just feels like they\'re looking for reasons to hate him after he replaced some very popular drivers.\n\nHe was damn good last year though with basically no prep, he had some excellent race craft and even though he was inconsistent, he did put together really good laps. Q1 in his first race last season he put in an excellent lap that got the 8th or 9th fastest car on the grid p9 but then had the engine penalty so had to give Yuki a tow in Q2.\n\nIt\'d be an unbelievably cruel and unfair career to continue to demote him without ever giving him a decent amount of time. Even Logan got a season and a half in the same team. \n\nMaybe he doesn\'t have it. But I think we should judge him at season\'s end not from these 4 weekends. He hasn\'t hooked it up yet but he\'s talented and I think it would be understandable if he needs a couple of weeks to reset.\n\nHe might just be bad, but the circumstances haven\'t given him a fair crack of the whip', ""there are so many people in red bull's junior programs that are frothing at the mouth at the idea of even stepping into an f1 car\n\nwe've seen how ruthless red bull is, time and time again. and lawson doesn't have the personable attitude of ricciardo, he's really milquetoast. he has nothing going for him other than the ability to drive an f1 car. if he doesn't showcase that ability, then yes, he will be dropped.\n\nin f1, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when."", ""He's proven he can drive the VCARB, and they promoted him to RBR, so they clearly have faith in him.\n\nHowever, they also had faith in Nyck de Vries, and it only took 10 races before they kicked him to the kerb. \n\nThen there's all the careers of other drivers they butchered at both teams.\n\nWith Red Bull's driver program, you just never know. It feels like everyone other than Verstappen is basically there on the whim of Marko and Horner, and whether they stay is down to what side of the bed they get out of mid-season."", ""Unless he royally screws up even harder than he has so far, yes.\n\nAs bad as he's performed this year, I think he has earned a little grace and leeway with getting kicked around this season. His confidence is shot at the moment, and everyone knows he can drive better than he's shown. He has time to get it together before the pressure starts to mount.\n\nI don't think they're chomping at the bit to get Iwasa or Lindblad in the car until next year. They might decide to make a move if Lawson is still screwing it deep into the season however.""]",0,177,0.46,0,842,842,0,0,0.0,0
