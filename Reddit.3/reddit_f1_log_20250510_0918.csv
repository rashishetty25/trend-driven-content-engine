Love that.', 'It doesn’t help also with that jet account tracking him lol . Showed his plane landed in Germany so anyone guessing could figure it out', ""English translation:\n______________\n\n**Secret GT3 test on the Nordschleife**  \n\nMax Verstappen took part in the official NLS test and set-up runs on Friday (9 May) in a Ferrari 296 GT3. The spectacular Nordschleife test was actually supposed to remain secret. Nevertheless, we were able to take a few exclusive pictures of the drive. And we reveal what the Formula 1 star's future plans are.\n\nAs we all know, Max Verstappen can't get enough of racing. In addition to his Grand Prix appointments, the Formula 1 world champion trains every minute in his home simulator. The Dutchman also runs his own GT3 team, which competes in the GT World Challenge (GTWC). The racing team owner regularly gets behind the wheel himself during private test drives to tinker with the set-up.\n\nThese test drives normally take place behind closed doors on privately rented racetracks, mainly in southern Europe. But now Verstappen has surprisingly dared to come out of hiding. As part of the official test and set-up runs ahead of the third NLS race, the Formula 1 star completed a few laps of the Nordschleife in his 600 hp Ferrari 296 GT3 on Friday (9 May).\n\nThe Italian racing flounder was looked after by Emil Frey Racing during the Eifel event. The Swiss racing team is entering the 296 GT3 in the DTM and GTWC this season. Thierry Vermeulen, the son of Verstappen manager Raymond Vermeulen, normally sits in the cockpit for the experienced GT3 team.\n\n**Verstappen drives under a pseudonym**  \nVerstappen's trip to the Eifel was actually supposed to remain a secret. That is why the driver did not drive under his own name, but under a pseudonym. The most successful racing driver of recent years competed as ‘Franz Hermann’. This name was also stuck on the outside of the Ferrari - next to the Dutch flag. However, because his real name was printed on his helmet and racing overall, it quickly became clear who was really in the car.\n\nVerstappen probably just wanted to enjoy a few laps of the world's most spectacular racetrack in peace and quiet. To avoid being harassed, the new father of a family had his own security staff shield him during his test drive. External photographers were not allowed into the garage.\n\n**Further Nordschleife appearances planned**  \nIt was already known that Verstappen is a big fan of the Nordschleife. The four-time F1 champion had already successfully participated in virtual racing events in the digital NLS (DNLS) on several occasions. However, the simulator events are apparently no longer enough for the Red Bull driver. In future, he will probably be travelling to the Eifel in person more often.\n\nAccording to information from auto motor und sport, Verstappen is reportedly planning to obtain the so-called Nordschleife permit this year. This special racing licence is required to take part in official NLS events and the legendary 24-hour race at the Nürburgring.\n\nDuring a winner's interview at a DNLS event last year, the racing driver had already expressed his interest in real racing: ‘The Nürburgring Nordschleife is one of my absolute favourite race tracks and I hope that in a few years I will also be able to compete here in a real GT3.’"", 'It would be an absolute blast seeing him at the 24h race.', 'Verstappen: I’m gonna incognito this shit.\n\nAlso Verstappen:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipgnyd5g8qze1.jpeg?width=1169&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a086bd36a940c569bf898130c505bef2632305c']",7814,443,0.96,7814,24055,24055,45,0,0.0,45

The doubts about how someone can create a considerable advantage over the competition also lead to thinking about solutions that are within the famous grey areas and that perhaps even go beyond in some cases, even more so if that advantage is found in the last year of regulations. \n\n> In this sense,\xa0the McLaren MCL39 is surprising everyone with its dominant performances and rivals are wondering about the nature of this advantage\xa0. Toto Wolff takes his hat off and applauds his customer team.\xa0“Pointing the finger at something illegal is not right. I know the integrity of Stella, Brown, Marshall and those who work in Woking. \n\n> They are just doing a better job than us”\xa0said the Mercedes CEO & Team Principal. Compliments that also come, at least publicly, from Christian Horner (Red Bull) who however behind the scenes has tried to\xa0uncover more than any other team the or even worse the secrets\xa0of the papaya team.\n\n> **Tyre management is McLaren\'s winning ace: the \'secret\' also lies in the brake drums.**\nAnalyzing this start to the season, it has been seen that the peak performance of McLaren is superior but not unattainable for the other teams.\xa0On certain circuits\xa0, the fastest,\xa0and/or in certain conditions\xa0, think of when it is colder,\xa0the MCL39 can be beatable\xa0or in any case the gap is significantly reduced. \n\n> Furthermore,\xa0the Papaya single-seater\xa0encounters the greatest \'difficulties\' in qualifying, which leads Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to make too many mistakes on Saturday.\xa0""Now we have enough data to confirm that\xa0our car is easier to drive in race trim than in qualifying\xa0. So far we have not done a perfect qualifying lap, even if Oscar\'s lap in Bahrain came very close,""\xa0said Andrea Stella. It turns out that above all Mercedes and Red Bull have managed to get closer and even beat the times of the two Papaya standard-bearers in the fastest lap.\n\n>\xa0What makes a significant difference with all the other teams is the MCL39\'s ability to manage the tyres in the most difficult conditions.\xa0In the rain of Melbourne and Miami we saw the difference they can make with the Intermediates, tyres that tend to overheat a lot as the track dries and the tread becomes smooth. This allowed the orange duo to have a pace that was clearly better than everyone else, zero overheating and therefore zero degradation with unmatched consistency in performance. \n\n> The same thing happens, unfortunately for the others, even in dry asphalt conditions.\xa0""When it\'s cold they win with a 10 second advantage, when it\'s hot with 30, today even 37""\xa0said George Russell in the post-race in Miami\xa0. The MCL39 in fact excels on those circuits where a perfect balance between slow and fast is important and above all where it is necessary to know how to manage the tyres very well, that is when the thermal degradation of the rear axle (overheating) is crucial as in Bahrain but also in Miami.\n\n> Since last season, suspicions have been raised at Red Bull about the use of possible \'tricks\' in the wheel corner area. The Milton Keynes technicians have asked the FIA \u200b\u200bfor information regarding\xa0a possible use of infinitesimal quantities of water to manage temperatures\xa0, a technique that they know well in Milton Keynes, and that Rob Marshall believes could have brought to Woking. \n\n> However, both Pirelli and the FIA \u200b\u200bhave never found any evidence to support the thesis of Horner\'s men. Until the study of that macro area of \u200b\u200bthe MCL39 with special thermal cameras, as anticipated by AMuS, which showed\xa0""a strange temperature profile, certainly very different from ours and also from those of our other competitors""\xa0a top technician from the Milton Keynes team told us. It is therefore not surprising that, on both orange-coloured cars, the tyres are practically always in the perfect range of use, above all they do not overheat when environmental and track factors require it.\xa0\n\n> The suspicion, now become certainty for all direct competitors, is that the team led by Andrea Stella has found the perfect way through the cooling system to let air in to cool the brakes but also to not overheat the tires too much, thus trying to have the right temperature to trigger them and guarantee peak grip in a larger window of \'external\' temperatures.\xa0A very delicate balance obtained through what Andrea Stella calls the\xa0dark art\xa0of this F1.\xa0""It is clear that in the race, when we have to deal with tire wear in hot conditions, our car behaves very well. I would like to underline that this is the result of very specific engineering work by our team,\xa0"" said the engineer from Abruzzo.\n\n> In short, not only in terms of aeroelasticity but also in the area of \u200b\u200bthe wheel corners, more precisely inside the baskets, that\xa0McLaren makes an important difference to all the other teams\xa0, thanks to some very advanced technical solutions designed by the team led by Rob Marshall, a former leading engineer at Red Bull. \n\n> The brake baskets that we usually see covering the entire braking system have a standard design on the outside, but underneath it the teams have a lot of freedom in the design and often look for significant aerodynamic gains and above all cooling, even if for this season McLaren has significantly raised the technical bar also in that macro area.\xa0\n\n> It is therefore no coincidence that all three top teams are working hard in that area to bring developments in the very short and short term.\xa0Right in Milton Keynes,\xa0as we have already had the opportunity to report\xa0, they are working on trying to replicate what McLaren believe they can do, with sensitive parts that could already see the track in one of the next races even if Verstappen was very vague in Miami about it.\xa0“We are doing our best to solve this problem. But some things take more time,\xa0even to understand them thoroughly\xa0. Then producing them is a whole other story”.\n\n>\xa0The same goes for Mercedes and Ferrari, although the latter has more of a problem with lighting the tyres and less with not overheating them. In Brackley they clearly admitted with the words of James Allison, who spoke about the purpose of the updates that will arrive in the first part of the summer season.\xa0“The main aspect on which we have concentrated is keeping the temperature of the tyres under control, a crucial aspect to allow the car to exploit the pace it has available”\xa0said the former Ferrari, now in charge of the technical office of the Brackley team.', 'Yeah no shit Sherlock', ""Didn't most teams massively copy Red Bull when they where so dominant?

1kj5t2q,McLaren's Brake (phase changing) Context,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kj5t2q/mclarens_brake_phase_changing_context/,2025-05-10, Discussion,"The videos on phase changing materials are complex and I see many people disregarding it because it seems far-fetched as the discussion has an air of ""ground breaking technology"" which attracts valid scepticism. But there is a more ""simple"" side to it which relates to Red Bull's rumoured ""water in the tyres"" claim. It might not be as unlikely as you think. 

Whether they are using a solid or not in F1, phase changing cooling has been a staple in mobile/small devices for decades as it is basically the only way to efficiently cool such a small device without a pump. If youre using a phone or laptop right now, you are using a phase changing coolant system. Heat pipes or vapor chambers in your device transition water into gas, then back into water when the temp drops. If you've ever had a hot laptop on your lap, its fighting for life to keep the temperature below 100 degrees by constantly changing state. Similar to how an engine circulates coolant to a radiator, except this is pumped so there is no need to rely on a state change to circulate the coolant. 

If a team suspects brakes have heat pipes to regulate brake and tyre temp, a state change and liquid is involved for circulation, hence the water rumour. The high temperatures involved mean they could be using a solid to liquid change as the videos discuss, or it could be a high temp liquid.

The point is that while it is an innovative motorsport idea, its not a scientific breakthrough. Which imo makes it more believable.","['Liquid cooling is strictly prehibited in any form for the brakes though, and the FIA wouldn’t have cleared it if that was the case.\n\nSSPCMs (shape stabilized phase changing materials), are a more likely candidate, but they are not as effective for this use case.\n\nThere’s also a lot of regulatory constrains in the form of legality boxes around the drums, which make the implementation really difficult.\n\nIt’s s cool idea definitely, and could end up being what they’re doing, but its far from being conclusively proven.', ""It's a good theory, but I'm apprehensive about it.

If you could change the outcome of a WDC, which one(s) would you change?

For background - F1 fan since the 90s, never really been a fan of one driver or team. I'm British so there's always a bit of bias there, but not always - I was gunning for Hakkinen over Coulthard in the late 90s for example. But I mention this to say the purpose should try to stay away from ""I like this driver and cannot have my view changed, and I treat F1 like I'm a football fan""

  
So -

2008 - Massa instead of Hamilton. 

Massa drove brilliantly all season, as did Lewis. Again, as a Brit I was somewhat gunning for Lewis, but in hindsight Massa would have made for a better story. If it wasn't for that pit-stop disaster in Singapore he'd have won it anyway. Hamilton only just won by sheer luck of Glock not having pitted. Massa won the race in style in front of his home crowd, and had the championship snatched away at the last second. Even Lewis has since said he didn't feel mature or ready enough for his first title and he felt like he'd gone too far too soon. Massa had that dreadful accident the following year in Hungary and was never the same again. Lewis would still have six titles, Massa could have retired with a championship to his name.

1986 - Mansell instead of Prost.

Mansell's one and only F1 championship seemed way too easy for him. That 1992 Williams was basically unbeatable. Still the most ""advanced"" car in F1 history. Even Patrese was consistently putting it home in second or third place, and even won in Japan. Mansell walked the entire season to win in an almost fittingly boring and dull style. But he fought like a madman through his entire motorsport career, his determination and hardship was unbelievable at times. I felt he was so cruelly robbed in 1986 when his tyre blew. Prost won other championships, I'm sure he'd have called it fair and deserved if Mansell hadn't retired from the race and took the title. 

1982 - Pironi instead of Rosberg

1982 was a pretty awful season all in, full of tragedy, some bizarre races, and political fallout. Rosberg managed to crawl into winning the championship despite winning just one race, retiring from three, and never really looking that exciting or championship-worthy. Pironi could easily have won had he not had such a terrible accident at Hockenheim. He still managed to finish second in the championship despite missing the last five races of a 16 round season, and not racing in Belgium because Gilles died in practice. Keke is a cool guy, and nothing against him personally, but he was never really championship material and lucked into that one in awful circumstances I'm sure he'd change if he could.

1956 - Moss instead of Fangio

Reaching a little bit as Juan-Manuel was such a fine driver who dominated his era, a record five titles that wouldn't be matched until 2002. Moss however is often described as ""the greatest driver never to win a championship"" and 1956 was his closest shot. A couple of very cruel retirements due to mechanical failure, including one at his home race at Silverstone where him and Fangio did identical qualifying times (only down to a tenth in those days, but Moss got the pole), he was just a couple of points behind Fangio at the end of the season.

Mansell's blowout at Adelaide in 1986 was not the reason he lost that championship (Prost actually had more bad luck retirements / non-scores than Mansell did in 1986, the blowout was just particularly spectacular). Nor was Glock the only reason Hamilton won the 2008 title.\n\nTo answer your question though, I would change 1981, though who I would want to win is a complex one. I'd be happy with pretty much any of the realistic contenders -  Reutemann, Jones, Laffite and Prost. \n\nThat year was mired in politicking and rules interpretation, and I feel that Piquet was among the biggest beneficiaries of that (with Brabham being the first to introduce hydraulic suspension) while also making a plethora of errors not really befitting of a champion. \n\nI'm not saying he didn't deserve it, and other drivers made errors that year too (Reutemann and Jones most notably) but I think other drivers deserved it a bit more personally."", '>2008 - Massa drove brilliantly all season\n\nStopped reading after that.
