1imb98k,We are expanding the r/formula1 moderator team. Applications are now open!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1imb98k/we_are_expanding_the_rformula1_moderator_team/,2025-02-10, Meta,"Hey r/formula1,

It has been a very long time, almost 4 years, since our last round of moderator recruitment. Back then we were only at 1.5 million members. Since then not only has the subreddit tripled in size, but after the 2023 Reddit Blackout multiple members of the mod team had left and since then the rest of us had also come close to being burnt out. So with all that and with an exciting 2025 season on the horizon it's time for a new round of moderator recruitment.

The qualifications to become a moderator are very simple:

* be a motorsports fan
* use reddit

The expectations for the new moderators are to be transparent, to be communicative and to be reasonably active. We have a guideline of 300 mod actions per month, but don't let this stop you from applying. **Real life always comes before Reddit** and just let the rest of the team know if you need a break.

After the form is closed we will evaluate the applications, compile a shortlist and invite those candidates to an interview. The interview will be conducted as an audio or video call. After the interview we will make the final selection of moderators and we hope to be able to onboard them by the Japanese GP at the start of April.

The applications will close on the 22nd of February at 23:00 UTC

[**Link to the application form**](https://forms.gle/gHS5HKHDWNbpJzXs8)

If you have any questions or doubts feel free to ask in the comments.

# FAQ

* **What timezones are you looking for mods from?**
   * We're looking for mods from all timezones

* **Do you need to have moderation experience?**
   * No, it's not an issue if you don't have moderator experience yet.

* **Is there any compensation for moderation?**
   * Absolutely none. This is a volunteer role","['I‚Äôd do it but any Seb Vettel hate would result in a permanent ban.

In any case, I don\'t think anyone is close to Ron (was the TP from 81 to 09) in that regard. How do you measure how good is a TP? For me, it\'s how well one does through multiple iterations of the team (drivers, designers, CTOs) and rulesets/eras.\n\n\nToto has won titles in, essentially, 2 eras (14-16 and 17-21), both under one common regulation set (the engines), with 2 drivers. Throw in any other name, and there\'s a ""but"" in the argument. Horner? Always had Newey. Todt? Always had Schumi, Brown, Byrne. The only other name worth mentioning is Chapman, but his success is more to do with him being the designer/CTO rather than the TP. \n\n\nRon has won titles in the early 80s turbo, the late 80s NA, the late 90s v10 era, and the spaceship late 2000s era. He\'s won titles with multiple drivers, under multiple designers/technical teams.', 'Do many people loathe Ron Dennis? I\'ve never seen anything bad written or said about him. \n\nWhen I was a kid I had a Scalextric set with two F1 cars - a 1994 Williams FW16, and a 1995 McLaren MP4-10.\n\nAs many F1 buffs will know, the FW16 had a low nose with the wing bolted directly onto it, but the MP4-10 was on of the first ""shark nose"" cars with the wing suspended from two pillars, something that became standard in F1 until the recent move back to low-noses with directly attached wings.\n\nObviously, scaled down to Scalextric size, the front with of the McLaren, being held on by two tiny bits of plastic, would easily snap when the car crashed, which being Scalextric, it did, a lot.\n\nNothing would hold it in place, but I noticed that their cars were sponsored by Loctite, so I sat down and wrote Ron a nice letter, asking if he had any special glue he could provide me as it was my favourite car and I was a big supporter of McLaren, popped it in the post, and even at 9 years old assumed that would be the end of the story.\n\nThen a few weeks later, a letter came through from McLaren, on McLaren letterheaded paper, all very official, signed and written by Ron himself. He explained that they unfortunately couldn\'t provide any special glue (no surprises there!) but he was happy for my support and suggested that modelling glue used on model planes might work well. He also included a signed photo of David Coulthard and apologised that they\'d run out of Mika\'s. I grant a secretary or someone might have written it, but it was signed in ink by the man himself.\n\nThis was during the off season between 1998/1999, obviously a very busy time for the team, so to think he made the effort to write back to a child asking for carbon-fibre grade glue is quite wonderful.', 'It has to be called Fifty Shades of Grey.', ""I always question the validity of the claim that Toto is the best team principal.
