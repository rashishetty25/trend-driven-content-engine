1oej9ie,McLaren must be ready for 'cut-throat' Verstappen - Hamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oej9ie/mclaren_must_be_ready_for_cutthroat_verstappen/,2025-10-24, News,,"['>Hamilton, who fought an intense and bitter championship battle with Verstappen in 2021, said: ""In that scenario it\'s challenging, the pressure is high. It is a time when you have to put your blinkers up and block everything from the outside.\n\n>""You have to be cut-throat and that is what Max is, he is going to take this from them if they don\'t do the same. You have to dig deep to hold off someone like Max and the car he is in. But also for either of them to come out ahead, consistency is key, and you\'ve seen that from Max in the last few races.""\n\n>""You have three incredibly talented drivers and I can\'t predict how they\'re going to behave,"" added Hamilton.\n\n>""Max has won it four times so he knows what it\'s like and being the hunter is much easier than being the defender. When you\'re in the lead and someone is chopping away at your lead, that plays on you more than if you\'re chasing and you have nothing to lose. In the lead you have everything to lose.""', 'High praise coming from an arch rival tbh', '[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Grand_Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Grand_Prix)\n\nYes, it does have to do with the PU and the aero efficiency of the car. The Honda/now Red Bull PU has always dealt with the altitude better.', ""the championship is playing out so nicely because lando and Oscar are close enough for either of them to win, and thus McLaren can't become a one-driver team right now. \n\nAnd that's exactly what max needs from McLaren. But they're far enough ahead that if either of the McLaren drivers is able to win half the races from here on out they'll win, so it's not a cake walk for max. \n\nAdditionally, you'll have Mercedes being competitive out of nowhere so that puts the uncertainty of George winning a race. \n\nThe only thing missing is a goatifi/mazespin to really bring it home."", 'They’re not even ready to be cut throat to each other, they’ve given Verstappen a sniff and he’s probably going to run them both down unfortunately.', 'Max doesn’t need to be cut throat.

1oel46m,'Not good enough' - Red Bull on Tsunoda ahead of key 2026 call,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oel46m/not_good_enough_red_bull_on_tsunoda_ahead_of_key/,2025-10-24, News,,"['> When asked about Tsunoda\'s deficit to Verstappen in the race, Mekies said: ""We always want more. I\'m not going to tell you it\'s good enough because you are right in quoting your numbers.\n> \n> ""I\'m not going to tell you that it\'s good enough, nobody feels like that, Yuki doesn\'t feel like that.\n> \n> ""All I\'m saying is that it\'s two races in the points, it\'s two very good starts, it\'s two very good first laps, and it\'s a progression compared to what has been shown so far this year.\n> \n> ""Is it good enough? No, I would lie if I was telling you that - and more so Yuki would not be happy if I was telling you this is good enough.""', ""He seemed genuinely emotional (kind of a mix of high strung/sadness/anger) answering some of the questions at the press conference.
