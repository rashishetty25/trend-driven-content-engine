1k61fmk,[AMuS] Mercedes made a mistake with the setup,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k61fmk/amus_mercedes_made_a_mistake_with_the_setup/,2025-04-23, News,,"['Translation:\n\n> **The Saudi Arabian GP was, from Mercedes\' perspective, the worst race of the year. After the race, the engineers explained why fifth and sixth places were the best they could hope for.**\n\n> McLaren is slowly disappearing on the horizon. In the chasing pack, however, Mercedes remains the benchmark. Although the Silver Arrows had their weakest weekend of the year so far in Jeddah, George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli scored the same number of points as Red Bull and only three points less than Ferrari. Russell summarizes: ""If we still finish fifth on a bad day, I can accept that.""\n\n> On Saturday, everything still looked good. George Russell missed pole position by just 0.113 seconds. Andrea Kimi Antonelli placed the Mercedes in fifth place on one of the most difficult tracks. This seemed to indicate that the Silver Arrows were also on top of the game on the high-speed track.\n\n> But the tide turned in the race. In the very discipline in which Mercedes had been so consistent up to that point, Russell had finished on the podium in three of the four races. This time, he began to lose sight of the champagne positions after just 15 laps, even though he was still running in third place.\n\n> **Early pit stop takes its toll.**\nBut suddenly, the gap between Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri widened, and Charles Leclerc slowly made up ground behind him. The pit lane called Russell into the pits on lap 20 because the medium tires were showing clear signs of wear and there were fears that Ferrari might attempt an undercut with Leclerc.\n\n> Leclerc actually drove an extra nine laps, gaining more and more speed on the worn-out medium tires. It dawned on Mercedes that a podium finish might be difficult this time. Even though Leclerc was still 3.6 seconds behind Russell after his pit stop.\n\n> In the second stint, Russell quickly ran into tire problems as well. They overheated: ""I tried to keep up with Max, but it didn\'t work. After that, I wanted to save the tires, but they were much older than Charles and Lando\'s. When they passed me, my tires completely collapsed. I was losing a second per lap to them.""\n\n> **Weak point front tire.**\nThe engineers could see from the data why their chief pilot had his back against the wall. The front tires on the Mercedes were blistering, a sign of overheating. It was unusual, however, that the Mercedes was the one to take the lead. The engineers explained: ""Jeddah is a track where you can choose whether the front or rear tire is subjected to more stress. We chose the front tire and probably overshot the target. We were also surprised by how fast the race pace was.""\n\n> Russell doesn\'t believe the result would have changed if he had approached the stints more cautiously: ""If I had taken more care of the tires, I probably would have still finished fifth. Ferrari was simply faster. We had a greater temperature increase than the other teams. In Bahrain, the tires also got hot, but very differently than here. We need to understand that better.""\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli only felt rapid degradation of the front tires in the first stint. In the second stint, he was spared his teammate\'s extreme tire problem, although he had to deal with Isack Hadjar for six laps immediately after the pit stop. After that, the Mercedes rookie was able to give his tires a rest. The next car in front of him was twelve seconds behind. In the end, Antonelli had enough reserves to keep the closing Hamilton at bay.\n\n> **No chance of a podium finish.**\nMercedes sent both drivers into the race with a medium-hard tire sequence. Lando Norris\'s hard-medium tactic wasn\'t a viable alternative for the strategists. ""If we give Kimi the hard tires at the start, there\'s a risk of Hamilton undercutting. He would then have had to overtake Lewis at the back of the track. We didn\'t want to risk that.""\n\n> Team principal Toto Wolff summed up with a slight frustration: ""We entered the race hoping to fight for a podium finish, but with the limitations of the tires, fifth and sixth places were the maximum for us."" Chief engineer Andrew Shovlin demanded: ""We need to improve our tire management.""', 'knew something had to be wrong when russell was not third.', 'Yeah it was clear they had messed something up there. I’d also argue though that Leclerc was simply faster. Ferrari found something in race pace, whether it was aided by track temps or characteristics or they managed to unlock something on the car, that put them a step ahead in the race. With all the dirty air etc taken into account, Norris was the fastest driver during the race and Leclerc was only fractionally behind him on pace. Ferrari definitely had a step forward last weekend.', 'Well, they still have a problem with hot tracks but it isn’t like last year fortunately. Also, if Jeddah problem was because the setup it isn’t a huge or a big one imho', "">If I had taken more care of the tyres, I probably would have still finished fifth. Ferrari was simply faster\n\nIt tracks. The drop-off in their pace was significant, and Ferrari genuinely look like they had a leg up in the game. I don't deny that the SF-25's weaknesses are prominent, but in this race alone, they had the upper hand\n\nA little bit of a hot take on my end, but aside from McLaren, I still cannot put a definitive finger on the 2nd or the 3rd fastest car among the grid, between Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes. To say that Ferrari is the slowest amongst the pack will be understandable, but difficult to affirm in sheer confidence. They clearly have strong aspects to capitalize on advantages that perhaps certain teams couldn't, similarly to Red Bull.\n\nAll it takes is for a DNF or two on McLaren's end, or any of their drivers dropping into the no-points zone for Mercedes to pounce on them. It is genuinely nowhere near over just yet. It sounds like copium on my end but if teams and drivers are still in the midst of pulling off great highs, then it is all game so far"", 'So is it a damping problem or general spring softness? Or is it an aero thing? They obviously never say, but I never know how to be fast and save tires in Forza while setting up my own car.', 'I’m no rocket biologist or anything but it feels like it was pretty clear', ""People are so quick nowadays to overreact. In the first four races (including Bahrain) the tire management was perfectly fine and much better than last season, but now after one bad race they all know that Mercedes will be struggeling on every circuit going forward. \n\nThe other way around with Ferrari. After the first four races people were dismissing them entirely, but after one good race, they are suddenly seen as force to reckon with. If anything, we have seen the Top 4 will mix through depending on the track likely till the end of season. Anybody making predictions at this point can't be taken seriously."", 'Imo  , Mercedes is the most balanced car at the moment , even more balanced than Mclaren . But , they are slow, Imo , when Ferrari and RB hit their operating window , they are also faster than Merc .
