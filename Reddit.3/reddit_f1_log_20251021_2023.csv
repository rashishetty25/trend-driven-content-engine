Any all time points list naturally favors later generation drivers as careers have been lengthening over time.\xa0\n\n**Edit:** forgot to add this earlier, both the StatsF1 and Formula1Points websites linked above have points listed for every driver who has ever scored points in F1.

1ocfwht,Championship Standings and Eliminations - United States GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ocfwht/championship_standings_and_eliminations_united/,2025-10-21, Statistics,"**WDC:** Despite outscoring Piastri in both the sprint and main race, Leclerc was not able to score enough to remain in contention. Russell is at risk of being eliminated next race in Mexico, if Piastri outscores him by 22 points. This would require Piastri to win and Russell to finish 9th or below.

I've added a new calculation: the best and worst possible finishing position. Interestingly, despite being 5th and 6th in the standings, the best Leclerc could finish is 2nd, while Hamilton could only manage 4th. Piastri is guaranteed to finish 4th or better, thus ensuring that he will at least tie his best finishing position (4th, in 2024). With 141 points remaining, there is considerable potential for movement towards the back of the grid, with 15 drivers being able to finish anywhere in the final 15 positions.

**WCC:** There was no change in the WCC this week, but the battle for 2nd is getting tighter, with Red Bull scoring more points than Ferrari, who scored more points than Mercedes. There is considerable potential for movement between these team next week in Mexico:

* Mercedes will retain 2nd provided they don't lose more than 7 points to Ferrari and 9 points to Red Bull
* Ferrari will retake 2nd if they outscore Mercedes by 8 points and don't lose more than 2 points to Red Bull
* Red Bull will take 2nd if they outscore Mercedes by 10 points and Ferrari by 3

There are two clear groups of teams forming: Mercedes to Red Bull, with possible finishing positions between 2nd and 5th; and Racing Bulls and below, with possible finishing positions between 5th and 10th. Williams is alone in the middle, with the possibility of finishing anywhere between 2nd and 10th.","[""Why is nobody out here talking about George's first WDC coming up??

1ockvts,"F1 fans often talk about our ‚Äòdream calendar‚Äô with our favourite circuits, but what about a ‚Äònightmare calendar‚Äô? A season full of awful circuits...",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ockvts/f1_fans_often_talk_about_our_dream_calendar_with/,2025-10-21, Discussion,"Let‚Äôs suppose that we took charge at Liberty Media and the FIA, giving us complete freedom to create our calendar. We need to schedule 24 races at venues which could realistically hold F1 races, with an emphasis on races where we‚Äôll rake in the biggest promotor fees.

Here‚Äôs what I think the nightmare calendar might look like:

**Round 1: Bahrain Grand Prix (mid March)**

**Bahrain International Circuit**

We‚Äôll start the season off in the Middle East. Bahrain is a decent enough circuit but we‚Äôll be racing on the dreaded ‚Äòendurance layout‚Äô which adds 9 corners to slow down the action and reduce overtaking opportunities. It‚Äôs the perfect way to spoil the excitement of a new season.

**Round 2: Grand Prix of America (late March)**

**Port Imperial Street Circuit**

This is a 5.1km street circuit in New Jersey which was supposed to host an F1 race starting in 2013. We know that Liberty Media desperately want to host a race in the New York metro area, so let‚Äôs pull some strings to resurrect the project. The circuit will be narrow, and the racing will be crap, but at least there will be some pretty shots of the New York City skyline.

Watch a lap on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD1B5\_3wcE0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD1B5_3wcE0)

**Round 3: Japanese Grand Prix (early April)**

**Mobility Resort Motegi**

Motegi would be a terrible venue for Formula 1. The 4.8km road course is awkwardly positioned inside an oval track, so the circuit is quite flat, it features an excessive number of hairpins, and the grandstands are located far away from the action. But if the owners write us a big cheque and promise to improve the facilities to secure FIA Grade 1 certification then we can let them host the Japanese Grand Prix.

**Round 4: Saudi Arabian Grand Prix (mid April)**

**Qiddiya Speed Park**

Qiddiya is a proposed entertainment complex in Riyadh which plans to incorporate a racetrack with elevated sections and lots of banking to make it feel like a roller coaster. I suspect that the bonkers design for this circuit will be scaled back once the developers have embezzled the project's funds. So it just becomes another boring Middle East racetrack with poor attendance.

**Round 5: Long Beach Grand Prix (late April)**

**Long Beach Street Circuit**

We‚Äôll bring Formula 1 back to the LA area which is a great excuse to pack the paddock full of movie stars. The bumpy surface is an iconic feature of this circuit, so we won‚Äôt bother resurfacing the track, but it doesn‚Äôt matter all that much because the circuit is too narrow and short for today‚Äôs giant F1 cars. To distract viewers from the race we‚Äôll order the TV director to cut to a celebrity every 30 seconds.

Watch a lap on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKbGP2pHifg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKbGP2pHifg)

**Round 6: Buenos Aires Grand Prix (early May)**

**Puerto Madero Street Circuit**

To capitalise on the popularity of Franco Colapinto we‚Äôll greenlight a race in Buenos Aires. I know there‚Äôs a proposal to redevelop the Aut√≥dromo Oscar y Juan G√°lvez but that circuit looks too fast and too exciting. So we‚Äôll hold our race on an expanded version of the city‚Äôs old Formula E circuit, which means that we have yet another cramped street circuit around a harbour. Let‚Äôs just hope that Colapinto is around for a long enough to help sell those tickets‚Ä¶

**Round 7: Chinese Grand Prix (mid May)**

**Beijing E-Town Street Circuit**

Attendance at Shanghai has been disappointing for years, so let‚Äôs shake things up and move the Chinese Grand Prix to this new street circuit in Beijing. The 4.9km circuit is essentially just a race through a business park, with eight slow 90¬∞ corners, one contrived chicane, and straights which are too short to let F1 cars overtake. We‚Äôll leave the manhole covers loose so they can randomly destroy some cars over the weekend.

**Round 8: Russian Grand Prix (late May)**

**Sochi Autodrome**

Sochi was always a dreary circuit with no atmosphere. It‚Äôs main purpose was to help Vladamir Putin launder his reputation. So we‚Äôre going back to Sochi to help him relaunder his reputation. We‚Äôll make sure that every driver parrots the same talking point about how ‚Äú*sport brings people together*‚Äù...

**Round 9: Vietnamese Grand Prix (early June)**

**Hanoi Street Circuit**

We‚Äôll now head to southeast Asia to give the Vietnam Grand Prix a second chance. The circuit is quite interesting with a long straights and lots of fast corners, like Jeddah. But we can ruin the circuit by making the entirety of the main 1.5km straight a DRS zone, which should make overtaking absurdly easy. Let‚Äôs just hope that we can hold the race before the new race promotor gets arrested!

**Round 10: Dubai Grand Prix (mid June)**

**Dubai Autodrome**

I actually think this circuit would be a good F1 track, which makes sense because it was originally supposed to host a Grand Prix. It‚Äôs 5.3km with two long straights and two challenging technical sections with elevation changes. But it‚Äôs yet another Middle Eastern race where we can be sure of low attendance and a tepid atmosphere. We‚Äôll also schedule the race to clash with Le Mans.

**Round 11: Miami Grand Prix (late June)**

**Miami International Autodrome**

Miami is a decent circuit when you bear in mind that it‚Äôs just a car park with some blue paint. But to make it even more unbearable we‚Äôll add another fake marina, we‚Äôll bring back those cringy driver introductions from 2023, and we‚Äôll let Trump hand out the trophies on the podium (unless he decides to keep them for himself).

**Round 12: European Grand Prix (early July)**

**Valencia Street Circuit**

This circuit was infamous for having very few overtakes during a five-year stint in F1, so it‚Äôs the perfect venue for the European Grand Prix. The circuit is quite run-down at the moment, but if we give it a fresh coat of paint I‚Äôm sure it will do fine. At least this circuit has a real marina‚Ä¶

Watch a lap on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdJd\_Ln1VRU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdJd_Ln1VRU)

**Round 13: Qatar Grand Prix (late July)**

**Lusail International Circuit**

Qatar has always been a woeful F1 circuit. But we can make it even worse by holding it on a July afternoon, which means we can expect temperatures of about 42¬∞C. So the Grand Prix isn‚Äôt really a race, it‚Äôs more like a test to see which drivers can avoid passing out from heat exhaustion.

**Round 14: Sao Paulo Grand Prix (early August)**

**Sao Paulo Street Circuit**

Usually there‚Äôs a summer break in August to let F1 personnel have some time off. But we‚Äôre going to schedule a ‚Äòtriple-header‚Äô in August to prevent them from spending time with their families. The action starts in Brazil, where we‚Äôll utilise the 4.1km street circuit IndyCar used from 2010 to 2013. The circuit goes around an exhibition venue. It‚Äôs flat, it‚Äôs narrow, it‚Äôs boring ‚Äì Nothing like Interlagos. Perfect.

**Round 15: Azerbaijan Grand Prix (mid August)**

**Baku City Circuit**

F1 has raced at Baku since 2016 and the fans appreciate the track for the long main straight and the tight corners which catch drivers out. So under the guise of safety we‚Äôll add two chicanes to the main straight and another chicane on the back straight. The chicanes look awful and they turn the race into a dull procession. We can also spoil the excitement of qualifying by moving the barriers back on the exits of all the tight corners.

**Round 16: Rwandan Grand Prix (late August)**

**Bugesera International Circuit**

Lewis Hamilton‚Äôs prayers have been answered! An African government has diverted funding away from boring projects like education and healthcare and is using the money to build what the people of Africa *really* need - an international racing venue. I have no idea if the circuit will be any good, but it will be located right next to the airport to ensure that F1 personnel can spend as little time in the country as possible.

**Round 17: Australian Grand Prix (early September)**

**Mount Panorama Circuit**

Casual racing fans often say they‚Äôd love to see F1 race at Bathurst. But they should be careful what they wish for. You see, in order to accommodate an F1 race we‚Äôre going to butcher this iconic racing venue by widening the track, removing many of the tight corners and installing copious run-off areas. The result is a mess which doesn‚Äôt make a good F1 race, and the changes we‚Äôve made spoil all the other series which race at Bathurst.

**Round 18: Kazakhstan Grand Prix (mid September)**

**Sokol International Racetrack**

Kazakhstan is home to 20 million people, but not many of them will get to see this race because Sokol Racetrack has been built in a field in the middle of nowhere. The few spectators who make the trek will be treated to a classic Hermann Tilke circuit, featuring very long straights and abundant tarmac run-off. It‚Äôs effectively a second race in Bahrain, but the promotion fee is much higher. At least fans can be grateful it‚Äôs not another street circuit‚Ä¶

Watch a lap on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cytpjv8feYw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cytpjv8feYw)

**Round 19: Thailand Grand Prix (late September)**

**Bangkok Street Circuit**

This race will be held around the streets of Chatuchak district in the Thai capital. Unfortunately the only slot left on the calendar is late September, which is right in the middle of Bangkok‚Äôs ‚Äòrainy season‚Äô. So there‚Äôs a good chance that the race is a complete washout. Assuming that the race stays afloat we‚Äôll need to drum up local support for the event, so inspired by Alex Albon we‚Äôll order every F1 driver to change their nationality to Thai.

**Round 20: Kuwait Grand Prix (early October)**

**Kuwait City Street Circuit**

Kuwait‚Äôs ‚ÄòMotor Town‚Äô track would be a legitimately fantastic venue for F1, and it‚Äôs already certified as FIA Grade 1. So we‚Äôll ignore that and instead hold a new street circuit in Kuwait City. We‚Äôll race around the northern section of the city to ensure we get plenty of slow 90¬∞ corners and plenty of shots of the snazzy Al Hamra Tower.

**Round 21: Singapore Grand Prix (mid October)**

**Marina Bay Street Circuit**

Formula 1 has been racing at Singapore for eighteen years and the event makes a lot of sense when you realise its purpose is to show off the city rather than deliver an entertaining race. To make the racing even worse we‚Äôll use the pre-2023 layout which gives us four more slow 90¬∞ corners.

**Round 22: Las Vegas Grand Prix (late October)**

**Las Vegas Convention Circuit**

The Vegas Strip Circuit is producing some good races, but it costs a lot of money and the locals complain a lot about the disruption F1 causes. So we‚Äôll try ‚ÄòVegas on a budget‚Äô by staging a much less exciting race in and around the convention centre located just north-east of the strip. At least it‚Äôs better than Ceasar‚Äôs Palace‚Ä¶

**Round 23: Canadian Grand Prix (early December)**

**Circuit Gilles Villeneuve**

We‚Äôll take a break in November to kill off any excitement for the end of the season. Then we‚Äôll hold the penultimate round at one of the most beloved circuits on the calendar. The problem is that in December the average temperature in Montreal plunges to -1.2¬∞C. So the teams will be faced with the technical challenge of keeping their cars and drivers working in the freezing temperatures.

**Round 24: Abu Dhabi Grand Prix (mid December)**

**Yas Marina Circuit**

Abu Dhabi has spoilt the finale of many F1 seasons, so it‚Äôs an appropriate venue to end our nightmare calendar. To make the racing extra dull we‚Äôll revert back to the 2009‚Äì2021 layout, and we‚Äôll award **triple points** for this race to undermine the significance of the rest of the season. And to be needlessly cruel to F1 personnel we‚Äôll schedule the race for the weekend before Christmas.

However, everything can always be better ... these are my realistic thoughts (mostly realistic in any case...) to improve the show. What do you think?

1. Points system should be expanded maybe down to 15th. Easy and a total no-brainer IMO. Would give the backmarkers more to race for.
2. Sprint race qualification. Nice enough with more racing / show, but right now its a carbon copy of the race and IMO thats a missed opportunity. Some say reverse grid. I'm not really for that. Instead I would bring back the one lap shootout for qualifying. That would bring enough randomness into the game (track conditions, track evolution). Order = championship position, let the leader go first.
3. Sprint race. This is harder reg. the setup ... but I think it should be doable in our time and computer age: many tracks has different configurations. Change it between sprint and race, so that the sprint has a different configuration. I know sectors will have to be changed for timing. And track will have to be modified, maybe with some paint and curbes worst case scenario. But think that would bring something extra.
4. Would love to see an extra race between the formula 1 drivers - maybe on none-sprint-weekends? - in equal machinery. Could be sponsored locally per event: In germany GT4 porsches, in US some Chevy stock car etc. etc. Expensive and difficult to do maybe ... but think it would create a huge interest. Here qualifying could be an oldfashioned 1 hour test session (to let the drivers learn the machinery) and the grid determined by the sessions order.

1obwd3n,New idea for Endurance style race in future F1 seasons,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1obwd3n/new_idea_for_endurance_style_race_in_future_f1/,2025-10-20, Discussion,"This is a personal opinion and maybe not a new idea but I personally haven‚Äôt seen this conversation come up. I know F1 is trying to come up with new ways to bring in more fans and Lee more fans interested. F1 has a unique team and constructor element to its sport that you don‚Äôt see in American racing series. F1 is always rumored to be going in the direction of more sprints and more short action events to not lose the attention of fans, they think the only way to gain new viewers is to be able to make a race short enough to post on TikTok, Reels, & YouTube Shorts. But I think biggest complaint is often the lack of action, especially for 1st place. So what if instead of adding races to calendar and/or adding sprints what if a few weekends out of the year they did a tag team ‚Äúendurance‚Äù style race.

You could still do qualifying a similar way. 
Session 1, each team picks a number 1 driver to do a Quali run.
Session 2 the number 2s go out, then session 3, is the best driver from each team in Q1 and q2 go out again for final q3 starting grid. 
Then race day you pick which driver to start and  they drive a full race or maybe only 2/3-3/4. And you still require 1 mandatory pit for each driver, then when they finish their full race instead of crossing finish on last lap, they enter pit lane and 2nd driver leaves their garage once pit crew gets the first car jacked up and wheeled into the garage. Then the 2nd driver goes out and does their 50+ laps through the finish line. Nobody gets individual points just team points maybe only for top 5 or top 7 teams. And if you want to add individual element, you could pair it with a sprint weekend to score individual points

1obylse,Piastri chances are still strong - I built a Python Monte Carlo F1 Simulator to predict the WDC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1obylse/piastri_chances_are_still_strong_i_built_a_python/,2025-10-21, Statistics,"With the title fight tightening up after the US GP (Piastri P5, Verstappen P1), I got tired of guessing, so I built a Python-based Monte Carlo simulation to project the final Drivers' Championship outcome.

How real are Verstappen's chances? 

  
1. Track-Specific Performance Weights (Adjustable)

I created a custom system that applies a performance multiplier (a weight) to each driver for the specific characteristics of the remaining tracks (Mexico, Brazil, Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi).

* **Example:** Verstappen gets a `+20% likelihood boost` for Mexico City's high-altitude/high-downforce circuit. This addresses the fact that some cars simply perform better on specific layouts.

# 2. Deterministic ""What If"" Analysis

The script automatically runs a hard-math check to see what happens if Verstappen wins out. Which outside of 2023 - is pretty unlikely even given his current form.

Right now even if Max wins out and Piastri gets 2nd, Piastri takes the championship. 

`--- Deterministic 'What If' Analysis ---`  
`SCENARIO: If VER wins EVERY remaining race/sprint:`  
   `PIA CAN still win the WDC.`  
   `PIA Max Points (if 2nd every time): 450`  
   `VER Guaranteed Points: 447`  
`-------------------------------------------`



The chances for winning a race are the big question. You can run the script and change them. The reality is Max needs a good run + some bad luck from McLaren. 

With these default weights:   
  
`--- World Drivers' Championship Simulation Results (Track-Adjusted) ---`  
`Total Simulations Run: 10,000`  
  
`--- Championship Win Probability ---`  
`Driver | WDC Chance`  
`------ | ----------`  
`PIA    | 74.33%`  
`NOR    | 25.57%`  
`VER    | 0.10%`

  
It does not take a DNF into account - although there is a chance the driver does not score. 

You can play with code and change the weights here:
