I’ve been watching Formula 1 for over two decades, but I’ve never lived close enough to a circuit to attend a race—until this weekend. My first in-person experience at the Las Vegas Grand Prix was eye-opening, with far more to take in than just what happened on the track. Here are a few impressions - in no particular order - from a long-time F1 fan attending a race for the first time.

\-------------------

# Seeing an F1 Race Start Live

https://preview.redd.it/4qonkc5e513g1.jpg?width=2326&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bc8f07ea60fffe4c2a2dfd17e2a218b80bbb5e6

it’s one of those things you think you understand from TV, but it didn’t really hit me until I was there in person. The build-up, the tension, and the explosion of sound as the engines rev before lights out are on a completely different level. Unforgettable.

\-------------------

# Smooth, Clockwork, and Massive Organization (Loose Manholes Aside)

[One of the primary stages positioned around the track, where many of the event activities took place](https://preview.redd.it/btv5ccsoz03g1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11d9ca489c48c77ff8d5aa5a8366c42a2f8b5dc7)

The first thing that struck me was how flawlessly everything ran. Check-in was quick, staff and F1 guides were everywhere and genuinely helpful, and the accessibility options—elevators, ramps, and clearly marked pathways—were easy to find and thoughtfully placed. 

\-------------------

# Impossible to dislike James Vowles

[James Vowles - Not my picture obviously](https://preview.redd.it/cvihd99tz03g1.jpg?width=3392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5b065b23689681c0f45678b6bc55a1ce260a59c)

During an interview on one of the stages between sessions, Vowles spoke about how grateful he is for the fans who stand behind Williams, especially as an independent team without manufacturer backing. He admitted they’re not ready to fight for titles yet, but they’re on the way.

Then things got fun: when asked which two team principals he’d take out for a Vegas boys’ night, he picked Toto Wolff first (obviously). His second choice was Fred Vasseur, mostly because -according to Vowles-  he’s a character and it only takes two drinks before he starts singing.

\-------------------

# Family-Friendly and Surprisingly Diverse

[Is F1 a circus - yep!](https://preview.redd.it/v6wveuk8013g1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=382e8cc3fae5792fbefa01edaaa9c2d48f11dca7)

The event was much more family-friendly and diverse than I expected. Between simulator rides, F1 car photo-ops, an electronic fan wall, acrobats, and concerts, there was something for everyone—and the crowd showed it. They call F1 a circus, and in Vegas the activities definitely matched that energy. The whole experience felt efficient, welcoming, and surprisingly accessible.

\-------------------

# Fernando Alonso: Shorter Than Expected, Cooler Than Ever

[Alonso and Stroll during one of the pre-race interviews](https://preview.redd.it/bycilz3i013g1.jpg?width=2480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9aeabdd804a4cd1b617e40ec7e7f95f991286455)

As I was walking to my seat, I suddenly heard people screaming at the top of their lungs and had no idea why. Seconds later, Fernando-effing-Alonso walked right by me. I felt like a full-grown fanboy—part stunned, part wondering if I should start screaming too. He’s shorter in person than I expected, but he was gracious and smiling as he moved through a crowd that was absolutely losing its mind.

\-------------------

# Trackside Commentary & Fan Appreciation

[This isn’t a Friday shot; it’s from the last day. I was far too soaked and freezing on Friday to even think about taking pictures.](https://preview.redd.it/gc2c357t013g1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3fc38e6f734bd455b4a70575d81e177a23b10c7)

Seeing Bob Varsha on the mic was an unexpected throwback—maybe not widely known outside the U.S., but he was one of the iconic Speed TV F1 voices years ago. During the practice-session downpour, he thanked the fans braving the cold, saying we had the “undying appreciation of F1.” A genuinely classy moment.

The organizers also tried to lift spirits by getting the crowd to do a wave, but with most of us soaked and freezing, the attempt had… mixed results.

\-------------------

# Lewis and Charles: Already Acting Like Old Friends

[Best buddies Lewis and Charles](https://preview.redd.it/u9v8gz1m113g1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bfdee3153dbcfb6f9933f72c3e269029e89f150)

In the pre-race interviews, Lewis and Charles were their usual polite, composed selves. Charles couldn’t stop bringing up qualifying—you could tell that’s where his head was. But what stood out was how relaxed they were around each other. For a first-year teammate pairing, they already looked like longtime friends.

\-------------------

# Petersen Auto Museum Exhibits

[F1 cars of the not-so-distant past](https://preview.redd.it/0g229jyy113g1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35c1442457e76c8c43d65eeb8709637f695fe2e5)

The Petersen Auto Museum showcased a series of Formula 1 displays around the track, giving fans an up-close look at iconic cars from years past. A very cool touch.

\-------------------

# There are F1 experiences… and then there’s the Lewis Hamilton experience:

[An F1 experience to remember - with Lewis as your driver.](https://preview.redd.it/v82kxqae213g1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cef8d311ac43706ff8ef6e60865fabe7c687197f)

Qualifying rain had us checking how much it’d cost to be inside the main building. Answer: $7,500 per person just to stand on the top level. We stayed wet. But the ultimate upgrade? A hot lap in a Ferrari with Lewis Hamilton. I didn’t check the price. I value my blood pressure.

\-------------------

# Vasseur’s Quiet Work Boosting Team Morale

[Fred keeping an eye on things](https://preview.redd.it/41sxkcnr213g1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3885cd49daa2ed51eced669f00402ccf12022dd)

As the cars rolled onto the grid before the race, Fred Vasseur stood out as the only team principal I could spot. He moved from one crew member to another—chatting, joking, lifting spirits. I couldn’t hear what he said from the grandstands, but the body language from the Ferrari crew made it obvious: genuine respect and appreciation. Ferrari feels like a very different place compared to the Arrivabene days. Fred’s leadership shows. Even as a McLaren fan, I genuinely hope Ferrari finds its way.

\-------------------

# A special shoutout to the guides

[A 2024 McLaren MCL38 in static display.](https://preview.redd.it/iqq8epns313g1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a38c63a356aef88f17187b32fb04df139577e68)

During one practice session, I walked in wearing full papaya gear, and a guide actually pulled me aside—without me even asking—to tell me that last year’s McLaren was on display and exactly where to find it. I really appreciated that.

\-------------------

# A Few Things That Missed the Mark

[Lego doing things right and Terry Crews congratulating Max](https://preview.redd.it/9t3a9uqr413g1.jpg?width=1914&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b98437e9c763a9dffeb40b65b121c76288208e03)

Even with how great the weekend was overall, a few things still stood out as areas that could’ve been better:

* **Commentary:** On-track commentary didn’t match F1 broadcast quality—*and you really feel that when the race itself isn’t delivering much action.*
* **Crane + safety car = why?:** A crane in front of the safety car with the whole field behind it was baffling.
* **Disney’s over-the-top moment:** The post-race show looked impressive but felt forced. I prefer Lego’s approach: add personality without taking over the entire moment.","['You really took some to craft and post this, kudos! I am glad you had a lovely time at the prix!', 'The free Amex radios at the track had the F1TV crew on them all weekend, it was great.

1p5bwki,The Final Two Races Will Be a Pure Pressure Test,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5bwki/the_final_two_races_will_be_a_pure_pressure_test/,2025-11-24, Discussion,"The final two races are shaping up to be the best end to a season in years. On paper Norris still has the strongest position with his points lead, but the situation is a lot more fragile than it looks.

McLaren’s DSQ in Vegas changed everything. Since the floor was ruled illegal they need to run the car more carefully. They cannot push the downforce window as far as before. That affects qualifying, tyre management, race pace and confidence. On top of that Max still runs a newer engine while McLaren are stretching an older unit. The risk of a technical issue sits more on the orange side of the garage.

Max can attack without fear. Norris has everything to lose. That changes how both drive in wheel to wheel fights. Max is proven under pressure. We have seen him in these situations many times. He keeps the car tidy. He delivers when it matters. Norris has made mistakes this season under stress. Same for Piastri. Both are fast. Both deserve to be here. But both lost points because they pushed a bit too hard when the pressure was high.

Piastri is the wild card. A few races ago he looked out of it. Now he is right back in the fight. He can afford to take risks because he is not the one with the lead. He can swing for a win. That brings chaos into play. If Norris and Piastri end up battling each other too hard it opens the door for Max to do exactly what he does best. Stay clean. Stay calm. Pick up the points. And grab a fifth title.

So the real question for the last two rounds is simple. Who handles pressure best. Norris with the target on his back. Piastri with nothing to hold back. Or Max with the chance to punish every mistake in front of him.","[""Lando still has a huge advantage. All he has to do is not do anything too silly and not get involved in drama and he's got it in the bag. I know F1 media will try to make it look like WW2, but honestly it's not that close. If he managed 2 clean first laps then he's this year's WDC"", "">Max can drive without fear.\n\nWhile yeah. Max is always going to be driving like a madman now. But 1 DNF for him and it's over for him as well. All three can't risk a DNF now.

Oscar would be the first Australian champ in a long time, and a bit of a redemption arc considering who his manager is, and, of course, a driver winning in only their 3rd season in the sport would be also pretty special.

Turn 14 had the most overtakes with 55 overtakes across the two races, but there is no public grandstand there. I added up all the overtakes not visible from a public grandstand. That includes Turn 14, the T13–T14 back straight, Turn 16, and the smaller moves at Turns 10, 12 and 15, it came out to 87 overtakes in total.

That’s 49.7% of every single on-track overtake from the first two Las Vegas GPs happening in places you can’t watch from any standard grandstand.

1p4uzkf,What changes can the team make to a car's setup?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p4uzkf/what_changes_can_the_team_make_to_a_cars_setup/,2025-11-23, Discussion,"Okay, now that we've cooled off a bit after the Las Vegas GP, I wanted to ask a question. I've always been into F1 for the racing bit but a while ago I started being interested into the technical side of the sport as well.

I was wondering, is there some information or a video I can access about what exactly the driver and their team are changing on a car's setup during the weekend? I can think of the obvious things like ride height, engine maps/fuel plans and maybe the general aerodynamic stuff with the wings. However, I know there's probably a lot more than that.

It's just getting increasingly more interesting to me how teams are able to get so many things right in just a few hours of practice to achieve the perfect car balance. I would imagine they have some general ranges for settings they gather through the simulator and past races. Also the technology is obviously a lot better than previous years.

But still, getting plank wear down to millimeters, tyre wear so that your wheels are barely hanging on by the end of the race... Those things are incredibly impressive to me.

Would appreciate anyone that's more tech-savvy pointing me to the right direction to learn more about this part of racing!","['I would look here for your answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/', 'You have better answers here\n\nr/f1technical', ""The F1 youtube channel have a series of videos called Tech Talk, and there's a good podcast from The Athletic called The Tech Show.\n\n\nSam Collins on the youtube channel makes things very accessible for newer fan or people not as technically minded. On the podcast, Gary Anderson is a wealth of info and experience but there might be more of a level of assumed knowledge there."", 'Ride height, rake, cross weight, camber, toe, aero, springs, compression, rebound, etc', ""Watching f1 for the racing? Best joke I've heard in a while"", 'Stuff to make the car go faster or slower in corners. Faster or slower on the straights.', 'Just to expand on this answer since it’s about the only one that answers the question instead of linking to F1Technical…\n\nRide height = how high the car is off the ground. Lower means higher performance but we just saw the negative consequences of too low.\n\nRake = looking at a side view of the car, rake is the angle relative to the ground. Probably more variable in the last regulation set so maybe google “low rake Mercedes high rake Red Bull” and see what comes back\n\nCross weight = weight on opposite sides of the car (for example, front right and rear left) that affects how the car handles x also called “wedge.” I would also add to this ballast, which is a less specific term for when a car is under weight and the team can place the extra mass to get it up to minimum weight wherever it would like.\n\nCamber = looking at the tires from the front, camber is how much they are angled side to side. Lots of YouTube videos about how camber helps\n\nToe = looking at the tires from above, toe is how much the tire points in or out relative to the direction of travel. Probably YouTube videos about this, but also look up videos about “Mercedes DAS” to learn about a trick system they developed in 2020 to control toe\n\nAero = the various wings and sticky-uppy bits on the car. Wings create downforce, sticky-uppy bits usually control losses from air flowing over the car to reduce drag/make the car more slippery through the air\n\nSprings = coils that control how much the wheels travel up and down when going over bumps, making turns, etc.\n\nCompression and rebound = not super familiar but here’s a link - https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/s/zi8jyrJWnG\n\nI would add to this tire pressure, the design of the floor (even though this is that same as aero), and engine settings/mapping (turning performance of the power unit up and down)', 'And to add to this, adjusting just one of these options will affect all the other components as well.\n\nUsing the plank as an example; these things are calculated down to the mm obviously so say you want more camber for more lateral grip? Car will sit lower affecting the ride height, which will also depend on the fuel weight at X time. So you raise the car but now your driver is complaining about understeer.\n\nFine, we’ll just adjust the front wing, right? Now your fronts are overheating after the fast section.\n\nSo now you say, we’ll increase the tire pressure to compensate! But now, you’ll have less grip with higher pressures and you’ll sit a few mm higher. So now you’ll need to calculate tire wear with the new pressure and setups to make sure you’re within regulations with plank wear and weight due to the rubber loss throughout the race.\n\nAnd so on and so forth; this isn’t taking into account of track conditions either', ""Thank you and everyone in this comment thread! Exactly what I was looking for. I can't really post in F1Technical so I appreciate giving all the info here even if it's maybe the wrong subreddti!""]",22,19,0.72,22,84,84,-2,0,0.0,-2

1p4t9cx,Lost in the fracas of last night is the continued suicidality of the FIA and F1 drivers with regards to their treatment of double waved yellows,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p4t9cx/lost_in_the_fracas_of_last_night_is_the_continued/,2025-11-23, Discussion,"Everyone is focused and angry at the race control for allowing marshals on track on lap 2, under non neutralised status. Which is fair and good! You should be mad at them for that, but lost in this is the continued non-treatment of double waved yellows.

  
Its fine and good to be mad at it for happening to begin with, but the truth of the matter is that race control is responsible for upwards of 7 KM of track and dozens of people, shit is going to happen from time to time. Corner marshals exist to be that last line of defence in situations like this, with their discretion to, at a moment's notice, wave double waved yellows to tell drivers to slow significantly and be prepared to stop. And it is EXTREMELY important to build respect for these, because even if race control is 99% effective, with over 100 sessions a year, that still means something is going to go wrong once or twice. And in those crucial moments, that's when you need to have respect for the corner marshals and their double waved yellows. Its ridiculous, and can easily get someone killed.

  
Now, how do you actually enforce it? To that, I say, I am a random online. Its really easy to recognise an issue, but harder to fix it. However, I must point out that F1 cars are very precisely tracked, with their inputs very precisely lined up to where they are. It shouldn't be too hard in 2025 with machine learning to figure out if a driver backed off by some % between the first marshal's post where they saw a double waved yellow, and the next marshal's post showing the track is clear. Its just utterly insane that double waved yellows almost mean nothing today.","['BTW it is very common for marshals to go on track in the early laps, without any flags, to clear debris. The entire field is bunched up at that point and poses no real risk given the time limit they are given to be on track, as well as radio communication of where the next car on track is.', 'Lack of enforcement of slowing for yellows and double waved yellows was a major contributor to Bianchis avoidable death. If it’s not enforced everyone will speed through because if you aren’t speeding through you are losing time to everyone else who is.\n\nWe’ve had a good few years of rules being heavily enforced which means cars have generally been slowing down to a safe speed. What we saw this weekend was ludicrous. In Q3 Hadjar not only went through a yellow without lifting in the slightest, but when he encountered a car in front who had lifted he had to step on the brakes so hard that he locked up, lost control and ran that car off the track.\n\nIt would have been a perfect opportunity for the stewards to make an example to ensure the rules are enforced, instead they chose to do nothing. That sends a message that it’s ok not to lift for yellow flags, and makes future near misses like this more likely.', 'Completely agree. Double yellow means ""Be ready to stop at any moment"", speed should be reduced A LOT. What we see is not nearly enough, but for the sake of making races ""smoother"" we let it go.\xa0', ""I had brought up that two drivers went off in Brazil in a zone under double waved yellows, and it didn't even get a mention on the broadcast, let alone an inquiry by the stewarts.\n\nThis year has been fraught with close calls of all kinds where track workers were put in dangerous situations.\n\nThe group of track workers (honestly they are all volunteers) at a high speed corner with the cars heading right at them last night was just the latest, and possibly most egregious of the year."", ""FIA don't care, and will continue to not care until someone is seriously injured or killed. The drivers aren't going to back off for yellows until they get penalised for failing to do so.\nThis isn't a new phenomenon nor limited to F1.\nIn order for FIA to do anything, they would have to acknowledge the risk, which I don't see them doing any time soon. The best way to convince the drivers would be to treat each marshalling sector with a double waved yellow as a slow zone with an appropriate penalty for exceeding the speed in that area (time penalty, reprimand or black/white flag)."", 'I think FOM/FIA need to do an article on just how quickly an F1 driver reacts and how fast these cars can change line and also stop.  It is incredible.  And would stop a lot of these armchair analysis bashing the dumb volunteer monkeys who keep trying to kill themselves.  /rant.\n\nWe used to be able to go trackside, under double yellows (with or without the panels which are what trigger the tv warnings) and clear debris, under direction but this ability was taken away due to insurance and not trusting the dedicated, experienced marshals to do thier job.   There was respect from drivers and race control.', ""Lawson's incident is a perfect example of why that is unacceptable."", ""This isn't a new thing.\xa0\n\n\nHäkkinen was under investigation for not lifting during Monaco qualifying.\xa0\n\n\nHe was cleared, despite not lifting. Because he lifted his arm out the cockpit.\xa0\n\n\nThat was enough.\xa0\n\n\nThe problem is defining how much the cars should slow down by.\xa0"", 'Aye… be ready to STOP at any moment… not be ready to slow down… single yellow already means slow down. I don’t get whether it’s these incidents or two drivers going for an impossibility of a corner where there’s really only a one car space.\n\nIt’s called a Brake Pedal.  It’s right there next to the gas.  Jesus.  This is the unintended consequence of making these cars so amazingly safe.  The actual probability of someone dying these days compared to Jackie Stewart’s days is remote, these guys are driving like it’s Nascar, just with a higher price tag for broken parts.  \n\nJules was the last to have a fatal accident, and that was truly a fluke and before/the impetus to finally use the halo.

We’re seeing it right now as George has said multiple times he didn’t even know until recently he was technically still in the fight. 

Honestly, nobody seems to care about positions beyond first. But with how prestigious the Drivers’ Championship is, shouldn’t there be prizes for it too?
 
Sure, many drivers have performance bonuses in their contracts, but imagine if there was an actual cash prize for finishing in the top 10 or cash prize per race(my preference)! I’m sure the McLaren drivers wouldn’t easily agree to a position swap if there was money on the line.
 
It wouldn’t be anywhere near the scale of the Constructors’ prize.. Idk maybe something like the Grand Prix points system: $25m for first, $18m for second, and scaled down if it was done per race. Even a few hundred thousand for a strong finish would be massive for lower-paid drivers who’ve got podiums or top-5s this year (e.g. Hadjar, Bearman, etc.). Suddenly, even the fight for 9th or 10th would really matter.

Max P1

Piastri P2

Norris DNF (or outside the top 10)

1p4q4tc,New F1 fan - trying to understand weird FIA penalties,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p4q4tc/new_f1_fan_trying_to_understand_weird_fia/,2025-11-23, Discussion,"As a new F1 fan, this double disqualification is really putting me off the sport. Like, I’m still learning a lot about it, but the whole thing feels very managed. And it’s not even just this — it’s also like all the random penalties that are inconsistent throughout the season.

Like, Oscar Piastri gets a 10-second penalty because he braked and had a lock-up, but he was trying to avoid a collision. And then Max gets the same 10-second penalty for an intentional collision into George Russell. It’s like, all of the points… I mean, there’s the performance and the car (and you get points from having a good car and being a good driver, that’s all there) but then a lot of the point shifts and changes in drivers standings come down to FIA decision-making. Like, I feel like they manipulate it a lot.

Maybe I don’t fully understand how it works, but I feel like you can go from a good weekend on you’ve deserved on merit to a bad weekend on a technicality almost consistently. I feel like there are plenty of DSQs already. Not that DSQ is bad in itself; it’s just so marginal. Like, I don’t get how you disqualify two people over a 0.03 difference in width. I guess maybe that might affect pace and give an advantage, but I feel like there should be a materiality-type concept — like within a certain range. But 0.03 just seems like… how much pace could that really give them? And if that was giving them that much pace, then why were they not faster? Both of the cars were dropping down in pace  compared to other cars, so they were clearly not as quick as you’d think if they had, I guess, illegal parts.

I mean, I don’t know. I just kind of feel like it feels very managed, very manipulated by FIA penalties and stuff. And half the time a penalty goes out, people can’t agree who should get a penalty or who shouldn’t. Like the Hamilton penalty — if it happens in lap 1 turn one then it’s okay; if it happens in later in the race then it’s not okay. The same thing happens in one part of the race and doesn’t get penalized, then another person does it and suddenly it’s penalized. Like, I don’t get it. Sometimes things even get overlooked if nobody reports them like Charles  cut the corner in the sane race where Hamilton penalised but nothing happened to him because the team did not care but like if it was against the rules shouldn’t be penalised regardless.

And can’t they separate the driver from the team? Like, if the team fucked up, why does the driver have to be punished for it? Fine, punish or charge the team. Why is it a thing to like… And the same with Ferrari as well. I’m not even talking about McLaren — I don’t have any specific fandom. I’m just new and looking at it, and I feel like maybe I’m just new to sports and don’t really understand how it works. Because I haven’t really followed many sports, so I don’t know if other sports are also like this.

But I kind of feel like it’s very managed. Like, the champions — I mean, not all of them — but winning or losing can sometimes be on a marginal technical thing that has nothing to do with pace or merit or effort. And it just feels very managed and manipulated.","["">Like, I don’t get how you disqualify two people over a 0.03 difference in width.\n\nBecause you have to draw the line somewhere, and if you cross that line your car simply isn't legal per the rules anymore, so it makes sense that you can't run it and do get disqualified if you do.
