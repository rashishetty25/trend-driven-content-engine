1o8vy58,A warning about ticket prices and r/GrandPrixTravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o8vy58/a_warning_about_ticket_prices_and_rgrandprixtravel/,2025-10-17, Moderator Response,"Posting here because this is all about the mod of r/GrandPrixTravel and the kickbacks from a site called P1 Travel.  The sub is generally quite helpful but has a rule that any reselling of tickets at excessive prices will be removed.  And the mod, the single mod is always posting referral links (which he gets money for) to P1 Travel. The issue is the prices P1 Travel askes.  Lets take Suzuka which is on sale now:

B1 stand, officially 63,000yen turns into 132,000yen on P1... More than double. Then looking at the C stand + hotel package. It comes to 852.90 Euro going by the Japanese prices for everything you get, but the price is **€2,084** on P1 Travel**.**  More than a 2x price increase certainly seems excessive and into scalper territory for me. 

The biggest issue I have with this is sometimes I see people recommending to buy tickets from that site over official sales sites.  Pay double.. why? 

Before paying anything to any site, check official pricing first and ask yourself if you want to pay such a markup. And on seeing links anywhere on social media, check if they are paid links and then ask if the info you are getting is unbiased. ","['Thanks for bringing up this issue. We (r/formula1) used to redirect ticket and travel related questions to r/GrandPrixTravel. This was added after the mod of GrandPrixTravel suggested this in 2021 via ModMail\n\nIn February of 2025 we noticed that GrandPrixTravel has been **seemingly** monetized. They were stating that P1 Travel is a ""*community verified ticket vendor*"" of GrandPrixTravel and their subreddit was full of what appeared to be affiliate links for P1 Travel. We found these links in the following places on /r/GrandPrixTravel:\n\n* In the sidebar\n* At the top of their wiki page for official circuit websites\n* At the top of their monthly buy/sell threads\n* In standalone mod-made posts\n* In AutoModerator comments triggered by certain keywords\n\nSome of these links were paired with messages pointing out that some other ticket websites are not fully reliable. In addition we also noticed heavy promotion of FanAmp, an app.\n\nWhen we became aware of all of this in February **we stopped the r/formula1 AutoModerator from redirecting users with ticket & travel related questions to r/GrandPrixTravel and removed links to that subreddit from our sidebar.**\n\nWhile GrandPrixTravel can be a useful resource we considered that it would not be appropriate to continue recommending it given these issues, especially since [Reddit\'s Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct) clearly prohibits *""moderation actions (including actions taken using mod tools, bots, and other services) in exchange for any form of compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from or on behalf of third parties""*\n\nEdit: And obviously the r/formula1 mod team is in no way affiliated with the /r/GrandPrixTravel mod team', 'I made it to my personal mission to downvote that stupid mod every time I see it and the “hi here is X from P1travel” comments (this seemed to have stopped showing up)\n\nI will always recommend that people buy from the race tracks and only from the race tracks maybe F1 if they are desperate but the resellers are a no go imo…', ""The question is, why hasn't somebody reported the subreddit for violating [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct), if this behavior has been occurring for awhile now.

Resellers are for people who don't want to or can't/haven't done that.\n\nFor some circuits, resellers may end up cheaper than dynamic pricing (looking at you Melbourne!) - I think we paid almost double face value from the circuit for Brabham tickets (my parents were coming over from the UK so we were prepared to pay that as we wanted to secure the tickets).""]",351,19,0.97,351,344,344,2,0,0.0,2

There will be drivers on hotlaps, and ZERO sector timings being shown on the screen, while the camera is focused on a car doing an inlap or outlap.

If anyone from F1 production is somehow reading this: This is not difficult. You need to do two things.

1. Show the lap times for the entire session.
2. Show the sector times of the next 3 drivers to finish a hotlap.

Please for the love of god just do these two things. It doesn't even require interaction, it should all be automatic. I should not be required to pull up the timings on my phone just so I can see this BASIC information.

When Hulk won and the crowd was happily cheering him on “Hulk, Hulk, Hulk”, Daddy got annoyed and starting chanting “Lando, Lando, Lando” in retort to them. Plus he’s one of England’s most wealthy men. \n\nMaybe some media people feel similar dislike to Lando’s family/privilege and unconsciously form a bias against him in their reporting', ""The graphs are all right. Your post isn't anti-Lando enough though, so you'll get downvoted to hell."", ""If the data don't show what you want them to, you fudge the stats like we always do.\xa0"", 'Yup, it appears to be a season-long running average over time, which seems silly to use in this case.']",0,38,0.38,0,166,166,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
1o9h1is,Ferrari confusion and issues,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o9h1is/ferrari_confusion_and_issues/,2025-10-17, Discussion,"What has happened to Ferrari? Last few races Charles has gone from fighting for podiums to fighting with Lewis for p8-10 in quali. 

It’s as if they’ve made his car slower to make Lewis look better or simply they’ve gone direction of what Lewis likes and it’s still not producing results for either driver now.  

I’m not Lewis hater but Ferrari is just terrible and not improving like the other top teams. ","[""Love this one.\n\nFerrari is making their car worse so Lewis can drive it?\n\nMaybe the car is just absolutely terrible and Lewis just finally got used to being at a new team and is performing how he's performed his entire career in a bad car. \n\nThe fact they're both doing terrible shows the car is terrible."", 'Lmao what. \n\nRedBull and Merc brought working upgrades and Ferrari brought side to pretty much just mostly down grades.', '""It’s as if they’ve made his car slower to make Lewis look better"" Lmao holy DTS haha', 'I think its as simple as the car hasnt improved and Lewis is just more comfortable in it. If you see their interviews, Charles is saying eveything is doomed and the car is bad and Lewis is talking about feeling better in it', 'So....Ferrari deliberately sabotaged one of the best drivers on the grid in Leclerc simply to make Hamilton ""look better"".  It couldn\'t be that once it became clear that McLaren was running away with the constructors, all development on the 2025 cars across the grid pretty much stopped.  No.....it\'s has to be something nefarious.  That\'s the only plausible explanation.', 'This car is an utter POS', ""Your whole second paragraph is unfounded nonsense.\n\n\nThe Ferrari sucks. It's not great. It's slow. The brakes fail. The ride height will tear the plank up just for riding one set of tyres too long. The car is a shitbox. They made a bad move. And like anything post 2021, you cannot just overhaul the car midseason and it's not like they would want to with the end certain and 2026 coming.\n\n\nThe car sucks. If the car was good, they would not sabotage if Leclerc was having success and Hamilton slogged, or vice versa. The car is simply shit. Slow and weak."", 'This has to be rage bait right?', 'The last upgrade they gave this car was the same one that gave Charles his only pole this season in the same quali where Lewis didn’t make it out of Q3. The teams who kept developing afterwards simply caught up to Ferrari while Lewis is probably just making his own progress adapting to the car. \n\nAll the upgrades are publically listed, Ferrari hasn’t made any significant changes to the car since Charles got pole.', ""I just think they've given up on fixing what is a fundamental problem with the rear suspension (their fault for making the switch the last year of this ruleset) and are all in on 2026. They have nothing to fight for, Lewis already has one foot in his retirement plan and Charles is speaking to other teams about a 2027 switch if Ferrari's last roll of the dice to be good in 26 doesn't work.""]",0,27,0.18,0,26,26,0,7,-0.03,0
