Don\'t just want to watch for the fun of it but actually be a ""fan"" of a team and driver. Thought I will watch the whole season and then decide who I want to support.

Ferrari and McLaren come to mind for ""historical"" teams. Ferrari were good initially and in the end but fell off mid season. McLaren were shit to start off but were brilliant after Miami. And I know this is a sport with a lot of nuance. I mean Ferrari haven\'t won a championship for so long, Mercedes were well on to till 2021 and how they have fallen.\n\nSo I do understand that a team will have dominating season but also mid seasons. As for the driver, I\'ll be honest, Carlos was the reason I started watching because he himself is a Real Madrid supporter. He had a decent season, am sad that he is going to Williams but let\'s hope he has a Brawn x Button season. I will support Carlos but I want another guy who can win a championship. (Carlos can win but doesn\'t have the car)\n\nI have narrowed down to Charles and Oscar. I like Max but idk don\'t feel like supporting him or Hamilton in fact because I just feel like it\'s a rivalry before I started watching F1. Russell seems a bit of a Karen. Norris idk he\'s good but everyone talks about his mentality and I agree with that. I mean Charles, Carlos, Hamilton anyone is winning the championship in that Car.\n\nHelp me guys!!!

Would it be better to buy tickets for all three days, or just for the race itself?

How‚Äôs the general admission experience? Is it worth upgrading to a grandstand seat, or is GA good enough?

I think gates open at 8am, but you should aim to arrive before then, otherwise your chances of finding a good place to sit are slim.\n\n* I don't know how you plan to get there, but the roads will be rammed and the Park & Ride is a bad idea. Parking at the circuit is expensive but worth it unless you like the idea of spending 4 hours waiting in a queue for the bus after the race (maybe it'll be better next year, but that's what happened to us this year)\n\n* In terms of seating, if you go GA, bring camping chairs. You don't want to be sat on wet grass if it rains. We sat on the grass area by the Vale chicane and had a good view of the action, and they have a massive broadcast screen as well. It also meant we were able to get on the track to see the podium since the only entrance they open is there.\n\n* Grandstand seats will be a better experience, but for me personally it's not worth the massive cost.
