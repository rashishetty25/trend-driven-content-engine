The four-time F1 champion and eternal rival of Ayrton Senna, did not like the TV series dedicated to the Brazilian driver published at the end of November on the online streaming platform. At the end of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Carlo Vanzini interviewed Prost together with the editorial staff of Sky Sport F1. Among the various questions about the race, the commentator asked him for his opinion on the TV series.

The French pilot's response was rather irritated: ""It bothers me a lot that you feel the need to change history, when someone is no longer alive. Ayrton Senna's is a great story and there is no need to tell things that are not true. Not even Ayrton would have liked all this: this series is a fiction. It seems that there is no more sensitivity, because we try to market everything. I don't like at all that this is done with the name Senna"". A rather counter-concurrent judgment given the substantially positive reviews and the enthusiasm that the TV series on the Brazilian legend has aroused in all fans of the four wheels. Evidently according to Prost some narrated episodes (maybe those that dwell on him?) They wouldn't reflect reality. And he adds that the attempt to spectacularize Senna's life is wrong. It's possible that it's true, but in fact it's the risk you run every time you try to romanticize the story of a myth.


What do you think?","['Tbf both documentary and series portray Prost as an evil person (which is quite exaggerated) and Senna as a saint (which is far from the truth).', ""Series are shit. It's hagiography in it's purest sense. Senna could do no wrong, if he lost the others cheated. Repeat. Insert divine right to win, because he is Senna. Repeat."", ""I believe this with all my heart: there are plenty of good, sufficient, historically accurate documentaries about Senna on YT already.\n\nNetflix just wanted a quick cashgrab which in the case of a driver who's passed away 30 years ago is downright disgusting."", ""As a Brazilian, I grew extremely tired of Senna's apotheosis by the media. I'm proud that so many regard him as one of the greats, if not the greatest, but it's too much. I don't see him as someone who's faultless, and I dislike when people revere him as some god. He had flaws and hate the victim complex people assign him when other drivers would challenge him. This was completely unnecessary, on top of being very cheap and poorly made."", ""I'll be honest I don't even know the full details of that era of racing and quite frankly, watching it you can tell the series is heavily biased.

How good do we think it really was? Specifically, do we think Schumacher could have won the world championship in it?\n\nBefore having watched the mid 90s retrospectively, I thought Ferrari spent the period on a gradual upward curve and that 1995 was really quite similar to 1994 for them, but that really wasn‚Äôt the case at all. \n\nThe 94 car was generally third fastest throughout the year thanks to having the best engine in the sport. It was good at anything resembling a power circuit, a legit frontrunner at the Hockenheims and Monzas of the world, but a bit lacking at handling-dependent circuits like Monaco, Catalunya and Hungary, where the McLaren was clearly a better package.\n\nIn 95 Ferrari scored the same number of wins and podiums and only two points more than in 94, but watching the races tells an entirely different story. The 95 Ferrari was competitive virtually everywhere and could feasibly have won six races rather than just one. Berger led before a botched pit stop at Imola, Alesi led very early when he broke down at Spa, Monza they had a 1-2 before the camera catastrophe, at the Nurburgring Alesi had a 40 second lead but couldn‚Äôt hold on in the closing laps and then at Suzuka Alesi was fighting Schumacher for the lead when he suffered mechanical failure.\n\nObviously there were nuances with all five of the above races that put the Ferrari in a position to win (Schumacher and Hill colliding at Monza and the team getting the strategy bang on at the Nurburgring just two examples) and it is also probably fair to say Alesi had his best year in 95 but still it was shocking to me to find out how good the 95 Ferrari was. Schumacher never looked anything like winning six races in the 96 car so that says a lot. What do we think? How good was the 95 Ferrari really?', 'A question about garage order in 2025. I thought the order is WCC standing order from last year. For 2025 is McLaren - Ferrari - Red Bull and so on. But someone said it could be McLaren - Red Bull - Ferrari and so on because Max is WDC in 2024. Anyone has thought?', 'What makes two comparably fast cars have different rates of tyre degradation?', 'It\'s been 5 days since Papa Perez promised to release a list of ""bad journalists"", which is more days than Perez had podium finishes this season.', ""Dude, did you not get the rota? It's YOUR turn."", 'I think Schumacher likely would have won the title in the 1995 Ferrari, but by a smaller margin than he did in the Benetton. Although Ferrari were quicker than Benetton, they were also less reliable, with Alesi having 6 mechanical failures to Schumacher‚Äôs 1. Herbert ended up beating Alesi and Berger which I think was unlikely to happen unless Benetton had the better car (when Alesi and Herbert were teammates in 1998 Alesi easily had the upper hand).\n\nBy saying Schumacher would have won in the Ferrari I am not saying Alesi was bad. It is simply that Schumacher was just above the other drivers of the 1990s. Alesi was still one of the best drivers of 1995, if not the second best. Only Schumacher could have won the title in the 1995 Ferrari.', ""Max' WDC has no impact on the garage order."", ""It's a really interesting topic that you could probably do multiple PhD theses on.\n\nThe short, top-level answer - in general, tyre degradation is linked heavily to how much the tyres are sliding as they complete a lap. If the specific design of a car means its driver ends up sliding the tyres more compared to another car achieve the same lap time, usually their degradation will be worse.\n\nPretty much every aspect of the car's design has an impact on that, with suspension and aerodynamics being two of the largest contributors."", ""It is possible for me to run as fast as Usain Bolt if he slows down to my pace. We will be equal in speed, but I'm going to get tired a loooot quicker. Just because we were running the same pace, doesn't mean we're equally fast.\n\nBecause of how important tyre management is, the drivers are driving as conservatively as possible. If someone is much quicker than the driver behind, they're not going to lap 1 second faster all race long, but rather slow down by 1 second, which would mean they lap equally to the driver behind. Equal lap times, but the driver in front does it by driving carefully, while the driver behind is giving it everything. Just like I'll get tired before Bolt, the driver behind will ruin his tyres quicker than the driver ahead, despite running equal times.""]",3,13,0.64,3,12,12,1,1,0.040000000000000036,1

Given the way the FIA and more specifically MBS are going at the moment I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much longer before we see talk of another breakaway series again. F1 doesn‚Äôt need the FIA to survive but the FIA does need F1 to survive. Keen to hear others thoughts on this tbh","[""It wouldn't be able to be called F1 without the FIA"", '>F1 doesn‚Äôt need the FIA to survive\n\nF1 belongs to the FIA; the FOM just has a lease for the commercial rights. If FOM decided to break away, that would open a real can of worms of legal issues. \n\nFor starts, the name alone. They probably wouldn\'t be able to call themselves F1 anymore. Fine, let\'s imagine they come up with some new name like ""GP1"", ""GP World Series"", ""Formula X"", whatever. Basically, a whole new brand. Sponsors, race promoters etc might now say ""Hang on, we\'re paying to be in Formula 1, not some \'GP1\' series. We\'ll gladly get a new contract with you though, if we don\'t have to pay as much."" Income and, therefore, profit, suddenly drops massively. For *everyone* involved.\n\nYou may also have a problem with the cars. As F1 is owned by the FIA, so are the regulations. Would a new breakaway-series even be allowed to use the current F1 ruleset? Would they have to come up with one on their own? Probably the latter. But with potentially lower income, you\'d need to make sure things get a lot cheaper.\n\n>but the FIA does need F1 to survive\n\nThat\'s also a very bold take IMO. Yes, the FIA\'s own income would probably also shrink, but as a non-profit it doesn\'t have to constantly grow financially. There still are several other world championships under the FIA after all. Besides, they could also just make a new series called ""F1"". Arguably this wouldn\'t be as successful as the current one, not for a while at least, as likely most of the people involved would switch series. But even that isn\'t a given. Who knows, maybe some teams would rather stay with the actual FIA F1, hoping that their experience helps against any new teams in this new F1?\n\n\nGenerally speaking, as much criticism as the FIA (or rather MBS in particular) is getting, I think the importance of having a governing body whose main goal is not pure profit is sometimes underappreciated. Remember that Andretti\'s/Cadillac\'s entry originally was rejected *by FOM/F1 themselves*, while the FIA gladly welcomed them. An ever-growing calendar as well as sprint races - both ideas that aren\'t *hugely* popular with fans - also come from FOM/F1 rather than the FIA.', ""F1 does need the FIA as without the FIA there is literally no F1.\n\nThe FIA are the people who run the championship. Sure, Liberty could create some other similar series, but they'd have to figure out how to do everything themselves and would lose their world championship status, all their history and their brand which is why it's all bluffing and not a real threat.""]",0,4,0.2,0,3,3,0,0,-0.009999999999999981,0
