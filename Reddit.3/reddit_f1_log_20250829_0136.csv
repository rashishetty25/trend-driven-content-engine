1n2eblr,[OC] A visualisation of driver turnover for every team since their last major ownership change,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n2eblr/oc_a_visualisation_of_driver_turnover_for_every/,2025-08-28, Discussion,"Even though this year‚Äôs silly season may be very quiet, I wanted to see the movement of drivers between teams and how true certain stereotypes are (looking at Red Bull and RB changing drivers like they are trading cards). Which team do you think has handled driver changes the best (or worst) in recent years?  


A few quick notes and takeaways:

* The decision for the cutoff point being each team‚Äôs last major ownership change was because (at least in theory) the ownership would have some decision making power and thus the results would represent the most recent team policy. Let me know if you want to see the all-time results but that will probably take a while.
* The common perception that Red Bull has a systematic, ruthless policy of ‚Äúperform immediately or be replaced‚Äù, seems to hold some truth, but much of it stems from their junior team, which is used as the testing ground for executing the strategy.¬†
* It looks like Red Bull, at least for their 2nd driver, follow patterns similar to other teams.
* Alpine‚Äôs 2nd seat looks increasingly unstable recently. Doohan has already been replaced by Colapinto, whose seat is now under pressure.
* 2025 was one of the biggest shuffles in recent history. After a completely static grid in 2024, half the grid in 2025 is drivers in new seats.

I thought I would share the fantasy league that myself and five friends have been playing, and how it‚Äôs working out so far.

A little back story, there are six of us that work together at a fire station, and we are huge fans of F1, but everyone‚Äôs knowledge of the details varies. I wanted to come up with a fantasy game that gave everyone a good chance of points each weekend. So here it is.

First I made a board along with everyone‚Äôs names attached to some Velcro. In order to determine picking order, each week we race the PS4 game at the designated track. This also helps when watching the race because you feel like you really know the track. None of us are huge gamers so it‚Äôs sort of the great equalizer. Occasionally we have people gone on vacation or we were too busy at work to accomplish practice and qualifying sessions. In those cases we draw names from a hat and do a running pick either via text or FaceTime.

Once quali has determined picking order, everyone gets to choose ONE team and TWO drivers. The number one pick chooses EITHER one team, or one driver. Then the second person goes and so on. Once the 6th person picks their first pick, they pick again, then picking goes in reverse order, and back down again. (Ex: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2‚Ä¶6)

Picking first is obviously a big advantage, but it does not necessarily mean you will have the best combined score for the weekend. Everyone‚Äôs points for the weekend are added up at the end and we get to look forward to the next race on the calendar. 

The game has been a big success. It‚Äôs relatively still close at the summer break. We also added a race on the calendar where you‚Äôll see Andretti on the calendar. This is a karting facility nearby where we physically went together and raced for points. Each weekend you end up cheering for new drivers and teams which keeps it exciting. This format has worked out so much better than I planned, and it‚Äôs really given us a whole new level of enjoyment this season. Hope you enjoy our shenanigans. Glad break is over. Lights out and away we go!

1n2rcye,Schumacher & Hill 1994,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n2rcye/schumacher_hill_1994/,2025-08-28, Discussion,"I want to do this post as a way of proving something rather unpopular (to my own amusement). The general consensus in here seems to be that Schumacher did not deserve the championship, when in reality it was Hill who, even with the clear faster car, the FIA and the media on his side, couldn‚Äôt battle with Schumacher with 4 races less.

I‚Äôm going to go race by race proving how this general idea is just wrong:

Races 1-4: Senna and the early Season

Upon the start of the 1994 season, Senna (past his prime already) although struggling was outpacing Hill by an alarming margin, the first 3 races saw how Hill got severely outpaced by more than 0.7% (even reaching 2% at the first qualy in Brazil), the race pace was no different, we saw that in Brazil were before Senna's DNF, Hill already got lapped by lap 50. Without Senna nothing changed in Monaco where he got outqualified by an inferior Ferrari and Mclaren, and crashed into Hakkinen on turn one retiring on the spot.

Races 5-8: First win and first ""real"" controversy

In Spain Hill gets his first victory, a race where he won due to Schumacher's problem with the gearbox, where he had to do almost 2/3 of the race stuck in 5th gear.

Canada and France came and with that 2 appalling qualifying sessions, being just 0.1% infront of a rookie and a 41 year old driver that came out of retirement, although in favor of him, he clearly outpaced them in the race, but this was not enough to beat a Schumacher at his best and even though he had the faster car in both cases, he came behind.

Great Britain came and with that the first ""real"" controversy, Schumacher overtook Hill on the formation laps, something done also by other drivers but ignored (eg: Hakkinen clearly overtook Alesi), that was not allowed and that 5 second stop/go penalty was deserved, what clearly was not was the DSQ which only ocurred due to FIA not communicating correctly with Benetton (the penalty was first believed to be for a non existant false start and later rectified), that and the 2 race ban was just a farce needed to keep the interest in F1 alive because of Schumacher's domination of the season and the lack of champions in the grid (which was one of the reasons Williams called Mansell to race again).

Races 9-13: Hill's ""Golden"" Run

In Germany he crashed into Katayama and had to pit and fall to the back of the grid not getting any points in a crucial race where Schumacher had to retire due to an engine failure.

In Hungary he could only achieved second against a mighty Schumacher (although to be fair he had slightly the worse car).

Fast forward to Belgium, Italy and Portugal, the latter 2 without Schumacher, this 3 races (and the others I've pointed out) were very important in the point I am stressing, in them, Hill was outpaced by a rookie teammate and only ended up ahead due to team orders prioritizing him, 3 race wins in a row where team orders and heavy luck came in handy since he also won due to Ferrari's mechanical DNF's in both Italy and Portugal were even without Schumacher he was unable to win fair and square.

Race 14-16: Title Deciders

At Jerez, Schumacher came back and Hill went back to the same old not being able to take the battle to him even though he had the faster car.

In Suzuka he was benefited with the SC and subsequent red flag due to Schumacher's low fuel strategy that was characteristic of the Benetton team, this allowed Hill to run on free air which ultimately gave him the victory (more luck for Hill).

In came Australia, again Hill, unable to deliver saw how (again with the faster car) his teammate got pole and his (artificially fabricated) title contender qualified in front of him. Here is where I have to say that although I firmly think the crash was not deliberate it was totally Schumacher's fault.

Now with this context in mind let's get some data (team performance table and championship points):

https://preview.redd.it/91zj4enleulf1.png?width=1877&format=png&auto=webp&s=af1e4b4234fc867df3632cb81a54b322ebd27221

To not be accused of being biased I've excluded the team orders and included Belgium DSQ (although the two tables are available)

If we correct the bad luck and remove the team orders, Schumacher could‚Äôve sealed the championship as early as Belgium, five races before the end. In that context, the 2 race ban wouldn‚Äôt have mattered.

So in conclusion, all this data (which is just a miniscule of all that there is) proves just the opposite of the general idea. 1994 should be hailed as one of Schumacher's greatest seasons. Hill, even while having the car, the FIA, and the media on his side, he still couldn‚Äôt deliver.","[""Regardless of how you got there, if you have to resort to cheating, you don't deserve whatever you win."", 'The very first part:\n\n>I want to do this post as a way of proving something rather unpopular (to my own amusement).

Again, you\'re not proving anything here.\n\n2. Senna was anything but past his prime. He just came off a season in which he had performed racing miracles. And he was immediately completely dominating his incumbent teammate. Ask anyone on the current grid who changed teams how easy peasy that is. \n\nThe man did one spin exploring the limits of the flawed, not yet correctly developed treacherous car, in order to give it all and win in front of his home crowd, and it gets used as being ""proof"" of being over the hill by self-proclaimed general prosecutors.\n\nNeedless to say, I stopped reading after the quoted stuff.', 'Hill was no all time great but I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôve decided to savage him here. \nWhy say nothing about illegal traction control and illegal modifications to fuelling rigs that Schumacher benefited from? Schumacher might have been the better driver and would be deserving of the championship if he‚Äôd not crashed into Hill deliberately.', 'Senna past his prime with 3/3 pole positions to start 1994? Never heard anyone say Hill deserved that championship but all of the cheating and lack of sportsmanship casts a dark cloud over Schumacher‚Äôs first title.', ""I think some journalists summarised perfectly at the time as 'the right champion, the wrong way'."", ""Yeah there was an insane number of attempts to interfere with the championship and help Williams out that year.   \n  \nThey really didn't like the idea of this upstart young German in a team owned by a clothing company taking on a grandee team that first suffered a horrific tragedy and were then led by a great British hope and son of a heroic figure.\n\nIn reality Hill was not remotely close to being in the same league as Schumacher if you look at it objectively, as you point out."", 'A Michael Schumacher defense post? Did I time travel to [Grandprix.com](http://Grandprix.com) forums in 2004 or something?', 'Completely agree with that,the narrative that Hill even remotely deserved to win that championship is ridiculous.', 'schumi won because the fia didnt have the balls to give a points penalty for the intentional crash, even tho that would have been proper']",0,23,0.29,0,21,21,0,23,0.29,0
