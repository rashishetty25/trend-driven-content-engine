Are we stupid?\n\nNow, the real question being, realistically how much smaller can F1 cars get nowadays while maintaining its current safety capabilities and speed? Size wise 2026 looks promising, but I want more!', ""They introduced length restrictions for 2022, with reducing the wheelbase to 3.6m and are continuing on it for 2026 with 3.4m and reducing the width to 1.9m (still a step away from 1999 to 2016 1.8m width).  \nThe front and rear overhang has been defined through crash structures since 2014.\n  \nSo we're already on track for smaller cars."", ""> while at the same time increasing to the max the width and length of the cars?  \n  \nHow are you coming to this conclusion?  \nThe last size increase through rules was in 2017 which increased the width to 2m, but for 2022 the wheelbase was limited to 3.6m and in 2026 it'll be 3.4m.  \n  \n> how much smaller can F1 cars get nowadays while maintaining its current safety capabilities and speed?  \n  \nThe first hybrid cars in 2014 were 4.8m long, compared to 5.8m we had in 2021 and 1.8m wide.  \nThe main reason for the length wise increase is that it allows more surface area for the teams to manage and create downforce meaning more speed carried through the corners and higher top speed for straights.  \nVenturi tunnels for 2022 allowed the downforce to be maintained - with a minor length reduction, but 2026 will likely reduce it notably, as we're going back to a flat floor which means less speed through corners.  \n  \n> How on earth have we decided to race more on narrower street circuits  \n  \nThis is mostly determined by who is willing to pay to host a grand prix, traditional circuits cannot afford or compete with oil money - who are willing to pay north of $50m per year, while traditional circuits are struggling to pay ~$30m per year (cota, spa, Silverstone, monza) and wouldn't be able to do this without government subsiding those events.  \n  \nThe regulations and decisions where to race don't go hand in hand.
