I’m curious if Ferrari, Mercedes, or Red Bull seem to have that in the cards this year, as it appeared that even McLaren in 2023 was not expecting the significant jump, which has also evolved into their dominance this year. I’m also cognizant that the regulation changes may mean that there is just less performance to get out of the car in 2025, than there was in ‘22 or ‘23.

Most changes on the sporting regulations are to largely bring them into line with the most recent updates (2025/04/30) of the 2025 regulations. Including the tyre regulations we had for Monaco this year.      
Some changes I did notice from a quick glance:       

* Grid drops at a driver's next race now have a 12 month period to serve them in. So Valtteri will be off the hook from his incident in the 2024 Abu Dhabi GP should he race next year.

* A document will be provided to all teams no later than the 30th June this year which details all the provisional information and limitations in regards to ERS-K usage and deployment for races, the following season. Any amendments will be confirmed by 15th September. Subsequent modifications may only be applied for new circuits or where this is a significant difference between vehicle fundamentals & FIA correlated values

* There is now a much easier to read list of Parc Ferme Permitted Works

I'm sure there are more.

Gearboxes have been made unlimited this year, and that will now be carried over to next year\'s cars. And there will be a new limited component group, PU-ANC (ancillary components), with a limit of 5 of each Power Unit ancillary component. So those should be specific components that are part of, for example, the ICE, but can now be changed without changing the ICE itself.\n\nAnd regarding energy management, I noticed that in the last issue of the regulations, **for qualifying only**, they increased the limit to the total allowable reduction of driver maximum power demand from 450kW to 600kW and the limit to the resulting electrical DC power of the ERS-K from above −100kW to above -250kW.\n\nWith this newest issue, the ""for qualifying only"" part has been removed.
