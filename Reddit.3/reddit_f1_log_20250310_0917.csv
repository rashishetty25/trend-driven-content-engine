&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

Piastri has the talent, but he couldn't deliver every weekend last year. But when he did, he was sometimes even faster than Lando.

However, when Norris had his Singapore-level pace‚Ä¶ nobody could catch him‚Äîexcept himself, almost crashing into the wall.

Can Norris handle the pressure if the car is the fastest and he has bad luck or poor performances? Or maybe we'll see Norris 2.0 with no mistakes, crushing everybody. Or maybe Piastri will get as comfortable as he was in the lower categories, where he won almost every race‚Ä¶

All in all, I'm very excited for the new season! Hopefully, it will be a tight season with more teams fighting for wins than just one.

I was impressed with his rookie season especially how cold and calculated he is, but it seems he just lacks speed.\n\nAll the ""killer-instinct"" in the world doesn\'t help you if your teammate is consistently 10s ahead of you in the race.', ""I don't think there was any point last year where Piastri was quicker than Norris across the whole race. Maybe 1 or 2 off-weekends..? Exception makes the rule though."", ""I just don't think he has the pace. Too many races where's he's pottering about a pit stop behind Norris.\n\nLook at Baku. He made a great move on Leclerc and won the race so you can't be too critical. But then look at the pace Norris had. Norris would have dominated that race and won it much easier than Piastri did. Good, but not top tier. That sums it up."", '2007 had two evenly matched drivers, and Rosberg was not that far off Lewis.

Yes, i think Abu dhabi last year should have killed all speculation', 'I can only see him winning WDC if no other team can challenge and Norris faces some monumental bad luck. Kinda like Danny beat Max in 2017 on points but lost h2h and was slower than Max.', 'I don‚Äôt think so. I don‚Äôt think he has the necessary raw speed. \n\nUltimately that‚Äôs still the number 1 requirement for an F1 driver. \n\nPiastri seems stronger mentally. He‚Äôs more aggressive when wheel to wheel and he doesn‚Äôt crack under pressure. None of that matters though when he qualifies behind Lando something like 75-80% of the time.  Then Lando can disappear off into the distance. \n\nIf Piastri can get that qualy ratio to something more like 50/50 then I think he‚Äôd have a great shot.

They don't have the sort of advantage over the field that Red Bull did in recent years and the front flex rules change dramatically after 9 races which could upend the pecking order at the front. Add to that a very strong teammate in Oscar who made a big jump from year 1 to 2 and Max not having to worry about a teammate taking points off him and I very much doubt Lando will dominate.
