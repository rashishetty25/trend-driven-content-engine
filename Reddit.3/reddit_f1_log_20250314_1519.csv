1jaie35,What is each current drivers best F1 season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jaie35/what_is_each_current_drivers_best_f1_season/,2025-03-13, Discussion,"So this popped into my head and I got thinking and wrote a list. But I'd love to hear what you all think. 
Here's my list. 

Max Verstappen - 2023 
What more is there to say. Yes you could make arguments for all his championship winning seasons for different reasons and usually I would pick winning a fight over domination but his donination was more than has ever been seen from a driver and statistically the greatest season in F1 history. 

Liam Lawson - 2023
Only tow choices and neither are full seasons, 2023 was so impressive when he came in, particularly Singapore. 2024 USA was just as good, but he wasn't beating Yuki as often in 24 so 23 it is. 

Lando Norris - 2021
Ok so Lando is an odd one in that all his seasons I'd rank pretty similar and he's never had a bad year. I chose 21 because of how impressive he was in the first half of the year (at summer break I think he was 3rd in standings) He also could have won a few races post summer break had things home differently. 

Oscar Piastri - 2024 
His run from Austria to Baku was truly incredible and his end of the season was nowhere near as bad as lots of people on here seem to think. He also had bad luck in a few races but still ranked fourth. 

Charles Leclerc - 2024 
This was actually a pretty clear winner. He did not make any of the mistakes that had blighted his previously great seasons and without the bad Ferrari summer run he could have won the championship. Winning in Monaco and Monza is amazing. 

Lewis Hamilton - 2020
His stretch from 18-20 is great but he never seemed quite as unstoppable as he did in 2020. He also beat Bottas better than in 2018 when Bottas had so much bad luck, and 2019 where both of them were on it. 

George Russell - 2024
So 2021 and 2022 are both strong contenders but his drives in Spa and Las Vegas as well as his qualifying demolition of the man with the most poles in F1 puts this first.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli - N/A

Fernando Alonso - 2012 
Fighting for the championship all the way to the end in what was usually the fourth best car is incredible and he deserved that title so much. 

Lance Stroll - 2020 
So Stroll was good in 17 but 2020 was different. He was fourth in the championship at mid season before he had a poor run until his finest hour when her got pole in Istanbul. He also got two podiums. 

Pierre Gasly - 2021 
How did he constantly qualify in the top six week in week out? He battered Yuki and git a podium in Baku as well as really strong P4s in Netherlands and Mexico 

Jack Doohan - 2024 (doesn't really count though) 

Esteban Ocon - 2017 
So Ocon actually had a few contenders, with 22 and 23 (which he got a fair bit of bad luck in) being strong. However 2017 takes it as he was really good in his first full season in F1 and looked like a driver who could challenge for a title in the future. He also could have got a podium in Canada of not for Perez.

Ollie Bearman - 2024 
Only did three races, and two of them were very good, Baku and Saudi. Though I don't rate Saudi quite as highly as most do. 

Yuki Tsunoda - 2024 
After an inconsistent 21 and a poor 22 he improved a lot in 23 before really coming on strong in 2024, topping the midfield numerous times at the start of the year and getting consistent points to the end.

Isack Hadjar - N/A 

Alex Albon - 2023 
Getting great points out of that car and destroying his team mate. His P7's were great as well as qualifying fourth in Zandvoort 

Carlos Sainz. Jr - 2019 
IMO he was easily a top three driver  that year with his constant best to the rest finishes earning him a thoroughly deserved sixth place in the standings spot following his podium in Brazil which is the second best midfield performance I have seen these last five years 

Nico Hulkenburg - 2014
So Hulkenberg is really difficult because loads of his seasons are solid but not spectacular. 2013 was great and I was really tempted to put 2018 here because he was best of the rest that year. But his mistakes in Baku and Spa held me back  and ultimately I think 2014 is his best. 
He finished in the top six in all but one of the first seven races in a force India and at one point he wa third in the championship standings. Only Hulkenburg could be third in the standings without a podium..

Gabriel Bortoleto - N/A
","[""In my opinion, Hamilton's best seasons are 2018, 2014 and 2015 in no particular order.\n\nI also think Leclerc's 2022 year is becoming a little bit underrated in hindsight. He had more pace than in 2024 IMO."", ""Good list, IMO Hamilton best season was 2018 (clearly the best driver that season despite not having the clear best car, unlike 2020), Ocon's best was 2021 (won a race, had worse luck than Alonso but was close to him in points despite that), Nico's was probably 2013 (51-6).\n\nAlso, for some drivers multiple seasons can apply (Max, Lando, Carlos, could even argue about Gasly with 2020) but the seasons in the list are probably the best ones IMO (or at least tied for that)."", 'I think 2008 and 2018 is better for Lewis Hamilton', ""Hamilton has had so many great seasons. It is hard to pick just one. I think 2018 will be the one for me. \n\nFor Max, I actually pick 2021 over 2023. He didn't have a completely dominant car and had to fight all season to beat Hamilton and Mercedes. All while dealing with the pressure of getting that first championship."", 'Aside from 2006 and 2012, I wanna add 2014 for Alonso. Dragging the sixth(?) best car of the grid within a couple laps of a race win in Hungary and nearly getting fifth in the championship is absurd.', 'What is with the love for Lewis‚Äô 2008? It‚Äôs one of his weakest seasons. For everyone saying ‚Äòit was only his second season‚Äô it would obviously be a great year by ordinary second season standards, but that glosses over his rookie year literally being better.\n\nAs great as he was at times - and he did hit some staggeringly high heights at races like Monaco, Silverstone and Hockenheim - we have to consider he got himself a grid penalty in Malaysia, the Alonso incident in Bahrain was really his fault for misjudging the closing speed, he had a lucky escape en route to winning Monaco, suffered complete brain fade in Canada and completely messed up the start in Japan. Aside from 2011, this is as patchy as a Lewis season gets. He ended up winning the title because it was arguably the weakest season of the last 20 years from a driving calibre perspective.', 'Call me crazy but I thought Fernando was pretty good when he beat Schumacher to two world titles..', 'Max - 2021, Lewis - 2018, Fernando - 2012', ""I'd say 2008/2018 and 2021 were better for Hamilton and Verstappen respectively. I'm not an F1 driver, may I shock you, but I assume it's much less pressure when you're far ahead of your mid-at-best teammate in a dominant car than when you're actually going wheel-to-wheel for the title against somebody. Dominant seasons are also impressive, but for me not as much as close battles.""]",40,144,0.7,40,777,777,-2,0,-0.010000000000000009,-2

It feels like we have a good chance to see a new world champion which is great. For me it‚Äôs between Lando and Charles, but Piastri could be the dark horse. He‚Äôs ruthless enough. Obviously writing off Verstappen and Red Bull is daft.\n\nI‚Äôm also really looking forward to seeing how Carlos gets on at Williams. They look like they have a decent car and it would be great to see him do well.\n\nFinally, I‚Äôm interested in how Verstappen takes on the challenge of not having a dominant car, now that he doesn‚Äôt have a significant lead. He can‚Äôt afford to take the risks he was towards the end of last season and I think there‚Äôs an exciting storyline there', 'I am new to F1 as a fan and the sport in general - interest piqued when over Xmas I got a virtual reality race sim and put over 100+ hours in a few months.\n\nJust looking for a summation of anything I should know!

You guys might be looking forward to rain for the chaos, I‚Äôm looking forward to the rain because it‚Äôs pretty much our first proper rain in multiple months. We've been slowly approaching [drought-like conditions over the last 12 months](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/maps/rainfall/?variable=rainfall&map=decile&period=12month&region=nat&year=2025&month=02&day=28) in this part of the country so any rain is good rain.\n\nThe weather in Melbourne is largely dictated by the direction of the wind, hot when the wind is coming from the deserts in the middle of the country to our north and cold when the wind is coming from the Southern Ocean and Antarctica to our south. Saturday is currently forecast to be 34¬∞C as we get the hot northerly desert winds ahead of the approaching Antarctic cold front. The cold front is then forecast to hit by Sunday morning, swinging the winds around to the S/SW and dragging up a much cooler air mass from down near Antarctica with the temperature forecast to be 20¬∞C and dropping for the start of the race.\xa0The winds are also likely to be reasonably gusty for the race with a fairly steep pressure gradient as the ridge of high pressure behind the front moves over the Great Australian Bight and pushes through into Melbourne.\n\nThere‚Äôll be rain and possible storms as the front passes through but we also quite often get fairly heavy intermittent showers for a few hours after the front passes as the cold Antarctic air interacts with the warmer waters of Port Phillip Bay, so I would say at this point it's likely that we're going to have at least a partially wet race. The showers behind the front can be pretty intense with occasional small hail but it was also a similar cold front setup around this time last year that brought severe storms and caused power outages that affected 500,000 homes and businesses so anything is possible.\n\nSome interesting links to keep track of our weather:  \nOffical forecast for Melbourne - [http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml)  \nOffical rain radar for the Melbourne region - [http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR024.loop.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR024.loop.shtml) (Albert Park is directly between the dots for Melbourne and St Kilda)  \nLatest official observations for the Melbourne region - [http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/melbourne.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/melbourne.shtml) (Melbourne (Olympic Park) is the closest station to Albert Park for most observations but St Kilda Harbour RMYS is marginally closer for wind observations)\n\nIt's definitely a weekend filled with the notorious 'Melbourne' weather that we're known for at least!"", ""I'm back with another update on the weather for Sunday!\n\nModels continuing to converge on an earlier solution for the passage of the front, with very heavy showers and thunderstorms in the late morning (some time between 0800 and 1200 local is most likely for rain onset, this time range will narrow as we get closer). Almost all models also agree in multiple rounds of lighter but still significant showers behind the front going through race time. Some of these models end these post-frontal rains right around 1500 local, and others keep it going into the evening, this will likely be the highest uncertainty going forward.\n\nI still think the biggest story, more than the rain, will be the extremely gusty winds and much cooler temperatures. It is nearly impossible to set up an F1 car to be fast in 40C temperatures and 15C temperatures simultaneously, not to mention the 50kph gusts possible during the race. Throw in a damp track or even light showers and you're talking about extremely challenging conditions to drive in.\n\nI suggest anyone reading this also scroll down and read u/Ryzi03's local insight into post-front showers as I believe it will be highly relevant for the race weather. Their comment provides a great look into what similar setups typically do in the area (something you can't get from me, who lives on the other side of the world)."", 'On F1tv, how do I get cockpit audio from e.g. Verstappen?

Zhou, in particular, is familiar with the Ferrari power unit, and he's a reliable driver. Perez also has a lot of experience, and he's been in multiple teams, including 2/3 of the top 3 teams, so he knows the different ways they are run and how they operate.

1jb5px4,[AMuS] Can Ferrari annoy the McLaren?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jb5px4/amus_can_ferrari_annoy_the_mclaren/,2025-03-14, News,,"['Full translation: \n\n> The McLaren were at the top of everyone‚Äôs tip sheets. If only because of their legendary long runs. On one lap, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris finished second and third, a good tenth of a second behind the day‚Äôs winner Charles Leclerc. Many experts believe that McLaren is just bluffing. Ferrari team boss Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur is not just clinging to Charles Leclerc‚Äôs best time. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt far away from McLaren in the long run either.‚Äù\n\n> The top speeds were also equal. They were only 0.5 km/h apart. Leclerc was a few hundredths of a second faster than Norris in all three sectors. The race simulations went to the Papaya cars with a slight advantage. Norris was the fastest with an average of 1m 21.903s over eleven laps on medium tyres.\n\n> Leclerc covered three more laps and averaged 1m 22.140s. However, he turned up the power on the last two laps. The picture is similar for his team-mates. Piastri completed eleven laps with an average time of 1m 22.110s. Hamilton averaged 1m 22.228s over 13 laps.\n\n> Where does Mercedes stand? \nMercedes team boss Toto Wolff assesses the situation as follows: ‚ÄúMcLaren is at the front. Then everyone else is in line.‚Äù The Austrian may have to make a correction when it comes to Ferrari. Even after the first day of practice, it is difficult to judge how strong the Silver Arrows themselves are. Mercedes bucked the trend with hard tyres in the long run.\n\n> The engineers were surprised that everyone else opted for medium tyres. They are not worried about this. Continuous rain is forecast for Sunday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll only need rain tyres or intermediates anyway.‚Äù\n\n> George Russell equalled Norris‚Äô long run best time by just a few hundredths on the hard rubber. Andrea Kimi Antonelli put in a decent performance for his first endurance run under real-life conditions. On his fastest lap, the 18-year-old Italian was still four tenths behind his team-mate.\n\n> Explanation: ‚ÄúIt was the first time I had driven with C5 tyres. I didn‚Äôt get them into the window perfectly.‚Äù In general, the Mercedes drivers struggled with Pirelli‚Äôs softest compound. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt gain as much time as we should have. This was possibly due to the asphalt temperatures of over 40 degrees,‚Äù analysed Russell.\n\n> Another explanation is that both Mercedes drivers were too aggressive on their fast laps and then paid for it in the final sector with rear tyres that were too hot. A modest engine mode cost an additional 0.35 seconds over the competition on the straights.\n\n> Should Verstappen be worried? \nThe Formula 1 world champion was quite satisfied with the first practice session. He was four tenths behind Lando Norris in fifth place, although he was held up by Carlos Sainz on his lap. The Dutchman did not have a clean lap in afternoon practice either. After a mistake in turn 3, he abandoned the attempt. He later laboured his way up to seventh place. The gap to the leader was 0.624 seconds.\n\n> The champion then spent 13 minutes in the pits before tackling his long run on medium tyres, which turned into a short run with nine minutes remaining. The set-up was changed during the break. Different front wings were also used. ‚ÄúWe made the car worse compared to the first practice session,‚Äù lamented Head of Sport Helmut Marko.\n\n> The instability in some corners returned. According to their own calculations, McLaren is ahead by three tenths. Ferrari and Verstappen follow. One indication that the Red Bull RB21 still has its moods is the large gap of Liam Lawson. The New Zealander lost six tenths on one lap and 1.2 seconds on the long run to his team captain. ‚ÄúThat should be a little less,‚Äù hoped Marko.\n\n> How good are Toro Rosso and Williams?\nIn the opening session, Williams continued its show from the test drives with first and sixth places for Carlos Sainz and Alexander Albon. Team Principal James Vowles warned: ‚ÄúWe are significantly better than last year, but not as good as it looks.‚Äù In the second session, Sainz and Albon finished eleventh and twelfth with exactly the same lap time, just outside the top 10.\n\n> The blue cars performed differently in the long run. Albon went out twice for five laps each and looked correspondingly good. Sainz finished seventh in the endurance runs. From a Williams driver‚Äôs perspective, five tenths of a second behind the McLaren is not a disaster.\n\n> While Williams surprised in the first session, Toro Rosso set the tone in the second. Yuki Tsunoda finished the session in fourth place, just 0.345 seconds behind the best time. Rookie Isack Hadjar also impressed. Sixth place despite a handicap.\n\n> The Frenchman already cut a fine figure in the morning. But the excellent times came at the price of less petrol and a higher power mode. Hadjar was supposed to practise in the qualifying trim. There was no time for this during the tests. Marko estimates: ‚ÄúWilliams is ahead of us.‚Äù\n\n> Has Haas gambled away? \nThat was a real slap in the face for Haas. Oliver Bearman destroyed his car in a high-speed accident in the 220 km/h chicane in the first practice session. It was not ready for the second practice session. Esteban Ocon finished penultimate in both sessions. 1.6 seconds off the lead and three tenths off the rest.\n\n> The Frenchman complained about balance problems. The engineers were able to solve some of these between the two practice sessions. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs still more to come,‚Äù demanded Ocon. The US Ferrari‚Äôs understeer cannot be completely eradicated. So far, no setup trick has helped. It will probably be up to the aerodynamicists.\n\n> Sauber showed an improvement compared to the test, which Nico H√ºlkenberg underlined with eighth place. The German‚Äôs race simulation was also impressive. With an average of 1:22.592 minutes, the Sauber driver was in the sandwich of the Toro Rosso drivers. Gabriel Bortoleto was sent out on the track with an alternative setup with significantly more downforce. It was a failure. Conclusion: The new parts are starting to work. The car has become much more consistent.\n\n> Are the cars or the track that fast? \nLast year‚Äôs time was beaten by 1.2 seconds in the first practice session and by eight tenths in the second. The reason for this lies in the track and the tarmac. The drivers reported that the track surface offered more grip from the start than before.\n\n> The many support races that put rubber on the track at Albert Park played a positive role here. The rest of the time is spent developing the cars. Sauber Technical Director James Key confirms: ‚ÄúThese cars are real monsters. We‚Äôve never seen so much downforce in Formula 1 as today.‚Äù']",1,3,0.53,1,1,1,1,3,0.53,1
1jaztyu,Why is Hamilton Being Given So Much Leeway to Adjust?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jaztyu/why_is_hamilton_being_given_so_much_leeway_to/,2025-03-14, Discussion,"It seems odd to me that one of the most experienced and succesful drivers of all time in lewis Hamilton is having so much leeway given to him by the media and fans in needing ""time to adapt"" and talking about it so much himself.

We don't give this leeway to other drivers (outside of rookies) and don't hear other drivers moaning about it.

Sainz is striaight up to speed at Williams, Ocon and Hulkenberg are expected to be straight on it with their new teams.

But all we hear about and from Hamilton is how hard the transition is and how it is going to take him time to get upto speed.

What is going on here? We didn't hear this when Hamitlon went to Mercedes in 2013, he was on the pace right away beating Rosberg.

Is this signs of Hamilton's age and pace beginning to wane and everyone is in denial or am I missing something?","[""My brother, we've only had FP1 and FP2."", ""Ocon and Hulkenberg are up against rookies who don't know their cars. Sainz is against a decent team mate, but in a midfield car.\n\nHamilton is up against one of the fastest drivers around, in a leading car. At that level, small things matter. Of course, his age is likely a factor, but it's a vastly different challenge to adapting to a Sauber from a Haas."", 'Sainz is getting compared to Albon, Hamilton to Leclerc. Nothing against Albon but he aint close to Lec', ""Well, he's been at the same team for 12 years, and he's driven with the same engine for his entire 20+ year career.\n\nThe Ferrari is a radically different car, even Carlos said he had a difficult time adjusting to how different even the data lines were at Ferrari when Hamilton said they looked upside down to him lol.\n\nWhen you've done the same thing for 12 years, it takes time to adjust, he's not a magician, it would take anyone time to perform well enough to win races at 40. His steering wheel he's used for 12 years is also radically different, although Ferrari have tried to adjust it as much as they can. \n\nHe's had the same race engineer for 12 years, which we know is insanely important, as Max has said he would **never** drive in F1 with any other engineer other than GP. \n\nAs far as I can remember, no one else has ever spent that many years at one team and then gone to another to compete at the front against one of the fastest drivers on the grid as his teammate. \n\nIt's genuinely an unusual position to be in, you can't really compare it to anyone else honestly."", 'There has only been two practice sessions. People gave Ricciardo way longer before they ultimately said ""yeah no, he\'s not getting better, this is his \'true\' performance level now"". Two practice sessions at the same track is a *very* short amount of time.\n\nThis is also Hamilton Vs Leclerc, in a team Leclerc has been in for a long time. No disrespect to the rookies or even to Albon, but none of them are close to Leclerc.\n\nPerhaps there\'s also some relation to him literally only ever using Mercedes engines in F1. But perhaps not.', ""I love Albon but Leclerc is obviously a far stronger benchmark than him. H√ºlkenberg and Ocon both have rookie teammates so they're naturally expected to immediately beat them.\n\nIt's also only been two practice session so drawing any conclusions is way too early."", 'Sainz was literally in a Williams the day after Abu Dhabi. Hamilton stayed under contract with Mercedes until the 31st of December', ""Dude he's 40 years old going into a new team with a new engine in a different country, with a new engineer, with a talented teammate in Charles who is in his prime, with a different style of car to drive what do you expect dude. You guys seriously underestimate how hard it is to adapt into a new team when you have been with Mercedes for 13 years, and fyi Lewis didn't look that much faster than Nico at Australia either, he just hooked up a banging lap at the end of Q3 whilst Nico bottled it. If you look at Lewis race pace he's already upto speed especially since that was his first proper race run in the 25 Ferrari."", ""Right. Who are Ocon and Hulkenburgs teammates and you might get your answer.\n\nIn respect to sainz he's being paid handsomely and in fairness so is Lewis but most of that is ambassador stuff after F1.""]",0,212,0.26,0,187,187,0,2,0.010000000000000009,0
