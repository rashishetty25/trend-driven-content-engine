1o5ftsq,Can Max (or anyone) catch Hamilton for wins at different circuits?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o5ftsq/can_max_or_anyone_catch_hamilton_for_wins_at/,2025-10-13, Statistics,"Lewis’s career spans three different rule cycles — and he’ll be going into a fourth one soon. During the early 2010s, F1 introduced a lot of new circuits (like Korea, India, Turkey, etc.), many of which were later dropped. Nowadays, there’s much less variation in the calendar — a few tracks might fall off (Imola, Zandvoort, Spa), and only one new track (Madrid) is added.

On the current calendar, the only circuit left for Max to win at is Singapore (and Madrid if Red Bull builds a strong enough car).

The combination of career longevity, era transitions, and addition and deletion of tracks that helped Hamilton reach 31 is hard to replicate in today’s more stable F1 calendar.

While it is a wild speculation, Red Bull is known for making unexpected moves. Should Lindblad and Dunne make extraordinary progress in F2, they could swiftly replace Tsunoda and Lawson. It would be a huge gamble, but that is precisely the kind of decision Marko makes. The current situation in the F1 driver market indicates Red Bull is eager to secure their top future talent quickly, even if it means ruthlessly discarding experienced drivers. Such a radical move would instantly elevate the stakes in the junior categories, placing immense pressure on both Lindblad and Dunne to perform immediately. Furthermore, their lack of F1 experience could destabilize the junior team, but the hunger for a future champion often overrides short-term risk assessments in Milton Keynes.","[""I doubt Dunne will be in F1 in 2026 tbh. I think he stays in F2 and goes for the title next year with a view to take one of the Vcarb seats in 2027.\n\nAlso I'm not fully sure about his super license situation as there are some conflicting reports, but there is a chance Vcarb can't put him in next year even if they wanted to"", 'I believe Dunne has been linked to a second season in F2 with backing from Red Bull. I think the general expectation now is Max/Hadjar at Red Bull and Lindblad at Racing Bulls with either Lawson or Tsunoda.', 'Current rumour suggest that Lindblad will get F1 seat next year.\n\nDunne would stay in F2 next year with possibility of F1 seat in 2027.', ""Idk about Lindblad. In the beginning of the season I was certain he would drive for vcarb in 2026, but now, he doesn't look ready. Sure, that never stopped Red Bull before, but I think they're more cautious now. Red Bull's wet dream, I think, would be Tsunoda evolve just enough to keep him there for 26, give more time to Hadjar to adjust to a new reg, and then promote either Lindblad or Dunne..or both for 27"", ""Tsunoda is out of the family as soon as Honda goes away at the end of the year, so that isn't crazy by any stretch.\xa0"", 'Dunne is rumoured for a Campos seat in f2 with Lindblad going to f1 and Pepe Marti leaving the formula ladder\n\nHe didnt have money for a 2nd f2 season and it’s probably the reason why he changed academies\n\nLots of academies dont really cover the expenses of their drivers, which was probably the case for Dunne at McLaren. \xa0( some lesser rated drivers even pay themselves to be in academies just to have a better shot and better marketing)\n\nMcLaren seemingly also dropped Ugo in f3 but nothing has been confirmed i think? They are left with Stenshorne in f2 probably for one more year and Dries van Langedonck as their true hope for the future', ""Certainly possible. Tsunoda is very likely gone, while Mekies seems to support him more and there is more of an acceptance that the Red Bull is just really hard to drive, his results still haven't been great, and with Honda leaving there's less incentive to keep him. Hadjar will likely get promoted and it feels a bit pointless to keep Tsunoda around.\n\nLawson maybe gets a bit more grace if they felt they rushed him into RB too quickly, but similarly it may feel a bit like he's had his chance. He has been solid in the latter half of the season though, likely they'd prefer to have one more experienced driver to compare a rookie too, so I feel like he'll stay another year.\n\nI feel like the lineup will be Verstappen and Hadjar in Red Bull, Lawson and Lindblad in VCARB. Then if Lindblad gets up to speed well enough, Dunne will replace Lawson in 2027, after another year in F2. I do feel like Dunne has probably been promised something at least, for him to have jumped ship from McLaren, but maybe it's just playing the probabilities that there's very little chance of him getting a seat from McLaren."", ""He needs a 2nd F2 season to work out the kinks and make better decisions before he steps up.
