To prevent this, Sainz would need to win at Mexico, George at Interlagos / Vegas, or Lando at Abu Dhabi. Otherwise, Max will become the **only driver ever** to have multiple wins at a circuit across a single regulation era when no one else has.

1ogg7ws,P5 start by Sergio Perez 2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ogg7ws/p5_start_by_sergio_perez_2023/,2025-10-26, Technical,"I've watched P5 starts from previous years - unfortunatelly it's not ideal grid position: usually it's great at first 1-2 seconds because you are in the slipstream of 2 cars ahead, but then they cut to the right side of the track and your slipstream is suddenly gone. And you can't really cut to the right as well because of P4 and P3. What's more if someone cuts back to left side of the track again then you're blocked. Also being on the outside in T1 you have to be extra careful as everyone is understeering there.

What suprised me was that Perez in 2023 actually had amazing start from P5. Verstappen and Charles both started in straight line giving him a bit of a slipstream, then he almost immediately managed to overtake Hamilton in P4, cut to right which gave him absolutely massive slipstream and drove next to Sainz (I don't know why Sainz didn't block him there). He used empty left side of T1 and at some point was ahead of the Verstappen and Leclerc.

I think what helped him was average start by Hamilton, that no one ahead of him switched suddenly from left to right (all moves were slow) so he could keep within slipstream and Sainz who didn't prevent him from entering Charles and Max's slipstream.

I was't impressed with Sergio's start in that race as he took out himself and almost Charles and I was too focused on the leaders, but the more I watch it the more I like it.
I don't think anymore that going into T1 3 wide was stupid from Checo, it was brave and he had really good opportunity at taking the lead in his home gp, but maybe he could be a little but more careful knowing well that Charles and Max have drag race to T1. Maybe knowing Max and Charles he should let them fight and position himself better at exit at T3 trying to overtake to T4.

Anyway as a Max fan I am not optimistic, Russel surelly won't have bad start but because all top 5 are so experienced I am very curious who will be ahead of T1. Something tells me this can be Russel as P4 is decent, he doesn't count in WDC fight, doesn't have team mate next to him and already extended with Mercedes so has nothing to loose and can be more agressive.","[""only positive thing can happen is max doesnt lose position and both ferrari' s overtake norris and norris is stuck in dirty air.

Any other driver would've tried the same."", 'Worthwhile read.', ""Verstappen gonna start on softs, put at like lap22 or something into mediums, undercut two drivers and hold position. That's the best he can do"", 'Yea, it will though. \n\nBut he’s main job is the finish ahead of Piastri.', 'Seeing Checo try that move around the outside always makes me chuckle a bit for how similar it is to 2021 but how differently it ends\n\nHe tried to re-create what Max did in 2021, but forgot he is in fact not Max Verstappen', 'If its going to be a normal Norris, then he will be extra cautious, leave space to others, only to end up bunched up/pushed off ...', 'The idea was fine. But he cut to the inside too much. From his onboard, he had a clear line of sight on Charles and Max going side by side whilst he was prepping to overtake them both on the outside.\n\nAt Mexico, seeing that, you kind of have to expect Max to be on the inside entering the corner. So turning in like it’s only him and Charles were present was a bit naive.\n\nEither go deep, and very wide, with the risk that Max will push Leclerc into you. Turn-in, and risk hitting Charles who can’t evade due to a car on his inside. Or back-off, and abandon the overtake.\n\nThree wide on the outside is always a shitty position unless you can brake so deep you effectively create a clear line to the apex. Which has its own risks.']",16,12,0.7,16,12,12,2,1,0.0,2
1ogkagc,Data Analysis & Prediction for 2025 Mexican GP (Showing the Work This Time!),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ogkagc/data_analysis_prediction_for_2025_mexican_gp/,2025-10-26, Technical,"Hey everyone,

After my last analysis on Sainz's Singapore stint got some (deservedly) critical feedback here about not explaining the ""how"" and using ""voodoo math,"" I wanted to share my prediction attempt for the **2025 Mexican GP** using a more transparent, data-driven approach.

This isn't a fancy ML model, just core data analysis using Python/FastF1 to calculate key performance factors and simulate a prediction based on weighted scores. The goal is to show the data behind the ranking.

**Data & Features Used:**

1. **Adjusted Grid:** Used official Quali results + applied the confirmed **+5 place penalty for Sainz**. 

https://preview.redd.it/8nu1o7nzegxf1.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2313fe74f661e5811dab258fa45aa14eddef7b3

1. **FP2 Long Run Pace:** Calculated average pace from FP2 Medium tyre stints (5-10 laps), making sure to filter out in/out laps (`pick_quicklaps`). 

https://preview.redd.it/4rs1drstegxf1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4e6b591ca7189b6d9670b20a1cb40d6e08469bc

1. **FP2 Tyre Degradation:** Calculated the linear degradation slope (s/lap increase) for the same FP2 stints using `numpy.polyfit`*.* 

&#8203;

    Average Tyre Degradation Slope per Driver (s/lap):
    HAM   -0.248982
    ANT    0.101776
    VER    0.155473
    LEC    0.241527
    RUS    0.382383

1. **Track History:** Average finishing position at this track (2021-2024), excluding DNFs.

**The Numbers:**

    NOR                   32.6%  
    HAM                   25.7%  
    LEC                   21.3%  
    RUS                    7.7%  
    VER                    6.7%  

**Why the Simulation Ranks Them This Way:**

* The data simulation points towards **Lando Norris (NOR)** as the favorite (32.6%) mainly because **starting on Pole Position gives him a significant advantage** according to the weights used. While his FP2 long run wasn't long enough to calculate specific pace/degradation, the model imputes competitive median values, which aren't enough to overcome the benefit of starting P1.
* **Lewis Hamilton (HAM)** looks strong (25.7%) primarily due to **showing the potentially fastest average long-run pace in FP2**. However, the simulation slightly penalizes him for starting further back (P5) compared to Norris. *(Note: His FP2 degradation data also looked unusual with very short stints, adding some uncertainty).*
* **Charles Leclerc (LEC)** is predicted third (21.3%), benefiting from a **strong P3 start**. His main limiting factor in the simulation is his **higher expected tyre degradation** based on the FP2 analysis, potentially forcing a less optimal strategy compared to the leaders.
* **Worth noting:** **Carlos Sainz (SAI)** put in a solid qualifying effort (P7), but his **+5 grid place penalty** significantly impacts his starting position (P12) and therefore heavily lowers his predicted win probability in this simulation, despite potentially decent underlying pace metrics.

Crucially, this ranking explains the ""how"" the prediction was reached: it's the result of **combining these specific, calculated metrics** (Adjusted Grid Position, FP2 Avg Pace, FP2 Avg Degradation, Historical Finish) using the described weighted simulation. Different weights or models would yield different results, but this shows the logic based on *this* analysis.

**Limitations:** Obviously, this doesn't account for the start, strategy genius/blunders, safety cars, reliability, etc. It's purely based on the performance data we have *before* the race.

Let me know what you think of the data and the approach this time! Did I miss anything obvious? Who's your pick? Suggest any platforms for publishing blogs/ advices welcome on how to write blogs since I didn't do very well last time.

And is the camera set ups given to teams whilst they do testing for there new season cars when testing updates in like a wind tunnel.

Once again sorry if this is a stupid question just curious as there is a few cameras on the cars ","['On board camera locations are defined in the regulations so that all the cars suffer from the same weight and aero penalty. \n\nIf for whatever reason a camera is not fitted in one of the preset locations, ballast is used that is same size and weight as a camera.', 'https://youtu.be/vDqdMyHxayU\n\nThis is a great video on the technology.']",8,2,0.72,8,11,11,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0
