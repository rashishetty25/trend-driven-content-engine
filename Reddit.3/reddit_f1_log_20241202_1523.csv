However, as precedent shows, it appears to be the standard penalty for ignoring double yellows during a race. I went through the penalty-points system database which covers the past 10 years, and found all three instances of a breach **during a race**.

* 2021 Austrian GP, Mazepin & Latifi handed penalty post-race, **10s Stop & Go**, which was translated into 30s added to their race time due to the penalty being post race. ([Source](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/mazepin-and-latifi-handed-post-race-penalties-for-failing-to-slow-under.6f8SGWq4WlOkeAdh3ff1T))

These are all examples I could find of drivers ignoring double yellow flags during the race in the last 10 years. All drivers got the same penalty.  If anyone could find examples from before 2014, that would be interesting too.

At least this time, the stewards seem to have been consistent for once.","['Maybe the confusion comes from that it has happened more often during qualifying in recent years and with different penalties for qualifying', ""It's confusing to fans because the broadcast makes no distinction between single and double yellow.  It's just a yellow flag notification and what sector."", 'I actually thought the FIA were right in issuing strict penalties. Their only failure was the wing mirror being let out on the track for so long.\xa0', ""Yup. We haven't seen it in a race in a few years, only really during quali & practices, where it's a 3 place grid drop. And during VSCs and SCs it's a 5 second penalty."", ""Penalty today was fair and consistent\n\nI think the issue actually is that drivethrough and stop and go penalties aren't given often enough. They should be utilised much more for collisions when one driver is clearly at fault instead of standard 5/10s penalties. The only reason the penalty today seemed harsh at first is we basically never see stop and go penalties."", 'There have been very rare instances of ignoring double yellows that not everyone remembers the rules. But what surprised me was that the commentators overreacted to the penalty. Even after the race where they had time to cool down and do a bit of research before the post race presentation, they kept repeating how both the penalties were harsh and FIA has to be blamed.', ""Most people don't care to look details and nuances, they just want to be angry!\n\nThe other talking point of today's race was Lewis's penalty. A drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane seems harsh because they usually give 5-second penalties. But the significant factor in this case is that Lewis was 12.5 km/h over the speed limit, not the usual 0.1 km/h. And a drive-through penalty is the recommended penalty in regulations when you are that much above the speed limit.\n\nFor Lando's case as you said 10-second stop-and-go penalty is standard for not respecting double yellows in the race. I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact it was **DOUBLE** yellows not single. Again 10-second stop-and-go penalty is the recommended penalty in the regulation (Bernie Collins confirmed that in post-race) and as you said it's the penalty that has been given in all recent instances.\n\nEdit: I think the broadcast also plays a part in the misunderstanding, firstly they showed the wrong replay in the live broadcast and they just said yellows in the race, didn't say double yellows until post-race."", ""It's a safety issue and a very fair penalty imo, same with the pitlane one"", ""> If anyone could find examples from before 2014, that would be interesting too.\n\nAlonso got a drive through penalty in the 2003 Brazilian GP for overtaking under yellows. I think it was double-waved yellows, but can't find a reference to that right now. Later on in the same race, he crashed after ignoring double-waved yellows, the race was red-flagged, and he did not receive a penalty for that.""]",1215,231,0.94,1215,2866,2866,21,7,0.0,21

Hamilton can also be heard reporting a puncture while on the pit straight well before reaching the point where the mirror was hit by Bottas. (Please note that on driver cams, the radio is out of sync with the video, but you can tell when radio calls are made by watching the driver toggle the radio on their steering wheel.)

The debris appears to mostly fall on the RIGHT side of the track, off the racing line, and both Sainz and Hamilton report front-LEFT punctures.

**How did Norris win?**

Going into the race, Norris was leading the contest with 5 fastest laps (FL) to his name, followed by Verstappen and Leclerc tied in second place with 3 FLs each. Leclerc was already out of contention because of tiebreakers (second most fastest laps, then third most fastest laps if needed and so on). With Norris setting the FL in Lusail, it's now mathematically impossible for Verstappen to match Norris' tally and hope to win on countback.

- The FLA was won on countback 4 times: R√§ikk√∂nen over Massa in 2007, Vettel over Webber in 2009, Alonso over Hamilton in 2010 and Hamilton over Verstappen in 2021.

- 2010 was the only season in which the team with the most fastest laps didn't win the FLA (Alonso won it on countback over Hamilton, but McLaren had 6 fastest laps in total to Ferrari's 5). 

- Mercedes holds the records for most FLA wins (8), most consecutive FLA wins (8) and most consecutive fastest laps in a single season (7, set in 2014 between the British GP and the Japanese GP).

- 88% of the teams fielding the FLA winner have also won the Constructors' Championship the same season (exceptions being Brawn in 2009 and Red Bull in 2010). 

- 61% of the drivers who have won the FLA also won the Drivers' Championship the same season (exception being 2008, 2009,2010,2011,2018,2021 and 2024). 

- In 2008, Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen and Ferrari set the following FLA records:

-Most fastest laps by a driver in a single season (10)

-Highest % of fastest laps by a driver in a single season (55%, 10/18 races)

-Most consecutive races with the fastest lap by a single driver (6) 

-Most fastest laps by a team in single season (13)

Low-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""I think the penalties drivers received during the race were appropriate.  We don't often see infractions for speeding in the pitlane as much as Lewis did (10+ kph over) or ignoring double yellows like Lando, so it can be easy to forget what the penalties for those infractions look like.\n\nWhat I don't think was appropriate was the race director's decision to just cover a piece of debris on track with a double yellow and seemingly no plan to clean it up until it was actually hit and started causing damage to cars.\n\nIf nobody hit that mirror, were we just going to go the rest of the race with a double yellow on that track's only real passing zone?  Was that actually the plan?"", 'I keep seeing misinformation about other drivers not lifting for the double yellows, especially the Ferraris, and people calling for them to get penalties. This is just not true and is easily viewable in the telemetry.\n\n[Leclerc](https://i.imgur.com/iUpv8Hs.png) and [Verstappen](https://i.imgur.com/7Fibh7F.png) both lifted significantly. [Piastri](https://i.imgur.com/YNmEtcm.png) did slightly less, but still clearly lifted. [Sainz](https://i.imgur.com/3kTn9yl.png) lifted the least, but critically, he still did so before he turned the corner. Out of the top five cars, [Norris](https://i.imgur.com/m7D5Ro4.png) is the only one who didn\'t react at all. His throttle usage in lap 30 is identical to lap 29. \n\nThere\'s also a post making waves on Twitter using the lap 31 telemetry as ""proof,"" but the lap that was penalized was lap 30.\n\nThe penalty Norris received is consistent with previous ones for ignoring double yellows in a race.\n\nThat being said... there needs to be a discussion about how terrible the debris was handled. First of all, why was the yellow flag removed six times before the double yellows were instated? Why were the double yellows instated then removed when the situation on track didn\'t change? Why didn\'t they even attempt to recover the debris? I understand that it wasn\'t on the racing line, but it was at the only overtaking corner on the entire track. Catastrophic race mismanagement.', ""It looks like such a fun track, but faster cars being unable to overtake at all makes it a really boring race to watch. If the chaos demon hadn't struck this would have been an exceptionally boring race."", ""Race control *(and by extension the FIA)* needs to fix their own mess in their backyard before stepping into the mix because they are making themselves look like an unfunny joke. Rui Marques and co's decision to not call in a VSC, a SC or even neutralise the race to any capacity to allow the mirror and/or the debris to be cleared is one of the scrappiest decisions I have ever seen in a long while.\n\nI have read their explanation. Why did it take them approximately multiple goddamn laps to make the safety car call, only when it was dragged out to the point where two drivers obtained a puncture and one driver drove over it? They claimed it deviates from standard procedure to send out the SC or a VSC, but to fixate on efforts to remove the mirror that is stranded on the track should be a *no-brainer*. What exactly were they waiting for? A miracle?"", 'I‚Äôm still flabbergasted that they let that mirror sit there for what, 4 laps, with no attempt o to recover it? It astonishes me still when the viewers, commentators, analysts all watching the race can see what is there and there‚Äôs a unanimous view that a safety car or a virtual is coming‚Ä¶.and crickets. There‚Äôs no excuse for it to be like that.', 'after the sprint i thought this race would be one of the worst of the season but it was actually quite entertaining. Not much of actual racing but chaotic', 'Gasly was superb. Zhou had a great race too. Hulk caused 2 DNFs and no penalty even though a race incident should be the responsibility of all drivers involved. He locked and drifted in T1 causing chaos. \n\nRace direction sucked. \n\nThere is so much at stake this extended weekend \n\n- F1 WCC\n\n- F2 championship\n\n- Drivers‚Äô last chance to show off\n\n- Tests on Tuesday\n\nFun times!', ""One thing that I found interesting around the mirror incident was the lack of mirror itself.\n\nThey're clearly a mandated part, so why wasn't Albon given a meatball flag for lacking the mirror?"", ""Still can't quite get over how mentally dominant Max proved to be over his peers this race.\n\nHe straight up told George that he was going to be taking that place back into turn 1. And if anyone had any doubts at the time that Max was mad, it was probably dispelled as soon as we saw the way he angled his car on the grid for the start, as if he was going to torpedo right into George. And once the race got going, you could tell George was having absolutely none of that trouble, as he didn't even hang it out through the turn. Max was going to lead into turn 1 pretty much no matter what and his declaration of that is partly what caused it, by getting into Russell's head before the race. Very reminiscent of Larry Bird in that way. When Max is incensed enough to call his shot before the race, you can be sure he's going to pull it off.\n\nAnd Max has such a psychological edge over Norris that when the latter tried to sneak by (and even had the lead going into turn 2) he just backed out at the mere prospect of Max challenging him, likely out of fear of being pushed wide. Based on Lando's comments after the race and how shellshocked he looked, he had no clue about the double yellows until the penalty was handed out. Yet Max was aware of not only his own race, but aware enough of Lando's to report the incident and get him nuked with the stop and go pen."", 'Another great performance from Gasly. He had a  bit of a slow start to the season but he‚Äôs been really on it since ~Spain. His performance relative to Ocon this season has been every bit as good, if not better than what Alonso managed across 2021-2022. He might even sneak inside my top five drivers this season.']",15,50,0.82,15,46,46,12,40,0.019999999999999907,12

Curious to get theories about the performance difference of Hamilton vs.Russell this year. 

Last year Hamilton won fairly clearly, the year before it was more mixed but this year has been a bit of a mess for Hamilton. 

Keen to get some knowledgable input about what‚Äôs this been caused by: 

- fluke results the last few races?
- Hamilton performance dropping off?
- Russell under-rated?
- Something different with the cars? 

Thoughts?

1h4d5ra,Teams compliance with FIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4d5ra/teams_compliance_with_fia/,2024-12-01, Technical,"Taking into account what happened, both today and in the past, with conflicting decisions or at least difficult to understand, the question would be what could be the consequences if a team ""opposes"" the decision taken by the stewards or race director?

Not directly in the race, but for example, at the next race, 5 teams discuss among themselves and announce that they will no longer compete if a certain race director will manage that race?

I ask because it is not uncommon in interviews to hear a team principal saying something along the lines of ""we're wrong (or we think we weren't wrong) but the decision is up to the stewards, and we will comply with it"".

So, tldr;

(thank you for all the details)

1. **Concorde Agreement Obligations**:
   * Teams are contractually obligated under the Concorde Agreement to compete in all scheduled races. Non-compliance could result in severe penalties, including exclusion from Formula 1.
2. **Financial Repercussions**:
   * The Formula One Management (FOM) can withhold prize money if teams fail to meet their obligations. This could lead to financial instability for all but the wealthiest teams.
3. **Sponsorship Dependencies**:
   * Sponsors expect teams to participate in every race. Non-compliance with FIA rules could harm sponsorship deals and revenue streams.
4. **Potential Bans and Exclusion**:
   * FIA holds the authority to ban teams from future races or exclude them from championships for non-compliance.
5. **Limited Power Against FIA**:
   * Teams have minimal influence over FIA decisions, which ensures a consistent governing authority.
6. **Judicial Alternatives**:
   * Teams have the right to appeal FIA decisions to bodies like the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). However, this process respects the FIA‚Äôs governance framework.
7. **Public and Competitive Image**:
   * Opposing the FIA publicly could harm a team's reputation among fans, sponsors, and peers, creating long-term negative impacts.","[""> Not directly in the race, but for example, at the next race, 5 teams discuss among themselves and announce that they will no longer compete if a certain race director will manage that race?\n\nTeams have to participate in races.
