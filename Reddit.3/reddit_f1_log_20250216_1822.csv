1iqsrdh,How big of an issue is cockpit position in the current generation of F1 cars?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iqsrdh/how_big_of_an_issue_is_cockpit_position_in_the/,2025-02-16, Discussion,"We know Lewis wanted the cockpit to be a little behind  and not so much in the front in the Merc cars. The recent Haas pics( [https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iqq24t/haas\_vf25\_leaked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iqq24t/haas_vf25_leaked/) ) suggest they have also moved the driver cockpit behind to get more space between the front tires and sidepods. I have read all of this on reddit, so, my source is a bit lacking, for lack of a better word. 

Now, I don't know how much Haas pushing the cockpit behind is due to them taking design cues from Ferrari or there's some performance gains that they see in this design philosophy.

What do you guys know/think?","[""I believe it's pretty up to preference and weight distribution."", 'The Haas drivers are also giants', '>We know Lewis wanted the cockpit to be a little behind and not so much in the front in the Merc cars.\xa0\n\n\nIt had to sit more forward on the W13 and W14 because their ultra tight packaging concept required it. They pushed it back on the W15 when they changed their car philosophy (more in line with the rest of the grid, because it was the concept with the most development potential). But Lewis still had trouble with the car, mainly because it had tyre overheating issues, especially at the rear, and lacked the rear downforce necessary to be able to do what Lewis wanted it to do (there\'s also a point to be made about him refusing, or failing, we don\'t know which, to adapt his driving style for three years).\xa0\n\n\nNow opinions vary on how important the cockpit position actually is. On an episode of *Beyond the Grid*, Martin Brundle was asked about it and his answer was essentially ""it\'s everything"" as it ties in with how much confidence a driver gets when he has the right feel for his car. And generally a confident driver is a fast driver.\xa0\n\n\nOn the other hand James Allison and engineers from other teams said it didn\'t matter that much. Regarding Merc, he said the cockpit position was a bit of a scapegoat and what really mattered was to make the car more stable. Russell never complained about it and did just fine either way, and ironically Lewis\' strongest season in terms of pace and consistency (2023) was with a car that had the forward cockpit. And the W14 wasn\'t particularly easier to drive than its successor', "">I believe it's pretty up to preference and weight distribution.\n\nMass distribution got tightened up years ago. Currently 0.446 and 0.539 Front-Rear rounded to the nearest half kilogram.\n\nSeat position will be a combination of packaging and preference. In the case of the W14 it was packaging. The seat was further forward than contemporary cars because Mercedes were trying to package the radiators really narrow for aero benefits.""]",27,5,0.8,27,4,4,10,1,0.06000000000000005,10

So, F1TV has been locked down in my country and I would have to buy a VPN to recieve it.
