1ibawuc,New focus on bending wings: no more progress with underbody upgrades? (amUs),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ibawuc/new_focus_on_bending_wings_no_more_progress_with/,2025-01-27, Technical,,"['Translation (credit to JunaidSamodien\\_ on the place we cannot link too anymore):\n\nDespite the improvement in lap times compared to 2023, the current cars have reached the end of their development, Adrian Newey believes ""It\'s in the nature of things. A ground-effect car without side-sealing skirts like in the 80s will always be prone to instability. You are looking for more and more underpressure under the car, but you always have to deal with leaks from the side. This generates downforce losses here and there, which are stronger the lower your car is.""\n\nThe engineers are therefore constantly navigating the conflict of producing as much downforce as possible while incurring as little instability as possible. In this compromise, many teams have now almost reached their limit.  \nEveryone fears harmful side effects in their development work, such as bouncing, fluctuating downforce, or balance shifts. With the exception of McLaren and Haas, everyone had at least one upgrade that had a negative effect.\n\nAdditionally, the field kept getting closer together. Only between the top 4 and the rest is there a larger gap of three to four tenths. At some point, everyone will encounter this conflict when improving the floor.  \nAnd when searching for the best compromise, the margins naturally become smaller and smaller. Newey adds: ""Both are a clear signal that we have already come quite close to the limit.""\n\nThe big topic at the moment is aeroelasticity. Since the regulations cannot prescribe absolutely rigid components, everyone is pushing the limits as far as the FIA tests allow.  \nMcLaren started with it and optimized the flexibility of certain aero parts. The team relied mainly on the expertise of Rob Marshall, who was previously very creative in this area at Red Bull. No one controlled the twisting of the front wing as well as McLaren.  \nAnd that is a trump card for the ground effect cars. Because the wing and its flaps are still in their normal position at low speeds, the driver feels the grip they need to steer in slow corners. The higher the speed, the more parts of the wing rotate backwards. This shifts the center of downforce backward, allowing the driver to rely on the rear sticking to the road in fast corners. This shift in balance creates confidence and brings lap time.\n\nThe teams also came up with tricks on the rear wing to reduce drag, especially with the DRS closed. McLaren bent the flaps upwards at the outer edges, Ferrari pulled the main element downwards. Both were banned. It harmed neither one nor the other in the long run.  \nMore important was the front wing. Mercedes was the first team to copy McLaren. Ferrari waited until after the summer break because they were afraid the FIA might quickly ban the trick. The development of a suitable wing is not trivial and costs money that one does not want to waste within the budget cap. Only when the FIA issued a statement on McLaren\'s front wing did Ferrari follow suit. Too late, as Vasseur remarked. Red Bull focused on lobbying against the flexible wings, which only succeeded with the rear wing.\n\nIn the second half of the season, more and more teams followed suit. Especially from the second half of the table. That\'s why cars like the Alpine and the Haas got closer to the top 4, and that\'s why Sauber also caught up with the field.  \nBecause the rules in this area are not supposed to be tightened in the last year of the existing regulations, one can assume that the field will come even closer together.\n\nBut research was also conducted in other places. The chassis engineers are always trying to design dampers and springs more progressively to keep the car stable in the best possible position at all speed ranges.  \nNewey says: ""Mechanics and aerodynamics must harmonize. This is especially true for ground-effect cars. Whoever doesn\'t manage that will ruin their tires in continuous operation.‚Äù', 'Imagine not having 4 but 6 teams fighting for wins!', 'This season is going to be very interesting.', 'I feel that with the cost cap in place, some regulation should be loosened. Both because teams can no longer throw money at the problem for marginal gains, but also because i think loosened rules might give team cheaper ways to improve performance.', 'Aston mid season upgrade is gonna rock, Newie will figure out a way to put them on top', 'This is fantastic. Thank you.', ""Thanks! What still isn't clear to me: Did RBR bring their variant of the flexi-frontwing last season or do they still have that gain to bring for 2025?"", ""I don't even think Newey will be trying to be competitive this year. He joined way too late to work on 2025's car and is already behind on starting on the new regulations for 2026 when teams were finally allowed to start working on it this month. He would probably much prefer to sink most of the resources into 2026 than try and work on 2025."", '[x] Doubt']",91,13,0.93,91,81,81,1,0,0.0,1
