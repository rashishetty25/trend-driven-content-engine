1n9uncu,FIA's V8 push delayed after F1 engine meeting called off,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n9uncu/fias_v8_push_delayed_after_f1_engine_meeting/,2025-09-06, News,,"['>""It is understood manufacturers are not against the idea of moving to V8 engines in the long term, but several parties questioned why they would have to commit another large-scale investment so soon after the hugely expensive 2026 regulations, which haven\'t even been introduced yet.""\n\nShocking. /s\n\nYour telling me someone like Audi isn\'t up for another drastic engine rules change 3 years after they joined because of a completely different set of rules?\n\nHow about we wait a year or 2 into the new rules to see what the state of the current regs is before even start to discuss potential change.', ""Sad about this clusterfuck where F1 is heading, I've always thought 2014 PU's were far too advanced for their time and they still are, now they've peaked with PU's and taking a step back for the spectacle"", ""Honestly, with fully sustainable fuels and no credible hybrid tech beacon argument left (as road cars have come on so much), let's just go back to N/A V12 and/or V10, 20,000 rpm.\n\n\nTech and innovation is supposed to enable what we want. We did it and we should be able to enjoy now."", ""Sorta?\n\nIts more that they don't wanna fix what ain't broke, even though the v6 engines gave a lot of drawbacks.\n\nThey haven't had the real world crossover they were predicted to. They're way too specialized and expensive, because the rules are super strict."", 'Except the sustainable fuels are anything but given the costs involved have seemingly gone up about 10x compared to expectations.', ""stop the greenwashing. call them e-fuels and we are good. but don't pretend anything sustainable about them. consumes a lot of energy, is toxic and still produces a lot more other fumes than just CO2.""]",4,7,0.75,4,6,6,4,7,0.75,4
