It’s a real shame as I think their stuff is generally high standard and very readable.

Asides the big 3 which midfield team do you believe is currently punching above their weight?', 'I’ve been trying to understand what went wrong at Barcelona that caused Red Bull to give Max hard tires at lap 56. I’ve looked at the tire strategy Red Bull used and Max’s radio chat with his team. This is the best answer I can come up with. While we have a good idea as to what went down, I’m going to have to rely on my own speculation a lot in figuring out why Max and his team acted the way they did.\n\nFor the duration of the race, Red Bull would only have access to three sets of Softs, one set of Mediums, and three sets of Hards per driver. They had to plan their driver’s tire strategy with these limitations in mind. Knowing this, Hannah Schmidt put together a three-pit strategy for Max. It was organized like this:\n\nStart on Softs - pit - switch to Softs- pit - switch to Mediums - pit - finish on Softs\n\nHonestly, this is a pretty good strategy considering what Red Bull is working with. Max has to compete against two McLaren rocket ships. If you’re going against two opponents who are driving faster cars than you, then it’s a good idea to maximize the amount of time you’re using the soft tires. Giving yourself as much traction as possible is going to do wonders in keeping you in the fight. The only downside I can think of is that you’re using 100% of your Softs, so you can’t change out to fresh, extra Softs if unforeseen problems happen.\n\nAt lap 56, Max is on the final phase of this plan. He is on his last set of Softs and he’s going to use them until the end of the race. But then Antonelli’s engine fails and the safety car comes out. Once this happens, Max radios his team and says:\n\n“Do we have another set of tires? It will make a difference. Fresh tires.”\n\nWhat is Max thinking here? I believe he doesn’t remember how many sets of Softs he has left, but he knows the McLarens have at least one set of fresh Softs remaining. If Max stays out, he’ll be in P1 when the safety car leaves, but he probably won’t be able to keep up with the McLarens in his 8-lap old Softs that he’s been working extra hard. That means he’ll probably be looking at finishing behind Lando or Charles. But what if he gets fresh Softs? Even though he’ll be in P3 when the safety car leaves, he feels confident he can overtake Lando, and maybe even Oscar if he plays his cards right. So in Max’s mind, staying out will at best put him in P3-P4, whilst pitting will, at best, put him in P2-P1. It’s a riskier strategy, but it offers a greater reward. And Max is never one to be scared by risk.\n\nBut this idea Max has hinges on whether he has a fresh set of Softs to use. So he asks Red Bull if he has any fresh tires left. Red Bull does not answer the question. Then they tell him to pit moments later. Finally, they give him hard tires and send him on his way.\n\nWhat was Red Bull thinking here? It’s much harder for me to understand their thought process compared to Max’s. I think the number of team members leaving in the last few years has something to do with it. The people who are left are inexperienced, don’t know how to deal with crises, and just deferred to what they thought Max wanted. They heard Max say fresh tires would help, so they automatically gave him fresh tires, without considering what those tires were. So to answer the question of what they were thinking, the best answer I can come up with is that they just didn’t think.\n\nTo be clear, I don’t think Max is the one to blame for this SNAFU. The only criticism I can give him is that he probably should have said “Do we have another set of fresh Softs?”. The primary blame should fall to Red Bull and their lack of critical thinking. They should have thought about where Max was in the race and what would have helped him most at that moment. If they had recognized they only fresh tires they had left were hards, and told Max as such, then I think Max probably would have gotten a podium finish that day.
