There was a two-week enforced holiday, as required by Formula 1 regulations. The premier class of motorsport returns to Zandvoort this weekend, which is why operations in Milton Keynes have resumed in recent days.\n\nNew team boss Laurent Mekies in particular has had a busy few days, as the Frenchman wanted to make the most of the time. ‘He has familiarised himself with the team, looked at the structures and staff,’ reveals motorsport boss Helmut Marko. Hardly a stone was left unturned after Christian Horner's dismissal. ‘In the medium term, we are working on a kind of decentralisation. The individual departments will have their own boss, who will then report to Laurent on the whole.’\n\nThe focus of the RB team boss will be on racing, although he will continue to have overall responsibility. Nevertheless, the individual roles of the department heads at Red Bull changed after Horner's dismissal. ‘The RB17 project is headed by Rob Gray, for example, and the engine department by Ben Hodgkinson. They were given a little more responsibility for their areas. This allows Mekies to concentrate more on the racing team. There has already been progress because he is simply an excellent engineer.’\n\nRejection of Alex Palou\nThere has been no progress on the driver market yet. By the end of October, those responsible want to make a decision on who will sit alongside Max Verstappen in the number one team and what the Racing Bulls duo will be called next year. Rookie Isack Hadjar has been a ‘positive surprise’ so far, and everything is going well with Formula 2 talent Arvid Lindblad. ‘We are right on schedule. He is fully integrated and will get several more opportunities with us this year.’\n\nThere is absolutely ‘no truth’ to the rumours that Red Bull is in negotiations with American IndyCar driver Alex Palou. ‘That's not true.’ However, the car's setup should be right again this weekend at the Dutch Grand Prix. The world championships are out of reach, so the goal for the rest of the season is clear: ‘We want to finish as far ahead as possible, but it's hard to say whether victories are possible.’ Cadillac is likely to take a similar approach for its entry next year. According to Marko, the US manufacturer has ‘chosen the conservative route’ with Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez. ‘You know what you've got.’ The Graz native has praise for his former driver from Mexico. ‘I spoke to him on the phone and he's motivated. If he's motivated and the car is right, then he'll certainly be back to the level he once was.’\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)"", 'Saying there are no negotiations with Palou is so funny because the original article suggested nothing of the sort.', ""I'm not sure why anyone thought this was a serious possibility"", 'Obligatory Fuck Helmut Marko, all my homies hate Helmut Marko', 'Palou is Spanish not American', 'Hear me out...

I thought I would share the fantasy league that myself and five friends have been playing, and how it’s working out so far.

A little back story, there are six of us that work together at a fire station, and we are huge fans of F1, but everyone’s knowledge of the details varies. I wanted to come up with a fantasy game that gave everyone a good chance of points each weekend. So here it is.

First I made a board along with everyone’s names attached to some Velcro. In order to determine picking order, each week we race the PS4 game at the designated track. This also helps when watching the race because you feel like you really know the track. None of us are huge gamers so it’s sort of the great equalizer. Occasionally we have people gone on vacation or we were too busy at work to accomplish practice and qualifying sessions. In those cases we draw names from a hat and do a running pick either via text or FaceTime.

Once quali has determined picking order, everyone gets to choose ONE team and TWO drivers. The number one pick chooses EITHER one team, or one driver. Then the second person goes and so on. Once the 6th person picks their first pick, they pick again, then picking goes in reverse order, and back down again. (Ex: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2…6)

Picking first is obviously a big advantage, but it does not necessarily mean you will have the best combined score for the weekend. Everyone’s points for the weekend are added up at the end and we get to look forward to the next race on the calendar. 

The game has been a big success. It’s relatively still close at the summer break. We also added a race on the calendar where you’ll see Andretti on the calendar. This is a karting facility nearby where we physically went together and raced for points. Each weekend you end up cheering for new drivers and teams which keeps it exciting. This format has worked out so much better than I planned, and it’s really given us a whole new level of enjoyment this season. Hope you enjoy our shenanigans. Glad break is over. Lights out and away we go!

For me it is interesting because people not following F1 often snark if there is some pundit, commentator and they display ""won 4 GPs and started 45 times""... they feel like it isn't a good driver unless he has 4 titles, yet winning even one grand prix puts him in the top 30%, winning more than 4 races puts him in top 8%...in 75 years of the F1.

1n2eblr,[OC] A visualisation of driver turnover for every team since their last major ownership change,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n2eblr/oc_a_visualisation_of_driver_turnover_for_every/,2025-08-28, Discussion,"Even though this year’s silly season may be very quiet, I wanted to see the movement of drivers between teams and how true certain stereotypes are (looking at Red Bull and RB changing drivers like they are trading cards). Which team do you think has handled driver changes the best (or worst) in recent years?  


A few quick notes and takeaways:

* The decision for the cutoff point being each team’s last major ownership change was because (at least in theory) the ownership would have some decision making power and thus the results would represent the most recent team policy. Let me know if you want to see the all-time results but that will probably take a while.
* The common perception that Red Bull has a systematic, ruthless policy of “perform immediately or be replaced”, seems to hold some truth, but much of it stems from their junior team, which is used as the testing ground for executing the strategy. 
* It looks like Red Bull, at least for their 2nd driver, follow patterns similar to other teams.
* Alpine’s 2nd seat looks increasingly unstable recently. Doohan has already been replaced by Colapinto, whose seat is now under pressure.
* 2025 was one of the biggest shuffles in recent history. After a completely static grid in 2024, half the grid in 2025 is drivers in new seats.
