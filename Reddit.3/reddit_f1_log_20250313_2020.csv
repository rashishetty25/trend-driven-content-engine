Here's my list. 

Max Verstappen - 2023 
What more is there to say. Yes you could make arguments for all his championship winning seasons for different reasons and usually I would pick winning a fight over domination but his donination was more than has ever been seen from a driver and statistically the greatest season in F1 history. 

Liam Lawson - 2023
Only tow choices and neither are full seasons, 2023 was so impressive when he came in, particularly Singapore. 2024 USA was just as good, but he wasn't beating Yuki as often in 24 so 23 it is. 

Lando Norris - 2021
Ok so Lando is an odd one in that all his seasons I'd rank pretty similar and he's never had a bad year. I chose 21 because of how impressive he was in the first half of the year (at summer break I think he was 3rd in standings) He also could have won a few races post summer break had things home differently. 

Oscar Piastri - 2024 
His run from Austria to Baku was truly incredible and his end of the season was nowhere near as bad as lots of people on here seem to think. He also had bad luck in a few races but still ranked fourth. 

Charles Leclerc - 2024 
This was actually a pretty clear winner. He did not make any of the mistakes that had blighted his previously great seasons and without the bad Ferrari summer run he could have won the championship. Winning in Monaco and Monza is amazing. 

Lewis Hamilton - 2020
His stretch from 18-20 is great but he never seemed quite as unstoppable as he did in 2020. He also beat Bottas better than in 2018 when Bottas had so much bad luck, and 2019 where both of them were on it. 

George Russell - 2024
So 2021 and 2022 are both strong contenders but his drives in Spa and Las Vegas as well as his qualifying demolition of the man with the most poles in F1 puts this first.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli - N/A

Fernando Alonso - 2012 
Fighting for the championship all the way to the end in what was usually the fourth best car is incredible and he deserved that title so much. 

Lance Stroll - 2020 
So Stroll was good in 17 but 2020 was different. He was fourth in the championship at mid season before he had a poor run until his finest hour when her got pole in Istanbul. He also got two podiums. 

Pierre Gasly - 2021 
How did he constantly qualify in the top six week in week out? He battered Yuki and git a podium in Baku as well as really strong P4s in Netherlands and Mexico 

Jack Doohan - 2024 (doesn't really count though) 

Esteban Ocon - 2017 
So Ocon actually had a few contenders, with 22 and 23 (which he got a fair bit of bad luck in) being strong. However 2017 takes it as he was really good in his first full season in F1 and looked like a driver who could challenge for a title in the future. He also could have got a podium in Canada of not for Perez.

Ollie Bearman - 2024 
Only did three races, and two of them were very good, Baku and Saudi. Though I don't rate Saudi quite as highly as most do. 

Yuki Tsunoda - 2024 
After an inconsistent 21 and a poor 22 he improved a lot in 23 before really coming on strong in 2024, topping the midfield numerous times at the start of the year and getting consistent points to the end.

Isack Hadjar - N/A 

Alex Albon - 2023 
Getting great points out of that car and destroying his team mate. His P7's were great as well as qualifying fourth in Zandvoort 

Carlos Sainz. Jr - 2019 
IMO he was easily a top three driver  that year with his constant best to the rest finishes earning him a thoroughly deserved sixth place in the standings spot following his podium in Brazil which is the second best midfield performance I have seen these last five years 

Nico Hulkenburg - 2014
So Hulkenberg is really difficult because loads of his seasons are solid but not spectacular. 2013 was great and I was really tempted to put 2018 here because he was best of the rest that year. But his mistakes in Baku and Spa held me back  and ultimately I think 2014 is his best.

While he hasn\'t shown any signs of being mistake prone, making the step to a top car can be a bit much sometimes (especially next to someone like Verstappen), resulting in a relative step back.

Does anyone have stats on how many Melbourne GPs have been raced wet?

I am in Melbourne, and although I am not a weather man, I reckon it is absolutely going to bucket. The atmosphere here is currently thick with humidity, ready to burst with a thunderstorm on Sunday.

I have a feeling that Melbourne would be quite slippery, with its longer curves and tight spots. Should be a corker!","['16mm of rain are currently forecast, but it‚Äôs Melbourne mate‚Ä¶ you will get a scorching dry day, wind, and rain all in one day.\n\nDon‚Äôt bother trying to predict.', 'Plus the added bonus, for us fans, of all those rookies being let loose in the wet!!', 'lol a humid Thursday has zero relevance to what the weather will be doing in 4 days time. And slipperiness has nothing to do with track design, it depends entirely on the road surface and drainage. \n\nBut one thing we can agree on it will be a corker!', ""I mean 99% of the time rain being forecast for a GP means it'll start like right after the podium or something, so don't get your hopes up lol"", '2010 was the only time they used the wet weather tyres. Had a couple wet quali days, too.', 'If the forecast says rain, most likely it will be dry.

1j9w9be,Could Norris have been WC in '24?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j9w9be/could_norris_have_been_wc_in_24/,2025-03-12, Discussion,"Just watching D2S, and was reminded how close it was at some point, and also the mistakes that McLaren made.

So if everything is equal, since we can't predict what would have happened with cars in other places, could McLaren have secured a win for Norris by just not screwing up the strategies?","['Its always if, if, if you know? If my mom had balls she would‚Äôve been my dad', 'Could? Yes there was enough points on the table.\n\nHow easy would it have realistically been, it would have needed a pretty flawless run of about 15 races from Norris, and Verstappen would still have held the significant points advantage to play around with.', ""It wasn't close at any point. There wasn't a stretch of races where McLaren could be dominant and Norris could've racked five, six wins in a row to deplete Max's advantage built in the beginning of the year.\n\nNorris could've won the WDC if he and McLaren were perfect Miami onwards, but that wasn't the case. And we shouldn't expect a team that two years ago started with one of the worst cars of the grid and a driver who hadn't even won his first race before last year to be absolutely perfect to chase a 80+ point lead."", 'This is the problem with ""could haves"" and ""ifs"". Sure, Norris *could* have been the driver\'s champion if a bunch of shit happened differently. Zhou *could* also have replaced Lewis at Merc if a bunch of shit happened differently', 'It would have been the biggest comeback in f1 history.\n\nIt was doable, but it would have been such an outstanding achievement that no one in the history of the sport has ever achieved.', ""Realistically, no. People glommed onto the mathematical possibility in hopes of a run to the end, the reality is that but despite RBR's decline, they were still too consistent to overcome.\n\nWhen you're in the latter half of the season and still hoping for DNFs to swing the championship, you've already lost. Even if you win, it's going to be a freak fluke."", 'No. Too much went wrong for him to be able to get to a point where he had a realistic shot at winning it. \n\nFirstly McLaren didn‚Äôt have the car to compete until Miami and even then it was still sometimes hit and miss on pace. DTS I know illustrates it as if he had been underperforming until Miami. The truth was that there was no Miami car until Miami. Some days it was the fastest and it was dominant, others it was second fastest, other times it was muddling about in P5. The consistency wasn‚Äôt good enough on a technical level. When the Red Bull was dominant, it was *dominant*. When the McLaren was dominant it did so in bursts but could easily fall back behind Red Bull/Ferrari/Mercedes depending on the track and conditions. That‚Äôs where Max‚Äôs points comfort came from. \n\nSecondly, Norris‚Äô own shortcomings. Granted it was a massive learning curve for someone who started the year hanging around the bottom of the top 5 and ended it with 4 race wins and 8 pole positions. However he was not consistent enough when he needed to be. Would it have been enough to overhaul the points difference? Probably not. Even when he had perfect weekends, Max was right there behind him making it so no matter how far ahead he finished, if Max was P2 (as he often was) it didn‚Äôt make enough of a dent. Also when Max had off days, Norris also had off days (Spa, Baku, Hungary, Monza) so he was never really able to capitalise on those moments.\n\nThirdly, the McLaren pitwall. Sometimes the strategy was just so bad. How can you save a new medium for *a specific situation*, have that situation handed to you on a plate *and still* mess it up? There were times where the pitwall was static, as if they were unable to react to the situation in front of them and deviate from their pre-planned simulation. They were unable to decide what to do in Canada in particular which ended up costing him a win. But when it wasn‚Äôt the strategy it was that race engineer of his giving the wrong information or completely missing a double yellow flag that his driver didn‚Äôt know about because he was driving with tunnel vision. \n\nFinally, Max had nothing to lose if he crashed into Lando. He knew that. The points cushion was so significant that he could afford to play silly games knowing Lando needed the points more and had much more to lose with McLaren chasing the constructors title. \n\nCould he have been WC in 2024? No, there was too much against him including himself.', ""Honestly? No. \n\nDTS highlights McLaren's mistakes for drama but all teams make them, they're not something you can 100% solve for. \n\nMy personal opinion is that McLaren knowingly went for the constructors and removing 'papaya rules' when they did was just a bonus round if anything. Even if they didn't make any mistakes a lot would have had to go right for them at that stage of the season for Lando to have overtaken Max and stay there.\n\nI'll be really interested to see if their approach changes this year should their performance hold."", ""if you swap the drivers and their points since miami, sure max would've been champion\n\nBut it was landos first rodeo and its a bit unfair to expect that of him, but also winning in that car isnt a herculean task, nando, hamilton could've done it 100% and probably russel and leclerc etc""]",0,42,0.15,0,332,332,0,0,0.0,0
