1iefeke,My experience at a Formula 1 factory,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iefeke/my_experience_at_a_formula_1_factory/,2025-01-31, Throwback,"Hey folks, as the title would suggest, I've had the absolute pleasure to be invited to a formula 1 factory. Not just once, but twice. The first time for a full factory tour, and the 2nd to watch the abu Dhabi final race in 2019. The F1 team in question was Renault (now Alpine) for anyone new to F1. 

I've never seen a more innovative space in my life, so I cannot even imagine what the tier 1 teams like Ferrari/Red Bull and Mercedes are doing in their factories. 

The speed that they operate is, quite frankly, obscene. And it's not like you're watching people run from building to building, from desk to desk in order to be the first and fastest person to complete a CAD drawing. It's very calm, very quiet. But what is fast, is the underlying process. We were told that by the time a CAD drawing had been approved for a physical build (mere hours between the two), that by the time the drawing had made it down to the CAD machine, the next and even better version of that drawing was already in pre approval, and the drawing from 10am was already out of date because the 1pm drawing was coming through, by the time the 1pm drawing made it, the 4pm drawing was the best. The rate of development is not done in days, its done in minutes and hours and I don't think people quite understand just how fast the teams operate. 

Couple of other things I saw. The full chassis, including components such as bare carbon front wings. The wing alone was incredible, not just to look at, but they had us gently feel underneath the wing to see if we would feel the aero holes for data collection. Honestly without looking AND feeling you don't even know they're there, but they're all over the underside of the front wing. I can't remember exactly the distance of separation, but there were hundreds of these holes all designed to send aero data back to whoever needs it. I'm not surprised they cost multiple hundreds of thousands. 

Another section of the factory had, I don't even know what they were called, but machine that were making flow systems for the oil pipes. Now, in my brain, I just figured it would be a beautifully custom pipe made out of carbon/rubber. What I actually learned was that the pipes were clear, and nearly as hard as carbon, so that they could not only check the oil flow rate laterally, but actually see it with their own eyes, and shine a lizard through the oil from straight down to get a three dimensional flow rate to see if all sections of the pipe had equal flow. Imagine looking into a pipe made of glass that has oil flowing through it, and a Lazer measuring the flow rate from both inside the pipe, but from the outside looking in. Maybe this is used in other industries, but it actually blew my mind to see this.

The most secretive part was the gearbox. We couldn't even go in the room, but we could peer through the various windows to see what they were working on. The room was like a 'clean room', everyone was wearing full biohazard suits, and absolutely every gearbox was covered from view, even the other factory guys. One of the Renault folks asked if we could see a fully and half built gearbox, they did a quick look around to see who could see in, checked hands and clothes for cameras and they unsheathed this thing like pulling the mask off Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. Fundamentally it's shaped like a wishbone, and it's like nothing you ever imagined a gearbox to look like. You feel like you could snap the thing in two like at Christmas dinner, but as with everything F1 related, it was full carbon. It just took me by surprise that it wasn't this circular or box shaped mechanical unit covered in oil, but something more aquatic, beautifully milled, shiny and built in a way I'd never seen. 

If anyone has seen that short clip in drive to survive from Williams where they have a wheel and tyre on a jig that comes towards the mechanics so they can practice pit stops, it's seeing stuff like that that truly puts into perspective how these teams operate. Things you've never seen but make sense in the context of Formula 1.

Was an incredible experience, and they're probably 10 fold more advanced than they were.

How I got the invite. It's a ""who you know not what you know"" scenario. Was invited on a press drive for a Renault product, found through conversation that one of the top Renault guys there was also an ex F1 mechanic, made a beeline to sit opposite him for dinner and talk all things F1. A week later I got an invite to the factory.","['I went to Virgin F1 back in 2011. Very different size and scope to what you have experienced.

1iekch6,Another Way to View the 2024 WDC & WCC Trends: 5-Race Rolling Sums,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iekch6/another_way_to_view_the_2024_wdc_wcc_trends_5race/,2025-01-31, Statistics,"We saw many times during and after the 2024 season how the season was split into 2 or even 3 to show the fluctuating form and performance of the top 4 teams. I've instead used rolling sums as a metric to see the changes on a more granular level and most of the trends throughout the season become quite apparent this way.

[5-Race Rolling Sums of the Drivers' Points from the Top 4 Teams in 2024 ](https://preview.redd.it/h4baoovb0dge1.png?width=6792&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9681cd8991ffa13e417226805b0620ce75052d2)

Each point in the graph shows the total points scored by a in the last 5 races, including that GP. So, for example, the value for the 15th race of the season (Dutch GP) shows the total number of points that driver scored from the 11th race (Austrian GP) up to, and including, the Dutch GP.

Some of the trends that stand out are Verstappen's struggles, especially just before and after the summer break, Hamilton's rise and fall in form, and conversely, Leclerc's late season resurgence.

[Drivers who Had the Highest 5-Race Rolling Sums at a Point](https://preview.redd.it/io2cczkx2dge1.png?width=6792&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b053b2cb94b7beccf38eed3dcd34547e0736a30)

At different points in the season there are 5 different drivers who have scored the most points in the last 5 races before that point: Verstappen, Hamilton, Piastri, Norris and Leclerc.

[Perez's Ranking Based on Points Scored in the Last 5 Races](https://preview.redd.it/s95kxlov3dge1.png?width=4519&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4781184a60ddf524e3b09f97f8115ec756f2a8)

Perez's sharp decline is also impossible to miss here. After remaining 8th in this respect for most of the season, the he dropped to 15th place with 2 (two) points collected in the last 5 races of the season.

**On the teams' side of things:**

The fluctuations between the front 4 teams that marked the 2024 season are also clearly evident here, including:

* Red Bull's dominant start to the season, 
* McLaren seemingly having the strongest car for most of the middle part of the season,
* Ferrari's strong finish to the season, and
* The brief period of races where even Mercedes looked the fastest. 

All 4 teams had a point in the season where they were at the top according to this metric.

**Best of the Rest:**

The teams in the middle of the pack have also had a season of ups and downs. Some trends that are reflected in this graph:

* Aston Martin's very strong start to the season leading to a comfortable 5th place with points gained in the first half of the season. 
* RB being the first team to challenge Aston Martin for the title of ‚Äòbest of the rest‚Äô,
* Haas to take over 6th place from RB, having accumulated points more consistently throughout the season, and
* Alpine pulling a rabbit out of the hat at the closing stages of the season.","['Thx for the data, as you said this season was really changeable and you made these‚Äôd changers visual.\nRip Perez and Alpine Renaissance', 'This is nice job.
