1oy2wrx,What podium has the most amount of race wins represented on the podium?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oy2wrx/what_podium_has_the_most_amount_of_race_wins/,2025-11-15, Discussion,"So (correct me if I’m wrong) but Turkey 2020 is the race that has the most amount of world championships on the podium- 11, (Hamiltons 7 (having just won his 7th), Vettels 4, and Perez’s 0.)

I’m intrigued as to the exact same question but race wins. Because this race has Lewis’s at the time 90ish, Sebs 52, and Perez’s 0, so thats 140-150ish. 

Is this the highest? Max is on 65, Lewis 105 and Lec/Pia/Nor are 10ish. So they could easily beat it if Lewis could make it to the podium in a Ferrari. 

A Prost Senna Mansell wouldn’t do it as they’re combined total now is only 123. Schumacher in his latter years didn’t share the grid with 2 20+ winners.
