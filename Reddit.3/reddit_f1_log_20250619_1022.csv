This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

In Aus our famous race is the Bathurst 1000. 1000km of good tough racing.\n\nCould bring back a fuel pit stop, driver changes (although not so sure how easy that is in F1, so other option could be driver/car swap... Downside to that though is it allows a fresh car at each swap rather than a car that's done 560km with 340km to go) and great strategy.\n\nOne option could be for teams to just race 1 car and have their drivers share the drive.\n\nOther option is for teams to have 2 cars, use the F1 driver as a main driver and have an F2 or backups or whatever as the secondary driver.\n\nOr allow team to chose what they want.\n\nJust don't do it on a track like Monaco... Needs to be a track that has good overtaking prospects and long enough to allow good racing."", 'I just updated my f1 app and now it isn’t working on the iOS 26 beta.

Norris lacks a winners mentality and isn't a stable performer but he has some raw speed in his gut. Piastri is a mental strong diver but he lacks some raw speed that Norris has. Mcclaren's duo is not optimal and a driver like Verstappen, Leclerc or Russel would do a much better job in the car. It's a hard one for Mcclaren but atleast they should make clear to not crash and try stupid things against eigother. They are not that far ahead in the championship."", 'Nico knows the power of his curse, he has to now back Oscar as WDC in order for the opposite to happen and for Lando to be WDC.
