I’m not too sure who to put 5th but I went Piquet. You can make arguments for Mansell, Villeneuve, Lauda and Watson (but as Watson, Lauda and Villeneuve weren’t around for most of the decade I excluded them).\n\n1990s: Schumacher > Senna > Prost > Villeneuve > Frentzen\n\nFirst is self explanatory, even though Senna and Prost were only around for 4 and three years respectively, their best years in this decade are better than anyone else bar Schumacher. Senna is quite unfortunate not to top either the 1980s or 1990s because his peak stretches across two separate decades. If I did a 1985-1994 decade he would top it. 4th and 5th are contested, but Villeneuve’s 1997 and Frentzen’s 1999 tip the scales for me. You can make arguments for Hakkinen, Hill, Barrichello or Alesi for the other two spots.\n\n2000s: Alonso > Schumacher > Hamilton > Raikkonen > Button\n\nTop two are basically interchangeable for me. Hamilton and Raikkonen you can debate as well. Raikkonen was around for more of the decade, but Hamilton never had years as weak as Raikkonen’s 2002 or 2008, and I generally rate him above Raikkonen anyway. I wouldn’t argue if you put Raikkonen ahead based solely on the 2000s though. There’s a clear cut off between 5th and 6th for this decade in my opinion.\n\n2010s: Hamilton > Alonso > Verstappen > Vettel > Rosberg\n\nTop two are interchangeable for me. Verstappen > Vettel might be controversial but Verstappen never had the lows of this decade (2010, 2014 2018) that Vettel did despite being so young and his 2018 (post-Monaco) and 2019 is every bit as good if not better than Vettel’s best years. You can swap them and I wouldn’t complain though. 5th is between Rosberg, Ricciardo and Button but I went Rosberg.\n\n2020s: Verstappen > Hamilton > Leclerc > Norris > Russell\n\nI guess it’s fairly self-explanatory. Verstappen will stay top, the other four will shift around depending on how the rest of the decade goes (they’re all close at the moment, but Hamilton will probably slide back with future years).

So that imo puts Raikkonen ahead of Hamilton. Also he had incredibly impressive 2001/02 and 2007 was good as well. 2009 was overall good as well. I think Raikkonen can easily be bumped ahead of Hamilton, just because of the sheer influence he had in that decade. Also, he was definitely better than Button overall.', 'A solid list overall.
