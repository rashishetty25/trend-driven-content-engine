At least it’s at the end of the season and not before summer break.', "">This technical directive is quite something. With immediate effect, the FIA is banning special protective plates that around 50 percent of the teams had fitted over the skid blocks. Red Bull pointed out to the association that this practice is illegal.\n\n>It's the big issue with the ground effect cars. How deep can I drive without the skid blocks in the underbody wearing out too much due to contact with the road surface? The critical value for the screws that fix the floor panel to the car is one millimeter. Anyone who exceeds this will be disqualified, as Mercedes and Ferrari did at the 2023 US GP.\n\n>Because the downforce of the cars is heavily dependent on the height of the vehicle, the teams have come up with every conceivable trick over the last three years to protect the fastening screws as well as possible. They have experimented with insulating material between the base plate or with bolts that have a certain amount of play to cushion the impact from the track.\n\n>Red Bull discovered the trick first\n\n>The latest trick was to provide the sid-blocks, which are used for measurement by the FIA inspectors, with special protection. This applies above all to the fastening screw in the rear area of the base plate. Everyone wants to drive as low as possible in order to gain downforce.\n\n>Around 50 percent of the field believed they had found a loophole in the regulations. Red Bull was the first to discover the so-called protection skids among the competition. These are said to include Ferrari, Mercedes and Haas. World Championship opponents McLaren, on the other hand, like Red Bull, did without this practice.\n\n>What are the consequences of the ban?\n\n>Red Bull pointed out to the FIA that the trick was illegal if the rules were applied precisely and that a protest would have to be expected if there was no clarification on this issue. And this came promptly. A week before the Las Vegas GP, all teams received a letter. In a technical directive, the FIA announced that the protective skids in question were not permitted. This assessment applies with immediate effect. Ferrari would have liked to move the date to the Qatar GP, but were unable to get their way.\n\n>The teams affected now have a problem that is all the greater when the aerodynamics are specifically designed for extremely low ground clearance. Because no one can risk the skid blocks rubbing off too much, the relevant teams have to raise their vehicle height to a safe level. And that could cost one or the other a lap time.\n\nTranslated via DeepL"", 'Vegas might be fine, but Qatar…..Merc and Ferrari will get fucked up.

A bit like if we were to rock up to Bahrian at the beginning of 2026 (after the rule upgrades) & the fastest teams are Williams, Haas & Aston Martin.

- Button won 6 of the first 7, but then only scored 2 podiums (no wins) over the last 10 races.

- Teams would be competitive one race, then absolutely nowhere the next. And we're not talking like this year whereby Ferrari might win one race, then be fighting Mercedes for 3rd fastest car the next - rather teams on the podium one race then back of the grid the next.

- The three champions on the grid - Hamilton, Raikkonen & Alonso - absolute non-entities for most of the season.

- Double diffuser controversy.

- F1 on the verge of splitting into two.

1gvx4ox,Penalty point distribution analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gvx4ox/penalty_point_distribution_analysis/,2024-11-20, Statistics,"**Intro**  
After seeing a picture of the top 10 most penalized drivers circulating online, I was curious about the probability of the current penalty point distribution among nationalities. So, I did a small analysis of the current distribution. And found some interesting results I would like to share, mostly to ask for help in improving the analysis from the community. Please don't take this as an excuse to express gut feelings over bias. Some of the results may be highly unlikely but none of the results are beyond possible. I'm also no journalist, just an F1 nerd!

**Summary**  
I collected all data I could find about penalty points given per driver and the races they participated in per year. To this, I added the nationality they race under (Albon is Thai in the analysis). I then assumed penalty points to be normally distributed. I analyzed the result per nationality and took the variance from the mean as a measure. When you only take into consideration nationalities from which driver partook in at least 100 races you get the following results.

As many noted in the original post given the amount of races driven by British drivers they are quite absent in the top 10. The likelihood of this given this analysis would be around 14% (50% for the mean - 36%). Although highly unlikely not improbable. It could however be a signal of potential bias, yet I wouldn't go as far based on the current analysis.

Another interesting result is that both Russia and the Netherlands, have quite the variance from the mean. However drivers such as Kyvat, Mazepin, and Verstappen, who are more generally deemed aggressive drivers the results are more understandable.

**Discussion**  
I feel the analysis could be quite a lot better, and for that, I'm hoping some of the kind souls of r/Formula1  would be willing to assist. I'm yet to find a good index or database with all penalty points per race. I have found this up until 2021, but after that, I'm reliant on articles that don't specify where the points were given.

The results would also mean more if it would take into consideration all infringements investigated by the stewards. That would further improve the reliability of the analysis.

Beyond that assuming the results would be normally distributed is a stretch, even though the dataset is large, it fails to take into consideration all nuances of motorsport. This however is the best method I could come up with to check the results for potential bias.

Lando had plenty of races to make up the points gap, but instead Max has actually extended his lead since Miami.\n\nSo I do think the media were very eager to desperately jump on a potential wdc fight narrative, when Lando never really got that close, but in a perfect world for Lando and McLaren they did have a shot at it.', ""I think that the title chances were real in the sense that, were you to swap Verstappen and Norris, Verstappen would have won the championship in the McLaren.\n\nBut I think it was obvious from the beginning that Norris is no Verstappen (at least not yet).
