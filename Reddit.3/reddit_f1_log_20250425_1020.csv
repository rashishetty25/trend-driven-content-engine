The new US racing team will replace Ferrari\'s customer engines with its own powertrain starting in 2029. We reveal how far the project has progressed.**\n\n> Things are moving fast at General Motors. On March 7, the new US racing team, operating under the Cadillac flag, received FIA approval to compete as the eleventh team in the Formula 1 World Championship starting in 2026. Exactly 47 days later, the International Automobile Federation gave the project a second green light. General Motors Performance Power Units will be allowed to compete with its own engine starting in 2029.\n\n> This gives the American dream a face. For the first three years, Cadillac will still be using Ferrari customer engines. Then, the heart of a US engine will beat in the two factory cars. It\'s an ambitious project that will be built in a newly built factory in Charlotte over the next three years. The factory is scheduled for completion this year and will be equipped with ten state-of-the-art test benches from the Austrian specialist AVL.\n\n> FIA President Mohammed bin Sulayem takes pride in the success story: ""Over two years ago, the FIA \u200b\u200bapproved the addition of an eleventh team to the Formula 1 World Championship, guided by my vision to expand the field with new talent. While the process has been challenging at times, the progress we have made demonstrates that it has been worth the journey. It is another step in the sport\'s global expansion and underscores the growing interest from world-class automakers like General Motors.""\n\n> **Greatest possible challenge.**\nGeneral Motors has set itself the most difficult task imaginable for its entry into the engine market. Instead of waiting for the next regulatory cycle starting in 2031, the Americans are investing heavily in an engine concept that may only last for two years. The technical challenge of the drive system has never been greater than with the regulations that will take effect in 2026 and remain in effect until 2030.\n\n> Manufacturers are faced with a V6 turbo that must run on climate-neutral fuel and a significantly higher proportion of electrification. Whether the planned 55:45 power split between combustion engine and electric power will be maintained will be discussed at a meeting of the Formula 1 Commission on Thursday (April 24).\n\n> The mere fact that Ferrari and RB Powertrains, two of the five engine manufacturers currently in the field, are pushing to reduce the electric component, at least in racing, demonstrates how difficult the task is. With General Motors\' approval, the rebel club gains another member. Anything that reduces the complexity of the drivetrain helps a newcomer.\n\n> **First engine to run in summer.**\nThe team led by engine boss Russ O\'Blenes has ambitious plans. They must first focus on designing a powertrain that meets the current rulebook. They can\'t rely on backroom politics for success. Just as the attempt to switch to a ten-cylinder naturally aspirated engine by 2029 at the latest has already failed. Mercedes, Audi, and Honda reject this.\n\n> General Motors had already been preparing to build its own engine before final approval. Single-cylinder tests have been underway for some time. The first prototype of a six-cylinder turbocharged engine is scheduled for completion this summer. The project is now subject to the budget cap for engine manufacturers.\n\n> Each newcomer is granted three years of development time. GM is subject to the same limits as Audi between 2023 and 2025. In the first two years, GM is allowed to invest $105 million each in the development of the powertrain. In 2028, this will be reduced to $100 million, but in total, $25 million more than the established manufacturers such as Mercedes, Ferrari, and Honda were granted. Once the engine is in use, a limit of $130 million per season applies to all.', ""GM isn't a stranger to making race motors."", 'Wish my dad was still here.

In [today's post on his Substack](https://robertreidwrc.substack.com/p/time-on-my-hands) he makes some comments that jumped out to me:

>(...)

>In motorsport, we could do more here. We have legends, incredible figures whose stories shaped the sport. But too often, we focus only on the now. We race forward, literally and figuratively, without stopping to look back.

>Imagine a formal way to recognise past champions at key events. A way to connect generations. A way to remind everyone, drivers, fans, organisers, that what we do stands on the shoulders of those who came before. That history isn’t a weight, it’s a foundation.

>(...)

>Motorsport has always faced the challenge of governance, across series, regions, and levels. That’s a conversation for another time (and one I plan to return to). But it’s worth noting that strong leadership doesn’t have to mean rigidity. It means purpose. And when that purpose is clear, whether you’re running a golf club or a world championship, the sport benefits.

>Motorsport can feel global but disconnected. Fans don’t always feel close to the sport, even when they’re passionate about it. The sense of intimacy is sometimes lost in the noise of the big show. If we could make events feel more felt, more human, I think we’d find new ways to build loyalty, storytelling, and belonging. That’s not about making everything smaller. It’s about making everything matter more.

>Stepping back from day-to-day responsibility has allowed me to reflect more freely on the sport I’ve loved for a lifetime. Watching the Masters this year reminded me of what great sport can feel like when it’s confident in itself, quiet, precise, meaningful.

>Motorsport has so much going for it. Incredible talent. Iconic events. A truly global reach. But sometimes, to move forward, it helps to look sideways. To see how other sports create meaning and how we might do the same.

It's too soon to assume he will be a FIA presidential contender in December, but when reading all this, I still hold out some hope.

What do you think?","['And other FIA news - [Wilson nominated as FIA deputy president for sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cvgp8v3w3ryo)\n\n>\n\n>Ben Sulayem nominated Wilson without first seeking the support or approval of MotorsportUK, the UK\'s national sporting authority.\n\n>A spokesperson for MotorsportUK said: ""We were unaware that Malcolm was being proposed as deputy president of sport for the FIA. It came as complete surprise to us.""', '>It\'s too soon to assume he will be a FIA presidential contender in December, but when reading all this, I still hold out some hope.\n\n>What do you think?\n\nI think we need to see some policy from Reid before talking him up as a presidential candidate. These comments are just him waxing lyrical about motorsport, but there is no real substance to what he is saying.\n\nOne of the reasons why he quit was because he disliked the decision to take promotion of the World Rallycross Championship in-house. So maybe he can start there and explain how he would handle the commercial rights to World RX differently to ben Sulayem. Because World RX has been struggling for years: it had a mass exodus of manufacturers a while ago, it has suffered multiple event cancellations, it has gone through a mess of regulation changes, and the support series are confusing and inconsistent. It is a series that is desperately in need of reform, and with the collapse of the World Touring Car Championship and the struggles of the TCR World Tour, there is a danger here that 40% of the premier motorsport categories will have folded in recent years unless some kind of action is taken.\n\nAnd so far, all I\'ve seen from Reid is ""how good is motorsport?"".', ""The way this reads is that marketing and promotion, branding should change. F1 is elite and targeted mostly to an upper to high level clientele, which has only increased (exponentially) in the DTS years. Growth is not a bad thing, but excluding entire classes of fans is not good.\n\nIt sounds like Mr. Reid wants to not only create greater appeal to all fans, though indeed, no mention of costs or economics, there is mention of enhancing the experience, presumably at the track and perhaps in the media, which could be fun, especially for newer fans. If they can afford to get to a race.\n\nSeems like there are always previous racers at events, but we don't necessarily get to see them. Or you can see segments of interviews on certain networks who have the rights. But mostly it's all the same questions and answers from the media anyway so you can see why the drivers are frustrated.\n\nInterview different people like engineers, mechanics, strategists, all the people involved in the racing. Storytelling. Get creative. Nicole Piastri was on a podcast. It was fun. Gunther and Mattia's ride in a tiny Fiat going to Mattia's vineyard. It's different. \n\nAll the luxury sponsors are nice, but they aren't relatable to most viewers, though a few team sponsors definitely would be. Probably lots of people love the aspirational nature of lots of the brands, some can certainly afford it, but they're out of reach for many.\n\nThere's been times I thought of splurging for a ticket, but the ones I can afford don't seem to have any shade and that would be difficult. Doesn't have to be a/c, just some shade!"", 'I am neither in favor nor against the decision, but why would the FIA need approval from MotorsportUK to nominate anyone?', ""Even if it is not written down as a rule, it is generally expected that governing associations don't secretly poach officials from groups that they supervise. Of course we are not privy to the discussions that may have taken place (who knows if Mr Wilson initiated the contact or agreed to it)."", ""I don't believe it matters mid-term, but were there an election and MBS had made his presidential list then it would matter as it is in the FIA internal regulations for the list making.\n\n>**1.5.1** In order to be eligible, a list must:     \n\n>* be accompanied by the consent in writing of each candidate and, with the exception of the list leader, by **a letter certifying the agreement of the Full Member of the FIA to which the candidate belongs.**"", ""I think it's more about common courtesy for the FIA to let them know.\n\nRemarkable in this story is that MotorsportUK's chairman [David Richards has been critical of MBS](https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/c1755nl01x9o), so the FIA not giving them a heads-up seems petty to me?"", ""Well, it's not exactly standard practice either to help get someone elected as FIA president with the backing of the largest motorsport body, only to later turn around and publicly denounce them.

Vettel or Leclerc ? And how do they compare with Hamilton and Sainz that year ?', 'When was the last time Max crashed?', 'What are the realistic changes to the regs next year and for 2028 vs what is already planned? I keep seeing articles about engine changes or key differences in aero regs, but they can’t seriously be changing much for next year, right? And now with Cadillac in agreeing to new engine regs surely not that much will change for ‘28, right?', 'Stoffel Vandoorne was 10 milliseconds away in qualifying of the 2018 Canadian GP from avoiding getting ""Vandoorned"" and thus preventing the existence of that verb.', 'It\'s largely just second hand reporting of ""paddock rumours"". \n\nMost of the time that just means some journalists have talked to people they know in the teams and that the Mercedes staff seem confident they\'ve done a good job.', 'It’s a lot of paddock rumours, and assumptions based on Mercedes’ talk about confidence in 2026 and opposition to returning the v10s or other types of engine.', 'I think you could go either way on Vettel and Leclerc in 2019, they were extremely evenly matched. Personally I think Leclerc was more impressive considering his age, but in terms of who was the better one on pure performance it’s basically a tossup. \n\nAs for how they compare to Hamilton and Sainz: I think Hamilton’s 2019 was quite good, but not to the level of his 2018, as he had quite a few off weekends where Bottas beat him on merit. I’d take Hamilton over Vettel and Leclerc but not by much. Sainz had a good season as well, but he also had a handful of incidents (Bahrain, Singapore), and I think he was stronger in 2020.\n\nBasically, I would rank the 2019 drivers you mentioned like:\n\nHamilton >= Leclerc = Vettel > Sainz', 'Vettel and Leclerc in 2019 are weird to compare. From memory, Leclerc was clearly better as he hit the higher heights and Vettel clearly suffered the lower lows. This is probably exaggerated by the lens through which the season was viewed at the time; we knew Leclerc was probably special, but surely not special enough to go toe-to-toe with a special 4x WDC in Vettel in year two.\n\nIn reality, they were very evenly matched on pure pace. Vettel was ahead 9-7 when both finished, though one of those was the controversial Singapore GP when Leclerc was undercut while leading. Leclerc lost the Bahrain win to mechanical failure and got absolutely shafted by the team in Monaco quali, though those issues are at least somewhat cancelled out by Seb’s mechanical issues in Sochi and Austin. Seb’s mistakes in Bahrain, Silverstone, Monza and Interlagos cost him a good number of points and dragged his season overall down to a level that was a bit below his best, but Charles lost himself some points at Hockenheim and Suzuka.\n\nOverall, neither driver was at their best. It felt like Seb in particular was still reeling from having folded mentally in the 2018 title fight, and his slight inferiority to Leclerc can basically be attributed to that, with all the mitigating factors elsewhere coming close to cancelling each other out.\n\nIt’s probably safe to say the best Hamilton was slightly better than the best Vettel, so in a year where Hamilton was close to his best and Vettel some way below his, Lewis was clearly better. \n\nSainz is much harder to judge. There’s no question he had a great year, but he was in a situation where it was quite easy for him to achieve the best possible result at most weekends, with the clear fourth fastest car and a rookie team-mate. Given he was not too far off Leclerc later on as team-mates, he’s probably somewhere in the Leclerc/Vettel range for 2019 and arguably slightly better.', ""Hamilton was champion in 2019. He won eleven of the twenty-one races, while Vettel and Leclerc only won three between them, so there's not really much of a comparison to make. Vettel and Leclerc were fairly evenly-matched throughout the year; the only finished four points apart at the end of 2019. As for Sainz, McLaren finished third overall in the Constructors' championship, but Vettel had nearly three times as many points as Sainz by the end of the year. McLaren were very much rebuilding after the Honda disaster -- 2019 was only their second year with Renault engines -- and it wasn't really until the second half of 2023 that they started getting consistent results that they could build upon now.""]",5,14,0.73,5,13,13,3,8,0.09999999999999998,3

But this is always how Lewis has been, really feeling the emotions, positive or negative post race.\n\nUltimately Lewis is 40, he's not at his 2018/2019 peak anymore, but he also isn't washed.
