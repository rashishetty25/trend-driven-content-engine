&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY “NEW”.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

But the son of racing legend Michael Schumacher believes he can return.\n\nAll doors in the premier class have closed for Mick Schumacher (25). The son of racing legend Michael Schumacher will drive in the World Endurance Championship in 2025, with Alpine - but the dream of Formula 1 remains, as he emphasises in Bild am Sonntag.\n\n‘Formula 1 will always be a part of my life. I decided at the age of eleven that I wanted to drive there. That is still my goal, this racing series was and is my lifelong dream. I still have unfinished business with Formula 1 and want to prove myself there once again.’\n\n‘When I look at the current starting grid of the premier class, I have no doubt that I could keep up. I'm no worse. It would be nice if I could get another chance and prove that. Because I think a lot of people have labelled me wrong.’\n\nThe young Schumacher believes that a false impression has been created. ‘My reputation was determined more by negative public comments about me and not by what I can do well. I had the image of a crash driver.’\n\n***This was confirmed by accident pictures that showed the Haas racing car being smashed. Mick continues: ‘That's true, but what is not taken into account is that our car was designed for this. Due to the lack of fixed points, the design envisaged that it would split in the event of a side impact. Other cars would have survived that in one piece. I didn't communicate that at the time because I didn't want to provoke any more friction with the team.’***\n\n‘I was insecure and didn't put up a fight because I was shy. But at the end of the day, you need self-confidence and support in order to perform. I would put up more of a fight today. I've matured as a person and would no longer be so quick to say ‘it's all good’, but would stand my ground internally without compromise. I had to go through this maturing process to become who I am today.’\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", ""Based on what, exactly?

1irjnjd,Can the drivers protest the swearing ban by just not turning up in Melbourne?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1irjnjd/can_the_drivers_protest_the_swearing_ban_by_just/,2025-02-17, Discussion,"Let's be real, the teams are the heart of the sport. They can do just fine without MBS, but MBS won't survive without their participation in the weekends. Putting this in mind, can they make gains by just sitting out every weekend until MBS resigns or atleast retracts the swearing ban?

Iirc they did something similar in Kyalemi in 1982, so it's definitely not unheard of.","['In theory, yes. In practice, never ever gonna happen.', 'A full boycott is unlikely, what they should do is all agree to swear as much as possible and basically dare the FIA to suspend every single one of them', 'same as the fans - we could just boycott watching but not many will at the end of the day so things will carry on.', 'Race in Melbourne as normal.\n\nSwear enough in China and Japan, until it warrants a race ban in Bahrain or Saudi Arabia.', ""They couldn't boycott a race because of covid\n\nThey couldn't boycott a race because of a missile strike\n\nSo they won't do it for swearing"", ""I think we're worrying about it more than the drivers. It's a stupid rule but they're not gonna do that."", 'If I was them I’d just all agree to go around and around at 50mph and just swear non stop. Make it a procession that’s slow AF.
