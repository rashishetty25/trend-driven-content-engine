They need to be more firm just as Russell and Verstappen were about what needed to happen, else they won't ever change cause it's been happening for years. I'm surprised Hamilton wasn't more decisive but I suppose new team new relationship so he was still learning how the atmosphere would be like.

Just now in Australia you saw his start, Imola 2021 also comes to mind. \n\nFor Lando, the F1 youtube channel even made a video on his talent. Where Max is great in wet races, Lando is great at wet qualifying. The F1 youtube video shows how he takes unique lines and takes crazy amounts of kerb but somehow gains time while others avoid the kerb. Memorable moments are China last year where he qualified over a second faster than Lewis in second. Also Spa 2021 where he was dominating that qualifying session. In that race George even noticed Lando takes a very sharp line in turn 1 and he tried the same, getting a purple first sector and qualifying 2nd in a Williams.\n\nObviously there are other drivers good in the wet, for Lewis you could find lots of examples.

Personally in my opinion the current grid is the best it has ever been in terms of talent but I'd definitely be open to the idea of being corrected.

You have absolute top tier talents in Verstappen, Leclerc, Hamilton, Russell, Norris, Piastri, Alonso, Sainz etc..the level below them as well is still extremely strong.
