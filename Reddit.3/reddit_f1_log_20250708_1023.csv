Afterward, he said he only saw the red rear light at the last moment‚Äîtoo late to react.

**That made me wonder: why do F1 rain lights still blink during heavy spray?**

In light rain, blinking might help grab attention. But in dense spray, the off-moments make the car ahead briefly invisible, which is exactly when you need to see it. A solid, constantly lit rain light would likely be more visible through the mist, even if less ‚Äúattention-grabbing‚Äù on paper.

According to older threads and technical docs, the rain light flashes at ~4Hz in wet conditions and ~2Hz during ERS harvesting, but a solid mode does exist (like during pit limiter). Why not use it when visibility is at its worst?

With wet races becoming more common, shouldn't the FIA consider making the rain light stay on instead of flashing in extreme spray?","[""A blinking or strobing light demands your attention, a single continuous light would eventually start being ignored because it's there constantly.

I'm not too sure what the exact expected course of action is here, but I feel like the stewards expected Tsunoda to immediately concede the corner if he cannot be in control.

3. Ferrari - Will have a strong package like always, not having to switch to single turbo will give them slight advantage

4. Mclaren - Strong podium contender but given there extreme development to secure title this year it may be hard for them to compete for titles in coming years however the merc engine will work well for them

5. Williams - will be close with mclaren due to williams ignoring this year to focus on next regs and also having the merc engine, will have disadvantage due to lack of funding

6. Red Bull - Implosion for red bull with verstappens departure seeming iminent, newey wheatley leaving and horner may be out aswell, the switch to full works team may disadvantage them.

7. Alpine - Merc engine will be only saviour of this car

8. Haas - probably will have better aero and chassis than alpine but the new regs are mainly engine focused

9. Cadillac - New team so has catching up to do although will be working all throughout this year to try and catch up

It's in their DNA from Enzo's days. The driver is just a tiresome burden.  \n\nThe last time the driver commanded respect was Schumacher and thats ONLY because the core team leaders came with him when he joined the team. \n\nThey have very unimaginative race strategy, slow to react to changing weather or race conditions. They genuinely seem bored and uninterested, like its an ordeal to suffer through.\n\n\nId fire the race strategy team and bring in fresh DNA that actually seems to care and have the ability to adapt to rapidly changing scenarios during the race."", ""100% they can.
