Even at first view, the spin and loss of the rear was FAR earlier than usual for an F1 car. When I saw it, my immediate thought was ""the car broke"" because it seemed like it spun while mostly on straight line braking. If the car spun as it tried to turn into the apex or coming out of the apex, that would be a typical ""too aggressive"" driver move but this really didn\'t seem like it.', 'A key trend in F1 at the moment is for fairly extreme anti-squat and anti-dive geometry to keep the car ""flat"" under acceleration and braking and preserve a consistent ride height for optimal aero.\n\nAll of that theoretically makes the car faster, but it reduces the ""feel"" for the driver. As an accomplished sim racer, Verstappen is probably well placed to exploit this and drive fast without being able to feel the car as well - might explain why RedBull cannot seem to find a team mate able to consistently exploit the car\'s capabilities. Verstappen isn\'t a magician,  there is simply a performance ceiling where the car couldn\'t lap any faster that he can get close to. Piastri\'s McLaren has more front anti-dive than Norris is comfortable with and is therefore theoretically faster IF he can exploit it.\n\nEvery change to the suspension that impacts squat/dive is going to slightly change the optimal brake bias and how the downforce level changes under acceleration and braking. Lewis just found where the limit is. If you never come off the track, you aren\'t trying hard enough to go fast.\n\nOn a fast track like Spa, consistent ride height and the ability to deliver more consistent ground effect downforce is going to allow less top-down aero and a higher top speed.

1ma0s2k,How much risk is involved with upgrading anything now compared to just focusing on next season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ma0s2k/how_much_risk_is_involved_with_upgrading_anything/,2025-07-26, Technical,"I genuinely thought that after a few races in we would not be seeing any more upgrades at all and only tweaks to previous components as well as the upgrades from the first few races. The only explanation I can think of related to the longevity of a teams perfomance is that these are upgrades that  let teams collect info for next year's car already and therefore act as testing for development, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if any components from this year's car can be reused/repurposed for next year to such a degree that it's worth it. It feels like it should be new concepts and cars like with the last regs but I'm not sure. 

It seems crazy to me to invest into this year's car unless you're red bull trying to get verstappen a title(since the constructors is decided anyway), and we have teams still slapping on new parts and spending budget on parts that won't even get to see a whole season instead of preparing for a whole new set of regulations. 

Is the squeeze of one extra constructors worth it perhaps? Since it's a few millions difference between constructors points maybe it's just worth it to spend a million or two in trying to secure another placement no matter what (or many if you're sauber squeezing out a few extra positions)? Is it to appease drivers or sponsors to not make them feel 'abandoned' for the season? 

It just feels like every dollar spent on the new reg is exponentially more valuable than the current one to me, and I'd love to see some discussion on what could make this strategy actually seem reasonable and effective rather than desperate which is how I feel about most of these upgrades right now. ","[""there's barely any development going on this season, most upgrades you're seeing are absolutely tiny changes, some of which probably have significant relevance to next season so they're just trying them out\n\nthe gaps between the teams are so incredibly small that even a small tweak to the fairing that leads to a suspension arm might bring you from q1 to q3 in some tracks, and if you can get data even tangentially relevant to 2026 from it, makes sense"", ""If you are RB, AM, Williams, Sauber, and Haas you really can't stop development right now.  Williams could just as easily finish P9 as P6 given how close everything is.  A million dollar investment in parts upgrades this season could pay out multiple times over if you can boost your WCC standings."", 'There‚Äôs money, prestige and drivers.\n\nFor a team like Williams or Haas the extra few millions from the constructors money is gonna make a huge difference. Remember when RBR breached the cost cap for a measly couple hundred thousand euros, Toto came out and said ‚ÄúThat would have been a new front wing for us‚Äù.\n\nFor a team like Ferrari who cannot afford to go backwards (because the media and Ferrari board will have their asses) any pole, podium or win is golden. It‚Äôs literally survive to fight another day for them.\n\nAnd lastly for teams like Red Bull, Aston and again Ferrari, they have to make their star drivers feel like they have a chance otherwise they start looking elsewhere or downright retirement.\n\nHaas managed to tank their 2021 season because they had two rookies and they were operating on cents anyway. Today no other team has that luxury. Even Alpine, who are dead last regardless, are looking to sell and need to show some promise.', 'Millions. Results/points = $.', ""At this point I think a lot of the upgrades still coming are things they knew they needed from the start (wings made for certain types of tracks that aren't as represented in the early season as an example like most teams will have a monza wing) or things that carry over to next time that you are testing (ferrari's suspension upgrade). I don't think there are a lot of upgrades if any made purely to optimize performance this year that don't also fit one of the two categories I mentioned.""]",2,5,0.67,2,5,5,2,3,0.17000000000000004,2

Does the car change that much from its counterpart based on driver preferences?,"[""For Red Bull specifically, they had to run a difference in spec at a number of races this year due to accident damage limiting their parts supply. Today they decided to put an update on Tsunodas car that was meant to only be on Verstappen's car this weekend (likely at the expense of not really having spares for it), so that's a topic.\n\nThis sometimes happens to teams, mostly due to accidents or because updates are introduced as soon as there are enough parts to support one car.\n\nTeams don't develop two different cars, though"", ""\n>Does the team prioritize that much more budget towards Max‚Äôs car?\n\nGenerally the driver further up the standings will always get priority for upgrades where only 1, or limited sets are available. This does mean Verstappen will essentially always have priority for updates.\n\nIn addition to this Yuki crashed which damaged update parts, due to the limited number of spares he was reverted to the older spec so both drivers would have spares available if required until more spares of the new spec could be manufactured. \n\n>Does the car change that much from its counterpart based on driver preferences?\n\nIn terms of actual component spec this isn't super common but it can happen sometimes. Piastri has been running some older spec parts than Norris because he, and his side of the garage prefer them for example.\n\nDrivers will however often differ on their setup according to their preferences. This can have quite a significant effect on how the car handles. Verstappen likes a relatively pointy sharp car, which a lot of drivers can't deal with. Yuki has been dialing in a bit more understeer for stability. A setup like that is theoretically slower but if it gives the driver more confidence they can wind up being faster with it than they would be with a more oversteery setup."", 'Sometimes there are differences between the cars if they only have upgrades finished for one of the two, or if there are setup differences between the two.\xa0\n\nBut I think in the context you are asking about, by number two car they mean the second team as a whole, which includes the driver skill as part of that.\xa0', ""Every driver sets up the car according to their preferences. Some cars are harder to set up in a way that makes them fast. Some cars are only able to go fast on really sensitive setups. In cases like red bull one driver can handle those extreme setups better than the other. And because Max was winning, they didn't try to change the car in a way that makes it fast even with a less extreme setup until it was too late. \n\nI feel like people don't really understand the difference between car and setup. The car is developed mainly by the engineers and not the drivers. The setup is to make the car more comfortable for the driver, so it's gonna change according to the driver. Alex Albon has said that the car is the same and it's just Max's setups that are extreme in the past."", ""The cars start out the same at the start of the season.

1m9tspb,Suggestion for Changes to the Points System,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m9tspb/suggestion_for_changes_to_the_points_system/,2025-07-26, Discussion,"Hey everyone,

I'm a long time F1 fan, have been watching the sport as my main interest since the 1996 season. Before this, I watched the odd race when my dad had it on, but I was just too young to appreciate it.

We've gone through a number of format revisions and points systems in my time watching the sport and, whilst I thought the 10-6-4-3-2-1 system that ran from 1991 to 2002 worked well in making points feel like a big deal, being so few points paying positions, it also meant that most drivers were racing for no reward most weekends.

  
The 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 system that came in at the start of 2003 was an attempt to stop one dominant driver running away with the championship and winning it extra early, which is what happened the previous season when Michael Schumacher picked up his fifth world title with still a third of the season left to go. It also added two more points paying positions at the same not increasing the points for winning the race. Personally I did not like this system, for me winning a race should have more weight in terms of the championship. The difference between 1st and 2nd in this system in my opinion was too small, a 2nd and a 6th should not be worth more than a 1st, although it did achieve it's primary purpose of keeping championships close.

The biggest change to points scoring since, at least the 1991 season in which finally all race results counted towards the championship, came in 2010, to what we have now. This took in to consideration modern day F1 reliability and a larger grid (3 new teams came for the 2010 season), whilst increasing the gap between 1st and 2nd place again. Whilst I like that there are more points paying positions than any other system we have ever had, I still don't think this is enough. Consider that we have a clear top 4 teams at the moment that monopolise the top 8 points in a clean race, all that needs to happen is Aston Martin to step back up to  make it a big 5 and the other teams won't have a look in. Therefore, I believe that the points system should be changed again and **all** drivers that finish a race within 2 laps of the winner should be rewarded with points, except last position.

The suggested points payout runs from the winner with the top 3 at 75-50-40, all the way down to 1 point for 21st place. This means the points tables will be a lot higher than what we have now, but they increased massively with the change in 2010 and other increase doesn't really change things in this regard. This system means that every driver has something to fight for, as long as the car/driver package is fast enough to stay close to the front-running pace. This prevents the situation we saw in 2010 when the three new teams were so ridiculously slow getting rewarded with points, it also prevents drivers/cars that DNF getting points, ever moreso putting extra importance on consistency. This means that, should only 15 drivers finish within 2 laps of the lead driver, points will only be paid down to 15th place. For example, in the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix won by Olivier Panis, with only 3 drivers finishing the race on the lead lap and one more a lap behind, these would be the only drivers to receive points that race.

I really do not see any negatives to the point system I suggested. As I mentioned, it will inflate the points tables, but they are already inflated anyway, but it puts extra importance on the race win with a large points difference between 1st and 2nd, with a massive points difference between 1st and, say 11th and below. This still means that, despite having points to fight for in the lower positions, compared to what the front runners are going to get it is still night and day difference. Sure, I would be open to suggestions for the actual points payouts but the biggest thing for me is that all drivers, within reason, have something to fight for whilst ensuring the importance of winning the race over 2nd place.

What do you think? Do you think the points system needs a revision, if so what do you think of my suggestion?","[""Personally, I like the Moto GP points system. First 15 get points, thus making sure each team gets points for the teams classification and it is a lower chance that a back marker team won't score in a season."", 'No, a driver finishing in like 18th place does not deserve points.\n\nAdditionally, the lower points you are introducing are way more about how many retirements there are, and not quality of performance. So actually you are introducing way more luck into the standings lower down.', 'Participation trophies for everyone.', ""I just think it's stupid that there's no points past P10. How are you supposed to compare drivers finishing 11th vs those finishing last?"", ""It's fine the way it is"", 'I‚Äôve always thought that every classified\xa0position should give points. The current system is too random for the slower teams, with a single 10th position being infinitely more valuable than consistently finishing 11th in terms of the standings. You see a similar problem when comparing points between teammates where single standout events skew the points drastically. A bonus for winning is good, but other than that I think the points system should be more proportional than it is today.\xa0', 'I liked the 90s system but I‚Äôm a weirdo.

1m9qke7,Carlos Sainz is the biggest what if of F1 in this generation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m9qke7/carlos_sainz_is_the_biggest_what_if_of_f1_in_this/,2025-07-26, Discussion,"

1. Started in Max's shadow at Toro Rosso  both were rookies, but Max got all the attention and eventually Red Bull‚Äôs full support.


2. Never got a proper Red Bull seat, even though many felt he was just as consistent and arguably more polished early on.


3. Moved around a lot  Renault, McLaren, Ferrari  but never got the top tier  machinery at the right time but helped McLaren to rebuilt itself.


4. 2022-23 Ferrari drama When the car had potential, team strategy and inconsistency held him back.


5. 2024: Dropped for Hamilton even after outperforming Leclerc in multiple races.

Now even tho james vowels gave many words of wisdom but hes doing same as the other team principles


His consistency, intelligence, and development skills should‚Äôve made him a title contender if he‚Äôd been given a clear No. 1 seat earlier in his career.","['No, he is just behind the absolute top.', 'In 2022, the team strategy literally fucked his faster teammate over just to have Sainz win.', 'He did manage to impress Ferrari enough to hire him, which is not a small feat by any means.\n\nWhen you break down all the ideal skills a driver should have, he has an excellent score in almost everything, but the overall mean average isnt on the level of other top tier drivers, his ceiling is not as high as theirs, but its very close', ""No, he isn't.  He is good enough to be a number 2 at a top team but not in the elite category."", 'No. He‚Äôs a good driver but he doesn‚Äôt have the crazy pace Norris, Leclerc or Russell have. He also doesn‚Äôt really have the racing IQ someone like Alonso, Hamilton, Verstappen show in changing conditions and definitely nothing close to their consistency . He never had the pace Vettel showed in any generation of regs so far.\n\nDanny Ric is the only what if in F1 in recent times imo', '1. he started in Max\'s shadow because Max was a better prospect with better results. that\'s why they chose Max for that Toro Rosso seat over him despite Sainz being older, way more experienced and in him being in RBR junior program for 5 years at that point. \n\nhe had all the opportunities to beat Max and get out of his shadow but never managed to despite, once again, being older and way more experienced.\n\n2.  red bull promotes the best. Carlos simply wasn\'t that. \n\n""just as consistent and arguably more polished early on"" (which is only just your opinion btw) with 5 times more experience than Max and still worse results by the end of their time as teammates. why on earth would he be promoted over Max.\n\n3. fair but also he moved to a better team every time. it\'s not like he downgraded in any of these moves. only one so far is Williams.\n\n4. now that\'s just bs cmon now. \n\n5. and Leclerc outperformed him in more races. Hamilton is also Hamilton.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSainz is a good driver but definitely isn\'t biggest what if.', 'Sainz I think deserves to be in a top team, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a what if. We saw what he did when the Ferrari was the fastest in 2022. Across his run in Ferrari, maybe contrary to popular opinion but I think he showed he‚Äôs a very strong qualifier, but he seemed to lack in race pace compared to leclerc in these regs.', ""IMO Albon, Gasly or Hulkenberg would have done a similar job at Ferrari. Leclerc's diabolical luck makes his record look much closer than it actually was."", 'His a great midfield driver. But there are 7 - 8 faster drivers than him.\xa0', '""more polished"" doesn\'t get you a drive, he got outscored by like what, almost double his points by a driver who was in his second year out of karts as opposed to Sainz\'s half a decade open wheelers experience. You are never coming back from a point difference that big, even if you ignore the extraordinary circumstances of Verstappen that made it more brutal.']",0,76,0.26,0,69,69,0,1,0.0,0
