Horner wanted Checo to work out or Daniel as Plan B. After things didn't work out and after Yuki had some rough/unlucky races in Austin/Mexico it went to Liam. Also Horner was not big on Yuki in general for ages probably because of the Honda pull out drama\n\nIf we really want to believe they are objective and stuff, Liam was pretty impressive in 2023 standing in for Daniel without a lot of notice especially coming from strong adaptability in SF/DTM.

Some big names with great primes that come to mind for me are Ricciardo and Massa. Granted, I haven't been watching as far back as their primes so I wouldn't know, but it truly feels like we have another uncrowned Champion in the making. 

Charles might have had mistakes earlier in his career but it really feels like he ironed them out last season and performs every race week. It's only early in his career but its possible we'll never see him lift the WDC Trophy despite being apparently more deserving than other names like Russel, Norris, or Piastri.

He said 100%. Reasonable question, reasonable answer.
