It's also McLaren's first time winning it (and the first time a team other than Ferrari, Red Bull or Mercedes has won it since its introduction in 2007). 
 
**How did Norris win?**

Going into the race, Norris was leading the contest with 5 fastest laps (FL) to his name, followed by Verstappen and Leclerc tied in second place with 3 FLs each. Leclerc was already out of contention because of tiebreakers (second most fastest laps, then third most fastest laps if needed and so on). With Norris setting the FL in Lusail, it's now mathematically impossible for Verstappen to match Norris' tally and hope to win on countback.

**Previous Fastest Lap Award Winners**

- 2023: Max Verstappen 
- 2022: Max Verstappen
- 2021: Lewis Hamilton
- 2020: Lewis Hamilton
- 2019: Lewis Hamilton 
- 2018: Valtteri Bottas
- 2017: Lewis Hamilton
- 2016: Nico Rosberg
- 2015: Lewis Hamilton
- 2014: Lewis Hamilton
- 2013: Sebastian Vettel
- 2012: Sebastian Vettel
- 2011: Mark Webber
- 2010: Fernando Alonso
- 2009: Sebastian Vettel
- 2008: Kimi Räikkönen
- 2007: Kimi Räikkönen

**Random facts and stats about the Fastest Lap Award**

- The FLA was won on countback 4 times: Räikkönen over Massa in 2007, Vettel over Webber in 2009, Alonso over Hamilton in 2010 and Hamilton over Verstappen in 2021.

- 2010 was the only season in which the team with the most fastest laps didn't win the FLA (Alonso won it on countback over Hamilton, but McLaren had 6 fastest laps in total to Ferrari's 5). 

- Mercedes holds the records for most FLA wins (8), most consecutive FLA wins (8) and most consecutive fastest laps in a single season (7, set in 2014 between the British GP and the Japanese GP).

- 88% of the teams fielding the FLA winner have also won the Constructors' Championship the same season (exceptions being Brawn in 2009 and Red Bull in 2010). 

- 61% of the drivers who have won the FLA also won the Drivers' Championship the same season (exception being 2008, 2009,2010,2011,2018,2021 and 2024). 

- In 2008, Kimi Räikkönen and Ferrari set the following FLA records:

-Most fastest laps by a driver in a single season (10)

-Highest % of fastest laps by a driver in a single season (55%, 10/18 races)

-Most consecutive races with the fastest lap by a single driver (6) 

-Most fastest laps by a team in single season (13)

-Highest % of fastest laps by a team in a single season (72%,13/18 races)
