There's a maximum of 43 points available each weekend (25 for the fastest stop, 18 for the second fastest stop), which means that McLaren can only earn 4x43=172 points at most, which isn't enough to close the 204-point gap, even if Ferrari failed to score a single point at the next four races.

1ohw2ct,Turn 1 lap 6 incident.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohw2ct/turn_1_lap_6_incident/,2025-10-28, Discussion,"I’m hopeful that since a full day has passed from the race, that we can have a more reasonable discussion about this incident.

On the “Driving Standards Guideline section A. ii)” it states the following:

“Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex, and not have “dived in”

Here is the link for that: https://static.fanpage.it/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/06/f1_driving_standards_guidelines_version_4.1_feb_20_2025.pdf

On Max’s onboard, we can see that Max hits the inside red sausage kerb located on the apex of the corner with his front right tire. This kerb is further inside the track of the normal red and white curb and it’s also much more pronounced. 

As a result of that impact Max loses control of the car and has to take corrective steering action. As he is sawing at the wheel, his front left makes contact with Lewis’s front right. 

How is this not in violation of the quoted section of the guidelines? 

If it is not a violation of the guideline, then it implies that as long as the car on the inside is first to apex, they cannot be deemed at fault for any incident. Further implying that any car attempting to defend their position on the outside of a corner, should concede immediately. The steward’s incident report pretty much confirmed this as they investigated Lewis for this contact and not Max. 

While I understand that the drivers voted for this, I simply don’t agree with it and it think it makes the racing product dull. 

I would much rather have something similar to what Indy car does. 

1) The defending car must be proactive and choose its line of defense. 

2) The attacking car is then responsible for carrying out a clean overtake. 

Sections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 of the Indycar rulebook can be found here: https://epaddock.indycar.com/docs/default-source/rules-regulations-and-policies/indycar-rulebook.pdf

Their rules are significantly more clear and I feel that they allow for far more exciting racing than what we currently have in F1. They are also more in line with what is the norm in other series and what is taught in most racing schools and lower level of competition.

I think it’s also time for F1 to have paid, professional and permanent stewards. Not only for consistency but more importantly, precedent. The best drivers on the grid, like Max, tend to push the line of what is acceptable in the rules and those rulings define how all drivers behave after. This leads to a degradation of driving standards over time and we continue to find ourselves in situations where we are changing the rules over and over. I feel like this is not too much to ask of a sport with a valuation in the 10+ billion dollar range. 
","['Verstappen could have been at fault if the speed he took would have meant that he was not staying on track which would have made his passing attempt invalid. The reality is that Verstappen was ahead by the apex and stopped on track but Hamilton turned into the apex when he no longer had the right of way which meant that they had a slight collision.\n\nAccording to the rules Hamilton should have taken a wider racing line and given the corner to Verstappen. It is pretty clear and the drivers have agreed to the rules.', '> I simply don’t agree with it and it think it makes the racing product dull.\n\nSo you find races with only DRS passes more exciting?', 'Don’t worry guys, OP doesn’t like how the rules work and is getting to the bottom of this.', ""The main issue was that Hamilton was caught off guard with the attempt, which didn't allow him to change his approach to the corner. He could have gone defensive and fully blocked the inside line at the cost of some lap time. He could have anticipated the dive with a wide line and more speed into the corner, taking the advantage in the next corner. As he didn't see the overtake coming, he took the normal racing line, but was already overtaken on the inside of turn 1. That caused him to be at a disadvantage in the next corner as it was on him to provide space for the leading driver.\n\nUltimately, both drivers lost out in the whole sequence. Hamilton would have lost much less if he let Verstappen pass after cutting t4 and t5."", ""OP, I only know that you are not allowed to overtake outside the track.  \napart from that....racing guidlines are terrible, and its application even worse.  \ncurrently you don't need to leave a space at all if you are ahead of apex and that is very dangerous and stupid. you can push out other car out of the track without consequences if you are ahead of apex."", ""IndyCar doesn't always have clean overtakes though if you've seen an IndyCar race that is not on an oval. There's a lot of argy bargy. As for the contact, that's just racing, Lewis did this far more egregiously in his younger years. No one complained. This is also far more prevalent in lower series like Karting. As the stewards stated if they were being consistent with other results in the past, this shouldn't deserve a pen.\n\n>it implies that as long as the car on the inside is first to apex, they cannot be deemed at fault for any incident\n\nYou'll come to learn that stewarding isn't fully based off the actions itself but the outcome.

The reason Checo didn't get a pen in Abu Dabi 21 and Lewis didn't in Abu Dabi 2016 for driving unreasonably slowly, Lewis didn't crash into him and Nico didn't crash into Lewis Mitigating circumstances. I wouldn't give a car a 10 second penalty just for a slight correction which lead to contact.

1ohbs3l,My train of thought after rewatching lap 6,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohbs3l/my_train_of_thought_after_rewatching_lap_6/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"- Lap 6 T1: Max tries to make a move on Lewis, it's hard racing, but it's a fair move. Lewis manages to keep alongside, they will take the battle to T2
- Lap 6 T2: Max, yet to complete the move on Lewis, goes wide and completes the move off track, cutting T3 in the process. Lewis stays within the track and lines up a move for T4.
- Lap 6 T4: Lewis tries to make the move around the outside on Max, goes off and completes the move off track. He then rejoins and doesn't give back the position.

Logical outcome in my opinion: both drivers get a 10 second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage.

Actual outcome: only Lewis gets a penalty...

Am I missing something or is this just bad stewarding?","['https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/Yn4g0c4q4B', ""Read the decision documents.\n\nThey say that, under the current rules, since Max is clearly (their word) ahead at the apex (i.e. having their front axle ahead of the other car's mirrors while overtaking on the inside), then Lewis should have yielded the corner. It was a legal overtake. The reason you say that the overtake wasn't completed, is because Lewis, incorrectly, failed to yield. Under the rules, it was completed. \n\nSo at the next corner, Lewis is attempting an overtake and pushes Max off track. Had Max not rejoined ahead, then it would have been a penalty for Lewis. Actually this corner might be considered still part of the previous corner, and since Max was ahead at the first apex, he was entitled to this corner as well.\n\nThen Lewis makes a mistake while attempting another overtake on Max. He gains the place and doesn't give it back. It's a clear penalty. Doesn't matter what occurred behind with Russell and Bearman. \n\nUnder the current rules (which I don't think are right by the way), it was correct that Lewis got the penalty and Max didn't get any. \n\nI think this has always been the problem between Lewis and Max going back to 2021. They seem to be driving under different racing rules/guidelines. What Max does is legal under the current rules, while Lewis drives as if it isn't."", ""T2: Max was at the apex first and was entitled to be given enough space.

People are saying that Max didn\'t give the place back, but you cannot give a place back that you don\'t have. And while the rules are sometimes poorly written, they aren\'t so poorly written that they require drivers to do logically impossible things.\n\nIt really feels like people just understand the rules poorly and think that any gaining of a position while off track immediately yields a penalty, regardless of what happens after. That is not the case, and has never been the case. Drivers are always given a while (not sure if there\'s an exact time limit, but it\'s at least a lap or so) to give a place back. You often see drivers refusing to give a place back until their team tells them they should. That too is normal and allowed.', 'Hamilton move in T2 was illegal, as he was outside of the track.

You can see that he  is 100% on the break right before the 150m board which is the standard breaking point during the race (120-130 in quali). He also stays 100% on the break for as long as possible, i.e. until his front left locks at which point he has to start trying to make the turn and release the breaks.\n\n\n\nWhat screwed him was that when he got squeezed by Leclerc he rode the curb which made his tires lose contact and grip making it impossible to make the turn. While I wouldn't put it past Max to do something like this intentionally, I can't imagine this beaing the actual plan as it was way too close to comfort. If anything, he probably wanted to do what Leclerc did, since in a situation of 3 wide he could easily make the argument that he was pushed out and couldn't make the corner.""]",0,23,0.26,0,19,19,0,23,0.26,0
