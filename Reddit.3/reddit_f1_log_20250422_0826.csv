For me there are two I'd bring in immediately.

1. IndyCar's offset timing line in qualifying. Without the need for full in/out laps, teams would be able to get more laps in during quali at tracks like Spa, and at tracks like Monza where traffic is an issue, there could potentially be fewer cars on track.

2. MotoGP's Long Lap penalty. Take Max's penalty at Jeddah for example. If rather than waiting until his stop to serve a 5 second penalty, why not make him take a long lap within 3 laps? It would have likely put him back behind Piastri and maybe we'd have seen a fight for the lead? It would also be fairer on drivers who get a 5 second penalty after their last stop only for the race to end behind the safety car.

What other rules are out there that you'd like to see in F1?","['Repair your own car.', ""Lap time deletion for causing yellow/red flags in qualifying.\n\nLLPs are good on paper but MotoGP's had a bit of controversy because it's a FAR bigger penalty on some tracks than others, and it's harder to implement on four wheels.

Like last weekend, Verstappen could have just skipped the whole braking what so ever, and took a long lap with and stayed first. \n\nPlus, the current rule, just give back the advantage or place and you‚Äôre off the hook works well.

Is he out of his prime? Yes, simply because prime Alonso is one of the greatest drivers of all time and he makes a few more mistakes now than he used to. However I keep seeing people omitting him from what they consider the top 5 or 7 on the grid. 

What I don't understand is his gap to Stroll has  remained the same throughout his years together with him and 2023 he was generally considered 2nd or 3rd best that year. If you look at his pace gaps, he has actually got even bigger gaps to Stroll now than he did for large parts of 2023. I just don't understand why people think that now he is in the 2nd slowest car, he is suddenly washed. The 2 races Stroll genuinely had more pace than him in 24? Stroll getting 10 points and Alonso 0 because of 2 DNFs this year? (one was a a crash yes but he was well ahead of Stroll on pace regardless) 

Some of this is probably projecting the problems of other drivers like Hamilton (although I don't think Hamilton is washed per se, moreso his driving style doesn't suit these regulations as well) but his race head to head is absolutely dominant and drivers like Max still praise his driving and he has been the leading Aston driver for every one of his racing laps this year. 

","['Because the unsatisfying truth is we really don\'t have a good way of telling if one driver is ""better"" and even then, there are multiple areas of driver skill (inside the race AND outside the race) that different teams will weigh differently such that its frankly impossible to quantify outside of talents that are so obviously better than their peers it becomes undeniable.', 'Well only way we\'d be able to compare drivers was if drivers were driving different car each week or if they all had the same car. As it is, it\'s impossible to judge drivers, and car, apart from maybe teammates. And even then it might be just that car suits one teammate better, other one might be better if they raced in a different car.\n\nHowever, one thing we can say is that there were no ""lucky"" world champions, at least not recently. Whoever managed to be #1 is a great driver and has earned it. Alonso and Hamilton might not be in their prime, but their skill is not really disputable. They have both earned their reputation. If Lawson bins car everybody will be ""he\'s a bad driver"", but if Hamilton or Alonso do it, ""must have been a bad car"".\n\nBut comparing drivers is a folly, who are we to say ""Albon is better than Hulkenberg.""

1k4hewo,Is McLaren 2025 Really Dominant or Just Consistently Good?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k4hewo/is_mclaren_2025_really_dominant_or_just/,2025-04-21, Discussion,"During this season, McLaren has undoubtedly shown impressive long-run pace, especially in the last three race weekends. Their FP1 and FP2 race pace simulations looked incredibly strong ‚Äî often outpacing rivals by 3 to 6 tenths over race distance runs. On paper, that should translate to dominance... but when it comes to actual Qualifying and Race Day performance, the story seems different.

We‚Äôve seen in the past how Max and Lewis used to win races with 20+ second margins. With the hype surrounding McLaren this season, I expected something similar. But that hasn‚Äôt really been the case. In fact, it feels like the opposite.

Yes, their car struggles in dirty air ‚Äî we‚Äôve all noticed how poor it is at following other cars. But even in clean air during Quali (FP3, Q2, Q3), their single-lap pace hasn‚Äôt looked unbeatable. George Russell, for example, is often right there with them in terms of one-lap performance.

So, is McLaren truly dominant this season, or are we just caught up in the hype? They might be the fastest team overall, but they don‚Äôt seem to have the kind of crushing dominance we saw from Red Bull or Mercedes in their prime.

Is it fair to think this way, or am I just expecting too much?","['The sport went from having the Mercedes-Hamilton combination to the Red Bull-Verstappen combination. There\'s people that genuinely don\'t know that you can have the best car but not ve dominant. I\'m in that category, I started following around 2019 but I\'ve looked at past season and tried to learn about the ""old times"". \n\nRn, there\'s almost a need for a team to be dominant. If you are not a generational talent then most of your achievements are down to the car per some people online. The question is how much do you care about a random person\'s opinion. I think most people that are involved in F1 rn agree that McLaren is undoubtedly the best car but they don\'t have the gap that Mercedes had or RB had in years past.', 'The McLaren advantage is most likely expected to show in hot races, according to Zak in the post race F1TV interview after Jeddah. Which supports why we saw such glaring differences in pace for FO3 Bahrain and Jeddah. \n\nI think the best of McLaren is yet to come. I am currently hoping RBRs Miami upgrade levels the playing field', ""Pretty much what you said, the McLaren is the consistently best car, generally has the best tyre wear and pace.\n\nVerstappen, for example, has to be perfect in somewhere like Suzuka, or this weekend in SA to beat them - but it's clearly been possible.\n\nI do also think Norris' struggles in the car are making it look a bit less dominant than it is. Since he has generally been the faster driver between himself and Piastri, if he was comfortable in the car, they could have ended up with more 1-2s etc."", 'They‚Äôre obviously dominant currently, but not enough to make up for major driver error - unlike the RB19 for example.\n\nThat is why they‚Äôre leading the WCC and the WDC and have won 4 out of 5 races despite arguably not the best drivers of the top teams.', '""They\'re going to be good everywhere"" got confused for ""they\'re going to be dominant"".\n\nBy years end I think Lando and Oscar are 1-2 and by a good margin, however each circuit will still present it\'s own challenges and as we\'ve seen already, Max, George, and the Ferraris on their best days can battle with or be better. It\'s just going to likely rotate a bit through those three while McLaren is always there. Through 5 races this is tougher to see but I think by the mid-way point it will start to become apparent.', ""Hot weather most likely dominant, others it's consistently the best. Piastri being in his third season and Norris having a bad run is just overshadowing it. But it's no Max & RB19 dominance; but Checo wouldn't have been as dominant in that RB19 so it might be comparable."", ""It's always hard to tell, a not insignificantly element of the performance is the driver.\n\nBoth Oscar and Lando are very good but neither of them Max level. \n\nI'd say it's comfortably the best car and that the only reason it looks uncomfortable at times is because other drivers are out performing Lando and Oscar in their respective cars."", ""It's the clear fastest car but not dominant in any sense imho. I fully discount practice as a datapoint because Red Bull has clearly run lower engine modes since 21 at least and recently also tries experimental setups before (more often than not) getting it all together by Qualifying. The McLaren's main advantage is its wide setup window which lets them hit the ground running anywhere and its ability to look after the rears which only really helps in places with high deg like Bahrain and China. That isn't a guaranteed edge every weekend which is why you see can Red Bull nail their narrow setup window and be on the pace or a close battle at a low deg track like Suzuka or Jeddah that negates the McLaren's tire advantage. In terms of peak car performance when everything is dialed in, the RB21 is close enough that Max can make up the difference."", ""It's a strong car but Red Bull also have a strong car and they have the best driver in the world. At the top level, drivers like Verstappen can make a huge difference. Max is on a different level than both Piastri and Norris. He's extremely fast and consistent, rarely making mistakes.\n\nWithout Max, you would argue that McLaren should have the WDC in the bag, but with Max the task becomes a lot tougher. If development goes wrong for McLaren and they lose a bit of ground against Red Bull, they could definitely find themselves in trouble.""]",0,60,0.37,0,328,328,0,4,0.020000000000000018,0

He pointed out that the car is less predictable now but he likes it that way. Lewis also said that the car fits Leclerc's overseer-heavy driving style really well. 

Now that makes me wonder, how would Sainz handle the SF-25? The car's balance seems to be pretty similar to the early-form F1-75, a car that Sainz had difficulties extracting performance from. Personally I think Sainz would struggle in similar way to how he did in 2022, maybe to a slightly lesser extent.

Carlos' first year with Ferrari was very similar to where Hamilton is - a mixture of P5-P8 etc, with Charles ending up P4-P7 alot, which is a current trend so far this year. \n\nSo, I would guess - probably about the same?"", 'He would do better than Hamilton, but be slightly behind Leclerc, as he always was', 'I actually do think the gap would be bigger than the average gap between Charles and Carlos but yes, less than the one with Lewis.\n\nThe SF-25 is slow, that‚Äôs the big issue, but Charles actually seems to love to drive it. The pace isn‚Äôt there but he‚Äôs very comfortable in the set up and driving it and has found a way to extract everything out of it.\n\nEvery-time Charles is comfortable in the car, the gap between him and Carlos grew. Considering Charles usually can comfortably out-qualify Carlos in Bahrain and Saudi, my guess is the qualifying gap in Bahrain would‚Äôve been around two tenths but bigger again in Saudi     \n\nAnd then I think Charles would have the clear advantage in race pace, I think that‚Äôs where he actually had more of an advantage over Carlos.\n\nOn tracks Charles likes, when he‚Äôs comfortable with the car and not making small mistakes in qualifying, it‚Äôs very unlikely Carlos would be a real threat to him. Yeah he might be doing a bit better than Lewis but I still don‚Äôt think Ferrari have any reason to regret their decision.\n\nTheir fastest driver is still their fastest driver so they haven‚Äôt lost any footing in the drivers championship. Might hurt their WCC but any money they lose by a place lost in that they gain by the profitability of Lewis Hamilton on their team. \n\nFerrari have also had the same two drivers since 2021. It‚Äôs good to get a fresh perspective on the car from a different driver. No, not developing the car in Lewis‚Äôs direction but input from drivers is necessary to make it faster. \n\nCharles and Carlos were incredibly competitive which meant they learned a lot from each other, and to have new teammates means they now have different drivers to learn different strengths, like tracks that neither Charles or Carlos were particularly strong at.', ""On average in qualifying Hamilton is actually slightly closer to Leclerc than Sainz was beginning of 2021 when he joined Ferrari.
