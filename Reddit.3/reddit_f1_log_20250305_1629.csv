Even Mclaren and Red Bull had issues, with Mclaren having issues with their rear end too.', ""\nTranslation\n\n\nThe countdown has begun, in less than two weeks Ferrari's world championship will begin in Australia.\n\nThe new Rossa has not unveiled its cards clearly, no one really knows what to expect in terms of the fight against McLaren. Leclerc has already been burned and was extremely cautious in his predictions, Hamilton did not complete his final race simulation.  At the conclusion of the three-day test in Bahrain, it would be wrong to say that the SF-25 has completely convinced spectators and insiders.\n\nPut on the track, the new car showed a base with potential but yet to be fully settled. In Maranello there is talk of settings “to be calibrated.” Beyond the pure performance, of which any judgment is postponed until March 16, Bahrain therefore left with it some perplexities about the SF-25's firepower.\n\n\n“Before I go out on a limb about whether the car is fast, I would prefer to wait“-the words of an always very eloquent Charles Leclerc in externalizing his feeling for the prancing horse's single-seater-”It will only be seen in Melbourne where we are at, when we will have everything in the best condition to try to extract the best from the car. At the tests we struggled a bit more in the balance.” Red Bull is a bit disappointed with its own testing and sees Ferrari as the closest force to McLaren, a sign -- according to its French technical director -- that the SF-25 still played hide-and-seek a bit more than the others. The constructors' title holders took a risk with the MCL39 design to try to make the world championship boring, however they say “we don't trust Ferrari at all”\n\n\n\nNo anomaly from Bahrain: Reports analyzed in Maranello showed no lack of correlation\n\nThe engineers are devoting themselves to analyzing the data produced during the work of the three-day Sakhir test session. At no time did the program carried out in Bahrain have the goal of seeking true performance, except for small, focused flashes. The tendency not to uncover all one's cards in terms of pure performance is confirmed by the data and a work program focused on getting to know the car from the aspect of the behavior of the new mechanical platform, and how it reacts to changes in setup and tire management. The car showed itself as it was to be expected, with a “more powerful” front end even if still to be optimized due to an overturned pull-rod suspension that requires more knowledge at the mechanical level. This aspect, moreover, also affected the braking behavior, which more or less indirectly, changes.\n\nHowever, Ferrari came out of Bahrain with certain questions, and it will be necessary to see the car further on the track to draw more definitive conclusions. Problems that one might venture to call “youthful,” of which the team prefers to approach with caution for now. Analyses of the aerodynamic data, which arrived from the Bahrain reports, show no lack of correlation, however, and from the information in AutoRacer's possession nothing anomalous was found with the work done in the winter in the tunnel. An analysis if you will, that confirms the statements of Team Principal Vassuer right in Bahain: “The numbers we detected are the same as we expected.”\n\nHamilton and Leclerc engaged in three days of simulator testing to arrive with fewer unknowns in Australia. The rear end was limited by a mechanical setup yet to be centered.\n\n\nHamilton and Leclerc provided two sides of the same coin. The SF-25 “is not slow,” but it still needs to be put on the right tracks, that was the first verdict that came from Sakhir.  The rear that does not follow the front is a problem that for now in Maranello they are addressing solely on the mechanical front. The Italian single-seater was born having undergone a major axle re-destruction work, passed through the shortening of the gearbox. This was a non-trivial work aimed at widening the setup and having the weight placement shifted more forward. It is clear that such a radical change by necessity was going to shift the balance and references that the engineers of the cavallino had the previous year.\n\n\n\nBahrain in testing also offered a far from ideal track, unrepresentative especially for what we will then see on the official weekend when F1 will stop there at the third round of the season: “It is quite unlikely that similar weather will be found when the F1 world championship stops here again.”\n\n\nLeclerc and Hamilton are currently in Maranello for work on the simulator that will last for three days and marked by a program aimed at taking stock of the situation ahead of Australia.The two Ferrari drivers will have a rather busy week since in addition to the work in the factory, they will be joined by 'extra-track' work. Last night Leclerc and Hamilton's presence, together with Vasseur, at the PUMA event and tomorrow the presentation in the team square where, for the occasion, as we told you, the two drivers will also take to the track with two 'dated' Formula 1 cars, which should be the SF90 and the SF-21.\n\n\n\nThe SF-25 in fact we will see in two weeks at a track quite different from Bahrain, less limiting on the rear with the 2022 layout changes, which on the one hand may meet the redhead's needs in this first taste of the season. The focus will be to put the rear in the window without weakening the front, at a track that will also offer technical cues under the aspect of tires and possible front graining. The aerodynamic set-up, moreover, will see no upheaval; the new-generation rear wing with its more prominent spoon is firmly at the center of a macro-configuration that will see it often employed on medium-load tracks.\n\n\nLevels of vertical thrust at the rear end will be mostly set by the use of beam wings that are more or less wide and dependent above all on the grip that the semi-permanent Albert Park track will offer. McLaren has seen itself strong and starts as the big favorite in this start of the season, at the same time in Maranello the first three races will serve as a benchmark to definitively direct the development of the platform:“ we have opened a new door for development”-as Vasseur himself had made clear during testing. Will it be enough?"", ""If i compare hamiltons onboards from last year to this year in bahrain, i can clearly see that the ferrari looks way more planted compared to last year's merc.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.
