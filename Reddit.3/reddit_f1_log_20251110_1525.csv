I'm just giving my opinion on ‘Do I think it's going to be as easy?’ I won last weekend by 30 seconds, very, very easy. I won today by pushing a lot more, only 10 seconds, and Max was probably the quickest out on track today.

Do I think that at a track that we've never been good at, we were very good here two years ago, we almost challenged Max for the win, we've never been good in Vegas. So why am I going to think, ‘Yeah, it's going to be fine, whatever?’ I'm giving my opinion, I'm giving my honest opinion on how I think we're going to be. We've never been good there, so I'm not the most confident about going into this race.

Maybe I'll win, then we'll see. But I'm not going to lie and say ‘Yeah, I'm very confident and I think it's going to be an easy weekend’ because I don't think that's how it's going to be.

This year hasn't been great, but it's not the absolute worst season of Ferrari. They had worse ones. For example, 2020, when they had the worst result since 40 years. They had worse one in 2014, when alonso had to drive the most unstable car in f1 that had unique ability to understeer and oversteer at the same time. 

I just watched brazilian GP after another double DNF, but it's not like Ferrari is fighting for anything. Their real last chance is gonna be in Las Vegas. 

But there have definitely been a lot more painful moments for Ferrari team than today's race or double dsq in China. 

Like the image from Singapore 2017 or Vettel's crash in Germany 2018 or Leclerc's engine failures in 2022 alongside his crash in France that destroyed his chances for title.

1oss62o,The Brazil GP's logistical issues to locals in capitol São Paulo - as seen by a local,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss62o/the_brazil_gps_logistical_issues_to_locals_in/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"So as we all know, we just finished up the Brazilian GP at Interlagos. I have no idea as to if this is against the rules or not (as this is more of a rant instead of a technical writeup), but I'd assume it does due to this being a writeup about how the Brazilian GP is like to the locals - as whiny as it might sound like.

For some ungodly reason, [ENEM (acronym translates to National High School Exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_M%C3%A9dio), basically an SAT-type exam with 90 + 90 questions and an essay over two Sundays that students take in order to either get into federal/public college, or get a scholarship/free ride into private college) also takes place this Sunday and the next. An issue that has been true since the Brawn GP days [(there's literally a news article from 2010 about students from Zona Sul (the region near Interlagos) having a hard time getting to the exams due to the increased traffic from F1)](https://g1.globo.com/educacao/noticia/2010/11/formula-1-prejudica-estudantes-do-enem-na-zona-sul-de-sp.html)
For very obvious reasons, traffic jams are extremely common near the school/college buildings the exam takes place at all over the country, and due to São Paulo being a gigantic city this issue compounds even further there. If the roads and the subway system are already crowded enough in a regular day, then it gets absolutely bizarre during F1 week, even more so with ENEM and this is compounded even further when we factor in other events/shows that normally take place nearby (like the Morumbis stadium or Allianz Parque).

However, ENEM can't take place in January because that'd be too close a deadline for the grades to be up and ready to be released by February (when colleges and universities start taking new students), and by December all schools/colleges are on summer break, which leaves us with November. Specifically, the one Sunday in where the F1 circus shows up with almost 300k fans in tow (because logistical issues regarding the calendar and weather mean the Brazil GP has to happen in early November). Not even considering other events like Linkin Park's show because those are far and between, only ENEM that takes place literally every year since 1998.

Of course foreigners can take a plane to São Paulo and back (as such only dealing with the local and foreigner traffic inside the city), but locals will most likely be going to the GP by car, which means dealing with both F1 and Linkin Park traffic.

Seriously... this has been an issue for almost 20 years, it would've been way more manageable both for the locals driving to their jobs, the locals taking ENEM, the foreigners and the locals going to the GP if both events didn't take place in the exact same weekend. Specially because the city of São Paulo are the ones funding the GP, meaning they absolutely have incentive to make sure the dates don't clash.","[""An exam taking place on Sunday, especially in a Christian country, is wild to me.\n\nSaturday it's ok, but placing a school event on Sunday in Italy would mean riot as here it's meant as a no school day."", 'As much as I love to watch the race, having high school students suffer with traffic etc to get to their exams is painful to see.

Thanks!","['According to the rules, should Oscar have received a penalty? Yes\n\nDo those specific rules suck? Also yes\n\nThose rules are diminishing racing and almost making racing incidents obsolete.', ""Lando is getting a lot of well-deserved credit for his run of form, but I want to specifically point out the improvements he's made on his starts from pole. He's now converted every single standing start from pole position (7) to victory in the last 365 days and has done so without losing the lead at the start for any of them, something that seemed unthinkable for him last season: Abu Dhabi, Australia, Monaco, Austria, Mexico, and Brazil (gp and sprint). The one pole he has failed to convert to victory in the last year was Spa, which had a rolling start.\n\n*(Yes, he made a mistake in turn 1 and Oscar capitalized, but considering the unique circumstances \\[rolling start, wet\\] and the factors working against him \\[pole being notoriously difficult to hold onto at Spa, plus whatever role his battery issues played\\], I don't think it's unreasonable to look at that one as an outlier and not fully representative for his current form).*\n\nHis starts and SC restarts were perfect this weekend including in the damp conditions of the sprint, and last race out in Mexico he held onto pole at a track where leading into turn 1 from pole is notoriously difficult. His starts are still not perfect and he has plenty of room for improvement, as we've seen this season in races where he's starting P2/P3 etc, but it's clear he's absolutely worked on this achilles heel that plagued him for much of last season and it's nice as a fan to see the tangible improvements he's made and the results that come with it. I think the same could be said for Oscar, as much as his current slump is the topic right now, it's clear he knew qualifying was a weakness of his last year and took huge strides to improve going into this year, and it paid off for him for much of the season."", ""Great race. Maybe some thought needs to be put on the type of tarmac used in other tracks because seeing real tyre wear and 2 stoppers is such a game changer.\n\nThe only downside is that the title fight is starting to simmer down with these results, Lando found his groove in a massive way and it's gonna take a small miracle from Oscar or a MAJOR miracle from Max to stop him."", 'It honestly baffles me that if Oscar didn\'t break even harder when he saw Antonelli turning it, and would have instead kept going and therefore been first to the apex, absolutely punting Antonelli into Leclerc ruining 3 driver\'s cars, he\'d have probably been fine as he was ""ahead at the apex"".\n\nThe current rules, or at least the interpretation of them, is antithetical to good racing.\n\nOscar\'s move yesterday was a bold one that at worst should have gone down as a 5s each for him and Antonelli, because ultimately Antonelli had a full car width to his right so could have avoided it, or ideally just a racing incident. \n\nIt honestly makes me lose some interest in the sport, as it basically means the only way to pass is a pit strategy, a flyby from a much faster car, or a dirty dive bomb up the inside, we rarely get wheel-to-wheel racing.', 'A few thoughts about the race:\n\n* First off... the TV direction! Finally, they actually showed all the battles at the end instead of just zooming in on the winner. Loved the little split screens showing the other fights happening around the track.\n* McLaren Boys. Lando had an awesome race. You could tell he managed his tyres really well most of the way through. Shame Max started so far back, because we could’ve had a proper showdown. Lando’s clearly been working on his mindset this year, and it’s paying off. Perfect timing for him to hit form like this. Oscar’s still going through a rough patch, though. I might be wrong, but at this point it feels more likely that Max takes P2 in the championship than Oscar wins it. And yeah, McLaren’s strategy for him was a bit weird... they kept him out forever in the first stint only to go for a two-stop anyway.\n* Those final laps between Max and Kimi were amazing. Gotta give credit to the rookie, he held his own.\n* And Max… wow. P3 from the pit lane, in a dry race, no big Safety Cars or red flags and with a puncture? Unreal.\n\nInterlagos once again proving why it’s one of the best tracks on the calendar.', 'I have to keep reminding myself that rookies and younger drivers are more often than not going to be wildly inconsistent.  Kimi has taken a lot of flak this season, but performances like his at Interlagos proves that this kid is really going to be something in F1.', 'This was great TV direction. But also, on F1TV, you could literally hear when JP left the office, F1 without 2 or 3 commentators really does not feel natural.', ""Aston Martin had so much of potential after coming off the backs of a very promising sprint qualifying. Alonso fortunately managed his race well, even after conceding the position in a *(never seen ever)* tussle with Leclerc. Stroll had a decent one as well. But Christ, them going on the hards in the main race definitely killed some of the momentum that they have had. With Stroll, the contact with Tsunoda spells compromise on his end but I don't know what they were doing for Alonso here. It sucks to see them flip-flopping this way\n\nConversely, VCARB can leave Interlagos, feeling proud of the double points finish! Started the sprints relatively meh for both drivers with nothing egregious of note *(I think Lawson had an incident, or maybe my memory is playing games with me)* but their main qualifying and races were the highlights! Outqualifying the main outfit, optimal starting strategies, pace management, a bit of flip-flopping across the board but each of them managed to claw their way back into the fold, Lawson creating a DRS train *(ha!)* and giving them the room to race each other, and other drivers. Nothing but my kudos to them"", 'I must say I am aghast that for an organisation who prides themselves on excellent marketing and public relations with the media and the consumer, John Elkann\'s comments that were reported on Sky Italia is the **exact opposite** of what you should be saying to the press about Ferrari\'s performance\n\nNo, Elkann. In what world are your two high-profile drivers nursing LiCo issues every lap a vast improvement to the car? In what universe has this race been sufficient for your drivers to extract maximum potential out of this machinery that has set your trajectory back by a long mile since 2024? When your long-staying employee was taken out through no fault of his own during a race, and your decorated 7-time world champion has a car that is looking like it\'ll break under the weight of its grip and stability issues, how are they able to work with those? Funny that the comparison to the WEC team came about, because the latter *(that is under AF CORSE by the way)* actually had everyone working in sync to ensure maximum potential was extracted DESPITE the BoP issues plaguing them. It is the effort of both team and driver that got them there, not this *""we must stay united and i demand maximum results""* malarkey\n\nFrankly, it seems that everytime I talk about Ferrari\'s lows, I keep circling back to the same fundamental issue. When would it get to a point where Elkann, Vigna and the rest of the higher echelons will even realise that a lot of Ferrari\'s current stinkers is coming from *them* and their whacky integrated politics that barely gives any of their personnel a chance to move the needle forward?', ""I just rewatched the race, being able to relaxed and judge everything objectively and realised Lando really had a stellar weekend that is champion deserving.

After an interesting brazil grand prix, Norris who does Piastri and Piastri who does Norris... Verstappen who comes back from hell and rejects Norris' coronation. I felt it was the right moment to share something I've been working on for the past few months.

I'm thrilled to introduce [metrikdelta.com](http://metrikdelta.com) a comprehensive F1 data analysis platform that I've developed with one core mission: making high level telemetry and race analytics accessible to every F1 enthusiast and complete features for new fans.

The platform is free to use I believe F1 data should be accessible to the community that makes this sport so special. There's an optional premium tier (€4.99/month) for Studio Pro content creation tools, but all analysis features remain completely free.

The site is fully mobile-responsive but I recommend desktop experience, and covers all recent seasons. Data is sourced through FastF1, And Jolpica F1

This is a passion project, I would genuinely appreciate your feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism. What features would make this more useful for you? What analyses would you like to see? How can I improve the experience? I know the site is not perfect I have a lot to do but I will do my best

I hope metrikdelta can add value to your F1 experience.

Especially when you consider it only has to last 3 more races.\n\nHad he qualified better and used his existing PU, his race would have been very different.', 'Didnt you see how max was struggling in the final laps to overtake antonelli! Thats because his tyres were fcked! \n\nPushing means you break late basically in every corner, late breaking means hard breaking, which degrades the tyre!

And if it was clear car 1 was faster than cars 2 to 20 by a large amount, races would be supremely boring (hi 2023). While car perfomance can mean someone can lead from the front ala Mexico last week, sometimes like in Brazil these technical hurdles can lead to an interesting race.', ""Lots of things.\n\n* Tyres - main issue in modern F1 is tyres, in most races and on most cars if you push hard early you will damage the tyres for the whole stint, they have to be nursed. Max must have got the set up and feel perfect to be able to push his tyres as hard as he did for so much sustained periods\n* Temperatures - Pushing a car raises the temperatures of brakes, engines, tyres, batteries. F1 cars are not designed to be pushed flat out (particularly in hot dirty air) non stop. Pushing flat out will destroy a modern car\n* Dirty Air/Strategy - Pushing to sit as close behind the car in front if you can't pass is just going to destroy your car, if you can't pass quickly sometimes you are better off falling back, saving the tyres and pushing once they pit out of your way\n* Fuel - F1 cars are underfuelled when they start the race for weight benefits, this means drivers need to save fuel at times in the race to make it to the end, this is lessened by periods of safety car or VSC\n* Fatigue - it is hard to push flat out for 1.5 hours and mistakes are more likely as drivers get tired"", ""The harder you push, the faster the tires wear out, and you wind up losing places to poor grip or pit stops.  \n\nBeyond those immediate concerns, *everything* on the car is running right on the ragged edge of failure; power unit, gearbox, brakes, suspension, aero, etc.  The harder you push, the faster *very expensive* things wear out and need replacing.  You don't have unlimited spare parts, you don't have unlimited money, so you can't blast through every race at full bore from lights out to checkered flag.  \n\nHowever, there are only 3 grands prix and a sprint left in the season; preservation isn't that high a priority now.  Max took on a whole new PU and some other parts, so he could afford to push in a way others couldn't.  \n\nMax is also quite possibly the greatest driver in F1 history.  His driving is mechanically precise.  He knows exactly where the line is and how close he can get to it, and the car is more or less tuned to his particular driving style (witness Liam and Yuki's relative performances in the VCARB^1 vs. the Red Bull). \n\nIf anyone can push for 71 laps and not destroy the machinery under him, it's Max.  \n\n--------\n\n1.

I looked up his career and Ive revisited some seasons of the past and I've got some things to say about him. He started in 2000 and for the most part of his career, he drove pretty mid cars. This is from the time when the field was much spread out. He finally got a championship car in 2009 and he won the WDC, this thread is not to hail him to be on the levels of Verstappen or Hamilton or Prost. Anyway his quali performance dropped off a bit in late 09 but it doesn't matter though does it he dominated the first half, held on and sealed it in Brazil that year.

Next year and then until 2012 he had a great car with Mclaren and was paired with Hamilton who many consider to be top 3 of all time. While yes hamilton was better than him, Button did outscore him in their three years together with a comple hammering on Lewis in 2011. His wet driving was pristine, he has multiple iconic victories like Hungary 06, Canda 2011 or Brazil 012 on his name. And then after having fun for some time and no longer a GOAT teammate, just as he probably thought 2013 might be something, he was given a mid car to drive again and it got only worse with Mclaren. Another interesting fact is he also beat Alonso in 2015 in points. Anyway yeah as I said, my point is not to state he is one of the goats but he does not deserve this much slander online, comparing Norris/Piastri to be one of the worst WDCs ever and placing them with Jenson.

Why oh why don't any midfielders even atempt to take on a fight with the top drivers? In my vision they lose nothing, and may gain A LOT. This was shown in Mexico by Bearman, in Brasil by Kimi. Often they are more than capable of standing their ground and defend, or at least slow down the car behind. The legendary Alonso wall, where he was able to keep WDC behind him for the whole race. 

Now it just looks like they've been waved a blue flag, the second they see Max, Lando, Oscar or Charles in the mirror, they instantly move out the way, abandon racing line, don't even try to keep their position.

This in my opinion undermines today's Max achievement of reaching P3 from pitlane. I mean if only 6 of 19 cars is even atempting to race you, and 2 of them crash before you even warm your tires... In these conditions Logan Sergeant could have a shot at WDC. Basically every race this season feels like watching two races happening at the same time - McLaren vs Mercedes vs Leclerc vs Verstappen, and the other race is all of the other cars just getting out of the way of the ""big boys"".

And again, before MV fans tear me apart - I'm not saying his drive wasn't impressive (although Kimi's defence was even more impressive), but to he completly honest with you... If he doesn't need to race 90% of the cars, it's not THAT impressive. And we shouldn't talk about ""generational drive"" when 3 of the cars are out and the rest just lets you pass by. It's just catching up to the top and then starting to race for real. I mean if somebody starts from the pitlane, then 15 cars crash, your only opponents are Saubers and Alpines, and you are in the 3rd fastest car on the grid, you can easly achieve P1 and on paper be the best driver in history. But are you really?

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  
I'm giving MV as an EXAMPLE here, I'm not saying it's exclusive to him. I also didn't like how Lawson just jumped out the way from Piastri instead of even attempting to defend. MV's example is just the most apparent, since there's all this talk about ""generational drive"".

1otby45,Red Bull Should Keep Tsunoda For 2026,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otby45/red_bull_should_keep_tsunoda_for_2026/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"I hope they keep Tsunoda.

Yes, he finished dead last, but keep in mind that he had *two* penalties, the second of which was caused by the team.
 
Without those extra 20 seconds he would have finished P8, having started P19. That's pretty solid.

I know it's popular to bash whoever happens to be in the second RB seat, but it seems that Tsunoda is improving, and is working better with the team. I am not sure whether that is down to Mekies.

For next year, the rules change completely so everyone starts from zero.

Would it not be more beneficial to continue with a driver that is known to the team and that right now is talking and working with the same people who are designing and will be developing next season's car?

The other option is of course Hadjar. He has been an amazing rookie. But is he mature and experienced enough to help develop next year's Red Bull, especially when he has no established rapport with Red Bull engineers and, as a rising star, will be under tremendous pressure next to Max in a car that is expected to win?

As much as I like Yuki, I have to admit that it's a tough decision. Laurent Mekies has worked with both drivers, so I suppose that he already has an opinion on the matter, and a well-educated one at that.

Personally, I'd err on the side of caution and keep Yuki for '26, and let Hadjar mature in the lower pressure environment of the second team. ","['Why do you exclude the 10s Yuki caused himself from the timings? Surely you’d only exclude the penalty the team caused?', 'I get your argument but he just hasn’t performed at all, P17 in the standings is shameful for a Red Bull driver', ""the general ask for RBR second driver is that he should be useful for the WDC. Checo in Qatar sprint last year was literally a testing mule for Verstappen. Their car was awful that sprint but with his sprint they were able to get Verstappen a working car for the race and he won it. That's kind of their requirement: feedback for car development, help with tyre selection, help with setup. Yuki hasn't been able to do that and there are a few races in 2025 Verstappen could have finished higher if they had been able to use Yuki as a second driver. So he won't keep that job."", 'With 2026 being the start of new regulations, there is absolutely no need to keep Tsunoda if they don’t think he is their future.', ""The only argument for keeping Tsunoda is the potential damage it will do to Hadjar throwing him in that seat so soon.\n\nTsunoda has been dreadful and his performances do not warrant a seat at a top team, they didn't before he was promoted and they haven't done since he was promoted either.\n\nMy kids have a joke that Red Bull try to sandwich as much of the field as possible... last couple of races Tsunoda has been trying to keep up his end of the bargain and Max has let the side down."", ""If Daniel was in that car with those results and I made a post like this I would be laughed out of here.

In this regard, Tsunoda is clearly not the driver that can replace Max Verstappen, and hence he's not worth keeping."", ""You guys were not saying this when Sergio was with the team last year.

1osr9dz,How can this sudden decline in piastri’s skill-set be justified?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osr9dz/how_can_this_sudden_decline_in_piastris_skillset/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"https://preview.redd.it/q5pyaz232a0g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=773477daac12dbb6de974cc7b092b6cb49e55675

Just finished watching the São Paulo Grand Prix, and I think a lot of people have noticed this too. McLaren’s driver dynamic looks completely different from how it started this season.

Oscar Piastri seemed to have the upper hand earlier in the year. He was adapting quickly to upgrades, putting together strong qualifying runs, and consistently finishing near the front. Lately though, he’s still in the top five but hasn’t really been in the fight for podiums. Lando Norris, on the other hand, looks like he’s hit another level. His race weekends are a lot cleaner, his strategies have been spot on, and all those early-season reliability issues are basically gone.

At one point, I honestly thought Piastri could be a dark horse for the title based on how well-rounded his performances were. But that form feels like a distant memory now. You don’t just lose the pace and confidence you’ve shown all season in five races. And it’s not like Norris suddenly learned something completely new overnight either.

So what’s changed? Has McLaren shifted development away from this year’s car and Piastri’s struggling to find the right setup window? If that’s the case, how is Norris unaffected, especially when early in the season the talk was that Piastri had adapted more naturally to the MCL38?

Curious what people think. Is this about setup direction, confidence, or something within McLaren’s current development path and race strategy choices?

1oss8yc,Booing at Brazil podium towards Norris,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss8yc/booing_at_brazil_podium_towards_norris/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"This is my first time posting and I think this is an important discussion to have as a standalone instead of in the daily threads.

Lando is a hated driver and obviously people have their favourites but booing especially when it’s podium time is a stretch. I am a Ferrari fan and think Lando is talented but I don’t like his attitude so it’s not like I am looking for reasons that he is “mistreated”. Max has received booing in the past as well and I disagree when that happens too but this time I thought I’d like to hear others opinions on this as well because i haven’t seen discourse around it.

Socials: I went on the f1 instagram page to see if there was any mention of it but instead the comments under posts where anti lando and pro everyone else - fine, people have their opinions, I am not too fond of him either BUT no mention of booing.

Disrespect: I come from a culture where sports and national anthems are sacred. Even if you hate a person or nation, when they are on a podium and ESPECIALLY when a national anthem is playing you sit quiet but as protest you can turn your back or walk away. During the podium I was watching F1 TV and Alex did his best to speak over the boos but it was overwhelming and obviously he had to stay quiet during the English national anthem. 

Another think to note is that I think it’s also disrespectful to the other drivers on the podium because it takes away from their experience. The biggest giveaway of this for me was poor Kimi. I was watching his reactions to the podium as it was only his second time and it’s obvious he is not as experienced on how to handle difficult situations like this one. You could see on his face when Lando was receiving the trophy and the boos were loud that he was deeply uncomfortable and tried to laugh it off when he received the trophy himself. I just thing it’s an awful situation for everyone involved.

I only became a fan post Covid  and generally there has been a shift in how crowds act nowadays in events. So my two questions for you are 1) does anyone know if booing in motorsport during podiums and anthems have always been a thing 2) what is your opinion on it","['Both Hamilton and Max were disliked in Brazil in a certain point of their careers, things change, it’s not something personal.', 'To quote Lando\n\n""Just ignore all the people talking crap about you""\n\nI don\'t think he cares if anyone boos and throws hissy fit anymore', ""I watched Lewis serenely tell booing crowds that they were the best fans in the world. Max was booed a whole lot, even back in his podium days but also in 2021 and 2022.\n\nHonestly, Brazil actually likes Lando a lot. They've cheered him on since his rookie year and loved him for defending that one Brazillian reporter a couple years ago. If you look at the fan stages, he had pretty good reception there.  \n  \nPeople just have their own horses in a championship fight. And some Brazillians probably like Max a lot more  - probably consider him one of their own now because of the in-laws."", 'If they care enough to boo you, you must be doing something right. Wear it like a badge of honor', ""I think it's ridiculous he's being booed but....\n\nVerstappen, Hamilton, Vettel all got booed. If Norris does what he's on course to do, he's just another Champion whose domination is pissing off people\n\nBelieve me, he won't give a shit if he wins"", '""I  come from a culture where sports and national anthems are sacred.""\n\n  \nSo you\'re not from Brasil?', 'Were those boos really for him? The trophy was presented to Lando by the governor of the state of São Paulo. He is a far-right extremist, extremely unpopular. So that’s questionable.', 'Booing has happened to many drivers: Max, Hamilton, Vettel', ""Even as a Lando fan, this conversation is sooo overdone. If anything, I welcome it considering this is the second weekend in a row he's won while facing the boos; it clearly motivates him to some extent lmao.\xa0"", 'Dude. People boo. Who cares, no need to white knight for your favorite millionaire.\xa0']",0,130,0.3,0,1505,1505,0,3,0.0,0
