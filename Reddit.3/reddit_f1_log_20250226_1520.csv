Most striking, of course, are the two drivers who finished second four times. Sir Stirling Moss is often said to be the best driver to never win a title and when looking at this you can see why. On the other hand though, Prost won four and finished second four times. He was 5.5 points away from being a 7 time champion and 12.5 away from being an 8 time champion. Another name that stood out to me was Ronnie Peterson, because while I had heard the name before, I didn't really know much about him, so finding out he finished second twice was a surprise. One last little thing I found interesting before moving to the next list is that Vettel actually finished second before Alonso did, with his 2009 second place. Alonso had already been in the sport for almost a decade and was a 2 time champion by then, but never did finish second up to that point. He came close in 2007 finishing tied on points with Hamilton for second but losing out to him on countback. This season, Hamilton and Alonso could in theory tie the record, or maybe Verstappen will finally join the list.

After seeing the stats about who came second the most I was curious about who took the title fight to the last race, but just couldn't get over that final hurdle and lost on the final day. For this list I included any driver that had a mathematical chance of winning the title going into the final race and lost. Multiple times this included more than two drivers, meaning that there were multiple who lost on the final day.

**Most Titles Lost in Last Race**

1. Lewis Hamilton **- 4**
2. Michael Schumacher **- 3**

\- Fernando Alonso **- 3**

4. Stirling Moss **- 2**

\- Jim Clark **- 2**

\- Alain Prost **- 2**

7. Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, Peter Collins, Jean Behra, Luigi Fagioli, José Froilán González, Tony Brooks, Graham Hill, Jack Brabham, Jackie Stewart, Denny Hulme, Clay Regazzoni, Jody Scheckter, Niki Lauda, Jacques Laffite, Carlos Reutemann, John Watson, René Arnoux, Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet, Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve, Eddie Irvine, Kimi Räikkönen, Felipe Massa, Mark Webber, Nico Rosberg **- 1**

I suppose it sort of makes sense that the best driver ever statistically would have a lot of title fights go down to the last race, though to lose 4 like that must not feel great. As I'm sure many of you know, Lewis finished 2nd in his first season, losing out to Räikkönen by only one point. His other losses at the final race come in 2010 when he was one of four drivers that could have won the title, 2016 when he was beat by a Monaco based YouTuber in equal machinery, and of course in the infamous 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix which I am not going to get in to here. Schumacher arguably had the largest amount of points dropped to an opponent in the final race, when he was disqualified after the 1997 European Grand Prix for trying to take out championship rival Jacques Villeneuve. Alonso got to share in the fun of losing out by only one point in 2007, tying on points with Lewis but finishing third on countback. His other two times losing on the last race came against Vettel in the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix when he couldn't get past Vitaly Petrov and the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix in one of the craziest races of all time. Speaking of titles lost in Brazil, we can't have this discussion without talking about the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, where Felipe Massa was WDC for all of 30 seconds before Hamilton was able to pass the slow Timo Glock on just about the last turn of the last lap. Going back to Alonso's good friend Vettel, despite finishing third three times, he never lost at the final race. One final thing that I found interesting while doing this was that despite their rivalry being arguably the most famous in the history of the sport, Senna and Prost never had a title decided between them on the final race. The three times they finished as 1-2 the title was decided in Japan, at the penultimate race. Like with the previous stat, Alonso could in theory tie the record this year, or Hamilton could extend his gap at the top, though I'm not sure if we want them to have to go through that again.

To finish this long post off, I have a little bonus stat. While I was finding titles lost in the last race, it only made sense to also record who won those titles on the last race.

**Most Titles Won in Last Race**

1. Fangio **- 2**

\- Graham Hill **- 2**

\- Nelson Piquet  **- 2**

\- Michael Schumacher  **- 2**

\- Mika Häkkinen **- 2**

\- Lewis Hamilton **- 2**

\- Sebastian Vettel **- 2**

8. Nino Farina, Mike Hawthorn, Jack Brabham, John Surtees, Denny Hulme, Emerson Fittipaldi, James Hunt, Keke Rosberg, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve, Fernando Alonso, Kimi Räikkönen, Nico Rosberg, Max Verstappen **- 1**

Interestingly, no driver has won more than two title deciding races. This year Hamilton could be the first driver to ever win three title deciding races, or Alonso or Verstappen can tie the record. Maybe this is the next record Max will come after.

I hope anyone who made it this far enjoyed learning about all of this as much as I did. Thank you for reading to those who who did make it here. If anyone finds a mistake in my post please let me know, and if anyone has any other interesting stats related or not related to this I would love to hear them.
