Given their times are not great, I suspect they're frantically trying different setups to find something that works.

On the first day of practice for the Australian GP, all 20 Formula 1 cars were equipped with two additional cameras, which were aimed directly at the front wing and rear wing from both sides. A detailed deployment plan determined which camera was filming which driver in which practice session.\n\n> The 50 gram cameras recorded continuously. This meant that a Formula 1 driver could be at the front right and rear left in the first practice session and vice versa for his team-mate. And the other way round in the second session.\n\n> The world governing body began to keep a closer eye on the teams last year. Word had got around that some cars were equipped with front wings that bent under increasing load in order to shift the aero balance from the front to the rear. Of course, they all passed the static load tests.\n\n>Special high-resolution cameras. \nAt the Belgian GP, the FIA began filming the front wings in order to obtain more information about the degree of bending. The test was continued until the 2024 season finale and ultimately led to a tightening of the static tests from the Spanish GP onwards.\n\n> At the Azerbaijan GP last year, it then emerged that the teams were also playing tricks with the rear wings. McLaren bent the flap upwards on the outside, Ferrari pushed the main blade further down on the inside when the DRS was not activated. The aim of both was to increase the gap between the main blade and the flap. This reduces drag and increases top speed.

According to Article 3.15.17 of the Technical Regulations, the gap between the wing elements may not increase by more than two millimetres if a force of 750 newtons is applied to the left and right of the wing when stationary.\n\n> If the video recordings show that the gap widens by more than the permitted two millimetres when driving, the FIA can slap the Formula 1 team concerned on the wrist and ask them to rectify the situation. However, disqualification is not possible.\n\n> It is rumoured from association circles that the rules could be tightened in the short term if there are too many violations in the rear as well as the front wing.

If only because of their legendary long runs. On one lap, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris finished second and third, a good tenth of a second behind the day‚Äôs winner Charles Leclerc. Many experts believe that McLaren is just bluffing. Ferrari team boss Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur is not just clinging to Charles Leclerc‚Äôs best time. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt far away from McLaren in the long run either.‚Äù\n\n> The top speeds were also equal. They were only 0.5 km/h apart. Leclerc was a few hundredths of a second faster than Norris in all three sectors. The race simulations went to the Papaya cars with a slight advantage. Norris was the fastest with an average of 1m 21.903s over eleven laps on medium tyres.\n\n> Leclerc covered three more laps and averaged 1m 22.140s. However, he turned up the power on the last two laps. The picture is similar for his team-mates. Piastri completed eleven laps with an average time of 1m 22.110s. Hamilton averaged 1m 22.228s over 13 laps.\n\n> Where does Mercedes stand? \nMercedes team boss Toto Wolff assesses the situation as follows: ‚ÄúMcLaren is at the front. Then everyone else is in line.‚Äù The Austrian may have to make a correction when it comes to Ferrari. Even after the first day of practice, it is difficult to judge how strong the Silver Arrows themselves are. Mercedes bucked the trend with hard tyres in the long run.\n\n> The engineers were surprised that everyone else opted for medium tyres. They are not worried about this. Continuous rain is forecast for Sunday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll only need rain tyres or intermediates anyway.‚Äù\n\n> George Russell equalled Norris‚Äô long run best time by just a few hundredths on the hard rubber. Andrea Kimi Antonelli put in a decent performance for his first endurance run under real-life conditions. On his fastest lap, the 18-year-old Italian was still four tenths behind his team-mate.\n\n> Explanation: ‚ÄúIt was the first time I had driven with C5 tyres. I didn‚Äôt get them into the window perfectly.‚Äù In general, the Mercedes drivers struggled with Pirelli‚Äôs softest compound. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt gain as much time as we should have. This was possibly due to the asphalt temperatures of over 40 degrees,‚Äù analysed Russell.\n\n> Another explanation is that both Mercedes drivers were too aggressive on their fast laps and then paid for it in the final sector with rear tyres that were too hot. A modest engine mode cost an additional 0.35 seconds over the competition on the straights.\n\n> Should Verstappen be worried? \nThe Formula 1 world champion was quite satisfied with the first practice session. He was four tenths behind Lando Norris in fifth place, although he was held up by Carlos Sainz on his lap. The Dutchman did not have a clean lap in afternoon practice either. After a mistake in turn 3, he abandoned the attempt. He later laboured his way up to seventh place. The gap to the leader was 0.624 seconds.\n\n> The champion then spent 13 minutes in the pits before tackling his long run on medium tyres, which turned into a short run with nine minutes remaining. The set-up was changed during the break. Different front wings were also used. ‚ÄúWe made the car worse compared to the first practice session,‚Äù lamented Head of Sport Helmut Marko.\n\n> The instability in some corners returned. According to their own calculations, McLaren is ahead by three tenths. Ferrari and Verstappen follow. One indication that the Red Bull RB21 still has its moods is the large gap of Liam Lawson. The New Zealander lost six tenths on one lap and 1.2 seconds on the long run to his team captain. ‚ÄúThat should be a little less,‚Äù hoped Marko.\n\n> How good are Toro Rosso and Williams?\nIn the opening session, Williams continued its show from the test drives with first and sixth places for Carlos Sainz and Alexander Albon. Team Principal James Vowles warned: ‚ÄúWe are significantly better than last year, but not as good as it looks.‚Äù In the second session, Sainz and Albon finished eleventh and twelfth with exactly the same lap time, just outside the top 10.\n\n> The blue cars performed differently in the long run. Albon went out twice for five laps each and looked correspondingly good. Sainz finished seventh in the endurance runs. From a Williams driver‚Äôs perspective, five tenths of a second behind the McLaren is not a disaster.\n\n> While Williams surprised in the first session, Toro Rosso set the tone in the second. Yuki Tsunoda finished the session in fourth place, just 0.345 seconds behind the best time. Rookie Isack Hadjar also impressed. Sixth place despite a handicap.\n\n> The Frenchman already cut a fine figure in the morning. But the excellent times came at the price of less petrol and a higher power mode. Hadjar was supposed to practise in the qualifying trim. There was no time for this during the tests. Marko estimates: ‚ÄúWilliams is ahead of us.‚Äù\n\n> Has Haas gambled away? \nThat was a real slap in the face for Haas. Oliver Bearman destroyed his car in a high-speed accident in the 220 km/h chicane in the first practice session. It was not ready for the second practice session. Esteban Ocon finished penultimate in both sessions. 1.6 seconds off the lead and three tenths off the rest.\n\n> The Frenchman complained about balance problems. The engineers were able to solve some of these between the two practice sessions. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs still more to come,‚Äù demanded Ocon. The US Ferrari‚Äôs understeer cannot be completely eradicated. So far, no setup trick has helped. It will probably be up to the aerodynamicists.\n\n> Sauber showed an improvement compared to the test, which Nico H√ºlkenberg underlined with eighth place. The German‚Äôs race simulation was also impressive. With an average of 1:22.592 minutes, the Sauber driver was in the sandwich of the Toro Rosso drivers. Gabriel Bortoleto was sent out on the track with an alternative setup with significantly more downforce. It was a failure. Conclusion: The new parts are starting to work. The car has become much more consistent.\n\n> Are the cars or the track that fast? \nLast year‚Äôs time was beaten by 1.2 seconds in the first practice session and by eight tenths in the second. The reason for this lies in the track and the tarmac. The drivers reported that the track surface offered more grip from the start than before.\n\n> The many support races that put rubber on the track at Albert Park played a positive role here. The rest of the time is spent developing the cars. Sauber Technical Director James Key confirms: ‚ÄúThese cars are real monsters. We‚Äôve never seen so much downforce in Formula 1 as today.‚Äù', 'Based off of this report the pecking order at the top seems to be:\n\nMcLaren, Ferrari in a close 2nd, Max, Mercedes, Liam\n\nAfter that it feels like Williams, VCARB, Aston Martin, and even Sauber all have a shot at the tail end of the points. \n\nWith temperatures set to get even hotter tomorrow it will be interesting to see how much that affects the cars compared to today. Mercedes already struggled on the quali runs today because their tires got too hot, so it could be even worse tomorrow. But on the other hand if they fire up the tires quicker than the rest that could also help them on Sunday when it‚Äôs cold and rainy. So there is a lot that can still change.', 'Can McLaren annoy Ferrari?', ""Three tenths would be depressing. But I wonder if it was after testing or after today's running"", 'McLaren being 1-2 tenths faster + drama + ferrari being the second fastest.\n\nI need this\n\n2007 vibes but this time Lewis is Kimi', 'Ferrari close second or maybe first in quali. \n\nMcLaren prob solid edge in race.', ""Maybe we'll see in quali and/or FP3 but there still seems to be a real belief that McLaren are sandbagging and have clearance.

Obviously losing the Vodafone sponorship and dropping the iconic chrome paint scheme meant they had to start their livery design from scratch, but there is no excuse for how bland and uninspired those cars were.

We don't give this leeway to other drivers (outside of rookies) and don't hear other drivers moaning about it.

Sainz is striaight up to speed at Williams, Ocon and Hulkenberg are expected to be straight on it with their new teams.

But all we hear about and from Hamilton is how hard the transition is and how it is going to take him time to get upto speed.

What is going on here? We didn't hear this when Hamitlon went to Mercedes in 2013, he was on the pace right away beating Rosberg.

His steering wheel he's used for 12 years is also radically different, although Ferrari have tried to adjust it as much as they can. \n\nHe's had the same race engineer for 12 years, which we know is insanely important, as Max has said he would **never** drive in F1 with any other engineer other than GP. \n\nAs far as I can remember, no one else has ever spent that many years at one team and then gone to another to compete at the front against one of the fastest drivers on the grid as his teammate. \n\nIt's genuinely an unusual position to be in, you can't really compare it to anyone else honestly."", 'There has only been two practice sessions.
