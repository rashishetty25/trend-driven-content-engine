The only constant between Jeddah and Japan was the lower tyre wear."", ""# MARKO SUDDENLY HOPEFUL AFTER RACE VERSTAPPEN: “MAYBE BEAT MCLAREN AROUND IMOLA” \n\n*Where things looked anything but good at Red Bull in Bahrain, Helmut Marko has more faith after the Saudi Arabia GP. He hopes that through updates in three stages Red Bull can really take the fight to McLaren.*\n\nThe Bahrain Grand Prix, as is well known, has been the low point of the Formula One season so far for Red Bull Racing. Max Verstappen managed to limit the damage somewhat with a sixth place, but the reality was that Red Bull proved powerless with the RB21 at the Sakhir circuit. A weekend later, the world looked a lot better. Verstappen managed to claim pole position in Jeddah and, according to Christian Horner and Helmut Marko, would normally have won the race as well, were it not for a five-second time penalty that threw a spanner in the works.\n\n**Updates in three stages: “**We are taking small steps”\n\n“We were surprised, but positively surprised,” Marko revealed afterwards in the paddock in Jeddah about the race pace. “Compared to Bahrain we made a lot of progress, although this circuit also suits us better. Here you have many more fast corners and different asphalt, which helped us,” Marko acknowledged. Nevertheless, he also sees signs that the 81-year-old Austrian believes indicate more structural improvement. “We are making strides and trying to make the car more predictable. Furthermore, we are working on making the car a bigger window.” With those last words, Marko is referring to the car's set-up window. Horner has already explained that Red Bull was unable to find that in Bahrain, which made the picture look particularly bad, and that the optimal window was found for that circuit prior to qualifying in Jeddah.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Red Bull had some new parts on the car, with Marko explaining that these were three-step updates. In Miami - as in Jeddah - another small upgrade should follow, followed by more in Imola, according to the Austrian. “We are making small steps. I think that around Imola we should be in a position where we have the speed to beat the McLarens,” Marko reveals quite optimistically after a question from Motorsport.com.\n\n**Can heat in Miami still make things difficult for Red Bull?**\n\nBefore that follows the race weekend in Florida, and that could be an interesting one. For example, Horner revealed that McLaren was in a class of its own in the heat. The gap in practice sessions was at times 1.2 seconds per lap, according to the Briton, which made him laugh: “On Friday we still thought McLaren would lap everyone!” In the evening sessions it was still hot, but Red Bull performed better than expected. That said, the sessions in Miami are run during the day and it can be quite hot in The Sunshine State.\n\nDoes Marko fear the next Grand Prix somewhat because of that? “Well, fortunately the race is not around lunch time and normally the sun sets, of course. We have to see how it goes there and if we can find more performance, but I normally think we can be competitive there as well.”\n\nTranslated with DeepL"", ""Max has proven that he sure can beat Mclarens but RBR as a team won't with only 1 car consistently in the points while Mclaren puts both of their drivers into high points scoring positions unless something goes wrong."", 'This has to do with the nature of the track. Fast and fast corners, like Suzuka work good for the RB. Slow tracks and slow corners will set them back again.', 'We can be sure of one thing, if Max has the car to compete with McLaren this early in the season, it is over for Lando and Oscar.', ""RBR had a shaky start to the season, but will probably be back in form pretty quickly. As soon as Yuki's accustomed fully to the car over the next few races, they have a decent chance at recovering. McLaren's still gonna win WCC most likely, but I think it's a bit hasty to act like Red Bull is gonna completely fall apart. Yuki's their best second seat over the past few years, Max is the GOAT, and the car is still capable of pulling results. Evidently.\n\nIf I can hold a crystal ball for a second, my prediction is by the midseason Yuki's gonna be pulling results similar enough to early RB-Checo - hopefully pulling a few podiums and just genuinely being a pretty reliable support for Max. That already automatically puts them ahead of a team like Ferrari, who have similarly bad car issues but worse strategy (and I can see Yuki ending up pulling better results than Hamilton  soon enough, maybe). Mercedes is probably their biggest fight since George is obviously excellent and Kimi's getting great results, but I see no way Red Bull leaves the top three. And they have a pretty strong chance at top 2.\n\nWhat do I know though, I literally only started watching this sport this year.""]",390,116,0.94,390,113,113,162,28,0.009999999999999898,162

The fact he had so much steering lock on makes it so obvious that he wasn’t going to make the corner just by looking at the trajectory of the car from the video, how he was carrying too much speed and understeering well off track. Obviously the fact he was carrying far too much speed is why he was able to be alongside or even marginally ahead at the apex. But people continue to ignore the making the corner aspect of the rules (this is also why he got a track limits violation).\n\nMy question for discussion is simply why do we think that is? How are there a small subset of people arguing Max was unfairly forced off and shouldn’t have been penalised?\n\nIs it just from such strong allegiance to their driver, a lack of understanding of physics or something else?', 'This Is a thing people say when a driver Is in a position where ""he shouldn\'t be"" , they probably mean that , the said driver Is driving closer to the limit of the car than his other competitors, that said, you can\'t ""outdrive"" a car there\'s no way Max would have won the title in a Haas\n\nMabye a great driver can find the extra tenth by pushing the car a bit more , but not ""much"" \n\nAlso where there are circumstances, for example, ocon finishing P5 in a Haas in china, the Haas wasn\'t a fifth place car, but he finished there, so he ""outperformed"" the ""best result capable for his machine"" \nBut at no point in that race did he ""outdrive"" the car, or he would have been in the wall, what he did was take advantage of circumstances (like Ferrari DSQ) or others in faster cars underperforming (like Lawson) to get that result\n\nThey say ""outdrive"" because it\'s more simple and sounds better, Imagine reading for example ""Max Verstappen drives close to the limit of the car to win in Japan"" or "" Max Verstappen outdrives the car to take an outstanding win in Japan""\n\nThe second one makes him look like magic , so more clicks, and when the media talk like that, the fans start to talk that way as well', ""I don't think it's really possible to out perform or drive the car.  \n  \nA car, in its ideal conditions has its limitations, when put on a circuit with its specific characteristics and environmental conditions define what's possible for any driver to extract.  \nIt's the driver's job to get as close to the performance potential of the car, as possible and achieve this consistently throughout the race distance and developing environmental conditions with its individual tire wear characteristics.  \n  \nEvery time someone exceeds the limits of the cara potential, they spin out, lose traction, miss the brake point or slide and wear down the tires too fast - is where they outdrive/outperform the car, as they go beyond the physical limits of what the car is capable of."", 'It\'s all to do with expectations.
