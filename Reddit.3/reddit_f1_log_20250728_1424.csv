But once again the race yesterday saw basically no variance in tyre strategy 


Most cars put the (M) tyre on around lap 13. 


By lap 20

Refueling added so much dynamics to races as you could undercut heavily since less fuel also meant shorter pit stops.\n\n\nNow the difference between the slowest pit and the fastest is what, 1s? This makes it just so hard to use pits and number of stops as a viable strategy', 'cold weather helped pilots keep those tyres usable last so long, only cars with excessive load were chewing through them.', ""Tyre management.

Team is operating on a really strong level with much less mistakes than last year. They‚Äôre handling inter team battle really well (but considering other teams are realistically out of the fight it‚Äôs probably easier) Both drivers are showing great level of driving with Oscar having a slight edge in consistency over Lando. But even with slight mistakes Lando makes, he‚Äôs still keeping himself in a Fight.\n\n**Max Verstappen**\n\nProbably the only bright spot of the Team this year so far. He‚Äôs always ready to pounce and grab the win when the opportunity arrives. Really can‚Äôt ask anything more from a driver and Max this season is the only thing keeping mclaren drivers on their toes.\n\n**Williams and Albon**\n\nWilliams delivered on a huge growth this year, definitely a positive step in the right direction and mostly thanks to incredible consistency from Alex. Everyone doubted him, and put him under a lot of pressure with Carlos coming into a team but he handled himself brilliantly. You could say Carlos had a few unlucky ones this year but Alex has him beat handily so far and he showa no signs of stopping.\n\n**Pierre Gasly**\n\nI think it‚Äôs unfair to see how little recognition Pierre gets this year. He‚Äôs driving the wheels of of that Alpine and i genuinely sometimes can‚Äôt believe how he pulls it off. A team that has myriad of problems with management (or should i rather say missmanagement), morale, performance, he‚Äôs still getting regular q3 entries with some outstanding Qualy laps, and some wonderful race drives. He‚Äôs definitely one of top driver performers this year.\n\n**Sauber**\n\nFrom a team that i expected the least, and when i expected them to wait out a Year before transforming into Audi. They surprised me the most. It looks like they really consolidated their management and leadership, nailed a driver pairing and even brought upgrades to the car to be genuinely competetive with other midfielders. It‚Äôs great to see them being rewarded with a podium (And what a podium it was). Both Nico and Gabi had great races.\xa0\n\n**George Russell**\n\nThis is the year where George really visibly stepped up. Lewis leaving mercedes created a big power vacuum, and George took it upon himself to take it. He‚Äôs shown some real stellar drives this year, and barely put a foot wrong so far this year. He‚Äôs finally showing his true potential that he was being called for years. Ultimately he‚Äôs being let down by Mercedes and a car they delivered him (much like Leclerc).\n\n\n**Charles Leclerc**\n\nThere‚Äôs really not much more a team can ask from their driver. Charles is doing absolute maximum Ferrari is able to do. He‚Äôs consistent, his racecraft is wonderful, tyre management is great, Charles is having a stellar driving season so far and is being let down by the car that simpy doesn‚Äôt have the pace to be competetive for the wins. He really continued on his driving form from last season in the best possible way, and it‚Äôs a real shame he cannot crown it with wins.\n\nNeutrals\n\n** Racing bulls**\n\nI was thinking, is it really fair not to put them in the positives column, they had some stellar drives, bunch of points, and Hadjar really impressed with some great drives as a Rookie. It‚Äôs true but whole driver seat drama in RB family, really leaves bad taste. They started the season strong with both Yuki and Hadjar, then when the swap happened lawson had a lot of issues, but in the end he‚Äôs also slowly regaining confidence and driving better. Strategy wise they‚Äôre still the biggest clowns of the field and that is the only reason why i‚Äôm not rating them positively.\n\n**HAAS**\n\nHaas this year might be the definition of neutral. While they had some great drives from both drivers and the pairing seems to work really well, they are really showing no signs of some great improvement and growth. They are always in the mix to score some points but also can be nowhere near them.\n\n\n**Lewis Hamilton**\n\n\nTransition to the red team has been really painful for Lewis. I cannot say he disappointed because it would be unfair, he had few stellar drives but mostly he was average at best. The car doesn‚Äôt suit him and it‚Äôs painfully obvious. Charles has and edge on him but i think that was also expected. Overall, pacewise i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs even that far from Charles. And i genuinely think that Carlos wouldn‚Äôt be better than Lewis this year in Ferrari even though he‚Äôd have a lot more experience with red cars. Lewis has shown sparks of his true self in some races and i hope he continues to improve in the rest of the season but ultimately Ferrari gave him an ass of a car and it‚Äôs hampering him a Lot.\n\n\n*Negatives*\n\n\n**Ferrari**\n\n\nI think it‚Äôs fair to say that ferrari is abbysmal this year. From a team that was genuinely competetive to Mclaren last season to the team that is a 5th best car on some occasions this year. A shame because they have a super interesting drivers lineup and they‚Äôve managed to fuck them up.\n\n**Red Bull**\n\nA fall from grace of last year spiraled to an abyssmal level this year, Car is barely drivable even for Max, losing a bunch of crucial staff members, comically atrocious missmanagement of the team and 2nd car being virtually non existant. \xa0The whole Yuki/Liam situation was ridiculous, pit stop crew is also out of shape for many races this year.\n\n**Aston Martin**\n\nReally don‚Äôt know what to say about them as a team. Stroll is non existant for most of the races, Alonso is driving average this season with some good results.\n\n**Alpine**\n\nTeam missmanagement (whole doohan colapinto saga), car going nowhere pacewise even with upgrades, Gasly is the only bright spot of the team.\n\n\nI understand i haven‚Äôt mentioned some stuff and drivers, but post is already too long :)', 'Is the 16 points the largest lead the whole year?', 'best rivalries \nLeclerc v russel\nalbon vs antonelli \nrest of the field vs each other - p12 - p20 brutal', 'Just one points finish in last 7 races is ridiculous. \n\nNot that he‚Äôs at fault for them all, but he‚Äôd be sacked at Red Bull or exchanged for an VCARB driver', 'Antonelli reeks of underdevelopment.

There has been a big discussion lately on whether the 2025 Belgium Grand Prix should have started under wet conditions or not.

There is worthwhile discussion to be had around this issue, it ultimately boils down to some people will have higher risk tolerances, and some will have lower tolerances. Discourse seems unlikely to change that.

So this is not a post about whether the race should have started sooner or not.

This post is instead about addressing a sentiment that has been surprisingly common in this community.

You have surely seen comments such as these (these are all real comments from the last 24h, I don't want to strawman here): 

- Humans enjoy watching others risk their lives for their own entertainment. We used to have duels to death for millenniums. 

- I dunno, I preferred the sport when it was more about the spectacle than safety. 

- Motorsport is and always will be dangerous. It should be, that's part of the thrill. 

- As much as I don‚Äôt want anyone to get hurt (I definitely don‚Äôt) the risks and accidents make f1 exciting. 

- I want the mess and the crashes.

These comments are arguing (with, it must be said, a variable amount of hinges) that risk, danger, spectacle, are something that enhances formula 1, racing in general. 

It's a compelling sentiment, but I want to argue how it is not necessarily true, and later I'll provide an alternative viewpoint that will hopefully give you a different perspective on danger and racing.

Crashes and danger add to the thrill:
I was at Spa in 2019. The danger of racing was on full display. There was a big crash, a red flag. People left the circuit not knowing what was going on. Thrilling and exciting are NOT words I would use to describe the mood. There was horror, there was shock, there was anxiety. There were people retching on the side of the road while waiting for their shuttles. We later found out that Anthoine Hubert had died in that crash. He was 22 years old. 

About a year later Romain Grosjean went into the barriers at Bahrain. The fireball was surely spectacular. Do you remember how you felt at that moment? Would you describe the feeling as exciting? I bet you weren't thinking ""Now that's why I tune in to F1"".

""Danger makes F1 exciting"" is a compelling sentiment, but ultimately a very shielded one. A sentiment that is privileged enough to not have been face-to-face with the consequences of said danger. 

A better alternative:

So, we like the danger, but not it's consequences.
That makes F1... a rollercoaster. You go on a rollercoaster because of big thrills. You want to FEEL danger, without actually being exposed to it. No one wants their rollercoaster to actually BE dangerous - ""I heard they really skimped out on the maintenance on this one!"". 

So feel free to argue about the FIA's decision. But please remember:

We are here for the racing, not the danger. You don't actually like the danger, you like the idea of it.

That's all I have to say, please refrain from turning this thread into another discussion on what should have been done yesterday. I think I made it clear, this is meant as a criticism of the ""Danger is exciting"" sentiment.

PS. There is a bit of a tone shift when I talk about Hubert's crash. I wrote that section last, after I had already made the light jokes about rollercoasters and so on. If that comes across as disrespectful, or insensitive I can only apologise.

","['There should be jeopardy, but not danger.\n\nCrashing is part of the sport and is a neccesary part of the sport as it is what seperated the good from the great, it is what penalises mistakes in an effective way. Racing is risk and reward. Without the risk of crashing then racing becomes much easier to do and much less interesting to watch, not because we like seeing crashes, but we like to see drivers being brave and doing incredible things.\n\nHowever what the drivers should be risking is finishing the race, or losing time, not injuries and death.', 'I think you‚Äôre putting words in the mouths of many who are simply suggesting (right or wrong) that the race could have run safely and the full wet tires weren‚Äôt even used when the race started.\xa0\n\nIn years past, we would see the skill of the drivers in the rain, which really allows spectators to see just how amazing they are. Granted they‚Äôre like that on every lap they do, but in the rain it‚Äôs just easier for those, especially watching a broadcast, to see their skills.\xa0\n\nIf this was a perfect storm (no pun intended) because Spa is very high speed, has had a recent death, and visibility with these cars especially is a challenge, then so be it, and perhaps it was the best call to make.\xa0\n\nBut to suggest that people asking for the race to have started earlier is because there would be a greater element of danger is disingenuous to many. Many viewers simply enjoy seeing the impressive skills in true wet conditions, and it‚Äôs got everything to do with keeping the car on the track and pointing straight, and nothing to do with the idea of danger and devastating crashes.\xa0', 'When people say danger they generally mean ""it\'s more difficult to drive and it makes the risk of someone wiping out larger, drivers need to be more skilled and careful, which increases excitement"".\n\nNot ""I hope someone dies today"".\n\nAnd there\'s a reason so many of the best races of all time are wet races. Because it\'s the only races that aren\'t decided entirely upon who has the best car.     \nWe knew 2 races in who was going to win close to every single race this year (one of the Mclarens), wet races being the only likely exceptions.', 'yes, the ""danger is exciting"" sentiment is straight bullshit, and people who genuinely derive excitement from watching people die should get themselves checked into an institution\n\nbut I think that\'s not the main point people are making when it comes to racing in the rain, the main sentiment is ""we should be able to race in these conditions safely, and the FIA really need to sort out their shit to make it happen""\n\nthe fact that with just a bit of a drizzle visibility can get so low that you can barely see the car that\'s ahead of you is a big problem with these ground effect cars, and in 2026 the hope is that the new lower downforce floors and lack of a beam wing will reduce that spray', 'The issue isn‚Äôt safety vs spectacle, the issue is the design of the cars themselves creating far too much spray. We all want to see wet racing, but we simply can‚Äôt race in wet conditions anymore. I can count on one hand the amount of times full wets have been used by the majority of the field', ""You have to remember, this isn't just about the drivers safety, but the safety of the marshals and crowd. \n\nWhen Jules Bianchi hit a JCB after losing control in the wet. It is often forgotten that there was a team of marshals around that car and driving the JCB. They are all very lucky to be alive and could easily have been hit by Bianchi's car. \n\nSure, racing drivers accept that they are taking part in a dangerous sport and are paid millions to do so. \n\nMarshals aren't millionaires. They are mostly volunteers."", 'Thank you for adding this viewpoint. It‚Äôs important to remember that the drivers are humans. \nAnd while crashing is part of the game, so is an expectation of the driver being able to come away from the crash in a relatively and reasonably safe condition in the end. \n\nPutting humans in a condition where there is valid speculation that this level of safety not be the outcome, isn‚Äôt what anyone should want to see at the end of the day. \n\nIf the drivers are driving in a condition where there is a valid risk that they may not be showing up to the next race should they crash due to conditions outside of their control isn‚Äôt a good way to race.', '>About a year later Romain Grosjean went into the barriers at Bahrain. The fireball was surely spectacular. Do you remember how you felt at that moment? Would you describe the feeling as exciting? I bet you weren\'t thinking ""Now that\'s why I tune in to F1"".\n\nI was watching live when this happened. I think I had tears in my eyes. I kinda relived the moment when I saw the F1 Exhibition. It had one room dedicated to this crash. I basically relived the moment and all the feelings I had. It was definitely not a moment I want to see and witness in F1.\n\nAnd thank you for the post. It deserves all the upvotes and more.', 'Hubert and Grojean‚Äôs crashes both happened in the dry. Nobody is asking for gladiators, but if it‚Äôs really about safety, we‚Äôd be racing at 60kph on padded tracks. Most of the horrendous crashes of the 21st century have been in the dry conditions. It‚Äôs a dangerous sport; the drivers know it‚Äôs a dangerous sport, yet they show up anyway.

They said they were going to do a minimum of 2 laps behind the safety car, Ok 1 probably would have been enough but you\'ve made the decision that it will be 2 at minimum so I understand doing 2 laps, but then they did another 2 laps behind the safety car on top of that.\n\nthat I think is worthy of criticizing.\n\nthough to add some balance i think the *""end of wet races""* doomsayers may be overreacting.

That was a race that could've had potential, if not for the track drying up way too fast. In the end, it was sadly quite boring. \n\nLewis showed why a wet setup in the rain is worth a lot. Some great overtakes in the wet and then in the end the same setup screwed him over when it dried up and he didn't have the top speed to overtake Albon. In a similar vain, Max got stuck behind Charles as it dried up, no skinny wing, no top speed. Same with Yuki who got double screwed because the call to pit came a bit too late. It's a race of what could've been for a lot of drivers on wet setups. \n\nNorris with a rather bad restart. He went early, made a mistake into turn 1 and that sealed his fate. Piastri with a simple overtake. I don't think Norris had the pace to get past Piastri on track anyways. His mistakes later on in the race didn't help either.\n\nOn the bright side, everyone kept it on track when it was still wet. I'm still very impressed by Bortoleto. One of the best performing rookies for sure. \n\nAntonelli really is in a bit of a slump. For his sake I hope he recovers some confidence quickly. He's young, but if his performance doesn't have an upturn soon, the media is going to start the uncomfortable questions and I would hate that for him. \n\nNow my side note after the weekend. Can we just get rid of the wet tyres? It's not Pirelli's fault, but by the time the track conditions are bad enough for the full wets, visibility is too poor to race. Might as well just not bring those tyres to save on costs. No one uses them anyways. Maybe bring a third set of hard tyres instead, so teams can run them in practice if there's doubts about a two-stop race where the hard could be useful."", ""Ultimately, Lando lost the race and Oscar won the race at the start. Oscar knew he needed to take his chance and he did, so credit to him. Would love to better understand the battery issue Lando had and how much of a role it played (and how much of it was in/out of his control), but not sure we'll ever know. \n\nOnce Lando was in P2, the tire offset was probably his only fighting chance. A shame they didn't/couldn't double stack, since he easily lost net time to Oscar by having to do another lap on inters and lost net time to Charles behind as well, but I also have a feeling that if they had double stacked they would've both ended up on the mediums since the call for the hard seemed to be a super last minute call from his engineer as he was coming in. The extra lap on inters + the slow stop + a much slower tire meant he was climbing a mountain just to put Oscar under pressure. I think his own mistakes cost him the chance to get into DRS range, but I'm not sure even if he had had 5-6 laps of DRS behind Oscar that he would've been able to make the pass, given what we saw in the sprint and with Max/Charles throughout the whole race.\n\nOverall, I think both Lando and Oscar can take away plenty of positives from this weekend.

1mb0hly,When the Car Hides the Talent Gap: Antonelli vs Russell,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mb0hly/when_the_car_hides_the_talent_gap_antonelli_vs/,2025-07-27, Discussion,"I understand Antonelli‚Äôs age and the fact that he managed a P4 in his debut race and even got a podium. But when you neutralize the fact that he‚Äôs in a top-2 car ‚Äî which can even be the best in cold conditions ‚Äî the data becomes extremely disappointing. He was completely outclassed by Russell. Finishing behind him in 100% of the races statistically means Russell is simply *much better* than him, because Antonelli couldn‚Äôt even beat him once by luck or by making fewer mistakes. Looking at it objectively, it even feels unfair to see Antonelli getting all the attention just because he has a faster car and ends up near the top, while Hadjar, Bortoleto, and Bearman seem far more interesting than him.

Edit: ""rookie vs veteran"". We never had a champion that lost all their races against their rival. Usually it's very balanced and many won as rookies.

1masami,What‚Äôs the deal with Spa?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1masami/whats_the_deal_with_spa/,2025-07-27, Discussion,"I‚Äôm newer to F1, started watching closely in 2020. I‚Äôve never enjoyed Spa and have also dreaded its arrival on the calendar. The race has pretty much always been a dud (since I started watching). 2024 was fine‚Äînot the worst but not top 10 either. I have no love for Miami, but I‚Äôd rather watch 2 Miami races than what we got today. 

My question for long time watchers is when did things trend poorly for Spa? Is it reg specific? It seems unlike Japan and Imola, Spa has good passing corners and plenty of room for these bigger cars. I just don‚Äôt get it. 

On the flip side, I have a deep love for Austria. The race is pretty much a guaranteed banger. And I‚Äôm always shocked to hear how people have not universally loved this track until more recently.

Maybe it will be better next year though."", ""Preface: I love spa\n\nHistoric races tend to get a bit of a pass in the community because they are, well, historic. But more and more, people are realizing some of the historic tracks rely on the weather gods to produce good races, which really sucks. It's difficult to say whether it's the regulations, the tracks, the randomness being engineered out of the sport, etc. Spa is an amazing circuit with a rich motorsports history but it's difficult to say it's a top 5 track from an entertainment perspective over the last several years. It is an amazing track to drive in these cars, surely, but whether it still produces all time races is another story unfortunately."", ""Imola has good overtaking opportunities?

1mb1wd2,2024 Sainz vs 2025 Hamilton: It's not really close,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mb1wd2/2024_sainz_vs_2025_hamilton_its_not_really_close/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"Last year Carlos Sainz ended up with 9 podiums for Ferrari. He won Australia and Mexico. And in addition to 7 other podiums for Carlos, he also had 5 5th place finishes and a 4th. 15 top 5 finishes.

Through 13 races last year Seinz had 190 points. Hamilton has 109 (no I didn't transpose the numbers).

And yet you hear very little about Sainz now, struggling along to do the best he can with Williams; he's getting beat there by his own teammate this year, so there's that. Obviously it takes a little time to acclimate to a new environment; a reason that Hamilton OBVIOUSLY is given the benefit of the doubt on, despite last year's results at Mercedes.

Today Sainz's own pit crew screwed him over. And they then decided on a 2 stopper, and it simply didn't go his way today. Hamilton had one of his better races; passing a bunch of guys with his updated equipment and getting up to where he's normally at.

I do not feel that Hamilton is ever a threat to win a race. LeClerc has been consistently outperforming the world champion. It doesn't really feel competitive. Just like last year didn't feel that competitive with George Russell at Mercedes. I feel that, of the 8 seats that make up McClaren, Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, Hamilton is at best 6th, with the jury being out as way too early on Antonelli. Only the 2nd RB seat doesn't compare to Lewis.

In hindsight, the manner in which Sainz was quickly ushered out of Ferrari seems sort of sickening at this point. He's left to one choice, no options. And he's done career wise, unless one of the big three/four invite him to a seat, and obviously Ferrari isn't in the cards for that.

This seems alot different from a driver CHOOSING to leave because he's not the number one driver and wants to go somewhere else to be the big dog, like what happened with Daniel Riccardo, who should probably never have left RedBull. He's the last great 2nd driver they've had in years.

Guys like Sainz and Botas, who was a pretty darn productive driver for Mercedes, they both got the short end. Watching Nico's 3rd place finish a few weeks ago got me really thinking about this. There are some pretty damn good drivers out there, without the equipment to show their talent, left hoping for inclement weather or a miracle for them to have a quality day.

I've always loved Alonso, and have watched his struggle for many years now. About half the time he's ""the best of the rest"". Not this year obviously. But you watch him and you see the talent after all these years, and you cannot help but wonder how he'd do in a number one seat at one of the best places. Like with Sainz.

  
PS: Will Hamilton get a podium this year? It feels like wishful thinking at this point.
