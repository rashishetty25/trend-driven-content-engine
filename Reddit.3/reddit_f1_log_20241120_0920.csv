1guz22f,Why is George beating or matching Lewis for 2 seasons out of 3 so overlooked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1guz22f/why_is_george_beating_or_matching_lewis_for_2/,2024-11-19, Discussion,"Seriously, unless we agree that Lewis is basically nowhere near his prime level, then why is Russell not getting any credit for what he’s doing.

Yet people act like he’s merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about “experimental setups” or “Lewis is just unmotivated”, but, I’m sorry, that’s just a cop-out. Then we can just argue endlessly that basically no driver is worse than another driver, since there could always be intangibles like that, “oh, he just doesn’t care about driving in midfield cars”. really? 


I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it’s just that people overlook George because they don’t like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance. It's hard to compare when we have no real baseline when it comes to the car."", 'personally i’m curious to see how george and lewis do next year to grasp where they actually are because this merc is a very confusing car.

He\'s clearly comfortably in the Leclerc & Norris (and potentially Piastri in the future) bracket, and those who try and argue otherwise are just trying to fuel a narrative that fits whatever agenda they have.\n\nThat said, you\'re also making some statements in there regarding Lewis & Vettel that really don\'t make you look too much better.', 'George is in a quagmire. If he never beat Lewis at all, they’d say he’s the second coming of kovalainen and a burn out. If he beat Lewis three out of three seasons, it’s because Lewis is “past his prime” and “not all there anymore”. \n\nIn reality, he’s acquainted himself well under the toughest of circumstances, going up against the veritable goat in struggling cars. He’s taken it right to Lewis from the start and came out on top in 2022. Lewis crushed him in 23, but they’ve both made the best where possible of this year’s car. For all intents and purposes, this pairing is exactly what we expected to be but without the championship contending cars we expected to be underneath them.\n\nNow that Lewis is leaving, George has a narrow window to really stake his claim to the throne before the Antonelli tidal wave becomes overwhelming. He has to crush Kimi utterly and make him look like he never deserved to be here in the first place.']",2940,1219,0.81,2940,14311,14311,53,12,0.0,53

I struggled a bit at the start with the pace, but after a test at Spa they saw a clear step forward and they were convinced. I have a good relationship with George, he hasn\'t given me much advice, but for now, it\'s all good. Next year, I want to beat him,"" said Antonelli in an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\nAntonelli and Russell will enter 2025 with some doubts about what might happen at Mercedes in the medium to long term. Toto Wolff continues to make no secret of his desire to sign Max Verstappen and despite his repeated assurances that he has confidence in his two talents, the weight of an arguably four-time world champion may tip the balance in his favour.\n\nAlthough in the event of Verstappen\'s arrival Antonelli\'s future is less in jeopardy, the Italian cannot afford to fall too far behind Russell in order to avoid sowing uncertainty about his prospects. It will be an important year for him, in which he will have the pressure of racing a top level car and at the same time, the pressure of facing a tremendously fast teammate without a contract for 2026.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)', ""Just in: Antonelli's second f1 goal is beating everyone else"", 'first goal: complete a session without crashing', 'Good goal.\n\nI mean, that’s pretty standard for every new teammate that comes into a team.', 'I like antonelli lets see how long it lasts', 'First George, and then (dramatic pause) ...

Keke Rosberg (and teammate Jacques Laffite) famously wore water-cooled skull caps designed by Bill Elkins underneath their helmets at the sweltering 1984 Dallas Grand Prix. Rosberg went on to win that race despite having a recalcitrant car, which has often been attributed to his being able to stay cool in the extreme temperatures.\n\nIndycar also gives drivers the option of running an actively cooled driving suit at certain races, particularly on long ovals.\n\nIt'll be the first time there'll actually be specific provision for such a device in the F1 regs though. Probably long overdue, but a good step forward given what we saw in Qatar last year"", 'It moves heat from a hot region to a cold region', 'So we try and not cook our drivers ? I have a feeling that the w16 will be disappointed about that... \n\nBut I honestly think that this is a pure positive thing and a well overdue regulation.', 'This is not F1 exclusive. SO many other racing series use “cool shirts” that pump fluid around a capillary system in the shirt.', 'So glad to see they are focusing on cooling suits instead of trying to make a fuckin air conditioner', "">The system tested in Mexico therefore involved a block of ice providing a heat exchange to fluid that was sent to a vest in the driver’s overalls via a piping system, with the cooled liquid then pumped around the vest.\n\nIf I am understanding this correctly, drivers would wear the vest where cooled liquid is pumped? Good to hear that they are also considering to raise the weight limit to accommodate the cooling system into the adjustments. I wonder if they will make it mandatory to wear during specific weather or anybody could wear it at any time *(given Mercedes' overheating issue, it seems like the heat comes on for them even in overall weather conditions that are not necessarily the worst in comparison, so I am trying to figure out how it works, especially for them)*\n\nThe previous idea of an AC unit in the car in of itself does seem rather tacky, but given the introduction of this cooling system, I would argue that I don't think drivers, whom are highly trained athletes, should be close to passing out in high temperatures, especially with what we saw in Qatar 2023 and Singapore 2024.
