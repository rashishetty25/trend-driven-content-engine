Sprints are also excluded - this affects Hulkenberg (6th Austria 23 sprint) Zhou (9th in China 24 Sprint) Ricciardo, Gasly, Sargeant (4th, 9th, 10th Miami 24 Sprint). Sprints are excluded because again, consistency of measurement towards all the previous formats.

Only races where the driver started are included - a WD does not break the streak, or count towards it, so Sargeant in Australia 24 didn‚Äôt make his stint an extra race longer, but also didn‚Äôt stop the streak.

Additionally, if the streak is equalled by another of the same length, the most recent is used (this only affects Sainz, who had another 6 race stint from Canada 2015).

Non rookies who had their longest streak during the most recent season are:

* Stroll (ongoing)
* Bottas (ongoing)
* Hulkenberg (Ended in Saudi)
* Albon (Ended in Monaco)
* Gasly (Ended in Monaco)
* Ricciardo (Ended in Canada)
* Zhou (Ended in Qatar)

Drivers with 1+ full season on the grid who had their longest streak occur partially during their rookie season are:

* Verstappen
* Ocon 
* Sargeant
* Piastri
* Leclerc
* Russell (his first points were for Mercedes in 2020 Sakhir, and he has the honour of being 3rd on the list of most races before scoring points).

Plus obviously the 2024 rookies! This was fairly interesting to me as I assumed most streaks would be in the poorer cars rookies typically end up in.

If you haven‚Äôt been following it, I‚Äôd love to know why. If you‚Äôre curious but haven‚Äôt jumped on board yet, what‚Äôs holding you back?

I‚Äôm working on a university project about how to spark more interest in this exciting feeder series to Formula 1, so your insights would be super helpful. What ideas or topics do you think would encourage more fans to discover and follow F2? Let me know your thoughts!

You'll be surprised to see how much the qualifying order can differ from the racing order sometimes.  \n\nI don't really keep up with F3 well due to the lack of time on my end. And I don't really watch so much of F2 and F1A; just the couple of odd races here and there, with some highlights to top it all off. I do wish that initiatives are taken to improve car models and quality of parts that goes into the car. Some of them can really be of low quality until it disadvantages the driver\n\nAlso, Mecachrome."", 'I watch F2, F3 and sometimes FRECA and italian F4.
