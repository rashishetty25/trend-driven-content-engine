1ij26ge,Did 1990 (or the era approx) mark the end of Formula One as it was known at the time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ij26ge/did_1990_or_the_era_approx_mark_the_end_of/,2025-02-06, Discussion,"A few months back I finished watching the seasons from 1992 through 2003, essentially completing the Schumacher era through to when I actually started watching F1 in 2004. I had some thoughts on that here, some of which I have wavered on through further analysis since: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/WgE30i5xEI

I have also watched back the 1990 and 1991 since making that thread, and I have to say I was very surprised by how different the sport felt in those years compared to those immediately after. 

It could be argued that the time around 1990 represents something of a high watermark for F1. The field as a whole was far less competitive than it is now, with the gaps from the front to the midfield and the front to the back being far bigger than they are today. However, the races were generally far less predictable in spite of that. Who saw Leyton House coming at the French GP? Who knew there would be a Benetton one-two and Aguri Suzuki podium in Japan? Who knew Jean Alesi would have Tyrrell in contention at certain races?

I would contend that the time around 1990 saw the sport begin to transform into what it is today. The cars first took on the same basic shape of today and innovations like the semi-automatic gearbox, driver aids and active suspension had in some cases been seen before, but really took over the sport in the years including and immediately after 89. This made the sport feel technology-driven and computerised in a way that much more closely resembles today than anything that had come before it. This can also be said of race strategies; 1990 feels like the last year where the majority of races saw certain teams steadfastly committed to not making a tyre stop even if it was obvious they should, with Benetton not making stops because they were best equipped to go without them and Williams seemingly much more scared than other teams of the potential pitfalls. By the end of 1991, race strategies began to become more uniform and much more similar to today than they had been even immediately before.

Also in 1990 we had a very strong talent pool with four great champions (I am starting to wonder if maybe Piquet and Mansell were overrated, but I’d never have questioned their greatness without a deeper dive) and several other accomplished drivers who had mostly come into the sport through streamlined processes that were propped up by big backers of the sport like Marlboro and Elf. Afterwards, several drivers - Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve, Eddie Irvine and even the likes of Kimi Raikkonen and Juan Pablo Montoya later on - took some highly unconventional routes into F1. I would argue this partially explains why the bulk of the 1990s saw a very weak pool of talent - there was a huge gulf between Schumacher and pretty much everyone else, whereas the 1980s saw several drivers being able to bridge the gap between the GOAT candidates and the occasional race winners. 

The years after 1990 also saw the death of many small garagista teams that had previously been thriving hand-in-hand with the Hondas, Renaults and Ferraris of the world, for whom I would argue the sport has transformed into more and more of a financial black hole since; it is safe to say that ‘win on Sunday, sell on Monday’ really isn’t a thing anymore other than for premium brand manufacturers and even that may be stretching things.

The garagista teams - along with past giants like Lotus and Brabham - were on their knees soon after 1990 and with that we saw an influx of pay drivers like Jean-Denis Deletraz, a shortlived response to the raised barrier to entry and the further raised barrier to success.

Add in the changes to circuits - with 1990 marking a farewell to the original fast Silverstone as well as the short Paul Ricard, and future years seeing the sport react to the events of Imola 1994 - and I would argue that by approximately 1996, the sport much more closely resembled the sport of today than the one of 1986. 

Obviously, there is a degree of hyperbole here as the sport saw significant changes after 1996 - for example, the Tilkefication of circuits largely took place in the early 2000s as a response to Greg Moore’s fatal crash in the 1999 Fontana CART race, and lap records at traditional circuits continued to tumble until approximately 2004. From that point I would argue the sport has only ever been able to be a version of the pinnacle of motorsport due to rising costs, the need to reign in excellence for the good of entertainment, the demand for environmental sustainability and the standardisation and homologation of specs and parts. 

It is also possible my opinions here are subliminally influenced by technological advancements throughout the world at the time, with race broadcasts arguably being the main beneficiary of this. The graphics introduced in 1994 made events so much easier to follow than anything from before and this is probably the context in which it is most true that F1 circa 1996 resembled today more closely than it did the decade prior.

It may also be worth noting the years after 1990 did not see the sport’s biggest sea change - that honour would probably go to the years immediately following 1967 due to sponsors, wings and the sea of political changes particularly regarding driver power increasing at the expense of circuit promoters.

All-in-all though, I can massively empathise (albeit not quite agree) with the rose-tinted perspective from which fans and observers view the era approx 1990. A lot of changes and the loss of a wild-west nature of sorts really feels like it can be traced back to that year or era. Am I onto something here? Am I making a degree of sense but being a little too hyperbolic? Or am I being completely crazy?","['At the time, no one noticed a turning point change. That’s only visible through time. You have the full history to analyze. Back then no one knew what the future would bring, thus changes were gradual. Basically, the boiled frog effect.', 'For me, the Williams with the active suspension and the transition to high nose cars was the changeover.\xa0\n\n\nBefore that they were flat bottomed slot cars with absurd horsepower wrestling the cars around the track.\xa0', 'I can\'t comment on how it was as a fan at the time as I wasn\'t alive, but going back and watching the old seasons there\'s a definite vibe shift around that period. However, I think it was more of a gradual change happening over nearly a decade than a single year thing.\n\nI think it started around 1986 with the retirement of more old school drivers like Lauda and Rosberg. \n\nThen in 1987 you had Bernie Ecclestone getting full commercial control over the sport by setting up what\'s now known as FOM, and finally burying the hatchet with FISA / the FIA which was a pretty huge deal. You also had the start of turbos being phased out with the introduction of the boost restrictor valves, which eventually led into their total ban in \'89. Again, that was a pretty seismic change.\n\nI\'d say the process of transitioning over to what I\'d consider ""modern"" F1 finished in around 1994. You get the new graphics package like you mentioned which completely changed how you follow races, and also had the passing of a driver who was truly a talisman of his era in Senna.', 'I think there were a few things going on that didn\'t all happen for the same time or the same reasons.\n\nThe Concorde Agreement had regularized F1 and thrown out privateers in 1981 (basically the start of the shift to ""modern F1"". The garagistes had been in trouble for a while in 1990. They had been actually competitive in the DFV era, but with budgets rising and expensive works turbo engines required in the 80s it became much harder.   \n  \nThe FIA started encouraging teams to join with cheaper 3.5 liter DFV-derived engines in 1987. At the time F3000 had 3.0L engines and free chassis competition, so the leap for F3000 teams to join F1 was not very big. The low-budget teams rushed in from 1987 and peaked in 1989 with almost 40 cars at some races. They mostly folded in a few years as anyone who couldn\'t get big sponsors, works engine deals, and high-tech driver aids couldn\'t compete. The field shrank down to only 20 cars by the end of 1996. Despite plenty of lucky podiums for smaller teams, the front of the pack separated itself during the turbo era and couldn\'t be caught. Over twelve seasons 1984-1995 only four teams won 94% of races, and every driver/constructor champion from 1983-2008 had a works engine!  \n  \nIt wasn\'t really until the 2000s that the car manufacturers muscled in. That change was very rapid--in 1999, Ferrari was the only one, but by 2006 the top six teams were five carmakers and McLaren, which was 40% owned by Mercedes. Along with the expansion of the calendar and new Tilkedromes built all over Asia and the Middle East, that\'s what marks the transition into our current F1 era.', 'Basically, the world of F1 changed almost overnight on May 1st, 1994. I guess if you would have been around back then, you would have known but that black weekend changed everything.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994\\_San\\_Marino\\_Grand\\_Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_San_Marino_Grand_Prix)\n\nEdit: Added Wikipedia link', 'The shift to aero and away from mechanical grip accelerated in the 90s and I think with it the randomness you speak of disappeared. That coupled with cost control has led to greater standardisation and therefore much lower failure rates in components.\n\nAll that combined has resulted in aero concepts that are nearly Boolean across a season, but the random failure rates of old are gone. \n\nAlso I think the journey to F1 now is on rails, and as such the gap between the top and the bottom is closer meaning most cars are having the maximum extracted of them evenly, whereas in the early 90s the delta between top and bottom drivers was much greater and led to things like Alesi in the Tyrrell.', ""Thinking esp. about backmarkers, they got barely any coverage in the early 90s. Maybe partly because there were so many of them, but overall people couldn't care less how a Dallara or a Larrousse finished. That definitely changed in the late 90s, when only 22 cars were on the grid and all the low-effort teams had disappeared. The level of quality (or professionality) across the grid has vastly improved and the gaps between front and back got a lot closer."", ""There's a lot of comments about aero in here, but I don't agree with them. The shift to aero grip didn't start in the 1990s; it started from the moment that the wing cars first appeared, and became even more marked with the advent of ground effect. It then did have a bit of a lull after ground effect was outlawed and then the turbo era put a new emphasis on raw power, but that was only a temporary blip.\n\nLikewise, it's easy to be nostalgic for that period, but the hard cold reality was quite different. Teams would pop up and go bust on a regular basis; drivers were getting killed or badly injured on a regular basis; and Balestre was even more nakedly corrupt than MBS. Whilst some modern tracks aren't great, there were still plenty of tracks that were never suitable for F1 that popped up as well - Caesar's Palace, Dallas and Detroit just to name three."", ""I would like to add two things that also changed throughout the 90's. \n\nThe first is that the drivers became full time athletes, especially with the arrival of Schumacher. It became obvious that you had to put in proper training in order to handle the cars and you couldn't just be a part-time driver, part-time playboy and still be successful.  \n\nThe second change is that safety became the norm. There was a gradual shift in the feeling of safety, in the sense that you didn't expect drivers to get severely hurt during crashes anymore. Death disappeared as a *feeling* from the sport. There was almost a blasé attitude about the fact that a driver may die driving a car, but by the early 00's it was the opposite. The cars were supposed to be safe and a driver was not supposed to die while driving it. This had started earlier with the efforts from Jackie Stewart,  but it wasn't until after 94 that safety sort of overtook speed and entertainment in terms of importance. This was even more pronounced at NASCAR. They had always been draconian when it came to safety, and then 5 drivers at multiple NASCAR levels died from the same injury in less than 2 years, so they were basically forced to change things.""]",101,46,0.81,101,42,42,6,1,0.0,6

Significantly better than Bahrain, anyway.\n\nI think I'd quite like Japan as a season opener, but I am exceptionally biased because Suzuka is my favourite track."", "">Does the season open here for historical/ sentimental reasons?\xa0\xa0\n\n\nThis year the season only opens in Australia because the timing of Ramadan makes it impossible to hold it in Bahrain or Saudi Arabia. Until Covid it was the traditional opener since 1996. I think it is/was a good season opener for multiple reasons:\n\n\n1. Logistically, it makes sense to have the first race season at the track that's the furthest away from where teams are located. Since pre-season testing takes place more than 2 weeks before the first race, teams have enough time to travel and get used to the jetlag. That way the longest flight is done with and personnel don't have to worry about a near 24-hour flight later in the season.\xa0\n\n\n2. It fits the attempt to regionalize the calendar for sustainability purposes and the weather isn't too hot or too cold at that time of year. It's also good to have it paired with the races in China and Japan as it gives people from Asia and Oceania multiple opportunities to attend an F1 race in March/April. The only other race close-by is Singapore in September but the prices can be prohibitive. Then the closest races are Bahrain, Saudi, Brazil and Vegas which are all 18h or so away by plane (if you can get a direct flight that is).\xa0\n\n\n3. The only knock against Melbourne as a season opener is that historically the racing hasn't always been great there, which is why the FIA has been fiddling with the DRS zones recently in order to increase overtaking opportunities. There has been a few times where the race has felt like a high-speed Monaco. Melbourne is one of the few true outliers on the calendar as Albert Park is one of the tracks that has the lowest tyre degradation of the entire calendar. The asphalt is extremely smooth and the moderate temperatures help mask some issues that a car can have. As a result the race is almost always a one-stop, track position is key and creating a significant tyre offset is impossible.\xa0\n\n\nThere is entertainment though, it just isn't provided by the racing but rather by crashes, reliability issues and pit stop errors, probably due to the teams having the shake the dust off. The reliability argument would be true for any season opener, but Melbourne is tough on the cars and the engines with a lot of time being spent at full throttle and a lot of kerb-riding required.\xa0\n\n\n>Interested in opinions on best track / location for a big season opener.\xa0\n\n\nThere aren't a lot of tracks that tick all the boxes, meaning provide good racing and make sense geographically (not too far away from the following races). Bahrain is as good as it gets for that.\xa0The main issue is that pre-season testing also takes place there now so teams already have a lot of track data for the race, which removes some unpredictability and unpredictability as we know makes for good races. Jeddah could be a fun opener but with the track layout there's always a risk of incidents, even more so if the drivers are a bit rusty"", 'Personally, I prefer Bahrain because the track is great, and for Americans, especially on the east coast, the Aus GP starts at 1AM, contrast Bahrain at like 10AM LOL. Its gonna stink to start the f1 season with 3 extremely early races 🥲', 'Australia for the atmosphere, and for us Europeans the excitement of getting up early for the first race of the season!', ""For some of us, it's one of only 2 or 3 races that happen at a reasonable hour, allowing us to share the event with less keen family members...\n\nNo way I can get my wife or kids interested in getting up at 2am (Monday morning )to see if they might like something....\n\nAnd the Aussie race is usually a good one...\n\nGreat place to start the season..."", ""But then you don't have it to look forward to."", '> “high speed Monaco”\n\nYep, that’s a way to put it.
