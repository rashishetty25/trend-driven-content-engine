1i9ojre,The FIA swearing ban is mentally insane.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i9ojre/the_fia_swearing_ban_is_mentally_insane/,2025-01-25, Discussion,"What on Earth was MBS thinking when he drew up those rules? Penalty for friggin swearing? Race ban threats? Thousands of Euros in fines?

I think this is too much. Almost every F1 driver swears, and these new rules are a recipe for disaster, both in F1 and in other FIA series.

The average accrued penalty points by the end of the first season of these rules will be worse than Lord Mahaveer's F2 season.

And not just that, it's in the Motorsport Code, meaning it won't just be F1 that's affected; F2, F3, FE, WEC, it will apply to anything FIA-regulated.

How long until an F1 race has as many starters as Monaco '96 had finishers? How long until an LMP2 driver wins the 24 Hours of Le Mans because most of everyone in the Hypercars said a bad word?

These new rules are a powder keg. I can only hope they'll be taken out.","[""All of the F1 drivers should get together every GP and swear like sailors. \n\nLet's see the FIA ban all 20 drivers."", ""He's an insecure petty little dictator.

•	⁠**3** rookies,

•	⁠**13** drivers staying with their team,

•	⁠**3** drivers changing teams,

•	⁠**1** driver coming back after a break from F1.

Other key numbers:

•	⁠**19** drivers started the 2024 season in the same seat they started 2023 (and the whole grid started in the seat they finished the 2023 season in),

•	⁠**8** drivers started the 2019 season in the same seat they finished 2018 with,

•	⁠Lewis Hamilton drove **12** seasons with Mercedes while at the end of 2025, Max Verstappen will have been with Red Bull for **9.5** seasons,

1i9usun,The Greatest Motorsport Driver In F1 History-Jim Clark,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i9usun/the_greatest_motorsport_driver_in_f1_historyjim/,2025-01-25, Discussion,"James Clark (4 March 1936 – 7 April 1968) was a British racing driver from Scotland, who competed in Formula One from 1960 to 1968. Clark won two Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles with Lotus, and—at the time of his death—held the records for most wins (25), pole positions (33), and fastest laps (28), among others. In American open-wheel racing, Clark won the Indianapolis 500 in 1965 with Lotus, becoming the first non-American winner of the race in 49 years.
Born in Fife and raised in the Scottish Borders, Clark started his racing career in road rallying and hillclimbing. By 1958, Clark had graduated to sports car racing in national competition with Border Reivers, racing the Jaguar D-Type and Porsche 356, where he attracted the attention of Lotus founder Colin Chapman. Driving a Lotus Elite, Clark finished second-in-class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1959. Clark made his formula racing debut the following year in Formula Junior, winning the championship ahead of reigning seven-time Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champion John Surtees. After immediately impressing in Formula Two, Clark was promoted to Formula One with Lotus for the remainder of the 1960 season alongside Surtees and Innes Ireland, making his debut at the Dutch Grand Prix and scoring his maiden podium four races later in Portugal; Clark finished third overall at Le Mans that year.

Following multiple further podiums in 1961, Lotus fielded the highly-successful 25 chassis from 1962 onwards. Clark took his maiden win at the 1962 Belgian Grand Prix, achieving further wins at his home Grand Prix in Great Britain and in the United States, as he finished runner-up to career rival Graham Hill. After winning a then-record seven Grands Prix during his 1963 campaign, Clark won his maiden title, earning widespread acclaim for his dominant performances. Despite winning the most races the following season, reliability issues with the Lotus 33 saw him fall to third in the standings. However, the chassis would excel in the hands of Clark in 1965, as he took six victories in another record-breaking season. Lotus then struggled to adapt to the 3-litre engine era, with Clark only able to win the United States Grand Prix during his second title defence. 1967 was far more successful for Lotus under Cosworth power, with Clark taking four wins throughout the season but again let down by poor reliability.

While leading the 1968 World Drivers' Championship, Clark died as a result of an accident during a Formula Two race at the Hockenheimring. Clark held the Formula One records for the most race wins until 1973, pole positions until 1989, and fastest laps also until 1989. He still holds several records in 2024, including the most grand slams (8). A versatile driver, Clark found immense success outside of formula racing in sports cars, touring cars, and American open-wheel racing. Clark was a champion in the British Saloon Car Championship, winning every race he entered in 1964, as well as in French and British Formula Two. He was a three-time champion of the Tasman Series, winning in 1965, 1967 and 1968, with a record 15 wins in 32 starts. In rallying, he entered the Rally of Great Britain in 1966. His successes in 1965—winning championships in Formula One, the Tasman Series, French Formula Two, and British Formula Two—make him the only driver in history to have won multiple championships in a single season alongside a World Drivers' Championship.

Why did the Marshalls help this car but not the other etc.', ""They used to allow it if a car was considered to be in a dangerous position. \n\nIt just led to a massive amount of grey area though, where sometimes drivers would be allowed to continue after receiving a push / other assistance, but other times drivers in similar situations would get disqualified. It made it a bit of a lottery every time a driver skidded off or something as to whether they'd be able to resume.\n\nIn the end they just decided no assistance at all would be allowed for clarity as much as anything I think."", ""Safety and it's just part of the rules. Without having to go too deep into it."", 'Has nothing to do with safety. Have to get the car anyways, so safety is the same whether you DQ the car or not. \n\nDifference is a European style of racing where if your car stops and can’t get going on its own, you’re done.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Wouldn’t it be brilliant to see a team try to make a no stop work? Or tear around on softs only but make 3 stops? I’d love to know what you think!', 'since it is offseason and i am bored i was just thinking\n\nWhat if Max announced suddenly that he is going to mercedes next year, would you be surprised and what potential of sillyness can this cause?', 'has a driver ever won/clinched the championship in their home race? i cant find any info on this', ""Why did Prost spend 4 years in the lower formulas? His success in '76 and '77 was phenomenal, yet he didn't get an F1 seat until 1980. The only series he did poorly in was European F3 in 1978. Bounced back quite well in 1979 though. One would think there would have been offers galore during this period."", 'Did Daniel Ricciardo have a legit claim at being the best driver on the grid in one of those 4 seasons :\n\n- 2014\n\n- 2016\n\n- 2017\n\n- 2020\n\n?', 'Why on gods green earth does F1 still work with the FIA instead of developing and implementing its own governing body?', 'New to F1, military veteran.
