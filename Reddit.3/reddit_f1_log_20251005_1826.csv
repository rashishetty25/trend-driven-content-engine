It made me think about what this actually means for racing.

2026 F1 cars will have a 9 MJ battery powering a 350 kW electric motor, but the battery can’t be fully recharged every lap even with all the energy recovered during braking.

Even top tracks with strong braking zones only give back about 7-8 MJ to the battery, less than what the 9 MJ pack needs. Drivers can’t rely on using maximum electric power all the time without draining the battery.

On long straights, the battery drains quickly and regen can’t keep up. Teams will have to manage energy carefully and save electric power for key parts of the lap instead of using it continuously.

This limitation makes the new hybrid systems more strategic in racing, when and how you use electric power could decide battles and lap times.

Will this energy management create more strategy and uncertainty, or just become standard race management?","['Even as it is, it takes a lap to build up to have a shot at overtaking every 2nd lap. This will make it every 3rd.', ""They obviously won't deploy maximum power all the time and will have to get used to managing when they want to use all the power they have and when they don't.   \n\nOne thing that interests me more is if the massive amount of electric torque available now makes the motor mapping a sort of back-door traction control, or if the FIA has already thought around it."", 'In theory it will be a fun variable to the racing. On any given lap, two cars battling for position will have different amounts of horsepower available.', 'Not sure I understand this correctly, but the battery delta SOC should be 4MJ whilst the energy recovery limit is at most 9MJ, usually 8.5MJ.\n\nIt could indeed be challenging to recover enough energy under braking, they will likely burn some fuel for that as well. There are also a number of regulatory deployment limitations to manage the battery around the lap. things like limits to how much power they can deploy at what speeds, how fast they can reduce that power and how much they can recharge under full throttle.', ""It'll be like Top Gear. Where you have to save the nitro boost for the best parts of the track."", 'they will be using the mgu-k to generate on throttle too - possibly out of corners for TC of sorts but mostly towards the end of straights like the mgu-h does already - some tracks they will definitely not have enough fuel to do this every lap though.', 'Drivers will need to relearn how to drive with this PU regulation.\n\nNo more full throttle all the time, instead they’ll have to manage power across an entire lap to get it right. In a way it will be interesting to see who can adjust best to this new reg change.', 'there will probably be a lot of clipping', 'ferrari practicing lift and cost this year to be ready for next year :3', 'It means using the battery to defend will only work on 1 lap, which tbh will make the racing much better. Overtakes will take a little more strategy, but now if you are quicker you will be able to overtake on pure power on a straight instead of getting stuck behind someone using the battery on every straight']",110,45,0.88,110,44,44,40,16,0.020000000000000018,40

1nyqe45,"Is it just me, or has this F1 season has been painfully predictable?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nyqe45/is_it_just_me_or_has_this_f1_season_has_been/,2025-10-05, Discussion,"I’ve been watching F1 religiously for years, and I can’t shake the feeling that this season is one of the dullest in recent memory. Qualifying sessions are still thrilling—especially Q3 shootouts where drivers push the limits—but once Sunday rolls around, the excitement fizzles out almost immediately.

The races are often decided in the first 2–3 corners of lap 1. If someone nails the start and defends well through Turn 1 and Turn 2, that’s usually game over unless a safety car shakes things up. And even then, the drama feels manufactured rather than organic. The midfield battles are decent, but that's about it.

Strategy used to be a wildcard—undercuts, tire gambles, late stops—but now even the undercut barely works. Either the tires don’t degrade fast enough, or the pit delta is too punishing. Teams seem locked into one-stop strategies, and the window for creative calls has shrunk to almost nothing. 

DRS trains are back in full force, and unless someone has a massive pace advantage, overtaking is a formality or a non-event.

I’m not saying every race needs to be chaos, but where’s the tension? Where’s the unpredictability? Even dominant seasons in the past had moments of brilliance—weather changes, bold moves, surprise podiums (I know this is after Russel's podium, but let's look at the whole season ). This year feels like a procession with occasional sparks.

Anyone else feeling this? Is it the regulations, the tire compounds, or just a weird lull in competitiveness? I’d love to hear if others are seeing the same pattern—or if I’m just becoming a grumpy fan nostalgic for the chaos of the early 2010s.","[""It's definitely been noticed. A few reasons why the races are predictable:\n\n\\- The cars are extremely close together in raw performance, so the delta's required for overtaking aren't being met\n\n\\-The 2025 tyres are the most durable tyres Pirelli have made since the 2017 ones. As such, most races are easy 1 stoppers\n\n\\- Reliability failures are minimal so no in race drama"", '\nOh, you predicted Hulk and Isaack podiums? So predictable', 'No way you predicted Hulk, Kimi, and Hadjar podiums!!', ""Can't be more predictable than 2023"", ""Convergence in car performance (because we're in the final year of the regulations), very durable tyre compounds (which teams and spectators both have been asking for for *years*) and the winningest team micromanaging any life out of the title battle will do that. It's a bit of a perfect storm of things all coming together to make this season incredibly fucking boring."", 'On track action is horrendous. People are saying ""oooh so you saw xxx getting a podium coming huh?"" are missing the point. If those are the shining moments of the season that people choose to highlight, and not memorable on-track battles, that is a sign of the problem, people are remembering the results sheet rather than the racing.\n\nThe main draw this season is a wet biscuit title fight between 2 drivers under supervision from their parents, with an occasional ""but mooom he did it first!"" type complaint. I can almost hear the ""so nkw you complain when there is a title fight?"" reply, and the answer to that is: it is the only thing left to watch this season.
