But once again the race yesterday saw basically no variance in tyre strategy 


Most cars put the (M) tyre on around lap 13. 


By lap 20 
- Piastri 1:46:7
- max 1:46:8

Refueling added so much dynamics to races as you could undercut heavily since less fuel also meant shorter pit stops.\n\n\nNow the difference between the slowest pit and the fastest is what, 1s? This makes it just so hard to use pits and number of stops as a viable strategy', 'cold weather helped pilots keep those tyres usable last so long, only cars with excessive load were chewing through them.', ""Tyre management.

That‚Äôs what ruined it. \n\nIn essence a super slow paced Medium was faster than a pushed Hard which was faster than a pushed Medium-Medium.', 'Track resurfacing also had an impact. Similar to Suzuka', ""The ones on medium tyres were all managing them to last long. At first they couldn't push too hard because the track was still drying and any mistakes would've been costly. When Lando put on the hard tyres, committed to one stop, rejoined the track in P2, the ones behind him were forced to manage the tyres. They would have to overtake him, build a substantial gap before pitting again, or have to overtake him twice. Both were impossible as the track wasn't dry enough to go all aggressive soon after the first pitstop, and the mclaren being quite fast. Piastri had the option, but chose to manage and keep track position in case there was gonna be a safety car.

Racing is rarely done in the rain anymore primarily due to extremely poor visibility, not because drivers can't control the cars. Modern tires and diffusers create a massive amount of spray, making it impossible for drivers to see other cars, even at close distances and high speeds. This lack of visibility significantly increases the risk of severe accidents. While drivers like Carlos Sainz enjoy the challenge of driving in the rain, the safety concerns related to visibility with multiple cars on the track are the main reason for the reduced frequency of rain races.

Team is operating on a really strong level with much less mistakes than last year. They‚Äôre handling inter team battle really well (but considering other teams are realistically out of the fight it‚Äôs probably easier) Both drivers are showing great level of driving with Oscar having a slight edge in consistency over Lando. But even with slight mistakes Lando makes, he‚Äôs still keeping himself in a Fight.\n\n**Max Verstappen**\n\nProbably the only bright spot of the Team this year so far. He‚Äôs always ready to pounce and grab the win when the opportunity arrives. Really can‚Äôt ask anything more from a driver and Max this season is the only thing keeping mclaren drivers on their toes.\n\n**Williams and Albon**\n\nWilliams delivered on a huge growth this year, definitely a positive step in the right direction and mostly thanks to incredible consistency from Alex. Everyone doubted him, and put him under a lot of pressure with Carlos coming into a team but he handled himself brilliantly. You could say Carlos had a few unlucky ones this year but Alex has him beat handily so far and he showa no signs of stopping.\n\n**Pierre Gasly**\n\nI think it‚Äôs unfair to see how little recognition Pierre gets this year. He‚Äôs driving the wheels of of that Alpine and i genuinely sometimes can‚Äôt believe how he pulls it off. A team that has myriad of problems with management (or should i rather say missmanagement), morale, performance, he‚Äôs still getting regular q3 entries with some outstanding Qualy laps, and some wonderful race drives. He‚Äôs definitely one of top driver performers this year.\n\n**Sauber**\n\nFrom a team that i expected the least, and when i expected them to wait out a Year before transforming into Audi. They surprised me the most. It looks like they really consolidated their management and leadership, nailed a driver pairing and even brought upgrades to the car to be genuinely competetive with other midfielders. It‚Äôs great to see them being rewarded with a podium (And what a podium it was). Both Nico and Gabi had great races.\xa0\n\n**George Russell**\n\nThis is the year where George really visibly stepped up. Lewis leaving mercedes created a big power vacuum, and George took it upon himself to take it. He‚Äôs shown some real stellar drives this year, and barely put a foot wrong so far this year. He‚Äôs finally showing his true potential that he was being called for years. Ultimately he‚Äôs being let down by Mercedes and a car they delivered him (much like Leclerc).\n\n\n**Charles Leclerc**\n\nThere‚Äôs really not much more a team can ask from their driver. Charles is doing absolute maximum Ferrari is able to do. He‚Äôs consistent, his racecraft is wonderful, tyre management is great, Charles is having a stellar driving season so far and is being let down by the car that simpy doesn‚Äôt have the pace to be competetive for the wins. He really continued on his driving form from last season in the best possible way, and it‚Äôs a real shame he cannot crown it with wins.\n\nNeutrals\n\n** Racing bulls**\n\nI was thinking, is it really fair not to put them in the positives column, they had some stellar drives, bunch of points, and Hadjar really impressed with some great drives as a Rookie. It‚Äôs true but whole driver seat drama in RB family, really leaves bad taste. They started the season strong with both Yuki and Hadjar, then when the swap happened lawson had a lot of issues, but in the end he‚Äôs also slowly regaining confidence and driving better. Strategy wise they‚Äôre still the biggest clowns of the field and that is the only reason why i‚Äôm not rating them positively.\n\n**HAAS**\n\nHaas this year might be the definition of neutral. While they had some great drives from both drivers and the pairing seems to work really well, they are really showing no signs of some great improvement and growth. They are always in the mix to score some points but also can be nowhere near them.\n\n\n**Lewis Hamilton**\n\n\nTransition to the red team has been really painful for Lewis. I cannot say he disappointed because it would be unfair, he had few stellar drives but mostly he was average at best. The car doesn‚Äôt suit him and it‚Äôs painfully obvious. Charles has and edge on him but i think that was also expected. Overall, pacewise i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs even that far from Charles. And i genuinely think that Carlos wouldn‚Äôt be better than Lewis this year in Ferrari even though he‚Äôd have a lot more experience with red cars.

1mbcjy4,"On racing, and danger",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mbcjy4/on_racing_and_danger/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"CW: talks about death

There has been a big discussion lately on whether the 2025 Belgium Grand Prix should have started under wet conditions or not.

There is worthwhile discussion to be had around this issue, it ultimately boils down to some people will have higher risk tolerances, and some will have lower tolerances. Discourse seems unlikely to change that.

So this is not a post about whether the race should have started sooner or not.

This post is instead about addressing a sentiment that has been surprisingly common in this community.

You have surely seen comments such as these (these are all real comments from the last 24h, I don't want to strawman here): 

- Humans enjoy watching others risk their lives for their own entertainment. We used to have duels to death for millenniums. 

- I dunno, I preferred the sport when it was more about the spectacle than safety. 

- Motorsport is and always will be dangerous. It should be, that's part of the thrill. 

- As much as I don‚Äôt want anyone to get hurt (I definitely don‚Äôt) the risks and accidents make f1 exciting. 

- I want the mess and the crashes.

These comments are arguing (with, it must be said, a variable amount of hinges) that risk, danger, spectacle, are something that enhances formula 1, racing in general. 

It's a compelling sentiment, but I want to argue how it is not necessarily true, and later I'll provide an alternative viewpoint that will hopefully give you a different perspective on danger and racing.

Crashes and danger add to the thrill:
I was at Spa in 2019. The danger of racing was on full display. There was a big crash, a red flag. People left the circuit not knowing what was going on. Thrilling and exciting are NOT words I would use to describe the mood. There was horror, there was shock, there was anxiety. There were people retching on the side of the road while waiting for their shuttles. We later found out that Anthoine Hubert had died in that crash. He was 22 years old. 

About a year later Romain Grosjean went into the barriers at Bahrain. The fireball was surely spectacular. Do you remember how you felt at that moment? Would you describe the feeling as exciting? I bet you weren't thinking ""Now that's why I tune in to F1"".

""Danger makes F1 exciting"" is a compelling sentiment, but ultimately a very shielded one. A sentiment that is privileged enough to not have been face-to-face with the consequences of said danger. 

A better alternative:

So, we like the danger, but not it's consequences.
That makes F1... a rollercoaster. You go on a rollercoaster because of big thrills. You want to FEEL danger, without actually being exposed to it. No one wants their rollercoaster to actually BE dangerous - ""I heard they really skimped out on the maintenance on this one!"". 

So feel free to argue about the FIA's decision. But please remember:

We are here for the racing, not the danger. You don't actually like the danger, you like the idea of it.

That's all I have to say, please refrain from turning this thread into another discussion on what should have been done yesterday. I think I made it clear, this is meant as a criticism of the ""Danger is exciting"" sentiment.

PS. There is a bit of a tone shift when I talk about Hubert's crash. I wrote that section last, after I had already made the light jokes about rollercoasters and so on. If that comes across as disrespectful, or insensitive I can only apologise.

","['There should be jeopardy, but not danger.\n\nCrashing is part of the sport and is a neccesary part of the sport as it is what seperated the good from the great, it is what penalises mistakes in an effective way. Racing is risk and reward. Without the risk of crashing then racing becomes much easier to do and much less interesting to watch, not because we like seeing crashes, but we like to see drivers being brave and doing incredible things.\n\nHowever what the drivers should be risking is finishing the race, or losing time, not injuries and death.', 'I think you‚Äôre putting words in the mouths of many who are simply suggesting (right or wrong) that the race could have run safely and the full wet tires weren‚Äôt even used when the race started.\xa0\n\nIn years past, we would see the skill of the drivers in the rain, which really allows spectators to see just how amazing they are. Granted they‚Äôre like that on every lap they do, but in the rain it‚Äôs just easier for those, especially watching a broadcast, to see their skills.\xa0\n\nIf this was a perfect storm (no pun intended) because Spa is very high speed, has had a recent death, and visibility with these cars especially is a challenge, then so be it, and perhaps it was the best call to make.\xa0\n\nBut to suggest that people asking for the race to have started earlier is because there would be a greater element of danger is disingenuous to many. Many viewers simply enjoy seeing the impressive skills in true wet conditions, and it‚Äôs got everything to do with keeping the car on the track and pointing straight, and nothing to do with the idea of danger and devastating crashes.\xa0', 'yes, the ""danger is exciting"" sentiment is straight bullshit, and people who genuinely derive excitement from watching people die should get themselves checked into an institution\n\nbut I think that\'s not the main point people are making when it comes to racing in the rain, the main sentiment is ""we should be able to race in these conditions safely, and the FIA really need to sort out their shit to make it happen""\n\nthe fact that with just a bit of a drizzle visibility can get so low that you can barely see the car that\'s ahead of you is a big problem with these ground effect cars, and in 2026 the hope is that the new lower downforce floors and lack of a beam wing will reduce that spray', 'The issue isn‚Äôt safety vs spectacle, the issue is the design of the cars themselves creating far too much spray. We all want to see wet racing, but we simply can‚Äôt race in wet conditions anymore. I can count on one hand the amount of times full wets have been used by the majority of the field', 'When people say danger they generally mean ""it\'s more difficult to drive and it makes the risk of someone wiping out larger, drivers need to be more skilled and careful, which increases excitement"".\n\nNot ""I hope someone dies today"".\n\nAnd there\'s a reason so many of the best races of all time are wet races. Because it\'s the only races that aren\'t decided entirely upon who has the best car.     \nWe knew 2 races in who was going to win close to every single race this year (one of the Mclarens), wet races being the only likely exceptions.', ""You have to remember, this isn't just about the drivers safety, but the safety of the marshals and crowd. \n\nWhen Jules Bianchi hit a JCB after losing control in the wet. It is often forgotten that there was a team of marshals around that car and driving the JCB. They are all very lucky to be alive and could easily have been hit by Bianchi's car. \n\nSure, racing drivers accept that they are taking part in a dangerous sport and are paid millions to do so. \n\nMarshals aren't millionaires. They are mostly volunteers."", 'Hubert and Grojean‚Äôs crashes both happened in the dry. Nobody is asking for gladiators, but if it‚Äôs really about safety, we‚Äôd be racing at 60kph on padded tracks. Most of the horrendous crashes of the 21st century have been in the dry conditions. It‚Äôs a dangerous sport; the drivers know it‚Äôs a dangerous sport, yet they show up anyway. First responders have dangerous jobs, get paid MUCH less, yet still choose the job.', ""Watching a tightrope walker with a safety net and without one are two entirely different experiences.\n\nNo one wants to see the tightrope walker fall but adding a safety net does inherently take \\*something\\* away from the performance, that's just a fact.\n\nLike you, I'm not here to argue either way in the context of F1 but I feel like this whole post feels intentionally obtuse in its refusal to engage with a pretty simple idea."", 'Very well said.']",65,73,0.7,65,68,68,20,11,0.029999999999999916,20

He defended against Verstappen brilliantly, managed his own pace and by all accounts, strategies and external factors worked out wonderfully for him. I think a lot of us has overlooked his ability to do well in the track, as of recently but it is also down to his abilities as a driver on Sunday. When he is locked in, he truly shows where he can put a car like that in. I do lament the SF-25's frankenstein-esque developments and key structures because it has robbed the audience, and arguably the drivers themselves from witnessing the true potential of what they can do with the best car *(first half of 2022)*.

This is easy enough to implement during the race, but if everyone sets off from the grid at the same time it doesn't make any difference from starting under the Safety Car.

My proposal is to send the cars off at 3 or 4 second intervals (longer would be ideal, but the limit will be informed by the lap time under VSC divided by the number of cars, then reduced further to create a margin for error). I'm not sure what the exact procedure would look like, but as an example, the starting lights could alternate extinguishing two lights on each side to indicate the next car on each side can proceed.

Once underway, the cars can circulate to clear the standing water, with enough of a gap between them to avoid the worst of the spray.

1mb1wd2,2024 Sainz vs 2025 Hamilton: It's not really close,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mb1wd2/2024_sainz_vs_2025_hamilton_its_not_really_close/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"Last year Carlos Sainz ended up with 9 podiums for Ferrari. He won Australia and Mexico. And in addition to 7 other podiums for Carlos, he also had 5 5th place finishes and a 4th. 15 top 5 finishes.

Through 13 races last year Seinz had 190 points. Hamilton has 109 (no I didn't transpose the numbers).

And yet you hear very little about Sainz now, struggling along to do the best he can with Williams; he's getting beat there by his own teammate this year, so there's that. Obviously it takes a little time to acclimate to a new environment; a reason that Hamilton OBVIOUSLY is given the benefit of the doubt on, despite last year's results at Mercedes.

Today Sainz's own pit crew screwed him over. And they then decided on a 2 stopper, and it simply didn't go his way today. Hamilton had one of his better races; passing a bunch of guys with his updated equipment and getting up to where he's normally at.

I do not feel that Hamilton is ever a threat to win a race. LeClerc has been consistently outperforming the world champion. It doesn't really feel competitive. Just like last year didn't feel that competitive with George Russell at Mercedes. I feel that, of the 8 seats that make up McClaren, Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, Hamilton is at best 6th, with the jury being out as way too early on Antonelli. Only the 2nd RB seat doesn't compare to Lewis.

In hindsight, the manner in which Sainz was quickly ushered out of Ferrari seems sort of sickening at this point. He's left to one choice, no options. And he's done career wise, unless one of the big three/four invite him to a seat, and obviously Ferrari isn't in the cards for that.

This seems alot different from a driver CHOOSING to leave because he's not the number one driver and wants to go somewhere else to be the big dog, like what happened with Daniel Riccardo, who should probably never have left RedBull. He's the last great 2nd driver they've had in years.

Guys like Sainz and Botas, who was a pretty darn productive driver for Mercedes, they both got the short end. Watching Nico's 3rd place finish a few weeks ago got me really thinking about this. There are some pretty damn good drivers out there, without the equipment to show their talent, left hoping for inclement weather or a miracle for them to have a quality day.

I've always loved Alonso, and have watched his struggle for many years now. About half the time he's ""the best of the rest"". Not this year obviously. But you watch him and you see the talent after all these years, and you cannot help but wonder how he'd do in a number one seat at one of the best places. Like with Sainz.

  
PS: Will Hamilton get a podium this year? It feels like wishful thinking at this point. ","['Don‚Äôt compare year 4 Sainz with year 1 Hamilton, just like you shouldn‚Äôt judge Sainz too harshly for year 1 Williams.

Could you do a similar comparison please?', 'I feel like it‚Äôd be a more fair and interesting comparison if you compared Hamilton this year and Sainz in 2021?

He had a really rough start to the year in quali, but has been much better over recent races. Ok he made errors in both qualis this weekend, but pace wise looked like he was about even with leclerc. GP quali is now 4-3 over the last 7 races in favour of leclerc.\n\n>Hamilton not a race win threat, leclerc consistently outperforming\n\nAgain I don‚Äôt think leclerc has been a race win threat either, but he has been consistently better absolutely.\n\n>Way Sainz ushered out sickening \n\nI mean we should really be evaluating whether ferrari made the right choice racing wise at the end of Lewis‚Äô stint with the team not halfway through the first year. Outside of racing Hamilton obviously makes massively more sense than Sainz. And Ok it‚Äôs tough on sainz, but they‚Äôre also all adults and F1 is tough. Sainz had more time than most F1 drivers to evaluate and weigh up his options.\n\n>good drivers don‚Äôt get to show talent\n\nAbsolutely, unfortunately in F1 really good seats are very rare and opportunities to get in them even rarer. You also have to get in them at the right point in your career. There is lots of drivers who have seemed great in lesser machinery who have failed to thrive in front running machinery. It‚Äôs just unpredictable.\n\n> Hamilton podium wishful thinking?\n\nIt feels pretty likely he will, ferrari is in that kind of range, he was very close last race and perhaps with a bit better luck could have already had one, he‚Äôs also shown in china that under the right conditions he absolutely can stick at the front and hold it there.']",0,125,0.21,0,1007,1007,0,1,0.0,0
