1kfh86y,Oscars Racecraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfh86y/oscars_racecraft/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"Am surprised it isn't talked about more. I think Oscar is the only driver to cleanly pass Max multiple times now, and he makes it look easy. This last race clearly showed the difference between him and Norris, and well everyone else. 


When Oscar made the move it looked like of course, why doesn't everyone just undercut Max when he tries to go deep and push off the track. Of course this is easier said then done. 


Yet, I am constantly impressed at how clean Oscar is. It stands out as Max's overtakes are quite aggressive and messy as he basically challenges contact. I think Raikkonen would be the last guy that I can remember being that good/clean. Yet Oscar just makes it look so easy, hearing Max not having anything to complain about on the team radio except his own car when passed is so different. Than the usual ""he pushed me off track"" etc...","['Oscar is a very confident and cool driver, he doesn’t doubt his decision.

But for sure he is really good"", ""I have to admit I've grew fond of Oscar. He can take it to max the way I've seen only Lewis and Charles do, when they had a car under them.\nI hope he can keep this momentum up through the whole season."", 'One thing to note is this year is the first with the new overtaking rules. Overtaking is very much who can make it to the Apex first without locking up. Before, you were obliged to leave the other car racing room', ""Oscar seems very confident in his ability, he makes very quick decisions and continues to impress me.\n\nHe's 24, and only in his third season. While the McLaren is very good, he is definitely taking advantage of having the best car and is being bold when opportunities come up.\n\nIt's genuinely impressive to watch, him and Kimi are definitely making me excited about the future of the sport on the driver side.\n\nSome of Oscar's passes seem to come out of nowhere, he pulled one on Leclerc last year at Baku, and did one more recently on Hamilton that was just beautiful.\n\nI think he'll only continue to get better and unless the new TD changes things radically, I have to imagine Oscar wins this championship."", 'I feel like People actually doesn’t talk about race craft much except it is dirty. The criticism on race craft is more common than praise either.\n\nOscar is certainly not the only one.

The way he handled getting past Max this race was a perfect example. He's also one of these drivers that I feel uses his racecraft to maximise results especially on Sunday. Both Alonso and Prost are great qualifiers but where they really stood out against their competitors was their racecraft and race vision, as well aa their competotive mentality. 

Piastri has some amazing overtakes just like the ones Fernando pulls off, like his move on Leclerc in Baku, Norris in Monza, Hamilton in Australia and now the move on Max, amongst others (Austria and Spa) He is also very consistent which are the two strengths of Prost and Alonso. Even when they didn't nail the setup that weekend or didn't have the fastest car, they would maximise the result or atleast finish P2 behind their main rival, (e.g Prost vs Senna or Alonso vs Schumacher) Piastri has done this by always qualifying within a tenth of Pole up until this week and always making the best of the situation despite setbacks (recovering in Australia) 

This season he is especially benefiting from this as his rival - Norris, has similar pace (arguably perhaps slightly better at times) but doesn't have the consistency nor the racecraft to benefit. I am looking forward to seeing Piastri develop and he may well become a driver who is similar in approach and hopefully results as either Alonso or Prost, although the bar is still very high as these two drivers are two of the GOATs imo.","['Great points of comparison; from what I have read about him, his work ethic also stands out.

His success is well deserved and I hope to see him improve even more! \n\nHe has the making of a legend in future imo', 'I agree. Piastri is what Prost always have been during his career, a man of raceday. It reminds me a lot how Prost conducted his McLaren and then Williams both against Lauda and Senna. Exploiting opportunities and results. Chilling blood, clinical. While Max reminds me of 1992 and 1993 Senna, racing with his ass and soul against a much better team with his teammate nowhere near in sight. Norris is... Idk, a better Damon Hill maybe right now. He is good, he can be great, but he definitely NEEDS to be better at his own mind. Maybe he needs the 2-3 years Hill needed too.', 'I was thinking the same to be honest but felt like I might get crucified for even making the comparison.

Being 1/10th faster consistently isn’t enough this year for Lando, but making fewer crucial mistakes is plenty for Piastri', ""I love Oscar. His racecraft, overtakes, how calm and collected he is. We haven't seen him defending a lot, but when he did (Baku 2024), he was as aggressive as when he's attacking.\nThe two overtakes on Lewis this year (Australia and Jeddah)... Chef's kiss.\xa0"", '100% agree, Prost and Alonso are the best analogs. One of the most impressive things for me is how he’s handled Max. It actually started last season at Abu Dhabi where he showed Max he’s willing to crash and won’t back down. This season he’s used this and Max’s determination to never be out braked to force a mistake at Australia, Saudi and now Miami. He’s so methodical about how he does things and the results were there for all to see yesterday when he beat his slightly quicker teammate. With the caveat that he only has 2 and a bit seasons in F1 Lando still has a tiny advantage over long stints because of his experience with these tires. Oscar is better to much better at nearly everything else. He makes fewer mistakes, drives far more intelligently and takes what’s on the table nearly every time. Lando can beat him in any given race but Oscar will win the season every time because of this. He’s a killer and I expect him to school Lando when they inevitably go wheel to wheel the same way Max does because Lando has made his self doubt so public for all to see.\xa0', ""In my mind he's what Kimi Raikkonen would have been if Kimi was just a little bit nerdy."", ""Oscar is about as fast as Lando (it varies from track to track), but he seems to be able to win even when he isn't the fastest.

1kfjgbg,Are the 2025 racing rules killing side-by-side battles?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfjgbg/are_the_2025_racing_rules_killing_sidebyside/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"The 2025 changes to racing rules are making proper wheel-to-wheel racing, especially over multiple corners, nearly impossible.

[Video - How F1's secret racing rules have changed for 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbTAHyzkrY)[Article - The new F1 racing rules that sealed Verstappen penalty](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/revealed-new-f1-2025-racing-rules-verstappen-jeddah-penalty/)  
The above video and article by THE RACE explains these changes well but I will give a summary below:

Under the new rules, if a driver is overtaking on the *inside* (and they are in control and within track limits), **they no longer have to leave space for the car on the** ***outside*** **at corner exit**. That’s a major shift from 2024, where both drivers were expected to leave each other room if they were side-by-side at the apex.

Because of this rule change, if a driver overtaking on the inside manages to get alongside the wing mirror of the car on the outside, the car on the outside effectively has to give up the corner. The inside driver can now legally run them out of space on exit, so there’s little incentive to stay side-by-side. As a result, we’re unlikely to see drivers hanging it around the outside anymore, which basically kills the chance of multi-corner battles.

https://preview.redd.it/jl0tjjo6d0ze1.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=e093fee9a8b09a072921ff232e44bd2ab3b7e79f

This rule change is why **Piastri's Lap 1 Turn 1 incident** in Jeddah was deemed legal. Under the 2024 rules, this move would likely have resulted in a penalty.

**TLDR: Inside car just divebombs, outside car either backs out or gets run off. Not much of a battle.**

Another key 2025 rule change concerns overtaking around the outside. Under the new guidelines, a driver attempting a move on the outside must now be **ahead at the apex** to be entitled to space on corner exit. Simply being **alongside**, as was sufficient under the 2024 rules, no longer guarantees that right. This makes outside overtakes significantly harder and discourages side-by-side racing, as drivers will be less likely to attempt moves around the outside.

This rule likely explains why Verstappen wasn’t penalized for forcing Norris off in **Miami Lap 1 Turn 2** — Norris was only alongside, not ahead, so Verstappen wasn’t required to leave room.","[""So once the car on the inside is ahead, they have the right to the whole track? That's beyond stupid."", 'The interesting thing is that these changes resulted from a meeting with all drivers in Qatar last year, after criticism that drivers overtaking on the inside were being penalised too often.\n\nRussell spoke in an [interview](https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/13262139/qatar-gp-f1-drivers-fia-stewards-hold-productive-meeting-to-discuss-racing-rules-after-max-verstappen-and-lando-norris-controversy) about it:\n\n>""If you are able to stay on the circuit [when overtaking on the inside] you are in your right to run the driver wide, as it has been for all of us since go-karts,"" he said.\n\nThis is exactly what the drivers wanted (to be able to run the defending car off the road) and is more consistent with lower category motorsport compared to previous versions, according to Russell.', 'Absolutely yes', ""Yes. Take a look at the Ocon and Hamilton battle. Absolutely unreal battling by both and it was 100% fair. And Ocon didn't actually have to leave Lewis space according to the new rules (albeit that space was largely the run off, but such is the track layout), he didn't because he can actually race wheel to wheel. Historically he just chooses not to when it's a teammate lol.\n\nWheel to wheel racing has never been as low quality as it is now. And it's not because the drivers are incapable, it's because they're choosing not to because the rulebook is dumb as fuck and seemingly written in a way solely to cause debate. You couple that with stewards making inconsistent decisions every single weekend and you end up in a scenario where nobody actually knows where the baseline is because it changes every week."", 'Yeah pretty much.\n\nWhat we have today isn\'t good racing by any stretch. The amount of actual good racing we had over the last years is very little. And no, i wouldnt call 1 random overtake during a DRS zone as ""good racing"". \n\nI\'m reffering to actual battles on track, like Norris vs Verstappen in COTA last year, or Charles vs Max in 2022 or their other countless battles they had.\n\nOther sports have much better racing than F1 and it\'s super sad that it got to this point in my opinion.', 'Yes', ""The rules were bad before, people heard they are going to change some things for 2025 and thought maybe it will get better.

This then causes him to go off the track.\n\nThe only reason Norris was wide was because Max couldn't keep his car under control.

[...] At worst, Colapinto may be a crash risk, and may not be a superstar in the making - the sample set of a part-season at Williams is too small to know for sure on both counts - but he is a proven point scorer already and is a driver with ability.\n\nThis is something that I really agree with. Yea, Doohan was dealt an unfair and terrible hand, but it's not as if Colapinto was out of reach to Albon as a rookie with little preparation last year. I think everyone can agree, especially with his performance so far this season, that Albon is a fantastic driver.\n\nColapinto crashed a lot, but most importantly he had the pace. I believe that people just don't like the idea of him on the grid because he brings with him *very* annoying people.\n\nUltimately, this is another self-inflicted gunshot in the driver management side of things for Alpine. There was no need to announce Doohan that early last season, and they wasted 6 races on a driver that they gave one of the worst possible conditions to debut on."", ""I mean when the team hires your replacement before the season has even started you know you're in trouble. How can you have confidence you'll be given the time to learn and improve when the team does that. There's the normal F1 ruthlessness and there's being set up to fail."", ""I've been watching F2/F3 since it was GP2/GP3 when Rosberg won the GP2 title, and I never thought Doohan was anywhere near as bad as a lot of people here think he is.\n\nHe was actually pretty rapid once his junior teams found a good setup for him. Comparing Doohan to other drivers of his age is interesting. Colapinto finished 4th in his second F3 season with just two 2 sprint wins, whereas Doohan finished 2nd in his second season with 3 feature race wins and 1 sprint win. Their first F2 seasons are hard to compare with Colapinto getting called up to Williams before it  finished.\n\nDoohan's second season of F2 would probably have been a championship winning season if not for the setup/chassis issues (depending on who you believe) Doohan experienced in the first half of the season. He outscored the entire grid in the second half of the season to finish runner up to a highly rated Théo Pourchaire, who at that point was into his 4th F2 season.\n\nDoohan conclusively (imo) had a better F3/F2 junior career compared to Liam Lawson. Doohan only finished 21 points behind Lawson in F2 despite it being Lawson's second season compared to Doohan's first.\n\nF2 and F3 is littered with drivers who should have had F1 careers, so Doohan can count himself somewhat lucky regardless, but I think a lot of people have passed judgement on his speed without actually watching any of his junior career. The guy was genuinely rapid imo and might have flourished in a much lower pressure environment compared to the basket case that is Alpine. He came into the sport against one of the most in form drivers on the grid and actually managed to outqualify him in Miami, his most recent qualifying session.\n\nThis is all my opinion of course, it's no more or less valid than anyone elses."", 'Probably a bad take but drivers like Bearman, Colapinto and Hadjar kind of sealed Doohans fate. They came in an immediately showed something even if it wasn’t really expected of them. \nF1 is so competitive and tight these days that teams can’t really afford to keep a driver who may or may not become good over time. Sure Doohan may become really good (he arguably should be decent considering his testing programme) but really in 6/7 races can it be said he’s been anything other than underwhelming? (even factoring in the fact the cars a tractor). I don’t expect Colapinto to set the world alight but he compared well to Albon (who is having a season right now). If he eliminates the crashes (which might reduce as his future is secure) he’ll be serviceable. Just avoid Alpines socials for the time being….', ""Honestly I think about 2/3 of his bad results are on the team or the car.\n\nHe has a right to be annoyed if he doesn't get more of a chance.

He had most of a year."", 'Maybe Racing Bull can swap out Lawson with Doohan.', 'It’s a pretty rough situation for the kid.

1kfddg0,[AMuS] McLaren's secret trick,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfddg0/amus_mclarens_secret_trick/,2025-05-05, News,,"['Translation: \n\n> **The Miami GP was a resounding slap in the face for McLaren\'s rivals. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris beat their closest rivals by more than 37 seconds. The secret, once again, was how the Papaya racers managed tire temperatures.**\n\n> More is not possible. McLaren left Miami with 58 points. A one-two finish in the sprint race, a one-two finish in the main race. Lando Norris was ahead on Saturday, and Oscar Piastri on Sunday. The McLaren drivers had made their task unnecessarily difficult. The two pole positions went to Andrea Kimi Antonelli and Max Verstappen.\n\n> This is proof that the Mercedes and Red Bull cars have the potential to beat McLaren on a single lap. But as soon as McLaren takes the lead in the race, Piastri and Norris disappear over the horizon. It\'s as if they could drive every lap like they did in qualifying. After 57 laps, their lead over third-placed George Russell was 37 seconds and over world champion Verstappen was almost 40 seconds. ""They\'re in a league of their own,"" team principals Toto Wolff and Christian Horner had to admit.\n\n> The match winner was the same on Saturday as on Sunday. The McLarens kept their tire temperatures within the desired range. All the other cars\' tires eventually overheated. In the sprint, the McLaren drivers broke away from the field at the exact moment their intermediates became too hot on the drying track. In the main race, the game was over when Piastri and Norris prevailed against Verstappen. The Red Bull\'s tires were already so close to the red that Verstappen\'s bag of tricks was no longer of any use in defending his position.\n\n> **A completely legal trick.**\nToto Wolff marveled: ""They demonstrate their superiority on every tire type. We have a similarly fast car to them, but only on one lap. McLaren can reproduce that every lap."" His colleague Horner sees differences depending on the track and outside temperature. ""Their advantage is always greatest where the tires are most stressed. That\'s why we looked much worse in Miami than in Jeddah.""\n\n> Conclusion: McLaren must have something beyond high downforce and balanced car balance. Wolff praises the rival: ""They\'re not doing anything illegal. We have no doubt that they\'re operating within the rules, whatever they\'ve found."" It\'s becoming increasingly clear that the McLaren engineers have a clever solution for keeping the tires cool. ""Five degrees makes a huge difference,"" explains Wolff.\n\n> This is precisely what\'s troubling the opponents now. ""We don\'t know,"" asserts the Mercedes team principal. ""But we\'re working hard on it. We\'re not just sitting back and watching, but trying to find the key through experimentation and development work."" According to Wolff, the McLaren secret isn\'t some kind of brainwave, but the product of continuous improvement of the car since the major turnaround at the 2023 Austrian GP.\n\n> **Find the key as quickly as possible.**\nRed Bull is taking a different approach. The dethroned class leader is firing on all cylinders at McLaren in the hopes of eventually hitting the mark. Somehow, people in Milton Keynes don\'t want to believe that everything is above board. But they also have no idea what could be causing McLaren to let its tires caress themselves like that.\n\n> After the Miami GP, team principal Christian Horner initially expressed his conciliation: ""Hats off to McLaren. They taught everyone a lesson today. They\'re doing a better job with tire management than the rest of the field."" On one point, he agrees with colleague Toto Wolff: ""We need to find out as quickly as possible what McLaren is doing. Whatever it is, it could be a match-winner next year as well.""\n\n> Clearly, the trick has nothing to do with the current ground-effect cars. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella, of course, offers no explanation. He only says: ""We have to thank our engineers for creating factors that allow us to keep the tires within their window."" The Italian admits that some aspects can be carried over into the new era of Formula 1, while others need to be adapted to the 2026 cars and their aerodynamics.\n\n> **A clever air circulation.**\nStella also denies that her exceptionally good tire management in the race has nothing to do with the problems that sometimes make it difficult for drivers to set the perfect lap in qualifying. ""We don\'t pay a price per lap for caring for the tires better than others. It\'s no problem for us to get the tires into their working window quickly."" In qualifying, drivers are more likely to complain about a lack of feel for the front axle.\n\n> The opinion is now gaining ground in the scene that the engineers in Woking have found a particularly clever solution for circulating air in the brake ventilation drums, keeping the brakes hot while keeping the tires cool. The external shape of the drums is standardized. Inside, you have complete freedom. You\'re not allowed to install any explicit cooling elements, but you\'re not restricted in the choice of materials.\n\n> An insider speculates: ""Perhaps they circulate the air in such a way that it stays cool in the crucial areas and shield the heat through the use of certain materials."" Chief Technical Officer Rob Marshall is said to be the father of the system. He has been carrying the concept around with him for years, but has only now made it work. That would be bitter for Red Bull. Marshall was at Red Bull for 17 years before moving to McLaren in early 2024.\n\n> Stella also made an interesting statement. ""Even when it gets hot, our car stays cool. We\'ve developed a very efficient cooling system."" This also affects tire temperatures. If the car as a whole gets too hot, it radiates to the tires. Stella\'s statement also explains why the McLaren is near the back in terms of top speed. More cooling reduces efficiency.', 'So basically McLaren could keep dominating into the new regulation unless the others figure out what the magic trick McLaren are doing with the tyres.', '>If the car as a whole gets too hot, it radiates to the tires.

Behind the scenes, hard work is being done to get the adventure off to a flying start, and to ensure that things go smoothly, Audi has adjusted the team's structure. In the new setup, Mattia Binotto has been given a new role. The former Ferrari team boss was previously chief technical officer and chief operational officer, but he has left those positions.

Binotto is now responsible for the overall development of Audi's 2026 Formula 1 car. The Italian has been tasked with optimising the coordination between the chassis and the powertrain. According to the German manufacturer, Binotto must do this by tightening up existing processes so that the development of the technology and the various departments within the organisation run more efficiently.Until now, the chassis and engine were overseen by different managers, but now everything falls under Binotto. It is no easy task, because Sauber has locations in Hinwil in Switzerland and Neuberg an der Donau in Germany, while a development centre is currently being built in England. Binotto is therefore tasked with ensuring that all locations work well together.

Newly appointed team principal Jonathan Wheatley is now solely responsible for the running of the racing activities. Wheatley and Binotto must jointly manage the transformation of Sauber into the Audi works team.

The F1 project falls under Audi Formula Racing GmbH and that branch has undergone further changes. CEO Adam Baker is leaving, making that position redundant. Experienced engineer Christian Foyer is the new operational boss and will focus on the development of the hybrid powertrain. Chief technical officer is Stefan Dreyer, who will also take on the role of spokesman.","['Again the Audi livery is so sick...

1kfb055,Where did drive through penalties go? Time penalties are often not appropriate/enough of a disadvantage. +10 should be minimum time penalty.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfb055/where_did_drive_through_penalties_go_time/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"The last drive through penalty I remember was ~~Hamilton at Silverstone 2021~~. It feels like in the last few years they have been abandoned in favour of +5 time penalties.

We have seen several times drivers not really be affected by a +5. Max has shown them to be worth 'tanking' to get clean air, protect tyres, and pull a gap to neutralise the penalty. He's even gone as far as to laugh them off over the radio. We also saw Haas in Saudi Arabia use the second car to block the following pack to neutralise a penalty.

I just don't think these +5s are enough of a deterrent for the incidents they are usually being applied to.

Thoughts?","[""This was discussed last year - and actually the drivers successfully lobbied last year to have the baseline penalty increased to +10, for the reasons you stated. The KMag/Haas battle worked because they essentially tanked KMag's race for him to hold back the others from Hulk - even though he dropped way down, Hulk was protected, so the team net gained from the penalty, regardless of the length of the penalty.\n\nIt has been odd to see more +5s penalties this year. Max's penalty in Saudi was 5, and not 10, likely because it was the first turn in the first lap, so there's usually leniency anyway. \n\nI agree that drive throughs etc. should be used more, and that if you're going to have a penalty system, it needs to be stringent enough to actually deter the behavior it's intended to deter. But I don't know that we're seeing a new trend toward lighter penalties this year, or an overall issue within the penalty system that there has been movement to correct in the last year or so, but the implementation isn't great."", 'Hamilton got a 10s penalty that race, not a drive through.\n\nAlso, the current regulations require 10s penalties for those incidents, rather than 5s', 'Norris received a drive through penalty in Qatar 24 for failing to lift under yellow', ""I'm pretty sure that Alonso and Hamilton both got drive throughs last year, and Norris got a stop-go which is even worse.\n\nI do think that in situations like Jeddah the penalty should be that they have to give up the position, and if they don't do so in a couple of laps they get a drive through."", 'Yup, we are in a very uncanny valley with respect to penalties at the moment.\n\nThe fix I think is to have permanent stewards so that we get consistent penalties.', 'It\'s a bit difficult topic.\n\nWhen DT and stop/go were the only available options, a lot of time, fans lamented that DT was clearly too harsh for some minor infringements, we have to remember that gaps are much narrower and SC more frequent than when the penalty system was devised.\n\nBut now we have +5s penalties, there\'s the issue of the penalty being an actual benefit if the driver manages to complete a pass he wouldn\'t have without it.\n\nMaybe they should switch to a system of ""drop x positions ASAP"" as the penalty, but even with this one, there would be the obvious issue of it being way too harsh to someone who got their 4th track limit strike while being 40 seconds ahead of next competition.', 'I fully concur - 10s or more, minimum. Absolutely. Also, I\'d love to see substantially more disqualifications for driving standards.\n\nI don\'t at all buy the argument that strategic acceptance of penalties is ""just driving to the rules the way they are."" That\'s BS. They\'re *rules*. If you\'re playing the game, you\'re agreeing to *rules.* You don\'t just break them when it suits you because you can handle the consequences, you follow the rules because it\'s the sporting thing to do.

1kfnfh0,Stefano Domenicali and Liberty Media deserve a lot more criticism for their handling of the calendar,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfnfh0/stefano_domenicali_and_liberty_media_deserve_a/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"I'll preface this by saying that I totally get the need for the sport to expand and for certain races to be included on the calendar. Commercial considerations do have to come into play if F1 is going to be profitable, so I'm not naive enough to think that all of the races that are currently on the calendar for money reasons shouldn't be there.

However, it beggars belief that Domenicali and others at Liberty Media are running roughshod over the calendar in a way that's beginning to threaten the sport's DNA and apart from the odd grumble, there is nobody within the sport questioning any of it, or anybody in the media willing to hold them to account for it.

In the last few years we've seen France and Germany disappear from the calendar. Imola is set to go at the end of this year. Zandvoort is going at the end of 2026 and Spa is set to go onto a rotational deal. Barcelona is out of contract after next season and its future you'd think must be under some threat as well. We're entering a situation where it's entirely feasible that the 2028 season could feature just six core European races, if you don't include Baku, out of a 24-race calendar. 

Even those fans who aren't as bothered with the traditions of the sport must realise that it's going way too far now. It's important for F1 to be a global sport, but it's also important if it is to thrive long-term that it stays true to its roots and builds a calendar around the historic races that for decades have been at the heart of its foundations.

And then that brings me onto the decision to give Miami a contract extension to 2041, and regardless of the popularity or success of the event, to commit to extending a partnership that has run for just four years for another SIXTEEN is an utterly insane business decision. Extensions of that nature should be reserved only for events that have a track record of delivering races over many decades and where absolutely zero doubts exist about the promoter's ability to deliver it. To give that to such a new event, and one that has ranked among the least popular with fans since it was first introduced, carries enormous risk and really should raise serious questions about the leadership of Formula One. 

Not only that, but it's a total lack of respect for where the sport has come from, and yet there is nobody holding Domenicali and co for account for it. If World Tennis was threatening to remove Wimbledon and the French Open as Grand Slams or World Golf doing the same with the Masters or the Open while simultaneously signing 15-year agreements for unproven events they would be getting pelters. Like them or not, Monaco, Silverstone, Spa, Monza, France, Germany and other core European events are what has made Formula One what it is. That we're in a situation where several of those races have disappeared or are in the process of becoming rotational while other, far less valuable races consistently get 10-15 year contract extensions is not just sad, but it's indicative of the reckless leadership that Domenicali is overseeing. It's doubly disappointing when you consider he's from a proper motorsport background and should therefore understand the importance of upholding traditions.

Liberty's policy with the calendar may well work short-term and help bolster revenues, but if in a few years' time the DTS-inspired boom has died off and the Netflix generation of fans have died off, it faces being left in a very precarious position if you have a calendar full of dull, uninspired circuits in countries with little or no motorsport tradition. NASCAR acts as a cautionary tale here. 

Meanwhile, nobody within the sport seems interested in questioning what is happening, and that's a very, very sad thing indeed.

1kfxzsk,Forcing a penalty for overtaking off track,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfxzsk/forcing_a_penalty_for_overtaking_off_track/,2025-05-06, Discussion,"So I just had an interesting thought

This part weekend we saw Lando overtake Max off track and give the position back. 


Under the current rule set it is up to the team to do this preemptively or face a possible penalty from the stewards.

Now question has nothing to do with whether Lando was right or Max was right. 

Instead, in a hypothetical situation, let's say car A overtakes car B off track and car B immediately pits (immediately not necessity being the next corner but let's say within a lap). 

Now car A CAN'T possibly give the position back (especially if car A just made a stop... It can be maybe argued that if car A needed to pit anyways it just forces them to do it right away and to give up track position after both cars have pitted) 

Either way though, by boxing car B, the team FORCES car A top do ""something"" or to simply eat the penalty. Now in most cases I imagine car A to just pit +1 lap after B and IF they remain ahead to give the position up and continue fighting but there's going to be some scenarios where that +1 pit timing REALLY screws that team's strategy up. 


I do wonder what stewards would do in that situation as they're not ""supposed"" to take these other factors into account and ONLY look at the move itself to determine the legality. 

Or the flip side of this argument would be what if it was this scenario

Car A overtakes car B offtrack in a VERY blatant manner but Car A immediately pits at the next possible opportunity. If car B does not put, did car A constitute ""giving the position back""? One might ask what the advantage gained would have been but track position matters and would confer an advantage. This would be further complicated if car B also immediately pits and car B's garage was further down the pit lane because car B would have temporarily regained it's position. 

With the style that some drivers have (honestly it's 90% max) this certainly seems like something that should be on strategist minds even though on the face of it this seems like a pretty rare scenario. 

An overtake off track comes with a 5 or 10 seconds penalty (it should be 10 but sometimes the lower it on a discretionary basis) so that's like half a pitstop and isn't something to be ignored even if it is something you're going to see only a few times a season. ","['The whole giving position back thing only works if you actually lose the advantage gained. For example, you can’t just give the position back in a manner that allows you to immediately challenge again, it’s deemed improper. \n\nThey’d just get the penalty for gaining an advantage because they haven’t done anything to give it away again. There might be some merit to the idea of a driver who was overtaken illegally pitting so that they can’t be given the place back and therefore inciting a penalty, but I doubt there’d be many if any occasions where pit strategy would be dictated by that.', '> Instead, in a hypothetical situation, let\'s say car A overtakes car B off track and car B immediately pits (immediately not necessity being the next corner but let\'s say within a lap).\n\nThat\'s a penalty for car A then.\n\nThe ""giving up the advantage"" part isn\'t the default, but a concession to not get a penalty in such cases. Depending on the track layout (think of the first chicane in e.g. Saudi Arabia), you might not have many other options than coming out in front of another car.\n\nI don\'t know if it would be enough for race direction if car A slows down considerably as to give up an advantage gained. But if not, it\'s tough luck for car A, that\'s it.', 'It was up to car A to give the position back. They didn’t do it in time so they just take the penalty and carry on. Doesnt really matter what car B did, there’s a window to give it back and it closes. Same if a safety car comes out before the position has been given back, now they aren’t allowed to anyway. Or if another competitor gets in between them because car B made a mistake behind. Car A missed the opportunity to avoid the penalty so they just eat it.', 'I saw an online race where Jimmy Broadbent has a ""let them through"" penalty. He tried pitting to let them through, but the games programming told him no chance. It\'s absolutely worth trying if its untested.', 'To clarify: the car that gained the advantage off-track has to ""give back"" said advantage. If the other car does not want it, that doesn\'t mean that there will be a penalty.\n\nThe perfect example (without starting a flamewar hopefully by just mentioning it), is Abu Dhabi 2021. I\'m referring to the first lap in this case. Verstappen had pole and led into the corner. Hamilton goes off track and ends up ahead. RBR have discussed with the steward that they feel Hamilton should let Max past, but they said he had already given the time that he won back.\n\nWhat happened here is that RBR tried to get Checo directly behind Max so that when Hamilton gave the spot back, Checo would have a chance of also overtaking Hamilton. Max therefore slowed down a little bit. Hamilton meanwhile had also slowed down and given back the advantage in time. That Max is not taking the position back is ultimately not his fault.', ""I'm not sure what exactly you are asking, but a driver just has to serve his penalty if he can't give the position back anymore."", ""What if the car abruptly slows down (due to accident in front) and you are at full racing speed and the brake couldn't make it, you get a penalty too? Heck even if the brakes could make it it's more dangerous to just stop"", '1. Car A overtakes car B illegally. \n\n2. Car B makes a pitstop soon after.\n\n3. Car A gives a position back (therefore the advantage gained) by letting car C through.', ""Which scenario are you referring to\n\nIn my original scenario the car that was overtaken immediately pits and eliminates the other team's ability to give the position back\n\nUnless the offending car immediately pits at the next possible opportunity and then gives up the position (assuming they come out ahead)\n\nBut even if the offending car pits immediately, it could well be the case that they come out way behind because pit stops are really random.\n\nSo a strong defensive measure of the car that was overtaken off track is to immediately pit (especially if they were in the put window anyways). Putting the offending team in a scenario where they only have downsides but no upsides (because offending car coming out WAY ahead post pitstop would either have to give up the massive advantage OR take a 10s penalty... And if they came out way behind then they came out way behind)""]",0,22,0.31,0,21,21,0,2,-0.06,0

The more and more I am seeing of Piastri I feel like, even though it’s still close, he might actually have surpassed Norris. He is just the more complete driver, more stable mentally and is able to deal with Max too. Maybe he is less “markatble” than Norris but I feel that is decling too.

But still people underestimate Piastri. I mean another small example is that on Dutch tv guido banter garde had to predict a top 3. He placed Piastri outside of it. Sure he started outside of the top 3, but he has shown he can clearly win a race. 

So let’s open up the discussion, how do people look at this battle? How are the pundits in your country talking about Piastri versus Norris and who is in your eyes most likely to become world champion (this year or in the future). ","['Norris is a faster driver but more prone to mistakes and can be a bit rash at times\n\nPiastri is a calmer and more calculated driver, last year he completed every racing lap F1 thats got to be both luck and a skill to do that', 'I think if both drivers are having a particularly good day, Norris comes out further ahead than Piastri.\n\nThe difference maker is that as far as Piastri lets on, he doesn\'t have *bad* days. Week in, week out, Piastri has been putting in incredible performances with very, very few mistakes. And when he *does* have a mistake, somehow he\'s able to make it hurt him less than the same mistake would hurt other drivers (like his spinout at the Australian GP this year).\n\nI also think we\'re not even seeing Piastri at the best he\'ll ever be. It\'s easy to forget he\'s a young driver that still has things to learn, but for the next couple years he\'s only going to get sharper and develop better racecraft. Ask again next year and I think the answer will probably be an uncomplicated ""yes, Piastri is better"".', 'I want to see wheel to wheel battle between Norris and Piastri to confirm.', 'I think Norris is faster but Piastri is cooler under pressure.', ""Neither of them are better as it stands now. But we're going to learn a lot by the end of this season. They both have the fastest car and this battle should be super entertaining to watch. I feel like Piastri has the demeanor and level headedness to take it to Lando and possibly beat him in the Championship. We'll soon find out.."", 'My opinion:   \nNorris has a small edge on raw speed but Piastri is the complete driver you need to be to win a chamionship', 'Piastri makes less mistakes. Which is crucial to becoming WDC. So I would not be surprised if Oscar wins it before Lando.', 'It’s close IMO, but I don’t think there’s enough to categorically say 1 is ahead of the other. Norris was unlucky in Miami on the first lap. He likely would have won without the incident with Verstappen. Jeddah is a bit of an unknown given his crash in qualifying (yes, he’s at fault for that but before that he was flying all weekend). I think Norris will fully bounce back in the triple header', 'No. I think Piastri is a great driver who’s been smart to take advantage of Norris’s issues early on. But this is the same Norris who beat him 20-4 in qualifying and 16-8 in races last year. \n\nUsually gaps like that don’t just suddenly flip. Both were pushing in Miami after they passed Max and Norris closed in by 6 seconds!\n\nIf the pace advantage stays like this after the Spain TD Norris will beat him over a full season. His pace and tyre management are too good for Oscar’s.']",0,168,0.41,0,159,159,0,31,0.009999999999999953,0
1kfi3v2,A bone to pick with this race director and his unwillingness to use red flags,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfi3v2/a_bone_to_pick_with_this_race_director_and_his/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"I know red flags have a bit of a negative stigma, as there seems to be a common opinion that it's better to keep the race moving under yellow flags, a VSC or a safety car than to red flag it and bring everyone back to the pits. 

But...why? 

Red flags have become much more common in recent years, presumably for safety reasons. But I've noticed a reversal from this under new race director Rui Marques, who in Saturday's Miami sprint didn't red flag the race after an accident between Liam Lawson and Fernando Alonso that I'm almost sure would have caused a red flag between 2020 and 2024. 

It quickly became obvious that we'd finish the race behind the safety car, losing four potentially thrilling laps of action. 

But again...why? 

We also lost 4 laps to a safety car in Bahrain, and a ridiculous 20 total laps in Australia. That's nearly half the race!

I totally understand the use of the safety car or VSC if there's some debris on track or it appears the incident in question can be dealt with quickly, but I fail to see who benefits from a safety car period of more than a couple of laps. The fans lose out on a bunch of racing laps, and cheap pit stops often give certain drivers lucky advantages at random.

**Benefits of a red flag over a safety car:**  

* Fewer racing laps lost 
* The option for a far more entertaining standing start (but can still do a rolling start which is identical to safety car restart, if desired)
* Oftentimes more fair (no cheap pit stops, and let's not get started on Abu Dhabi 2021)

**Benefits of a safety car over a red flag:**

* Often less of a delay in the action 

But even that last point is flimsy, as I'm as entertained by what's going on during a red flag period as I am watching the cars crawl around the track behind the safety car. 

**53 races/sprints before Marques took over:** 

Safety cars for 4+ laps: 15  
Red flags: 9 

**12 races under Marques:**

Safety cars for 4+ laps: 7  
Red flags: 0

I don't know if this is the result of an edict or what, but I don't think it's a good trend for the sport. 

Thoughts?","[""None of the wrecks met the criteria for a red flag.
