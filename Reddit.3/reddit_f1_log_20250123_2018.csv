2022 I think I forgot or it got deleted, 2024 I made but it got deleted and mods didn't respond to messages, a mistake I assume due to me posting it too close to the season start, so I'm making it nice and early this year!

**So, what records could we see broken in 2025?**

As ever, mainly concentrating on driver records as most constructor records are not going to change hands, but we'll take a look anyway.

We also leave out records like ""most wins from first race of a season"" or ""most poles in a season"" etc which could simply happen or not happen.

**Most consecutive race entries** \- Hamilton (currently 265 in 3rd place) will jump ahead of Vettel (280 in 2nd) before the end of the season, assuming he doesn't miss any races. He still has a few seasons to go before overtaking Barrichello in 1st with 326. 

**Most consecutive race starts** \- Verstappen (currently in 3rd with 209) will over take Ricciardo (currently in 2nd with 232) before the season ends, again assuming he starts every race. 

**Most wins with a single constructor** \- Versteppen (currently in 3rd with 63) could surpass Schumacher (currently in 2nd with 72) by taking ten wins this season. He's also within reach of Hamilton (currently in 1st with 84) now Lewis is no longer with Mercedes and can't improve on his record.

**Youngest driver to start a race** \- Antonelli will jump into third, assuming he starts the Australian Grand Prix.

**Youngest winners** \- Antonelli (turns 19 on August 25th) could take this title from Verstappen (18yrs 228 days) if he wins early enough in the season. Him, Bearman, and Bortoleto all have the chance to break into the second place spot at any point in the season.

**Oldest winners** \- one we're still hoping for! Alonso could break into the top 10 with a win at any point. First half(ish) of the season he'd break into sixth place, surpassing Sam Hanks who won the 1957 Indy 500 (then part of the F1 season) at 42 years 321 days (Fernando is already older than this). If he wins after a few weeks before his 44th birthday, he'll surpass Jack Brabham in fifth place, who won the 1970 South Afrcian Grand Prix aged 43yrs 339 days. Everyone ahead of him in the standings at this point won in the 1950s. Hamilton will also jump into the top 10, surpassing Graham Hill, if he wins anytime this season (apart from the first few races I think)

**Most races before first win** \- Stroll currently has 169 races without a win. If he wins at any point he will jump straight into second place on this list. If he wins in Qatar or Abu Dhabi (without winning an earlier race in 2025), he takes the record from Perez who first won a race on his 190th attempt.

**Most races without a win** \- not likely to change in terms of ultimate record - poor Hulkenburg is still *miles* ahead on this unenviable record. Stroll (currently in 6th place with 166), could surpass Grosjean (179), Heidfeld (183), and KMag (185) to jump into third place.

**Most wins without a World Championship** \- Leclerc is currently joint 10th on this list with 8, matching Ricciardo and Ickx. He could surpass Webber (9), Bottas, Berger, and Peterson (10), Massa and Barrichello (11), Reutemann (12), and possibly even Coulthard (13) or Moss (16) if he has a really unlucky season, though the latter two are of course near impossible.

**Most consecutive pole positions at the same Grand Prix** \- Max is currently joint fifth with lots of people with his ongoing streak at Austria. If he gets pole there, he's joint 3rd with Schumacher with five poles (Schumacher got his in Japan and Spain).

**Youngest polesitters** \- Bearman or Antonelli could take the number 1 spot with a pole at any point. Bortoleto could take #1 if he gets pole in the first half of the season (again, not 100% on the maths!)

**Oldest polesitter** \- Alonso has a change to surpass Andretti (4th) or Brabham (3rd) depending on when he does it. Again, if he surpasses Brabham, the only two drivers ahead of him will be Farina and Fangio, who got their records in the 1950s. Hamilton will jump into sixth place with a pole at any point. 

**Most races without a pole position** \- Ocon (156) and Gasly (153) will surpass Panis, Herbert, and Brundle if they don't get a pole this season. Ocon could take the record off Grosjean in Qatar if he fails to get pole at any point this season.

**Most races before first pole position** \- as above, if either get a pole at any point, they will jump straight into second, surpassing Sainz. Neither can take the #1 slot of Perez though, who finally got pole in Saudi in 2022 at his 219th attempt.

**Total fastest laps** \- Hamilton currently second with 67, ten away from Schumacher out front with 77. 

**Most races before first fastest lap** \- Stroll would jump into second here at any point, as he is currently leading the ""Most Races Without A Fastest Lap"" record with 169. Out front is Trulli who got a fastest lap in Bahrain in 2009, his 203rd race.

**Most fastest laps at the same Grand Prix** \- Hamilton is currently joint 1st with seven (Italian), alongside Schumacher (Spanish), and Mansell (British). Hamilton will hold this record alone with a fastest lap at Monza. 

**Most consecutive seasons with a fastest lap** \- Lewis joint first with 15 alongside Schumacher. As this is an ongoing record, he will he out on his own if he gets a fastest lap at any point.

**Total podium finishes** \- Max has 112 in fourth place. He'll surpass Vettel (122) if he gets ten this season, but is still a way off Schumacher (155) and Hamilton (202).

**Oldest drivers to score a podium finish** \- again, can't quite work it out, but I think Alonso could \_just\_ sneak onto the top ten ahead of Brabham (44yrs 107 days) who got a podium at the 1970 British GP. If he does, once again, everyone ahead of him joined the top ten in the 1950s.

**Most races before scoring a podium finish** \- Hulkenberg is currently \_way\_ out in front of the ""Most races without scoring a podium finish"" record on 230. If he gets a podium at any point, he will utterly obliterate the current record holder Sainz, who took 101 attempts. Tsunoda also currently has 90 races with no podium, so could jump into the top three and even take the #1 spot if he gets his first podium after the 11th race of the season.

**Total career race finishes** \- as last year, Alonso (324) and Hamilton (322) are out front and very close to each other. A couple of retirements from Alonso could see this record swap to Hamilton, though this could chop and change throughout the season.

**Most consecutive race finishes** \- Piastri is in ninth place on 28 with an ongoing streak, which also saw him finish every race in 2024. If he keeps it up, he could surpass Alonso (29), Raikkonen (30), Sainz (31), Hamilton and Heidfeld (33), Ricciardo (34), Verstappen (43) and even take the top spot from Hamilton (48) if he repeats last season's feat. 

**Led every lap, total races** \- Verstappen is currently in fourth on 14. He could take third from Vettel (15), second from Senna (19) and possibly even the top spot from Hamilton (23).

**Led for at least one lap, oldest leaders** \- Again, Alonso could take the sixth place spot from Brabham if he leads late in the season, and yes, again the only people ahead of him did it in the 1950s.

**Wins from pole position** \- Max is in 3rd with 32. Eight more would see him match Schumacher in second on 40. Hamilton is way out front with 61.

**Pole, win, fastest lap, and led every lap (""Grand Slam"" or ""Grand Chelem"")** \- Max has five. Joint third with Schumacher and Ascari. He also got one in every season for the last four years, two in 2023. He could match Lewis with six. Either could possibly match or beat Jim Clark with eight if they have an utterly dominating car.

**Oldest Grand Slam** \- Alonso or Hamilton could beat Brabham into second place with one this season, Lewis would have to do it after the first several race. Way out front and safe is Fangio, who did this aged 45 at the 1956 German Grand Prix.

**Total championships** \- an obvious one, but Max currently on four sharing with Vettel and Prost. He'll match Fangio's five if he wins in 2025. Again, Lewis is sharing top spot with Schumacher, and needs just one more to be out on his own.

**Most consecutive championships** \- Max has his four in one streak, putting him joing with Hamilton, Vettel, and Fangio. If he gets the fifth this year that's joint first with Schumacher's five in a row with Ferrari.

**Largest gap between titles** \- currently held by Lauda with six seasons between his 1977 and 1984 titles. Alsono would blow this out of the water if he won the championship in 2025, with a nineteen year gap since his 2006 win.

**Oldest World Drivers' Championship** \- Again, in the unlikely event of the above, Alsono would be second ahead of Farina (43 when he won in 1950) with only Fangio who was 46 when he won in 1957. If Hamilton wins the championship with Ferrari, he'll be the third oldest WDC ever, and the oldest F1 champion in Ferrari's history. 

**Longest time between first and last World Championship titles** \- Hamilton (12 years and 13 days between his 2008 and 2020 wins) could improve his own record here. Again, Alonso could smash this one by a long way.

**Most World Championship seasons before first title** \- If Hulkenburg won the championship (no laughing please) then he'd do so in his 15th season in F1, beating the 13 season record it took Mansell to get his first, and only, championship.

**Youngest quintuple World Championship winner** \- If Max takes the championship this year, he'll do so aged 28, taking the record of Schumacher who won his fifth at 33.

**Most wins in a driver's home country** \- Hamilton shares this record with Schumcher, both having nine wins in the UK and Germany respectively. If Hamilton wins at Silverstone, he takes this record as his own.

**Longest time between first and last wins** \- currently Hamilton with 17yrs 48 days between his 2007 Canadian GP win, and his win last year in Belgium. Alonso could smash this record if he wins at any point, taking his first win at Hungary in 2023, over 22 years ago.



A few constructors ones too, nothing major as in previous years Ferrari have most sewn up due to sheer longevity!

**Total races started** \- Sauber (483) will surpass Lotus (489) for fourth place. Red Bull (393, just popped into the top ten joint with Arrows last year) will surpass Brabham (394) and Renault (400) to take seventh place.

**Most consecutive races started** \- Red Bull, McLaren, and Williams, all currently on 385 each, will surpass Brabham on 392 to take fourth place. Interestingly Williams will not surpass themselves in third on 441. A prize for anyone who can work that one out!

**Total wins** \- Red Bull (currently 122) could surpass Mercedes on 129, with Mercedes wins being counted from their 1950s and current entry into the sport.

**Most races started without a win** \- HAAS are currently fourth on 190. If they don't win a race this year, they'll surpass Force India on 202. They're a long way off Minardi with 340, and Arrows with 383.

**Total 1–2 finishes** \- Red Bull have 31, and could pass Williams for fourth place with 33.

**Most podiums without a win** \- Aston Martin have 9 in third place, and could surpass Toyota with 13, and even BAR with 15.

**Total pole positions** \- Red Bull (103) could surpass Lotus (107) to take fifth place.

**Total 1–2 qualifying results** \- Mercedes took this from Ferrari recently. Merc currently on 84, Ferrari on 83, so it could easily chop and change again depending on how good each team's car is.

**Most races started without a pole position** \- Aston Martin are in fifth place with 95, just behind Ensign on 98. They could also take third place off Surtees with 118. 

**Most consecutive points finishes** \- Red Bull have an ongoing streak of 67 points finishes which started at the Saudi GP in 2022. They could possibly take this from Ferrari on 81. 



There's also a tyre record set to be broken this year - Pirelli have 485 F1 starts under their belt. As sole-supplier they will match Goodyear's 494 starts in Spain and surpass them in Canada, a record that has stood since 1998. Given Pirelli are guaranteed to win every race, they will be on 354 wins at the end of 2025, meaning they will pass Goodyear's 368 wins in 2026, though lets revisit that one next year!

Spain 1994 that he won stuck in gear: he said it took a couple of laps but it was a) the perfect gear to be stuck in and b) once he figured it out it was fine and c) it had amazing torque anyway. Like Ricciardo Monaco 2017/8/whenever he got stuck in gear: once you've figured it out, it's fine. \n\nSpain 1996, he just didn't know what other's problem was.
