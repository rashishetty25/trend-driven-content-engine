1mibr2x,Is Bortoleto the best rookie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mibr2x/is_bortoleto_the_best_rookie/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"In my opinion, what he’s been doing in a Sauber shows much more talent than all the other rookies this year. Since the start of the season, I already thought the best ones would be him—because he won the Formula 3 and Formula 2 titles in his rookie seasons—and Antonelli. However, Antonelli has been showing himself to be far inferior to his teammate. I believe it’s due to the pressure of starting in a big team like Mercedes, but to me, that makes Bortoleto the best rookie. That said, welcome back, Ayrton Senna.","['I think we’ll be watching Bortoleto in F1 for many years to come.\n\nHadjar has also been extremely impressive!', 'He could be. Hadjar started off strong.

Bearman had some flashes but overall Bortoleto has quietly made progress throughout the year and is showing his speed and consistency now that the car is somewhat competitive.\n\nHulkenberg is no slouch in quali and Bortoleto has just taken the lead in H2H. Bortoleto doesn’t have the race H2H yet I think but that’s expected from a rookie.

1miae1n,Bunch of facts about both Championships while coming into Summer break,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1miae1n/bunch_of_facts_about_both_championships_while/,2025-08-05, Statistics,"There is 274 points left in 2025 World Drivers' Championship (10 Grand Prix's and 3 Spirnts)

This means that Oliver Bearman, Franco Colapinto and Jack Doohan are officialy out of contention for this title.

Yuki Tsunoda is last driver eligible for the Championship as he currently has 10 points, while Oscar Piastri has 284, Tsunoda would win because he would have 10 wins compared to Piastri's 6 so far.

Oscar Piastri will not Max Verstappen's 2023 record of 575 points scored by a single driver as he can only get to 558 points if he would be flawless after the break.

Now some facts about World Constructor's Championship.

475 is the most points a team can get from last 10 Race Weekends.

This means that bottom 6 cannot win this year as Williams could only get to 545 points, which is 14 less than McLaren's current tally.

McLaren can miss out on only 34 points until the season ends if they want to be first team to get 1000 points, if they win it all they will earn 1034 in a single season.

This means they can only lose 3 races and all 3 sprints as they would lose 33 points that way.

The earliest possible race in which McLaren can win Constructor Championship is...

Azerbeijan

If McLaren has 3 more 1-2s and Ferrari would finish 3-4 that would put McLaren at 688 points and Ferrari at 341 (347 points gap). In remaining 7 Race Weeks there would be 346 ! points left so Ferrari could finish just 1 point behind McLaren.

In Q3, P1 - P6 only separated by 0.126s, assuming the ""lower rider height"" gains them 2 tenths, Leclerc on paper should only qualified P6 behind both Aston Martin, which means he will be stucked behind Alonso. If it's 3-4 tenths difference, Leclerc will qualify P8 which makes it worse. (Even if it's only 1 tenth gain, he qualifies P4, which he will eventually finish P4, exactly the same.)

From what we saw how the race goes, it's impossible to overtake Alonso if you are not McLaren, especially if Leclerc doesn't have that ""2-tenth"" advantage by lowering ride height. Given Ferrari's race strategy, they will probably choose a 2-stop behind the DRS train like Max did and get somewhere below P8 or even out of the points.

But with this ""plank gambling"", they got P4 eventually, has a shot to go for podium or even win (if there are some SC or VSC to keep the plank healthy so that they don't need more tyre pressure in the final stint).

""Hungaroring is just Monaco without walls."" Yes, the gambling didn't pay off this time because there is no SC / VSC, but they lost nothing (in terms of race result) and has everything to gain potentially by doing so. That's how teams play the rule if they don't have the best car.

From the moment Lewis Hamilton started karting, his father would stand next to the track and move further where his rivals would typically brake forcing Lewis to [mold his style of late braking](https://youtu.be/MOtvpi1aM-I).

Lewis tries to brake as late as possible often braking and turning at the same time and is also aggressive at corner entry. This usually results in the rear sliding mid corner and Lewis has to open up his steering to correct.
You can see this style clearly on his older onboard with the McLaren at [Turn 2](https://youtu.be/FJQ4QyJNuA8?t=22), and [Turn 13](https://youtu.be/FJQ4QyJNuA8?t=72).

The Mercedes Lewis dominated with had insane rear grip where he could throw the around car and it looks like it is glued on the track [1](https://youtu.be/rh6vBU-YNK0?t=19), [2](https://youtu.be/rh6vBU-YNK0?t=63), [3](https://youtu.be/SP3882i0H-0?t=28), [4](https://youtu.be/SP3882i0H-0?t=74).

Verstappen on the other hand prefers a very strong front end. Verstappen is not a late braker like Hamilton and he is conservative on corner entry. He prefers to do most of the car rotation mid corner [1](https://youtu.be/uvlHBDD2R2M?t=19), [2](https://youtu.be/uvlHBDD2R2M?t=64). 

More detailed explanation:[1](https://youtu.be/mS_IM7p4l18?t=42), [2](https://youtu.be/v0_da8T5wxc)","[""I find it weird that you first two examples, with two corners from Hungaroring are examples of small mistakes that needed correction. In both situations Lewis had to correct and lost time.\xa0\n\n\nI don't see how this is representative of his driving style, Lewis is one of the fastest F1\xa0drivers of all time and showing 2 examples in which he lost time doesn't really show that."", 'Max’s steering input look much smoother than lewis’s. Can anyone explain why? Or am i wrong in assuming this?', ""By the way, 'often braking and turning at the same time' is something that basically every race car driver in the world does. Its possibly the single most essential aspect of going fast. Although I get what you mean here, in that Lewis relies on it a bit more than others."", ""The guy you've linked in the detailed explanations at the end, does he have any credibility or relevant experience? I've seen him popping up on social feeds and I'm not sure I agree with a lot of what he says. He's often talking about idealised lines and being off them as a negative, despite as far as I can tell he's never actually driven anything close to an F1 car? More so that he has no idea of any of the current setups he's critiquing so how could he possible comment on what is the ideal line for a given car. \n\nHappy to be proven wrong if he has a long list storied past I'm unaware of."", ""I don't know why you think Hamilton like a stable rear. He does drive a more V shaped corner than some others, which doesn't seem to suit these cars or tyres, but he can handle the rear stepping out as well as anyone.\n\n[Autosport](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/how-hamilton-driving-style-compares-to-leclerc-as-he-adapts-to-ferrari-f1-car/10703039/)\n\n>One was maintaining braking stability when hitting the pedal very late that meant holding a car on the edge of under-rotation on corner entry, while he also puts in plenty of energy through the front tyres via many tiny movements as a turn progresses –\xa0all of which combines to leave the car moving around considerably at the rear end."", ""One of Max's greatest strengths is he just drives the damn car. If you watch the video he did with the Chris Harris he says that; he doesn't like the current F1 driving style but it's what he needs to do, he needs to adapt to the car.\n\nClearly Red Bull have made a decision on what makes their car quick from a design perspective. Max has the adaptability to mould his style to what is required."", ""I'd love to see how Verstappen goes in a Rally1 car since he likes these oversteery setups. Two time WRC champion Kalle Rovanperä tested a Red Bull F1 car, surely Max could test a GR Yaris Rally1, or a Puma Rally1 given the Ford-Red Bull partnership. (Ocon recently drove a Yaris Rally1 with Takamoto Katsuta at Goodwood, I imagine made possible by the Haas-Toyota Gazoo Racing partnership)"", '> Lewis tries to brake as late as possible often braking and turning at the same time\n\nI’m at work and can’t watch the videos, but every driver does this. It’s called trail braking, and even low-level amateur drivers do this. Not to be rude, but this is like Racing 101, and it really ruins your credibility if you don’t know absolute basics like this.\n\nI also think this whole analysis is a little flawed because Max has talked about how he approaches every car differently. Some cars require different lines than others, even within the same series. Max uses his extreme oversteer setups in the current Red Bull because that’s what’s needed to get the most performance out of it, not because he likes it.', '> Lewis tries to brake as late as possible often braking and turning at the same time\n\nevery F1 driver and even professional racing driver turns and brakes at the same time (not 100% each though), it\'s called ""trail braking""']",270,92,0.92,270,1141,1141,9,1,0.010000000000000009,9

1misto9,Race Production Decline,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1misto9/race_production_decline/,2025-08-06, Discussion,"I’m a newer fan. I started watching middle of 2023. I’ve watched every race since and have noticed a decline in the overall TV product on race day. As a newer fan I assumed it must be a me thing. I recently got F1TV and started in on the archived races, starting with 2021. Night and day difference.  I enjoy the production aspects of the race so much more. Tire decline rates, overtake probabilities, time differentials as pace off leader for most of the race, pit window graphics on every races. Zero 10s shots of girlfriends. They really did the technical aspects of the race so much better just four years ago. 

Apologies if this has been touched upon a lot but as someone newer to the sport, who hasn’t watched the past 10 years in sequence, the quality of the program has really gone down hill, and I want better. ","[""Look at this guy. He'd rather see all this than Lando's mom or drivers' girlfriends. \n\nI agree. The direction is horrible this year."", ""There's too many extreme close-ups, imo. They look very cool and cinematic, sure, but they give zero indication of what is actually happening on track.\n\n\nAside from that, it seems they almost never show what's happening outside of the top 4 and the big celebrity drivers, which is a shame as there's a lot of really competitive racing happening in the midfield. If Liberty wanted to reinvent F1 by having the audience feel like they can get invested in midfield drivers, wouldn't it make sense to actually show them?"", 'Agree.\n\nI watched Schumacher win championships and have watched every race since 2018(?). And while today\'s production is far superior to the 90\'s, production this year is particularly bad when compared to the last 5.\n\nIt feels like it is directed by someone who is not into racing. They don\'t seem to know what needs to be shown at what time. It\'s funny to hear the commentators give hints about what is exciting to watch.\n\nI assume that there were some personnel changes in the studio, and the new people are getting to grips with the ""sport"" aspect of Formula 1.

I don’t hate seeing the pitwall but I don’t really need it either. Just show me the damn race. More wide angle shots, more overheads, hell give me more PIP to show multiple battles. \n\nI also find the way they show replays to be so intrusive. We’ll watch a nothing overtake live then immediately watch the replay, then again in slow motion while the race is on.', ""Their timing on replays is also terrible.  In Hungary they cut away from the penultimate lap between Oscar and Lando for the lead to show a replay.  I was so furious I don't even recall who it was.  It ruined any tension because you couldn't watch whether Oscar could get close enough to have a legit shot at the overtake in the final DRS zone.  By the time they cut back I think Oscar was already .7 down on the final turn and it was immediately obvious he wouldn't have another chance at the overtake on the final lap."", ""My bit of a hot take that a third of the problems with F1 feeling boring could be solved with proper race cinematography, which over the years *really* got yanked out and lost to time.

It just look so much more exciting and lively and fresh. It isn't JUST the fish eye lens thing - but the way things are being filmed as well.\n\nCurrent F1 has way too many slow, focused, panned out shots of cars approaching and going round corners making them look *painfully* sluggish. I am absolutely aware of WHY that is - gotta maximise that sponsorship air time and  make sure the viewer can actually see them on a car going 200+ kph as clearly as possible.

1mihshx,Are you a driver fan or a team fan first in F1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mihshx/are_you_a_driver_fan_or_a_team_fan_first_in_f1/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"As someone who’s relatively new to Formula 1, I’ve been thinking a lot about whether I’m more of a driver fan or a team fan, and I’ve realized I’m definitely a driver first fan.

It was actually Lando Norris who pulled me into the sport. His social media presence, humor, and down-to-earth vibe really stood out to me and made F1 feel more accessible. From watching clips of him joking around with other drivers to getting a glimpse into his personality off the track, I got curious about the actual races, and now I’m completely hooked. I’ve been diving deep into past seasons, race highlights, team rivalries, and everything in between.

That said, I’ve always had a soft spot for Ferrari too. Growing up in the U.S., my exposure to F1 was limited, but I still knew about Michael Schumacher. He was a legend, and as someone with German heritage, I always admired him. Most of my motorsports background comes from watching NASCAR as a kid, since that was way more mainstream here in the States, but Schumacher and Ferrari still managed to break through that and grab my attention.

So now I find myself rooting for Lando first, but also hoping Ferrari can get back to being dominant. If Lando ever switches teams, I’d follow him without question. But there’s still that nostalgic pull toward Ferrari that keeps them as a secondary favorite for me.

Curious how others feel about this. Are you more of a driver fan or a team fan? And what originally pulled you into F1?","['Ferrari but I care a bit more about how Charles finishes but not so one sided ike 60/40 maybe', ""I'm just an F1 fan, moreso than any particular team or driver.

1mi9y6c,A look back at MasterCard Lola. The F1 team that participated in only one qualifying session and then retired from Formula 1.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mi9y6c/a_look_back_at_mastercard_lola_the_f1_team_that/,2025-08-05, Throwback,"MasterCard Lola was a British team that entered Formula 1 in 1997 with the car T97/30. Their drivers were Vincenzo Sospiri and Ricardo Rosset. In the first race of the 1997 season, the Australian Grand Prix, the cars were too slow to qualify for the race. According to the regulations in force at the time, if a car did a lap time in qualifying that was 107% slower than the time of the pole position holder, it would not enter the race. And since the cars of MasterCard Lola were 11 and 13 seconds slower, they failed to qualify in the race. Later, they tried to fix the problems of their car with some testing at Silverstone. Their attempt didn't help them become as fast as they wanted and even though they went to Interlagos for the Brazilian Grand Prix, they retired due to financial and technical issues, as they stated. Not so much later, MasterCard Lola completely withdrew from Formula 1, saddled with £6 million in debt.","['I quite liked the livery', 'IIRC, the original plan was to enter in 1998 for the new regs but they got pushed (I want to say by Mastercard but might be wrong) to enter a year earlier, giving them something stupid like 100 days to build an F1 team from scratch. \n\nThe car was based off an Indy chassis and a complete dog that hadn’t even been inside a wind tunnel.

The push into F1 was probably due to the fact they had such a massive investor as Mastercard on board. When Mastercard left,  they incurred massive debt, which couldn't be paid off and killed Lola entirely. \n\n\nThe unfortunate side effect of all this was that Vincenzo Sospiri never raced again in F1, despite being great in lower formulae.\n\n\nBut good news is Lola is now back, under new management, and racing in Formula E.""]",6,5,1.0,6,5,5,2,2,0.0,2

Does anyone reading this have audio that the owner is fine with me using or is from a YouTube video long enough for the clip to be considered fair use? The cars using the BRM H16 engine are the BRM P83, BRM P115, and the Lotus 43.
