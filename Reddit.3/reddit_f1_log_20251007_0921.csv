As a multi-generational fan of F1, I’m going to stand on my soap box and say I think that the inability of cars to follow other cars, and it’s impact on overtaking, is the worst In F1 history. The regulatory change was beyond ineffective.

If we cast our minds back to the 2021 season and broadly that era of cars, we saw plenty of
 on-track battles for points and wins.

2025 in particular has turned F1 into a qualifying formula, where we leave a weekend often unsure of who had the fastest car on a Sunday. The kind of lap time delta’s we have needed to see at many tracks to overtake (most recently Baku and Singapore) seem well over 1 second per lap. Aside from the first couple of corners, we are being robbed of results being decided on a Sunday, or the fastest driver on a Sunday winning races. 

One example, which is not like-for-like by remarkably similar: Hungary 2019, Hamilton pits from second to fresh tyres due to lack of ability to pass Max, catches him and passes for the win. 2025 Piastri pits from the lead, 3 laps earlier than Lewis did in 2019, and got stuck in the dirty air.

China, Spain, Monza and Spa show that it's not just the street tracks. Therefore, the delta between cars is minimal.\n\n\\- The field is closer than it's ever been, which means the delta is minimal.\n\nIn previous years, for example 2018, we had much more tyre deg and much larger gaps between cars, so we had more overtaking."", 'No the dirty air problem is smaller than pre 2022, but car parity is higher. What we see is cars far closer in performance, sorted by their performance (ie. qualifying and locking adaptations afterwards) and then be surprised that there is little overtaking going on beyond the start.', 'Not even close lol. A bigger part of the problem is actually that the cars are really close in performance now. You cant get that overtake delta anymore', ""Did you forget the field is about as close as it's been? Top 5 in qualifying often separated by 1-2 tenths.\n\nYes, dirty air is quite bad. But I refuse to believe that cars that rely way more on ground effect have more outwash and worse dirty air than the ones before them. How is that even possible? No, the dirty air is less than previous regulation cycle but the cars are also closer in pace.\n\nThat said dirty air has dramatically increased since 2022. That's for damn sure.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why bother with prescriptive rules when the teams will always find a way. Why not instead just have a metric. E.g. your CFD model needs to have no more than X amount of dirty air. i.e. regulate dirty air with a metric rather than by prescribing design. And then have more permissive design as long as it complies with the dirty air metric, all good."", 'Not even close. You were lucky to be following anywhere within 2-3 seconds on the previous generation of cars on this track. They can follow at least half that currently.', 'Did...   did you have ChatGPT write this post for you?', 'I don’t think it’s any worse than it has been before, it just so happens these cars are not as nimble in the corners where big divebombs regularly occurred. It was better in prior ground effect era years like 2022 or 2023 but continually adding downforce produces this outcome. \n\nFIA backed off completely on their policing of dirty air generating components. I would expect a 2022-esque season next year when the cars are still in their infancy.']",0,72,0.4,0,461,461,0,0,0.0,0
