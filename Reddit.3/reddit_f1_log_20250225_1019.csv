I agree that Raikkonen probably had a better peak. My question is, who had lower lows? Raikkonen had more longevity so we've seen him go from the sharp to the back end, whereas Hakkinen retired closer to his prime.\n\nAs a hypothetical, how long would Ron Dennis have kept DC and Hakkinen as his pair if Hakkinen decided to stay? Surely Raikkonen was too good to pass up? Maybe Raikkonen eventually makes Hakkinen his no.2 like Alonso and Vettel did to him."", ""What was Nigel Mansell's greatest year in F1? The obvious candidates are 1986, 1987 and 1992. But this question could obviously extend to his other seasons as well."", 'Patiently waiting for leaked pics of the Red Bull today. Think they are doing a filming day', 'We are less than 24 hours from the start of preseason testing. Who else is going to be watching tomorrow?', ""I've clearly got to go for 1995"", 'In my opinion, one of 1986 (where he went toe toe with Piquet), 1989 (where he outperformed Berger and got the best win of his career in Hungary) or 1992 (where he thrashed Patrese the whole season). 1987 was good but a little difficult to judge exactly because Piquet was visually impaired for the vast majority of the season and therefore not as good as he was previously.', 'Rumor has it, they have gone for a radical redesign of their floor, which is, unfortunately, not visible in any pics.', ""I'm going to just have it on in the background as a podcast. It's not very interesting to watch but I enjoy the pundits  just talking about anything and everything."", ""It's testing - so 6 hours of dead air with pundits grabbing at everything possible to kill the time and 2 hours of speculation from pundits and posts declaring who ever set the fastest lap time that hour as the season winner and everyone else as a failure.  \n  \nI'll join once we get to a race."", 'I wake up at 2am (midwest USA) to write code before my children get up so its the perfect mix of background noise but not actually entertaining enough to heavily distract me.']",0,10,0.5,0,10,10,0,4,0.0,0
1ix1lcv,Carlos Sainz’s ‘two top drivers’ dig after Red Bull snub,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ix1lcv/carlos_sainzs_two_top_drivers_dig_after_red_bull/,2025-02-24, News,,"[""Ahh we're back with the clickbait titles.\nHe didn't say this randomly and was referring to Williams and their line up when talking about this and what he would do if he was the team principal."", "">“Lando and I, Charles and I or Alex and I – two top drivers,” Sainz told\xa0\n\nLando and Charles yes. Alex? We'll see about that."", ""When Sainz left they had Verstappen paired with Ricciardo, I think it's fair to say those where two top drivers, probably more so than Verstappen + Sainz would be.\n\nAfter that they promoted from within, with little success.\n\nAfter that, they signed a top mid-field driver, who was at the time comfortably the strongest driver not already locked in with a team. Nobody really forsaw the total collapse he had.\n\nI don't think you can say Red Bull actively avoided having a strong driver next to Verstappen, they've not really had better options. Except maybe Sainz this year, but then is there really much reason to assume he'd do better than Perez? They tried getting a respected experienced driver from the outside and it didn't work out at all, why try the same thing again instead of promoting from within like they used to do?"", ""What Sainz is conveniently not thinking of is that you get someone like Verstappen or MSC once in a lifetime in your team. So it's best to do build everything around them. But no active driver would want to acknowledge this."", 'His statement will look a little bit weird in hindsight if Lawson is closer to Verstappen than Albon was.', 'I mean,  Marko (I know that old wind bag is full of shit) said about driver #2.  \n\n“He should become a consistent points scorer and help Max when he needs to, not try to,” he told”\n\nThat’s why they didn’t sign Carlos.  He is not that.', 'If Albon is deemed to be a top driver like Sainz claims, surely Lawson would be in the same category as a top driver?', ""Basically as we observed last year: because if you won't win the WCC, you could well win the WDC.\n\nMarko himself observed similar a while ago, that if the top 4 teams are very close in 2025, then being clear #1 is a massive advantage for Verstappen."", ""RBR wants to keep Max happy so he doesn't leave.  And the way to do that is to continue to give him weak 2nd drivers.  To be mentioned among the all-time greats one needs to have very good 2nd teammates to challenge them -- to really show the world how great they are.  Otherwise, it will always be: It was the car.  In this case: it was always Newey.""]",0,104,0.49,0,601,601,0,0,0.0,0
