It happened on Sunday, June 9, 1957. Car races were also held on the dune circuit that day. In one of them, Willem Adriaan Gerlach, a doctor from the village Appelscha, started in his Porsche 1600 S. Shortly before the end of the race, however, he lost control of the car in the first corner after the Tarzan corner. The car rolled over three times and, according to a journalist from the Leeuwarder Courant, ended up in a potato field.  
  
Gerlach was thrown from the car. Unconscious, the driver was taken to the Sint Elisabethgasthuis hospital in Haarlem. There, his condition proved so serious that he died of his injuries that night.  
  
Gerlach was 47 years old. He had run a general practice in Appelscha since 1940, also serving residents of Fochteloo and Zorgvlied. He left behind a wife and three children. The bend where the fatal accident occurred was later named the Gerlach corner.  
  
The accompanying photo of Gerlach's crashed car appeared in several newspapers on Tuesday, June 11, 1957,  
","[""Other guys that had corners named after them in Zandvoort weren't doing much better in that regard. \n\nThe Slotemakerbocht is named after Rob Slotemaker, who suffered a fatal neck injury in a race at the track in 1979.

I understand the principles of both in general terms, but in Formula 1 the tow does not appear during the race so to speak as it seems to be the case in Nascar. So does it depend on distance, time behind part of track? ","['Simply: \nCorners - dirty air.\nStraights - tow. \n\nIt‚Äôs more nuanced than that, but that‚Äôs the ELI5 version.', 'It\'s technically always dirty air. Dirty air is all the air behind a car which messes with the aerodynamics of the car behind, reducing both its downforce and its drag at the same time.\n\nBut in the corners, you don\'t want to lose your downforce, so its bad there.\n\nIn the straights, you don\'t need the downforce, but you could use less drag, so it\'s good there.\n\nBut in both cases the air is ""dirty"". We just call it a tow because the dirty air reduces drag and ""tows"" you. You want that on the straight. You don\'t want it in the corners.', 'When you WANT downforce (corners)  it‚Äôs dirty air, when you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs a tow (straight)', 'The car in front is punching a hole in the air. On the straights, this reduces the air resistance for the car behind, so the following car can go faster that‚Äôs called a tow or slipstream. But in the corners, Formula 1 cars need clean airflow to push them into the ground and create grip. The disturbed air from the car ahead (dirty air) reduces that grip, making it harder for the car behind to corner as fast.', ""It's a tow on the straight, dirty air in the corners. You want downforce in the corners. Dirty air reduces downforce."", 'Being behind a car in ‚Äòdirty air‚Äô reduces your downforce. This is bad for corners but good on the straights. \n\nSo that‚Äôs why drivers don‚Äôt want to stay in the dirty air for long during a race. Because with lower downforce, they will slide more, go slower, and wear out the tyres more quickly when going though corners. \n\nIt‚Äôs more of a disadvantage in high speed corners where downforce is more important.', 'Simplest terms in a straight line or oval like nascar tow, anything involving braking zones and turns dirty air.', 'Really both are different words that can be summarized under one word: wake\n\nIt\'s usually referred to as dirty air in the corners, as a negative thing you don\'t want  \nAnd as tow on the straights, because in that circumstance you WANT that hole punched in the air, so positive\n\nBut really it just boils down to ""wake""', 'The slipstream effect is less pronounced in F1 compared to NASCAR because F1 cars have a lot more air flowing ‚Äúthrough‚Äù them, whereas NASCAR cars are more like bricks that completely push the air out of the way rather than forcing it over aerodynamic surfaces.', 'There‚Äôs a video of Pierre Gasly on the front straight at Baku, and when he gets into the tow (also dirty air) you can see how turbulent the air actually is. His steering wheel shakes pretty significantly all while he is getting faster. This video always makes me think of how they are the same.']",32,13,0.75,32,13,13,4,2,-0.010000000000000009,4

In truth, he was probably promoted to Formula 2 a season early, but he really could not afford another year in Formula 3 because so many of the drivers he had been racing also stepped up. His second season was considerably better, probably because he switched to Campos and formed some really good relationships there, but the damage was done.

I noticed that a lot when the Red Bulls are braking into the pits.

I get why sports cars pop and crackle on startup or when revving, but what exactly causes F1 cars to backfire so much while slowing down?

People tend to think they don't because we rarely see actual flames, but if you really pay attention during a night race, you will see the flames. The ignition of small amounts of fuel simply just happens deeper inside the exhaust pipe rather than on the edge."", 'MISFIRINGUH SYSTEMUH...', ""This is the answer guys. On F2 cars it's called the anti-lag system, and it's why they shoot flames out the exhaust when downshifting.\n\nIf you watched the F1 movie, this was the biggest giveaway (other than size/proportions) that the APX movie cars were actually F2 and not F1. In fact, rather than painting out the flames in editing, they actually added fake flames to some of the other real F1 cars, presumably for consistency because they liked the dramatic look.""]",15,20,0.8,15,19,19,11,11,0.13,11
