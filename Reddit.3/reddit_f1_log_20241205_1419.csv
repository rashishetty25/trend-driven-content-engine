MARCA wanted to know if Fernando agrees that he uses this two-faced attitude, since he had a run-in in Australia and was sanctioned for the Mercedes driver\'s statement.\n\n‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so. I think George is a great driver, a great person and I‚Äôm good friends with George as well, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs just showing different faces here and there. I think it‚Äôs more about what I think Max probably agrees with me in that I said many times that some of the penalties are a bit not consistent, like if you have that episode in Qatar and then you go to the next event and you replicate exactly the same episode, you can induce that episode by driving, then you don‚Äôt get the same result in terms of penalties, so that‚Äôs the frustration that we sometimes have,‚Äù he says about penalties that are applied once and then they don‚Äôt come back again.\n\n""They\'ve recently changed the race director and also some of the people in the stewards\' room, so I hope all those changes are for the better and to improve this consistency that we\'re asking for .

This calendar doesn‚Äôt allow you to rest or have time to think. You are racing continuously so, yes, it wasn‚Äôt easy, it wasn‚Äôt difficult to get motivation, but, yes, in a way I am used to not having the best car, so I think I once had the best Toyota car in the WEC in 25 years of racing, so I am always motivated.‚Äù\n\nMelbourne, the 25th anniversary of the first race with Minardi\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really care, you know, it‚Äôs not a big deal, I‚Äôm just enjoying this part of my career and I still feel fast and motivated and I‚Äôm enjoying with the team, the progress, the good things, but also the bad things, where we try to learn from them. We‚Äôll soon start working with great people that I admire, like Adrian Newey, Enrico (Cardile) will join the team also soon, like Andy Cowell recently.

I think this year we also showed everyone that it‚Äôs difficult to improve the car, because the cars have become very sensitive to changes and very critical in some areas where even improvements are no longer a guarantee that they will make the car faster. Running so low and so close to the ground and some of the kerbs are also a bit difficult for the car, we can lose even parts of the car when we go over the kerbs, so this kind of fragile aspect of the cars is not very good in terms of having fun driving or attacking in qualifying laps or in the race. But yeah, I think it was no different than last year or 2022 when we introduced this ground effect, so this year was just another one of these.‚Äù\n\nHappy to be done or would you rather continue?\n\n‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs over, I think it‚Äôs a very long season for everyone, for the mechanics, for everyone in the team, 24 races is ultra demanding, especially the last triple we did. I think for Max it ended when he won in Las Vegas and for us probably after the summer. We were already fifth in the championship, with no threats from behind and the remaining seven or eight races have been a bit long. We try to learn about the car for next year‚Äôs project but apart from that there‚Äôs not much to do, so yeah, I‚Äôm happy to take the winter break now and start from scratch next year and hopefully be more competitive. The motivation is different when you finish Abu Dhabi and start next year‚Äôs car and next year‚Äôs simulator work and everything than just coming in, knowing that we‚Äôll be ninth to twelfth here and maybe we can correct the starting positions on Sunday.

He wasn't a different driver in 2014 compared to 2013. He was the same 4-time WDC driver, with the same talent. The only thing that changed, **was the car.** \n\nWas it a bad car? **NO.** Could a driver perform with it? **Yes**, look how Daniel beat him in his 'debut' season with RBR. \n\nAnd yet, Vettel **struggled** with the car, regardless of the Renault engine's disappointment. \n\nVettel didn't lose his speed and talent overnight. The car simply did **not** suit him. \n\nSure, to adapt to that new style of 2014 which didn't suit his driving style 'much' didn't help and i'm sure that also had an effect on confidence which really impacts things like a domino effect.\n\nHamilton, after 2021, **especially** losing out the WDC the way it went, has had an impact. It would be no different to anyone, from Vettel, Alonso, Verstappen, etc. But it's not unlike Vettel post-2013. Vettel @ Ferrari revitalized and showed he still had it. **He may not have managed another WDC with Ferrari, and maybe Hamilton won't either.**\n\nLet's see what happens with Max in 2026. He's on a high now, but the whole car change **and** if RBR could go a bad direction in 2016, might be a Vettel and a Hamilton repeat all over again, Perhaps Max will have 5 titles by then though, but it's **very** possible that this happens. \n\nAnybody claiming Max would have 'lost it' after 2025, and say 'it was just the car' is **bonkers** and **ignorant.**\n\nJust like with Vettel 2014, RBR didn't build the car the way they built it around Seb and built a (fast) car with a disappointing engine that could not follow the rules that made the Vettel era with RBR so succesful and had to 'compromise' building a car that's good enough for **both**, which just happened to fit Ricciardo better than Seb.\n\n2022 onwards, not only did Mercedes make a dog of a car that had huge porpoising problems, they built a car that doesn't suit Hamilton and suits George more. Then, Hamilton announced his departure, and Mercedes bailed on anything Hamilton and went with George instead.\n\nThere's a **real good chance** that you'll see Hamilton perform outstanding again in 2025 with Ferrari from the get go. **Vettel beat Raikkonen in his debut year @ Ferrari and finished P3, with a 128 points lead on Kimi.** \n\nVettel's 2014 results had nobody expecting or believing that, and Kimi ain't no slouch. \n\nThere's literally **no reason** to think Hamilton couldn't do exactly the same trick. \n\nAnd final note: maybe, just maybe, the current format really doesn't suit Hamilton. So in his debut year with Ferrari, maybe it won't come to fruits as they hope. But maybe, just maybe, the 2026 rules actually suits Hamilton perfectly and he's gonna dominate again.\n\n**time will tell**"", 'Unless you are under the impression that Mercedes is ‚Äúsabotaging‚Äù Lewis‚Äôs car, which wouldn‚Äôt make sense given his performances on Sunday‚Ä¶\n\nI think it‚Äôs probably his driving style not matching the W15.

Verstappen scored the highest for the weekend with a 9.2. Norris was not in the top 10, meaning that at best he scored a tenth under Bottas, which would give him a 6.9. Funny enough they post the below Leaderboard

So, Verstappen is equal with Norris with no change in position. Should Verstappen not have either been 2nd (so change is +1) or if he was equal with Norris, should Norris not fall to 2nd?

Even if we look at the best possible Qatar-score for Norris (6.9) that is a difference with Verstappen his score of 2.3. Divide that by 23 races and you get exactly 0.1.
