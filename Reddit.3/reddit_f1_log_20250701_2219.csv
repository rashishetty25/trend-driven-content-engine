Poached from Aston Martin on February 17, 2022, he will have only experienced 38 Grands Prix with the Enstone team . Brunon Famin, his replacement, had a one-year interim, logically shorter, but still longer than Oliver Oakes\' ten months on the pit wall.\n\n>The ejection seat of the Alpine principal position never left enough time for a single decision-maker. Between July 2023 and May 2025, the team had more different team principals than regular drivers. This lack of stability has seriously hampered the team\'s development in its quest for results in Formula 1 .\n\n>The 60-year-old Romanian-American was not helped by Luca de Meo, then head of the Renault group , and his demands for short-term results. ""I only spoke to him three times , "" he confided in an interview with The Race. ""  At one point he was very enthusiastic about poaching me from Aston Martin. He told me he needed someone with F1 experience. He seemed keen to do things right.""\n\n\n>Szafnauer joined Force India in 2009, when the team was sitting second to last in the standings with no points scored at the end of the previous season. He contributed to the team\'s gradual comeback, climbing the standings each year: 7th in 2010, 6th in 2011, 2012 and 2013, 5th in 2015 and 4th in 2016 and 2017.\n\n>Bought by Lawrence Stroll and renamed Racing Point in 2018, the team even achieved its first victory with Sergio P√©rez\'s comeback at the Sakhir Grand Prix in 2020. This performance was confirmed once the team moved to Aston Martin with a podium finish for Sebastian Vettel in 2021 in Baku (then a second in Hungary) and nine for Fernando Alonso in 2023.\n\n>Szafnauer will not have had the same opportunity at Alpine, in particular because of Luca de Meo\'s expectations. ""The last time I spoke to him was in Montreal in 2023 [four rounds before his ousting in Belgium, Editor\'s note]. I explained to him that it would take time to implement a paradigm shift within the team. I told him how long it would take, to which he replied, \'I don\'t have that time.

One of them was leading Apple\'s simulation program in Cupertino, among the best simulation engineers in the world.""\n\n>A resentment relieved by the difficulties encountered by Alpine since his departure, which Szafnauer almost welcomes. ""I\'m not pointing out anything that people can\'t see for themselves ,"" the Romanian-American exonerates himself. "" You only have to look at the constructors\' standings: they\'re last this year. It just shows that bad decisions by management always cause bad results on the track.""\n\n>The Italian\'s recent surprise resignation from his post as Renault Group CEO came as a surprise to Otmar Szafnauer.

Renault and Alpine\'s future in F1, he said, remains ""in the hands of the new guy. When Carlos Ghosn was there, he made the decisions for F1. Maybe [Flavio] Briatore is right and it won\'t change anything at all, I don\'t know.""\n\n\n>Amid rumors of Alpine\'s sale, given its recent performance, the Romanian-American can only point to the brand\'s philosophy and the team\'s financial results: ""I think Alpine will only sell electric cars in the near future. So there\'s not a big correlation between track and production vehicles,"" he comments. "" Maybe they\'ll say, \'We bought this team for next to nothing and it\'s now worth a billion and a half. Why not sell?\'""\n\n>Coming from a former team manager claiming to be supported by a manufacturer for a new team project, the message seems almost inciting.', '>I explained to him that it would take time to implement a paradigm shift within the team. I told him how long it would take, to which he replied, \'I don\'t have that time. It has to happen faster.\'\n\n""It has to be faster. 18 women then. 36?

So lotus ran with 1 and 2. Tyrrell finished second in 73 so took 3 and 4 for 1974. Tyrrell kept those numbers until the 1990s. 

McLaren finished third and so took numbers 5 and 6 for 1974

And so on. 

Questions: at what point did Williams get car 5/6?

And why did Ferrari get numbers 27 and 28? Going by 1973 standings they‚Äôd get 11 and 12 in 1974

","[""The way this worked is that the WDC's team got #1 and #2 and gave its previous numbers to the previous year's WDC team.\n\nFerrari did start out with #11 and #12 in 1974. Scheckter won the WDC in 1979, stayed with the team so Ferrari had #1 and #2 in 1980. Williams (Jones) who had #27 and #28 won the WDC that year, so they were #1 and #2 in 1981 and Ferrari got #27 and #28 from them.\n\nInitially Lotus had #5 and #6 and exchanged those numbers with Brabham in 1979 (Lauda was #1 in 1978, Andretti in 1979). Williams (Jones) had #1 and #2 in 1981 and exchanged numbers with Brabham in 1982 after Piquet had won the WDC. Then #5 and #6 went back and forth between them again in 1983 and 1984."", ""I'm sure someone else will come in with concrete dates, but I believe there was a time when Ferrari paid lower positioned teams so they could run a consistent number, although I forget which years they did this"", ""I believe the 1-2 would always go to the team which had the driver's champion of the previous year and you would swap numbers with the other team if that changed.\n\nFor example:\n\nGoing into 1978 Brabham were #1-2 due Niki Lauda winning the 1977 title with Ferrari and then moving to Brabham.      \nMario Andretti won the 1978 title for Lotus driving number #5.        \nSo in 1979 Lotus took the #1-2 and Brabham inherited the #5-6.      \nIn 1979 Jody Scheckter won for Ferrari using the number #11.       \nSo in 1980 Ferrari took the #1-2 and Lotus inherited the #11-12     \nIn 1980 Alan Jones won for Williams driving number #27.     \nSo in 1981 Williams took the #1-2 and Ferrari inherited the #27-28."", ""The numbers would usually only change depending on what team the reigning WDC drove for, which was usually the same team they won with. The dethroned champion team would take the numbers of the new champions for the following season.\n\nFerrari had 11/12 for 1974, though they gave those to McLaren following Lauda's WDC win in 1975. Of course Hunt won in 1976, so for 1977, Ferrari were 11/12 again and kept those until the end of 1979 as Lauda took 1/2 to Brabham for 1978.\n\nIn 1979, Ferrari won the WDC and WCC with Jody Scheckter and so were 1/2 in 1980.\n\nWilliams, as a relatively new team, were 27/28 in 1980, but won both championships that year, and so swapped with Ferrari for 1981. That's how Ferrari ended up with 27/28.\n\nFerrari kept those numbers until 1990 when the reigning WDC Alain Prost joined them so they got 1/2, with 27/28 being swapped with McLaren (who had 1/2 in 1989). Senna and McLaren took both titles in 1990 and so for 1991, McLaren and Ferrari swapped back, with the red cars being 27/28 again.\n\nWith Prost swapping teams with Berger for 1990, and the two teams swapping numbers too, Berger drove the #28 Ferrari in 1989 and then the #28 McLaren in 1990.\n\nI do find it funny 27/28 are associated with Ferrari when both Williams and McLaren won championships with those numbers but Ferrari didn't.\n\nI'm sorry I've made this a confusing mess.\n\nAs for Williams. They got 5/6 in 1982 when Nelson Piquet won the WDC in Brabham, so Williams took Brabhams numbers. Funnily enough, the two teams swapped between 1/2 and 5/6 for three consecutive seasons in 1982, 1983 and 1984. \n\nWilliams keeping the 5/6 from 1984 right up to the end of 1992. Though Piquet won the WDC for them in 1987, he moved to Lotus for 1988 and took 1/2 there, and so Williams kept the 5/6 for that year.\n\nTheir next WDC was Nigel Mansell in 1992, but he left F1 to race in CART for 1993, but despite there being no reigning WDC on the grid for 1993, Williams were given top-billing anyway but took 0/2 instead of 1/2. \n\nWith Prost winning the 1993 WDC and immediately retiring, Williams kept 0/2 into 1994 as well, before taking Benetton's 5/6 in 1995 following Schumacher's 1994 WDC win."", ""And Damon Hill used #0 at Williams in 1993 and 1994 as the previous year's champion left Formula 1 (Mansell? then Prost) who were both with Williams."", ""They did get 11 & 12 for 1974.  \n  \nThe 27 & 28 happened in 1980 if i recall correctly, as in 1979 Scheckter won the championship, so Ferrari got 1 & 2 for 1980.  \n Williams was '27' and '28'. But Williams won the championship in 1980, so they swapped with Ferrari. (Williams 1 & 2 for 1981 - Ferrari 27 & 28).  \n  \nSame happened with Prost moving to Ferrari in 1990 - meaning Ferrari swapped 27&28 with McLaren to 1&2, and after Senna won with McLaren they swapped it back."", ""From 1974 to 1996 the car numbers were permanent. The team with the reigning WDC would swap their numbers with #1 and #2 from the previous WDC team. The old WDC team would keep those numbers forever as long as they didnt have the reigning WDC on their team for the next season.\n\nFerrari initially got #11-12 in 1974. Then the history was more or less like that:\n\n* 1976 - Ferrari gets 1-2 due to Lauda winning the WDC in '75, they swap #11-12 with McLaren who had the '74 WDC (Fittipaldi)\n* 1977 - Hunt won in '76 with McLaren, they swap their numbers again\n* 1978 - Lauda won in '77, but he moves to Brabham, therefore Ferrari kept the #11-12\n* 1980 - Schekter won in '79, so Ferrari now gets #1-2\n* 1981 - Alan Jones won the WDC in '80 for Williams, who ran #27-28. Ferrari being the team of the previous WDC gets Williams numbers. Ferrari never won a WDC again for a long time so they kept it.\n* 1990 - Ferrari signs reigning WDC Alain Prost, so they get #1-2 swapping numbers with McLaren\n* 1991 - Just like in '77, McLaren wins the WDC straight away, this time with Senna, so Ferrari gets their old numbers back\n* 1996 - Ferrari signs the reigning WDC again, this time Schumacher, they get #1-2\n* 1997 - Numbering system changed, now changes every year based on previous WCC position. Ferrari finished second, so they get #3-4. From this year onwards, numbers arent permanent anymore, until 2014 when they changed to the current numbers tied to the driver instead of the team."", 'Also interesting, thanks. I knew they swapped numbers with the reigning WDC team but hadn‚Äôt realised Williams started off with 27/28. \n\nThat answer the Ferrari question. \n\nThough wiki says McLaren‚Äôs had 5/6 in 1974, not brabham. \n\nPart of my reason for asking the question is that I seem to remember Williams ALWAYS had numbers 5/6. It felt that way anyway but then they only won one WDC between 1982 and 1992 and Piquet went to lotus the year after that, so they stick with 5/6. \n\nMeanwhile every year McLaren won the WDC (which they did once or twice between 84 and 91), they took numbers 1/2 the following year and so Williams stuck with 5/6 for quite a while \n\nThat would answer the Williams question I guess', 'Thanks, that‚Äôs interesting.

There have been numerous articles defending why Doohan should not be dropped (I agree with them though) but the coverage around Colapinto feels disproportionately critical. They repeatedly bring up his sponsor‚Äôs missing payments, last year‚Äôs poor performances and crashes, and even connect him to Oakes‚Äô rumored departure after the driver swap with Jack. They also reported a supposed meeting between Perez and Alpine involving Colapinto's exit after 2 or 3 races, which never actually happened (Checo's manager said so). Now the Bottas rumors are added to the mix. I don't recall any other driver facing this level of scrutiny from the race, not even now Yuki or before Liam in RBR."", 'Flavio is just throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks?', 'Poor Colapinto.\xa0He‚Äôs been better than Doohan was.

In every parameter he is either equal or better. Finished the full 5 races, 1 crash vs 2 heavy crashes, 2 times in Q2, 1 time beat Gasly, delta closer to Gasly in qualy and have a good race pace (better than Gasly during the last 2 races in some parts). Colapinto's performance last year may have tarnished our expectations thinking he will be either be better than Pierre or scoring points. Also the car is now worse than the first 6 races where Pierre was consistently close to top 10. The key point is that Colapinto has been a **marginal** **upgrade** to Doohan so far. It's debatable whether they should've kept Jack in the seat because they are basically destroying 2 careers: Jack being replaced and Colapinto not performing under the current circumstances."", 'rather lighty? he was signed for 5 races and has been already replaced by the press for checo, then aron, then doohan again and now bottas']",0,29,0.22,0,21,21,0,3,-0.010000000000000009,0
1loyua3,"F1¬Æ: The Movie, women, and the collective sigh of disappointment",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1loyua3/f1_the_movie_women_and_the_collective_sigh_of/,2025-07-01, News,,"['I mean overall I like the movie but ngl the way the Kate the TD was portrayed in that movie was atrocious. The Vegas romance between her and Sonny was so unnecessary and she somehow failed to make the car into anything other than a shitbox for more than 2 years until Sonny basically gave her a breakthrough idea in like his first month there.', 'Yeah having Jodie being schooled by Sonny immediately on how to do her job and the pit girl being useless had me rolling my eyes.', ""I think this is emblematic of the biggest issue in the film: it is simply trying to do too much and so it does not really give itself the opportunity to do any one thing well. Here are all of the subplots that the film is trying to juggle:\n\n* Sonny's habit of racing despite his injuries.\n* Sonny's hostile relationship with the press.\n* Pearce trying to make a name for himself as quickly as possible.\n* Ruben's efforts to manage the relationship between the drivers.\n* Banning's attempt to hijack the team.\n* Kate's struggle to make it in Formula 1.\n* Jodie's lack of confidence potentially letting the team down.\n\nThere are just so many subplots that the film's only solution is to work through them as quickly as possible. Take the team itself -- APX is clearly able to attract world-class talent, since Kasper was a team principal at Ferrari and Kate worked at Lockheed-Martin. The film seems to be aiming for the idea that APX has everything it needs for a breakthrough, but they just cannot get the stars to align. However, it then gets distracted by off-track -- and worse, off-camera -- politics that threaten to undermine the team. Its solution to this problem is to have Sonny say a few words of encouragement to Jodie and then have the team go for a run together and suddenly they all work well. Check that box and then move on to the next subplot that needs to be resolved. Sometimes these things fit together pretty well; Sonny's relationship with and management of the team is in contrast to Pearce's, which fuels the tension between them. But because another subplot comes up, the film has no time to breathe.\n\nA character like Kate had the potential to be interesting. She gave up a career working for Lockheed-Martin to join Formula 1, chasing those few tenths of a second that could make the team great. It costs her everything, but she persists because she loves it, even though she cannot explain why. She is probably the person who can come closest to understanding Sonny's feeling of flying, and she is the person who can take that ephemeral feeling and turn it into a physical thing. There is a natural relationship there, but it should not be a romantic one. The film really wobbles in the pub scene because it presents Sonny's charm as flirting. It should have reframed it as him trying to persuade her into supporting him because he thinks Kate has to work *for* him when in reality he needs to work *with* her.\n\nWe know the film went through some reshoots because they were filming at Silverstone in 2023 and 2024. I suspect that the Banning scenes were a late addition -- the framing of the shots on the grid where the cars are behind the camera make me think that this was filmed separately and then spliced in. A lot of the complaints about the film stem from people not really understanding the Banning subplot, probably because it comes up so late. He goes from a goofy supporter of Ruben to a cutthroat board member in the blink of an eye, and the transformation happens off-camera, so I suspect the character was added in or rewritten at the last minute because the film felt the need for a third-act villain. The unintended consequence was that it compressed everything else that the film did, and characters like Kate and Jodie copped the worst of it."", 'I liked how the women of Sky F1 realised the movie was a little bit shit about women in the sport, so Bernie went round interviewing different female employees at Aston Martin and Red Bull during the Austrian GP weekend. I thought that was a nice bit.', 'It didn‚Äôt really pass the bechdel test in spirit even though it might have literally.
