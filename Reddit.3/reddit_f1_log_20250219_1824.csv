What are the technical innovations and what are they for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1it4pal/what_changes_on_the_new_ferrari_sf25_suspension/,2025-02-19, News,,"['Translation \n\n\nThe technical secrets of Leclerc and Hamilton\'s new Red: the revolution is in the front area, but the bottom has also been completely revised\n\nOn the track at Fiorano, the new rear wing stands out\n\nThe new Ferrari SF-25 has already gone on track for its baptism with Charles Leclerc in a Fiorano surrounded by fans. Focus on the knowledge of the new mechanical parts and optimization of the new medium-downforce rear wing with a V-shape profile, a trend introduced by Alpine and then also used by McLaren, but on lower downforce levels. The real car has presented itself on the home circuit and apparently it is not so different from the renderings, even if it will change a lot.\n\nThe front suspension, why it is the most important innovation\n\nThe immediately visible novelty is the front suspension which now adopts an inverted tie rod (pull rod) compared to the previous ones. The modification had given positive results in a short time after its adoption in the tunnel, and is mainly aerodynamic in nature to lower the arm and free up space between the wing and the sidepods. Consequently, the upper triangles were also lowered. The designers were able to evolve the design of the sidepod inlet and the conveyors of the Venturi tunnels that carry the air under the bottom.\nAn anti-dive geometry was confirmed but the impression is that the choice was not to reduce the driving sensitivity on the front axle too much, thinking about the kerbs, but rather they pushed into the tunnel to\n\nThey change shape and size to better exploit aerodynamics\n\nThe measurements have all been revised, the cockpit has been slightly moved while the side pod inlet has been moved back with an increased volume in the lower part. The ""P"" design of the radiator inlets has been maintained but is more rounded, this should have allowed greater efficiency downstream of the single-seater by better tapering the volumes of the tail, which now has mini-slits on the fin for breathing. The upper lip of the side pod inlets has now become a wing profile in all respects. Above the sides you can see a hint of what were called goldfish tanks on the F1-75 , obviously we are completely far from that function, however it is an idea that we wanted to try again in the tunnel to adapt it to the new concept. The dress is refined, muscular but dry, the great work in the tunnel is visible.\n\nEvolved DRS and a completely revised floor\n\nThe SF-25 has not given up the dry triangle of the air box of the past cars, this is a positive fact to maintain a good efficiency towards the rear wing. Ferrari is probably abandoning that ""all-purpose"" wing seen in the first part of last season, sometimes too loaded, the one shown currently is a clear step forward in terms of efficiency of the Drsanche through the design of the V-shaped main plane.\nThe triangle, the front wing and the short nose are the parts that have remained most faithful to the latest specifications that worked well in the last season finale, everything else has been gradually evolved and we must not forget the decisive part of these ground effect cars which remains the floor. The visible part is the edge that now takes on a greater linearity from the slide to the diffuser. The measures of the ""lips"" on the sides have been thinned and the final part of the floor edge has been further stiffened. The rear suspension has been redone to interact better with the rear wing. The design of the tunnels under the floor cannot be seen but it appears to be a very massive evolution of the experimental version used in late 2024.\n\n\nThe engine, interventions on power and reliability\n\n\nThe new 066/15 power unit cannot have been modified in terms of architecture due to the regulated freeze, however DT Gualtieri admitted that continuous optimization work always guarantees greater performance. ""We have worked intensely on all the control strategies and procedures to ensure that every single component can express its best on every circuit"". In essence we can confirm that the Ferrari SF-25 has therefore had a very extensive revision compared to the previous concept.', 'Aesthetics wise those shark fins on the back spine are really doing it for me', 'Finnaly they sneaked back the 2019 engine /s', 'Bathtub sidepods come back baby.', 'Inject that straight line speed into my veins']",63,7,0.88,63,5,5,17,1,0.010000000000000009,17

There is probably the obvious benefit of preseason testing having all 20 cars on track and being able to see how your car handles dirty air. What other benefits and restrictions are there?","['A ""shakedown"" is a single day limited to 200km. There is only one team on track and all running must be done on specific tyres that are different from the tyres the teams will normally use at testing and the races. This is primarily used to capture marketing material and to check the car and it\'s systems are working.\n\nTesting this year is three days in Bahrain where the track is open for 8 hours each day. All 10 teams run at the same time and each will run 1 car (so up to 10 on track) for as many kilometres as they want. They also get to use the ""correct"" tyres, the same as they will during the races. This is where the team get most of their data about the car.', ""Preseason testing is essentially days of testing like on the Friday of a race weekend.\n\nShakedowns (/filming days) usually have restrictions on ~~speed~~ , distance,  tyres and data gathering I think. You can basically test if it works so that you don't spend the actual testing days in the garage fixing a bug.\n\nBasically performance vs function testing"", 'Tyres is a big one', ""Note, preseason testing won't have all 20 cars on track at once, it will have 10, one from each team on track at once. Drivers will split the days of preseason testing the way each team agrees with their drivers on.\n\nFilming days were intended to just be filming days, but of course teams used them for data, so there are a bunch of rules of distance and all that now.\n\nI think shakedown is just the word for the first time the new cars are on track, whether testing or filming is the main goal. I think it can be either the 100km or 200km test. Realistically, the teams try to get as much data as possible every moment the cars are on track."", ""You can't collect any data on aero during shakedown and teams wouldn't at all run the engine too hard. also it would be on wet tyres."", ""It's a filming day not a shakedown\n\nTeams just use it to test the car, see if basic functions are working."", ""Great, succinct explanation!\n\nWorth emphasizing that all tyre compounds are available in Bahrain, too. Generally it's the only time where the teams are able to properly test their car's performance without restraint. Though, important to keep in mind that teams are able to conceal or inflate their performance with different combinations of fuel loads, tyre compounds, etc., so generally speaking, the timing board doesn't necessarily reflect each team's absolute performance."", ""Couple of corrections:\n\n- The teams can collect any aero data the car would normally collect as part of its normal operation, but they can't fit rake or extra sensors.\n\n- They can run slicks (look at the VCARB at Imola today) but these are a different compound compared to the race slicks.""]",4,9,0.64,4,8,8,4,9,0.64,4

1isqpvu,Overall Event Thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1isqpvu/overall_event_thoughts/,2025-02-18, Discussion,"We are littered with posts on all the specifics for the event but what are peoples overall thoughts on it?

**My thoughts:**

Ultimately I think it was a waist of time and it really was a ""spot the difference"" event on the livery for most of the cars. I am not apposed to the idea of some from of season launch event, but it needs work.

\- Jack Whitehall made it not boring and I like his work but I also think he does fit the sport. The event would have been worse without him but it needed someone else that fits better.

\- There has been far to much confusion on event day and leading up to it. Seeing ""F1"" based TikTok accounts where the ""fans"" talking about car shakedown stealth liveries thinking they final etc.

\- I just think it was odd with some 2024 cars, some with a version of the 2025 car in livery was messy

\- The drivers, wether in suits or not and everything not consistent just felt messy

\- Clearly some drivers did not want to be there. I am not sure how you handle it next time but not like that.

\- It has to be an event that has more, news, break down, help new fans with season summary and not just a spot the difference on livery design with awkward interviews and comments.

**Things to change for 2025:**

\- It needs to be rebranded as a the ""F1 season launch event"" where it does show off the teams and cars but more generalised to represent it as an event getting ready for the season  
\- Teams shakedowns if before event need to be behind close doors  
\- Cars have to be new car (or close to) with new livery  
\- No livery or outfit reveals of any kind by the teams before the event  
\- Drivers need to be on stage in race gear with hermit's  
\- Team marketing and press information releases after the event  
\- Set better date for the event considering the other points  
\- Presenter who has energy but has more connections with the sport

Obviously a lot of improvement could be done so it actually has a bit of meaning, but overall I think it was quite nice.\n\nNot everyone has to be exactly the same, I kinda liked that AM did whatever they wanted to do and we won\'t have 10 times just a car with 2 drivers coming on the stage and have the same stuff. It also fits their branding to come in a smoking instead of race suits and all. Imo there should be a nice balance between some serious ""reveals"" and have whatever the teams etc want to do.
