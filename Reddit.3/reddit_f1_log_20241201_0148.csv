But the Qatar track has no character whatsoever, I've never been able to discern the layout as it all looks exactly the same. It is a sea of flat tarmac, floodlights, and high-speed corners going into medium-speed corners. No identifiable corners, no landmarks for reference. 

Miami, a fairly universally disliked track, has distinct parts and buildings like the stadium and intersection for reference, so you can tell where in the track the rivers are. Bahrain, a similarly situated track with a barrage of floodlights in the middle of a desert, has the large tower by the first corner and goes up & down a hill for some kind of reference point. China has the gigantic pit building great first corner complex and a thrilling final few corners. Abu Dhabi, known for it's lack of character, is fairly nicely split into thirds with the high speed first sector, double-straight, and 90° corners galore.

Is this just me? Are there any other tracks that have a distinct lack of character that I am missing?

Finishing 2nd in GB4 in what seems to be her first year racing formula cars. She is also only 18, so younger than most f1a drivers. And i think she has a good chance of winning f1a next year.\n\n""\xa0Pulling and Pin would probably survive in a higher series or an open one in general,"" - short answer no\n\nPin and Garcia (last year\'s champion) raced this in year in FRECA and they scored 0 points with a best finish of 13th and 14th. Garcia is 24. Plenty of drivers in that series are 17.\n\nPin finished 10th in F4 UAE with Prema, okay but not crazy\n\nPulling competed in British F4 and finished in 7th winning a race. She is 21, older than Pourchaire was when he won f2 in his 3rd season. She raced in that series previously and compete in W-Series and f1 academy already\n\nWeug competed in italian and adac f4 in the past and freca. Scored points but again nothing crazy in terms of championship position. Also freca scored points but only finished 17 behind drivers that only copeted in half the races.\n\nThere is a reason why F1a exists and that is why i do not agree with Flörsch at all that they should just compete in the normal ONLY. F1A helps to get them some experience and exposure to sponsors (racing is expensive someone has to pay for it) and then join the normal series a year later or 2.', 'They have F4 cars, exactly the same model used in any F4 category out there\n\nSome of them race in EURO F4 or Formula Regional (between F4 and F3) but none of them achieved any important result. Maybe (with money) they can get to F3, in the same way Floersch did, but F2 is absolutely out of reach', 'mediocre F4 level.', ""\n>but aside from the cars which are obviously even slower than F4,\n\nThey're just standard F4 cars aren't they?"", 'The series is meant to give a woman a fair shot at a racing career, which I think is good. Does it work that way? Hmmm, maybe, it gave someone like Chadwick a push. Do any of the current academt drivers have what it takes to bet into F1? I doubt that. But I hope they do find a few raw talents. Can female racers have a career outside the academy. Of course, but a bit of help is okay.', 'F4 at best. Maybe the absolute best could be competitive in F3.']",0,48,0.45,0,322,322,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0

The 1980s and 1990s, however, were quite different. For instance, not many would have known about Ayrton Senna\'s beautiful friendship with Keith Sutton, had the latter not come out to shed light on it recently.\nAlthough Sutton never made it to the pinnacle of motorsports, he too, vied for a career in racing at the same time as Senna. Senna became successful, whereas Sutton started working as the Sao-Paolo native\'s personal photographer for a short period of time when he was in the lower ranks of open wheel racing (between 1981 and 1984).\nSenna first met Sutton when he took some pictures of him in his junior Formula car. Impressed, he asked Sutton to join his team and the two began working together, resulting in many prominent personalities getting to know the Brazilian driver, thanks to the clicks.\nEventually, Senna would meet the right people who would help accelerate his F1 dream, which not only did he realize, but also conquered. By winning three World Championships, he became one of the best and most beloved drivers of all time.\nSutton\'s role in shaping his career won\'t be forgotten and his time with Senna will be immortalized in the upcoming Netflix miniseries about the late great legend.\nSutton took to his own Instagram account to share his feelings about their friendship before the premiere. He wrote, ""Working closely with Ayrton during the early years of his racing career remains one of the most special periods of my life. Capturing the moments of a legend in the making was an honor I\'ll never forget.""', 'Very educational, I didn’t know Alain Prost was the actual devil responsible for famine and genocide.', 'It was a B-minus for me! \n\nPositives: cinematography, cast (Prost’s perm was chef’s kiss)\n\nNegatives: too much drama with Senna-Prost and Senna-FIA', 'The racing scenes were pretty repetitive and so were the Brazilian celebration scenes at the end of some episodes.  Also feel like some of sennas mannerisms weren’t portrayed that accurately.  But overall not bad', 'Is it worth watching?', 'Sadly Akin has always been pictured like this by movies or TV shows on Senna.
