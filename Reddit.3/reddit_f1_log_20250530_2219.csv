I don't see it."", ""everything he is saying sounds good.  but they're both young.  hopefully they both can keep that mentality throughout the season.  especially towards the end if it is still close and pressure is mounting."", '‚ÄúI think, going into the year, we knew that it‚Äôs impossible to have your own personal goal directly in parallel with the team‚Äôs,‚Äù Piastri told media, including PlanetF1.com, in Barcelona.\n‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs something we‚Äôve both been very frank about, something that the team has been very aware of.\n\n‚ÄúBecause, at the end of last year, we felt that if we went into this year with a car as strong as we finished with, we‚Äôd be in this situation. I think we‚Äôve been very good at being open about it, just talking about it.‚Äù\nWhile he and Norris are aiming for a maiden title win this season, McLaren‚Äôs current level is such that the Australian reckons several more title fights are on the horizon ‚Äì meaning maintaining harmony between the pair is a top priority.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre never going to do anything that‚Äôs unsportsmanlike or puts the team in a bad light or puts ourselves in a bad light. I think that‚Äôs just not who Lando and I are,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúOf course, we want to go out and beat each other every weekend, but we‚Äôre never going to cross that line that‚Äôs going to cause damage that can‚Äôt be repaired. Because, I‚Äôve said it a few times now, we don‚Äôt want just one opportunity at this.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both at McLaren for a very long time after this year, and we want to fight for the championship every single year. I think we both understand it‚Äôs pretty unwise to try and win one championship and bring the house down with it.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs a unique situation, as Piastri acknowledged. It‚Äôs not so long ago since Mercedes encountered fallout between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg as the former childhood friends fell out in similar circumstances, and the Australian praised McLaren for its hands-off handling of things.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think every team would handle it as we are, no,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúAt the same time, there are not many teams in our situation with a car and drivers that are strong enough‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got a very good lead in the Constructors‚Äô Championship at the moment and, whilst we‚Äôre continuing to build that gap, I think it‚Äôs the right thing to do to let us both try and fight for a championship.‚Äù\n\nThere will come a point where he believes the team should start imposing team orders as it closes in on the titles ‚Äì but only if one of the pair develops a big enough lead to warrant some level of support.\n\n‚ÄúI think, once it‚Äôs mathematically impossible, probably,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúBut no, I think we both want to win or try and fight for this championship and score our own points.\n\n‚ÄúOf course, if there becomes a time, later in the year, where it is genuinely impossible ‚Äì or very close to it ‚Äì then, then, yes, maybe that will change, but I don‚Äôt see that happening for a very long time.‚Äù\n\nHaving had a run of momentum that saw him take wins in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, Piastri was beaten by Norris at Imola and Monaco, and said he suspects this pattern of momentum switching will continue through the year.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to ebb and flow a bit through the whole year,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúBut, I mean, I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôve analysed what went a little bit wrong in Monaco.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, it still wasn‚Äôt a terrible weekend, but just not as good as some of the weekends have been this year for me. So we‚Äôve looked at what we can do a bit better, and we‚Äôll try and put that in action.‚Äù\n\n___________________________________________\n\nPiastri‚Äôs comfort with the dynamic at McLaren will be welcomed by Zak Brown, who outlined his position on his driver‚Äôs assured equality during an exclusive interview with PlanetF1.com.\n\n‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs quite an easy thing to work through,‚Äù Brown explained.\n\n‚ÄúOur drivers aren‚Äôt asking for favouritism, they‚Äôre asking for fairness, and that‚Äôs what they get.\n\n‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre very comfortable; may the best man win.\n\n‚ÄúHopefully we give them a car in an environment where you‚Äôre going into the last race and it‚Äôs the two of them competing, and they didn‚Äôt take points off each other to the point where it lets Max [Verstappen] or someone else get in there.\n\n‚ÄúBut if so, then whoever wins the Drivers‚Äô Championship has done a better job.‚Äù\n\nsacrifice [Yuki] Tsunoda‚Äôs qualifying because he‚Äôs giving Max a tow or whatever.‚ÄúI get compromising the second car at Red Bull because it‚Äôs not competing for the Drivers‚Äô Championship, so it‚Äôs an easy decision to make.\n\n‚ÄúBut when you‚Äôve got two drivers first and second in the championship and are separated by less than one second place finish, how do you possibly even consider standing one down into a supporting role?\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just no way we will.‚Äù', 'Why do people get upset with this?

The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t rocked the Formula 1 world. Mercedes and Ferrari have moved somewhat closer.**\n\n> We don\'t need to rewrite the Formula 1 World Championship. The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t upset the balance of power between the teams. McLaren is still ahead, both on a single lap and in the long run. Max Verstappen is close. This has to do with the fact that Barcelona is a Red Bull track. The hope that stiffer front wings would upset the balance of the papaya racers was not fulfilled.\n\n> Mercedes has rediscovered its form from the first six races. But only for one lap. During the long run, the tires overheated. Ferrari delivered a solid performance. The gap to the leaders was half a second, slightly less than last time.\n\n> In the midfield, Aston Martin performed well on a single lap and Alpine on the long run. Toro Rosso showed the most balance. Their speed is good both on a single lap and over the distance.\n\n> Sauber has made a noticeable leap forward with its new aero package. Nico H√ºlkenberg\'s strong endurance run underscores that the Sauber has become more predictable. Williams, as expected, is struggling. The car doesn\'t thrive in the long corners. Haas had the same problem and plummeted to the bottom of the standings.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n> **1) Has the new front wing rule shuffled the field?**\nNot at all. On one lap, McLaren is ahead of Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Alpine, Toro Rosso, Sauber, Williams, and Haas. That\'s almost normal. Aston Martin looks slightly better than recently, Williams slightly worse. That depends on the track. Sauber and Alpine have made a leap with their upgrades. Haas adjusted the setup in the wrong direction after a strong first practice. On one lap, Mercedes is a pole position contender. But the Silver Arrows suffered a setback in the long run.\n\n> **2) Who has the fastest car in the long run?**\nWhen comparing the long runs, much depends on the time in the second practice session they were completed and the distance they covered. George Russell drove the longest stint on soft tires with 16 laps. Piastri was the marathon man on the medium tires with 14 laps. We only count the fast laps without cool-down periods or time lost due to traffic. The length of the race simulation logically puts pressure on the lap times. This is why Russell and Norris are far down in the standings.\n\n> Max Verstappen and Lando Norris are difficult to compare. Both completed a long run on the soft and medium tires, but at different times. Verstappen started on the medium and then switched to the soft. Norris did the opposite. Therefore, the world champion was faster in the soft long run, while Norris was faster in the medium endurance run. The difference was three to four tenths per lap. Taking the weight factor into account, it\'s a close race. The second stint was obviously helped by the fact that there was less fuel in the tank at the end.\n\n> The Ferrari drivers split their time in sync. First medium, then soft. Lewis Hamilton leads the soft long runs. However, he only completed three hot laps on the set. Oscar Piastri took the fastest time of the day, but suffered a setback in the endurance run. In 14 laps on the medium tires, the Australian only managed an average of 1:20.966 minutes. ""Things didn\'t go well in the first practice session. It wasn\'t until the second that we slowly found our way back to form,"" he said.\n\n> **3) Ferrari: Good or Evil?\nAfter the first practice session, Ferrari\'s faces were relaxed. Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc finished third and fourth, surprising even themselves. Barcelona hasn\'t exactly been one of the red cars\' signature tracks in the past. In the afternoon, with temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius in the shade, the corners of their mouths drooped again. Leclerc slipped to fifth place, half a second off Piastri\'s fastest time.\n\n> Hamilton, finishing eleventh, didn\'t even make the top ten. The Englishman complained about the car\'s balance.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our¬†[guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our¬†[FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Please¬†[direct these to the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/formula1)¬†instead.","[""I made a simple web app to compare qualifying performance of drivers with their teammates. You can see how well a driver did (H2H, mean and median gap) against their teammate\n\n* over a season\n* over all qualifying sessions they took part in as teammates \n* against all his teammates at a particular circuit\n\nI compared times from sessions both drivers participated in. I.e. if driver A made it to Q3 and driver B got out in Q1, then their Q1 times were used. This means results such as Norris v Piastri in 2025 Saudi went to Norris because he crashed and couldn't set a Q3 time but was faster in Q2.\n\nThere is also a fourth feature where you can see how far off a driver's best time is from the fastest driver for every quali session in a season. I thought it would be interesting to see how the gap to the fastest changes over a year (like how Verstappen got closer and closer to Mercedes in 2020, or how Alonso got further away in 2023).\n\nData was fetched from the Jolpica (formerly Ergast) API. Only data from the 1994 season onwards is available (so unfortunately no Prost v Senna). There is also a lot of data from the late 90s and early 2000s seasons missing, so you may find it weird that only 32 results for Coulthard v Hakkinen across their career are shown.\n\nI am planning to make a post here about it but wanted some feedback first. I'm not a frontend guy so excuse the basic layout and style, but if you could suggest a change that is simple enough and would improve the look of the site I'll do it.\n\nhttps://www.f1teammatequali.com/"", 'Rosberg is back for Spain.', 'Had Gilles Villeneuve lived and stayed at Ferrari, do you think he would have won the 1985 championship in place of Alboreto?', 'Is practice on today ?
