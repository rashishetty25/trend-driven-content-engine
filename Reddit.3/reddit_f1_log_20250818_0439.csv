1msj9qv,Russell: Fresh start in F1 2025 was good for both Mercedes and Hamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1msj9qv/russell_fresh_start_in_f1_2025_was_good_for_both/,2025-08-17, News,,"['TLDR he says the change was good for Lewis, doesn’t elaborate why, reflects on Mercedes’ challenges, insists Kimi will be better after the break and that he’s close to George in terms of performance.', 'His assesment of Kimi’s performance is very accurate. Something that is, as he said, missed by most media/commentators.\xa0\n\nHis assesment of Lewis going to Ferrari being good for Lewis and Mercedes Im not sure about. Only if Lewis gets going again next year then it was a good choice. So far only George benefited cause he is now the full on lead driver at Merc', 'Love how the whole article is about George backing Kimi and sharing his thoughts on the car’s performance, but the headline zeroes in on one offhanded comment about Lewis. Like, what was he supposed to say… ""It\'s been terrible for Lewis. He should\'ve never left.""?', ""The sad part about Mercedes every year since 2022 is that they have good races. And then all of a sudden it becomes horrible again. I was hoping George had a shot to be in the running for 2025. But they just don't have a car that functions properly in half the tracks. \n\nHim and Max are stuck having competetive cars in 1/3 of the races and thats just not enough to do anything with."", 'Good change for Russel because now he goes against a rookie and he’s the number 1 driver.\xa0', ""Ferrari's problem is that it is in Italy, run by an arrogant organisation with a long recent history of grand failure without the intervention of less stymied thinkers."", ""Seems to be a lot in common between Kimi and Lewis in 2025. I think the data shows that both drivers are solid in trace trim but suffer from a lack of confidence and overdriving in qualifying. Whether you're a teenager of a 7x champion, I think these regulations are very difficult for drivers who have not been involved in their teams' development process. It's definitely not plug-and-play, and the drivers who have moved to other teams,, plus rookies, are the ones who seem to be struggling the most. \n\nLooking forward to a clean slate to see if Antonelli is worth the hype, and if Lewis can return to his former glory and consistently fight for wins and podiums."", 'Look at me. I am the number 1 driver now.', 'Kind of a weird stance when you consider that both Hamilton and Mercedes are having their worst year in a while.', 'It was especially good for Russell']",797,136,0.96,797,1753,1753,16,1,0.0,16
1mt7bi5,David Coulthard Drives Alfetta 158 at Silverstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mt7bi5/david_coulthard_drives_alfetta_158_at_silverstone/,2025-08-18, Video,"Edit: redid post because I mispelled Alfetta in the title. Poor little Alfa (sad). 

This is one of the cars from the Bernie Ecclestone Collection. Red Bull purchased the entire collection and plans to build a museum at the Red Bull Ring to display them. if you do not know, Bernie had put together a collection of some of the most important cars in the history of F1. In addition to this 158, he has early Ferraris and Vanwalls. He has the Brabhams from his years of owning the team including the only known surviving fan car. While Bernie owned the collection few of the cars were seen. It is nice to see that Red Bull are dusting them off for people to see.","[""Imagine. These guys got up 450 HP eventually out of a straight 8, 1500 cc engine! LOLOL.\n\nItaly: Beautiful Food, cars, countryside, women and motorcycles.

Bernie had 65 cars or so that span the history of F1. Some one offs like this one. The only surviving fan car. A Vanwall. Tom Hartley said his team spent months researching the history of each car. I contacted them to see if they would make those histories available. Sadly they said they are the property of whoever buys the cars. Hopefully Red Bull makes he information available. Red Bull plans to build a museum at the Red Bull Ring, so hopefully we get to see them at least once a year on track. \n\n[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0wmxjE4WwAJfQzTSKeX6g7s0FMdDnzxD&si=DcPDOuQ5B832Y6S2](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0wmxjE4WwAJfQzTSKeX6g7s0FMdDnzxD&si=DcPDOuQ5B832Y6S2)', ""I can't drink wine, but I hear that they are getting into  making some very good good single malt whisky. :D""]",79,8,0.98,79,7,7,13,1,-0.010000000000000009,13
