1gt403f,Was Schumacher Really Pushed Out At Ferrari?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gt403f/was_schumacher_really_pushed_out_at_ferrari/,2024-11-17, Discussion,"Alright. I'm sure the vast amount of readers here knows the story. As reported by a BusinessF1 article, that [Schumacher was prematurely pushed out at Ferrari](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/51sn70/interesting_read_on_how_schumis_first_retirement/?rdt=33460) because good ol' Montezemolo got power hungry.

There appears to be but one problem. BusinessF1 is the one and only (AFAIK) source of the story, and we know that rag is as good as [diarrhea soaked toilet paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/18cxbwy/i_think_we_should_all_be_aware_that_buisnessf1/). 

To my knowledge, this story has **never** been corroborated by *any* reputable media outlets, nor have there been any actual insider statements. 

This is not one of those paddock open secrets where there has been enough confirmation with sources that a reputable outlet like the BBC would report on it with qualifying statements such as ""...understands that..."", ""...reportedly..."" ala Alonso's 2009 Ferrari move.

On the contrary, [Ross Brawn himself states that Michael didn't have it in him at the end of 2006 for the commitment required to gun for another WDC](https://youtu.be/t15tKnsUJrk?t=2335), and additionally Todt said had the rest of the dream team stayed on, [Todt would have quit himself](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/todt-reveals-he-planned-to-quit-ferrari-4406126/4406126/).

So, in the interest of getting to the bottom of this as a lifelong Schumacher fan, I was wondering if anyone has ever managed to track down a reputable source/report that was remotely contemporaneous to the events? Or is this story complete bullshit as is typical from BusinessF1?


EDIT: Thanks to u/prancing_moose for the tip that James Allen's book covers this topic! Key takeaways found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gt403f/was_schumacher_really_pushed_out_at_ferrari/lxkkshm/). If James Allen (an actual trustworthy source) is to be believed, **Schumacher was not forced out and that whole story is indeed a work of fiction typical of BusinessF1.**","['BusinessF1 is the MBS of Motorsport publications.\n\nIn the words of Paul Gualtieri: https://youtu.be/qRufBEFq34c?si=2B4PMWCkKXJ--lnf', 'There were plenty of stories around even then about the LdM vs Todt conflict. It‚Äôs why Rossi wasn‚Äôt able to get his shot and how Kimi got the gig. \nThe power struggle stories abounded and seem to make sense as well. MS was collateral damage.', 'In ‚ÄúMichael Schumacher: The Edge of Greatness‚Äù, James Allen very much describes the power struggle within Ferrari and that Schumacher‚Äôs retirement announcement was practically forced by Ferrari. \n\nIt‚Äôs always hard to say if that was true or not, a lot of stuff happens behind the scenes of F1 that we‚Äôre not privy to, but James Allen makes a pretty convincing case for it in his book.  Assuming he has much better direct sources than I have, I have no reason to doubt that what he wrote is true.', 'Mercedes is doing what Ferrari did back then', 'The number one thing that throws cold water over the ""he was pushed out"" was he stayed in the Ferrari universe years after the fact despite being able to sign for other teams if he wanted to. The reason he left was that he got bit by the racing bug again after prepping to be a potential replacement for Massa in 2009 (while Massa was in a coma from being hit by debris), but given that Ferrari already had 3 drivers contracted for 2010, there was simply no room for a return. \n\nAlso its an open secret that he lobbied for Ferrari to sign Kimi. Not the kind of thing you do if you were expecting to keep driving.', ""I remember that kind of being the thinking at the time. They had just signed the highest-rated young talent (Raikkonen) and already had their young star that they'd developed in-house (Massa). Something had to give.\n\nThere's two lines of thinking around the whole thing:\n\nThe first is that Ferrari planned to have Schumacher team up with Raikkonen, with a view to the future and Raikkonen eventually replacing Schumacher as 'the man' at Ferrari. But Schumacher chose to back away, seemingly not wanting to race alongside an equal. Thus Massa ‚Äì who was probably going to be the reserve in 2007 ‚Äì got a reprieve.\n\nThe second is that Ferrari signed Raikkonen as a direct replacement for Schumacher, with Schumacher ageing and out of contract at the end of 2006.\n\nBoth theories are credible, and there was plenty of material around both ideas at the time (and since), but we'll never know the exact truth.\n\nPersonally I don't think he was explicitly forced out, but I do believe he jumped before Ferrari had a chance to sort of push him."", 'Wasn‚Äôt BusinessF1 the ‚Äújournalist‚Äù that said Suzie Wolff was feeding info to Toto?  I wouldn‚Äôt even wipe my booty hole with their articles.', 'I was really scared to click the ""diarrhea soaked toilet paper"" link, ngl.', ""It's a complicated situation. Ferrari's choice of 2007-2009 lineup was a good one. Massa won 11 races between 2006-2008, an extremely impressive feat, and of course he fought for the title in 2008. Raikkonen remains the last champion for the Scuderia.\n\nI believe that Michael didn't really want to retire, but he had a great relationship with Felipe, so he decided to leave so as not to leave his friend without a seat for 2007. And of course, if Schumacher had stayed until the end of 2009, he would have had the potential to fight for title in 2007 and 2008.""]",531,162,0.9,531,1753,1753,0,2,0.0,0
