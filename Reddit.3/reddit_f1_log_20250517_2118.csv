No one expected a miracle from the SF-25, as Lewis Hamilton had been asking for patience from the fans since Thursday. But probably no one would have expected to see both Reds eliminated at the end of Q2 either, with Charles Leclerc starting 11th just ahead of the seven-time world champion.\n\nThe problem was that, while everyone else improved on their last attempt, the two Ferraris, on the other hand, when they mounted the new soft tyres, were unable to improve on the time they had set on the used ones. A script already seen in Miami, which was also repeated on a very different track. And a problem that is therefore becoming quite an Achilles heel for the men from the Cavallino. But team principal Fred Vasseur is also well aware of this.\n\n""It\'s almost a copy-paste of what happened a fortnight ago in Miami, we couldn\'t improve the with the new set of tyres and we did the fastest lap with the first set in Q2. Why? If we knew, we would have solved it by now, but it\'s true that it\'s a strange situation, although I think it was a bit strange for everyone today with the tyres. The pace was decent, because if you look at the first stint we were fifth and sixth with the used tyres, but then with the new set we couldn\'t improve, while the others did it by three or four tenths and we paid the price,"" Vasseur told the Sky Sport F1 microphones.\n\nDuring the link-up, he was heard to hear Leclerc explain that in his opinion the problem is that there is simply no potential in the SF-25. A thought the French manager only partly shares: ""I think the problem today was 50-50 between execution and potential, because I think if we had done everything right we would have finished fourth and fifth. The execution was not right, because we have to make the car work for what it is worth and today that didn\'t happen, because with the new tyres we didn\'t confirm the positions we had with the used tyres. But the potential is not good either, because the goal is not to be fifth and sixth. But it\'s a balancing act between the two, both execution and potential are lacking"".\n\nToday several competitor cars, including Aston Martin, were presenting new packages, while at Ferrari they are still talking about understanding the current one. Vasseur was therefore asked whether this process is well advanced: \'If I say yes, then I am a fool if you see what we did today. But today I think the Aston Martins are the only ones who did all the qualifying on medium tyres and ended up finishing fifth, so there was something unusual.\n\nThe problem is that the upgrades will also have to be understood when they arrive, but according to Vasseur that does not seem to be the point: ""When we talk about upgrades we always talk about tenths or hundredths of a second, we are certainly not talking about half a second. What we can do with the tyres, on the other hand, can be worth even half a second. It\'s more there maybe that we have to try to understand and get something out of it.\n\nThe race pace yesterday was good, so you can try to attack, even if starting so far back at Imola is a big handicap: ""Everything is always open, because our race pace yesterday was good, but it is also true that it is very difficult to overtake here, so we will have to be very lucid and maybe even try some risks in terms of strategy.\n\nLeclerc publicly apologised to the fans, a sentiment also espoused by the team principal: ""We have nothing more to say or do. We have thousands of fans on the track and it was not what we expected for them, so we have to apologise, but we also have to focus on the future and tomorrow, trying to do our best for them and for us.""\n\nFred should make ""Potential"" his middle name.', 'I think he‚Äôs got to understand that the execution and extracting potential from the car is actually a deep rooted issue with the car. \n\nThere‚Äôs a reason why there‚Äôs been a pattern of Ferraris pace compared to others looking better on the used softs compared to new softs and that‚Äôs because the of car and the way it treats tires. \n\nThey‚Äôve had issues with tires in qualifying since the start of the 2024 season, He can‚Äôt keep acting like it‚Äôs a small issue they‚Äôll fix soon.\nI don‚Äôt have any hope for Ferrari this season', 'I hope Vasseur takes this as a sign to bin off development of this car and entirely focus on next year as they are too far behind to challenge for either championship already.', 'Wonder how many copy & paste of Miami we will have for the remaining races.

But, even with what is arguably the best driver line up on the grid, both Ferrari's are out in Q2. 

Other than Sauber and Haas (their customer teams) every other team has had a car outqualify them, which poses the question, just how poor is that Ferrari relative to the other teams?","[""I am confused as to how much more the Ferrari Team can humiliate themselves.

For some reason, the soft tyres don‚Äôt work here at all, all drivers on softs were really struggling during the FPs. So almost all the teams are reserving their mediums for the main race, Aston decided it was worth to have one less sets of mediums just to get out of Q2 and it was absolutely the right decision.', 'Definitely not in race pace, they‚Äôre at worst 5th best there unless Aston pulls out something crazy.\n\nBut qualifying is a lot more complex with a lot more factors. It‚Äôs not only one lap pace, but how prone the car is to locking up and braking right, wether the cars strength is more important at different tracks, how a car handles different tires over one lap. \n\nA pattern of two weeks now is that Ferrari are not making that jump on a fresh set of tires. Sure people were struggling more this week on the fresh set but most did improve significantly on those fresh tires  in Q3.\n\nDefinitely seems like the Ferrari isn‚Äôt good at handling a fresh set and doesn‚Äôt get the same benefit out of them. \n\nMeanwhile I think it‚Äôs the opposite for Williams. They can only find that really impressive pace when on the fresh tires and their pace on fresh sets is faster than Ferraris on fresh sets but not so much on used.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt really tell how Aston compared in raw qualifying pace cause they‚Äôre on mediums. That‚Äôs helping them extract the most for their car but it might not be the same for Ferrari. A lot of people are saying oh the mediums must be the stray but not every car is going to find the same advantage from different compounds.\n\nGasly and Hadjar are both hard to compare as they don‚Äôt have a teammate up there, and that wasn‚Äôt because of a pace issue. I think the RB isn‚Äôt the fastest but it seems to be one of the easiest cars on the grid to put a lap together in and extract a lot from. \n\nWho knows from Alpine honestly, week by week I can never tell how fast they are', ""5th, 8th or 10th, doesn't matter, the car sucks.

Ferrari is Ferrari, and Red Bull is a one-man team.', 'Translation:\n\n> **McLaren proved to be vastly superior on the first day of practice at Imola. Over one lap and over the entire race. The only question now is: Who will finish second? Ferrari has the best chances in the long run, but they\'re one lap behind.**\n\n> After McLaren\'s one-two victory at the Miami GP, everyone was wondering: Could it be even more dominant? It could be, if the first day of practice in Imola were to be the benchmark for the rest of the weekend. This time, the McLarens had the better of the competition, even on one lap, with a lead of almost three-tenths. In the long run, that\'s for sure. There\'s a world of difference between McLaren and the rest.\n\n> The race for victory will be between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Piastri beat his teammate by 0.025 seconds on one lap. In the race simulation, Norris had the edge by 0.045 seconds. However, Piastri completed two more laps on the medium tires. The close race between the Papaya Boys could be quite exciting for spectators. Perhaps less so for the McLaren command bridge. Will the first clash, which McLaren boss Zak Brown says is inevitable, take place in Imola?\n\n> Things remain exciting behind McLaren as well. On one lap, Mercedes has a minimal lead over Red Bull and Ferrari. Things are different in the long runs, where Ferrari excelled. Charles Leclerc\'s lap times averaged just two-tenths of a second better than McLaren\'s. ""But that only helps us if we\'re ahead of our opponents on the starting grid,"" team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur told his team. Imola is a track with a built-in overtaking ban.\n\n> In the midfield, Alpine shone on one lap with the new C6 tire. Williams was stronger on the medium C5 compound. As a whole, you have to trust Williams more. Carlos Sainz\'s long run was over half a second faster per lap than Pierre Gasly\'s.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n\n> **1) Is McLaren unbeatable again?**\nThe first practice session ended with a one-two finish for McLaren. Oscar Piastri finished ahead of Lando Norris. But the lead over third-placed Carlos Sainz was razor-thin at 52 thousandths of a second. All were on the new C6 compound. The second practice session, on the medium tires, presented a similar picture: Norris ahead of Sainz, separated by only 0.040 seconds. There was still hope that McLaren would at least have to fight for pole position.\n\n> But on the soft tires, McLaren then unleashed a blast. Piastri and Norris were within just 0.025 seconds of each other. Everyone else, including Pierre Gasly at the front, was almost three-tenths behind. With a time difference of 1.127 seconds for the entire field, that\'s a class difference. Things got even worse for the rivals in the long runs. Only Ferrari was able to keep up. All the other drivers were on average half a second slower per lap. While the McLarens maintained their lap times consistently, their rivals\' times improved after five laps.\n\n> **2) Has Red Bull solved its problems?**\n\nYes and no. Even the Imola upgrade only partially cured the RB21\'s weaknesses. Max Verstappen initially reported understeer at the apex and oversteer on corner exit. But by the second practice session, the understeer had disappeared. ""Nevertheless, we lost four-tenths to the McLarens. That\'s too much. And in the race, the McLarens seem to be in a class of their own again,"" lamented Sporting Director Helmut Marko. Compared to the other teams, the assessment is cautious. ""We ran our normal program, but we have the feeling that some of them were perhaps a bit lighter.""\n\n> The latest development stage hasn\'t entirely failed to achieve its intended effect, but it hasn\'t brought Red Bull significantly closer to McLaren or away from its fellow sufferers Mercedes and Ferrari. Furthermore, the car bounces over bumps and curbs‚Äîa long-standing problem that has plagued Red Bull for two years now. Yuki Tsunoda\'s eighth-place finish was surprising, but even more so was the small time difference of 0.092 seconds. ""No one has been this close to Max in a long time. Yuki doesn\'t mind the oversteer as much. He complains less,"" Marko noted. The small time difference could also tell a different story, however. Namely, that Verstappen wasn\'t yet at his best. The world champion usually strikes when things get serious.\n\n(1/2)', '""Most competitive season yet""', '***Reaaaalllly*** interesting and helpful article.

Both drivers finished in the top ten, with Fernando Alonso even securing fifth place on the grid. The medium-tire trick was planned well in advance. Mercedes copied it and almost secured pole position.**\n\n> The 2026 season has been a tragedy for Aston Martin so far. Recently, Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll have been consistently stuck in Q1. Stroll has always scored his 14 World Championship points when his rivals have missed them. Alonso\'s points tally is still empty after six World Championship races.\n\n> The first major technical upgrade was intended to halt the downward trend in Imola. After a comparison test on Friday, it was determined that the new aerodynamic package was better. But it wasn\'t so good that it would turn a Q1 car into a Q3 car. Despite this, Alonso and Stroll made it to the final knockout round relatively relaxed, trumping grid positions 5 and 8, respectively. Alonso missed Oscar Piastri\'s best time by 0.761 seconds, however. In the last few races, the green cars were more than a second behind.\n\n> The result flatters Aston Martin somewhat. ""We\'re not as good as the result,"" admits Alonso. Had the Spaniard driven on soft tires like most of his teammates, he would have finished tenth on the grid. The extra boost came from the tire choice. Starting in Q2, Aston Martin opted for the medium tire on each of their second attempts.\n\n> **Medium more stable and less temperature sensitive.**\nThat was the plan from the start. Aston Martin wasn\'t confident about Pirelli\'s new superglue, the C6. ""We already noticed during the tests last year in Mexico and Abu Dhabi that things could get critical with the C6 at the end of the lap on certain tracks,"" reveals chief engineer Mike Krack. But they were a bit hesitant. ""The new soft tire lasted surprisingly long on Friday.""\n\n> Nevertheless, Aston Martin went ahead with its plan. And it was proven right. The C6 was already degrading in the second sector with the track temperature reaching 40 degrees Celsius. The C5 compound, on the other hand, remained stable throughout the entire lap. The medium tire overheats less quickly and also offers more lateral stability because the tread moves less.\n\n> Aston Martin may no longer have any fresh medium tires in its contingent, but the team almost always warms up its tires before races anyway. Alonso believes he\'s well prepared for the race. ""We\'re not as fast as we look. But even if we lose two more positions, it wouldn\'t be a big deal. We just need to manage to make it through the race with one stop. Then the others have to overtake us on the track, and that\'s difficult.""\n\n> **Mercedes almost on pole position.**\nOnly one team also ran a medium in Q3. Mercedes had it in mind, but wasn\'t sure whether to sacrifice a set of C6 tires. Only when Aston Martin showed such a big performance did Mercedes decide to do the same. For the very last attempt, George Russell switched from soft to medium.\n\n> Red Bull team principal Christian Horner admits: ""When we saw that, we were sure George would be on pole position."" And that almost happened. Russell was only 0.137 seconds behind Piastri\'s pole lap. The Englishman lost his time entirely in the first four corners. ""After that, George was exactly as fast as Piastri,"" Mercedes calculated. Russell may have lost pole position on the warm-up lap. He had to slow down in heavy traffic, which is never good for tire preparation.\n\n> **Red Bull has saved medium.**\nRed Bull also briefly considered the medium tire, but preferred the better strategic options in the race. ""If it had guaranteed us pole position, we would have done it,"" says Horner. On the soft tire, Max Verstappn delivered an otherworldly first sector. However, by the second section, the Dutchman was already feeling a loss of grip. The Red Bull understeered more and more as the lap progressed.\n\n> McLaren once again beat Red Bull and Mercedes with its wildcard. The papaya racers keep every tire stable within the window, regardless of the compound. Piastri gained two tenths on Verstappen in the second part of the track. Looking back, Horner is glad he still had fresh medium tires in stock. ""One qualifying lap would have drained too much life out of that set of tires. We would have paid the price in the first stint on Sunday.""', 'Running the medium tire was a great gutsy call', '![gif](giphy|uycNWzHCdfdcG4MY0q)', 'They finished 20 seconds behind a Sauber in Miami, P5 is a massive improvement considering they were arguably the worst car in the grid alongside Sauber.\n\nThe new wind tunnel + Newey definitely has done wonders, just look the smile on Cowell‚Äôs face after reaching Q3', 'Now to actually hold onto it for tomorrow and not drop like a brick of have a stupid strategy.', 'Alonso wdc 2026 please', 'the neweification', ""so its a 'miracle' and not hiring the best available staff\n\n(not trying to start anything, I'm a 10 minute drive from the factory and the money & jobs available locally has been substantially improved since""]",35,16,0.93,35,15,15,35,16,0.93,35

1kp0iox,Question: What happens if they both went out?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kp0iox/question_what_happens_if_they_both_went_out/,2025-05-17, Technical,"In my humble opinion, a big factor with this was Bortoleto staking a claim at the end of the pit lane‚Ä¶ but what if they both went out, or what if Bearman went out first? More specifically: what is the penalty for participating in a qualifying session that a driver did not make?

¬†I scrubbed through the [FIA Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2025_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_1_-_2024-07-31.pdf) and the closest answer I could find was in 39.4 section b (page 47 of the PDF), which states:

Drivers will be considered to be ‚Äúunclassified‚Äù in the following circumstances:

i)¬†If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race Director.

ii) If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted

iii) If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint qualifying session

The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows:

\- Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 (or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)

\- Drivers who are unclassified because of condition (iii) will be allocated the lower positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 (or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)

The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters such as:

\- A suitable lap time being set in another practice session

\- The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the Championship

\- The gravity of the offence which caused the driver‚Äôs disqualification

¬†It‚Äôs an odd one just from a sporting regulation standpoint. They‚Äôre not going to change the ruling on the field, obviously, but it‚Äôs an interesting thought that I can‚Äôt seem to find a clear answer to other than you would say that Bearman would have been unclassified?

I reckon starting from the back of the grid as ‚Äúunclassified‚Äù but disqualified from the GP? Fine? Not that it mattered, but a grid penalty?

","['I think if Haas had sent Bearman out and the ruling has gone the way it has, it‚Äôd be a big penalty.

Im not even just talkimg about Leclerc vs Max in Bahrain and Saudi. Im talking about having about three times the amount of overtakes there usually are in Australia.\xa0\n\nAnd Spain, even with the last chicane still there, had a great race with all the leaders having various plights and Russell and Verstappen having an amazing battle.\xa0\nIn Silverstone we had the best multi car wheel to wheel battle we‚Äôve seen in the last decade that was with the top cars.\xa0\nIn Austria there were battles everywhere and a five way battle at one point in the midfield where in about half a lap they all swapped around.\xa0\n\nEven France gave us \xa0loads of action and battles.\n\nAnd Hungary was the peak of it. Everyone made their strategy assuming overtaking would be difficult at what is historically the second or third worst track for passing. But there was overtakes galore especially at the head of the field.\xa0\n\nOn top of this tyres were wearing much faster than everyone expected. Bahrain, Spain and Austia were three stoppers!\xa0\nMost races were two stoppers and only about a third of them were one stop races. And the cars all had such different designs and even their paint jobs were more colourful.\xa0\n\nAlso reliability was a big factor with only Mercedes amd their customer teams having a consistently reliable car.
