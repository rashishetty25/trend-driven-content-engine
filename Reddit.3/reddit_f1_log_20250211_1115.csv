It has been a very long time, almost 4 years, since our last round of moderator recruitment. Back then we were only at 1.5 million members. Since then not only has the subreddit tripled in size, but after the 2023 Reddit Blackout multiple members of the mod team had left and since then the rest of us had also come close to being burnt out. So with all that and with an exciting 2025 season on the horizon it's time for a new round of moderator recruitment.

The qualifications to become a moderator are very simple:

* be a motorsports fan
* use reddit

The expectations for the new moderators are to be transparent, to be communicative and to be reasonably active. We have a guideline of 300 mod actions per month, but don't let this stop you from applying. **Real life always comes before Reddit** and just let the rest of the team know if you need a break.

After the form is closed we will evaluate the applications, compile a shortlist and invite those candidates to an interview. The interview will be conducted as an audio or video call. After the interview we will make the final selection of moderators and we hope to be able to onboard them by the Japanese GP at the start of April.

The applications will close on the 22nd of February at 23:00 UTC

[**Link to the application form**](https://forms.gle/gHS5HKHDWNbpJzXs8)

If you have any questions or doubts feel free to ask in the comments.

# FAQ

* **What timezones are you looking for mods from?**
   * We're looking for mods from all timezones
* **What do you use for communication between the team?**
   * Slack
* **Should I apply if I applied in previous rounds?**
   * Yes. It has been 4 years!
* **Do you need to have moderation experience?**
   * No, it's not an issue if you don't have moderator experience yet.
* **What are the tasks of a moderator exactly?**
   * Obviously the primary task is going through the modqueue and removing comments and posts that go against the subreddit rules. But there are other aspects like configuring automoderator, working on graphics and flairs, maintaining source ratings, external relations (Teams & Journalists for AMAs, etc), social media and so on.
* **Is there any compensation for moderation?**

1imjqc5,Legit question: How many of you knew this about the Mclaren logo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1imjqc5/legit_question_how_many_of_you_knew_this_about/,2025-02-10, Discussion,"[That's a Kiwi there.](https://preview.redd.it/dt2jygw56eie1.png?width=410&format=png&auto=webp&s=81514184a3e068f47c3e95fa418e2f36164ad171)

With the launch of Reiss Season 2 Mclaren release (Some stuff looks really cool) one of the jackets has a couple of clear kiwi's on the front.  
Another Jacket I am really keen on. I was talking to my friend about it. Not an F1 fan as long as myself but big fan for over a decade himself.

I said ""Its nice to have the clear representation, the kiwi in the logo is to simple.""   
And he was like ""whaaaat?""  
While he knew Mclaren origins were New Zealand he did not know the shape in the logo was a kiwi. I had to show him the older logo's for him to get it.

So it got me thinking, how many people do not know what that shape was?  
  
**So legit question, how many here did not know the Mclaren logo has a kiwi on it?**","[""I feel like I learned this factoid a long time ago. But just double-checking now, according to McLaren, it's not a kiwi, it's a simplification of a triple-chevron logo adopted after the kiwi logo  \n[https://www.mclaren.com/racing/heritage/the-story-of-the-marque/](https://www.mclaren.com/racing/heritage/the-story-of-the-marque/)\n\n>1967-1980: In addition to a change of font, the more dynamic ‘Speedy Kiwi’ was introduced in 1967, once again designed by Michael Turner to emphasise the higher speeds at which Bruce’s cars were racing  \n\n>1981-1990: Reflecting the sport’s international growth, the ‘Speedy Kiwi’ disappeared to be replaced by the McLaren International logo. It was designed by Raymond Loewy as a gift from\xa0one of the team's sponsors and evokes a chequered flag.  \n\n>1991-1997: As our ambition on the track converged with our\xa0nascent road car division, the three chevrons merged into one, and the font became more modern and sophisticated. The logo may have changed but our cars remained as successful as ever.  \n\n>1997-2006: The revamped logo that first appeared in 1997 featured a streamlined speedmark that bares similarities to the vortices created by our rear wing. It appeared on the top of our cars’ side-pods. They evoke the aggressive markings found on predatory animals and insects.\n\nThough I guess the kiwi logo led directly to the simplification into the chevron logo which it still sorta resembled if you squinted, which later led to the stylization into the speedmark logo."", 'dude the season is starting soon just hold out a bit longer', '[Is this also a kiwi?](https://imgur.com/a/qcLedgY)', ""There's a kiwi in that logo?

It's the speed tick. The kiwi is the past."", 'It’s been mentioned many times before - although to the casual observer I’m not sure you’d pick it up…British team based in UK forever & a Kiwi founder who died in 1970 doesn’t necessarily shout kiwi in logo.', 'Is it a Kiwi? It looks to me like a more streamlined chevron from their 1981-1998 logos. I can definitely see how it evokes a Kiwi, beak facing towards the McLaren logo.', 'It was a throwback to the old chevron design which was in itself effectively a Marlboro advertisement. They softened it, turned it orange and called it a ‘speedmark’. But if you look at it closely it does genuinely look like a kiwi leaning forwards. The two ends of the logo aren’t the same length or angle. It gives the impression of a beak and a pair of little kiwi legs. Whether the unknown kiwi in the logo is intentional or it’s just ended up like that is unclear.']",0,43,0.36,0,48,48,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
