1k87mty,Teams worried about Madrid circuit,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k87mty/teams_worried_about_madrid_circuit/,2025-04-26, News,,"['Well, when the promotional video shows the car hitting the wall at turns 4+5 I think they have the right to be concerned.', ""As a spanish speaker, 'Madring' is such a fucking terrible name, I hope they change it because it sounds so goddamn awful."", 'It actually takes skill to design a race track that terrible', ""As someone from Madrid, I expected them to either build a new track or modify Jarama to fit the current F1 cars. Never in a million years it'd have occurred to me to use the streets around IFEMA to race, it's just such a boring place filled with roundabouts. I wish they'd let Montmelo host until we have a proper circuit."", 'Just leave it, we have Barcelona already. It is Spain and a building project.', '# Teams worried about Madrid circuit\n\n*The teams are worried. The Madring adventure is complex, and it is well known that it is behind schedule in certain areas. But until now, the only people complaining have been residents, local and regional government opposition, and some politicians. Now, however, it is the teams themselves who are beginning to ask uncomfortable questions.*\n\nIt happened last Sunday in Shanghai. Teams regularly meet with representatives of the Fédération Internationale de l\'Automobile (FIA), and the Chinese Grand Prix was no exception.\n\nThe agenda was devoid of technical issues and was dominated by a review of the sporting regulations for the rest of this year and 2026. Several changes to the regulations were proposed, such as what happens when there are starts after the safety car, some clarification on wet racing rules and the possibility of opening a closed park after the sprint race.\n\nAt one point during the meeting, the representative of one of the groups raised his hand and asked if there was any news about the CAD of the Madrid circuit, the future IFEMA street circuit. The curt reply from the FIA representatives was that it had not yet been approved and that they had no information to share with the participants.\n\nCAD is the computerized design used by the teams to analyze the different possibilities, with exact measurements, angles, cambers, distances, etc. The skeleton explanation given by the FIA commissioner makes it doubtful that they will be able to get hold of each team\'s internal programmes in time.\n\nThe teams need all this information as soon as possible. They want to start analyzing parameters such as the fast corners to check the aerodynamic possibilities, the slow ones to adjust the suspension, fuel consumption or downforce over the whole track. They want to arrive with their homework done.\n\nThe task is made even more difficult by the fact that next year there will be completely different aerodynamics with two DRS modes, front and rear, the so-called X and Z modes. The drivers must work on this in the simulator, and now they don\'t even know the exact dimensions of the track, the layout beyond the pictures published in the media, or even the location of the garages. They don\'t know the exact shape of the paddock, where the trucks will be, where the hospitality areas will be, or something as simple as where the plugs will be.\n\n**The teams, blind**\n\n""We\'re going in blind with Madrid,"" a source who wishes to remain anonymous told Motor.es. People are starting to get nervous and the general feeling is that they are late. The teams are not going to complain directly because the FIA is the interlocutor in these matters. The teams put pressure on the FIA and the FIA puts pressure on the circuit to speed things up.\n\nWhen it comes to a new track, the process requires a laser scan of the surface and translating all that data into the simulators. Then you work on it and draw conclusions, data and strategic forecasts, which can even affect the logistics.\n\nThe situation is the same for everyone, but until they have reliable data to work with, they will not be happy. The clock is ticking, the dates are ticking, and the cars of 2026 need a mountain of data. Nobody wants to be left behind, and this should be a wake-up call for the deadlines, which should be different for one of the most original and eye-catching projects of recent years.', 'I have the feeling no race will ever take place there. After all, its another huge corruption scheme by Madrid authorities like the Valencia circuit was.', ""If you started digging straight down at the Madrid Circuit and kept going you'd come out the other side in southern Hawkes Bay New Zealand, which is where Liam Lawson was born."", 'its monaco minus the prestige, rich history, iconic harbour, celebrities, that one time champion youtuber, and tax heaven.']",2822,306,0.98,2822,14182,14182,25,1,0.0,25

Hence, there have been multiple tire construction updates. Harder compounds also mean you’re less likely to reach a point where a tire could explode. That’s why they choose compounds weeks in advance for every race.\n\nTo me, the ideal solution would be to have only two compounds: one that’s really sticky but less durable, and one that’s less sticky but more durable. This would mean getting rid of the Hard tire in most scenarios.\n\nIdeally, Pirelli should develop a set of tires that degrade within a prescribed amount of time but don’t explode when reaching said limit.', ""I honestly can't see the pit lane speed limit being increased"", ""I find it unbelievable they'd even consider raising the speed limit in the pits"", 'Re-introduce the Hypersofts\xa0', 'A very interesting article.\xa0\n\nI think using tyre compounds that are not successive (e.g C1, C3 and C5 rather than C2, C3 and C4) is a good start.\xa0\n\nThe pit lane speed limit issue is interesting. Obviously we should bit make it highly dangerous for the mechanics in the pit lane but if a safe solution can be reached it would be interesting. Only problem I see is theres a lot more pressure on the front jackman.\xa0\n\nPersonally I think we need to look for that 2011/2012 era with the tyres when they would massively degrade and fall off a cliff and there would be big differences between cars.\xa0\n\nBack then almost every race was a two or three stopper.\xa0', 'Tyres that wear.

1k86rtd,Fernando Alonso's insane consistency between 2003 and 2008,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k86rtd/fernando_alonsos_insane_consistency_between_2003/,2025-04-26, Discussion,"I have been a long-standing F1 fan who witnessed both of Fernando's title winning seasons but I don't think as a kid I realized or recognized how great he was during the 2000s. I was also a Raikkonen fan so my hatred towards Alonso probably had something to do with it as well. I analyzed his points tally season by season and recognized ain interesting pattern between 2003 and 2008. Here's my takeaways:

\- The period between 2003 and 2008 spanned 106 races in total

\- In those 106 races Fernando failed to score 23 times, 18 of which were DNFs. 5 of his DNFs were mistakes on his own (Monza 2004, Montreal 2005, Fuji 2007, Montreal 2008, Valencia 2008). He was running in the points on each occasion apart from Valencia, where the collision with Nakajima happened on Lap 1 after the start. Every other DNFs were due to technical issues with the car.

\- In those 106 races Alonso failed to finish the race in the points only on 5(!) occasions, 3 of which occured in 2008: Silverstone 2004, Budapest 2005, Sakhir 2008, Monte Carlo 2008, Hockenheim 2008.

\- In 2003, Fernando either finished in the points or didn't finish at all due to reliability issues. Don't forget this was his first season in a competitive car after spending 2002 on the sidelines. He finished in P6 in the WDC.

\- In 2005, he failed to score 3 times: Montreal, Indianapolis and Budapest. In Montreal, he hit the wall, which was his only mistake that year. We all know what happened in Indy, and he had his front wing damaged by Ralf Schumacher after the start in Budapest which resulted in a scrappy race for Alonso. Otherwise, his worst finishing position was 4th in Monaco.

\- In 2006, he would have finished every race in the points, had it not been for that wheel nut issue in Budapest and the engine failure in Monza. He had those 2 DNFs, and finished 5th in Hockenheim and Indianapolis, but he was in the top 2 on every other occasion. (7 wins and 7 P2s).

\- In 2007, he finished in the points every race weekend, bar that mistake in the rain in Fuji.

\- Renault started 2008 on the backfoot, but Alonso was in the top 4 in the last 6 races, and finished 5th in WDC.

  
I think that's insane consistency for someone who started racing competitively in F1 in 2003. Those were his first 6 years racing wheel to wheel at the front. Many may argue that 2003-2008 wasn't even his peak with regards to his capabilities, and they might have a fair point considering how he performed during his Ferrari years. I don't think newer fans or even some older ones (like me) realize what a great performance he showed so early in his career. I truly hope that I can see him win at least one more time!

","[""Please also review Raikkonen's seasons between 2002 and 2007, as I recall he never retired due to his own fault. Maybe you could say it happened at the 2005 Nürburgring, because he flat-spotted the tire himself, which later led to his retirement."", 'He was the master of dragging a Ferrari shit box to 5th', ""2004 and 2007 are two of Alonso's bad seasons.\n\nHe was outscored by his teammate, Jarno Trulli, in 2004 before he was dropped and then he was beaten by a rookie Lewis Hamilton in 2007 just after he won two titles.\n\nI think his entire stint at Ferrari deserves slightly more credit and also 2006 is a special season where he beat Schumacher in a slightly worse car."", 'This post should be used as a case study for confirmation bias.', 'Is Fuji really his fault?
