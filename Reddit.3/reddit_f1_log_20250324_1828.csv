Let’s assume that Verstappen is (say) three tenths quicker than Lawson at this moment, intrinsically. Then add that this car is so difficult to drive that Lawson is yet to extract 3 tenths out of the car. Because he is driving this car both under and over the limit, the tyres are not in the right window, add an extra 3 tenths to that. So now you are facing almost a second of lap time difference between Verstappen and Lawson, and only three tenths of that gap is down to raw speed. The rest is about Lawson not being comfortable in the car. I know it’s just an estimate, but I don’t think that reality is vastly different.

I don’t understand that Red Bull cannot set up the second car more to Lawson’s liking (or Perez, Albon and Gasly before him).

1jipjgq,Ferrari in China hit rock bottom while the enigma of the SF-25 is revealed,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jipjgq/ferrari_in_china_hit_rock_bottom_while_the_enigma/,2025-03-24, News,,"['Focus on 2026 with immediate effect', 'If it’s truly the rear suspension design being inherently too soft and/or the new gear casing being too brittle to take the loads if the suspension is set to being harder, then Ferrari is completely done for the season, as neither change is something you can do fast, or even do at all without a chassis redesign.\n\nBy the way, article is signed by the three big names: Giuliano Duchessa, Piergiuseppe Donadoni, Rosario Giuliana - pretty much the closest we’ll get to an open admission bar a full-on statement by a team member.\n\nEdit: really the only hope is that with more kilometres racked up they might be able to find a setup that “clicks”, and that’s where Serra’s experience will be huge, but man it’s not looking good if they still got caught out by it on a super smooth track like China after the resurfacing.', 'Not the start of the season I expected, not the momentum being carried from 2024 that I too expected.\n\nThat seems like something that may not be fixed easily,...I don\'t know at the very least they must have a compliant car for the races (by that I mean a design that doesn\'t degrade the plank too much or the tyres) and that cannot wait as it would make them lose a lot of championship points and thus money AND hurt Ferrari\'s image like hell.\n\nI don\'t know how fast they can fix the rear design, depending on that complex answer, for sure, they would need to choose between an ""all in"" on 2026 or fixing their season if they believe a P2 or P3 in championship is reachable', ""Season is cooked. A situation where you can't even run the car properly without consequence is a fatal flaw. Impossible to fight for a championship like this."", ""I will give Ferrari credit for taking a risk by bringing a new car for the last season of a regulation change. It is easy to criticize them, but they must have thought their previous car had reach it's celling.\n\nI am not going to write things off completely this season. This had been the weirdest regulation cycle. Red Bull went from all conquering to 4th fastest in literally the same season. One upgrade can make a difference."", 'Translation:\n\nMcLaren put the weekend back in place by dominating the Shanghai Grand Prix, while Ferrari got lost after a promising start, closing with a sensational double disqualification. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were able to easily control the pace of the pursuers, no one had the pace to create great concerns. The degradation was under control on each compound, Andrea Stella confirmed that by monitoring the Stroll pace (departed with the hard) “we realized that a stop was the option to perform”. Haas also benefited from a winning strategy, diversifying and adapting to the conditions.\n\nVerstappen had an ineffective start but at least he was able to return to the distance, the RB21 seems a distant relative of the previous cars. Russell tried to stay around the cars of Woking with a good texture.\n\nThe Ferraris went close to disaster at the first corner, Leclerc fought well with a broken wing, despite a balance damage quantified in 2/3 tenths. For a long phase he could have been better than the seven-time English champion, which shows how well Hamilton’s settings had gone out of the window with high load.\n\nYet the worst was yet to come. The SF-25 remains a car with unknown reactions in terms of long run. From the sprint stars to the stables of the Fia sentence an hour and a half after the race. The inspectors of the Federation measured the cars and found them non-compliant. Leclerc’s SF-25 was disqualified for less than one net weight, Lewis Hamilton’s number 44 for excessive shoe wear that protects the bottom. As well as the Alpine of Gasly the riders have been removed from the standings. The rules in terms of compliance are not questionable and it has already happened that an auto-Venturi was found with excessive consumption of the underbody however suffering a double disqualification is an unacceptable episode for any team. In both cases, Ferrari cannot have benefited in terms of performance, they are both serious but venial errors, the adjustments are simply not working in the long race, unlike the sprint. This could not go unnoticed on a smooth track as the Chinese one is currently.\n\nTHE TECHNICIANS HAVE DISCOVERED THE ENIGMA THAT FOR THE OBSERVERS STARTED BY THE BAHRAIN TESTS.\nAS FAR AS I LEARNED, THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW DESIGN OF THE FRONT PULL ROD SUSPENSION, MUCH LESS WITH THE AERODYNAMICS IN THE STRICT SENSE SINCE IT IS COMPLYING WITH THE STABILITY REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe extra consumption of the plank is not a cause but a consequence. The structure of the rear air does not allow the expected stiffness, which obliges you to increase the height in a closed park to protect yourself with 100kg on board. The main clue is the rear suspension, approved in July last year, together with the new gearbox.\nThe Haas shares the mechanical parts and worked well after the Australian disaster, however it does not have the performance loading platform or the sophisticated Ferrari aerodynamics. In other words, the SF-25 struggles with the excessive softness that is compromising its operation. It looks like something already seen, for example, on the old Mercedes last year. The Red in the right conditions can generate much more load than the previous car, the sprint showed what the car could do with 35 kg of gasoline. The qualification after three hours canceled expectations again, less downforce in the curve and greater instability of the rear.\n\nLoic Serra arrived in October so relatively late on project 677. The French DT has returned to Maranello and is intervening to correct its effectiveness and reliability but clearly it is premature to formulate a solution or its timing. The problem is not easy to solve, the engineers are also working on some update areas that should be introduced new parts from Bahrain.', 'Knew it had to be the rear since haas didnt switch to the same front layout but they do get the rear end from ferrari.', 'How do you end up in this kind of mess at the last year of regulation?', 'From what I\'ve observed is that whenever Ferrari hit ""rock bottom"", they can _always_ go lower.']",301,103,0.97,301,100,100,76,23,0.010000000000000009,76

Do the current rules mean that every team is doing an estimate of how much rubber they will lose through a race and add some extra weight in their car? So if Ferrari's estimate is 500 grams and Mercedes's estimate is 700 grams, both cars start the race at different weights just because they estimate different tire wear?

Does it also mean that you have to add extra weight, just in case you want to go long on the same tire set in the end? So if you stay 30 laps on the same tires, you're legal, but if you stay out another 10 laps, suddenly you're not?

Does it also mean that a severe lockup or two during an intense battle can make your otherwise legal car illegal?

When someone crashes or has damage, we account for this weight loss by mounting a new part before weighing them or weighing them with the debris. I'm fairly sure the fuel also gets drained to account for different fuel use between cars. So why don't we account for tire loss when different cars will have different tire wear + drivers pick up different amounts of rubber marbles on their cooldown lap?

I understand why we can't remove the tires every time we use the weigh bridge in-session, but at the end of a race, we absolutely can afford to remove the tires and weigh the cars without them. So why don't we?

This feels really strange for a sport where we claim every gram matters... yet the weight of cars all over the grid can vary massively just on their estimate of how much tire they'll lose and also based on whether they stay long or not.","['The minimum of 800kg is car + minimum possible tyre weight when completely worn. So in any case a car is found to be underweight it’s the team’s fault.', ""> both cars start the race at different weights just because they estimate different tire wear?  \n  \nOr to read it another way - the team failed to consider their minimum weight based on their chosen strategies. They could have installed half a kg of extra ballast and they'd be fine.  \n  \nThe core rule is that car dry weight at any time during the competition shouldn't be below the set weight. This includes consideration of wear and tear components, including PU, tires or plank wear.  \n  \nOnly accidental damage can be replaced with equal specification equipment.

1jij2ac,Is Social Media Putting Undue Pressure On Teams To Make Driver Changes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jij2ac/is_social_media_putting_undue_pressure_on_teams/,2025-03-24, Discussion,"I'd like to think that F1 teams aren't easily swayed by public sentiment in regard to how they run their driver lineups. But over the last few years it's become evident that they do, at the very minimum, see quite a bit of the social media comments and reactions to anything surrounding F1. Particularly when it comes to anything having to do with drivers. The most recent example of this being the current situation with Liam Lawson who is only 2 races into this season with people calling for him to be replaced by Yuki Tsunoda. And it seems that this motion is starting to gain traction. I don't know if this is naive or not but it doesn't seem fair to Liam that people who aren't in the team or who race the car should be able to put pressure on his team to replace him. I feel like as a young driver he should be allowed to develop like drivers are supposed to. And part of me has been wondering how much of that pressure to make changes it influenced or exacerbated by social media.

Edit: Okay, learning very quickly that F1 teams have just been utterly ruthless the whole time. For whatever reason I thought that drivers were able to stay with teams longer than they do now.

1ji6ni6,are tires taking too much of the show?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ji6ni6/are_tires_taking_too_much_of_the_show/,2025-03-23, Discussion,"getting tired of car racing...  
the teams spend tons of money developing engines, aerodynamics, brakes, driving styles, and at the end the silly round black tire is the one that determines who is going to win... something they have not been involved in the creating or developing... all for the show, because the changing tires is a show extra for the public.

UPDATE: not answering any more posts...

UPDATE 2: I built my own kart when I was 10 (80 now), we were most concentrated on the engine, brakes, and driving skills... the tires were not discussed much.  
from most of the answers here, I see that most are interested in the show not the driving skills.  it is like going to the Circus and enjoying the show, not caring about if the animals were mis-treated to be able to perform.","['The tyres will always be the most important factor because they’re the things that are actually touching the ground. \n\nWe’ve had races and eras with bulletproof tyres that have no degradation.
