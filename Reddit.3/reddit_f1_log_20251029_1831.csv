With Interlagos on the calendar this weekend, I’ve been feeling a bit nostalgic. I went back through the history of Formula One season finales since 1990, and it reminded me how much the end of the year used to feel different.

1985 - 1995: Australia (Adelaide) closed the season

1996 - 1999: Japan (Suzuka or Jerez in ’97)

2000 - 2005: Mostly Japan or Malaysia/China

2004 - 2008: Brazil’s Interlagos - the golden run of finales

2009 - 2025: Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina Circuit has taken over ever since


For me, Interlagos just has something no other circuit can replicate. The atmosphere is electric, the weather unpredictable, and the fans make it feel like the whole sport’s heartbeat is right there in São Paulo. Those finales gave us so many iconic moments - Raikkonen’s 2007 title shock, Hamilton’s 2008 “Is that Glock?!” drama, Vettel’s 2012 charge through the field.

Abu Dhabi has its glamour, but Interlagos always delivered chaos, emotion and pure racing theatre. I sometimes wonder if my fondness for it is just nostalgia - because so many emotional memories are tied to it being the last race - or if it’s genuinely the perfect place to end a season. It's just such a great track in any case.  

What do you all think?
Do any of you miss Interlagos as the finale, or has Abu Dhabi earned its place?","['Absolutely: Interlagos is a great track with tremendous atmosphere, Yas Marina is a terrible circuit with no atmosphere. It reflects so badly on F1.', ""2016 would have been a lot more interesting with Hamilton slowing down in sector 3 and Rosberg having to pray Vettel of Verstappen didn't try any unconvential overtaking spots.\n\nInterlagos was the perfect ending and instead they replaced it with a track that perfectly represents the FIA."", 'I am biased but I would rather have the gran finale in a tradicional circuit rather than those petro ones.

This is the first season in at least a decade where two drivers on the same team were consistently in the running for the WDC.

I want to try some modeling on high-density data. (Ok, to be honest, I want to do high-performance computation on low-level hardware(i.e my laptop) to test how good I can get, but financial data generally isn't available and I don't want to do computer vision/media stuff.

I'd assume they're very good, but I want to see for myself.)

I've seen people post sector times and other data, and I've looked at OpenF1 and similar projects, but to the best of my knowledge:

1. There's no information on car setups and internals (like tire temps, body temps—is that even a thing? Does lower temp improve driver performance? At the very least, in Singapore and Qatar the effect of ""bad"" climate is clearly felt)

His interviews are negative and resigned after every race.
