Still, Yuki is either more experienced *or* was rated initially as having a higher ceiling than all of the past decade of drivers for the lead team that never managed a win. (I.e., Rookie and early-career Yuki seemed stronger than Kvyat when accounting for proneness to dumb incidents, and Gasly, Albon, and Lawson never had a real shot). Additionally, the car itself is rarely ever the clear fastest or even challenging for it over a weekend, with Max as an incredible confounding factor in rating performance. Nevertheless, a driver able to consistently stay 2-3 positions behind Max would have them a clear second in the championship, which is better than most years of the team's history. \n\nThe Racing Bulls sit at 7th in the constructors' championship, in the midst of a very tight 6-8 and abnormally close 5-9 when the whole field is incredibly tight. Two mediocre drivers could fly completely under the radar if they only occasionally made it into Q3 as long as they weren't under constant threat of Q1 exits. However, Hadjar has had incredible qualifying form, having made only one Q1 exit and taking 16 races to do so. Lawson bounced back to have strong mid-season form after falling short of optimistic expectations in his shock promotion to Red Bull. \n\nGiven that AlphaTauri finished 7th and 6th in 2020 and 2021 when Gasly was paired respectively with Kvyat and Tsunoda, and Toro Rosso recorded sixth-place finishes in 2008 with the Sebs and 2019 while primarily driven to the points by Gasly and Kvyat--all more experienced pairings than the current duo--I think there's a strong case to be made that Lawson and especially Hadjar are proving to be some of the strongest young drivers the team has had.

And he appeared to have the upper hand on what is now a less experienced Hadjar. I really don't understand how people keep comparing him to Lawson when he was genuinely the worst driver in a top car since Badoer in Ferrari.

Both scenarios Piastri can be very happy with, any weekend where Lando gets reduced points from finishing down the grid is more or less a win for him if he keeps it on track himself.

Is there a reason why they couldn't put a decent size RGB led indicator into the halo, so the driver you see it in their line of sight? TV showed the indicator on the steering wheel and it is tiny. Some of the track indicators seem to be in run off areas, while the driver would be looking at the corner, i.e. where they want to aim.

Race control would control the indicator and track position could be used to determine if it applies to that sector. Could also be used for blue flags etc. in the race.

""The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 27 (Nico Hulkenberg), team representative and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry, and in-car video evidence. Car 44 ran off at Turn 1. A yellow flag was waived at Turn 1 as Car 27 approached.  After the turn, Car 27 overtook Car 44, which was travelling at a significantly slower speed than Car 27, prior to the green light displayed between Turns 1 and 2.  This all occurred after the chequered flag had been displayed. The driver of Car 27 advised that he could not see the yellow flag because it was displayed after he began turning into the apex of Turn 1.  He then could not see the green panel because it was obstructed by Car 44 in front so he had no idea until he passed Car 44 that he was in a yellow flag area."" 

So are they supposed to come to an stop during a yellow flag now? Yes i know the flag rules no overtaking and so on, but it has always been a difference between overtaking an car that drives the same speed as you vs overtaking the one who caused the flag in the first place. And the same with the case from yesterday with Piastri, where there was a splitt second momentary yellow but he didn't slowed down while seeing the green light. 

What is the next thing they are going to drag drivers into the office for? Overtaking durin a red light because they drove past the striken car? ","[""When an infraction occurs, it is *required* to take note of it and investigate if any ambiguity remains. There is 0 reason and 0 need to be more lax with yellow- or red-flag infringements.

None of them got penalized for it, so why the twisted knickers?"", 'I think it\'s more track specific. Because most of the run offs require going into reverse, there are more ""infringements"" even though drivers have no other option than driving past a reversing car.

Some ads are in yellow (yes, flag is anyway visible, but it surely changes a bit the perception and still driver's fault). Also, flag position in some curves and last: delays in showing them after an incident or not getting to see them when they're closer to the incident than the next flag.\n\n\nI also felt the difference with other tracks. Something to investigate rather than only the infractions."", 'The things with flags has always been silly, I remember a few years ago Max got a penalty for not slowing down for yellow when there was a car all the way on the right side of a straight at the end of quali.\n\nCouple other drivers were fine because they lifted ever so slightly and lost a few kp/h in top speed.\n\nPassing the car with 345km/h or 342 km/h is apparently the difference between safe and not safe.', 'I want to know what’s up with the stuff on the track.

I’m curious if there’s video of that', ""just accept that you're wrong and move on."", ""One of the most chaotic qualifying sessions I've ever seen."", ""I'm not saying they are going to relax the rules, but using common sense, like when Hulkenberg overtok a slow moving Hamilton after Hamilton had been of track, where is the need for investigating it?"", 'I would defend this by saying the lift shows the driver has acknowledged the yellow flag and possible safety risk.
