He got to drive one of KCMG‚Äôs two Toyota-powered Dallara SF23s ‚Äî specifically, the car that was driven by Toyota‚Äôs WEC ace Kamui Kobayashi.\n\n>The 19-year-old British driver gave ringing endorsements to both the circuit and the car after 43 laps around Suzuka.\n\n>‚ÄúI had so much fun. My first time in Suzuka, and I was really happy to run here,‚Äù Bearman said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very high-speed track, and the Super Formula car was amazing to drive as well.\n\n>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much lighter than Formula 2, but the chassis is the same. The dimensions are very similar but the car is much lighter. So definitely in slow-speed corners, you feel it‚Äôs much more agile. The Super Formula is a bit slower on the straights because there is no DRS in Super Formula, but in the corners, the downforce is impressive ‚Äî I could dance with that car today.\n\n>‚ÄúCompared to F1, of course, it‚Äôs a bit slower. But the thing that impressed me the most about the Super Formula is the cornering ability. It‚Äôs very agile. The change of direction is very fast. It‚Äôs much, much lighter than a Formula 1 car. Of course, we are missing a bit of downforce overall, but the driving style is very similar to Formula 1. It just feels like a Formula 1 without DRS, so it‚Äôs really, really nice.‚Äù\n\n>Because he‚Äôd driven three races in F1 already as a relief driver for Ferrari and Haas, Bearman could no longer take part in the young driver tests at Abu Dhabi after the season. But he could take part in Super Formula‚Äôs last day of a three-day official test, alongside other rookie drivers hoping to land a full-time seat in the Japanese series in the near future.\n\n>His time behind the wheel was productive, despite a minor mechanical issue in his No. 7 KCMG Dallara-Toyota, and any apprehension he might have had trying to communicate with his Japanese engineers quickly dissipated as both parties communicated in fluent English.\n\n>‚ÄúFor sure, it‚Äôs been a great test ‚Äì really useful. I‚Äôm sad that I didn‚Äôt get to to do all of the laps that I wanted. We had a small issue in the afternoon with the turbo, which failed. But still, I learned what I needed to, and I definitely have a bit more experience going into the race next year.‚Äù\n\n>His best time from the Friday morning session was a 1m36.940s, 1.4s behind the fastest time of the week set by six-year Super Formula veteran (and fellow F2 alumnus) Tadasuke Makino. But Bearman feels that he could have extracted more pace without the turbo problem in the afternoon.\n\n>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really get to push flat-out with new tires in the afternoon, but I still learned the track, which was the main goal of this test,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúWhen I come back next year for the F1 race, I‚Äôll be in a much better position.‚Äù\n\n>With all three days of testing open to spectators, Japanese fans turned out by the hundreds starting Thursday morning when Bearman arrived, hoping to meet one of Formula 1‚Äôs newest full-time stars to get an autograph or a photo, or both.\n\n>‚ÄúThe fan turnout for a test was the best I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù Bearman recalled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen so many people for a test day, and their support has been incredible. They were so kind and respectful, giving me little gifts and really taking time to see me. It was really a special feeling and I was happy to give them as much time and photographs and autographs as I could.\n\n>‚ÄúBig thanks to Toyota that I‚Äôm here. I have to say a huge thank you to them for helping me to get this test and make it a possibility. It was definitely a big push for me when I knew it was an option and a possibility.\n\n>‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited to continue working with them into next year.
