In the Benneton there was Michael Schumacher and Jos Verstappen.

In the Williams you can see Damon Hill (whom I was a fan of at the time, not anymore). His teammate was David Coulthard.

Ferrari drove with Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi.



Some of the photos were made during the pit walkabout.

The photos from the cars on track were made from the inside of the track at Eau Rouge/Raidillon from the top of a building.
