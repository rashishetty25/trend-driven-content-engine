[...] At worst, Colapinto may be a crash risk, and may not be a superstar in the making - the sample set of a part-season at Williams is too small to know for sure on both counts - but he is a proven point scorer already and is a driver with ability.\n\nThis is something that I really agree with. Yea, Doohan was dealt an unfair and terrible hand, but it's not as if Colapinto was out of reach to Albon as a rookie with little preparation last year. I think everyone can agree, especially with his performance so far this season, that Albon is a fantastic driver.\n\nColapinto crashed a lot, but most importantly he had the pace. I believe that people just don't like the idea of him on the grid because he brings with him *very* annoying people.\n\nUltimately, this is another self-inflicted gunshot in the driver management side of things for Alpine.

Comparing Doohan to other drivers of his age is interesting. Colapinto finished 4th in his second F3 season with just two 2 sprint wins, whereas Doohan finished 2nd in his second season with 3 feature race wins and 1 sprint win. Their first F2 seasons are hard to compare with Colapinto getting called up to Williams before it  finished.\n\nDoohan's second season of F2 would probably have been a championship winning season if not for the setup/chassis issues (depending on who you believe) Doohan experienced in the first half of the season. He outscored the entire grid in the second half of the season to finish runner up to a highly rated Th√©o Pourchaire, who at that point was into his 4th F2 season.\n\nDoohan conclusively (imo) had a better F3/F2 junior career compared to Liam Lawson. Doohan only finished 21 points behind Lawson in F2 despite it being Lawson's second season compared to Doohan's first.\n\nF2 and F3 is littered with drivers who should have had F1 careers, so Doohan can count himself somewhat lucky regardless, but I think a lot of people have passed judgement on his speed without actually watching any of his junior career. The guy was genuinely rapid imo and might have flourished in a much lower pressure environment compared to the basket case that is Alpine.

1kfjgbg,Are the 2025 racing rules killing side-by-side battles?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfjgbg/are_the_2025_racing_rules_killing_sidebyside/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"The 2025 changes to racing rules are making proper wheel-to-wheel racing, especially over multiple corners, nearly impossible.

[Video - How F1's secret racing rules have changed for 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbTAHyzkrY)[Article - The new F1 racing rules that sealed Verstappen penalty](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/revealed-new-f1-2025-racing-rules-verstappen-jeddah-penalty/)  
The above video and article by THE RACE explains these changes well but I will give a summary below:

Under the new rules, if a driver is overtaking on the¬†*inside*¬†(and they are in control and within track limits),¬†**they no longer have to leave space for the car on the**¬†***outside***¬†**at corner exit**. That‚Äôs a major shift from 2024, where both drivers were expected to leave each other room if they were side-by-side at the apex.

Because of this rule change, if a driver overtaking on the inside manages to get alongside the wing mirror of the car on the outside, the car on the outside effectively has to give up the corner. The inside driver can now legally run them out of space on exit, so there‚Äôs little incentive to stay side-by-side. As a result, we‚Äôre unlikely to see drivers hanging it around the outside anymore, which basically kills the chance of multi-corner battles.

This rule change is why¬†**Piastri's Lap 1 Turn 1 incident** in Jeddah¬†was deemed legal. Under the 2024 rules, this move would likely have resulted in a penalty.

**TLDR: Inside car just divebombs, outside car either backs out or gets run off. Not much of a battle.**

Another key 2025 rule change concerns overtaking around the outside. Under the new guidelines, a driver attempting a move on the outside must now be¬†**ahead at the apex**¬†to be entitled to space on corner exit. Simply being¬†**alongside**, as was sufficient under the 2024 rules, no longer guarantees that right. This makes outside overtakes significantly harder and discourages side-by-side racing, as drivers will be less likely to attempt moves around the outside.

This rule likely explains why Verstappen wasn‚Äôt penalized for forcing Norris off in¬†**Miami Lap 1 Turn 2**¬†‚Äî Norris was only alongside, not ahead, so Verstappen wasn‚Äôt required to leave room.","[""So once the car on the inside is ahead, they have the right to the whole track? That's beyond stupid."", 'The interesting thing is that these changes resulted from a meeting with all drivers in Qatar last year, after criticism that drivers overtaking on the inside were being penalised too often.\n\nRussell spoke in an [interview](https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/13262139/qatar-gp-f1-drivers-fia-stewards-hold-productive-meeting-to-discuss-racing-rules-after-max-verstappen-and-lando-norris-controversy) about it:\n\n>""If you are able to stay on the circuit [when overtaking on the inside] you are in your right to run the driver wide, as it has been for all of us since go-karts,"" he said.\n\nThis is exactly what the drivers wanted (to be able to run the defending car off the road) and is more consistent with lower category motorsport compared to previous versions, according to Russell.', ""Yes. Take a look at the Ocon and Hamilton battle. Absolutely unreal battling by both and it was 100% fair. And Ocon didn't actually have to leave Lewis space according to the new rules (albeit that space was largely the run off, but such is the track layout), he didn't because he can actually race wheel to wheel. Historically he just chooses not to when it's a teammate lol.\n\nWheel to wheel racing has never been as low quality as it is now. And it's not because the drivers are incapable, it's because they're choosing not to because the rulebook is dumb as fuck and seemingly written in a way solely to cause debate.

Whether it is the unwillingness to break out of traditional norms to take risks in exchange for chances of winning or the organisation of the fold crumbling under pressure, changing team principals on a constant basis will not solve the problem at hand, especially since Vasseur was the man who narrowly led Ferrari to the top, had it not been for the middle stretch of the races. There is a case to be made with Binotto, but constantly being in the cycle of  shifting, blaming and replacing would only send the organisation back to square one, and fumbling over themselves\n\nThat being said, I also believe Vasseur needs to iron these issues out if Ferrari wants to salvage the rest of their season. Miscommunication between drivers and engineers are not the most unheard of, but for it to be a recurring theme is insane. Neither Leclerc nor Hamilton had adequate pace to catch Antonelli, and they barely kept Sainz at bay in a car believed to be much weaker than theirs. The issue that the drivers are figuring out the car's strengths and weaknesses, and trying to salvage what they can with its characteristics is concerning at this stage of the season.

It also made a great viewing experience to watch how the end of the long straight goes to see how far the leading car has to defend offline, and builds your anticipation for Turn 1.\n\nThe race settled down quite a bit after the VSC as the cars were mostly sorted in order of performance, but the Lando/Piastri/Verstappen battles was probably my favourite part of this season so far.', ""30+ sec down the road when not even leading from T1 is really a painful gap for everyone not named McLaren.

At least Schumacher had the H2H on his side versus KMag.\xa0\n\n\nI'd rather they go for drivers that haven't done basically pretty much a whole career already, but I understand that as a new team they need at least one experienced driver.\n\n\nThey could do like Audi and pair one veteran with a rookie or they could put two veterans in there and decide which of them is better suited for the long run.\xa0\n\n\nAs for Mick Schumacher specifically, I wouldn't mind either way.
