1. Drivers accumulate points for every position   
2. There is a POSTSEASON ( yes this is a motorsport but it's also american so yeah)  
3. Top 16 in the regular season (which lasts until Belgium here) Earns you a place in the playoff   
4. There are 4 post season round RO16, RO12, RO8 , and the final 4  
5. Everyone's points get reset apart from the postseason points you earn  
6. you get 5 bonus postseason points per regular season win   
7.Each knockout round runs for the 3 races where the bottom 4 get eliminated   
8. In the final race the final 4 go at it for the win whoever finishes ahead wins the WDC  
9. (This is for the NASCAR guys in this subreddit ) No stage points just cause the races are too short to implement it
