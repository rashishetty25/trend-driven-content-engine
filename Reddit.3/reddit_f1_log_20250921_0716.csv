Still, Yuki is either more experienced *or* was rated initially as having a higher ceiling than all of the past decade of drivers for the lead team that never managed a win. (I.e., Rookie and early-career Yuki seemed stronger than Kvyat when accounting for proneness to dumb incidents, and Gasly, Albon, and Lawson never had a real shot). Additionally, the car itself is rarely ever the clear fastest or even challenging for it over a weekend, with Max as an incredible confounding factor in rating performance. Nevertheless, a driver able to consistently stay 2-3 positions behind Max would have them a clear second in the championship, which is better than most years of the team's history. \n\nThe Racing Bulls sit at 7th in the constructors' championship, in the midst of a very tight 6-8 and abnormally close 5-9 when the whole field is incredibly tight. Two mediocre drivers could fly completely under the radar if they only occasionally made it into Q3 as long as they weren't under constant threat of Q1 exits. However, Hadjar has had incredible qualifying form, having made only one Q1 exit and taking 16 races to do so. Lawson bounced back to have strong mid-season form after falling short of optimistic expectations in his shock promotion to Red Bull. \n\nGiven that AlphaTauri finished 7th and 6th in 2020 and 2021 when Gasly was paired respectively with Kvyat and Tsunoda, and Toro Rosso recorded sixth-place finishes in 2008 with the Sebs and 2019 while primarily driven to the points by Gasly and Kvyat--all more experienced pairings than the current duo--I think there's a strong case to be made that Lawson and especially Hadjar are proving to be some of the strongest young drivers the team has had.

","[""Thanks for posting this, really valuable when we didn't get the clear Q3 comparisons we usually get.

Both scenarios Piastri can be very happy with, any weekend where Lando gets reduced points from finishing down the grid is more or less a win for him if he keeps it on track himself.

1nm3x2k,What is up with the flag infractions this weekend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nm3x2k/what_is_up_with_the_flag_infractions_this_weekend/,2025-09-20, Discussion,"Watching the training and qualifying and seeing all the infractions that get thrown around the flags, and when reading the official FIA documents i'm sitting here like, are you joking? 

""The¬†Stewards¬†heard¬†from¬†the¬†driver¬†of¬†Car¬†27¬†(Nico¬†Hulkenberg),¬†team representative¬†and¬†reviewed¬†positioning/marshalling¬†system¬†data,¬†video,¬†timing, telemetry,¬†and¬†in-car¬†video¬†evidence. Car¬†44¬†ran¬†off¬†at¬†Turn¬†1.¬†A¬†yellow¬†flag¬†was¬†waived¬†at¬†Turn¬†1¬†as¬†Car¬†27¬†approached. ¬†After¬†the¬†turn,¬†Car¬†27¬†overtook¬†Car¬†44,¬†which¬†was¬†travelling¬†at¬†a¬†significantly¬†slower speed¬†than¬†Car¬†27,¬†prior¬†to¬†the¬†green¬†light¬†displayed¬†between¬†Turns¬†1¬†and¬†2.¬†¬†This¬†all occurred¬†after¬†the¬†chequered¬†flag¬†had¬†been¬†displayed. The¬†driver¬†of¬†Car¬†27¬†advised¬†that¬†he¬†could¬†not¬†see¬†the¬†yellow¬†flag¬†because¬†it¬†was displayed¬†after¬†he¬†began¬†turning¬†into¬†the¬†apex¬†of¬†Turn¬†1.¬†¬†He¬†then¬†could¬†not¬†see¬†the green¬†panel¬†because¬†it¬†was¬†obstructed¬†by¬†Car¬†44¬†in¬†front¬†so¬†he¬†had¬†no¬†idea¬†until¬†he passed¬†Car¬†44¬†that¬†he¬†was¬†in¬†a¬†yellow¬†flag¬†area."" 

So are they supposed to come to an stop during a yellow flag now? Yes i know the flag rules no overtaking and so on, but it has always been a difference between overtaking an car that drives the same speed as you vs overtaking the one who caused the flag in the first place. And the same with the case from yesterday with Piastri, where there was a splitt second momentary yellow but he didn't slowed down while seeing the green light. 

What is the next thing they are going to drag drivers into the office for? Overtaking durin a red light because they drove past the striken car? ","[""When an infraction occurs, it is *required* to take note of it and investigate if any ambiguity remains. There is 0 reason and 0 need to be more lax with yellow- or red-flag infringements. Safety is not something you can just forego 'following the rules to the T' for due to 'it otherwise perhaps maybe inconveniencing the drivers'.\n\n>What is the next thing they are going to drag drivers into the office for?\n\nWay to be dramatic. None of them got penalized for it, so why the twisted knickers?"", 'I think it\'s more track specific. Because most of the run offs require going into reverse, there are more ""infringements"" even though drivers have no other option than driving past a reversing car. It appears the stewards this race are just being cautious and want to make sure none of the infringements are egregious and dangerous.', ""From what I could see in the broadcast, seems like a mixture of factors. Some ads are in yellow (yes, flag is anyway visible, but it surely changes a bit the perception and still driver's fault). Also, flag position in some curves and last: delays in showing them after an incident or not getting to see them when they're closer to the incident than the next flag.\n\n\nI also felt the difference with other tracks. Something to investigate rather than only the infractions."", ""One of the most chaotic qualifying sessions I've ever seen."", ""just accept that you're wrong and move on."", 'The things with flags has always been silly, I remember a few years ago Max got a penalty for not slowing down for yellow when there was a car all the way on the right side of a straight at the end of quali.\n\nCouple other drivers were fine because they lifted ever so slightly and lost a few kp/h in top speed.\n\nPassing the car with 345km/h or 342 km/h is apparently the difference between safe and not safe.', 'I want to know what‚Äôs up with the stuff on the track. I saw the balloon but did colapinto get hit by an apple?  I‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs video of that', ""I'm not saying they are going to relax the rules, but using common sense, like when Hulkenberg overtok a slow moving Hamilton after Hamilton had been of track, where is the need for investigating it?"", 'I would defend this by saying the lift shows the driver has acknowledged the yellow flag and possible safety risk. They can therefore be considered to have a greater understanding that an incident may have happened and will be more careful.']",0,43,0.38,0,289,289,0,0,0.0,0
