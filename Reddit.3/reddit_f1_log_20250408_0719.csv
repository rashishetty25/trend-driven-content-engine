Thanks!","['Falling asleep on lap 7 and waking up with two laps left to the grid being almost identical was a trip.', ""I have to say - I do think people are overreacting a bit coming off of this race in regards to these regs. I think the reasons why we've had such an astoundingly tedious race (even by Suzuka standards) is a combination of factors such as - late track resurfacing that caught up Pirelli and their tyre choices off guard, and the weather that was too dull, to put it simply (cool, but not damp or cool enough to make it interesting, like making cars slide all over the place, but neither was it warm enough to induce serious tyre wear). Having said that - no changes to the regs did make it so the team's were completely unobstructed from adding elements and making changes to their cars that would make them even harder to follow, but I do think this was an unfortunate exaggeration of the problem. On top of that - Pirelli cannot be completely absolved of the blame here. Their task is horrible, difficult, and the combination of those words, yes, but fact of the matter is - Hard is just an op tyre now, and that shouldn't be the case."", 'RBR still has the best on track operations. They are the team who makes the changes between Friday and Saturday work the most.', 'For everyone saying McLaren could have challenged Max with a split strategy, they are correct. However, Lando and Oscar’s side of the garage clearly see each other as the main championship rival. \n\nOne side of the garage will not be ready to take a statistically weaker strategy that can hand an advantage to the other, not at this stage at least.\n\nIt’s like asking Nico to sacrifice a win in 2016 to let Hamilton win against Max/Seb or something.\n\nThe McL’s aren’t that ahead of the pack as a 2016 Merc yet not early season I do not see any driver sacrificing anything.', 'Hirakawa going from FP1 in an Alpine to changing teams and doing FP1 in a Haas within a week is insane and I’m totally here for it', 'It will be interesting to see McLarens advantage at much hotter tracks considering we’ve had colder weather during the first 3 races. We will see if anyone can get near them in Bahrain and Jeddah where the weather is going to be much hotter.', ""Ah, Suzuka. Probably the best circuit in the world, and one I plan to go to next year, but yesterday was absolutely dull.\n\nOn one hand, I don't mind there being races like that. The 2010 season is one of my all time favourites but it did also feature several dull races. I think what made yesterday frustrating was the fact that across the whole grid, very little happened. The race between the front three was pretty much the only battle across the grid, and even then Norris never got close enough to even get DRS. Max won the race on Saturday, and the overall performance from him was probably his best ever. I know people rank CoTA 2021 as his finest race but I think this was better overall.\n\nThe main worry I've got for the season is Pirelli. It's a small sample size but so far the Hard tyre in both China and Japan was absolutely incredible. Zero deg, zero graining and easily the outright fastest race tyre. As a result, there is only one strategic option available (M-H). Pirelli either need to be a bit braver and make all tyres softer, or where possible the H needs to be a step harder so that it is truly slow and a two stop becomes a better strategy. Ideally the hard should be between 1.5-2s slower than the Medium. \n\nOddly, last year at Suzuka tyre deg was a really issue and we saw a mixture of 1,2 and 3 pit stops across the grid. Perhaps the resurfacing has made the track too easy on the tyres? Likewise, the cold weather probably helped. A track as brutal as Suzuka should not be an easy one stop imo."", ""Well that was a bit of a dull race. I did enjoy the tension from the top three basically being close together the whole race. With Max being the one in front though, I wasn't really expecting him to make a mistake. After the pitstops I didn't really think McLaren could win the race, unless Max' tyres would've fallen off massively.\n\nThe biggest issue with this race was that the resurfaced part of the track meant that there was a lot less tyre degradation than expected. It was also quite cool. I don't remember who said it, but on Friday during practice apparently there was a lot more deg. Contrary to some people I saw yesterday, I don't really blame Pirelli. Last season they brought the correct tyre range in Japan and we had the two stop. They simply can't account for everything, they don't know how much deg the resurfacing will bring, they can't control the weather.\n\nMaybe a bit of a weird opinion but I'm kind of glad that the TV director missed the pit exit shenanigans by their stupid decision to switch to Leclercs pitstop. It was the only thing that brought some tention because we missed what actually happened. Meanwhile if we'd been with Max and Lando the whole time, we wouldn't even have had the tention of 'did Max do something?'. We would have just seen Lando drive himself into the grass the first time around. And that would be it, nothing Max did wrong, just a bit silly from Lando."", 'I’m still recovering from my nap', ""Here's my take about how McLaren handled this race.\n\nMcLaren didn't want to risk undercutting Oscar past Lando and then have to handle the resulting situation afterwards, even if it meant handicapping themselves in the battle for the win.\n\nLando had a substantial gap to Charles and George, so he could've easily extended for multiple laps, and get some sort of tyre delta to Max.\n\nObviously getting the biggest possible delta to Max would mean Oscar undercutting Lando. Which can definitely result in a complicated situation later.\n\nIf the new tyre delta wasn't enough and Lando can't catch back up, he'd be annoyed at losing second due to being undercut by his own team. If Lando does catch back up at a time when Oscar is 1 second behind Max, Lando would want the position back and Oscar would be miffed at being asked to let Lando through when he himself is right behind the leader and pushing for the win. Even if one of their drivers did go on and pass Max, the other would leave the race disappointed and wanting explanations.\n\nThey intentionally went extremely conservative in an attempt to keep both drivers happy. That also gave Max an easier path to win this race. He still would've won regardless considering the lack of tyre wear and how difficult it was to overtake, but splitting strategies could've made him and Red Bull work for it a bit more.\n\nI don't think this conservative approach is sustainable long-term. Remember that Max nearly won in Melbourne when the McLaren duo were substantially ahead of the rest pace wise. If McLaren even give Max an inch, he will absolutely take it. Either McLaren need to show complete dominance and have a car that wins 75% of the races, or they'll have to make tough decisions soon if they are to win the WDC.""]",43,162,0.87,43,1189,1189,-3,1,-0.020000000000000018,-3

If that’s the case and Alpine retained Colapinto next year, by then he would be a “rookie” with a whopping 30-race experience. Many drivers have shorter career than that. Conversely, if Doohan managed to find a seat next year, he would not be considered “rookie” despite having just 4-race experience simply because one of those races are the first race.

And Antonelli has already silenced the critics. The Mercedes rookie finished all three Grands Prix in the points. After fourth place in Melbourne and eighth in Shanghai, Antonelli crossed the finish line in sixth place in Suzuka (April 6th). That\'s 28 points. In addition, there are the two points from the China sprint, when the teenager finished seventh.\n\n> Antonelli has settled into fifth place in the drivers\' standings. Thanks to his more than solid results in the first few races, Mercedes is second in the constructors\' standings. The factory team is already 36 points behind leader McLaren, but Red Bull and Ferrari are easily keeping the Silver Arrows at bay.\n\n> **Leading laps in Suzuka.**\nThe weekend in Japan didn\'t start particularly well for Antonelli. While teammate George Russell was long considered the only driver who could potentially challenge the McLaren, Antonelli struggled with the conditions. The Bologna-born teenager still had to learn the challenging rollercoaster. He also struggled with tire management to perfectly warm up the sensitive Pirelli tires for a fast lap.\n\n> After reserve driver Valtteri Bottas gave the rookie a few tips, things suddenly flowed smoothly: sixth place in qualifying, just one position and two-tenths of a second behind Russell. Things went even better for Antonelli in the race. While his opponents stopped earlier than him, he was able to record the first lead laps of his Formula 1 career. ""When I had clear air, the pace really improved and I was able to extend my stint on the medium tires. That was a good feeling.""\n\n> Antonelli was able to take advantage of the fresh tires towards the end of the race, setting two records. The youngster needed just 1:30.965 minutes for his 50th lap – no one in the race was able to beat that. Never before has a younger driver recorded a fastest lap and led a Grand Prix. World champion Max Verstappen was 6,803 days old in Barcelona in 2016. Antonelli was three days younger on race day in Japan when he achieved the feat.\nAntonelli is aware of his record: ""It was a nice feeling to lead the race for a few laps and to be the youngest driver in Formula 1 history to do so.""\n\n> **Russell as a benchmark.**\nThe development direction of the driver, described as a super talent, is in the right direction. But when will Antonelli first be on par with George Russell? He appears calm. ""I hope it will happen as soon as possible. But we also have to look at how strong George\'s start to the season has been. He already showed how good he is last year.""\n\n> According to Antonelli, part of the gap is also due to a lack of maturity: ""George always gets the most out of the car. I think that has to do with experience."" However, the challenger remains firmly convinced he can beat Russell at some point: ""The potential is there.""\n\n> **Student Antonelli.**\nSomeone who could give him tips on how to realize his potential at the pinnacle of motorsport is Valentino Rossi. Before the Japanese Grand Prix, Antonelli met up with his compatriot for a go-kart session. The nine-time motorcycle world champion shared some stories from his career. ""He told me a lot about his time. Now I want to go to MotoGP myself,"" the rookie beamed.\n\n> Before that, however, there are still Formula 1 races on the schedule. Antonelli also has to go to school for a few weeks. The final exam period is approaching. According to Mercedes, math is his particular problem area. He could ask his numerous engineers for some tutoring. The rookie is a great learner. He\'s already proven that in his short time as an F1 driver.', 'Rookie just showed the potential of that Mercedes. Of course there was even more pace in it. Another opportunity wasted by Russell.', 'If Antonelli does turn out to be superstar as he is currently appearing to do so will Ferrari try to poach him at some point?']",14,4,1.0,14,3,3,14,4,1.0,14
