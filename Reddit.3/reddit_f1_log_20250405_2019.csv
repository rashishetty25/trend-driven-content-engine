But then they heard he dipped a tire so they all kinda just dropped it?', 'Ant said he probably left the DRS open, he kept requesting they show the camera shot so he could confirm it.', 'Ant mentioned it right away', 'I think which broadcast you watch depends on what you want out of it.  I watched Sky for 3 years before switching to F1TV for the last 3.  Sky felt more traditional with sportscaster personalities and typical storylines being the emphasis.  \n\nWith F1TV, I enjoy the more technical discussions they emphasize with Sam, Jolyon, and David‚Ä¶ then the addition of the strategist with Ruth.  For FP1 this week, they had a long time former Red Bull crew member and it was fascinating to hear his take on what was going on.  Plus they have all the reserve drivers drop by occasionally.  It just feels much more interesting for my viewing preference. \n\nNeither are the ‚Äúright one‚Äù - just whichever one you enjoy listening to based on how you consume sporting events.

Expert commentator Villeneuve is not there - he is out traipsing around the circuit, which is a good thing; it\'s what they normally do with Brundle during FP2, it\'s a great part of Sky\'s coverage. Davidson is the second expert commentator but he\'s also not in the booth - to save some money he\'s back in the UK, so he\'s not actually there with Crofty.  \n\nWhen they show the onboard replays it\'s clear to me that Doohan doesn\'t switch off DRS by pressing a steering wheel button. I\'m watching wondering why they don\'t acknowledge that, I think ""maybe that\'s not how it works"", so I wait for the replay looking down the straight so we can see whether the DRS was open or not. \n\nF1 shows this replay once during the session, and it\'s while they are crossing to Villeneuve out on the track - so the replay is shown in a little thumbnail on the Sky feed; it\'s not seen by Villeneuve, and it\'s missed by Crofty. Kind of a perfect storm. \n\nThe weird part of this is that the producers or Davidson don\'t take another look at that replay to see what we all see.

But then the Dutchman put his Red Bull on pole position with a dream lap. There are four reasons why this miracle happened.\n\n> The radio call on the out lap spoke volumes. Max Verstappen loudly shouted his joy at his 41st pole position in Formula 1, his first since the 2024 Austrian GP, \u200b\u200binto the airwaves. Normally, the Dutchman is relatively relaxed on the radio. He\'s achieved so many victories and set so many fastest times in his career that one more or less doesn\'t elicit much emotion from him. But this time, everything was different.\n\n> The Formula 1 World Champion expected fourth place on the grid at best. His Red Bull struggled to find its form for three practice sessions, despite the engineers\' thorough redesign of the car. The Red Bull RB21 fluctuated between decent and undriveable. Verstappen complained that he never knew what the car would do in the next corner. In the third practice session, he was still half a second behind the McLaren.\n\n> Only the final intervention was successful. ""We completely overhauled our car,"" reported team principal Christian Horner. ""Everything was put to the test: the weight distribution, the downforce level, the damper, spring, and anti-roll bar settings, and the tire pressures.""\n\n> **Red Bull hit the window.**\nThe trump card played in crisis mode worked. Starting in Q1, the drivers sensed that the Red Bull was suddenly a good racing car again. ""The differences are minimal. If you fall out of the window by just a millimeter, you\'re immediately nowhere,"" Horner marveled. Verstappen praised: ""The car was difficult to drive for a long time, but we improved it step by step and worked our way towards a good setup.""\n\n> But then you\'ll still need Max Verstappen in the cockpit to convert the improved handling into the fastest qualifying time. ""I was at the limit everywhere, even a little over here and there,"" reported the defending champion. Not only that, Verstappen completed two clean laps in Q3. Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri, and George Russell all lost time in the first sector.\n\n> Piastri and Russell were blown away by the wind in Turn 2. On Saturday (April 5), the wind blew from the opposite direction to Friday. A tailwind made the notorious S-curves even more challenging than usual. Piastri\'s manager, Mark Webber, lamented: ""With any other Sector 1 time in his qualifying laps, Oscar would have taken pole position. But there\'s no reward for ideal times."" Horner applauded his driver: ""That was perhaps the lap of his life.""\n\n> **Verstappen\'s Fear Curve was Degner 2.**\nRed Bull responded correctly to the changed conditions. They opted for a touch more downforce to give the drivers more confidence through the S-bends. This also helped bring the tires into their temperature window for the beginning of the lap. But Verstappen\'s problem area wasn\'t the S-bends, but Degner 2.\n\n> Verstappen had lost two-tenths to the McLarens on every lap there, Horner revealed. Except for the decisive attempt. He was suddenly just as fast because he kept his tires in the window during the first section of the track to ensure optimal grip in his fear corner. The showdown in the duel with the McLarens was thus moved to the chicane before the start and finish. And there, the Red Bull driver took 66 thousandths off Norris.\n\n> According to Verstappen, pole position was the easier part of the task. Up until now, the McLarens had primarily demonstrated their strength in the race. However, there is a small glimmer of hope. The McLaren drivers were the only ones experiencing grainy front tires during the long runs in third practice. Norris more so than Piastri. An expert from the rivals commented: ""This suggests that they want to keep their rear tires as close to the temperature window as possible.""\n\n> Nevertheless, Verstappen prefers to play the pessimist for the race. He sees McLaren as the favorite. If it weren\'t for the weather. Rain is forecast for parts of Sunday. If that leads to mixed conditions during the race, it will play into the hands of the best Formula 1 driver.

Make his pole lap 10 minutes long, add all the dramas of him and his opponents and him possibly changing teams', ""Crazy performance by Max. On another day he is behind George and the McLarens.\n\nFelt like Max maximized the performance of the car and they didn't.\n\nSadly I don't this the grand Prix is winnable without something crazy happening"", 'I thought Hadjar, not Max was the one with the impossible pole?', 'Piastri lost three tenths in the first sector and was only 0.044 off across the line. Piastri with McLaren is way faster, but track position is very strong here, so we will see.', ""Sadly I don't think he can win the race. Mclaren's advantage is greater than within the reach of a good setup by Redbull. Norris and Piastri continue to let down the car.\n\nBut in the race, tyre preservation will lead the way. I still expect a 1-2 for Mclaren. At least one of them will overtake Max in the first stint, and the 2nd probably undercuts and that's that."", 'Definitely one of the 5 greatest laps in Suzuka history, simply phenomenal stuff from Max.', 'reminded me of that Monaco pole where he won it all in the last sector bouncing off the walls.', ""He actually was past the limit on a few spots, if you watch the onboard the rear loses it and he corrects almost immediately.

Interesting to see are their two different approaches: Lando lifts straight off the throttle and stomps then back on it, whereas Max has a more ""rounded"" approach to this. Lando gets the better exit and goes flat through T3, where Max has to lift slightly. Max gains time by being on the throttle longer inbetween T4 and T5, yet has a worse exit out of T6. In the Dunlop (T7), Lando has to lift slightly, which brings Max back to his tail. The Degners paint a clear picture: Max is longer on the throttle, lifts more gradual, yet steps on back on it just as quick, lifts more gradual, brakes 10 metres later and hops back onto the throttle as quick as Lando does. Nonetheless, has a worse exit out of the Degners and loses time approaching the Hairpin. Max has a slightly better exit out of it and begins clawing back speed to Lando. Spoon is the masterpiece of this lap: Braking about 40 metres later than Lando, he carries more speed into T14, where he doesn't bother with feathering like Lando, but steps once onto the accelerator. Yet, a significantly worse exits loses him quite some speed until T15. At the Casino Triangle, the strategy should be clear to everyone by now: Max brakes 30 metres later and and steps more onto the throttle inbetween T16 and T17, but has, yet again, a worse exit out of this tricky last corners. Lando gains much speed approaching T18, but is momentarily stationary on the throttle pedal. Max comes closer again and this was maybe the difference inbetween P1 and P2 today.

My conclusion: Despite his many complaints, Max has complete trust into the cars braking characteristics and is able to compensate much this way, despite not being able to step onto the the accelerator as soon as Lando (as seen inbetween the Degners and T16/17).  
(the eagle-eyed may have spotted, that Lando's throttle graph is slightly beneath Max's in the high-speed factions. In fact, he drives at 99%, a few spikes exclued, where Max is at 100%. Two theories of mine: Either the data is faulty OR McLaren has built in a mechanical resistor into the gas pedal, which the pilots have to overpower to get the pedal to the metal. Not to conceal massive power, but to slightly improve reliability) ","['I would love to see a ghost car lap comparison like the one for China', ""Margin so fine my blind ass without glasses couldn't see after staring for 3 minutes straight"", ""30M into the final chicane sounds way off.

I think the lack of trust he has probably comes to other areas and overall balance"", 'The start of the lap made all the difference. Max had a much faster start to the lap. By turn 2, he was already 0.1+ sec ahead. \n\nThe rest of their laps are overlapping.

It‚Äôs not quite as fast as the McLaren, and very likely not the Red Bull and Ferrari either if those teams manage to hook things up fully, but that stability is allowing Russell in particular to extract the limit of performance on a more consistent basis (though even he had issues with the tyre prep in Q3 today)', 'The Chinese GP weekend gave a lot of info about Mclaren. They were difficult in the sprint quali, and outright slow in the sprint race. But then they were much better in the regular quali and fast in the race.\n\nFor me this means that the car is good when they get the setup right, but it is sometimes a bit tricky to get it perfect.\n\nIts also worth considering that Piastri and Norris are constantly pushing each other, and both are likely ""outdriving"" the car, which will lead to some mistakes. Despite that, they both put in great laps today, hich would have been good enough for pole on another day\n\nAlso, don\'t expect a 2022-2023 type quali and race dominance. The field is much closer, and the Mclaren isn\'t nearly that fast']",0,62,0.27,0,59,59,0,0,0.0,0
