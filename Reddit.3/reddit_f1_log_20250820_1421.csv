What I think I’ve learned about him, and just kind of watching how this all has unfolded over the last six months, the issues that Lando has are so much more with internal pressure than external pressure. So when people start talking about, ‘Oh he makes all these mistakes, he can’t take the pressure’ I think it’s when he’s exclusively putting pressure on himself.”  
  
“What’s really been impressive about Lando is he’s had a few races where’s he’s had incredible pressure in the car from somebody else, and he has not faltered. The first stint of the season, in Australia in the wet, He had the lead but Piastri was absolutely hounding him, in some of the most difficult conditions you could have possibly imagined, and he didn’t make a mistake, at least he made the same mistake that Oscar did and it worked out worse for Oscar, but like he withstood the pressure.”  
  
“Then you go all the way to this most recent race, you had Oscar catching him with a massive tire advantage the last 10 laps, he had to be picture perfect and he did not falter, and there’s a bunch of examples in between. So when people talk about Lando’s mental strength, I think there’s some things he can clean up when he’s putting pressure on himself, but what’s really impressive and what arguably harder to get better at as a driver, is dealing with that pressure on the racetrack inside the race car, and he’s doing that really well. So if he can keep putting himself in the position to be in front, I think he’s going to be really hard to beat.”

He would fall into a hole and never climb back out of it, just spiralling down for 4, 5, 6 races at a time. Instead what happens is that he has a shit weekend, erases it from his mind and goes again, more often than not putting in a great performance. To me that shows a significant amount of resilience.

1musypy,Lando talks about how his Monaco pole was emotional because of qualifying doubts this year,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1musypy/lando_talks_about_how_his_monaco_pole_was/,2025-08-19, Video,"Transcript: You know, actually the only emotional moment I had was pole in Monaco.""

Interviewer: ""Why was it so emotional?""

""Um...just because sometimes proving to myself that I can do it is, like - that's how I've always been my whole life. A majority of things are mental, and that's the tough side. So for me, the happiness comes from when I prove something to myself. That's how I've always been driven and how I feel like I've succeeded. Because I've never had any false beliefs. 

So when you have a trend of certain things - like, this year, some of my qualifyings have been a bit worse than they have been in previous years and I've struggled just that little bit more. Then of course every now and then you question yourself a little bit - I do. That's just the honest side. I'm like ""damn, am I just not as good as what I was last year, or have I lost a little bit, or is it because I'm not getting the correct feelings?"" 

And when I'm realistic then it's like *I'm against the best drivers in the world*. If things aren't perfect, I'm not going to be on pole - I'm not going to be in the position I want to be. And I question myself - it's not that I don't believe in myself, it's just that I question. The thought's there. And I don't think that's a bad question to have - as long as you turn it into a positive thing. Like let's look into it, see what you're doing differently to last year or why are things not as good. 

And I had those questions for a little while, so when I went to Monaco - the trickiest one of the year, so many things can so easily go wrong, that one place qualifying's the most important thing in the world - and I went out and improved...like *ah, I've still got it.""*

1mv96jx,Looking back at the criticism regarding Sauber promoting Zhou into F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mv96jx/looking_back_at_the_criticism_regarding_sauber/,2025-08-20, Discussion,"It seems like a long time ago, but I remember back in 2021 when the rumours that Zhou would be promoted to Sauber began. I remember the fury that people possessed in this very sub that he would be getting the drive over other drivers.

To be fair, it wasn't without reason. 2020 saw Nicholas Latifi get promoted to Williams, whilst 2021 saw Mazepin get promoted to Haas. Pay drivers in F1 is nothing new, but here we have two drivers severely underdeliver in their rookie seasons, and the prospect of a third rookie driver there to yet again underdeliver spectacularly wasn't very promising.

What makes it even worse were that other drivers with more convincing resumes weren't being considered for F1 at all. The most obvious example being Oscar Piastri not getting the seat, despite him winning F2 in his rookie year. People were furious that Zhou got the Sauber seat over him. Granted, by Piastri's own admission, he was never in contention for that seat, but you could certainly understand why people were annoyed.

It wasn't just Piastri though. I remember people being disappointed that Theo Pourchaire wasn't given a crack at the whip, with many people touting him at the time of being a star of the future. Nick De Vries was also a name that came up a bunch in the initial Sauber 2022 rumours, and I remember people really hoping that he'd get the seat over Zhou.

The point being, Zhou getting promoted to Sauber wasn't a very popular decision, and many expected him to be on the level as Latifi and Mazepin. I even recall a few comments on this sub predicting him to be *worse* than Mazepin. All of this made me all the more happy for Zhou when he scored a point in his very first race, and proceeded to be a perfectly competent driver for the rest of his career.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not touting Zhou to be a wonder kid or anything, but he was nowhere close to being considered one of the worse drivers in F1, and he was miles better than Mazepin and Latifi. Zhou was able to score points in all three of his seasons for Sauber, which isn't anything to snub at considering the quality of the car in 2024 in particular, and whilst Bottas was definitely better than him, he didn't completely annihilate him the way a bunch of us were expecting.

I think another thing to point out is that a lot of the fury of all the other drivers not making it to that Sauber seat doesn't really exist anymore. Piastri made it to F1 the following year with McLaren with very little else needing to be said about that move. De Vries did eventually make it to F1, but he undeniably underdelivered, and whilst Pourchairre sadly didn't make it to F1, I'd argue he never really grew as a driver as much as he was expected to, following his initial F2 season. Yes he was talented enough for F1, but I'd argue he wouldn't have been the superstar that everyone at the time was predicting him to be.

Throughout Zhou's career in F1, the quote ""he's proven that he deserves to be in F1"" was spoken out a lot, and the main reason for that is that prior to his debut in 2022, a lot of people didn't believe that. He may not have been the very best, but for China's first F1 driver, he did a remarkable job representing his country, and he was a whole lot better than many other drivers that proceeded and succeeded him, which had far more compelling resumes.","[""It's difficult if you aren't part of an academy to get a good seat in F1."", 'If you want to go and read something funny, in 2020 people here were pissed that Renault picked Alonso instead of Zhou to replace Ricciardo.', ""It also helped him that he is geuinely likable person and having Bottas guiding him in all areas...  Bottas 2.0 was in full swing, his media game is strong and a lot of that spilled over to Zhou's corner, they were popular driver pairing.\n\nI think he did just fine, not stellar but fine job. He was instantly hired as reserve driver by Ferrari too."", ""People just really, really dislike pay drivers. A lot more of the latest batch rookies are well received because they performed highly in junior series as well as F1. Getting promoted after finishing away from the top in F2 while the champion barely gets a free practice session just doesn't feel right.\n\n\nZhou has been very fortunate. Drivers have been sacked for way less."", 'I think disappointment at Giovinazzi not working out drove some of the anti-Zhou commentary, and sinophobia was likely an element with some people. As an Alfa supporter I was happy to be a Zhou supporter.\n\nSomehow his last year was the most disappointing, although hard to disentangle that from how awful the team was between Vasseur and Binotto.', 'He was on average 0.600% slower than Bottas in qualifying last year, the fact that somebody is even attempting to defend that is ridiculous. Just for comparison, Sargeant, driver which got by far the most shit last year was 0.280% slower than Albon and that’s with driving the fucked up chassis for most of the year.', 'Was he as bad as Sargeant, Latifi, Mazepin, or Schumacher? No. \n\nWas he ever better than about the 18th best driver on the grid? no.\n\nI’m fine that he got a few years to prove himself in F1, and he was good enough that he wasn’t an egregious pay driver. At the same time, in no way can his stint in F1 be considered successful…unless you consider it a success that he cleared the bar of not being embarrassingly bad. He was just plain old bad.', 'He exceeded the very low expectations in his first two years, sure. But, for whatever reason, he was as bad as people thought he initially would be last year. He qualified 3 tenths off 19th at Monza, two tenths at Miami, half a second at Monaco, 3 tenths in Canada, two tenths in Austria, half a second at Spa, half a second at Singapore, 4 tenths at Mexico, 6 tenths at Brazil. He qualified more than half a second off Bottas on\xa0**NINE**\xa0occasions.', 'I’m sorry but being slightly better than Latifi does not prove that he was good enough for F1. They were more deserving drivers for his seat and his results in his 3 F1 seasons doesn’t change that.', ""Zhou still wasn't good enough. F1 is a cutthroat sport with only 20 spots so being competent should be the bare minimum expected considering at no point was anyone ranking zhou above the 18th best driver on the grid""]",28,43,0.65,28,42,42,21,9,0.09999999999999998,21
