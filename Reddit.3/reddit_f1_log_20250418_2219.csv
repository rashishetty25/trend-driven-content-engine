""What does seem proven is that Milton-Keynes is encountering enormous integration problems between the combustion engine and the electrical system. They can't quite get the hang of making them work together. The two elements work fine separately, but they're struggling to get them to share their energy in unison.""

""Given this situation, in coffee shop chats and hallway discussions, what's being discussed internally is that someone has floated a possibility: continue using the Honda engine next year. In doing so, use Racing Bulls as a guinea pig, with whatever Red Bull Powertrains is capable of creating, regardless of its current state.""

And the million-dollar question arises: can this be possible? The answer is yes, it can. Apparently, Ford has a contract with Red Bull Austria to govern the designs of its two teams. When considering this possibility, everything suggests that the contract states that they must use their engines, or propellants associated with their name, but it doesn't stipulate which specific team or how many they must use .

Will it be this week? I don't know. Too much depends on how other people do. I don't think people should overreact to practice times though."", 'Translation and full article:\n\n> **McLaren is the team to beat, even on the second-fastest track on the calendar. Red Bull is back within one lap, Ferrari is better than its lap times suggest, and Mercedes is still searching for its form. The practice analysis.**\n\n> McLaren is playing with the competition in Jeddah. The lead of the day\'s fastest driver, Lando Norris, over Max Verstappen isn\'t huge at 0.280 seconds, but you always get the impression that the McLaren drivers still have something up their sleeve. Both drivers eased off the throttle shortly before the finish line. And neither had optimal laps.\n\n> But who had that in the evening hours of the first day of practice? The Ferrari drivers had to repeatedly abort their attempts. They\'re better than fourth and 13th place for Leclerc and Hamilton, respectively. George Russell in the Mercedes also didn\'t navigate the traffic optimally. Andrea Kimi Antonelli was slowed by a wall kiss. Pierre Gasly surprised everyone with a fastest time in the first practice session and lacked some grip in the second. In the long runs, however, the Alpine was the second strongest driver in the field.\n\n> Traffic on the Jeddah Corniche Circuit is just as big a problem as it is in Monte Carlo. The difference is that the cars are traveling much faster. Time and again, there were hair-raising evasive maneuvers. The section between Turns 4 and 8 is particularly dangerous. All blind corners, with hardly any room to maneuver. Q1, with 20 cars on the track, will be a challenge for everyone. Even one of the big drivers could get caught out, especially since warming up the tires is causing major problems for everyone.\n\n> Yuki Tsunoda\'s accident ended the long runs eight minutes before the checkered flag, leaving only short runs. Max Verstappen completed the longest distance with seven consecutive laps.\n\n> This was frustrating for the teams. The endurance runs in the afternoon heat were irrelevant, and the evening race simulations were too short to draw any definitive conclusions about tire durability. Since Pirelli supplied a level of softer tires this year, the teams are missing important information for their race strategy. McLaren boss Zak Brown, however, could still envision a one-stop race with medium tires at the start and hard tires at the finish.\n\n> **Who beats McLaren?**\nThe answer must be: none. Neither McLaren driver had optimal laps and were still in the lead. Lando Norris had to overtake two drivers in Turn 13 and managed to gain a tenth on his second attempt. By then, his tires had already lost grip. Oscar Piastri clipped the wall.\n\n> The two-time season winner demonstrated with his four-lap long run that McLaren will be in a class of its own in the race, even more so than in qualifying. His average time of 1:33.949 minutes remained unmatched.\n\n> Next best was Pierre Gasly with a time of 1:34.539 minutes. Even though Gasly only finished eighth in the second practice session, the Alpine driver could give McLaren\'s rivals Red Bull, Ferrari, and Mercedes a run for their money. And not just because of his strong long run. In the first practice session, with track temperatures reaching 50 degrees Celsius, Gasly set the fastest time. ""We were lacking a bit of grip in the evening,"" explained the Frenchman.\n\n> **Is Red Bull back on track?**\nThe track suits Red Bull, even though Max Verstappen again complained of understeer in slow corners and oversteer in fast corners in the first practice session. However, on the smooth asphalt, the tires don\'t suffer as much as they did in Bahrain. In the cool evening hours, the Red Bulls were almost back to normal. Verstappen lost almost three-tenths of a second on the fastest time and was best of the rest. Only in the race simulation does the situation continue to look bleak. McLaren is an average of 1.1 seconds faster.\n\n> Sporting Director Helmut Marko reveals: ""We made significant changes to the car between practice sessions and tried out a new setup. It worked very well on a single lap, even though we still lost two to three tenths to the McLarens. We were too slow in the long runs. That\'s where our old problem caught up with us: the tires overheat. We now have to find a compromise between maintaining the speed on a single lap and better protecting the tires in the race.""\n\n> Yuki Tsunoda is getting better and better at the Red Bull, finishing sixth, only four-tenths behind his team captain. His positive impression was dampened eight minutes before the finish line. Tsunoda\'s left front wheel touched the wall on the inside of the final corner and slid into the concrete wall on the opposite side. Marko nevertheless praised his number two: ""The speed is good, and the gap to Max is absolutely pleasing.""\n\n(1/2)', 'Sauber upgrades are doing something.
