He likes that strong initial turn in. That is very similar to Hamilton.\n\nHamilton is an aggressive driver who will drive the car on the nose and can live with the back end moving. \n\nThere is something about this current generation of cars that don't really favour this style of driving. It seems because a lot of the downforce is generated from the floor, they respond better to the smoother more gradual inputs, if you brake late and then aggressively turn the car it creates pitch and dive that takes away floor downforce.\n\nThere is a distinct trend of drivers who like aggressive initial turn in somewhat struggling with this generation of cars.\n\nI actually suspect that the ground effect cars have really changed what style of driver is successful. Leclerc also drives the car like this and those aggressive drivers seem to have somewhat been hindered more than the traditional smooth, high minimum apex middle of the corner drivers."", 'That red beam in the photo, is that from Darth Toto?', ""Lewis himself said this, that he does not want to dramatically change his driving style, plus after the summer break the difference in qualifying times has increased, it can't just be because of Lewis"", ""Toto's just hoping that Lewis doesn't find that sandbag they chucked in the back of the car."", ""They're really rolling with something Hamilton said sarcastically. But cant blame them for writing stuff when he's saying shit like this."", ""I was wondering if it has anything to do with the team just witholding info from Lewis due to his departure.
