1h2jk4a,Interesting snippet from Saward on the FIA ethics committee firings,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h2jk4a/interesting_snippet_from_saward_on_the_fia_ethics/,2024-11-29, Discussion,"https://joesaward.wordpress.com/2024/11/27/green-notebook-from-sisimiut/

there is now a proposal for the President and Deputy-Presidents to be paid salaries. While I think it is a good idea in principle ... the problem is that getting a salary is actually against the ... Association Loi of 1901 which exists for non-profit entities in France.

This is a problem that Max Mosley ran into years ago when he tried to move the FIA to Switzerland and subsequently received a tax demand from the French government  ... Today the FIA remains under French law because it does not want to settle a tax bill and leave. However, there is a Swiss version of the federation as well. The two FIAs have consolidated accounts, but they are run under different sets of laws.

This .. worked fine until the President tried to claim expenses for his own private jet from the French FIA. He does not need the money (he comes from a mega-wealthy family) but he wanted to use the money to establish a fund that would be distributed to small FIA clubs around the world which struggle to pay their bills. ... it was pointed out that this scheme might be misinterpreted when there was an election ... as a way to buy votes ... 

...the audit committee questioned the idea and since then several of them, including the president Bertrand Badre and Britain‚Äôs Tom Purves, are no longer involved. This may also be why there have been changes on the ethics committee as well, and the reason that the compliance officer has just departed.

so many FIA people have left during Ben Sulayem‚Äôs presidency that they could all get together and organise conferences to discuss their stories. The latest to go, I am told, are two stewards: Tim Mayer of the US and Singapore‚Äôs Janette Tan. They follow the recently despatched F1 Race Director Niels Wittich and a lot of others, some of which have been reported upon and others who have not.","['I was under the impression that the President was entitled to remuneration:\n\n7.4 The President of the Senate, the Deputy President for Automobile Mobility and Tourism and the Deputy President for Sport may be entitled to remuneration within the framework of the performance of their elected mandate.
