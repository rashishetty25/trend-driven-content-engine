They got introduced to F1 with a second-half career unchallenged Lewis that was in a dominant car, and therefore drove very gentlemanly. They never saw early Lewis. And then came Max, and people went nuts about his driving. Last year Leclerc essentially admitted he’d drive the same way if fighting for a title, Lando will probably drive like that this year, Piastri will and Kimi will too. Heck, maybe even Lewis will go back to his old ways if he can challenge for the title. Normalcy is returning to F1.', '>**Antonelli towards the debut in Australia: ""In F1 you have to be ruthless""**\n\n>The Australia GP will mark the return to F1 of an Italian pilot on an official weekend, with Andrea Kimi Antonelli who will debut at the wheel of the Mercedes W16 . The Bolognese pilot will thus complete its road to F1 reaching what she wanted to identify as a starting point rather than arrival. Despite this, the emotional component can only be intense on the eve of his first weekend in F1. Antonelli has already performed well with the W16 in Bahrain tests in terms of feeling with the car, but in a long interview released to the Sky Sport microphones he told how only by crossing the gates of the Melbourne paddock will manage to make how much road he really traveled.\n\n>**Antonelli: ""I will realize that I am in F1 only in the Paddock of Melbourne""**\n\n>Being a Formula 1 pilot involves numerous commitments from the winter stop, which Andrea Kimi Antonelli has said to have been intense in terms of preparation, inside and off the track. ""I stopped two weeks at Christmas and then went to Adidas, where I did some physical tests, then I did the first test, just to resume the pace a little,"" said the young Italian driver. ""I drove the Mercedes of 2020. A nice car monster."" Antonelli then told what is the feeling of being able to drive for the first time an F1 as a pilot holder on a race weekend; An emotion that, despite the first official commitments of the Prevalson, will only be unique when it arrives in the paddock in Australia. ""There was the event in London, then the Bahrain tests, but I think the first time I walk in the paddock will be the moment I will make and say \'it\'s all true\'."" \n\n>Before pointing his gaze to Australia, Kimi, however, recalled where all this began, with the video call of last summer in which the Mercedes leaders announced that he would lead Mercedes in 2025. ""I was at home with my parents and I made this video call and in which Toto were, James Allison, Bradley, all \'big\'. Toto immediately went straight to the point and said to me: \'I don\'t want to wait for you, next year you will be our F1 driver . I didn\'t sleep at the night, I was two hours to watch the ceiling. Relationship with Toto? He is a great person and I\'m happy to have a person like him by my side. "" \n\n>**Work with Bono and how the pressure is managed in F1**\n\n>But can an F1 pilot be afraid of something? ""As a child I was afraid of the darkness,"" said Antonelli. “A fear that maybe sometimes I can have is that of not performing, maybe to go to the track and say: \'But if not pierced and if I can\'t keep the same level? But I must say that on certain occasions it can help. "" A fear that the pilot who grew up in the Mercedes\' Academy, however, has been able to manage well to the sound of victories and titles conquered in the preparatory categories. Going beyond the pure performance gap of the vehicle available, one of the greatest changes that a pilot is facing is certainly due to the figures at his side. “On a race weekend for me and George there will be at least twenty engineers . It is very nice because however you go a lot more in detail. Maybe every engineer asks you a different thing about the car, obviously I interact a lot more with Bono [Peter Bonnington], which is my performance engineer , then there are all the others too. "" \n\n>Although today\'s rookie arrive in F1 with a level of preparation that is not a little advanced compared to what happened in the past, the pressure to be managed and the so -called \'to make the bones\' are aspects that only by experiencing the maximum protagonist category can you fully acquire. “It does not happen every day to be in this position, I had to work to arrive where I am now. I am happy to represent Italy in F1 and the goal is to bring the Italian flag back to the top step of the podium , "" he said speaking between past and present. A key role in his path Antonelli relegated him to the family and his father Marco, thanks to a decades of experience in Motorsport. “To manage the pressure in the first place I speak with my father . Then, however, a small group of people you trust and with whom you have the confidence that you can express how you feel, especially in the most difficult moments, is enough. "" \n\n>**On the opponents in F1: “I have already noticed how ruthless Max is. In F1 there are no friends. "" And then he jokes: ""On the kart I beat Leclerc\'s time""**\n\n>After his announcement as an official pilot, the 2006 Bolognese pilot took part in two free sessions, where he said he immediately understood what it means to run against drivers of the caliber of Max Verstappen. “I have already noticed how ruthless Max is , for example FP1 in Mexico I was preparing for this lap and he pulled me a detached just last sector of the last lap. Outside you have no friends, you have to be due because it is also a way to get respect from others . Obviously respecting the rules, but you have to show that you are not there to play, do seriously. "" Moving instead on a nicest anecdote, Kimi Antonelli told about when, during a holiday in Greece, he beat the record signed by Leclerc in a Kartodromo in Mykonos. “Apparently yes, I beat his time. It was very nice because they were kart for rental but modified, so I was impressed. "" To try to beat the Monegasque pilot and beyond, the Italian rookie will not have to wait much, because the GP of its debut in Australia is now upon us. ""I am sure that if you start on the right foot it will be a good year and it will be fun,"" concluded Kimi.', 'Very curious to see how this kid develop.', ""Love to hear it. He already has so much pressure on his young shoulders. But I'm genuinely rooting for this kid.

1j7ztsj,Enough about the best drivers to never win a championship...

Some may say Stirling Moss, others say Ronnie Peterson. But that's not what I wanted to talk about today.

I wanna ask you, who do you think is/was the best team to never win the world constructors championship?

Was it BAR who came 2nd in 2004 and to this day hold the record for the most podiums without a win as a constructor?

Or was it BMW Sauber who looked genuinely competitive at the beginning of 2008 but really dropped the ball in 2009 and then pulled out?

Was it Jordan who had a shot at the 1999 title despite their funding being far off the one from Ferrari and McLaren?

Was it Ligier who came home in 3rd and 2nd in 1979 and 1980 respectively?

Or was it an entire different team, maybe even one that's barely mentioned at all? What are your thoughts?","['How about the Honda team who built a championship winning car then sold it to Brawn GP at the last minute \\*and\\* gave them $100m..', 'I’d say the original Renault team is in with a shot.

They had both the title contentions and the longevity which few other teams had, without ever quite breaking through to win.\n\nThey might've won in 1979 if not for Guy Ligier pushing for a redesign of the JS11's underfloor which ended up being worse than the original parts. Instead it was Williams who ended up taking up the position they had held at the start of the year as the top ground effect car.\n\nThey came remarkably close to winning the driver's title in 1981 too (Laffite was still just in contention at the final race of the season, and had several incidents such as at Zandvoort where he lost points which could have made the difference to make him champion)"", 'BMW in ‘08 certainly stands out as the biggest missed opportunity in my lifetime. It’s so frustrating looking back. IIRC, they had targeted winning their first race that year, and as soon as they achieved that (at Canada) they abandoned their 2008 car to focus on the new regs, even though they were leading the drivers’ championship and only 3 points off the constructors lead at the time. By the end of the season, they were being lapped by the real contenders. A horrible waste of a superb car.', 'Team Silverstone, in all its many incarnations.
