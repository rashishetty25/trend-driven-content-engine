1klugaz,Timing tower,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1klugaz/timing_tower/,2025-05-13, Discussion,"I'm watching the 2020 Sakhir GP right now because of the YouTube marathon and I realized how much I miss that timing tower.¬†


It's very readable, the contrast between all the colours is a lot better and it's shorter because only the lap counter is shown and not the big unnecessary F1 race logo (if you're watching a race, you'll know it's an F1 race... You really don't need that logo to know that) at the top that is kind of wasted space, and the gaps between the positions are not as big leading to as timing tower that doesn't extend to the bottom of the screen and isn't unnecessarily big.¬†


Also some other points:


- When the current tyres are shown, the tyre compounds symbols are so much more readable with the red/yellow/white ring around the letter that indicates the compound instead of that flimsy letter in the tyre colour we have now (where especially red does not nearly have enough contrast to the black background), the time gap is also shown to one decimal (for example 2.0) so you know the rough timing gaps AND the tyre compounds at the same time. (Also no CGI tyre compounds at the begin of the race, looks much better)¬†


- The numbers indicating the drivers' position have a white background which makes them much easier to read.¬†


- The timing background is a bit transparent so you can see some stuff that's happening when something is behind the tower.¬†


- Yellow flags actually display the sector where the yellow is shown... Why would you not show that in this year's version? Why would you only show that there's a yellow somewhere on track but not where?¬†


- The \^‚ñºindicating how many places¬† a driver has lost/gained relative to their starting position is much more readable. The ones whe have now are way to thin and the red doesn't have enough contrast in comparison to the black background, leading to bad readability.¬†


- I feel the font for the timing gaps is a tad bolder/thicker which definitely helps readability.¬†


- The inly thing I'd probably keep from the current tower might be the team logos instead of team colour stripes.


What else I'd change about the current timing tower:


- When showing battles for x position (for example battle for third) - the timing gap in the tower dissappears. So you don't know how big the gap is when two cars are fighting, even though it's pretty much the most important thing imaginable to know the gaps at that moment. So¬† it would be nice if these could be displayed again (I have seen some inserts at the bottom of the screen that do show the gaps, but they aren't always there and I'd still like them to be displayed on the actual tower, so I can keep an eye on the rest of the gaps more easily).¬†


- In qualifying, instead of showing IN LAP and OUT LAP in the space where the lap times should be, show a little symbol with I or O next to the timing gaps similarly to the P that is shown to indicate someone in their pit box.¬†


- Show us +5/+10 next to the driver's name when they get a penalty they haven't served yet. I really thought we had that in recent years, but I can't find it anywhere so maybe I'm imagining things.¬†

1kmfd97,Lewis Hamilton comment on Max Verstappen‚Äôs driving style in interview for Netflix‚Äôs Drive to Survive Season 4 ‚ÄúGloves Are Off‚Äù bears striking similarities to Lando Norris‚Äô comment after Miami GP 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmfd97/lewis_hamilton_comment_on_max_verstappens_driving/,2025-05-14, Discussion,"I only post this because as I‚Äôm rewatching DTS on Netflix, Lewis‚Äô comment about his huge crash with Max, that came close to killing Lewis if not for the halo, reminded me so much of what Lando said recently about Max during the debacle at the first/second turn of the Miami Grand Prix two weeks ago.

Lewis says, ‚ÄúMax is kind of do or die. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre either crashing or you‚Äôre‚Ä¶or you‚Äôre not going by.‚Äù Lando says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crash or don‚Äôt pass with Max,‚Äù and of course so many people gave him shit especially when Oscar managed to ‚Äúeasily‚Äù pass Max later on in the race to then go on to win.

It‚Äôs no secret that race control and the stewards let Max get away with a lot of shit that I would argue played a large part in why he brought home his first championship in 2021 and why he continued to dominate in the years following, but if a 7 time F1 Drivers Champion, whose more than proven himself in this sport, shares a very similar sentiment about Max and his not only aggressive but dangerous race craft, why did so many people give Lando so much shit? And continue to give him shit even going on to discuss things like he‚Äôs not mentally fit to be champion, no longer #1, etc etc. 

I‚Äôm incredibly confused by the phenomena. I suppose it can simply boil down to people simply hate on Lando because he‚Äôs Lando, but I found that specifically the reaction to that statement to be the most bizarre? Especially considering Max‚Äôs dangerous driving style is nothing new and is in fact why so many of his fans love him. Was the comment that ridiculous? And correct me if I‚Äôm wrong didn‚Äôt it take Oscar more laps to pass Max than it took for Lando to pass him?

Just good and aggressive driving, I\'m sure?', "">I suppose it can simply boil down to people simply hate on Lando because he‚Äôs Lando\n\nNobody dislikes a driver because they are <Driver>\n\nMax's style is aggressive, but he will also drive to the absolute limits of the interpretations of the law, and will selectively encroach over the line if it is beneficial for him to do so.  Max hasn't done a lot of pure racing in the last 4 years because the RBR has been so dominant but in races where, say the Ferrari was competitive, he'd race LEC incredibly hard and fair.  Similarly, racing Piastri, he defended hard, but also fair and not in a dangerous way.  It took a few laps for Piastri to set him up but both were complimentary of each other after the race.\n\nNorris saying that VER ruined his own race and should be worried about the championship while he himself is being outclassed by his teammate with 80+ less races worth of experience is what is causing people to not like Norris."", 'Did you watch 22 and 23 or are you just making stuff up?

You have to make a decisive move, then all is fine. Its just drivers that have a tendency of the former get in trouble with Verstappen.
