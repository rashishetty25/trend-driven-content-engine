Williams car was superior in every way to Senna's McLaren and Williams  locked out the front row in a year they dominated with one of F1's greatest car. Prost and Hill were 1.5 seconds clear in qualifying.  

This race saw a number of incidents. A giant airborne crash involving Mario Andretti took out four at the start.

Senna was given a stop-go penalty for lapping a backmarker under yellow flags. 

Then there was a heavy rain shower and leader Prost spun at turn 1 and hit Fittipaldi's stationary car and both were out of the race. 

Hill took over the lead from Senna who had recovered after his penalty and benefited from Schumachers car talkimg off the jack during his pit stop. 

On lap 42 Senna passed Hill for the lead and built up a 16 second gap and won his home race for the second and final time. 

After the race the Brazilian fans invaded the track in celebration of Senna's victory. 

Fangio celebrated with Senna on the podium, the last time they were seen together in public. Even Pelé joined in the celebrations after.
