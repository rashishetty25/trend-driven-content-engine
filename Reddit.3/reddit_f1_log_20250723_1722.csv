Nobody expected it to come so soon with Rosberg retiring, but it was an obvious move.', 'It was a bit of a no brainer given the timing. It was really clear that Bottas was fast, he was performing well in the williams at a time when williams were performing ok. They needed a driver fast, there was already the strong relationship between Merc and williams, who else would they go for?', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/5oauej/valtteri_bottas_confirmed_to_drive_for_mercedes/\n\nReddit thread from when this was announced.', ""So Rosberg's exit was a massive shock to everyone including Mercedes\n\nThey had no backup plan\n\nPretty much everyone at that point was tied down, locked in a contract. Though Toto said pretty much every F1 driver bar 2 phoned him about the seat (Kimi Raikkonen & Danil Kyvat).\n\nThere was some memes and jokes from Max and Mercedes twitter account about Max replacing Nico. But obviously this was not that serious, Max was not leaving Red Bull and Red Bull would not let Max break his contract anyway, and some people were hopeful Alonso would get the seat, but again in a contract (and also spygate).\n\nThe only feasible option was Pascal Werhlein the Mercedes junior driver who was in Manor. Manor was a Mercedes customer team and Mercedes got to choose one of the drivers for a manor seat as part of the deal.\n\nThe problem with Pascal is he was a rookie in 2016 and only had 1 years experience. So Mercedes were concerned he did not have enough experience, so they were also exploring the option of paying Williams to release Bottas from his contract. Bottas was chosen as an alternate option because Williams were a team that financially would probably accept a monetary offer to break a driver contract (Ferrari and Red Bull wouldn't) and Bottas was seen as a good driver, future top team material.\n\nBottas was THE BEST driver Mercedes had a reasonable chance of breaking the contract on\n\nHowever it was obviously still a very expensive option, because you have to pay Williams as well as Bottas.\n\nWhen it became clear these were the 2 options Mercedes were exploring. People were very much hoping Mercedes would go for Bottas, fearing Werhlein would mean a boring F1 Season with Hamilton having no challenge, But people were skeptical Mercedes would spend the money to break Bottas contract\n\nWhen they did go for Bottas i think some people were pleasantly surprised, and very happy about it. Despite dominating Mercedes had garnered a lot of good faith (particularly after Bahrain 2014) from the fans for allowing their 2 drivers to race and allowing 2 strong drivers . The decision to go for Bottas was seen as more of this policy of going for 2 strong drivers."", ""I remember my first thought being that it made sense, though I've often wondered what Wherlein would have done.\n\nThe funniest part of it though was Massa unretiring, especially after his big emotional farewell in Brazil."", 'I thought he was a good choice.

That's super rad tho.\n\nThe more women that watch, the more succes f1 academy has, then the more little girls growing up right now and future generations will want to start karting. Hopefully one day we'll have a fast lady driver in the ranks. \n\nIf 100,000 boys worldwide begin karting every year, the odds any of them will be fast is very small. Let's say only a few hundred progress into the junior leagues, fewer will be fast enough to keep going. \nSo if only 500 girls worldwide start karting,  the odds that any of them will be fast is slim to none. \nBut this is encouraging; the more little girls start trying out karting, the better the odds there will be that one of them will be fast!
