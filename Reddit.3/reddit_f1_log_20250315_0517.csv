On the first day of practice for the Australian GP, all 20 Formula 1 cars were equipped with two additional cameras, which were aimed directly at the front wing and rear wing from both sides. A detailed deployment plan determined which camera was filming which driver in which practice session.\n\n> The 50 gram cameras recorded continuously. This meant that a Formula 1 driver could be at the front right and rear left in the first practice session and vice versa for his team-mate. And the other way round in the second session.\n\n> The world governing body began to keep a closer eye on the teams last year. Word had got around that some cars were equipped with front wings that bent under increasing load in order to shift the aero balance from the front to the rear. Of course, they all passed the static load tests.\n\n>Special high-resolution cameras. \nAt the Belgian GP, the FIA began filming the front wings in order to obtain more information about the degree of bending. The test was continued until the 2024 season finale and ultimately led to a tightening of the static tests from the Spanish GP onwards.\n\n> At the Azerbaijan GP last year, it then emerged that the teams were also playing tricks with the rear wings. McLaren bent the flap upwards on the outside, Ferrari pushed the main blade further down on the inside when the DRS was not activated. The aim of both was to increase the gap between the main blade and the flap. This reduces drag and increases top speed. In technical jargon, the practice is called “mini-DRS”.\n\n> This has now led to the FIA also monitoring the rear wings on video during all Friday practice sessions in Melbourne. However, the referees are not satisfied with the images from the normal TV cameras. The association’s special cameras have three times the resolution of the TV images.\n\n> No disqualifications in Melbourne. According to Article 3.15.17 of the Technical Regulations, the gap between the wing elements may not increase by more than two millimetres if a force of 750 newtons is applied to the left and right of the wing when stationary.\n\n> If the video recordings show that the gap widens by more than the permitted two millimetres when driving, the FIA can slap the Formula 1 team concerned on the wrist and ask them to rectify the situation. However, disqualification is not possible.\n\n> It is rumoured from association circles that the rules could be tightened in the short term if there are too many violations in the rear as well as the front wing.

1jb5px4,[AMuS] Can Ferrari annoy the McLaren?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jb5px4/amus_can_ferrari_annoy_the_mclaren/,2025-03-14, News,,"['Full translation: \n\n> The McLaren were at the top of everyone’s tip sheets. If only because of their legendary long runs. On one lap, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris finished second and third, a good tenth of a second behind the day’s winner Charles Leclerc. Many experts believe that McLaren is just bluffing. Ferrari team boss Frédéric Vasseur is not just clinging to Charles Leclerc’s best time. “We weren’t far away from McLaren in the long run either.”\n\n> The top speeds were also equal. They were only 0.5 km/h apart. Leclerc was a few hundredths of a second faster than Norris in all three sectors. The race simulations went to the Papaya cars with a slight advantage. Norris was the fastest with an average of 1m 21.903s over eleven laps on medium tyres.\n\n> Leclerc covered three more laps and averaged 1m 22.140s. However, he turned up the power on the last two laps. The picture is similar for his team-mates. Piastri completed eleven laps with an average time of 1m 22.110s. Hamilton averaged 1m 22.228s over 13 laps.\n\n> Where does Mercedes stand? \nMercedes team boss Toto Wolff assesses the situation as follows: “McLaren is at the front. Then everyone else is in line.” The Austrian may have to make a correction when it comes to Ferrari. Even after the first day of practice, it is difficult to judge how strong the Silver Arrows themselves are. Mercedes bucked the trend with hard tyres in the long run.\n\n> The engineers were surprised that everyone else opted for medium tyres. They are not worried about this. Continuous rain is forecast for Sunday. “We’ll only need rain tyres or intermediates anyway.”\n\n> George Russell equalled Norris’ long run best time by just a few hundredths on the hard rubber. Andrea Kimi Antonelli put in a decent performance for his first endurance run under real-life conditions. On his fastest lap, the 18-year-old Italian was still four tenths behind his team-mate.\n\n> Explanation: “It was the first time I had driven with C5 tyres. I didn’t get them into the window perfectly.” In general, the Mercedes drivers struggled with Pirelli’s softest compound. “We didn’t gain as much time as we should have. This was possibly due to the asphalt temperatures of over 40 degrees,” analysed Russell.\n\n> Another explanation is that both Mercedes drivers were too aggressive on their fast laps and then paid for it in the final sector with rear tyres that were too hot. A modest engine mode cost an additional 0.35 seconds over the competition on the straights.\n\n> Should Verstappen be worried? \nThe Formula 1 world champion was quite satisfied with the first practice session. He was four tenths behind Lando Norris in fifth place, although he was held up by Carlos Sainz on his lap. The Dutchman did not have a clean lap in afternoon practice either. After a mistake in turn 3, he abandoned the attempt. He later laboured his way up to seventh place. The gap to the leader was 0.624 seconds.\n\n> The champion then spent 13 minutes in the pits before tackling his long run on medium tyres, which turned into a short run with nine minutes remaining. The set-up was changed during the break. Different front wings were also used. “We made the car worse compared to the first practice session,” lamented Head of Sport Helmut Marko.\n\n> The instability in some corners returned. According to their own calculations, McLaren is ahead by three tenths. Ferrari and Verstappen follow. One indication that the Red Bull RB21 still has its moods is the large gap of Liam Lawson. The New Zealander lost six tenths on one lap and 1.2 seconds on the long run to his team captain. “That should be a little less,” hoped Marko.\n\n> How good are Toro Rosso and Williams?\nIn the opening session, Williams continued its show from the test drives with first and sixth places for Carlos Sainz and Alexander Albon. Team Principal James Vowles warned: “We are significantly better than last year, but not as good as it looks.” In the second session, Sainz and Albon finished eleventh and twelfth with exactly the same lap time, just outside the top 10.\n\n> The blue cars performed differently in the long run. Albon went out twice for five laps each and looked correspondingly good. Sainz finished seventh in the endurance runs. From a Williams driver’s perspective, five tenths of a second behind the McLaren is not a disaster.\n\n> While Williams surprised in the first session, Toro Rosso set the tone in the second. Yuki Tsunoda finished the session in fourth place, just 0.345 seconds behind the best time. Rookie Isack Hadjar also impressed. Sixth place despite a handicap.\n\n> The Frenchman already cut a fine figure in the morning. But the excellent times came at the price of less petrol and a higher power mode. Hadjar was supposed to practise in the qualifying trim. There was no time for this during the tests. Marko estimates: “Williams is ahead of us.”\n\n> Has Haas gambled away? \nThat was a real slap in the face for Haas. Oliver Bearman destroyed his car in a high-speed accident in the 220 km/h chicane in the first practice session. It was not ready for the second practice session. Esteban Ocon finished penultimate in both sessions. 1.6 seconds off the lead and three tenths off the rest.\n\n> The Frenchman complained about balance problems. The engineers were able to solve some of these between the two practice sessions. “But there’s still more to come,” demanded Ocon. The US Ferrari’s understeer cannot be completely eradicated. So far, no setup trick has helped. It will probably be up to the aerodynamicists.\n\n> Sauber showed an improvement compared to the test, which Nico Hülkenberg underlined with eighth place. The German’s race simulation was also impressive. With an average of 1:22.592 minutes, the Sauber driver was in the sandwich of the Toro Rosso drivers. Gabriel Bortoleto was sent out on the track with an alternative setup with significantly more downforce. It was a failure. Conclusion: The new parts are starting to work. The car has become much more consistent.\n\n> Are the cars or the track that fast? \nLast year’s time was beaten by 1.2 seconds in the first practice session and by eight tenths in the second. The reason for this lies in the track and the tarmac. The drivers reported that the track surface offered more grip from the start than before.\n\n> The many support races that put rubber on the track at Albert Park played a positive role here. The rest of the time is spent developing the cars. Sauber Technical Director James Key confirms: “These cars are real monsters. We’ve never seen so much downforce in Formula 1 as today.”', 'Based off of this report the pecking order at the top seems to be:\n\nMcLaren, Ferrari in a close 2nd, Max, Mercedes, Liam\n\nAfter that it feels like Williams, VCARB, Aston Martin, and even Sauber all have a shot at the tail end of the points. \n\nWith temperatures set to get even hotter tomorrow it will be interesting to see how much that affects the cars compared to today. Mercedes already struggled on the quali runs today because their tires got too hot, so it could be even worse tomorrow. But on the other hand if they fire up the tires quicker than the rest that could also help them on Sunday when it’s cold and rainy. So there is a lot that can still change.', 'Can McLaren annoy Ferrari?', ""Three tenths would be depressing.

Please [direct these to the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/formula1) instead.","[""I'm back with another update on the weather for Sunday!\n\nModels continuing to converge on an earlier solution for the passage of the front, with very heavy showers and thunderstorms in the late morning (some time between 0800 and 1200 local is most likely for rain onset, this time range will narrow as we get closer). Almost all models also agree in multiple rounds of lighter but still significant showers behind the front going through race time. Some of these models end these post-frontal rains right around 1500 local, and others keep it going into the evening, this will likely be the highest uncertainty going forward.\n\nI still think the biggest story, more than the rain, will be the extremely gusty winds and much cooler temperatures. It is nearly impossible to set up an F1 car to be fast in 40C temperatures and 15C temperatures simultaneously, not to mention the 50kph gusts possible during the race. Throw in a damp track or even light showers and you're talking about extremely challenging conditions to drive in.\n\nI suggest anyone reading this also scroll down and read u/Ryzi03's local insight into post-front showers as I believe it will be highly relevant for the race weather. Their comment provides a great look into what similar setups typically do in the area (something you can't get from me, who lives on the other side of the world)."", 'What storylines are people most looking forward to seeing this year?\n\nThe obvious one this year is the title fight. It feels like we have a good chance to see a new world champion which is great. For me it’s between Lando and Charles, but Piastri could be the dark horse. He’s ruthless enough. Obviously writing off Verstappen and Red Bull is daft.\n\nI’m also really looking forward to seeing how Carlos gets on at Williams. They look like they have a decent car and it would be great to see him do well.\n\nFinally, I’m interested in how Verstappen takes on the challenge of not having a dominant car, now that he doesn’t have a significant lead. He can’t afford to take the risks he was towards the end of last season and I think there’s an exciting storyline there', ""Guys. Last chance to fill out the Prediction for the 2025 season. I'll close it in +/- 10 hours.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/u0XPD6JNRu"", ""Melburnian who follows our weather pretty closely here, I’m glad we’re all getting to enjoy the wonders of the infamous Melbourne ‘4 seasons in 1 day’. You guys might be looking forward to rain for the chaos, I’m looking forward to the rain because it’s pretty much our first proper rain in multiple months. We've been slowly approaching [drought-like conditions over the last 12 months](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/maps/rainfall/?variable=rainfall&map=decile&period=12month&region=nat&year=2025&month=02&day=28) in this part of the country so any rain is good rain.\n\nThe weather in Melbourne is largely dictated by the direction of the wind, hot when the wind is coming from the deserts in the middle of the country to our north and cold when the wind is coming from the Southern Ocean and Antarctica to our south. Saturday is currently forecast to be 34°C as we get the hot northerly desert winds ahead of the approaching Antarctic cold front. The cold front is then forecast to hit by Sunday morning, swinging the winds around to the S/SW and dragging up a much cooler air mass from down near Antarctica with the temperature forecast to be 20°C and dropping for the start of the race.\xa0The winds are also likely to be reasonably gusty for the race with a fairly steep pressure gradient as the ridge of high pressure behind the front moves over the Great Australian Bight and pushes through into Melbourne.\n\nThere’ll be rain and possible storms as the front passes through but we also quite often get fairly heavy intermittent showers for a few hours after the front passes as the cold Antarctic air interacts with the warmer waters of Port Phillip Bay, so I would say at this point it's likely that we're going to have at least a partially wet race. The showers behind the front can be pretty intense with occasional small hail but it was also a similar cold front setup around this time last year that brought severe storms and caused power outages that affected 500,000 homes and businesses so anything is possible.\n\nSome interesting links to keep track of our weather:  \nOffical forecast for Melbourne - [http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml)  \nOffical rain radar for the Melbourne region - [http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR024.loop.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR024.loop.shtml) (Albert Park is directly between the dots for Melbourne and St Kilda)  \nLatest official observations for the Melbourne region - [http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/melbourne.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/melbourne.shtml) (Melbourne (Olympic Park) is the closest station to Albert Park for most observations but St Kilda Harbour RMYS is marginally closer for wind observations)\n\nIt's definitely a weekend filled with the notorious 'Melbourne' weather that we're known for at least!"", 'I am new to F1 as a fan and the sport in general - interest piqued when over Xmas I got a virtual reality race sim and put over 100+ hours in a few months.\n\nJust looking for a summation of anything I should know!

Sainz is striaight up to speed at Williams, Ocon and Hulkenberg are expected to be straight on it with their new teams.
