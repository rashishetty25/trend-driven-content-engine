Racing is rarely done in the rain anymore primarily due to extremely poor visibility, not because drivers can't control the cars. Modern tires and diffusers create a massive amount of spray, making it impossible for drivers to see other cars, even at close distances and high speeds. This lack of visibility significantly increases the risk of severe accidents. While drivers like Carlos Sainz enjoy the challenge of driving in the rain, the safety concerns related to visibility with multiple cars on the track are the main reason for the reduced frequency of rain races.

It seems crazy to me to invest into this year's car unless you're red bull trying to get verstappen a title(since the constructors is decided anyway), and we have teams still slapping on new parts and spending budget on parts that won't even get to see a whole season instead of preparing for a whole new set of regulations. 

Is the squeeze of one extra constructors worth it perhaps? Since it's a few millions difference between constructors points maybe it's just worth it to spend a million or two in trying to secure another placement no matter what (or many if you're sauber squeezing out a few extra positions)? Is it to appease drivers or sponsors to not make them feel 'abandoned' for the season? 

It just feels like every dollar spent on the new reg is exponentially more valuable than the current one to me, and I'd love to see some discussion on what could make this strategy actually seem reasonable and effective rather than desperate which is how I feel about most of these upgrades right now. ","['IN 2021 everybody was saying RBR would be massively underperforming with the new rule change in 2022, because they were pouring all their resources in 2021 to win WDC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe know how that went.', ""If you are RB, AM, Williams, Sauber, and Haas you really can't stop development right now.  Williams could just as easily finish P9 as P6 given how close everything is.  A million dollar investment in parts upgrades this season could pay out multiple times over if you can boost your WCC standings."", ""At this point I think a lot of the upgrades still coming are things they knew they needed from the start (wings made for certain types of tracks that aren't as represented in the early season as an example like most teams will have a monza wing) or things that carry over to next time that you are testing (ferrari's suspension upgrade). I don't think there are a lot of upgrades if any made purely to optimize performance this year that don't also fit one of the two categories I mentioned."", ""How do you know that every dollar spent on next year's regs will pay off?\n\n\nEvery team wants to do as well as they can every year. That means continues upgrades. Placing Ione point further up the WCC is worth tens of millions in prize money and helps you attract sponsorship and talent.\n\n\nHaving competitive cars means your engineering team thinks competitively, you don't want them to slack off for a year. Some goes for every other department and your drivers.\n\n\nThese cars are the end of years of development, you're bringing our parts that are they final version of an idea you've been working on for years, why throw away all that invested time and money?\n\n\nAnd as you said the data from upgrades this year helps with next year.\n\n\nThe new regs are a total unknown if you can grab say 5th place this year that's worth a lot more than 8th next year.\n\n\nFor McLaren this is there chance to grab both championships, it's literally impossible for them to do better next year. They'll obviously what to invest this year.\n\n\nThe nine other teams all have different reasons to keep pushing."", ""there's barely any development going on this season, most upgrades you're seeing are absolutely tiny changes, some of which probably have significant relevance to next season so they're just trying them out\n\nthe gaps between the teams are so incredibly small that even a small tweak to the fairing that leads to a suspension arm might bring you from q1 to q3 in some tracks, and if you can get data even tangentially relevant to 2026 from it, makes sense"", 'There‚Äôs money, prestige and drivers.\n\nFor a team like Williams or Haas the extra few millions from the constructors money is gonna make a huge difference.

1maj6o0,Some thoughts about the race watching experience as a new F1 viewer,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1maj6o0/some_thoughts_about_the_race_watching_experience/,2025-07-27, Discussion,"I recently started watching F1, and have been going through and watching all of this season's races to get caught up. 

I'm not sure how other people feel about this as seasoned viewers, but as a new viewer who doesn't know which driver/team I want to root for, it seems like the broadcast wants me to root for either McLaren, Redbull, or Ferrari. 

I understand these are the more popular teams, and their drivers are usually leading races, but the broadcast and camera seem to be split 90% those teams, 10% the other seven teams. 

There have been countless times that the broadcast focuses on someone like Piastri or Max cruising in 1st with no one behind them for 10 seconds, and in the meantime, there are 3 overtakes happening in the range of 12-20th place. 

I feel like they should be showcase the lower tier driver's more often, trying their best to capture all the overtakes and intense moments happening in that range, instead of only the top 5. That way, those drivers' skills and personalities get to be shown to more people. 

Additionally, it seems like the camera crew/operator often cuts to important moments right after they happen, causing the need for many replays throughout the match. This isn't detrimental, but is still very annoying, because I can see on the on-board cams that something is happening, but the camera crew doesn't show it. 

Just thought I would share my experience as a new F1 fan, would be interested to know if anyone else has had similar thoughts!","['I agree the midfield is very exciting this year and would love to see more of that action.', 'TV direction hasnt been great, thats definitely a common and shared complaint. They do focus on front runners, as you say even when nothing is going on and theres a real battle further back. Missing key moments by cutting away too soon or too late happens every race.\n\nAll that being said, its a mixed bag. We have had plenty of races over the last few years where the leader (often Max) is often invisible because he checked out ahead, so with no hope of action then the focus is elsewhere.\n\nIn short, there is lots of room for improvement, but TV direction will never be perfect, if for no other reason than different people want different things.

1mamzlo,Wet start proposal: Send cars off at intervals under VSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mamzlo/wet_start_proposal_send_cars_off_at_intervals/,2025-07-27, Discussion,"Since we keep seeing red flags for visibility while cars are bunched up behind the Safety Car, the obvious solution to me seems to be to use the VSC instead wherever possible. This is easy enough to implement during the race, but if everyone sets off from the grid at the same time it doesn't make any difference from starting under the Safety Car.

My proposal is to send the cars off at 3 or 4 second intervals (longer would be ideal, but the limit will be informed by the lap time under VSC divided by the number of cars, then reduced further to create a margin for error). I'm not sure what the exact procedure would look like, but as an example, the starting lights could alternate extinguishing two lights on each side to indicate the next car on each side can proceed.

Once underway, the cars can circulate to clear the standing water, with enough of a gap between them to avoid the worst of the spray. The current rules already allow for multiple formation laps, so there wouldn't need to be any change there. Once the decision is made to start the race, the Safety Car can be sent out for one lap to gather the field before either a standing or rolling start.","['F1 should use all the hot takes on Reddit to dry the track.', 'They already have trucks drying the track.', 'So basically have a track where every part is driven over by a car at a regular interval to help dry the track?

1ma0vh6,Why the disparity between the first and second cars?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ma0vh6/why_the_disparity_between_the_first_and_second/,2025-07-26, Discussion,Why do analysts always talk about the #2 car instead of the driver not being good enough. Example: Tsunoda vs Verstappen. Don‚Äôt they essentially have the same car at the beginning of the season? Does the team prioritize that much more budget towards Max‚Äôs car? Does the car change that much from its counterpart based on driver preferences?,"[""For Red Bull specifically, they had to run a difference in spec at a number of races this year due to accident damage limiting their parts supply. Today they decided to put an update on Tsunodas car that was meant to only be on Verstappen's car this weekend (likely at the expense of not really having spares for it), so that's a topic.\n\nThis sometimes happens to teams, mostly due to accidents or because updates are introduced as soon as there are enough parts to support one car.\n\nTeams don't develop two different cars, though"", ""Every driver sets up the car according to their preferences. Some cars are harder to set up in a way that makes them fast. Some cars are only able to go fast on really sensitive setups. In cases like red bull one driver can handle those extreme setups better than the other. And because Max was winning, they didn't try to change the car in a way that makes it fast even with a less extreme setup until it was too late. \n\nI feel like people don't really understand the difference between car and setup. The car is developed mainly by the engineers and not the drivers. The setup is to make the car more comfortable for the driver, so it's gonna change according to the driver. Alex Albon has said that the car is the same and it's just Max's setups that are extreme in the past."", ""\n>Does the team prioritize that much more budget towards Max‚Äôs car?\n\nGenerally the driver further up the standings will always get priority for upgrades where only 1, or limited sets are available. This does mean Verstappen will essentially always have priority for updates.\n\nIn addition to this Yuki crashed which damaged update parts, due to the limited number of spares he was reverted to the older spec so both drivers would have spares available if required until more spares of the new spec could be manufactured. \n\n>Does the car change that much from its counterpart based on driver preferences?\n\nIn terms of actual component spec this isn't super common but it can happen sometimes. Piastri has been running some older spec parts than Norris because he, and his side of the garage prefer them for example.\n\nDrivers will however often differ on their setup according to their preferences. This can have quite a significant effect on how the car handles. Verstappen likes a relatively pointy sharp car, which a lot of drivers can't deal with. Yuki has been dialing in a bit more understeer for stability. A setup like that is theoretically slower but if it gives the driver more confidence they can wind up being faster with it than they would be with a more oversteery setup."", 'Sometimes there are differences between the cars if they only have upgrades finished for one of the two, or if there are setup differences between the two.\xa0\n\nBut I think in the context you are asking about, by number two car they mean the second team as a whole, which includes the driver skill as part of that.\xa0', ""They're the same cars, but Yuki crashed and wrecked the car several times so he didn't always have the new parts."", ""The cars start out the same at the start of the season.
