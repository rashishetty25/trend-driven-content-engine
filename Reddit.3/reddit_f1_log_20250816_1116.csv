Super formula was racing here and the schedules lined up perfectly to make a day trip out of it from Tokyo.

But that recollection may have been tarnished by the reception to the revised layout. A lot of people bemoaned the loss of the long final corner and its replacement with the switchback, but that just would have been completely counter-productive to modern Formula 1 cars. There was no real understanding that Fuji was not redesigned purely for Formula 1 cars, either -- other series race there, too.\n\nI remember the redesign being compared to Hockenheim: a classic circuit being butchered by an ape with no understanding of what the fans wanted. It might be an unpopular opinion, but I think the original Hockenheim was overrated. It was great in the 1980s when engines were varied, but the modern regulations meant that it soon became pretty dull. The redesign kept the spirit of the original while improving overtaking opportunities and I do not think it deserves the criticism it gets. The same applies to Fuji. I know the switchback maybe is not terribly interesting, but I can see what Tilke was going for -- it is easy to get off-line when attacking or defending, and since that leads into a gargantuan straight, any mistake is really going to be felt going down to the first corner.
