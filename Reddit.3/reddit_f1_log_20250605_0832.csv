mistakes and victories and defeats are part and parcel of any sport, and just because of that doesnt mean we need to stick it up someones arse for winning, loosing, letting out a few rude words against competition in the heat of the moment. it's turning into the new ""IS THIS SUPERHERO STRONGER THAN THIS SUPERHERO"", because it's stopped becoming meaningful and started becoming pointless. sometimes stay respectful when you're talking about millionaires, even as stupid as that sounds, human decency isnt stupid. hope this post doesnt get downvoted and acts as a intervention for many passionate fans who do get unruly sometimes. we got to respect the sport and the people who make up the sport- lando, lance, lewis, max, fernando. they're all putting their time, effort, money and life into something we too enjoy, so lets try not to beat them down on it

if this reaches a wide enough audience, we may be able to hear less of atheletes like stroll behaving differently in media because of us- lando being emotional or apologising in the heat of moments because of us- drivers facing abelist and racist slurs because of us. we as a community have a large impact and we act together as one, so try to behave lads, its a sport, one that the drivers should enjoy as much as we do.","[""It's not just Formula one, it's in all sports.

It is often said that this is a norm for sports but I do believe that we, as the viewer, hold some responsibility in how we engage with the medium, the same way that the people involved with the sport, bearing equal responsibility to ensure it is accommodating as well. We all have our own roles to play, and like you said, it seems so out of sorts\n\nCelebrity culture is seeping into the sport. And I have my own qualms about celebrity culture, as a whole.

Arguably Red Bull have been like this for years and have discarded drivers left, right and centre with only a couple being able to come out unscathed. Alpine are at it and have essentially killed Doohan’s F1 career. Now they’re heaping pressure on Colapinto - I think he only has a 5 race contract. How the hell you can prove yourself in that short time with the limited testing they have these days is beyond me.', ""I think we're taking it a bit too seriously. Of course, these people are under pressure and exposed to hate, agitation and malice on social media, but they are also top athletes who have received PR training and have access to plenty of mental health resources.\n\nThis isn't to justify anything, but it's important not to confuse the riders with their public personas. They always play a role in front of the camera, and many things are said more deliberately on the radio on the track, for example, in the knowledge that the FIA and the media are listening in.\nIn this broken world, you need mental strength to deal with it — otherwise, you have to follow Vettel's example and avoid all social media, or leave it to an agency.""]",13,34,0.6,13,29,29,13,34,0.6,13
