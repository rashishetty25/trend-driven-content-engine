Just wanted to share some frustration and perhaps also a warning. We bought tickets for an F1 experience at Monza that included a pit walk, trophy photo and a track tour.... So the starter package 🤣

Anyway long story short when we did the pit walk all the cars were covered and garages were basically closed. So you pay a lot of money.... Well for me it's a lot and you end up with this.

Anyway maybe I was expecting too much. But if you are planning doing some similar maybe ask them what time you will do the pit walk and if it will be open.

The season was also tinged with tragedy: Antonio Ascari, winner at Spa, lost his life just a month later in Montlhéry. The 1925 World Championship was the first world championship title assigned in the history of motorsport, and it was the first of five World Championships for Alfa Romeo, since it would be followed by the 1950 and 1951 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship and by the 1975 and 1977 World Sportscar Championships. After the victory Alfa Romeo added a metal laurel wreath to the company's logo, which was used in various forms until 1982.","['Alfas...reliable?

The P2 was the best package during those years.', ""The only reason Alfa Romeo has a reputation for poor reliability is poor design, insufficient testing, poor build quality, poor QC, lack of rust protection and the electronics. If you can overlook those few small issues it's a great car."", ""Oh they did, I'm thinking about the scene in Rush where Lord Hesketh speaks about how the pioneers couldn't expect men would bring their invention to that level for sport.\n\n\nThat's the reason why I think it's important to be with those people as much and as well as one can, which is the basis of a true society."", 'Big shame that there was no Fiat or Mercedes after how competitive they were in 1924.

Fiat experienced a performance loss, culminated in the disaster of the French Grand Prix, and returned only in 1927 with the new 806.\xa0\n\n\nMercedes wasn't instead able to participate as Germany was not yet part of AIACR, they got included during 1925 so they could partecipate to the 1926 season, when they managed to win a couple of races.\n\n\nI've read a couple of explanations during the years about the reasons the San Sebastian Grand Prix wasn't included in the championship calendar. The main one is that Italy, as organiser of the championship (Arturo Mercanti, presidente of the Italian Club and founder of the Autodromo di Monza, was the one who dratfed the first regulations for the WMC), vetoed the inclusion of a grand prix in Spain in response to the ban received by Diatto and Alfieri Maserati the year prior during a hill climb race in Rabassada.\xa0""]",103,9,0.97,103,55,55,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0

I'm going into my second year of Mech Eng at the Uni of Birmingham very soon, and am excited that opportunities for 12-month placements with some of the teams will be opening soon. However, there seems to be an interesting range of experiences from what I've read of what people did to get their foot in the door with a Formula 1 team. 

I've heard from some people that you won't get anywhere without having designed a part of an F1 car in CAD, for example - this seems a bit daunting to me at the moment as we've only used Fusion so far to make a linear actuator and a stairlift, and those were group projects! It would be interesting to know if most people working in the industry went into job interviews having already completed very relevant projects on their own time. 

I also wonder about the idea that connections to the team or the sport are vital to securing internships and placements, as this seems to be a common belief. I understand that it stands you in good stead to have some experience with lower series or other racing environments, although these tend to have less placement style opportunities.

At this point, it believe people are overestimating the performance of the Mclaren, Oscar and Lando, and buy some extension Max, while also severely understating the performance of the Red Bull.

Starting with the Red Bull, many people are calling the car a tractor and that it is unbelievable that Max is getting poles and wins with it. While what Max is doing is incredible, the Red Bull is not a tractor. If it was, Max would not be getting poles and winning races, PERIOD. No driver on Earth is good enough to overcome a slow car. You can't create more pace than a car is capable of, it isn't possible. What you can do is get as close to 100% of a car's true pace as possible, which for the Red Bull, is close to the pace of the Mclaren, at least over 1 lap. Max is the best driver on the grid at extracting pace, especially with the Red Bull, probably the hardest car on the grid to extract 100% of the pace.

As for the Mclaren, people are severely overestimating its pace. I really think we have 2023 to blame for this and I believe it has caused people to be confused with a car being ""the Fastest"" and being ""THE FASTEST"". The 2023 Red Bull was ""THE FASTEST"" car on the grid. That car won 23/24 races that season. That car was untouchable and no other car was even in the same realm of pace. The 2025 Mclaren is ""the Fastest"" car. It is generally faster than the other cars on the grid, but the chasing cars are close enough in pace that they can still get wins and compete for poles during the season. This would be where the 2016-2020 Mercedes fall into. Dominant cars, but others could still win. 

As a side note, the 2024 Mclaren would be ""the fastest(*)"" car. Yeah, it might have been faster the most, but in the second half of that season, the ""fastest car"" changed every week. We had 4 different cars win a race that year. I would maybe even argue there was no fastest car in the second half of the season.

All that is to say, many people seem to be expecting performance of ""THE FASTEST"" car from the Mclarens when they only have ""the Fastest"" car. Don't get me wrong, Lando and Oscar have made mistakes this year, and Max is definitely the better driver, but the kind of performance people are expecting from them would require literal perfection because they don't have ""THE FASTEST"" car. It simply was never possible for the Mclarens to win virtually ever race this season, and anyone expecting them to do so was an foolish.","['Might have waffles for breakfast tomorrow', 'TODAY AT 4:13 I HAD ONE APPLE AND LISTENED TO PRIMAL SCREAM. THANK YOU.', "">\xa0As for the Mclaren, people are severely overestimating its pace.\xa0\n\n\n584 points plays 260 in WCC.\n\n\nIt's just luck that got them there really.\xa0\n\n\n12 wins vs 3 for the rest of the grid.\n\n\nAnd of 2 of those 'losses' they finished P2/P3.\n\n\nYou're right the red bull is truly the fastest car on the grid... Max is just having an 'off' season."", 'Ok', 'McLaren isn’t being overrated. The numbers show they are crushing the field despite not having the grid’s most complete driver. Piastri is leading the championship and Norris sits second, not because they are perfect, but because the car gives them a margin of error so wide that even mistakes don’t cost them titles. That’s what true dominance looks like.\n\nRed Bull’s position proves the opposite of your point. Verstappen is arguably the best driver in the sport and still can’t carry the RB21 anywhere close to McLaren’s consistency. Yes, he can put it on pole at tracks like Monza, but over a season the car bleeds points. If Red Bull were anywhere near McLaren’s level, Verstappen wouldn’t be staring at a triple-digit gap in the standings.', 'Ok', ""Red Bull is not a tractor, but it's slower than the Mclaren and there is no reason the Mclaren could not have had every single pole and every single race win so far."", 'Ok mate', 'This guy is onto something, how many capital letters are we putting in ""the fastest"" after all that?']",0,50,0.14,0,48,48,0,32,-0.03,0
