Like seeing mince pies and chocolate Santas in a supermarket in July', ""Translation \n\n\nThe eve of the Bahrain GP was lively at Ferrari due to the considerations drawn from Charles Leclerc 's statements in Japan. The Monegasque immediately wanted to clarify the matter, denying any possible crisis with the team with which he has now competed for seven seasons and then focusing on the themes of the weekend on the Sakhir circuit , where Ferrari brings the first important updates of the season.\n\n\nLeclerc: ‚ÄúThere are no negative things with the team‚Äù\n\n\nIn the days following the Japanese GP, many rumors circulated regarding Leclerc's statements , in which he repeatedly reiterated that he had found a direction in which to move to best manage the SF-25. Some saw this as a fracture within Ferrari, with the Monegasque intent on taking a different path than Lewis Hamilton, who would have been listened to more by the team.\n\nIn Bahrain, Leclerc clarified that none of this is true: ‚Äú I didn‚Äôt really understand where these rumours came from . What I said, and I repeat it now, is that there are no negative things in it. There is a direction that I found very interesting to go and work in, but it is done every year and I want to push in that direction. There is nothing of what I have seen written , that we are both going in very different directions or that the team was going in a different direction, none of that. Obviously we are all here to try to maximise the potential of the car and if I feel more comfortable putting the car in a different place, then it is positive for everyone .‚Äù\n\n\nProgress expected in Bahrain, not miracles\n\n\nFerrari arrives in Sakhir with some new features on the SF-25 that are highly hoped to help them turn around a disappointing start to the season. Leclerc believes that performance can benefit from this: ‚Äú We have some new features coming on the car, which I hope will help us close the gap a little bit . Will they be enough to close the gap completely? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a lot in what we‚Äôre bringing here, but I hope it helps us at least get closer. It‚Äôs still a significant step forward .‚Äù\n\n\nLeclerc confirmed that the gap to recover on McLaren is 3 tenths, a gap he hopes to close completely when the next updates arrive: ‚Äú In Suzuka, the gap that was between us and McLaren was 3 tenths . We have to work hard to recover it, so that's what we're doing and I'm confident that we can close it. I hope that in the short term we will have other things that will help us to be closer .‚Äù"", 'These are such non articles... ricciardo would not be fired, until he was, Lewis would not go to Ferrari, and there were no talks, until he did, there were no internal problems within red bull, until newey left.

Japan has been deemed boring, yet it's quite surprising that more races aren't like this.

There were other issues such as on a damp drying track going off line made it even harder to pass.

If you want to spice things up, there's reverse grids, which is silly, qualifying 1st come last in Monacco. Or drivers trying to get the lowest qualifying time but within the 107%. So that's out.

Randomised grid order, everyone will start in 1 position once. Requires the same number of cars as there are races. Plus starting last is more of a hinderence at some tracks than others.
And its a literal lottery.

So here's my idea. 3 rounds of qualifying you must use soft, medium, and hard compounds. But once you use one in a round you can only use that tyre, unless it rains.

Teams at the back could start on soft and try to get to Q2 but will then have a disadvantage in the later rounds. It adds an aspect of strategy in to play, which will mix up the grids, but is still based on performance and team strategy.

Either it's fine as it is, or there needs to be a shake up.
