But then the Dutchman put his Red Bull on pole position with a dream lap. There are four reasons why this miracle happened.\n\n> The radio call on the out lap spoke volumes. Max Verstappen loudly shouted his joy at his 41st pole position in Formula 1, his first since the 2024 Austrian GP, \u200b\u200binto the airwaves. Normally, the Dutchman is relatively relaxed on the radio. He\'s achieved so many victories and set so many fastest times in his career that one more or less doesn\'t elicit much emotion from him. But this time, everything was different.\n\n> The Formula 1 World Champion expected fourth place on the grid at best. His Red Bull struggled to find its form for three practice sessions, despite the engineers\' thorough redesign of the car. The Red Bull RB21 fluctuated between decent and undriveable. Verstappen complained that he never knew what the car would do in the next corner. In the third practice session, he was still half a second behind the McLaren.\n\n> Only the final intervention was successful. ""We completely overhauled our car,"" reported team principal Christian Horner. ""Everything was put to the test: the weight distribution, the downforce level, the damper, spring, and anti-roll bar settings, and the tire pressures.""\n\n> **Red Bull hit the window.**\nThe trump card played in crisis mode worked. Starting in Q1, the drivers sensed that the Red Bull was suddenly a good racing car again. ""The differences are minimal. If you fall out of the window by just a millimeter, you\'re immediately nowhere,"" Horner marveled. Verstappen praised: ""The car was difficult to drive for a long time, but we improved it step by step and worked our way towards a good setup.""\n\n> But then you\'ll still need Max Verstappen in the cockpit to convert the improved handling into the fastest qualifying time. ""I was at the limit everywhere, even a little over here and there,"" reported the defending champion. Not only that, Verstappen completed two clean laps in Q3. Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri, and George Russell all lost time in the first sector.\n\n> Piastri and Russell were blown away by the wind in Turn 2. On Saturday (April 5), the wind blew from the opposite direction to Friday. A tailwind made the notorious S-curves even more challenging than usual. Piastri\'s manager, Mark Webber, lamented: ""With any other Sector 1 time in his qualifying laps, Oscar would have taken pole position. But there\'s no reward for ideal times."" Horner applauded his driver: ""That was perhaps the lap of his life.""\n\n> **Verstappen\'s Fear Curve was Degner 2.**\nRed Bull responded correctly to the changed conditions. They opted for a touch more downforce to give the drivers more confidence through the S-bends. This also helped bring the tires into their temperature window for the beginning of the lap. But Verstappen\'s problem area wasn\'t the S-bends, but Degner 2.\n\n> Verstappen had lost two-tenths to the McLarens on every lap there, Horner revealed. Except for the decisive attempt. He was suddenly just as fast because he kept his tires in the window during the first section of the track to ensure optimal grip in his fear corner. The showdown in the duel with the McLarens was thus moved to the chicane before the start and finish. And there, the Red Bull driver took 66 thousandths off Norris.\n\n> According to Verstappen, pole position was the easier part of the task. Up until now, the McLarens had primarily demonstrated their strength in the race. However, there is a small glimmer of hope. The McLaren drivers were the only ones experiencing grainy front tires during the long runs in third practice. Norris more so than Piastri. An expert from the rivals commented: ""This suggests that they want to keep their rear tires as close to the temperature window as possible.""\n\n> Nevertheless, Verstappen prefers to play the pessimist for the race. He sees McLaren as the favorite. If it weren\'t for the weather. Rain is forecast for parts of Sunday.

Although Villeneueve seems like he's a little stuck in the days he used to race in F1, I find his takes very insightful race craft wise (wdc afterall...), more than Crofty at least. And his opinion refreshing. I may not agree with him on some but it's refreshing to see a clash of opinions.

One instance during the last few laps: Crofty was like ""what are mclaren doing, let piastry pass lando to challenge max so we can finally have some racing"" and Villeneueve was like ""yeahh.... no he shouldn't, I wouldn't have lol. Every point counts individually, its champion mentality""

This is unexpected after his strong showing in testing and even up until FP3 in Australia. Going into the season most fans thought that Sainz, coming off potentially his strongest season at Ferrari, would beat an Alex Albon who had had a few high profile crashes in 2024 and been evenly matched with young Franco Colapinto.

However Sainz has scored just one point to Albon's 18 in the first three races of 2025. Today he had to let Albon, who was a pit stop ahead of him, overtake him.

So do you think these are just teething issues as he gets used to a Williams car that is quite different to the Ferrari car he's used to the Williams or is Albon faster than we thought?

And what does this say about Colapinto who jumped in the Williams last year and outqualified Albon as early as his second outing and outraced him by his third? And in his fourth race he was much faster than Albon. Is Colapinto even better than people thought or is Albon driving at a higher level this season?

And finally this situation is reminding me of Ricciardo at McLaren. Goes into new team and his new team mate is surprisingly faster than him. By the end of 2021 Ricciardo was driving as well or perhaps better than Norris but he struggled to adapt to new regs the following year and was destroyed.

There are also similar noises coming from Sainz as there was for Ricciardo. He's not really sure why he's slower. That is very worrying to hear from a racing driver because it can lead them to thinking that they might just not have what it takes anymore.

So what do you all think? Is this a blip from Sainz that he will soon emerge from or is Albon just quicker than the majority expected him to be? And does this tell us that Colapinto is faster than we thought?","['It shows Albon is a really good driver and that Colapinto had the potential to be a really good driver. I expect Sainz will close the gap as the season goes on but he won‚Äôt be destroying Albon even at his best.\n\nPeople talked about Albon only doing well against weak teammates like Latifi and Sargeant, but what I find interesting is that he beat Latifi by greater margins than Russell managed.

He's not the quickest at adapting to new cars.   \n4) Colapinto was fast on the tracks he raced on, we've only had 3 races thus far. We don't how Sainz will perform on his stronger tracks.   \n5) Sainz is really fast once he gets up to speed with a car but he does take a while to get comfortable. He also doesn't push it to the limit the way Charles and Albon do so maybe this Williams like the Red Bull needs to always be on the knife's edge to perform and that will only come once he's more comfortable in it."", 'Let‚Äôs have this discussion towards the end of the session.

1js2uzg,What is the expectation for McLaren this year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1js2uzg/what_is_the_expectation_for_mclaren_this_year/,2025-04-05, Discussion,"I‚Äôm not talking about WDC or WCC. Obviously, those are the goals they should achieve. They obviously do have the best car. But my question is how dominant do you all think they should be?

It seems that any failed pole or win in the eyes of many, is a failure or ‚Äúbottle‚Äù in the eyes of many who watch this season, so my question is, should they achieve EVERY POLE position and EVERY WIN this year? 

In my opinion the car isn‚Äôt at that level of dominance, like an MP4/4 or Schumacher 04 challenger. Not even close, but I‚Äôd like to hear other‚Äôs thoughts.
","['They have the best car in qualifying and race pace. In qualifying is it very close though so a small mistake can cost them as well saw today. Races should be won by them barring some freak events', 'I think what Red Bull did in 2023 has created an unrealistic view of what having the fastest car actually means. There is a difference between having the fastest car and being absolutely dominant like the rb19 and max were in 2023. It was a generational talent in an extraordinary car.', ""I don't expect them to win every race. I think they have two very good drivers, but they don't have drivers that can get the car to dominate like Max/Lewis would. I think, as it stands now, they should win around 60% of the races. I just think Merc/Ferrari/Red Bull will snatch races because of mistakes by Norris/Piastri/McLaren"", ""To be honest I think Mclaren need to be aiming for more wins than pole positions I would never be surprised if another team snatches pole from them considering that Verstappen 'only' got 12 pole positions out of 23 races in 2023 yet still dominated the races the Mclaren car is undisputedly the best over a race distance I think we can definitely say that, however the only times the car genuinely looked 'unbeatable' was in my opinion those small patches of wet to dry during Australia but the thing is Mclaren showed they had this ability last year if you remembered Canada or Britian that car unlocks something in those conditions, ultimately my point is I don't consider every failed pole a 'bottle' I think that's ridiculous all that should matter is that Mclaren should be able to maximize the amazing race car they have on Sunday."", 'IMO they chose a setup that was not optimized for quali pace but for race pace and had the belief in their car to still secure the front row, rightfully so. That lap from Max was just an unexpected event.', 'I think we could have a similar situation to 2010 when Red Bull had definitely the fastest car but the drivers and the team weren‚Äôt driving at the same level as Alonso and Hamilton in the cars behind.\xa0\n\nThis year Piastri and Norris play the roles of Vettel and Webber. Verstappen and Russell play the roles of Alonso amd Hamilton.', 'Warning for long-winded rambling, but: I think people are needlessly harsh on the McLaren drivers because we‚Äôve gotten used to watching Max and Lewis and Seb.\n\nIs that car outright faster than any other team? Yes. If every car was driven by the exact same driver, should that car be the one that wins? Yes. Would it be fair to expect Lando / Oscar to win literally every race? No. Not at all. Think of all the variables at play, even beyond what can occur in a single race: you‚Äôve got two of the best drivers to ever drive in this sport in the top 8 right now and one of them is in his prime, there are also a bunch of very talented non-WDC drivers who are always ready to capitalise, the field is close compared to previous seasons, the whole drama with the front wings will happen, and teams will always bring upgrades‚Ä¶ \n\nConsidering all of that, I‚Äôll be mega impressed if either Lando or Oscar get more than 6 wins this season. After all, aside from Rosberg, who was in the dominant Mercedes, all the champions from the last 20 years that aren‚Äôt named Michael, Sebastian, Lewis or Max, have won with a maximum of 7 wins for the whole season. No one looks at those drivers and calls them washed or acts like they bottled because they didn‚Äôt win every other race. We‚Äôre just so used to this frankly insane dominance from the recent WDCs that we are somehow acting like it‚Äôs to be expected. It‚Äôs not. It doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt expect that car to win - it‚Äôs clearly very fast, so it should if everything goes right. But that doesn‚Äôt make it *easy* to go out there and pull off a 2023/2020/2013/2004 level season. Those drivers and teams were operating at elite levels in those years and to act like that‚Äôs just ‚Äúto be expected‚Äù is frankly doing those seasons a disservice.', 'They have the best car so the constructors championship should be the minimum target. I don‚Äôt expect them to win every race (especially with other teams finding upgrades throughout the season) but I expect them to win more races than every other team. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt class today as a bottlejob - Max just pulled out an absolute worldie of a lap.', ""The conclusions people are coming to in this thread is astonishing.

They‚Äôve both been saying that the rear end frequently steps out.l and that‚Äôs been clear to see. Stella has also confirmed that the car characteristics are causing an issue for both drivers but especially  Norris who is having to adapt to the fact that the characteristics (and in particular the way they have to set the car up to extract the performance) clash directly with the way he naturally extracts speed from a car. For some reason people are just absolutely refusing to hear what is being said by both the drivers and Stella and are acting like it‚Äôs a rocket ship on permanent rails, a second ahead of the field. \n\nThe only top car that seems particularly stable over one lap is the Merc, which has also been clear since pre-season testing. It‚Äôs not quite as fast as the McLaren, and very likely not the Red Bull and Ferrari either if those teams manage to hook things up fully, but that stability is allowing Russell in particular to extract the limit of performance on a more consistent basis (though even he had issues with the tyre prep in Q3 today)', 'More mistakes then typically characteristic for them?
