This could be the last chance for a long time for both of them. They should treat it as such. Ask Alonso.\xa0"", 'American football quarterback Dan Marino always assumed there would be another chance to win another Super Bowl. There never was.', ""People really want them to turn into Hamilton/Rosberg.   I don't see it."", ""everything he is saying sounds good.  but they're both young.  hopefully they both can keep that mentality throughout the season.  especially towards the end if it is still close and pressure is mounting."", '“I think, going into the year, we knew that it’s impossible to have your own personal goal directly in parallel with the team’s,” Piastri told media, including PlanetF1.com, in Barcelona.\n“And that’s something we’ve both been very frank about, something that the team has been very aware of.\n\n“Because, at the end of last year, we felt that if we went into this year with a car as strong as we finished with, we’d be in this situation. I think we’ve been very good at being open about it, just talking about it.”\nWhile he and Norris are aiming for a maiden title win this season, McLaren’s current level is such that the Australian reckons several more title fights are on the horizon – meaning maintaining harmony between the pair is a top priority.\n“We’re never going to do anything that’s unsportsmanlike or puts the team in a bad light or puts ourselves in a bad light. I think that’s just not who Lando and I are,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we want to go out and beat each other every weekend, but we’re never going to cross that line that’s going to cause damage that can’t be repaired. Because, I’ve said it a few times now, we don’t want just one opportunity at this.\n\n“We’re both at McLaren for a very long time after this year, and we want to fight for the championship every single year. I think we both understand it’s pretty unwise to try and win one championship and bring the house down with it.”\n\nIt’s a unique situation, as Piastri acknowledged. It’s not so long ago since Mercedes encountered fallout between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg as the former childhood friends fell out in similar circumstances, and the Australian praised McLaren for its hands-off handling of things.\n\n“I don’t think every team would handle it as we are, no,” he said.\n\n“At the same time, there are not many teams in our situation with a car and drivers that are strong enough… we’ve got a very good lead in the Constructors’ Championship at the moment and, whilst we’re continuing to build that gap, I think it’s the right thing to do to let us both try and fight for a championship.”\n\nThere will come a point where he believes the team should start imposing team orders as it closes in on the titles – but only if one of the pair develops a big enough lead to warrant some level of support.\n\n“I think, once it’s mathematically impossible, probably,” he said.\n\n“But no, I think we both want to win or try and fight for this championship and score our own points.\n\n“Of course, if there becomes a time, later in the year, where it is genuinely impossible – or very close to it – then, then, yes, maybe that will change, but I don’t see that happening for a very long time.”\n\nHaving had a run of momentum that saw him take wins in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, Piastri was beaten by Norris at Imola and Monaco, and said he suspects this pattern of momentum switching will continue through the year.\n\n“It’s going to ebb and flow a bit through the whole year,” he said.\n\n“But, I mean, I’m confident we’ve analysed what went a little bit wrong in Monaco.\n\n“I mean, it still wasn’t a terrible weekend, but just not as good as some of the weekends have been this year for me. So we’ve looked at what we can do a bit better, and we’ll try and put that in action.”\n\n___________________________________________\n\nPiastri’s comfort with the dynamic at McLaren will be welcomed by Zak Brown, who outlined his position on his driver’s assured equality during an exclusive interview with PlanetF1.com.\n\n“For us, it’s quite an easy thing to work through,” Brown explained.\n\n“Our drivers aren’t asking for favouritism, they’re asking for fairness, and that’s what they get.\n\n“I think they’re very comfortable; may the best man win.\n\n“Hopefully we give them a car in an environment where you’re going into the last race and it’s the two of them competing, and they didn’t take points off each other to the point where it lets Max [Verstappen] or someone else get in there.\n\n“But if so, then whoever wins the Drivers’ Championship has done a better job.”\n\nsacrifice [Yuki] Tsunoda’s qualifying because he’s giving Max a tow or whatever.“I get compromising the second car at Red Bull because it’s not competing for the Drivers’ Championship, so it’s an easy decision to make.\n\n“But when you’ve got two drivers first and second in the championship and are separated by less than one second place finish, how do you possibly even consider standing one down into a supporting role?\n\n“There’s just no way we will.”', 'Why do people get upset with this?

The better you perform, the better the basic setup.\n\n2. the setup work together with an engineer in the training sessions must be much more intensive. For example, the engineer could say that the car has too much understeer according to the data and recommend X or Y. Or you are too slow on the straights compared to your team-mate and he recommends reducing downforce. So the work on the setup could be so intensive without you having to make any adjustments yourself.\n\n3. development work would have to look different. As a driver, the most you can do is express wishes (e.g. I need a more stable front end) and the team implements them. The better the reputation and the position in the world championship, the quicker the team listens to your wishes. And provide feedback on new parts so that developments can also be discarded.\n\n4. the budget cap must be taken into account. The more damage you cause as a driver, the slower the pace of development should be.\n\nand so on...\n\nBut of course you could also give the license to the worst publisher of all time, who has no interest in good games, but only in their own margins.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

You can see how well a driver did (H2H, mean and median gap) against their teammate\n\n* over a season\n* over all qualifying sessions they took part in as teammates \n* against all his teammates at a particular circuit\n\nI compared times from sessions both drivers participated in. I.e. if driver A made it to Q3 and driver B got out in Q1, then their Q1 times were used. This means results such as Norris v Piastri in 2025 Saudi went to Norris because he crashed and couldn't set a Q3 time but was faster in Q2.\n\nThere is also a fourth feature where you can see how far off a driver's best time is from the fastest driver for every quali session in a season. I thought it would be interesting to see how the gap to the fastest changes over a year (like how Verstappen got closer and closer to Mercedes in 2020, or how Alonso got further away in 2023).\n\nData was fetched from the Jolpica (formerly Ergast) API. Only data from the 1994 season onwards is available (so unfortunately no Prost v Senna). There is also a lot of data from the late 90s and early 2000s seasons missing, so you may find it weird that only 32 results for Coulthard v Hakkinen across their career are shown.\n\nI am planning to make a post here about it but wanted some feedback first. I'm not a frontend guy so excuse the basic layout and style, but if you could suggest a change that is simple enough and would improve the look of the site I'll do it.\n\nhttps://www.f1teammatequali.com/"", 'Rosberg is back for Spain.', 'Had Gilles Villeneuve lived and stayed at Ferrari, do you think he would have won the 1985 championship in place of Alboreto?', ""Thanks to u/Blanchimont, u/No_Cauliflower7877, u/djwillis1121 for answering my long list of questions. I have a few more:\n\n\n\n1. Why did Hamilton go to Ferrari, I understand Ferrari is a great team, correct me if I am wrong, but Ferrari is not looking like a winner or having even a good environment currently.\n\n2. Why did Sainz and Albon go to Williams (and when). I am asking cause the 2019 season was very good for both of them. Did something drastic happen in the 5 years since?\n\n3. Why is Alonso in Aston Martin, he can get podiums and win races, so why don't other teams try to get him.\n\n4. Lando Norris, what's up with him? Like a general question.\n\n5. How big of a difference is between a McLaren and say a Redbull or Mercedes purely on basis of car. Redbull, Ferrari and Mercedes have enough expertise to build a strong car, so how come McLaren has such a strong car that they are currently winning a lot (ofcourse they have good drivers, but other than that).\n\n6. What is DRS, does it mean that you can overtake the driver in front, how do you calculate that?\n\n7. Do teams have tactics to promote one driver over the other? For example in qualifying in Monaco, they can have the number 2 driver go slow preventing drivers Piastri or Hamilton etc from having a good position (took example of Monaco cause overtaking is difficult)."", 'Is practice on today ? And if so does anyone know what time ?', ""I heard Ted Kravitz say Gasly's car had to be stopped by hand by the William's mechanics. Does anyone have a clip? I'd like to see how they managed that lol"", 'Which drivers champion won in the worst car?', 'Red Bull Collision Azerbaijan 2018. \nThis race was the first I ever watched and instantly got me hooked to the sport. But one thing I’ve wondered for a long time is why the double DNF came after the collision between the 2. Wouldn’t some new tires and a front wing made at least Daniel able to continue racing. No videos or photos I’ve seen have ever shown any irrepairable damage. Can anyone explain to me?
