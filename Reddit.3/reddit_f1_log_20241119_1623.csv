[The first historic group presentation is already set for 18 February](https://autoracer.it/it/f1-a-londra-un-grande-evento-di-lancio-della-stagione-2025/) even if it will only be the liveries and the great manoeuvres for the new set-ups of the various racing teams have already begun. Among the racing teams, **Ferrari** has [already made it clear](https://x.com/MuseiFerrari/status/1857455148869587089) that [the 2025 single-seater will be unveiled at a separate event](https://autoracer.it/it/ferrari-non-presentera-la-monoposto-2025-a-londra-non-sara-lunica/), and so will the other top teams. On the subject of the market, there are still some missing pieces in the chessboard for next season, such as the future of Colapinto and the knots at Red Bull, but 2025 can already be considered the year of revolution.\n\n**Abu Dhabi test: on track Arthur Leclerc and Antonio Fuoco, reserve driver pair 2025**\n\nBefore that, however, there will be another step after the Abu Dhabi race that will close the 2024 world championship, namely post-season testing. Very willingly, **Ferrari has given the go-ahead for Carlos Sainz** to test the Williams in Abu Dhabi after the last round of the championship. It will thus be the beginning of a new partnership with Alexander Albon, a pair that in the announcement Williams described as one of the most formidable on the grid. **Lewis Hamilton, on the other hand, will not be present with Ferrari**, being unable to leave before 31 December. A question of opportunity after a great history and very complex contractual agreements. Nevertheless, Lewis Hamilton awaits the red car, like the most beautiful Christmas present, and **Ferrari has already planned what will be his ‚Äòentrance** ‚Äô to Maranello (we will analyse the plan). One will also have to wait to see **Kimi Antonelli** with Mercedes, the 18-year-old Italian called to Toto Wolff's court. The wait is also growing for **Gabriel Bortoleto**, Brazilian, F3 champion and F2 leader who will debut with Sauber (Audi), as well as **Liam Lawson**, with a future still to be decided between Red Bull and Racing Bulls.\n\n**Esteban Ocon** will be at Haas as early as testing, leaving Jack Doohan free to get into the Alpine for his first kilometres as a Formula 1 driver, while waiting to find out if the positive rumours about him are true, given how well he is spoken of by those who have seen him grow in the junior categories. Everyone is also waiting to see who will win the constructors‚Äò championship, given that the drivers‚Äô one is certain. **Ferrari, still in the fight, is not worried about rushing Lewis** and is meanwhile thinking about what set-up to give the team in the future. Antonio Giovinazzi is currently confirmed as a reserve driver. With him will also be **Arthur Leclerc**, who will spend more time on the track, forming a pair of reserve drivers as happened this year. It is understood that it will be the young Monegasque who will take part in FP1 in Abu Dhabi, for a special session with his brother Charles. In the rookie tests, on the other hand, which will also take place in Abu Dhabi, Arthur and Antonio Fuoco are both the main candidates to run kilometres on track. Fuoco, moreover, has recently driven the F1-75 and is the other driver who remains in the Cavallino's F1 orbit as a specialist in the Maranello simulator.\n\n**Ollie Bearman**, formerly a Haas driver, running three races this year, one with Ferrari and two with the American team, has lost his rookie status and will not be able to be employed in this role. On the other hand, there is no suggestion that Ferrari has evaluated **Gunayu Zhou** as a reserve driver. According to reports, the Chinese driver is not on the Scuderia's shortlist of names for the F1 project. It is not ruled out that the Scuderia will consider a third name as a reserve driver, should non-F1 commitments prevent Arthur Leclerc and Antonio Giovinazzi from being available, with appropriate evaluations underway. After a year in which no driver has moved, we are about to experience almost a revolution, between a legend joining the legend and the many young people who will create one of the greatest generational replacements in recent years. Notwithstanding the fact that a great figure like the veteran Alonso is not giving up, on the contrary, he can't wait to finally drive a single-seater signed by Newey."", ""Let's be real here.

Yet people act like he‚Äôs merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about ‚Äúexperimental setups‚Äù or ‚ÄúLewis is just unmotivated‚Äù, but, I‚Äôm sorry, that‚Äôs just a cop-out.

I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it‚Äôs just that people overlook George because they don‚Äôt like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance. It's hard to compare when we have no real baseline when it comes to the car."", '> Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019\n\nIt was Charles 2nd season in F1 against a driver who was competing for a title the season before. \n\nIn general I do agree Russell has been underrated but don‚Äôt agree with all the arguments you‚Äôve put forward.', 'I mean it‚Äôs actually about set up issues and a horrible car as a whole. Mercedes as a team seems to be pretty lost aswell. Lewis might be getting a little worse as he ages, but if the car is dialed in he‚Äôs still there. They‚Äôre 2 points apart this year and last year Lewis ended third, while George ended up in 8th place.', 'personally i‚Äôm curious to see how george and lewis do next year to grasp where they actually are because this merc is a very confusing car. Even if lewis is past his prime imo he is way too good of a driver to be struggling to get into the points. Younger guys usually find it easier to adapt to a car than the older guys.. so comparing how lewis does next to charles in a more ‚Äòpredictable‚Äô car and how good george does compared to the hyped up rookie is going to be fun', 'It‚Äôs hard to actually value the performances seeing as both drivers and team are so hit and miss. \n\nOver the 3 years though George has done a great job and I‚Äôd be surprised if Redbull don‚Äôt ask for him in a swap should Merc sign Max', 'I think the last three seasons they have both massively over driven an awful car.\n\nNeither of them get enough credit for that.\n\nLewis nearly finished second in the Championship last year - in that car!! That‚Äôs kind of why I don‚Äôt massively rate either Ferrari driver.', ""Obviously Hamilton is past his prime, but he's still a great driver and one of the best in the grid, and so is Russell. \n\nI think Russell is on a similar level to Leclerc and Norris and above Sainz. I rate Leclerc a bit higher than Russell and Norris though, but it's hard to know for sure who's better because they never drove the same car."", 'Wild statement: ‚ÄúVettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill‚Äù', 'Because if you compare the onboards for no longer than more than 5 seconds its clear they are not driving the same car for a while, despite many attemps on Lewis side to change his setup. When the car was regurlarly the same (late 2022, and 2023) he was ahead most of the time confortably.']",349,377,0.73,349,343,343,318,322,0.09999999999999998,318

Rosberg went on to win that race despite having a recalcitrant car, which has often been attributed to his being able to stay cool in the extreme temperatures.\n\nIndycar also gives drivers the option of running an actively cooled driving suit at certain races, particularly on long ovals.\n\nIt'll be the first time there'll actually be specific provision for such a device in the F1 regs though. Probably long overdue, but a good step forward given what we saw in Qatar last year"", 'It moves heat from a hot region to a cold region', 'This is not F1 exclusive. SO many other racing series use ‚Äúcool shirts‚Äù that pump fluid around a capillary system in the shirt.', "">The system tested in Mexico therefore involved a block of ice providing a heat exchange to fluid that was sent to a vest in the driver‚Äôs overalls via a piping system, with the cooled liquid then pumped around the vest.\n\nIf I am understanding this correctly, drivers would wear the vest where cooled liquid is pumped? Good to hear that they are also considering to raise the weight limit to accommodate the cooling system into the adjustments. I wonder if they will make it mandatory to wear during specific weather or anybody could wear it at any time *(given Mercedes' overheating issue, it seems like the heat comes on for them even in overall weather conditions that are not necessarily the worst in comparison, so I am trying to figure out how it works, especially for them)*\n\nThe previous idea of an AC unit in the car in of itself does seem rather tacky, but given the introduction of this cooling system, I would argue that I don't think drivers, whom are highly trained athletes, should be close to passing out in high temperatures, especially with what we saw in Qatar 2023 and Singapore 2024. This specific system sounds like a step in the right direction, honestly"", 'So glad to see they are focusing on cooling suits instead of trying to make a fuckin air conditioner', ""I think there's an easier solution: cooling the seat itself, as the battery and engine heat and the scrubbing on the floor is generating most of the heat."", 'Thanks u/SubcooledBoiling . You should look at electricity generation', ""It's not but when I checked the other day I could only find one FIA homologated active cooling fireproof underwear (Which was homologated last month).    \n\nAll other systems and clothing I could find online tended to be American and only homologated to the SFI 3.3 spec.       \n\nSo much like the change in underwear rules pushed manufacturers to create fireproof personal underwear, this should push manufacturers (like OMP, HRX, Puma, Sparco etc etc) to make cooling versions of their current thermals and get them homologated.\n\n**EDIT**.     \nWent to check and the FIA literally updated the list of Homologated protective clothing for drivers today.

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‚Äòround racing friend, for the latest batch of team updates, driver buzz, technical adventures and trackside stats is ready and waiting for you‚Ä¶

[*Throttle & Tread‚Äôs*](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/) thirteenth edition of *Last Week in Formula 1* has arrived.

Before leaving the garage, [you can catch up on last week‚Äôs issue here.](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-november-4-2024)

If you‚Äôre a rookie ‚Äòround these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly feature courtesy of *Throttle & Tread* recapping the most recent interesting and important goings-on in the Formula 1 world.

In the perfection-seeking spirit of F1, *Last Week in Formula 1* and *Throttle & Tread* are in a constant state of development. So any feedback you have on what‚Äôs covered, the format, or anything I missed is welcome in the comments.¬†

And if you, like me, enjoy pretty things‚Ä¶

You can have the pretty-with-pictures version of *Last Week in Formula 1*, along with *Throttle & Tread‚Äôs* *Briefings* and *Race Track Rundowns,* delivered safely into your inbox [by subscribing to *Throttle & Tread* on Substack.](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/)

Now let‚Äôs get down to business‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# Trackside Stats

Lol, shit‚Äîcourtesy of u/F1GuyDan, we now know that if Red Bull used Max Verstappen as a one-driver team, [they would have finished in the same place in the WCC standings every season of Max‚Äôs career, except for 2017 and 2022.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goz9xv/f1guydan_if_red_bull_used_max_verstappen_as_a/)

u/F1GuyDan also served up a Reddit specialty‚Äîfinding new ways to express how disappointing Sergio P√©rez has been this year: [We‚Äôve learned he‚Äôs closer to Zhou in the standings (who has 0 points) than Max, Charles, and Lando.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqx3zh/f1guydan_guanyu_zhou_is_closer_to_sergio_perez_in/)

**More on Max‚Äôs dominance:** [Here‚Äôs how he can win his 4th WDC title in Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1go8419/how_max_can_become_champion_in_las_vegas/)

And speaking of fast drivers, [here‚Äôs 2024‚Äôs Fastest Lap standings as of Brazil‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gorxqs/fastest_laps_2024/)

Along with [2024‚Äôs ‚Äòpodium‚Äô (so far) for top 5 finishes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpq39z/rn365_top_5_finishes_2024/)

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

Welp, this *should* put to bed any further rumours of where Checo will be next year. [Apparently Sith Lord Christian Horner has given the okay to Perez‚Äôs sponsors that he‚Äôll be driving for the main team next year, as per his contract.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gopmsh/marca_checo_p%C3%A9rez_is_not_moving_and_will_start/)¬†

Unrelated to anything of consequence, but a driver musing nonetheless, [Guenther Steiner had some blunt, choice words on the subject of Lance Stroll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goesf1/guenther_steiner_on_lance_stroll/)

Carlos Sainz was honoured by the Scuderia Ferrari Club in Maranello, [given a plaque that reads, *‚ÄúWherever you go, we will continue rooting for you. You‚Äôve entered our hearts, and you‚Äôll stay there.‚Äù*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplue3/motorsport_last_night_carlos_sainz_was_honored_by/) Hey I‚Äôm not crying‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre crying!

In a twist that caught me off guard but makes sense when you consider historical ties, [Zhou Guanyu‚Äîa former Ferrari Driver Academy padawan‚Äîis expected to become Scuderia Ferrari‚Äôs Reserve Driver for 2025.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gskr71/zhou_guanyu_is_expected_to_be_scuderia_ferraris/) Bravo Zhou!

On the subject of reserve drivers, while there‚Äôs no media confirming Mick Schumacher‚Äôs recent bit of vague-gramming, [I‚Äôd hazard a guess *this* means his time as Mercedes‚Äô reserve is over](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gtcojc/mick_sumachers_instagram_post/), paving the way for King Valtteri‚Äôs return.

For those interested in the goings-on of recently departed F1 drivers, [Logan Sargeant has done a seat fitting with IndyCar team Meyer Shank Racing,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp3hj7/otmeyer_shank_racing_step_1_seat_fit_logan/) ahead of what I assume will be a test with the team. As an IndyCar fan who watches all the races, Logie Bear better start sharpening his elbows‚Ä¶

While we‚Äôre on the subject of IndyCar, [Romain Grosjean is scrambling to stay on the grid next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp7c4a/grosjean_scrambling_to_stay_on_indycar_grid_in/) Alas, his classic form of oscillating abruptly between high peaks and low lows while collecting a trophy case of crashes won‚Äôt help.

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

In a surprising turn of juicy events‚Äîthat will affect all teams in one way or another‚Äî[F1‚Äôs Race Director Niels Wittich has been fired](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gppllt/panning_photo_of_charles_in_the_rain_during_q3/) ([rather than stepping down, as the FIA have claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplmhc/jennie_gow_breaking_niels_wittich_to_step_down_as/)). With only three race weekends remaining in 2024, the timing seems rather odd. I daresay we can add another name to the list of those butting heads with FIA head Mohammed Ben Sulayem.

*But ‚Äòol Rotten Eggs Benny Boy didn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶* [FIA Compliance Officer Paolo Basarri was also fired last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gr8pxe/bbc_sport_paolo_basarri_leaves_role_as_fia/) Which is *curious,* as Basarri happens to be the official who compiled a report into allegations that Sulayem interfered with operations during two races in 2023. [I think I smell a rat dictator?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ALZTuyM7lg)

In a similar vein, Greg Maffei, president and CEO of F1‚Äôs commercial rights holder, Liberty Media, [will leave his role at the end of the year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqd2ir/racefans_on_bluesky_greg_maffei_president_and_ceo/) I daresay we‚Äôre starting to see some effects of the FIA-FOM power struggle that‚Äôs been quietly reaching a boil since Mohammed took over the FIA leadership.

*The firings will continue until morale improves:* Aston Martin Technical [Director Dan Fallows, who was poached from Red Bull with great fanfare and high expectation, has been let go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpjono/dan_fallows_will_no_longer_serve_as_technical/) Current Aston Martin Executive Director [Bob Bell, a highly regarded design engineer who I‚Äôve never heard of, will fill in as TD on a temporary basis](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpkypa/bbc_executive_director_bob_bell_a_highly_regarded/) (I presume until Lord Newey is able to start drawing in British Racing Green). Daddy Stroll must be losing patience‚Ä¶

Well folks, in case you had any lingering doubts or were clinging to shreds of hope, Renault‚Äôs F1 engine program is officially *done.* [Alpine have confirmed their switch to Mercedes‚Äô engine and gearbox from 2026.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpioxc/f1_breaking_alpine_announce_they_will_switch_to_a/) In celebration of their storied success, [here‚Äôs a collage of all the championships they powered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpm4t9/so_long_renault_engines_heres_the_wccs_wdcs_they/)

*I was surprised when this one appeared in my timeline‚Ä¶* F1 is working on a proposed 2026 rule change that‚Äôll make life harder for customer teams like Toro Tauri VCARB or Haas: [If a team finishes P5 or higher in the WCC, they have to design all non-listed parts on their own after a period of three years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gru00i/tobi_gr%C3%BCner_formula_1_is_working_on_a_rule_change/) I can‚Äôt imagine this idea will go down well or smoothly‚Ä¶

In a related-and-exciting bit of news for Haas, while insisting have no plans to build an F1 engine, [Toyota wants to give Haas independence from Ferrari](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gsioi5/toyota_wants_to_give_haas_independence_from/) as they settle into supporting the project on the aerodynamics side.

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

The fine folks at [Ferrari appear to believe that F1‚Äôs wind tunnel time allocation rules (the worse you‚Äôre doing, the more time you get) will be a game changer for the 2026 regulation overhaul.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goofx4/why_ferrari_thinks_f1s_wind_tunnel_rules_could_be/) Their notion of course being that teams not fighting for the championship will self-sabotage/withhold resources in the first half of 2025 in order to get maximum wind tunnel time ahead of 2026.

There was an F1 Commission meeting last Wednesday, [in which they seem to have settled on a few items, courtesy of trusty F1 insider Chris Medland:](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqiv4p/chrismedlandf1_the_f1_commission_meeting_today/)

* A spec driver cooling kit for when a heat hazard is declared has been approved from next season onwards.  
* Yet-to-be-known tweaks for how the starting grid will close up when a team withdraws a car have been agreed upon.  
* And the post-Abu Dhabi rookie sprint race is slated for a 2026 debut.

**Macau, 2014.** [A young Max Verstappen finished 7th in the Macau Grand Prix after starting in 24th](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gsltl7/today_10_years_ago_max_verstappen_raced_in_the/)‚Äîa mighty impressive feat on a fast, twisty street circuit.
