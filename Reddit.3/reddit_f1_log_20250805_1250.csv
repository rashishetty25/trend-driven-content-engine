1mhccb8,Alex Brundle's theory on Leclerc's Ferrari problem at Hungary,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mhccb8/alex_brundles_theory_on_leclercs_ferrari_problem/,2025-08-04, Technical,,"['The pace drop-off was shocking.

The Aston Martin seemed like a tractor and then suddenly had both in the top 7. The Red Bull appears to (have) been capable of winning races for the first third of the season, while the second car can't get inside the top 15. The Merc also seemed competitive for the first third of the season.

The RB has been consistently able to be just inside the top 10 with three different drivers. The Sauber is a tractor that both of its driver's have been able to drive into the top 6. The Ferrari seems all over the show, the only vehicle that seems consistently shit is the Alpine, but even then Gasly has had it inside the top 10 a few times. 

So, given all that, how are we ranking them? I guess taking an average across the first half of the season I'd say:

1. McLaren 

2. Mercedes? This felt like an easy pick up until the last three races

3. Ferrari? Again, so all-over the place that it's hard to assess this car

4. Red Bull - It has been competitive at times in the hands of a generational talent, but worst on the grid while Yuki/LL have been piloting

5. Aston Martin - Stroll has been in and out of the points all season in the AM, and lately Alonso has been accumulating even more points than Stroll in it. Hungary in particular it was strong

6. Racing Bull - Doesn't have the pace to compete at the top, but is reliable and has been consistently in the 8-12 placings

7. Williams? - Has shown the ability to have pace, but has also been inconsistent despite having two very good drivers

8. Sauber? - Everyone labels it a tractor, but it has been on the podium and has scored points under both drivers

9. Haas - Seems harsh as it has scored points under both drivers hands too

10. Alpine - Gasly has regularly taken it into the points, but both second drivers have struggled to drive it out of the bottom quarter.

  
What are your feelings/rankings so far, I'm interested to see and have something to talk about while I wait for the Netherlands :)","['Tie between Mercedes and Ferrari as there have been races where one has been clearly better than the other.\n\nAnd I would order the middle and lower class of the grid like this: Williams, Aston Martin, Sauber, Haas, Racing Bulls & Alpine', 'Consistently, RB over Aston Martin', 'All teams are very close together overall, especially compared to the past. \n\nWhen it was normal that we saw some cars lapped multiple times and most cars lapped at least once, tier list of the constructors was easy. \n\nNow we have a double situation:\n\nAll teams are relatively close together, we have qualifyings where almost all cars are within 1s during Q1.

Now you jump halve the field. Hitting the tyres gives you another 0.5s compared to teams that miss it. \n\nMy current order is: McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull, racing bulls, sauber, Williams, Aston, Haas and Alpine. \n\nThe order 10 races ago might be quite different. With Aston even worse, Williams P5, Sauber worse and a change between Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull', 'The only certains things are Mclaren will finish P1 and Alpine P10 (only team with no upgrades since Barcelona and no upgrades scheduled for the rest of the season, 100% focusing on 2026).', 'As we\'ve seen several times this season, these cars are one upgrade from gaining or dropping several places in the pecking order. And the track can make a massive difference. Several teams have been at the back of the grid one week then deep in the points the next. So to call any of them ""tractors"" or ""shitboxes"" is in my opinion both dumb and also disrespectful. The field is so tight this year and it\'s hard to know which teams will swing which way, which is part of why this season is great. 1st is wrapped up. There\'s pretty much a 2-way battle for 2nd with 4th almost guaranteed. But behind them it\'s anyone\'s game.', 'Kick Sauber have looked significantly improved since there last upgrades a couple races ago', ""Don't want be mean or anything, but you are aware that there is a WCC that pretty much reflects the pecking order?"", 'I think the construtors points table is a pretty good indicator of where everyone is. The only real development is that it looks like the Sauber has improved a lot, so they can expect to move up if no one else does development', 'The Ranking between merc Ferrari and rbr is really Hard because they bassically had comparable results. \n\nI would say that you can, make an Argument for almost every Order between them.', ""I think Mercedes has been better than Ferrari, but Antonelli has let them down on the score board. Plus Monaco was a big swing vs Ferrari.\n\nHard to rate the VCARB. Been in Q3 at every round with at least 1 driver, but they're both rookies. I think it's a better car than the Williams though.\n\nAston Martin are really inconsistent and some terrible luck for Alonso has lowered their score a bit. Overall a better car than the Sauber, Haas and Alpine group. AM are maybe equal with VCARB and Williams, ignoring points.\n\nSauber are a surprise after their updates. Potentially as good as the Aston Martin now, which will make it interesting against them going forward. And will be a headache for the 2nd driver in the top 4.""]",0,20,0.45,0,17,17,0,4,0.09000000000000002,0
