This graph also does not take sprint races into account and only the drivers' Grand Prix finishing position. DNFs are counted as the drivers' classified position. e.g. I put Lando down as P18 in canada as he was the last car to DNF but Oscar P20 in Azerbaijan as he DNFed on the first lap 

Lando in the dark orange had a very good start to the season winning the opening round. His average tailed off slightly losing the lead for the champion to Oscar after the Saudi Arabian GP. His results then stayed around the same until Spain where they dropped off heavily after a DNF in Canada. His average was then down after that race as even though he was getting podiums, the DNF skewed his average. This is then compounded by the DNF in the Dutch GP after which he hasn't got a win since.

Oscar didn't have a great start to the season finishing P9 in Australia but his performances picked up and as he won the next race in China, After which he only finished off the podium once up until Azerbaijan where he DNFed and has not got on the podium since which as brought down his average significantly.

Max had a good start to the season but his average finish was slowly declining until is dramatically dropped off after he was taken out by Kimi Antonelli on the first lap in Austria. His average then stayed low until the Italian GP after which it has been on a sharp incline. This shows that his form in recent races has picked up and that his is now closing the gap to Lando and Oscar in the championship.","['The hungry grand prix, yummy', 'Piastri completely dominated the European stretch in the middle of the season. \n\nYou can see the DNFs for Max at Austria, Norris at Canada, and Piastri at Baku.  \n\nWhat a tear Max has been on since Monza.', ""I don't think you should be counting the races where they didn't finish towards an average FINISHING position stat imo. \n\nAnd if you're talking about their CLASSIFIED position, then you shouldn't be counting Piastri's DNF in Baku and Verstappen's in Austria, as neither was classified."", 'If Max loses the Championship this year by less than 9 points, he’s going to regret that bone headed decision to crash into George in Spain.', 'what the fuck happened', 'How did Lando’s go so low?

Constructor| Points 
---------|----------
McLaren | 678
Mercedes | 341
Ferrari  | 334
Red Bull| 331

I haven't seen this discussed anywhere, as I think most people are focused on the WDC fight, but the fight for 2nd in WCC will likely affect the results of the WDC.

Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull have been constantly improving the car as they fight for second, while McLaren have not had any upgrades since Monza. This could result in McLaren falling back even further as their performance is caught up by the other 3. It's possible that by Abu Dhabi that the McLaren are the 3rd or 4th fastest car, meaning the challenge by Verstappen could be a lot easier as Ferrari and Mercedes start getting podiums.","['That’s an interesting perspective.

Numbers for Laps Lead % come from [statsf1.com](http://statsf1.com) .

HPP stands for Highest Possible Points, so how many points you'd have if you won every race of the season.

Again.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oflyo6/the_wdc_may_go_down_to_the_wire_in_abu_dhabi_again/,2025-10-25, Discussion,"The championship might get decided in Abu Dhabi as we could end up with a 3-way tie in Qatar. I came across this nice website and played around with it a bit: https://ykstv.com

Current points (gap): 
* Piastri: 346
* Norris: 332 (14)
* Verstappen: 306 (40)

Let’s assume we have VER 1st, NOR 2nd and PIA 3rd in the next 4 races. Also, in the sprints we assume that Oscar goes 2nd and 4th, Lando 1st and 3rd, and Max 2nd and 4th.

Projected points:
* Piastri: 346 + 60 (race) + 12 (sprint) = 418
* Norris: 332 + 72 (race) + 14 (sprint) = 418 
* Verstappen: 306 +100 (race) + 12 (sprint) = 418

It’s a very specific scenario that gives us 3 drivers tied going into the last race. Not very likely but not out of the question either.

More likely is that we have something similar play out where their points are not exactly equal  but are close enough that the winner of Abu Dhabi will be crowned WDC.

Hopefully 2025 will not be mired in controversy like 2021.  But who knows? It might be something worse than that. This sport does not lack for drama, on track or off track.","[""Has had to win everything to get close, or McLaren needs to even more fuck up, and then still he has to win everything. I don't see it happening with Mercedes and Ferrari in the mix"", ""Max is a genuine killer, Lando doesn't have that, I thought Oscar did butit's looking less and less every weekend.  \nMax is certifying his spot on the goat list and frankly 'm not mad, once in a generation talent."", ""You don't say?

This simply means the driver who scores highest will win the title.\n\nWhat is much more interesting is when there are small gaps between the drivers that may or may not be overcame depending on a specific position permutations. This is exactly what made ""IS THAT GLOCK?!"" moment special. Massa camp was already celebrating as Felipe crossed the line, but one position gained on the last corner flipped the scenario in Lewis\' favour.', ""I'll be amazed if Max hasn't wrapped it up by then. It isn't just the red bull is now competitive, it's the other crucial factor of Ferrari and merc coming good. Red Bull bring 4 upgrades this weekend, 2 of which are performance enhancing.
