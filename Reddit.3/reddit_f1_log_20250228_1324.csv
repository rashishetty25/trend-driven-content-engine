This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our¬†[guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our¬†[FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H√§kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

But how do you think or hope they will introduce this? \n\nSimilar to DRS with DRS detection points and zones? \n\nOr in a completely different way? \n\nCurious to hear your ideas!', '3 questions of the same type:\n\nIf Derek Warwick had signed for Williams in 1985 instead of staying at Renault, how do you think he would have done?\n\nIf Alesi had gone to Williams instead of Ferrari in 1991, what would he have achieved?\n\nIf Hill went to McLaren in 1998 instead of going to Jordan (or going in 1997 instead of going to Arrows), what would have happened?', 'An overtake button, like in Super Formula, would be super cool to see. I think it would make races even more engaging, as there is strategy involved in when to use up your overtake, instead of just passing other cars on a straight.', 'If Alesi goes to Williams then presumably Mansell does not. In that scenario he absolutely walks the 92 season similarly to Mansell. We know based on their respective comparison to Prost that Mansell and Alesi would probably be closely matched, with maybe an edge going to Mansell over a single lap.\n\n93 would be interesting for Alesi at Williams. Prost was weaker after his sabbatical, but maybe not by as much as some might suspect. Hill did a terrific job that year. I wonder how much Jean might have been mentally tested by having a quick rookie challenge (or even beat) him the year after winning a title.\n\nWas Hill at McLaren in 97 ever realistically going to happen? I always understood 98 was a better possibility. It really depends a lot on who he would‚Äôve replaced. I think a competitive car would‚Äôve brought the best out of Damon at that time. I thought his bad days in 96 when he made bad starts and sat behind slower cars were really just a result of tentativeness, an eagerness to avoid the mistakes of 95. With a WDC under his belt and the monkey off his back, I think we might have seen a much more authoritative but assured version of Damon. If so, he‚Äôd have had a good chance of winning the 98 title. I‚Äôd bet on him against Coulthard, with Mika we might have seen a 1986-style scenario where they take enough points from each other to let Schumacher in, but that‚Äôs if Damon is at his best.']",4,5,0.71,4,4,4,-1,1,-0.15000000000000002,-1
1izf9rt,Do teams have their own camera crews?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1izf9rt/do_teams_have_their_own_camera_crews/,2025-02-27, Discussion,"There are always boom mics and camera crews in the team garages. Do they make an in-house end of season documentary or is it something for fans? I guess another option would be maybe they‚Äôre recording all the conversations to help them with race prep but that seems unnecessarily complicated as the kit being used isn‚Äôt cheap.

Does anyone know? I‚Äôd be interested if there‚Äôs an answer! ","['Every team has their own media and social team, boom mics will be used occasionally when shooting content. Certain drivers also have their own content producing teams.\n\nThey may also be from Netflix.', ""I think if it's a boom, you can assume it's netflix. But teams do have camera team/person in the garage, but they don't usually use the same big camera like a tv crew would. I think they just use like a dslr"", 'I‚Äôve always wondered if teams are given an iso feed from every camera. That would allow the teams to switch cameras as needed in order to follow their car.\n\nThe program feed is often seen on tvs around the paddock, but that typically excludes most of the vehicles on grid.', 'I know about photographers, teams have their photographers to spy on other teams', 'Those aren‚Äôt the photographers OP will be referring to.
