1o75afv,Have F1 races become more boring or more exciting since the 90‚Äôs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o75afv/have_f1_races_become_more_boring_or_more_exciting/,2025-10-15, Discussion,"As a new fan, I last watched a race when Schumacher was the reigning champion. I was a baby then so didn‚Äôt really understand much. For those who have been watching f1 for long, have the races become more exciting or more boring? 

What elements do you miss from the older eras? Are there any sources to watch the greatest races of all time? 
","[""Different is my answer, they are different to how they used to be. Some things more exciting and some things less exciting.\n\n* Reliability - races in the 90s were punctuated by wildly unrpedicatable relaibility, cars could and would break down at any moment, no race result was ever safe until you crossed the line\n* Lack of on track action - races in the 90s often were decided in the pitlane, particularly once refueling came in, it was easier to pass in the pits than on track... so cars did\n* Field Spread - the field spread in the 90s was huge, the gaps between the front few cars and even the lower end of the top 6 could be over a second a lap, cars were being lapped within the first 10 laps and would be lapped 4 times a race, F1 now is closer than it has ever been in it's history\n* Points down to 6th place - Points only being given to 6th palce made it a real achievement to score any, but this is somewhat balanced out by the unreliability meaning it was possible for any team to score points on a given day if luck is on their side\n* Driving Standards - The drivers generally are much much better today through the field. Not saying Verstappen is better than Senna or anything, but the midfield and backmarkers are leagues above what we had in the 90s. Meaning less silly collisions and drivers chucking it at the scenery\n* Difficulty of driving the cars - 90s cars were more 'alive' and more difficult to drive at the pace required in races, this would result in more mistakes from drivers\n* Less 'management' - Races now involve a lot of tire management, in the 90s this was less of a thing and races were more flat out sprints punctuated by pit stops\n* Professionalism - F1 now is far far more professional which results in less unpredicatability as less just plain amateur hour stuff happens"", ""Statistically I'd say it's pretty close. There were issues then (different tyre companies that could practically determine who could win and who could not in some years or races) there are other issues now (dirty air with the development of aerodynamics), there was fuel strategy before there's active aerodynamics now.\n\nThe grid is much closer today, there aren't teams who actually risk of not making the 107% at least.\n\nWhat F1 had until like a decade ago that is declining is more frequent mechanical failures, which could shake up the grid or the championship battle.\n\nThe sources are F1TV if available where you are from what I've heard (I don't personally have it), internet archives too.\n\n\nSome favourite races off the top of my head:\n\n* Monaco 1961 - Moss' greatest drive, one of the best editions of the Monaco GP (there are highlights, not the full race)\n* Italy 1976 (Monza) - one of the greatest sports comebacks\n* Sweden 1978 (Anderstorp) - one-off for the fan car\n* France 1979 (Dijon) - best battle ever?\n* Monaco 1982 - the race nobody wanted to win\n* Monaco 1984 - rookie's masterclass in the rain\n* Europe 1993 (Donington Park) - lap of gods\n* Monaco 1996 - chaos start on wet track\n* Spain 1996 (Catalunya) - one of the Kaiser's best\xa0\n* Europe 1999 (N√ºrburgring GP) - chaos GP\xa0\n* France 2004 (Magny-Cours) - for the strategy\xa0\n* Japan 2005 (Suzuka) - one of the greatest comebacks ever\n* Europe 2012 (Valencia) - a masterclass in starting and driving\xa0\n* Austria 2019 (Red Bull Ring) - nice fight for the victory\xa0\n* Germany 2019 (Hockenheimring) - one of the best wet races to date\n* Sakhir 2020 (Sakhir) - one of the greatest comebacks in recent years\n* Hungary 2021 (Hungaroring) - the weirdest start ever (even more than Indy 2005)\n\n\nNot strictly racing, but I'd also advice to watch archive footage of testing too, there's one of Fangio driving the 250F around the Modena Autodrome or there's one where Castellotti is driving the D50 in Spa."", ""Back in the 90s there were far more engine failures, kabooms, that shook up the races and the championship.\n\nRefuelling added more strategy options.\n\nDifferent tyre manufacturers, like different engine suppliers, added drama... although that did give us the 2005 US Grand Prix, where 14 of the 20 cars didn't take part, so maybe we're better off with a single supplier.\n\nAero has gotten so powerful now that artificial means such as DRS are needed, but DRS trains still turn racing into trainspotting.\n\nI still enjoy F1. I'm glad slick tyres came back, and I'm glad there are mandatory pit stops and different tyre compounds... Both of these are rule impositions designed to force some kind of drama into the sport (meaning that, left to their own devices, teams might do zero-stop races with the best tyres Pirelli or Michelin, etc. can make, and they'd win).\n\nToday's F1 is more reliable, mechanically, but more boring, due to fewer overtakes and fewer opportunities for race order shake-ups.\n\nSince I started watching F1, at the end of the 80s, there has always been a dominant team, but in the last decade or so dominance, reliability, and DRS has been overwhelming to the point that it's more interesting to follow the midfield or even back marker teams... Enjoying when a back marker gets into the midfield, or even the rare times they score a point. Up at the front it's kind of meh."", 'Closer gaps between cars, much better reliability, but also more predictable in many ways.\n\nThe tech guys are really maximizing things, getting the cars close on performance and running optimal strategies.', ""In my opinion, the biggest misconception is that Formula 1 races have become boring in recent years.  \nFrom a racing perspective alone, it's arguably the worst series around.   \nIt has always been more like a game of chess at 300 kph.  \nPast races perhaps felt more exciting because an element that has now been minimised was more prevalent: Reliability and technical failures.   \nThese failures added an extra element of unpredictability ‚Äî I still haven't got over Michael's engine failure at Suzuka in 2006.  \nIf you don't believe me, watch a race from the '90s or '00s.   \nSome seasons were so dull that, in 2005, the FIA introduced tyres that needed to last the whole race in an attempt to end Ferrari's domination.  \nIf you have F1 TV, the archive is a great source."", ""I'd say that it's more engaging as a whole since we have a larger scope of media coverage,both on and off track.\n\nSome races are boring as heck. Some are wonderful.\n\nBot the whole thing is wonderful."", 'Boring is the wrong word, but I think races have become very predictable. Teams are too good at what they do, cars are too reliable and DRS is too much of an equalizer imo.', ""I think there's probably more overtaking and the grid is closer, but I loved the variety we used to get in the 90s vs today's tightly specified cars, and the number of races made each one feel much more important."", ""There has been no consistent trend. The 90s were fantastic, then the early 2000s featured Schumacher dominance and little competition, and overtaking rarely happened, but it was majestic to watch at times because the way Michael commanded F2004 and wrestled it around a track at unimaginable speeds on narrow grooved tyres while the V10 screamed behind him, it felt like it defied the laws of physics. And there were still a lot of excellent races here and there and a particularly competitive 2003 year.  \n  \n2006-2012 was absolute peak F1, particularly 2009 onwards when the racing got a lot better, with tight competition and titles coming down to the wire between multiple teams routinely. 2013 was basically a throwaway while the teams prepared for the new rules in 2014, which proved to be an absolute disaster for the sport. 2014 to 2020 was the absolute worst the sport has ever been with zero competition and it being clear that one team was guaranteed to take everything from the first day of testing. 2021 was of course a complete anomaly. 2022 started great but each year has gotten slightly worse than the last for racing. \n\nThe main thing I miss from older eras are smaller, more nimble cars, louder and better engines, and actual proper racing in the wet. But as much as people decry it, DRS has worked wonders for the quality of racing and the mandatory tyre changes and single tyre manufacturer that tries to create deliberate offsets has generally worked well too, even if they get the balance wrong a lot of time. The sport is much healthier financially these days too, with an incredibly competitive midfield and no real backmarker teams, with pretty much anyone on the grid capable of scoring points, which certainly wasn't the case in the 2000s and 90s."", 'Races in the 90s were mostly fuel strategy based so most overtakes happened in the pit lane. \n\nWheel to wheel racing is more common now thanks to DRS and offset tyre strategies. But we‚Äôre increasingly seeing less variation in tyre strategy.\n\nThe biggest difference is probably reliability. It was common in the 90s to see 10+ mechanical DNFs.']",0,82,0.41,0,276,276,0,0,0.009999999999999953,0
