1oaklnp,Stroll suffers 30th consecutive grand prix qualifying defeat to Alonso: Qualifying data,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oaklnp/stroll_suffers_30th_consecutive_grand_prix/,2025-10-19, Statistics,,"[""Stroll obviously isn't Ayrton Senna, but 30-0 for a 44-years old is crazy. That means no off weekends, no deleted laps for track limits, very strong banker laps against flags or worsening track conditions, etc. Insane focus and consistency about 10 years later after the average driver starts to falter.\n\nF1 has been taking Alonso for granted after 13+ years of average to shitty cars, but he's still scary. We talk about his theoretical peak pace dropping with age, which I'm sure it has done, but his pace relative to Stroll hasn't dropped at all in 3 years. And regardless of that, if he'd had a McLaren this year we know he would've bottled very very few of his chances unlike Lando and Oscar.

I think this is obvious to anyone."", 'In the last 30 races Stroll has outqalified Verstappen, Norris, Piastri, Leclerc, Russell, Hamilton, Sainz and so on but not Alonso. Crazy', ""My theory:\n\n1. Stroll is generally a couple of tenths slower than Alonso in qualifying.  With the maturity of the rules and teams focusing on 2026 the field has closed up in qualifying and now that gap mean Alonso goes to Q2 or Q3 while Stroll is out in Q1 or Q2.\n\n2. Stroll is inconsistent.  Sometimes he'll put in a great lap seemingly out of nowhere.  But since he keeps getting eliminated early he has had a lot fewer chances for those kinds of laps.\n\n3. As we have seen in races with Alonso, luck is a factor. You'd think at  least once he'd run into traffic when Stroll didn't, or get caught out by a red or yellow flag when he needed a lap, and so on.  Instead his bad luck seems to hit him during the race instead."", 'Alonso is a scary driver ngl', 'Alonso is 44, alien.', 'I do wonder what the long term planning is at Aston. Alonso probably retires at the end of next season having had a year in a Newey designed car , Stroll would be better off going to WEC. They\'ve not really invested in an academy either. \n\nI know they\'ll try and blank cheque another "" name"" driver but everyone is under long contracts now and is the shiny new factory, works Honda power and Newey enough to attract anyone? \n\nUltimately does this end up with Lance leaving the sport and Lawrence selling the team to PIF/Aramco? I feel like I even have more of a fix on Alpines future than trying to figure out Aston.']",965,105,0.98,965,2244,2244,3,2,0.0,3
1oak2a8,Verstappen could become World Champion with Red Bull being in 4th place in the Constructors Championship.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oak2a8/verstappen_could_become_world_champion_with_red/,2025-10-19, Discussion,"Isnâ€™t this crazy? The last 6 races are going to be epic! Has this ever happened in the past that the team of the world champion finished 4th or worse?
