Maybe one of your guys had the random idea of a double diffuser while showering and you look like a genius for a season. But what he says about Sauber completely losing sight of the present definitely tracks. They made big leaps in the final fifth of the year:\n\n>""When I joined in August, really, it was like a team that was almost frozen,"" added Binotto. ""So while making sure that we had the proper plans in our journey to become a top team in the future, we really needed to boost the team for improvement and possibly already during the current season.\n\n>""How important the current season was was not only about not finishing with zero points, because finishing 10th with zero or 10th with four points does not change much.\n\n>""But it was more for us to make sure that we have defined the proper direction of development for next season as well – and being energised through the wintertime.\n\nI agree that you have to keep the tension to improve every season because otherwise when ""your year"" comes you won\'t have the right processes to compete. Strategizing long-term is of course the main job of Audi in their position, but you can\'t ignore continuous development and the meaning of fighting (even if it\'s for random points) because you will grow a culture of passivity.', ""To everybody who usually only reads the headline read the interview, its a really good and insightful one.\n\nToto Wolff once said that success in F1 is all about the long term.

Makes his podium all the less likely. Although Binotto is making sure there are already improvements this season and the next. I mean that Sauber in the last 3-4 races was reasonably fast and got them their first few points.

Not at all, because we will not have the people in place, we will not have the facilities in place and all the tools required.\n\nSome really good insight by Binotto here.

On a regular race weekend he could compete well but when the car wasn’t great and he wasn’t running out front, he just didn’t seem to have the consistency or racecraft of a top driver and he made too many errors. \n\nThere were really only four or five races where Massa could keep up with Schumacher in 2006, and that’s not far off what we saw with Alonso in 2010. He scored 57.1% of Alonso’s points that year compared to 66.1% vs Schumi. I would argue that isn’t due to Massa being weaker in 2010, but more the competition was much stronger. There were three top-tier cars in 2010 compared to two in 2006 and that one of those 2006 cars had a woeful Fisichella in it. An average day for Massa simply left him with a worse result - including relative to his team-mate - in 2010.\n\nThe next few years Massa dipped to 45.9%, 43.8% and 46.2% of Alonso’s points. However, between the 2012 summer break and Spain 2013, we saw a significant upturn in form that saw him score 66.3% of Alonso’s points - almost the exact same as he scored vs Schumacher in 2006, demonstrating that previous level was still within him. During that stretch he scored all three of his post-2010 Ferrari podiums and had some other excellent battling drives from positions of adversity like in Singapore. He also did it during a stretch where Alonso was quite clearly at the top of his game, so Massa was almost certainly the variable here. \n\nI think what really affected Massa from the start of 2011 until that late 2012-early 2013 spell was that Ferrari were much less competitive than in 2010, then in Monaco 2013 he had two heavy crashes and it felt like that dented his confidence, because he dipped again after that.\n\nPeople will say ‘Surely he improved in 2007 and 2008 and then declined?’. I would agree 2007 was his best year, he made fewer mistakes than in other prime years except the first half of 2009. In 2008 he was very erratic and was made to look good by Raikkonen making several errors of his own in addition to the team’s development path working against him.', ""There's a Beyond The Grid episode with his race engineer who said that his speed was unaffected.

In principle, it was a luxury problem, both would have deserved the promotion. But Lawson may have more room for improvement in the future. It was his mental strength in particular that tipped the scales in the end.”\n\n(Marko)\n\n>""It was very, very tight between the two of them. I mean, Yuki is a very fast driver. He\'s got three or four seasons of experience now. He did a very good job in the tire test for us in Abu Dhabi where the engineers were impressed with how he performed.\n\n>""With Liam, when you look and go into the analytics of his race, pace was slightly better in the races that he did. His qualifying pace was very tight with Yuki, and you\'ve got to assume that the potential with Liam having only done 11 grand prix, is he\'s only going to get better and stronger. He\'s shown real mental resilience and toughness.\n\n>""A couple of things have stood out with me with Liam - how versatile he is,"" Horner said. ""You put him into a situation, he gets on with it. If you remember his debut in Zandvoort after Daniel broke his fingers, he was racing against Max on his out lap.\n\n>""He\'s got that kind of gritty racer mentality. He did a year in the DTM where he adjusted to driving a Ferrari GT car incredibly quickly alongside Alex Albon and generally had the upper hand. And again, his racecraft has been really one of his key strengths. So he\'s not afraid to go wheel-to-wheel and even rub wheels where necessary. So I think he\'s going to do a great job for us.""\n\n>Horner added:\n\n>""The engineers have enjoyed working with him through the running that he\'s done this year. He\'s got a good work ethic as well. So it is great to have Yuki still involved with the Racing Bull scene next year. And of course he\'s on standby should he ever be required.""\n\n(Horner)\n\nthat is the reason given. Everyone can have their opinion on whether this ""justifies"" the decision, ultimately Red Bull only needs to justify it to themselves. We also don\'t know the internal picture.\n\nI would have understood had they given the seat to yuki.

It's not like they kicked out a good driver bur Lawson and people are looking for reasons why.
