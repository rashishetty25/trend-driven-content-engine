This is his memory about a practical joke pulled by Piquet against Charlie Whiting.

""Nelson was used to peeing himself on purpose before a Grand Prix. Frankly disgusting. After a few minutes on track, on the grid, some liquid started dripping from the car. Mechanics and technicians scrambled to find the origin of the leak. Piquet nods to Whiting. 'What happens? A leak? Is it oil?'. There is no time, the race is starting...

I cannot find any information on how those specific crossings - the parts were the F1 track crossed the horse racing track - were managed.



There are only to options, both seem problematic: either the horse racing track was paved over or the GP circuit was covered with sand/earth/dirt/whatever it is that a horse racing circuit is made of.

If they paved it, they had to remove the asphalt after every Grand Prix to make it useable for the horses again.

If they put sand over persisting asphalt, wouldn't that still be noticeable during the horse races or maybe even be bad for the horse's legs?

  
Any information on this topic would be much appreciated!","['At Aintree the crossing points are actually public roads - Melling road which you can look up on Google maps is the road. \n\nThe horse racing has multiple layouts, the only one with crossover is the Grand National.

1mmhfbd,Which qualifying format is your favourite?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mmhfbd/which_qualifying_format_is_your_favourite/,2025-08-10, Discussion,"I was listening to bring back V10 about the 2005 season and they mentioned aggregate qualifying, and I had totally forgotten about this format. It made me think about all the different formats we had over the years. The changes were always made to improve excitement. Question is obviously did they. 

I grew watching F1 in the 90's drivers got 12 laps in an hour and the fastest lap would count. Problem was teams would wait untill the track was the fastest, leading to everyone getting out in the last half hour, meaning we were watching the first half hour at an empty track. 

Then they experimented with aggregate qualifying. Meaning 2 qualifying sessions over 2 days and the times would be aggregated.
Wasn't a succes.

We also had 1 lap qualifying. Everyone would get 1 timed lap. 

Didn't last either.

The last few years we have had the 3 part qualifying with the knock out system. It brings some excitement, but im not a fan.

Usually im not nostalgic, but the 12 lap qualifying is my favorite.","['The current format', 'I grew up on the 12 lap format.

I liked it mostly because in a way it turned out to be something of a new sport, like downhill or slalom.\n\nI quite like the three session format too, but I wouldn't mind if the Q3 drives got to do their final laps one at a time on the track. Either in order based on Q2 or a weighted random by position.
