1nnmk9j,A look at 2025 McLaren's dominance in a world without Max Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nnmk9j/a_look_at_2025_mclarens_dominance_in_a_world/,2025-09-22, Statistics,"I wanted to see how dominant the MCL38 really is. Normally you‚Äôd compare its results to the F2004, RB7, W11, RB19‚Äîbut those teams weren‚Äôt challenged by the grid‚Äôs best driver in a weaker car, and that‚Äôs making the field seem closer to McLaren than it really is. So I asked: how dominant would MCL38 be if Verstappen fucked off to race GT cars this season?

I compared the best-performing McLaren (Oscar or Lando) each GP against the field, then re-ran the numbers with Verstappen removed. The difference is highlighted at the bottom. (Extreme outliers that skewed the averages are removed in the ‚Äòfinal‚Äô numbers.)

**TL;DR**

* **Avg. quali margin:** ‚Äì0.106s ‚Üí ‚Äì0.187s without Max (**77% difference**). McLaren now has 14 poles.
* **Avg. race margin:** ‚Äì7.727s ‚Üí ‚Äì12.453s (**61% difference**). McLaren now has 15 wins.
* **Avg. fast lap margin:** ‚Äì0.241s ‚Üí ‚Äì0.304s (**26% difference**). Same total fastest laps.
* **Points:** 623 ‚Üí 666 (**+7%**) (likely the least meaningful stat of the bunch)

*Take from that what you will. Obviously, this is not an exact science, but interesting data nonetheless. The only thing I know for sure we‚Äôd be bored to tears without Max this year. If people are interested, I‚Äôll compare these numbers to other dominant cars once the season‚Äôs over.*","['I mean yeah the top team would look even better if you take the best other competitor out of the equation, you can do this with any sport. This doesn\'t really show ""how dominant the McLaren *really* is"", it shows the season without Verstappen.\n\nThis also assumes that McLaren was faster than RB in all of the races they lost to him and thats not really true.

1nnd5l6,"A Discussion about Team Principal background, and subsequent team success.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nnd5l6/a_discussion_about_team_principal_background_and/,2025-09-22, Discussion,"This past weekend at Baku was quite fun to watch for a lot of reasons, but the sudden and vivid resurgence of Red Bull was a flash point for me, and really got me thinking about what a fast and wild turnaround RBR has had since Laurent Mekies took over. 

That got me thinking about Principals, and teams, and wholesale performance depending on who is in charge, which led me to this wild post, which I would love for you to read, and subsequently discuss. 

An article shared a few days ago by u/enesracing about how Mekies is improving RBR's performance has, so far, proven true with this weekend's race. This was Yuki's best race so far with RBR, and Max had a classic race where he torched the competition all weekend. Arguably, it's because McLaren was weak here, but there were simply ""other things"" that seemed to go right all weekend, and things went well last weekend as well. The timing of pit stops, the tire strategy, the way the cars were set up, it all seems to be dialed in in a way that it hasn't in a long time for RBR. I am mostly convinced it's because Mekies has an engineering background and has \[probably\] been very pragmatic about his approach to the car. Horner was a driver. Always seemed like a ""feels"" guy who was comfortable stirring the pot--positively and negatively--to get results. And results were indeed had under Horner, for a long time, but the recent burnout has been unreal, and that cursed second RBR seat is, I'm convinced, partly his doing. Not sure how, but they are the only team on the grid with such an insane divergence in pace. 

More fuel: Mekies was/is also responsible for Racing Bulls and Alpha Tauri's marked success and consistency, and with him at the helm RBR will finish the season strong. Tost, a racing driver, however, got the B-side RBR team there while dealing with Horner, and they--and arguably RBR as well during the Renault era--burned hot and also super cold as Toro Rosso and Alpha Tauri with racing drivers at the helms of both teams. There is also some ""B-Team to save face"" shenanigans happening in the background with the RB team, of course, so maybe they aren't the greatest case study. 

Anyhow, in a nutshell, sort of based on RBR's recent drama, here's my theory:

engineer -> principal -> consistency, good or bad, long term...

and/or 

racing driver -> principal -> huge swings in success and failure...

or maybe no correlation at all? 

So, as soon as I thought about it, it immediately got my wheels turning about other teams, and it turned into an interesting thought exercise. 

I'm not going to go into \*every\* principal of every team, obviously, because that would take all year. But, I do want to deep dive into some of the teams and their principals to see if I'm just taking crazy pills, or if there's something to my theory. 

I'm going to keep things fairly modern, because that's when a lot of folks got into the sport. I am also going to attempt to do a fairly diverse sample size, and take a gander at some of the more interesting teams of the past decade.

Here we go:

\-Ferrari. Oh, Ferrari. The ostensive clown parade at Ferrari seems to be unaffected by Fred. Fred is an engineer. Which, it seems, is unfortunate for the Tifosi, and poor Charles and Lewis (and Kimi, and Seb, and Carlos). Ferrari hiring lots of engineers to head the team has done them no good. Let's be real, they, as a team, show flashes of brilliance, but the team has kind of have been in the same situation since Binotto. Beautiful cars with no teeth that destroy rear tires, and a hilariously backwards pitwall strategy for the entire weekend. Ironically and crazily, Arrivabene was the flash point for them in recent times, and he is a marketing and sales guy (which is still shocking to me, and always has been). They had moderate success, but truly chaotic moments, with him at the helm. Maybe they need a big swing at a driver to spice things up? Ferrari has obviously been around for 10,000 years, so there is a metric shitton of history I am just passing by, but I would be curious to chop it up with a Ferrari lore expert about my theory in regards to earlier Ferrari eras (Schumacher era, maybe?)

\-Alpine is interesting. Moderate success with Otmar, who is an electrical engineer, and also a marketing guy. Oakes, a driver, who fizzled out incredibly fast but also gave Alpine some success (podiums, points, decent finishes). He was set up by Famin, an engineer. So, Success and stability=Engineer....kind of...in Alpine's case, but \*wins\* with the driver at the helm, which led to absolute bedlam. And now with wacky ole Insurance Salesman/Restaurant manager/""Lifetime Ban"" enthusiast Flavio at the helm, you literally never know what you're going to get. If anything, Alpine proves my theory in spades in that they are wildly swing-y in how they perform, and their success has sort of followed the principals. 

Side note: Otmar drove Force India, Racing Point, and Aston Martin to perfect mediocrity. Silverstone is still mediocre, with more engineers at the helm. Let's be real, they (silverstone team Spyker/Force India/Racing Point/Jordan/Midland) had their best success with Eddie, way back when, and Eddie is a lot of things, but he is a racing driver first. Sooooo, racing driver principal=peaky success? 

  
\-Mercedes. The dominant force of F1 for almost a decade. Inseparable from Toto Wolff. Toto is a classic racing driver, and their incredible run has lasted an unusually long time with him at the helm, but they have arguably cracked now. Definitely a third or fourth place team at best. Yes, they won 8 championships in a row. They were unbelievably dominant for \*years\*, but something always felt unhinged behind the scenes at AMG Mercedes to me, and it always seemed to come back to Toto. The ""zero pod"" design was the first huge obvious miss, but I'd argue that the insanity that was Rosberg and Hamilton, letting Lewis run roughshod over Bottas for so, so many races with team orders and the aggressively fake ""yeah, we let them race"" statements was quite unhealthy and it always felt toxic an weird. Not to mention them letting their ""sister team"" Williams run around like a rabbit doused in acid for so long. AMG Mercedes Petronas has always screamed ""we are a well oiled machine that might blow up any minute"". They have sort of blown up now, but boy, it indeed took a minute. If my theory holds true, Toto should step back and hire an engineer. And I wonder, if they do that any time soon, if they will start getting right back up at the top instead of being dirty toilet water.

  
\-Williams is my speculation story. They have been, kind of like Alpine, a dumpster fire for a long time, but James Vowles is proof that a mathematician is probably the way to go towards righting a ship. I would also argue that he is smart enough to know that he should step aside if things get stale. Right now they are on a rocket trajectory back towards success, and you love to see it, but they are also dangerously close to mathing it all out too much, getting buried in numbers, and getting stuck in 3rd or 4th place. I'm calling it: they will have huge success if Vowles gets the boat going in the right direction, goes into a more managerial role, and hires some retired hothead racing driver to get them going. Alonso, for example, at Williams after he retires will send them \*straight\* to the top. And then, of course, they will come crashing down in spectacular dramatic fashion. Williams Dominance could be boring, but could absolutely happen. 

My final point is \[RECENT\*\] McLaren, and honestly, they are the case study that kind of proves my point, and I'm glad to argue it. I'll start off with Ron F'n Dennis, who, for so long, held that organization by the balls. And, definitely since 2014 (but arguably since \~2006), McLaren have essentially chased their tails around. Cue McLaren fan hate mail. Ron is, of course, a businessman, but started off as a gearhead mechanic. So, I'd argue for the sake of my wacky theory, more of an engineer. And he was in charge of the highest of highs in the late 90's and early 2000's but also spygate, etc. So, net, in the modern era, McLaren (Like the other old ass team, Ferrari) have been Consistent. Not always great, but consistently upper mid table. And Besides Ron, yes, Whitmarsh was ""technically"" principal for a lot of time (Wiki says since 2009), but was he? We all know Ron still ran the show until at least 2017. And then, boom, modern day, post 2017, post Ron, we get Seidl, who is an engineer, and continues the course of consistency, but arguably drives the ship in the wrong direction because of a lack of spark. AND NOW, finally, we're at Zak and Stella, who, I would argue, co-run things. Zak is a hothead, racer, American, talks shit, swings big. Stella is literally a doctor of engineering. I'm convinced \*they\* are why McLaren are so strong right now--it's the best of both worlds. I believe I even have heard Zak talking about it, and the whole Papaya Rules nonsense feeds into it. They are embracing the incestuous relationship of racing driver AND engineer, and succeeding big time because of it. Take notes, other teams! I don't care for McLaren at all, but I am wildly interested in their newfound glory, in part for this reason. 

  
Conclusion: I think I'm on to something. Engineers seem to be more consistent long term, and have a better history of ""righting a ship"", but also not making things better. Racing drivers, however, do seem to be a wild card, and seem to really get things fired up and win silverware pretty regularly, but also have a high record of burning out and crashing hard. Right? 

Anyhow, Thanks for reading, if you did! I'd love to see if anyone else is ""Charlie Day Pepe Silvia"" about this like I am, so we can chat about it. ","['> Otmar drove Force India, Racing Point, and Aston Martin to perfect mediocrity\n\nAre you fucking serious. Force India, with Otmar in charge, were consistently punching above their weight.

But that would fit Briatore neatly in that entrepreneur bracket, rather than being outside it. \n\nSo it seems to track now that engineers are better at getting results, as it's more an exercise in optimising within the cost cap than it is an entrepreneurial exercise in generating the most income, where a bigger budget used to get you a faster car. \n\nAnd on that point, in reference to your quote below, Otmar did very well to get the team to perform brilliantly with what they had, with the best metric on championship points gained per dollar spent, outperforming the top teams by a substantial margin. \n\n> Otmar drove Force India, Racing Point, and Aston Martin to perfect mediocrity."", ""Horner, who was TP for 20 years and had two periods of sustained success, did not suddenly become the problem because over 20 years earlier he'd been a mediocre racing driver outside the top series.\n\n\nToro Rosso also won a race before Red Bull did."", 'I mean, yes, you are right.

1no0vla,I think the 10 second penalty for Albon shows a deeper problem of the current stewarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1no0vla/i_think_the_10_second_penalty_for_albon_shows_a/,2025-09-22, Discussion,"I think this incident highlights the problems of the recent limit on penalties. Only handing out 5 or 10-second penalties for the vast majority of incidents means that incidents like this, which cost Colapinto 25+ seconds, kind of make it worth it (obviously not really, as it also costs Albon and penalty points). Introducing 15-second penalties, and actually using drive-throughs and stop-and-go's. 

The current stewarding process needs fixing in general. I think a selection of professional stewards is needed, but even stuff like this shows they need to go back over a lot of the guidance and really have another look.

They have pretty much sorted the extending track limits, which was a massive talking point a few years ago, by just using the B&W black, which is what it was there for, but wasn't used for ages. It shows that a lot of these stewarding problems do come from the guidance issued to them.","[""Penalties are not meant to repair the damage done, just to disuade drivers from doing certain things. I don't think it was worth it for Albon, even if it was way worse for Colapinto."", 'Bad take. Penalties aren‚Äôt there to vindicate the driver that got crashed into, but to punish the driver that caused the crash. Sucks to be the guy that got crashed into, but giving Albon a 25 second penalty because he cost Colabinto 25 seconds doesn‚Äôt do shit.', ""Stewarding has many more serious problems, I don't think this is a major problem.   \nConsistency and timeliness mostly.\n  \n\nIf you are found to gamble on penalties being worth it penalties do increase and have in the past (ie don't be dumb on radio). Penalties are also already handed out based on result often, so smaller penalties suffice.   \n  \nThe current drivers are also keeping it rather clean, so there is no need to penalize missteps as harshly"", 'I agree with you - Fornaroli on Dunne in the F2 race is another example.\n\nOn Russell at Monaco - it‚Äôs not good race direction IMO if the guidance allows drivers to profit from purposefully taking a penalty, which is entirely why the standard one moved up to ten seconds from five in the first place.', ""I know they are not meant to repair damage; it's more about how I can see this alongside other incidents labelled as 10-second penalties, which are not on the same level.\n\nIf you hand out 5-second penalties for minor incidents and 10-second penalties for everything besides that, then worse incidents are dealt with the same.\n\nIf drivers know that no matter what moves they do, the worst they will get is a 10-second penalty, things like Russell's chicane cutting at Monaco will become more and more common (I know he got a drive-through). \n\nMax got a 10-second penalty for the incident in Spain, which was a more serious incident than this by Albon, but I would also say this was a more major incident than quite a lot of the 10-second penalties handed out.\n\nAll of them exist on a scale, and not using the entire scale of penalties to reflect the seriousness of incidents seems like something that will come to cause a major problem eventually."", ""I wasn't saying he deserved a 25-second penalty; I'm more commenting on the fact that the scale of penalties the stewards are handing out does not show the difference in incidents across the calendar."", ""It's not as big as the other problems, and yes the current crop have been quite clean. But it's more about the fact the guidance handed to stewards seems to basically say the vast majority of incidents are 10 second penalties and unless you do something like Russell at Monaco which is a very very serious incident."", 'But even in your own example, the driver who egregiously cut a corner did get a harsher penalty than 10s.
