The employee who accuses him of inappropriate behavior is going to the British employment court. This is reported by De Telegraaf. In the meantime, English media are not allowed to report on the case.\n\n\n\nThe 51-year-old Horner was acquitted after an internal investigation by the Formula 1 racing team. The case came to light in early February 2024. At the end of that month, it was announced that he could stay on as team boss, after completion of the investigation. The female employee appealed, but Horner was acquitted again. The Briton has been team boss of Red Bull Racing since 2005.\n\n\n\nAccording to De Telegraaf, the case will come before the employment court in January 2026. Conflicts between employers and employees are dealt with there. Ban on English media\n\n\n\nIt is striking that the English media have not reported on the case since April last year, while they were eager to do so before. A Reporting Restriction Order (RRO) has been issued in England, which means that all domestic media are not allowed to report on developments in the case.\n\nA year after \'the email\'\n\n\n\nA year ago, on 29 February, around 150 journalists received an email from an anonymous email address during free practice in Bahrain with incriminating documents about Horner. ""I was one of the chosen ones,"" says NOS reporter Louis Dekker.\n\nThis Google Drive document included text and photos that Horner had allegedly sent to the female Red Bull Racing employee in question.\n\n""That same evening I received an email from the law firm that Horner had hired,"" Dekker explains. ""The message was that I was not allowed to use anything from the email, otherwise legal action would be taken. The tone was quite intimidating. I was addressed as the recipient of the email.""\n\nAt the time, the team boss did not want to answer any questions about the matter after the successful opening race in Bahrain, in which Verstappen and then teammate Perez scored a \'1-2\'. ""He blamed it on a private situation and only wanted to answer questions about the racing. He even gave compliments when a journalist asked a question about the sporting situation on the track after a while.""\n\n""During the past season, the British media asked fewer and fewer questions about the incident and eventually it went quiet,"" Dekker concludes.', ""Surprising that it will take until January for the case to be heard, effectively making it 2 years since the story initially broke. Not giving an opinion on the case either way as we don't have the same evidence as those investigating do. Would be damning for Red Bull if they do have to dismiss Horner, given the timeframe, but would speak volumes of his importance within the team, especially with the brain-drain they've experienced of late"", ""People should be aware that the claim documents will become available if this proceeds to a public hearing (or before a final hearing) so you'll get to see what the employee is specifically alleging and how Horner intends to defend those claims."", 'I sent you my coco pops, plz respond.', 'Proud of Dutch journalists not letting this go.

What are some races do you think which fit into this criteria?

The 2010 Abu Dhabi GP might be one certain example. While there was a legendary 4-way championship going on, the on track action was terrible. Combine the fact that this was before DRS was a thing, and it was pretty much evident that the only way you could get over someone was through pitting.

However people remember it for being the only 4-way title decider and it's often overlooked that the actual race wasn't as good.

What other races can be put here?

I am a long-time racing fan (the first F1 season I followed was 1994, yet in my childhood) and a great lover of history, my other passion. Soon, I became an avid reader of both and somebody who had always wanted to explore the rich past of motor sport. Later, I started doing serious research and writing.

Are there more history enthusiasts? I'd love to discuss their interests and know any communities where it's possible to deepen my knowledge and also contact with more racing-related people, as well as understand what the target audience expects to read in an every-changing world (I confess I'm not too keen on the digital side of things).
