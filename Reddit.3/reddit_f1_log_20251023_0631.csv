1odel9t,Norris is a particular bad starter: the numbers,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odel9t/norris_is_a_particular_bad_starter_the_numbers/,2025-10-22, Discussion,"https://preview.redd.it/67gqcyy45pwf1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=19074f8c188fdf5639e61217cb9199d328c08e0c

When Norris starts from the front two rows he loses an average of 0.65 positions, the worst among top drivers in recent memory. He’s also the most likely to lose positions (40% of races vs Max at 16%) and the least likely to gain (10% of races, vs Max at 28%).

Note that this analysis only considers starts from the front two rows, which naturally biases the results toward losses (since there’s more room to move backward than forward). Even so Max still manages to gain positions on average. Alonso And Leclerc also perform strongly across these metrics.

**Methodology:**

* \~15 years of data analyzed
* Only races where the driver started in the front two rows
* Lap-1 position changes capped at ±4 to limit the impact of outliers

Edit: [updated](https://i.imgur.com/EGQQaUO.png) with data back to '96. Mark Webber hahahaha! Also, per /u/[Ger\_Oktoberfe](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ger_Oktoberfest/)st's  [suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odel9t/comment/nkubqpp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I added a position delta relative to the average, which broadly tells a similar story. Lastly, data sourced from the [jolpica-F1](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1) API.","['Russell\'s comments after COTA were amusing - he was banking on Norris doing the sensible thing at the start. Instead Lando did Lando things and it blew up in George\'s face.\n\n*""I made a good start. Max covered Lando. I expected Lando to go on the outside to cover Charles, so I stayed on the inside but Lando didn\'t move across. He got overtaken and I got boxed in and got overtaken by Oscar and Lewis.""*', 'i think on F1TV they said that 3 times he lost position this season when P3 started on softs', ""I don't think it’s so much his reaction time to the start itself but his general risk aversion wheel to wheel in t1 and the way he preps the tires. One of Lando’s biggest strengths is his ability to preserve the tires over race stints. This probably requires him to be gentle with them early and they’re probably running cooler than they should at the start of the race."", 'Great data analysis,  I love stuff like this!\n\nWould it be possible to add some columns where you correct this for starting position? \n\nFor example from pole position,  there will definitely be an average loss, if you consider all races over the same period.\n\nSo if the average loss from position P1 is -0.3  you can correct all starts from p1. Same for p2 p3 p4', 'This is a very interesting analysis, but I think your math could be improved. The problem here is that it\'s a lot harder to go forward from 1st than it is to go forward from 4th. That\'s skews the data against people who get pole a lot. Having only the first 4 start rows also means you have very little data on most of the mid-field.\n\nMy suggestion: First, calculate the average position-after-one-lap for each starting position. Let\'s borrow from golf and call this ""par"". So for pole is probably like 1.5 or so, while for 10th it\'s probably very close to 10. Then just compare each driver\'s start with what is par, and get your average from that.\n\nWould allow you to do all drivers and all starting positions, and probably give a more accurate result.', 'He’s also quite poor at safety car restarts. He gets caught sleeping a lot.', 'Alonso and Max in another level... But the next one is Perez.', ""Question, could you separate it by years?

I was wondering if he's made any improvements this year and if there's any variability in each year or is it consistent?\n\nObviously the further back you go the less data you have but I still think it would be interesting."", ""I'd say Webber was an even worse starter as a front runner, but apart from him yeah...""]",1409,248,0.94,1409,236,236,145,5,0.0,145

Tsunoda hasn’t really been helping Verstappen or Red Bull strategically this season – there’s been no teamwork when it could’ve mattered.

There’s literally nothing to lose.

It could actually be a win-win situation:
1.	Talent evaluation: Red Bull gets to see how Hadjar performs under real race pressure.
2.	Strategic upside: A hungry rookie might be able to snatch a point or two from McLaren. 
","['No', ""Let's not forget that Tsunoda performed fine in the Racing Bulls too. Qualified p5 in Australia and was in Q3 in both the Sprint and 'main' Qualifying.  Lawson also did poorly in his first 2 races in the RBR, but is also doing well in the Racing Bulls - that car is fast and easy to drive.\n\nNo point in running Hadjar's confidence, putting him under more pressure (considering he is supposed to help Verstappen) and I don't think he will be that much of an upgrade. \n\nAlso, considering that Honda paid for Tsunoda to be in that seat.... Not happening. Yuki will be leaving RBR this year, I don't see a demotion saving him, they would probably rather keep Lawson.

To shatter Isack's confidence before he has a real chance?"", 'No. It’s already insanely hard to learn the car. Let alone for a rookie. Let alone with 5 races left on the calendar. It’s not worth potentially floundering Hadjar for a couple more points which they aren’t guaranteed. \n\nDon’t forget that Yuki probably would be doing much better if he was in the VCARB instead of the RB21. I think out of all the options Red Bull had, promoting Yuki was the best option for this year. If you look at Checo’s form at the end of 2024 it’s very similar to Yuki’s performance save for a few outliers. It was mostly 10ths or lower or DNFs with a few decent positions spattered about. However Checo was riding the wave down on the rb20 and Tsunoda has been riding the wave in the trough and is on the way up so we’ll see how it plays out.', ""Yeah absolutely.
