1p6jhj2,Bearman's Performance where HTB is Allowed/Banned: A logistic regression model,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6jhj2/bearmans_performance_where_htb_is_allowedbanned_a/,2025-11-25, Statistics,"Welcome to unserious stats with me, Woakula! With 2 days before Thanksgiving, I’m alone in the office and have just enough time to entertain myself with mindless nonsense before I go to lunch. Anyways I was intrigued by the table about Bearman’s performance where Hormone Treated Beef (HTB) is/is not restricted originally created by u/_StarDust_0. I figured it’d be fun to run it through a logistical analysis to see if we can find anything interesting.

First off, I suppose I need to answer what is logistical analysis? Well, logistic regression/analysis is a method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a binary outcome. It predicts the probability of an outcome occurring which is represented as a 0/1 or a no/yes in this the case a top 10 finish.

Here is the data courtesy of u/_StarDust_0, if you find errors here take it up with them, I just copied it without verifying the accuracy, as any good data scientist should.

https://preview.redd.it/9l15n3ffxf3g1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9512a9aadbff9f8621856a5cd0629d245488f7e

  
Here are our variables:

1.      Outcome variable is the race result (which I divided into top 10 finishes (0/1 or no/yes))

2.      Independent variable is the approved status of Hormone Treated Beef (0/1 or banned/allowed)

**Our question is: Does the approval status of Hormone Treated Beef increase the probability of Bearman finishing top 10?**

My 5 lines of code in R:

>`model <- glm(race_top10 ~ HTB_numeric,`

>`data = f1_bearman,`

>`family = binomial(link = ""logit""))`

>`exp(coef(model))`

>`summary(model)`

The line starting with model is our logistic regression model

Exp(cof(model)) converts the logistic odds-coefficient created in the previous step into an odds ratio which is more interpretable.

Summary(model) is our output.

https://preview.redd.it/h9pgwp5oxf3g1.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=381e00544bc049cdd2588935852879333df1e57c

**Interpretation:**

Let’s take a look at our exp(coef(model)) line:

The intercept is 0.20. this is the odds of a top 10 finish when HTB is banned. We do need to convert this odds to a probability:

Probability = odds / (1+odds)

Probability = 0.2/(1+0.2) = 0.167 or 16.7%

So when HTB is banned, there is a 16.7% chance of Bearman finishing the race in a top 10 position.

HOWEVER, when HTB if allowed the odds are multiplied by 11.667

New odds = 0.2 x 11.667 = 2.33

Converting to probability: 2.33/(1+2.33) = .70 or 70%

Therefore, When HTB is allowed Bearman has a 70% chance of scoring a top 10 finish. A whopping 53.3% increase compared to regions where HTB is banned. Get our boy some HTB!

**What does the summary(model) line tell us?**

Well our coefficient of 2.4567 tells us that we have a positive direction (when HTB is allowed the log-odds increase) we converted these log odds to probability in the previous step.

The p value (Pr(>|z|)) tells us if the relationship is statistically significant. In this case we have a p-value of 0.0179. This tells us there is a 1.79% probability of observing a relationship this strong (or stronger) between HTB approval status and a top 10 race finish for Beaman. This means the relationship is unlikely to be due to random chance alone (technically lol) We have ""evidence"" that HTB is a genuine predictor of a top 10 race finish.

**But what about the confidence interval?** 

Let's run a 6th line of code:

`exp(confint(model))`

this line calculates the confidence interval for our odds ratio which was calculated in step 2. 

https://preview.redd.it/xqarmy01yf3g1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=085b69031badcbaf47394b003dd4d429cb09ff54

Look at the HTB\_numeric line, the lower and upper bounds are massive. Way too big to actually be useful in the real world, but for the laughs let's convert them to a probability anyways

Probability lower bound: 1.77/(1+1.77) = .6389 or 63.89%

Probability upper bound: 115.82/(1+115.82) = .9914 or 99.14%

So we are 95% confident that the true probability of HTB affecting a top 10 finish from Bearman lies somewhere between 63.89% and 99.14%. With such a large window there is a lot of uncertainty in our model. 

Let’s conveniently forget that for this to be real we need to come up with a plausible reason this relationship exists. I hypothesize that HTB is actually a performance enhancing substance that only affects our GOAT Ollie Bearman. When he races in countries where HTB is allowed he eats a big steak allowing him to digest all the drugs (cause that’s how this works in my universe). He shows up on race day and bam! An increased chance at a top 10 finish! Why isn’t his team bringing HTB with them everywhere for the performance gainz? Well idk, maybe a freezer it too expensive…..

So as I walk out the door in search of a sandwich shop which will sell me performance enhancing HTB I leave you with one final question? What wacky casual effect mechanism do you think connects HTB to Bearman's top 10 performance?","['HTB being banned (and TiO2) correlates with Europe correlates with F2 tracks correlates with ""this driver\'s most recent experience with this track was the notoriously unpredictable & difficult to drive 2024 Prema""', 'This is what I pay Internet for.\nI sucked at statistics in college, but by understanding the basics, the post gets more hilarious with each conclusion.', 'Reddit and running jokes into the ground, a love story', 'The wacky casual variable is that the trenbolone in the beef is a PED.\n\nThere is absolutely no good explanation (ignore europe)', 'A significant finding by logistic regression is kind of impressive lol (almost more so than the fact that you, a self-proclaimed statistician, did this work for free..).

If the model had used Alonso or Hamilton's data, it might have been a closer to having enough statistical power.\n\nSecondly, the model specification does not explictly account for Bearman starting in the top ten, despite the fact the data is there. One might argue that if any driver starts in the top ten, they are more *likely* to finish in the top ten. Thus, maybe interaction terms with qualy result, or with qualy\\_top10, could have been included, or even used as a random effect.\n\nThirdly, the model assumes that all tracks are equal. Track should have been included as a random effect to account for this.\n\nFourth, the model does not account for Bearman's exposure to being an F1 driver, and the car:  the model assumes he is no better at driving at race 22 as he was at race 1 (despite having done thsounds of km's in the car between the two datapoints).\n\nOf course, adding random effects and interaction terms probably wouldn't have producd any significance at all, due to the small sample size."", 'Finally a solid statistical analysis!', 'I’m not a math girl so this made zero sense to me.

In the ’86, Nigel led with 70 points, followed by Nelson on 60 and Alain on 59. Right now, Lando has 390 points, with Oscar and Max both on 366. Considering the points systems of each era, the trends look quite similar.

In the ’86, the title fight was between the two Williams drivers, who were competing with the constructors’ championship-winning team, and Alain, the defending champion driving a McLaren that was regarded as relatively uncompetitive. This year shows a similar pattern as well, with McLaren’s two drivers battling against the defending champion, Max.

In the end, Alain, sitting in third like Max currently, went on to successfully defend his title against Williams. Will Max be able to do what Alain did in ’86? What are your thoughts?

1p6bcc3,[OC] Probability Distribution of 2025 Final Championship Points: Verstappen vs. Norris (Qatar Sprint to Abu Dhabi),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6bcc3/oc_probability_distribution_of_2025_final/,2025-11-25, Statistics,"I’ve been playing around with the points permutations for the final three races of the season and built a probability distribution for Verstappen vs Norris from the Qatar Sprint to Abu Dhabi.

# Analysis

* Each remaining race gives a range of possible points for each driver (0 to 25 for a race, 0 to 8 for a sprint).
* I treated every finishing position as equally likely.
* I generated all combinations of results across the remaining weekends.
* For each combination, I calculated the driver’s total season points.
* Then I created a probability distribution based off all the combinations available.

The chart shows the final distribution for both drivers. The overlap area between the curves represents the chance that Verstappen finishes ahead of Norris in total points.

Verstappen and Piastri are currently on equal points, so Piastri’s distribution is mathematically identical to Verstappen’s. I left it out to keep the chart clear.

# Key Result

The probability Verstappen finishes the season with greater than or equal points than Norris is about 8%.

This isn’t a prediction; driver form, car pace, DNFs, and the usual chaos are not part of this model.","['Why do you use equal distribution of places. This makes no sense.

Verstappen got a completely fresh power unit in Brazil basically a brand-new engine with almost zero mileage. Meanwhile both McLaren drivers are still running PUs that have been in the car since Spa, with *multiple* race weekends, practice sessions and quali sessions on them.

These engines are way past the point where teams would normally consider swapping them, but McLaren can’t do that anymore without taking massive grid penalties.

Isn’t this a serious reliability risk for the last two races?
