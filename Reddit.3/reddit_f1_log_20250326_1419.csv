1jk29q7,How bad was 2019 Gasly compared to Lawson now?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jk29q7/how_bad_was_2019_gasly_compared_to_lawson_now/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"2019 Gasly scored just 63 points in his 12 races at Red Bull, with a highest finish of 4th. It is also possible that he complained about the car and that annoyed people within Red Bull. Lawson on the other hand has been out in Q1 twice in two races, 0 points and is constantly getting stuck behind backmarkers. So I'd say 2019 Gasly was significantly better than Liam Lawson and Liam was put up too soon, meaning he has performed like this.","['The more interesting question is what happened to Albon who started relatively strong, especially if you compare him to Liam.\xa0He scored 76 points during his nine races in 2019 at Red Bull, compared to 97 for Verstappen and won the Rookie of the Year award. In 2020 he was doing ok but got in too many accidents(?), lost confidence and things went to pot.', ""Looking at points is misleadimg because the field spread was so much higher in 2019.\n\n\nAs an example:\xa0\n\n\nIn China in 2019, Gasly qualified 1.4s off Bottas's pole time. This still got him P6.\n\n\nThat same gap to pole in 2025 would get you scraping in to P17.\n\n\nIn 2019 the slowest Quali time in China (set by Kubica in that godawful Williams) was over 3.7s off the pole time.\n\n\nLawson's P20 in China was only 1.533s off pole. Yes, the car is different, but you get the idea. 1.5s from P1 to P20 is incredibly low."", 'Gasly argued with Newey his car was wrong of course he was fired', ""He was consistently in the points and in hindsight he wasn't as bad, but the benchmark at that point was Ricciardo and the expectation was to match Verstappen.\n\nNow years later Max isn't just a feisty young driver with a few wins anymore but a veteran 4 time world champion, and after him, Albon, Perez and Lawson the expectation has changed, and Gasly would those performances today would be more acceptable I think."", 'Gasly got points but he was miles away from the front. The field was a lot more spread out and Gasly was nowhere near his team mate. In his 12 races he had 2 DNFs, finished a lap down 5 times, was almost a lap down 2 times. Performances like that in the 2025 field would be on a par with Lawson', ""2025 and there's not more than a second between all 10 teams (maybe 9 sorry Sauber)\n\nWhat was the average spread between teams in 2019? \n\nYup, he's failed in that seat, big time. But he's actually been setup to fail in my opinion. \n\nHe's had F-All chance to practice or test and the car looks like it's the hardest to drive yet. \n\nWill be interesting to see how Yuki goes in the RB and how Liam goes back in the VCARB"", ""People forget that in 2018 and 2019 (probably 2017, can't remember) there was a huge gap between Top 3 Teams (Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull) and rest of the field. It was pretty much impossible for a non Top 3 car to finish inside the Top 6 without a Top 3 car having a DNF or problem.\n\nLook at Austria 2019: Top 5 is within 22 seconds but P6 is already a lap down down, but gasly finished P7 in a Top car.\n\nLook at China 2019: Top 5 is within 31 seconds, then there is Gasly in P6 another minute down.\n\nTHIS is why Gasly got replaced, not the absolute number of points, you can't compare it. The field is much much much closer today.\n\nAnother stat: in 2019 before Gasly got replaced all other 5 people in the Top 3 cars combined had **3** finishes outside the Top 5. Hamilton had a 1+ minute pitstop in Germany, Vettel had a collision and penalty in Silverstone, and Bottas had a collision and damage in Hungary. Gasly alone finished 6(!) times outside the Top 6 in 12 races."", 'Lawson had limited testing, limited practice at Australia and hadn’t driven the track before. He then went off in the wet on dry tires.\n\nHe hasn’t driven china either and had an hour’s practice before going straight into a qualifying session. It shouldn’t be surprising that a driver is struggling under those conditions and it’s a bit weird they didn’t at least give him this next race where he is very familiar with the track', 'What is the point of this comparison when there is a six year and one major regulation change between the two cars.']",656,196,0.87,656,180,180,46,6,0.0,46
