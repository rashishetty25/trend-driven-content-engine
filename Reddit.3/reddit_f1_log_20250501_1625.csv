All changes in the document are in pink and you are encouraged to read it yourself.

* For races or sprint races which start behind the Safety Car the maximum total race time of 3 hours (1.5 hours for sprints) will commence once the green lights on the start gantry are illuminated to signal the safety car will leave the grid rather than the scheduled race start time.            
* The race director can under their sole discretion award an exception to the Restricted Period One for all Competitors should an official supplier fail to deliver their services promptly for the preparation of a competition in the period 12 hours prior to the start of Restricted Period One. This exception will not count as one of the 4 permitted exceptions.          
* There is now a greater clarification to the meaning of yellow flags which is in accordance with and supplementary to Appendix H of the ISC:            
   * Single Waved Yellow Flag: Any driver passing through a waved yellow flag marshalling sector must reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction. In order for the stewards to be satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements they are expected to have braked earlier and/or discernibly reduced speed in the relevant marshalling sector.             
   * Double Waved Yellow Flag: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector must reduce speed significantly and be prepared to change direction or stop. In order for the stewards to be satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements it must be clear that the driver has not attempted to set a meaningful lap time on the relevant lap. Furthermore, during a sprint qualifying or qualifying session, any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector will have that lap time deleted.        
   * Double Waved Yellow Flag during a Safety Car or Virtual Safety Car Period: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector during a safety car or virtual safety car period, in addition to the requirements of b), must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU in each marshalling sector concerned.           
* There is now an exception for Monaco where they will an additional set of wet weather tyres during the competition (From 2 to 3 sets).         
* If a Heat Hazard has been declared and the driver has elected not to wear any of the personal cooling equipment, the 0.5kg of ballast in the cockpit may be fitted. This will only take place after the mass has been validated by the FIA Technical Delegate and under their supervision.       
* When cars which are required to start the race from the pit lane return to the pit lane having done the formation lap, they must proceed to pit exit at a constant speed and with constant throttle.         
* There is now a clarification that during the start procedure (For both standing and rolling starts) the pit exit will indeed be closed and competitors starting from pitlane may join the race one the last car has passed pit exit and the pit exit is opened.          
* Clarification that during Safety Cars, a green light on the SC will be used to indicate for either cars to overtake the SC to establish the order or for lapped cars to overtake.        
* Whilst lapped cars are proceeding around the circuit to join the queue behind the SC, at the sole discretion of the race director, the pit lane exit may be closed when the SC and queue are approaching and passing the pit lane exit.       
* When resuming a suspended race, the decision for a standing or rolling start will now be sent to all competitors after the two minutes point prior to the resumption.             
* In the case of a standing restart and at the sole discretion of the race director, the safety car may remain in pit lane and a message will be sent to all competitors ‚ÄúSAFETY CAR WILL REMAIN IN THE PIT LANE‚Äù. When the pit exit is opened all cars should leave the pit lane and proceed to the grid, the first car in line dictates the pace.","['The Financial Regulations were also updated with [the only change being on the last page with the inclusion of a row for ""New Entrant"" in the table detailing Capital Expenditure limits.](https://i.imgur.com/mR2OXXm.jpeg)', ""I still think it's crazy that there is such ambiguity surrounding yellow flags.\n\n>must reduce speed significantly and be prepared to change direction or stop\n\nDrivers are off the hook if they go from 350km/h to 340km/h, what meaningful difference does that make?

I‚Äôd seen him race at Le Mans a few times, and he was no muppet paying for a seat.

Later in 1994 I went to Le Mans and one of the SARD Toyotas had four drivers‚Äô names painted next to the door, but only three drivers at the circuit; Eddie Irvine, Jeff Krosnoff and Mauro Martini. This is the car that Roland was supposed to have been driving.\n\n90 minutes from the end of the race it was leading, when it slowed and stopped just past me on the pit straight with a broken gear linkage. Krosnoff got out of the car, went around the back and manually selected third gear. He then set off on a slow lap of the 9 mile circuit before pitting for the linkage to be replaced. The car lost 13 minutes and dropped back to third\xa0place, 15 seconds behind the second placed car. Irvine cut this lead at a rate of three seconds per lap, and I‚Äôve never seen so many people willing a car to go faster.

Along with some high-flyers, some problem children have already emerged. One of them is Lewis Hamilton. Even though his move to Ferrari was supposed to change everything.**\n\n> Revitalized. This is how Lewis Hamilton described his physical and mental state before the season opener in Melbourne in mid-March. Everyone who watched the record Formula 1 winner on television and in person sensed the Englishman\'s excitement about the new challenge. After twelve years in the Mercedes outfit, Hamilton had changed colors and joined the legendary Ferrari brand.\n\n> Few in the paddock could have imagined that Hamilton would seek a new challenge. The 40-year-old acted on a famous quote from Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize winner Fridtjof Nansen, who once said: ""We need courage to throw away the old clothes that have seen their best."" In Hamilton\'s opinion, Mercedes had seen their best days.\n\n> After disappointing seasons in 2022 and 2023, he decided to switch to Ferrari even before the start of the season last year. Although Hamilton won two more races for Mercedes, the man from Stevenage secretly hoped that the Ferrari engineers would build him a title-capable car.\n\n> **Ferrari slips.**\nThis hope was not unfounded. The Scuderia scored the most points of all Formula 1 teams in the second half of the 2024 season and missed the Constructors\' World Championship title by just 14 points. The goal for this season was clear: After the last title in 2008, the team wanted to finally bring a World Championship trophy back to Maranello. However, after five races, they are far from that. Ferrari, in fourth place, is 110 points behind leader McLaren. Hamilton himself has just 31 points, while teammate Charles Leclerc has 47. The energetic and revitalized Lewis Hamilton is already pass√© after five Grands Prix.\n\n> Even worse, however, were the star\'s statements following the Saudi Arabian GP. While Leclerc secured Ferrari\'s first podium of the season with P3, the seven-time world champion finished seventh, nearly 31 seconds behind the sister car. ""I lacked grip. I was fighting with the car in every corner. Everything I tried didn\'t work.""\n\n> It seems as if Hamilton is falling back into old habits at Ferrari. Even during his time at Mercedes, he was known as a driver who liked to have his car modified several times over the course of a weekend. Instead of concentrating on fine-tuning the setup, Hamilton got lost in the woods. The 105-time GP winner was caught off guard at the second race of the season in China. After his sprint victory ‚Äì the highlight of the season so far ‚Äì the superstar had been a force to be reckoned with again. But then the Ferrari technicians took a look at the SF-25. The disappointing qualifying was followed by an even weaker race, which ultimately ended in a disqualification. The skid blocks on the underbody were below the minimum value of nine millimeters.\n\n> **Too many setup changes?**\nTwo weeks later, Hamilton defended himself in Japan when asked about the changes to the car: ""What people from the outside don\'t see at all is that minimal changes have massive effects. In Shanghai, we only changed the setup very slightly, and the car was immediately different."" But things didn\'t improve in Suzuka, with P7. Hamilton showed a small sign of life with decent pace and fifth place in Bahrain. However, he messed up qualifying there. He made the same mistake in Jeddah. He couldn\'t keep up with his teammate Leclerc for a single fast lap.\n\n> The former regular world champion continues to blame the car\'s lack of comfort. ""I didn\'t feel comfortable for a second in Jeddah."" He took the blame himself. ""The car clearly has potential. Charles clearly demonstrated that with his podium finish. So I can\'t say it\'s the car\'s fault,"" he said after the defeat.\n\n> **Vasseur defends his superstar.**\nHamilton is already resorting to gallows humor. Regarding possible changes, he said laconically: ""The car still feels alien. I might need a brain transplant."" It won\'t come to that. He\'s assured of the support of his team boss, Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur. After Jeddah, the Frenchman took a protective stance against his transfer coup and defended it to journalists. ""I fully support Lewis. We will try to find the reasons for the problems and find solutions.""\n\n> The 56-year-old downplayed the hopeful\'s poor form. ""It\'s not dramatic. We\'ve completed five races so far. I know you want the big headlines; Fred said this and Fred said that."" Vasseur is aware that special attention is being paid to Ferrari and Hamilton. However, the performances of both sides so far have been disappointing. The demands are higher than top-10 results.\n\n> The Ferrari team boss wants to keep a cool head. ""We have to stay calm. For us as a team, we have to work step by step. Last year, it paid off that we continually improved in the hundredths range. We have to maintain this attitude."" There are no quick fixes in sight. Fans of Hamilton and Ferrari will probably have to show some patience.', ""is Lewis struggling? yes, but with all the headlines about it you'd think the guy was getting knocked out in Q1 and Q2"", '‚ÄòSeason is now 5 races old.‚Äô Change to ‚Äòseason is ONLY 5 races old‚Äô. \n\nIf anyone was expecting Hamilton to waltz into Ferrari and start getting wins straight away, they would have been blinkered to say the least. It‚Äôs a crazy world where he can get a sprint pole and sprint win and his results still considered poor - especially as the results of his teammate haven‚Äôt been stellar either. \n\nGive it time, give him the car and then his struggles can be judged.']",0,16,0.4,0,15,15,0,16,0.4,0

Angelelli, a former Formula 3 driver, has disclosed that he had serious reservations about the Opel Vectra assigned as the safety car, citing its inadequate power and braking capabilities for leading Formula 1 cars. He even attempted to replace it with a Porsche 911 but was overruled due to contractual obligations.\n\nDuring the race, the Vectra's performance issues became evident. Its brakes overheated quickly, and it struggled to maintain speeds necessary for the F1 cars to keep their tyres and brakes at optimal temperatures.
