Now that the dust has settled in Monaco, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","['Every year we have the same two day phenomena where Monaco is simultaneously absolutely untouchable and completely useless as a race and it’ll be the same next year.\n\nIn 2023, 2024 and 2025 we’ve had the same ‘Monaco Qualifying is the best session of the year’ on Saturday to ‘it’s impossible to overtake, scrap it ASAP’ on Sunday.\n\nTruly the pinnacle of the paradox that is the average Formula 1 fan.', ""The drone shot looking straight down on the track was pretty cool, could use that at some other races too.\n\nI don't really remember anything else."", 'Honestly I’ve not seen drivers THIS openly critical of a race before. The 2 stopper was such a bad idea and made for a horrendous race. I 100% agree with Carlos and George.', 'The one thing I did like about the race was the Birds Eye view drone shot. That was actually really cool and I hope they do that type of shot in more races. That’s how they should use drones if they do plan on using it more\n\nBut I still think they should either scrap or rotate Monaco with Spa since they’ve already confirmed that’s a thing. Fundamentally cars can’t overtake here and mandating more pit stops won’t fix it. The only stakeholders who like are the sponsors, winner of the race, organisers of the race and the VIPs who attend\n\nEveryone knows it’s garbage for racing. Don’t forget this is a race with a significantly shorter total distance than that’s required as well. Imagine adding 14 extra laps to it if it didn’t get an exemption for the race distance\n\nUnless they decide to race in go karts or everyone has an allocation of water balloons they can use', 'I think if we’re insisting on keeping Monaco then it should be considered making it some sort of exhibition weekend. It’s not competitive at all and continuing to pretend that it is makes the sport look stupid.\n\nMaybe you could do a series of time trials or something and give points for that, but as it’s more about the “spectacle” I’d be alright with just running a series of exhibition events to show off the cars or a race in 1950s style cars or something to preserve the history.', ""Clearly the 2 pitstops experiment didn't work. It would've worked if they also penalized teams for deliberately driving slow and holding everyone back. Russell exposed this flaw and was punished with a drive thru for it."", 'It’s gonna be a hot take but I actually enjoyed the race.\n\nI liked how, compared to other races in Monaco, there was always something going on. This was because of the pit stop rule and how there was always someone trying to undercut, overcut or hold up someone.\xa0 Speaking of, unlike many I wanst offended by all the shenanigans of cars holding each other up. On the contrary it was a fun aspect of the race that you never usually see.\xa0\n\nThere was also a smidgen of collision drama and on a few ocassions I was sure that we were getting a safety car.\xa0\n\nAnd I loved Verstappen’s holding up of Norris and the top three all closing up beside each other in the last 15-20 laps. Yes Leclerc didnt make a move but the fact he was close enough to capitalise on any mistakes was super tense and exciting in my eyes.\xa0\n\nI also loved how some of the usual front runners like Mercedes were nowhere and instead we had the likes of Hadjar having the best F1 result of his life.\xa0\n\nIve said it before, do I want to see 24 races like this a year? No defo not. Do I like seeing it once a year? Absolutely.\xa0\n\nIm not saying you had to enjoy it. I understand why you didn’t. But personally, I had a fun time watching that race.\n\n\xa0', 'Listening to the F1 nation podcast they mentioned there were 4 proposals by the SAC last December (I could have the exact month wrong) on changes for Monaco. Teams voted and picked the mandatory 2-stop option. So, teams only have themselves to blame if they are unhappy with how it turned out. Also, I’m curious if there is any way to read what the other 3 proposals were. \n\nAnd for all the criticism of how things turned out I’m not sure the regular 1-stop would have altered the results much at all. It’s clear drivers can create any kind of gap they want at any point and aren’t at risk of getting passed. Doesn’t seem like the number of stops will change any of that. \n\nThere is a universe where with a safety car or red flag this regulation makes a big difference but red flags and safety cars can be just as gimmicky and random at any race. \n\nEveryone just needs to accept Monaco is about Saturday. And it’s clear the vast majority of people around F1 have no desire to eliminate it from the calendar. Just appreciate the racing for what it is. 73 laps around a beautiful place filled with racing history.', ""This is my second year following F1, and I've got to say that I agree with the consensus here - Monaco might be a historic circuit, but it's just not suitable for modern F1. \n\nI do think some of the ideas suggested are interesting, like the idea of a super qualifier over two days or running two races of ten cars that award half points. The problem is that is it really F1 at that point if they have to have a specific, and completely different, format for a single race?"", ""Pretty much everyone agrees that Monaco has the best qualifying of the year and the worst racing of the year. So instead of trying to fix the race with things like 2 mandatory pit stops, why not double down on the part of the weekend everyone actually likes?\n\nI think the Monaco GP should become a time attack event instead of a race. Move FP1+2 to Saturday, skip FP3, and have an extra-long qualifying session in the race's time slot. Use a similar elimination format to normal qualifying sessions (maybe with 5 rounds instead of 3?) and award points using the same system as the races (ie.  25 for pole, 18 for 2nd, etc). The finishing order of the race is mostly determined by qualifying anyway, so this is just cutting out the middleman.""]",20,176,0.75,20,168,168,0,21,-0.030000000000000027,0

The top 8 then enter a knockout style qualifying tournament: 1st from Q2 against 8th, 2nd v 7th etc. One lap each, winner progresses to semi final.

This initiative marks a significant step in the brand\'s ambitious expansion into Formula 1, aiming to field a team in the 2026 season.\n\nA Bold New Direction for Cadillac\n\nCadillac\'s entry into Formula 1 has been a topic of intense speculation and excitement. Officially approved by the FIA in March 2025, the team is set to become the 11th on the F1 grid, joining the ranks of global automotive giants. With a base in Indiana and a technical center in Silverstone, UK, Cadillac is committed to building a ""truly American"" team, with a focus on innovation, engineering excellence, and, notably, American talent. \n\nTo identify potential drivers, Cadillac has turned to the heart of American motorsport: the Indianapolis 500. This iconic race not only attracts the best drivers but also a passionate fanbase, many of whom have aspirations of racing at the highest levels. By engaging with visitors at the Indy 500, Cadillac aims to discover raw talent and untapped potential among the next generation of drivers.\n\nScouting the Speedway\n\nDuring the 109th Indianapolis 500, Cadillac set up interactive booths and hosted talent identification events, inviting fans to showcase their driving skills and racing knowledge. The initiative was designed to be inclusive, offering opportunities for individuals from various backgrounds to participate. Attendees were encouraged to demonstrate their passion for racing, with the hope that some might possess the skills and determination required for a future in Formula 1.\n\n""We\'re looking for individuals who have the drive, both literally and figuratively,"" said Graeme Lowdon, team principal of Cadillac F1. ""The Indy 500 is a celebration of speed and skill, and we believe there are hidden gems among its spectators who could thrive in the world of Formula 1.""\n\nThe Road to Formula 1\n\nWhile the search at the Indy 500 is a novel approach, Cadillac\'s commitment to American drivers is longstanding. IndyCar star Colton Herta has been prominently featured in discussions about potential F1 drivers. Having secured a seat with Andretti Autosport for the 2025 IndyCar season, Herta is on track to meet the FIA\'s superlicence requirements, making him a strong candidate for a seat in the 2026 season.\n\nHowever, Cadillac is not solely focused on established names. The initiative at the Indy 500 underscores the team\'s dedication to discovering new talent. By engaging directly with fans and visitors, Cadillac hopes to identify individuals who may not have had the opportunity to compete at the professional level but possess the innate skills and passion for racing.\n\nA Vision for the Future\n\nCadillac\'s strategy reflects a broader trend in motorsport, where teams are increasingly looking beyond traditional scouting methods to find talent. By tapping into the enthusiasm and passion of racing fans, Cadillac is fostering a more inclusive and diverse pathway into Formula 1.\n\nAs the 2025 Indy 500 concludes, the excitement surrounding Cadillac\'s driver search is palpable. For many fans, the dream of racing at the highest level is no longer confined to the realm of fantasy. With Cadillac\'s innovative approach, the next generation of American F1 drivers may very well be among the thousands of spectators who flocked to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway this May.\n\nFor more information on Cadillac\'s F1 team and the driver recruitment process, visit CadillacF1.com.', 'Its almost like his family name carries a lot of weight in the world of motorsport', ""Mick's PR team is legitimately one of the GOATs.

The ""typical"" greats are often drivers from different areas so it is really hard to compare them equally and not only did the quality of cars in general improved massively but also technical differences like stick-shift to automatic, engines etc. 

Without mentioning any names, what are the attributes a driver needs to have to be your number one or top 5 etc.? 

  
For me it is the circumstances a driver gets and what he makes out of it. There are drivers who have multiple championships with multiple cars and there are drivers who sit in one nearly perfect car and win, but mostly very close of their teammate. 

And currently my view on another driver shifts, because I thought he has the best car, but it seems that either he is an unbelievable driver or no one can use the car, but him. ","['Mostly vibes, and when someone comes with good arguments for another driver, I use my emotional arguments to justify my personal bests.', 'I don’t.

I greatly value drivers being fast without resorting to dirty tactics and bullshit driving, which elevates guys like Hakkinen, Clark, Vettel and Stewart. Anyhow, I fully respect the talent and the raw speed of the Senna, Schumacher, Verstappen class, but I'll never respect the way they drove/drive on track and to me, that disqualifies all of them from the GOAT discussion.

It wasn't interesting to watch and somehow made Monaco even more boring to watch.

But what if drivers had to keep to a minimum lap time throughout each lap? Governed by some metric, which I'm sure wouldn't be too difficult to work out and enforce (drivers would have a delta to follow), which would eradicate this backing up nonsense. Monaco isn't going anywhere. It's too steeped in history and has far too much significance with Formula 1, so I do think it's a good idea to mandate some interesting rules to help improve the racing, even though on-track overtaking is at a minimum/non-existent.

Would there be a reason this couldn't realistically work?

Mandatory two stop, minimum lap times, sprinklers like Bernie suggested, Mario Kart style bananas like Max suggested, etc....I don't think adding more things is going to create good racing. It doesn't change the reality of the track and the size of the cars"", 'The only solution really is changing the layout somehow. Maybe eliminating the chicane and letting them use drs through the tunnel down to a more 90 degree tabac. But that would take a major road project to alter the streets.

1kvon1d,Is Antonelli performing beneath expectations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvon1d/is_antonelli_performing_beneath_expectations/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"This post might bring controversy, but I think young Kimi is performing slightly worse than expected, further overshadowed by all the praise about Hadjar recently. So far he has less than half the points of GR, 0-10 vs GR in race/sprint h2h, and 2-8 in qualifying h2h.

GR is great, and honestly I don’t think race pace, mistakes, (like losing the lead at the sprint) or even crashes are worrying, but it’s the raw pace that he has yet to show. In my understanding, speed is mostly not taught, and most great drivers become competitive in qualifying just about immediately. I think it is slightly concerning that Kimi has mostly struggled with qualifying thus far other than in Miami.

Can anyone who has followed him through his junior career give some input on how we should view his performance thus far?

Edit: after reading some responses, I admit it’s my expectations of him being a generational talent that are too high and not fair. Hopefully he will get plenty of lease at Merc to develop!","[""He's doing fine. 1 crash at Monaco Q1 and a spin in terrible conditions at Melbourne \n\nA pole and top 3 qualifying at miami. Has been unfortunate with SC and strategy \n\nI hope he gets a new deal official by Monza"", 'We’ve seen with most rookies they burn bright and then start to wreck hard.\n\nIt’s important Kimi has a lowkey year to get used to the car, the team and how to race in F1.\n\nOnce you start crashing you’re putting a massive target on your back so as long as he can avoid that he will have had a successful rookie year imo.\n\nLet’s not forget the Mercedes isn’t particularly competitive this year and also GR is constantly underrated as a driver.

It should be obvious that Russell is a far more difficult team mate to match/beat than Lawson."", 'He literally got pole 2 races ago, some people can only remember what happened last race lol', ""He's exceeding my expectations. Russell is a top driver, so for Antonelli to be close to competitive against him as an 18 year old rookie is better than I expected."", '> is the 18 year old rookie underperforming against a seasoned no1 at mercedes who just beat lewis hamilton in the season before?\n\njust give it time. he really is looking strong enough for an 18 year old rookie.', ""There is literally no rookie, no matter how good they are, that'll consistenly match a driver like George Russell in their first year. Piastri also lacked raw speed in his first year and look at him now"", 'No. The only reason you think so is that people constantly underrate George. \n\nThe expectation that Kimi would start beating George come this summer has always been utter bollocks.', ""No.\n\nSince the beginning of the season this is his first crash/incident  (obviously Imola being out of his hands), he is a fast driver and performing as expected in Mercedes.  He also lost the lead to drivers like Piastri, Verstappen, Norris - so not fair to judge on that.\n\nComparing Hadjar & Antonelli's H2H is also not fair, Lawson doesn't even have a full season yet and not on the level of GR who is on his 4th season in Mercedes.""]",0,112,0.19,0,106,106,0,3,0.0,0
