That was actually really cool and I hope they do that type of shot in more races. That‚Äôs how they should use drones if they do plan on using it more\n\nBut I still think they should either scrap or rotate Monaco with Spa since they‚Äôve already confirmed that‚Äôs a thing.

The only stakeholders who like are the sponsors, winner of the race, organisers of the race and the VIPs who attend\n\nEveryone knows it‚Äôs garbage for racing.

Also, I‚Äôm curious if there is any way to read what the other 3 proposals were. \n\nAnd for all the criticism of how things turned out I‚Äôm not sure the regular 1-stop would have altered the results much at all.

The problem is that is it really F1 at that point if they have to have a specific, and completely different, format for a single race?"", ""Pretty much everyone agrees that Monaco has the best qualifying of the year and the worst racing of the year. So instead of trying to fix the race with things like 2 mandatory pit stops, why not double down on the part of the weekend everyone actually likes?\n\nI think the Monaco GP should become a time attack event instead of a race. Move FP1+2 to Saturday, skip FP3, and have an extra-long qualifying session in the race's time slot. Use a similar elimination format to normal qualifying sessions (maybe with 5 rounds instead of 3?) and award points using the same system as the races (ie.  25 for pole, 18 for 2nd, etc).

The top 8 then enter a knockout style qualifying tournament: 1st from Q2 against 8th, 2nd v 7th etc. One lap each, winner progresses to semi final.

This initiative marks a significant step in the brand\'s ambitious expansion into Formula 1, aiming to field a team in the 2026 season.\n\nA Bold New Direction for Cadillac\n\nCadillac\'s entry into Formula 1 has been a topic of intense speculation and excitement. Officially approved by the FIA in March 2025, the team is set to become the 11th on the F1 grid, joining the ranks of global automotive giants. With a base in Indiana and a technical center in Silverstone, UK, Cadillac is committed to building a ""truly American"" team, with a focus on innovation, engineering excellence, and, notably, American talent. \n\nTo identify potential drivers, Cadillac has turned to the heart of American motorsport: the Indianapolis 500. This iconic race not only attracts the best drivers but also a passionate fanbase, many of whom have aspirations of racing at the highest levels. By engaging with visitors at the Indy 500, Cadillac aims to discover raw talent and untapped potential among the next generation of drivers.\n\nScouting the Speedway\n\nDuring the 109th Indianapolis 500, Cadillac set up interactive booths and hosted talent identification events, inviting fans to showcase their driving skills and racing knowledge. The initiative was designed to be inclusive, offering opportunities for individuals from various backgrounds to participate. Attendees were encouraged to demonstrate their passion for racing, with the hope that some might possess the skills and determination required for a future in Formula 1.\n\n""We\'re looking for individuals who have the drive, both literally and figuratively,"" said Graeme Lowdon, team principal of Cadillac F1. ""The Indy 500 is a celebration of speed and skill, and we believe there are hidden gems among its spectators who could thrive in the world of Formula 1.""\n\nThe Road to Formula 1\n\nWhile the search at the Indy 500 is a novel approach, Cadillac\'s commitment to American drivers is longstanding. IndyCar star Colton Herta has been prominently featured in discussions about potential F1 drivers. Having secured a seat with Andretti Autosport for the 2025 IndyCar season, Herta is on track to meet the FIA\'s superlicence requirements, making him a strong candidate for a seat in the 2026 season.\n\nHowever, Cadillac is not solely focused on established names. The initiative at the Indy 500 underscores the team\'s dedication to discovering new talent. By engaging directly with fans and visitors, Cadillac hopes to identify individuals who may not have had the opportunity to compete at the professional level but possess the innate skills and passion for racing.\n\nA Vision for the Future\n\nCadillac\'s strategy reflects a broader trend in motorsport, where teams are increasingly looking beyond traditional scouting methods to find talent. By tapping into the enthusiasm and passion of racing fans, Cadillac is fostering a more inclusive and diverse pathway into Formula 1.\n\nAs the 2025 Indy 500 concludes, the excitement surrounding Cadillac\'s driver search is palpable. For many fans, the dream of racing at the highest level is no longer confined to the realm of fantasy. With Cadillac\'s innovative approach, the next generation of American F1 drivers may very well be among the thousands of spectators who flocked to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway this May.\n\nFor more information on Cadillac\'s F1 team and the driver recruitment process, visit CadillacF1.com.', 'Its almost like his family name carries a lot of weight in the world of motorsport', ""Mick's PR team is legitimately one of the GOATs.

The ""typical"" greats are often drivers from different areas so it is really hard to compare them equally and not only did the quality of cars in general improved massively but also technical differences like stick-shift to automatic, engines etc. 

Without mentioning any names, what are the attributes a driver needs to have to be your number one or top 5 etc.? 

  
For me it is the circumstances a driver gets and what he makes out of it. There are drivers who have multiple championships with multiple cars and there are drivers who sit in one nearly perfect car and win, but mostly very close of their teammate. 

And currently my view on another driver shifts, because I thought he has the best car, but it seems that either he is an unbelievable driver or no one can use the car, but him.

I greatly value drivers being fast without resorting to dirty tactics and bullshit driving, which elevates guys like Hakkinen, Clark, Vettel and Stewart. Anyhow, I fully respect the talent and the raw speed of the Senna, Schumacher, Verstappen class, but I'll never respect the way they drove/drive on track and to me, that disqualifies all of them from the GOAT discussion.

It wasn't interesting to watch and somehow made Monaco even more boring to watch.

But what if drivers had to keep to a minimum lap time throughout each lap? Governed by some metric, which I'm sure wouldn't be too difficult to work out and enforce (drivers would have a delta to follow), which would eradicate this backing up nonsense. Monaco isn't going anywhere. It's too steeped in history and has far too much significance with Formula 1, so I do think it's a good idea to mandate some interesting rules to help improve the racing, even though on-track overtaking is at a minimum/non-existent.

Would there be a reason this couldn't realistically work?

We've also seen drivers/teams take other questionable tactics to win, such as VCARB and Williams holding up the entire track to give their drivers time to pit in Monaco.

1kvon1d,Is Antonelli performing beneath expectations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvon1d/is_antonelli_performing_beneath_expectations/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"This post might bring controversy, but I think young Kimi is performing slightly worse than expected, further overshadowed by all the praise about Hadjar recently. So far he has less than half the points of GR, 0-10 vs GR in race/sprint h2h, and 2-8 in qualifying h2h.

GR is great, and honestly I don‚Äôt think race pace, mistakes, (like losing the lead at the sprint) or even crashes are worrying, but it‚Äôs the raw pace that he has yet to show. In my understanding, speed is mostly not taught, and most great drivers become competitive in qualifying just about immediately. I think it is slightly concerning that Kimi has mostly struggled with qualifying thus far other than in Miami.

Can anyone who has followed him through his junior career give some input on how we should view his performance thus far?

Edit: after reading some responses, I admit it‚Äôs my expectations of him being a generational talent that are too high and not fair. Hopefully he will get plenty of lease at Merc to develop!","[""He's doing fine. 1 crash at Monaco Q1 and a spin in terrible conditions at Melbourne \n\nA pole and top 3 qualifying at miami.

He also lost the lead to drivers like Piastri, Verstappen, Norris - so not fair to judge on that.\n\nComparing Hadjar & Antonelli's H2H is also not fair, Lawson doesn't even have a full season yet and not on the level of GR who is on his 4th season in Mercedes.""]",0,112,0.19,0,106,106,0,3,0.0,0
