McLaren driver Stefan Johansson was flat-out when a deer suddenly ran across the track. With no time to react, Johansson hit the animal at over 270 km/h (170 mph). The impact destroyed the front of his MP4/3, killed the deer instantly, and left Johansson dazed and bruised ‚Äî but incredibly, he escaped serious injury.

He later described it as ""like hitting a concrete wall."" The crash left the car wrecked and Johansson shaken, but after a medical check, he returned to the garage, got in the spare car, and still managed to qualify.

He raced that weekend and finished 7th, just outside the points.

1lj3bnk,Abu Dhabi 2021- could the controversy have been avoided?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lj3bnk/abu_dhabi_2021_could_the_controversy_have_been/,2025-06-24, Discussion,"This is something which I've thought about since that race but never had a chance to talk about or ask others for their views. (for disclosure I am neither a Hamilton or a Verstappen fan). It seems that most of the outrage from the finale was around the fact that Masi decided to only let certain lapped cars overtake the safety car on the penultimate lap, and not all, therefore setting up a last lap dash. Presumably if he had let all the lapped cars overtake, there wouldn't have been enough time for them to get around and the safety car would've needed to be out for another lap meaning that the race would have finished under the safety car.   
Now, if the lapped cars had been able to overtake a lap earlier (all the cars that is) and the safety car still came in on the second last lap setting up a final lap showdown, would that still have been controversial? Alternatively, he could've just let all the lapped cars through on the second last lap and hope the leaders wouldn't get to them.  I know some people will say they couldn't have gotten the incident clear in time, but from the TV stream at the time most of the circuit was already clear, and the safety car could've driven slightly slower to allow for one more racing lap. Given the incredible season that was 2021, I'm sure that everyone who is a fan of racing would have loved for a dramatic final lap rather than a safety car finish (I understand Hamilton fans probably wouldn't as their driver would have most to lose). 

Therefore, assuming that all the lapped cars had been allowed to overtake and a last lap showdown occurred resulting in the same outcome (Verstappen overtaking Hamilton) would there be any controversy? I cannot see how there would as it would've been the same scenario as any other restart. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments as I'm happy to hear others thoughts (please keep it civil) and hopefully I haven't breached any rules by posting this (I read the rules before posting to confirm). ","['Pretty spot on. They should have either let all the cars un-lap themselves, and therefore finish under safety car, or none of the cars un-lap. Just letting the cars between Hamilton and Verstappen un-lap was a dreadful decision. I no longer care who won, but making a decision like that was dreadful.', 'Controversy could have been avoided had the race director followed the rules of the sport, not ignore some to create a last lap drama.\n\nFairest thing if he was going to do anything would have been to red flag it.
