1o9tszf,Max Verstappen may not become WDC this year but he is going to the factor that decides who the WDC will be,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o9tszf/max_verstappen_may_not_become_wdc_this_year_but/,2025-10-18, Discussion,"Verstappen winning the championship is a long shot, but he definitely be the factor that decides whether Oscar / Lando will be WDC this year.  

Given the fact that Red Bull seem to have fixed the problem enough to keep Max close to the McLarens, this is the absolute nightmare scenario to the Papaya Rules Team.  

1. Max already knows that getting WDC is a long shot, so he can go elbows out trying to get the win and be super aggressive in starts while neither Oscar or Lando can afford a DNF.  

2. Because Max is now in the mix, the idea that a McLaren driver can get 7 points swing in a race is no longer possible. It can be as small as 3 points if Max wins to as big as 10 points if Max manages to finish 2nd.  

3. Lando could have closed the gap to Oscar in a significant way in the past 3 races of not for Max. Right now, Max has protected Oscar's lead a bit. On the other hand, with Max in the mix, if Oscar / Lando manages to win with Max in 2nd, they can can a 10 point swing.  

3. Assuming the Red Bull car is now good enough to hang in undercut range in 3rd, if McLarens are in 1-2, who does the team first? If they give priority to the lead driver, the driver in 2nd gets undercut. If they give priority to the 2nd driver to save them from undercut, then 2nd driver gets the better strategy and may even win.  

4. In case of SC / VSC and double stack isn't possible, McLaren pitwall is gonna have trouble deciding which driver to give the pitstop to. McLaren don't do well under pressure where they have to choose between the drivers. This can lead to a lot of surprise turn of events.  

5. Also, the mental pressure that Max brings is going to affect the McLaren drivers. In quali, in race, they don't just have to worry about their own race and strategy, they will also have to worry about Max's.  

I am not definitely saying Max won't win the WDC. He clawed 40 points since summer break to the championship leader and if there is one driver on the grid I trust to achieve this kind of recovery, it's Red Bull + GP + Max combo. However, there isn't enough races left to perform miracles like winning every race without a clear car advantage and/or without any kind of double DNFs from McLarens.   

However, Max can do what he did to make us all say ""Thank god for Max Verstappen"" during Mercedes era: be a menace on track, fight for wins and podiums, do another HAM-VER-BOT rendition, and be a headache to the team that's on top.  

This championship battle just got spicy! 🔥🔥🔥","['Biggest deciding factor will be Mercedes power units blowing up when we look back.

Max being on pace makes him a podium contender all the time, and that’s most likely in the form of victories.\n\nPiastri has been kinda off the pace since Azerbaijan, so not having the swing of 25 x 18 points assured, makes the buffer he created much much more comfortable.', 'Fuck this Max is winning his 5th world title!

I  think its often forgotten but there were some weekends where he was so untouchable it was like watching Michael in his prime agian. \n\nBut Seb just seemed to have a considerably narrower window in terms of car feel where he could actually fully unleash his abilities.

For starters, the race head to head is skewed as such because of Seb's insanely poor luck in races, both in terms of DNFs, contact from other drivers ramming into him, and Aston's horrible strategy gambles. \n\nLooking at 2021 alone which accounts for Seb's losing race h2h overall against Stroll, there are numerous incidents which highlight the misfortune Seb faced. We have him being taken out by Tsunoda in Jeddah, being hit by Raikkonen at Austria, being nearly put into the wall by Stroll in Zandvoort, *actually* being put into the wall by Stroll in Sochi, then being hit by Ocon, Mick and Stroll one after the other in Monza, and the hail mary strategy in Turkey, and to top it off he was shoved off the track to start the race in Qatar. With the exception of Zandvoort, Seb was running ahead of Stroll in *all* these scenarios I just detailed until rotten luck and/or shitty driving by the chumps I mentioned above wrecked his day. \n\nThen there's additional context regarding Stroll. For starters, he's been dealing with a number of nagging wrist injuries these past couple years. Has this been negatively affecting his performance, probably, it's more likely a question of how much his performance is being impacted. I think the performance gap growing versus Alonso is explained by both Stroll being a worse driver right now than he was a few years ago, and Alonso operating at a slightly higher level than Seb was in 21/22. When taking these nuances into account, I still think Alonso has been a better driver on balance than Seb these past few years compared to Seb in 21/22, but not by as much as stats like this allege.""]",902,335,0.85,902,306,306,8,7,0.0,8

1oa4sqv,It was a racing incident.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oa4sqv/it_was_a_racing_incident/,2025-10-18, Discussion,"So the divers involved in the T1 crash are Alonso, Hülkenberg, Piastri and Norris. 

Norris gets a bad start, Piastri gets alongside him, Norris brakes late into T1 so Piastri goes for the switchback and colides with Hülkenberg which results in the multi car crash.

1. Lando is completly innocent the only thing he did is having a bad start which puts Oscar in the positon of a switchback.

2. I also would say Oscar is innocent he leaves enough space for 1 car on the inside of T1 while going for the switchback to overtake lando. The drivers don't see a lot in these cars i would be suprised if oscar saw Nico going down his inside and he definetly didn't know alonso was on the inside of nico.

3. Nico has no fault he has to stick his nose down the inside of Piastri if he doesnt Alonso just drives past him once he's between alonso and Piastri he has nowhere to go.

4. Alonso also isn't at fault the inside is wide open and he is alongside Nico at the apex.

To summerise it's an unfortunate racing incident. The situation starts unfolding because lando had a slow start and the contact starts because Oscar goes for the switchback. With the benefit of hindsight Oscar shouldn't have went for the switchback but I think he did nothing wrong in the moment. I mean they are 4 wide at one point. (see picture)

To anyone saying oscar is at fault remember 2022 where Russel and Sainz had contact. Sainz also turned in harder than he had to and Russel runs into the side of him everyone blamed Russel for that one. Of course there are strong differences between the 2 incidents but I think you can draw some parallels. Lastly he has to go for it they are fighting for a championship and Lando is his main rival going past him also puts him in the optimal position to potentially attack Max later in the race and also makes sure that Lando can't go for the win. 

I would be interested in your opinions.","['its definitely the evil genius design of turn 1 that leaves it open for many incidents to happen like this', 'I think anyone sane would tell you it\'s a racing incident really, especially since we know F1 rules are (imo rightfully) a bit more easy on any lap 1 incident.

Further, half of the drivers aren't having their sector times shown on the bottom of the screen. Even when all the slots for the times were empty. WTF?

There will be drivers on hotlaps, and ZERO sector timings being shown on the screen, while the camera is focused on a car doing an inlap or outlap.

If anyone from F1 production is somehow reading this: This is not difficult. You need to do two things.

1. Show the lap times for the entire session.
2. Show the sector times of the next 3 drivers to finish a hotlap.

Please for the love of god just do these two things. It doesn't even require interaction, it should all be automatic. I should not be required to pull up the timings on my phone just so I can see this BASIC information.

This isn't an isolated issue. It has been like this all season and it is driving me insane.

1.

2.

It would be so funny if George turns into the de-facto teammate for Max after all their headbutting.

IF max wins all the remaining races he will end on 447 points.

This scenario would leave norris with a maximum of 422 points with all 3rd places.

In another scenario i wanted to see what would happen if piastri gets all 3rd places, and lando all 2nd places. This would make max the world champion with 447, Piastri with 444 and Lando with 443 - 4 points separating the top 3.   
In this scenario piastri would just need 1 2nd place finish to tie with max aswell with both on 447. This would still make max WDC with more race wins.

Ofcourse this will not happen, but the error margin for all drivers is so small at this point. One DSQ and the other 2 drivers are clear favorites. Piastri just needs to finish 3rd in every race except 2 where he needs to finish 2nd or better.
