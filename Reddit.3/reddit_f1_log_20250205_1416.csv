On the one hand, it allows teams to integrate the FIA\'s intervention into their early season development cycle, with a circuit like Barcelona often the scene of big upgrade packages in the past.\n\n> On the other hand, some smaller teams who haven\'t fully caught on with flexing front wings feel like the delayed change bakes in the advantage of those who are at the forefront of a practice the FIA clearly sees the need to clamp down on. And while not forcing teams to make changes from race one can be seen as a way to help teams by not having them throw away carryover designs, some of those midfielders will actually have fewer changes to make than the likes of McLaren and\xa0[Mercedes](https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/), and therefore would have benefitted more from a clampdown right from the start.\n\n> How much will this affect the teams, and the 2025 title race?\n\n> That depends on who you ask, but one senior team source called the change ""proper"" and was adamant the teams involved - which along with McLaren and Mercedes is also believed to include the likes of Aston Martin and\xa0[Alpine](https://www.motorsport.com/team/alpine/24858/)\xa0\\- will have to make significant changes in order to comply, not just to the front wing but also to the all-important floor as the front wing design impacts anything downstream.\n\nSome interesting bits here from the article that claims Red Bull wasn\'t surprised about the change, while the senior team source they heard from suggests that McLaren, Mercedes, Aston Martin, and Alpine will be the most affected by this. \n\nI do worry that this midseason change could affect the championship, and I just hope if there is any effect caused by this it ends up making the championship closer for multiple teams rather than widening the gap like the midseason TD did in 2022.', 'Honestly they should’ve just either decided on this since mid season (that it won’t be allowed for ‘25) or if they decided not to, then they should’ve stuck to their decision.

They took off the guided tours from their website so I'm not sure if anyone is allowed to enter the circuit. I'd love to Hamilton and Charles testing the car tomorrow, please let me know if anyone knows more about this! Thank you fellow friends ","['As far as I know these tests are closed to the public, the circuit would have to move a lot of resources to make these events possible and it is just not profitable']",0,1,0.33,0,1,1,0,0,0.030000000000000027,0
1ihmwco,Antonelli to Mercedes: Mistake or Miracle?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ihmwco/antonelli_to_mercedes_mistake_or_miracle/,2025-02-04, Discussion,"Let's have a fun but civilized debate on the decision of sending Antonelli to Mercedes. 

I'll start supporting against:

Since he has skipped so many important and major parts of motorsport's junior series, it could be a major mistake  sending him straight to a team like Mercedes. ","['If only there was a 4 time champion who skipped so many important and major of motorsport’s junior series and, on top of that, was 17 years old when he entered F1…', ""It's probably a bit early considering Merc's chassis is less mature than many other teams, but Merc isn't going to have another decently mature car until 2027/2028, which is way past the window where Kimi gets picked up by another team.\n\nWhy not gamble on him, even if it's slightly early? The other F2 drivers have come out swinging and he's supposedly even quicker than they are."", 'Civilized? Sorry, I am out', 'Time will tell.', ""I think he's going to surprise a lot of people who have written him off based on his surface level F2 results"", 'I think it’ll be fine. If he’s as great as toto thinks it’ll show from the start and he’ll have flashes of greatness. If he turns out to not be as great as expected then personally i don’t think him being given more or less time out of a top team seat changes that', 'I think Kimi is quick and a sweet boy. Contrast with Max and his energy when he entered F1. Very different. I do worry about his ability to live up to the pressure because Toto has told everyone you’re the second coming. Certainly won’t be easy for him.', ""He'll be fine. Will he set the world on fire? Too early to know. But he'll probably will do a decent enough job."", 'I think a young driver instantly getting a solid car and team at the beginning of their career is always a benefit. It’s way different than starting out at a back of the grid team. Yes the expectations are high but I think his goals would be to keep the car out of the wall and finish in the points as often as possible. I mean look at Oscar in his rookie year. That car wasn’t even that good for most of the season and he was still miles ahead. If he started off at Alpine I think his career would be very different. And of course Lewis and Max are also examples of this (not to say Kimi is guaranteed to be on their level). It’s always better to start with a good foundation. Mercedes knows this and since they’re committed to him long term, they feel little risk with developing him. One extra early season in F1 has much more upside than an extra season staying in F2.']",0,57,0.32,0,206,206,0,8,0.010000000000000009,0
