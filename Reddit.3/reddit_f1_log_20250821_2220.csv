1mw9qp4,Which F1 season did you find to be the most boring?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mw9qp4/which_f1_season_did_you_find_to_be_the_most_boring/,2025-08-21, Discussion,"I'll offer my suggestions over the topic

**2013:** People often say that 2013 was amazing in the first half and boring as hell in the second where Vettel won everything with only Grosjean of all people coming remotely close, but that second half of the season was such a drag.

It didn't help that Webber had no answer to Vettel's race pace. He occasionally out qualified him, but he never beaten him to the win once in the year where the Red Bull won every race in the second half of the season. I remember begging and praying for rain in that time so that something interesting would happen, but if memory serves me correct, the only wet session for the remainder of that year was a single practise session in Brazil. A practise session that Red Bull topped anyway, so it probably wouldn't have made any difference.

I know people always say to focus on the midfield when the same person is winning all the time, but the racing in the midfield wasn't any good either for the most part. The biggest culprit for this were the tyres. Way too many races this year had massive stints where the drivers were simply trying to nurse the tyres to safety. I remember the American grand prix in particular was aggravating as it felt that all the racing halted so that the drivers could all parade around managing the tyres.

**2015:** I will now provide a list of everything I remembered from this season:

* Rosberg throwing his cap at Lewis after he won the title.
* Vettel winning at Malaysia.
* The Hungarian Grand Prix.
* Mercedes' pace vanishing in Singapore
* Felipe Massa's duel with Felipe Nasr in Canada

That is it. Max Verstappen debuted in 2015, and I can't remember anything he did.

  
**2016:** This was supposed to be the year where Ferrari really took the fight to Mercedes, there was so much hype around the Mercedes vs Ferrari battle prior to Melbourne, and then Ted Kravitz says this. *""Ferrari reckon the reason why they're not catching Mercedes, is because Mercedes is simply better than them.""* I will never forget the disappointment in his voice when he said that.

But it was the midfield racing that cemented this season's spot here. Manor being at the back was the norm, but Sauber were just as bad as them this year, and Renault too weren't much further ahead of them. Haas were good in the first half of the year, but were nowhere in the second, not to mention that Gutierrez didn't score any points at all.

Probably not the worst season in F1, it had its moments, but the gaps between the cars were still way too big, and too many teams we want to see fighting for points were simply unable to.

**2020:** I'll admit that a lot of the races in 2020 were fun to watch, but I would argue that they were fun to watch because this year had plenty of chaos. If it didn't rain or if somebody didn't crash, the actual racing itself wasn't that great. People remember the first Silverstone race for Hamilton somehow winning on just three wheels, but tend to forget that the race was pretty dull beforehand, and this was not the only case of this happening.

One of the biggest disasters this seasons had was Ferrari dropping back massively, which meant that only Mercedes and Red Bull (Max) were at the front. People joke about this year being HAM BOT VER for a reason. No one could catch them, let alone beat Hamilton. Only eight races the entire year didn't have that podium lineup and none of them were based on genuine pace.

But I think the biggest problem with this year was with just how one sided the teammate battles were this year. Lance Stroll vs Sergio Perez was genuienly one of the closer team battles, because Hamilton thrashed Bottas, Verstappen thrashed Albon, Leclerc thrashed Vettel, Ricciardo thrashed Ocon, Gasly thrashed Kvyat and Russell thrashed Latifi.

2020 season, fun for chaos, boring for actual competitive racing.

**2023:** Red Bull were ridiculously dominant all year long, and Verstappen crushed Perez into the dirt. It didn't matter what upgrades everyone else brought, none of them worked in the slightest. It got really tiring after two races, and honestly the one race Red Bull didn't win (Singapore) wasn't a particularly good race, and really Las Vegas was the only one where Red Bull even had to fight for it.

Not every race was terrible, but I'd argue that none of them were exciting, mainly because that there was never any competition for Red Bull. It was cool to see Aston Martin and McLaren make a step forward, but all that really did was make it less likely for everyone else to score points.

Another thing to point out this year was that every single driver was kept for the exact same team for 2024. There was no transfer at all. No discussions, no rumours. As boring as 2013 got, at least the transfer gossip was fun.

**My own thoughts:** Personally since watching F1 since 2012, the most bored I've been with it was the first half of 2024, but once the Red Bull domination ended, it was fun to watch. For me the worst has got to be 2023, simply because of how nothing the whole season ended up being, but if 2013 started how it ended, it would've been number one instead, simply because of how bad the actual racing got at times.

Then again I barely remember 2015 at all, so maybe that's the most boring?","['2002 - Shumi won it in the 11th round in France, finishing the season with double the points of the secondo who was Barrichelo in the other Ferrari.\n\nFerrari won 15 out of 17 races...', '2023 Verstappen won 19 of 22 races and RB 21 races in total', '2015, with 2013 not very far behind. \n\n2020 was interesting because of the covid track chaos and just general weirdness. \n\nThe silver war in 2016 made it very interesting imo, the tension was palpable most races.\n\nAll subjective of course.', 'How could you include 2016?

I've been a bit down on the sport in recent times, a combination of not finding the racing as fun as I used to, of being ground down by DTS-focused media coverage and the shitty football-style fan factions. Having followed the sport for 40 odd years and spending a lifetime's fortune watching and reading it, I was getting to the point of jacking it all in.

Yet I watched this today, expecting another cynical Liberty money grab, and I was delightfully surprised. Sure, it's a movie and must be taken as such. But it is a very good movie. The best I've seen this year, and I watch a hell of a lot of movies. 

I felt, at one point, that the use of Martin Donnelly's accident was crass. But I am thrilled they sought him out and had his blessing. I didn't expect to see the special thanks dedicated to him at the start of the credits, and this put a little tear in my eye.

And then, very early in the credits too, seeing Craig Dolby down as a stunt/driving coordinator made we leap with happiness. He deserved so much more from his racing career and I am thrilled he is so highly thought of in this field. Craig, if you're reading this, well done mate. It makes a change from driving lorries at Tenerife Airport! 

In short they made F1 look great which it really is. Sure, it had buxton in it (ffs), but even that low is irrelevant when compared to all the highs. It's an 8 out of 10 for me, Clive.

1mvx6am,Sauber cannot morally show up with a Kick livery at Zandvoort.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mvx6am/sauber_cannot_morally_show_up_with_a_kick_livery/,2025-08-21, Discussion,"We're talking about driving around with the colours of a website that platforms human torture, literal livestreamed death of people, and on top of that the physical abuse of homeless people and animals. The list of offenses that the lack of moderation on this website has produced was already too long before Sauber signed this deal, but certainly it is now beyond the pale.

Where is the discussion about this on the F1 sub? Where is the outrage? As an F1 fan for almost 10 years now, I can do no more than insist on a discussion because it is important to me that people in this sport care about more than how fast the car goes. Where the money comes from has to matter. And I get that it hasn't mattered often. I get that Kick is not the first questionable sponsor in the history of F1. But among questionable sponsors, it is certainly among the worst, if not the literal worst.

Hell some of us called Checo the King of the (human rights violation) streets. \n\nPersonally I'm glad to see the concern though, and I think we should not be discouraged from calling out these dubious partners.
