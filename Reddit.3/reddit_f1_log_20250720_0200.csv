1m3vut0,"In your view, was the Ground Effect Era a success?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m3vut0/in_your_view_was_the_ground_effect_era_a_success/,2025-07-19, Discussion,"With the new regulations featuring a move away from Venturi tunnels, I want to hear everyone’s opinion on this matter. 

Comparing general field spread from 2017-2021, it has of course been much better across the last four years. 

Racing in the early stages of the regulations (2022 to mid-2023) compared to the 2017 - 2021 era, was definitely better. But the advantage it offered of ‘closer racing’ was relatively quickly nullified for what it promised as cars reached higher levels of downforce again. And according to multiple drivers it’s back to pre-2022 levels of dirty air again since 2024. A promised advantage that barely lasted 2 years really.

Not to the mention the exaggerated spray from the floors and how it affected wet racing (or rather the lack of wet racing). There’s also the weight issue with cars weighing almost 800kg (Multiple drivers mentioning how it affected handling and general racing)

So I ask you, do you think the ground effect era was a success or rather a step in the wrong direction?

And what was your biggest ‘issue’ or ‘problem’ with this set of regulations.","[""I think it underdelivered, but as a fan I can't really complain. Was very interesting nonetheless."", 'The ground effect era imo was at its best in 2022 for about half a season, when it almost completely negated dirty air and allowed for some of the most exciting battles in ages with cars able to follow each other closely. Starting with TD039 we’ve been going completely backwards, although when you look at how many drivers and teams have ended up on the podium across the current regulation set, overall it’d still be deemed as a success. I would also like to call out cost cap and aerodynamic development restrictions as equal enablers of close racing during this era.', ""The biggest problem was that they simplified the suspension. With a more complex one, most of the issues would have been solved, and raising the floor wouldn't have been necessary."", 'I remember watching the first race of 2022 and being flabbergasted how close the cars were following each other half way through the first lap. Pre 2022 cars would drop quickly 1~2s behind each other due to dirty air. After the raised the ride height due to porpoising this era started to get worse', 'The word “porpoising” got annoying really quick.', 'It is a success in that they managed to make races faster and somewhat more competitive in an 800+kg car over 5.5m long. \n\nFundamentally this is the problem. The car needs to be smaller and lighter (IMHO). Easy to say and hard to do given the competing requirements of cost, ""road relevance"", raceability, safety and overall speed.', ""A qualified success. \n\nGood: Field spread has been very close. Outside of the top 4 teams there's basically no backmakers any more. There's the top 4 and the midfield. Which is great and probably the first time in 30 years of watching F1 that there's really no tail end charlies. \n\nFollowing has been easier at least at first. The issue is the FIA did not follow up the way they had said they would. There was supposed to be rule changes every year to stop teams making dirty air. They didn't and now we see the results. \n\nIt didn't help that Red Bull dominated for much of it. 2023 was an interesting enough season down the field but one driver winning almost very race is never that compelling. But that sort of thing happens whatever the regulations"", ""Every car is usually split by a second or so in qualy the cars are far closer together overall, we've seen every team get double digit points so far which is good. \n\nTheir hasn't been a big title fight until this year and the Max domination did get boring but overall big success! Sport is so popular now it's wild"", ""Contrary to most opinions here, I think it has been the best of the 3 formulas of the turbo hybrid era. Field spread has been much closer, we've had a great variety of winners, and there's been more potential for close battles.\n\nIt's definitely not been perfect, as often happens, they've optimised their cars to the detriment of good racing, but I've enjoyed watching 2022-2025 much more than I did 2014-2020.""]",437,254,0.94,437,1247,1247,50,16,0.009999999999999898,50

Just $75 for all three days, I had seats on the start finish line since I was so quick and in those days nobody here cared for F1. 
I even sneaked into the overnight garage, since I was a goofy looking kid, nobody bothered me. It was me, the mechanics and a few drivers, insane.
