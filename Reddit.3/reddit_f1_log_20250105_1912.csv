Can't believe there are people out there who actually support him."", ""Who was better in 1997, Coulthard or Hakkinen? I watched that season back in its entirety last year and I thought Coulthard was better, yet 3 of the 4 bring back v10s people think Hakkinen was better, even significantly so. That's baffling me a bit.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rvKRTilRZmo?si=rhKWZ0_8V0UJena1\n\nHakkinen should've won Luxembourg, and that's pretty much it for me. I could unreasonably give him Austria but he retired on lap 1 so that would be a stretch, but sure. In Silverstone he only had the lead in the first place because Coulthard had brake problems, Schumacher had a driveshaft failure, and JV had a 35 second pitstop. On the other hand, Coulthard should've won 3, arguably 4 races in 1997 (Australia, Canada, Italy, Jerez)."", 'Has anyone from Australia ever gotten driver cards from Ferrari?

Anyone know where I can find it?', ""Who is the driver with the highest IQ? Past and present.\n\nI was listening to the Alonso interview om Chequered flag podcast and he's asked if he enjoys driving in a year like 2024. After a brief moment of consideration, he says something quite unique, that it seems that they have the superpower of resetting on Mondays.\n\nIdk it might be a bad indicator of his intelligence as it's probably something he's thought about before.\n\nMaybe him grinning while going to the stewards in Hungary 2007 is the best example of his manipulative capabilities."", ""What prompted this? It's been known for ages that he may have done it -- there was that video that got published just before his contract with Haas was announced -- but I can't find anything to suggest that it's happened again."", 'Disliking him for that is 100% understandable. As is his loony antics while defending endangering other drivers.\n\nWhat i have problem with is the argument that the sins of the father should be affecting him.', 'I thought Hakkinen was better, but it’s definitely close either way. I listened to the podcast too and was surprised by their assessment. Anyone who thinks Hakkinen was significantly better is placing way too much emphasis on the second half of the season.\n\nWith Hakkinen there was obviously the Nurburgring. Austria is tough to give to Mika as you rightly point out, but given the circumstances of that day with the Stewarts holding up those behind for a good number of laps - unless he was two-stopping (which is highly doubtful) he would’ve been in a very strong position indeed. People forget Hungary where he was ahead of both Williamses early on, again we don’t know the fuel loads but he certainly lost some points there. Monza is another forgotten race where he had a puncture. Before that, he made his stop two laps later than Coulthard but he was in his box for 1.4 seconds longer. Given he had also hit traffic before the stop, it’s possible Mika would’ve been right in the fight for the win.\n\nObviously, Coulthard makes some of that back up with the Canadian GP win being taken away from him. He was also an innocent victim at the first corner in Argentina having qualified well ahead. There were just a good number of early races where Coulthard was better - Melbourne, Imola, Spain, Canada, was ahead in France when Mika retired. Mika improved exponentially from approx Silverstone onwards. His fanbase attributes this to him still recovering from his accident, which seems plausible to me.\n\nEdit: Should’ve also added Coulthard’s lost points at the Nurburgring and possibly Jerez given that win may have been his if Mika had already gotten one. I had already factored these into my conclusion, just forgot to mention them.', 'If I had to do a luck correction for mechanical issues that is biased in favour of Hakkinen (but not so much it’s completely unreasonable), here’s what I would end up with:\n\nHakkinen had failures while leading races in Britain and Austria, lost at least a 3rd place in Hungary, a 3rd in Belgium (lost to a DSQ), and a 4th (instead of 9th) in Italy due to a tyre failure. Hakkinen and Coulthard together also lost a 1-2 in Luxembourg with engine failures. Coulthard lost a probable race win in Canada with a clutch failure while leading. I also reversed the team orders in Jerez, giving the win to Coulthard.\n\nUndoing all the mechanical failures and returning the legitimate race order in Europe, Hakkinen would gain a net 37 points while Coulthard would gain a net 19 points. The revised championship standings would be 55 for Coulthard and 64 for Hakkinen. That’s of course just assuming the best case scenario for Häkkinen in every race (for example it’s a huge extrapolation to say he would’ve definitely won Austria). \n\nAt best you could say Hakkinen had a slight edge, definitely not a clear one. I would tend to agree with you, and say Coulthard had a slight edge.']",7,41,0.82,7,38,38,0,0,0.04999999999999993,0
