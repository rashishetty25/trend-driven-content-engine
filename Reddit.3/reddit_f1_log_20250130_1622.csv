This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

It seems that at a certain point in the middle to late in the season, the drama becomes diluted because of how often they race, so each one seems to matter less, much like how people don't care about regular season games in the NBA compared to the Playoffs. \n\n\nWhat do you guys think is the sweet spot of races?
