1ontwwr,Helmut Marko reveals major Red Bull change in Max Verstappen title pursuit,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ontwwr/helmut_marko_reveals_major_red_bull_change_in_max/,2025-11-04, News,,"['> ""All the changes and adjustments have come together in an optimal way,"" Marko told Formule 1 Magazine. \n> \n> ""That is the reason why the car is now more competitive. Max has an important voice in the technical discussions there with his experience.\n> \n> ""It was important that the engineers started listening to Max more. They did that before, but not to the extent they do now. You know, before that it was more about numbers on the simulator or CFD (computational fluid dynamics).\n> \n> ""Max told the engineers what he needed, got more confidence in the car that way and it became easier to drive. The window in which the car works has become bigger.""\n\nWe\'ve heard similar from Mekies and Max himself, and now Marko is saying the same: they\'re just listening to Max more.\n\nPretty dumb this wasn\'t done sooner.', 'It is insane how often that is the big revelation: the engineers listen to what the drivers want to feel, and then they perform better in the car.\n\nLewis left Mercedes in part because they wouldn’t listen to him. You would think these teams would put at least some stock into their multi-world champions opinions.', 'TLDR: The Engineers are now listening to Max’s feedback.    \n\nWild that this has to be said.', 'He told them that the car simply needs to be built for combat.', 'Who would’ve thought listening to the Champ more would make the working window better and the car faster', 'So now the car is *actually* designed for Max and it’s better for Yuki too? Yeah, that was always a dubious narrative.', 'They employ the best ""sensor"" on the planet and are finally deferring to his data. Genius lol', ""Excuse me while I pull out my fainting couch.  Listening to your driver's feedback can help make the car easier to drive for that driver."", ""Max has some of his best drives at the last leg of the season. Last year, he had already secured the title so I don't think they were too concerned with squeezing out wins. With him legitimately having a chance to steal this title from McLaren, they're going to pull out all the stops. Yuki probably doesn't even have any development from his engineers. The entire team and factory are doing what they can to try to get Max this title. It's the ultimate middle finger to Zak Brown if Red Bull can steal this from McLaren. It's amazing how bad things can get for your team because you wanted to boot Daniel Ricciardo and screw over Otmar Szafnauer."", 'Does this mean that Red Bull will now favor Max instead of Yuki for the championship fight?']",1742,206,0.95,1742,5088,5088,81,7,0.0,81
