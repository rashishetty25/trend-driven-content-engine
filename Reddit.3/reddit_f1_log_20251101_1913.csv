Still, it's funny listening to commentary that doesn't have any pretensions of being unbiased. They are cheering Häkkinen's championship as a great win for Finland, and why not? It's hard not to be taken in by their enthusiasm.\n\nMost countries around the world have partisan commentary, but the UK is held to a higher standard, at least here on Reddit and other social platforms. For the world feed that happens to have British commentators, I agree they should aim to be as neutral as possible, but why should the Sky F1 commentators, for example, not be allowed to support British drivers when every other country supports their own?""]",272,29,0.97,272,124,124,39,4,-0.010000000000000009,39
