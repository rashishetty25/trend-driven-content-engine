Pierre Gasly starts fifth in the Bahrain GP and lost only 0.375 seconds to pole position. Despite an engine handcap of three tenths.**\n\n> It’s a round birthday. Alpine chief renovator Flavio Briatore was 75 years old on the day of qualifying for the Bahrain GP. When Pierre congratulated Gasly in the morning, the eternally young Italian asked: “And, what did you bring me as a birthday present?” Gasly pointed to his right foot. A heavy gas foot should straighten it.\n\n> Alpine had arrived with zero points for the fourth round of the World Championship. The only team was still empty, and the French cars had left a very good impression during the winter test drives in Bahrain. But it seemed to be swept away in Melbourne, Shanghai and Suzuka.\n\n> Briatore stood in front of his troop: “We were not as bad as we looked. Our problem was that we never got what was theoretically possible out of the softest tire compound.” This resulted in poor starting positions and correspondingly difficult races. The team did not travel to Bahrain with a single point. This is not the claim that Alpine had before the 2025 Formula 1 season. They wanted to be “Best Of The Rest” and annoy the top teams McLaren, Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes.\n\n> **Engine costs lap time.**\nThe Renault engine is not a rocket with which you can win places. “We lose three to four tenths of the drive alone, depending on the route,” Briatore curses. It’s the old problem. The engine has to be into charging mode too early on the straights to fill the battery. For Bahrain, the loss according to the simulation is 0.3 seconds.\n\n> And yet, with 1.30.216 minutes, Gasly managed a time that was only 0.375 seconds above Oscar Piastri’s pole position. “Without the loss of the engine, we start from the front row,” Briatore is convinced. Gasly impressed especially in the second sector, where he was practically as fast as the McLaren drivers. It is the sector with the most curves in which time goes flutes. This is shown to the engineers: The car is aerodynamically healthy.\n\n> It could have gone better in the first three races, Briatore is annoyed. The error was that the engineers had tried to compensate for the power deficit elsewhere. For example, with the differential setting. “The experiments didn’t help,” says the master craftsman. “That’s why I told the team before the weekend: no more experiments. We’re driving like in the test.”\n\n> **Grace period for Doohan.**\nThe Alpine also kept its tyre temperatures in the window for the entire lap. Pierre Gasly and Jack Doohan did not lose a disproportionate amount of time in the last stretch, unlike some competitors. The fact that Gasly also took sixth place in the third training session in shearing heat is a good sign. Even there, the tire temperatures did not shoot through the ceiling.\n\n> Jack Doohan was also on his way to Q3. The Australian came in sixth place through Q1 and had a good chance of getting one lap further even after the first attempt in Q2. But then, in the last attempt, Doohan no longer brought all sectors together optimally. “He still has to work on that,” the team said. “Jack is fast, but not yet constant.” According to recent information, despite his two accidents in Melbourne and Japan, he still has a grace period until summer.', '“What did you bring me as a birthday present” and Gasly gives him a second row.

Thus, PIA gets a better exit, and builds more speed through the T2&3 combination. When coming to T4, PIA lifts earlier and more gradual, coming to 0% at nearly the same point as NOR, who, brakes earlier and longer. Coming at nearly the same speed to the S-Combination of T5/6/7. Before T6, PIA brakes earlier, allowing for a better exit and not having to lift-off as much as NOR through T7. Approach to T8 is nigh identical, but PIA was earlier back on the throttle and NOR had to feather for a moment, costing him a bit of speed. Coming to the Tilke-Special of T9/10, NOR lifts later again and PIA brakes later, again. PIA gets a slightly better exit, capping at a higher top speed before T11. There, PIA lifts later, which lets NOR have a better exit and gaining back a bit on PIA. But T13: PIA lifts and brakes later, carrying more speed into the corner and having a slightly worse exit as NOR. T14 doesn't shake anything up, yet again, PIA lifts way earlier and more gradual than NOR, who is also braking earlier and longer.

Conclusion: Difficult. Their respective car control is remarkably similar. PIA brakes later and finds better exits, having overall a bit more confidence in the car. The approaches to T4 and T14 are quite extreme, with PIA starting to lift-off 90 and 60 metres, respectively, earlier than NOR (if the data of FastF1 is to be trusted). My guess: After seeing the live delta to PIA on his dash after T3, NOR went all in, staying on the throttle longer than usual, thus paying with worse exits, which cost him even more time. And if I may delve into the crystal ball: NOR was standing in his own way, starting to drive with a clenched jaw upon glancing at the live delta inbetween T3&4. Probably cost him the front row.","['Oh my days. Actual analysis instead of “mentality” talk.

1jxpyev,Mercedes has screwed George several times in the past two years and it is not talked about often.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jxpyev/mercedes_has_screwed_george_several_times_in_the/,2025-04-12, Discussion,"With today's grid penalties, I realised that Mercedes in the past two years has screwed up George's performances more often than not.

Some particular instances that instantly come to mind -

1)Britain 2024 - water system issue
2)Spa 2024 - DSQ
3)Brazil 2024 - strategy fuck up and not listening to him
4)Japan 2025 Qualy - same
5)Today, releasing before time.
Some more strategic calls I can remember faintly, where the team didn't bother listening to him.
6) Hungarian GP Qualy 2023

Several pitstops in the past two years I can recall, Mercedes pitstops have never been spectacular but sometimes it feels they need a new pitcrew.

While George himself makes some spectacular mistakes, Mercedes are no better sometimes.","['Is any team not screwing their drivers over?', ""It's fine. George hits the T-pose to assert dominance when needed."", 'You say “screwed George” and your first example is “water system issue” lol', ""And? Those are mistakes.

1jxrhzv,Will Lando Norris Be Daniel Ricciardo 2.0?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jxrhzv/will_lando_norris_be_daniel_ricciardo_20/,2025-04-12, Discussion,"Daniel Ricciardo used to be seen as a future World Champ. He was fast, had the personality, and won races. But things started to shift at Red Bull when Max Verstappen joined. Danny was still good, but Max just kept getting better, and it felt like the team gradually leaned more toward him. Eventually, Danny left for Renault, saying he wanted a new challenge.

Later on, he ended up at McLaren with Lando Norris. On paper, Danny was the experienced one, but on track, Lando was usually ahead. Danny had a great win at Monza in 2021, but week to week, Lando was the more consistent one. Over time, that performance gap kind of pushed Danny out of the team, and out of top-team conversations altogether.

Now, Lando’s the one in that senior driver role. McLaren’s finally built a car that can win, and he’s expected to lead the team. But his teammate, Oscar Piastri, has been right there with him and sometimes even ahead. Lando might be the quicker one overall, but Oscar’s been more consistent and seems less fazed under pressure. If Lando keeps missing out at key moments, McLaren might start leaning into Oscar’s consistency instead.

In Bahrain qualifying just recently, Oscar took pole. Lando ended up P6 and looked pretty frustrated after. Then there was that Max comment from earlier, where he said if he were in the McLaren, “you wouldn’t have seen me.” Lando was asked about it, and honestly, it kind of looked like it got to him.

Is Lando just under pressure, or are we starting to see a Ricciardo 2.0 situation? (I really hope not. He's too young though, and it's still very early to say. But still, just asking the question.)","['Has there ever been a season in recent memory where ""It\'s just been a couple of races, give it some time to see how everything plays out"" been more relevant on so many topics?', 'Daniel never had the fastest car', 'In fairness to Daniel his peak was during the Mercedes era, he never had a proper car to compete for a title. \n\nYou could make the argument he was the best driver in F1 for the 2016 season, nobody has ever said Lando was the best driver in F1 over a season.', 'Time will tell but for starters Ricciardo never had the quickest car in his time competing in Formula 1.', 'People were saying the exact reverse after Oscar spun out in Aus.', 'Nah, good grief, one slightly off quali session and your ""DR’ING"" him ?!', 'I hate this community sometimes', ""Lando has beaten Oscar both years they've been together"", ""'Oscar has been more consistent'\n\nHave you watched the 2024 F1 season""]",0,107,0.33,0,100,100,0,32,0.0,0
