See what happened to Bortoleto in Silverstone.', 'Plan C for Combat', ""I think we may be SLIGHTLY overreacting to the Hulk P3.\n\nSauber has improved over the season, absolutely. That's proven by Gabi's improved qualifying and overall performance. But Hulk's P3 doesn't suddenly mean this car is top of the midfield like I've seen some people try to claim (perhaps not this article). It was a wet race where certain teams made dumbass strategy choices (Ferrari/Leclerc, Red Bull, Mercedes) and Hulkenberg is excellent enough of a driver to have capitalised on that. This race didn't necessarily need the fastest car.\n\nThat said, I don't want to come off like I'm downplaying Hulkenberg. He drove amazing, and when I say the race didn't need the fastest car; that doesn't mean P3 in a Sauber ISN'T impressive. This would not have happened in the Sauber of years before. My stance is that they're finally competitive with the midfielders, which can not be said about the Bottas+Zhou era sadly (they deserved better). But they'll still need a bit of luck to get the car into the points on any consistent basis, wherein I feel Williams/VCARB can get there on the car's merit.\n\nMy opinion remains that Williams is probably the fastest car on raw pace (but clearly unreliable as hell at the moment), but VCARB is perhaps not quite as fast, but while having very few technical issues. The only one I remember was Hadjar's balls being strangled. But the fact they've got two rookie drivers and are doing as well as they are means their car has gotta be somewhat solid. After that, it's kinda hard. Aston Martin have flashes of pace especially with Alonso in qualifying, but the car drops like a rock in so many of the actual races. Hulkenberg is able to pull off excellence in his car,  but I think Gabi's performance tells a bit of a different story over the season considering how amazing he was in F2. Alpine is dead last - Gasly can pull magic out of nowhere, but that car is horrific. It's like Red Bull if Red Bull was never actually good."", '> Sauber sporting director Inaki Rueda\n\nAnyone know if he is related to Fran Rueda, the LMGT3 Mercedes #60 driver?', 'Why are they still so bad in qualifying?']",712,65,0.97,712,1427,1427,40,1,0.0,40
