The racing is not good, in my opinion. I know it has been close in terms of standings, and while that is wonderful to hear, this season has been absolutely shocking based on the quality of racing. Amongst the seasons under these regulations, this personally has to be one of my lowly rated seasons of the bunch\n\n\nEverything seems to be decided in qualifying and Turn 1, the cars are large, so close wheel-to-wheel racing is risky for drivers to make attempts and Pirelli's tyres are godsent. I am hesitant to criticise them as well because it is a difficult task. But they have made the tyre wear aspect so durable, that it becomes a non-factor in strategies already"", ""Think the drivers are more or less frustrated than the spectators? \n\nI watch most races on DVR. Watch the first five laps while they shake it out and then bump five minutes forward, check the positions are unchanged. Bump forward again. Positions unchanged...  etc etc. Even the manic enthusiasm of the commentators can't disguise the dullness of the sport."", 'Most of these races feel like Monaco this year. Qualifying and subsequently free air is just king.', 'F1 is a very science/data driven sport. A driver can\'t just show up one day, ""give it their all"", and perform massively better in the race than the data suggests they can.\n\nIf you push the car harder, you burn through tyres faster. The best tradeoff for race time/track positioning is already known by the teams before the race begins.\n\nIf the data suggests that coming out of Lap 1, in 6th, the wear you\'d have to put on the tyres to get up to 5th would probably come back to bite you later in the stint/pit stop strategy, then you just hold position. And the guy in 5th holds position. And everyone just holds position. You\'re probably roughly where you should be in the running order unless you massively underqualified, at which point it\'s a bit optimistic that you can jump 3 positions further up the order, even if you are slightly out of position, pace wise. You\'re not out of position by *enough.* Again, it\'s not a sport where a driver can just get a good night\'s rest and be a second faster per lap. Everyone is very much limited by physics.\n\nThe closer the field is, you will have less overtaking in a series where tyre degradation is a real thing (especially when following). You need meaningful differences between the cars/drivers to create enough of a gap to make overtakes easy enough to pull off (for the faster cars), that you may want to use up a bit of rubber to push for track positioning, or go for a two stop strategy despite coming out behind slower cars, because you\'ll be able to fly past them with your faster car + fresh tyres.\n\nIf you want overtakes, you need to stop people saving tyres. Driving seconds off the pace intentionally because it works out in a net race time gain means that everyone is driving massively under the limit, and when drivers of this level are driving massively under the limit, the chance for a significant mistake is close to zero. If your car is only a few tenths faster a lap, and the driver in front makes zero significant mistakes for 1.5 hours, then you\'re not getting past.', ""I'm in no place to give an educated opinion on this, but I wonder if bringing back the full suite of tyre compounds could help with this problem.  Let teams decide their tyre strategies even more, and even build their car around what compounds they'd like to worth it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I mean by this, if others reading this aren't aware, is FIA truncated the tyre options for a weekend.  Before 2019 they had the full suite available to them.  Pink and Purple were even softer than Red.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, these compounds already exist today and is why you see C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and Pirelli decides which compound is going to be used for the race weekend, but I wonder if they removed this limitation and allowed the teams to decide.  It could absolutely introduce some spicy elements to racing.  Imagine if Mercedes is able to build a car to keep Purples lasting longer while Ferrari can retain decent delta on a hard... its a cool theory to introduce.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI understand the reasoning to simplify the process for manufacturing and viewership, but at the same time it wasn't that complicated to understand.

I feel like Austin really showed how Mercedes and Ferrari can become the ""kingmakers"" in this season. You have some of the best drivers on the grid driving absolute shitboxes, acting as on track roadblocks for anyone trying to get a podium. They also seemingly don't understand their own cars, so it's not like Red Bull or Mclaren can easily plan around them. Despite all this, both teams have non-zero shots at podium positions and so they really have the chance to cause upsets.

For me, the extra exciting part is that Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull are in their own constructors fight for second. Every point matters all the way through the top 8, not just for the 3 championship drivers.

I'm wondering if we'll even see a podium with all the championship contenders on it before the end of the season. I feel like it's definitely possible.

Seems clear air advantage overcomes that deficit.', ""It was nice to see that clean racing between Charles and Lando. They definitely carried this race's excitement"", ""Leclerc was the star yesterday. Such a brilliant drive showcasing bold strategy, great defensive driving and keeping a way faster car behind twice. I really wish Hamilton got a podium yesterday. It was his best chance in recent races imo as Mercedes didn't have pace and Piastri was also behind. \n\nYuki had a good race. Really happy he got a good weekend in points. \n\nI had a lot of fun watching Kimi Antonelli. Super fun, happening drive.\n\nNorris also did a great race. He is 14 points behind and he can definitely get this done with his current form.  His car also had a lot of pace.

He‚Äôs exceptional at positioning his car, you can see it from his starts as well. I‚Äôm also just relieved he‚Äôs getting praise from the general fanbase for this, because there have been a few performances this season where I felt he did a top-class drive but didn‚Äôt get recognition from casual fans for it because of the car being unremarkable or overshadowed (Saudi Arabia, Spa, Monza.)\n\nThe moves and pace Antonelli had after pitting were brilliant and I wonder if he could‚Äôve had his first on track fight with his teammate had things gone another way. If he had this level of performance at the European tracks, his stock would be much higher - it‚Äôs strange how the moment they leave Europe, he‚Äôs the fiery rookie I remember from F4. I hope he can end the season on a good note.\n\nI‚Äôm disappointed in Sainz, but also not surprised? This year has been a rollercoaster and with him becoming more comfortable in the team, we can see him trying old tricks. The problem is, he shouldn‚Äôt trust rookies to make space for him like that. To me it seems like Sainz still has the mentality that everyone he‚Äôs racing is a top driver with years of experience. But he needs to reel back in his expectations for how other drivers will react to his moves. Other than that one silly mistake though, I‚Äôm pleased with his pace and continued improvement with this car.\n\nAnother underrated weekend from Bearman. He is just so quick when he‚Äôs feeling confident, and nobody can say he doesn‚Äôt have the willingness to risk moves. I‚Äôm excited to see how he grows and one day how he does in Ferrari.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say Norris had a good weekend because he didn‚Äôt complete the sprint (not by his own fault, but we have no idea how he would‚Äôve done) and he was stuck behind Leclerc for almost 90% of the race. But compared to Piastri, Norris looks like a real WDC contender. As in... Piastri was absolutely nowhere this weekend. With this being the 4th weekend in a row he‚Äôs struggled to make an impact, it feels like he‚Äôs on a mental spiral downward. I know he had this problem last season too but his improvement from the end of last season to the start of this one seemed so big that I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd have the same issue. Even though I‚Äôm not rooting for him to win it all, I do hope he can find some good results again just to make it a three-way race rather than a two-way race between Norris and Verstappen with him slowly dwindling away.\n\nI‚Äôm surprised people thought of this race as boring. There was action all over the field and Leclerc vs Norris alone had me on the edge of my seat. COTA is my home track and I‚Äôm always proud when we come here because it never fails to deliver excitement in some way.', 'The most worrying part about Piastri is that two races in a row he has fallen behind the person in front by 4+ seconds. It looks like tire saving but then he never makes that time back up before pitting.\n\nSo he just loses 4 seconds and is just nowhere on the 2nd stint after having to pit early to defend an undercut.\n\nHe just seems slow and the tire wear deg delta we thought he has fixed seems to have vanished on him.\n\nHoping he can get it together and it was just a couple of poor races.', 'Apparently, Alpine is looking to punish Colapinto for not sticking to team orders.\n\nIt would be hilarious if they decide to do that, even the French press is publicly shaming the team for those orders. And especially when they are in the Latin American stint of the season.\n\nIf anything, Franco followed Briatore‚Äôs advice of ‚Äúthe only important thing is being faster than your rival‚Äù, which in this case is Pierre.', 'Another Pirelli masterclass in the books. M-S/S-M 1 stop being a viable strategy on a high energy circuit with hot temps, hats off lads.', ""Fuck, I hope my comment goes through haha\n\n\nFerrari were on a roll yesterday with their split strategies, a play that I will put in a good word for, so as long as I watch Formula One. I was very skeptical of the call for Leclerc to start on used softs in particular, but I was proven dead wrong with the combination of how well the stops and calls were well-timed, and how well Leclerc made that strategy work. P3 and P4, for everything that has happened to them, is magnificent and I'll take this immensely\n\n\nSpeaking of Leclerc, this has been one of my favourite Leclerc-centric races since Suzuka 2024, and another race to add to my list of reasons on why Leclerc is fierce and precise when it comes to defending. Dude usually goes to the end of his means when he does so, and without too much LiCo-related issues hindering his race, he was able to hold Norris off for very long. Even when Norris overtook him in those two instances *(and cheers to Bozzi)*, Leclerc still applied pressure to Norris whose race can go so wrong if he doesn't take caution. Driver of the day for me, and I'll be damned if this drive goes under the radar when detailing his accomplishments as a driver\n\n\nSmall shoutout for Hamilton for retaining P4 with a strong drive, and for successfully giving me a heart attack for that puncture. From what I know, he was told to LiCo mid-race so it is evident those issues are still existent. Looks like it is a race-by-race case, and they need to figure out what track specifics can suit their car to maximise the most results!"", ""For as much as hype I had when Hamilton joined Ferrari, this weekend showed how much Charles is still #1 when it comes to overall pace. I don't think Lewis has had a stretch where he's the faster car. Hoping Lewis adapts well to the new regs next year.\n\nAlso, very surprised Ferrari let them race so hard on Charles' in-lap. Silly to see how much time they lost instead of calling to let Lewis ahead."", ""F1 needs to sort out its tire situation. We consistently are having weekends this year with very low deg and very consistent performance regardless of compounds, which isn't amazing. I understand that Pirelli doesn't love the optics of their tires blowing up or failing or whatever, but there needs to be something changed for the future seasons to make tire strategy more consequential, if at all possible.\n\nLando looked very strong today compared to Piastri. Max looked like 2023. Oscar has had three stinker weekends in a row and is looking rattled- he needs to pull off a win in the next couple weeks to claw back what he's lost. A DNF would be absolutely brutal for his chances, especially with Max looking like a man possessed.\n\nThat said... give me a Ver-Nor-Pia for the next four races and I believe we end up with 1 point separating all three for AD. Fingers crossed, this year has gotten much more interesting.""]",57,150,0.92,57,148,148,1,2,-0.010000000000000009,1
