1odel9t,Norris is a particular bad starter: the numbers,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odel9t/norris_is_a_particular_bad_starter_the_numbers/,2025-10-22, Discussion,"https://preview.redd.it/67gqcyy45pwf1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=19074f8c188fdf5639e61217cb9199d328c08e0c

When Norris starts from the front two rows he loses an average of 0.65 positions, the worst among top drivers in recent memory. He’s also the most likely to lose positions (40% of races vs Max at 16%) and the least likely to gain (10% of races, vs Max at 28%).

Note that this analysis only considers starts from the front two rows, which naturally biases the results toward losses (since there’s more room to move backward than forward). Even so Max still manages to gain positions on average. Alonso And Leclerc also perform strongly across these metrics.

**Methodology:**

* \~15 years of data analyzed
* Only races where the driver started in the front two rows
* Lap-1 position changes capped at ±4 to limit the impact of outliers

Edit: [updated](https://ibb.co/DP8RwjWZ) with data back to '96. Mark Webber hahahaha! Also, per /u/[Ger\_Oktoberfe](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ger_Oktoberfest/)st's  [suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odel9t/comment/nkubqpp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I added a position delta relative to the average, which broadly tells a similar story. Lastly, data sourced from the [jolpica-F1](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1) API.","['Russell\'s comments after COTA were amusing - he was banking on Norris doing the sensible thing at the start. Instead Lando did Lando things and it blew up in George\'s face.\n\n*""I made a good start. Max covered Lando. I expected Lando to go on the outside to cover Charles, so I stayed on the inside but Lando didn\'t move across.

The problem here is that it\'s a lot harder to go forward from 1st than it is to go forward from 4th. That\'s skews the data against people who get pole a lot. Having only the first 4 start rows also means you have very little data on most of the mid-field.\n\nMy suggestion: First, calculate the average position-after-one-lap for each starting position. Let\'s borrow from golf and call this ""par"". So for pole is probably like 1.5 or so, while for 10th it\'s probably very close to 10. Then just compare each driver\'s start with what is par, and get your average from that.\n\nWould allow you to do all drivers and all starting positions, and probably give a more accurate result.', 'He’s also quite poor at safety car restarts. He gets caught sleeping a lot.', ""I don't think it’s so much his reaction time to the start itself but his general risk aversion wheel to wheel in t1 and the way he preps the tires.

Red Bull's resurgence in the F1 championship with Max Verstappen has been marked by a strategic focus on taking each race weekend as it comes. The RB21's competitiveness has been confirmed progressively, with significant performances in Singapore and Texas.

Initial victories in Monza and Baku were met with skepticism due to track layouts, but subsequent races proved the RB21's capability on diverse circuits. Updates introduced at the Italian Grand Prix brought the car closer to the formidable McLaren MCL39.

Christian Horner's departure from Red Bull was influenced by friction with the team's Austrian leadership and the 'Verstappen clan.' Horner believed resources should be diverted to future projects, doubting the RB21's potential to close the gap with McLaren.

The decision to relieve Horner of his duties was not sudden, as developments for the RB21 were planned well before the summer break. The technical sector, led by Pierre Waché, faced implicit criticism from Horner, who saw no sense in further investment.

Despite Horner's skepticism, Red Bull's technical updates have revitalized the RB21, making it competitive across various circuits. The team's commitment to the current season has paid off, challenging the dominance of McLaren's MCL39.

The renewed competitiveness of the RB21 offers new interpretations of Red Bull's strategy, highlighting the importance of continuous development and adaptation in F1. The team's decision to persist with the RB21 has proven fruitful, defying initial doubts.","['This is very interesting given the praise Mekkies has received for his technical inputs with car developments and having a more open discussions with all the parties involved.\n\nHowever that doesn’t take away from Horner given these updates were planned when he was TP and I can understand him wanting to focus on 2026 given the huge investments needed by RB.\n\nLet’s see how this year goes and where Red Bull are next year to really make any judgement.', ""So the technical team's reasoning is probably that they need to understand the car because they have been struggling for over a year, and therefore putting out updates is the best way to verify whether what you are doing in Milton Keynes is correct?\n\nBecause any betting man would just give up on the championship after being so far behind with a car that has been struggling for over a year.

If they win the WDC or move up in the WCC, then yes."", ""Oh that's some nice old BS right there. Horner was still TP when these updates were being implemented, so he clearly didn't throw everything away and still kept his eye on the next season.\xa0"", 'I don’t like the man, but even the fact he was wrong about this doesn’t make his stance unreasonable. This comeback wasn’t exactly a likely outcome', ""interestingly, I feel that if Max fails to win the WDC, it kinda proves Horner correct.

1odwnn9,"Lauda’s “monkey” line was 13 years old, not 30",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odwnn9/laudas_monkey_line_was_13_years_old_not_30/,2025-10-23, Throwback,"At the 2014 Abu Dhabi GP press conference, Walter Koster bundled three quotes/episodes into one long question. Here’s the actual background to each:



1.Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‘take a monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.’ - April 27, 2001 (not “30 years ago”)

Original German:[ “Jeder Affe kann jetzt, was die Bedienung des Autos betrifft, in der Formel 1 fahren.” ](https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article447943/Jeder-Affe-kann-jetzt-Formel-1-fahren.html)(“Every monkey can now drive in Formula 1 as far as the operation of the car is concerned.”)

Lauda repeated the sentiment at Jaguar’s launch (Jan 4, 2002): “[I've said that any monkey could drive a modern F1 car so I think monkey say, monkey do](https://atlasf1.autosport.com/news/2002/jan/report.php/id/6162/.html)” and after a Valencia test (Jan 13, 2002), where he spun twice, clarified [he meant compared to his day](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/lauda-spins-twice-in-jaguar-test-font-faceverdana-size1iupdated-i-font-5058698/5058698/).



2. Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‘I had to start my car like a computer, it’s very complicated.’ - Mar 28, 2014 (Malaysia FP)

After the Friday running at 2014 Malaysian GP, where Vettel faced technical problems, he [explained in German](https://www.formel1.de/news/interviews/2014-03-28/vettel-gott-sei-dank-macht-das-auto-keine-probleme) that with so much technology and software on board, sometimes the fix is to switch the car off and on again, like a home computer.



3. And Nico Rosberg said, he pressed, during the race - I don’t remember what race - the wrong button on the wheel. - Nov 2, 2014 (US GP)

[Rosberg said](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-usgp-ers-error-cost-nico-rosberg-in-battle-with-lewis-hamilton-5046033/5046033/) that when Hamilton attacked on lap 24 (Turn 12) he’d requested extra ERS power using a switch instead of the correct button, so the boost didn’t arrive in time, leaving him vulnerable to the pass.



Fun fact

Six years after that presser, in 2020, only two drivers from that Abu Dhabi panel were still on the F1 grid. By 2025, it’s three, and there’s only one driver who’s common to the 2020 and 2025 grids.","['So thirteen was misspronounced as thirty or missheared by people?', 'It’s not the offseason yet man', 'Can you repeat the question?', 'It’s…it’s not even season break yet', 'Gentleman', 'I need a post here in April 27th 2031, that’s just “Thirty years ago Niki Lauda, told us …”', ""It was actually a really good question with thought out allusions.

We have three all time greats (Max, Hamilton and Alonso), a few drivers that with the right car could be at least multiple time WC (Leclerc, Russell, Piastri and Norris), a midfield packed with race winners, consistent point scorers and future race winner drivers, and one of the best rookie class we've ever seen. Arguably the worst drive in the grid, Stroll, already has 3 podiums and 1 pole. 

If we think that not so long ago we had paying drivers like Latiffi, Mazepin, Sirotkin and so many others, and that in the early 90s almost half of the grids were paying drivers of this level, I can't think of a season that had a better grid.

Tsunoda hasn’t really been helping Verstappen or Red Bull strategically this season – there’s been no teamwork when it could’ve mattered.

There’s literally nothing to lose.

It could actually be a win-win situation:
1.	Talent evaluation: Red Bull gets to see how Hadjar performs under real race pressure.
2.	Strategic upside: A hungry rookie might be able to snatch a point or two from McLaren. 
","['No', ""Let's not forget that Tsunoda performed fine in the Racing Bulls too. Qualified p5 in Australia and was in Q3 in both the Sprint and 'main' Qualifying.  Lawson also did poorly in his first 2 races in the RBR, but is also doing well in the Racing Bulls - that car is fast and easy to drive.\n\nNo point in running Hadjar's confidence, putting him under more pressure (considering he is supposed to help Verstappen) and I don't think he will be that much of an upgrade. \n\nAlso, considering that Honda paid for Tsunoda to be in that seat.... Not happening. Yuki will be leaving RBR this year, I don't see a demotion saving him, they would probably rather keep Lawson. So let him finish his season."", ""No.    \nAlso: why would you want that when next year's car is a new concept? To shatter Isack's confidence before he has a real chance?"", ""Absolutely no reason to do that.\n\n\n1. Not necessary\n2. No lol just no chance of that at all\n\n\nThe second red bull car doesn't have all the same upgrades as the first car so it's never going to get close so it's just pointless throwing someone else in and ruining their confidence\xa0"", 'No. It’s already insanely hard to learn the car. Let alone for a rookie. Let alone with 5 races left on the calendar. It’s not worth potentially floundering Hadjar for a couple more points which they aren’t guaranteed. \n\nDon’t forget that Yuki probably would be doing much better if he was in the VCARB instead of the RB21. I think out of all the options Red Bull had, promoting Yuki was the best option for this year. If you look at Checo’s form at the end of 2024 it’s very similar to Yuki’s performance save for a few outliers. It was mostly 10ths or lower or DNFs with a few decent positions spattered about. However Checo was riding the wave down on the rb20 and Tsunoda has been riding the wave in the trough and is on the way up so we’ll see how it plays out.', ""Yeah absolutely.
