1ox439g,Updates from today's F1 Commission meeting. Limits to bare carbon fibre; Drivers changing numbers; tyre life and pit stop proposals,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ox439g/updates_from_todays_f1_commission_meeting_limits/,2025-11-14, News,"The fourth and final meeting of the Formula 1 Commission in 2025 took place today, November 14 at the offices of the FIA in London. The meeting was chaired by FIA Single-Seater Director Nikolas Tombazis and FOM President and CEO Stefano Domenicali.

**2026 Technical and Sporting Regulations**

Following discussion at the meeting, a raft of refinements to the 2026 Technical, Sporting, Financial and Operational Regulations will be submitted to the World Motor Sport Council on December 10.

A proposal to explore mandatory two pit stops for grands prix was discussed along with adjustments to tyre specifications, tyre-life limits and the use of three compounds during the race. The discussion centred on feedback on analysis and simulations from teams and Pirelli. No changes were presently agreed, but it was agreed that talks on this topic would continue during the 2026 season.


**Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR)**

Changes to Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR) are being developed to bring Formula 1 into line with contemporary processing and simulation technology while mindful of cost considerations.


**Car liveries and driver numbers**

Following discussions with the Technical Advisory Committee, the topic of a minimum surface requirement limit for car liveries in 2026 was discussed.

It was agreed by Commission representatives that a minimum of 55% of surface area (when viewed from the side and above) must be covered by painted or stickered liveries as opposed to bare carbon fibre surfaces. The objective of this measure is to increase visual differentiation between cars.

Changes to the regulation on permanent competition numbers for drivers, introduced for the 2014 season, were discussed. It was agreed that a proposal for drivers to change their numbers during their career would be permitted.

 
**Driving Cooling System**

The potential mandating of the Driving Cooling System (DCS) for 2026 was discussed. Re-designs to the current DCS and cooling garments were proposed along with an increased weight allowance for use of the DCS. Further driver feedback will be sought in parallel with the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association (GPDA).","["">It was agreed that a proposal for drivers to change their numbers during their career would be permitted.\n\nI wonder who's going to be the first driver to change their number, considering it becomes a part of their branding identity.\n\n>a minimum of 55% of surface area (when viewed from the side and above) must be covered by painted or stickered liveries as opposed to bare carbon fibre surfaces.\n\nBasically this prevents another Alpine A524 scenario, i'm glad we'll see more colorful cars from now on.

I mean tires utterly falling off a cliff so that Lando gets blown past by the driver in last place if Yuki has fresh tires and blows past him. That the best. Say Max is chasing Lando for example. There only 15 laps left. The tires are good for 10 laps (I'm making stuff up so roll with it.) Lando tires might let him make it to the end but if they fall off it over.

1ox27zy,Norris vs. Piastri | Qualifying Gaps Visualized,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ox27zy/norris_vs_piastri_qualifying_gaps_visualized/,2025-11-14, Statistics,"Was curious so I wanted to take a look at how the qualifying gaps between Norris and Piastri have played out over the course of the season. I took a look at their gap between each other in actual time interval (seconds), and then also took a look at the gap between them as a percentage of overall lap time, to adjust for the range of different circuits' lap times. 

Notes:

* I excluded the races where either driver had a crash in Q3 (Jeddah for Norris, Baku for Piastri). I considered using their Q2 times, but Norris had the faster time in Q2 in Jeddah, so it didn’t really feel like it would be representative of their actual performances that weekend. If you want to take a look at what it would look like with Jeddah and Baku, [I made an alt graph here](https://imgur.com/a/JGc4GMM). For that one, I used Norris' Q2 time in Jeddah against Piastri's Q3 time, and used both of their Q2 times for Baku
* For Austria, I used Norris' first Q3 lap for comparison since Piastri was unable to get a second lap due to the yellow flag. Their actual gap in that qualifying was over 0.5s. if you’re curious what the graph would look like [I made another alternate here](https://imgur.com/a/qZrsiOd).
* I made both grand prix only and sprint inclusive versions to get a full picture of the entire season, since I know sprints are not usually considered in qualifying head-to-head records but ultimately still do show a trend on how teammates compare in a qualifying context. 

Let me know if you spot anything that doesn't look right in my numbers or methodology. I just thought it was interesting to visualize, interested to hear others' thoughts.","[""Cool comparison and it's interesting to see the way the tide shifted so dramatically\xa0\n\n\nI\xa0would say it's probably better to treat the data consistently unless you are going to have a more comprehensive cleaning process.

Norris got the feel back and stopped messing up q3s', 'i actually would argue that lando being faster in jeddah DOES represent his pace that weekend. through practice and indeed through early qualifying he looked like the faster driver!', ""I feel like everyone forgets the completely new suspension design they brought in Austria. They made significant changes between seasons to reduce the front dive that suited Oscar (he drives more with tires) than Lando (drives more with steering) because Lando couldn't feel the car as well in the steering because of the stiffness.

When that does likely happen, it will be pretty historic that ends of run of dominance by Red Bull and Mercedes. 

Norris/Lando would break the F1 WDC record of longest conscience wins by the same two constructors. A Red Bull or Mercedes driver has won last the 14 WDC among Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, and Max Verstappen. It also inches McLaren closer to tying Ferrari’s F1 leading 15 WDC by a constructor. 

The next closest run was from 1984-1993 when McLaren and Williams won 10 straight WDC with Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, and Nigel Mansell

It will stop another record from being broken as Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton are tied for the longest WDC consecutive streak of the same 2 drivers at 7 years. This is tied with Juan Manuel Fangio and Alberto Ascari also winning 7 straight years from 1951-1957

Maybe it’s because McLaren has had the fastest car on the grid for about a season and a half now, but this will truly mark an end of dominate era of F1. Feels like it’s not as big of a deal, but it truly is. Redbull and Mercedes have dominated the hybrid era (and the final stages of the V8 era) with so many changes over the last 14 years including the cost cap, ground effect being reintroduced, the mandating of the halo cockpit, the ever increasing size of the F1 car, DRS system, banning in-race refueling, etc.  Jensen Button’s winning car from 2009 looks so different and operated in such a different environment from the McLaren that will be on display likely soon. 

Obviously there is a chance that this is just a blip and Red Bull and Mercedes nail the 2026 regulations and Max Vertstappen still does indeed exist. Does just go to show how remarkable Red Bull and Mercedes run is given all the changes and still staying dominant and even the streak Verstappen and Hamilton have been on.

I think I’m really going to try and enjoy the last few races of the season because this is shaping up to be a historic season as I outlined and it could mark the end of an era.

1oxiezc,How many rounds will it take for Audi to score their first points in Formula 1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oxiezc/how_many_rounds_will_it_take_for_audi_to_score/,2025-11-15, Discussion,"As a huge supporter of Audi motorsport, I am extremely excited for the new Audi entry into Formula 1. I want your guys' opinion on how much success we will have next year. Historically, first-year works teams have done quite poorly, but I think there are too many experienced and talented people for this to be a complete flop. My prediction is it will take until the fourth round, at Bahrain, but those more knowledgeable than me I'm sure can give me a reality check. Obviously this is all hypothetical, and nobody really has any idea what will happen, but I like thinking about it anyway. I was gonna wait until near the start of the season for this post, but with all the hype surrounding Audi and the early launch this week, I thought I'd do it now. Maybe I'll repost it closer to the start of the season when there's more information to actually go off of.","['Nico will catch a p8 by race 3.
