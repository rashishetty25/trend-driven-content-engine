While the immediate impetus for the renovations is the arrival of MotoGP in 2027, the ultimate goal is far more ambitious: to return the pinnacle of motorsport to Argentinian soil after an absence of over two decades from the calendar.\n\nThe project\'s master plan has been designed by Hermann Tilke, the renowned German engineer responsible for numerous modern Formula 1 circuits. His proposal, selected from several alternatives, foresees the construction of a new track measuring almost five kilometres, incorporating contemporary safety standards and significant design modifications.\n\nWhile the new circuit will achieve FIA Grade 2 homologation — a prerequisite for hosting top-level international competitions — this is still insufficient for the immediate return of Formula 1, which requires Grade 1 certification. Nevertheless, the authorities view this as a stepping stone towards achieving that goal in the near future.\n\n\'We have a two-phase plan. The first phase is for MotoGP in 2027, and the second phase is for Formula 1. This involves upgrading to a full A licence for the FIM and achieving Grade 1 status for the F1. It\'s not just about technical issues and all the requirements we have; it\'s also about the walls and the fenders. All of this should result in a very good and exciting circuit,"" Hermann Tilke explained at the official announcement event, which SoyMotor.com attended via our Latin American correspondent, Daniel Panelo.\n\nThe remodelling will have a profound effect on the appearance of the Buenos Aires layout. Historic bends such as Vivorita, Cajón, Ombú, Tobogán Traverso and the S for Senna will be redesigned and removed to create a safer, more fluid design. However, the names of these bends will live on, as they will be used to christen curves and sections of the new course.\n\nThe Curvón Salotto and Chicana de Ascari area, on the other hand, will remain unchanged, preserving a part of circuit number 12 which is familiar to fans of national motor racing.\n\nThe project is being led by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires in collaboration with private promoters such as the OSD Group. In addition to the layout modifications, improvements to infrastructure, safety and access will be made, including new kerbs, optimised drainage, tyre protection, electrical upgrades and grandstands with a capacity of up to 120,000 spectators.\n\n\\[...\\]']",465,68,0.95,465,49,49,22,1,0.0,22

If so, this will set them apart from the other manufacturers: Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull\'s partnership with Ford.\n\nBach made it clear that Honda is going its own way when it comes to the battery circuit.

There is speculation in the paddock that the power unit in partnership with Ford may not perform as well as expected.\n\nThere are still a few months to go before the best-kept secret is revealed: the performance and reliability of next year\'s power units.

But in the grand scheme of things, it\'s a very minor change.\n\n> ""Directionally, it should help, but the way I looked at it, or still look at it, is that is such a minor thing and we\'ve had some upgrades in the last races, we\'ve had other things to work on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen was this interview? I was under the impression he already tried it in FP, or is this just his way of saying trying it in the race?', '>""While that\'s not a big deal, I would rather keep it [the front suspension set-up] the same and get as accurate a read I can on the other big things we are changing, and I\'ve not particularly felt the need to go in that direction.\n\nI think a fair amount of people had completely taken this situation to nirvana with the outcry that McLaren is being biased by **forcing** Piastri to change to the new suspension in that recent news spike. \n\nPiastri has explained that there were issues with the MCL-39 as well, but his problems were not as pronounced as Norris\'s. And this article is the answer to the proposed suspension change. My understanding of his POV is that he is able to work with the current suspension that he has been using thus far, and if it is guaranteeing consistency and fair results on his end, he is able to focus on other aspects of the car that could use improving, and it does not compromise his performance either \n\nWhatever McLaren opts to do with their suspension scenario is up to their own prerogative, considering they have a better read of their situation than I do, but I am still pretty darn proud of the trajectory McLaren has had over the course of the few years, and the fact McLaren has stated that they are trying to settle any issues with their cars as soon as it is identified is admirable as well', 'Because the update suits Lando and he doesn’t want to yield advantage to his closest rival. So obvious that an article is unnecessary. All drivers in hunt for title are selfish. They’d rather be the only driver in the team that matters.', 'To add a bit more detail, the precise word he used was unpredictable, something he also said the team has managed to overcome with setup etc. Stella has discussed in earlier interviews that this means it is difficult to replicate the same performance or behaviour from the car in successive laps. Why that is so is perhaps only a matter of speculation, but the closest explanation the team has offered is a lack of ‘cuing’, which roughly refers to feedback offered from the car during turn-in, generally through the steering wheel, an issue firmly placed by many on the new front-suspension.\n\nHowever, what I find interesting is that Oscar mentioned the unpredictability issue while refusing the new front suspension. This suggests to me that perhaps the unpredictability issue he’s referring to is either unrelated to the front suspension, or more likely that he has managed to understand the car’s behaviour better than Lando because he ‘feels’ the car in a different way, i.e not primarily through steering feedback. Fascinating stuff either way.', 'I liked the insight that he doesn’t want to try the new front suspension because it adds a variable to the car on top of other upgrades they’ve added, and he’d rather have a clear baseline for assessing those first. \n\nAlso his comment that he would consider trying it (again) later in the season… which maybe means if he ends up behind Norris in the WDC and needs to take more risks. Unless of course this is PR speak for basically he’ll try it if McLaren require him to adopt it.', 'So basically what every driver from every top team has been saying all year.', 'There was an article that said Oscar also tried the updated front suspension in free practice in Canada, but I agree that it’s unclear because Oscar’s own words on the topic makes it sound like he hasn’t tried it yet. Perhaps Oscar means he hasn’t tried it for a full weekend?', 'Yeah he def used it in Canada FP1. I take it to mean try it in a race/across a whole race weekend.', ""Yeah this was an interesting talking point from earlier. Lando relies on feedback from his hands, while oscar relies on feedback from his feet. Last year, the suspension was set up to give feedback to the hands, which is why lando excelled and Oscar struggled. This year, the car was set up for feedback to go to the feet, hence oscar's early domination, while lando was giving statements like he's learning to drive again. A new suspension update a few races back was introduced specifically to tackle this for lando, which led to his form picking up again. Oscar, of course, is holding off because it would affect him negatively.""]",147,18,0.92,147,17,17,49,3,0.010000000000000009,49

1m6ddho,Why are there so many engine rules ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m6ddho/why_are_there_so_many_engine_rules/,2025-07-22, Discussion,"The title.

The most obvious reasons are all the rules related to safety: for example, limiting the power of engines put a limit on how fast the cars are going, and on how fast they accelerate, which helps safety. Several rules on batteries and electric motors also are there for safety purpose.

Some other rules are there to help engines reliability: limiting piston speed, rev/min of engines... however, i think the engine quotas we have today might be enough to force teams to create reliable engines.

Similarly, some rules are there to limit cost of engines and prevent a money burning race. But in the era where we have cost-caps, i think those also are not needed anymore.

We also have rules about fuel efficiency, to help F1 (and their oil sponsors) do greenwashing (/hj). However we also have an allowed fuel limit per race, which i think should be enough to cover this part.

Overall, having a lot of rules limit how the engine manufacturers can innovate on engines, and i'm not sure this is a good thing ( r/changemyview ). Why don't we get rid of most of those specific rules about having X number of cylinders, a turbo, those specific energy recovering things, no energy recovery on this part of the car, enforcing a battery of that specific amount of power, etc...

I think that in addition to allow manufacturers to innovate more, this will also close the debate around v6, v10, hybrid, and all that things. Just tell the manufacturers ""Develop an engine, maximum 800HP, and that consume at most 80L of fuel in a race. You're limited to 4 full engines per year, start from the back every time you use one more"" (figures out of my a\*s, you get the idea). And let them cook the best engine with those requirements. Obviously, some rules regarding safety must be added to avoid battery fires, catastrophic failures, this kind of stuff. But most of the rules we have today are not about safety.","[""Because that's what the engine manufacturers want. If you remove all rules other than max power, there'll be mass spending until they find the meta layout and then everybody will use that, all one/two manufacturers left that is."", 'If everything is allowed then rules will be implemented once one team becomes too dominant and revenue decreases.  Ultimately it’s about making an entertaining product that makes people money; and the people making money have to be happy to stay in.', 'Look up what the “Formula” in “Formula 1” actually means.', 'You hit the nail on the head, it is about limiting innovation.\n\nInnovation costs money and raises performance without improving the show.\n\nEngines are far more restrictive now to stop rampant spending and dramatic performance gains of previous regulations.', 'Fun idea. Formula SAE / Student does this by just giving upper limits to power and fuel as well as the safety rules. Then teams just pick an engine (since the students can’t build one from scratch with cost, reliability and safety issues). Some teams go with 4 cylinder, some with 2, and use different mfgs and models. But in the end you can design and tune your car around a specific engine which makes all the cars more unique. \n\nBut in F1 it’s not that easy. \nThe cost cap was put in place to close the gap between the teams. Removing the “unnecessary” engine rules would counteract that. You’d likely end up with one engine manufacturer having “the best” engine, and one team building the best car around it. Then wildly different outcomes for the other teams. There’s so many more choices to make and things that could go wrong if you leave the major engine design aspects open. There’d be much bigger car performance gaps.\n\nAlso if you removed the rules today, a lot of manufactures would probably just stick with the engines they have now rather than gamble on a big change like V10 / V12. There’s so much risk in changing to one of those and cost to develop them. And it’s not a simple engineering question to determine which one is better. If they all started from scratch it would work, but not now.\n\nAnother reason for the current engines is so the engine manufacturers can (or at least claim to) use some of the same engine technology and advances for their road cars. They don’t want to spend tons of cash to develop an engine that they could only use for F1.', '“having a lot of rules limit how the engine manufacturers can innovate on engines”\n\nOr it could be quite the opposite. Because there are so many rules, PU suppliers must innovate even harder to create comparative advantages in a tight field.', 'We have complex engine regulations because there are many different stakeholders who all sign off on the rules with many having different, competing, interests.\n\nThe FIA (or FOM) do not set the rules in a vacuum.\n\nThe engine manufacturers also highly influence the rules, using the threat of turning away from F1, if they don’t get what they want at minimum.\n\nHowever, there are several competing engine manufacturers, who all have different interests, with the biggest being preventing the competition getting any leg up in leveraging their IP.\n\nThe rules are created by committee, because there is a commercial necessity for it to be created like that.', ""I do feel like there's a bunch of things that needs to be sunset in the formula and I for one would be happy with a less limiting formula for engines, but it's sorta hard to make that converge."", 'I honestly think the way the rules are set up right now is for the better.  \nGot nothing to add though as everything has been said by others down below in the comments already.']",0,30,0.34,0,29,29,0,3,0.010000000000000009,0
