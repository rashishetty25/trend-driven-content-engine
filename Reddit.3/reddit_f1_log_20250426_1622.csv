1k87mty,Teams worried about Madrid circuit,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k87mty/teams_worried_about_madrid_circuit/,2025-04-26, News,,"['Well, when the promotional video shows the car hitting the wall at turns 4+5 I think they have the right to be concerned.', ""As a spanish speaker, 'Madring' is such a fucking terrible name, I hope they change it because it sounds so goddamn awful."", ""As someone from Madrid, I expected them to either build a new track or modify Jarama to fit the current F1 cars. Never in a million years it'd have occurred to me to use the streets around IFEMA to race, it's just such a boring place filled with roundabouts. I wish they'd let Montmelo host until we have a proper circuit."", 'Just leave it, we have Barcelona already. It is Spain and a building project.', 'It actually takes skill to design a race track that terrible', '# Teams worried about Madrid circuit\n\n*The teams are worried. The Madring adventure is complex, and it is well known that it is behind schedule in certain areas. But until now, the only people complaining have been residents, local and regional government opposition, and some politicians. Now, however, it is the teams themselves who are beginning to ask uncomfortable questions.*\n\nIt happened last Sunday in Shanghai. Teams regularly meet with representatives of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l\'Automobile (FIA), and the Chinese Grand Prix was no exception.\n\nThe agenda was devoid of technical issues and was dominated by a review of the sporting regulations for the rest of this year and 2026. Several changes to the regulations were proposed, such as what happens when there are starts after the safety car, some clarification on wet racing rules and the possibility of opening a closed park after the sprint race.\n\nAt one point during the meeting, the representative of one of the groups raised his hand and asked if there was any news about the CAD of the Madrid circuit, the future IFEMA street circuit. The curt reply from the FIA representatives was that it had not yet been approved and that they had no information to share with the participants.\n\nCAD is the computerized design used by the teams to analyze the different possibilities, with exact measurements, angles, cambers, distances, etc. The skeleton explanation given by the FIA commissioner makes it doubtful that they will be able to get hold of each team\'s internal programmes in time.\n\nThe teams need all this information as soon as possible. They want to start analyzing parameters such as the fast corners to check the aerodynamic possibilities, the slow ones to adjust the suspension, fuel consumption or downforce over the whole track. They want to arrive with their homework done.\n\nThe task is made even more difficult by the fact that next year there will be completely different aerodynamics with two DRS modes, front and rear, the so-called X and Z modes. The drivers must work on this in the simulator, and now they don\'t even know the exact dimensions of the track, the layout beyond the pictures published in the media, or even the location of the garages. They don\'t know the exact shape of the paddock, where the trucks will be, where the hospitality areas will be, or something as simple as where the plugs will be.\n\n**The teams, blind**\n\n""We\'re going in blind with Madrid,"" a source who wishes to remain anonymous told Motor.es. People are starting to get nervous and the general feeling is that they are late. The teams are not going to complain directly because the FIA is the interlocutor in these matters. The teams put pressure on the FIA and the FIA puts pressure on the circuit to speed things up.\n\nWhen it comes to a new track, the process requires a laser scan of the surface and translating all that data into the simulators. Then you work on it and draw conclusions, data and strategic forecasts, which can even affect the logistics.\n\nThe situation is the same for everyone, but until they have reliable data to work with, they will not be happy. The clock is ticking, the dates are ticking, and the cars of 2026 need a mountain of data. Nobody wants to be left behind, and this should be a wake-up call for the deadlines, which should be different for one of the most original and eye-catching projects of recent years.', 'I have the feeling no race will ever take place there.

1k86rtd,Fernando Alonso's insane consistency between 2003 and 2008,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k86rtd/fernando_alonsos_insane_consistency_between_2003/,2025-04-26, Discussion,"I have been a long-standing F1 fan who witnessed both of Fernando's title winning seasons but I don't think as a kid I realized or recognized how great he was during the 2000s. I was also a Raikkonen fan so my hatred towards Alonso probably had something to do with it as well. I analyzed his points tally season by season and recognized ain interesting pattern between 2003 and 2008. Here's my takeaways:

\- The period between 2003 and 2008 spanned 106 races in total

\- In those 106 races Fernando failed to score 23 times, 18 of which were DNFs. 5 of his DNFs were mistakes on his own (Monza 2004, Montreal 2005, Fuji 2007, Montreal 2008, Valencia 2008). He was running in the points on each occasion apart from Valencia, where the collision with Nakajima happened on Lap 1 after the start. Every other DNFs were due to technical issues with the car.

\- In those 106 races Alonso failed to finish the race in the points only on 5(!) occasions, 3 of which occured in 2008: Silverstone 2004, Budapest 2005, Sakhir 2008, Monte Carlo 2008, Hockenheim 2008.

\- In 2003, Fernando either finished in the points or didn't finish at all due to reliability issues. Don't forget this was his first season in a competitive car after spending 2002 on the sidelines. He finished in P6 in the WDC.

\- In 2005, he failed to score 3 times: Montreal, Indianapolis and Budapest. In Montreal, he hit the wall, which was his only mistake that year. We all know what happened in Indy, and he had his front wing damaged by Ralf Schumacher after the start in Budapest which resulted in a scrappy race for Alonso. Otherwise, his worst finishing position was 4th in Monaco.

\- In 2006, he would have finished every race in the points, had it not been for that wheel nut issue in Budapest and the engine failure in Monza. He had those 2 DNFs, and finished 5th in Hockenheim and Indianapolis, but he was in the top 2 on every other occasion. (7 wins and 7 P2s).

\- In 2007, he finished in the points every race weekend, bar that mistake in the rain in Fuji.

\- Renault started 2008 on the backfoot, but Alonso was in the top 4 in the last 6 races, and finished 5th in WDC.

  
I think that's insane consistency for someone who started racing competitively in F1 in 2003. Those were his first 6 years racing wheel to wheel at the front. Many may argue that 2003-2008 wasn't even his peak with regards to his capabilities, and they might have a fair point considering how he performed during his Ferrari years. I don't think newer fans or even some older ones (like me) realize what a great performance he showed so early in his career. I truly hope that I can see him win at least one more time!

He just seems like a genuinely good guy too. Its actually quite surprising considering how few F1 drivers Australia has, the 3 drivers in the last 2 decades have all found their way to front running teams and won races."", ""I'll die on the hill that Webber was one of the quickest drivers in F1 during the Michelin era.\n\nHis 2006 season was about underrated as they come. He was on for an easy podium in Melbourne, another one at the European GP, and he was fuel corrected on pole for Monaco that year and setting a faster qualifying lap when Schumacher parked (which is also true for a few other drivers that race). He was on course to potentially win Monaco as he was fuelled longer in the race, but that Williams was an absolute hand grenade of a car. \n\nHe was fuel corrected on pole for the German GP in 2005 too, but BMW wanted a German driver on pole so they put less fuel in Heidfelds car, and Williams strategy didn't help at Monaco that year either, pitting Heidfield first to get him out ahead, despite Webber being the lead driver in that race.\n\nInteresting, if not a surface level fact, is that Webber lead Vettel at the halfway point in 3 out of the 5 seasons they were together. Not bad for a guy well into his 30s up against the Red Bull prodigy.\n\nTake nothing away from Vettel though, he was the better of the two over their years as teammates. Webber himself said he'd have rather raced against Vettel at 25 than when he was 35.\n\nOne interesting note in Neweys book is that he thought Webber's departure had a significant impact on their 2014 performance. We all know the Renault was poor, but Newey said they also lost of a lot of laptime from Webber's feedback during testing and practise sessions. He said he was one of the best drivers for feedback that he worked with.\n\nI think Webber's talent can be summed up best by the fact that both Red Bull and Ferrari had offered him contracts for the 2014 season, and McLaren were reportedly interested too.\n\nPorsche came knocking and Webber was always a huge Porsche fan, so it was a no brainer for him to retire from F1 at that time."", '""The pub he owns is part of his retirement plan.""\n\nI think Oscar\'s possible WDCs will play a bigger financial role in his retirement than a small pub.\n\nThanks for posting OP, that was a fun flashback.', 'Korea 2010 was a painful moment', 'I remember when Mark was trying to cut his weight down because he‚Äôs tall for a driver.

They know the other teams can hear thier messages, can they say something that is so ""loud"" that other engineers will be forced to tell thier drivers?

Or are things like that Illegal?","['Legal and Hamilton especially did it with the ""Bono my tyres are gone"" shtick.\n\n\nRadio messages are never going to work for safety car restarts, everyone knows it\'s bullshit because there\'s no value add from telling the engineer.', 'Yeah, its legal and pretty much everyone does it. They use coded language to converse with their engineers for some specific matters. Sometimes obvious stuff like ""Plan C plus 4"" asking for a specific pit strategy with 4 additional laps after the planned stop, or some cryptic specific phrasing that might tell the driver to box but in reality the driver knows its a fake pitstop and they want to stay out and get a reaction from an opponent.', 'Yes, there have been times where there have been radio messages that sounded like they were for this exact reason - a bit of gamesmanship. Pretty much anytime we get the, ‚Äúbox to overtake X‚Äù message I feel like it‚Äôs just the team trying to bait the other team to pit their driver early. Or an engineer will say, ‚ÄúX is complaining about their tyres‚Äù and the driver will respond ‚Äúmy tyres are fine.‚Äù Or the opposite, the driver will complain about having no grip, then when their rival pits they suddenly say they can stay out and their tyres are good. I feel like I remember this happening between Hamilton and Verstappen a couple times.', 'Yes.
