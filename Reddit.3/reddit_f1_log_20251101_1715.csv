1ol5064,New Colapinto collaboration with Mercado Libre - hints at signing,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ol5064/new_colapinto_collaboration_with_mercado_libre/,2025-10-31, Video,,"['Was kind of hoping the ad would show Franco as a delivery driver, given the fact that his Alpine is a delivery van.', 'If the deal comes with free shipping to the paddock, he’s already winning.', 'Just get Mercado Libre to be the main sponsor.  We could do with a Yellow car Again.', ""This is several days old and afaik clipped from backstage stuff from the livery ad (And a joke about the original announcement he'd be back)\n\nNon-news to the max, said as someone that wants him back"", ""I don't see what alpine gains by not renewing Colapinto at this stage. He brings money. He's fast. Matching Gasly. Their issue is not the drivers. It's the 1.0 TDi at the back of their car."", 'Colapinto started off badly but right now I think he’s doing a lot better in a car that’s being left for dead. Hope for his and Gasly’s sake that Alpine get their shit together next year.', 'They are really milking this cow for all the news articles it can give huh?\n\nAfter this I expect a flood of RB speculation articles to come in the coming weeks', 'Mercado libre means free market? Is Javier Millei behind this sponsorship?', 'Doohan never had a chance vs Colapinto and the money he brings', 'Good, he deserves it, doing a much better job than Doohan did /s…']",135,40,0.86,135,468,468,4,1,-0.010000000000000009,4
