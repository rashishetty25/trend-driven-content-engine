1j4aai5,"Motorsport UK Chair, David Richards CBE, expresses Motorsport UK‚Äôs position in regard to the global governance of the sport",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j4aai5/motorsport_uk_chair_david_richards_cbe_expresses/,2025-03-05, News,,"['Dear Licence Holders, Clubs, Officials and Volunteers,\n\nAs your Chair, I‚Äôve always believed, along with the Board and\nemployees of Motorsport UK, that we are answerable to you\nin respect of all our actions. After all, our task is to serve the\nbest interests of motorsport in this country and represent\nyou, our members. In my role as a member of the World Motor\nSport Council I‚Äôm also accountable to the full FIA membership\nworldwide and this letter has equal relevance to them.\nFor some time now I‚Äôve had concerns about the erosion of\naccountability and good governance within the FIA. As you\nmay have seen in the press, an issue has recently emerged\nthat has compelled me to take a stand and needs an\nexplanation.\n\nFirst of all, let me turn the clock back to a little over three\nyears ago when we, alongside the Royal Automobile Club,\nsupported Mohammed Ben Sulayem in his bid to become\nthe next President of the FIA. Many of you were possibly\nsurprised that we didn‚Äôt support the British candidate, Graham\nStoker, but the Board met with both candidate teams and was\nconvinced by the well thought out plans that Mohammed‚Äôs\ncampaign team presented, which very much aligned with our\nown views of the way the FIA should transform itself.\n\nThe key messages in their presentation were:\n\n* A hands-off President who would be non-executive and\ndelegate the day-to-day running of the FIA to a professional\nexecutive team\n* The appointment of an empowered and capable CEO to run\nthe FIA to professional standards\n* Full transparency of actions and the highest standards of\nsporting governance\n\nI‚Äôm afraid that over the last three years there has been a\ndistinct failure to meet these promises. In fact, the situation\nhas progressively worsened with media reports confirming\nthat numerous senior members of the FIA and volunteer\nofficials have either been fired or have resigned under an\nopaque cloud. Furthermore, the scope of the Audit and\nEthics Committees has been severely limited and now\nlacks autonomy from the authority of the President, while\nour UK representative, who challenged certain matters,\nwas summarily removed along with the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee. Various techniques have also been deployed with\nthe effect of limiting the proper function of the World Motor\nSport Council, primarily the use of e-voting which removes the opportunity for much needed discussion and debate on key\nsubjects.\n\nThis has become increasingly worrying and the final straw\nfor me, three weeks ago, was being asked to sign a new\nconfidentiality agreement that I regarded as a ‚Äògagging order‚Äô.\nAt the time of my appointment to the World Motor Sport\nCouncil in 2021 I signed a confidentiality agreement and in\nfact was already bound by Article 4 of the FIA Code of Ethics.\nI remain committed to my confidentiality obligations under\nthis existing agreement and Article 4, which remain in effect.\nHowever, the new confidentiality agreement went far further\nthan this and, at a week‚Äôs notice, I was told that if I didn‚Äôt sign\nit, I would be barred from the next World Motor Sport Council\nmeeting.\n\nThe key clauses I objected to were:\n\n* Everything was now considered confidential, without any\nqualification, preventing me from necessarily sharing what I considered to be relevant information\n* The FIA, at its own discretion, could decide if anyone\nbreached the terms of the new confidentiality agreement\nwith no process or frame of reference\n* There was an immediate fine of ‚Ç¨50,000 for any breach and\na threat of undisclosed damages\n\nThe construction of this new confidentiality agreement does\nnot comply with the Statutes of the FIA and contradicts\nthe promise of transparent governance we had voted for.\nI therefore asked that we debate the matter at the World\nMotor Sport Council, which was just days away, rather than\nhaving it forced upon us as a condition of attendance.\n\nMy request, along with those of a few other Members who\nshared our views, was denied and we were barred from\nattending the meeting. This was in total breach of the FIA\nstatutes that require all elected members be given full access\nto meetings. I should point out that I kept the Board of\nMotorsport UK fully informed throughout to ensure that I had\ntheir complete support.\n\nOur Motorsport UK lawyers, along with our French Legal\nCounsel, have challenged the FIA on their actions by setting\nout a clear set of questions that the FIA leadership needs to\nanswer. It is very disappointing to report that we have still\nnot received an answer to these or the fundamental question\nI raised: where in the FIA Statutes does it provide for an\nelected member to be barred from a meeting? (1/2)', ""For those who didn't read, this is an open letter by David Richards (one of those kicked out of the FIA meeting), publicly calling out MBS and the lack of transparency from the FIA lately.\n\nTL; Dr David Richards, Chairman of Motorsport UK, has expressed serious concerns about the governance of the FIA under President Mohammed Ben Sulayem. Despite initial support for Ben Sulayem's reform agenda, David notes a failure to deliver on promises of transparency and accountability.

Motorsport UK has legally challenged these actions, emphasizing the need for integrity and transparency. Richards warns of further legal action if issues remain unaddressed, stressing the importance of upholding governance standards ahead of the FIA's presidential election."", ""If this is true (not saying I doubt it), then it's laughable and downright egregious that MBS has not adhered to any of it, especially the first point.

The front suspension of an F1 car is designed to keep the car stable under braking. One way teams achieve this is by using an ‚Äúanti-dive‚Äù suspension layout (like in the MCL39), which reduces how much the car‚Äôs nose dips forward during braking. But this design choice comes with a trade-off. In a normal suspension setup, the forces from braking and cornering are spread out more evenly across the suspension components. Whereas with an anti-dive layout, certain parts of the suspension (higher-up) take on much greater forces because they are working harder to resist that forward movement of the car. This puts more stress on the components and the only way to make this design reliable is to use stronger materials potentially making it a bulkier setup.', '> In fact, Red Bull technical director Pierre Wache made an eyebrow-raising observation in Bahrain - in suggesting that McLaren may have taken a bit of a gamble with its front suspension.\n\n> Speaking to The Race, Wache said: ‚ÄúThe suspension of the McLaren is very interesting ‚Äì in terms of kinematics.

If Nico Hulkenberg ends up at the bottom of the standings this year because the Sauber isn‚Äôt competitive, it doesn‚Äôt really mean he isn‚Äôt a great driver (He‚Äôs consistently been a strong midfield driver). 

At the same time Hamilton, Max, Seb and other WDC winners have benefited from having a strong car. That shouldn‚Äôt take anything away from their achievements either because you could have the best car but being unable to extract what the car provides could hurt you.

But using data (or otherwise), is there a good way of estimating the impact of someone‚Äôs skills as a driver and how that eventually impacts their standings on the grid?

I‚Äôm big into statistics within Formula One, but lap times and other metrics also have the factor of the car‚Äôs strengths/weaknesses baked into it so it‚Äôs hard to quantify how someone is really performing. It would be easy if everyone had the same machinery (Like Alonso once suggested ha!).

The drivers on the grid are so competitive, that the difference between them might be smaller than what we perceive. The simplest comparison for me so how you fare against your teammate, but then again it‚Äôs in a limited sphere of a single team.

Thanks and would love to hear folks‚Äô thoughts on this.","['Depends on if I like the driver or not.', ""I don't think we truly can. Too many race-affecting variables to consider,  and a lot of secrecy around the cars and drivers. Also, sometimes it really is down to luck, for better or worse."", ""You basically can't, so we search for the next best thing(s). Are they consistent? Do they beat their teammates? How do they perform in changeable weather conditions? How does the rest of the paddock talk about them?"", 'I imagine team principals have a good idea on who is truly skilled and what not based on all the data they have. Truly generational or skilled drivers will always stand out no matter what car they are in.', 'Junior record, comparison vs teammates and the teammates comparison vs other drivers, your judgement on the speed and driveability of the car etc.', 'From the outside, there\'s really not much we can do. We can see the teammate comparisons and when driver moves team, you can correlate them.\n\nBut that is not precise science at all, there are probably another hundreds of variables to take into consideration: driver\'s familiarity with their car, how much does their car suit the driver\'s default driving style, how much does a certain track suit the car and how much does the track suit the driver, how good the setup works are from their team, driver\'s own growth over the years, as well as normal fluctuation in their form...\n\nSo if you were to quantify this, a certain driver\'s ""power score"" might be ""91.2 +/- 1.5"" and another driver\'s might be ""89.7 +/- 3.6"" (numbers don\'t mean anything -- I\'m just using it to make the point). That errorbar depends on all those factors mentioned above. The 89.7 driver may very well seem to be better than the 91.2 driver because he\'s driving a car more suited to him. So in many cases, we might think the driver is  worse (better) than he really is because he never get to drive a car that suit (doesn\'t suit) his style.\n\nIf you\'re an engineer from a team, you have way more data and probably could break this down into much much more details, you\'d probably have insights like ""driver A is generally X% better than driver B in this type of corners, when the car is setup in this way"", and then you can probably do a weighted average to get the whole picture between driver A and driver B if you\'d like to\n\nWith the amount of lap time data we (as outsiders) have, you can probably do this analysis as well, but it probably will be so inaccurate that it really doesn\'t mean anything', ""fans probably don't know shit but drivers and team principles and those intermittently involved know"", 'It helps to see them drive in the wet.

Which team wins the WCC?

Ferrari. I think both Lewis and Charles finish in the top 4 of the drivers standings 

Who wins the WDC?

Max Verstappen in the closest Championship since 2021. I think 3 drivers will still have a chance at the Championship with 2 races left.

Biggest surprise this season?

Kimi Antonelli. I think he beats his teammate George Russell at Mercedes and finishes no lower than 6th in the World Drivers Championship. It may take him a few races but George will be the #1 driver at Mercedes very long.
