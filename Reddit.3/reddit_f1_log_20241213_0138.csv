1hctnit,Sergio Perez brings an estimated $30-40 million USD in merchandise and sponsorships alone whilst Verstappen lost sponsorships for Red Bull in 2024. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hctnit/sergio_perez_brings_an_estimated_3040_million_usd/,2024-12-12, Statistics,"Dutch supermarket Jumbo [withdrew](https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1043062/1/verstappen-s-longtime-sponsors-explain-why-deal-ended) its financial support this year and while Verstappen still has personal sponsorhips, they're not directly tied to Red Bull. 

As for the Perez-specific Red Bull sponsors, they reportedly cover Perez's approximately $10 million annual salary and still leave $30m extra for the team and according to the Spanish sports newspaper [Marca](https://www.marca.com/en/f1/2024/11/10/673136f822601d8e4a8b4574.html), multiple new sponsors for 2025 have now signed up with Red Bull. Horner is said to have just given the green light to start production of 2025-spec team clothing and merchandise featuring the new sponsors' names, and one of them is a big, major sponsor that will join the likes of Grupo Carso (Carlos Slim's group). 

Basically, Checo is bringing enough sponsorship money to pay for half of Max's salary -- perhaps more! 

That's why Checo's group is asking around £15.7m (some sources have them at $75m USD!) to leave the team because they would definitely need to pay up all those sponsors who have already signed on for 2025. That's a lot of money just to have the privilege to put Lawson in that seat. 

Can Red Bull sustain the loss of Checo's backing? Perhaps but if they really wanted Lawson or even Ricciardo in that seat, they could've already cut Checo and their sponsors loose (incluing Disney and Ford).

The deal will bring one of the world’s biggest motor-racing brands and MotoGP — often described as the two-wheeled equivalent of Formula 1 — under a single roof.\n\n>In-depth EU probes typically add about 90 working days to deal reviews — but can drag on, for example if regulators stop the clock to demand further data. The EU’s antitrust arm usually demands remedies to solve competition concerns but sometimes also decide to give their unconditional approval if initial concerns are shown to be unfounded.\n\n>Heightened scrutiny can also lead to firms walking away from planned acquisitions. Under the terms of the deal, Liberty would have to pay Dorna €126 million if it ends up withdrawing from the takeover.\n\n>Regulators have previously raised concerns over drawing both sporting brands together. CVC Capital Partners Ltd. was forced to put MotoGP up for sale nearly two decades ago to gain antitrust approval from European regulators for its takeover of Formula 1 in 2005.\n\n>MotoGP is just the latest asset to be taken over by billionaire John Malone’s sprawling Liberty Media empire that already includes a wide range of media, communications and entertainment businesses such as concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment Inc.\n\n>Since buying F1 in 2016, Liberty Media has targeted key markets including the US, attempted to grow the sport’s popularity through digital streaming and struck gold with the show Drive to Survive."", 'I predicted this would happen lol, not the first time F1 tried to buy MotoGP.', ""Can't read.

For example, at the end of 2020, Max had 10 wins. I also made a chart showing how many race winning seasons each driver had before their first championship winning season, as well as the total number of seasons at that point. I also made these charts for every non-WDC race winner on the 2025 grid, to see how the compare historically. Hope you enjoy and checkout my comment for some fun tidbits.","['I’m so bummed that Bottas isn’t a current driver on these charts anymore', ""I made these charts after seeing a comment that pointed out that Max only had 10 race wins before 2021. This made me wonder: how many wins did the other champions have before their first championship winning season? The results shocked me a bit: despite Max being considered quite young and inexperienced before 2021, historically speaking he was one of the most experienced winners before starting his championship winning season. In my mind this shows how good he was in inferior machinery during the Merc domination.\n\nLastly, an important note: even if a driver only did 1 race in a season, that is still counted as a season. I can’t be arsed to judge where the limit for a partaking in a season goes, especially with all of the drivers who did like 2 races a season back in the 50’s and 60’s.\n\nNow for the fun facts:\n\nMax Verstappen is the only driver to have more than 7 victories before starting his first championship winning season who hadn't finished runners up or been in a proper championship fight.\xa0\n\nMansell's 21 wins would put him 16th on the all-time win list, tied with Kimi Räikkönen's all time wins. Meanwhile, Prost had the same amount of wins as Stirling Moss, the driver with the most race wins without a championship.\xa0\n\n14 out of 34 drivers had one or no race wins when they started their championship winning season. 20 out 34 WDC had only had either 1 or no race winning seasons before their first championship winning season. In other words, it is fairly common that new F1 champions have a rather limited experience winning races.\n\nHäkkinen and especially Button stand out as drivers with lots of overall experience, Button had 9 seasons before his WDC season, but with very limited race winning experience, only winning one race each. For Mika, it was the 97 season finale, the very race before his first WDC season, and he only won it because of the Schumacher-Villeneuve crash.\xa0\n\nKeke Rosberg is another driver who really stands out. Unlike most drivers without a victory before their first season, who generally won their debut quite early on in the season, Keke’s first victory came in round 14/16 in 1982. Even crazier, had he finished second, he still would have won the championship, and became the only driver to win the championship while never winning a Grand Prix.\xa0\n\nDespite all the talk about Norris being inexperienced in a winning position, should he win the championship next season he would be pretty average on this list. Russell would also be pretty average, while Leclerc would be on the high end. Perez would also be quite high, but if he is even on the grid next year, I’ll eat my cat’s food. Alonso would also be joint 3rd on the all-time list of number of seasons before winning the championship if we start counting from the last time he won a race: 9 seasons of pain…"", 'Looking at this the most mad stat is: Keke Rosbarg had, for a time, was a champion who had won as many championships as he had GPs (he only won 1 race in his championship-winning year).', ""Checo trying to break Mansell's record"", 'This is cool, thanks for sharing! Looks like Leclerc is due for his WDC', 'Fangio 🤜🤛 Villeneuve 🤜🤛 Hamilton', 'Kind of makes sense. You either are deemed too bad and kicked off or eventually make your way to WDC winning machinery.', ""Awesome work, thank you very much! It's not so often I see some new way of viewing the stats that immediately completely changes my own feelings and perceptions - for instance, I didn't see Verstappen as this quite hardened GP winner before his maiden WDC title year, especially compared to Piquet and even Mansell and some others of that other era, 70s and 80s. With your presentation it is much more straightforward now to compare those today to those in the past. My respect for Lando improved a lot seeing your data.

1hcs00b,Has Ben Sulayem overestimated his power?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hcs00b/has_ben_sulayem_overestimated_his_power/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"Ben Sulayem made some interesting comments today about the FIA not having the funds to employ permanent stewards, so I thought I’d share a few thoughts on where his presidency seems to be heading.

Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run. Sulayem’s approach as president has been… combative, to say the least. A lot of his decisions seem more about ego than actually serving the role. He’s alienated key stakeholders and made governance changes that look like attempts to shield himself from accountability, which hasn’t done much for his reputation—or the FIA’s, for that matter.

Honestly, his position feels shaky. The next FIA elections are still a year away, and maybe he won’t face serious opposition, but the level of discontent right now suggests bigger problems within the organization. What we’re seeing play out publicly is probably just the surface.

At the end of the day, his authority isn’t limitless. The drivers and teams are the ones who really hold the power in F1, and history shows they aren’t afraid to push back when they’re unhappy—even to the point of threatening to leave the sport entirely. Sulayem seems to be gambling a lot by antagonizing them, and I’m not sure he fully understands just how strong their influence is.

This whole power struggle seems like it will rumble on over the off season. The longer it drags on, the more damage it could do—not just to his presidency, but to F1 itself.

I’m interested to hear others thoughts on the topic. How do you see this playing out, and could the FIA find itself in real trouble if things don’t change?","[""> Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run.\n\nThat's just sorta politics though, it always looks like something has to give, but the reality is Formula 1 is only a part of the FIA, and only relevant to a few of its wealthiest member nations/constituent clubs of which there are some 250 from 147 countries. Things look to be at a breaking point, then a few things elsewhere get shuffled around in the background and suddenly everyone's happy.\n\nIs F1 important? Is it the single most important FIA activity? Yeah, probably, but as F1 fans we're still only seeing a fraction of the FIA's overall purview. If the Ugandan Karting scene doesn't have the same beef with Sulayem that Formula One does, he's not going to have much problem being reelected."", ""The teams and commercial side breaking away is a popular Reddit power fantasy. The unfortunate reality of it is that the FIA owns F1 both as a series and a brand, and Indycar's shown us that *everyone* is worse off for a split - but especially the commercial side.\n\nThis is why the teams and FOM do not hold the power some people think they do. They can threaten to break away, haggle and negotiate, sure, but a breakaway involves far too much money lost for them to ever really make good on it. The FIA technically isn't a for-profit organisation. That's why the FIA president can get away with just about everything short of murder, and MBS simply hasn't done anything stupid enough to make his position truly untenable."", ""A very important point is that the FIA president first and foremost serves the FIA members and not F1. F1 doesn't have much of a say, the member clubs elect the president and their leadership team. And so far it does in fact not look like Ben Sulayem is in danger of losing reelection next year. I would recommend reading this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5xbgv/jeppe_olesen_on_the_back_of_all_the_mbs/)regarding the FIA presidential elections."", 'I think a lot of folks here want to believe the FIA and MBS is the problem. The issue is likely far more complicated. A lot of the issues are more the problem with the FOM than the FIA. Paying for full time FIA stewards is something that the FIA should address with the FOM. The FIA is a non-profit, it cannot simply ""get revenue and add costs"" from nowhere. The FOM should pay for the full time stewards for F1 and that is a project that the FIA rightly addresses. \n\nThe ENTIRETY of the FIA (including all motorsports not only F1) has about 300 full time employees. Their annual budget runs into the 150-200m Euro range. The annual income after taxes is less than 10m Euro (2023). For comparison this is smaller than a single F1 team\'s annual budget.\n\nIf the FIA has to hire 3-4 full time stewards, fly time to every F1 venue, this would very likely cost them several million Euro a year. It isn\'t hard to see why the FIA needs the FOM to pony up this kind of expense.', 'I’m not sure why he’s being blamed for this when they have *never* had permanent stewards and he is at least starting the conversation around fixing that, albeit with the caveat that the funds have to come from somewhere. Surely this is a reasonable starting point, rather than letting the problem endlessly fester like previous presidents did?\n\nAs for all the resignations and other changes, I still remain open minded as it’s not been very transparent, but the FIA never has been since long before he came in. And any media coverage of him always has a bit of a stink of racism that makes me take it with a pinch of salt. Part of me wonders if he’s just breaking up the old boys club that has been running things without consequence for so long.', ""Hasn't the FIA always been shady? I vaguely remember the whole group B debacle where the FIA was pretty much ignoring spectator and driver deaths since the sport was so popular. And then there was a whole slew of F1 controversies that people were mad about but almost every casual F1 fan has never even heard about those or has forgotten about it. I recon as long as the sport keeps growing he will be kept in the position he is in."", 'As much as MBS is unpopular to fans. Neither was Blatter or Infantino right now for FIFA. David Stern of NBA also was not popular. It took quite a bit of scandal to finally see the end of Mosley. \n\nReality is, fans are not the stakeholders the presidents/commissioner etc answer to, their unpopularity is irrelevant to the job they perform. Though I feel MBS is a bit different in that a lot of his unpopular moves seems to be about him specifically rather than necessarily large scale FIA decisions.', ""it's time we got back to ecclestone and mosley."", 'The real power struggle his between liberty media and FIA. I would not be surprised if they have encouraged MBS to say things to undermine him. If you watch the f1 TV broadcast they go out of their way to undermine the FIA.

With Verstappen's 4th WDC, there's been a lot of conversations online about how important/rare that number of (+ run of consecutive) championships are and discourse about whether or not Verstappen should be added to the list of ""GOATs"" yet. I generally think the GOAT discourse is nonsense, but it made me curious this time because: Why is Vettel not generally included when people talk about the greatest drivers?

To the best of my understanding, his stats are pretty good (like, consecutive championships are rare, he held the consecutive win record before Verstappen, 4 titles is *very* rare). Is there some context I'm missing? Is it just nostalgia bias where people are reluctant to induct a ""new"" guy into the ""good old days"" club? Are his titles less impressive than other champions' titles for some reason?

Thanks! Always looking to learn more about F1 :)","['I saw Vettel race in 2004 in Formel BMW and he was already a class of his own there. In 2008 he jumped into the limelight with his superb win in Monza and he build from there. Now specifically in 2011 and 2013 there wasn’t much competition (like Max had last year), with Vettel in the best car and his teammate just not at his level. His 2010 and 2012 titles were fantastic. His ‘GOAT status’ however got a hit in the seasons after, a bit like Lewis the last couple of years. In all, a fantastic driver, and he matured into a very likable guy the last years.', ""Other things that impacted Vettel career:\n\n2014 Vettel became a father (same year Bianchi died), and becoming a father tends to make you risk averse. \n\nJoined Ferrari which was not as stable as under the Montezemolo, Todt, Brawn years. Remember Alonso was there previously and couldn't make it work. Nobody doubts Alonso driving skills. \n\nVettel did not have a manager, and while that works in certain situations, it can backfire in others. If he had a good manager during his time at Ferrari, it would have ended differently. Someone like Briatore or Willi Weber would have never allowed Vettel to be treated the way Ferrari publicly did. Teams like Ferrari have a lot of internal politics, and a driver in this case needs a manager to navigate the politics and do the dirty work."", ""Getting matched by Ricciardo in 14 and then beaten by Leclerc in 19-20 really did a number on Vettel's legacy. Plus, his incapability in mounting a full challenge to Hamilton in 17-18. Add to that the perception of being a one trick pony (i.e. master of Newey's blown diffuser design) and you get the picture."", ""I did not go look up stats, nor did I fact check anything I'm about to say, and I haven't watched replays of his career so this is entirely my subjective perception, ripened in my mind all by itself.\n\nVettel was annoyingly good in the RB. I was really annoyed with it at least, and I think he suffered from Schumacher-backlash as well. Together these things made that people would grudgingly admit he was the best than openly admire and extoll his virtues. Vettel only really became well liked outside of Germany after his RB years. Maybe this is one way in which his legacy is subdued, the people who saw him at his best might have been emotionally invested in seeing him fail.\n\nBut he was winning so much because he had some really undeniable strengths. He was a great qualifier, great starter and generally executed brilliant first laps, in laps and out laps. Especially the latter, his ability to feel out a car that's not yet in its performance window, is a champion's skill. At the time, he also had an iron mind, always thinking and unwavering determination. I remember him being spun round in the first lap in one of the final races of the season (or possible THE final) and cheering massively because I was hoping Webber would win the championship as a result, but then seeing Vettel coasting backwards, constantly making steering adjustments to avoid further contact and gather it up on the tarmac. Mid-crash, he was already working on the recovery drive. Seeing Max vs. Norris this season has only cemented my memory of how unimpeachable Vettel was back then; no one was consistent enough to snatch it away from him even at times when RB wasn't on top, true back then and true this season.\n\nWhat Vettel could not do post-RB however, was consistently outdrive the car. Drag a shitbox into big points. And that is in my opinion the sole reason why a driver like Alonso is rated higher than Vettel, despite similarly only having undisputed supremacy in one particular car with kind of a niche setup. Vettel's Ferrari career was a spiral of overdriving, frustration and costly mistakes. Come to think of it, Vettel's Toro Rosso career (also a shitbox) was probably similar in this regard, he could be brilliant but also represented a Grosjean-level liability at times. I think a lot of it is probably psychological, he lost that sense of infallibility and became a (very well liked) human again, but this meant he could not find the last 1% and might spin out chasing it in vain.\n\nI wonder how Hamilton will do in the ferrari. He's a bit of an enigma: he definitely does not have that iron mind, but when the carrot is dangled, he does still find the 1%. He might be a Vettel or an Alonso at Ferrari. I can't wait!"", ""It didn't help that when he was at his most successful, he was also at his least likeable."", 'Leclerc dominating Bahrain 2019, brand new to Ferrari, while Vettel spun on his own was damning enough evidence.', 'He was regarded as a highly talented though flawed driver back in 2009-2010. Vettel\'s first title could have been a lot easier for him had the RB6 been reliable, but his own errors in Turkey, Hungary and Belgium showed there was room for improvement.\n\nThen, in 2011, his dominant streak still featured talk of weaknesses. Canada\'s slip-up (something that can happen to anyone, really) was often characterized as him cracking under pressure. Such chatter remained, although he silenced many critics through races like Abu Dhabi and Brazil 2012.\n\nThe ""Vettel era"" is something that you only really felt at times in 2011 and in the back half of 2013. It was never as much of a constant as Hamilton\'s dominance in 2015 and 2019-2020 displayed, irrespective of the points totals and such. Max\'s era is also different to Vettel\'s, as the ultra-dominance of 2023 and his many wins either side of that season have cemented it as an unprecedented walkover.\n\nVettel never got the legend status of Senna/Prost or what Hamilton/Verstappen will end up as. The reason ultimately is found in what happened after his titles. Beaten by Ricciardo in 2014 and exiting RBR, never getting his Ferrari WDC and being dropped in 2020 at a relatively early age.', 'He was simply much more error prone than Max. He was a fantastic driver otherwise but if you’re comparing him to the GOATs it’s a pretty fatal flaw. I would recommend an F1TV subscription where you can watch the entirety of Seb’s career in full. \n\nYou’ll see critical errors like how he took himself out in Turkey 2010 trying to pass his team-mate, throwing away an easy victory in Hungary by flouting the safety car rules and his absolute mare at Spa. \n\n2017 it was a big ask to win the championship but he let Lewis off the hook massively with his start line move in Singapore, a track where Mercedes were known to be weak. He had a great year otherwise but that was a basic, unforgivable error that wiped out any title hopes he had in an instant.\n\nIn 2018 his crash in Germany was huge and it felt like he unravelled mentally after that with the pressure Lewis put on him. Ferrari made huge gains with the PU from Spa onwards but he made an error at Monza understeering into the side of Lewis on the first lap, with Lewis going onto beat Kimi to the win. Lewis then had arguably the weekend of his life in Singapore and the mistakes kept flowing from Seb through 2019, which is arguably the main reason Leclerc beat him that year.\n\nSome people will point to Danny Ric beating him in 2014 as a reason why Seb isn’t one of the best but I think that was simply a down year for Seb. In his championship years he had this hyper aggressive counter intuitive driving style that the blown diffusers really helped him hone. When the 2014 reg changes took that away, he needed the time to adapt. He went on to (at times at least) thump Raikkonen almost as convincingly as Alonso had done and that tells me Seb had all the ability in the world, I just don’t see at all that Ricciardo was fundamentally better. It’s a shame we never got to see a rematch to prove this theory.', ""There was a time when Vettel and Hamilton were about equal, success-wise, and Seb kinda flatlined from that point, while Lewis pulled away, amassing many more great wins & three more championships. \n\nI'm sorry to say that Vettel got a touch of the checos towards the end, which damaged his reputation somewhat. \n\nI don't really get the thing about 'consecutive championships'. I'd've thought non-consecutive championships would be harder and more rare (and therefore considered the greater achievement?)"", ""Vettel's not seen as a GOAT tier driver because he wasn't great when Ferrari had the car to challenge Mercedes in the hybrid era and then at Aston he was a shadow of his former self.\n\nHe was good in the V8 era with a good car, but he didn't show enough long term. He's like Ricciardo where he was fast when it suited him and then faded when it didn't. Drivers like Senna and Verstappen were always fast and that's why they're GOAT tier drivers.""]",17,131,0.69,17,640,640,2,1,0.019999999999999907,2

1hcwofr,Do you think Alonso could fight for the WDC given one of the top cars in 2026?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hcwofr/do_you_think_alonso_could_fight_for_the_wdc_given/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"With Newey arriving in AM and given the unpredictability of the new regulations, it's a possibility any team, whether Alpine or Super Aguri take the spot of the dominant team.

In this scenario of AM having one of the best cars, do you feel he's up to the task? Alonso will be 45 years old by 2026.","['I think if Newey builds another car as dominant as RB 18 or RB19 we will see another Alonso title.  He’s still super aggressive and when the car was good he was putting it back at the front.  I’m not sure the team is ready to actually go into a title fight, but I think Fernando has the talent still to do it.', 'Absolutely he can. 45 year old Alonso is still better than most of this grid.', ""Hard to tell.. I get the feeling age finally started to catch up with him this season. In two more seasons, who knows if he will have declined more. It is entirely possible his performances have dropped off a cliff by then.\n\nIt is also very competitive at the front. 4 very closely matched cars, and 7 strong drivers (sorry Perez).\n\nI know 2026 is a new regulations and so should reset the competitive order to some extent. And someone usually does very well out of new regulations, and you wouldn't bet against Newey nailing it. If Alonso gets a dominant car, with Stroll as his teammate, he is capable of winning. If it is only slightly better, I'd fancy a Max/Charles/Lando to be able to beat a 45 year old Alonso in slightly inferior machinery. And I don't think at that age, Alonso can do a miracle like 2012 and drag an inferior car into a title battle."", 'It pains me to say this because he’s been one of my favourite drivers since his first race for Minardi but unless Newey can help inspire the engineering team to design a car as dominant as the RB19 (bearing in mind he’ll be 45 by the time anything Newey-influenced even debuts), then no, I don’t think he could. I think he could still fight for a few wins but I don’t think he’d win out across a full season over the big young talents currently fighting at the front.', ""Fight? Yes, 100%. Win? Only if it has a considerable gap to the others, I don't see him currently beating VER-LEC-RUS-NOR in a car of similar pace."", 'assuming he has far and away the best car and a bad team-mate, then yes.\n\nOtherwise; no.', 'I think any driver on the grid could fight for the title in a top car. Ok maybe anyone but Perez.\xa0', ""How good Alonso is now is really hard to gauge. His team mate is probably a bottom 3 driver on the grid and arguably the worst and although he's well beaten him, he hasn't absolutely pasted him. Now maybe Stroll is okay and Alonso still has it, we don't know \n\n\nBut age comes for everyone eventually and there's probably been times where Alonso has showed he isn't what he once was. For him to be a world champion at 45 In the modern era I just struggle to believe. Unless he's in the best car by miles, I don't see it.\n\n\nHe may still be good enough for F1 which would still be insane. But when we see some guys decline in their mid 30s, still being elite mid 40s seems improbable. But Tom Brady existed so it's not impossible he can be the anomaly"", 'Certainly possible if AM nail the regs and come out with the fastest car, and provided his team mate remains Lance, which it probably will. But if in 2026 say for whatever reason Chuck or Max jump into the other seat replacing Lance, then they will likely take the prize.']",10,82,0.61,10,78,78,9,35,0.08999999999999997,9

Would you like to end of third in the WCC because one of the drivers is bringing in enough money that the higher ups are still happy ? You've worked your whole life to end up here, but money talks more than performance. So you're not happy.

This must be bring down the morale of the whole team, and that means people leaving for greener pastures. The majority of people working at Red Bull want to _win_, not to make more money for the stakeholders and Checo's presence is working against that goal.
