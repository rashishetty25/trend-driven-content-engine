1gru00i,[Tobi Gr√ºner] Formula 1 is working on a rule change for 2026 to make life harder for customer teams like RB or Haas.

We had to work a lot on the regulations. Especially with regard to energy management, to ensure that the cars also behave like real racing cars and have no undesirable characteristics. ""We are very happy. I think we have done well,"" Tombazis reports.

""A motor without an electric component, for example V8 motors powered by e-fuels, was not an issue. ""We have to be able to do that. If we hadn't put the engine program together as it is now, we would probably have only had two engine manufacturers,"" says Tombazis.
