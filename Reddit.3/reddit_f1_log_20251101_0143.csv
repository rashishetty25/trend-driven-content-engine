1okpia8,List of good races to watch?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1okpia8/list_of_good_races_to_watch/,2025-10-31, Discussion,"Hi! 

I got into F1 this year, courtesy of my friend, who has been a fan for longer. I got in right after Imola, so I didn't get to watch it (not yet anyway), but she caught me up on the basics. Monaco was the first race I'd ever watched, and my friend sincerely apologized (lol) because she said that the race wasn't a great introduction at all. Looking back after a few months of getting to know the sport more, I do agree that she was right. I've been watching every race since then, and I honestly think all the races so far have been entertaining. But yeah, other than a few clips from races from earlier in the year and past years, I haven't watched any full races from before Monaco 2025.

This now brings me to my question: Could you maybe suggest races (starting from 2015 preferably, I've grown to like Max and want to start from there haha) that are actually worth watching in full and/or maybe have significance of some sort? Like staple races that you just *have* to see unfold. I'm still open to races before 2015 though, especially if it's very monumental for F1.  
  
I was initially planning on binging everything, but watching 10 years' worth of races might actually burn me out, and I'd never touch F1 again, haha. So, maybe fan-favorite races from 2015-2024? Let me know what I should watch to be cultured!","['Here are the 100 best races from 2008 to 2024 as rated by our readers:\n\n[The Top 100 F1 Races as rated by RaceFans readers](https://www.racefans.net/rate-the-race/top-100-f1-races/)', 'Brazil 2024 and Germany 2019 definitely\n\nI liked Imola and Silverstone 2024 too', 'Outside of your time limits but no F1 fan’s life should be complete without watching the full race from Spa (Belgium) 1998. The most expensive crash in history, Coulthard brake testing Schumacher and the ensuing chat in the pits, a Jordan winning a race. Pure hysteria and emotion, one of the greatest races of all time.\n\nEdit: I could have put “brake tested” in inverted commas to highlight the differing opinions. However one hill I am willing to die on is Schumi’s Ferrari that definitely didn’t have the (outlawed) active suspension, then driving back to the pits perfectly planted with only three wheels…', ""I know it's older than you asked for, but Suzuka 2005 is one of the greatest dry races of all time. Prime Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Räikkönen all tearing it up. Won't say more because of spoilers, I recommend just watching it. Pure racing candy, in my opinion.\n\nMontreal 2011 is one of the best wet races of all time and will show you the glory of racing in the rain. I know it's long (I think it's still the longest race on record?) but it's worth the watch, trust me. It's got all the good, the bad and the ugly of wet racing and is just a thrilling watch in total."", 'New to F1 as well.  Totally on board with this post.
