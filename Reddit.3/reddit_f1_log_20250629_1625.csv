Personally I'd get rid of Kimi but I'd feel awful doing it. I just couldn't refuse a line up of arguably the two best drivers on the grid.

Max is a Goat tier driver and many in the paddock think he might have as much as two to three tenths on the whole grid. In this years Mercedes I think he could be right in the championship fight.

All that suggest that Kimi has a higher ceiling than George (which is very high) is his junior career, but here’s the kicker, George Russell has a better junior career, and against better competition.

In F1 I don't think you refuse a line up of potentially the two best drivers on the grid just to maintain good vibes and the power of friendship.

This is a competitive sport. If I got a chance to potentially have BOTH of the two best drivers on the grid (I’d put Leclerc > Russell tbf but it’s close) I would do it.

And if you get rid of George and get Max/Kimi you run a big risk of Max obliterating Kimi like he has with so many team mates, Kimi losing all confidence, and when Max retires (which he hints is sooner rather than later) you are left with no George. No Kimi. No Max.

And I feel like keeping George/Kimi and keeping Max is the emotions talking. It would be like 2002 Williams refusing 2002 Michael Schumacher to maintain harmony and good vibes. 

You may say Verstappen and Russell would cost each other points by crashing into each other but I think they would more than make up for the points they lose crashing into each other and simply put, I think a team will have a higher points tally with Max/George than they will with Max/Kimi or George/Kimi.

But what do you think? Im interested to hear other opinions even if they are different from my own because all three options have very strong arguments.","[""Just like with Lewis joining Ferrari you take the deal. Getting a (multiple) world champion on board is always favourable.

Hey all,

So watching the start of the race, I was a bit confused when Carlos made his way to the pits for a pit lane start. I was under the impression that once the marshals assisted his car, he was immediately DSQ'd. It ended up being a non factor, but, I figured I'd post this here to help clear it up for people.

Looking back at the regulations for 2025, in 26.7 it states that a car is DSQ'd for receiving marshal assistance anywhere other than the pit lane. However, it also states that there is an exception for 26.7d where marshals are allowed to assist team personnel to remove the car from the grid. As such, 47.2 takes over and it became a pit lane start for Carlos.

Note that this is not entirely clear because 26.7d specifies after the race start, during the intermission between the start of the formation lap and start of the race is not specified.

**HOWEVER**

Where it becomes more confusing is 44.12 (44 covering race start procedure). 44.12c states that any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car.  44.12d states that they may attempt to restart it once back in the pits. Carlos shuts off his car right before the marshals begin pushing him. They then stop pushing and he restarts the car. Should he not be DSQ'd for restarting his car after receiving assistance? Does that rule change because the race has been aborted at that point?","['The FIA activated the fire in his car to DSQ him', ""My take was that the race didn't actually start at that point so it was fine for a pitlane start but good question, Not entirely sure what happened there."", 'I was thinking that as well, but the fact that he retired right after meant that it doenst really matter.\xa0', ""I don't think it was aborted start when the Marshall's touched the car and that's why they quickly stopped and went back trackside. I'm kinda talking out of my ass here, but I did find it weird how long it took for RC to abort the start when it was so clear it wasn't going to happen."", 'I was wondering about this, too! Maybe because it wasn\'t ""during"" the race, so a pitlane start might still be allowed?', 'Had they already aborted the start by then?', ""Was the race start abandoned at that point and would that matter? All I've got"", 'I know you can be pushed onto the pit lane and start but you are right about the fact he wasn’t. However I recall they’ve made it so a pit lane start has to do the formation lap now with the others. So how does that work with being pushed into the pit lane. It’s less clear to me\xa0', ""I don't think the marshals changed anything, I think it was a brake issue that was (partially) relieved enough to allow the car to roll but ultimately saw the brakes get cooked.""]",28,15,0.75,28,14,14,28,15,0.75,28

He crushed Gasly and Albon afterwards Checo put some challenges at least he managed to get wins and podiums after he left the cycle started all over again and it is not healthy at all. When Max is out of the race Red Bull just becomes a backmarker team literally probably Baku 2024 was the last time that second car was actually competing for top 5 which came after a long time.

Red Bull’s 2nd seat comes with massive amounts of pressure from both media and the team to challenge Verstappen and being able to lose your seat so easily (just look at Lawson) makes it a lot worse. It makes second drivers to take a lot less risk since crashing comes with massive cost. So they don’t push that much, and get crushed by Max, if they push one mistake and they crash (and it’s pretty easy since the car is so unstable.) 
 In the end either they push or not they’re just doomed. 
Leaving Max without a competitive teammate which can help him in races or can give a nice feedback about the car in general, making the car harder to develop. 

Also since the sexual harassment allegations about Horner the team is in chaos and divided between Verstappens & Marko vs Horner and Red Bull’s owners made their stance clearly by keeping Horner in the team. Because of this Newey left Wheatley left etc. 

The Cold War needs to end for both Verstappens’ and Horner’s side and they need a fresh start and it is possible by Max leaving Red Bull. It could  benefit both of them if Red Bull manages to sign a A tier driver who can lead the team while they are recovering.
