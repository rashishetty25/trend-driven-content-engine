There's no doubt he was a fantastic driver, but how fantastic, exactly? \n\nI recently watched Beat Zehnder's beyond the grid, where he rated Raikkonen as the fastest driver he worked with. Additionally, Marc Priestley said that Raikkonen was the fastest driver he ever worked with, even quicker than Alonso and Hamilton. Furthermore, Vettel mentioned in his beyond the grid that Raikkonen was the most naturally gifted team mate he ever worked with.\n\nHe's an interesting case for me, and the reason why he's an interesting case is because you can hear all these things about how good a driver Raikkonen was, with some extremely high (and over the top) praise of his skill level. But the problem is........that praise isn't really translated to his results on the track.\xa0 As good as he was, he doesn't really live up to the hype.\n\nI really struggle to believe that Raikkonen was this amazing top driver on Michelin tyres exclusively, and never recovered once Michelin quit F1. That doesn't logically follow for me, and seems like a convenient way to paint Raikkonen as better than he really was (of which, don't get me wrong, he was amazing, but what people say about him seems over the top). \n\nYet I can't deny that what insiders say about him tend to see it differently , that Raikkonen was actually **that** good.\n\nTl,Dr - simple question \nDo you think that Raikkonen was a driver, who early in his career,\xa0 was on par with Alonso & Schumacher?"", 'Isack Hadjar gave an interview to Canal+ a few days ago and when he was asked about things he must improve on, he replied ""basically everything outside of speed, as the speed is innate"".\n\nIs it impossible to ""teach"" speed ?

My predictions:\n\n* McLaren - Alex Dunne will be in F2, but given that they didn't bother to hand Bortoleto an FP session this year, I imagine they'll stick with running Pato O'Ward and Ryo Hirakawa. Dunne might get one.\n\n* Ferrari - I'm hoping they run Dino Beganovic rather than Arthur Leclerc, since Beganovic might actually have a chance of getting to F1.\n\n* Red Bull/Racing Bulls - Hadjar will count for two sessions at Racing Bulls but that still leaves six to fill over both teams. They're clearly grooming Arvid Lindblad for a seat, possibly as soon as next year, so I expect him to get some sessions. Maybe they give Ayumu Iwasa one in Japan as well. I think it's unlikely that the other juniors (Marti, Goethe, Tramnitz) get any. They also still have Jake Dennis as a development driver and he did an FP session for RBR last year.\n\n* Mercedes - Antonelli's first two races will count. For the two sessions in Russell's car, they will probably go back to calling on Frederik Vesti since their other juniors are all 11 years old.\n\n* Aston Martin - Likely to be Felipe Drugovich and Jak Crawford sharing the sessions.\n\n* Alpine - Doohan counts for two, and they've just signed Paul Aron as a reserve so I assume he will get the others, although I hope they save one for Victor Martins.\n\n* Haas - Tough to call, since Bearman doesn't count anymore. They might run Beganovic if Ferrari don't, or they could run Hirakawa if McLaren don't; he tested with Haas in Abu Dhabi because of the new Toyota partnership. If neither are available, I guess they could dust off Pietro Fittipaldi who is still officially their reserve.\n\n* Williams - Likely to be Luke Browning for all four since Colapinto doesn't count anymore.\n\n* Sauber - Bortoleto will count for two, but as for the other two...

Until Straw comes in and says what needs to be said in a sentence or two.\n\nOr talks like some great authority and then back tracks and puts caveats when he realises that he\'s in deep waters. It really drags out the podcasts. I\'m always looking more forward to listening to the episodes when it\'s Edd, Mark and Glenn.', 'New to F1, and thinking about the various crashes that happen. \nIf a driver is deemed to have caused a crash, is there any sort of penalty?', 'At his best years (2003-2007), Raikkonen was very good (dominating Coulthard and Montoya in 2004-2005 was especially good), but even in these seasons I don’t think he was at the level of Alonso and Schumacher, more the level of Button. He obviously had a stellar year in 2005, the best of his career, but in a weird sort of way, I think the 2005 McLaren’s unreliability helped the perception of him. If he won he was brilliant, and if it broke down he was so unlucky (but not lucky to be driving such a fast car!). \n\nHis career outside of the 2003-2007 period is pretty underwhelming. The only full time teammates he beat outside of that era were Grosjean in his first two years (who was starting to get on terms with him towards the end of 2013) and Giovinazzi. He was beaten by Massa in 2008-09 (during his prime) and was easily beaten by Alonso and Vettel across 2014-2018. I find it impossible to reconcile the general perception of him with his results on track, when you have to ignore 80% of a drivers career in order to rate them so high, there’s a problem. There are three possible explanations for his performances without Michelins. Either he declined abnormally early, he was horribly unadaptable, or was just never that good in the first place, none of which are particularly flattering for him. It’s probably a combination of all three. I remember Alan Permane said on Beyond the Grid he would sort of do the bare minimum, so maybe early in his career he could get by on pure talent, but later in his career being lazy caught up with him.\n\nIn conclusion, I think while Raikkonen was great at his best, even in these years he wasn’t as good as Schumacher or Alonso, and he certainly wasn’t as good as them across his whole career. He probably declined a bit after his title, (lack of motivation?) was very particular about car setup (which made him look really lost when the car didn’t suit him like in 2008, 2014, 2015, 2017), and was probably a bit overrated to begin with. Still the most recent Ferrari champion though.']",10,54,0.78,10,88,88,1,0,0.020000000000000018,1
