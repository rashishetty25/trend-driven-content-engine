1i78lvs,"Starting today, we are banning Twitter/X content on r/formula1. We urge all journalists, creators, photographers and other F1 personalities to also make their content available on alternative platforms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i78lvs/starting_today_we_are_banning_twitterx_content_on/,2025-01-22, Meta,"**TL;DR:** For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter, with the intention to make this ban permanent in some form.

Hey everyone!

After [yesterday’s proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6lm2v/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/) we discussed within the mod team whether a full ban on Twitter content would be feasible. We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers & FOM have not. But we also realize that it’s a *chicken or the egg problem* and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a non-trivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news

In the end we’ve settled on the following approach:

* For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter with the only exception of screenshots of relevant posts by teams, drivers & F1 that are **not available on any other platform**. Even in case of major breaking news, we ask you to post links to the press releases or a screenshot of the post from Instagram, with a link in the comments.
* We hope that this trial period will provide a nudge for F1 journalists, creators and teams to make their content available on alternative platforms as **we intend to make this ban permanent in some form.**

Why a trial period? First of all, sometimes mods make bad decisions even if with the best intentions. (For example in 2015 this subreddit banned images & gifs, which caused a controversy that was only resolved after [Will Buxton stepped in to mediate the situation](https://redd.it/3jmslx).) Second of all, this is one of the strictest approaches to Twitter content and strict bans like this can have unintended consequences, so we might need to later refine this ban. We intend the trial period to last at least until the first races of the new season, after which a final form of the ban would be implemented.

This subreddit has had restrictions on what content can be posted for a very long time. We’ve had the source rating system that labeled the quality of news sites and is still used for removing sensationalist and unoriginal articles. We’ve also had limitations on Instagram due to its requirement for an account to view posts. There’s no doubt that over the past years Twitter has become a low-quality source: the login requirements, the flood of bots, the prioritization of content from paying users and promotion of sensationalist content. But unlike with news sites in our source-rating system, for Twitter there wasn’t really an alternative. But now that viable alternatives are emerging and the proposal thread from yesterday has shown that the community prefers those alternatives, **we think it’s time to try and see how the subreddit works without content from Twitter.**

# For journalists, photographers, creators & other F1 personalities

Our preferred alternative platform is Bluesky and to help avoid impersonations we have created a [list of verified F1 related accounts on Bluesky](https://go.bsky.app/57f6geP). This list is used both for feeds & starter packs on Bluesky, but also for AutoModerator here on Reddit. We are adding new verified accounts whenever we come across them, but please contact us on Bluesky or send a modmail here on Reddit to accelerate this process. We want to assist with this transition and we also want to hear your feedback throughout this trial period, so please get in touch.","['https://preview.redd.it/ffwlldom9jee1.jpeg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e7761f171e9f5d7430bb27593eb3c53408674db\n\nI see F1twt is reacting to this in a so normal way. 😭', ""Twitter was such a low bar for quality news anyway.

1i7xhm3,What Does Charles Do From Here..?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i7xhm3/what_does_charles_do_from_here/,2025-01-23, Discussion,"The massive PR wave this week for Lewis turning up at Maranello - the fabulous images, the tsunami of press around this, the Tifosi out in droves, and almost blanket coverage in Italian press... 

What the heck does this do for Charles's attitude given he's pretty clearly quite an emotional racer already..? Is he sitting back hyper stressed that he's lost the team now that the king has arrived? 

Will this make or break him as a long term Ferrari driver?","['Ride the wave and try be better than Hamilton. Will be a massive boost for him if he is', '1. Beat teammate (Lewis Hamilton)\n2. Become WDC\n3. Get WCC for Ferrari.\n\nThese must be his objectives every season.', 'He’s Il Predestinato and the beloved son of Italy. He’ll be fine. I don’t think most drivers concern themselves with media and attention from fans to the extent we think they do.', 'Nothing. It doesn’t mean anything. Charles knows who Lewis is and he knows what it means for Ferrari.\n\nIt’s actually really disrespectful to label him as “emotional” and imply that his mentality is so weak that PR for his teammate would impair him.', ""He beat Sebastian while he was still a rookie.\n\n\nI think you aren't giving Charles enough credit.\xa0He's had months to come to terms with Lewis coming to Ferrari, and I'm sure he's expected all the fanfare and hype a legend would create coming to a legendary team--imo it's naive for anyone here to think otherwise.\n\n\nIt would be one thing if Lewis was still some unbeatable giant, but he\xa0is obviously not in his prime anymore and as such, Charles has every chance of being able to beat him. He'll focus on that. Let's see what happens when the races come and he doesn't outmatch Lewis the way he'll hope he will, but right now I don't think the media fanfare will affect him all that much.\n\n\nHe's in the best situation right now honestly--if he loses against Lewis, then the narrative will be that Lewis found his spark again in Ferrari, less that Charles is a bad driver. If he beats Lewis, then even better.\xa0\n\n\nImage-wise, it's better for him than when he was with Carlos."", 'Get in the car and beat him.', 'Charles shoud worry about his performance on the track, not about Lewis beating him on instagram.', ""He will dominate Lewis and that's the best answer for the hype."", ""Put his money where his mouth is and bet Lewis that he'll beat him.""]",0,33,0.26,0,28,28,0,17,0.0,0
