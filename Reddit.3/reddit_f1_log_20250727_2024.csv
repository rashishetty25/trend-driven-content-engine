Racing is rarely done in the rain anymore primarily due to extremely poor visibility, not because drivers can't control the cars. Modern tires and diffusers create a massive amount of spray, making it impossible for drivers to see other cars, even at close distances and high speeds. This lack of visibility significantly increases the risk of severe accidents. While drivers like Carlos Sainz enjoy the challenge of driving in the rain, the safety concerns related to visibility with multiple cars on the track are the main reason for the reduced frequency of rain races.

I'm not sure how other people feel about this as seasoned viewers, but as a new viewer who doesn't know which driver/team I want to root for, it seems like the broadcast wants me to root for either McLaren, Redbull, or Ferrari. 

I understand these are the more popular teams, and their drivers are usually leading races, but the broadcast and camera seem to be split 90% those teams, 10% the other seven teams. 

There have been countless times that the broadcast focuses on someone like Piastri or Max cruising in 1st with no one behind them for 10 seconds, and in the meantime, there are 3 overtakes happening in the range of 12-20th place. 

I feel like they should be showcase the lower tier driver's more often, trying their best to capture all the overtakes and intense moments happening in that range, instead of only the top 5. That way, those drivers' skills and personalities get to be shown to more people. 

Additionally, it seems like the camera crew/operator often cuts to important moments right after they happen, causing the need for many replays throughout the match. This isn't detrimental, but is still very annoying, because I can see on the on-board cams that something is happening, but the camera crew doesn't show it.

We have had plenty of races over the last few years where the leader (often Max) is often invisible because he checked out ahead, so with no hope of action then the focus is elsewhere.\n\nIn short, there is lots of room for improvement, but TV direction will never be perfect, if for no other reason than different people want different things.

1masami,What‚Äôs the deal with Spa?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1masami/whats_the_deal_with_spa/,2025-07-27, Discussion,"I‚Äôm newer to F1, started watching closely in 2020. I‚Äôve never enjoyed Spa and have also dreaded its arrival on the calendar. The race has pretty much always been a dud (since I started watching). 2024 was fine‚Äînot the worst but not top 10 either. I have no love for Miami, but I‚Äôd rather watch 2 Miami races than what we got today. 

My question for long time watchers is when did things trend poorly for Spa? Is it reg specific? It seems unlike Japan and Imola, Spa has good passing corners and plenty of room for these bigger cars. I just don‚Äôt get it. 

On the flip side, I have a deep love for Austria. The race is pretty much a guaranteed banger. And I‚Äôm always shocked to hear how people have not universally loved this track until more recently.   ","[""It could be my false perception, because I don't have great race recall, but I feel like racing at Spa got worse when they shortened the DRS zone. Maybe next year will be better. I find a lot of people on here just love the traditional permanent circuits, and I think many people remember Spa more fondly than the current situation warrants. Maybe it will be better next year though."", 'Spa used to mean unpredictable weather and the possibility of chaos. However, now we only race in the dry.

But more and more, people are realizing some of the historic tracks rely on the weather gods to produce good races, which really sucks. It's difficult to say whether it's the regulations, the tracks, the randomness being engineered out of the sport, etc. Spa is an amazing circuit with a rich motorsports history but it's difficult to say it's a top 5 track from an entertainment perspective over the last several years. It is an amazing track to drive in these cars, surely, but whether it still produces all time races is another story unfortunately."", ""> On the flip side, I have a deep love for Austria.

It has iconic corners like eau rouge/raidillon, pouhon, and blanchinont. It's fast, it's flowing, and it's in a beautiful setting.\xa0\n\n\nYou're also likely to get mixed weather - people sometimes say that it takes rain to produce a good race, but location and climate are just as much a characteristic of a circuit as anything else, so I don't see why that shouldn't be factored in\n\n\nI also would disagree that it's notable that it doesn't produce many good races. *F1* doesn't produce many good races full stop.

1mamzlo,Wet start proposal: Send cars off at intervals under VSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mamzlo/wet_start_proposal_send_cars_off_at_intervals/,2025-07-27, Discussion,"Since we keep seeing red flags for visibility while cars are bunched up behind the Safety Car, the obvious solution to me seems to be to use the VSC instead wherever possible. This is easy enough to implement during the race, but if everyone sets off from the grid at the same time it doesn't make any difference from starting under the Safety Car.

My proposal is to send the cars off at 3 or 4 second intervals (longer would be ideal, but the limit will be informed by the lap time under VSC divided by the number of cars, then reduced further to create a margin for error). I'm not sure what the exact procedure would look like, but as an example, the starting lights could alternate extinguishing two lights on each side to indicate the next car on each side can proceed.

Once underway, the cars can circulate to clear the standing water, with enough of a gap between them to avoid the worst of the spray. The current rules already allow for multiple formation laps, so there wouldn't need to be any change there. Once the decision is made to start the race, the Safety Car can be sent out for one lap to gather the field before either a standing or rolling start.","['F1 should use all the hot takes on Reddit to dry the track.', 'They already have trucks drying the track.', 'So basically have a track where every part is driven over by a car at a regular interval to help dry the track? Sounds interesting but I don‚Äôt think this would make any sense from a racing standpoint', 'there are more effective ways to dry a racetrack', 'My idea would be to have every team bring a ""rain car"". This car would be driven by each team\'s reserve driver with full wet tires on to help clear the track of standing water.

That would be better', ""Actually the best suggestion I've seen. Means that the entire track will have a car run through it every couple of seconds.
