We also get the McLaren drivers imitating Andrea Stella who apparently reminisces a lot about the Schumacher era in Ferrari. Extra amusing because George is way more chill here than in Australia.\n\n2) Bahrain GP - We start out strong with a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek, self-deprecating comment from Lando, immediately followed by a  half-naked George Russell. We have Oscar poking fun at Lando. Lots of jokes from Lando about himself. George becomes Lando\'s sympathetic hype man. Should probably be switched around with China but gets extra points for George being on brand and shirtless.\n\n1) Australian GP - Lando\'s mum\'s swearing being part of the highlights makes up for the slightly awkward vibes between Max and George (and their mutual friend Lando who is thankfully in the middle).

What he’s doing in that car is special.', 'Translation and full article:\n\n> **Max Verstappen turned the tide in the World Championship battle with his second win of the season at Imola. How did he manage that? In our race analysis, we answer the most important questions about the Emilia Romagna GP.**\n\n> **Why was Red Bull so good?**\nAfter dominating the Miami race, McLaren had to concede defeat to Red Bull in the seventh race of the season. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri finished second and third, respectively, behind Max Verstappen, who controlled the entire race. Verstappen once again laid the foundation with his brilliant overtaking maneuver in the Villeneuve chicane. Overall, however, Red Bull also had the better pace than McLaren and was clearly the stronger force. This put them back in the fight for the World Championship.\n\n> Red Bull was on par with its arch-rivals in the 400th Grand Prix in precisely the discipline where McLaren usually excels – tire wear. Despite the warm temperatures, they managed to keep their tires alive. Another bonus: Like in Suzuka, they were in the lead and had a clear path and clean air. The pit stop just in time for the Virtual Safety Car, which was deployed due to Esteban Ocon\'s stranded Haas, played into the Bulls\' hands.\n\n> But even afterward, it became clear: Verstappen had everything under control. He extended his lead to 18 seconds before the safety car neutralized the race due to Kimi Antonelli\'s damaged Mercedes. In other words, he controlled the race from start to finish. ""He was never under pressure,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. After the safety car, he opened up a lead of 6.1 seconds over ten laps.\n\n> This strength is primarily due to the car being brought into a better setup window. This also allows for better tire temperature management. This is partly due to the upgrades that have been made to the RB21 since Miami. These included a different underbody, and in Imola, a different cooling intake and new brake ventilation.\n\n> Although Friday didn\'t look so promising, Horner reports that Verstappen was happy after the third practice session on Saturday. A typical picture of the difficult Friday – but they still needed time to evaluate and understand all the data. Horner even went so far as to say that they were at the same level as last year in Brazil. After all, Verstappen crossed the finish line 6.1 seconds ahead of Norris and 12.9 seconds ahead of Piastri.\n\n> Horner finds the current development very encouraging. ""We\'re building momentum, which is very important at this stage of the championship."" Verstappen is now third in the World Championship, just 22 points behind Piastri. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella sees two reasons why Red Bull was superior. ""They\'ve improved and made progress,"" he says. He was almost certain that the dominance they showed in Miami wouldn\'t be replicated to the same extent in Imola. ""The type of corners here are completely different from those in Miami. Here we have more fast corners.""\n\n> **Did McLaren expect the strategy with Oscar Piastri?**\nHowever, the question also arose as to whether there might have been more to gain if the McLaren command post had chosen Piastri to pursue a different strategy. The Australian and current World Championship leader made his first pit stop on lap 13 and switched from medium to hard tires. In doing so, he followed the example of Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari, who was the first of the leading group to adopt this tactic.\n\n> Piastri dropped from second to twelfth place, but then had to plow his way through the field. By lap 28, he was back in fourth place. But then came a gift for all those who hadn\'t yet stopped – including Verstappen: the Virtual Safety Car deployed due to Esteban Ocon\'s stranded Haas. Piastri also used the opportunity to switch back to medium. At his second opportunity, when the Safety Car was deployed on lap 46 for Kimi Antonelli, he stayed on the track and was later unable to defend himself against teammate Norris with the older tires.\n\n> ""It was unclear before the race whether it would be one or two stops,"" said McLaren team principal Andrea Stella after the race. ""And when Oscar came into the pits, that was exactly the moment to decide."" In his opinion, the problem was more that the hard tires didn\'t perform much better than the old medium tires. ""If that had been better, the two-stop strategy would have been a very good one – even if he would have had to overtake a few drivers,"" Stella said. ""That\'s why we have no regrets.""\n\n(1/2)', 'Was he ever out of it? The Red Bull likes high speed front limited tracks. I’m expecting him to be somewhere in midfield in Monaco.', 'Red Bull looked really fast. Max is definitely gonna win again this year. Oscar winning these opening races will be like 2022 when Charles was winning at the beginning', ""All depends, right now the McLaren works at every track. The Red Bull works at some tracks. \n\nMax isn't back in the championship fight until the point the Red Bull is working at almost every track like the McLaren"", ""Perhaps, but the tracks have generally suited Red Bull more so than the rest of the calendar will, there's not many Imola/Jeddah/Suzuka type circuits left. We seen in Bahrain that when the circuit is not what the Red Bull likes they'll be miles off the pace."", '> Red Bull also noticed that Piastri had a grain on his front left tire. They didn\'t want to risk a two-stop strategy due to the long pit lane, which would have resulted in a 27-second loss and the risk of falling back into traffic. And Verstappen was able to continue anyway without significant tire degradation.\n\n> **Where did the Ferrari miracle come from?**\nFerrari experienced one of its most frustrating days of the season on Saturday at Imola, of all places, its home race. Both Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton were eliminated in Q2 and started the race from eleventh and twelveth, respectively. They were knocked out of the top ten by the two Aston Martins.\n\n> On Sunday, the opposite picture emerged. Ferrari excelled, while Aston Martin suffered. Lewis Hamilton finished fourth in the race, Charles Leclerc sixth. This confirmed Ferrari\'s pattern of doing significantly better in the race than in qualifying. ""We simply have to improve in qualifying,"" said Ferrari team principal Frédéric Vasseur.\n\n> One reason it doesn\'t work on a fast lap: people don\'t understand the tires in this discipline. Since Miami, they\'ve been faster on used tires than on fresh ones. That shouldn\'t really happen. Vasseur\'s theory: ""It has something to do with the track, the soft tire compounds, and the fact that wear is quite low on both circuits."" But that\'s just a guess. Because he also admits: ""Today you think you understand the tires. And tomorrow everything is different again.""\n\n> Leclerc echoes this sentiment: ""Our main focus must be on improving our qualifying performance, because the car is fast in the race."" He doesn\'t sound particularly optimistic about his home race in Monaco: ""It\'s a track that will expose the weaknesses of our car. It\'s very specific, and you have to drive the car differently than elsewhere.""\n\n> **Why did things suddenly stop working for Aston Martin?**\nAston Martin celebrated on Saturday and suffered a setback on Sunday. In other words, the situation was the opposite of Ferrari\'s. Fernando Alonso impressed in qualifying with fifth place, and Lance Stroll finished eighth. Both were driving a nearly brand-new AMR25. The good starting positions were also thanks to the strategy of setting fast lap times in Q3 with the medium tires instead of Pirelli\'s soft C6.\n\n> In the race, Alonso and Stroll, with their first stops on laps 12 and 14, were among those who, like Leclerc and Piastri, switched early from medium to hard. However, with the VSC deactivation, the advantage of the undercut disappeared, and they didn\'t want to stop during the VSC due to the priority given to track position. The competitors who used the VSC to change naturally had fresher tires.\n\n> What\'s somewhat confusing is that team boss Andy Cowell claims that the VSC ruined a promising one-stop strategy. In contrast, McLaren was on a two-stop strategy with Piastri\'s stop on lap 13. In the end, Alonso finished only eleventh, still without points on his World Championship tally, and Stroll finished 15th.\n\n> ""I think that without the VSC, we could have fought for P6 or P7 and deservedly finished in the points,"" said Alonso. ""At the restart, we were no longer in the points, but we managed to overtake three cars in nine laps, and then we just ran out of time.""\n\n> **Why was Mercedes so bad?**\nMercedes was among the group that still had something to smile about on Saturday, but were rather stunned on Sunday. George Russell once again demonstrated his consistency with a third-place start, employing the same medium-tire trick as Aston Martin. However, in the race, he dropped four positions to seventh. Kimi Antonelli had been struggling all weekend at his home race, retiring from the race with a throttle control failure.\n\n> The lack of performance with Russell is explained by the same problems that were encountered in Jeddah: tire overheating. The team thought they had the issue under control, but under certain circumstances and on certain tracks, the rear tires overheat. Russell also likely approached the medium tires too aggressively. The team coped better with the harder compound. Russell even drove this compound to the finish, 34 laps after changing during the Virtual Safety Car period.\n\n(2/2)', ""There's a lot of front limited circuits left. RB like tracks with long corners, and there's quite a few of them left on the calendar.""]",8,11,0.68,8,10,10,8,11,0.68,8

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

The one with a puncture officially can't enter the pit. \n\nI don't remember when they opened it up, was a good 15+ years ago at least.

That way a car which has spun gives greater visibility. Failing this, just put LEDs on the halo, I think they look great. Especially when many cars are driving in wet conditions and they come towards the camera out of the spray.\n\n- Make the rear rainlights on the rear wing end plates change dependent on flags being shown. In the same way the steering wheel lights change colour when you are in a yellow flag zone.
