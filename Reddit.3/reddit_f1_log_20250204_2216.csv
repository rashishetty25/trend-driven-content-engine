1ihmjvm,Why the FIA's F1 flexi wing U-turn might backfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ihmjvm/why_the_fias_f1_flexi_wing_uturn_might_backfire/,2025-02-04, News,,"['> Motorsport.com understands the stricter tests were initially planned for the start of the season, but there has been significant lobbying from some teams who had already developed flexi-wings to delay the introduction of the new test, initially until Imola and then until Barcelona.\n\n> Reports that teams, like Red Bull, are surprised or even furious about the changes are believed to be wide of the mark, as these tweaks were the subject of discussion for some time, so teams knew they were coming and had enough time to react.\n\n> But in certain corners, there is still unease over their staggered introduction, with the comprehensive front wing clampdown coming nine races into a 24-race campaign. On the one hand, it allows teams to integrate the FIA\'s intervention into their early season development cycle, with a circuit like Barcelona often the scene of big upgrade packages in the past.\n\n> On the other hand, some smaller teams who haven\'t fully caught on with flexing front wings feel like the delayed change bakes in the advantage of those who are at the forefront of a practice the FIA clearly sees the need to clamp down on. And while not forcing teams to make changes from race one can be seen as a way to help teams by not having them throw away carryover designs, some of those midfielders will actually have fewer changes to make than the likes of McLaren and\xa0[Mercedes](https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/), and therefore would have benefitted more from a clampdown right from the start.\n\n> How much will this affect the teams, and the 2025 title race?\n\n> That depends on who you ask, but one senior team source called the change ""proper"" and was adamant the teams involved - which along with McLaren and Mercedes is also believed to include the likes of Aston Martin and\xa0[Alpine](https://www.motorsport.com/team/alpine/24858/)\xa0\\- will have to make significant changes in order to comply, not just to the front wing but also to the all-important floor as the front wing design impacts anything downstream.\n\nSome interesting bits here from the article that claims Red Bull wasn\'t surprised about the change, while the senior team source they heard from suggests that McLaren, Mercedes, Aston Martin, and Alpine will be the most affected by this. \n\nI do worry that this midseason change could affect the championship, and I just hope if there is any effect caused by this it ends up making the championship closer for multiple teams rather than widening the gap like the midseason TD did in 2022.', 'FIA is so god damn inconsistent', ""They should apply this rule to all new front wings, but all teams must be in compliance no later than Barcelona.

I'll start supporting against:

Since he has skipped so many important and major parts of motorsport's junior series, it could be a major mistake  sending him straight to a team like Mercedes. ","[""It's probably a bit early considering Merc's chassis is less mature than many other teams, but Merc isn't going to have another decently mature car until 2027/2028, which is way past the window where Kimi gets picked up by another team.\n\nWhy not gamble on him, even if it's slightly early? The other F2 drivers have come out swinging and he's supposedly even quicker than they are."", 'Civilized? Sorry, I am out', 'Time will tell.', ""I think he's going to surprise a lot of people who have written him off based on his surface level F2 results"", 'Mistake, they should have given him time to develop his craft.', ""Mistake.\n\nAntonelli might be there on talent, but that's only a secondary consideration. The real reason he's there is to satisfy Toto Wolff's ego. Wolff is desperate to find the next Verstappen, and he's banking a lot on that being Antonelli. He's lost the most popular driver in the sport to Ferrari and Mercedes have been floundering since the 2022 generation of cars was introduced. If this gamble doesn't work out, it could ruin Antonelli's career. Worse, Mercedes have no idea what to do if things go off-script. Just look at their response to Antonelli's crash at Monza -- they didn't know how to respond.\n\nI know a lot of people got hyped for Antonelli based on his junior results, but look at who he was racing against in the likes of Formula 4 and Formula Regional -- none of those drivers really went on to do that much. Most of them struggled to score points in Formula 3. There's a danger here that Antonelli is a good driver whose results make him look better than he is because he was racing on a grid that was weaker than it might normally be. There was a lot of hype surrounding him going into Formula 2, but the excuses started almost immediately -- the team fumbled it, he lost out in the parts lottery, he had bad luck, his results don't matter because Mercedes have his testing data, and so on. The best thing for him would have been to stay in Formula 2 in 2025 and have a real shot at the title."", 'I think a young driver instantly getting a solid car and team at the beginning of their career is always a benefit. It’s way different than starting out at a back of the grid team. Yes the expectations are high but I think his goals would be to keep the car out of the wall and finish in the points as often as possible. I mean look at Oscar in his rookie year. That car wasn’t even that good for most of the season and he was still miles ahead. If he started off at Alpine I think his career would be very different. And of course Lewis and Max are also examples of this (not to say Kimi is guaranteed to be on their level). It’s always better to start with a good foundation. Mercedes knows this and since they’re committed to him long term, they feel little risk with developing him. One extra early season in F1 has much more upside than an extra season staying in F2.', 'I think the fact he’s replacing Lewis Hamilton is going to add so much more pressure to him from fans and spectators. Don’t really see how he handles that pressure unless he’s beating Russell', 'I think it’ll be fine. If he’s as great as toto thinks it’ll show from the start and he’ll have flashes of greatness.
