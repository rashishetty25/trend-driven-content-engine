I am a long-time racing fan (the first F1 season I followed was 1994, yet in my childhood) and a great lover of history, my other passion. Soon, I became an avid reader of both and somebody who had always wanted to explore the rich past of motor sport. Later, I started doing serious research and writing.

Are there more history enthusiasts?

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

The Formula E drive unit weights around 35kg and can provide almost 500hp. The potential F1 front drive unit would probably be a lot less powerful, so also lighter. Dimension-wise it would be harder. The area around the front suspension is jam-packed with suspension components, so far that some teams even had/have a small bump on the nose to house suspension parts\n\nWheel hub motors would be another option, but the unsprung weight probably isn't worth it"", 'I sometimes think about that too, but indeed, the unsprung mass. Although I believe that with the lightweight materials they use in F1, they could limit this quite well. But then you still have the heat that is generated, both during braking and when driving the wheels.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, the nose would become 10–15 cm wider, but I highly doubt that.']",3,4,0.71,3,4,4,1,0,0.039999999999999925,1

I cannot get a F1 TV Pro because they dont sell it anymore for Switzerland.
We are considered to be part of the German-Speaking area, where Sky streams live F1. Some races are on FreeTV (RTL) available, but only the races.
But: RTL and Sky streams are only available in Germany and i cannot subscribe without a German address ( and i dont want the hassle of creating a fake address und use VPN all the time)

It is frustrating.
How can i watch live F1 (Quali, Races) in switzerland?
I am willing to pay a monthly fee.","['I don’t quite get it, I VPN to Switzerland just to watch it for free on SRF.', 'Pirate it', ""I pirated it until F1TV became available in my country.

Connect your VPN to a country where F1TV is available, like the Netherlands for example. Open the app and follow the steps. You should be able to pay via google pay (or apple pay I guess) without having to enter your credentials/address. After that you don't need the VPN anymore.\n\nI want to add, please do only use that method if you're not able to get coverage in any other way."", 'Ask a friend/family in another country to get you the F1TV-Pro/Premium subscription, send you the login details, and use a VPN to that country to watch everything life.  \nUSA comes to mind.', ""What languages do you speak?
