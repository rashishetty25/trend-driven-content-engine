Jak Crawford, Aston Martin's academy driver would no doubt miss out on a seat next season, given Stroll's place in the team. Verschoor I doubt will win but is unsigned. But most of all the most upsetting and uncertain situation is Fornaroli's who is not part of any driver academy and is on-course to win back to back F3 and F2 titles.

Bortoleto was the F3 winner, Fornaroli was 11th place in the same team.\n\nIf points were only given away in features, not in reverse grid races, Browning would be leading the championship, not Fornaroli.

Oscar sat out a year even after going back to back rookie champions, which Fornaroli is not."", ""The current grid is pretty much locked in after the new rookies this year. \n\nThe regular driver churn is Baby Bulls or Alpine. Marko wants to use his driver pipeline. If he is making exceptions it's for the next multi WDC potential. Fornaroli doesn't have that pace. Alpine has Aron if they want to do some change. I don't really think Fornaroli is better than Aron. \n\nCadillac is committed to Herta. Things have to go really bad for a seat to open there. \n\nLawrence wants a WDC + Lance at Aston.

You'd have GP quali on Friday evening which then has say the top 10 reversed for a Sprint. But then that puts you in a situation where the only F1 track action you have on a Saturday is a 25-30 minute sprint race, which to me seems pretty dire.\n\nI know Stefano hates Practice and wants to abolish it, but then they are just going to end up with so little track action through the weekend."", ""To me motorsport is more than the race itself, I cannot compare it to ball and stick sports. Motorsport is practice, fine tuning the set-up, seeing how teams come up with strategy, qualifying has its own excitement and race is the cherry on top.\n\nTo further Americanize, sterilize, neuter the sport is going to be a very tough pill to swallow. I don't believe F1 is addressing underlying issues of weight, sound, driver freedom, excessive penalties, quality of racing. \n\nI've been following the sport since the late 80s, but 2025 is going to be the last year for a while unless they pivot to something more authentic."", 'Stefano hating practice and viewership on Fridays then talking about the YouTube highlights doing good numbers, he’s turning into one of those warehouse managers you despise who’s a company man through and through and obsesses over metrics without looking at the bigger picture', 'GP Quali on Friday would also lock the cars into the parc ferme conditions from then on which is the whole reason they reordered sprint weekends to how it is now. \n\nEither the reverse grid would have to be based on some other order (top 10 in Championship) or there has to be some fundamental change in how F1 goes about the condition of cars between quali and race.', 'IMO, it’s more likely that they scrap Friday and just have two day weekends, with qualifying and the sprint on the Saturday and the race on Sunday.

1njabhz,Is pursuing sustainable fuel worth the unintended side Effects?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1njabhz/is_pursuing_sustainable_fuel_worth_the_unintended/,2025-09-17, Discussion,"I was listening to latest episode of the race podcast regarding some of the things Domenicali said lately. And they zoomed in on the sustainable fuel and all the extra consequences it might bring.. for one; not all teams get free fuel from their fuel sponsor. Sustainable fuel will be like much more expensive, where they pay for like 2-3 million for fuel per season, this could go up to 12-15 million per season with sustainable fuel. That's a serious increase in costs for smaller teams. Just to have ""cleaner"" fuel.

Also there are talks about the fuel being standardised and that would eliminate the r&d aspect and thus make it less interesting for partner ships..how important are these partnerships? Sometimes you hear they gained some power because of better fuel, but it's marginal.

And is it fair, some teams have to pay for fuel and others don't?

What do you guys think, are these unintended side effects / collateral damage worth pursuing sustainable fuel? Will it really trickle down to the consumer automotive? It's been a long time since we have seen any substantial contribution from F1 to the automotive industry, for normal people. Not the hybrid supercars with F1 style power trains. And should F1 be a test lab for consumer automotive? 

The plus side of the sustainable fuel idea is that it comes with the return of V8, (after there wasn't a consensus abot the V10) but that's only a plus if the V8 can be like in the old days and not muzzled like the V6. Because if the V8 is just as fuel flow / rev Limited the sound won't be much better. what benefits are there to a V8 then? Just more power?
