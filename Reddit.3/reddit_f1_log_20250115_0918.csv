I know Alonso and Hamilton only have a handful of seasons left in them at that, and I reckon Nico is also tending that way too, so it won’t be too long now before Carlos (assuming he is still here) will be “the old guy”.

Hamilton will concretely begin his new journey as an official driver of Scuderia Ferrari in a few days.*\n\n> *His program in Maranello will feature meetings with engineers, training on the simulator and track time.*\n\n> *Of course, there is also the unveiling of Ferrari’s livery during Formula 1’s launch event in London.

Instead, on-track testing with previous cars will be determined by the calendar.*\n\n> *This implies that, in Ferrari’s case, the SF-23 also becomes a car usable for TPC tests , since all cars that have raced since the 2023 calendar year become usable.*\n\n> *For Hamilton it will be essential, from the first outing on January 22, to start building a relationship with his new team. He will work to learn the various processes and habits of Ferrari and begin working with his race engineer Riccardo Adami.*\n\n> *These will also be the first days where Leclerc and Hamilton will begin collaborating as teammates.

1i1j3ll,Oscar Piastri is closer to Lando Norris than people are insinuating. Especially in a tight field.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i1j3ll/oscar_piastri_is_closer_to_lando_norris_than/,2025-01-14, Discussion,"I do admit that there have been times were Oscar Piastri has been overhyped, especially last year and I still believe Lando Norris has a genuine margin over him at the moment. However despite a poor run of form in the final races of the season, somewhat leaving a poor impression moving on to the next one, I would like to bring to attention two things. 

One of which is the actual pace gap between them in qualifying. Despite the picture told by the qualifying head to head which is something like 19-4 or so. The average gap is most often less than 2 tenths and they tend to start very close to eachother on the grid. A similar situation to Carlos Sainz who despite being outqualified every year next to Leclerc, is always just 1 or 2 cars behind on the starting grid. Gaps such as these can fluctuate between two drivers in a given year depending on their adaptability to car characteristics, especially a gap of just 2 tenths. See Ricciardo and Verstappen, separated probably by 2 tenths on average but by no means was it a one sided battle, with both taking wins and each having periods of finishing ahead of the other.

My second point is the more important one. It's how many races Piastri came close to winning or seemed that he was going to win. Everyone remembers the races lost by Norris, mostly because of his poor starts. However, Piastri has several races he came close to winning and most were lost due to team mistakes or unfortunate events. 

1. Miami: In the first few laps, Piastri appeared to have more pace than Norris and was on a charge. However he got affected by the safety car that gave Norris the win. He was ahead of Norris before it came out and had he pitted a lap later, he'd have been ahead of Norris and up till then had shown more pace

2. The stretch of races from Great Britain, Hungary (which he won), Belgium, Italy, Azerbaijan (which he also won) He was in contention for the win in all of these races, and Norris was not. Britain could have easily gone his way had he not been screwed over by Mclaren not wanting to double stack, while he was closing in on Norris. Belgium he almost won but Mclaren opted for a two stop, Norris lost positions off the start. Italy again, Mclaren opted for a two stop when a 1 stop would have been possible had they told both drivers to manage their gap.

I think it is true that Piastris best run of form coincided with Norris' worst. However, had things gone slightly different he could have been looking at 5 wins in 6 races. I think next year will be closer than people think, especially if the field is tight which is when Norris' weaknesses are highlighted and Piastris strengths are shown. But if the Mclarens are clearly the fastest car then I think Norris will have the bigger margin because racecraft and cool headed ness will count for less. ","[""While he has got better, Piastri still isn't as good at managing long stints as Norris. No doubt he is a great driver, and in other less tyre-sensitive regimes he would have been higher up the field.\n\nBut quick over five laps isn't the race."", ""These analysis lose their impact when you fail to accurately point where Piastri needs to improve. You're just talking about his highs, and while they are high, it's his lows you should focus on. If the field is very tight then him being 20-4 in qualy is not a good sign, it literally means that he is pretty much always on the back foot. Another point are the moments where McLaren was the dominant car of the weekend, Piastri struggled to fully maximize the results. There's no reason for Netherlands and Singapore not to be a McLaren 1-2, seeing the pace of Norris. \n\nI agree that the narrative changes too quick and too much at times, but that doesn't mean the narrative is 100% wrong. Piastri needs to improve a lot for his 3rd year and imho he didn't really improve as much as I thought he would from season 1 to season 2. To me that's worrying, but we shall see what happens next season."", "">Miami: In the first few laps, Piastri appeared to have more pace than Norris and was on a charge. However he got affected by the safety car that gave Norris the win. He was ahead of Norris before it came out and had he pitted a lap later, he'd have been ahead of Norris and up till then had shown more pace\n\nWasn't Norris behind Perez when Piastri was upfront and pushing to try and get Verstappen? Because iirc, the pace from Norris greatly increased once Norris got away from Perez (since Perez pit) and Norris was lapping much quicker than those in the front. Everyone but Norris was impacted by the safety car in Miami, which is why Norris says that his Miami win was lucky.\n\n>The stretch of races from Great Britain, Hungary (which he won), Belgium, Italy, Azerbaijan (which he also won) He was in contention for the win in all of these races, and Norris was not.\n\nThe two races in which Norris was not in contention for the win (you can argue Monza if you want but both were in contention for the win there IMO) was Belgium (Norris makes mistakes at the start) and Azerbaijan (Double yellow flag during qualifying means that Norris didnt make it out of Q3 -- Note: Norris charged back through the field and ended P4 after the incident between Sainz and Perez, Norris also held up Perez to help Piastri win here, that's how close he was to the front runners).\n\n>Britain could have easily gone his way had he not been screwed over by Mclaren not wanting to double stack, while he was closing in on Norris.\n\nAnd with another hypothetical scenario Norris could have won, or Verstappen.\n\nThe qualifying head-to-head is 20-4 in favor of Norris and it is important to note that the actual time gap isnt that big between them. However, the other arguments do not lend any favors for Piastri. In the European/summer session, Piastri and Norris were pretty even on points (despite Norris having 0 points at Austria). Both are good drivers. Life happens during the race and that means that drivers sometimes get horrible strategy calls by the team (both Norris and Piastri have experienced this). I hope that Piastri is a lot closer to Norris this season, however, we wont know until the season comes."", ""At the moment I think Norris is simply the better driver.\n\n\nHot take, but as long as Norris stays at McLaren, Piastri will be the 2nd driver.\n\n\nPiastri is good, don't get me wrong, Norris simply has more pace"", ""I suggest you rewatch Miami again.

1i1390j,Jordan's 2000 Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i1390j/jordans_2000_season/,2025-01-14, Discussion,"I'm rewatching the 2000 season at the moment and Jordan's season has peaked my interest. After the heroics of 1999, where the team was punching well above it's weight, Jordan set out to solidify themselves as a top team in 2000. They signed fast Jarno Trulli to replace the demotivated (and retiring) Hill and it was expected that both Jordans could fight at the sharp end of the field. 
In reality, we know how it went. Jordan had a hugely disappointing season, even failing to clinch third in the constructor's championship. This led to the competition with BAR over the factory Honda engines in 2001, putting the team under additional pressure. Jordan declined each year, became a proper backmarker by 2004 and Eddie sold the team. 

But rewatching the 2000 season, Jordan's year is remembered far worse than it was, focusing on pace alone. The Jordan was, over the balance of the season, the third fastest car slightly ahead of the Williams. It achieved front row starts and was a regular top 6 qualifier. Jordan had several races where they ran up front just behind the McLaren's and Ferrari's, on some occasions even splitting them (Australia after both McLaren's retired, Monaco where Trulli ran in P2 for the first half of the race). They were semi-regularly on course for additional podium finishes (both in Australia, Frentzen in Great Britain, Trulli in Monaco, Trulli in Germany and Belgium). Pace-wise the EJ10 (and its B-Spec) wasn't much worse than the 199 from the previous year. 

But it was woefully unreliable. The Jordans finished only 15 out of a possible 34 times and more often than not, they retired in points-paying, sometimes even podium positions. This helped Williams, who were a tad slower overall but much more reliable to achieve third in the constructor's. I personally think if Jordan sacrificed just a bit of speed for more reliability, the car still would have been fast enough to clinch third in the constructor's with something around 40-45 points. They still wouldn't have solidified themselves as a top team, but the outlook for 2001 and beyond would have been much better. Clearly ahead of BAR, no direct competition with them for the Honda works engines, more resources to focus on fine tuning the package.

In a way I think the 2000 season shaped the future and eventual downfall of Jordan. I'd like to know the opinions of others on this. Would a better 2000 have helped Jordan to stay afloat much longer?

Tl;dr Would a more reliable car in 2000 that would have got third in the constructor's have helped Jordan longer term to stay in F1 for longer?","[""I don't think it would have made much of a difference in terms of longevity. This was the era where privateers were basically being priced out as manufacturers flooded in. Best case for them is that Honda stays with them and dumps BAR which means they get bought by Honda in 2005 instead."", ""Jordan were unlucky that season in that they lost a lot of points through no fault of their own and they were disproportionately hit by reliability issues when they were on course for strong results. However, they did also lose a fair few points through driver error. Frentzen putting it in the wall from P2 in Monaco with a handful of laps left and causing the huge pile-up at Monza in a race they'd have been well set to score in are the two biggest examples.\n\nTo answer the second part of your question, I don't think it would've made much difference if they'd had a better 2000. They were getting leapfrogged by Williams in 2001 in any case and while they arguably should've beaten Sauber to fourth that year, they just didn't have the resources to take on the manufacturers. Performance wasn't a factor in Honda choosing BAR over them either since Jordan actually finished ahead of them in 2001 and 2002 and I doubt marginally better results would have changed much."", ""I think it certainly would've helped, because they are a case study in how rapidly F1 can become untangled for a team. Eric Boullier described similar for Lotus in 2014, that when things go poorly the drivers want to leave, the engineers and designers get poached, the good staff look elsewhere, the sponsors get unsure.\n\nHe's said since that McLaren sincerely faced that mid 2017.\n\nLiterally everything starts to unravel very quickly and synergistically.\n\nTrulli was probably my favourite driver in that era (beyond McLaren). I still have a 2001 Jordan hat! It's lasted better than some far newer team wear.\n\nI think Trulli is an absolutely perfect case study in the phenomenon of:\n\n1. driver is seen as poor (HHF)\n\n2. goes to team where he is clear #1 and surprises\n\n3. new driver comes in and grounds him immediately. \n\nIt's unreal how different reliability is now and I appreciate it's perhaps less interesting as a result. Marc Priestley said once that, long-term, the push towards multi-weekend components has meant the cars are fundamentally more endurance cars without a hat, rather than ~2001 where every component was 100% from start to finish, and therefore on the verge of exploding at any moment. Ferrari with a qualifying engine that lasted 12 laps etc.\n\nI sometimes think of how F1 is life on fast forward, that Jordan sort of ate his principles to sack HHF before his home GP, to get Honda engines which might keep the entire team afloat.\n\nThey've said on BBV10s once or twice that an enormous 'what if' is Hill going to Jordan for 1997 where he very probably would've won at least one race."", 'I always wonder how much of the team remains over name and organization changes, are there still people working in the Aston Martin team right now that were part of the team when it was named Jordan?\n\nI remember for example how commentators were saying how happy everyone was when Toro Rosso got their first win, and it was in large part because of how beloved Minardi was and that there was a big feeling that they really deserved a success like that. That was years after the transition from Minardi to Toro Rosso.', ""I'm not so sure Jordan was quicker than Williams anyhow. One thing you have to consider is that Williams had Ralf and a completely unprepared for F1 (by his own admission) Button in the other car.  While Ralf was decent, he was certainly a step below Frentzen."", 'Mugen Honda > Honda works.  \n\nThat whole Jordan -v- BAR to become the official works Honda team was never going to happen for Jordan.  \n\nMugen tuned Hondas were savage. Like the IlMor tuned Merc engines McLaren ran in the late 90s/ 00.\n\nEdit:  My money is on Gazoo Racing tuned Toyotas as the next wave.  McLaren domination was\'t Merc, it was Ilmor, until Paul Morgan died in \'01.    Mugen Honda were destroying the main works BAR honda engine at the time, that it was embarrassing.  Mugen Honda were powering Jordan to places it should never have been even many years before the works Engine came back.  \n \nNew fans:  McLaren Mercedes engine was tuned by a company called IlMor, Mario Illien and Paul Morgan.  Unfortunately, Paul Morgan, the engineering side of the company died in 2001 in an aviation crash, and well, with Illien as the business side, it was never the same again. Though, the recent Merc resurgence, has Ilmor at the heart, somewhere.  \n\nMugen tuned Hondas were insanely good. \n\nGazoo Racing Toyotas...  and seeing their name on the rear wing of a certain team, is absolutely a warning sign.  \n\nWorks engines, but with custom tuning?  .... if Jordan can win races, or McLaren WDCs....\n\nSometimes, the manufacturers get embarrassed by year old engines, custom tuned.  Luckily, Toyota realised this a while back, and why how older fans loved the Mugen Honda, are smitten with Toyota Gazoo Racing on a rear wing of a F1 team this year.    Gazoo Racing mean business.  Wouldn\'t be such a far cry to whisper... Renault are ""quiet quitting.""  \n\nImagine being a head of a car company, and your direct rivals are entering at your lowest ebb, and to make it worse with their custom tuned marque.   Gazoo Racing reputation sprawls all motor racing categories.  \n\nI just wish Honda had embraced Mugen, like Toyota did with Gazoo.', 'I doubt it. Honda only had their sights set on BAR as they could never stomach a volatile personality like Eddie Jordan running a Honda backed team, and claiming that Vodafone had a sponsorship deal with them (in reality they went to Ferrari) was the death blow for them. They never recovered after that.', 'Yeah in 2000 we had Jordan, Prost, Minardi, Benetton, McLaren, Arrows, Sauber and Williams all on the grid as largely privately owned, self funding teams.\n\n\nOver the next few years most of them were gone (Arrows, Prost), de facto works teams (Renault, McLaren Mercedes, BMW Sauber), bought by billionaires as a plaything (Minardi, Jordan).\n\n\nWilliams were the only ones who stayed on as privateers. It was a extraordinarily difficult time to be running an F1 team.', ""All those big manufacturers coming into F1 certainly was a major contributing factor in Jordan's demise. Do you think a better 2000 would have enabled Jordan to at least remain a solid midfield team until they would be eventually bought out? Or could you imagine a Sauber-Like scenario where they would be bought by e.g. Honda and when Honda pulls out in 2008/2009 they would revert back to Jordan?""]",46,29,0.84,46,122,122,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0

I believe the 2025 season might be epic for various reasons, of course the main one being the possibility of having 4 teams (McLaren, Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes) fighting for poles and wins every single weekend.

Another thing that hypes me a lot for this year is the driver pairings. 6 drivers will begin a F1 season for the first time ! As a result we have 8 new duos, only McLaren and Aston Martin kept both of their drivers from 2024.

I would like you to rank each pairing from most to least exciting in terms of performance dynamics : How exicted are you to find out which driver gets the upper hand ? How excited are you to find out about the gap between two teammates ?

Here is how I would rank the teams based on how much I'm looking forward to their teammate battle :

1 FERRARI -> Charles Leclerc vs Lewis Hamilton

2 WILLIAMS -> Carlos Sainz vs Alex Albon

3 MCLAREN -> Lando Norris vs Oscar Piastri

4 MERCEDES -> George Russell vs Kimi Antonelli

5 HAAS -> Esteban Ocon vs Oliver Bearman

6 RACING BULLS -> Yuki Tsunoda vs Isack Hadjar

7 RED BULL -> Max Verstappen vs Liam Lawson

8 SAUBER -> Nico Hulkenberg vs Gabriel Bortoleto

9 ALPINE -> Pierre Gasly vs Jack Doohan

10 ASTON MARTIN -> Fernando Alonso vs Lance Stroll","[""1. Leclerc-Hamilton - no explanation needed\n2. Albon-Sainz - a potential make or break battle for either driver's career\n3. Ocon-Bearman - a good battle of an experienced midfield driver and a highly rated rookie\n4. Hulkenberg-Bortoleto - a good battle of a veteran and a highly rated rookie\n5. Norris-Piastri - an overrated battle, Norris should win comfortably again\n6. Tsunoda-Hadjar - one Yuki should win but with some intrigue with Hadjar an unknown quantity\n7. Russell-Antonelli - likely to be a walkover with Antonelli too raw for a potentially race-winning seat, but a small chance it may turn out differently\n8. Verstappen-Lawson - won't be a contest\n9.

I'd suspect that the next young driver that will, is Lindblad. Therefore I'm not really that excited given the stakes are lower.\n\nSauber is a bit higher given unlike with Bearman, Bortoleto hasn't driven in F1 yet.

We know Alonso is better, and Stroll’s not getting swapped.', 'Ocon and Bearman should be higher imo, I actually think it’s one of the most underrated driver parings for next season as Ocon is a very capable midfield driver and Bearman looked probably the most exciting out of all the rookies last season \n\nI think Ocon will comfortable beat him but Bearman’s progress over the season will certainly be interesting to see.', ""I'd put red bull and mercedes above mclaren.
