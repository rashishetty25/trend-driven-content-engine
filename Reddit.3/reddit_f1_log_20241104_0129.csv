1giyx4y,Short analysis of the red flag and (horrible) strategy calls ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1giyx4y/short_analysis_of_the_red_flag_and_horrible/,2024-11-03, Discussion,"Hello Formula 1 fans, 

I just want to clear up a apparent misunderstanding of how the red flag actually benefited Verstappen in today's win. 

It all starts in lap 27 when Hulkenberg got stuck somewhere on turn 1, after the rain got increasingly more intense. Norris already asked a few times to be pit, since the intermediates from the start are getting more worn for most of the grid, which means less grip and a harder time for all of them to keep the car on track. 

# Lap 28/29 

Both of the leaders dive into the pit to try and get a cheap pit stop under the VSC conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/itpieu32bryd1.png?width=2472&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0a709e49f502ae77a817621aa7253fc60bc945

Gap back to Verstappen is about 19 seconds under the VSC conditions. Gap in racing conditions before the VSC was called was about 13 seconds. As seen in the photo, the VSC was ending when both of them came into the pit. 

# Lap 30 

Both of them have pitted, but notably they have both pitted on new intermediates instead of wet weather tires. The gap is now 13 seconds in favor of Verstappen. During all of this the rain intensity is at the peak of the race, and the conditions would call for wet tires, as shown by Tsunoda. He was about 17 seconds back from the lead pair at the point of pitting. He did however pit himself and at lap 30 he was already only 7 seconds back.

About 10 seconds after the above screenshot a safety car is called, since the conditions are about to be undrivable. Tsunoda in a timespan of about 10 seconds made up 4 whole seconds on his wet tires.

# Lap 32 

After a few laps behind the safety car, Colapinto find the wall and the Red Flag is called. The order under the red flag does not change.

# So how did the red flag benefit Verstappen? 

(This is the opinionated part, so please discuss if you think different) 

  
The real benefit of the red flag to Verstappen and a lot of the grid behind is obviously the free pit stop. However, the positions from Norris and Russell are arguably already won when they decided to pit under the VSC for new intermediate tires. 

If the red flag, or safety car had not been called they would have lost time to anyone that pitted for wet tires. Its in my opinion very likely that they would have had to pit again under the conditions we have seen, and with the wet tire runners so much faster. 

If there was only the safety car called, Verstappen would be in front of them anyway. In this case I think a few different things could have happened depending on the rain intensity. Whats most likely is that Verstappen would have tried to stay out as long as possible on his old intermediates, unsure if they can make the whole race, but it would have been interesting to see, especially since it would have taken a long time to clear enough standing water for a rolling restart, so I think the remaining laps under speed would have been about \~30 laps, but probably less, since it was raining a lot. 

In any case, I think the red flag was not the deciding factor for Verstappen today, but Red Bulls and Verstappens choice to stay out and not switch tires. 

Norris and Russell got new intermediates, so that was a gamble from them on a safety car as well, since there was no way to drive on anything other than wets at that point, and they would be dropped behind Ocon, Gasly and Verstappen. Really unsure what that strategy call was. 

Love to hear corrections and your input, good night to everyone going to sleep! 

","[""Switching to Wet is useless most of the time, if we're under Wet conditions it means a red flag is coming, we don't see wet tyres racing anymore.

The conditions alone almost called for it.

Of course, they want to get as many points as possible but at the moment, they should focus on out-scoring Verstappen. So I don\'t understand, why they even considered pitting Norris before Verstappen. The VSC is the ""weakest"" advantage they could get (Safety Car is better and red flag obviously even more). And in these conditions, even losing this advantage would have been better than getting into a position where Verstappen has a potentially better option of going into the pits later on in the race.']",82,35,0.77,82,32,32,23,9,0.010000000000000009,23

There seems to be multiple people and sources saying there was ""long time"" between crash and Verstappen dropping out of top 10. Rewatched to confirm. First picture is moment yellow flags are thrown out (graphic isn't even fully shown yet), second one (1 second later) shows Leclerc making into top 10.

Biggest loser here was Bottas who was robbed since Albon and Lawson got their times done (Albon when time left 1:09, Lawson when time left 1:03).

Tldr: no, there was less than 1 second for stewards to react for red flag which is basically impossible. Red Bulls dropped because they left themself last.

1gig99z,The State of F1's Safety Car Interventions,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gig99z/the_state_of_f1s_safety_car_interventions/,2024-11-03, Statistics,"After the concerning delay in declaring a Virtual Safety Car during this weekend's sprint race, much has been said about F1's officiating attempting to rig the results of races to make better TV. This accusation is, after the end of the 2021 season, potentially justified. However, the discussion has been doing an incredible disservice to the fact that the past few seasons have been an ongoing showcase of a potentially dangerous slowness to deploy Safety Cars, Virtual Safety Cars, or red flags. To educate myself and (hopefully) the rest of the subreddit, I went back and reviewed very SC/VSC intervention so far this season and made note of how long it took the race director to make the decision and neutralize the race. 

  
TL;DR up front, because this is going to be long; the average time this season between an incident occurring and a VSC or SC being deployed is a whopping \*48 seconds.\* 

  
Quick methodology notes up front: I used the very helpful [list of safety car interventions this season](https://www.lightsoutblog.com/every-safety-car-f1-2024/) by Nick Haldenby at Lights Out Blog, and went back to each race with the F1TV feed, the live timing, and a stopwatch. For cars that stopped alongside or on the track, I started the clock at the point when the car stopped moving (assuming that they wouldn't want to intervene in a race if a driver can quickly get moving again). Twice this season we've had VSC's deployed due to debris on the track, at Miami and Austria -- I've chosen not to include these as they would skew the average time calculation. So, here's the list:

  
Saudi Arabia, Lap 6: Stroll into the barriers, 50 seconds

Australia, lap 17: Hamilton stops on track, 20 seconds (from the moment of stoppage -- he did spend a long time trying to limp the car back)

Australia, lap 58: Russell into the barriers, 12 seconds

Japan, lap 1: Albon and Ricciardo collide, 23 seconds (race red-flagged)

China, lap 22: Bottas stops in the runoff, 1 minute 37 seconds (this was the incident reposted today of him exiting his car while standing at the end of the braking zone, under only yellow flags)

China, lap 27: Tsunoda and Magnussen collide, 15 seconds

Miami (sprint), lap 1: Norris and Stroll collide, 58 seconds

Miami, lap 29: Sargeant and Magnussen collide, 24 seconds

Monaco, lap 2: Perez/Hulk/Magnussen collide, 39 seconds (race red-flagged -- had to open Perez' onboard for this to even figure out when the crash occurred)

Canada, lap 25: Sargeant into the barriers, 40 seconds

Canada, lap 54: Sainz and Albon collide, 27 seconds

Azerbaijan, lap 50: Perez and Sainz collide, 1 minute 35 seconds

Austin, lap 2: Hamilton into the gravel, 53 seconds

Mexico, lap 1: Tsunoda into the barrier, 41 seconds

Brazil (sprint), lap 22: Hulkenberg stops on track, 2 minutes 2 seconds

  
The fastest reaction was a mere 12 seconds in Australia, while the longest came yesterday at 2 minutes and 2 seconds. However, that does still leave our average time at 48 seconds for this season. I did not take notes on every incident's on-track battles, but did notice that they didn't seem to favor one team consistently throughout the season. Without inside information that I doubt we'll ever see, it's impossible to know whether the delays are coming from a communications issue, a lack of confidence, or a desire to leave it as late as possible so the racing can continue (a la the old ""Racing back to the caution"" rule that NASCAR rightly did away with in the 2000's). Regardless, this is very clearly an ongoing issue, going back years, Taking longer than 60 seconds to make the decision for intervention should be a rare occasion, and yet we've had 3 such incidents this season.

  
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do the same analysis for the 2023 season yet, but I would like to. Without a convenient pre-made list of SC and VSC interventions, it's a bit more work, but if people would like me to I'll happily keep working on it (I might do anyway, just for my own curiosity). 

  
In parting, this specifically came out of my frustration at seeing people saying things like, ""any other race and they'd have sent the VSC out right away,"" when I clearly remembered this being a pattern of behavior from the officials. It's good to be aware of the potential for issues like that, but in situations like this where driver safety is being potentially placed at risk, it detracts \*HEAVILY\* from a very real, very concerning pattern. ","['Quality post and effort OP. This also reminds me of how long race control took before deploying a safety car back at Baku 2021 for either Stroll or Verstappen‚Äôs retirement when their tires randomly blew up. I remember after the race it was found that multiple drivers ignored the double waved yellows in that section by going significantly faster, yet in the end no one got a penalty for it. This has consistently been an issue like you said.\n\nEdit: [This article goes into further detail about how long it took for the Safety Car to be deployed for their crashes, and mentions how Masi wasn‚Äôt satisfied with how some drivers failed to slow sufficiently for double waved yellows](https://www.racefans.net/2021/06/09/eight-safety-questions-raised-by-azerbaijan-grand-prix-crashes-and-f1s-reaction/)', 'I saw that hulkenberg was moving (in neutral presumably) after the start of the double yellows. \n\nWhen did he stop moving? Was it a huge gap between him stopping completely and him getting out of the car?', ""I'm a marshall at Monza and I will try to explain why there's usually a long delay from the incident to the actual decision\n\nFirst of all a marshall has to report the incident to the race director to asses the conditions of the track and the driver, it's not so easy to do from the camera feed but a marshall that is right there at like 10m or less can easily evaluate the situation better.\n\nThen the circuit race director has to translate what is being said (because for us we communicate in Italian but the FIA race director understands English) and the FIA race director has to make a decision\n\nKeep in mind that usually as long as the car it's still limping around and the driver is not out they won't ever give out a VSC or a SC because it's always better to just wave a double yellow and let the driver bring the car to safety\n\nIn cases like Australia I highly doubt that there was even some sort of communication between the track marshall and the race director, they gave the VSC too quickly so I suppose the fia race director decided without hearing the marshalls (and rightfully so, I'm not blaming the decision it was the right thing to do)\n\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of communication between the track marshalls and the race director then again between the two of them. Then the decision is given out which in turn takes another few seconds\n\nIt's never as easy as on TV you might think it is, and also trust me a race director does not want to use a SC or a VSC (while on the FCY they are more favorable because it's a lot better)\n\n\nAlso it's worth noting that if an accident happens like at turn 1 but all the cars are already past that point they will tend to wait for the sc/vsc, because marshalls might be able to remove the car in like 20/30 seconds without having the need to deploy a safety measure. In case the sc/vsc is deployed they will let them race up until almost the end of the lap so they get a bit more action before having the race neutralized"", 'The worst thing is if I‚Äôm remembering correctly even there fastest of 12 seconds was to slow considering the scenario, Russel was upside down in a high speed section with debris up in the air blocking vision of Russel, so within that 12 seconds  a car almost drove directly into the underfloor of russels car, a red flag should of immediately been thrown out in this situation, it‚Äôs just not good enough and unfortunately seems like it is going to take another fatal accident before they tighten up these calls.', 'Agree this is a quality post! What I don‚Äôt get is why the VSC cannot be deployed right away, even for just a few seconds, when something is clearly happening at the track. Almost as a swift replacement for double-waved yellows in most situation. Then full SC can be deployed within 30-60 seconds if deemed crucial. That was the whole point of introducing the VSC: not to have all the issues and instances OP rightfully brought up!', ""I watch a lot of feeder series as well, and the thing I note in both places is that sometimes flags or safety cars or other things aren't called until they imminently need to be called for safety. What I mean is that if the accident happens at turn one, and in two seconds all the cars are past turn one before anything could possibly be called... well, the cars won't be back around to turn one for more than a minute, sometimes much more depending on the track. So, often I think officials let it go for a bit so that we can get some more active racing while they aren't actually near a hazard. In several feeder series, they are much more likely than F1 to not call a safety car of any kind if some yellows or double yellows around one area are sufficient, and then they are active racing around the rest of the lap."", 'Do you also know the average time without the 2 minutes and 2 seconds from yesterday? I would expect that the average would be way down then and even shows more what of an outlier yesterday was.', 'Just a note - WEC/GT3 series (SRO based) have a mandated decision time of 45 seconds to call a VSC/SC or leave it under local yellows.', ""You have to consider, that safety car deployment will take longer / is delayed on purpose, if all cars are are close to each other with no back trackers and the fiele has already patheted the yellow sector.\n\nFor example first lap accidents or accidents after safety car restarts.\n\nThere is no risk in waiting to deploy the SC until sector 3, if the crash happens in sector 1 and that's what is done every time.\n\nFor red flag incidents it is different and they tend to call it faster to avoid a mess regarding restarting positions and to allow cars to cool down before returning to box.""]",363,103,0.94,363,872,872,4,0,0.0,4

1gi5jfq,"So, what's actually in the rules if there is no qualifying session?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gi5jfq/so_whats_actually_in_the_rules_if_there_is_no/,2024-11-02, Discussion,"We've all heard different things from different commentators, so I went and checked the text of the [Sporting Regulations for 2024](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_1_-_2023-09-26.pdf) and, surprisingly, I couldn't find anything that deals directly with a qualifying session being cancelled.

The closest thing I could find is the rule about drivers that are not classified at the end of a qualifying session (39.4.b):

>Drivers will be considered to be ‚Äúunclassified‚Äù in the following circumstances:

>i) If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race Director.

>ii) If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted

>iii) If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint shootout

Unless this is covered by some other rule that I didn't see (if so, apologies for wasting your time), if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:

>The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows:

>\- Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 **(or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)**

If I understand correctly, then it has to be Free Practice 1 classification order and the commentators that mentioned the possibility of Stewards using a different order are incorrect. I wonder if the rest of Rule 39.4.b is the cause of this misunderstanding:

>The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters such as:

>\- A suitable lap time being set in another practice session  
\- The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the Championship  
\- The gravity of the offence which caused the driver‚Äôs disqualification

which is about allowing drivers that did not classify at the end of the qualifying session to start the race and not about their position in the grid if allowed. Usually drivers are allowed to start the race unless there are serious driver / car performance or safety concerns.

Did I miss something?

Final note: the Rule on moving the qualifying session is quite straightforward, basically the Race Director and Stewards can do whatever they want (inside FIA rules) based on Rule 15.3.a:

>The clerk of the course shall work in permanent consultation with the Race Director. The Race Director shall have overriding authority in the following matters and the clerk of the course may give orders in respect of them only with his express agreement:

>a) The control of free practice, qualifying session, sprint shootout, sprint session and the race, adherence to the timetable and, if he deems it necessary, the making of any proposal to the stewards to modify the timetable in accordance with the Code or Sporting Regulations.","['Fuck knows', ""the truth is there is no precedent. race director will make the final call if the qualifying doesn't go through.\n\nalthough i personally feel if the weather is bad enough for there to be no qualifying whatsoever then it is really ambitious to hope for a race to happen as well."", ""Stewards discretion seems to be the most likely option but teams will protest for sure. It's going to be a hot mess.\n\nAlthough it probably won't matter looking at the forecast"", ""Time for Verstappen to pull a Hamilton '21\n\nWe're here for it"", ""Logical answer: sprint quali grid\n\nProbable answer: some FIA moment ruling that hasn't been thought of makes FP1 the race grid session."", ""You did not miss anything i think, there is no rule yet.\n\n>if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:\n\nThat is the question. If quali doesn't happen at all, does that mean that all 20 drivers failed to set a lap time during Q1 in the sense of this regulation?

I witnessed and followed the Senna and Schumaker years closely. Truth be told, I was not a great fan of either driver. Both had a steely, almost narcissistic obsession with winning and coming second was not an option. The cacophony of noise that followed them (prior to social media) was deafening.

Senna was described as a danger to himself, and other drivers, and it would only be a matter of time before he caused a serious (potentially fatal) crash. It was said that he meditated deeply prior to the race and that he believed that he was guided by some higher power, which made him untouchable in the race. It was claimed that he remained sitting in his car when the race was interrupted (red flagged) often for long periods, as he did not want anything to break this mental focus.¬† It was said that his ‚Äúcrazy beliefs‚Äù rather than exceptional talent, was the only explanation for the crazy high speeds he was able to able to race at, in very poor conditions with near zero visibility!

Interesting to see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. One can only love F1!","['Thanks for this!\n\n(Almost 60)', 'I am amongst the many long-term F1 fans who lurk here.  I clearly remember the highly touted rookie Jean Alesi being talked about during his first race....', ""These are the things you don't hear about Senna.  He seems to be almost deified.  It's amazing to think that 20 years from now the same could happen to Max if he died dramatically during a race just before clinching the championship this season.\n\nWhat would we all remember in 20 years?  What would the new F1 fans know of him?  Would this type of idolization no longer be possible thanks to social media and the Internet or would it be even more dangerously seductive?"", 'I follow F1 since I caught the Arnoux / Villeneuve duel at the 1979 french GP. Got hooked that day.\n\nI remember how the french press frequently talked about Senna mysticism. Prost himself hinted that Ayrton was something else. Sometimes possessed. That he seemed to feel protected by some higher power and that was somewhat concerning.\n\nSenna was definitely controversial at the time. With time (and the 2010 documentary) that aspect of Ayrton has been rather forgotten.', 'F1 drivers are generally ruthless bastards.\xa0\n\n\nSome have better out of car personalities but inside the cockpit they are not your friend.', ""I have a small question, has F1 always been this revisionist in terms of looking at past greats? I've been following F1 a little since Vettel dominated and very closely since 2017 onwards, which was when Lewis and Mercedes were at their peak, and I remember how much irrational hate both Lewis and Seb faced just for winning so much, and that's also a little visible with Max now. Was it the same case with Schumacher as well? Nowadays most people, including me, adore him but that's only because we only ever heard of the legend. I'm even more interested about Senna because death made Senna something of a legend, compared to other contemporaries like Prost, what was the opinion of Senna before he died, and how did people rate him compared to his contemporaries, especially Prost?\xa0"", 'While I admire Senna for what he could do with a car, he was also the one driving slowly during qualifying (back then an hour running with all cars) if he had set a good lap, so other could not make a fast enough lap. It was within the rules of the day, and he milked them. Just like Schumacher, Hamilton, Verstappen did/do in their years.

I realize every track is different and Haas will likely not get to the points in every race for the rest off the season but their upward trend seems obvious. I do not have a deep technical understanding but a lot of people seem to view the 2025 season as an extension of 2024 when it comes to car development due to no rule changes and the maturity of the current rule set. Based on that Haas is probably in a better position for next year than they have been in at least 5 years.

Back to Ocon. On the face of it, he had a horrible season. He lost the power battle within Alpine to his arch rival, was publicly demoted to nr 2 and then announced not to be extended. It seems like he was lucky that Haas offered him a seat at all (although i personally believe he is a solid choice and deserves a seat in F1). In previous years, a change from Alpine/ Renault to Haas would have been a strong demotion, but since this year it is actually a bit of a promotion?! Haas has more than 3x the points of Alpine and the whole saga around the Alpine engine does not seem like they will calmly work to improve the car again?

Long story short: Did Ocon lose his seat to luck into a significantly better team next year? Sort of the reverse Sainz?","['Getting your hopes up for HAAS crushing it next season is a good way to get hurt.', ""Ocon was actively trying to leave Alpine. They basically announced they were not extending a driver who didn't want to extend with them in the first place. \n\nI'd say, probably, from his point of view just getting away from Alpine was a win. Haas performing better than Alpine is just a nice bonus."", 'Never completely trust Haas.', 'Not sure what to think about Ocon and Alpine. I mean alpine let him go and Monaco was probably a good excuse at that but reports were that Ocon had been shopping around even before the 2024 season started. \n\nI really would like to know what happened between Ocon and Alpine because he got a 3 year contract in 2021 and things seemingly were on the up. I think Ocon was just glad to get out of Alpine and the relationship has clearly suffered. \n\nHe even said very recently that he‚Äôs lost enjoyment for racing and is just going through the motions at this point. Alpine themselves have lost out on, in my opinion, the best midfield pairing on the grid. Gasly and Ocon are two drivers who I‚Äôd want if I was leading a team in the midfield and I‚Äôm not sure if Doohan is really a great replacement but we can only see until he‚Äôs in that car. \n\nBack to the original point, Haas are doing well and Komatsu has done a great job however we don‚Äôt know whether that will correlate to next year. They‚Äôre on a good trajectory but they also were in 2018 and then produced a car that was a tyre shredder in 2019. If Haas continue to be on a good trajectory and produce a car that starts challenging the top 4 teams then yes, Ocon is a huge winner out of all of this.', 'Trusting in Haas not to cock it up is quite brave', 'Three teams on the grid you must never trust even if they show form and signs of having gotten their shit together:\n\n1. Ferrari\n\n2. McLaren \n\n3. Haas', ""If Haas can keep this trajectory going then I'd say he's the winner of silly season, not just one of. It'll be the definition of failing upward.\n\nBig if though but Alpine aren't going anywhere positive either."", 'The midfield is forever in flux.\n\nAlpine‚Äôs said their 2025 car is completely different, and the upgrades they brought at COTA are part of their 2025 development. They‚Äôre taking home a lot of windtunnel time as well to develop their car. They‚Äôre also taking the Merc engine for 26, which is supposedly the best available for those reg‚Äôs.\n\nHaas is having a really good year this year. But we don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll further progress for next year, if they‚Äôll slip back, or stay the same. They‚Äôre having less windtunnel time than they‚Äôre used to next year.\n\nCould be either of them, and then it could all change again for 26. Personally I‚Äôd bet on Alpine long term out of the two. \n\nI also think there‚Äôs security in Gasly‚Äôs position (being the only french thing left in the french national team) which should help him extend if he doesn‚Äôt get other offers. Meanwhile Ocon is more vulnerable to this being his last contract by not having those kind of ties, plus Merc who he‚Äôs tied to has passed him over once again.', 'A lot of people down playing haas.

He explained that at least twice haha', 'Not only 10 WDC, but 2 dudes who spent an entire season terrorizing each other with stuff like this, laughing at this poor dude.', 'Lando was kinda flustered üòÇ Having the two most talented drivers in recent times giggling about you in live must feel a bit embarassing even if they were just pulling his leg.', 'Maybe this reminds them of Alonso giving Nico the business at Bahrain all those years ago. lol', 'Made for the most interesting start to a race in a while with George taking advantage and Max having to recover that.', 'Imagine having 10 WDCs outright laughing at you lol. Based on his sulking face after this exchange, I think he realized that if Max and Lewis agree so strongly on something, he may be in the wrong.', '‚ÄúThere was enough space to keep it on the track‚Äù, he was on the grass Lando lol. Good hard racing though, hopefully it continues the rest of the year.', 'If 10 world championships and two of the most risky / aggressive drivers agree and giggle at the thought of this, chances are you‚Äôre not correct. \n\nthese two are responsible for all but 1 of the last decades worth of championships', 'Both max and lewis gave same answer many times. They know what that exactly mean.', 'I don‚Äôt think it was a huge issue. But, as in far it was an issue it was more how Lando positioned the car than where he positioned the car. Looking from the onboard of Max you can see that Lando makes two separate moves into Max as the car is already partly alongside. Not knowing how far Lando will move at each change of direction is what actually makes Max steer off track. Lando leaves enough space - barely - but it‚Äôs the (somewhat) erratic nature of how he does it which is open to some critique I think.\n\nI looked at Maxs onboard of the sprint start in USA GP for comparison and although Leclerc is never alongside as far as Max was yesterday, Max is steering in a very clear line and it seems somewhat ‚Äòeasier‚Äô for Leclerc to read the intent and where the space will be.\n\nEDIT: just to be clear, I think it‚Äôs a good no penalty, but I also think Lando is not as in the clear as he seems to think here.']",6248,464,0.99,6248,33245,33245,6248,464,0.99,6248
