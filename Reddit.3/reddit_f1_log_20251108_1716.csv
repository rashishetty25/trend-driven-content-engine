so I buy both apple TV and F1TV app $29.99 per year subscription, try watch in apple TV nothing there it seems till 2026

open F1 TV app, says I need a “pro” subscription (after paying $30) and it seems I need to go to the site to get that

then I go to F1 site, click watch sprint there, and then it says upgrade sub, click that, when I get to the next page it just says manage subscription on Apple F1 app and there is nothing to upgrade here

1ors8jt,im starting to think that F1 is trying everything in their power to be as ANTI-Racing as possible.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ors8jt/im_starting_to_think_that_f1_is_trying_everything/,2025-11-08, Discussion,"At this point its getting a bit ridiculous and its draining the love i once had for the sport. Every race is just terribly executed. Im watching the 8 hours of bahrain as we speak. and its so refreshing to see a motorsport BE a motorsport. we dont have that in F1 anymore. It likes to brand itself as the pinnacle. But its not, it really isnt.

  
The broadcasting is just bad. Theyre trying everything to miss as much as possible. As someone who likes to simrace, im racing in a gt3 league currently. where there is better broadcasting to be found. by 2 dudes and 5 viewers. Im not even kidding. almost constant picture in picture. to constantly switching at the right times. Its much better than f1 and i stand by it. they should be ashamed, that 2 amateurs can broadcast a 40 person race and miss less than probably a dozen professionals with half the cars. 



The calls they make are just beyond ridiculous. i get it, sometimes you cant always get it right. but with the VSC last race and the call here to do a rolling start. its so obvious you dont do any of those things. it kills the action and its not even for safety because there is no risk to be had. Its an entertainment industry and they cant figure out how to get more people hooked. 

Maybe not killing the action as it happens help boosts the number. 

  
i am writing this out of frustration and im sure theres much more instances to name. but my brain is just cluttered because im honestly baffled by how bad f1 is compared to other series. 



All that oil money. and still no good racing...

RB improved their car and had a run of tracks that were also better suited to them.
