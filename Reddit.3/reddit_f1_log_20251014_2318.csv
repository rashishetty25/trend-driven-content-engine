1o6a1ui,Most underrated F1 races?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o6a1ui/most_underrated_f1_races/,2025-10-14, Discussion,"As the title says, what do you guys think are the most underrated F1 races? Races that were quietly great but overshadowed by other races during the season?

For me, I would pick:

Brazil 2022: IMO, this is the best race of the season (even above Silverstone) but it gets a bit forgotten these days because it happened during the second half where Max started to dominate. Russell's first win, Merc 1-2, Charles getting tonked on the first lap by Lando but recovering to finish 4th, Red bull drama, Alonso recovery to finish 5th from 17th. The entire weekend was just great tbh starting with Magnussen's shock pole.

Italy 2023: Another race that gets forgotten because it happened during Max's dominance but it was quite fun, mainly because of Sainz fighting the red bulls and then the battle between Charles and himself. (No risk charles, no risk)

USA 2022: Another race overshadowed by Max's dominance but actually a really great race. Sainz getting tonked by Russell on lap 1, multiple safety cars, Alonso sent flying by Stroll but still recovering to finish in the points, Charles' majestic recovery drive and his (mini) battle with Max, RBR's botched pitstop which meant we briefly got to see Max and Lewis battli for the lead and, of course, Seb driving like an absolute madman to hold off Magnuessen on the line. (He even led the race briefly!)

Suzuka 2022: For a rain curtailed race, this was pretty good. Max and Charles tearing away from the rest of the pack in the first few laps was crazy (until Charles' tires fell off), Charles going off at the last few corners to let Perez through, Alonso and Seb's crazy battle to the line... a good race considering the circumstances. 

I am a newer F1 fan so I can't speak much for older races.

I have a basic question about the application form: **Are the ""Current Salary"" and ""Required Salary"" fields referring to the gross** ***Annual*** **salary in GBP (¬£)?** In Chile, we usually talk about monthly salary, so I want to make sure I am answering this correctly.
