Piastri has admitted it all season, but Norris seems to try and downplay it as much as possible.', ""The only difference in level is their driver and their strategy team.\n\n>\xa0He could have won round one, I think he was pretty close to winning\n\nYou mean Australia? Where they put 16 seconds on Max in 13 laps, and only a safety car closed the gap after which the gap was 4 seconds again shortly after before Norris and Piastri made a mistake and went of, and only another SC allowed Max to fight for the win for a few laps in the end?\n\nMonza is the only race where they were actually fastest out of 17 weekends so far, and that was a small margin as well until Mclaren threw away 15 seconds by gambling both cars on a stupid strategy that hinged entirely on a SC happening in a very small window of 2-3 laps because you having 2 cars available means you don't split strategies of course, imagine of one of them actually gets the right one, better have both on a stupid one so it's fair.\n\nVast majority of RBR's success is Max taking advantage of Mclaren not optimizing their qualifying and their weekend.""]",0,103,0.44,0,918,918,0,0,0.0,0
