He said that electric and sustainable fuels are two ways towards the same end goal - meaning we need to reduce carbon emissions, and that how we do it doesn't matter as long as we hit the target"", 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Mohammed bin Sulayem is once again pushing for new engine regulations. A few months ago, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident wanted to bring the naturally aspirated V10 back into Formula 1. Now there\'s a new idea. Furthermore, a twelfth F1 team could emerge.**\n\n> It was one of the most controversial political issues of the current Formula 1 season: the engine regulations for the upcoming season. Next year, there will be new power units. The electric component will increase to almost 50 percent, while the rest of the power will continue to be generated by the conventional 1.6-liter V6 turbo.\n\n> Since the start of the season, several teams and engine manufacturers in the paddock have been pursuing a policy against the new rules. Ferrari and Red Bull in particular are leading the way. Both top teams are apparently concerned about falling behind Mercedes on the powertrain side. Ferrari team principal Frédéric Vasseur and his Red Bull counterpart Christian Horner have advocated for a V10 comeback.\n\n> Both the Frenchman and the Englishman walked through a door opened by the current FIA President, Mohammed bin Sulayem. In February of this year, he announced that the team would be using synthetic fuel starting in 2026 anyway. This would have addressed the sustainability aspect. A return to the loud, screeching V10 naturally aspirated engines, so popular with fans, would be an option.\n\n> Bin Sulayem likely hoped to increase his popularity in Europe with this move. His first term ends in December 2025. He is seeking re-election as FIA President. He doesn\'t have many fans on the Old Continent.\xa0Since the Silverstone weekend, he has had a rival candidate\xa0in the race for the position: Tim Mayer.\n\n> **Engine meeting in Bahrain fizzles out.**\nThe V10 issue escalated so quickly that an engine meeting was called for the fourth Bahrain Grand Prix in mid-April. Bin Sulayem, F1 boss Stefano Domenicali, and the power unit manufacturers were present, as were the power unit manufacturers, who presented their positions. Mercedes and newcomer Audi declared that they would have no engines for next year if the regulations were changed to naturally aspirated V10s at short notice. The proposal was rejected.\n\n> A few months later, Mohammed bin Sulayem is now upping the ante. He told the news agency Reuters: ""The current engines are so complicated and very expensive. The research and development costs reach $200 million (around €170 million), and the engine costs about $1.8 million to $2.1 million.""\n\n> The 63-year-old is therefore emphasizing the advantages of the simpler naturally aspirated engines. Unlike in Winter, however, he is now offering a naturally aspirated V8 as an option. According to the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident, this should be half the price of the current and future engines.\n\n> The new engine regulations are actually designed to run for five years. However, there\'s the possibility of shortening the interval. Naturally aspirated engines could return in 2029 at the earliest. ""We have to do it quickly. It takes three years, so hopefully we\'ll have something by 2029,"" Bin Sulayem insists.\n\n> **Will a twelfth team come from China?**\nIn addition to the engine issue, Mohammed bin Sulayem also commented on a possible twelfth racing team in the premier class. After Cadillac fought its way into the championship against the wishes of the established F1 teams and will enter the race with a Ferrari engine in 2026, another newcomer is expected to join, according to the former rally driver.\n\n> ""The time will come when we believe it is right to reopen a bidding round,"" said Bin Sulayem. The twelfth team should come from China, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident explained.\n\n> Would the existing racing teams welcome this? Hardly. The team\'s payout fee would be reduced because more parties would get a piece of the pie. This was already a major contentious issue in the Cadillac case. Only after the US Congress launched an investigation into Formula 1, because the Americans considered the reasoning for its rejection to be unlawful, was Cadillac granted entry into the premier class.', ""It's all likely just nonsense and smoke, but I'd take just about anything pure ICE over the current lame duck PU formula."", ""I don't see either a V8 or V10 happening any time soon.

Apologies for being a bit late to the party since the Festival itself has already kicked off earlier today, but since all the stream recordings will stay up (and you can rewind the broadcast back to the segments you missed plus each day gets a full replay before the next one begins), I thought folks would still find this thread useful.

For all the information below I checked the official social media accounts and website for Goodwood and the F1 teams, and unfortunately some just straight up had no info about their participation at the event (at least not yet).

The full FOS timetable and entry list can be found following the links [here](https://www.goodwood.com/motorsport/festival-of-speed/plan-your-day/timetable/) and [here](https://www.goodwood.com/grr/event-coverage/festival-of-speed/2025-festival-of-speed-entry-list/)
