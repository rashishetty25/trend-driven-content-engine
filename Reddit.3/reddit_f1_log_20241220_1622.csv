To better integrate into the Italian team, as well as Loic Serra himself, the English driver is taking Italian lessons and it was no coincidence that he expressed a few words in our language already in Abu Dhabi, while entering the Ferrari box. “99% of our work is in English but I think it is nice to know how to speak a little Italian for the mechanics and for the relationship within the team” – said Fred Vasseur in this regard, who then took care to underline also in a somewhat joking manner that “it is not essential for performance”. \n\n\nVasseur: “It wasn’t difficult to convince Hamilton that the Ferrari project was excellent”\n\n\nBetween the end of last year and the beginning of 2024 , the planets aligned to bring Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari. “I think sometimes it\'s also a question of coincidences and last year they were all there, that is, Lewis was on the market and Ferrari had a seat available.” – said the Ferrari TP at the traditional Christmas lunch in Maranello, who then wanted to focus on the arguments useful for convincing the seven-time world champion to accept the offer of the Italian team. “First of all, in 2023 we won more races than Mercedes. And the start of the season had also been good, so it wasn\'t too difficult to convince him that Ferrari would be a good project . And I think he had been thinking about driving for Ferrari for at least 20 years because we were already discussing it in 2004,” revealed the French manager.\n\n\nThe seven-time world champion will arrive at Ferrari after a very long experience in a team like Mercedes , quite different in its working methods and without that Niki Lauda who was fundamental initially and who made the environment within the Anglo-German team very special. “I am not sure that we have to do a copy and paste of what Mercedes did, where the environment worked very well at the beginning, a little less at the end.” – said Vasseur – “My objective in fact is not to do a copy and paste of what has been done in the past, or to try to attract all the people from Mercedes and to create a Mercedes team that have not been champions in the last two or three years, but to find the best way to manage Lewis differently with our team, with our guys and our resources”. \n\n\n\nVasseur believes that managing the Leclerc-Hamilton duo will be even easier than the Leclerc-Sainz duo \n\n\nMuch of the curiosity of the insiders during the next season will be to understand and see how Fred Vasseur will be able to manage the desire of Charles Leclerc to enter the history of Ferrari by winning his first world title and that of a seven-time world champion who would further enter the history of F1 by becoming the first driver to win 8 world championships, the last with a Ferrari that has not won it since the now distant 2007 (drivers). ""This year my challenge was to manage Charles and Carlos, but I think it was part of our performance because I am truly convinced that emulation in the team is the key to the performance of the entire team , "" said the French manager, who thinks in a way that is practically opposite to the Red Bull identity, where all the efforts are concentrated on the Verstappen side of the box. \n\n\n“We had a couple of heated moments between Charles and Carlos. Monza 2023 or even Las Vegas 2024 for example. But in the end, I think it was beneficial for the team’s performance .” – said Vasseur, who then wanted to explain how these sporting disagreements have never damaged the Scuderia in terms of points collected – “Managing Charles and Lewis? I’m not particularly worried, given that they have a huge mutual respect and know each other well. They have been talking about their future relationship for months now. And I think it’s much better to fight for the very first positions on the grid rather than fighting for the last and I think it’s a good problem for a team to have this type of discussion . And I’m really convinced once again that the team’s performance also comes from the emulation between the two”.', 'They\'re two mature drivers. And both his ""protogees"" I\'m sure he can handle it.', 'Fred: both our drivers will be busy being pissed off with their race engineers and won’t have the time to be pissed off with each other.', ""We'll see how that goes if they end up fighting each other for the WDC"", 'I have relatively positive hopes with the driver management. It is honestly their respective fanbases I am kinda worried about 😅', 'Fred is feeling confident. And I love it', 'Narrator - *He should be worried*', 'Famous last words…', 'I’m kinda just expecting Charles to be the clear number one.

But what he says about Sauber completely losing sight of the present definitely tracks. They made big leaps in the final fifth of the year:\n\n>""When I joined in August, really, it was like a team that was almost frozen,"" added Binotto. ""So while making sure that we had the proper plans in our journey to become a top team in the future, we really needed to boost the team for improvement and possibly already during the current season.\n\n>""How important the current season was was not only about not finishing with zero points, because finishing 10th with zero or 10th with four points does not change much.\n\n>""But it was more for us to make sure that we have defined the proper direction of development for next season as well – and being energised through the wintertime.\n\nI agree that you have to keep the tension to improve every season because otherwise when ""your year"" comes you won\'t have the right processes to compete.

Makes his podium all the less likely. Although Binotto is making sure there are already improvements this season and the next. I mean that Sauber in the last 3-4 races was reasonably fast and got them their first few points.

I disagree that Liam was on paper a better choice and think that once again the second driver will be no higher than 5th while tearing up race cars, but I’d rather not have yuki lose stock value due to a poor season in the Red Bull. Yuki’s time will come, someone is definitely watching him and I can see him in the top 3 teams within the next 3 or so years.', 'No. I didn’t know about the quote in the other reply but Massa’s own version of events is basically exactly how I see it.\n\nMassa for me always had severe limitations. On a regular race weekend he could compete well but when the car wasn’t great and he wasn’t running out front, he just didn’t seem to have the consistency or racecraft of a top driver and he made too many errors. \n\nThere were really only four or five races where Massa could keep up with Schumacher in 2006, and that’s not far off what we saw with Alonso in 2010. He scored 57.1% of Alonso’s points that year compared to 66.1% vs Schumi. I would argue that isn’t due to Massa being weaker in 2010, but more the competition was much stronger. There were three top-tier cars in 2010 compared to two in 2006 and that one of those 2006 cars had a woeful Fisichella in it. An average day for Massa simply left him with a worse result - including relative to his team-mate - in 2010.\n\nThe next few years Massa dipped to 45.9%, 43.8% and 46.2% of Alonso’s points. However, between the 2012 summer break and Spain 2013, we saw a significant upturn in form that saw him score 66.3% of Alonso’s points - almost the exact same as he scored vs Schumacher in 2006, demonstrating that previous level was still within him. During that stretch he scored all three of his post-2010 Ferrari podiums and had some other excellent battling drives from positions of adversity like in Singapore. He also did it during a stretch where Alonso was quite clearly at the top of his game, so Massa was almost certainly the variable here. \n\nI think what really affected Massa from the start of 2011 until that late 2012-early 2013 spell was that Ferrari were much less competitive than in 2010, then in Monaco 2013 he had two heavy crashes and it felt like that dented his confidence, because he dipped again after that.\n\nPeople will say ‘Surely he improved in 2007 and 2008 and then declined?’. I would agree 2007 was his best year, he made fewer mistakes than in other prime years except the first half of 2009. In 2008 he was very erratic and was made to look good by Raikkonen making several errors of his own in addition to the team’s development path working against him.', ""There's a Beyond The Grid episode with his race engineer who said that his speed was unaffected.

I can't personally think of another instance of it (but I may well be missing one).

Seb took Toro Rosso's first ever race win at Monza in 2008. He then went on to take Red Bull's first ever race win at Shanghai in 2009.

If you're team head deciding what you're looking to do driver wise for entrance into the sport what would you choose.

You have to assume your at best hoping for a mid pack season ending, chances of being a top 3 team are slim.

So do you go with hiring experienced drivers hoping to get points that way or do you hire young drivers and hope to build the team with those drivers and any points are a reason to celebrate for the first 2 seasons.","['Well traditional wisdom in these circumstances is to go with both, one experienced veteran (preferably with experience in a front-running team) and a young talent alongside him who you can (hopefully) build the team around as you both rise up the grid.', 'Definitely Bottas/Perez with a young American driver, most likely Herta.', 'One experience driver + an Indycar driver for marketing purposes.\n\nBottas/Perez/Tsunoda + Herta', 'Perez/Bottas and Herta (and if Herta doesn’t get his SL for 2026 maybe Colapinto).', 'Herta and Checo.  \nCheco is good in a mid car.', '1 of each.', 'I would take 2 experienced drivers like Bottas and Hulk, sign them both for 2 years with a hope that they will not spend budget on crashes + invest in Junior program, bring talented American drivers to European feeder series, starting from karting.', ""The prudent thing would be to go with experienced drivers to maximise car development.

If you remember his debut in Zandvoort after Daniel broke his fingers, he was racing against Max on his out lap.\n\n>""He\'s got that kind of gritty racer mentality. He did a year in the DTM where he adjusted to driving a Ferrari GT car incredibly quickly alongside Alex Albon and generally had the upper hand.
