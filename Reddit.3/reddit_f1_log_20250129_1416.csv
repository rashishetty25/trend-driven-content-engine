Specialists say that it will be necessary to take risks but only if you can control the negative effects , in this aspect even Red Bull has slipped. Twenty-four races in ten months are too many to have an all-purpose car while the gaps remain minimal. McLaren has made it clear that its attempt to evolve in 2025 requires risks , after all Red Bull had to do the same a year ago, in a way that however did not receive a totally positive opinion from Newey. Ferrari with the 677 project will have a new concept and will modify 99% of the parts , as revealed by Vasseur , and one could expect a completely different face but it is not certain that it will be like this.\n\n\nIn reality this does not mean that it will be aesthetically different at 99% , rather that some fundamentals, such as the floor and the cockpit, must have been revised. We should expect a more extreme 677 in the most visible areas and modified in the less visible ones. For example, the 2025 floor design was already much more advanced in November compared to the experimental one used at the end of the season . The feedback has however proven the experiment right, especially with the high downforce configuration.\n\n\nFerrari 2025: Does it make sense to change the entire front end ?\n\nThe 2025 world championship from a sporting point of view is a good opportunity for those who start off on the right foot, however redesigning the mechanical platform may require a process of understanding to unlock that potential seen in the tunnel. The front suspension of these cars combined with the wing completely changes the approach and conditioning of the flows around the bodywork . It is a job that has an impact perhaps more than in the past because the end-of-generation single-seaters are reaching an extreme level of sensitivity. Aerodynamicists must play on a razor\'s edge.\n\n\nSwitching to pull rod geometry has important aerodynamic effects, allowing opportunities that have already been successfully tested . It could be a coincidence but the championships have only been won by Red Bull and McLaren, projects that have developed that solution since the beginning of these regulations. In the technical era led by Cardile, the F1-75 had been one step away from homologating it, only to then confirm itself as more conservative . A choice officially defended by the technicians, but which has somewhat indirectly slowed down the design of the front axle in which it was more difficult to find significant gains compared to the others.\n\n\nAfter the total change of aerodynamic concept, the new Ferrari was 95% different from the 2023 car. This difference, as Vasseur revealed at Christmas lunch, will be even more powerful today. Also thanks to the package introduced in Imola, in the first part of the season the SF-24 was a good car , consistent because it was gentle on the tires, however the failure in Barcelona certified that the mechanics, especially the front one, were no longer adequate to push the overall aerodynamic platform forward.\n\n\nThe 2025 project has a significant development advantage over itself compared to last winter.\n\n\nDespite the overly prescriptive regulation and the cost cap, aerodynamics have been more important than ever . It is no coincidence that more technical responsibility has passed to those who can free their ideas. Prodromou, after the exit of James Key, had a more direct impact on the decisions to be made, while Marshall was entering the race. Similarly, Ferrari\'s aerodynamics chief, Diego Tondi, took more power after the exit of Cardile , assuming the responsibility of quickly changing pace, it is no coincidence that one of the first decisions was to put the inverted tie rod suspension in the tunnel . After an equal comparison, the sessions were able to confirm the progress with different geometry. At that point, it was possible to work differently on the look. The sidepods should have been moved back and tapered, the slides towards the diffuser redesigned in a ""more aggressive"" way . Traction was not a strong weapon of the SF-24 as temperatures varied, overall it did not satisfy the technicians and we will move towards a new rear suspension, which we will return to . From the range of wings available, we will try to obtain specifications that produce greater efficiency.\n\n\nAt least for the start of the season, there will be no major restrictions in terms of wing flexibility , which is not a surprise otherwise Maranello would not have introduced a new front wing specification at the end of the season , which will be further updated following the development thread started in Austin. How fast will the 2025 Ferrari go? It will depend on the level of competition, but the aim is to advance 1 tenth per month (limiting misfires) beyond the expected gain from one model to the other . If the track confirms the data, the engineers estimate that the misstep of Barcelona (which froze the progress of 2 months) should be erased in terms of the gap to the best competition.', ""Up next:\n\n>Sauber 2025:\xa0Here's Why It Makes Sense to Change the Entire Car"", 'Interesting to read that the F1-75 was going to have pull-rod at the front before eventually going to push-rod. Cardille was said to be conservative and said that suspension layout was overrated last year. James Key at Sauber said that the layout was free lap time.\n\nVasseur didn’t exactly put up much of a fight to keep Cardille.', 'The front fell off.\n\nGot it.', 'Because Hamilton just crushed it?', '“So it doesn’t fall off”', 'Because the front end of the SF-24 is ugly.', 'This is really interesting. \n\nThanks for posting it.', ""And the drivers!

He clearly cares more about balance in his life, and achieving a wide range of goals, than simply trying to be in the best car to chase titles. \n\nBut to happen this way? Man, I don't know what deal with the devil monkey paw shit Fernando did to get those first two titles, but I bet he didn't think it'd still haunting him 20 years later. Or 10 years later he'd again be at the mercy of an untested F1 engine. \n\nBecause, if we take Newey at face value and the 2026 pecking order will be dictated by engines rather than car design, that's a lot of faith in a Ford/RBPT unit that I haven't even heard dynamo chatter about yet.""]",49,199,0.58,49,1851,1851,19,10,0.029999999999999916,19

It might seem like the car is losing grip/skipping, but the engine also obviously 'bounces' in the revs, almost like the gear is too low for a bit and the engine is trying to pull the car into the 'sweet spot' of acceleration (I say this because something similar would happen when I race ICE karts, at lower speeds I get a similar stutter as the engine is trying to accelerate, but because of the uni-gear it just doesn't have the torque; what I do in such cases is that I try to maintain engine speed through the bend by pumping the revs, but I can't image an F1 car experiencing a similar problem)."", ""If I remember correctly, this was one of the car's first runs after its complete rebuild, during which the engine was swapped for a Cosworth one. Either a throttle setting or the TCS wasn't configured correctly so that caused the skipping. It was quickly fixed for the later session""]",28,3,0.82,28,3,3,5,2,0.029999999999999916,5

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).
