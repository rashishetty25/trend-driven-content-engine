* **Nico Rosberg (2016, Suzuka)** – He secured the title four races later, in Abu Dhabi.
* **Jacques Villeneuve (1997, Luxembourg)** – He won the title two races later, in Jerez.
* **Jody Scheckter (1979, Italy)** – He won the championship in that race.
* **Mario Andretti (1978 Zandvoort)** (thanks to u/TheRoboteer!) - The title was assigned one race later in Monza
* **Jochen Rindt (1970, Germany)** – The title was mathematically sealed at the penultimate race (USA).
* **Phil Hill (1961, Italy)** – He won the championship in that race, with the title being mathematically sealed due to the death of Von Trips, who then was just one point behind him.
* **Mike Hawthorn (1958, France)** – The title was mathematically sealed at the final race (Morocco).

1j14ga0,Insights behind the “Steer Sweep” technique,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j14ga0/insights_behind_the_steer_sweep_technique/,2025-03-01, Featured,"So earlier today u/Shezoplay1 noted that Lando was doing a “steering sweep” during his running at the test this week.

I was part of the team at RBR that (AFAIK) invented this technique. I have been out of F1 for a few years now and it is clearly no longer proprietary info, so I thought I would share some insights behind the technique and what it’s trying to achieve.

First off, let’s start with a primer, for context.

**What is aero mapping?**

An aero map, simply put, is a multi-dimensional model that attempts to model the aerodynamic response of the car (typically in terms of SCL and aero balance) against a set of variables. Each of these variables adds a dimension to said model.

SCL is made up of SCLf (front axle) and SCLr (rear axle). Aero balance is simply SCLf/SCL, ie the percentage of total load that is going through the front axle.

The dimensions that go into a typical model consist of things like: ride height (FRH and RRH), yaw, steer, roll. These were the well known variables, but at the same time aerodynamicists knew that these did not fully “explain” the variation of aerodynamics from one car state to another, because models trained purely on these variables did not provide great correlation. In the late 2000s, other new variables like **curvature** were starting to gain consideration in the correlation question. We’ll leave some of the others for another day.

**So what is curvature?**

Simply put, curvature is the reciprocal of corner radius, i.e. 1/r. Sharp low speed corners have high curvature, 130R has low curvature. Corners with curvature impart a curved flowfield on a car (crosswind yaw at the front, conventional yaw at the rear) and this is unqiuely different from the effects of pure yaw (all wind is coming from the same direction) and steer.

The issue with curvature is that it is very difficult to recreate in the wind tunnel (also another story for another day) due to the straight tunnel walls by definition imparting 0 curvature on the flow, and so you can only really model it in CFD. This is one of the many reasons why wind tunnel outputs have different flow physics from CFD ones, btw. However, the wind tunnel is *by far* the better of the two environments for building an aero map from, because you can have hundreds of test points to create your aero map from, for a given spec of car.

So, the result of this is that your aero map is compromised, it knows nothing about curvature. This is not great, because your aero map is your core manual for understanding your car. You feed this map into all your sims, your ride height optimisation models, etc. it is the single most important numerical output of the aero department.

**Introducing the track mapping experiment**

This is when RBR introduced the track mapping exercise. Why not build an aero map using the real car? You can measure pressures continuously on the aero sensors, so all that is needed is a track “trajectory” that covers the full range of values that each of your aero map dimensions typically cover. That should, in principle, give you enough “coverage” in your map to build a model from.

**So where does the steer sweep come in?**

Steer angle is something the wind tunnel shows very high SCL sensitivity to. The wind tunnel model allows you to independently sweep the steer angle while holding all other variables constant.

This is much harder to do on track. However, we do see a very wide range of steer angles on a track trajectory. The important thing to note is that on track, this range of steer angles is highly coupled with curvature and somewhat highly coupled with ride height. So you only get very high steer on track in conjunction with high FRH and high curvature.

This is what the sweep solves: we can now log a full range of steer angles *while holding FRH and curvature roughly constant* - this allows our model to better differentiate the aero effects created by the steer effect, from those created by curvature, ride height, etc.

1j0syme,What the team were paid in 2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0syme/what_the_team_were_paid_in_2024/,2025-03-01, Statistics,"Liberty Media released their [Q4 and 2024 EOY Earnings report](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/557/liberty-media-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year) on Thursday which included the financial results of Formula 1.

It was another record breaking year for F1 with revenue of $3.4B (\^$189M), **Adjusted EBIT of $2.07B** (\^$169M) and declared income of $492M (\^100M).

Nobody publishes these breakdowns anymore, so here is the maths sourced from Liberty media earnings calls, reputable journalists and corroborated by checking against the financial records of F1 and the teams.

The team payments pool is [calculated from adjusted EBIT based on a scale that tips more towards Liberty as the profits increase](https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/formel-1/f1-aktie-hoehenflug-liberty-media-teams-kauften-nicht/#:~:text=The%20amount%20of,just%2030%20percent).  below is the scale of how much the teams get for each band of F1 earnings

|$0-$1B|         | 75% |      |$750M|

|next $500M|  | 60%|       |$300M|

|Next $300M|  |45%|      |$135M|

|Over $1.8B|    | 30%|       |$81 (in 2024)|

This makes the total prize pool [(team payments) $1,266M](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/557/liberty-media-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year#:~:text=(-,1%2C266,-)) up from $1,215M in 2023.

From this, [Ferrari still gets the Longest Standing Team Bonus](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ferrari-set-to-keep-bonus-payment-in-new-f1-concorde-agreement-but-now-capped/10613517/) which is said to be 5% up to a prize pool of 1.1B, then increases by 1% for every $100M extra in the prize pool (6% to 1.2B etc. like tax brackets). for 2024 this is $65.6M.

Then there is a Past Performance pool, awarded to teams based on a matrix of placing in the top 3 of the WCC over the past 10 seasons and a bonus for teams that have won single or multiple WCC in the sports history. This pool is [believed to be 20% of the total pool, over $650M](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/who-wins-from-f1s-new-concorde-deal-and-how-itll-work/#:~:text=Title%2Dwinning%20teams%20and%20teams%20that%20finished%20in%20the%20top%20three%20in%20the%20past%20decade%20are%20eligible%20for%20this%20pot%2C%20which%20is%20derived%20from%20a%20percentage%20of%20F1%20revenue%20above%20a%20certain%20threshold%20%E2%80%93%20reportedly%2020%25%20of%20what%20F1%20makes%20over%20%24650m). for 2024 this is $123.2M.

This leaves a WCC pool of $1,077M to be split between the teams based on their place in the 2023 WCC. 6% for last, then equal increments for each place up to 14% for the WCC.

So that gives the following table for what each team was paid (in $M).

|Team|Prize Money|PPM|Bonus|Total|% of total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Red Bull|150.8|31.6||182.4|14.4%|
|Mercedes|141.2|47.4||188.6|14.9%|
|Ferrari|131.7|25.3|65.6|222.6|17.6%|
|Mclaren|122.1|6.3||128.4|10.1%|
|Aston Martin|112.5|||112.5|8.9%|
|Alpine|102.9|4.7||107.7|8.5%|

|VCARB|83.8|||83.8|6.6%|
|Sauber|74.2|||74.2|5.9%|
|Haas|64.6|||64.6|5.1%|

2025 will be last time this method of calculating the team payments, bonuses and payout structure from the 2021 Concorde Agreement is used. Hopefully, the 2026 agreement will take another step towards balancing the distribution of prize money and not make the same mistakes of 2013.","[""I don't get it, how is Mercedes getting more in prize money than McLaren for example with a lower WCC and WDC position and fewer wins and podiums?

I think the best part was definitely the car designs, the were absolutely phenomenal. Great job on the design team for that one. The acting was quite good to, especially from Senna, Prost, and Lauda.

The race scenes were pretty decent. Most were nothing special, just your average high adrenaline camera shaking scene, but there were a couple of outliers, like 1984 Monaco, 1989 Japan, and 1994 Imola.

I think one thing they could've don't better was the Senna-Prost rivalry scenes. I know this is Senna's show, so obviously it's going to be more focused towards him, but I feel like it portrayed Prost as this big annoying villain when I'm sure in real life Senna was probably just as annoying too.

1j0k5e9,Flexi Rear Wings - Was it legal when it happened last year? what changed in the regs this year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0k5e9/flexi_rear_wings_was_it_legal_when_it_happened/,2025-02-28, Discussion,"There seems to still be a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding regarding the infamous ""Baku Wing"" on the McLaren last year.

People keep throwing around phrases like ""the wing was illegal"" or ""it was illegal because the regs say the DRS has to stay closed"" 

The technical regulations in F1 are complicated and worded very specifically. I've formatted the specific regulations pertaining to changes made this year to make it much more difficult to achieve a ""Baku Wing"" effect. Simply the ""Baku Wing"" was legal. The FIA said it was legal, they just didn't appreciate it, said they would ban it and McLaren pulled it back because it was clearly going to become a problem if they continued to use it long term. 

(See strikethru bold vs. bold, Changes approved by WMSC on 11/12/24)

**3.10.1 Rear Wing Profiles** 

* Bodywork declared as “Rear Wing Profiles” must: 
   * a. Lie within RV-RW-PROFILES. 
   * b. In any Y plane: 
      * i. Contain exactly two sections. 
      * ii. The rearmost section, which will be known as the “RW Flap”, must have a chord smaller than the chord of the adjacent section. 
      * iii. With the exception of minimal modifications to permit attachment of the actuator system described in 3.10.10 to the RW Flap, the sections may not contain any concave radius of curvature smaller than 100mm 
      * **~~iv. The distance between the two sections must lie between 10mm and 15mm at their closest position.~~** 
   * **Furthermore:** 
      * **c. At all points along the span, the rear wing profiles (as defined under Article 3.10.1) must have a minimum gap of between 9.4mm and 13mm. This will apply when the DRS is not in the state of deployment (as defined under Article 3.10.10) and will be measured with a spherical gauge.** 
      * **d. Outboard of Y100, the normal to any point of the profiles surface must not subtend an angle greater than 20° to a Y plane.** 
      * **e. Once the RW Flap is fully defined, a Gurney of up to 20mm may be fitted to the trailing edge. This Gurney is considered to be part of the Rear Wing Profiles and must satisfy the provisions of this Article with the exception of sections b (iii) and (c)(d).**

**3.15.15 Rear Wing Slot Gap Deflection**

* **With the hydraulic system active and the DRS deployed, a spherical gauge must not pass through the gap between the two elements within RV-RW-Profiles. The gauge will have a diameter of 85mm +0.00 / -0.05mm and a load of** **~~10N~~** **30N will be applied during the test.**

  
In simple terms: 

The language defining how the rear wing elements are allowed to move along planes angularly has been specified, as it was not before (310.1,b,iv being struck out and re-thought)

The test load of the Slot Gap Deflection has been tripled to more easily flesh out any kind of manipulation that could occur and be explained away as accidental or conditional. 

  
Thanks for reading ","['There is a fundamental tension at the heart of the regulations between the strict rule and ensuring the rules are being complied with.\n\n3.2.2 is pretty clear about rigid secure and immobile components/bodywork.\n\nHowever everyone is well aware that this in a strict sense simply isn’t possible. So there is some tolerance introduced during the tests for these rules such as in 3.10.1. And that tolerance is what tends to lead to arguments. The rules do say that bodywork can’t flex, but also essentially says it can as long as it is not too much. \n\nBut since the tests aren’t perfect, there is sometimes gaps where there isn’t a test which actually checks the rules in a specific way. If there isn’t a specific test then it becomes unclear if it is legal or illegal since there is no specific defined tolerance, but complete rigidity isn’t possible.', 'IIRC the ban on flexy wings is in the ""no moveable aero"" part.

They are not released to the public.', ""Like you said, 3.2.2 is clarified by the further, more specific articles which do permit deflection and flex. \n\nIf the articles permit deflection, deflection will occur. \nThe articles have been tightened up like I detailed in my post. However deflection is still permitted to some degree. So everyone seeing deflection occur during testing should put their pitchforks down and wait. It's extremely unlikely these 2025 rear wings are being tested for the entire weekend while not being already cleared by the FIA."", 'I don\'t believe the rear wing is specifically controlled in that section, at all. Can you show me?\n\nAll ""movement"" of elements of the car are either defined or not defined as relative movement or deflection.\n\nAll the tolerances for movement, deflection, flex etc are defined where felt necessary and none of those tolerances are 0. \n\nThere is no open-endedness that results in a ""ban"" currently.

1j0vg9x,What caused Mercedes to have a bulge next to the car number and above the suspension?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0vg9x/what_caused_mercedes_to_have_a_bulge_next_to_the/,2025-03-01, Discussion,"I don't know much about the technology. Judging from the size of the damper and other elements, this bulge doesn't seem to be necessary. 

My guess is that if there is no bulge, the anti-roll bar of the car will rotate when the car turns, causing its rocker arm to contact the suspension cover. 

It seems that Mercedes started to replace a larger anti-roll bar rocker arm at the Austrian Grand Prix last year? How does this upgrade work? It seems that Mercedes kept the bulge design because it don't want to increase the height of the suspension elements?
