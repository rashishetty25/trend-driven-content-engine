1jx49gq,"With the C6 compound debuting at Imola, should Pirelli revisit the 2018 tire naming and color convention?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jx49gq/with_the_c6_compound_debuting_at_imola_should/,2025-04-11, Discussion,"The C6 compound is making its race weekend debut at the 2025 Emilia-Romagna GP, marking the first time we’ve seen all six dry compounds actually used in a single season. This has me wondering—should Pirelli bring back the 2018-style naming and color convention to improve clarity?

Back in 2018, each compound had its own name and color (e.g., Hypersoft, Ultrasoft, Supersoft...), which made it easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps. Since 2019, Pirelli has simplified this into just “Soft,” “Medium,” and “Hard” regardless of which actual compound is selected, but that’s led to some confusion—especially when C2 is called “Soft” one weekend and C5 gets the same label another.

So with six compounds now in regular use, and possibly staying that way into 2026 and beyond, is it time to revisit or modernize the naming system? Maybe bring back unique names and colors—or at least tweak the current system to reduce ambiguity?

Curious to hear what others think—would reintroducing distinct compound names make things clearer, or is the current format better for casual fans?","[""I liked the rainbow, but I understand why some people didn't. Always sounded cooler when they called it the hypersoft."", 'I liked the pirelli rainbow more than what we have now. but i understand the ease of understanding just Soft - Medium - Hard and using C1-C6 for the more hardcore technical fanbase. \n\nFor someone who has no clue about the details behind the tires. Knowing that Soft goes fast but not far, Hard goes far but less fast. And medium goes in between. Is simple. Instead of having to remember one week, why they are driving on Ultrasoft, supersoft and soft tires. And the next week all of a sudden superhard, hard and medium tires.   \nHaving the same colour scheme across every week also helps distinguishing between what the soft medium or hards are. Instead having to remember this week we have orange which is the hardest, blue which is the medium, and white which is the softest. just for it to be a week later be blue for the hardest, and another race having white as the hardest tire. \n\nAnd using C1-C6 just removes any confusion between it.', "">easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps.\n\nIf everyone's tires are the same 3 compounds in a race, does it really matter? Having a different compound be called soft on different tracks doesn't really seem to make much of a difference since you can't compare across tracks directly anyways"", 'No, because it\'s terrible for viewing. Right now when you are watching a race, and you see someone pitting and putting on the ""Soft"" tyre, you know that they have put on the softest available tyre and you know they are going for a short and quick stint.\n\n\nBut with the old naming system, where ""Super Soft"" wasn\'t even the softest tyre at some tracks, you would basically have to memorise which specific tyres are available for that weekend and so if someone puts on the ""Super Soft"" when the ""Hyper Soft"" is available, it is confusing. It makes the racing much harder to follow.\n\n\nHaving the softest available for that race be the Soft, Medium, and Hard, makes the racing so much easier to follow.', ""No, the current format is better in pretty much every way. There's no loss of information, the most relevant information to the vast majority of fans is clearly visible, yet the detail of which compounds are being used is readily available.\n\nThe old system just had unnecessary confusion"", 'The Pirelli rainbow range (or whatever you want to call it) was fine for the more hardcore audience who new what compounds were being brought each weekend, but I imagine it was confusing as hell if you didn’t know what they had - one weekend one colour might have been the softest but the next it was the hardest.

I don\'t get it. The current naming and colouring scheme is objectively easier to understand and identify easily.

Just to see what it was like. I wonder if he could set it up like he does the Red Bull. If he could I genuinely think he’d be faster.\xa0\n\nIn Australia Yuki qualified one tenth off of Max. However many would say Max is expected to be more than one tenth quicker than Yuki so was that made up time the Racing Bulls faster car?\xa0\nIn qualifying in China Hadjar was two tenths off Max. Most people would say that in an equal car Max would be a lot more than two tenths ahead of Hadjar.\xa0\nAlso last season, for the six races Yuki and Liam were team mates Yuki was better but it was close. This year there is a chasm between them.\xa0\n\nOn top of that the general consensus Ive seen on here is that Lawson would probably perform better in the Racing Bulls car, but yet they still say Red Bull is faster.\xa0\n\nThis is because of the way the car is set up for Max’s driving style.\xa0\n\nI do feel this is a little misunderstood by fans because as far as I have gathered from what Albon said on the high performance podcast “the car is what it is.” It’s the set up that Max changes. The other driver can try and choose a different less fronty set up but they will be nowhere near Max. So they have to try a similar set up to Max if they want to be close to him. But this leads to crashes and no confidence in the car.\xa0\n\nSo take a fast driver that is not Max. Let’s\xa0\xa0say Leclerc. Put Leclerc in the Red Bull and then the Racing Bull, which does he perform better in? I actually think it would be the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nI think the only argument that Red Bull is that Max couldn’t set up another car like he sets up the Red Bull.\xa0\xa0Of course it is hard to figure out weather this is true or not as Max has spent practically his whole career in Red Bull. Personally I think that Max’s set up is a factor but perhaps not to the same degree that some people argue.\xa0\nI also think for example that Verstappen would have likely put more than two tenths on Hadjar in China qualifying if both were in Racing Bulls. Thus Max would have set a faster time in the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nThere is also the argument to consider that Verstappen could also make set up changes to suit him on the Racing Bull which would make it faster for him. \xa0\nSo overall I would say that in qualifying pace Max would set faster times were he in the Racing Bull. Race pace is harder to say because there is usually a bigger gap between Max and the Racing Bulls. In fact race pace has been Red Bull’s big strength since the new ground effect era began in 2022, although even this could be exacerbated by the fact that over Perez’s whole career he was always better in races than qualifying.\xa0\n\nEither way it would be so interesting to see Max go into that Racing Bulls (obviously extremely extremely unlikely to ever happen) and it would be very telling about the performance of the two cars and Max himself’s talents (Were he to jump into the Racing Bull and put a huge gap on Liam and Hadjar, people could no longer argue Max is only good because he sets up his car so his team mate can’t drive it.\xa0', ""It appears we've entered the McLaren domination era... at least until Spain, when the new technical directive on flexible wings comes into effect."", 'How much of a mess have you got yourself into if the Green Saubers are faster than your own green team?']",113,43,0.94,113,316,316,3,0,0.0,3

Aston Martin like McLaren had money issues for a bit, but still McLaren they somehow did the unthinkable and became a top team.

Alpine are just terrible, so are haas and Williams.

It was only a few years ago where McLaren was a tractor at Bahrain.  **Who made McLaren a top team?**","['New Wind Tunnel + Going back to Mercedes engines + Poaching key staff from Red Bull + Zak Brown and Andrea Stella are actually good at their jobs, no matter what people say about them.', 'They switched from Renaults engine to Mercedes, which automatically improved them.\n\nThey hired good people.\n\nTheir wind tunnel and simulator seem to correlate very well with real life.\n\nEasier said than done.', ""McLaren had a pretty healthy upwards trajectory, with some important hires from other teams. \n\nIt's not really fair to look at 1 or 2 races at the start of the season to compare performance. McLaren had a bad car at Bahrein in both '22 and '23, but in '22 they still had a good car (best of the rest), and in '23 they started slow but then were racking up podiums and showed glimpses of (what could become) a race winning car at the end of the season."", 'Williams is improving.', ""getting rid of James Key did wonders for them. Look what Key's doing to the Sauber"", 'McLaren were always a top team, they were just underperforming. Especially during the McHonda years, they ticked every box that made a team a top team - except for results. Credit to Zak Brown for turning a sinking ship around. If they bring home both titles this year then he has done everything right', 'It’s still McLaren. They had resources, they had backing, they had a driver everyone wanted to nab from them. They had everything to make them a top team again. They avoided the pitfalls of Williams (and to some extent Ferrari) when they restructured the whole organisation and didn’t allow themselves to be left behind. McLaren had decent infrastructure to be a midfield team but not enough to be a top team again. So they invested in that side a lot. \n\nSeidl said in 2022 that McLaren lacked knowledge, there were gaps in their team that they needed to address. \n\nZak Brown said when he met Seidl his first demand was he wanted the Mercedes engine and he wanted a new wind tunnel. Brown just did whatever the Team Principal wanted, it was his job to go and get the backing and approval from the board to make it happen.  \n\nI guess that structure of just letting the TP get on with running the team instead of worrying what’s going on above him, works really well for McLaren.\n\nI also think some credit has to go to the drivers. If they didn’t have such a demanding one, I think they might have been content with being clear leaders of the upper midfield and the odd podium here and there. That kind of ‘pushy’ non-complacent attitude didn’t let the team rest.', ""IMO Zak Brown doesn't get the recognition he deserves.  \nWhen he took over at McLaren that car was a blank canvas in terms of sponsors. 2 year later and you didn't know where to fit another company logo. Money issues solved.\n\nThey went on to bring on talents and build a team for the long term.  \nCompared to Ferrari that fires every Team Principle that doesn't deliver in 6 months. Or compared to Red Bull and Mercedes who just poach from each other and have a betting game of who can pay more, McLaren brings on long lasting Team members.\n\nThey are now just the boring, stable team. Many people think they don't deserve to be there at the top, but what we see now is the work of the previous 7 years that they continued building that team and solved problems together rather than firing people who struggled."", 'It\'s rarely 1 person that suddenly makes a car perform well.\n\nIt\'s possible multiple unknown names managed to figure out how to extract performance out of the car in their specific area.\n\nWhile usually it\'s a few key people that figure out the actual aerodynamic performance. It\'s not that simple, the amount of people working on the car is way higher than we usually imagine.\n\nThe performance is a harmony.\n\nThey had a few big hiring the past few years, but I don\'t think anyone really made a big impact yet. It\'s possible for sure, but I don\'t think it\'s possible from the very limited amount of knowledge I have in designing a ""product"". In a totally different field. \n\nTo answer your question, it\'s impossible to ever find out the actual exact answer since only a select few people actually know enough data to be able to really answer this.
