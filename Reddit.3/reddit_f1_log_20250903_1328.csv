1n7bz5t,From 2026’s 50% split V6 Hybrid to a 2030 V8 Hybrid? What Are We Doing…,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n7bz5t/from_2026s_50_split_v6_hybrid_to_a_2030_v8_hybrid/,2025-09-03, News,"So, the FIA hasn’t even rolled out the 2026 engine regs yet and according to the credible sources at AmUs they’re already talking about the next formula. If this is true, it’s a mess. Four years of one set of rules, then we rip it up again.  


The new proposal for ~2030 (per AMuS):  
- 2.4L naturally aspirated V8 (like 2006–2013)  
- Hybrid component delivering 220–240kW (midway between current 120kW and 2026’s 350kW)  
- CO₂-neutral fuel with pre-chamber ignition for efficiency  
- Turbo gone (at least sound might improve) but fuel limits will still mute it  
- FIA pushing for 2029 start; RB Powertrains & Cadillac on board  
- Audi & Honda resisting as they want their 2026 investments to last the promised 5 years  
- Ferrari open to earlier switch if FIA gives clear direction  
- Cost-cutting goal: engines simpler, cheaper, leasing to customer teams for ~€10M (down from €17–20M)  
- But switching to V8 means all manufacturers redesign the blocks so it's only worth it if regs are locked for ~10 years  

This is frustrating is it too much to ask for a simpler formula focused on the raceabiliy ? 
the 2026 regs already feel like a marketing exercise 

- ~50/50 power split between ICE (~500hp) and electric (~350kW) with constant tweaking per circuit to accommodate risks of sudden electric clipping
- Gimmick ""axis"" modes from movable aero and electric boost with conditional deployment that will give casters a headache to comment.


And now we’re talking about binning them early for another formula, which means more costs, more churn, and less stability.  


If the FIA wanted to showcase sustainability, they could’ve just promoted the insane thermal efficiency of the current engines instead of forcing a 50/50 split that creates regen limits, de-rating, and aero headaches.  
As a fan I want great racing, not constant technical resets to bait manufacturers ready to flee as soon as they don't have it their way.","[""As frustrating as it may sound, it's pointless to fight against technology and, differently from many sports, F1 is very costly and requires large companies, specially automakers, to back it.\n\nHaving a high-rev NA engine, to eliminate lag/traction issues + electrification sounds already better than 2026. On top of that, batteries may improve in capacity until then."", ""I have a better question. Would it be SMARTER if they just extend this engineer regulation till 2030? Because switching from the current reg, to the upcoming regs to then CHANGE it again in 4 years. Since the current regs lasted ELEVEN YEARS...and I don't think any manufacturer would agree to switching to new regs so soon."", 'I would love to see the new regs limit the overall size of these monsters. Sorry to sound like Grandpa, onion on the belt and all, but back in the day cars were small enough to pass on nearly every circuit. \n\nExcept Monaco, of course. That was always just a showcase for the elite and their yacht side viewing parties.', 'Will they be able to roll coal for the us market?', ""I disagree that the active aero is gimmicky because engineers would throw that on the cars already if they could as it gives the best aero performance. So that I dont care too much about.\n\nBut yeah the engine side is a bit of a mess and a lot of that is just because they want the manufacturers involved, so they catered it around everyone's needs. Doing that has meant they also handicapped themselves on the regen side, so its a bit of mess making that work when it probably didnt need to be."", '""Haha v8 goes vroom who cares"" are really starting to annoy me. People would rather watch races without overtaking if the engine sounds better.

Things like DRS where you can only use them if you meet arbitrary parameters and only in certain places would be a gimmick. As long as they don’t do that with the moveable aero these regs stand a chance of at least being pure racing.', 'It seems the FIA, in its desire to bring the VW Group on board, accepted the 50-50 split to please Audi and guarantee their involvement in Formula 1. These new rules also enticed Honda, which had been set to retire from the sport but instead switched teams to remain. Many teams were unhappy with the new regulations, Adrian Newey, and Ferrari being especially vocal in opposition, but in the end, the FIA got its way and every team accepted the new rule book.\nNow that everyone has been able to run simulations and refine some of the processes, teams have realized that the new rules are not as straightforward as initially thought. At least 2026 and 2027 are expected to bring huge headaches as most teams work to sort them out. When the FIA began receiving data from the teams, it considered reverting to V8 engines by 2028, but smaller teams argued it was too soon given the escalating development costs. Thus, the new target became 2030.', 'I say let them build whatever engine they like, just limit the total fuel in the race.', 'What is frustrating about this? They obviously think the 2026 regs don’t have any legs and are planning ahead. How does this affect you from the couch? Let the teams worry about it, it’s them that come to decision and them that spend the money on it. \n\nV6 can die in a fire for all I care.
