We never got anything concrete but they went from gapping the field in Quali and the race to not doing so.\xa0\n\nYes McLaren brought upgrades but Ferrari did not, so why were Ferrari so close to pole in the sprint and the race? And why was Leclerc able to stay within a few seconds off Max for the whole sprint? And Max wasnt pulling his usual gaps in the race even before he hit the cone.\xa0\n\nNow the internal power struggle, it is almost certain that stuff went down here. Who leaked the WhatsApp messages? It had to be someone very involved to have access to them, possibly someone involved with the woman at the heart of it. There were rumours that she got on with Jos Verstappen who was seen having a shouting match with Horner during the Saudi weekend.\xa0\n\nAnd then the drivers, I have a little F1 conspiracy that Daniel Ricciardo was told that he was promoted to a Red Bull driver after the Belgian Grand Prix.\xa0\n\nWhy do I think this? Going into the race it was heavily rumoured that Perez was out, but he did finally have a good qulaifying in Belgium, the last race before the summer break.\xa0\n\nGoing into the race Perez was 7th in the championship and Russell a few points behind in 8th. This is importnat.\xa0\n\nOn the grid it was reported by credible content creator LawVS (he has no reason to lie and it would be out of character) that he had a source on the ground that said right before the race while the cars were being prepped before the formation lap, Helmut Marko strode away from Verstappen’s penalised Red Bull to the car directly behind, Daniel Ricciardo’s. He said something in Ricciardo and they nodded and Daniel got in the car.\xa0\n\nIn the race Perez had an awful time, dropping from 2nd down to 8th while George Russell had an amazing run to victory!\xa0\n\nThis demoted Perez to 8th place in the championship standings, perhaps invoking a contract clause…\xa0\n\nIn the post race interviews Ricciardo looked chirpy, very happy for a man who’d just had a normal race to 11th.\xa0\n\nThen the teams went back to their garages and the drivers left the venue with Verstappen and Ricciardo reported to have left the circuit together and helicoptering away from Spa together, under the assumption that they were team mates again….\xa0\n\nBut then George Russell’s car was found to be overweight, and then, he was disqualified from the race. This promoted Perez back to 7th in the standings amd meant the contract clause did not invoke!\xa0\n\nAnd so thus Perez kept his Red Bull seat and Ricciardo showed up in VCARB gear in Zandvoort seeming a bit perplexed. Perez then had strong form post summer break while Russell had a couple of unlucky races, so Perez stayed 7th for the time being.\n\nBut there was now another factor in play, Liam Lawson.\xa0\n\nOn the 22nd September 2023 a contract had been signed saying that Tsunoda and Ricciardo would race for Alpha Tauri/VCARB in 2024. On that day it was confirmed that Liam Lawson would not be a full time racer for 2024 following his impressive stand in for Ricciardo in 2023 when Daniel broke his hand and was injured by that.\xa0\n\nHorner/Marko HEAVILY suggested that Lawson would have a race seat at some point. But locking him down for 2025 during 2023 made little sense. So perhaps the contract stated that in one year from now, you will be in Formula 1 while it said in Ricciardo’s amd Tsunoda’s contract that if they was not ahead of their team mate in the standings by this day 2024 they would be the ones to be replaced. This way they could use the last races of 2024 to judge him. Perhaps this explains why Tsunoda was so incensed by the team orders as early as the first race.\xa0\n\nOf course if Perez been replaced at the summer break all of them could have survived but that ship had sailed.\n\nAnd going into the Singapore Grand Prix which coincidentally fell on the 22nd September 2024, exactly one year after the original Lawson contract was signed Ricciardo was on 12 points and Tsunoda on 22.\xa0\n\nThis is why it wasn’t publicly announced that it was Ricciardo’s last race. There was a tiny chance that if he pulled a P4 or a P5 he would stay. But alas he did not, and the honey badger bowed out of F1, and left the paddock as a driver for the last time, replaced by Liam Lawson and the rest is history.\xa0\n\nYes Perez dropped to 8th in the standings but of course they wouldnt replace him in the run up to the Mexican GP and there was no natural break like the summer break had been.\xa0\n\nThats probably all wrong though.', 'Am I reading this wrong, didn’t Max win Brazil 2024?

They'll then decide when to introduce this component."", ""Well, if it makes for a stable platform for 2026, I'm all for it."", 'niceee make sense , one of the most beautiful track along with imola, Austria..', ""That's a lot of development they are still doing for this year"", 'ChatGPT translation:\n\nIn Austria, Ferrari received official feedback on the first set of corrections for the SF‑25, which has been struggling with its aero‑mechanical platform. The development package—including a new floor designed to widen the set‑up window—proved successful, with the car responding well and emerging as the second‑strongest force, while Mercedes and Red\u202fBull fell further back. “It was important to see on track what we had studied in the Maranello wind tunnel,” Jerome\u202fD’Ambrosio confirmed, referring to what he called an “auxiliary” upgrade for the SF‑25—though it is more accurately a precursor to later evolutionary steps, among them the introduction of an updated rear suspension. “We shall see,” Jerome concluded, hinting at the forthcoming mechanical changes. In any case, Ferrari’s technical department already has a plan for fitting the new parts.\n\nJuly is likely to bring the team’s second filming day of the year, a savvy move that will allow them to test the revised rear suspension: 200\u202fkm of running to evaluate five months of work.\n\nThe true structural issue around which Ferrari has re‑oriented the SF‑25 project is the rear suspension, whose new configuration has been in development since the start of the season. Loïc\xa0Serra’s decision to devote resources to a flawed concept stems from his belief in the car’s “untapped potential”, which the new mechanical component is chiefly intended to unlock. It is no simple task and has required re‑examining several upstream design choices—never trivial when trying to straighten out a technical package. As we analyse in our dedicated YouTube video, it has demanded extensive deliberation and time, all while working within the constraints of the technical and financial regulations and persisting with a car that is nearing the end of its regulatory cycle. Validating the new suspension architecture is essential yet far from straightforward, which is why Ferrari has already scheduled a 200\u202fkm filming day at Mugello in July, running the SF‑25 fitted with the new rear hardware.\n\nThe test will call for a critical, in‑depth study of real‑world data gathered on track and will serve as a genuine validation examination of the new component. Only after this filming day will Ferrari decide definitively whether—and when—to introduce the new suspension. Choosing the other company‑owned circuit, Mugello, rather than Fiorano, is clearly strategic: the Tuscan track offers technical characteristics that more closely represent a race circuit, with high‑energy corners like the Arrabbiata 1 and 2 and altitude changes that stress the car’s platform more realistically. Such conditions will provide data that are far more useful for mechanically calibrating the new suspension layout—data that would be less meaningful at Fiorano. As team principal Frédéric Vasseur has hinted, if all goes to plan, the change should help the SF‑25 keep the rear under better control, ensuring a more stable aero‑mechanical platform and a broader operating window—one of the major weaknesses at the start of this season.\n\nThis strategy explains why Silverstone is not a suitable window for the race debut of the new rear suspension. Nor will the SF‑25 receive significant novelties in Britain; instead, the team will continue to study the new floor and aim to extract maximum potential from that package. Ferrari has chosen a measured approach to introducing the new component—particularly as, in Mercedes’s case, an updated rear suspension did not immediately yield an optimised upgrade. Moreover, being overly aggressive and relying solely on theory—if not blind faith—could do more harm than good.', ""I really don't know if it's worth it to spent so much money and time for a new suspension for max. eleven races. But who I am to judge."", 'Current suspension was supposed to be exactly that, but after the first few races they told that it didn’t work and was the major reason for their slow speed.', ""Next year's car will need a suspension too"", 'Set up for next year, the aero platform is rather similar. \n\nLooking at Mclaren and how stable their platform is, others need to develop something similar.

Max and George have gone from enemies to friendly to enemies to friendly to enemies to friendly in the last couple years. One week Max hits George in Spain, the next week he’s saying that George braking under safety car is just some confusion and they’re making small talk about their plans for the week off on the way out of the stewards’ office. In December George is calling Max a bully, in March Max is making fun of reporters asking whether their relationship is still bad, in June George is saying Max’s jokes about him needing tissues are pretty funny and smiling when Max says that he’s pretty. They have a lot of practice at fighting, and they also have a lot of practice at not fighting any more.

Toto just fast-tracked Kimi to F1 because he hopes he'll be the next Max, so what's better than actual Max + future Max? \n\nNot to mention that George and Max aren't best buddies and it's easier to pull team orders on Kimi, who's still young and who's time will come in a few years down the road. Multiple race winner George will also be much more expensive than youngling Kimi. \n\nThere's no argument to be made for keeping George if they can get Max, other than the chance that the WCC might get a bit tighter next year with Kimi at the helm instead of George, but I'm sure they're willing to take that risk if it means having a clear pecking order."", 'I feel like people who keep saying that Kimi Antonelli is the future of Mercedes and will never be dropped are forgetting the fact that it’s basically every Italian’s dream to one day drive for Ferrari.

And thanks to upgrades, it\'s getting better and better. The third part of a major package is set to arrive at Silverstone. This means McLaren is suddenly also at the top of the top speed ladder.**\n\n> McLaren isn\'t letting up. They already have a 207-point lead over Ferrari in the Constructors\' Championship. And Max Verstappen would need to win two races, with both McLaren drivers retiring, to get back within striking distance. Nevertheless, McLaren was in the middle of a three-stage technical upgrade at the Red Bull Ring.\n\n> There\'s a method to this at McLaren. Since it\'s becoming increasingly difficult to find lap times with these cars, and since the competition is increasingly struggling with the side effects of excessive development steps, McLaren prefers to take the cautious approach. The engineering department rolls out the upgrades in small portions. This way, you can quickly see whether you\'re on the right track. And if you don\'t hit the mark, the responsible part is quickly identified.\n\n> Last year, following the car\'s complete overhaul in Miami, the subsequent upgrades were split into two stages each. The first took place in Zandvoort and Monza, the second in Austin and Mexico City. The latest development phase of the MCL39 is a three-stage project: the front wing, rear wing, and front axle in Montreal; the brake vents and front wishbones, a chassis modification, and the rear axle in Spielberg. The upgrade is expected to be completed by Silverstone.\n\n> **More efficiency, more feeling.**\nIn Austria, McLaren was surprisingly open about its efforts to increase the gap to its rivals. The front wing from Montreal, along with the brake vents, chassis cosmetics, and wishbone fairings on the front axle, forms a package that makes the front of the car more aerodynamically efficient, resulting in more grip and less drag. It has been hinted that similar measures will follow at the rear.\n\n> The modifications to the front axle geometry in Montreal were solely aimed at giving the drivers a better feel for the tire\'s grip under braking. Lando Norris gratefully accepted the gift. Oscar Piastri returned to the old version. ""This isn\'t an upgrade in the true sense,"" explains team principal Andrea Stella, ""but more like a tuning tool. The drivers can decide whether they want it or not.""\n\n> **Are the rear axle and top speed related?**\nThe most interesting detail of McLaren\'s technological offensive is the rear suspension. The focus here was primarily on the kinematics, which stabilizes an already good aerodynamic platform. Neil Houldey, one of three technical directors at McLaren, explained in Spielberg that they had taken some inspiration from the competition and were following a trend set by others.\n\n> The McLaren veteran declined to go into detail. However, one can imagine that McLaren is now also using the ""lowering device"" that lowers the car\'s ride height to the desired level above a certain load, thus ensuring that downforce remains stable. ""The new suspension gives the car more stability at corner entry,"" reveals Houldey.\n\n> According to teams using such a system, another advantage is the higher top speed. Combined with the changes to the front end, this could help the McLarens on the straights. Until Montreal, the papaya-yellow cars were always ranked in the bottom third of the field in terms of top speed. In Spielberg, Norris and Piastri were suddenly ahead in all speed measurements, both in the race and in qualifying.\n\n> **Modular kit with aero options.**\nHouldey reveals another interesting consequence of the latest development steps. ""We\'ve found general performance, but now we also have a modular system of different aerodynamic options that we can combine depending on the track or the drivers\' preferences. Some things bring advantages on certain tracks, less so on others. If you choose them correctly, this leads to further time savings.""\n\n> Stella sums it all up simply: ""We\'ve succeeded in making a good car even better."" Who can beat McLaren?', 'Remember when people genuinely thought the front wing TD would nerf them? Pepperidge Farm remembers', ""At this point probably a good thing for the entertainment, if they are guaranteed to finish 1-2 every race we'll have a fight in an otherwise boring season at least"", 'Not massively surprising. The best car is normally fucking quick in a straight line because it can survive running less aero', 'The fuckers apparently fixed their one weakness, goddamn', 'I would have guessed they would focus on bringing back the high speed rear stability they’ve always had but it was a bit lacking with this car and a bit with the 2024 car. So it makes sense they’ll be attempting to bring that back with more upgrades at Silverstone. The top speed in a straight line is good now. Haven’t had a McLaren that’s quick in a straight line since 2021.', 'Remember preseason when Sky Sports were creaming themselves saying there’s a genuine 4 team battle for the championship this year?', ""I like AMuS and their technical explanations, but this article is backed up by almost no data. It would've been nice to see the results over a few races to see if maybe there is anything to it. A single race isn't enough to say if they are the fastest in top-speed.

1lqtpar,Can Mercedes loan Kimi Antonelli to Alpine?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lqtpar/can_mercedes_loan_kimi_antonelli_to_alpine/,2025-07-03, Discussion,"If Verstappen wants to go to Mercedes Toto has a bit of a problem. He has 3 drivers who are all great for different reasons. But he only has 2 seats. And all 3 of the potential line ups have negatives and positives

Max/George is negative in that the team may have a civil war, positive in that great results are virtually garunteed.

Max/Kimi is negative in that there is a high risk of Kimi going the same way as countless Max team mates and losing all confidence but positive in that IF it works you've got a good plan for the future.

George/Kimi is negative in that you are refusing one of the best drivers of all time but positive in that you maintain good vibes and stability in the team. 

The only way I can think of Merc no ending up in a scenario where they lose at least one driver is if Kimi can be loaned to another team. 

A perfect team would be Alpine. They'll have Mercedes emgines next year and have only one seat locked down for 2026. Furthermore they showed that they are willing to take loans when they accepted Colapinto frim Williams on loan. And Kimi is an even better deal. 

Of course Alpine could refuse or Kimi could refuse to stay a Mercedes owned driver. 

So what do you think? Is this feasible and what would you do? I'd be really interested to hear your opinions.
