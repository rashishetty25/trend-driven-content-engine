1gubfs3,[F1] ‘We all have an ego’ – Sainz ‘hurt’ to be overlooked by top teams as future Williams driver ‘cannot understand’ some 2025 driver choices,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gubfs3/f1_we_all_have_an_ego_sainz_hurt_to_be_overlooked/,2024-11-18, News,,"[""I know there's history with Red Bull but Horner choosing to stick with Perez when Sainz was available was certainly a choice"", 'I wonder what choice he finds the most baffling, Mercedes choosing Kimi over him or RB keeping Checo over him.', 'According to Sigmund Freud, he is absolutely correct we all have an ego.', 'I mean, let’s look at them one by one. Ferrari is letting him go, Mercedes has a solid driver in Russell and an upcoming talent in Antonelli and no matter how he turns out, Wolff will be damned before he lets the next Verstappen slip away from him again. Next, Red Bull has an unhealthy attachment to Perez (on top of the reported struggles between camp Sainz and camp Verstappen) and obviously Verstappen isn’t going anywhere as far as RBR is concerned, and finally McLaren already has a solid driver lineup. That’s all the top teams accounted for.', '> Carlos Sainz has admitted that his ego was “hurt” when it became clear he would not secure a seat with another of F1’s current front-running teams during the ‘silly season’, but the Spaniard is now at “peace” and excited to join Williams.\n\nThis is the first paragraph right below the headline used in the article which conveniently left out Sainz saying he has made peace with what has happened now. And the quotes from Sainz actually come from an interview he did with Sky Sports. \n\nShitty journalism coming straight from the official F1 site and it frankly doesn’t deserve being posted imo', ""The decisions other teams have made are fairly understandable I think, apart from maybe RB keeping Perez but he's backed by big money and Sainz is not. He's just very unlucky. But if he can really drive the wheels off that Williams he will still be getting noticed and I would hope to see him at a top team again.

I'm not sure they're capable of being fully objective about his situation or giving him the best advice.\n\nHis best shot was a one year deal at Merc, and if he didn't want that, then there wasn't really a seat available for him.

[The first historic group presentation is already set for 18 February](https://autoracer.it/it/f1-a-londra-un-grande-evento-di-lancio-della-stagione-2025/) even if it will only be the liveries and the great manoeuvres for the new set-ups of the various racing teams have already begun. Among the racing teams, **Ferrari** has [already made it clear](https://x.com/MuseiFerrari/status/1857455148869587089) that [the 2025 single-seater will be unveiled at a separate event](https://autoracer.it/it/ferrari-non-presentera-la-monoposto-2025-a-londra-non-sara-lunica/), and so will the other top teams. On the subject of the market, there are still some missing pieces in the chessboard for next season, such as the future of Colapinto and the knots at Red Bull, but 2025 can already be considered the year of revolution.\n\n**Abu Dhabi test: on track Arthur Leclerc and Antonio Fuoco, reserve driver pair 2025**\n\nBefore that, however, there will be another step after the Abu Dhabi race that will close the 2024 world championship, namely post-season testing. Very willingly, **Ferrari has given the go-ahead for Carlos Sainz** to test the Williams in Abu Dhabi after the last round of the championship. It will thus be the beginning of a new partnership with Alexander Albon, a pair that in the announcement Williams described as one of the most formidable on the grid. **Lewis Hamilton, on the other hand, will not be present with Ferrari**, being unable to leave before 31 December. A question of opportunity after a great history and very complex contractual agreements. Nevertheless, Lewis Hamilton awaits the red car, like the most beautiful Christmas present, and **Ferrari has already planned what will be his ‘entrance** ’ to Maranello (we will analyse the plan). One will also have to wait to see **Kimi Antonelli** with Mercedes, the 18-year-old Italian called to Toto Wolff's court. The wait is also growing for **Gabriel Bortoleto**, Brazilian, F3 champion and F2 leader who will debut with Sauber (Audi), as well as **Liam Lawson**, with a future still to be decided between Red Bull and Racing Bulls.\n\n**Esteban Ocon** will be at Haas as early as testing, leaving Jack Doohan free to get into the Alpine for his first kilometres as a Formula 1 driver, while waiting to find out if the positive rumours about him are true, given how well he is spoken of by those who have seen him grow in the junior categories. Everyone is also waiting to see who will win the constructors‘ championship, given that the drivers’ one is certain. **Ferrari, still in the fight, is not worried about rushing Lewis** and is meanwhile thinking about what set-up to give the team in the future. Antonio Giovinazzi is currently confirmed as a reserve driver. With him will also be **Arthur Leclerc**, who will spend more time on the track, forming a pair of reserve drivers as happened this year. It is understood that it will be the young Monegasque who will take part in FP1 in Abu Dhabi, for a special session with his brother Charles. In the rookie tests, on the other hand, which will also take place in Abu Dhabi, Arthur and Antonio Fuoco are both the main candidates to run kilometres on track. Fuoco, moreover, has recently driven the F1-75 and is the other driver who remains in the Cavallino's F1 orbit as a specialist in the Maranello simulator.\n\n**Ollie Bearman**, formerly a Haas driver, running three races this year, one with Ferrari and two with the American team, has lost his rookie status and will not be able to be employed in this role. On the other hand, there is no suggestion that Ferrari has evaluated **Gunayu Zhou** as a reserve driver. According to reports, the Chinese driver is not on the Scuderia's shortlist of names for the F1 project. It is not ruled out that the Scuderia will consider a third name as a reserve driver, should non-F1 commitments prevent Arthur Leclerc and Antonio Giovinazzi from being available, with appropriate evaluations underway. After a year in which no driver has moved, we are about to experience almost a revolution, between a legend joining the legend and the many young people who will create one of the greatest generational replacements in recent years. Notwithstanding the fact that a great figure like the veteran Alonso is not giving up, on the contrary, he can't wait to finally drive a single-seater signed by Newey."", ""Let's be real here. The real reserve driver will be Ollie Bearman (Think back to Russell going to Merc for a race in 2020 when Lewis had COVID), the much bigger deal is who the Haas reserve driver is."", 'LeNepotism', ' If he was to end up being in a race what would his 3 letters be on the grid and rankings', 'I thought the Zhou news was legit and he was going to be the official reserve driver.

Rosberg went on to win that race despite having a recalcitrant car, which has often been attributed to his being able to stay cool in the extreme temperatures.\n\nIndycar also gives drivers the option of running an actively cooled driving suit at certain races, particularly on long ovals.\n\nIt'll be the first time there'll actually be specific provision for such a device in the F1 regs though.

Good to hear that they are also considering to raise the weight limit to accommodate the cooling system into the adjustments. I wonder if they will make it mandatory to wear during specific weather or anybody could wear it at any time *(given Mercedes' overheating issue, it seems like the heat comes on for them even in overall weather conditions that are not necessarily the worst in comparison, so I am trying to figure out how it works, especially for them)*\n\nThe previous idea of an AC unit in the car in of itself does seem rather tacky, but given the introduction of this cooling system, I would argue that I don't think drivers, whom are highly trained athletes, should be close to passing out in high temperatures, especially with what we saw in Qatar 2023 and Singapore 2024. This specific system sounds like a step in the right direction, honestly"", ""I think there's an easier solution: cooling the seat itself, as the battery and engine heat and the scrubbing on the floor is generating most of the heat."", 'Thanks u/SubcooledBoiling . You should look at electricity generation', ""It's not but when I checked the other day I could only find one FIA homologated active cooling fireproof underwear (Which was homologated last month).    \n\nAll other systems and clothing I could find online tended to be American and only homologated to the SFI 3.3 spec.       \n\nSo much like the change in underwear rules pushed manufacturers to create fireproof personal underwear, this should push manufacturers (like OMP, HRX, Puma, Sparco etc etc) to make cooling versions of their current thermals and get them homologated.\n\n**EDIT**.     \nWent to check and the FIA literally updated the list of Homologated protective clothing for drivers today. And the latest entry is a cooling top by Chillout. So it is already working."", ""No one said it's exclusive. It's new to F1 though.

Now let’s get down to business…

\~\~\~

# Trackside Stats

Lol, shit—courtesy of u/F1GuyDan, we now know that if Red Bull used Max Verstappen as a one-driver team, [they would have finished in the same place in the WCC standings every season of Max’s career, except for 2017 and 2022.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goz9xv/f1guydan_if_red_bull_used_max_verstappen_as_a/)

u/F1GuyDan also served up a Reddit specialty—finding new ways to express how disappointing Sergio Pérez has been this year: [We’ve learned he’s closer to Zhou in the standings (who has 0 points) than Max, Charles, and Lando.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqx3zh/f1guydan_guanyu_zhou_is_closer_to_sergio_perez_in/)

**More on Max’s dominance:** [Here’s how he can win his 4th WDC title in Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1go8419/how_max_can_become_champion_in_las_vegas/)

And speaking of fast drivers, [here’s 2024’s Fastest Lap standings as of Brazil…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gorxqs/fastest_laps_2024/)

Along with [2024’s ‘podium’ (so far) for top 5 finishes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpq39z/rn365_top_5_finishes_2024/)

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

Welp, this *should* put to bed any further rumours of where Checo will be next year. [Apparently Sith Lord Christian Horner has given the okay to Perez’s sponsors that he’ll be driving for the main team next year, as per his contract.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gopmsh/marca_checo_p%C3%A9rez_is_not_moving_and_will_start/) 

Unrelated to anything of consequence, but a driver musing nonetheless, [Guenther Steiner had some blunt, choice words on the subject of Lance Stroll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goesf1/guenther_steiner_on_lance_stroll/)

Carlos Sainz was honoured by the Scuderia Ferrari Club in Maranello, [given a plaque that reads, *“Wherever you go, we will continue rooting for you. You’ve entered our hearts, and you’ll stay there.”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplue3/motorsport_last_night_carlos_sainz_was_honored_by/) Hey I’m not crying… You’re crying!

In a twist that caught me off guard but makes sense when you consider historical ties, [Zhou Guanyu—a former Ferrari Driver Academy padawan—is expected to become Scuderia Ferrari’s Reserve Driver for 2025.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gskr71/zhou_guanyu_is_expected_to_be_scuderia_ferraris/) Bravo Zhou!

On the subject of reserve drivers, while there’s no media confirming Mick Schumacher’s recent bit of vague-gramming, [I’d hazard a guess *this* means his time as Mercedes’ reserve is over](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gtcojc/mick_sumachers_instagram_post/), paving the way for King Valtteri’s return.

For those interested in the goings-on of recently departed F1 drivers, [Logan Sargeant has done a seat fitting with IndyCar team Meyer Shank Racing,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp3hj7/otmeyer_shank_racing_step_1_seat_fit_logan/) ahead of what I assume will be a test with the team. As an IndyCar fan who watches all the races, Logie Bear better start sharpening his elbows…

While we’re on the subject of IndyCar, [Romain Grosjean is scrambling to stay on the grid next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp7c4a/grosjean_scrambling_to_stay_on_indycar_grid_in/) Alas, his classic form of oscillating abruptly between high peaks and low lows while collecting a trophy case of crashes won’t help.

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

In a surprising turn of juicy events—that will affect all teams in one way or another—[F1’s Race Director Niels Wittich has been fired](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gppllt/panning_photo_of_charles_in_the_rain_during_q3/) ([rather than stepping down, as the FIA have claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplmhc/jennie_gow_breaking_niels_wittich_to_step_down_as/)). With only three race weekends remaining in 2024, the timing seems rather odd. I daresay we can add another name to the list of those butting heads with FIA head Mohammed Ben Sulayem.

*But ‘ol Rotten Eggs Benny Boy didn’t stop there…* [FIA Compliance Officer Paolo Basarri was also fired last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gr8pxe/bbc_sport_paolo_basarri_leaves_role_as_fia/) Which is *curious,* as Basarri happens to be the official who compiled a report into allegations that Sulayem interfered with operations during two races in 2023. [I think I smell a rat dictator?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ALZTuyM7lg)

In a similar vein, Greg Maffei, president and CEO of F1’s commercial rights holder, Liberty Media, [will leave his role at the end of the year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqd2ir/racefans_on_bluesky_greg_maffei_president_and_ceo/) I daresay we’re starting to see some effects of the FIA-FOM power struggle that’s been quietly reaching a boil since Mohammed took over the FIA leadership.

*The firings will continue until morale improves:* Aston Martin Technical [Director Dan Fallows, who was poached from Red Bull with great fanfare and high expectation, has been let go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpjono/dan_fallows_will_no_longer_serve_as_technical/) Current Aston Martin Executive Director [Bob Bell, a highly regarded design engineer who I’ve never heard of, will fill in as TD on a temporary basis](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpkypa/bbc_executive_director_bob_bell_a_highly_regarded/) (I presume until Lord Newey is able to start drawing in British Racing Green). Daddy Stroll must be losing patience…

Well folks, in case you had any lingering doubts or were clinging to shreds of hope, Renault’s F1 engine program is officially *done.* [Alpine have confirmed their switch to Mercedes’ engine and gearbox from 2026.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpioxc/f1_breaking_alpine_announce_they_will_switch_to_a/) In celebration of their storied success, [here’s a collage of all the championships they powered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpm4t9/so_long_renault_engines_heres_the_wccs_wdcs_they/)

*I was surprised when this one appeared in my timeline…* F1 is working on a proposed 2026 rule change that’ll make life harder for customer teams like Toro Tauri VCARB or Haas: [If a team finishes P5 or higher in the WCC, they have to design all non-listed parts on their own after a period of three years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gru00i/tobi_gr%C3%BCner_formula_1_is_working_on_a_rule_change/) I can’t imagine this idea will go down well or smoothly…

In a related-and-exciting bit of news for Haas, while insisting have no plans to build an F1 engine, [Toyota wants to give Haas independence from Ferrari](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gsioi5/toyota_wants_to_give_haas_independence_from/) as they settle into supporting the project on the aerodynamics side.

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

The fine folks at [Ferrari appear to believe that F1’s wind tunnel time allocation rules (the worse you’re doing, the more time you get) will be a game changer for the 2026 regulation overhaul.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goofx4/why_ferrari_thinks_f1s_wind_tunnel_rules_could_be/) Their notion of course being that teams not fighting for the championship will self-sabotage/withhold resources in the first half of 2025 in order to get maximum wind tunnel time ahead of 2026.

There was an F1 Commission meeting last Wednesday, [in which they seem to have settled on a few items, courtesy of trusty F1 insider Chris Medland:](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqiv4p/chrismedlandf1_the_f1_commission_meeting_today/)

* A spec driver cooling kit for when a heat hazard is declared has been approved from next season onwards.  
* Yet-to-be-known tweaks for how the starting grid will close up when a team withdraws a car have been agreed upon.  
* And the post-Abu Dhabi rookie sprint race is slated for a 2026 debut.

# This Week in Formula 1 History

**Brazil, 2018.** [Esteban Ocon collides with Max Verstappen, causing him to lose the lead of the race](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp9wzr/throwback_to_2018_brazilian_gp_when_ocon_collided/)—leading to some spicy interactions in the paddock.

**Macau, 2014.** [A young Max Verstappen finished 7th in the Macau Grand Prix after starting in 24th](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gsltl7/today_10_years_ago_max_verstappen_raced_in_the/)—a mighty impressive feat on a fast, twisty street circuit.

If you’d like to know driver-turned-pundit Karun Chandok’s answer to the delightful question of, *“How do you deal with driving a shitbox?”*, [look no further than his Reddit AMA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goxl5c/karun_chandhoks_reddit_ama/)

Take a break, race fans! [Kit-Kat is now the official chocolate bar of Formula 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gorv51/formula_1_welcomes_kitkat_as_official_chocolate/)

u/jameypricephoto treats us again with [this lovely, rainy shot of Charles.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gppllt/panning_photo_of_charles_in_the_rain_during_q3/)

Formula 1 old heads and purists rejoice! [The Monaco Grand Prix has extended their contract with F1 through 2031.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gr1ih7/monaco_grand_prix_contract_extended_to_2031/) Take *that* fears of falling off the calendar!

1guz22f,Why is George beating or matching Lewis for 2 seasons out of 3 so overlooked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1guz22f/why_is_george_beating_or_matching_lewis_for_2/,2024-11-19, Discussion,"Seriously, unless we agree that Lewis is basically nowhere near his prime level, then why is Russell not getting any credit for what he’s doing.

Yet people act like he’s merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about “experimental setups” or “Lewis is just unmotivated”, but, I’m sorry, that’s just a cop-out. Then we can just argue endlessly that basically no driver is worse than another driver, since there could always be intangibles like that, “oh, he just doesn’t care about driving in midfield cars”. really? 


I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it’s just that people overlook George because they don’t like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance. It's hard to compare when we have no real baseline when it comes to the car."", '> Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019\n\nIt was Charles 2nd season in F1 against a driver who was competing for a title the season before. \n\nIn general I do agree Russell has been underrated but don’t agree with all the arguments you’ve put forward.', ""I believe it is because how it is doing it. A lot of the times they are not necessarily next to each other, what I mean is. Look at Brazil, one qualifies Top 5~6 the other P12 or something, and Lewis is not a P10+ driver, I believe whenever the car is this apart, it is because Lewis has a very shitty setup that makes the car undrivable. \n\nIt reminds me a bit of Alonso first year in Alpine when he came back, Ocon was beating him clearly, until it was released that the car had some limitations that did not adapt to his driving style (Imagine what type of thing was been Alonso one of if not the drivers the best adapt to any type of car), when the issue was fixed, the roles were reversed.\n\nI don't think George is bad, I also don't think he is better than Lewis, I just feel he gets better outcome with his setups (That could be because he is better adapting to different setup), and Lewis just gets terrible setup that makes the car undriveable."", 'Mercedes are so incredibly inconsistent and incompetent that it’s basically impossible to judge what the car is actually capable for on any given weekend or if both drivers get given that same car. \n\n2022 was just a horrifically unlucky year for Lewis. I think he wins Hungary if his DRS doesn’t fail in Q3 and leaves him P7 (he ended up beating George who took pole). He wins Mexico if Merc don’t fuck up the tyre choices. He gets very close at the very least in Silverstone and Zandvoort without badly timed SCs and strategy errors. Brazil was a guaranteed win but Max crashed into him and as a result he lost places and 3 tenths worth of floor performance. And he took the brunt of the “experiments” that Merc ran to try and dig themselves out of their own mess and as a result lost even more ground. \n\n2023 was a less unlucky season and the balance immediately reverted. And Lewis still misses out on Hungary (brake issues that wore off with less fuel) and Singapore (he gets Lando and Carlos). \n\nWon’t even get started on how badly he’s been shafted this season. It’s made the farewell a lot less emotional and difficult than would have been expected.', 'Wild statement: “Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill”', 'is it overlooked though? people have been talking about it all season. and thinking lewis will be more competitive next year is not a matter of a worse teammate but a car that hopefully will suit better his driving style.', ""Obviously Hamilton is past his prime, but he's still a great driver and one of the best in the grid, and so is Russell. \n\nI think Russell is on a similar level to Leclerc and Norris and above Sainz. I rate Leclerc a bit higher than Russell and Norris though, but it's hard to know for sure who's better because they never drove the same car."", 'Why did Jenson and Nico beat Lewis, despite being nowhere near goat status? The sort of questions that get you downvoted to oblivion my friend.', 'Because it is an average car and the questions you ask about drivers are things like ""What can Lewis do in a top car?"" And we know the answer to that is win championships. \n\nAs for George, we don\'t have that answer yet. Though personally, I think he\'s had the second-best season out of any driver this year, with only the obvious exceptional talent of Max Verstappen having outperformed him. \n\nBut whether it is quali performances, making the most out of shite set-ups or capitalising in races, George has spent the entire season making the most out of what he has in a way no other driver really has. I mean hell, if not for the DSQ in Spa he\'d be beating Lewis by 37 points. One team error going the other way and we\'d be talking about him dominating the season against one of the best to ever do it.']",31,55,0.63,31,45,45,31,55,0.63,31
