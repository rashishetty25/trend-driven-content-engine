Expect absolutely awful practices and corruption to the extreme.', '# Madrid plans to exempt F1 from noise regulations, changes its route and temporarily relocates residents because of the noise.\n\n*The governments of Ayuso and Almeida acknowledge the impact on houses, but argue that it is not ""serious"" because of the ""short duration"" of an event of ""about thirteen hours"" a year.*\n\nThe conclusion that the Formula 1 Grand Prix of Madrid will exceed the legal noise limits during the practice sessions and the race has led the Department of Environment, Agriculture and the Interior of the Community of Madrid to propose that the City Council grant an exemption from compliance with the regulations; that the layout of the circuit be modified to move it away from the nearest houses, as proposed by the promoter; and even that the neighbours be temporarily relocated to avoid the nuisance, ""given the short period of time in relation to the motor racing events"". This is according to the documents seen by EL PAÍS, which also state that the promoter will try to reach agreements on economic compensation with the businesses affected by the race, which will take place near the Ifema exhibition centre between 2026 and 2035 and is expected to force the temporary closure of a petrol station, for example.\n\nAyuso\'s government estimates the bill it will have to pay to the state for its share of the public transport subsidy at seven million euros.\n\nBoth regional and municipal technicians agree that the F1 race will mean that the noise levels permitted by the capital\'s regulations will be exceeded during the days of the training sessions and the race, affecting the residents closest to the circuit.\n\nThese would be the houses to the north of the M-11 in the Valdelasfuentes neighbourhood, particularly those adjacent to the Ifema extension on Francisco Umbral and Florentino Rodríguez Alonso streets (the distance to the circuit of the most exposed houses in this area is around 40 metres); and those in the area of Calle de las Pedroñeras, in the eastern part of the Canillas neighbourhood, and in the northern part of the La Piovera neighbourhood (the distance to the circuit of the most exposed houses in this area varies between approximately 320 and 500 metres).\n\nThese homes would be affected by levels above 80 dB during training and races. The solution, as already proposed by the promoter, is therefore to install noise barriers, modify the layout and, above all, obtain the exemption provided for by the law to comply with the regulations.\n\n\\[...\\]', 'they should add more roundabouts', ""Surely less money would be lost by refreshing Jarama (they could still call it Madrid GP), but that wouldn't be cool enough I guess.
