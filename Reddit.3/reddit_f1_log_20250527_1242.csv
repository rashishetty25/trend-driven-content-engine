I don\'t understand the obsession with trying to force Monaco to be an orthodox F1 race, unless you magically shrink the cars down to F3/FE size, it simply won\'t be. \n\nWhat makes Monaco hard to master is that, the more you push, the closer you are to clipping the wall and ending your session. It\'s why Friday and Saturday are the \'action\' days for F1. At the end of this race, Oscar was closest to stacking it because he was the only one pushing to try and catch Max/Lando/Charlie. \n\nRather than try to make it a traditional race, why not try to add something more radical that keeps the drivers on the edge? \n\n* Minimum laptimes in the race. This is a standard for oval racing, where you must maintain a minimum speed, and we have it in F1 for quali. Whether you do it as a set limit based on practice times, or a percentage of the current fastest lap, have it so if you lap below a set pace then you\'re black flagged on safety grounds. This would stop the sandbagging that dogs the race. \n* A hot lap competition with Indy 500 quali rules and points down to 20th. Set a three hour block, and you can put your name in to be next on track to set a flying lap. You either join the back of the queue and can keep your existing time, or if you want to jump to the front you lose it. If you hit the barrier and damage your car, you lose your time. It\'d keep drivers pushing, which is where Monaco comes alive. \n* Make it a NASCAR stage race, bringing out the safety car and doing a standing restart after 25 and 50 laps. Add in a mandated green flag pitstop (that has to be taken after X laps) to stop people just changing rubber under caution. Close the field back up. \n\nMonaco is not a normal grand prix track, and so I don\'t know why we want it to host a normal grand prix in the modern era.

The ""typical"" greats are often drivers from different areas so it is really hard to compare them equally and not only did the quality of cars in general improved massively but also technical differences like stick-shift to automatic, engines etc. 

Without mentioning any names, what are the attributes a driver needs to have to be your number one or top 5 etc.? 

  
For me it is the circumstances a driver gets and what he makes out of it. There are drivers who have multiple championships with multiple cars and there are drivers who sit in one nearly perfect car and win, but mostly very close of their teammate. 

And currently my view on another driver shifts, because I thought he has the best car, but it seems that either he is an unbelievable driver or no one can use the car, but him. ","['Mostly vibes, and when someone comes with good arguments for another driver, I use my emotional arguments to justify my personal bests.', 'I don‚Äôt.
