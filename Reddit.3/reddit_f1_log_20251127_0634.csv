Once teams started coming up with crafty ways to generate ""accidental"" dirty air the FIA didn\'t step in to course correct. An example being the front wing plane to end plate connections being shrunk down to a wire allowing air to spill to the sides.\n\nMy hot take: If they kept true to the intent of the regs, as they did with Astons more traditional wing design that did 1 race before a rule adjustment, the racing would be better.', ""I also think that ironically, the cars being so close in pace and the dirty air team up to make races worse because the delta needed to overtake is often larger than the delta between the pace of the cars. That's why we had some people sticking the car on a good position in quali and then staying there for the entirety of the race."", 'Even if next years regs make the races more competitive, the car designers are smarter than the FIA spec makers.

I know it would be hard to make that safe but who said anything about safe?"", ""Some very interesting numbers here.\n\n\nWe're still better off than 2021 and the previous regs but we have less tyre Deg this year, and a noticeably weaker slipstream than previous regs."", 'They could have kept updating the aero rules each season to keep up with things teams were doing that led to an increase in turbulent air, I was under the assumption prior to 2022 that a working group had been set up to do just that but it clearly never happened.

Strategic variants and tyre offsets lead to good racing. When everyone lines up on the grid by order of pace and they all manage their tyres for most of the race and make pitstops at roughly the same time then you're rarely going to get all that much happening regardless of dirty air.\n\nDirty air has been improved over what came before but the tyre management has been the key thing that's held back the racing and they don't seem to be doing anything to address that."", ""The ability to follow isn't a problem if you have tyres that lose enough lap time that it opens up different strategies because then the tyres will naturally allow cars to battle both on track and strategically. \n\nThose races where track position is important so drivers go on differing strategies that come back together late on and you don't know whether the delta is enough to overtake (so something like Bahrain 2021) is way more exciting than closely following cars where the faster car has a minor advantage but is able to overtake and drive off into the distance."", 'Blaming it on ""the current rules era"" is false.
