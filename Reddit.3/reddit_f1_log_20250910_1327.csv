**Fernando Alonso:** I remember once South Korea in 2010. It was a red flag in the middle of the race. It was very wet, aquaplaning everywhere. We stopped on the grid and it was Mark Webber first. I was second. I came to the, um, to the grid and I spoke with him. You know, the track is really bad. You know, his aquaplaning, it will be a disaster if we restart the race now. And I knew that the race was about to restart soon. He(Webber) said that I entered in his mind that the track was worse than what actually it was. And and he crashed after the restart.

He seems to have everything under control at all times.\n\n>“He has a self-confidence I’ve probably never seen before. He’s not worried about other teams, other philosophies, or other designs. He believes his will be the best.”\n\n>Alonso said Aston Martin’s recent struggles were turned around by leadership moves such as Newey’s signing. “Arrivals like Newey have allowed us to reset our expectations and our motivation,” he said.\n\n>“If you don’t see any change when the situation isn’t good, then it becomes a problem. Then you lose confidence. But I think what I’ve found at Aston Martin is a team and a leadership that will never be happy until we win.”\n\n>Alonso recalled Newey’s visit to Monaco earlier this year. “He doesn’t talk to many people, but at the same time he’s always thinking and tinkering with things. The front wing here, the suspension there – I think he’s more of an artist than an engineer.”\n\n>Finally, the 32-time grand prix winner said he and Newey share a similar mindset. “When we’re motivated, we become obsessed,” he smiled.\n\nInterview basically confirms that Newey has been tinkering with the 2025 car, as a side-quest.

Here is my question: who makes those replicas and when? I would think the teams themselves are not capable of making replicas of the trophy, especially those that are porcelain, very ornate/elaborate, etc. Is it the trophy manufacturers who provide the replica to the driver?

This my first post here y'all so please be gentle lol

1. Both the Aston and the Ferrari are beasts, so I can potentially see one last head-to-head dog fight between Lewis and Fernando. The two drivers that turned me from a casual fan to an F1 diehard, getting the chance at a truly storybook send-off at the top of the sport would be dope
2. Two and Three are connected, but I actually do hope Hadjar gets the ""promotion"" and absolutely kills it. It would be so much fun to watch someone go at it with Max in equal machinery. Max is genuinely one of the most fun and exciting drivers I have seen, and I always felt cheated that Daniel kinda ran from the challenge against him. I think Hadjar is a dog and ROTY, it would be cinema.
3. Because this is a new regulation cycle and all the PUs are brand new, technically, this would be the first year VCARB might actually live up to its ""sister team"" moniker and be on equal footing. If Yuki and Lawson are their drivers, there is a real fun thought experiment that Red Bull can do, the main car can be an aggressive, unhinged monster, while the VCARB can be a more balanced affair on equal PU with no hand-me-downs. Watching them this year has made me excited for the two teams to actually duke it out next year.
4. This is where it goes off the deep end. Both Bottas and/or Checo get podiums at COTA. I think it's cool to have an American works team in the biggest motorsport in the world, and call it bias, but I do think it would be a wonder for the sport for casual American fans to feel they might have a competitive team. I know Haas is also American, but they are, without a doubt, the poorest team in F1, and having Cadillac build an aura similar to the Tifosi would be cool.
5. In my hypothetical 99.99% won't happen dream season, Ferrari and Aston would be fighting out for the WCC. And I pray Williams just comes out of nowhere to beat both McLaren and Mercedes. We have had the same four teams at the top of the pecking order for so long. It would be so refreshing to see a true customer team (I say this just because Williams doesn't make a road car) in the mix. Also, their colors, kits, and drivers just scream Formula 1 to me; they feel Nostalgic!
6. This is a tiny one, but an Ollie/Gabi Podium or win would be dope just coz these two have been so refreshing this season. Ollie has been so impressive; I feel like Ferrari has their driver of the future, and Gabi just has this aggression and feel for the sport that is cool. (This one is definitely just for the vibes)
7. I did the worst math on earth, and the 2026 cars look like they'll be the smallest they have been since 2016/2017, so I'm on my hands and knees begging the universe for more fights. This season has made me feel like all the drivers have been in handcuffs, and I get the feeling they just want to let out. Zandvoort was a pretty good race because a lot of the drivers came back from the break with elbows out

That's it that's the wishlist. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts. I don't think any of these will happen but new season, new regs if this isn't the time for wishful thinking when is.

P.S.: Yes, I am a Ferrari fan, Williams is my midfield team of choice, and watching the king Hulkenberg bring a podium to my favorite backmarker team (I hate kick, Stake and the pickle rick green btw I liled them as Alfa Romeo and Charles is my guy of the current era) brought a tear to my eye.","['I need Williams to build a rocketship and have Alex win the WDC.\n\n  \nI strongly, STRONGLY believe he is a capable enough driver.

The odd point will be a miracle tbh.\n\n5 - Williams beating Merc and McLaren is pure fantasy\n\n6 - Freak results can happen, but expect the Audi to be struggling with the Cadillacs with a completely new PU manufacturer with zero experience of F1 (look at Honda's early years of their V6).\n\n7 - The size difference is pretty small (5% or so), they are considerably bigger than they were in the 00s when overtaking was still very tough.\n\n  \nYou said it is a wishlist and it is certainly that, but if any of them come off I would be suprised."", 'I need an Albon win or several, more Williams podiums, a true McLaren/Ferrari Battle (with Mercedes and Red Bull comfortably beneath, scrapping for third), and in a perverse sense of sadism I want Cadillac to be a total shitshow.

Yet it was Ocon who got the seat in the far superior Force India car, whilst Wehrlein was booted to Sauber. In 2016, the Sauber was no better than the Manor. According to the points chart, Wehrlein's head to head racing record against Ericsson wasn't overly convincing, but he still scored two points finishes in a car that was effectively no better than a Manor.

But then he was booted out of the team in favour of Charles Leclerc, and we never heard from him again. What happened to him?

It happened to Esteban, it happened to Alex, to KMag, to Hulk, it is a thing that happens for one reason or another. Alex did DTM in his off year, just like Pascal did the year after leaving F1. Pascal was even on the Mercedes team, so clearly they hadn't abandoned him yet. I wouldn't have been surprised at all if Pascal got another F1 shot after a year off... except for Charles Leclerc. \n\nCharles Leclerc demolished Ericsson as a rookie, which a rookie outscoring a non-rookie teammate hasn't even happened since. (George could be mentioned, but Kubica did score that one time, and also, let's be real, Kubica wasn't a normal veteran.) Suddenly, it didn't matter that Pascal was better than Ericsson, because Ericsson was out of a seat himself.\n\nThe earlier parts I don't know much about. I didn't watch then and haven't looked into it. Both of them were Mercedes juniors. I'm not sure if Pascal was managed by Toto or not like Ocon is. Maybe Ocon was favored from that. Maybe it was because like you said, Ocon was immediately nearly on pace with Pascal, even though Pascal received preseason testing and 12 races before Esteban got there."", 'IIRC they said he was a bit of a diva in the pits with the mechanics and engineers back then, and in the race they ended up 3-3 (not counting DNFs) with Ocon arriving halfway through the season.', 'I do wonder what life would be like had he gone to Merc in 2017.\n\nNot that that was ever on the cards.\n\nHe did get a world championship eventually though.']",0,32,0.28,0,28,28,0,32,0.28,0
1ncomu6,Thought experiment with Oscar v Lando,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ncomu6/thought_experiment_with_oscar_v_lando/,2025-09-09, Statistics,"After last weekend, I decided to run a little experiment. It turned out to be more eye-opening than I expected, because I thought it would confirm something I already believed—but instead, it showed me something completely different.

With a little help from AI, I used random number generation to adjust Oscar Piastri’s form to reflect how he performed last year.

Looking back at all of his finishes from 2024, his average was 5.1 with a standard deviation of 3.0. So the idea was to simulate his current season as if he hadn’t improved, using last year’s stats as the baseline. I thought this would create a model where Lando was clearly McLaren’s number one driver.

My assumption going in was that, if Oscar wasn’t consistently near the front, Max Verstappen would be seriously challenging Lando and might be ahead. 

Here’s how I set it up: I left all other drivers’ positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spots based on that statistical profile, promoting the drivers ahead of him. For example, in my model he finished third at Spa instead of winning. There were a few other adjustments like that, but he still only finished outside the points once and even got two wins, which felt realistic.

What I actually ended up with was Lando leading Max by about 70 points. Behind them, there’s roughly a 60-point gap to George Russell, followed by Charles and Oscar close together, about 50 points ahead of Lewis, with Kimi and Alex another 50 points back.

So what I learned is this: Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar’s form stayed at last year’s level.

I’m Australian, so of course I’d love to see Oscar win the whole thing, but I’ll happily say this: Lando is fantastic this year. And unsurprisingly, even in this model, McLaren is running away with the Constructors’ Championship.","['There’s a reason people get degrees in statistics and other fields. \n\nWhat you’ve done is throw darts in the dark to draw a conclusion with no objective meaning. \n\nJust saying “AI” doesn’t make something meaningful or correct.\n\nOf course Lando has been good. He’s one DNF away from being in an extremely close fight for the championship. You don’t need any weird statistical manipulation to tell you that.', '""If you just change everything, everything will appear different""\n\n\n-Will Buxton', ""Maybe im taking it at too simplictic of a level, but how does making Oscar run worse peove Landos improvement?\n\nWhat happens when you run the same stats against Lando comapred to this year?\n\nDid you include McLarens technical inprovements and mid-speed corner dominance into the equation?\n\nI still feel that a drivers biggest push to improve comes from his own team mate's performance and data comparison. If you're cruising over your team mate, and winning against other teams comfortably, there isnt the pressure to find those extra 0.010's."", "">\xa0Lando has improved drastically this year\n\nHow did you conclude that Lando improved and not that McLaren's car did relative to the rest of the field?"", '""I left all other drivers’ positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spot""\n\n\nSo you arbitrarily made Oscar worse in your game, so Oscar ended up worse. I don\'t want to be too sarcastic but that is hardly surprising.\n\n\nAlso, your conclusion is that Norris improved much? Isn\'t that like killing Batman and concluding Robin is amazing? I mean, yeah, if you make one of the two title contenders worse in your game, the remaining one wins.', "">Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar’s form stayed at last year’s level.\n\nWhy would you make the assumption that Piastri's form has stayed the same as last year? It has been well-documented -- both by Piastri and by McLaren -- how he has applied himself to address the shortcomings that he had in 2024, and I think you would be hard-pressed to argue that he has not improved as a result."", 'so you entered data and and lowered oscars finishes to make it "" realistic "" and then deduced that lando has improved, informative.......\n\nDid you know if we lowered all of maxs finishes statiscally yuki has improved', '""With a little help from AI"" girl no', 'Sorry mate. Your explanation is not making sense.', ""If a driver does not improve from 1 season to the next but the car improves into a dominant car, their standard deviation of position would decrease.\xa0\n\n\nSimple example of this would be if you made the car 5 seconds a lap faster than everyone but Piastri's performance did not improve, his standard deviation of position would likely be between 0 and 1 because he'd finish 2nd most races.""]",0,36,0.13,0,327,327,0,0,0.0,0
