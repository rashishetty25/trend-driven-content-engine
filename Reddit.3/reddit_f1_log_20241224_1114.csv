1hkvmr3,[Mercedes AMG F1] 23/12/2009: The day Michael Schumacher announced his return to F1 with Mercedes,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkvmr3/mercedes_amg_f1_23122009_the_day_michael/,2024-12-23, Social Media,,"['Damn, right after the Russell skiing post', '""Oh yeah 7 more titles incoming"" - some random fan in 2009', ""I wasn't watching back then, but it must have been such a crazy announcement to hear. Were there rumors for a while before it was announced?"", 'Michael’s comeback success was different that what everyone expected. But this announcement was insane at the time. For people who had followed him in his first career knew he left too early, still capable of amazing drives. \n\nThe motorcycle accident definitely changed what he could do on a race track, there were some serious injuries, and one to the skull which generally results in a fatality. \n\nYet  the 40 year old improved every year till he retired again. In his final year he was faster than Rosberg in race pace and they were 10-10 in Quali. Rosberg in his prime against a 43 year old, who also got pole in Monaco.\n\nMichael in my opinion is in the top 3 of Grand Prix racing. Wish he could be in the paddock and part of the current formula 1 culture. #KeepFightingMichael', ""I had pretty much stopped watching F1 regularly once he retired in 2006. By 2009, my cable tv package no longer had the sports channel that broadcast F1. I remember being so excited hearing Schumi's come back, i switched to a more expensive cable package. His first test was in a GP2 car, he came within 4/10ths of the lap record sitting in a race car for the first time in over 3 yrs and in a machinery completely different to what he was used to. You could see he still had the pace between 2010 to 2012, but reliability issues, mid-grid positions prone to crashes and few unforced errors pretty much brought an end to his comeback. Ross Brawn would later credit Schumacher's feedback and work with the engineers are being the foundation for Mercedes championship success in 2014.\n\nWe now know both Williams and Mclaren tried signing Schumacher multiple times in the 90s and 2000s. It is anyones guess how many more titles he could have won had he jumped from one competitive team to another instead of toiling much of the 90s without titles at Ferrari. One of the greatest, if not the greatest driver ever to compete in the sport."", ""What people don't know is that Schumacher  had a life threatening motorcycle crash in early 2009.\n\nHis PR-team tried to down play it, but if you saw the leaked pictures with comments by his doctor at the time.\nThat crash was more than serious.\n\nThe fact he survived that one should have been a sign for him to stop. Mark Hughes some years ago  wrote in an article that a crash like this is 90%  fatal. \nMichael was insanely lucky. \n\nHe already had  permanent brain damage thanks to a shattered attery, he also had a broken neck and a fracture at the base of his skull."", 'Imagine if he stayed with Ferrari one more year, could’ve made 2007 very epic.', 'Myself as a youthful 18 year old was so excited to be able to play as Schumacher in the new F1 game that year.

Of course, as a fan my plight pales in comparison to that of his family and close friends. Reading that interview with Mick where he all but openly admits that he yearns to have his dad back at this stage of his racing career and life is heartbreaking.', 'This was such an exciting announcement. I never expected Michael to win straight away considering the gap in racing but just wanted him to win 1 race. Looking back at it I am glad he came back because he looked relaxed and seems to have enjoyed that period and also got the closure he needed.', 'seeing his face is like twisting the knife, i feel so bad for him and his current situation']",3888,110,0.98,3888,3943,3943,139,1,0.0,139

The fact that Mekies still has a job there is the ultimate insult because he consistently fucks the drivers in the race every single time.\n\nIf they hadn't fucked them over every single time they went out things would have looked a lot different for Daniel."", ""At this point I'm convinced any mention of Daniel in a news article is an attempt by the publisher for clicks. It's time for the F1 media to let it go (and I'm a fan of his!)."", ""Despite everything having played out as it has, deep down, my gut tells me that had daniel gotten the RB main seat, he would've done really well. And no, this is not me and my wishful thinking, I genuinely believe so.\n\nWhen that vcarb was semi-decent early in the season, daniel hit some peaks in his performance, putting it among the top 5, where it just does not belong, definitely not in Q3 quali in the top 5 with 4 top teams hogging the top 8 spots. Given a good car, one that speaks to his strengths, his peaks could genuinely be hit more often. His problem, and VCARBs problem was that the car was generally a shitbox, and often the team self-sabotaged with strategy.\n\nI think the RB main team's car is exactly that - A more refined formula 1 car that suits his strengths well, ones that he shares with Max, on the extremes of balance. There is a reason RB have struggled to find someone capable of filling that seat since daniel left, because genuinely no one else can likely keep up with the car's design direction the way max does. But daniel already had done so, before he left. He was the last direct rival to max in that seat, driving the same car, with the same development directions.\n\nNot to mention, Vcarb TP mekies and ceo bayer repeatedly praised daniel on his technical inputs that helped in developing their car, something they don't really do/did in Yuki's case. That should not come as a surprise given what daniel achieved at Renault with that shitbox of a car and team. RB could've benefitted more from having Daneil in the 2nd seat giving his inputs that were on the same track as max, rather than put up with checo's nonsense for so long, that caused them to waste so much development time and even rollback the chassis on his car just to please him and clear the air on 'its the car' discourse. So much valuable time and development lost that could've been avoided if Daniel was in that seat, working in tandem with Max.\n\nAnyways, that's just my 2 cents. Sorry for the pseudo-rant.\n\nTL;DR:  Daniel's peaks in a shitty vcarb that he helped develop & improve with his feedback would've translated very well to the main RB team where he would work with Max on the same development direction (their driving styles are similar), instead of wasting valuable time and money on checo and the opposite development direction for the 2nd car.  They never replaced Daniel, the only driver apart from Max that did excellently in that main team with the same development direction that Max prefers."", 'For me, it will always be a “what if” with Ricciardo and his last injury. He came out blazing in the VCARB and built some overnight hype around himself. I can’t help but wonder if he had another amazing result or two and they gave him a shot at RBR again. \n\nThat being said, post-injury, his form didn’t seem to impress and I don’t disagree with the decisions made for him to lose his seat.']",1395,170,0.93,1395,4463,4463,46,1,0.0,46
1hkqm89,Women liking F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkqm89/women_liking_f1/,2024-12-23, Discussion,"so I'm a teen (f) and I've been watching F1 since I can remember. I literally grew up watching every race, my father being a hard-core fan. Hell I saw some of these ""big"" races, like I remember watching anxiously as Romain Grosjean spun off, the car catching fire and I even remember then the feed being cut off cause they did not want to show anymore incase he didn't make it out alive. 

Anyway, I've been a core ferrari fan all my life. It's not because of any one thing in particular and I don't support all of the teams decisions, but because it was a team my father once supported. I fell in love with RED and the emotions attached with the teams previous driver like Räikkönen and Vettel. 

But now, it's become so insanely mainstream. Drive to survive has made it into this insanely big thing where there are so many people who now all of a sudden care about motorsport only cause the drivers look good. There's no issue with being a new fan, however my issue is that so many people talking only about the drivers looks invalidates the skill and people who care about the racing aspect, especially as a woman.
The moment you talk about F1 with men who don't know you, the first assumption is that we only watch the sport cause of the men. I had to mention the ferrari thing earlier now because it happens a lot more when you saw you're a ferrari fan.

Now, obviously certain men are the issue but it's genuinely becoming increasingly common to have a view point as such and I wanted to know of other women who watch F1 have experienced a similar outlook.

Disclaimer, I'm not talking about all men or only men but it's simply an observation.","[""For every gate there's a crappy keeper that wants to deem people not worthy.

People that are worth your time will come to realize that you love F1 for the racing, and those that don’t, just don’t waste your time worrying about them. \n\nI’m sure your dad knows that you like the racing, and your close friends probably do too. If some random schmuck thinks it’s cause you’re in love with Leclerc who cares? Like the things you like!', ""Guys were gatekeeping female fans wayyyyy before DTS. I've been watching since '95 or so and it was like that back then too. It used to bother me too, but I learned just ignore them. You don't have to be able to name the top 3 of every single Monaco race since the dawn of time to be a fan. You don't have to justify yourself to some insecure bozo. \n\nMy personal opinion is that people are free to enjoy a sport however they please. If they go for a driver for looks, that's their choice. It doesn't hinder my enjoyment of the sport in any way, so why should it bother me? I'm sure drivers don't mind: more money for them from merch and buzz.\n\n I'll save my annoyance for developments such as INSANE ticket pricing, or what races they put in (\\*cough\\* Qatar \\*cough\\*) or take out (German GP!), or Helmut Marko LOL"", 'Wait....

Anything that teen girls like is always looked through a prism of frivolity, even and sometimes especially when it\'s something ""traditionally male"". Unfortunately, some people are determined to gatekeep no matter what, and it\'s not worth your time or energy to worry about what people like that think of you. Equally, people who do like F1 for the drivers\' looks are allowed to do so, and it\'s a valid way to consume it even if it\'s not your preference. There are plenty of things men are into because the women associated with it are hot!\n\nBut I\'d also encourage you to try to cultivate relationships with any boys you meet who don\'t automatically go down that route - I realized when I got to university that I\'d (in what was generally rational self-preservation) stopped engaging with boys entirely about sport. It took me ages to clock that some of the boys I met in university (who I later became friends with) weren\'t asking me about football because they wanted to ""test"" me or ""prove"" I wasn\'t a real fan, but because they were *actually interested in what I thought*. \n\nSo yes, keep an open mind, don\'t feel like you need to justify yourself to anyone, and just enjoy following the sport in whatever way you like. :-)']",926,331,0.78,926,6138,6138,37,-1,0.0,37

Please [direct these to the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/formula1) instead.","[""I'd like to get people's thoughts on Kimi Raikkonen. There's no doubt he was a fantastic driver, but how fantastic, exactly? \n\nI recently watched Beat Zehnder's beyond the grid, where he rated Raikkonen as the fastest driver he worked with. Additionally, Marc Priestley said that Raikkonen was the fastest driver he ever worked with, even quicker than Alonso and Hamilton. Furthermore, Vettel mentioned in his beyond the grid that Raikkonen was the most naturally gifted team mate he ever worked with.\n\nHe's an interesting case for me, and the reason why he's an interesting case is because you can hear all these things about how good a driver Raikkonen was, with some extremely high (and over the top) praise of his skill level. But the problem is........that praise isn't really translated to his results on the track.\xa0 As good as he was, he doesn't really live up to the hype.\n\nI really struggle to believe that Raikkonen was this amazing top driver on Michelin tyres exclusively, and never recovered once Michelin quit F1. That doesn't logically follow for me, and seems like a convenient way to paint Raikkonen as better than he really was (of which, don't get me wrong, he was amazing, but what people say about him seems over the top). \n\nYet I can't deny that what insiders say about him tend to see it differently , that Raikkonen was actually **that** good.\n\nTl,Dr - simple question \nDo you think that Raikkonen was a driver, who early in his career,\xa0 was on par with Alonso & Schumacher?"", 'Why do commentators keep pronouncing his name as ""Shaw LeClaire""?', 'I think a lot of Raikkonen\'s reputation and following came from his oftentimes blunt assessments like the ""leave me alone; I know what I\'m doing"" comment in Abu Dhabi. He never really cared for media commitments, but there were also times when his heart clearly wasn\'t in it anymore. I think he really only returned to Ferrari because Ferrari were very reluctant to promote Bianchi; not because Bianchi didn\'t deserve it, but because Ferrari were too conservative with their young driver program. When Raikkonen returned in 2012, he was very obviously doing it for the money, and when he moved to Alfa Romeo in 2019, it was clear that his best days were behind him. It was only a question of how long he was willing to trundle around in the minor points positions before he retired.\n\nSo in the end, he was a quick driver whose career is very much divided into two halves. In the first half he was highly rated and probably deserved more championships than he actually won, probably because of some mis-timed career moves. But in the second half he was struggling for motivation and his reputation was more down to his blunt interactions than his outright speed. He wasn\'t the same Raikkonen who had impressed in the first half of his career. He\'s in a bit of a funny spot for me -- both highly-rated and over-rated at the same time.', ""> But the problem is........that praise isn't really translated to his results on the track.\xa0 As good as he was, he doesn't really live up to the hype.  \n  \nI think it's something that we've seen with many drivers - if all goes well and they get a chance for the perfect lap many drivers can be unbelievably fast.  \n  \nBut what's the difference between various drivers considered as goats, is that they can do it on demand and when necessary as long as they can.  \nI think for Schumacher the 98 Hungarian GP is the usual example:  \n  \n> “Michael, you have 19 laps to pull out 25 seconds. We need 19 qualifying laps from you.”  \n  \nAnd him being able to comply with the team's request. The same can be said about Max or Lewis, where they had to be commanded to drive to a delta, instead of going at their natural pace"", 'At his best years (2003-2007), Raikkonen was very good (dominating Coulthard and Montoya in 2004-2005 was especially good), but even in these seasons I don’t think he was at the level of Alonso and Schumacher, more the level of Button. He obviously had a stellar year in 2005, the best of his career, but in a weird sort of way, I think the 2005 McLaren’s unreliability helped the perception of him. If he won he was brilliant, and if it broke down he was so unlucky (but not lucky to be driving such a fast car!). \n\nHis career outside of the 2003-2007 period is pretty underwhelming. The only full time teammates he beat outside of that era were Grosjean in his first two years (who was starting to get on terms with him towards the end of 2013) and Giovinazzi. He was beaten by Massa in 2008-09 (during his prime) and was easily beaten by Alonso and Vettel across 2014-2018. I find it impossible to reconcile the general perception of him with his results on track, when you have to ignore 80% of a drivers career in order to rate them so high, there’s a problem. There are three possible explanations for his performances without Michelins. Either he declined abnormally early, he was horribly unadaptable, or was just never that good in the first place, none of which are particularly flattering for him. It’s probably a combination of all three. I remember Alan Permane said on Beyond the Grid he would sort of do the bare minimum, so maybe early in his career he could get by on pure talent, but later in his career being lazy caught up with him.\n\nIn conclusion, I think while Raikkonen was great at his best, even in these years he wasn’t as good as Schumacher or Alonso, and he certainly wasn’t as good as them across his whole career. He probably declined a bit after his title, (lack of motivation?) was very particular about car setup (which made him look really lost when the car didn’t suit him like in 2008, 2014, 2015, 2017), and was probably a bit overrated to begin with. Still the most recent Ferrari champion though.', ""Kimi knew instinctively the fastest way a car could go, unstable rear for extra rotation, just like Schumi and Verstappen also prefers. And if the car couldn't be set up like that, he didn't care.\n\nThere's also some other stuff about tires but that is too deep to get in to. He was the naturally fastest driver I ever saw in the sport."", 'The French pronunciation of his name is “Sharl LeClair”. That can be anglicised to “Charles LeClerk”, which Leclerc himself has said he doesn’t mind, but some commentators prefer to try the more authentic version.', 'Thanks', ""I've never got this.

As I brace myself for a lonely christmas eve I've decided to gift myself a christmas present and I took a full weekend entry to spa 25. 

Is it easy to access with a motorbike ? Where can I park it ? 

Do you guys have recommandations for accommodation ?

Thanks a lot have a nice holiday season","['Some info here: https://www.spagrandprix.com/en/tickets-parking-motorbike .\nI was pretty sure previous years there was a moto parking at Blanchimont as well (red); but it does not seem to be the case anymore (or maybe already sold out).\n\nSince you’re coming by bike, I would suggest staying in an area a little further away, like Maastricht or Aachen, probably will save you quite a bit of money. Please be careful when overtaking traffic when traveling towards the track; there are a lot of frustrated drivers because of the traffic chaos each year.\n\nSee you there!', 'I went there a couple years ago on my motorbike.
