They fell into that by default of their new Mercedes engines when the 2014 regs came in and saved Claire‚Äôs ass, and they kept philosophy since: Make the car stable and fast in a straight line at the expense of cornering and responsiveness. \n\nThis was especially prominent during the dark years between 2018-21 when Monza and Mexico were basically Williams‚Äô only legitimate chance at points barring something crazy happening like Germany 2019. \n\nNow with Dorilton as the owners and James as the TP, the design philosophy is changing with the culture.

In that context, it‚Äôs understandable that cars can suffer from specific things over 10 years period because they never designed a completely new car and always adapted the new rules to the current car.', 'Barcelona is all about aerodynamic efficiency, how much usable high-speed downforce you can produce with the least amount of drag.

What was convincing about it? Like I said, he set the time sheets on fire in FP3 and it is not the first time he has taken pole. Did he really have any doubters here?

One way to look at this is with the presumption that Norris was going to be on pole, that Piastri pipped him at the last minute and that *Autosport* are framing this as ""Norris had pole until Piastri snatched it away from him"". They are a British publication and they have a vested interest in seeing Norris come out on top because their readership is British first and foremost. I say this not to take a sledge at the British press, but simply to point out that Piastri is Australian and *Speedcafe* is an Australian publication. They are just as invested in him as *Autosport* are in Norris. To imply that *Speedcafe* is somehow exaggerating what happened is disingenuous because it is not hard to find the British press exaggerating the results when a British driver comes out on top. If you are critical of *Speedcafe* for running the headline ""Piastri powers to F1 Spanish GP pole"", let me ask you this: if Norris had taken pole, how would you feel about *Autosport* running the headline ""Norris powers to F1 Spanish GP pole""?', ""As an Aussie, it doesn't worry me.
