Lapping '16 very close to each other fighthing"", '*Tension in the Ferrari team*\n\nTranslation:\n\n> **Communication problems between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer Riccardo Adami also made headlines in Monaco. The two don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.**\n\n> In the first few races of the year, the communication problems between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer, Riccardo Adami, could still be attributed to the duo needing to get used to each other. But after their eighth Grand Prix together, the two still don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.\n\n> Minor misunderstandings between drivers and engineers are nothing unusual in Formula 1. In the case of Hamilton and Adami, however, it\'s the tone that makes the difference. Normally, the partner at the pit stop should support the driver and provide clear instructions. At Ferrari, however, misunderstandings and questions arise again and again.\n\n> In the final part of the Monaco race, for example, Hamilton wanted to know if he was still a minute behind the leading four. The answer was no answer: ""Charles is on mediums, the McLarens are on hard tires. They\'re fighting very closely,"" Adami radioed to the driver.\n\n> **The sound makes the music.**\nHamilton reacted audibly annoyed to the useless information: ""You\'re not answering my question. Actually, it doesn\'t matter. I just asked if I was a minute behind."" Only then was Hamilton given the current gap, as requested.\n\n> After the race, a somewhat strange exchange also occurred. Hamilton radioed his engineer on the cool-down lap: ""It wasn\'t the easiest weekend. But we won\'t give up the fight."" He was met with silence, to which Hamilton followed up: ""Are you angry with me, or is something wrong?"" Again, there was no response.\n\n> During his press conference, team principal Frederic Vasseur once again had to answer questions about the somewhat confusing radio messages. The Frenchman attributed the communication problems to the special Monaco layout, where radio communication is only possible in certain sections of the track.\n\n> **Vasseur sees no tensions.**\nFurthermore, Hamilton\'s statements in the cockpit generally shouldn\'t be taken too seriously: ""There\'s no tension just because someone asks a question. He\'s under pressure, he\'s fighting, he\'s driving between the walls ‚Äì and he\'s doing that at 300 km/h. For me, that\'s all totally fine. I spoke to him after the race. He wasn\'t upset at all.""\n\n> But because this wasn\'t the first time Hamilton and Adami had talked past each other this season, frustration is growing among the record-breaking winner\'s fans. Their idol\'s poor results aren\'t helping to calm the situation, of course. The newcomer isn\'t looking for a chance against teammate Charles Leclerc.\n\n> Many fondly remember the times with Peter Bonnington at Mercedes. ""Bono"" and Hamilton formed a well-coordinated and close-knit team. While there were always a few questions about strategy, a certain respect was always expressed in their communication. The same couldn\'t always be said of Hamilton\'s radio messages in the first races of the year.\n\n> **Leclerc happy with new engineer.**\nEven his interactions with Sebastian Vettel and Carlos Sainz, whom Adami had previously coached at Ferrari, didn\'t always run smoothly. As a result, fans on social media are increasingly expressing their desire for Hamilton to be paired with a new man, preferably a British engineer, to avoid language barriers.\n\n> Ferrari demonstrated last year that it is willing to act in this position when necessary. Midway through the season, for the seventh race in Imola, Leclerc was given a new partner at the pit lane: Bryan Bozzi. The Italian replaced Spaniard Xavier Marcos. Since then, there have been clearer statements, something Leclerc repeatedly praises. Perhaps Ferrari should now try something new with Hamilton.', ""When the driver has to ask if the engineer is mad at him during the race, or when the engineer's mistake costs the driver 3 places on the racing grid, yeah, I think Hamilton needs a new engineer"", 'maybe Ferrari should just give the F1 team to their WEC crew?', 'Short answer: si\nLong answer: yes', 'It‚Äôs a relationship I don‚Äôt foresee getting any better.

1kxe5me,Grand Prix Plaza Las Vegas,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxe5me/grand_prix_plaza_las_vegas/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"Quick review of some components of the newly opened Grand Prix Plaza in Las Vegas, for those considering going.

Quickest background.  Netflix era F1 fan, watch every race, follow every social media account I can, etc.  I have a basic G29 steering wheel and pedal setup at home, and have played multiple seasons of all of the recent F1 games, although I have spent more time playing Gran Turismo 7 for the past two years.  Have never driven a proper racing sim setup with motion.

I arrived on a recent weekday morning around 1030am when the Plaza opened.  Talked to the Go Kart track employees for a few minutes about options for races, and decided to book a Mixed Race (~20mph or so) that is geared for all ages for $79.  Comes with two 15 minutes races, consisting of a qualifying session and then a grid start race.  Both sessions rankings are set by fastest lap only, to prevent the race session from being a block fest.  Blocking is easy to do as the track is pretty tight in most places, with a few decent opportunities to go 2 or maybe 3 wide and pass when needed.  Karts have functional DRS, which works by SLOWING the lead car, allowing the trailing car to pass.  Great concept in theory, but maddening when you're the lead car on a fast lap and you're artificially slowed down because someone is behind you.  Karts have functional ERS, which works great, is fun, but was not explained enough to the other drivers in my party who missed using it the entire first 15 minute session.  I used ERS to successfully get pole lap out of 10 drivers.   10 drivers on a grid made for 20 was pretty good, only a few bottlenecks during each session - the track workers are pretty good with telling people to move over, etc.   Overall, I enjoyed it for the price, my party members who are not F1 fans thought it was a blast, and I would do it again at the mixed race level or the nightly elite races which are 30 mph and I'm sure way more fun (I would have done the 30 mph race but did not have time in my schedule).

The arcade simulators was my most anticipated component of the event, as I'm an avid F1 game racer with a basic setup and hadn't ever used a Sim.  Cost is $40 for 9 time trial laps around the Vegas circuit.   The chair and wheel and pedal all seem to be pretty mid to high level in quality, but the game engine is a major fucking letdown.  All of the driver assists are on, and there is no way to turn them off.  The camera is halo, and can not be changed to cockpit for full immersion.  The game steers, brakes, and shifts for you around the circuit even if you try to override the shifts, or brake slightly earlier than the settings.  This setting is helpful for average tourists, but for anyone who has ever spent any time playing the F1 game or any other racing game, it is not worth the money.  If anyone from F1 or the GPP is reading this, theres got to be a way to change the settings for amateur or frequent players of racing games - your new F1 arcades across the world and this GPP will not bring in repeat customers otherwise.  As someone who loves F1 and racing games, I would not ever spend money on their Sim racing games again unless this was changed.  Just my $0.02.

There's a small store, restaurant, and museum on the second floor of the paddock.  I skipped the museum due to time, but walked into the empty restaurant at the northern end of the paddock  building at 11am just to see it and the menu.  Menu looked good and i would definitely try it once.  Restaurant decor was a bit sparse, but the views over T1 were very cool.  To get to the restaurant, you walk the entire length of the paddock and you can walk the exterior balcony and oversee the entire front stretch, which is very cool.  I had a drink at the bar near the store, which was high quality and around $21 (mid range price for Vegas cocktails).  Did not buy anything at the store, but they had a good selection and prices seemed cheaper than on race day (I'm not really a merch guy).

Overall, Go Karts were great, Sims were bad, restaurant incomplete but outlook positive, bar was good, atmosphere and access for a walk in patron were great.","['tbh sounds like a tourist trap and something to avoid as an F1 fan.\n\nKarting sounds very expensive and gimmicky and any local kart track would give a better experience.

1kxo32d,Madrid track layout,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxo32d/madrid_track_layout/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"So I just saw a layout of the 2026 Spanish Grand Prix in Madrid and it‚Äôs getting a lot of hate for the amount of turns and comments about it being yet another track that isn‚Äôt conducive to overtakes. I‚Äôve also heard grumbling of how many of the tracks on the current schedule (see Monaco) are similar in difficulty to perform overtakes. 

My question is: what aspect of track design lends to more overtakes? And why are many of these circuits being built this way? Is it more of an issue with the design or is it just how large the modern F1 car is, or a mix of both?

Imola is difficult because it's a lot of medium speed corners with no straights long enough to create overlap. Monaco is difficult because it's narrow and there's basically no straights to create braking events big enough to pass. \n\nJapan was difficult because the dirty air made it hard to be close enough at the beginning of the long straights, and turn 1 isn't a big enough braking event to allow for overtakes.

This is probably fair- Haas had some dismal years from Bad Santa to Mazepin, and Williams during Claire's last years was in a sorry state.  

However, looking at Sauber's F1 results since *2008*, when they placed 3rd in the WCC, they've been quietly and consistently bad. Sauber has managed to place higher than 7th in only three seasons: 

2009: 6th 

2012: 6th 

2022: 6th  

Unlike both Williams and Haas, which are on an upward trajectory, Sauber seems to only be getting worse. So where is the uproar over their poor performance? Does Sauber not have a dedicated fanbase like the other teams?  

Wondering if some real F1 veterans can enlighten me on this one. 

Thanks!","['They are in a holding pattern until being Audi branded. They expected to be nowhere.\xa0', ""Sauber have always been underdogs (with the exception of when they were owned by BMW).

As far as HAAS goes, they‚Äôve had too many seasons where they seemed incompetent (2021 comes to mind) and have had their fair share of drama.\n\nAs for Sauber, they‚Äôve always been an underdog team with lower funding and fewer fans, so of course lower expectations.

When Yuki was in VCARB, he had actual guts. He\'d push the car to it\'s limit and end up pulling some sick results or floundering and DNF-ing. But it made him look like a driver with skill and potential; just one who took unreasonable risks sometimes.

The upgrades are working for Max, but again we\'re going through the same cycle every single RB second seat except Daniel has suffered. \n\nBut I guess I\'d expect to at least see some of the same driving mentality Yuki had in AT/VCARB from the start. But it\'s like he\'s just a completely different driver. He doesn\'t push the car in qualifying at all and plays it incredibly safe; not to Lawson\'s level, but not much better. We get into a race, and he takes 0 chances at overtakes. He loses out on straights to Aston Martin and Haas in a car we at least know is faster than those two. Monaco wasn\'t his fault at all really within the race, it was just his Q2 times that needed to be better. Buta part from that, again I just feel I\'m watching a different driver. He\'s not even visibly trying to defend. The confidence in the car is NOT there, even though we\'ve seen moments where he HAS kept up, to some degree, with Max. FP in Monaco, Yuki and Max were pretty much matched on medium tyres.\n\nHe really feels like he\'s just cloned Checo from mid-late 2024. Which I guess is indicative of the car being an ass to drive, which we all know already. And if I get a reply on here it\'s gonna be ""he\'s just a mediocre driver."" But even if that turns out to be true by the time his career\'s over; it doesn\'t feel like we\'re seeing him drive how he has before at the moment. It\'s taking too long for him to get used to the car, and personally I\'m just hoping something clicks soon and he at least starts putting in some early-to-mid Checo era performances. He\'s a capable driver in a rough spot right now, and I\'m hoping he turns it around.']",3,53,0.57,3,84,84,0,0,0.0,0

I'm a long time Formula 1 fan, however I've never been to a race in person.

I'm from Argentina and I know that Interlagos is a logistical nightmare to visit (both the circuit and Sao Pablo are famously uncomfortable places to visit).

Therefore, I was thinking in going to some Middle Eastern circuit. 
I know that the experience in person can vary significantly from watching the race on site from the TV. So, anyone has any recommendation on which of those gives you a more enjoyable experience?

Many thanks in advance.","['Bahrain is one of the best circuits on the Calendar in general and the best in Middle east. Also tickets to F1 are relatively cheap.', 'Bahrain is one of the best races of the season imo', 'Qatar is super easy to get to as a tourist, take the metro to Lusail and a free bus to the circuit. Tickets are pretty cheap too. Qatar is weird, I\'ve certainly enjoyed going there and it\'s good from a food and ""cultural"". perspective but if you want something more touristy it\'s probably not for you. But for families it\'s great, especially around December. When the race was in October that year forget it though. The facilities have expanded quite a lot since the COVID race and it\'s more developed as an ""experience"". The downside is that tickets used to be super cheap and close but overall it\'s still not bad.\n\n\nBahrain is a little more awkward but not too much so, again there\'s shuttles from Manama Hotels to the track and although it can be a little awkward it\'s overall fine. The way the standards are set up it\'s a bit of a trek if you\'re not on the main straight and you have to go through a few extra security gates so if you want to ""pop down"" to the fan zone and you\'re not at the main GS it\'s a bit annoying.
