also alain prost is the only driver in the history of f1 to beat 5 different champs in equal cars (Niki lauda - Kiki rosberg - Ayrton senna - Nigel mansell - Damon hill).  
I understand why people say that senna was better, because senna was actually way faster than alain prost in qualy pace and race pace, but in the 80s raw speed wasn't as important as it is now. tyre management, fuel management, strategy and many other things that was more important back then compared to now, and alain prost was the absolute best at most of these things which made him a 4 time world champion and one of the greatest ever, if not the greatest.

So Prost pretty much always went into the race with the “hardest driver to overtake” (according to Mansell) ahead of him, and despite that, Prost never lost to him on total points scored over the season. This is because of the difference in philosophies: Senna was raw speed while Prost was very intelligent and always prioritised a setup that would grant him better tyre management and fuel consumption.

1p1csr9,Qualifying theory similar to reverse Grid,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p1csr9/qualifying_theory_similar_to_reverse_grid/,2025-11-19, Discussion,"So, I've had a theory pop into my head and have worked on it a little with the help of Chat GPT.

It came about after Max put in his Pole lap at COTA with 1 run in Q3 waiting for track evolution, he came out, did an incredible lap and that was it.

My idea is basically, that the top 5 in Q1 would lock in the first 5 positions and then end there running. Q2 would be the next five and Q3 would be the rest of the grid 11-20.

A major part of this process would be to allow the smaller and slower teams/drivers a little more time on the track, and also mean the top dogs would have to come in swinging straight out of the gate. With the potential for a rookie to put in a banger of a lap from the get go and start from a better position, intentionally shaking up the starting grid, as we've seen from Max and Brazil the last 2 years starting from the back isn't necessarily the end of the race. (Although I am very aware that not everyone can do what Max can).

My main question is, I am probably wrong in the approach, so why would it be so bad?","[""Tires. You've completely disregarded tire allocation and wear.\n\nSorry...You AND ChatGPT disregarded tires."", ""So you immediately know who's on pole?\n\nWho's watching to the end of the session, to see who fills the back of the grid? \n\nThis is the antithesis of a climactic qualifying."", 'Why would anyone keep watching once pole is decided?\xa0', 'If the top 5 in Q1 have their positions guaranteed, why would anyone run Q2 and Q3? Why waste the tires, why put wear on the parts, when there is no benefit, even if they do a faster lap than the top 5 Q1 guys?', 'Defining the top positions in the first part of qualifying is not good for tv ratings.\n\nCurrent format has worked well for many years. It has a few quirks, accidents causing red flags, in some circuits congested final laps.', 'I like this in theory. To get pole you just show up and nail the fastest last while navigating traffic with little track time and no track evolution. But as others have said there are problems:\n\nThe way things are now with tire allocation, your pole sitter and top 5 would have extra tires available for the race. Meanwhile the person who tops Q3 would have used all his available softs just to get P11 and then everyone in front of him has extra sets for the race and will have every strategy available to them, making it even harder for that last group to make up ground.   \n\nMy other problem is more of a sporting one. Usually quali times drop right to the very end, with the last group setting the fastest times of the session due to track evolution, driver confidence and less traffic. Your proposed structure would more than likely lead to the pole sitter not setting the fastest lap in qualifying. Rather, the person in P11 (and probably a few more) would be faster than those out in Q1. \n\nThat being said I kinda would like something like this, just to change up the format a bit. I suggest doing this for sprint quali at first, especially since they already kind of control tire allocation. Just have ""Sprint Qualifying Tires"" that are use it or lose it. The tires are for qualifying only and don\'t come out of team allocations. Due to the shorter sprint race distance the strategy doesn\'t change that much anyways. And as far as my second issue with this goes, I don\'t think many fans (and possibly drivers too) would care if the sprint pole wasn\'t necessarily the fastest lap set. \n\nI feel like they could do something like this for the sprint races and actually make them fun and exciting, not just previews of what we\'re about to see on Sunday. Honestly they kinda ruin the GP imo.', 'Nah, chat gpt usually knows the difference between there, their and they’re', 'Agreed. \xa0That is a well-intentioned but poorly thought out, terrible idea.', 'Because you’d rather start 6th than 20th?', ""This is what I was thinking. The average viewer wants to see who takes pole, not so much who qualifies outside the top 10. If pole is set within the first 15 minutes of qualifying a lot of people are not going to continue watching the session and that's going to affect TV ad revenue.""]",0,22,0.23,0,138,138,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
