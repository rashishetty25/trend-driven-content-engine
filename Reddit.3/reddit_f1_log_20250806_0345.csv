1mibr2x,Is Bortoleto the best rookie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mibr2x/is_bortoleto_the_best_rookie/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"In my opinion, what he’s been doing in a Sauber shows much more talent than all the other rookies this year. Since the start of the season, I already thought the best ones would be him—because he won the Formula 3 and Formula 2 titles in his rookie seasons—and Antonelli. However, Antonelli has been showing himself to be far inferior to his teammate. I believe it’s due to the pressure of starting in a big team like Mercedes, but to me, that makes Bortoleto the best rookie. That said, welcome back, Ayrton Senna.","['I think we’ll be watching Bortoleto in F1 for many years to come.\n\nHadjar has also been extremely impressive!', 'He could be. Hadjar started off strong.

1miae1n,Bunch of facts about both Championships while coming into Summer break,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1miae1n/bunch_of_facts_about_both_championships_while/,2025-08-05, Statistics,"There is 274 points left in 2025 World Drivers' Championship (10 Grand Prix's and 3 Spirnts)

This means that Oliver Bearman, Franco Colapinto and Jack Doohan are officialy out of contention for this title.

Yuki Tsunoda is last driver eligible for the Championship as he currently has 10 points, while Oscar Piastri has 284, Tsunoda would win because he would have 10 wins compared to Piastri's 6 so far.

Oscar Piastri will not Max Verstappen's 2023 record of 575 points scored by a single driver as he can only get to 558 points if he would be flawless after the break.

Now some facts about World Constructor's Championship.

475 is the most points a team can get from last 10 Race Weekends.

This means that bottom 6 cannot win this year as Williams could only get to 545 points, which is 14 less than McLaren's current tally.

McLaren can miss out on only 34 points until the season ends if they want to be first team to get 1000 points, if they win it all they will earn 1034 in a single season.

This means they can only lose 3 races and all 3 sprints as they would lose 33 points that way.

The earliest possible race in which McLaren can win Constructor Championship is...

Azerbeijan

If McLaren has 3 more 1-2s and Ferrari would finish 3-4 that would put McLaren at 688 points and Ferrari at 341 (347 points gap). In remaining 7 Race Weeks there would be 346 ! points left so Ferrari could finish just 1 point behind McLaren.

In Q3, P1 - P6 only separated by 0.126s, assuming the ""lower rider height"" gains them 2 tenths, Leclerc on paper should only qualified P6 behind both Aston Martin, which means he will be stucked behind Alonso. If it's 3-4 tenths difference, Leclerc will qualify P8 which makes it worse. (Even if it's only 1 tenth gain, he qualifies P4, which he will eventually finish P4, exactly the same.)

From what we saw how the race goes, it's impossible to overtake Alonso if you are not McLaren, especially if Leclerc doesn't have that ""2-tenth"" advantage by lowering ride height. Given Ferrari's race strategy, they will probably choose a 2-stop behind the DRS train like Max did and get somewhere below P8 or even out of the points.

But with this ""plank gambling"", they got P4 eventually, has a shot to go for podium or even win (if there are some SC or VSC to keep the plank healthy so that they don't need more tyre pressure in the final stint).

""Hungaroring is just Monaco without walls."" Yes, the gambling didn't pay off this time because there is no SC / VSC, but they lost nothing (in terms of race result) and has everything to gain potentially by doing so. That's how teams play the rule if they don't have the best car.

1mi8moa,Driving Styles Compared: Hamilton’s Rear vs Max’s Front Bias,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mi8moa/driving_styles_compared_hamiltons_rear_vs_maxs/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"Everyone keeps talking about how Max Verstappen prefer a very strong front end so extreme that most of his teammates fail to extract competitive performance of the same car.

Lewis Hamilton is on the opposite side preferring a stable rear, but how does it actually look like?

From the moment Lewis Hamilton started karting, his father would stand next to the track and move further where his rivals would typically brake forcing Lewis to [mold his style of late braking](https://youtu.be/MOtvpi1aM-I).

Lewis tries to brake as late as possible often braking and turning at the same time and is also aggressive at corner entry. This usually results in the rear sliding mid corner and Lewis has to open up his steering to correct.
You can see this style clearly on his older onboard with the McLaren at [Turn 2](https://youtu.be/FJQ4QyJNuA8?t=22), and [Turn 13](https://youtu.be/FJQ4QyJNuA8?t=72).

Verstappen on the other hand prefers a very strong front end. Verstappen is not a late braker like Hamilton and he is conservative on corner entry. He prefers to do most of the car rotation mid corner [1](https://youtu.be/uvlHBDD2R2M?t=19), [2](https://youtu.be/uvlHBDD2R2M?t=64).

I've seen him popping up on social feeds and I'm not sure I agree with a lot of what he says. He's often talking about idealised lines and being off them as a negative, despite as far as I can tell he's never actually driven anything close to an F1 car?

Max has the adaptability to mould his style to what is required."", ""I'd love to see how Verstappen goes in a Rally1 car since he likes these oversteery setups.

1mihshx,Are you a driver fan or a team fan first in F1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mihshx/are_you_a_driver_fan_or_a_team_fan_first_in_f1/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"As someone who’s relatively new to Formula 1, I’ve been thinking a lot about whether I’m more of a driver fan or a team fan, and I’ve realized I’m definitely a driver first fan.

It was actually Lando Norris who pulled me into the sport. His social media presence, humor, and down-to-earth vibe really stood out to me and made F1 feel more accessible. From watching clips of him joking around with other drivers to getting a glimpse into his personality off the track, I got curious about the actual races, and now I’m completely hooked. I’ve been diving deep into past seasons, race highlights, team rivalries, and everything in between.

That said, I’ve always had a soft spot for Ferrari too. Growing up in the U.S., my exposure to F1 was limited, but I still knew about Michael Schumacher. He was a legend, and as someone with German heritage, I always admired him. Most of my motorsports background comes from watching NASCAR as a kid, since that was way more mainstream here in the States, but Schumacher and Ferrari still managed to break through that and grab my attention.

So now I find myself rooting for Lando first, but also hoping Ferrari can get back to being dominant. If Lando ever switches teams, I’d follow him without question. But there’s still that nostalgic pull toward Ferrari that keeps them as a secondary favorite for me.

Curious how others feel about this. Are you more of a driver fan or a team fan? And what originally pulled you into F1?","['Ferrari but I care a bit more about how Charles finishes but not so one sided ike 60/40 maybe', 'Driver first (Alonso)', 'Driver first (Sainz)', ""I'm just an F1 fan, moreso than any particular team or driver. For me, it's not even really about who wins, it's about the midfield battle. Watching the ups and downs throughout the season. Always keeping an attentive eye to the points bubble during a race. \n\nTo me, those guys pushing it to the absolute limit to scrap for any possible points is the essence of Formula 1"", 'Driver first', ""Team first for me (Ferrari). But due to my team, I have a lot of room to pull for other teams/drivers, depending on the storyline of the season lol\n\nI was pulling for Max when he was challenging the Mercedes domination, I was pulling for Lando when he was challening the Max domination, and now I'm liking the inter-Mclaren competition going on.

But I'd say that has had an influence on me rooting for McLaren and Lando as well.\n\nHow much of an influence, I'm not sure.

1mhyrn9,How do this season's constructors compare now that we're half way through?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mhyrn9/how_do_this_seasons_constructors_compare_now_that/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"Obviously McLaren have the best car this year, but it seems so hard to judge outside of that. The Aston Martin seemed like a tractor and then suddenly had both in the top 7. The Red Bull appears to (have) been capable of winning races for the first third of the season, while the second car can't get inside the top 15. The Merc also seemed competitive for the first third of the season.

The RB has been consistently able to be just inside the top 10 with three different drivers. The Sauber is a tractor that both of its driver's have been able to drive into the top 6. The Ferrari seems all over the show, the only vehicle that seems consistently shit is the Alpine, but even then Gasly has had it inside the top 10 a few times. 

So, given all that, how are we ranking them? I guess taking an average across the first half of the season I'd say:

1. McLaren 

2. Mercedes? This felt like an easy pick up until the last three races

3. Ferrari? Again, so all-over the place that it's hard to assess this car

4. Red Bull - It has been competitive at times in the hands of a generational talent, but worst on the grid while Yuki/LL have been piloting

5. Aston Martin - Stroll has been in and out of the points all season in the AM, and lately Alonso has been accumulating even more points than Stroll in it. Hungary in particular it was strong

6. Racing Bull - Doesn't have the pace to compete at the top, but is reliable and has been consistently in the 8-12 placings

7. Williams? - Has shown the ability to have pace, but has also been inconsistent despite having two very good drivers

8. Sauber? - Everyone labels it a tractor, but it has been on the podium and has scored points under both drivers

9. Haas - Seems harsh as it has scored points under both drivers hands too

10. Alpine - Gasly has regularly taken it into the points, but both second drivers have struggled to drive it out of the bottom quarter.

  
What are your feelings/rankings so far, I'm interested to see and have something to talk about while I wait for the Netherlands :)","['Tie between Mercedes and Ferrari as there have been races where one has been clearly better than the other.\n\nAnd I would order the middle and lower class of the grid like this: Williams, Aston Martin, Sauber, Haas, Racing Bulls & Alpine', 'Consistently, RB over Aston Martin', 'All teams are very close together overall, especially compared to the past. \n\nWhen it was normal that we saw some cars lapped multiple times and most cars lapped at least once, tier list of the constructors was easy. \n\nNow we have a double situation:\n\nAll teams are relatively close together, we have qualifyings where almost all cars are within 1s during Q1. And we super sensitive tyres that change their performance with just a change of the ambient temperature by few degrees kelvin. \n\nSuddenly Mercedes is the fastest car in Canada, only to go for a spell of mediocre results for Russell and terrible results for Antonelli. Suddenly the Williams finds itself nowhere, only to be somewhere the next race. The drives to P19 and starts from the pitlane only to start P5 next race. \n\nIn the past these up and downs of 0.5s of lap time due to a fitting track did make you jump like 2 or 4 positions maximum. Now you jump halve the field. Hitting the tyres gives you another 0.5s compared to teams that miss it. \n\nMy current order is: McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull, racing bulls, sauber, Williams, Aston, Haas and Alpine. \n\nThe order 10 races ago might be quite different. With Aston even worse, Williams P5, Sauber worse and a change between Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull', 'The only certains things are Mclaren will finish P1 and Alpine P10 (only team with no upgrades since Barcelona and no upgrades scheduled for the rest of the season, 100% focusing on 2026).', 'As we\'ve seen several times this season, these cars are one upgrade from gaining or dropping several places in the pecking order. And the track can make a massive difference. Several teams have been at the back of the grid one week then deep in the points the next. So to call any of them ""tractors"" or ""shitboxes"" is in my opinion both dumb and also disrespectful. The field is so tight this year and it\'s hard to know which teams will swing which way, which is part of why this season is great. 1st is wrapped up. There\'s pretty much a 2-way battle for 2nd with 4th almost guaranteed. But behind them it\'s anyone\'s game.', 'The Ranking between merc Ferrari and rbr is really Hard because they bassically had comparable results. \n\nI would say that you can, make an Argument for almost every Order between them.', 'Kick Sauber have looked significantly improved since there last upgrades a couple races ago', ""I think Mercedes has been better than Ferrari, but Antonelli has let them down on the score board. Plus Monaco was a big swing vs Ferrari.\n\nHard to rate the VCARB. Been in Q3 at every round with at least 1 driver, but they're both rookies. I think it's a better car than the Williams though.\n\nAston Martin are really inconsistent and some terrible luck for Alonso has lowered their score a bit. Overall a better car than the Sauber, Haas and Alpine group. AM are maybe equal with VCARB and Williams, ignoring points.\n\nSauber are a surprise after their updates. Potentially as good as the Aston Martin now, which will make it interesting against them going forward. And will be a headache for the 2nd driver in the top 4."", ""I personally believe that a car is only as good as its fastest driver. With that in mind, here’s how I’d rank the teams based on overall pace in the first half of the season:\n\nMcLaren – No notes. \n\nMercedes – It’s been pretty tight between them and Red Bull. They’ve both taken turns being the second or third fastest team, occasionally slipping to fourth if Ferrari shows up. But on average, I’d give Merc the edge.\n\nRed Bull – Pretty much the same story as Merc. I know there’s probably a case for putting them fourth and I get that. I think that argument mainly comes from the gap between Max and Yuki. But like I said earlier, I’m judging based on what the car is capable of, so I’m giving weight to the fastest driver.\n\nFerrari – Similar vibes. Flashes of performance, but just not consistent enough to crack the top three. They've been better in the last couple of races though. So, that could very well change.\n\nWilliams – Reliability’s been a pain, but in terms of raw pace, I think they’ve been ahead of the rest below them.\n\nRacing Bulls – Quietly solid. They've been around the points more often than not, and haven’t had the wild ups and downs that Haas or Sauber have.\n\nAston Martin – They started the season off terribly, but they’ve finally begun to find some form. Curious to see if they keep climbing.\n\nHaas – Bit of a toss-up between them and Sauber, could go either way.\n\nSauber – They’re picking up lately, which is nice to see. Could easily jump a spot or two if they keep it up.\n\nAlpine – Yeah... no comment."", 'I think the construtors points table is a pretty good indicator of where everyone is. The only real development is that it looks like the Sauber has improved a lot, so they can expect to move up if no one else does development']",0,20,0.38,0,91,91,0,0,-0.02999999999999997,0
