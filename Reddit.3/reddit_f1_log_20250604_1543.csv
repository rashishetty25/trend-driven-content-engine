The reason: How much revolutionary their brakes are. Tire conservation and the capability of keeping them on the right temperature window will still be key and this is not changing with the new regs. 

We have seen that when the temps are cooler they don‚Äôt dominate as much, but in so many circuits the temps are hard to control and they do it so much better than the rest. If other teams don‚Äôt find out how to replicate that technology, it‚Äôs going to take a much, much faster car to offset that advantage.
