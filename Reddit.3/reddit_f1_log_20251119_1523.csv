Any time they get grumpy, it's a little bit actually towards me and Andrea because we're trying to be fair and balanced. And I think the fact that they've both been a little bit grumpy at times with us actually tells you things have been fair and balanced because we're trying to make sure they race clean, and they are.  
  
All the incidents that they've had, which isn't that many, have all just been, at the end of the day, racing incidents. But we want to make sure the championship's decided on the track and not through that. I think we're lucky that we have the two drivers that we have.  
  
I'm not sure that Andrea and I and the team would be able to manage other drivers the way we can Oscar and Lando. So I think a lot of credit is due to just who they are as individuals.
