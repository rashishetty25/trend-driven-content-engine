Then he rejoins the festivities. First, he says: ‚ÄúCould anyone else become champion in this car? I would say: I wish them good luck.‚Äù\n\nThere are emotions, there is relief and, above all, Max Verstappen is happy that it's over. At least, that with two races to go he has secured his fourth championship in a row. An incredible achievement. Especially when you consider that the Red Bull driver did not have the best material for months. He himself estimates that he has not had the fastest car for seventy percent of this season. Still, things are now decided. ‚ÄúI had thought we would have to fight until the last moment, but then luckily the rain came in Brazil. That worked out pretty well,‚Äù Verstappen said, referring to his fabulous victory at Interlagos, which indirectly meant the knockout for rival Lando Norris.\n\n**Proving them wrong**\n\nThe intermediate score, more than three and a half hours after he crossed the finish line in Las Vegas? ‚ÄúI've had four beers now and two gin tonics,‚Äù said Verstappen, now holding a can of Red Bull. ‚ÄúMost of all, I'm pretty relieved. The race wasn't great, but actually a little better than expected. It's nice that it's done now and we can go into the final races in Qatar and Abu Dhabi reasonably relaxed. There I still want to get some nice results.‚Äù By then he has already wittily taken revenge on McLaren boss Zak Brown, by rubbing his nose in his face that he can also become world champion in a non-dominant car. Referring to earlier statements by the American about Verstappen's titles in 2022 and 2023. ‚ÄúSuch things only motivate me. **If people are critical and think that I can only win in the best car, I prove them wrong. If I don't get credit for this now, I don't know what else I can do. Whether I would have become champion in the McLaren? Yes! And much sooner too. In 2021 in another car (the Mercedes, ed.) I would have taken the title as well. In 2022 it would have become more difficult, because Ferrari was perhaps a little too fragile then. And last year? Well, that would have been a bit trickier.‚Äù**\n\n**Not just shouting around**\n\nA roar of laughter followed, as Verstappen and Red Bull gave the concept of dominance a whole new dimension last season. At the beginning of this year, that's where things seemed to be heading as far as 2024 is concerned, too. But since early May, the panels have shifted considerably. The question is legitimate whether anyone else could have become champion in the RB20. Especially if you compare Verstappen's performance to that of teammate Sergio P√©rez. ‚ÄúWhether it could have been? We're in Vegas, so you can maybe bet on that. I would say I wish them good luck.‚Äù Verstappen acknowledges that he is happy with how he has handled disappointments this year. Intrigues were plentiful at Red Bull, both on and off the track. As recently as early September in Monza, he said that a world title was no longer realistic. ‚ÄúWe had quite a difficult time after a very good start. I am quite proud of how we got through that as a team. As a person it's important to stay calm and not just shout around that it all sucks. I wouldn't have been as good at that a few years ago. You learn that over the years, too. And a few championships help put it into perspective more easily.‚Äù\n\n**Never been desperate**\n\nIn Las Vegas, Verstappen stayed ahead of both McLaren drivers quite easily. Mercedes (George Russell won) and Ferrari had it better than Red Bull, though. It will be interesting next week in Qatar to see how the proportions are then. At that circuit, McLaren should normally come out well, as should Red Bull. ‚ÄúAnd we have to keep a close eye on everything...,‚Äù Verstappen is referring to the possible gimmicks McLaren might have used, at least according to Red Bull. ‚ÄúI'm very proud of this season, though. I never despaired, but we had a lot of conversations - including at the factory in Milton Keynes - about what we could do better. A lot has happened and it has been a tough year.‚Äù Now he stands at four world titles, as many as Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel. And one more than, among others, his ‚Äúfather-in-law‚Äù Nelson Piquet. ‚ÄúBut the first time I met him I had nothing at all... Now, fortunately, that's a different story. He also became champion in Las Vegas in 1981. He sure knows how to party here.

Alain Prost really likes Max Verstappen and has never been reluctant to speak highly of the Dutch driver for L'√âquipe. The French world champion finally agreed to give us his analysis of his 27-year-old counterpart last Sunday. Thirty minutes of Zoom interview that demonstrate the esteem, even admiration, of the 69-year-old former driver for Verstappen.\n\n**Having Verstappen as a neighbor on the prize list. Does that mean anything to you?**\n\n>Yes, sincerely. I am pleased to be in such good company. Because there are only three of us with four titles, but I remember when Michael joined me and when Lewis came through. I will not forget that Fangio was the first driver to win four crowns (the Argentinian champion was crowned a fifth time). All the same, we're among a handful of names who, without sounding presumptuous (he reflects), are out of the ordinary. We're part of history. To be a four-time world champion is a kind of pride. And Max, looking back on his career, can be proud of it. He hasn't stolen any of his crowns. You can have a bit of luck, like me in 1986, but you have to know how to provoke it and then seize it. Max is not missing anything. I remember that in 2016 during his first victory I was commentating for Canal and I promised him a bright future. He didn't disappoint me. What he's already achieved is really impressive. Verstappen is clearly unique. He is not just anyone, whether it's his personality, his character or his commitment. You can love him or hate him, but he certainly doesn't leave you indifferent. Like many great champions, he's atypical.\n\n**This crown, do you think it was the hardest for him to win?**\n\n>Only he can say. I don't know what his car was really worth. (He reflects.) And then we mustn't forget that highly controversial title in 2021. It's still very difficult to have an objective analysis. Frankly, both of them (Hamilton and Verstappen) deserved the title for the whole season. It was Max who won it in the conditions we all know. It was his first crown, and once again he went out and won it. It's always difficult to win your first crown. In fact, I remember very well what I said that evening in Abu Dhabi: from now on we'll see the real Verstappen. And we've seen him since then (he smiles). He's freed himself. He's erased his little mistakes and his impatience. He's become very, very strong. Coming back to this year, he's had to fight hard and I think he's shown some very fine things. A lot of confidence, a lot of serenity. Even when he complains, but he has always done it, he did it with less annoyance. That's the mark of a more accomplished champion.\n\n**You describe an extraordinary champion. Does he have any weaknesses?**\n\n>At the moment, it's hard to find any. I don't know what he'll do in the future, but even in terms of communication, with all the rumours with Mercedes and the worries with Red Bull, I've found him to be very solid‚Ä¶ He's good on all terrains.

While in F1 feeder series has much fewer races, a different qualification format, and not racing many tracks, I understand that money is a big problem due to logistics but many new f1 drivers are not that good because of the difference I think. ","['Most of the recent rookies have been decent. Colapinto, Piastri, and Lawson all seem to be doing fine.\n\nThe issue seems to be that there‚Äôs not as much funding for juniors under the academy structure. Red Bull used to fully fund a lot of their juniors so cutting them when they did poorly made sense because they were an expenditure. Raising up Leclerc was a cost to Ferrari as well, same with Russell with Mercedes.\n\n\nBut now sponsorship and finances are huge even in junior categories, so we get a lot of these sponsors driven guys being able to fund 3+ mediocre seasons. Teams have huge junior academies where the drivers are paying them to be associated, not the academy funding the driver. The weeding out of the less talented yet wealthy ones is lessened.', 'Money? The gap F3 F2 to F1 is mega, Moto not so much so everything is more relative and connected. I would think that‚Äôs the only reason', 'The big difference is that Moto3 and Moto2 have become ""junior categories"" only quite recently and that too not even on paper. Moto3 and 2 are their own World Championships and riders can continue in the series after winning one (in the past there have been riders who specialised riding 125/250/350cc and never stepped up to 500/MotoGP).  \n\nF2/GP2, F3/GP3, F3000, etc. have all been explicitly feeder categories for Formula 1 for decades now - they\'re not their own world championship series and their races are not Grands Prix. The current F2 is only related in name to the original Formula 2 which died in the 1980s. So the aim is there to throw these young drivers into a multitude of situations and see how they do to filter them for F1, and not have them fight for the title really. \n\nThis is why Johann Zarco is already a 2 time World Champion (having defended his Moto2 title) but George Russell is not despite winning F2 and had to immediately leave the series.  \n\nFinally it seems like there\'s also more support from Dorna to treat them as full series and also offers a path for private customer teams to start in Moto3 and then move upwards, like VR46.', ""The budget jump from F2 to F1 is close to infinite. There's a balance to achieve F2 has to be cheaper so a lot of drivers can have an opportunity, but real F1 cars are really expensive (they are almost custom made for every type of race).\n\nF2 is supposedly a spec series with all drivers having the same engine, same chassis, etc. Some teams have better budgets, and can hire better engineers, better mechanics, they have better setups, etc.\n\nF2 is an independent business from F1. \n\nEverything is money at the end."", 'I think your underestimating the differences between Moto3, Moto2 and MotoGP.

There are twenty-four Grands Prix and twenty-five has been given as the largest possible number that it could handle. This effectively means that there is a race every other week. It places enormous strain on the teams who are pretty much at the point where they need to rotate staff through races to give them time to recuperate. Formula 2 has fourteen rounds and Formula 3 has eight, which are much more manageable numbers. This is especially the case considering that in 2025, every team in Formula 2 will also be competing in Formula 3. Which means that for the eight rounds where both series race -- Melbourne, Bahrain, Imola, Monaco, Barcelona, the Red Bull Ring, Silverstone, Spa, the Hungaroring and Monza -- everyone in those teams will be pulling double-duty as they have to prepare and field five cars.', 'Firstly, Moto3 and Moto2 are not feeder series like F2 and F3. In recent years they have been made to look like that but in reality are world championship in their own right. For example not many say Marc Marquez is a 6 time world champion or Rossi a 7 time world champion. They add the feeder series too if you want to call it that .So they are at 8 and 9 respectively. Now in recent years their has been a criticism regarding Moto2 class as it has discrepancy from motogp like F2 has to some extent. People say 250cc bikes which were replaced by the current moto2 bikes were a good intermediate category. Another thing with logistics is the garage space, space in paddock required to run F2 race at every event is much more than fitting moto2 and moto3 machinery', 'Rookie F1 drivers struggle more nowadays because of limited testing time. F1 used to have unlimited testing, and rookies would be able to spend weeks on end behind an F1 car‚Äôs wheel, before the season started. But nowadays the amount of testing one team can get in is heavily restricted to promote an even playing field, so rookies get very little time behind the wheel, before they start their first season.\n\nThe rookies who struggle the least are usually the ones who got the most out of testing. Piastri rarely had huge errors or crashes as a rookie, and he had a bunch of testing with Alpine and then with McLaren.', 'Team budget is the big difference. Run a Moto3-2-Gp team cost way less than F3-F2-F1.  \nMotoGp client team cost around 10-15mil‚Ç¨, constructors team spend around 40-60mil‚Ç¨.  \nF2 team spend between 5-10 mil$ for a ""short"" season.\n\nKeep in mind that move motorbikes is way easier (cause they\'re smaller) and cheaper than move cars']",22,20,0.75,22,19,19,2,2,-0.010000000000000009,2

I have no problem with Jenson Button, he is great, but whatever misfit was alongside him he did not ask a single good question. (can anyone educate me where he raced in?).

Before this the drivers where moved by cars to the podium, why didnt the cars just park at the strip, or was this a problem with the track invasion? It just took way to long to get the drivers back to the Strip, it was boring.

  
Also the podium looked like it was on top Aarav's Shed (the Shed) there seemed to be no atmosphere at all, also there was no cooldown room, at least the trophee looked nice. The gimmic of the drivers being lifted up onto the podium was not impressive at all.

  
The race itself also has a lot of problems, from it being way to extravagant to the fact that the track looks like a pig upside down.
