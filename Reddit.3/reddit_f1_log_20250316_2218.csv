I was sitting in the grandstand at the final corner, just one corner after where Lando and Oscar went off and only about 100 metres away, and there were barely even a couple drops of rain when they went off, and it took probably about 2 more minutes before it started to properly rain. The rain that took Lando and Oscar off was extremely localised.', '**Q: Alright, very well done to you. Max, let\'s come to you now. You ran Lando very close at the end. What were you thinking? Just one more lap?**\n\nMV: No, not so much, to be honest. I just tried my best, tried to be close, tried to put a bit of pressure on, but it\'s very hard to pass around here. There was only one line. Even if I had gotten a run into whatever, Turn 9, you have to go onto the wet part, so you can\'t really do a lot. But at least it was close. It looked good on TV.\n \n**Q: Can we talk a lot more about the rain? Tell us about the call to stay out one more lap?**\n\nMV: Two more laps! We were on the Medium, and of course, you never know how that\'s going to work out. But I thought it was quite a sensible call with 15, 16, or 20 laps to go when the Safety Car came out. Then, of course, it started to rain. I saw them go off in front of me, kept it clean, and when I saw Oscar rejoining, I thought, ""Well, let\'s stay out,"" because it was only those three corners. The rest was still dry. When I continued, basically, the first two sectors were fine ‚Äì it was just if I could survive the final sector. I think that lap I did was okay. If there wasn\'t much more rain coming, I thought it could work. You also have to factor in that even if they caught me on an Inter, they‚Äôd have to box again for slicks, if it‚Äôs not going to rain anymore. So, it was fine. I thought, ""Yeah, we\'ll do another lap,"" but then, unfortunately, on that lap, the first sector was still okay-ish, but then in Sector 2, it started to rain a bit too much and we had to box. But in hindsight, it wouldn\'t have mattered. If I‚Äôd boxed with Lando, it would have been P2. If I‚Äôd boxed the next lap, it would have been P2. And the lap that I did box, I was also P2. So, we tried something else‚Äîit might have worked. In a way, it didn‚Äôt work, but we didn‚Äôt lose any position, so it‚Äôs fine.\n \n**Q: Max, when you think where you and the team were at the start of the weekend on Friday after practice, how satisfying is this P2?**\n\nMV: I think it\'s good compared to the teams behind us. But if you look at the first stint, we were quite a bit off. As soon as the tyres started to overheat, we had no chance. McLaren just took off. So, we still have a lot of work to do to fight for a win. But yeah, I‚Äôm happy that we are second here. It\'s basically one place better than we should have been. And it\'s 18 more points than I had last year at this race.', ""Very fair. I had a feeling that the best he could manage and clutch was P2 anyway, no matter what they had tried to do. I forgot that the overheating of those tyres had played a part in scaling back the overall car performance. His race management was fantastic. Verstappen, as a driver in tricky conditions and a competitor to the front, should not be dismissed easily in the slightest. \n\nI am pretty interested in seeing how Verstappen can extract the most out of the car this season. He seems to have a mighty knack for it, and he can give the frontrunners a run for their money. This season is Norris' to lose so if Verstappen manages to bring the fight to McLaren, it is going to be peak"", 'The thing is that if Verstappen had pitted the lap after (instead of two laps after), he could have overtaken Norris. In the first half of his outlap, Norris was struggling to keep up with Lawson, so he was losing time.', 'It was the reverse Sochi 2021 I feel, where back then Lewis pitted immediately when things went south but Lando decided to stick out and then faced the consequences.\n\nWhile in this case Max didn‚Äôt pay as much of a consequence, Lando made the earliest call to pit in before anybody else and turned out to have made the right decision. As that race was one of the biggest heartbreaks since I started watching F1, this was a very, very rewarding moment for me. Your favorite driver is learning from the mistake he‚Äôs made 4 years ago! Sochi 2021 died so Melbourne 2025 could live.', ""Staying out was the right call IMO, do the opposite of what Lando did. There was a high chance of a shunt in the in-between conditions, it just happened one lap too late for Max. If Lawson/Bortoleto's crashes were one lap sooner, Max gets a cheap safety car stop and comes out in P1.\n\nPeople galaxy brain the hindsight of these decisions all the time. Hell, even in Brazil last year, Lando and George pitting for new tires was technically the right call on the basis of probability, and it literally took Colapinto binning it during a safety car for Max + the alpines' gamble to stay out to pay off, and binning it during a safety car even in the rain is still statistically quite rare, even though anecdotally we've seen it at the past two wet races now.\n\nSometimes you have to just accept that these decisions are mostly probability based gambles from the lead driver, and that it's also acceptable for the non-lead driver to do the opposite thing even it's statistically less likely to work out for them, because it's their best chance of overtaking the leader."", 'Possibly, but that‚Äôs when you only look at Lando. At that point, they still thought that he might be able to stay out on slicks, so if he pitted, he would lose out to the Ferrari‚Äôs. In hindsight, this wasn‚Äôt the case, but still. \n\nAnd that is assuming he actually had a big enough gap. I remember seeing Norris 21 seconds behind as the biggest gap. Would that have been enough?', 'Correction, Lewis wanted to stay out but Mercedes forced him to pit while McLaren was talking in riddles to Lando.', ""Lando was bugging his engineer to pit early instead of late as soon as he found out that the rain would be Class 3. He even reiterated the plan before the safety car restart. Then, maybe about half a lap before he went off, Lando said that they should pit because he was starting to struggle a bit. You could see the extremely localized spits of rain on his onboard camera. It's almost good that he went off in sector 3 and could pit immediately because McLaren really didn't want to pit too early and that forced everyone's hand and made their decision for them.\n\nI agree with you. I was getting Sochi flashbacks, and I wasn't even the one in the car! This felt like a redemption race for that day. \n\nI stand by the fact that Lando is and has always been very good in the wet, but it felt like the first time he was able to show that he could hold his own in wet/changing conditions while the spotlight was on him.\n\nIn fact, I feel like this race was a small answer to a lot of the criticism he gets. Bad in the wet? Wet race. Poor starts? Kept P1 throughout multiple restarts. Falters under pressure? Keeps it together with a charging Verstappen right behind him in the wet. Emotional communicator?

1jcfw84,Things we (re)learnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jcfw84/things_we_relearnt/,2025-03-16, Discussion,"1. McLaren: well-balanced car. The Drivers gotta step-up and minimize mistakes.


2. Max: pure talent, man! A class driver ‚Äîand Lando knows it. One mistake, and Max will be right there, ready to snatch away points from you. Especially when it rains.


3. Russell: He drives.


4. Norris vs Piastri is loading. Rivalry within house is gonna be fun for us, headache for Brown and opportunities for Max.


5. Hamilton is learning, so is Ferrari.


6. Williams and Vowles are cooking. Hope it doesn't end up like Aston Martin in 2023.


7. For me, the back-markers are still unclear. Ferrari, despite fighting with Williams and Alpine, will soon catch up to be among the front-runners or at least the lower front. Mercedes is in the upper midfield, and maybe Williams too. Alpine and the rest, including Aston Martin, seem more like mid to lower midfield teams. Sauber and Haas will probably eventually end up being the tail of the pack, but for now, I think they can still catch up to RB, Alpine, and Aston Martin. I'm not convinced yet on who will be the lapped cars.


8. Rookies are adapting among big shots. They'll deliver soon.


Edit: some additional points I should've added + elaborating few.

9. Lando deserved that win‚Äîhe drove brilliantly, and praising Max or discussing mistakes doesn‚Äôt take away from that. But we all know how even a small mistake can cost him dearly. I agree with Crofty that he could have suffered the same fate as Oscar with that mistake, and no, that mistake wasn‚Äôt small‚Äîc‚Äômon, guys. As for Max, it‚Äôs clear he can deliver even without being in a rocket ship.

10. Mercedes vs Ferrari: Many pointed out that Mercedes was faster than Ferrari, and I agree. However, Ferrari has the advantage of a seasoned (legendary) driver. Both Kimi and Lewis will need some time to settle in, and as I mentioned elsewhere, opinions might shift as the weeks and races progress. That said, we‚Äôre not quite at the point where we need to discuss Ferrari‚Äôs No. 2 driver‚Äîlol.

11. Piastri: Some people don‚Äôt see him as ready for a championship battle yet, but I believe he has the potential. In my opinion, he can deliver.

12. Kimi: He‚Äôs getting the hang of the car. I‚Äôd love to see him and Ferrari battle in the coming days.

13. Yuki: He had a great race‚Äîuntil he didn‚Äôt.

For example, there was a time the safety car cut through a corner while Lando was literally driving  alongside with the truck

Another one is during safety car, on a totally wet condition, where so many cars had spun, you can see track Marshalls standing out on the side of the track without any protection. 
","[""No one seems to mention there were 2 trucks on the track during the Alonso incident. The one Lando caught at turn 9 is not the one they sent for Alonso's car I think. Watching back on F1tv the truck arrives to Alonso's car at 1:27:13 , Norris catches up to another truck at 1:27:50. Why was another truck on the track at all at a different position?

Had he pit, he would be 2 positions from being last. He was literally nowhere. Yuki was fighting Ferrari and Mercedes at the same time, while Lawson couldn‚Äôt even fight Kick Sauber.', '> see .co.nz\n\nYeah that checks out', 'Idk mate, today was kinda of a disaster', 'Ah yes a unbiased New Zealand source', 'Ah, the New Zealand Harold lol. Sure.', 'Yeah the guy.. battling the worst performing car/team of the weekend all race long.. IN A RED BULL (AT WORST 3RD BEST CAR) while his teammate finishes #2 is SURELY going to help Red Bull this season!', 'I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting to read here but Lawson‚Äôs ability to provide good feedback being his biggest strength that can save Red Bull‚Äôs season wasn‚Äôt that.', '...leaving a trail of debris to trip up opponents...', ""I'm waiting for Josh Revell to speak fondly of him again lol""]",0,77,0.37,0,72,72,0,6,-0.010000000000000009,0
