Also worth noting: the first time Leclerc and Verstappen passed through the double-yellow zone, Verstappen gained nearly 4 tenths on Leclerc in the stadium by not slowing down as much. He almost passed Leclerc on the main straight by setting up the overtake (aka, racing) in a double yellow zone.

He basically demonstrated to race control that he wasnt going to properly respect a double-yellow, and use it to gain an advantage.  Totally understandable that race control will throw a quick VSC then let them race again.","[""What I found interesting was that there were local double yellows out for the final lap at this incident (after the VSC ended) but not the panels, and therefore the TV timing screen didn't show yellows in the final sector.

There's a maximum of 43 points available each weekend (25 for the fastest stop, 18 for the second fastest stop), which means that McLaren can only earn 4x43=172 points at most, which isn't enough to close the 204-point gap, even if Ferrari failed to score a single point at the next four races.

‚Äò‚ÄôMust bring‚Äô‚Äô -

- *Electrolytes* -> Reached 35 degrees, the water stations are easily accessed, but electrolytes really saved the day and kept us feeling well, we got a tube of 24 tablets which was the perfect amount for 2 of us https://amzn.eu/d/6C9X4Rb
- *Cooling towels* -> Keep you cool during the day, fill up pouches using water from the water station and wear them when you get to hot, we got a pack of 4 between 2 of us allowing you to switch when one dries out https://amzn.eu/d/dbJnYl3
- *Portable misting fan* -> Great at keeping you cool when you‚Äôre sat down in the sun for a long period of time and great when on the bus transport back to the city https://amzn.eu/d/gHBIZPO
- *Bleacher seat* -> Turn 12 stands are metal bleachers with no back support, these seats provide cushioning and a back, the bleachers are 11 inches deep so some brands are way too big impacting the leg room of people behind, best I could find was 13 inches which was perfect and even had a drinks holder https://a.co/d/6SWin68
- *Hat*/*Sunglasses*/*Portable charger*/*Ear plugs* (if you don‚Äôt have an Amex radio)/*Light rain jacket*/*Sun cream*/*Refillable water bottle* are all items I would highly recommend

What not to bring (suggested on some forums to bring but useless in 2025) -

- *Cash* -> COTA has been cashless since 2021 so cash is useless, ended up spending our cash at restaurants instead and for fuel as cash prices were cheaper
- *Lanyard with plastic sleeve* -> All tickets are now on mobiles with no screenshots allowed, you need to show your phone each time for access to the stands
- *Water in a insulated metal cooling flask*/*Snacks* -> The metal sets off the detectors at the entry, this sends you for bag screening and they order you to empty your drinks onto the floor, my brother had a plastic water bottle and got through each time with no search allowing him to keep water and anything he had in his bag, snacks aren‚Äôt allowed but only if you get caught

Useful information -

- *Mobile data* was invaluable, we got this whilst at baggage reclaim from an app called Airalo, ¬£15 for unlimited data, ¬£2.50 off for both people if you share your personal code when purchasing
- *F1 organised coaches* were brilliant, well worth the money, huge number of buses so queue was always moving and nice being driven out after a long day
- *Renting a car* was very useful as staying in an Airbnb south of the river, saved us taxi money, parking right next to Waterloo park (where the shuttles are) for $20, a taxi back on the first day cost us $35 one way, also useful in the evenings for parking at restaurants
- *Amex card holders* get free race radios at the circuit, you can collect on any day and keep, the same commentary as you would hear in the UK and kept you in the loop, also acted as ear plugs
- *Turn 12 grandstand* was the best turn in my option, you could see 2/3rd‚Äôs of the track including turn 1 and we saw all the major action that happened, there was a TV in front of blocks 6-8 which was very useful (you can see it from all blocks at turn 12 but closer the better to see timing tower), the higher up you are the better, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth paying for the last two rows, we were row 32 and it was perfect for the price
- *Food prices* - Expect to spend ‚Ç¨40-60 a day on food/drink at the circuit, very expensive, but can save money on drinks/snacks by purchasing them at the small self checkout vendors

*Disclaimer - This is all my opinion based on my experience, feel free to comment with what you found useful and ask any questions and I might be able to help, will ignore/delete any unhelpful/negative comments*","['Ill save this I dont think it is everything but they are some great shouts', 'Wow, thanks for the info!\n\nHope you had a good time.']",19,2,0.81,19,2,2,19,2,0.81,19

When Jenson Button, fresh off his championship win with Brawn GP (the team that became Mercedes), opted for McLaren, he set off a chain of events that defined the next decade of F1.
What if Button had stayed?
Button at Mercedes (the dominant era): Button, with his smooth style and skill, would have had a second golden opportunity. He likely would have won multiple championships in the hybrid era, much like Lewis Hamilton.
Hamilton at McLaren: Without Button, Lewis's story with McLaren would have continued. He might have stayed longer, but it's unlikely he would have tolerated the McLaren-Honda disaster. His frustration would have pushed him to seek another top team, like Ferrari, completely changing his trajectory.
Vettel at Red Bull: Sebastian Vettel's frustration with Mercedes' dominance was the main reason for his departure to Ferrari in 2014. With Button at the wheel of the dominant Mercedes, Vettel might have hung on longer at Red Bull. This would have affected the rise of other drivers, like Sergio P√©rez and Max Verstappen.
Verstappen's rise delayed: With Vettel still at Red Bull, the opportunity for Max Verstappen wouldn't have come so quickly. Max's meteoric rise, with his 2016 victory, would likely have been delayed by several years.
Ferrari and other teams: If P√©rez had signed with Ferrari (a real possibility in 2013), the team's lineup would have been very different. Also, Nico Rosberg's retirement after the intense rivalry with Hamilton never would have happened, so Bottas wouldn't have arrived at Mercedes in 2017.


Without Jenson Button we would never have seen the dominance of Hamilton or Max Verstappen, nor Alonso in the Honda era, nor even Vettel at Ferrari, nor the retirement of Rosberg and the signing of Bottas at Mercedes.So obviously events from 2010 to 2025 would never have happened but anyway what do you think? 


","['Lot of assumptions in there. Would Button have retained his seat through the hybrid era? Especially if Vettel or Hamilton came knocking. Could Button have seen off the challenge from Rosberg? Verstappen was originally a Mercedes driver - Wolff had no place for him back when he had Hamilton-Rosberg in the team, but what if it was a Rosberg-Button lineup?\n\nFact is, Button had quite a few hiccups even during his 2009 run to the title.

Button was a great driver, but Rosberg was elite. I just don't remember if Schumacher wanted to leave or Mercedes simply didn't extend his contract. If it was the latter, then Hamilton would have found his way into Mercedes for 2013 regardless."", 'Yeah well if, if, if. If my mom had balls‚Ä¶', 'You can do that with a lot of big driver moves.', ""If Button wasn't at McLaren then Hamilton would have won a championship according to Button himself. He stated that if McLaren only supported one driver like Red Bull and Ferrari only supported Vettel and Alonso then McLaren would have won at least one championship during that time. He's very much of he mindset that supporting both drivers cost McLaren the chance to win titles."", ""Button beat Lewis 1 out of 3 years and Nico beat Lewis 1 out of 4 years so he has a slight edge, but neither him or Nico beat Vettel in 17/18. So maybe Button is a 3 time champ but then Nico is probably a 2 time champ. But might also be still racing as he doesn't get Abu Dhabi'd and bail.\xa0\n\n\nAnd vettel is now a 5 time as he still leaves RB for Ferrari because the 2014 car was a sack of shit.\xa0\n\n\nAnd Alonso still leaves Ferrari in this scenario as the 2014 car was a sack of shit, but since LH is still at McLaren he doesn't go there, so he goes to RB just as they shit their pants so that's pretty Alonso in of itself.\xa0\n\n\nSo LH is stuck at McLaren for the Honda years and probably retires around 2018 because there's no real options and he don't play back marker very well.\xa0"", ""Button signed with McLaren because he wasn't wanted by Mercedes.

- Lap 6 T2: Max, yet to complete the move on Lewis, goes wide and completes the move off track, cutting T3 in the process. Lewis stays within the track and lines up a move for T4.
- Lap 6 T4: Lewis tries to make the move around the outside on Max, goes off and completes the move off track. He then rejoins and doesn't give back the position.

Logical outcome in my opinion: both drivers get a 10 second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage.

Actual outcome: only Lewis gets a penalty...

1ohapgy,F1 stewarding. Why is Max Verstappen assessed differently to other drivers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohapgy/f1_stewarding_why_is_max_verstappen_assessed/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"Before I start, I want to preface this by saying I am not a Max hater, I think he is one of the best drivers to ever grace the sport, however, it amazes me how much he gets away with on track compared to other drivers, yesterday's race being a prime example.

Let's take each incident from yesterday's race. 

1. Lap one. Max makes a great start and is forced wide into turn one. Knowing that if he brakes at the appropriate point to make the corner he is most likely going to come out in p5, given the shape of the corner, he overshoots the corner and runs across the grass. Before people say he gave the places back, I would argue they weren't his places to begin with, as he was in overspeed whilst everyone else was braking so of course he was alongside at the apex. If there was a wall there he would be forced to tuck in and not have a risk free pass. I can't believe there wasnt a penalty for this. For the record I think Leclerc should have had one as well, Lewis seemed to get passed him and instead of staying on track he just cut the corner and took the place. 

2. The incident with Lewis. This one is perhaps even more egregious. He comes from a long way back and makes a lunge on Lewis. Lewis is banged into and is forced off track. Max then, on the outside for the next corner with Lewis on the inside, just cuts the grass and takes the place from Lewis. I can't believe this was not a penalty, it was a slam dunk penalty for forcing a driver off track and gaining an advantage. Cut and dry. Then Lewis gets a 10 SECOND Penalty for locking up at turn 4 and not giving the place back, which I think was incredibly harsh but it is what it is.

3. The VSC. This is an interesting one as I've seen alot of people saying the FIA screwed Max with the VSC, however before that during double yellows, Verstappen gained about 5tenths in the last sector by not lifting compared to Charles, which is the reason he was so close coming out of the last corner when the VSC was thrown. If it hadn't have been thrown and Verstappen would of got the move done, it would have been interesting to see what the stewards would've done.

I think this points to a wider conversation about f1 stewarding, and it's integrity. It feels to be like for some drivers they have incredibly harsh penalties but for others they can drive incredibly recklessly and no punishment is afforded. There is no consistency at all and it baffles me that these stewards are watching the same race as everyone else.

Anyway happy redditing and welcome opposing viewpoints and discussion :)","[""As for point number one, he did brake at the usual point, however he was forced off the track and onto the bumpy curb where he started bottoming out, at which point you cannot slow down at the normal rate.\n\n\nThe second incident was a messy bit of driving all around, however Chandok's Sky analysis said the stewards got it right.TLDR he was ahead at the apex of turn two and kept it on the track, he was ahead at the apex of turn 3 and Hamilton pushed him wide, thus he didin't need to give the place back, and Hamilton gained a substantial advantage with his off road driving which is why he got a penalty. As for my opinion, the whole sequence was on the edge of the rulebook and if he did get a penalty it wouldn't surprise me, same as it wasn't a massive surprise he didn't get one.\n\n\nAs for the yellow flag incident, the precedent was set in I think Miami, that even a slight lift is enough, so it could be the case that Leclerc lifted more than what was necessary but none of us can judge without the telemetry and I believe other teams would have brought it up if the brach was substantial.\n\n\nLastly, I find it funny that the most punished driver of the last 18 months is thought of having preferential treatment. Stewards rotate every race and while the consistency is lacking because of it, it also ensures no individual bias. And the only confirmed biased steward, who was later removed (Johnny Herbert) was, interestingly, anti-Max."", 'this is going to be a loooong break of useless repeated posts', 'the drivers agreed to these rules. he was not assessed differently.', 'Do you guys watch races with eyes closed?', '1. Stewards are typically lenient on lap one incidents and ultimately he left the track in P4 and rejoined in P4 so he didn‚Äôt gain anything \n\n2. Per the driving rules, Max had his mirror ahead at the apex and so long as he had control of his car and didn‚Äôt go off track he‚Äôs free to push Lewis wide. As for the following corner it‚Äôs just the nature of the circuit and the line Lewis was now on, Max couldn‚Äôt have stayed on track whilst avoiding contact. Then at the next corner where lewis locked up, the stewards found he gained and lasting advantage and didn‚Äôt give the position back hence the 10 second penalty\n\n3. Delta isn‚Äôt a good measurement for this kind of incident, you need to look at the telemetry to see if he lifted significantly. For example Charles might‚Äôve lifted more than he needed to, which caused the delta to close up. That being said I haven‚Äôt personally seen the telemetry and there wasn‚Äôt an official investigation which was a bit surprising but I imagine that might‚Äôve been different had he got past', 'It is cut and dry that he did not force Lewis off at T1 and then avoided him by cutting the next corner. Hamilton then left the track and gained a lasting advantage by doing an overtake like that. Hamilton is simply in the wrong according to the applicable guidelines, whatever your opinion about those might be.\n\nVSC was related to potential fire being reported and the following marshal intervention. Nothing to do with on-track battles. And no indication that someone didnt lift enough.\n\nWhen a T1 goes like yesterday its difficult for the FIA to assess exactly who is and is not in the right, and they tend to let things go especially on lap 1 and with multiple drivers involved. Again, think about it what you want, but i dont think Verstappen got any special treatment there.', '> Lap one. (...)  I can\'t believe there wasnt a penalty for this.\n\nHe was well ahead of Russell long before the corner, before he event went to the outside to attempt to overtake the Ferraris. Arguing that he wasn\'t is just disingenuous. \n\n> Before people say he gave the places back, I would argue they weren\'t his places to begin with, as he was in overspeed whilst everyone else was braking so of course he was alongside at the apex.\n\nWhat are you even talking about here? Yes, they weren\'t his places to begin with, which is exactly why he needed to give them back, which he did. Do you think the rules say you only need to give a place back if you *didn\'t* gain it off track? Your whole argument here makes no sense at all.\n\n> The incident with Lewis. This one is perhaps even more egregious. He comes from a long way back and makes a lunge on Lewis. Lewis is banged into and is forced off track.\n\nMax came from a long way back, but was ahead at the apex, in full control of his car, and able to make the corner on his own. Therefore he was entitled to space and it was Lewis to needed to make sure there was no contact. Lewis failed to do this, and the stewards actually investigated him for it (as they should), but they basically deemed the contact too insignificant to penalize, considering neither car got damaged.\n\nPhrasing a contact Lewis initiated as ""Lewis got banged into"" just shows how incredibly biased and dishonest you are being in your entire argument.\n\n> Max then, on the outside for the next corner with Lewis on the inside, just cuts the grass and takes the place from Lewis.\n\nAgain, complete nonsense. Max was ahead of Lewis at this point, and the only reason Lewis was still sort of alongside was because he went off track at the exit of turn 1. Max is obviously entitled to space at this point, but Lewis leaves him none, forcing Max off. At that point Max has no choice but to cut the corner.\n\nHe then rejoined the track ahead of Lewis, gaining the place, and immediately lost it again when Lewis cut the next corner and gained a few seconds from that.\n\nI\'d argue that if Max had stayed ahead, he clearly would not have had to give the place back. But that\'s not even relevant since he didn\'t.\n\n> I can\'t believe this was not a penalty\n\nFor what? Leaving the track and *not* gaining and advantage? People keep demanding a penalty for this incident, and I really wonder how they think the rules work.\n\nEven ignoring the fact that Max was clearly entitled to that space and so wouldn\'t have had to give the place back if he had stayed ahead, the fact is that he didn\'t. You can\'t get a penalty for gaining an advantage if you did not gain an advantage. How is that not obvious?\n\n>  it was a slam dunk penalty for forcing a driver off track and gaining an advantage. \n\nThe driver being forced off was Max Verstappen. Are you saying he should get a penalty for forcing himself off?', ""because he knows the rulebook better than the stewards and is always pushing it to the limit, he's by far the hardest driver to steward"", ""Did you watch the race last year? Then, both situations went against him and he got 2x 10 second penalty.
