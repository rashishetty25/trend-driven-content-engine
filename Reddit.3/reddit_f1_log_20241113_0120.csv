1gplc79,Just finished a passion project - watching every race from 1992 to 2003. Here's what I learned...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplc79/just_finished_a_passion_project_watching_every/,2024-11-12, Discussion,"I started watching F1 in 2004 and really wanted to find out a little more about the recent history of the sport, mainly about drivers. This took me a couple of years overall; I really like having background noise while working, so I would have old races on and take little notes on things that stood out. Safe to say there was a lot that made me think, I wanted to share it, and I could think of nowhere else to do so, so here it is. Hopefully this is appreciated - feel free to agree/disagree with any of this or ask anything I may not have covered etc...

* The level of driving talent throughout the field was so much worse in those days. It always made me laugh when I‚Äôd see people claim Latifi was a candidate for worst driver in F1 history. He was probably on par with someone like Aguri Suzuki, who was massively accident prone but had a noteworthy performance maybe once a year. Martin Brundle may be similar; very good for the era, but someone who struggled in qualifying like he did would probably have a much shorter shelf life in today's F1.
* The era immediately after Senna‚Äôs death is unquestionably the weakest since at least the early 80s, and most likely the weakest ever. Only Schumacher was the finished product. Hill was too error prone, Alesi too inconsistent, Villeneuve was both and the likes of Berger, Barrichello and Coulthard were lacking that last tenth or two. I don‚Äôt think you could say that for Lando, Charles or Piastri, nor for Ricciardo, Rosberg and Button in their primes.
* Michael Schumacher‚Äôs 1995 has to be the greatest single-season performance I can think of from a driver. After crashing at Imola, he went on a 13 race run where he won eight times, finished second once (Portugal), suffered a gearbox problem when leading by miles (Canada), got taken out while defending the lead (Britain), suffered mechanical failure while running second (Hungary) and got taken out while running second (Italy). This run included three of the best wins of his career at Spa, the Nurburgring and Aida, the latter one that really deserves more fanfare given I knew nothing about it before watching. If we consider Williams took 12 pole positions that year, Schumacher arguably wasn‚Äôt even driving the fastest car!
* Jacques Villeneuve is the most overrated driver I have ever seen. He was way off Hill in terms of pure pace in 96 but took advantage of Hill being awful at damage limitation. In ‚Äò97 he was even worse at damage limitation than Damon the year prior. ‚Äò98 saw some amazing individual drives, but there were eight occasions where he was either beaten by Frentzen, behind when one of them retired, or threw his car off the road. I would argue 2000 was his best, but even then it was hard to truly assess how good he was because his benchmark in the sister car was so bad. As soon as BAR put a competent driver in the second car, Villeneuve started to get shown up. He arguably looked weaker than Jarno Trulli compared to Panis.
* I couldn‚Äôt fathom how Montoya was so highly rated when he got walloped by Raikkonen in the same car. The Williams had to have been a rocketship. I now realise he probably was that good, but going to McLaren was awful for him. He was the antithesis of a Ron Dennis driver and just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong, though most of it was his own fault.
* Coulthard and Carlos Sainz Jr are basically the same driver, albeit Coulthard had better cars. They‚Äôd have phenomenal individual performances and somewhat lengthy purple patches where they looked like world beaters, and it was enough evidence to make you believe that Coulthard could really win the title, or Sainz could really become Ferrari‚Äôs #1 - then Leclerc/Hakkinen would remind everyone who‚Äôs boss.
* 2012 is still the greatest season ever, but 1999 and 2003 have to be right in the mix for sheer drama. There were so many flashpoints, narratives, underdog successes and what-ifs. 2000 also comes highly recommended for the sheer brilliance of the main protagonists.
* 1997 also comes highly recommended as one of the most competitive seasons of all time. There were no real classics, but there also wasn‚Äôt a single boring race. Williams had a rocketship for most of the year but Ferrari, McLaren and Benetton could win on any given weekend. Jordan and Sauber were also superb at tracks that suited their cars, while several midfield-or-lower teams were seriously boosted by Bridgestone being miles better than Goodyear. It couldn't possibly be understood by someone that hasn't seen it.
* The era puts into perspective how much MBS absolutely sucks. I couldn't stand Max in his latter years as FIA president but you could at least see he was fighting for the type of small team he himself used to be involved in. MBS is nothing more than a hyper-moralistic whinger.

EDIT: Alright, some people thought I should add more, so here goes...

* Hakkinen was great. How great? I think Alonso was more well-rounded than him. I‚Äôd take him over Vettel, who had all the right attributes but hit some notably low lows, and I‚Äôd also take him over Nico R because he had better racecraft. I didn‚Äôt include Mika above because I didn‚Äôt learn a whole lot new about him. People said he was great and he was indeed great. 
* Another thing I thought well before this: Damon Hill was as lucky to win the world title as he was unlucky not to win multiple titles. I think he‚Äôd have walked the ‚Äò97 championship if he hadn‚Äôt been fired. Senna‚Äôs death really opened the door for him, but he had already given a really good account of himself against Prost the prior year, which was most likely Damon‚Äôs best. Or was Prost maybe a bit past his best in ‚Äò93? 
* Hill 1995 = Vettel 2018. The main difference is that Vettel never recovered before he got fired. 
* 2024 = 2001 on steroids 
* There were two Eddie Irvines at Ferrari. One was the fighter we saw in races like Buenos Aires and Suzuka in ‚Äò97, and for most of ‚Äò99. The other would underperform by miles. Reportedly, Irvine had an excuse because he barely got to test until later into his time with the team, who relied on Michael to develop the car. However, the second guy cropped up at the worst possible moments later on, like Nurburgring 1998 where he led at the start and finished a minute behind, and the 1999 title decider where he was not far off being lapped. 
* Frentzen had all the talent and none of the mentality. If he couldn‚Äôt be a big fish in a small pond, he was probably completely lost, and 1998 was the only exception. That said, he was as unlucky as he was bad in ‚Äò97. Mechanical failures cost him potential wins in Argentina and Hungary, and he got screwed when the team put him on slicks at Monaco. 
* Williams apparently rated Jean-Christophe Boullion highly and put him in at Sauber in ‚Äò95 to assess Frentzen. If that‚Äôs genuinely why JCB got that drive, this was Williams‚Äô biggest mistake in making the decision on Hill. 
* For the most famous races I put time aside to watch. The one I had the most fun with was Hockenheim 2000. I knew what was going to happen and I still shed a tear at the finish. The race went completely bonkers after that guy ran onto the track and Barrichello had absolutely no business making that strategy work. Monaco 1996 was also amazing, a race full of heroes and zeroes. Nurburgring 1999 has to be the most WTF random race of all time, with Brazil 2003 being similar but losing some of the gloss because of the dumb tyre rule and the river making it into a survival lottery rather than a day of great driving  
* Refuelling sucked. It had its moments, especially in 2003, but the sport is better off without it. However, I no longer hold the view that its reintroduction would make the sport completely unwatchable. ","['Started in 2009 myself. 2012 set unrealistic expectations for the decade to come', 'I watched all of this live, and I miss Mika in your analysis, he was the only one that could match Schumacher.', 'Out of curiosity, how did you watched every single race?\n\nF1 TV?', ""Started a similar project by only with '06, '08, '10, and '12 as I am a newer fan.

1gphd83,"Hypothetical: During a race, if P1 DNFs on the last lap, wouldn't they still end up above the other cars they've lapped?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gphd83/hypothetical_during_a_race_if_p1_dnfs_on_the_last/,2024-11-12, Discussion,"Friend and I are making up some hypothetical scenarios that could make an unusual/exciting WDC championship but can't agree on this one. I'll only put the relevant part because the full context might make this more complicated and I am very bad with words.

- Say it's a 50 lap race.
- P1-P7 have lapped P8 down and are on the final lap.
- P1 suffers some failure/crashes/whatever and won't cross the chequered flag.

What we agree on:    
- P1 still classifies because they finished more than 90% of the race.

What we disagree on:    
- I say P1 becomes P7 because they already finished Lap 49 ahead of the other cars and so is ahead of P8.    
- He says P1 becomes last of the Lap 49 finishers because it's a DNF. *(In our scenario, P8-P11 are one lap down, so P1 becomes P11 according to him.)*

I still don't understand his reasoning for the DNF part but I am pretty sure I'm right on this one. However, I don't know how to properly put it into words so maybe someone better at explaining things can help me out.

Unless I am wrong about this and would also like to know why.

Thank you.","['Yes, it happened a couple years ago in Spa. Lando had an engine failure on the last lap, barely getting over the line. He was classified 10th or something just because the ones behind were lapped.', '> I say P1 becomes P7 because they already finished Lap 49 ahead of the other cars.\n\nThis is correct. #8 is unable to complete lap 50 and #1 completed lap 49 before #8, so he is classified ahead of #8.', 'They are P7 - the cars on the lead lap pass them, the cars a lap down cannot. They therefore were first of the cars who completed 49 laps.', 'It‚Äôs pretty clear from the sporting regulations that you are correct.\n\n62.1) The car placed first will be the one having covered the scheduled distance in the shortest time, or, where appropriate, passed the Line at the end of the two hours.
