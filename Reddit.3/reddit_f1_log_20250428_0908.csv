1k92i78,My take on where exactly Lewis is struggling against Leclerc,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k92i78/my_take_on_where_exactly_lewis_is_struggling/,2025-04-27, Technical,"Hey everyone, 
Made this carousel for my Instagram page so I thought I‚Äôd share it here too. The 8th slide is actually a video of Lewis having a small moment of Oversteer. I tried my best to reduce as many variables as possible while comparing Telemetry. I took the Q3 final laps specifically from every weekend cause that‚Äôs when the drivers are pushing the most.

He's arguably the only one so far who has consistently shown that he can hang around Verstappen in a somewhat equal car without getting bullied, as well as being one of the best qualifiers right now, maybe even all time. People always bring up France 2022 or Miami 2023 to call him a 'choker' or crash prone but he has progressed leaps and bounds since then. \n\nIt was always going to be difficult for Lewis to be even remotely close to him in Qualy, especially after he struggled so much last year, as well as having a new car and engine like OP mentioned.

Unless it was so egregious that they had no choice but to penalize the offensive driver (Verstappen on Norris in Mexico).\n\nUnder the old rules, criteria III (Without (deliberately) forcing the other car off the track at the exit. This includes leaving a fair and acceptable width for the car being overtaken from the apex to the exit of the corner.) must\'ve been either disregarded regularly or they tripped over the deliberately-part, based on past incidents that were left unpunished.\n\nSo they\'ve now changed it. They\'ve tried to remove the divebomb-aspect of it by saying you should be alongside a mirror before you hit the apex on top of being there when hitting the apex. They have also removed the criteria that spoke on not forcing people off of the track. \n\nSo essentially, it\'s worse now if that rule that covers ""you move or we crash"" overtakes doesn\'t work as intended. Which it probably won\'t.\n\nGood stuff, guys.

Who is gonna be at fault then?\n\nFrom now on, the only overtake is gonna be on the straight with the DRS."", 'Max is gonna love it lol', 'AND have to make the corner within limits?!

It's insane.\n\nSo now you're forbidden from defending the outside of a turn? Like it's fairly typical, especially in a chicane, to attempt to stay on the outside to have the inside for the next turn. This is impossible with today's guidelines.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not complicated, keep the same rules but apply them wether your overtaking or not.\n\nYour level with the mirrors on the inside? You are entitled to racing room.\n\nYou're level from the apex on the outside? You're entitled to racing room.\n\nAll that, evidently, while being on control of the car and be able to stay within the white line.\n\nIt was always about driving putting themselves in a position to force their opponent to give them space.

1k97pcw,[AMuS] Is there help for Verstappen?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k97pcw/amus_is_there_help_for_verstappen/,2025-04-27, News,,"['Translation and full article:\n\n> **Red Bull tries to hit the window of its car every weekend. Sometimes it\'s faster, sometimes not at all. It depends on the track. If the setup is right, only Max Verstappen benefits.**\n\n> This Red Bull remains a mystery. Its operating window is as narrow as a mailbox slot. Every weekend, drivers and engineers strive to hit that magic window. If they find the perfect setup, Max Verstappen has a car with which he can win. Sporting Director Helmut Marko laments: ""This car has great potential, but it\'s difficult to unlock.""\n\n> How difficult depends on the track layout and conditions. Fast corners like those in Melbourne, Suzuka, or Jeddah help. Medium-fast or slow corners, where you have to turn the car sharply, are poison. If the asphalt is rough, the tires overheat too quickly. If it\'s smooth and offers plenty of grip, that helps Red Bull. Heat is a through ball for McLaren. As it gets cooler, the window opens up for Red Bull. Therefore, Marko is demanding: ""We can no longer rely on such randomness.""\n\n> On tracks like Shanghai and Bahrain, even Verstappen had no chance. The car\'s fundamental problem slows him down. Wherever the front wheels are turned sharply or the car rolls along its longitudinal axis, the balance shifts between turn-in and the apex. The car slides, and the tires heat up. This then punishes the driver in the subsequent corners, even if their profile would be better suited to the Red Bull. Over a race distance, the problem is exacerbated.\n\n> **More downforce is not a panacea.**\nRed Bull\'s peculiarities are nothing new. ""We\'ve been struggling with them since the Imola race last year,"" recalls Marko. That was the moment when Red Bull had to react to McLaren\'s offensive, a moment when Ferrari and Mercedes also grew stronger.\n\n> The engineers responded by increasing downforce. But that\'s a double-edged sword with these ground-effect cars. More downforce often comes with side effects like instability or indifferent balance. Once you\'re caught in this vicious cycle, it\'s hard to get out.\n\n> In 2022 and 2023, Red Bull was largely spared these phenomena because the car was vastly superior. The aerodynamicists didn\'t even have to push the limits, allowing them to operate on safe ground. When they took it to the extreme for the first time with an underbody upgrade at the 2023 Spanish GP, Verstappen immediately noticed that the rear end became light when turning, and the car began to understeer toward the apex.\n\n> But it was still subtle enough that the champion was able to overshadow it with his class. The bottom line was that the lap time was faster. That\'s what counted. So the engineers cautiously continued to move in that direction. Until at some point, the pendulum swung, and even Verstappen found the handling annoying. Former driver Sergio Perez was already lost by then.\n\n> **The teammate\'s problem.**\nLiam Lawson discovered the same thing. The New Zealander found the car undrivable. As soon as he was back in the Toro Rosso, Lawson regained his old speed. In Jeddah, he had the pace of Isack Hadjar. Now Yuki Tsunoda has to contend with the Red Bull. It helps him that his driving style leans more towards Verstappen.\n\n> Nevertheless, it\'s noticeable that Tsunoda is closer to the world champion while the drivers and engineers are still in the discovery phase and everyone is complaining about the car. When Verstappen is finally satisfied with the car, the gap widens. In Jeddah, from four to nine tenths. This suggests that a car that suits Verstappen only very rarely benefits his teammate.\n\n> The four-time world champion has an extreme driving style. He wants a front axle that steers on command. He controls the rear with his reflexes or the accelerator pedal, as long as the tendency to oversteer remains within limits. With the level of downforce that has now been achieved, it may no longer be possible on certain tracks and under certain conditions to tune the car so that it remains stable with Verstappen\'s driving style.\n\n> Lando Norris is currently experiencing this phenomenon at McLaren. Although the new MCL39 is a better and faster race car than its predecessor, Norris complains that it no longer suits his driving style as well as the 2024 model. Norris is the closest to Verstappen\'s driving style. His problem is that McLaren will be hesitant to tailor the car to the Englishman. They have a driver in Oscar Piastri who is just as fast. So the engineers will always look for the happy medium.\n\n> Verstappen and Norris need a lot of downforce on the front axle to turn in. Transferring the downforce to the rear in fast corners would require the front wing to flex more under load than is possible or permitted. This could become an even bigger problem for some with the new rules starting with the Spanish GP.', 'Interesting. Makes me wonder just how much the change in Spain will change things.\n\nLike imagine we roll up and Ferrari are the fastest car.', 'RBR investing in cloud seeding bigtime.', '""If we could just unlock it\'s potential""... if that wasn\'t said by Toto every weekend from \'22 through 24', 'Spain TD will be an interesting one‚Ä¶. However, I still think Merc is the most brittle one. If it Happens, WDC will be in Piastri‚Äôs pocket.', 'Can‚Äôt say if Max really needs help since he‚Äôs doing better than other drivers who have tried the seat. I would think given all the issues at Red Bull, Max is pushing the car to its best potential. \n\nNow if Red Bull did get the car in a broader window it would be nice but as I understand it, it‚Äôs been the car‚Äôs characteristic for along time dating back to Gasly and Albon‚Äôs stints.\n\nHowever if anyone did help them figure out that narrow slot better it was likely Newey on the pitwall and race operations - he understood the car better and could guide the team to optimizing the setup. Now he‚Äôs not there, Red Bull finds it difficult to tame the bull they made.', 'Thanks for the translation.\xa0', 'Ditto the thanks for the translation.\n\nInteresting to read this last paragraph that both Max and Lando need a lot more downforce on the front wing. \n\nRemoving the ability to transfer downforce from the front to the rear in fast corners, that a flexi front wing (from Spain onwards) could mean we see yet more quali and race drama.', ""Thanks for the translation.

By going into the season race-by-race in this article, I hope to highlight that Prost's triumph was not merely the product of luck, but rather one of the greatest sustained campaigns in Formula 1 history, and perhaps even a template for today's drivers on how to clinch a title against the odds..."", 'Thanks so much for putting this up it was a great read. Just like many I didn‚Äôt know much about 86 bar the race in Adelaide.\xa0', ""Prost didn't get lucky. He drove a car that was the least expected to break and drove very consistently throughout the season."", 'I guess this is a good time as any to ask this: Am I crazy or was the French calling him the teacher? As in le professeur?', 'for those who are interested, there is a [fantastic 1986 season review](https://youtu.be/Ncl4kUXON7U?si=r5ViJtB6x0sXGDsW) narrated by clive james, and his quick wit make them really fun to watch. he also did reviews for the 84 and 82 seasons which should also be on youtube if you look hard enough', 'Fantastic read. 1986 is one of my favourite seasons. Hopefully F1TV will have all the races up one day.', ""It should be an easy calculation. The fastest car should win.\n\n\nBut the best driver isn't necessarily in the fastest car, and sometimes a better driver in a slower car can still win.\n\n\nAnd then you throw in *luck*, or rather *bad luck*, which can happen to anyone, regardless of their skill or equipment.\n\n\nAnd you got something fun to watch."", 'This article screams George Russell as a serious contender quietly & consistently finishing top 5 every races and ready to pounce whenever the front runners fucks up.', ""IMO, Prost is, in retrospective, the most underrated driver of all time. His style and approach is the one that everyone adopts now. He was always optimizing for race results, effectiveness over flashiness. He wasn't the most spectacular and not always the fastest on qualy, but he never took unnecessary risks and racked up the points more effectively than anyone else. His racing philosophy is the prevalent one now.""]",99,44,0.91,99,293,293,2,0,0.010000000000000009,2

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.
