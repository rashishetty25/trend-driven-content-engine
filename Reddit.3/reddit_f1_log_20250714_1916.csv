1lzi2dz,Did F1 play the same role as blue jeans and Coca-Cola in ending Communism?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lzi2dz/did_f1_play_the_same_role_as_blue_jeans_and/,2025-07-14, Throwback,,"[""Well... that's a title I never thought I would ever read."", ""Kinda too bad the headline goes so far (also, guessing they've since changed it?) because the actual article and the historical context it provides were fascinating"", ""For the people who haven't bothered past the post title, it's actually a really good read and I'm glad OP shared it.\n\nWell written and a nice insight into that era of F1, makes a lot of sense the kind of character Bernie ecclestone is.\n\n That Piquet overtake on Senna is insane btw, really wish i was around to watch 80s F1"", 'r/brandnewsentence', 'The title is nonsense but the article is a pretty good read.', 'ITT: People who have never lived under communist regime or at least in country that took decades to get back to actually functioning after Soviet influence dissipated making fun of the title. It\'s genuinely a good read, even though the title is definitely still reaching quite a lot, many really underappreciate the power of western symbolism that caused people to sway them away from believing in the regime of the time. When we had first McDonalds in Prague, it was a fucking event, as crazy as it might sound. People went there to ""taste the capitalism"", as ridiculous as it seems. I don\'t expect you to fully get it, but at least try, please. It was celebrated, because we finally had our freedoms back... and western brands, which F1 most definitely is, played some part in it just as well.\n\nHeck, freaking western music was legally banned at the time. Only state allowed bands and musicians could sell their records there (and it was mostly shit, as you can imagine). All you could do is get some off the shelf contraband stuff that somebody copied in Germany and smuggled it here. That\'s how shit was back then, so when F1 had a race in this part of the world, it really meant a lot.\n\nDisclaimer, because I know that redditors tend to idealize communism here and there... I\'m not Hungarian (I\'m Czech) and I do not support their current government in any way. I am very liberal and they suck ass and can go fuck themselves. But try to read it through optics of a country that was oppressed for years by living behing the Iron Curtain and that had to answer to Moscow for everything, instead of looking at it through the lucky westerner optics of ""anything that celebrates fall of communism is automatically right wing in the Trumpish sense"" of ways. Communism in Europe after WW2 did a lot of terrible shit that many people shrug off as just poor implementation. And fair enough, maybe it could have been titled more as ""Did F1 play the same role as blue jeans and Coca-Cola in ending Soviet influence""?\n\nSeriously many of you don\'t realize how good you had it on the west side of IC. I appreciate that this article is written in English because I sure as hell don\'t speak Hungarian, but yeah... with that title... and seeing that it\'s on conservative site... it won\'t do well in front of people that were born on the better side of the world at the time.\n\nRidiculous title, but a good read.\n\nEDIT: Now that I read my comment again I get that it might come off a bit too agressive and I\'m sorry for that tone, but this matter is very sensitive to me and my family, so sorry about being a bit too brash about it. But I guess it just underlines the point I\'m trying to make. F1 didn\'t cause any political regime to fall, as clearly shown by present F1 racing in very sketchy countries to say the least. But as symbol, it really was a big deal to the common man, we had a taste and look at what people in the west watch and do for their entertainment after decades of listening to propaganda how you guys just eat rubbish and struggle every day (in contrast to our state is taking great care of course), and that\'s what the article is all about.', ""Of course they won't tell that Hungary was not the first option to become the organizer of F1 Grand Prix in the Second World."", ""I think the Hungarian GP played a small part in it. Like the [heavy metal show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Music_Peace_Festival) in Moscow. \n\nThey were all small pieces of the same puzzle. People behind the Iron Curtain saw you can, in fact, have nice things. Rock 'n' Roll, freedom of speech, car racing, supermarkets, free press, entertainment, free trade, more than one political party, movies, heavy metal, titty magazines, WWF wrestling, David Hasselhoff, people doing stupid fun things just because they can, or even *gasp* starting up a business of their own. There was no single individual thing that broke the dam, but all the things together, combined with being dirt poor and suffering under communism."", 'Hmmmmm what the hell?', ""It's a stupid title, but the article is okayish. I'm not sure I agree that F1 helped end communism, but there were people who managed to escape Eastern Bloc countries by leaving for the Hungarian GP and then escaping to Austria.\n\nImo the F1 race was more of a symbol of communism nearing its end than a cause of it""]",0,31,0.29,0,28,28,0,1,-0.010000000000000009,0
