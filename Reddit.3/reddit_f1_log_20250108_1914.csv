If it was a worse punishment, would George have still also gotten the punishment? Could they prove if George reacted to the lights, or did Lando start sooner and he reacted to Lando.

Bishop thinks the answer a very small core team working with him to keep him focused and so improve consistency. That‚Äôs potentially true, but Gasly‚Äôs always seemed to be lightning focused when the car is capable of achieving - like 2020, 2021, the end of 2024 - but doesn‚Äôt seem to focus as much during fallow periods like 2022 and early 2024. \n\n>I do not know Pierre Gasly at all well, but I have had a few short chats with him over the years, and I have enjoyed them all. In the Miami paddock in 2022, when I was Aston Martin‚Äôs comms chief, by mistake he entered our paddock hospitality building instead of AlphaTauri‚Äôs, which was next-door to ours.

A few problems with that assumption in a few different directions."", 'TL;DR:  \nConsistency could help Gasly attract a big team offer.', ""Don't know why people downvoted this, I always enjoy Matt Bishop's articles"", 'Basically the article says once he becomes more predictable he will be sought after by big teams. Probably.\n\nHe‚Äôs looking better than a lot of the midfielders. I can see him being on par with Piastri or Sainz in a similar car. Lots of rookies coming in, and he is one of few who have a reputation of improving the team.', 'Here‚Äôs the article:\n\nAs we embark on a new year, inevitably our thoughts turn to the forthcoming Formula 1 season. Much of the hype surrounds the biggest names, particularly those who have moved teams. Therefore, even though today is Lewis Hamilton‚Äôs 40th birthday, I will not now add to the acres of digital newsprint being written about Ferrari‚Äôs new recruit, other than to observe that a 40-plus Ferrari driver has won the F1 drivers‚Äô world championship once before, albeit 69 years ago. I am referring to Juan Manuel Fangio, who was 45 when, in 1956, in a Ferrari-run Lancia-Ferrari D50, he became F1 world champion for the fourth time.\n\nNo, today I am writing about Pierre Gasly, who is only 28. However, perhaps surprisingly, in addition to Hamilton, only three other current F1 drivers are older than he is: Carlos Sainz, 30; Nico H√ºlkenberg, 37; and Fernando Alonso, 43. Moreover, Gasly is now very experienced, having started 153 F1 grands prix, which, now that F1 seasons encompass more than 20 rounds, means that in his eight F1 seasons he has started more grands prix than John Watson (152 grands prix over 12 F1 seasons), Ren√© Arnoux (149 grands prix over 12 F1 seasons), Derek Warwick (147 grands prix over 11 F1 seasons), Carlos Reutemann (146 grands prix over 11 F1 seasons), Emerson Fittipaldi (144 grands prix over 11 F1 seasons), and 728 others.\n\nGasly‚Äôs route to F1 was a classic modern-era apprenticeship. After an extensive karting career that began when he was 10, he finished third in the 2011 French Formula 4 Championship at 15, he won the 2013 Formula Renault Eurocup at 17, and he became 2016 GP2 champion at 20. In the course of that run of success, in 2014, he was enrolled in Red Bull‚Äôs young driver programme, and in October 2017, in Malaysia, he made his F1 debut for Toro Rosso, replacing Daniil Kvyat, going on to finish five grands prix out of five for Red Bull‚Äôs B-team that year.\nPierre Gasly celebrates Formula Renault race victory at Jerez.\n\nIn 2018 he drove a full F1 season for Toro Rosso, outclassing his team-mate Brendon Hartley, the highlight a fine fourth place from sixth on the grid in Bahrain, where he was beaten by only Ferrari‚Äôs Sebastian Vettel and the two Mercedes drivers, Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas. Again, as had been the pattern throughout his climb through the feeder series, the strength of his performances would propel him onwards and upwards towards his goal, and in 2019, still only 22, he would race for the Red Bull A-team.\n\nThe fly in the ointment, as we have seen often since, and as we may well see yet again, was that his Red Bull team-mate would be Max Verstappen. Gasly drove well enough in 2019, but Verstappen drove brilliantly, beating his team-mate repeatedly in qualifying sessions and races alike. As a result, Pierre was sent packing back to Toro Rosso after just half a season, replaced in Red Bull‚Äôs A -team for the remainder of the year by Alex Albon.\n\nYou will doubtless have your own opinion as to the whys and wherefores, and the rights and wrongs, of that precipitate switcheroo. Suffice it for me to say that, like quite a few other talented drivers whose F1 careers have been buggered about with over the years by Christian Horner and Helmut Marko ‚Äî Daniil Kvyat, obviously, who was fired once by Red Bull, once by Toro Rosso, and once by AlphaTauri, which has got to be a record, but also in various different ways Mark Webber, Daniel Ricciardo, Carlos Sainz, Alex Albon, Nyck de Vries, and Yuki Tsunoda ‚Äî Gasly found himself out of favour perhaps too soon, and maybe without good enough reason.']",0,44,0.44,0,245,245,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
