It was hilarious. Its like Jacques is trying to actively not tweak in his seat listening to Crofty's takes.

Although Villeneueve seems like he's a little stuck in the days he used to race in F1, I find his takes very insightful race craft wise (wdc afterall...), more than Crofty at least. And his opinion refreshing. I may not agree with him on some but it's refreshing to see a clash of opinions.

One instance during the last few laps: Crofty was like ""what are mclaren doing, let piastry pass lando to challenge max so we can finally have some racing"" and Villeneueve was like ""yeahh.... no he shouldn't, I wouldn't have lol. Every point counts individually, its champion mentality""

Scenarion 2: Piastri drops back behind both frontrunners after his pit. With the better tire management on the McLaren cars Norris would have been able to attack Verstappen in the later stages.

They‚Äôre locking in the championship early with results like these.', ""Here's my take:\n\nMcLaren didn't want to risk undercutting Oscar past Lando and then have to handle the resulting situation afterwards, even if it meant handicapping themselves in the battle for the win.\n\nLando had a substantial gap to Charles and George, so he could've easily extended for multiple laps, and get some sort of tyre delta to Max.\n\nObviously getting the biggest possible delta to Max would mean Oscar undercutting Lando. Which can definitely result in a complicated situation later.\n\nIf the new tyre delta wasn't enough and Lando can't catch back up, he'd be annoyed at losing second due to being undercut by his own team. If Lando does catch back up at a time when Oscar is 1 second behind Max, Lando would want the position back and Oscar would be miffed at being asked to let Lando through when he himself is right behind the leader and pushing for the win.\n\nThey intentionally went extremely conservative in an attempt to keep both drivers happy, instead of making tough decisions later.

1jsy8oq,[AMuS] McLaren curses the asphalt,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jsy8oq/amus_mclaren_curses_the_asphalt/,2025-04-06, News,,"['Cursing? $1,500 fine coming Macca‚Äôs way', 'Translation and full article:\n\n> McLaren\'s dominance has been broken thanks to Max Verstappen\'s victory at the Japanese Grand Prix. How did the world champion\'s success come about, and what role did the asphalt play? We answer the most important questions about the race in Suzuka.\n\n> **What was the significance of qualifying?**\nThe celebrations at Red Bull were already loud after the time trial on Saturday (April 5). Max Verstappen had put the RB21 on pole position thanks to his fabulous lap. McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were left empty-handed. What no one could have predicted was that Saturday\'s result would also be the result on Sunday. All experts had assumed that the McLarens would better exploit their strengths in a dry race due to less tire wear.\n\n> But that didn\'t happen. Team principal Christian Horner summed it up after the Grand Prix: ""I can\'t remember any overtaking maneuvers. Almost everyone finished in their starting position. It was a flat-out race from the first to the last lap."" The Englishman praised his star driver: ""That was one of the best weekends of his career.""\n\n> Another crucial factor was that, with very few exceptions, he never allowed his pursuer, Norris, into the DRS window. Horner knew the reason: ""He was particularly strong at the exit of the chicane before the start and finish. He had already secured pole position there yesterday.""\n\n> On Friday\'s practice session (April 4), Red Bull was still in the woods. Sporting director Helmut Marko called it a ""bad car."" But massive setup changes paid off. The car hit the window just in time for Q3. From that moment on, the world champion delivered. Marko enthused: ""He parried all the attacks, was on the limit for 53 laps, and didn\'t make a single mistake.""\n\n> The only time things got tense was when Verstappen and Norris changed tires at the same time on lap 21. Red Bull\'s pit stop took longer than McLaren\'s. Verstappen and Norris exited the pit lane almost level with each other. While accelerating, Norris tried to overtake, but Verstappen didn\'t give in, and Norris briefly skidded through the grass.\n\n> The Englishman immediately complained over the radio, and Verstappen countered: ""He drove into the grass of his own accord."" The stewards did not initiate an investigation. After the race, Norris also had a different opinion, at least publicly: ""I think that\'s racing. And Max would have been the last driver to make way voluntarily anyway.""\n\n> Christian Horner explained why Verstappen\'s stop took too long: ""We wanted to adjust something on the front wing. But that didn\'t work and cost time. It also caused more understeer.""\n\n> **Why did McLaren bring in Piastri first?**\nRed Bull was fortunate that McLaren didn\'t attempt the undercut with Norris. Instead of pitting the second-placed driver first, Piastri was given the hard tire on lap 20. From that moment on, Red Bull knew that Norris would be pitting a lap later and ordered their driver to pit as well. At first glance, it would have made more sense to favor Norris in the fight for victory. But McLaren had to defend against George Russell in the Mercedes.\n\n> The Englishman had already pitted on lap 19. Mercedes calculated that the undercut added 1.5 seconds per lap when switching from the medium to the hard rubber. Piastri also had difficulties with the medium compound. ""I was already within the window to stop and also had some graining on the front tires. We did that to cover the guys behind me.""\n\n> **Why were there so few overtaking maneuvers?**\nWhile Verstappen\'s victory puts him just one point behind championship leader Norris, McLaren was unhappy despite finishing second and third. Team principal Andrea Stella was annoyed by the fact that they had laid new asphalt in the first sector and from the chicane exit at Suzuka. Combined with the hardest tire set available, which Pirelli had brought to Suzuka, there was hardly any tire wear. ""It was a race with almost no tire degradation, and that hurt us because we couldn\'t play to our strengths in that area,"" Stella explained.\n\n> Sauber veteran Beat Zehnder took a different view. ""I wouldn\'t say it should be blamed solely on the new asphalt. We also had the hardest tire compounds available here."" The Swiss driver can imagine that results like those in Suzuka will lead to a different approach from the tire supplier. ""Perhaps Pirelli will bring the softer compounds to Japan next year.\n\n> Zehnder also provided another reason for the few place swaps: ""When you look at how close the field is, overtaking maneuvers become almost impossible. After ten laps, the entire field was only 17 seconds apart."" The overtaking gap is simply too small. The Mercedes strategists spoke of a 1.2-second gap needed to overtake.\n\n> **Why didn\'t McLaren swap places?**\nThe race was like a procession. McLaren could have spiced things up a bit, though. Even in the first stint, Oscar Piastri seemed a bit faster than his teammate Lando Norris after the initial phase. However, there was no exchange of positions.\n\n> Even towards the end of the race, it seemed as if Piastri could set a faster pace than Norris. The Australian therefore asked on the radio if he could be allowed to pass so he could try to attack Max Verstappen.\n\n> McLaren decided against it. Team principal Andrea Stella explained: ""Oscar was barely faster. That wouldn\'t have made any difference. As soon as the gap was within a second, the turbulence from the dirty air was too great. The same would have happened to Oscar."" Red Bull Sport Director Helmut Marko said mischievously: ""We would have swapped. But McLaren has the Papaya Rules, and they\'re their own rules.""\n\n> **What was going on at Ferrari and Mercedes?**\nUntil qualifying, George Russell had been considered McLaren\'s main challenger. But starting fifth, his race was essentially lost. He couldn\'t get past Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari. The aforementioned undercut didn\'t work. Russell ran into Yuki Tsunoda in traffic. Leclerc controlled his opponent after the only stop. Russell\'s teammate, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, finally closed in on the team leader. This was due to the long first stint on the medium tires. The Italian was then able to take advantage of the significantly fresher rubber.\n\n> Lewis Hamilton crossed the finish line in seventh place. The record winner had started on the hard tires. Ferrari team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur explained the reason: ""It was due to the starting position. Lewis was only eighth. We didn\'t want to send both drivers into the race with the same strategy.""\n\n> The Frenchman was once again forced to face critical questions after an average weekend. Ferrari is too far behind its rivals. ""We\'re missing two to three tenths of a second in qualifying. In the race, it\'s even more. We\'re talking about three to four tenths."" However, the mixed start to the season hasn\'t led Vasseur to resort to impulsiveness: ""We don\'t have to and won\'t change our approach from last year."" However, he held out hope for a miracle: ""You\'ll never improve by three to four tenths in one fell swoop.""', 'So then Red Bull says: ""Kiss my asphalt""', 'I curse Max Verstappen. Simple too good for that bunch of amateurs.', '*I curse the asphalt down in Suzuka*', 'McLaren decided against it. Team principal Andrea Stella explained: ""Oscar was barely faster. That wouldn\'t have made any difference.""\n\nNo, be honest Andrea. It would make a whole lot of difference and everyone with an IQ higher than 100 can figure this out. You would\'ve lost the lead in the Championship which would become truly a humiliation having such dominant car.  Of course could\'ve never done that, and rightfully so!', 'https://preview.redd.it/2unw5rb389te1.jpeg?width=792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2414cde2cfbf4c7809cb2b83db1d2558a6ec4c2', '""A bunch of fakkin\' wankers""', ""They could have switched and if Piastri couldn't do it then they could have switched back on last lap""]",30,19,0.84,30,15,15,6,4,0.010000000000000009,6

They took a risk, and it's been paying off. No one had any problem with it then to stop it, and also any other team had the ability to put the money down and buy Minardi outright themselves. They didn't, so now they can't be crying foul on a move that was made legally, even if it doesn't help them. And Redbull aren't the only team in F1 that have little side deals / rub my back, ill rub yours type of relationships behind the scenes.
