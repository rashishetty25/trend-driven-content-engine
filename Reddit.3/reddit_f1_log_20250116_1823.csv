1i2p8a7,O'Wards' story on his French denied Super License.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i2p8a7/owards_story_on_his_french_denied_super_license/,2025-01-16, Discussion,"Recently Pato O'Ward went to a Mexican podcast called ""Creativo"", one of the clips that went kinda viral or at least gained some notoriety is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZShqdZPECbg). Pato had previously talked about it, mentioning that only that the FIA did not wanna give him his SL, but in this podcast he expanded.

O'Ward says that after getting P8 with Carlin in Indycar, Helmut got in contact with him an gave him a Formula 1 contract for what would have been 2020. Patricio says that he was on his way to F1, that Charlie Whiting gave the green light and all. Charlie dies and a new team arrives, referred by O'Ward as ""the French team"", they block O'Ward's SL due to a lack of points by not counting his Indy Lights points due to the number of cars not meeting the minimum to reward full points. This is the part when he is sent to Japan to get points, that he does not receive because he does not complete the season. In the end, O'Ward claims that the FIA did it on purpose to protect ""A Frenchman"" from losing his seat (honestly, just should have said Gasly, with the timeframe is very clear).

While I don't doubt there were politics involved because FIA, I find interesting that depending on who he talks to, his tone changes. In both english and spanish he is kinda hostile to the FIA, but in english has claimed ""Red Bull let me go"", while in spanish verions (i've seen) of the story is ""I cut with Red Bull"" (as if he was the one leaving, not Marko telling him to go).

Other thing I find interesting is what would have been Red Bull's structure for 2020, I asume VER-ALB in RBR and KVY-OWA in AT with Gasly dropped.","['I like Pato a lot but the way he‚Äôs told this story over the years is clearly pretty BS.

Let me know your Top 3.

My predictions:

1. WDC Champion: Charles Leclerc
2. WDC Vice-Champion: Lewis Hamilton
3. Third Place: Lando Norris

I do believe that if Ferrari provides a Championship level car (or even close), Charles & Lewis are both the favorites (I believe they will provide a very good car hence my top 2 but they are interchangeable). 

I think McLaren will have a very very good car but Lando isn‚Äôt ready yet to challenge and same goes for Oscar, he is to inconsistent.

Regarding Redbull and verstappen, unfortunately I don‚Äôt see them delivering a good car for max to be able to challenge for the title next year.

Finally, concerning Mercedes It‚Äôs been 3 years and they still don‚Äôt seem to understand the current regulations and haven‚Äôt show the capacity to build a championship level car. So Goerge won‚Äôt be anywhere near the top, tho he might win 1 or 2 gps.","['Max\n\nLando\n\nCharles', ""I think the biggest thing working against either Charles or Lewis is the fact that they will split points. Unless Ferrari absolutely dominates, I don't see them being 1-2. I do think Charles has the best chance out of the two for 2025.\n\nRed Bull's problems have been overblown in my opinion. I think the car last year was temperamental when pushed to the level of competition that was occurring...but the car is fast. And Max has no teammate to worry about.\n\nI think Norris has the most straightforward path if he can keep Piastri under control and they commit to WDC early on. But again, if Red Bull comes out swinging, or Lewis struggles at Ferrari, or if Piastri steps up his game, I can see it swinging away from him."", ""Here's my unpopular opinion, but i don't think Lewis will be very close to charles at all. \n\nLewis has been neck and neck with George, after George just got into the team.

I don't think Lewis will be as quick initially. \n\nBut Carlos was as quick as charles in 2021, so who knows"", 'If McLaren makes the best car it‚Äôll be Lando. If Ferrari does, it‚Äôll be Charles.
