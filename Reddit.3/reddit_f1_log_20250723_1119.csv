And this article is the answer to the proposed suspension change. My understanding of his POV is that he is able to work with the current suspension that he has been using thus far, and if it is guaranteeing consistency and fair results on his end, he is able to focus on other aspects of the car that could use improving, and it does not compromise his performance either \n\nWhatever McLaren opts to do with their suspension scenario is up to their own prerogative, considering they have a better read of their situation than I do, but I am still pretty darn proud of the trajectory McLaren has had over the course of the few years, and the fact McLaren has stated that they are trying to settle any issues with their cars as soon as it is identified is admirable as well', ""Is it really a complaint though? He basically says he recognizes the problem Lando's having but he can live with it."", 'To add a bit more detail, the precise word he used was unpredictable, something he also said the team has managed to overcome with setup etc. Stella has discussed in earlier interviews that this means it is difficult to replicate the same performance or behaviour from the car in successive laps. Why that is so is perhaps only a matter of speculation, but the closest explanation the team has offered is a lack of ‘cuing’, which roughly refers to feedback offered from the car during turn-in, generally through the steering wheel, an issue firmly placed by many on the new front-suspension.\n\nHowever, what I find interesting is that Oscar mentioned the unpredictability issue while refusing the new front suspension. This suggests to me that perhaps the unpredictability issue he’s referring to is either unrelated to the front suspension, or more likely that he has managed to understand the car’s behaviour better than Lando because he ‘feels’ the car in a different way, i.e not primarily through steering feedback. Fascinating stuff either way.', 'I liked the insight that he doesn’t want to try the new front suspension because it adds a variable to the car on top of other upgrades they’ve added, and he’d rather have a clear baseline for assessing those first. \n\nAlso his comment that he would consider trying it (again) later in the season… which maybe means if he ends up behind Norris in the WDC and needs to take more risks. Unless of course this is PR speak for basically he’ll try it if McLaren require him to adopt it.', 'So basically what every driver from every top team has been saying all year.', 'Yeah he def used it in Canada FP1.
