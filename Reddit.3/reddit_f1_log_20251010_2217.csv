1o308c2,Discussion: How the TV direction should actually handle a race,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o308c2/discussion_how_the_tv_direction_should_actually/,2025-10-10, Discussion,"Alright, after the Singapore GP broadcast, it‚Äôs pretty clear that the TV direction was a mess. Even drivers like Carlos Sainz and Fernando Alonso mentioned it afterwards. Too many random celebrity shots, too many cutaways, and missing key moments on track.

I understand that directing an F1 race is a very hard and stressful job, and that mistakes can happen. But I want to discuss how it could be done better. Here are a few points on how the TV direction should work during a race:

1. When an overtake is about to happen, show it from an off-board camera. That way we can see both cars in one shot and properly follow the move. Also, the onboard feeds often come in with slight latency ‚Äî that‚Äôs why when they switch to an onboard mid-battle, the cars suddenly look further apart. If there‚Äôs no other option, onboard is fine, but off-board should always be the priority.

2. Don‚Äôt cut away immediately after an overtake. We don‚Äôt need to see a cheering celebrity or a girlfriend in the garage right away. Give viewers a second to enjoy the moment, maybe show the tail end of the move, and then cut to the crowd or celebs. Those shots are fine ‚Äî even good for promotion ‚Äî but use them after the racing action, or in a replay. That‚Äôs also the perfect moment for a commentator to say something like, ‚Äúand Carlos‚Äôs girlfriend seems to appreciate that one.‚Äù

3. Know your track and the race narrative. It felt like in Singapore the director had no idea Norris would be stuck behind Verstappen for ten laps. That‚Äôs plenty of time to show other elements ‚Äî the atmosphere, celebs, fans, or pit wall shots. But when there‚Äôs a fight on track, stay with the action.

I‚Äôm sure others here have more suggestions ‚Äî what would you change about F1‚Äôs live direction?","['4. Zoom out. I don‚Äôt want to see the whites of a driver‚Äôs eyes as they go through high speed corners. It makes the cars look slow. Wide shots better show how impressive the cars and driving are than the screen being 95% car.', ""For all I know, this is already happening, but\n\n5. Have a couple people who watch a couple cars, 3 cars at most, and flag developments to a director. No-one can follow the entire race all at once. Make a colour system or something. Commenters already do this with one watching the timings and telemetry to see if anyone is making a move.\n\n6. Don't be afraid to show the mid field \n\nAs for the celebrities and partners. I couldn't give a small rodents behind. Use those shots are filler for the pre and after shows."", 'Use picture in picture more during the race. If you‚Äôre hell bent on covering two cars at the front without an overtake in sight, put it on the small screen momentarily and cut to a more exciting battle in the midfield to show an overtake that‚Äôs more likely.', '- Keep an eye out on timing board. If there are drivers with gap dropping down quickly or to less than half a second switch to them.\n\n- On qualifying focus on drivers at risk for Q1 and Q2, for Q3 focus on drivers that are having mini sector times which might put them on pole.\n\n- Do your creepy face zooms on girlfriends using only and only on the small pictures.\n\nThat is all I ask.', 'If they want to show a reaction to a pass, which F1 says they are trying to do, I want to see the crews reaction. They are more invested in the performance of the car than some celebrity or WAG. With the crew you can see on their faces so much more. I would love to have seen the Williams crew reaction to Sainz fight his way back into the points more than Lando following Max. I also love it when you can see their frustration when the car gets passed or hits the wall. You can see their faces in free practice after a wreck they instantly know how long the repair will take or the frustration when they can‚Äôt fix a mechanical issue. F1 is a team sport I care about the team not the celebrities, donated in the paddock or the WAG.', ""I also dont get all the shots of gf's and parents during the race..."", ""Replays.\n\nI'll settle for replays. Show the girlfriends, focus on the lead cars, but man give me a replay of my midfield beloveds!"", 'Get rid of the stupid graphical overlays. The names, the distance to car in front, the ridiculous line behind the car like it‚Äôs painting it as it goes.', ""You're forgetting that they don't care about you because you're going to watch no matter what \n\nThey want the wives and girlfriends to watch who are more interested in the celebrities.

1o3b5xc,Championship Standings and Eliminations - Singapore GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o3b5xc/championship_standings_and_eliminations_singapore/,2025-10-10, Statistics,"**WCC:** McLaren's 3-4 was more than enough for them to clinch the constructors championship - in fact either drivers finishing position alone would have been sufficient to clinch the title. Not only was McLaren able to clinch with 6 races to go, tying Red Bull's 2023 record; but they have enough points that even when separating the drivers they would be P1 and P3 in the WCC (Piastri on 336, Mercedes on 325, Norris on 314).  
McLaren is also still on track to beat Red Bull's points record of 860 points. The soonest they could do so would be in the Qatar Sprint.

**WDC:** There were no eliminations in WDC, and very few changes in position.

* The soonest Piastri could clinch the title is now the Brazil GP. This would require that Norris scores no more than 30 points and Verstappen scores no more than 71 points between now and the end of the race.
* If Piastri were to win everything between now and the Brazil Sprint while Norris scored 0 points, followed by Norris winning everything for the remainder of the season and Piastri scoring 0, then they would tie on points *and* on wins. Norris would end up winning on count-back of 2nd places, with his 7 vs Piastri's 3.
* If Piastri wins every GP (and scores 0 in all sprints), he would clinch in the Qatar GP, even if Norris comes 2nd in every GP and wins every sprint.
* If Verstappen were to win every race, and Piastri finished 3rd in all races, then Verstappen would win in Abu Dhabi by 3 points. Consequently, so long as Piastri finishes top 3 in all remaining races, and Verstappen has one result of 2nd or worse, Verstappen would not be able to win.","['Leclerc WDC confirmed', 'For McLaren WCC is confirmed Australia 2025, we just waited till Singapore.', 'Article tomorrow morning: ""Here\'s how leclerc can still win this championship"".\xa0My veins are in plain sight, inject the hopium!!!!\n\n\nI want to believe!!!!!!', 'Whats gotta happen for Leclerc to win?
