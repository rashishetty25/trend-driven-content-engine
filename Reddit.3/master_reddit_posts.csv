Amid doubts about who Sauber will choose to start him in 2025, the Brazilian is already in the final stages of a deal with Audi and will soon have no connection with McLaren, GRANDE PR√äMIO learned in Interlagos.\n\nBortoleto's initial negotiations with Audi initially involved McLaren, with whom the driver has a contract. Months ago, GRANDE PR√äMIO revealed that talks between the parties had progressed, but that there was one issue to be resolved: the length of the agreement.\n\nAudi wanted (and still wants) a four-year contract, while McLaren would agree to a two-year deal. At the end of 2026, the Papaya team would like to be able to choose the team for 2027, considering Bortoleto as the third option between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.\n\nMeanwhile, Sauber seemed to be in a hurry to announce Nico H√ºlkenberg's teammate for next year. Alessandro Alunni Bravi, the team's representative, promised a decision by the end of September. The favorite Bortoleto was momentarily sidelined when Valtteri Bottas' name gained momentum. Swiss newspaper Blick and Dutch website RacingNews365 had guaranteed that the Finn had been chosen to stay with the team for another year. A quick announcement was expected. It didn't come. On the weekend of the US Grand Prix, what emerged was an updated date, this time from Mattia Binotto, Audi's CEO: mid-November.\n\nFaced with the impasse, Bottas began to consider a return to Mercedes to be the team's test driver, something that once again made Bortoleto his preference. On the outside, Franco Colapinto's name was mentioned, but the Argentinian has gained strength at Red Bull, especially given the clear interest shown by Christian Horner and the driver's request on Thursday for Williams to ‚Äúlet him go elsewhere‚Äù. In 2025, the British team will have Alexander Albon and Carlos Sainz.\n\nIn a way, it's a similar situation to McLaren's with Bortoleto: at the same time as it started to prepare a new deal with Piastri, the team understood that, even contractually, it couldn't and wouldn't have any reason to keep Gabriel without being able to give him a place on the grid and without having really invested in preparing his career. So the doors were opened by Zak Brown's team for Fernando Alonso's A14 agency to do its part and move forward with Audi.\n\nThe deal is now in place. The only doubt lies in the year Bortoleto will enter Formula 1: 2026 has been ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù, GRANDE PR√äMIO has learned, but next year has not yet been, possibly because Sauber and Audi still have issues to resolve as they pass the baton from one company to the other, or even because the Bortoleto clan has decided that it would not be worth it to join a bottom-of-the-pack Sauber and spend a first year of hardship and suffering.\n\nOn Thursday at Interlagos, Bortoleto won one of the strongest electoral cables. Max Verstappen praised the performance of the Brazilian, currently the leader of Formula 2, saying that Gabriel represents a good option for the teams, especially given the prospect of the change in regulations in 2026. Asked about the Brazilian's possible arrival on the F1 grid, the three-time champion was direct. ‚ÄúI would have hired him then,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúEspecially thinking about the future, 2026, young drivers, big changes in the rules. It's always good to get used to the team for a year, make mistakes here and there, integrate. Understand the car a bit. You feel much more prepared and comfortable until 2026 arrives,‚Äù he said.\n\nPiastri also defended Bortoleto's presence on the grid. ‚ÄúHe's done a very impressive job, winning Formula 3 as a rookie last year and now leading F2. So, from my point of view, if he's having these kinds of results, he deserves to be in F1. And I speak from experience about the pain of not getting a seat,‚Äù said the Australian."", 'I‚Äôm confused, if there‚Äôs any agreement between McLaren and Sauber would it not be to loan Bortoleto rather than just let him leave for another team?', ""So he hasn't left McLaren.

I've been thinking of writing this post for some months now, just for some conext I've been following Checo in-person at GPs since 2012 (Been a fan since Alonso's WDCs). I was his fan because he would put middle of the grid cars on the podium. I'll never forget him fighting with Alonso for the lead in Malaysia (I was jumping up and down screaming, not believing what I was seeing at 3am, this is my favorite all-time F1 memory). Or when he beat both Ferraris in a Ferrari powered Sauber at Monza to get second place. 

It's time for him to go though. Since last year even. At the Mexican GP this year people would still be clapping and shouting  every lap even though he was in last place. And you could hear people blaming RB still... Which is sad. But I want to say some things in that regard. The love for Checo in Mexico is pretty explainable. Mexicans just don't have a lot to cheer for, especially on a global level. Please don't hate them and us for that. Checo had a fantastic career and some amazing races.

1gbsett,Surprisingly few: All the F1 rules changed or clarified because of Sebastian Vettel since 2007,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/,2024-10-25, Discussion,"Earlier threads:
https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/
https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/

After compiling lists of rule changes and clarifications prompted by Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, several users suggested I create a similar breakdown for Sebastian Vettel. However, in researching Vettel‚Äôs career, I discovered that while he was certainly involved in high-profile incidents, relatively few resulted in formal rule changes or FIA clarifications directly because of his actions.

In fact, only two racing incidents directly led to regulatory changes or clarifications. 

- - - 

**1. Team Orders and the ‚ÄúMulti-21‚Äù Incident**

Race: 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: During the final stages of the race, Red Bull instructed Vettel to hold his position behind teammate Mark Webber using the ""Multi-21"" code. Ignoring the directive, Vettel overtook Webber, leading to significant tension within the team and sparking wider debates on team orders in F1.

Rule Discussion: Although the incident did not result in a formal rule change, it led the FIA to reinforce its stance that team orders were permissible within teams but that the enforcement was up to the teams themselves. This set a precedent for how team orders would be handled going forward, emphasizing FIA neutrality in intra-team directives‚Äã.


**2. Helmet Design Restrictions**

Year Introduced: 2015

Incident: Known for debuting new helmet designs almost every race during his time with Red Bull, Vettel‚Äôs constant changes created issues with driver recognition, particularly for fans and officials who sometimes found it difficult to identify him on track.

Rule Change: To enhance driver visibility and consistency, the FIA implemented a rule limiting drivers to a single primary helmet design per season, with allowances for one special event helmet. This rule was a direct response to (mostly) Vettel‚Äôs frequent design changes and aimed to maintain a consistent look for each driver throughout the season.‚Äã
‚Äã

**3. Track Re-Entry Safety**

Race: 2019 Canadian Grand Prix

Incident: Leading the race, Vettel ran off-track under pressure from Hamilton. When he rejoined, his manoeuvre forced Hamilton to slow to avoid a collision, leading to a five-second penalty that cost Vettel the race win and sparked intense debate about fair re-entry practices.

Rule Clarification: The FIA responded by clarifying its rules around track re-entry, specifying that drivers must rejoin the track safely without impeding others or forcing them to change their racing line. This clarification helped to set clearer expectations for safe re-entry in similar scenarios going forward‚Äã.
‚Äã

**4. Advocacy for Consistency in Stewarding**

Years: 2020-2021 (Various races)

Incident: Over multiple races, Vettel vocally criticized inconsistencies in stewarding, especially concerning track limits, penalty decisions, and race director judgments. His frustration highlighted the need for uniform rule enforcement and drew attention to the impact of inconsistent decision-making on race outcomes.

Rule Discussion: Although this advocacy didn‚Äôt lead to any specific rule change, it fueled discussions around fairness in penalty application and contributed to a broader movement for consistent rule enforcement. The FIA ultimately restructured its approach to race direction following the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, suggesting that Vettel‚Äôs efforts may have nudged F1 in a more consistent direction‚Äã.


**5. Concerns About the Virtual Safety Car Loophole**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Year: 2021

Incident: Vettel voiced concerns about drivers exploiting loopholes in the VSC system, specifically how some were gaining an unfair advantage during race situations. He emphasized the need for clearer rules to maintain fair competition.

Rule clarification: Following his remarks, the FIA acknowledged these concerns and committed to reviewing and addressing the VSC system to close any loopholes, showcasing how Vettel's advocacy influenced ongoing discussions about rule enforcement in F1.

- - - 


To give a fuller picture, I‚Äôve also included some debatable cases where Vettel‚Äôs actions sparked discussions or reinforced existing rules but I believe did not prompt specific rule changes or clarifications.

**Debatable Incidents Not Included:**

**1. Multi-Weaving in Defensive Moves**

Race: 2012 Italian Grand Prix

Incident: Vettel‚Äôs defensive move at Curva Grande pushed Fernando Alonso off-track, leading to a drive-through penalty.

Reason Not Included: The penalty reinforced the ‚Äúone-move‚Äù rule in defensive driving but did not prompt a new rule or a further clarification on defensive tactics.

**2. Collision with Hamilton Behind Safety Car**

Race: 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Incident: Believing Hamilton had brake-checked him, Vettel collided with Hamilton under the safety car and pulled alongside to express his frustration, which led to a time penalty.

Reason Not Included: Although it reinforced standards of sportsmanship under caution, it did not lead to a formal rule change or clarification. The FIA upheld existing standards on conduct during the safety car without redefining them.

**3. Overtaking on Pit Lane Entry**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Race: 2016 Chinese Grand Prix

Incident: While entering the pits, Vettel overtook ~~Daniil Kyvat~~ Jenson Button and Carlos Sainz on the pit lane entry, highlighting an ambiguous area in the rules regarding overtaking in non-race conditions like pit lane entry.
Outcome: Although Vettel‚Äôs maneuver raised questions and sparked discussion about whether overtaking should be restricted in the pit entry area, the FIA chose not to issue a clarification or rule change at the time.

But after checking in the [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/fernando-alonso) and [Stats F1](https://www.statsf1.com/en/fernando-alonso.aspx) websites, I've realized that this weekend is NOT his 400th GP start, but rather his 400th GP entered.

  
In reality, Alonso is currently at 396 races started. It's important to clarify that the differences in races entered and races started is marked by the DNS (Did not start), which by its own definition doesn't count as a started race. During Alonso's career there have been 3 DNS.

  
1. Belgium 2001: This one is pretty interesting, since Fernando actually started and did 3 laps before retiring due to a broken gearshaft. In lap 4 there was a massive crash between the Prost of Burti and the Jaguar of Irvine which triggered a red flag. Following the regulations of the time, the first 4 laps were voided, meaning that officialy, Alonso never started the race.

2. USA 2005: Well, this one is mostly known, but after issues with the Michelin tyres during practice, all teams using them pulled in at the end of the formation lap and did not start the race, including Alonso.

3. Russia 2017: Engine issue during the formation lap which forced Alonso to fail to start the race.

  
All of this means that Alonso is currently sitting at 399 entered GPs and 396 started GPs. This weekend will be his 400th **entered race**, and if he manages to start all the following races, **he will start his 400th race in Qatar**.","[""Y'all ruin everything.

The only viable solution to provide more opportunities for F2 drivers is to expand the number of teams or mandate each team to run three cars, with one designated exclusively for rookies. However, the latter option raises a dilemma: what happens if the rookie proves to be as capable as the two main drivers? Another proposal is to implement stricter licensing requirements, establishing higher standards that drivers must meet to continue racing in F1. Yet, this could be counterproductive, as a driver's performance often hinges on the quality of the car.

Lando stands out. 4 losses after starting in pole in a good enough mclaren.

I believe the general consensus amongst F1 fans in general is that Norris has more pace while Piastri has a better composure. What do you think is more important then ? Is it speed or mentality ?

1geekse,What was happening with Charles on Sunday? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,2024-10-28, Discussion,"This is a genuine question because I wasn‚Äôt able to watch the race and instead caught glimpses in live timings

The main thing i seen about the race was discourse over regulations and then flashes of discourse from the Ferrari  side.

I kind of assumed it was a bit of dramatics from Charles fans (I am also a Charles fan but sometimes things are blown out of proportion), like claiming Ferrari used team orders to stop Charles overtaking in Australia when Charles was never in the position to.

But I finally decided to go back and see what happened and I am so confused about what happened in the first stint.

I don‚Äôt think I have enough technical f1 knowledge to know what Ferrari were trying to do. I seen a comment from Fred after seeming to talk about future engine saving?

How urgent was this because continuing to tell Charles to slow his pace and letting him build such a gap is so risky, unless it was needed to finish the race strong.

Especially when they know Lando‚Äôs behind and something that‚Äôs been true all season but was especially evident with Mclarens updates the previous race, is Mclaren is a different beast on hards.

In COTA, Mclaren went from not even being close to a threat to having more pace than Ferrari on the hards. Ferrari never had to worry about it cause he was stuck behind Max but if he wasn‚Äôt then he would‚Äôve been a threat to at least Carlos.

I think COTA made people almost underestimate the pace of the Mclaren because of the dirty air medium stint, but go back and look at Lando on hards, in dirty air. He had very minimal tire age advantage as well.

So going into the second stint, with no Max in between, that is a very dangerous position to be in.

The second stint seems pretty simple. Good pace, get stuck in dirty air behind cars, have Lando catch up and the push very, very hard to try and stay ahead which hurt his tires, especially cause the majority of his pushing was when overtaking lapped cars.

That was the right plan of action for that stint because Mercedes were too far back to be a threat, and so it‚Äôs let Lando past and nurse tires or push hard and burn tires but maybe be able to hold Lando back.

But Charles should‚Äôve been able to have a big enough gap from the medium stint to be able to have a solid pace and manage his tires without having to base it on Lando.

You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he‚Äôs stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.

So what i‚Äôm wondering is what was the issue? Was it a we need to do this for the sake of the race and the car or we should do this because it‚Äôll help us later and Charles is in a pretty safe position.

Having two drivers running p1 and p2 when they have similar pace and are close together, especially if the one behind has slightly better pace but nothing to switch positions over is a very difficult situation to handle, so was it Ferrari choosing an advantageous time so the drivers wouldn‚Äôt fight each other? 

I‚Äôm genuinely asking out of confusion because i feel like i‚Äôve missed so many details and i don‚Äôt understand what the radio messages were really meaning.","[""It's likely that the brakes were actually heating up too much, given the thin air in Mexico - this was massively exacerbated by running behind Sainz for a short while, especially the 3 or 4 laps where he was within 1.5 seconds.\n\nI will put a little tweak to your points though. Sainz was faster in Mexico, but in Australia the team did radio to Charles to stop him from fighting Sainz. This was because they didn't think they'd be able to challenge for the win again this season - how wrong they were!"", '>You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he‚Äôs stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.\n\nAt the end, it was pretty much this. And then he had the incredible save onto the frontstretch, and that sealed it.', 'There was no issue per se. He had to use LiCo to cool the car and had some holdup from a few backmarkers which closed the gap to Lando.\n\nI‚Äôve seen more than a few fans of a certain fanbase suggest nefarious conspiracies and it really shows how unhinged fans can be.', 'I did not compare his onboard with Carlos. But his brake was nearly overheated all the time, which was caused by dirty air probably. And he was seldom great in Mexico, which may also relate to the LiCo issue.', 'Leclerc was asked to do lico and so was Sainz. However when Leclerc hit the back marker traffic he was told ‚Äòno more lico‚Äô so I assume he was saving his engine for needing to overtake backmarkers. The backmarkers not letting him through quickly enough didn‚Äôt help. The McLaren comes alive in the second stint and Norris (who has been saving his tyres for this part of his race) starts eating up the advantage Leclerc built over him throughout the race. Leclerc couldn‚Äôt do anything about that as his tyres had gone. Norris was already faster and getting quicker. It was a case of when Norris would pass him not if. He just made it easier by going off the track. \n\nI know that Ferrari radioed Charles to tell him not to fight Sainz, but in their defence it was the right decision. Sainz was faster and they would have lost time fighting knowing that Norris would be coming back at them in the second stint. It worked for Ferrari. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded them fighting, it would have been Norris‚Äô win if that happened.', ""I mean even if there was a serious issue with the PU or overheating with the breaks, i doubt they would say it on the radio outright. plus if these were indirect team orders charles' expression after the race would let you know. he is not good at hiding his displeasure lol.\n\nmy conspiracy theory is ollie's crash in fp1 and the rebuild after that did more damage than expected."", 'Backmarkers fucked him.

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

I'd love to hear some people's suggestions on how a better rule could be written. It might also be useful to the discussion for others to poke holes in suggested rules, to see how they could be gamed. Maybe ultimately we can come up with something better...

And there's often going to be scenarios that arise where you cannot address them.\n\nTake, for instance, the incident between Verstappen and Norris at Turn 4 in Mexico. Norris was slightly ahead of Verstappen going into the corner. Does that mean that he had completed an overtake? No -- as we have seen on countless occasions, you need to be a good way ahead of another driver to overtake around the outside there. But if Norris had been on the inside of the corner, he would need to be much less further ahead of Verstappen to make that pass work. So straight away we have a corner where the criteria for judging the success of an overtake is different depending on the position of the cars on the track. You can't write a rule to address that, because then you'd have to write a rule to address every position going into every corner on every circuit. And that's before we even consider the presence of Sainz in the Turn 4 incident -- he was going through a slow apex when Verstappen and Norris arrived. Verstappen's choices were a) brake hard, b) hit Sainz, or c) take a more shallow line to avoid contact. He chose the third option, which on balance was probably the best option since braking hard risked a lock-up and hitting Sainz was never an option.\n\nThe vast majority of responses to the proposal of writing rules around overtaking seem to have one thing in mind: creating a scenario were Norris can get ever-so-slightly ahead of Verstappen, and thus requiring Verstappen to immediately concede the position."", 'Both cars stay within track limits. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.', 'The rules should be written in collaboration with the drivers as to what they all agree is most fair and manageable. \n\nThe vast majority of fans have absolutely no idea.

Here is how I see it, I'm open to have my views refuted on this.

  
1. They are arriving in the corner pretty much side-by-side, Lando being slightly ahead, he squeezes Max to the apex.

[https://i.imgur.com/e7nVQmg.png](https://i.imgur.com/e7nVQmg.png)

  
2. They are still side-by-side, Verstappen is almost in the back of the Ferrari, gets squeezed even tighter to the apex, Max starts slightly going wider to avoid driving to the back of the Ferrari.

 [https://i.imgur.com/h3MRdv2.png](https://i.imgur.com/h3MRdv2.png)

  
3. You see Max going wider, otherwise he would've crashed into the back of the Ferrari, you could argue that he went wider to take evasive action into crashing into the Ferrari.

  
[https://i.imgur.com/6OaHFW7.png](https://i.imgur.com/6OaHFW7.png)

  
4. Max stays in the white lines, Lando goes slightly off, is barely outside of the white lines.

[https://i.imgur.com/HoIUhWX.png](https://i.imgur.com/HoIUhWX.png)

  
5. Lando just ignores the track lines completely and takes a sharp right turn.

  
[https://i.imgur.com/bIZhH0g.png](https://i.imgur.com/bIZhH0g.png)

  
6. You can see Lando take even sharper turn to the right to completely cut off the corner to end up ahead of Sainz and Verstappen, but Sainz has the speed advantage and overtakes Norris once again.

I'm not trying to defend anyone here, I just want to understand the penalty better.","[""It's simple. Lando was alongside Max at the apex (less than half a car length alongside). Therefore, according to rules, he's entitled space. Max didn't give it to him and pushed him off. So, by the letter of the rule, Max had to be penalized.\n\nThe Ferrari being there didn't allow Max to divebomb the apex just to be ahead by half a car length at the apex like he did at COTA. After that, if the Ferrari doesn't allow Max to go as fast as he wants, tough luck. It's racing.\n\nThis being said, the being half a car length ahead at the apex rule is total BS. If a car is alongside, that driver deserves space"", ""The key is that, with the way the guidelines are currently, as long as Lando is level with or ahead of Max on the outside, it's Max's responsibility to give him enough room to be able to complete the corner on track.\n\nIn that position, regardless of the Ferrari, Max can't force Lando off the track without getting a penalty.\n\nYou also missed the final step, when Lando gave the position straight back to Sainz ~~and Verstappen~~ because he cut the corner."", '>They are arriving in the corner pretty much side-by-side, **Lando being slightly ahead**\n\nYou answered your own question.\n\nRead the official decision here: [https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Mexico%20City%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%201%20-%20Turn%204%20Forcing%20another%20driver%20of%20the%20track%20(corrected).pdf](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Mexico%20City%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%201%20-%20Turn%204%20Forcing%20another%20driver%20of%20the%20track%20(corrected).pdf)', '""I\'m impartial""    \nProceeds to only phrase things in the most positive way possible to favor Max. ;)  \n\nYou have to keep one thing in mind - Max could have gone at a normal speed into the turn and braked earlier/harder at any point, but he didn\'t - he kept more speed into the turn, that\'s why he was so close to the Ferrari. He\'s not taking evasive actions, he\'s running wide on purpose. Why ? Because he knows Lando is on his outside, and he wants to run him out of road just like he did last week. Except this time, Lando was ahead at the apex, so while he didn\'t get penalised for it last week, this time around he\'s supposed to give him the space, and he didn\'t - on purpose, again, it\'s not like he doesn\'t know how much speed he can carry, or how much angle he can or can\'t give his steering wheel.', '‚ÄúMax goes wide not to crash into the Ferrari‚Äù Really? It‚Äôs called a brake pedal.\n\n‚ÄúLando goes slightly off‚Äù. There is no such thing ad slightly off. Either off or on.\n\n‚ÄúLando ignores track lines completely‚Äù. If Lando had tried to follow the track he would have had to make an even sharper right, which means slowing down more. Pressing the brake on the grass is a major no-no. Could have crashes in either car in front or both. He gave the place back in the end.', 'Very biased interpretion of events for someone ""impartial""\n\n""Max stays in the white lines, Lando goes slightly off, is barely outside of the white lines"" \n\nHe didn\'t just ""go slightly off"" himself, he stayed on track the entire time until Max literally hit him with his car (yes, their front tires touched). Pretty hard to stay on track when someone really doesn\'t want you there.', 'Kind of interesting, if you\'re really unbiased you see this incident in a very different way to myself.\n\nI went back and watched the helicopter cam multiple times and watched the Onboards from Norris and Verstappen because I didn\'t get where you are coming from. And I still don\'t get it.\n\nThere is no ""sqeezing to the apex"". There is always a car\'s width of space on the inside of Norris. If you watch them on the straight before turn 4, it\'s just normal racing. Verstappen stays on the inside to defend. As soon as Norris commits to the outside, Verstappen drifts wide to the middle of the track to get a good entry into turn 4.\n\nMax doesn\'t take any evasive action to avoid the Ferrari. It\'s true to say he has to take the corner normal and can\'t overshoot the apex because Sainz is there. \n\nIn Verstappens Onboard you can see that he judged his approach to the corner perfectly, he doesn\'t even need to wait before getting on the throttle again.\n\nHe simply doesn\'t leave any space on the outside, which he has to do as Norris was in front at the apex. He has to step on the brakes hard for turn 5 to avoid crashing into Sainz, because of his exit out of turn 4.\n\nNorris then just cuts the corner completely because everything else would cost him more than 5 seconds.\n\nYou asked in a comment what Verstappen could have done differenty. He could have left a car\'s width space on the outside. But then he would have lost the position of course because the next turn is a sharp right.\n\nI also tried to judge if Norris would even have made the corner if he would have been given space. But I\'m not sure about that. Maybe, maybe not. We\'ll never know. And from what we learned last week in COTA it doesn\'t even matter because it\'s only important that you\'re ahead at the apex. That\'s the real BS in all of this.', ""I'm no expert in the rules and I don't even have a strong opinion either way, but I'll try to make the case for the penalty:\n\n1. Lando is slightly ahead going into the corner, which (as per the current rules) entitles him to space through the corner\n2. Lando is leaving enough space for Max on the inside (pretty much the normal reacing line, as can be seen by Max basically following Carlos' line into the corner exactly)\n3. Max is boxed in between Carlos in front and Lando on his right. This is a shitty situation for Max but not really uncommon, especially at the start of races. In this case you sometimes just have to brake harder and concede if you don't want to crash into the car in front. Max could have covered the outside on the straight before and Lando would probably go to the inside and be in the same position that Max found himself in.\n4. Max tries to avoid braking by opening the steering and taking a wider line through the corner. If he wants to do that, he still has to make sure Lando has space through the corner. \n5. Obviously I don't know but the track is quite wide and I find it hard to believe that Max wasn't able to take a tighter line, even after opening the steering, that leaves Lando enough space to stay on track. He doesn't do that.\n6. To me, it looks like he doesn't try very hard to tighten his line but is happy with drifting wide because he knows that will make Lando either crash into him or go off track. \n7. Therefore you could argue he pushed Lando off the track even though Lando was (as per the current rules) entitled to space. Thats why the penalty is deserved."", 'Pretty simple.

This is de Zordo's first year, behind a new Principal, and he has delivered the goods with the upgrades Haas has received all year.  Komatsu is doing a great job as principal, but I wanted to shoutout de Zordo too because Komatsu can keep the team organized and all pulling in the same direction, and that's great, but without competent technical direction it's hard to imagine a team going from P10 to P6 with as few resources to work with as Haas has.

With Simone Resta, the relatively well-regarded technical chief from previous years, moving on to greener pastures at Mercedes this year, it would be easy to imagine Haas technical direction taking a step backwards this year.   De Zordo has filled that gap nicely, delivering a very clean set of upgrades that has consistently permitted his team to perform well ahead of the team's median expectations, with nearly every upgrade added to the car resulting in at least a few more points for the team as a whole.  For a team fighting from the back into the midfield, that's an impressive accomplishment.

# The Mexican Grand Prix



**Qualifying:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Max Verstappen

P3. Lando Norris



**Grand Prix:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Lando Norris

P3. Charles Leclerc



***LWIF1‚Äôs Reaction:***

Good lord F1 has been spicy. Unless Red Bull pulls a purple‚Äôn‚Äôblue rabbit outta their butts and manages to unlock a sizeable pace advantage over McLaren AND Ferrari *right now*, I‚Äôd wager we‚Äôre in for ever-increasing spiciness in the closing rounds. Lando‚Äôs WDC bid looks to be losing steam, at least if you consider how the amount of points he needs to gain in each race is growing rather than shrinking. Say what you will about Max‚Äôs boundary-breaking defensive tactics, but they‚Äôre proving effective‚Äîand highlighting how cunning and calculating he is‚Ä¶ Talk about being 10/10 villain.

***Personal highlights from Mexico include:***

* The most action-packed, entertaining, dare I say *cinematic* Mexican Grand Prix in recent memory (and possibly ever?) 
* Carlos Sainz reclaiming his coveted P1 from Max with a classy overtake, then steaming off into the distance, presumably powered by chilis.  
* Contentious (and rather pissy) wheel-to-wheel action through the pack.  
* A double points finish for Haas, vaulting them into P6 in the WCC.  
* And more fuel for the driving standards fiery war of words‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

*The hottest talking point coming out of Austin and Mexico is the latest flare-up about racing standards between drivers (courtesy of Max Verstappen‚Äôs stout defensive maneuvers against Lando Norris).*

*General consensus seems that Max has been toeing the line of how the existing rules and standards are laid out‚Äîbut that said existing rules and standards are part of the problem in not supporting hard and fair racing, while leaving a lot open to the interpretation of drivers and stewards alike.*

*Hence the outpouring of statements about* [*how Austin exposed the flaws in F1‚Äôs driving standards*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9cvfm/how_austin_exposed_the_flaws_in_f1s_driving/)*,* [*calls for a racing regulation overhaul*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)*, and the current rules being* [*a blueprint to dissuade overtaking.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)

*If you‚Äôd like to better understand these mysterious racing regulations,* [*this article courtesy of The Race is your best bet*](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/little-known-new-f1-rules-already-affecting-racing/)*, given the FIA chose not to make their 2024 regulations publicly available, unlike in years gone by.*

*Meanwhile, Mulletman Bottas has taken a simpler view,* [*claiming that some drivers are taking the piss outta the racing regulations‚Ä¶*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbah1i/valtteri_bottas_claims_some_drivers_taking_the_p/) *Fair enough VB!*

*Relatedly‚Ä¶ On the heels of the above, Investigative Redditor* u/stetoe [*put together this brilliant post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/) *compiling all of the F1 rule changes that have occurred since 2016 as a direct result of Max doing Max things.*

*(For those fascinated and eager for a follow up, by popular demand* u/stetoe *cobbled together similar posts as above,* [*but for rules changed due to Lewis Hamilton,*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/) *as well as for* [*the changes triggered by Sebastian Vettel)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/)*.*

***Okay, let‚Äôs move on from the driving standards rabble-babble:***

Fernando Alonso started his 400th Grand Prix in Mexico (pretty impressive for a rookie, if I may say so), [celebrating the occasion with this lovely special lid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8s0xp/fernando_alonso_will_start_his_400th_f1_gp_in/)

In celebration of his time-bending achievement, Young Fernando appeared on F1‚Äôs Beyond The Grid podcast to discuss [why‚Äîand how‚Äîhe‚Äôs still fired up for racing in Formula 1 after 400 races](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga67mt/fernando_at_400_why_alonsos_still_fired_up/) (hint: he might be a vampire).

Thanks to his dynamite opening performances, there‚Äôs a [‚Äúcarambola (which means *lucky chance* in Argentine Spanish) for Franco Colapinto to be on the grid next year.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w9ma/virutasf1_there_is_a_carambola_for_franco/) In order for that to happen though, there‚Äôll have to be driver movement elsewhere on the grid‚Äîas well as sponsors who will have a say.

*Aaaaand apparently* [*Franco has an offer on the table from Red Bull:*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gckaxb/sky_italia_f1_drivers_market_future_of_colapinto/) For which team and seat we know not. The hang-up, of course, is that Williams would have to release or loan Franco to a team they‚Äôve got eyes on competing with soon‚Ä¶ But JV did say the other week that he wants Franco on the grid, regardless if that means Williams loses points as a result. So who knows!

Pundit Lawrence Barretto claims that [‚ÄúValtteri Bottas is in good shape to retain his Sauberaudi seat, but F2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto is still under consideration‚Äù.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gahgbl/lawrence_barretto_i_understand_valtteri_bottas_is/) I say give me another rookie or give me death!

However, returning for another with Sauberaudi isn‚Äôt Valtteri‚Äôs only option, apparently. [Lawrence also reports that Bottas is in talks with Mercedes to return in a non-racing role as a back up](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbamaw/lawrence_barretto_valtteri_bottas_says_his/) (meaning reserve, I presume).¬†

And given we‚Äôre on the Americas leg of the season, the annual [‚ÄúSergio Perez is in trouble and perhaps on his last legs‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gauy46/contract_warning_for_sergio_perez_after_lawson/) rumours are bubbling up from the underworld. I‚Äôll report on them due to his woeful trend of underperformance, but definitely, absolutely, certainly take them a spoonful of salt or two.

*However, his dearth of performance in Mexico won‚Äôt help matters.*

For another rumbling to take with a spoonful of salt (sadly), at Honda‚Äôs ~~incessant pressuring~~ behest, [Yuki Tsunoda seems to be *finally* getting a Red Bull test in Abu Dhabi this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb956m/lawrence_barretto_yuki_tsunoda_says_theres_a_good/) Much as I‚Äôd love to see him have a season in the car, I think we all know this won‚Äôt go anywhere though :(

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

The War of Words between McLaren and Red Bull has been quick to return to boil, with [Lando throwing some shade at Max](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8rtba/but_the_rules_are_the_rules/) (and the FIA). In blithe response, [Max noted that McLaren have been ‚Äúcomplaining a lot lately.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8l92a/mclaren_complain_a_lot_lately_says_verstappen_as/)

Meanwhile, Master Shit-Stirrer [Toto Wolff called Red Bull‚Äôs contentious ride height adjustment device ‚Äúoutrageous‚Äù and laughed at their ‚ÄúBugs Bunny‚Äù tool.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8mzbk/wolff_labels_red_bull_bib_device_outrageous/) In a cantina somewhere in Mexico City, Zak Brown was seen furiously scribbling notes on ‚Äúhow to stir the pot without being labeled a Karen‚Ä¶‚Äù

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

In a move that all fans are sure to hate if this results in what I expect it will, [Duracell has become F1‚Äôs first DRS Zone sponsor in Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8sz6d/duracell_becomes_f1s_first_drs_zone_sponsor_in/) I can hear the calls now‚Ä¶ *‚ÄúMax Verstappen enters the Duracell DRS Zone, which will surely help him stay ahead of Lando Norris for at least one more lap.‚Äù* If this pans out like Tissot‚Äôs sprint race sponsorship in MotoGP, you *will* hear ‚ÄúDuracell‚Äù every time the camera feed moves through this section of track.

If you, like everyone at Mercedes I presume, are tired of the ride height shenanigans of this current generation of cars, [you‚Äôll be thrilled to know that F1‚Äôs 2026 regulations will leave behind the current ride height nightmares.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga76b3/why_f1s_2026_rules_will_shake_off_rideheight/)

Williams and their new partner Mercado Libre (courtesy of Young Gun Franco Colapito) put together [this fun little commercial](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb2gp5/mercado_libre_commercial_revealing_the_new/) revealing their special livery for Mexico and Brazil.

Jokes aside, how do these meetings pan out? What kind of plans do they discuss? Maybe I'm wrong but it must be depressing to discuss different plans when the whole camp must know they will come in pretty much last place. I don't watch DTS but I've followed Williams on and off through periods where they were struggling for many races to get a single point - but at least they were tantalisingly close. With Sauber they seem to be in a much worse situation this season.","['Williams had years where they were in the same position, 2019 was like this.\n\nTheir strategy is likely going to be focused around waiting for safety cars, trying to make the most of potential rain, keeping clean and hoping something big happens up front that helps them luck into points.', ""They're just slow, which boxes them in to strategies that look like they don't work. This is what Sainz said about that kind of situation at the Japanese post-race press conference early this year. For context, if you need it: last year people were saying Ferrari strategy was terrible but this year they improved a lot. \n\n>   **Autosport:** Ferrari seem pretty strategically sharp in this race - it's been something the team's been criticized for a lot in the past - I just wondered could you to expand on any particular work you've seen the team doing and how pleased you feel about that?\n\n>   **Sainz:** I think we made some progress on strategy over the last three years progressively but if you see a jump this year on strategy it's purely down to the car. I think just having a car that allows you to have flexibility on strategy is something that last year we couldn't have, so we were boxed in to stop at certain laps, we couldn't extend, we had so much deg that it looked always like people could extend and then come back on us on a harder tire. Last year we were just zero flexible and we couldn't do anything with our racing so it looked like we were not getting the strategy right a lot of times. But when you have a car that is better on tyres, two drivers that can push on the car more often, and you have that extra flexibility, your strategy also looks better. And with this I'm not underestimating the progress we've done, it's just I really think this helps a lot."", ""Hard to say, I've never been in one"", 'Probably not different than any other team.

Its just the matter of who pits first and who undercuts whom. We dont get to see different strategies or multiple pit stops which shuffle the grid entirely. 

Also, in the recent races we've seen that Max struggles with hards a lot. He drops pace almost a second per lap. Yet his performance on mediums and softs (in qualifying) is on par with Mclaren and Ferrari. Why dont Red Bull try the Med-Med-Soft which might perform better? And even if not, he will still be fast during last few laps and can get the fastest lap points.","['The difference in time between Medium-Hard one stop compared to a Med-Med-Soft two stop needs to be significant enough to overcome the 17-25 seconds lost in the additional pit stop AND have a large enough pace advantage to overtake almost the entire field.', 'Tyres are holding on and keeping good pace, so finding the time for an extra pit stop is very tough. Particularly when the compounds are pretty close.\n\nRed Bull will not find 20 seconds to do that extra stop.', 'Since they scrapped the rule to start on the tire you qualified with, using the Soft tire in the race is just not worth it. They fall off too fast to be useful.', ""Med-Med-Soft would be a two-stop and cause lots of time lost that the other top teams (for the most part) wouldn't lose with the general trend of using one-stop race strategies. Max is on pace with the McLaren and Ferrari on the medium and softs, but that isn't enough to make up for the time lost in a two-stopper if the other top teams choose a one-stop strategy. Essentially, too much time will have been lost for the advantage to be useful."", 'Because the harder compounds generally offer more flexibility in strategy, and as it is now the harder Pirelli compounds are just better ""value"" in terms of the longevity-pace trade-off. \n\nYou can\'t also just consider overall pace on an empty track, on a softer compound every overtake that Max needs to do, as he needed to last race, will take more life out of the tyres.

But given the process of car development in F1, I think Steiner also deserves some credit for the current success.

After making the decision to get young drivers with hefty sponsorship (Mazepin, Mick) in exchange for performance to keep the team afloat during the pandemic years, Steiner pulled the plug on that phase and brought in a veteran duo of Hulk and Mag. At first, I thought it was Haas trying to be competitive right away. Then Steiner made the most difficult decision to, borrowing NBA terms, tank the 2023 season. 

The focus in 2023 then was developing the 2024 car. The vet drivers were brought in not for performance but to give productive feedback. Tanking to last place also got them maximum wind tunnel time, which helped not just in the car's initial development but also in maintaining a steady flow of upgrades for 2024.

It did cost Steiner his job. But now Haas is 6th, and   one would he hard pressed to argue that they would achieve that if Steiner did not make the difficult decision to tank ","['I think he definitely deserves credit for keeping the team alive long enough to survive honestly, but clearly they improved quite a bit once he was gone.\n\nBut obviously we know one person never makes a team, and one person rarely rights the ship.\n\nBut we have seen two team principals come into teams and turn them around pretty quickly, Komatsu and James Vowles.', 'He is likable, has humor, he is a straight shooter. He‚Äôll make a fun commentator.\n\nI don‚Äôt think highly of him as a team principal. He berated his drivers, punched down, played all sorts of politics to make them feel horrible. He always deflected blame. Some engineer, some driver, something always at fault. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Gene the buck stops with me and we will fix it‚Äù, for so many years.\n\nThe second he‚Äôs out, the team‚Äôs communication is healthy, vibrant. The drivers are happy. Points come in. This paints a picture of management having been unable to get the most out of their assets.\n\nI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be around and contribute in fun ways. But I‚Äôm happy with the new Haas.', 'I dont think you need to eulogize his tenure. Gunther has talked about this quite a bit and I dont think he believes he was doing a good job at the end. He said he would have left earlier in hindsight  not that he was trying to set something up he didnt get to see out.', ""Steiner is the right man to get a team up and running from nowhere. He deserves all the credit for that. Both in his RedBull days as in the Haas early days. \n\nOperating with minimum budget to build and motivate and attract the right motivated people willing to put in effort and growth. \n\nBut that is only a 3 year maximum and he needs to be replaced by a proper Team Principal. Matter of fact, he never should have been a Team Principal, he should be a 'Team Builder', and that for a duration of 3 years tops. \n\nMAYBE he can stay on for longer in an advisory role. \n\nApart from that, he really is not the right person. I think he gets too emotional too, and it blinds him and frustrates him, and that ventilated to the rest of the team. \n\nIt's telling Komatsu turned the team immediately around. Steiner MAY have build a base to operate from, but he lacks the skill or refinement to tap into everything. It's clear Komatsu is the better man there, and he has completely pulled everything out of the bag. \n\nI certainly did not expect that, but he did. So Kudos to Komatsu. \n\nI think Steiner also needs to stay far away from interviews and other related stuff. As a Team 'higher up' he was enjoyable to hear talk from time to time and be unleashed, but as a reporter or interviewer, he is just aggravating. I can imagine working for him is.......triggering."", ""That's really wrong, Haas made this thing of sacrificing 2020 and 2021 to focus on the 2022 car that was only good in like 5 races of that year.\n\nWhat Komatsu did was bringing many upgrades that actually work and trying to upgrade the car for each race instead of bringing only 1 or 2 upgrade per year and falling in standings every time at the second half of the season. It's much better to finish a solid P6 than having a good car at the start of the year and not making anything with it and letting everyone outdevelop you to focus on next year's car only to make the cycle repeat.\n\nKomatsu in one year solved the tyre issues that Haas was having since 2019 while Steiner was more interested in being a superstar in DTS."", ""Guenther was probably the only one who could have gotten the team started in the first place as the team structure was his idea and he knew all the right people to make it happen including sponsors. That said there were some issues with his leadership. The main concern was how distant he was from day to day engineering decisions as he primarily was based in the US rather than their hubs in the UK or Italy. He also had to much stuff on his plate as he handled everything management wise from the technical to the boring business details. Komatsu is closer to the engineering operations and has a narrower focus.\n\nAs for the narrative that he created a toxic team environment, it seams to be mostly based on a few DtS clips and some click bait headlines rather than direct sources from inside the team. Magnussen actually said in his book that Haas is the best team environment he has been in and that Guenther was the best boss he had in F1. In Renault he was routinely ignored by Cyril Abiteboul. Yeah Guenther could swear at you sometimes but you always knew exactly where you stood with him which gave a piece of mind that you don't have elsewhere where the bosses would butter you up in one moment and drop you like a hot potato the next.\n\nMagnussen had also criticized McLaren for having a big problem with blame culture and talked about how when Haas had the big pitstop failures in 2018 and the aero issues in 2018, no individual heads rolled for that. Guenther viewed it as organizational failure that was his responsibility to figure out.\n\nAll in all, it was time for him to go but a lot of the narrative that have been build around him isn't grounded in much and he deserves a better legacy than that"", ""You're assuming a lot of things here.\n\nPlus, they only adressed they're main issue under Komatsu's leadership: race pace and tyre deg (during this year preseason).\n\nYou're telling me that Steiner decided to spend the whole 2023 season without addressing a key issue on purpose? lmao\n\nHe was a week TP. His only merit was bringing an F1 team to the grid in 2016, in the way they operate, and before each team being worth billions.\n\nF1 is better without him."", ""Meh, give him credit for making a rational decision?

In Mexico Carlos Sainz did what his teammate had managed a week earlier in Austin. A decisive and deserved victory for the driver from Madrid, who had also taken an always complicated pole position for Ferrari, in a weekend certainly with fewer hitches than Leclerc. Lando Norris got between the two reds, taking away the chance for the Prancing Horse to repeat the one-two. However, a first and a third position remain that have an important weight in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n\nFerrari is now second in the Constructors and is the real anti-McLaren. The consistency of Leclerc and Sainz could be the extra weapon.\n\nThe SF-24 is now the real rival of the English team leading the constructors' championship, with Red Bull completely disappeared and, by Max Verstappen's own admission, never really fighting in recent weeks for the most coveted championship for most of the team owners. Ferrari's recovery could be considered sensational given that in two weekends, the Leclerc-Sainz duo has recovered 46 points on McLaren, now moving into second place at -29 points with four GPs to go. Enrico Cardile's former car has been put back on the right track with the update packages introduced in Monza and Singapore, confirming overseas that the steps forward made are to be considered more than important .\n\n\nIs Ferrari now the best car overall? In Maranello they don't want to hear about it, also because there is the certainty that the Mexican GP would have been much more complicated to win without the important skirmishes between Verstappen and Norris. The latter in fact showed the best race pace after the switch to hard tyres and a certain drop in asphalt temperature while he was certainly slowed down by Max Verstappen in the first part of the race, where Ferrari managed to open up the gap that guaranteed him the victory with Sainz.\n\n\nThe English McLaren driver used the new bottom all weekend, which was not a given at least at the start of the weekend, a sign that the important improvements expected by the Woking team were seen on track in FP2. For his part, Leclerc had to manage a lot, with a continuous lift-and-coast that prevented him from keeping the pace of the Madrid driver also due to the difficulty of keeping the tyres in the optimal window. It should also be underlined that having skipped FP1 and not having been able to work significantly on the set-ups in FP2 , due to the hour and a half dedicated mainly to testing the Pirelli tyres, did not help the Monegasque driver . A Leclerc who already in Austin had adapted more slowly to the new balance generated by a much more flexible front wing than the specification that had debuted in Singapore , and only with the setup changes between the Sprint and Main Race had he found that little something extra that had allowed him to dominate on the American Sunday. In Mexico, the time available was very short for the Monegasque, who entered qualifying almost in the dark regarding the set-up, so much so that he did not perform as well as his teammate.\n\n\nMexico has put to rest any doubts about the progress of SF-24, but will Interlagos close the circle?\n\nNow Ferrari is clearly the anti-McLaren and the gap from the top, after the latest evolutions brought to the SF-24, in certain phases and technical areas seems to have almost disappeared. And so the consistency of the Leclerc-Sainz duo could be the extra weapon in an unexpected, at least until a few weeks ago, chase for the constructors, which has been missing from Maranello since the distant 2008. If the car is able to compete for the victory, it seems more likely that there will be at least two drivers dressed in red on the podium than dressed in orange and this could be a significant advantage. An aspect in which McLaren ‚Äì with the little experience of Piastri and an alternating current Lando Norris ‚Äì and Red Bull ‚Äì with a Perez in free fall ‚Äì are lacking compared to the red driver lineup.\n\n\nAt Interlagos it is very likely that we will see both McLarens equipped with the latest updates, and not just Lando Norris' MCL38, also to try to respond to the hard attack by Ferrari in the last two events. The Brazilian track will close the triptych of consecutive races that began in Austin, and is quite complete given that there are slow sections and also long and medium and high speed support corners, as well as weather that is still to be evaluated, especially for the Sunday race. Red Bull and Max Verstappen left Mexico with very few positives, except for the few points lost by the Dutchman against Norris. However, the RB20 still lacks a lot technically compared to Ferrari and McLaren even after the developments brought to Texas, which have improved the English car in terms of connection between the front and rear axle but have not significantly widened the operating window. This is why we see Max Verstappen constantly racing in defense, clinging to even incorrect maneuvers to ruin his rival's race, favoring in a certain way Ferrari, a clear ally of the three-time world champion. For their part, in Maranello they know they still have a chance in Brazil to give continuity to the best technical moment of the season for the SF-24, with only the Qatar layout that 'scaries'.

On one hand, to give the teams the ability to decide might prevent interference from the race director, allowing everything to be decided on the race track.

On the other hand, rule interpretation is (as we‚Äôve seen the past few races) is quite subjective. Even to decide what it means to be ahead at the apex can be different depending on the frame your looking at. The team or driver might believe they have done everything by the book, unaware of all the data. And to give them the responsibility of deciding if they should give the place back might result in penalties that would have been prevented if they were told to do so, resulting in interference from the outside and sometimes creating an even bigger change in a race result.

What do you think is the best idea for the quality of the race and is there any other possibility besides these two?","['It isn‚Äôt a rule, it‚Äôs a way to avoid a punishment by ensuring the action essentially never took place. I would like if the fia made a decision quicker and asked teams to give up a place rather than waiting half an hour though. \n\nJust push for actual track limits with grass or gravel and the issue is fixed.

Of course, in some cases teams won't accept that they should, or that they have broken the rules, so the stewards will then impose whatever penalty they think is due\n\nThis seems fine to me"", 'Your idea of stewards making the decision and telling the drivers to swap places has one major flaw: It often takes stewards several minutes to analyse the data and decide. By that time the positions on track are likely to be different.', ""I don't get your question? Teams currently decide if they tell the driver to give the place back or not.

Anything that minimizes the influence of the stewards is welcomed. It's like in football when a player is fouled and the team continues attacking as they have a good position and setup and the ref plays an advantage.\n\n\nLike in COTA, if Norris had given the position back,he would still have a chance of overtaking Verstappen in the remaning 4 laps. Intead of that he received a penalty in the last lap.\xa0\n\n\nIf the penalty was instant he would have managed to create a 5 second gap. But the penalty came in the last lap where all he could manage was 4.1.\xa0"", ""Charlie used to give his opinion to the teams on whether they should give the place back or not. In theory I think that's a good idea. The teams get pretty quick feedback on whether or not it was a valid move and they can hand the position back without having to get penalties involved.\n\nThe problem was Charlie as race director could only give his opinion and it might be different to the stewards, and then you get situations like Spa 2008 where a team has been told they're fine only to get a penalty later on.\n\nIn an ideal world the stewards would be able to make a decision much quicker and could tell a driver to give a place back very quickly after the original move to avoid a penalty. That's not really possible though.\n\nI kind of think the current solution is the best of a bunch of flawed options really."", ""I think main issue here is that while the race is ongoing drivers increase gaps between one another, waiting for officials to make a decision takes a long time for something like this; usually the best moment to give place back is right after you 'stole' it, thus giving you more race distance to properly overtake later on. If you only rely on officials ruling and wait 1-2 laps you may pull away too far for the move to be profitable, or the driver you stole place from could lose his position to someone else, meaning that to give place back to them you would be losing to another driver between you as well; or that driver could deliberately/or not pit and create even bigger gap between you, forcing you to get a penalty. Teams usually try to decide as quick as possible right on the spot to avoid these scenarios, and if they think they are right, then thats on them if they end up being wrong."", ""A lot of the penalties are based on whether or not you gained an advantage by your action. Handing the place back just means you can say you didn't, in the end, gain an advantage. \n\nYou should still get a penalty for deliberately forcing other cars off the track, even if you give the place back later, because that's dangerous driving."", ""Ultimately, the stewards can't make a binding decision quickly enough during the race for them to be able to reliably let the teams know in good time.\n\nThe Race Director could give their opinion, as they have done in the past, but that's not binding and the stewards could still investigate and go against RD's opinion.""]",0,26,0.38,0,95,95,0,0,0.0,0

F1 spending: stop or continue?
In the midst of all this, of course, the relevance of the Audi F1 project seems very strange. With the economic situation of the Volkswagen group having deteriorated over the last two years, the arrival of the brand with the rings in Formula 1 is once again weakened. Audi has nevertheless done everything to ensure its arrival in 2026, in particular with the 100% acquisition of the Sauber group at the beginning of the year . Since the announcement in 2022, millions ‚Äì if not billions ‚Äì of euros have been invested in the construction of new buildings in Neuburg-on-the-Donau and in the recruitment of several hundred people to develop the 2026 engine.

Expenses already incurred, already spent, which place Audi and the Volkswagen group in a complex situation and in a terrible dilemma. Should the project continue, assume the colossal sums already invested (and which still have to be invested) in a context of unprecedented budgetary rigor on a group scale, to the detriment of thousands of jobs at VAG? Or should the tap be turned off as quickly as possible, ""sold"" the project to save what can be saved with a few million at stake - which obviously will not reimburse everything that has already been committed since 2022 - and try to reduce as much as possible the scale of the social plan that is being prepared in Germany?

Of course, Volkswagen could use the popularity of Formula 1 as a huge advertising spot and as a last (desperate?) attempt to revive its global sales, especially in Asia. The group had notably bet heavily on the Chinese market, but the strategy turned into a fiasco. Far from us the desire to revive unfounded rumors, we could then say to ourselves that a Guanyu Zhou could be the best advertisement for Audi and the Volkswagen group in order to give themselves a last chance on the Chinese market, the driver from Shanghai - the first and only Chinese driver in Formula 1 - enjoying incredible popularity in the Middle Kingdom. A reflection which could notably explain why Audi is taking so long to choose its second driver for 2025...

They are bland, boring, uninteresting cars that attract nobody and no one, except a handful of lease drivers. If the chinese market would do well, they should have kept it china-only.\n\nThey're expensive platforms that don't really work. \n\nAs a comparison, the last GTI was a fantastic car, not the newest, but the one before. It really worked, it looked the part, it drove the part, and was/is fast. The GT-E is quite frankly also a very good hybrid solution, that should have been had more emphasis by VW. The GTE was bland, too small of a range, and lacked all spirit. \n\nThe ID models 'should' have done a better job, but instead, they're just that, bland and boring.

So in the WCC standings and thus prize money, it won't make a difference either. \n\nF1 is a prototype series, which makes it vastly different to a GP3 cup series for example. If you run a private team, in a cup car series for example, and you buy a F.E. a Lamborghini, and you buy all the parts, and you don't actually make them yourself, or design it yourself, then yes, if you wreck a car, that's gonna be costly, because you now need to order/buy new parts.

But that has been calculated in by their accountants, which is why they buy the parts and don't manufacture them. Interestingly enough, this also lowers the costs for Ferrari as they get to make parts not only for them, but also sell them to other teams. VCARB is a good example here if they use RBR parts from the year before. \n\nSo to be honest, they're really throwing a lot of nonsense out."", 'Sargeant is still the champ.', ""But then where do you draw the line? if new parts are allowed to be produced without impacting the cost cap.

It was quite striking that Max has benefited a lot more from this. Perez took 7 points off Lando early in the season, thanks to the sheer dominance of the Red Bull, the extent of which we‚Äôve not seen replicated by McLaren later in the season. 

Oscar‚Äôs impact is the more interesting one. He‚Äôs pretty much only taken points off Max when he‚Äôs also taken points from Lando. He‚Äôs actually been a detriment to Lando. This is surprising as you would expect the McLaren to be able to deliver 1-2‚Äôs. I attribute this to a few no show weekends from Oscar leading to missed opportunities (Zandvoort, Singapore and Mexico) and Lando not having the same dominance over his teammate as Max. 

I still think we could see this trend start to reverse in the run-in. When you look at the McL‚Äôs dominance over Red Bull since summer break (notwithstanding Austin weekend), then there should be potential for Oscar to slot in between Max and Lando, also noting that McL have indicated they will use team orders.

Hope you find that interesting and welcome any thoughts ","['Sergio points from Max: 0', 'Arguably this kinda highlights the reasons why max will win the WDC and why McLaren will win the WCC (Sergio took no points off max, mostly due to spending most of his time racing haas and VCARB; McLaren on the other hand lost out on WDC points, but have (for the most part) 2 drivers instead of 1)', ""Perez didn't take points off Max but he could/should have taken more off Lando"", ""Just to add to the analysis though: in the case of McLaren, the other variables. It is not enough just to have a second car that could potentially finish up and down the grid, the team has to enable that, which McLaren has been uniquely very poor at doing. I'd love to know what Oscar could have done position-wise if the team was able to execute double-stack pit stops, etc. McLaren was resolute in not coordinating strategies to benefit Lando but could have positioned both better (read: ahead of Max) with a more thoughtful approach. And of course a better start to the season would have made a difference too: if a team is intent on not having a number one driver, they cannot let that driver start the year flat footed compared to the competition.

Even looking at the USA GP and Mex GP: multiple drivers we're penalized for forcing a driver off track or leaving the track and gaining an advantage, but at COTA all penalties were 5 sec. Now, Max got 10 sec (while I don't dissagree with the severity, it is inconsistent). Even within the Mexico GP: Max got 10 seconds for forcing Lando off track in Turn 4, being the defending car, whereas Perez got nothing for basically doing the same to Lawson as the overtaking car in the same corner.\n\nThat said, as for Max specifically: He is just smart. He simply knows how to use the rules to his advantage, even if that means making a 'smart foul'. Sportmanslike? Maybe not. But as long as it benefits him in terms of results (or it doesn't really hurt him in the worst case scenario), I think he will continu to exploit the regulations where it indeed is beneficial to him. And others at some point will follow his lead. You already saw drivers racing to the apex as they noticed Max did it effectively and gained an advantage by just racing to the apex.\n\nUnless this is more structurally adressed in a way where these 'fouls' do not result in a benefit (which can never be completely eliminated, but could be addressed better than this), I doubt things will change very much.\n\nI also think the penalty point race ban is pretty useless. With the exception of Magnussen (who really took the piss with the regulations on some occasions), this has never been applied. Perhaps a better approach could be to penalize repeat offenders more harshly. Forcing a driver off track? 5 seconds penalty. Do it again next week? 10 seconds. Third time? Drive through. This way you leave open the possibility of people making unintential mistakes and not having to penalize them hard, but you can impose more harsh penalties to those trying to use the regulations including limited penalties to their advantage.\n\nI also still think grid penalties should be a thing.

You would‚Äôve never guessed it would happen to either of these teams. Hamilton to Ferrari is looking like another McLaren to Mercedes move.\xa0', '-Q: Did the team get useful data comparing the old spec and the upgraded one?\xa0\n\n\nA: Again, the updates brought the performance that was expected. What they didn\'t get was a clean run in clear air, Lewis had a balance issue in stint 1 (info: Lewis said he took too much front wing out before the race, which gave him understeer. They corrected that during the pit stop) and George had a broken front wing in stint 2 plus traffic for both drivers.\xa0\n\n\n-Q: How did George damage his front wing ?\n\n\nA: Happened during an overtake when the car hit a bump in the middle of the track at full speed (with DRS on, the front wing drops more as there\'s less load on the car). He lost a lot of aero balance and had a lot of understeer.\xa0\n\n\n-Q: With the team\'s position set in the Constructors, what will the next races be like?\xa0\n\n\nA: Good opportunity for experimenting for 2025, doing setup work, testing items and small bits of bodywork, but no more major upgrades.\xa0\n\n\n-Q: Will George have the repaired upgrades in Brazil?\n\n\nA: It\'s the plan, lot of work going on at the factory at the moment, the new floor should be on its way now and they\'re confident it\'ll be ready.\n\n\n-Q: What are the expectations for Brazil?\xa0\n\n\nA: They think McLaren and Ferraei will be ""very difficult opposition"" given how strong they\'ve been in slow corners recently (crucial for sector 2 in Brazil). Shovlin says a podium would be a great result for them.\xa0', 'That explains a LOT about why Lewis couldnt get by george. The wing didnt break, it folded to its low df config. The understeer is one issue but it would really impact you into the corners. On the straights hes going to be quicker. Probably makes it a bit harder.

Mercedes had the same thought in Brazil 2021 and requested a right of review on the ground of the forward facing onboard and the 360 camera.

He also said he promised to help Lando. Understandable, too. \n\nHe's put himself in a great spot though to take himself out of the immediate line of fire with Lando behind him. Lando, Charles and Max all will go into T1 with the knife between their teeth. All Oscar has to do is have a good start and avoid one sending it inside, you can't go around here in T1. Then the three behind him will have to sort themselves out. \n\nThe only thing is, Norris usually loses his P1 pole in the first lap and first corners, but when he not starts from pole, he generally starts pretty well and then starts gaining momentum. \n\nWhat I expect is that at T1, Piastri will have a decent start, Norris will have a decent start, Charles will have a better start, and Max will have a good start. Max will be forced to brake to not hit Lando, Charles might send one inside Lando and could touch wheels, sending Lando off-track (to the right), and then Max has to avoid and follow, then they'll rejoin the track behind Carlos, and Lando will have to defend from Max, whilst Piastri heads off into the distance, Charles will be P2 with Sainz behind, but will get a 5-second penalty for forcing another driver off track. \n\nIt's really bad news for Lando because he finds himself in a troublesome situation. He was faster all day and faster in the last Q lap until he made some errors, if (IF) his final Q lap went without those messups, he would have been on Pole by an even bigger margin, which would have been perfect for him.\n\nThat way, he would have started P1, and could have had Piastri in a tactic to 'block' Leclerc and Max, and told NOT to overtake Lando unless he has a clear problem. It would put Piastri in a hard situation, as Piastri would have to fight Charles quite a lot, but give Lando some breathing. The Mclarens really come alive after a few laps so I think LeClerc would find himself being beaten by Piastri after a few laps anyway, however, IF Charles passes, that means Verstappen is right there behind him, and Max is gonna divebomb. \n\nUnfortunately for Lando, him being P2, really puts him into the position, that it's gonna be Oscar that's gonna drive off, and find himself lodged between Charles, which he can overtake, but has to meanwhile defend from Max, whom WILL divebomb, and i think T4 is the place where the action will happen."", 'Here comes the complaining that he dare beat lord Norrison Duke of skyf1', 'Piastri is the Sainz of Mclaren, gets beaten like 5 times in a row then manages to chef once', ""When he gets more consistent at qualifying he is going to be an absolute force to be reckoned with.

1gizowv,Let's Talk Lewis Hamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gizowv/lets_talk_lewis_hamilton/,2024-11-03, Discussion,"As the title says, Hamilton‚Äôs performance this season has been the massive elephant in the room, and it‚Äôs hard to ignore the fact that he‚Äôs been consistently outpaced by Russell ‚Äì especially in races. This is unprecedented for Hamilton, who‚Äôs never struggled this much against a teammate throughout his entire career. While the qualifying head-to-head in 2022 ended 13-9 to Lewis and was tied 11-11 in 2023, this year‚Äôs standings are a shocking 5-16 in Russell‚Äôs favor. Russell is an incredible driver, easily one of the best on the grid imo, but given Hamilton's strong performances over the past two years, it‚Äôs strange to see him suddenly struggling so much compared to his teammate ‚Äì especially considering his near-win (or win, depending on who you ask) against Verstappen in 2021.

Here‚Äôs what I wanted to discuss, especially for those who race, simrace, or just have a solid understanding of car balance and behavior (and F1TV to watch onboards): isn‚Äôt it *painfully* obvious that Lewis‚Äôs car suffers from a **serious** lack of rear-end stability? And this is not only relative to Russell's car but to every other car on the grid, including the Sauber and Williams (yes, the Mercedes produces more downforce, but I‚Äôm talking specifically about balance). Hamilton‚Äôs car control masks a lot of this instability, making it look somewhat drivable, but you can see him battling unpredictable oversteer almost every corner, no matter the track or conditions. He‚Äôs lacking traction and experiencing high surface temperatures during races because of it, creating a vicious cycle with a car that feels like it ""wants you in the wall."" Bono is constantly warning him about rear surface temps, which is surprising given Hamilton's reputation for having some of the best tire management the sport has ever seen ‚Äì and none of these issues were present over the last two years. When I compared the Mexico GP onboards from 2022 to 2024, his car handled with decent stability in 2022 (still a little tricky), but in 2024 it resembles something closer to a RUF CTR Yellowbird.

Hamilton's Mercedes this year is the most unbalanced car of the three Mercs since the start of the ground-effect era, yet Russell‚Äôs rear-end stability has improved from 2022 and especially 2023. I genuinely believe there‚Äôs a difference between the two cars, though I don‚Äôt think Mercedes is doing this behind Hamilton‚Äôs back. In Monaco, Hamilton said openly to the media that he‚Äôd be two-tenths behind Russell at minimum and didn‚Äôt see himself out-qualifying him for the rest of the year ‚Äì and his expression hinted he wasn‚Äôt allowed to explain why. It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if there‚Äôs a mutual understanding or contractual obligation between Hamilton and the team for him to run experimental upgrades or setups (like the first half of 2022) to aid in development. This setup has two benefits for Mercedes, especially since they‚Äôll lose several sponsors with Hamilton‚Äôs move to Ferrari. In that case, having Russell perform well could help attract and entice sponsors to keep cash flowing into the team.

I don‚Äôt believe Hamilton and his engineers have suddenly forgotten how to set up the car, and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs washed ‚Äì his car control is still incredible when you watch him try to tame this beast. The rear-end instability might have complex causes, and I‚Äôm open to theories, but it‚Äôs a pattern that‚Äôs hard to overlook. What do you guys think?

This is my conclusion, taking any major good or bad luck the driver got into the equation 

Bahrain: Red Bull 

Saudi: Red Bull

Australia: Mclaren

Japan: Red Bull

China: Red Bull

Miami: Mclaren

Imola: Close, would lean Mclaren

Monaco: Close, would heavily lean Mclaren

Canada: Close

Spain: Close, would heavily lean Mclaren

Austria: Close, would lean red bull 

Silverstone: Mclaren

Hungary: Mclaren

Spa: Mclaren 

Zandvoort: Mclaren

Monza: Mclaren

Baku: Red Bull 

Singapore: Mclaren

Austin: Mclaren

Mexico: Mclaren

Brazil: Mclaren

Races i took luck into account was Miami which was close put safety car pushed me over the edge, Spa with Max‚Äôs grid penalty, Baku with Lando‚Äôs bad luck with yellow flag and Brazil, i think red bull were faster in those conditions, but Max‚Äôs bad luck with red flag and grid penalty.

So the way I see it, there‚Äôs 5 races Max clearly had the advantage, 11 races where Lando clearly had the advantage. 

And then a few races where I think Lando had a slight advantage but ultimately they were close.

After 21 races, the fact that Lando is 62 points behind Max is insane.

A combination of Mclaren clownery, Lando bottling, Lando having a competitive teammate and Max being an absolute beast, has led to one of the most insane cases of the faster car losing.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even debatable that Lando hasn‚Äôt had the clear car advantage this season. While I don‚Äôt root for Lando to win the WDC, I do hope next season goes better for him because unless a miracle happens, this year is going to weigh heavily on him as a what could have been

What are the safety implications of doing it - has to enough water to make it wet enough for inters I guess or it\'s a waste of time? \n\nAnd how much water do they need to deploy to make it practical.

1gh9ltk,Engine Penalty Question on Sprint Weekend,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gh9ltk/engine_penalty_question_on_sprint_weekend/,2024-11-01, Discussion,"
Trying to understand the rules and penalties better. 

If Max is taking a new engine, will he have it only for the Quali/GP or all weekend including the Sprint? 

If he's using it for the whole weekend, does Max's engine Penalty apply to the sprint and the GP or just the latter?

I'm thrown off by the Sprint aspect. ","['In a **Sprint Weekend** format, such as the **Brazilian Grand Prix** this weekend, the way engine penalties work is indeed a bit different due to the additional Sprint event. Here‚Äôs how it generally applies:\n\n1. **New Engine Usage**: If a driver like Max takes a new engine (or any other power unit component) that exceeds the allowed allocation, he will receive a **grid penalty**.\n2. **Where the Penalty Applies**:\n   * **Grid Penalties** for power unit changes (e.g., taking a new engine) **only apply to the main Grand Prix** on Sunday, not the Sprint.\n   * This means if Max takes a new engine, he would receive a grid drop for the starting position of Sunday‚Äôs Grand Prix, but he can still start the Sprint race in the position he qualifies in Sprint Shootout.\n3. **Sprint Race Effect**:\n   * The Sprint event is treated as a separate race with its own qualifying session (Sprint Shootout) and is not affected by power unit penalties in terms of grid position.\n   * Therefore, any penalty Max incurs for the new engine would **not impact his Sprint starting position**‚Äîit only impacts his grid position for the Grand Prix on Sunday.\n\nTo summarise, if Max takes a new engine this weekend, the **penalty only affects the starting grid for Sunday‚Äôs Grand Prix** and does not impact his starting position for the Sprint race. The Sprint results themselves also do not influence the grid for Sunday, as the main Grand Prix grid is set by the qualifying session held on Friday.', 'The penalty applies to his Grand Prix qualifying position. The engine goes into his overall pool and is thus available for every session from the moment of its introduction.', 'Penalty is given to the race not the sprint race', 'Just the GP. It used to apply to the sprint before when it was Quali - SQ - Sprint - Race but now Sprint is no longer in Parc Ferme, meaning you can change your setups after the sprint too. Sprint is just a more entertaining FP with points.', 'Can‚Äôt penalise him for both races as that‚Äôs a double penalty and giving it to him for the sprint race where there isn‚Äôt as many points on offer would be unfair to those that take the penalty during non sprint race weekends', ""He will have the new engine for any sessions that he wants it for this weekend, and the penalty will only be for the grand prix. There being a sprint doesn't change anything. He'll definitely run the new engine for the sprint. He probably used it for free practice as well (haven't watched) but he could have used an old one for free practice if he wanted to."", 'Thanks GPT', 'This email could have been a sms', 'Appreciate the explanation!

Lando was saying the decision to pit or not was a matter of luck ‚Äì not that Max‚Äôs whole race happened due to luck. His words are being misrepresented, I feel, due to a lack of context with the circulating media.

Check post race interviews ‚Äì George, Esteban, Max understood the value of staying out on the difficult intermediates. For Lando to call that luck is still unfair, I feel.

I realize every track is different and Haas will likely not get to the points in every race for the rest off the season but their upward trend seems obvious. I do not have a deep technical understanding but a lot of people seem to view the 2025 season as an extension of 2024 when it comes to car development due to no rule changes and the maturity of the current rule set. Based on that Haas is probably in a better position for next year than they have been in at least 5 years.

Back to Ocon. On the face of it, he had a horrible season. He lost the power battle within Alpine to his arch rival, was publicly demoted to nr 2 and then announced not to be extended. It seems like he was lucky that Haas offered him a seat at all (although i personally believe he is a solid choice and deserves a seat in F1). In previous years, a change from Alpine/ Renault to Haas would have been a strong demotion, but since this year it is actually a bit of a promotion?! Haas has more than 3x the points of Alpine and the whole saga around the Alpine engine does not seem like they will calmly work to improve the car again?

Long story short: Did Ocon lose his seat to luck into a significantly better team next year? Sort of the reverse Sainz?","['Getting your hopes up for HAAS crushing it next season is a good way to get hurt.', ""Ocon was actively trying to leave Alpine. They basically announced they were not extending a driver who didn't want to extend with them in the first place. \n\nI'd say, probably, from his point of view just getting away from Alpine was a win. Haas performing better than Alpine is just a nice bonus."", 'Never completely trust Haas.', 'Not sure what to think about Ocon and Alpine. I mean alpine let him go and Monaco was probably a good excuse at that but reports were that Ocon had been shopping around even before the 2024 season started. \n\nI really would like to know what happened between Ocon and Alpine because he got a 3 year contract in 2021 and things seemingly were on the up. I think Ocon was just glad to get out of Alpine and the relationship has clearly suffered. \n\nHe even said very recently that he‚Äôs lost enjoyment for racing and is just going through the motions at this point. Alpine themselves have lost out on, in my opinion, the best midfield pairing on the grid. Gasly and Ocon are two drivers who I‚Äôd want if I was leading a team in the midfield and I‚Äôm not sure if Doohan is really a great replacement but we can only see until he‚Äôs in that car. \n\nBack to the original point, Haas are doing well and Komatsu has done a great job however we don‚Äôt know whether that will correlate to next year. They‚Äôre on a good trajectory but they also were in 2018 and then produced a car that was a tyre shredder in 2019. If Haas continue to be on a good trajectory and produce a car that starts challenging the top 4 teams then yes, Ocon is a huge winner out of all of this.', 'Trusting in Haas not to cock it up is quite brave', 'Three teams on the grid you must never trust even if they show form and signs of having gotten their shit together:\n\n1. Ferrari\n\n2. McLaren \n\n3. Haas', ""If Haas can keep this trajectory going then I'd say he's the winner of silly season, not just one of. It'll be the definition of failing upward.\n\nBig if though but Alpine aren't going anywhere positive either."", 'The midfield is forever in flux.\n\nAlpine‚Äôs said their 2025 car is completely different, and the upgrades they brought at COTA are part of their 2025 development. They‚Äôre taking home a lot of windtunnel time as well to develop their car. They‚Äôre also taking the Merc engine for 26, which is supposedly the best available for those reg‚Äôs.\n\nHaas is having a really good year this year. But we don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll further progress for next year, if they‚Äôll slip back, or stay the same. They‚Äôre having less windtunnel time than they‚Äôre used to next year.\n\nCould be either of them, and then it could all change again for 26. Personally I‚Äôd bet on Alpine long term out of the two. \n\nI also think there‚Äôs security in Gasly‚Äôs position (being the only french thing left in the french national team) which should help him extend if he doesn‚Äôt get other offers. Meanwhile Ocon is more vulnerable to this being his last contract by not having those kind of ties, plus Merc who he‚Äôs tied to has passed him over once again.', 'A lot of people down playing haas. As a fan since day one I am feeling Komatsu leadership and the Toyota partnership could lead a revival to top of the mid field, and maybe a fluke podium next year.']",159,81,0.89,159,1101,1101,4,0,0.0,4

Incident: Hamilton cut the chicane while battling Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, allowing him to overtake. He let R√§ikk√∂nen back past but immediately overtook him again at the next corner.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified that if a driver gains an advantage by leaving the track, they must not only give back the position but also ensure they do not retain any lasting advantage. Immediate re-overtaking or benefiting from a better position due to going off-track is prohibited. This clarification aimed to ensure fairness in racing duels.

**2. Emphasis on Honesty with Officials**

Race: 2009 Australian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton and his McLaren team were found to have provided misleading information to the stewards regarding an incident under the safety car involving Jarno Trulli. Initially, Hamilton told the stewards he did not deliberately let Trulli pass, leading to Trulli's penalty. Later, radio transmissions revealed that Hamilton had been instructed to let Trulli pass.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the requirement for absolute honesty in all communications with the stewards. Providing misleading information resulted in more severe penalties, including disqualification.

**3. Ban on Excessive Weaving to Defend Position**

Race: 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton weaved multiple times on the straight to break the tow from Vitaly Petrov, who was attempting to overtake. This was deemed dangerous and unsportsmanlike.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rules on defensive driving, stating that drivers are allowed only one move to defend their position per straight and prohibiting excessive weaving to impede another car. This was introduced to enhance safety and ensure fair competition during overtaking maneuvers.

~~**4. Restrictions on Helmet Design Changes**~~


~~Implemented: 2016 Season~~

~~Incident: Hamilton frequently changed his helmet designs, making it harder for fans, commentators, and officials to identify drivers quickly.~~

~~Rule Change: The FIA introduced a rule starting in 2016 limiting drivers to one helmet design per season, with exceptions for special occasions. This aimed to improve driver recognition.~~

(*Edit: as pointed out by several users, the rule on helmet restrictions was primarily driven by the actions of Sebastian Vettel, rather then Hamilton*)

**5. Reinforcement of Pit Entry and Exit Regulations**

Race: 2018 German Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton aborted a pit stop entry by cutting across the grass to rejoin the track, crossing the pit entry line, which was against the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced existing rules prohibiting crossing the pit entry and exit lines, emphasizing safety concerns. Drivers must commit to the pit entry once they cross the commitment line and cannot rejoin the track. This clarification ensured consistent enforcement of pit lane regulations.

**6. Podium Attire Regulations and Political Messaging**

Race: 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore a T-shirt on the podium that read ""Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor,"" highlighting social justice issues.

Rule Change: The FIA updated podium and pre-race regulations to prohibit drivers from wearing clothing with political or personal statements during official activities. Drivers must wear their race suits fully zipped up during podium ceremonies and official interviews. The aim was to maintain political neutrality during official events.

**7. Jewelry Ban Enforcement**

Race: 2022 Miami Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore jewelry, including piercings and necklaces, while driving, despite existing regulations prohibiting jewelry for safety reasons.

Rule Enforcement: The FIA decided to strictly enforce the existing ban on wearing jewelry during competition, requiring drivers to remove all jewelry before sessions. This emphasized safety concerns, as jewelry can hinder medical procedures or pose additional risks during accidents.
 

**8. External Assistance Rule Change**

(*suggested by /u/EndiKopi*)

Race: 2007 European Grand Prix


Incident: During the race, Lewis Hamilton crashed and required assistance to be lifted back onto the track using a tractor.

Rule Change: Following this incident, the FIA changed the rules regarding external assistance during races. Drivers are prohibited from receiving outside help (such as tractors or other vehicles) to get back onto the track after a crash. Any external assistance provided during a race would result in penalties, emphasizing that drivers must recover on their own or with help from their team within the pit lane.


- - - 

It's interesting to note that despite his 18 years driving in Formula 1 (so far), it looks like only three rule changes or clarifications have been made solely as a result of Lewis Hamilton's driving.

I thought it'd be fun to do a deep dive on what changes and clarifications had to be made solely because of him:

*edit: added rule changes 11, 12 and 13, thanks to those who pointed them out!*

*edit: several people requested I make a similar list for Lewis Hamilton. I'll post it tomorrow.*

- - - 

**1. Minimum Age Requirement for F1 Super Licence**

Race: -

Incident: Max Verstappen was signed by Toro Rosso for the 2015 season at just 16 years old, making his F1 debut at 17 years and 166 days‚Äîthe youngest driver in Formula 1 history.

Rule Change: The FIA introduced new Super Licence requirements effective from the 2016 season. Drivers must be at least 18 years old to be eligible, have accumulated at least 40 points over the previous three seasons in specified lower categories, and have completed a minimum number of kilometers in testing, along with holding a valid road driver's licence.

**2. The ""Verstappen Rule"" ‚Äì Moving Under Braking**

Race: 2016 Japanese Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen aggressively defended against Lewis Hamilton by moving under braking into the chicane, forcing Hamilton to take evasive action.

Rule Change: The FIA prohibited drivers from changing direction under braking in a way that could cause an avoidable collision. Drivers must not move unpredictably or change direction under braking when defending, and must leave at least one car's width between their own car and the edge of the track when defending.

**3. Expansion of the ""Verstappen Rule"" ‚Äì Dangerous Defensive Maneuvers**

Race: 2016 Belgian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen made aggressive defensive moves against Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, including moving under braking and weaving on straights, leading to safety concerns.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rule to penalize any dangerous defensive maneuvers. Drivers are not allowed to make more than one change of direction to defend a position. Any movement that impedes another driver in a dangerous manner is prohibited, and stewards were given increased authority to penalize unsportsmanlike conduct.

**4. Use of Alternate Lines and Track Limits**

Race: 2017 United States Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen for third place on the final lap by going off-track and cutting inside the track limits at Turn 17.

Rule Clarification: The FIA provided clarifying definitions of track limits and enforced consistent penalties. The track is defined by the white lines; drivers must keep at least one wheel within these lines at all times. Overtaking or gaining a lasting advantage by leaving the track is prohibited. Stewards were instructed to apply penalties uniformly for track limit violations.

**5. Driver Conduct and Physical Altercations**

Race: 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After a collision with Esteban Ocon, Verstappen confronted and physically pushed Ocon multiple times in the FIA weigh-in area.

Rule Change: The FIA strengthened regulations against unsportsmanlike conduct off the track. Drivers must conduct themselves professionally and with respect. Physical altercations can result in penalties such as community service, fines, or suspension, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the sport's integrity.

**6. Formation Lap Overtaking Clarification**

Race: 2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton during the formation lap before the race start.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified rules regarding formation lap conduct. Drivers must maintain their grid positions during the formation lap unless a car is delayed leaving the grid. Overtaking is only permitted if a car is delayed and others cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. Procedures were clarified to ensure all drivers understand acceptable behavior before the race start.

**7. Clarification on Forcing a Driver Off-Track**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen defended his position by pushing Lewis Hamilton wide at Turn 4, causing both cars to leave the track.

Rule Clarification: The FIA issued clearer guidelines on overtaking and defending. If an overtaking car is significantly alongside, the defending driver must leave at least one car's width of space. Drivers must not deliberately force another driver off the track. Detailed criteria were provided for stewards to assess incidents consistently.

**8. Technical Regulations on Rear Wings and Parc Ferm√©**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After qualifying, Verstappen touched and inspected Hamilton's rear wing in parc ferm√© conditions.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules regarding parc ferm√© conditions. Drivers and team personnel are prohibited from touching or examining rival cars during parc ferm√©. Strict penalties, including fines and sporting penalties, can be applied for violations. Security measures were enhanced, with increased monitoring and enforcement.

**9. Double Yellow Flag Compliance**

Race: 2021 Qatar Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen failed to sufficiently slow down for double-waved yellow flags during qualifying.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the importance of yellow flag compliance. Stricter penalties were introduced for Verstappen's failing to respect yellow flags.

**10. Brake Testing and Sudden Deceleration**

Race: 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen braked suddenly in front of Hamilton while attempting to let him pass, leading to a collision.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules against dangerous driving behaviors. Sudden deceleration or ""brake testing"" that endangers other drivers is strictly prohibited. Procedures for safely yielding positions were clarified, including proper communication protocols between teams and race control. Stricter penalties were introduced to deter such actions.

**11. Restrictions on Post-Race Celebrations and dangerous driving over the Finish Line**
 
(*edit - suggested by /u/SomewhereAlarmed9985)*

Race: 2021 Styrian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen slowed down and performed burnouts or drifted over the finish line to celebrate his victory, which was deemed potentially dangerous.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced regulations prohibiting dangerous driving after the chequered flag, including burnouts and drifting over the finish line. Drivers are required to proceed safely to parc ferm√© after finishing the race. Post-race celebrations must not endanger other drivers, marshals, or spectators.

**12. Safety Car Restart Procedure Change**

Race: 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen often drew alongside the car ahead during safety car restarts, notably during the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where he pulled alongside Lewis Hamilton before the restart.

Rule Change: The FIA updated the safety car restart procedures:
Drivers must remain in a single line without overlapping until the race resumes.
Overtaking or drawing alongside another car before crossing the start/finish line after the safety car has pulled into the pits is prohibited.
Drivers cannot gain an advantage by positioning themselves alongside the car ahead during a restart.


**13. Clarification of Pitlane Exit Rules**

(*edit- suggested by user /u/Buffythedragonslayer)

Race: 2023 Monaco Grand Prix

Incident: During the race, Max Verstappen appeared to cross the pit exit line when rejoining the track, leading to controversy over whether he violated the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA tweaked the pitlane exit rules to clarify that drivers must not cross any part of their car over the pit exit line when rejoining the track. The updated rule specifies that touching or crossing the line with any part of the car constitutes a violation.

It's interesting to note that aside from the Pitlane Exit rule in 2023, the last rule change or clarification directly attributed to Verstappen's actions was in 2021.","[""This is a fascinating read!

What do you think is the more impressive out of Max‚Äôs two insane grid crawls in the wet?

Both generational drives. Both proving what Max was capable of. 

I think as an isolated drive, 2024 has it. To actually win it, to do it in such a manner that seemed effortless and 20 seconds on the rest of the grid.

But I think 16 was more impressive / shocking because of the context of Max being a 19 year old and still being spoken about as someone ‚Äúwith potential‚Äù - it‚Äôs far more impressive for a teenager to do that a 27 year old, established generational talent.

Not suggesting anything malicious from Oscar, they were all doing their best  just to keep it on the black stuff, Max had the magic in those conditions, Oscar, Lando and others didn't and that is fair enough, crazy brave from all of them just to get out there and entertain us in the first place.

It got me thinking though, does ANY driver EVER actually want their teammate to be WDC?

I see no benefit to your teammate becoming WDC whatsoever, all it really does is fill your teammate with confidence *AND* increases the bargaining power of your teammate for future favourable treatment *(oh, only one of the new and improved front wing? As the reigning WDC I'll have that thanks...*), I mean, having a teammate beat you to the WDC is a lousy outcome for your own racing career right, so the smart move is to play it like Oscar mostly has this year. Pay lip service to helping, maybe try to assist once or twice in a high profile way just to get the team and the public off your back, but ultimately, do what you can to be of as little assistance as possible.

The one exception might be when you are a designated number 2 in the pecking order like Barrichello with Schumi or Perez with Max, in that case, being of as much assistance as possible might extend your own career which maximises your time to compete for podiums and occasional wins (but not championships). For example, I'm sure that Perez's efforts in AD21 probably bought him an extra year or two in that RBR that he otherwise wouldn't have gotten.

","['I think people underestimate how difficult that move is that Max constantly did in turn 1.', ""TBF, it was pointless for Oscar to defend against Max who was lapping more than a second than him.

Getting passed by Max that easily does his own race no good and reduces his standing with McLaren.\n\nThe best he can do to uphold his standing in the team is defend hard and drive fast.

I\'m only sharing this to point out how this ""trick"" is very difficult to prove and it\'s unlikely we would get ""proof"" in the first place without a fuck up from McLaren, assuming they were doing it:\n\n> I would assume the water is introduced as a vapour. The tyre is a warmed and sealed environment, so it is likely that the water stays in it gaseous form throughout the race. I could be mistaken here, but the operating window of the slick tyres is somewhere between 90-110degC, enough to keep the water in its gaseous form throughout the race.\n> \n> It would be the most effective during the phase change from a liquid to a gas. I\'m not sure how that would be possible in this instance, as it would be introduced as a vapour to start with. This process is known as evaporative cooling, and if I\'m not mistaken it is used in some countries as a type of air conditioning. When water turns from a liquid to a gas, it absorbs heat, which in turn creates a cooling effect.\n> \n> Once the race is done and the tyre is cooled down enough, the vapour will condensate. The question is whether the temperature is dropping fast enough for this process to occur before it is disassembled for inspection. Pirelli inspecting the tyre right after the race would make it even less likely that they would find evidence of water in the tyre. Pirelli do provide teams with cooling curves, so they more than I would know the rate at which the tyres cool. Also, I would imagine the amount of water that is introduced must be miniscule, however that doesn\'t discredit the potential effectiveness of it.\n> \n> It seems entirely possible, that this could be happening and unless Pirelli are the ones inflating the tyres (which would be incredibly inefficient since tyre pressure changes happen a lot throughout the weekend) it could possibly go unnoticed.\n> \n> Remember that tyres may only be inflated with air or nitrogen per the regulations. Filling it up with anything else is a clear and obvious breach of rules. As with the Red Bull bib trick, first you need to prove that they are doing it.\n> \n> Remember that tyre pressure can be adjusted under parc ferm√©.\n> \n> It is entirely possible that they are running a setup that allows the tyre to heat up rather quickly for qualifying, then introducing water vapour with a pressure change before the race, which would help with the cooling of the tyre throughout the race. A very, if not the most important performance factor of the current regulations. \n> \n> This is also a team that struggled with overheating tyres at the star to the season. It could be that this was introduced mid-season, which ultimately turned the car into a race winning potential every single race since.\n>\n> Please not my use of speculative language. I am not accusing anyone of cheating.\n\n(And again, I\'m just reposting this to Reddit so please don\'t argue with *me* about it or the wing, I\'m not him lol)', 'I mean it was a pretty wet race.', ""**Translation:**\n\nThe fight between McLaren and Red Bull has been getting tougher and tougher as the weeks have gone by, both sportingly and technically speaking. On track we are witnessing the important duels between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris, ranging from extreme or ferocious peaks, such as those seen in Mexico and Austin, to the domination of the Dutchman in Brazil. **However, an off-track fight has also begun a few weeks ago**, to the tune of technical requests to the Fia, with an important desire to put pressure on the adversary, in a certain sense even discrediting him, and to light the fire of this fight even more, which, at least for the Drivers' World Championship, could already be over in Las Vegas. The latest case concerns McLaren's use of Pirelli compounds, a suspicion fuelled and pushed by Red Bull but which has also found allies in other teams.\n\n# The water-in-the-tyres trick: just a few millilitres of water in the tyres is enough to lower tyre temperatures by up to 10¬∞C?\n\n[During the weekend of the Brazilian GP](https://formu1a.uno/it/guerra-red-bull-mclaren-sullutilizzo-delle-gomme-pirelli-spiega-il-trucco/) there was a rumour that McLaren used an **old trick to cool the tyres**. Something that Red Bull itself and other teams used years ago, but which was then banned by an ad hoc technical directive. In order to improve the thermal management of the tyres, **some teams have a strong suspicion that in Woking they put water** inside the tyre via the inflation valve. As Mario Isola explained during the Brazilian weekend, the desired effect would in fact be to lower the temperature of the tyre. According to what [*Formu1a.uno*](http://Formu1a.uno) has learned in the past few hours, **we are talking about millilitres**, and therefore very small quantities of water, considering that just one unit would bring about a decrease of a few degrees in the temperature at the heart of the tyre.\n\nBasically, the extra water, or rather the extra moisture, would have the purpose of going to cool the air trapped inside the rim which, with this generation of single-seaters, are closed on the outside by the wheel covers and there is no longer any design work to be done on the rims to aid cooling. What aroused suspicions at Red Bull about the possible revival of a trick from the past was the major leap forward made by Mclaren during the season (without having to make compromises between qualifying and the race), and not during the winter as at Ferrari, which according to the men from Milton Keynes cannot be explained solely by the updates brought to the track on the MCL38. **At Red Bull, they believe that several men who until recently worked for the Milton Keynes team have spoiled what was once a ‚Äòtrick‚Äô used by the Anglo-Austrian team.**[ Those same engineers who in Austin allowed Mclaren to generate a request for clarification from the Fia on the shock absorber adjustment system located in the t-tray, useful for modifying the RB20's ground clearance](https://formu1a.uno/it/guerra-tecnica-red-bull-mclaren-il-dispositivo-ce-ma-a-preoccupare-e-altro/).\n\n#"", 'If FIA has no proof, innocent till proven guilty?', 'McLaren have been too good when it comes to tire deg, not to say they are cheating but would love to know how', 'Theoretically they could have 4% moisture in the tyres and claim it‚Äôs ‚Äújust air‚Äù as those conditions exist naturally in parts of the world.

Up and down staircases, walking for kilometres along the circuits. Van Egmond has had surgery on both knees. He used to work for McLaren but has long since been employed by Red Bull, not having missed a race for twelve seasons. Until he got the bad news last winter: an eight centimetre tumour on his left kidney. Surgery followed, but the bad news kept on coming. The cancer had spread. Immunotherapy and heavy prednisone medications followed. Despite that, Van Egmond travelled to Brazil on Wednesday to show his face in the paddock and, for just a little bit, get back to his work for Red Bull.\n\n**Emotional**  \n‚ÄúIt might sound soft, but on the way to Schiphol \\[airport\\] I got pretty emotional.

Financial, but on a different level too. ‚ÄúDuring the summer break, I got sent a shirt with autographs from everyone on the race team. And at Zandvoort I quickly visited and got surprised with a watch by Max. It feels like I have two families, at home and here.

And then he continues, in a serious manner: ‚ÄúI will not be declared clean \\[from the cancer\\]. There are three options: it could become worse, stay stable, or turn out a little bit better. If this goes well, I hope to attend roughly eight races next year. But I have to be honest with myself and see this weekend as a trial run. Maybe I‚Äôll fail miserably.

Frederic Vasseur does not budge from his position: ""We don\'t look at the standings. Honestly, I don\'t even know what the points gap is. We have to keep our approach of looking at it race by race, without doing calculations . ""\n\n\n\nVasseur: ‚ÄúMade a mistake with Charles‚Äô pit stop. These are difficult weekends even for those who are at the pitwall‚Äù\n\n\nAfter Qatar, Interlagos was the track where Ferrari expected to have the most problems against McLaren, and so it was. The Prancing Horse men did not hit the right window for the SF-24 both in the dry and especially in the wet, where Frederic Vasseur spoke several times of a difficulty in managing the tyre pressures , which then penalised the drivers a lot, both in Qualifying and in the race. ‚ÄúThese weekends are difficult to manage both on the track, for the drivers, and from the pit wall. It is a matter of making choices that then anticipate the conditions that you will find in Qualifying and the race. It was a difficult Sunday, but all in all not dramatic for us ,‚Äù declared the Ferrari Team Principal. A lot happened during the race, between changes in conditions, rain showers and yellow flags (and one red) and this also caused strong variations in performance: ‚ÄúWe were 6-7 tenths slower than Norris at the beginning of the stint, but then we were quicker at the end‚Äù .\n\n\nThe accident and subsequent departure from the pitlane by Carlos Sainz left Ferrari with only one car in the top of the standings, in a situation that was not easy to manage. In particular, Charles Leclerc paid for a pit stop that, in hindsight, turned out to be too hasty. ‚ÄúIt\'s easy to talk about it afterwards. It would certainly have been right to stay out waiting for the red flag, but if you crash in the meantime, you still become the stupid one,‚Äù said the French manager. After the race, Charles Leclerc immediately took some responsibility for the non-ideal car setup, but Vasseur intervened, also talking about the strategy adopted on the Monegasque : ‚Äú He is not responsible for the setup . He is always the first to take the blame, but that is not the case here. For the pit stop, we underestimated the threat of Bearman and Hamilton , who overtook us, because we lost precious tenths when exiting the pitlane which is very slippery . But this aspect would not have changed our race much . ‚Äù\n\n\nVasseur: ‚ÄúFerrari will come back strong in Las Vegas and we will have to take advantage of the opportunity‚Äù\n\n\nThe wet weekend certainly affected the performance of the SF-24, which has never managed to be as competitive as Red Bull and McLaren (or even Alpine), even though it finished ahead of Norris and Piastri, but it is impossible to know how it would have gone on dry surfaces. ‚ÄúI think we would have been closer, but it is difficult to say, there are so many variables such as setup and tyre management. We would still be talking about differences of 1-2 tenths,‚Äù said the Team Principal of the Prancing Horse. It is time to turn the page and wait for Las Vegas, the next GP on the calendar, which will open another, the last, hat-trick, after a 2-week break in which the teams will work and prepare for the end of the season as best as possible, even if, as Vasseru says, ‚ÄúWe are already focused on next year\'s project. New parts? Yes, spare parts after this weekend ,‚Äù he said, letting out a laugh.\n\n\nExpectations for the American GP are important, especially since the SF-24 is in good form, excels in slow corners and has improved efficiency with the latest developments. ‚ÄúLast year we were very strong and I expect we can do well again this year.‚Äù In Maranello they were aware that Interlagos would put them in greater difficulty against McLaren and all in all they managed to minimize the damage over the weekend. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to lose as few points as possible, I want to fight to get more. Las Vegas will be a place where we will have to try to make a splash ourselves,‚Äù said Vasseur in the post-race. In all this, a lively Carlos Sainz is also expected to return, after his victory in Mexico and a weekend to forget in Brazil, with accidents in qualifying and the race. ‚Äú There is time to do a complete reset now. Last year he had that accident in FP1 in Vegas and I was worried about how he could face the weekend and instead he went very well, so I am not worried about Carlos, he will come back strong! ‚Äù.', ""We all expect McLaren to dominate Qatar because of the highspeed nature of the track and we've all been assuming that Ferrari will do well in Vegas because of their performance this year in Monza (won by strategy but they had great pace), Baku, and COTA."", ""Yeah, the wet race helped Ferrari in a way - not pace wise since they were nowhere in the wet either, but with upsetting McLaren's momentum. McLaren were clearly the fastest car in the dry and probably would've finished 1-2 had the race been dry, essentially sealing the constructors.\n\nInstead, all McLaren have got from Interlagos is a minimal gain to Ferrari.\n\nIf Ferrari can take another win at Vegas, then it's all to play for in the WCC. Especially with McLaren's tendency to bottle and choke this year."", 'I\'m really appreciative of Leclerc\'s performance in Brazil, as it\'s the only reason Ferrari are still in the WCC. A double DNF would have been disastrous and not out of the question; Leclerc sounded really stressed at the end of the race, talking about how difficult the car was to drive. Vasseur said point black ""we chose the completely wrong setup because we expected different weather conditions.""\n\nSainz has been so inconsistent since the summer break. Either one of the absolute best drivers on the grid that weekend, or nowhere. Track trying to kill him aside, he was great at Vegas last year and I think the WCC is still on if him and Leclerc can string together a series of respectable performances and get at least one win. Qatar is not an option for that, so they need to focus on how they can make themselves competitive in Vegas and AD.', 'Ferrari lost 7 points this weekend to McLaren when expecting Ferrari to be much weaker than to McLaren is not too bad.

The team is failing too and i would say even more than the drivers: the pitstops aren\\`t ever lower than 3 seconds, the strategy is shit (why they changed COL tyres twice in four laps to put the same inter tyre when the driver requesed over and over again the wets??!), the Singapur updates didn\\`t improve the car a lot (and one can say that they downgraded it), the qualys strategies have non sense (many times both drivers only do one flying lap when they have time for two), and the drivers aren\\`t feeling confortable (Albon has to switch to COL\\`S COTA setup, and COL is having problems with the setups since Mexico).', ""[Here's](https://www.williamsf1.com/posts/84903beb-f165-4c1a-8a63-c1206ed1d076/watch-james-honest-sao-paulo-assessment) the video version of Vowles comments on the weekend.

It‚Äôs the hope that kills you as well. Albon was so quick in qualy until that moment, he made me dream. I think this says a lot about Alex, a very quick driver sometimes but so crash prone.', 'It really was disaster for them.\n\nSo much damage from both drivers.\n\nEven before they were leading destructor championship but they basically double the cost this weekend.\n\nPretty much guaranteed they will be 9th in WCC.\nNo way they gain nearly 30 points and no way Sauber catches them', 'I think what makes this worse is there are only ever 2 maybe 3 points positions up for grabs most weekends, as the top 4 are so far ahead. it would take a miracle for Williams to beat VCARB at this point. but the saving graces are Alpine is still a boat, AMR is unpredictable, Sauber is Sauber, Liam gets his elbows out and is aggressive (fantastically mind you) and risks crashes, Haas would be their real challenge. \n\nI want Williams to succeed as they with Alpine are my local teams.', ""Yeah it's a shame, but one also has to wonder just how much Williams themselves as a team had a play in this. \n\nBoth Albon and Colapinto binned it quite hard. Colapinto's race crash was extremely depressing end to the weekend. \n\nBut one has to wonder, again: has the car and setup Williams provided perhaps made a car that can very easily or abrubtly go south?\n\nIf we look at Strolls warmup incident, i think it's reasonable to believe there was a problem with the setup. If we look at how the Mercedes also had quite some issues and drivers have mentioned how it can suddenly 'go', suggests that cars can be suddenly over the edge.\n\nAnd the pace of Williams at Brazil was quite good, perhaps they simply went too far and had to back off a bit instead of go over the edge. \n\nAlpine clearly did everything right, and nobody is going to tell me that car belongs there at all. If we see how Mclaren had many offs too, this suggests they perhaps were pushing their boundaries too, when Alpine was perhaps just not pushing their boundaries for the sake of longevity and as such, benefit. \n\nGiven that Albon had a massively great qualification potential until the crash - and quite franly, Franco was getting well up to speed to, it might just have been Williams instead of Alpine on the podium.\n\nThat's one painful lesson, but perhaps because of the pain, a lesson that motivates them to actually learn from it."", 'Albon never should have gone out again']",3628,338,0.99,3628,15601,15601,10,0,0.0,10

While I undertand Max' career isn't over or 'complete' yet, who do you think has the bigger legacy? Who of these two is the greater driver, and will go down in history a such? And why?

Statiscally, Max has more wins than Seb, whereas Seb has more poles than Max. Max holds a lot of the 'youngest' records, but Vettel stil holds the youngest WDC record. Both hold a decent amount of other records as well or at least are close (Max' ten win streak vs Seb's nine win streak) etc. Both have had iconic drives, wins against the odds and utter domination.

I just want to clear up a apparent misunderstanding of how the red flag actually benefited Verstappen in today's win. 

It all starts in lap 27 when Hulkenberg got stuck somewhere on turn 1, after the rain got increasingly more intense. Norris already asked a few times to be pit, since the intermediates from the start are getting more worn for most of the grid, which means less grip and a harder time for all of them to keep the car on track. 

# Lap 28/29 

Both of the leaders dive into the pit to try and get a cheap pit stop under the VSC conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/itpieu32bryd1.png?width=2472&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0a709e49f502ae77a817621aa7253fc60bc945

Gap back to Verstappen is about 19 seconds under the VSC conditions. Gap in racing conditions before the VSC was called was about 13 seconds. As seen in the photo, the VSC was ending when both of them came into the pit. 

# Lap 30 

Both of them have pitted, but notably they have both pitted on new intermediates instead of wet weather tires. The gap is now 13 seconds in favor of Verstappen. During all of this the rain intensity is at the peak of the race, and the conditions would call for wet tires, as shown by Tsunoda. He was about 17 seconds back from the lead pair at the point of pitting. He did however pit himself and at lap 30 he was already only 7 seconds back.

About 10 seconds after the above screenshot a safety car is called, since the conditions are about to be undrivable. Tsunoda in a timespan of about 10 seconds made up 4 whole seconds on his wet tires.

# Lap 32 

After a few laps behind the safety car, Colapinto find the wall and the Red Flag is called. The order under the red flag does not change.

# So how did the red flag benefit Verstappen? 

(This is the opinionated part, so please discuss if you think different) 

  
The real benefit of the red flag to Verstappen and a lot of the grid behind is obviously the free pit stop. However, the positions from Norris and Russell are arguably already won when they decided to pit under the VSC for new intermediate tires. 

If the red flag, or safety car had not been called they would have lost time to anyone that pitted for wet tires. Its in my opinion very likely that they would have had to pit again under the conditions we have seen, and with the wet tire runners so much faster. 

If there was only the safety car called, Verstappen would be in front of them anyway. In this case I think a few different things could have happened depending on the rain intensity. Whats most likely is that Verstappen would have tried to stay out as long as possible on his old intermediates, unsure if they can make the whole race, but it would have been interesting to see, especially since it would have taken a long time to clear enough standing water for a rolling restart, so I think the remaining laps under speed would have been about \~30 laps, but probably less, since it was raining a lot. 

In any case, I think the red flag was not the deciding factor for Verstappen today, but Red Bulls and Verstappens choice to stay out and not switch tires. 

Norris and Russell got new intermediates, so that was a gamble from them on a safety car as well, since there was no way to drive on anything other than wets at that point, and they would be dropped behind Ocon, Gasly and Verstappen. Really unsure what that strategy call was. 

Love to hear corrections and your input, good night to everyone going to sleep! 

","[""Switching to Wet is useless most of the time, if we're under Wet conditions it means a red flag is coming, we don't see wet tyres racing anymore.

The conditions alone almost called for it.

Of course, they want to get as many points as possible but at the moment, they should focus on out-scoring Verstappen. So I don\'t understand, why they even considered pitting Norris before Verstappen. The VSC is the ""weakest"" advantage they could get (Safety Car is better and red flag obviously even more). And in these conditions, even losing this advantage would have been better than getting into a position where Verstappen has a potentially better option of going into the pits later on in the race.']",126,57,0.78,126,500,500,2,0,0.0,2

There seems to be multiple people and sources saying there was ""long time"" between crash and Verstappen dropping out of top 10. Rewatched to confirm.

Biggest loser here was Bottas who was robbed since Albon and Lawson got their times done (Albon when time left 1:09, Lawson when time left 1:03).

Tldr: no, there was less than 1 second for stewards to react for red flag which is basically impossible. Red Bulls dropped because they left themself last.

1gig99z,The State of F1's Safety Car Interventions,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gig99z/the_state_of_f1s_safety_car_interventions/,2024-11-03, Statistics,"After the concerning delay in declaring a Virtual Safety Car during this weekend's sprint race, much has been said about F1's officiating attempting to rig the results of races to make better TV. This accusation is, after the end of the 2021 season, potentially justified. However, the discussion has been doing an incredible disservice to the fact that the past few seasons have been an ongoing showcase of a potentially dangerous slowness to deploy Safety Cars, Virtual Safety Cars, or red flags. To educate myself and (hopefully) the rest of the subreddit, I went back and reviewed very SC/VSC intervention so far this season and made note of how long it took the race director to make the decision and neutralize the race. 

  
TL;DR up front, because this is going to be long; the average time this season between an incident occurring and a VSC or SC being deployed is a whopping \*48 seconds.\* 

  
Quick methodology notes up front: I used the very helpful [list of safety car interventions this season](https://www.lightsoutblog.com/every-safety-car-f1-2024/) by Nick Haldenby at Lights Out Blog, and went back to each race with the F1TV feed, the live timing, and a stopwatch. For cars that stopped alongside or on the track, I started the clock at the point when the car stopped moving (assuming that they wouldn't want to intervene in a race if a driver can quickly get moving again). Twice this season we've had VSC's deployed due to debris on the track, at Miami and Austria -- I've chosen not to include these as they would skew the average time calculation. So, here's the list:

  
Saudi Arabia, Lap 6: Stroll into the barriers, 50 seconds

Australia, lap 17: Hamilton stops on track, 20 seconds (from the moment of stoppage -- he did spend a long time trying to limp the car back)

Australia, lap 58: Russell into the barriers, 12 seconds

Japan, lap 1: Albon and Ricciardo collide, 23 seconds (race red-flagged)

China, lap 22: Bottas stops in the runoff, 1 minute 37 seconds (this was the incident reposted today of him exiting his car while standing at the end of the braking zone, under only yellow flags)

China, lap 27: Tsunoda and Magnussen collide, 15 seconds

Miami (sprint), lap 1: Norris and Stroll collide, 58 seconds

Miami, lap 29: Sargeant and Magnussen collide, 24 seconds

Monaco, lap 2: Perez/Hulk/Magnussen collide, 39 seconds (race red-flagged -- had to open Perez' onboard for this to even figure out when the crash occurred)

Canada, lap 25: Sargeant into the barriers, 40 seconds

Canada, lap 54: Sainz and Albon collide, 27 seconds

Azerbaijan, lap 50: Perez and Sainz collide, 1 minute 35 seconds

Austin, lap 2: Hamilton into the gravel, 53 seconds

Mexico, lap 1: Tsunoda into the barrier, 41 seconds

Brazil (sprint), lap 22: Hulkenberg stops on track, 2 minutes 2 seconds

  
The fastest reaction was a mere 12 seconds in Australia, while the longest came yesterday at 2 minutes and 2 seconds. However, that does still leave our average time at 48 seconds for this season. I did not take notes on every incident's on-track battles, but did notice that they didn't seem to favor one team consistently throughout the season. Without inside information that I doubt we'll ever see, it's impossible to know whether the delays are coming from a communications issue, a lack of confidence, or a desire to leave it as late as possible so the racing can continue (a la the old ""Racing back to the caution"" rule that NASCAR rightly did away with in the 2000's). Regardless, this is very clearly an ongoing issue, going back years, Taking longer than 60 seconds to make the decision for intervention should be a rare occasion, and yet we've had 3 such incidents this season.

  
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do the same analysis for the 2023 season yet, but I would like to. Without a convenient pre-made list of SC and VSC interventions, it's a bit more work, but if people would like me to I'll happily keep working on it (I might do anyway, just for my own curiosity). 

  
In parting, this specifically came out of my frustration at seeing people saying things like, ""any other race and they'd have sent the VSC out right away,"" when I clearly remembered this being a pattern of behavior from the officials. It's good to be aware of the potential for issues like that, but in situations like this where driver safety is being potentially placed at risk, it detracts \*HEAVILY\* from a very real, very concerning pattern. ","['Quality post and effort OP. This also reminds me of how long race control took before deploying a safety car back at Baku 2021 for either Stroll or Verstappen‚Äôs retirement when their tires randomly blew up. I remember after the race it was found that multiple drivers ignored the double waved yellows in that section by going significantly faster, yet in the end no one got a penalty for it. This has consistently been an issue like you said.\n\nEdit: [This article goes into further detail about how long it took for the Safety Car to be deployed for their crashes, and mentions how Masi wasn‚Äôt satisfied with how some drivers failed to slow sufficiently for double waved yellows](https://www.racefans.net/2021/06/09/eight-safety-questions-raised-by-azerbaijan-grand-prix-crashes-and-f1s-reaction/)', 'I saw that hulkenberg was moving (in neutral presumably) after the start of the double yellows. \n\nWhen did he stop moving? Was it a huge gap between him stopping completely and him getting out of the car?', ""I'm a marshall at Monza and I will try to explain why there's usually a long delay from the incident to the actual decision\n\nFirst of all a marshall has to report the incident to the race director to asses the conditions of the track and the driver, it's not so easy to do from the camera feed but a marshall that is right there at like 10m or less can easily evaluate the situation better.\n\nThen the circuit race director has to translate what is being said (because for us we communicate in Italian but the FIA race director understands English) and the FIA race director has to make a decision\n\nKeep in mind that usually as long as the car it's still limping around and the driver is not out they won't ever give out a VSC or a SC because it's always better to just wave a double yellow and let the driver bring the car to safety\n\nIn cases like Australia I highly doubt that there was even some sort of communication between the track marshall and the race director, they gave the VSC too quickly so I suppose the fia race director decided without hearing the marshalls (and rightfully so, I'm not blaming the decision it was the right thing to do)\n\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of communication between the track marshalls and the race director then again between the two of them. Then the decision is given out which in turn takes another few seconds\n\nIt's never as easy as on TV you might think it is, and also trust me a race director does not want to use a SC or a VSC (while on the FCY they are more favorable because it's a lot better)\n\n\nAlso it's worth noting that if an accident happens like at turn 1 but all the cars are already past that point they will tend to wait for the sc/vsc, because marshalls might be able to remove the car in like 20/30 seconds without having the need to deploy a safety measure. In case the sc/vsc is deployed they will let them race up until almost the end of the lap so they get a bit more action before having the race neutralized"", 'The worst thing is if I‚Äôm remembering correctly even there fastest of 12 seconds was to slow considering the scenario, Russel was upside down in a high speed section with debris up in the air blocking vision of Russel, so within that 12 seconds  a car almost drove directly into the underfloor of russels car, a red flag should of immediately been thrown out in this situation, it‚Äôs just not good enough and unfortunately seems like it is going to take another fatal accident before they tighten up these calls.', 'Agree this is a quality post! What I don‚Äôt get is why the VSC cannot be deployed right away, even for just a few seconds, when something is clearly happening at the track. Almost as a swift replacement for double-waved yellows in most situation. Then full SC can be deployed within 30-60 seconds if deemed crucial. That was the whole point of introducing the VSC: not to have all the issues and instances OP rightfully brought up!', ""I watch a lot of feeder series as well, and the thing I note in both places is that sometimes flags or safety cars or other things aren't called until they imminently need to be called for safety. What I mean is that if the accident happens at turn one, and in two seconds all the cars are past turn one before anything could possibly be called... well, the cars won't be back around to turn one for more than a minute, sometimes much more depending on the track. So, often I think officials let it go for a bit so that we can get some more active racing while they aren't actually near a hazard. In several feeder series, they are much more likely than F1 to not call a safety car of any kind if some yellows or double yellows around one area are sufficient, and then they are active racing around the rest of the lap."", 'Do you also know the average time without the 2 minutes and 2 seconds from yesterday? I would expect that the average would be way down then and even shows more what of an outlier yesterday was.', 'Just a note - WEC/GT3 series (SRO based) have a mandated decision time of 45 seconds to call a VSC/SC or leave it under local yellows.', ""You have to consider, that safety car deployment will take longer / is delayed on purpose, if all cars are are close to each other with no back trackers and the fiele has already patheted the yellow sector.\n\nFor example first lap accidents or accidents after safety car restarts.\n\nThere is no risk in waiting to deploy the SC until sector 3, if the crash happens in sector 1 and that's what is done every time.\n\nFor red flag incidents it is different and they tend to call it faster to avoid a mess regarding restarting positions and to allow cars to cool down before returning to box.""]",363,103,0.94,363,878,878,-5,0,0.0,-5

But I feel like, wouldn't they have done so if it was possible by now? I think it comes down to spray. By the time the conditions are wet enough that the intermediate doesn't work anymore, there is too much spray for the drivers to see. That's why the FIA have done some experimenting with wheel covers today reduce spray enough for the drivers to see, because until that problem is solved, it's kind of a moot point. Thoughts? 

Edit: to be clear, it's not like I think this is some new revelation.

Drivers want a tire that is in between intermediates and full wets.', ""This gen in general is unable to race in really harsh conditions. The ground effect is the main reason. it creates awful amounts of spray by sucking up water and chucking it out behind it. Remember. Those cars can suck up heavy manhole covers with ease. Then on top of that they run incredibly low which can cause the entire floor plank to aquaplan at high speeds. Both of these factors would make the wildest rain tyre useless. The current rain tyre probably is fine enough for displacing a shit ton of rain. 80 litres per second I think. Which is a crazy amount. Drivers really hate it because they offer so much less grip (duh) than the inters. So even if Pirelly would come up with a magic tyre that offers awesome grip, life and water displacement, You'd still have cars floating up and a fuckton of spray. Which both mean that there is absolutely no shot of them racing in harsher conditions.\n\nEdit: simply raising the car would cause them to have even less grip due to absolutely castrating your main downforce source. The floor."", ""The spray and conditions being two much for the cars when the wets are needed is one thing, but the fact of the matter is that they are incredibly slow. Even in utterly horrendous conditions like the middle of the race yesterday, russel and lando were switching onto new inters because the wets are just not good. Their useable window right now is not when they are faster than the inters, it's when the inters may as well be slicks. Which as you mention, is a tiny window.\n\nPirelli themselves know this, they've done and are doing tests with Ferrari to improve this. Overheating seems the primary problem in regards with them being so bad, and its definetly fixable. Michelin and Bridgestone's extreme wets back in their day were way more comparable in speed next to the inters."", ""This much has been obvious for decades.\n\nThere is no revelation in what you have put, wet tyres need to move water, the only place to move water to is up, this makes spray.\n\nI don't think you have really moved the conversation on any with this."", ""Wider tyres + ground effect = too much spray \n\nand the inters are near the limit for these cars, they eprhaos could make a 50-60 ltr tyre iso an 80 ltr, (inters are 35 if im not mistaken) but I doubt it'll be used much anyway. \n\nMaybe 26 when we get new regs and cars it'll be different again ü§∑"", 'What happened to [the super-intermediate tyres](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/FoqSgOQqwf) Pirelli suggested a year ago?', 'This is for the ""wet weather tyres are useless"" gang:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dfE3kvt.png', ""tire isn't the entire problem it's also the ride height.

1gi5jfq,"So, what's actually in the rules if there is no qualifying session?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gi5jfq/so_whats_actually_in_the_rules_if_there_is_no/,2024-11-02, Discussion,"We've all heard different things from different commentators, so I went and checked the text of the [Sporting Regulations for 2024](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_1_-_2023-09-26.pdf) and, surprisingly, I couldn't find anything that deals directly with a qualifying session being cancelled.

The closest thing I could find is the rule about drivers that are not classified at the end of a qualifying session (39.4.b):

>Drivers will be considered to be ‚Äúunclassified‚Äù in the following circumstances:

>i) If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race Director.

>ii) If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted

>iii) If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint shootout

Unless this is covered by some other rule that I didn't see (if so, apologies for wasting your time), if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:

>The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows:

>\- Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 **(or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)**

If I understand correctly, then it has to be Free Practice 1 classification order and the commentators that mentioned the possibility of Stewards using a different order are incorrect. I wonder if the rest of Rule 39.4.b is the cause of this misunderstanding:

>The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters such as:

>\- A suitable lap time being set in another practice session  
\- The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the Championship  
\- The gravity of the offence which caused the driver‚Äôs disqualification

which is about allowing drivers that did not classify at the end of the qualifying session to start the race and not about their position in the grid if allowed. Usually drivers are allowed to start the race unless there are serious driver / car performance or safety concerns.

Did I miss something?

Final note: the Rule on moving the qualifying session is quite straightforward, basically the Race Director and Stewards can do whatever they want (inside FIA rules) based on Rule 15.3.a:

>The clerk of the course shall work in permanent consultation with the Race Director. The Race Director shall have overriding authority in the following matters and the clerk of the course may give orders in respect of them only with his express agreement:

>a) The control of free practice, qualifying session, sprint shootout, sprint session and the race, adherence to the timetable and, if he deems it necessary, the making of any proposal to the stewards to modify the timetable in accordance with the Code or Sporting Regulations.","['Fuck knows', ""the truth is there is no precedent. race director will make the final call if the qualifying doesn't go through.\n\nalthough i personally feel if the weather is bad enough for there to be no qualifying whatsoever then it is really ambitious to hope for a race to happen as well."", ""Stewards discretion seems to be the most likely option but teams will protest for sure. It's going to be a hot mess.\n\nAlthough it probably won't matter looking at the forecast"", ""Time for Verstappen to pull a Hamilton '21\n\nWe're here for it"", ""Logical answer: sprint quali grid\n\nProbable answer: some FIA moment ruling that hasn't been thought of makes FP1 the race grid session."", ""You did not miss anything i think, there is no rule yet.\n\n>if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:\n\nThat is the question. If quali doesn't happen at all, does that mean that all 20 drivers failed to set a lap time during Q1 in the sense of this regulation? I don't think it has to be seen that way if Q1 never started and the stewards could use a different order.\n\nFor next year the rules in this situation would be WDC order."", '""If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1""\n\nThey didn\'t, the -did- set a time in SQ1.
