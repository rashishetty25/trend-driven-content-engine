In GTD Pro, the class where GT3 road based cars are piloted by top rated professional Platinum and Gold drivers, we see 15 entries (cars) featuring 9 different road based chassis from nine different familiar manufacturers - sure to be an exciting and competitive class.

Strategy plays a huge part in racing here - stay on the lead lap and in the lead group, and after a late race safety car with 2h-1h to go, it\'s anybodies guess as to who crosses the line first to win the Rolex.

Similar to how Suzuka 2011 is probably the better 'drive' than Canada 2011 for Button, even if it was less wild.\n\nI only started in 1999 so I didn't see them all. My friend has watched since 1990 and says Schumacher was never exactly as good as 1994/5/6/just about 7.\n\nIt's funny to me that Schumacher was always quite lowkey on his famous wins. Spain 1994 that he won stuck in gear: he said it took a couple of laps but it was a) the perfect gear to be stuck in and b) once he figured it out it was fine and c) it had amazing torque anyway. Like Ricciardo Monaco 2017/8/whenever he got stuck in gear: once you've figured it out, it's fine. \n\nSpain 1996, he just didn't know what other's problem was. I can't think of any *he* was emphatic about."", 'Who do you think had the second best car in 2013: Lotus, Ferrari or Mercedes?

1i829ds,Lawson reveals the one driver who 'deserves an F1 seat',https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i829ds/lawson_reveals_the_one_driver_who_deserves_an_f1/,2025-01-23, News,,"['TLDR: Drugovich', 'Thats old as hell news, Lawson gave that interview a couple days after being announced for the second RBR seat', ""Drugovich definitely deserves a seat, as does Pourchaire. Unfortunately just wrong place wrong time for both of these guys. Drugovich not being in an Academy when he won hurt him big time and Pourchaire was unlucky that he was in Sauber's Academy at a time they preferred cash.\n\nAlso hurt a bit by the 3rd year F2 champ moniker but honestly if you have guys like Lawson, Doohan and Bearman whose 2 years in F2 are comparable to Drugovich and Pourchaire, then it's tough to say they dont deserve the chance. But that's F1 for you, being good enough isn't always enough, there's always lots of other factors at play."", 'Oh, Was expecting him to say himself', 'Thanks for saving a click.', 'To be fair Pourchaire in his 3rd year was as old as Drugovich in his first, as Theo joined F2 when he was 17 with very little experience.\n\nAnd I mean Drugovich 2nd year was abysmal, outscored pretty soundly by his teammate Zhou and by rookie Pourchaire.\n\nSo I never understood all this hype around Drugovich other than Brazilians pushing for their driver to be in F1. Same as we are seeing with Colapinto.', ""I think what helps Drugovich is he completely dominated his 3rd year in a team thats normally not a front runner. His 2nd wasn't ideal but also it was Zhou's team through and through, I believe his dad pumped a lot of money into that team to get them focusing on Zhou's side of the garage. So it's hard to tell if he was getting the same treatment which can affect performance quite a bit.\n\nI agree that Pourchaire probably more deserving given his age but Felipe certainly proved he deserves it as well.""]",0,9,0.31,0,7,7,0,6,-0.13,0
