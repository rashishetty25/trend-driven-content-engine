Red Bull, however, was ready to bring Verstappen into F1 immediately after he joined Toro Rosso in 2015, and then transferred him to Red Bull at the start of 2016.\n\nWolff wasn't willing to risk Antonelli being poached by another team if he chose a veteran option like Sainz.\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", ""I doubt they'd whimsically ditch Antonelli.

_Toyota coming to F1 with Haas (HUGE improvement)   

_Audi & General Motors coming to F1 in 2026 but the management already changed in the Sauber team with the arrival of experimented Mattia Binotto
