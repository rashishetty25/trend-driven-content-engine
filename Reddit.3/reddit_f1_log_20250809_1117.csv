They usually get red flagged due to visibility and safety issues. But I remember/know them being much less frequent in previous eras. But how do they affect it ? 

I know that Pirelli tried and tested using tyre arches to reduces spray but I‚Äôve also read that they weren‚Äôt as successful as they want it to be and the main issue was the floor. But I don‚Äôt really know how that works since I‚Äôm not educated in technical areas. 

While I was looking for some answers I found out that the dirty air mechanic changed quite a bit (and also loopholes are exploited) and they‚Äôre the reason but there weren‚Äôt any explanations that I coul find. Can anyone explain it please 

  
TL,DR : I don‚Äòt know how ground effect floor effects wet racing and couldn‚Äôt find any explanation and I‚Äôm asking here for one 

  
Thanks ","['The main issue with wet racing is the spray that is generated. This is worse the further back you are - P1 only has the safety car‚Äôs spray coming up in front of them, P20 has the safety car and 19 other cars in front of them.\n\nThe ground effect works like an upside down airplane. The car is sucked down onto the floor which helps push the wheels into the ground and means it propels the car forwards more effectively and that steering is more effective. However, when it‚Äôs raining, the ground effect sucking the car onto the floor pushes more spray up from the floor in turn. So if we took a 2021 car and a 2025 car, and had them drive around a wet track, the 2025 car would generate more spray.\n\nIf the drivers can‚Äôt see, it‚Äôs not safe to race. Look at Hadjar on Antonelli in Silverstone, Hadjar couldn‚Äôt see Antonelli‚Äôs taillights through the spray until he was in the back of him.', 'Ground effect cars generate downforce by creating a low pressure region beneath the car. The basic idea works like this:\n\nAs the engine propels the car forward, air enters the area beneath the floor. This air is accelerated as it flows through the underside of the car. The acceleration is typically achieved by narrowing the space between the car and the ground. This is often done using Venturi tunnels, if you are interested in the specific shapes that help accelerate the flow.\n\nAs the air speeds up, its pressure drops. This follows directly from Bernoulli‚Äôs principle.\n\nWith lower pressure beneath the car and higher pressure above it, the car is effectively pushed downward. The air above forces the car toward the ground. This is what creates downforce. The car is quite literally pressed into the track by atmospheric pressure because of the lower pressure underneath.\n\nOnce the minimum pressure is reached under the car, the air must gradually return to atmospheric pressure. This process is called diffusion. Diffusion increases the pressure while slowing the air back down.\n\nFor ground effect to work effectively, large volumes of air need to be moved through the Venturi tunnels and then expanded in the diffuser. On a wet track, this means a lot of water on the surface gets sucked in, accelerated through the tunnels, and ultimately expelled out of the rear of the car.\n\nPrevious generations of cars relied more heavily on front and rear wings to generate downforce. As a result, they did not pick up as much water from the track surface ‚Äî only the spray from the tires. That still happens with current cars, but now the ground effect system adds significantly more spray from the underbody.', 'Also to note inters and wets have a larger diameter than slicks so that raises the cars ride height and decreases the DF generated by the floor.', 'More than anything to do with the aerodynamics, F1 became a lot more conservative about racing in the rain after Jules Bianchi died when they were literally racing in a typhoon.', 'Not really 100% related, but the ground effect cars have been pretty poor in the dry and wet. The floors are essentially vacuuming up water and spraying it out of the diffuser in the rear. \n\nMany things have masked how poor the 2022 regs have been. 2023 was a snooze fest, 2022 was only exciting because Ferrari pulled a 2017 and acted like they could actually win, 2024 was only exciting because Horny and Newey had a falling out and the car started getting slower, and 2025 has been a competition of who can do more laps on the medium in clean air.', 'To see the practical results, see the 1998 Belgian GP', 'In very short: older cars generated spray from the tyres. Ground effect cars generate spray from the whole floor.\n\n\nThere simply is much much more spray these days. Silver lining is that of it stopped raining, it only takes half dozen of laps to dry the track.', 'thanks']",95,26,0.87,95,199,199,3,0,0.0,3

1mllp0u,Fernando Alonso's 2025 season (luck corrected),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mllp0u/fernando_alonsos_2025_season_luck_corrected/,2025-08-09, Statistics,"Australia:  





Alonso showed good pace in Q1 but damaged his floor on 1st run in Q2 and qualified 12th, one place ahead of Stroll. During the wet race on lap 33 while running 14 seconds ahead of Stroll he crashed and retired from the race. Even though Alonso ran over the gravel that was put on the track by Gasly running a bit wide ahead its impossible to prove that crash wasn't on him. **Alonso 0-1 Stroll**





China:





For the sprint Alonso qualified one place behind Stroll but suffered unspecified issue during the sprint race and finished one place behind Stroll. For the main race Alonso once again qualified one place ahead of Stroll. Alonso made up one place at the start but on lap 4 he was forced to retire due to issue with the brakes. Because Alonso retired so early in the race its impossible to say who would have finished the race ahead therefore its undecided. **Alonso 0-1 Stroll**





Japan:





Alonso qualified 13th while Stroll was 20th. Not much happened during the race. Stroll remained last while Alonso made up 2 positions but finished 11th out of the points. **Alonso 1-1 Stroll**





Bahrain:





Alonso qualified 13th again while Stroll qualified 19th. During the race it looked like neither car was on course for points. Due to debris on track safety car came out on lap 32. At the time Alonso was running 14th while Stroll was 16th 9s behind but Alonso also had fresher tires at that point. Both drivers decided to pit during SC. Alonso finished the race 16th while Stroll was 18th. **Alonso 2-1 Stroll**





Jeddah:





Alonso qualified 13th once again while Stroll was 16th. During the race Stroll along with few more drivers tried staying out waiting for the safety car but it didnt happen. Alonso spent the race trying to fight RBs and he made up 2 places after Tsunoda and Gasly crashed on lap 1 but finished 11th once again. Stroll finished 16th. **Alonso 3-1 Stroll**





Miami:





Alonso qualified 10th for the sprint while Stroll was 16th. During the wet sprint both made up places, Alonso was running in 8th while Stroll was 11th.  However despite Alonso's request to pit his side of the garage didnt pit him but Stroll pitted at the right crossover point as the track was drying. The issue was they didn't pit Fernando even lap later but 2 laps later when it was too late. The consequence of that was Alonso came out in 8th but 13s behind Hamilton who he was fighting together with Albon before the round of pitstops. Both Hamilton and Stroll pitted 2 laps before Alonso. As Alonso came out of the pit he was immediately attacked by Lawson who was right behind him which ended in a crash for which Lawson was given penalty. For the main race Alonso qualified 17th while Stroll was 19th. During the start Alonso got unlucky as he had to avoid Doohan and Lawson crash which meant he stayed in 17th while Bearman and Stroll got ahead. During the 1st stint Alonso spun on his own. However in the following laps he caught up the group ahead again. Stroll pitted before as he started on mediums compared to Alonso on hard who then benefited when VSC was deployed however he still had to do a 30 lap old stint on medium to the end which wasn't optimal in Miami. Fernando got ahead ahead during VSC phase, was right ahead of Stroll and till the end of the race Alonso created a gap between him and Lance of 4s but both of them were 2 last cars still running on the track. Due to VSC it isn't clear how the race between Alonso and Stroll would turn out and how much life Alonso still had on his hard. In scenario without VSC Alonso would lose more time in the pitstop phase but would overall have better pace during the race as he wouldn't be forced to do most of the race on mediums instead of hard. **Alonso 3-1 Stroll** 





Imola:





Alonso qualified 5th while Stroll qualified 8th. During the race both pitted earlier than most but Alonso's brakes overheated which caused him to lose the place to Sainz. On lap 29 VSC came out which benefitted the drivers that didn't stop yet which meant that points finish for either driver was unlikely. During the later SC in the race both Alonso and Stroll changed tires and while Alonso was able to make some overtakes it was only enough for 11th once again. Stroll finished 15th. **Alonso 4-1 Stroll**





Monaco:





Alonso qualified 7th which would turn into 6th grid position after Hamilton's penalty. Stroll qualified 19th. During the race Alonso was in a fight with Hamilton and Hadjar for 6th place but his car developed engine problems which lost him a lot of pace and eventually lead to a retirement. Stroll finished the race in 15th. **Alonso 5-1 Stroll**





Spain:





Alonso qualified 10th while Stroll was 14th. Stroll withdrew from the race while Alonso scored first points of the season. As Stroll didn't compete there is no way to compare drivers and come to conclusion who would have finished ahead. **Alonso 5-1 Stroll**





Canada:





Alonso qualified 6th while Stroll was 18th. Stroll finished the race 17th after being awared a penalty for collision with Gasly. Alonso fought his way to 7th place. **Alonso 6-1 Stroll**





Austria:





Alonso qualified 11th while Stroll was 16th. After the 1st lap incident between Antonelli and Verstappen Alonso managed to get into Lawson's DRS where he stayed for the whole race. With 1 stop strategy he managed to finish 7th once again. Stroll didn't make as much progress during the race and finished 14th. **Alonso 7-1 Stroll**





Silverstone:





Alonso qualified 9th while Stroll was 18th. The start of the race was between dry and wet conditions. Some drivers decided to pit straight away which promoted Alonso to 6th position and Stroll to 11th. At the end of lap 6 AM decided to pit Lance for soft tires which was a great call as track dried up further. This moved allowed Stroll to progress to 8th position just behind Sainz and Alonso just in few laps as at the point dry tires were much faster than intermediate tires. Then the rain got heavy all of a sudden and Lance was first in the pits which again was a great call because drivers left out on worn out tires in heavy rain were multiple seconds slower on that 1 lap. AM brought Alonso in the pits 1 lap too late and that demoted him to 9th while that early call with Stroll promoted him to 5th. After SC and Verstappen spun out Stroll was in a fight for 3rd with Hulkeberg while Alonso was in 8th. Track was drying out slowly but at one point was clear that everyone was going to switch to dry tires. Alonso's side of the garage decided to be first and they called Alonso to pit. It turned out that once again they were wrong with Alonso. Couple of laps later dry tires started to become faster but Alonso already lost too much time at that point. Alonso with some overtakes managed to get to 9th while Stroll finished 7th after AM put him on softs which wore out too fast which costed Lance the position to Verstappen and Gasly on the last lap. Due to circumstances of the race and Stroll getting much better strategy than Alonso its impossible to fairly rate drivers during this GP. **Alonso 7-1 Stroll**





Spa:





For the sprint Alonso qualified 14th while Stroll was 15th. During the start Stroll got ahead of Alonso and it stayed that way till the end of the sprint. For the main race Alonso qualified 19th while Stroll was 20th but Alonso ended up starting from the pit. During the race Alonso overtook Stroll while the track was wet. Alonso was running in 13th while Stroll was 14th. Then Alonso's side of the garage decided to risk it and pit him again as there was no chance of scoring points from13th. 2nd stop turned out to be a wrong call as the tires didnt have much deg and Antonelli who was ahead of Alonso couldn't get past Ocon. Alonso was ahead of Stroll on same strategy until his unplanned 2nd stop once again its impossible to say which driver would have finished ahead. Its likely Alonso as he was ahead and on same pace but there was still 15 laps to go in the race and unlike Monaco which did count towards Alonso in Spa they were next to one another on track separated by 3 seconds so 1 mistake would be enough to bring Stroll into the fight which is why this race is left in undecided category. **Alonso 7-1 Stroll**

If he was the only driver at Aston Martin, we would have great difficulty in assessing how good the car actually was. but one of Stroll's biggest defenders is Fernando Alonso, and I don't think that's a coincidence. Stroll makes Alonso look good. Alonso is able to consistently outperform his team mate (at least on track position) and so looks like he's doing a decent job, but I seriously doubt that Alonso is the same driver he was 20 years ago. In short, Aston Martin have two seriously below par drivers. Could it be possible that the current AM car is much better than anyone has suspected?
