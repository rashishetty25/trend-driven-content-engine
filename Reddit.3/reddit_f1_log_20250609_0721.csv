""I even sent him an Instagram DM once. A very long one where I told him all about it. But I didn't get a reply.

So, I worked very closely with a psychologist, a sports psychologist. Almost my entire career, especially in my world champion year. Sometimes I sat with him for up to 2 hours every other day, going through everything that was possible. Visualizing, repeating, meditating, everything. If I were his psychologist, the first thing I would say is, of course, that's wonderful for us. Yes, he makes himself very approachable. He shows his feelings, his doubts. That's great, of course. But for him, I would recommend that he doesn't repeat it over and over again, because in the repetition, at some point you also reinforce it in yourself.""

Interviewer: The negative, right? 

""Yes, of course, the negative. If you say every day that I'm not good enough, at some point you'll believe it. That's why I would strongly recommend that he reduces that, not always the negative. Even when he's on pole, he talks about the one corner he messed up - and he's on pole. Just cheer about the brilliant performance, more positivity. And then of course he's just a bit of a sensitive person.

1l6nrfp,are the current gen cars all uniquely quirky?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l6nrfp/are_the_current_gen_cars_all_uniquely_quirky/,2025-06-08, Technical,"The second Red Bull seat along with with Hamilton's move to Ferrari get the most attention but it seems like in the current generation, any driver that moves to a new team does considerably poorer vs. their teammate, even if that teammate is a rookie. It almost seems like having no experience with the car ( and possibly not having to unlearn behaviors) is a larger benefit than experience. 

Do the current generation of cars have individual unique qualities that are more exemplified than in previous generations? 

I'm using Bearman/Ocon, Bortoleto/Hulkenburg, Sainz/Albon, Hamilton/Leclerc as examples. I also consider the Lawson/Hadjar Racing Bulls and Colapinto/Alpine in this bucket as well but there's not been as many races for them.","[""Apparently what confounds many drivers is that the current gen really don't react well to hustle.\n\nSo if you're not quick, your instinct is to give it a bit of stick, and they don't react well to that. \n\nAlonso was saying that often you can go slower when you push, quote unquote."", 'I wonder if it’s actually hard to assess drivers as well. Ricciardo at McLaren and Checo at Red Bull have shown that the quirks can be career killers. I see a guy like Bottas on the sidelines when he perhaps shouldn’t be. \n\nIt’s felt like in recent years that rookie drivers were a liability. Now it feels more like too much experience can be your downfall.', 'I think at the limit these cars have weird tendencies that most drivers have learned to drive around. Mostly to do with the fact that as they slow the cars, downforce doesnt bleed off linearly in a predictable manner. I think it was Ocon who put it best, there is one very specific way to drive these cars, not like previous generations where you would have 3 ways to get the maximum.\n\nNow every team handles the downforce issue a bit differently. Which is why Max can tame his car, while his teammates struggle, Leclerc and Sainz had moments where either did better when design philosophy went one way. Arguably a case can be made for Ham and Rusell. in 2023 when Ham got the car he wanted, he was p3 in the constructors, when (it can be argued) it was more towards Rusell, he struggled, Russel did beat him, but was only p6.\n\nBasically these gen cars are kinda shit, drivers dont like them, engineers dont like them either. Downforce calculations for that underfloor become far, far more complex at the limit, which is the cause for all the correlation issues you hear about.', 'I don\'t know how it is compared to previous regulations, but you sometimes forget that the cars aren\'t just made by different manufacturers, they\'re also completely unique, no part is the same between teams. (except for some fia supplied parts ofc) Teams come up with fundametally different ways to solve the same issues within the rules, which lead to these ""quirks"".\n\n(Two cars in the same team are obviously the same with the exception of differently scheduled upgrades, if I didn\'t make that clear)\n\nEdit again: I somehow totally forgot teams can buy suspension parts from each other, (as well as engine and transmission ofc)', ""It's definitely odd that experience seems almost bad for these current regulations.\n\nI've hated these regulations, it just feels like the entire point was to reduce dirty air, yet it's the biggest issue the drivers have.\n\nThe tyres have been a disaster, either they last the entire race or can't do two laps in quali, it's definitely been a frustrating set of regs.\n\nHopefully the new regs will get away from these issues, the tyres have been awful, it's why McLaren has been so amazing, they're the only team that's figured out some magic to resolve this issue, but whatever they've done seems impossible to replicate by the other teams, so props to them. \n\nBut car setups need to not be so restricted, the floors needing to be so low to the ground seem to lock everyone into specific types of setups and it seems like we don't have as many varied driving styles since pushing sometimes seems to make cars actually go slower.\n\nWe'll see what happens next season, it's great that the McLaren boys have a battle this season, but it mostly feels like whoever qualifies first wins, so I'd like to see the sport get away from that again."", ""The real reason is the cars are all extremely close. You can see the talk on the Williams channel with Sainz, Albon, and Coulthard, where Sainz says he looked like a fool getting knocked out in Japan while Albon was a legend going to Q3, but in the data the gap was 0.05 seconds.   \n\nJust a few years ago, cars had much more gaps to other teams. Even when performances swung, they would go from one big gap to another big gap - especially at the front. There have been races where Red Bull, Ferrari, and Mercedes would lap the rest of the field upto P7, and P7 would have a super lonely race with nobody within 10-15 seconds. For example, in the 2019 Australian GP, the gap in Q1 between first and getting knocked out was ~0.62 seconds. That gap in 2017 would've probably put you firmly in 5th."", 'Ground effect cars seem to punish those who brake late. So slow in fast out is preferred.', ""This has always been the case, it's just more obvious when the margins are as fine as they are."", ""i think Magnussen spoke about this in an interview, basically the current f1 cars has quite a unique way in driving them, you can't really be agressive with it, one example is Lewis, he has been a late braker most of his career, and because the current car relies so much on floor downforce late braking would distrupt the airflow underneath and cause the car to become unstable\n\nhttps://www.planetf1.com/news/kevin-magnussen-lewis-hamilton-daniel-ricciardo-ground-effect-f1-car-struggles""]",282,48,0.93,282,44,44,31,5,-0.009999999999999898,31

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

In MotoGP, when they refer to a rider’s world championships, they seemed to count *all* of their world championships— even the ones from other classes like Moto2 or Moto3. By contrast, in F1, very little weight seems to be given to whether a driver was a previous F2 or F3 champ.  \n  \nIs this purely a cultural difference or is the gap between F1/F2/F3 somehow more substantial than between different classes of motorcycle racing? Like, is there a practical reason why F2/F3 are less prestigious than Moto2/Moto3?']",1,1,0.67,1,1,1,-1,1,-0.32999999999999996,-1

Firstly, since 2021 he has never had a car even capable of competing for a championship, and very rarely even for wins. Secondly, this generation of cars doesn\'t seem to suit his style and he has said that publicly. And thirdly, the Ferrari transition hasn\'t been seamless.\n\nLewis has always been a confidence driver; even in some of his championship winning seasons he took time to get in the zone and be confident in himself and the car. I don\'t think he\'s been fully confident in both since 2021, so I still think there\'s some performance he could unlock there, but whether he will is another question.\n\n""Free fall"" is ridiculous though.', 'Johnny Herbert + off weekend = unfounded sensational headlines.', ""Lewis is 40 so he's obviously not what he used to be.
