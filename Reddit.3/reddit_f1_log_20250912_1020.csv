1ne57q8,What Undercuts and Overcuts Are,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ne57q8/what_undercuts_and_overcuts_are/,2025-09-11, Discussion,"It's become apparent in recent discourse that people use the terms Undercut and Overcut to mean any change in position which happens around a pitstop phase.

This isn't really what these terms mean when discussed in terms of ""Driver X was given an undercut by the team"". etc.

Undercut or Overcut is all about changes in position happening around pitstops precisely because of the timing of the stop giving you a pace advantage on track.

# Undercut -

The Undercut is the idea that pitting earlier gives you the opportunity to gain time on the driver you are battling by being able to exploit fresh tyres. This increased pace over the car out on track on worn tyres might allow you to gain multiple seconds per lap.

**Risks of Undercut  -** The Undercut only works if you can get upto speed quickly and exploit the pace of the fresh tyres. Traffic is usually a big risk for an Undercut strategy as if you have to pass cars you can't exploit the pace of your fresh tyres. The other potential issue is tyre warm up which in F1 usually isn't much of an issue due to tyre warmers, but with hard tyres on cool tracks it can still be a significant issue. Also pitting first means you will have to go longer on your tyres, potentially leaving you vulnerable later in the race.

Safety cars are a huge risk for a driver attempting an Undercut, if you pit first under green flag conditions and then a safety car or VSC comes out your advantage is demolished.

**How to Negate an Undercut -** Having a big enough lead over the car behind can protect you from an undercut, or having the pace to match (or nearly match) the driver on fresh tyres. Otherwise the strategy to defend from an UnderCut is to pit as soon after your rival as you can to negate their advantage. Then the ultimate way to defend from an Undercut is to pit first!

Or, you run much much longer and allow them to undercut you with the intention of passing them later on much fresher tyres.

# Overcut -

The Overcut is the idea of staying out longer than your rival and using the pace of your car and tyres to gain time on them on their outlaps. This also defends from potential safety cars benefitting your opponent over yourself.

**Risks of Overcut -** This only really works if either you have an inherently faster car, tyre wear is next to non-existent or the tyres cars are pitting onto have a signficant warm up phase or are just inherently slower. In F1 it is fairly rare where the Overcut is the preferred strategy as tyres come out the blankets nearly ready to race, but traffic can make the overcut viable. This is something you see more in series without tyre warmers such as indycar.

**How to Negate an Overcut -** Negating an OverCut is all about not pitting too early and ensuring you have good pace on your fresh tyres. If you have a quicker car behind you and fresh tyres are gonna take a while to be upto speed then pitting first is very dangerous and you are going to want to try and outlast your opponent. In these situations sometimes you get a game of ""pit stop chicken"" where they try to goad each other into pitting first.

# Exceptions -

If a driver suffers a slow pit stop for whatever reason and gets passed either by a car pitting earlier or later, that isn't an Under or Over cut. The timing of the cars pitting is not the reason that the positions changed, it was the issues in the pitlane.

Saying a car Overcut or Undercut in such situations is missing the reason for the overtake happening which is entirely the time spent on pitlane, not the timing of the stop.

What exactly does he mean by this? In an ideal universe he, Will Joseph (and the rest of the McLaren pitwall), and us are all using the exact same definition of under/overcut (and I think the OP provides a very clear one here), but it seems to get a little murky in what Lando means by this request. How could Lando request this and/or his engineer promise it without implying (whether intentional or not) that they would/could ask Oscar to drive more slowly in case the fresh tyres really did have a huge pace advantage? I\'m not sure what I\'m missing here.', 'Have we even had an overcut between roughly equal cars since refuelling was banned?

1ne4yhl,"Are there really almost no hype for this season‚Äôs title battle or my algorithm tricks me into believing that, what are your opinions ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ne4yhl/are_there_really_almost_no_hype_for_this_seasons/,2025-09-11, Discussion,"As title says what do you think ? I‚Äôm believing that this championship battle has almost no hype. McLaren is obviously a rocket ship no one can deny that. After 16 races both McLaren drivers individually have more points than any other constructors. Lando is currently 13 points ahead of Ferrari and Piastri is 44 points ahead of them. And they both have same car so they‚Äôre equal on that.
In terms of skill etc. I‚Äôm believing that Oscar is slightly more talented than Lando but Lando‚Äôs experience balances it, so they‚Äôre almost equal on that too.
Basically there‚Äôs no significant difference for me that effects the battle significantly.

Situation looks like it‚Äôs screaming 2016 all over again but nobody is hyped about it. In summer break the gap was 8 points if I remember correctly, it‚Äôs basically nothing but why nobody is excited about it ?

For me a big factor is this 

-McLaren intervenes their battle quite a lot than it should be which kills the excitement quite a lot for me. They‚Äôre acting like a parent whose twins are competing over something (let‚Äôs say exam scores) , they create some boundaries etc. If the situation is indeed like twins competing over exam scores I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre good parents. Since they don‚Äôt let the tension rise etc. but the situation isn‚Äôt like that at all. 
In title battles I‚Äôve watched and heard things weren‚Äôt that calm, they‚Äôd go all out do whatever they can to win which creates a big excitement.

Another thing is we don‚Äôt see on track battles between McLaren drivers. Usually for me on track battles creates a lot of excitement they lack that too. Do they ever really had an on track battle for a win this season ? I‚Äôd say no they were usually close but not a significant battle they kinda accept their position and move on. It feels like there‚Äôs some sort of de facto Multi-21 team order.

Finally I think they lack aggressiveness. If you followed interviews etc. they aren‚Äôt aggressive their statements doesn‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre fighting for championship instead it feels like they‚Äôre in an upper-midfield team that fight for podiums. And you can see that lack of aggressiveness in team radios too. In Monza Lando had a bad pit stop and got undercutted by Oscar because of this, McLaren intervened asked Oscar to return position and Oscar just accepted it. He didn‚Äôt resist at all. I get it in radio they said to him it‚Äôs payback for Hungary last year but still I don‚Äôt get it at all. 

Oscar and Lando are fighting for title this year, situation is completely different than 2024. It‚Äôs just so stupid.

Anyways that‚Äôs what I think about that.
Do you think that this title race is boring if so why ? 


It‚Äôd be nice to read some opinions beside the ones that my algorithm shows me.

Thanks.


","['I think this is one of those seasons where the WDC fight is *interesting* rather than *exciting*.

What we\'re seeing is an inverse of the driver-team relationship someone like that usually provokes; the team are the ones pulling rank on the drivers, they\'re the ones steering the championship instead of the ego of one or both drivers, and for the novelty of that approach alone I think it\'s interesting to see.\n\nI think it\'s kind of a perfect storm for them to even be able to try this, and the reason I think that is also where I think the difference is between this season and something like 2016. What I think is key to McLaren\'s driver management this season is that neither Piastri nor Norris have won or seriously challenged for a title before. That means neither of them have effectively earned the right to be considered the ""default"" driver. While Norris is the more experienced and was a McLaren junior before F1, it\'s not really his team because Piastri has the arguably higher pedigree, with the F3/F2 back to back titles and the public coup that was his signing in the first place. At the start of last year, neither had won a race at all, and now they\'re battling for the championship. When you look at other teammate WDC fights, they\'re not so evenly matched (from the team\'s perspective), and that changes the driver\'s mentality too. 2016 was exciting because we\'d seen Rosberg beaten twice in a row - including very convincingly in 2015 - while Hamilton\'s stock grew as he racked up the championships. There was a very obvious underdog story going on that year that doesn\'t really apply this year because both drivers have pretty much equal stock. Incidentally, that\'s also part of why I think there\'s so much belief that McLaren are institutionally against Piastri - people like to root for the underdog, so when there\'s someone doing better you have to find some reason for it to be a heartwarming story too.\n\nSee what I mean - I have a lot of thoughts about how this is going, so compared to a season where one driver cruises to the title with no competition, I can never say this is a boring season. I think it\'s fascinating to see whether they can hold it together with this unusual management style, it\'ll be interesting to see whether those driver egos we expect are actually present and what the breaking point might be, and I\'m still as invested as ever in seeing every race because the gap is close enough that everything still matters.', 'I find it boring because the battles between Lando and Oscar are mild and uniteresting personalities. Lewis/Nico, Lewis/Max, Max/Charles were better to watch imo. \n\nSeems the interesting battles are between McLaren and Max/Charles/George, but the title decider is inside the team. \n\nI hope they start the real fight soon.\n\nThis is just me.', 'Mostly, there‚Äôs no inter-team battle, and there‚Äôs no drama between the two Mclaren contenders. What we‚Äôve had feeding the fight in the past was stuff like RB v. Ferrari (with all the hype that Ferrari itself brings), Max v Lewis (one of the biggest showdowns ever), Lewis v. Rosberg (friends turned enemies story), Alonso/Ferrari v. Vettel/RB, etc. \n\nNow we have the chillest guy against a guy that puts himself down at the first opportunity, and they let each other go through when requested. Hardly feisty narrative lol', 'I think it‚Äôs boring because the only possible intrigue is being neutered by McLaren trying to hyper manage driver/team relations out of fear. It‚Äôs not a team that looks strong and dominating, it‚Äôs a team that looks out of their element and scared to make mistakes. The car is doing extremely heavy lifting. The WCC is locked up and the WDC is being filtered through McLaren‚Äôs PR op. \n\nNot that the races aren‚Äôt worth watching anyway, but I honestly couldn‚Äôt give a crap about the title fight. Which is really odd, because it‚Äôs a resurgent team with two non-champions in the fight. It should be amazing, but it‚Äôs not. The only intrigue I have left for the title is if/when the reins come off this hand holding adventure.', 'Maybe on an individual level within McLaren, some might lean toward one driver or the other, but not the team as a whole. My biggest issue is that only Max can race them consistently; otherwise, the drivers end up fighting among themselves. When the team interferes with results, it doesn‚Äôt look good from the outside.\nAs for the racing being boring, I don‚Äôt think it is. Most events have delivered good competition and drama, and the upcoming tracks should provide more excitement, unless you only care about who finishes first.', 'I\'ve been thinking on this lately, particularly after some heavier, conflict-first (honestly, myself included) discussions after Monza. And, just in general. There seems to be a real disconnect between what we have on paper, and what us fans are experiencing. \n\nFor me personally, I find that I\'m able to get invested in the championship battle - though I have also never experienced this much ambiguity in the WDC standings. My first race that I watched live was literally Miami 2023, and it\'s been Max all the way down since then lol. Since I have no other battles to compare to, so I\'m able to get invested just in the ""ooh, what\'s going to happen?"" vibe. \n\nBut, I do have to ***work*** to get invested. It\'s intentional. Realistically, regardless of the media trying to hype up the battle, it just doesn\'t feel like there\'s blood on the line. I don\'t need to see Lando and Oscar truly hate each other, but I can\'t really think of any time we\'ve seen them emotional or pissed off, or that they truly *care* to beat the other. The intensity that as fans we\'re told to expect from the media hype, just isn\'t there. And that\'s the disconnect I think that folks are struggling to engage with as fans. We need to see more from the two of them that shows that this WDC *really matters*. \n\nThere\'s a real ""corporate identity above all"" vibe with McLaren that feels...off. It doesn\'t scream ""we\'re a racing team!"" it screams ""we are here to represent our sponsors."" Miscues and mistakes like Monza, and their response to those issues, compound this by giving us an *inkling* that they *might* choreograph their driver\'s on track positions. \n\nIt\'s odd. There\'s still something there, if you try to see it, but I don\'t blame anyone for not feeling like they really want to try.', 'I think we just lack a proper w2w Lando Oscar battle', ""It's because we're not watching a battle ‚Äî we're watching employees of the month.\nThey simply aren't hungry.\nI'm not even talking about the so-called 'killer instinct', but at least a sense of wanting to win the title.\nIf they don't care, it's hard to make the fans care"", 'Hard to get too hyped when I feel ambivalent about the outcome. Oscar and Lando are both great drivers. They\'re nearly equal on average. Oscar seems more consistent, while Lando seems to have more capacity for that unexpectedly stellar drive. But Oscar does that too sometimes. Given Lando has more experience, Oscar is arguably the better driver, but only slightly. Regardless of who wins, I\'ll be happy for the winner and sad for the runner up. Lando would be a more exciting win, coming from large points behind due to rotten luck at Zandvoort. And he\'s got the ""put in his time, so he deserves this"" aspect.\n\nThe other thing dragging any hype down is just how depressing the rest of the field is this year. Max putting in some amazing unbelievable drives but the car is still just not very good. Yuki getting promoted finally but bring a total dud, doesn\'t even seem like he\'s trying anymore. Fernando having some spectacular drives and great overtakes, but just miserable luck. Charles and the constant Ferrari fuckups. Carlos not being able to extract what he wants from the Williams. And of course Lewis, completely dejected, like he\'s lost his love for the sport because he just can\'t find a groove at Ferrari.\n\nWe\'ve got a few bright spots. The rookies are very promising. Hulk\'s podium. Williams doing pretty darn well for still running on a shoe string. But most of the drivers just seem unhappy this year.']",132,246,0.72,132,2658,2658,7,5,0.0,7

I mostly wanted to post this to encourage some discussion about what would work best for F1 in terms of rules/racing guidelines. We're never going to get to a consensus but it's a fun discussion to be had. ","['I think it\'s also worth noting that stewards *should* be looking at the incidents themselves and not the consequences of said incident. Which is very tough to do.\n\nIf you take consequence into action then a small bump, like let\'s say between Vettel and Leclerc in Brazil 2019, would be penalized heavier than someone spinning the other around where both can continue (Vettel and Verstappen 2018 for example). One being a racing incident and the other with a more obvious ""agressor"". \n\nBut if you don\'t take the consequence in action there will be situations where not everyone will be happy with the outcome because they feel it is either too light or too harsh of a punishment. I could name one in particular but I think most people have one in mind. \n\nAnd that\'s just one part of the decision making. Also if you leave it up to the drivers you\'ll just end up with situations where they\'ll just risk the penalty and be fine with it because they\'ll make up for it. That\'s not the way to go, it also will be inconsistent as hell.', 'My view is very simple: corner ownership is not real. If a car is meaningfully alongside, give space. The way people get a ""right"" to run others off is what has caused every other flashpoint this year.', 'The Drivers have pushed for stupid, stupid rules.\n\nOne lesson to take from this is don\'t let the drivers decide how the rules are implemented. It\'s like letting the inmates run the asylum.\n\nThe rules should be very simple and be what these guys have grown up being expected to do in junior racing:\n\n* If a car manages to get significant overlap they have to be given at least a car\'s width to the track edge\n* Signficant overlap could be defined in many ways but I would say at least front wheel ahead of rear wheel\n* No one can ever ""own"" a corner, any car alongside must be given space\n\nThis is how Leclerc raced Piastri and it resulted in a fantastic overtake, letter of the law, Leclerc was free to basically shove him out the way.\n\nMy proposed rules give more leeway to attackers to be confident they won\'t be taken out but makes defending still possible if done well, it would allow more multi-corner battling as cars would remain side by side without the current threat of being shoved off if the other driver claims the corner.', 'Take BEA/SAI for instance, in simple terms SAI established his overtake as per the rules by being ahead into the corner & apex. He must therefore be given sufficient room to complete the manoeuvre safely & within track limits. That room is entirely at the discretion of SAI to give or not give. SAI chose not to give room, BEA biffed him and was duly punished. It‚Äôs kinda perfect. BEA could‚Äôve withdrawn earlier, concede and not receive punishment; SAI could‚Äôve given more space and the two navigate that corner somewhat alongside each other instead of ruining each others progression - They didn‚Äôt. It requires you to know who you are racing and exercise some smarts.', ""Great read, thanks for the share. There's also a podcast featuring Mark, Josh and Edd from earlier this week which covers this topic.\n\nAs they mention in the article and the podcast, the drivers are the ones that have pushed for this. The issue is that written wording can never cover the vast array of racing scenarios.\n\nMark said on the podcast earlier this week, 'the stewards aren't inconsistent, the racing incidents are', but each incident is compared against a checklist that the stewards are being forced to use.\n\nSainz - Bearman was a good example of this. The rules as written didn't require Sainz to square off the corner, and because he's ticked the right boxes, the stewards are forced to give a penalty to Bearman."", ""Shout out to my favourite quote from the article, Jon Nobles suggestion:\n\n>A small part of me would love F1 to have no racing rules at all, and leave drivers to sort things out amongst themselves.\n\n>If anyone got pushed off wide or spun out in a race, they could take it up with their rival in the paddock afterwards - or exact their revenge at the following event.\n\nIn general for me the rules are just too strictly applied. I think there should be at least a clear marker for when another car needs to leave space. I don't mind the 'far enough alongside' guideline. I just think a bit more common sense should be applied rather than making the rule black and white. For me an attacker should always make sure the defender gets enough space to stay on track. The defender should get a bit more leeway. They can't always leave space, depending on what the attacker is doing. \n\nI also agree with Glenn Freeman that the stewards need to make more use of racing incidents. Not every collision is only because of one party."", 'That does mean that you need guidelines that determine when someone is meaningfully alongside. \n\nTo try to get a bit more discussion, when would someone qualify as significantly alongside for you? Does it change on the inside or outside of the corner or for is it different for the attacker/defender? Does it change when someone lunges in from far back with a lot of speed?', 'Thank you for the well written comment! Like you say it still gives both attacking and defending drivers enough room to race. Simple enough but you do get back to the age old problem of the stewards. Will they be able to be consistent enough with these rules. It does leave interpretation, mostly at the overlap part.', ""Making rules that make racing better is really difficult. There is no one size fits all rule for racing. Like you said, every incident is different. Interpretation of humans (stewards) will always be needed but because those stewards change a lot, consistency is hard to come by. \n\nThe Sainz-Bearman one is really a good example of following the letter of the law a bit too well. It just doesn't feel like that is what the rule is supposed to do/who the rule is supposed to protect. It also doesn't make the racing itself better. But hey at least the stewards were applying the rules consistently... yay?"", 'I really liked this line from Glenn:\n\nIt\'s an overregulated mess. And the teams and drivers must take quite a lot of blame for that. Whenever they are the victim of a clash on track, they want clear regulations that show why they were innocent, and for someone else to get a penalty. The moment they fall the wrong side of it, we hear all the \'let us race!\' nonsense.\n\nYou can\'t have it both ways. The participants should back off, and accept that sometimes they won\'t like the referee\'s decision.""']",0,16,0.38,0,15,15,0,16,0.38,0
