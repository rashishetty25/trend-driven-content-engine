They got introduced to F1 with a second-half career unchallenged Lewis that was in a dominant car, and therefore drove very gentlemanly. They never saw early Lewis. And then came Max, and people went nuts about his driving. Last year Leclerc essentially admitted he’d drive the same way if fighting for a title, Lando will probably drive like that this year, Piastri will and Kimi will too. Heck, maybe even Lewis will go back to his old ways if he can challenge for the title. Normalcy is returning to F1.', '>**Antonelli towards the debut in Australia: ""In F1 you have to be ruthless""**\n\n>The Australia GP will mark the return to F1 of an Italian pilot on an official weekend, with Andrea Kimi Antonelli who will debut at the wheel of the Mercedes W16 . The Bolognese pilot will thus complete its road to F1 reaching what she wanted to identify as a starting point rather than arrival. Despite this, the emotional component can only be intense on the eve of his first weekend in F1. Antonelli has already performed well with the W16 in Bahrain tests in terms of feeling with the car, but in a long interview released to the Sky Sport microphones he told how only by crossing the gates of the Melbourne paddock will manage to make how much road he really traveled.\n\n>**Antonelli: ""I will realize that I am in F1 only in the Paddock of Melbourne""**\n\n>Being a Formula 1 pilot involves numerous commitments from the winter stop, which Andrea Kimi Antonelli has said to have been intense in terms of preparation, inside and off the track. ""I stopped two weeks at Christmas and then went to Adidas, where I did some physical tests, then I did the first test, just to resume the pace a little,"" said the young Italian driver. ""I drove the Mercedes of 2020. A nice car monster."" Antonelli then told what is the feeling of being able to drive for the first time an F1 as a pilot holder on a race weekend; An emotion that, despite the first official commitments of the Prevalson, will only be unique when it arrives in the paddock in Australia. ""There was the event in London, then the Bahrain tests, but I think the first time I walk in the paddock will be the moment I will make and say \'it\'s all true\'."" \n\n>Before pointing his gaze to Australia, Kimi, however, recalled where all this began, with the video call of last summer in which the Mercedes leaders announced that he would lead Mercedes in 2025. ""I was at home with my parents and I made this video call and in which Toto were, James Allison, Bradley, all \'big\'. Toto immediately went straight to the point and said to me: \'I don\'t want to wait for you, next year you will be our F1 driver . I didn\'t sleep at the night, I was two hours to watch the ceiling. Relationship with Toto? He is a great person and I\'m happy to have a person like him by my side. "" \n\n>**Work with Bono and how the pressure is managed in F1**\n\n>But can an F1 pilot be afraid of something? ""As a child I was afraid of the darkness,"" said Antonelli. “A fear that maybe sometimes I can have is that of not performing, maybe to go to the track and say: \'But if not pierced and if I can\'t keep the same level? But I must say that on certain occasions it can help. "" A fear that the pilot who grew up in the Mercedes\' Academy, however, has been able to manage well to the sound of victories and titles conquered in the preparatory categories. Going beyond the pure performance gap of the vehicle available, one of the greatest changes that a pilot is facing is certainly due to the figures at his side. “On a race weekend for me and George there will be at least twenty engineers . It is very nice because however you go a lot more in detail. Maybe every engineer asks you a different thing about the car, obviously I interact a lot more with Bono [Peter Bonnington], which is my performance engineer , then there are all the others too. "" \n\n>Although today\'s rookie arrive in F1 with a level of preparation that is not a little advanced compared to what happened in the past, the pressure to be managed and the so -called \'to make the bones\' are aspects that only by experiencing the maximum protagonist category can you fully acquire. “It does not happen every day to be in this position, I had to work to arrive where I am now. I am happy to represent Italy in F1 and the goal is to bring the Italian flag back to the top step of the podium , "" he said speaking between past and present. A key role in his path Antonelli relegated him to the family and his father Marco, thanks to a decades of experience in Motorsport. “To manage the pressure in the first place I speak with my father . Then, however, a small group of people you trust and with whom you have the confidence that you can express how you feel, especially in the most difficult moments, is enough. "" \n\n>**On the opponents in F1: “I have already noticed how ruthless Max is. In F1 there are no friends. "" And then he jokes: ""On the kart I beat Leclerc\'s time""**\n\n>After his announcement as an official pilot, the 2006 Bolognese pilot took part in two free sessions, where he said he immediately understood what it means to run against drivers of the caliber of Max Verstappen. “I have already noticed how ruthless Max is , for example FP1 in Mexico I was preparing for this lap and he pulled me a detached just last sector of the last lap. Outside you have no friends, you have to be due because it is also a way to get respect from others . Obviously respecting the rules, but you have to show that you are not there to play, do seriously. "" Moving instead on a nicest anecdote, Kimi Antonelli told about when, during a holiday in Greece, he beat the record signed by Leclerc in a Kartodromo in Mykonos. “Apparently yes, I beat his time. It was very nice because they were kart for rental but modified, so I was impressed. "" To try to beat the Monegasque pilot and beyond, the Italian rookie will not have to wait much, because the GP of its debut in Australia is now upon us. ""I am sure that if you start on the right foot it will be a good year and it will be fun,"" concluded Kimi.', 'Very curious to see how this kid develop.', ""Love to hear it. He already has so much pressure on his young shoulders. But I'm genuinely rooting for this kid. And it feels so weird to call an F1 driver a kid but it's the first time an F1 driver is actually younger than me."", 'This season will be fun with so many rookies....and Stroll', 'Probably the Rookie I\'m most excited to watch this coming season.\n\nBearman is obviously my favourite, although the bromance Ollie and Kimi had whilst at Prema was great, and the vibes I get from Kimi as a result, and from subsequent interviews is that he\'s a great kid himself\n\nBut Kimi is the one going straight in at a top team\n\nIf the other rookies dont get results its kind of understandable, even Kimi really with the experience that he\'s going up against, and dont just mean Russell - But when he delivers its going to be exciting to see. Almost the same with Lawson at Red Bull, but because he\'s not coming into F1 with the same hype its not as ""exciting""']",2285,209,0.97,2285,183,183,113,9,0.0,113

I know there plenty of swearing; I think we can manage that fine with her (unlike her sister, who is really into potty words). \n\nLonger version: I used to watch F1 back in the 90s and early 2000s, even went to a race in Spa. I moved to the US for graduate school, and I fell off the routine due to time zones, lack of buddies that followed, and access to TV channels. I occasionally tried to restart, but life has been crazy and it\'s hard to get caught up with all the changes. Drive to Survive helped me catch up a bit and my kids are a bit older (5 and 8), so I finally committed to the F1 TV this year. I was trying to watch the 2024 races, and watched one with my two daughters, and they both loved it! The 5 year old liked it ok but lost her attention span (totally age appropriate), but my 8 year old daughter absolutely loves it, and I\'m so happy to have this together. We have watched last year\'s races till Canada (more to go, but the 2025 season is starting), and she is really interested in some of the strategy and humans involved. The first race we watched was when Sainz had appendicitis, and she\'s really rooting for Bearman for doing so well under crazy circumstances (and I think because he\'s young, like even young people can do impressive things). I would like to try a DtS episode with her, but I haven\'t had a chance to pre-screen it, and I would love your thoughts. \n\nFor context, she\'s a really ""good"" kid, so some moderate swearing is I think manageable with her. We discussed about swearing (people do it, it\'s inappropriate for a lot of contexts so don\'t repeat the words, but the people who swear aren\'t really doing something terrible, place for everything etc). I would not show it to the 5 year old because yes, she will repeat it as loudly as she can in the middle of the grocery store and at school haha.', ""Dumb question but why didn't Redbull jump on a chance to sign Carlos instead of Liam?"", 'Who are your personal picks for WDC/WCC?
