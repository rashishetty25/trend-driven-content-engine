1i4x2o2,Vettel's decline,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i4x2o2/vettels_decline/,2025-01-19, Discussion,"Already made this post with Ricciardo - now it's time for Vettel.

When do you think it was the beginning of the end for him, why was it so abrupt and did you ever get a glimpse of hope from him after that?

Personally even if he's a gentleman and won four WDC's, he's probably one of the least impressive multichampions as there were very few instances of him making the most out of bad machinery. For me it was Hockenheim 2018 when he was never the same after that.

Also interesting to see a parallel with Ricciardo, who much like Vettel, had this kind of abrupt downfall and wasnt very adaptable to different cars. ","['After he won the 2018 Belgian Grand Prix, he only won more Grand Prix. I think a combination of being comfortably beaten by Leclerc, having a woeful car in 2020 and the likelihood of a fifth title slipping away really destroyed his confidence and motivation.', ""The real peak of his success was getting the most out of the blown diffuser technology and when that became less significant his advantage waned. \n\n\nHe was still very good but he took three big psychological hits:\n\n-Losing to Ricciardo in 2014\n\n-Crashing out of the lead at the 2018 German Grand Prix (this was the biggest in my view, he never recovered after this)\n\n-It becoming clear he was going to be ditched for Leclerc\n\nWith hindsight he probably shouldn't have bothered with Aston Martin and retired at the end of 2020 because his heart clearly wasn't in it anymore."", ""He's probably the weakest 3x plus champion better he's stronger than some double WDC's. \n\nI don't think his decline was linear. I think he was very car sensitive. He was obviously good through 2008-2013 but possibly not always as good as he looked. In 2009, 2010 and the first half of 2012 Webber was closer than he would have been to a truly generational driver. \n\nObviously Ricciardo was better than him in 2014 but I think Vettel had a strong 2015. He then seemed to get slightly worse every year from then on."", '2020 knowing he would lose his seat and having that shit car. I think his motivation was gone and the decline was very big', 'I mean yeah it was general opinion around his prime that he wasn’t the best driver on the grid especially in 2012. That wasn’t the case when I was growing up with Schumer or even Max now', 'Get Vettel in a car that suits and he was a machine. One of the best, consistent, fast, great on tyres.  \n\nIn the earlier championship years, he wasn’t the greatest at wheel to wheel, but it rarely mattered and when it did, he normally managed to keep it together. I think a lot of was poor risk assessment, we had seen that in races throughout his career. \n\nEven in cars that weren’t great, there were glimpses of his talent (Silverstone, Japan, Singapore 2014, 2016 wasn’t terrible in a pretty lacklustre car, 2015 was very strong but car was decent). Much of this I class as a motivational issue, seen the same with Hamilton from time to time, once it’s clear you’re not racing for anything, then the extra few percent above the others goes away, often until a race a driver particularly enjoys comes and you see them reappear. \n\nI’m not sure Germany was the cliff drop everyone says it was, he come back in Spa, and Ferrari fumbled their development shortly after which stumbled his run for 2018, towards the end when Ferrari reverted to older spec the speed came back, but others has progressed in that time. \n\nUltimately I think it was the internal politics of Ferrari getting in the way, once Marchionne was gone, it was well rumoured Ferrari split into two camps, and the team wide support was gone. 2017 wouldn’t have helped, where Vettel crashed himself out of real contention for the WDC. This was his biggest career mistake, in an otherwise very strong season. \n\nHe brought the only real challenge to Mercedes/Hamilton until 2021, when his teammate was nowhere, podium most races in 2015/2016. In a car that suits him I put him above drivers like RIC, alongside ALO, NOR, but below HAM, VER.', ""Vettel was never a brilliant driver. Both Hamilton and Alonso commented on this when he was dominating. When he doesn't have a car that's clearly faster, he showed that he wasn't all that great. Good driver but not brilliant\n\n\nTo quote Hamilton : “I think lots of people in the paddock wish they could have Adrian’s car so they could show that they’re just as competitive as Sebastian,” Hamilton said. “Fernando, for me, is more accurate. He hits all the apexes.\n\n“Sebastian misses four apexes on a single lap and still goes quickest. He goes off and he still goes quickest. And I think ‘Holy crap, I couldn’t do that lap even if I was on the limit’. His car is just that far ahead of everyone else’s.”"", 'Vettel was the only driver capable of bringing the fight to Mercedes and Lewis for multiple years. \n\nTo be able to fight them, beat them and lead the championship a few times is seriously impressive when you look at the advantage they had since the hybrid era. \n\nI don’t understand how people think he’s not an impressive multi-champion. He also had a few great drives with Aston Martin.', 'I’d argue he didn’t decline. That Ferrari he ended up with was a dog (loose rear end) which didn’t suit him and by the time he was with Aston Martin he had become very vocal about his beliefs about the environment etc, which didn’t align with an F1 driver lifestyle.\n\nIs he an Alonso or Hamilton?
