The article itself was a fun read. I liked the line ""yet another Hail Mary strategy that came up twos rather than aces"". It was all very tongue in cheek, supporting their driver but also acknowledging his mistakes. \n\nHonestly, I think it\'s very interesting news that\'s worth reporting that Racing Bulls told a publication not to ask about his seat next year, and apparently insinuated not to talk about his demotion at the beginning of the year.\n\nFrom that, if the seats have been decided, I don\'t think Liam has one. But, I think it\'s more likely that they haven\'t been decided yet, at that they might not be decided for a while. But that\'s my fairly baseless speculation.', 'Bad title. Bad. No click for you.', ""Years ago, an editor imparted unto me that if someone doesn't want you to ask something, it's probably an (uncomfortable) truth.\n\nErgo, if Liam was fully secure in whatever he was doing in 2026, Racing Bulls wouldn't go around censoring fair and frankly rather innocuous questions. Reading between the lines and using the context provided, you can pretty well infer what's happened and why the question's been blocked.\n\nYou can say what you want about the headline or the premise of the article or the state of the F1 media, which I agree has been sullied by clickbait, poor research, and drivel masquerading as op-eds. But this is a brave and important piece calling out the obstruction of the press, a trend that I've noticed is rising in motorsport in recent years and exacerbating the erosion of real journalism.\n\nThat PR teams increasingly view the press as something to be censored suggests a failure of two things: properly training their drivers to be able to answer challenging questions, and building relationships with the media that serve both parties.\n\nThis second part is jeopardized when public relations entities control access and narratives to an unreasonable degree, thereby limiting journalists' ability to work ‚Äì\xa0and yes, as Mat's article says, often by speaking on behalf of otherwise cooperative sources. It's all about image control. And while in some cases image control is prudent, it's counterproductive and absurd when taken to an extreme, as it often is in racing.\n\nI know several other reputable racing journalists these days who feel powerless to do real reporting because they'll be yelled at, chased out, or denied access for deigning to do their jobs properly, which sometimes entails asking tougher questions because they're the only ones charged to do so.\n\nGood journalists generally aren't interested in engaging with this kind of coercive behavior, and many simply stop trying after a while ‚Äì\xa0which only invites more rubbish to the table. Mat alludes to the perils of this pretty well at the end, when he has to offer speculation instead of firsthand material.\n\nThe quiet protest of declining the invitation is exactly what should be done.
