The Monegasque immediately wanted to clarify the matter, denying any possible crisis with the team with which he has now competed for seven seasons and then focusing on the themes of the weekend on the Sakhir circuit , where Ferrari brings the first important updates of the season.\n\n\nLeclerc: “There are no negative things with the team”\n\n\nIn the days following the Japanese GP, many rumors circulated regarding Leclerc's statements , in which he repeatedly reiterated that he had found a direction in which to move to best manage the SF-25. Some saw this as a fracture within Ferrari, with the Monegasque intent on taking a different path than Lewis Hamilton, who would have been listened to more by the team.\n\nIn Bahrain, Leclerc clarified that none of this is true: “ I didn’t really understand where these rumours came from . What I said, and I repeat it now, is that there are no negative things in it. There is a direction that I found very interesting to go and work in, but it is done every year and I want to push in that direction. There is nothing of what I have seen written , that we are both going in very different directions or that the team was going in a different direction, none of that. Obviously we are all here to try to maximise the potential of the car and if I feel more comfortable putting the car in a different place, then it is positive for everyone .”\n\n\nProgress expected in Bahrain, not miracles\n\n\nFerrari arrives in Sakhir with some new features on the SF-25 that are highly hoped to help them turn around a disappointing start to the season. Leclerc believes that performance can benefit from this: “ We have some new features coming on the car, which I hope will help us close the gap a little bit . Will they be enough to close the gap completely? I don’t think there’s a lot in what we’re bringing here, but I hope it helps us at least get closer. It’s still a significant step forward .”\n\n\nLeclerc confirmed that the gap to recover on McLaren is 3 tenths, a gap he hopes to close completely when the next updates arrive: “ In Suzuka, the gap that was between us and McLaren was 3 tenths . We have to work hard to recover it, so that's what we're doing and I'm confident that we can close it.

Just to see what it was like. I wonder if he could set it up like he does the Red Bull. If he could I genuinely think he’d be faster.\xa0\n\nIn Australia Yuki qualified one tenth off of Max. However many would say Max is expected to be more than one tenth quicker than Yuki so was that made up time the Racing Bulls faster car?\xa0\nIn qualifying in China Hadjar was two tenths off Max. Most people would say that in an equal car Max would be a lot more than two tenths ahead of Hadjar.\xa0\nAlso last season, for the six races Yuki and Liam were team mates Yuki was better but it was close. This year there is a chasm between them.\xa0\n\nOn top of that the general consensus Ive seen on here is that Lawson would probably perform better in the Racing Bulls car, but yet they still say Red Bull is faster.\xa0\n\nThis is because of the way the car is set up for Max’s driving style.\xa0\n\nI do feel this is a little misunderstood by fans because as far as I have gathered from what Albon said on the high performance podcast “the car is what it is.” It’s the set up that Max changes. The other driver can try and choose a different less fronty set up but they will be nowhere near Max. So they have to try a similar set up to Max if they want to be close to him. But this leads to crashes and no confidence in the car.\xa0\n\nSo take a fast driver that is not Max. Let’s\xa0\xa0say Leclerc. Put Leclerc in the Red Bull and then the Racing Bull, which does he perform better in? I actually think it would be the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nI think the only argument that Red Bull is that Max couldn’t set up another car like he sets up the Red Bull.\xa0\xa0Of course it is hard to figure out weather this is true or not as Max has spent practically his whole career in Red Bull. Personally I think that Max’s set up is a factor but perhaps not to the same degree that some people argue.\xa0\nI also think for example that Verstappen would have likely put more than two tenths on Hadjar in China qualifying if both were in Racing Bulls. Thus Max would have set a faster time in the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nThere is also the argument to consider that Verstappen could also make set up changes to suit him on the Racing Bull which would make it faster for him. \xa0\nSo overall I would say that in qualifying pace Max would set faster times were he in the Racing Bull. Race pace is harder to say because there is usually a bigger gap between Max and the Racing Bulls. In fact race pace has been Red Bull’s big strength since the new ground effect era began in 2022, although even this could be exacerbated by the fact that over Perez’s whole career he was always better in races than qualifying.\xa0\n\nEither way it would be so interesting to see Max go into that Racing Bulls (obviously extremely extremely unlikely to ever happen) and it would be very telling about the performance of the two cars and Max himself’s talents (Were he to jump into the Racing Bull and put a huge gap on Liam and Hadjar, people could no longer argue Max is only good because he sets up his car so his team mate can’t drive it.\xa0']",77,37,0.93,77,34,34,8,3,-0.009999999999999898,8
