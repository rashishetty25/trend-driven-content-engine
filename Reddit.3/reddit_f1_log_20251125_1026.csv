And then at Aston a year or so later, Fallows finds the very same Adrian Newey is there again and has sort of gotten on the rocketship and now owns part of the team.  Shortly after, Fallows is gone.\n\nCowell was CEO of the team and in turn the previous Team Principal, Mike Krack, was set aside to make Cowell Team Principal as well as CEO.

1p5ejcx,"The Evolution, Impact, and Legacy of Ground Effect in Formula One",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5ejcx/the_evolution_impact_and_legacy_of_ground_effect/,2025-11-24, Technical,"Ground effect stands for one of the most significant aerodynamic breakthroughs in the history of Formula One. Its emergence in the late 1970s, later ban in the early 1980s, and controlled reintroduction in the 2022 regulations collectively show the complex interplay between engineering innovation, competitive advantage, and regulatory oversight. This essay examines the historical development of ground effect, the technical principles behind its success, the challenges that led to its prohibition, and its influence on modern Formula One design.

Early Aerodynamic Approaches in Formula One and their Evolution led by Colin Chapman

During the 1950s and early 1960s, aerodynamic optimisation in Formula One was minimal. Cars were designed primarily for reduced drag, with narrow tyres, high ride heights, and front-mounted engines. While this configuration produced high straight-line speeds, it offered limited stability and poor cornering performance. As the decade progressed, technological shifts—such as wider tyres, rear-mounted engines, and lowered ride heights—enhanced mechanical grip and stability, but aerodynamic understanding remained rudimentary.
A change in design philosophy occurred in 1968 with the introduction of aerodynamic wings. These early devices were unstable and sometimes hazardous, yet they showed off the effect of downforce on cornering capability. By the 1970s, front and rear wings had become fundamental components of car design, although they were primarily “top-mounted” solutions that did not meaningfully exploit airflow beneath the car. Colin Chapman, founder of Lotus, played a pivotal role in the development of ground effect. By the mid-1970s, Lotus had fallen behind its rivals, prompting Chapman and his engineering team to explore more radical aerodynamic strategies. Inspired by the Venturi principles seen in aircraft design, they theorised that shaping the car’s underbody like an inverted aerofoil could drastically increase downforce. Wind-tunnel testing confirmed their theory. By integrating Venturi tunnels within the sidepods and sealing the airflow with sliding skirts, Lotus created a low-pressure zone beneath the car that effectively “sucked” it to the track without the drag penalty associated with large wings. This marked the birth of ground effect in Formula One.

The Emergence of a New Aerodynamic Era pioneered by Lotus

Introduced in 1977, the Lotus 78 became the first Formula One car engineered specifically around ground-effect principles. Its extended wheelbase and enlarged sidepods housed the Venturi structures responsible for the car’s unprecedented performance. Although the design suffered from uneven pressure distribution and mechanical reliability issues, it proved the enormous competitive potential of under-body aerodynamics which would be built upon in further seasons. 
The 1978 Lotus 79 was a more refined example of the ground-effect concept. Engineers extended the Venturi tunnels and redesigned the rear suspension to stabilise airflow across a wider range of conditions. The car achieved extraordinary dominance, securing six victories, near-total qualifying superiority, and the World Championship for Mario Andretti. The Lotus 79’s success compelled rival teams to develop their own ground-effect solutions, marking a rapid escalation in aerodynamic innovation.

Competing Interpretations and Engineering Experiments

Several teams tried alternative applications of ground-effect principles, with varying degrees of success. Among the most notable was the Brabham BT46B “fan car,” which used an engine-driven fan to extract air from beneath the chassis. This produced immense downforce irrespective of vehicle speed and resulted in a dominant victory in its sole race. Although technically legal, the car was withdrawn due to political pressure within the sport. Other experimental designs—including Arrows’ inclined-engine venturi system and Ligier’s high-downforce bodywork—showed promise but lacked the refinement necessary for consistent competitiveness. These efforts nevertheless highlighted the diversity of engineering approaches stimulated by the ground-effect revolution.

Porpoising and the Safety Crisis

Despite its performance advantages, ground effect introduced new safety concerns. To maintain an airtight under-floor seal, cars were fitted with extremely stiff suspension systems that severely compromised ride comfort and stability. This rigidity, combined with variations in airflow, led to “porpoising”—a violent vertical oscillation caused by cyclical loss and reattachment of downforce, an issue that also became clear during the 2022 Formula 1 season. By 1981, porpoising had become a major hazard, and regulatory interventions followed. Sliding skirts were banned on safety grounds, and minimum ride-height regulations were introduced. Teams initially circumvented these rules through hydropneumatic suspension systems, but the FIA ultimately mandated fully flat bottoms for the 1983 season, effectively ending the ground-effect era.

The Reintroduction of Ground Effect in 2022

Ground effect returned to Formula One in 2022 under a new regulatory framework designed to improve racing quality. Modern cars incorporate controlled Venturi tunnels but lack sliding skirts, making the aerodynamic load less extreme and more predictable. While these designs significantly reduce turbulent wake, they have also reintroduced porpoising to a lesser but still notable extent. Teams such as Mercedes experienced pronounced oscillations early in the season, highlighting the enduring complexities of managing under-floor aerodynamics.

Conclusion

Ground effect stands as a defining chapter in Formula One’s technological evolution. From its pioneering development by Lotus in the 1970s to its eventual ban and controlled revival decades later, it proves the tension between innovation and regulation in motorsport. Its legacy continues to shape modern car design, offering valuable lessons about aerodynamic optimisation, safety, and the pursuit of competitive advantage. As the 2022 regulations show, the foundational ideas of ground effect remain as relevant today as they were nearly half a century ago.

In F1 spaces, there's a pretty strong consensus over where each driver relatively ranks. This post was prompted by [this discussion post asking who would be closest Max in the second RBR seat](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5ftxx/which_driver_from_the_current_grid_would/), where there's a clear favorite answer (Charles) and then some runners-up (George, Fernando, and Lando a few times), which seems to be about the usual ranking.

But like...how do you guys know? I get that different drivers have demonstrated fantastic W2W skill or pace or raw speed, but these things are obviously affected by the car. When comparing drivers who have never been teammates, e.g. Russell vs. Leclerc, in your mind, how do you compensate for machinery? Like, I don't think I could say George *wouldn't* have done even better than Charles in the 2022 Ferrari, or that Charles wouldn't have more race wins than George in the 2025 Mercedes. 

I guess related: where does the consensus in the relative quality of cars come from? This season, with all the VCARB/RBR shenanigans, I've heard that the RBR has a higher ceiling but the VCARB is easier to drive. But based on what we know (everyone not Max has done better in the VCARB than the RBR), it seems equally possible that Verstappen is just car Jesus who  would have won the championship in the VCARB and the RBR without him would be a backmarker—not saying this is true or I believe it, but it doesn't necessarily seem *less* true than the current popular opinion.

I think the boring answer is that fans will naturally reach consensus (especially with new fans coming in and learning about past seasons via memes/stories) and that F1 is fundamentally not a sport where you can compare drivers like that, but I might be/probably am missing something. So how do you compare drivers and cars?","[""Vibes\n\nAnd consider how they're performing compared to their teammates, how consistent they are, and in relation to the team/car's recent performances.\n\nBut mostly vibes."", ""For that discussion post you linked, the reason Leclerc is mentioned is likely more because he and Verstappen like similarly slippery cars + have known each other for a long time so they're often associated together. \n\nIf we're rating based on skill, you'll never find a clear consensus on the 2nd best after Verstappen. There are people on here who 100% believe Leclerc, Russell, Norris, etc. are all bums - when in reality they just don't like them. Sports are inherently biased, that's part of the fun but also frustration when speaking to other fans."", ""The general public have no clue, including myself.
