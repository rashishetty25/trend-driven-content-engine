1klhhks,Ferrari: There's an important test in Imola that could be worth a package.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1klhhks/ferrari_theres_an_important_test_in_imola_that/,2025-05-13, News,,"['So no upgrades in Imola but we get a test for the rear brake duct to see if Ferrari can see an improvement on tire management', 'p5-p7 instead of p6-p8 ü•∂', 'A new dosage of hopium has dropped but Fred my man, the stuff is getting weaker and weaker.', ""Translation \n\n\nFerrari is facing the almost dramatic technical balance of this first part of the season. The SF-25 was unable to live up to the great expectations of the beginning of the year. The car proved to be semi-unknown in the first laps of testing, which made Maranello realize that it had to fight important, totally unexpected limits. Disqualification aside, Miami was the low point for Fred Vassuer's team, with the car that - on a difficult track anyway - competed in the role of fifth force behind the Williams, reaching the finish line almost a minute behind the McLarens. A scenario that was not even imaginable in the most negative expectations of the beginning of the year. The post-GP debrief had many points for reflection and Lewis Hamilton in particular discussed the implementation of some choices on the track. There was not much positive to bring from Florida. Looking at the data, numerically it is as if Ferrari had been a year behind in development ,seeing the average gap suffered by the MCL39. The race for updates is something that might not be enough, which is why, as we already told you exclusively last week , Loic Serra has apparently made the decision to push for changes to the mechanical platform with interventions to the rear suspension.\n\n\nThe mistakes made on the SF-25 originate in the idea behind the concept. The puzzle is ‚Äúsolved‚Äù and the development plan has changed\n\n\nImola is one of the two big home events of the Prancing Horse team, which is why, regardless of the problems, there is great expectation around the team. Ferrari arrives in Imola with simulator work still in progress that sees both Prancing Horse drivers busy in arriving with the best setup, an aspect in which there were several difficulties in Miami. The information we have on the evolution front of the SF-25 allows us to say that the development program has changed substantially . All this since the critical issues of the SF-25 emerged, limited by a rear end that mechanically does not allow it to fully exploit the aerodynamic needs of the surface . The potential that Frederic Vassuer refers to is hidden behind a single-seater that cannot express the real aerodynamic load available, seen only in very few glimpses of this first part of the season.\n\n\nProject 677 changed the entire mechanical platform compared to the SF-24, with a change of layout at the front and a completely updated and extreme rear suspension in concept despite remaining a tie rod.  Someone in the corridors of Ges believes that a mistake was made in the operation of the car . in other words they failed to interpret the aeromechanical platform correctly, remaining faithful to some concepts of the old car despite the radical changes.\n\n\nIn Emilia-Romagna no big package: in 2024 the evolved SF-24 arrived in Imola, today we wait to see (also) what happens with the directive from Spain. The corrections of 2025 will be profound if it is worth it.\n\n\nThe wind tunnel simulation data has always given very positive feedback in terms of the amount of load generated, however this cannot be fully exploited. With the problems revealed in Australia, Loic Serra has carried out an ‚Äúinterim‚Äù job to unravel the SF-25 enigma , up to considering a possible and almost concrete ‚Äúin-season‚Äù intervention on the rear mechanics. All this has led to a reorganisation of the developments planned for the SF-25, with the exception of the Bahrain package, already decided before Australia.\n\n\nLast year, the Imola race was one of the most important stages of the year in terms of development, while this year on the banks of the Santerno river it is worth noting that the possibility of introducing an updated SF-25 in the floor or body has never been examined . Everything has been postponed until after the Spanish GP , and is currently in the pipeline both in terms of decision-making and timing. Barcelona represents a watershed on the technical front to understand how the balance of cars with stiffer wings will change, especially for those teams that have based much of their firepower on the deformation of the front. The attitude on the technical directive front from Ferrari has returned a fair neutrality on the possible advantages and disadvantages of tightening the static controls of the front wings, but it is no coincidence that for many teams large evolutionary packages for the floor and body are planned for after Spain.\n\n\nAt Imola there will be Serra who is working quietly. While Ferrari will test an experimental rear brake grip, it is no coincidence\n\n\nTechnical director Loic Serra is expected to return to the track, inside the Scuderia garages to closely monitor operations. AutoRacer has information that suggests Imola will be a round with no significant new features on the SF-25. At the circuit named after Enzo and Dino Ferrari, the red car is scheduled to carry out a one-off test involving the use of a new rear brake duct , updated in the internal ducts, both for aerodynamic reasons and for different cooling management.\n\n\nIt is clear that both Ferrari and other teams, as we have already told you , are trying to replicate the ‚ÄúMcLaren effect‚Äù to avoid overheating the rear tires through the internal fluid dynamics of the baskets. The test will be a real experiment on the track to see the effect on the tires, to verify any advantages and disadvantages in conditions that are difficult to faithfully replicate in simulation. In Bahrain, as we have told you , the rear brake intake had been updated in the internal ducts, even if this type of modification may not be ‚Äúlisted‚Äù in the lists of technical innovations that the FIA releases every race weekend, which is why it is likely that this one may also be omitted. The modifications will also affect the wheel corner where the fins located in the internal area of the brake intake will be updated."", ""They thought they had reached the development ceiling with the SF24 and decided to change the suspension layout with the SF25, among other things. On paper, it was the right direction, but somehow, it hasn‚Äôt translated to the track, leaving Ferrari engineers puzzled as to why the simulations differ so significantly from on-track performance. I believe they‚Äôve started to understand how the SF25 works and are making arrangements to redirect the team's efforts as soon as possible so the championship isn‚Äôt completely lost.\n\nAs a Ferrari fan, I do hope they find the answers on home soil at Imola, giving us a sign of revival and momentum for the rest of the season."", 'So effectively they‚Äôve found the mistake with the car and identified a fix, however they‚Äôre concerned that the advantage McLaren has is already too large. So they‚Äôre bringing forward some of the changes in their next major update to test at Imola and see if they bring a big enough performance boost. If they do, they‚Äôll continue to develop the car to try to win the championship. If they don‚Äôt, then they‚Äôre going to transition fully onto the next set of regulations to try and jump the other top teams.\n\nReading between the lines a bit here too, but that seems to be the gist of it. So looking like they might be the first top team to give up on this year if the updates they‚Äôve already scheduled don‚Äôt propel them into the championship. Honestly, sounds like a reasonable plan. They might as well get a headset on next year compared to the other top teams if they‚Äôre already too far behind this year.

1klugaz,Timing tower,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1klugaz/timing_tower/,2025-05-13, Discussion,"I'm watching the 2020 Sakhir GP right now because of the YouTube marathon and I realized how much I miss that timing tower.¬†


It's very readable, the contrast between all the colours is a lot better and it's shorter because only the lap counter is shown and not the big unnecessary F1 race logo (if you're watching a race, you'll know it's an F1 race... You really don't need that logo to know that) at the top that is kind of wasted space, and the gaps between the positions are not as big leading to as timing tower that doesn't extend to the bottom of the screen and isn't unnecessarily big.¬†


Also some other points:


- When the current tyres are shown, the tyre compounds symbols are so much more readable with the red/yellow/white ring around the letter that indicates the compound instead of that flimsy letter in the tyre colour we have now (where especially red does not nearly have enough contrast to the black background), the time gap is also shown to one decimal (for example 2.0) so you know the rough timing gaps AND the tyre compounds at the same time. (Also no CGI tyre compounds at the begin of the race, looks much better)¬†


- The numbers indicating the drivers' position have a white background which makes them much easier to read.¬†


- The timing background is a bit transparent so you can see some stuff that's happening when something is behind the tower.¬†


- Yellow flags actually display the sector where the yellow is shown... Why would you not show that in this year's version? Why would you only show that there's a yellow somewhere on track but not where?¬†


- The \^‚ñºindicating how many places¬† a driver has lost/gained relative to their starting position is much more readable. The ones whe have now are way to thin and the red doesn't have enough contrast in comparison to the black background, leading to bad readability.¬†


- I feel the font for the timing gaps is a tad bolder/thicker which definitely helps readability.¬†


- The inly thing I'd probably keep from the current tower might be the team logos instead of team colour stripes.


What else I'd change about the current timing tower:


- When showing battles for x position (for example battle for third) - the timing gap in the tower dissappears. So you don't know how big the gap is when two cars are fighting, even though it's pretty much the most important thing imaginable to know the gaps at that moment. So¬† it would be nice if these could be displayed again (I have seen some inserts at the bottom of the screen that do show the gaps, but they aren't always there and I'd still like them to be displayed on the actual tower, so I can keep an eye on the rest of the gaps more easily).¬†


- In qualifying, instead of showing IN LAP and OUT LAP in the space where the lap times should be, show a little symbol with I or O next to the timing gaps similarly to the P that is shown to indicate someone in their pit box.¬†


- Show us +5/+10 next to the driver's name when they get a penalty they haven't served yet. I really thought we had that in recent years, but I can't find it anywhere so maybe I'm imagining things.¬†

Conservatives and reformers are unable to reach an agreement. Critics fear that the sport will suffer if improvements are not made now.**\n\n> Never before has a new set of regulations been as controversial as the one we\'re facing in 2026. Although everyone is still in the planning and testing phase, many are already seeing specters. Perhaps rightly so. The only thing that is certain is that these regulations were poorly written. Now, we have to pay the price elsewhere for issues that couldn\'t be agreed upon two and a half years ago for political reasons.\n\n> The problem with a drive system that is supposed to draw 45 percent of its total power from the battery is charging the necessary energy during racing. Without recuperation on the front axle, this is only possible with unsatisfactory alternative solutions. For example, up to 30 percent of the total fuel supply in a race is used to charge the battery via the combustion engine. And to allow the cars to coast as early as possible on the straights, active aerodynamics must drastically reduce drag by flattening the wings.\n\n> This can cause many problems. For example, depending on the battery level, it leads to significant performance differences during certain phases of the race. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner predicts two consequences: ""On the one hand, this will lead to increased lift-and-coast behavior. On the other hand, the cars will be in DRS mode practically all the time. So there will be no overtaking assistance.""\n\n> **Less electric power in the interest of sport.**\nHorner is the voice of the warning voices. Ferrari is keeping a low profile, but thinks the same way. Newcomer Cadillac is in favor of any form of simplification. As the official engine manufacturer from 2029, the Americans are now entitled to vote, but not on issues affecting the years 2026 to 2028.\n\n> FIA President Mohammed bin Sulayem has apparently sided with the Red Bull faction. The issue was high on the agenda at both the engine summit in Bahrain and the last Formula 1 Commission meeting. It appears as if the FIA \u200b\u200bpresident wants to prevent a bankruptcy. If the races degenerate into economy runs, that would backfire on the FIA. It approved these rules in August 2022.\n\n> Horner deftly poked at this wound: ""If it\'s in the interest of the sport that we avoid too much lift-and-coast, then I think it\'s worth considering reducing the electric power in racing. It doesn\'t change the specification or the performance of the engine. It\'s just about battery usage.""\n\n> **Less power, different battery.**\nProponents of a rule change had prepared charts supposedly showing that the car would still be fast with 200 kilowatts instead of 350 kilowatts from the electric reserve. The difference per lap would supposedly be only 0.6 seconds. The opposing side also considers Horner\'s statement that nothing would change in the hardware to be optimistic. Mercedes, Audi, and Honda believe that the battery architecture would have to be adapted under the circumstances. This would require a significant financial investment.\n\n> But there are also practical concerns. The teams would have to prepare for two completely different disciplines during the free practice sessions: qualifying, with around 750 kilowatts of system power (1,020 hp), and the race, in which only 600 kilowatts (815 hp) would be available.\n\n> To avoid sending cars with excessively different performance levels onto the track at the same time, free practice sessions would have to specify when to prepare for what. This would further complicate an already far too complicated set of rules.\n\n> **Unfair to change the rules of the game.**\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff represents the group of those who want to give the 2026 regulations a chance. ""The closer we get to a new regulation, the more we all act in the interest of our teams. That\'s our duty. We don\'t know how things will go next year. Will we experience a disaster with energy recovery in Baku or Monza? We hope not.""\n\n> The Austrian doesn\'t want changes based solely on projections. The hardware must remain as it is. ""What\'s possible is within the software\'s scope. We\'ll see the final product at the tests next year. As power unit manufacturers, we want a great show. We want to win, but we\'re also aware that there has to be variability and unpredictability in this sport.""\n\n> While Mercedes enjoyed the 2014 season, when it smashed everything in the first year of its current hybrid powertrain, Wolff said, such dominance over a longer period is detrimental to the sport. ""The FIA \u200b\u200bproposed this engine. Nobody liked it. 50 percent electric drive was the direction for road cars at the time and a reason to attract manufacturers like Audi and Porsche. So we implemented it.\n\n> Wolff warns against changing the rules before a single wheel has turned. It would be unfair to those who were lured into Formula 1 by these regulations. ""Honda has recommitted itself for precisely this reason, and Audi has joined. We, too, are not interested in changing these rules at this point. But we must be open-minded and respond to grievances if necessary.""\n\n> **Sustainable fuel too expensive.**\nThere\'s already some quiet criticism of the development of sustainable fuels. With a price per liter in the three-digit range, they\'re not a relevant contribution to the series. And it\'s hitting the customer teams hard. They have to pay for the fuel. This can easily add up to additional costs of $20 million over a year. Alpine CEO Flavio Briatore admits: ""The most expensive thing right now is the bench testing with the new fuel.""\n\n> Horner explains the high prices by saying that fuel manufacturers are currently engaged in an expensive development race. ""Fuel is potentially one of the most important differentiators for engine performance. That\'s what makes it so attractive for manufacturers. Development costs money.""\n\n> Wolff adds: ""One reason for the high costs is that the entire supply chain and the energy contribution must be environmentally friendly. To achieve this, you need a certain specification of ingredients, which are very expensive. Therefore, we need to examine whether we can reduce the price per liter.""\n\n> Indeed, one must be careful when calculating prices. This includes the entire development costs from the very beginning to the first use. Since the suppliers of the molecules require certain sales volumes, this also has an impact on the initial order. Shell, ExxonMobil, BP/Castrol, Petronas, Eni, and Aramco also have to pay a high price for advertising space on their cars. All of this is passed on to the customers, and this also drives up the price per liter.\n\n> The price is actually covered by the regulation\'s requirement for a so-called drop-in fuel. It states that only e-fuels that also work in a road car, can be produced in large quantities, and can be sold at a reasonable price at a gas station are acceptable.', ""I don't remember the 2014 engines having this much negative press beforehand.\n\nHonestly though, if it's a disaster, I'm here for it. Give me some more unreliability."", 'I agree with Wolff, give the regulations a chance and then make changes as necessary.

In 2025, the Formula 1 World Championship is a multi-billion-dollar industry, criss-crossing the globe over a 24-race season that captures worldwide attention every grand prix weekend.

The drama created by the world's best racing drivers is documented in the Netflix series Drive to Survive, which has helped the sport grow further in popularity in recent years. An F1 movie, starring Brad Pitt, is due to be released next month.

It's a far cry from its beginnings in 1950, when just seven races made up the first World Championship. It began with the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on 13 May, watched by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and won by Italian Giuseppe Farina.

From Farina in 1950 to Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Lando Norris in 2025, F1 has produced thrills, controversy and tragedy. Here, BBC Sport and Getty Images tell the story of the sport, and the characters that have illuminated it, through a selection of the best photographs from the past 75 years.",['75th repost anniversary'],25,2,0.77,25,1,1,2,0,0.020000000000000018,2
