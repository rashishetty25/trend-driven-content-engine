Watching Hadjar hold his ground in 4th today behind Verstappen (bumped up to 3rd with Norris' DNF) got me wondering this. Obviously, there's plently of jokes about the curse of the second Red Bull seat, and Hadjar getting threatened with a ""demotion"" to Red Bull if he keeps doing well. But honestly, is RB better right now?

I mean, Lawson got off to a miserable start in Red Bull. Then he got 'demoted' to RB and has looked much better since. Yuki looked like he was better off last year at VCARB than he is now at Red Bull (though he's looked a little better since Horner got sacked). Hadjar has looked better than Lawson and Tsunoda, and he's been able to stay at RB. We always hear Verstappen complaining about how shit his car is (sometimes before he pulls off a miracle). I can't help but wonder if Verstappen would look better in an RB car? I mean, what if RB has been the faster car for a few races now and Verstappen has just been working his usual Verstappen magic to make the Red Bull not look as horrible as it is?

Seasons pass, person still holds on, thinking ... the day will come... and then the day comes, and it\'s too late.  It\'s old school Independent Team mentality.  \n\nHorner shouled have stepped aside, given himself a new role description like Zak, and elevated Wheatley to TP.\n\nMuch like Toto showed that he wasn\'t a natural leader, trying to keep the status quo, rather than reward people to stop them from leaving.', ""Horner's reputation could be a factor but it is also a natural situation that people who have been in their position for quite a long time look for something new.

These rules of engagement are not conducive for actual racing. A driver can simply be ahead at the apex, know they have right of way, meaning they can just drive to the outside of the corner knowing they cannot be challenged, or if an accident occurs knowing they will not be at fault.

We need cars to go side by side to overtake, it‚Äôs just a fact. If a car can hold the outside line, for almost the entire corner, and be almost in line or at least half way up to the car alongside it, the inside driver should be required to leave one cars width in the exit.
