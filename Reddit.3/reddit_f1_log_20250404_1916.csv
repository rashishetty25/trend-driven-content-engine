Imagine doing this all the time, and suddenly it doesn\'t work because of a fraction too little brake pressure.\n\nSeems like a systemic flaw here. Whatever you may feel about manually closing DRS being the ""right"" way, such a small difference should not result in a huge, dangerous loss of down force.\n\nAnd the manual closing dependence isn\'t particularly safe either, it\'s this kind of risk why driver operated wings were originally banned in the first place.

Their simulator and windtunnel don't correlate with what they are seeing on track. So the problems from last season are still the problems this season."", '>Sporting director Helmut Marko was annoyed: ""Whenever the simulator cheers, the basic setup on the track isn\'t right. We should review our processes in the simulator.\n\n2019 and 2020 again for Red Bull Racing, lmao.', 'Translation and full article:\n\n> McLaren continued its upward trend on Friday\'s practice session at Suzuka. The papaya-shaped racers once again set the pace. Their biggest rival is Mercedes. Red Bull, on the other hand, continues to struggle with its car. We\'ve compiled the key findings in our analysis.\n\n> Four red flags in the second practice session cost the teams 38 minutes of track time. The long runs also fell victim to the interruptions. And on the fast laps between accidents and grass fires, much depended on how the drivers navigated traffic and completed their preparation laps.\n\n> The picture is somewhat distorted. The morning\'s long runs had to compensate for the missed race simulations in the afternoon. The picture is relatively clear here. McLaren is also setting the tone in Suzuka. Mercedes and Ferrari are following. Red Bull is still in deep trouble. The white-painted cars were completely out of balance.\n\n> Neither the base setup, for which the engineers had high hopes, nor the setup adjustments made in the afternoon worked. However, the sister cars from Toro Rosso once again showed strong early form. This is still impressive considering that Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson had increased their engine power for their fast laps.\n\n> Although Nico Hülkenberg had the best long run on paper on the medium tires, the Sauber driver was running on less fuel than the top teams and only completed four laps. ""The car felt decent, was better in the second practice session than in the first,"" Hülkenberg reflected. Both Sauber cars were equipped with the new underbody and rear wings in the afternoon.\n\n> **Is McLaren superior again?** Both fastest times on Friday went to a McLaren driver. In the first session, Lando Norris had the edge. His lead over George Russell was 0.163 seconds. In the afternoon, teammate Oscar Piastri set the pace. The Australian beat Norris by 0.049 seconds and Isack Hadjar by 0.404 seconds. The internal duel between the McLaren drivers was decided in the chicane. Whoever made the cleanest passage there had the fastest time.\n\n> The Papaya racers\' dominance continued in the long runs. Norris averaged a time of 1:33.361 minutes over seven laps, making him one and a half tenths faster than Russell, who, however, also completed three laps longer. The McLarens again showed remarkable performance in maintaining their lap times almost consistently, while their rivals began to experience noticeable tire degradation as the distance increased.\n\n> **Does Mercedes have a chance of winning?** Mercedes is the second-best team. George Russell felt comfortable right away and maintained his high level throughout the day. Even taking into account Mercedes\' usual early form on green tracks on Friday, Russell is the first challenger to McLaren. This is also underscored by the second-best long run in the first practice session.\n\n> The Englishman calls it a positive day and predicts: ""If everything goes well, we can finish on the front two rows."" Suzuka rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli is still lagging behind. The Italian lost more than a second to his team captain in both practice sessions. This shows that Suzuka is a track that\'s not easy to learn in a flash. Antonelli admitted: ""I didn\'t get the most out of the car in the first sector. George showed what\'s possible.""\n\n> Ferrari was just behind Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton beat his former teammate Russell by 23 thousandths of a second. In the endurance test, however, the Silver Arrows were faster. Russell averaged 1:33.489 minutes over ten laps. Charles Leclerc completed eight laps and achieved an average time of 1:33.566 minutes.\n\n> **How does Tsunoda fare against Verstappen?** In the first practice session, Yuki Tsunoda lost just 0.107 seconds to Max Verstappen. The world champion had to overtake six cars on his fastest lap, which reportedly cost him around three-tenths of a second. In the afternoon, the lap times were not comparable. Verstappen drove on soft tires, while Tsunoda stuck with the medium. Nevertheless, Tsunoda performed significantly better than Liam Lawson or even Sergio Perez last year.\n\n> What is worrying, however, is the overall shape of the Red Bull RB21. The car alternates between understeer and oversteer. Verstappen reported on the radio that it felt as if the car was bending. The Red Bull\'s severe sliding accelerated tire wear.\n\n(1/2)', 'If Max’s manager is not in Japan, I can put my tinfoil hat on and come up with a theory.', ""Max probably doesn't even remember how to drive a balanced car at this point"", 'The McLarens are Papaya shaped now?', 'In before Max P3']",281,170,0.88,281,161,161,32,10,0.010000000000000009,32

Wish we could get more thoughtful F1 articles from within the sport. \n\nI enjoyed the quotes from his race engineer and his trainer. \n\n>""His introspection and tendency to self-criticism come in useful on the track. “The foundation that allows Lando to succeed is how open and with how much humility he shows in receiving feedback and criticism,” says his performance coach Jon Malvern, 34, who has worked with the driver since he was 13. “He genuinely listens to \\[feedback\\], no matter how uncomfortable it makes him feel at the time.” He’s a fast learner, with “an amazing ability of leaving the track one evening frustrated and then returning the following day having digested it, with ways to overcome the issue,” Joseph adds. As to his attitude? “He is a kind-natured person,” Malvern says. “But extremely competitive.”\n\nAnd this part about honesty has always been my opinion on Lando:\n\n>Norris seems to have a strong sense of justice. “He is a very honest person, and works best when people are honest and frank with him too,” his race engineer says. “If he feels strongly about something, he will say it.”\n\nI still think that\'s why he and Max get along. Same perspective. \n\nI also liked this:\n\n>Even your fiercest rivals. “As soon as the helmet’s on, you forget about all of these things,” he says. “It’s a different world, you’re in a different mental state. You don’t give the guy one more metre because you’re friends with him or do a sport with him, right? In my view it’s the opposite. It makes you give them one less metre because you’re able to trust them more. But then you also know how they act, when to maybe not trust them. It is a complicated balance but it’s not a bad one in my eyes.” He cites his older brother: “He’s always the biggest competitor I’ve had. That’s the same as with your friends. You always want to beat them and prove that you’re better. So those guys are my biggest competitors but my friends off the track — and when I’m on track I want to beat them more than anything.”\n\nIt reminded me of how he and Daniel did so well in giving each other the space when Lando overtook Danny in Mexico 2023.', 'That’s why I could never be a F1 driver.

All this talk about Road Relevancy in regards to other parts of the powertrain and then dumping a big ol' V10 in the back is very confusing. \n\nMaybe they're planning to up the electric output as well? 60% Electric and 40% ICE with the V10 kinda there for show? In that case wouldn't a V8 be fine? Hell even an NA 6 Cylinder would get the job done and fix the sound issue"", ""The cycle continues.\n\n2009 they changed the rules to improve the racing and it got more competitive and had so many great races\n\n2014 they changed the rules to suit the manufacturers and it ruined the racing and killed competition\n\n2021 they changed the rules to improve the racing and it got more competitive again\n\n2026 they're changing the rules to suit the manufacturers and people are already pre-emptively seeing the new rules are a potential disaster and looking for changes, but the manufacturers will not be moved\n\n  \nTo elaborate further, between 2009 and 2013 we saw tons of close competition, endless exciting races, and 6 or 7 teams capable of winning races on merit, from Ferrari through to Lotus and Williams and even Brawn winning a title in their solo year before being purchased by Merc. \n\nAfter much lobbying from manufacturers and Mercedes in particular, in 2014 the hybrids were introduced. And they achieved exactly what Mercedes wanted in handing them dominance, allowing their marketing department to talk about hybrid efficiency, and eliminating the chances of non-manufacturer F1 teams like Red Bull, McLaren, Lotus etc of being competitive like they were in the previous seasons due to the wild complexity of the new engines and the difficulty for a customer team in integrating them as efficiently as a works team.\n\nIt came to the massive detriment of the sport of course, with spiralling costs that put some teams out of business and cars that were slower than GP2 at some races, and vastly slower than the cars that preceded them. To save the embarassment of the incredibly slow cars they introduced wider tyres and bigger cars with much more aero in 2016 to cover up the inadequacies of the power unit. This clawed the laptime back but left us with the barges we have today that barely fit around tracks like Monaco.\n\nSo after a few years of zero competition, the engines did finally start to reach parity and all the teams were getting to grips with them, and we got new chassis rules in 2022 designed to improve the racing, which have worked reasonably well and given us the closest, most competitive racing we've had in years. This has led to upstarts like McLaren and Red Bull getting back in the mix again. So of course we've ended up with 2026 rules being announced shortly after this formula was introduced, designed to give engine manufacturers everything they want again with a complete disregard for the other teams.\n\nAll the data that people have been discussing has shown the plans for the new engines will result in much slower cars, and once again like 2016 they're looking for ways to enhance the aerodynamics to cover up the inadequacy of the power units, this time with moveable aero.\n\nI see the idea of switching back to V10s as a plan to ensure F1 remains a sport and not just a completely uncompetitive marketing exercise for car manufacturers, like it was from 2014 to 2020. It would result in cars that are cheaper to build, smaller, more nimble, more lightweight, and naturally faster.  \n  \nOf course the manufacturers are not going to support this. It's no surprise that the only manufacturers showing support for a return to more sensible engines are Ferrari, for whom racing is in their DNA, and Red Bull, who are only there to race and were effectively forced to become a manufacturer to survive the upcoming rules.\n\nMBS has faced a ton of criticism, a lot of it tinged with racism I find more than any real substantive criticism, but I do feel like he's consistently been doing his bit to push back against supremacy for car manufacturers and ensuring that F1 is a proper sport and not just a marketing exercise for car makers, from moves like this to his attempts to get Andretti on the grid."", ""I hope they do V10's a little differently this time, it could mean allowing more addictive manufacturing or they can go full radical with oval/oblong pistons"", ""These pesky modern noise regulations don't play well with V10 's scream.

Ryo had a really admirable FP1 today. I am not placing undue importance on finishing order in free practice, or making a big deal that he finished ahead of Gasly, but for how little time he's had in any F1 car, he did remarkably well. He wasn't afraid to push the car, and clearly Alpine had the faith in him to let him. Too often rookie FP1 sessions just have the rookies all at the back playing extremely safe.

Ryo starting racing at the quite late age of 13, after watching the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton won that day. Ryo saw those F1 cars, and he wanted to race. A year later, he won the 2008 all Japan junior kart championship.

Since then, he's had incredible success in Super GT, WEC, and Super Formula. But he's clearly always had interest in racing in the rest of the world and being part of F1. He stopped racing in Super GT when he got the opportunity to join WEC (and he won WEC hypercar that year, and the next year). When he got the oppotttunity to be an F1 test and reserve driver, he left Super Formula as well, so now he only does WEC amd F1 work. I’d love for him to get even just one F1 race. 

I’m not trying to take Doohan's seat from him. But I am saying that maybe he shouldn’t race this weekend. That was a massive crash. Also, the team has Ryo right there who knows the track really well and was proper quick in FP1.

1jrc6te,Will there be a different standard of success for Yuki?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jrc6te/will_there_be_a_different_standard_of_success_for/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"We finally have some track time for Yuki in the Bull, and he’s definitely looking promising. This makes me wonder if there might be a different standard for success for Yuki this season? He clearly was not a favorite of team management in the way he has been looked over for the second seat. It was only due to extraordinary circumstances that he now has a drive next to Verstappen (seeming begrudgingly so on behalf of Marko and others / split with Honda, etc). Since the indication was that Yuki would be gone from the Racing Bulls at the end of the season, do you think “just get close to Max” or “just get into Q3” might not be enough to save his drive at the end of the season? I’m a huge Yuki fan and hope he has a long career in whatever drive he wants in F1, but worry I’m setting myself up for disappointment regardless of how close he gets to Max. ","['If he does well in the first race, it will immediately raise the bar for the next race.

1jr6xff,Is it justified if Alpine get rid of Doohan early?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jr6xff/is_it_justified_if_alpine_get_rid_of_doohan_early/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"So going into the season there were a lot of rumours that Alpine would replace Doohan after about five races. And those rumours were fuelled by Alpine signing Colapinto and 3 other reserve drivers. They also never publicly said that Doohan would stay even if he performed well.

Many fans, understandably, were outraged and felt for Jack. He had barely driven an F1 car and there were already rumours that he would be out the door after the flyaway races that kickstart the season. 
His crash this morning have sparked more even discussions about this and I've seen people discussing weather Alpine should replace him. 

So let's go through his season so far and see what we make of it. 

In testing, Doohan performed well enough. He was close enough to Gasly and actually set a faster time on day 2. 

In Australia it actually got off to a decent start and thoigh he went out in Q2 there was a feeling he had the pace to go faster but was impeded by yellow flags after the Hamilton spin. 
So He would start P14, 5 places off Gasly. 

However come race day it was all over in 5 corners after he spun off as they left sector one on the opening lap. Many other drivers did crash that day so you have to give him some forgiveness but I feel as though this video https://youtu.be/d_6DFoHWBC0 shows the difference between a good talent and a great talent. 

In China Alpine seemed hardest hit by the new rear wing directive and Doohan was P16 in SQ1. But he was ahead of Gasly which went a little under the radar but was very impressive. 
 
The sprint itself though, was a bad one for Jack. While Gasly worked his way up to P12, Doohan spent the  whole race battling with the Sauber's before making a silly lunge down the inside on tub last lap and crashing into Bortoleto, spinning him around. For this Doohan got a penalty that didn't change his P20. 

In the main qualifying session he was out in Q1 in P18. To be fair, he was only a tenth off Gasly. 

And for the first time we got to see his comparison to Gasly over a race distance and... it was fairly impressive. On lap 33 he was only a few seconds off Gasly. From then on he was battling with the late stoppers Bearman and Stroll as well as the two stoppers of the Racing Bulls. 

They had much fresher tyres but Doohan fought hard, though he picked up a penalty for forcing Hadjar off. He still held Hadjar off for the remainder of the race but the penalty dropped him a couple of places. But finishing ten seconds off of am experienced midfield driver like Gasly in his first race distance is actually pretty commendable and why I think he should be given a bit longer. 

Yes his crash today was big, and the main argument for replacikg him is that crashes like the ones he's having will cost the team valuable momey they could use for development in this era of the cost cap. 

But if Doohan stops crashing so much and just cuts out the small errors I think he deserves to stay because he does have that raw speed in him. He has outqualified Gasly in one out of three quails and gotten close in the other two. Gasly is one of the stronger qualifiers on the grid and it's no mean feat to be that close. 

Admittedly Australia and China are two of Gasly's worst tracks but if we get to Bahrain and the gap is still small then Doohan deserves the time. Also Doohan isnt that familiar with these tracks either. When we get to more of the circuits he drove in F3 and F2 let's see what he can do. 

In F1 what often seperates rookies is their raw pace. A driver like a young Max Verstappen who is fast but crahses a lot is actually much more impressive than a rookie driver like Sergey Sirotkin, who doenst really crash, but also doenst show any speed. 

I think the reason Jack is crashing is all the pressure Alpine have put him under to perform or get fired. He's pushing the car too much amd crashing due to that. If he continues to have an incident per race yes he should be home by the summer but I think he has shown enough raw pace to be kept on until at least the summer break and if he is very good at the tracks he's more familiar with he should be kept on for 2026. 

TLDR - He's shown enough raw pace to deserve to keep his seat.

But I think he'll get it out of his system: he's a rookie.\n\nThat said, Alpine and Briatore could literally do anything and nobody would be surprised. F1 is so knee-jerk that if Ryō Hirakawa came in this weekend for Doohan (if he'd suffered a concussion for instance) and had a great result, he'd suddenly be favourite to replace him."", 'Let rookies be rookies.', ""I know people want to like him because of his situation but he is not making it past Miami and he has been really bad. Crash in Australia, crash in SQ1 in China with penalty points and a bad race in China, he only held off Hadjar cause it was very difficult to overtake in that race and even then he only managed due to illegal defence. All the crashes were his fault including the one today. So yeah, it's not good. The only reason Gasly is not ahead by more is probably cause the Alpine is just not very good."", 'The difference is that Gasly has already proven he can be fast, get points and podiums. He even completed a full season without damages to the car.  \nOutqualifying your teammate in a race is not really much..', ""Bro he didn't manually disable drs when it was probably specifically in the notes for the race.

1jr5ixc,What if Max beats Yuki?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jr5ixc/what_if_max_beats_yuki/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"Edit. I mean what if Yuki beats Max. That's an embarrassing typo.

There's been a lot of talk about what is expected of Yuki as to how close he needs to get to Max, but how much would be upset if he beats him by a couple of tenths or destroys him by half a second or more? Liam's career would be over. Perez apologists would have to quieten down. Horner pressure dies down. Max loses negotiation power and ends up retiring. And so on, this is the little domino from the meme could end with something strange like Ferrari doing a great strategy or Alonso WDC in the Red Bull.

Edit: I have no preferences for either scenario, just think there are (somewhat unlikely) things that haven't been talked about and wondered what people's thought were. Personally always loved Ferrari and also have been team LH44 since he started. Not a Max fan but I respect the fact that he's one of the best.","['Okay buddy, time to go back to bed', 'You mean ""What if Yuki beats Max?""', ""What if we don't overreact after FP1?"", 'Bro, what did you smoke?', 'Jack, buddy, you should take it easy after that crash instead of posting on Reddit.\xa0', 'Huh', ""Mate this isn't wattapad"", ""Title error?\n\nAnyway, it's time to wake up"", 'OP we know this post is basically your wish if you ever got one.']",0,82,0.13,0,1036,1036,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
