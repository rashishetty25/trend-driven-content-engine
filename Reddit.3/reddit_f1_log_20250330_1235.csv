1jnachh,Robert Kubica’s 2010 Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jnachh/robert_kubicas_2010_season/,2025-03-30, Discussion,"Yesterday on the Daily Discussion thread somebody asked who was the best driver in 2010? 
I love looking at questions like that and so I got out a book I have that reviews the 2010 season and took a little look at it and the results and race reports and was myself fully expecting to go with Alonso or Hamilton. However Kubica stood out to me so much that I not only think this was his best season in F1 and that he was the best driver that year, but it is maybe the most underrated season from a driver of all time. I think it deserves to be appreaciated more and spread to newer fans. His 2008 was great too but probably a little overrated. This season is amazing.

It’s insane how consistently good he was. You have to remember that Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren were very far clear of everyone else. Mercedes were fourth fastest and Kubica was in a Renault. Yet he put in so many great performances. 

This is his season in full.

Bahrain - Qualifes P9 Behind the Red Bulls, Ferraris, McLarens and Mercedes. Then he’s taken out on lap 1 and drops to last but is one of the only drivers able to overtake in a fairly boring race and beats his team mate to finish P11. 

Australia - Has amazing race with no mistakes in the rain. He had a great first part of the race going from 9th to 3rd which became 2nd when Vettel went out. Then he held off Hamilton and the Ferraris for the ENTIRE race. 

Malaysia - qualified in 6th and finished 4th. Again in the 5th fastest car. 

China - Another great intelligent drive in mixed conditions gets him a very respectable P5 ahead of both Red Bulls.

Spain - qualifies best of the rest behind top 6 and finishes P8

Monaco - Puts in one of the greatest most underrated Quali laps of all time to qualify second. In a Renault. https://youtu.be/qbYMoKxif6I?si=py8cesIs3LvZqMJ_ 
Please watch it it's outstanding. On the limit, kissing walls, pure magic.  Then in the race he finishes third behind the faster Red Bulls. He outqualified and held off both Ferraris and both McLarens. 

Turkey - Qualifies P7 finishes P6

Canada -Qualifies P8 finishes P7. 

Europe - qualifies P6 finishes P5. On lap 1 he made an incredible double overtake on Webber and Button. 

Britain - qualifies P6 and is unlucky his driveshaft fails in the race while he’s running P4. He even got up to P3 at the start. 

For context after 10 races he is now on 83 points while his closest comparison his team mate is on 6. Kubica has about 14 Times the amount of points as his team mate. And while his team mate Vitaly Petrov isn’t great he’s not Mazepin or something. Like the following year he gets a podium and he had a respectable junior career. 

Germany - Starts best of the rest in P7. Finishes best of the rest in P7. He could not have done any more than he did. 

Hungary - Qualifes P8 but is team releases him into the path of another car in the pit lane and they crash. Not Kubica’s fault. Probably would have finished P5 or P6 without the incident.

Belgium - Qualified third! And finishes third! Was P2 for most the race until he made pretty much the only costly  mistake of his season and overshot his pit box. Finishing P3 in a race you made your first mistake of the season is not bad at all. This mistake isn’t even that bad compared to what the other drivers in contention to be best of the season did in this race and the next. Alonso crahsed out in Belgium and Hamilton likewise in Monza. 

Italy - Starts P9 finishes P8.

Singapore - Starts P8 finishes P7. 

Japan - Qualifes P3 ahead of both Ferraris and both McLarens! For comparison Petrov is P13. In fact after that lap Robert was white faced and could not speak. He could not belief what he'd just done. Then at the start Kubica gets into P2! But in his most unlucky moment of the year his wheel comes loose and he has to retire on lap 3. 

South Korea - Qualifes P8 and finishes P5 in treacherous conditions. 

Brazil - Qualifes P7 finishes P9. 

Abu Dhabi - Qualifes P11 but finishes P5! Makes a couple of great overtakes. 

I am not excluding races where he did poorly because there are none. Every single race is on that list and he had was impressive in every single one. 

An incredible season from Robert. He finished on 136 points while his team mate Petrov finished on 27. Single Handedly gets Renault P5 over Williams and Force India. Beats Michael Schumacher by over 60 points in a lesser car. 

He had three podiums in the third best car. He finished in then  top 7 in 12 out of 19!races. He finished in the top 6 where he had no right to be in 9 out of 19 races. He also would have probably finished P5 in all the races he didn’t finish. None of those retirements were his fault. Had he not had any of those unlucky DNF’s he would have finished within 100 points of the winner of the championship for goodness sake!  For context in 2024 nobody except Lando and Charles finished within 100 points of the championship. 

In fact this 2010 season from Kubica has to be one of the most underrated seasons from a driver of all time.

A think it deserves to be appreciated and I want to spread this to newer fans who only remember Kubica from that 2019 season for Williams.  

The next year at the start of 2011 pre season testing he was fastest in the Renault. Then a few days later in a tragic twist of fate he was severely injured in a rally accident that he spent the next 8 seasons recovering before his fairytale return with Williams in 2019. This was a disaster as the car was the worst in the field by a giant margin. Kubica also wasn't the same driver he was before and he was outpaced by rookie George Russell in nearly every race. In 2021 he also got a couple of substitute races when Kimi got Covid and he finished P14 and P15. 

He left F1 as one of its biggest what ifs and is now 40 racing well in endurance racing. 

I really hope some newer fans see this and find a new appreciation for Robert and his masterful 2010 season.

1jmx3fa,Hauger to Cadillac F1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jmx3fa/hauger_to_cadillac_f1/,2025-03-29, Discussion,"This post is only to start a conversation for fun about the topic of Dennis Hauger to F1. He had a really good formula series career, but I think he was incredibly unlucky with a lot of his Formula 2 racing which sadly put him a bit off the market. He’s now in Indy NXT and off to a great start with Andretti. 

If he does well in Indy NXT, could he potentially be a rookie for the new team of Cadillac F1 paired with another veteran driver? What do we think? ","['I think there are far better drivers who will be miles ahead of him in any conversation.', 'I love IndyCar but … you don’t go directly from NXT to F1. Palou probably isn’t going to get into F1 even if he wins 4 IndyCar titles in 5 years.', ""I think first choice Herta if he gets a super license, second choice Crawford if he gets a license. After that, I'm less sure that there's a plan, so it's more open. As someone pointed out, he's likely to replace Herta in Andretti if Herta gets his license, so that would be a really great thing for Hauger. IndyCar is an excellent career."", 'He should probably just focus on Indy now. He can have a good career over there. I think the F1 ship has sailed.', 'He is not going to end up down in NXT to then find himself at Cadillac next year lol.', 'Andretti has said they wire hire an American and a veteran. Hauger is neither.\xa0', ""He didn't really impress that much in Formula 2. He had a good run in Formula 3 and Formula 4, but he never finished higher than eighth in Formula 2. And while he absolutely dominated the St Petersburg round in Indycar NXT, it's also the only race that he's done. On top of that, the Dallara IL-15 chassis used by Indycar NXT is a decade old at this point, and is significantly less powerful than the F2 2018 and F2 2024 chassis Hauger was racing in Formula 2.\n\nIf Cadillac are looking to take on a rookie, then I imagine that they'll either go for an American or take Dino Beganovic as part of a deal with Ferrari."", 'Let me put it this way:\n\nDennis Hauger would make a fantastic reserve driver for Cadillac F1.
