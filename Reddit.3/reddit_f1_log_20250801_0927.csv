1me17kr,[AMuS] Mercedes removes new rear axle again,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1me17kr/amus_mercedes_removes_new_rear_axle_again/,2025-07-31, News,,"['Last year of the regulations and still looking for answers, big oof. They better hope the engine is good next year because they seem to have at best the 4th best aerodynamics/engineering team in the field. Even then the McLaren will have the same engine as them. If they dont start ahead i dont see them catching up seeing how these regulations went.', 'Translation:\n\n\n\n> **Mercedes is still searching for the reason for its recent poor performance. The front wing and rear axle are suspected.**\n\n> For six races, the Mercedes was a fixture in the field. Not as fast as the McLaren, but consistent. George Russell finished on the podium four times in the first six Grands Prix. After Imola, he only managed it once more. Russell\'s victory in Montreal, however, was not a turning point; it was merely a solitary highlight in many mediocre performances.\n\n> The Silver Arrows lost their consistency after the race in Imola. And a problem they thought was under control resurfaced. The tires tended to overheat again in certain conditions. This led to the suspicion that the technical package, which debuted at the seventh World Championship round, was partly to blame for the fluctuations in form. The front wing and the new rear axle quickly became suspects.\n\n> To get to the bottom of the disappointing race at Imola, Mercedes returned to the old rear suspension. Meanwhile, a second important element also changed. Starting with the Spanish GP, the front wing had to pass the FIA\'s more stringent stiffness tests. Its flexibility is an important tool in balancing the car for both slow and fast corners.\n\n> **Misleading victory.**\nIn Canada, the Mercedes were again equipped with the new rear axle. It was no longer under suspicion. The moment of glory in Montreal was a deceptive confirmation. Drivers and engineers were all the more astonished to discover in the three subsequent races that the car was difficult to balance. This had negative consequences for tire wear.\n\n> This happened on race tracks where they had won the previous year. This made it clear: The fault might lie in the rear suspension and the front wing. To finally get some clarity, Mercedes is switching back to the standard suspension for the Hungaroring. The front wing had already been modified at Spa to reduce air turbulence around the front tires and the airflow in the lower areas behind them.\n\n> The outlier in Montreal can be explained by the fact that all the corners there have a similar profile. They are slow chicanes. The drivers brake and then turn in. The car can be set up well for this. Spielberg, Silverstone, and Spa offer corners with different speeds and radii. What suits one type of corner can be a disadvantage for another. A front wing that flexes less controlled then becomes a problem.\n\n> **Anti-lift rear axles are trending.**\nMercedes is following the trend with its rear axle modification. Red Bull, McLaren, and recently Ferrari have also modified the anti-lift behavior at the rear. Mercedes Technical Director James Allison explains the background: ""With this generation of cars, you want to keep the rear axle low because the loss of downforce is very high when you drop out of that window. But too close to the road is just as bad as too far away. When the driver hits the brakes, the car usually lifts at the rear. You want to prevent that as much as possible.""\n\n> In the Mercedes case, however, instability arose in certain types of corners. The rear end became nervous when turning under braking. Thanks to his experience, George Russell coped better with the car\'s sudden unpredictability than his younger colleague Andrea Kimi Antonelli. But he couldn\'t perform magic either. The Englishman finished 5th, 10th, and 5th in the final stages. Far from the podium finishes.\n\n> **Retrofitting proves difficult.**\nShouldn\'t the other teams with similar suspensions also be in the same boat? Not necessarily, as Mercedes chief engineer Andrew Shovlin explains. ""Those who planned for this type of suspension from the outset have it easier. We retrofitted and had to live with what we had. The gearbox housing is a carryover from 2024. There aren\'t unlimited points on a housing like that where you can attach suspension elements.""\n\n> Mercedes is therefore living with a compromise. According to Shovlin, there are around ten parameters in a suspension that are crucial for handling. From anti-lift and pro-squat to camber and caster. These still have to be reconciled with the wishes of the aerodynamicists, who have a significant say in the shape, position, and angle of the wishbones. ""Anyone who develops this type of suspension from a blank sheet of paper makes fewer compromises,"" says Shovlin.\n\n> The old suspension is making a comeback at the start of the Budapest weekend. The return to the familiar rear suspension setup should make it easier for Mercedes engineers to filter out other suspected troublemakers. ""After the second free practice session, we should have a pretty good idea whether our theories are correct,"" Shovlin hopes.', 'This season is basically another 2023 where one team has done pretty well in developing their car but because all of their rivals have seriously failed to some extent they have a massive advantage. Ferrari have somehow completely lost all the strength they had in their car, Mercedes are still completely lost at sea with ground effect and Red Bull have now reached the inflection point of zero driveability and less performance. McLaren just have a very well rounded car that does most things fairly well and they’re absolutely unstoppable.', 'Does that mean the car is gonna scrape along the ground?', 'Every manufacturer is still searching for answers apart from McLaren.

Oscar didn’t mind the steering so he doesn’t want to lose the other benefits.', 'Probably the most insightful article I’ve read yet explaining in depth what the pros and cons of the different front suspension parts bring. I don’t blame the media and fans for wondering about it, but reporters could do a better job of framing their questions instead of simply asking if Oscar will take the newer front suspension part or not. \n\nBased on this article I don’t think Oscar will have any desire to change based on his current form. If his performance starts to drops off for multiple races and he falls behind Lando in the championship, then perhaps he would consider changing the front suspension part. Until then McLaren can just bring the front suspension part that each driver prefers for the race weekends.', 'This article has crossed the line into actual sports journalism! I’m happily shocked by it.\n\nF1 engineering is truly amazing and a lot of fans (myself included) often fall into the trap of oversimplifying changes made throughout the season as straight up performance upgrades. Surely it goes on car, car goes more vrooom right?\n\nI could still be way off the mark, but this article now has me understanding that the suspension “upgrade” isn’t an upgrade at all. It’s a different package option to cater for driver preference on feedback through the steering wheel, which can result in changes to tyre deg patterns (however minimal). Lando prefers one option, Oscar prefers the other. McLaren can run both without having to compromise other areas of car development that are actual performance upgrades. Will be interesting if that is sustainable to the end of the season & within cost caps.

1mek52g,Hungarian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mek52g/hungarian_grand_prix/,2025-08-01, News,"Weather forecast for the weekend. This event in 2006 saw Button get his first F1 race win. 


The Hungarian Grand Prix in 2006 marked the last occasion the event was held in wet conditions. The track was already wet at the beginning of the race, making it a historic first for a wet Hungarian Grand Prix. 
All competitors started on intermediate tires, except for Barrichello, who opted for full wets. 

Early on, polesitter Kimi Räikkönen quickly established his lead. Both Alonso and Schumacher delivered impressive climbs through the field. Schumacher advanced from 11th to 6th by the first corner, while Alonso moved up from 15th with a notably aggressive and hard-fought opening lap. Alonso then engaged in a straight fight with Schumacher for several laps before executing a pass on the outside of Turn 5, securing 3rd place. He further progressed to take the lead after the McLaren drivers, Pedro de la Rosa and Räikkönen, made their pit stops. 

Traditionally, Bridgestone wet-weather tires were dominant in non-dry conditions, but in this race, the Japanese compound appeared to be an exception. All drivers using Bridgestone tires, including those from Ferrari, struggled with significantly reduced pace compared to their rivals. Schumacher found himself battling Giancarlo Fisichella for 5th place, ultimately losing his front wing in a mid-corner incident while fending off snap-oversteer, resulting in a forced pit stop that put him a lap down. Soon after, Jenson Button showcased remarkable overtaking prowess, passing Massa, Fisichella, and Schumacher in under two laps. Räikkönen, facing difficulties on his second set of tires, crashed into the rear of Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso, launching the car and necessitating a safety car period. This incident allowed Alonso to pit, enabling Schumacher to regain the lead lap. 
Another beneficiary of the safety car was Jenson Button, who chose not to pit and climbed to 2nd position behind Alonso. Following the safety car restart, Button challenged Alonso, but eventually had to pit for fuel. Alonso maintained the lead, but a subsequent pit stop for dry tires proved disastrous as his right-rear wheel nut detached, causing him to lose control and crash. 

Button inherited the lead and held it unchallenged for the remainder of the race. Schumacher made his way up to 2nd by remaining on intermediate tires as other drivers made further stops.

1mej0nr,Team Speed Progress Analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mej0nr/team_speed_progress_analysis/,2025-08-01, Technical,"I did an analysis of the average speed for all teams compared to the fastest team (McLaren in all races except 1) in each race.

The dots represent the average speed delta (left axis) of the drivers compared to the fastest driver for each race, and the line represents the average speed of the team compared as a percentage the fastest team's speed (right axis).

It seems that most teams are still loosing ground to McLaren, with the exception of Sauber. Mercedes is hanging there without making much progress. Ferrari was the closest at the beginning of the season, but it's loosing ground as well.

You can clearly see the difference between the Red Bull drivers, so while the gap is increasing for the team, Max is clearly very close to the McLaren pace.","['I feel like if any other team has the performance of Ferrari in the last couple years, we would regard them as very successful.
