Personally I'd get rid of Kimi but I'd feel awful doing it. I just couldn't refuse a line up of arguably the two best drivers on the grid.

Max is a Goat tier driver and many in the paddock think he might have as much as two to three tenths on the whole grid. In this years Mercedes I think he could be right in the championship fight.

All that suggest that Kimi has a higher ceiling than George (which is very high) is his junior career, but here’s the kicker, George Russell has a better junior career, and against better competition.

In F1 I don't think you refuse a line up of potentially the two best drivers on the grid just to maintain good vibes and the power of friendship.

This is a competitive sport. If I got a chance to potentially have BOTH of the two best drivers on the grid (I’d put Leclerc > Russell tbf but it’s close) I would do it.

And if you get rid of George and get Max/Kimi you run a big risk of Max obliterating Kimi like he has with so many team mates, Kimi losing all confidence, and when Max retires (which he hints is sooner rather than later) you are left with no George. No Kimi. No Max.

And I feel like keeping George/Kimi and keeping Max is the emotions talking. It would be like 2002 Williams refusing 2002 Michael Schumacher to maintain harmony and good vibes. 

You may say Verstappen and Russell would cost each other points by crashing into each other but I think they would more than make up for the points they lose crashing into each other and simply put, I think a team will have a higher points tally with Max/George than they will with Max/Kimi or George/Kimi.

But what do you think?

Hey all,

So watching the start of the race, I was a bit confused when Carlos made his way to the pits for a pit lane start. I was under the impression that once the marshals assisted his car, he was immediately DSQ'd. It ended up being a non factor, but, I figured I'd post this here to help clear it up for people.

Looking back at the regulations for 2025, in 26.7 it states that a car is DSQ'd for receiving marshal assistance anywhere other than the pit lane. However, it also states that there is an exception for 26.7d where marshals are allowed to assist team personnel to remove the car from the grid. As such, 47.2 takes over and it became a pit lane start for Carlos.

Note that this is not entirely clear because 26.7d specifies after the race start, during the intermission between the start of the formation lap and start of the race is not specified.

**HOWEVER**

Where it becomes more confusing is 44.12 (44 covering race start procedure). 44.12c states that any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car.  44.12d states that they may attempt to restart it once back in the pits. Carlos shuts off his car right before the marshals begin pushing him. They then stop pushing and he restarts the car. Should he not be DSQ'd for restarting his car after receiving assistance? Does that rule change because the race has been aborted at that point?","['The FIA activated the fire in his car to DSQ him', ""My take was that the race didn't actually start at that point so it was fine for a pitlane start but good question, Not entirely sure what happened there."", ""It's all in the regulations you've posted.\n\n\n47.1:\n\n>If at any time **after the formation lap has commenced and prior to the start of the sprint session or race** a problem arises that could endanger the start, the Race Director may decide the start should be aborted, in such case the following procedures shall apply...\n\nThe race session has not officially started before the race start, including in the case of an Aborted Start.\n\n53.2:\n\n>Except for the circumstances described in Article 26.7d) or Article 57.3, any driver whose car stops in any area other than the Pit Lane during a sprint session or race and receives\nphysical assistance resulting in the car re-joining may be disqualified from that sprint session or race.\n\nThis only applies *during* a race session. As the race has not officially started in an Aborted Start, this doesn't apply."", 'I was thinking that as well, but the fact that he retired right after meant that it doenst really matter.\xa0', ""I don't think it was aborted start when the Marshall's touched the car and that's why they quickly stopped and went back trackside. I'm kinda talking out of my ass here, but I did find it weird how long it took for RC to abort the start when it was so clear it wasn't going to happen."", 'He didn’t start the race, so he simply didn’t participate.\nDNS', ""I believe it's because the race hadn't actually started, might be wrong."", 'I know you can be pushed onto the pit lane and start but you are right about the fact he wasn’t.

It’s less clear to me\xa0', ""I haven't rechecked the footage nor viewed Sainz camera (correct me if i'm wrong)\n\n>any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car. 44.12d states that they may attempt to restart it once back in the pits.\n\nThe issue here is the fact that the car was unable to move while shut off (the first time they tried to push him and didn't move), the marshalls got away to allow Sainz to restart the car, and when he did the issue was resolved.""]",98,42,0.78,98,894,894,-3,0,0.0,-3

Turnout was especially big at IMAX locations, where tickets sell for a premium.\n\nThe well-reviewed sports movie led the weekend box office derby in North America, giving Apple a much-needed win in theaters after several misfires, including “Argylle” and “Fly Me to the Moon.” Last year, Apple canceled the wide release of “Wolfs” at the relative last minute, debuting it instead on the Apple TV+ streaming service.\n\n“Apple finally has a big theatrical hit,” said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a leading newsletter on box office numbers. “A lot about this movie looks easy, like a surefire hit, but it’s not. Racecar films and sports dramas have a long and mixed track record.”\n\n“F1” collected an additional $88.4 million overseas, where it played in about 32,400 theaters. Warner Bros. distributed “F1” on behalf of Apple, which used Apple stores, Apple Music, the Apple Maps app and its annual developer conference to promote the film. The marketing campaign was aggressive even by Hollywood standards: Apple also used its Apple Pay system to notify iPhone users about “F1” and offer a $10 discount at Fandango for anyone buying two or more tickets.\n\nApple’s entertainment programming is overseen by Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg. “We’re thrilled by the global response to ‘F1’ and grateful to the audiences who’ve embraced the film with such enthusiasm,” Mr. Erlicht said in a statement. Mr. Van Amburg called the debut “outstanding” and gave shout-outs to the filmmaking team, which included Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time Formula 1 champion.\n\nThe catch: “F1” was expensive, costing nearly $250 million to make and at least another $125 million to market worldwide, analysts said. (Some estimates are even higher.) For Apple to make money, the movie will need to attract substantial crowds in the weeks ahead, when it will face formidable competition in the form of “Jurassic World: Rebirth” and “Superman.”\n\nDomestic ticket buyers gave “F1” an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls. The Rotten Tomatoes audience score stood at 97 percent positive on Sunday, boding well for word-of-mouth.\n\nApple declined to comment on its “F1” spending. Tax incentives and roughly $40 million in product-placement fees helped defray some costs.\n\nCar-racing movies, as Mr. Gross noted, have a mixed track record at the box office. “The Fast and the Furious,” for instance, took in $40 million over its first weekend in 2001, or about $73 million after adjusting for inflation, and started an 11-movie series. (It cost about that much to make.) But “Ford v Ferrari” was less successful in 2019, and the mid-budget “Gran Turismo” sputtered in 2023.\n\nWarner Bros. and Apple had positioned “F1” as a land borne “Top Gun: Maverick,” which thrilled audiences in 2022 and starred Tom Cruise. Both films were directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Ehren Kruger, who wrote the “F1” screenplay, was among the “Top Gun: Maverick” writers. Mr. Cruise helped promote “F1” despite having nothing to do it, turning up at the film’s London premiere and posing with Mr. Pitt in front of a Formula 1 car.”', 'About to see it in two hours', 'Taking my Dad to see it.

1lo4vqd,Esteban Ocon – The Hidden Midfield Maestro of 2025?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lo4vqd/esteban_ocon_the_hidden_midfield_maestro_of_2025/,2025-06-30, Statistics,"If you’ve been casually checking the race results this season, you might think Esteban Ocon’s performances have been a bit erratic. Haas hasn’t been grabbing headlines, and Ocon’s final race positions often put him mid-pack at best.

But if you dig into the numbers – like his +7 gain at the Austrian GP yesterday – a very different story begins to unfold.

Ocon’s race day consistency has actually been one of the most impressive in the midfield this year – it’s just masked by Haas’s weaker qualifying pace. Across all races so far in 2025, Ocon has gained an average of +3 positions per race, with a median gain of +5. That means more often than not, he’s making solid progress through the field regardless of where he starts.

He’s only lost positions in two races this season (Miami and Emilia Romagna), and in all others, he’s finished higher than he qualified. That kind of consistency shows real race craft – smart decisions, clean overtakes, and the ability to manage tyre and pace well during the race. It also suggests Haas might be making the most of race-day strategies, capitalising on clean air, undercuts or well-timed stops to help their drivers gain ground.

It suggests that qualifying is where Haas – and Ocon – are struggling most. But come Sunday, he’s one of the sharpest tools on the grid in terms of navigating through traffic and maximising opportunities.

He's not in the spotlight much, but maybe he should be. There’s something quietly impressive about drivers who maximise what they’ve got, and Ocon is quietly becoming one of the most dependable racers this season.

Would love to hear what others think – has he been under the radar, or are the midfield margins just too tight to stand out?","['absolutely wild way to orient a chart.', 'SO happy he left Alpine. He seems much happier', 'You can\'t really assess his ""race finish"" position in Emilia-Romagna, mostly because he didn\'t finish.\n\nOcon seems to be struggling in qualifying, but that\'s possibly due to three major factors:\n\n* Midfield is really tight, last week in Q1 there was only 0.312s between 3rd Lawson and 16th Stroll (first driver dropping out in Q1), with P17 Ocon (+0.347) and P18 Tsunoda (+0.352) also being really close. For comparison, 3rd Lawson was +0.345 slower than fastest Norris. Sure, on longer tracks gap seems to be relatively bigger, but even on ""longer"" track like Jeddah, between 5th Sainz and 16th Stroll, there also was only 0.4s gap.\n* Haas doesn\'t look like a good qualifying car in general. During *Steiner Era*, they often shone in qualifying, but later struggled with tyre wear in the race. That started to change with last year\'s car, focusing more on keeping tyres within operating temperature range. That cost them with qualifying performance, as it makes more difficult firing up the tyres. \n* Ocon struggles to keep up his quali pace compared to Bearman. Ollie often looks great in qualifying, especially with performances like Japan. This could be related to their driving styles, because...\n\nOcon looks like better tyre preserver of two Haas drivers. After the race, he was pretty convinced that they could\'ve gone for 1 stopper, but they would have to make 1st stint longer. Ollie seems to be struggling in that area a bit more, which is understandable, as he still is a relatively unexperienced driver, at least compared to a driver that\'s hanging around for like 9 years, having completed 150+ races.\n\nAnd one more thing - obviously, you\'re more likely to gain positions when you\'re starting P18 rather than when you\'re starting P7, but that\'s not changing one simple fact. He\'s sitting P9, ahead of faster cars in inexperienced hands (Hadjar), or experienced hands having even more inconsistent car (Alonso).

In the future, apparently, only under one condition: The team must reposition itself strategically. This is said to include the demand that team boss Christian Horner either be replaced or have his powers curtailed.\n\nMarko might yet win after all.\n\nMark Hughes wrote this a year+ ago that fundamentally the question posed to RBR\'s owners was: take short-term pain and lose Verstappen but keep Horner, or lose Horner, the fundamental architect of RBR as we know it. Verstappen could be gone from F1 in 5 years, or another generational talent comes along, whereas Horner could still be in F1 in 10 years, and without him RBR are truly...who? What? \n\nI think Wolff\'s slightly backed into a corner that okay Russell is doing absolutely sufficiently to be kept, but even the possibility of *not having Verstappen as a rival* is critical.\n\nI genuinely believe various rumours have been true in the past but changed with time, e.g. Jon Noble said a while ago the AM/Verstappen rumours *were* true, but they\'re just so down in the dumps that all of that cooled off. Similarly a month or two ago the story seemed to be that Verstappen was going to see how things looked mid 2026 and decide then - fine, sensible - but the Merc being ahead stories are *so* prevalent that he might as well get on with it. The engines are in the 3rd trimester at this point. \n\nVerstappen to Merc 2026 would be only halfway down the wild driver transfer stories, over the years.\n\nI liked the point someone made ages ago, like: if you subtract the Dutch/Verstappen, who here is a *Red Bull* fan per se?\n\n> Horner believes that Mercedes has long since reached an agreement with its drivers, but is holding back on an official announcement to lull Red Bull into uncertainty.

Russell confirms this: ""There have been inquiries from other teams, but I\'ve told everyone that Mercedes is my first choice.""\n\nI do personally think that the extent to which Horner has been happy to badmouth Russell in the last year or so, implies he\'s not expecting to phone him any time soon.\n\n> In principle, the world champion would like to stay with the brand that paved his way into Formula 1 \n\nInteresting line from the Dutch guy on The Race recently, that a) there was a sense going into 2025 that we\'d see if RBR could correct the slide from 2024, or rather that their fundamental level is now kind of 4th, and b) that Verstappen is worried that their slide is not merely speed, but operationally they\'re not what they were in 2023.', 'So Toto is effectively assisting in Horner’s removal or cutting down to size by publicly courting Max, meaning he and his camp can pressure Red Bull for better terms by having another drive available, including a new level of power for Horner within the team, or even his outright sacking.

To do so, Verstappen must be ranked lower than third in the drivers' standings by the end of July.*** That is not the case at the moment. But Russell is only nine championship points behind and the McLaren drivers are out of reach. This is stirring the imagination in the paddock. For weeks, there has been speculation about whether Verstappen might still end up at Mercedes.\n\nMax Verstappen is tired of hearing the Mercedes question. ‘I don't think we need to talk about that anymore. Shall I repeat what I said last year? It's the same answer. I'm concentrating on driving. Then at some point, the time will come to think about next year.’\n\nHe is just as unwilling to make a clear commitment to Red Bull as he is to confirm whether he is in talks with Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. Toto Wolff also has no desire to add fuel to the fire. ‘Everything is going according to plan. Contract negotiations are not held as public town hall meetings.’\n\n***According to Toto Wolff, negotiations with George Russell are still on schedule.***\n\n**Who would have to make way at Mercedes?**\n\nThe Austrian does not want to comment specifically on talks with Verstappen. Of course they are taking place. Wolff would be a poor team boss if he did not explore all options. But he also knows that he currently lacks the arguments to show George Russell the door.\n\nThe Englishman is driving in the form of his life. Verstappen and Russell in one team would be the best possible driver pairing and a strong counterweight to McLaren and Ferrari. But, as Alex Albon once put it, there would also be a great risk of fireworks.\n\nIf Russell had to leave, Mercedes could jeopardise Andrea Kimi Antonelli's career by signing Verstappen. ‘Everyone looks bad against Max.

They thought that McLaren should have called Oscar in immediately after the flatspot. There also seems to be a bit of confusion about the sequence of events, so I went on the onboards to have a look and listen. \n\nLando and Will begin discussing their pit options on Lap 19. At the beginning of Lap 20, Will signals to Lando that he will pit soon. In the middle of Lap 20, Lando gets explicit instructions to box. \n\nImmediately after that, Oscar tries the (at best, ambitious) maneuver that gets him his flatspot. The McLarens continue on for the rest of the half lap. While Lando approaches the pit entry, Oscar gets told that Lando will pit and to see how he does in free air. \n\nSome might say that Oscar could have been told to pit immediately after he got the flatspot. That doesn\'t make sense though. His situation wasn\'t a dire one that necessitated an immediate pit. Furthermore, the mechanics were already in place with Lando\'s tires. Pitting Oscar first would increase chances of a mix-up.\n\nNow, Oscar doesn\'t respond until he gets to the end of the lap. As Tom reiterates that he wants best pace until target lap, Oscar tells him about the flat spot. Tom tells him to see how he does in clear air. \n\nIn the second sector, Tom tells him that the flatspot doesn\'t seem bad on the data and tells Oscar to ""let him know."" In the third sector, Oscar says that it\'s not pleasant but okay. They then do not pit at the end of Lap 21. \n\nThis is supported by the data that shows Oscar go faster than the previous laps and also faster than Lando\'s inlap. \n\nI assume that if Oscar had said or performed otherwise, they would have pitted on Lap 23. Remember that McLaren was also not ready to double-stack since they were presumably already in front of the box with Lando\'s tires when Oscar made his move. Thus, Lap 23 would have been the earliest (safest) time for them to pit.\n\nOn Lap 22, Oscar gets asked the 4 with delta vs. 1.5 behind question.

I really wanted a close drs battle till the end but we never got it.\n\nI've already mentioned it in another thread yesterday, but backmarkers are frustrating me this season. Watch your mirrors! Listen to your race engineer! Why do they have to almost take the race leaders out?\n\nAlso can I just say that the Red Bull Ring is one of the best tracks we currently have for racing? There isn't just one overtaking opportunity. There are only a few real corners, but the track gives the option for battles to go on for multiple corners and makes the drivers have to actually think about where they overtake another car. I'm happy that it got renewed until 2041. And if we need to have sprints, can we please have it in Austria again next year? It's one of the best places for it."", ""something is seriously wrong with the Alpine car.

Andrea Stella has said in interviews that they have ""written our racing principles together with our drivers"", so it seems to me Lando and Oscar feel a strong sense of responsibility to be able to have such freedom to race and they take that responsibility seriously. I think Oscar and Lando know exactly how unique the situation they\'ve found themselves in with such freedom to race (without the need for the team to be too worried about other teams/drivers) and they don\'t take that lightly.', ""A weekend that is emblematic of Germany 2019, except that it happened to Red Bull.

That car had the pace to go to P3 during qualifying, but the fact that both Verstappen and Tsunoda are both reporting lack of grip, especially towards the front in car control, that has to account for something, right? Or is Horner adamant on shrugging it off lightly, like he did with Pérez and Verstappen last year? \n\nIn 2023, the minor problems that their car had were concealed by the ability of a talented driver in going all the way, alongside the other teams finding it difficult to catch up. The same can be said for 2024, except the writing was already on the wall. Alongside the alleged brain drain, 2025 is the hubris from everything that has happened, and now the rumours that Verstappen is considering a Mercedes move is garnering steam, and understandably so this time\n\nVerstappen cannot save their skins all the time. If Horner is really not interested in finding out the core problem behind their string of negativity for all these years, and try to give some thought towards the upcoming regulations, which I am hearing reports that it isn't going too well, then he would just have more of Austria 2025 to follow, and moreso.

These now look like 4 logical race series that make up the world championship. A European series, an American series, a Pacific Series, and a West Asian series.

1lnwr1r,McLaren tactically avoided a fight between Piastri and Norris,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lnwr1r/mclaren_tactically_avoided_a_fight_between/,2025-06-30, Discussion,"As the title suggests, I think McLaren very smartly avoided a fight between its two drivers.

If McLaren knew it was going to be a two-stopper, there was no need to give a delta on tyres. At all times, you’d expect both drivers to have tyres in good condition. In fact, staying within DRS range was more critical, as it could gain you about 0.7 seconds per lap.

They fitted the hard tyres — the most durable — and with McLaren being easy on tyres (even Hamilton noted they could last to the end), they likely knew that once a gap was built, there was no way Piastri could close it, especially since both drivers are similar in pace.

They told Piastri: “1.5s gap now, or 4s with the delta.” This is where Piastri may have made a mistake. He should have realized that staying close to Norris was more important than holding the delta.

Also, once Piastri had the delta, he might have considered avoiding the second stop. After his second stop, Norris was 17 seconds behind with 17 laps to go — yet Piastri and his engineer never even discussed staying out until the end.

Anyway, I hope Piastri becomes smart enough to take strategic calls into his own hands when needed.","[""Piastri was going to drop out of DRS even if he stopped a lap later. I would've liked to see him extend his second stint too, then fit the softs he only did that last Q3 prep lap on. Maybe that would've dropped him even further back though."", 'Tyre delta can be critical for making an overtake work. He had a go for the entire first stint on the same tyres and it didnt really work for him. There was a big risk either way that he would drop out of the DRS after the stop. Same tyre 1.5 Behind isnt really a promising option.\n\nThe idea of going for tyre delta definitly made sense. In hindsight, it probably cost too much time, which may also be related to the fact that he couldnt use clean air after Norris pitted to go faster. The DRS is extremely strong on this track, so whilst he got clean air he also lost that benefit and its not like he saved tyres for this either.\n\nMcLaren left the choice to Piastri and he made a reasonable decision at the time, seeing that doing something slightly different could be his best chance', 'Piastri did take strategic calls into his own hands. Just instead of the 4s gap the team said he will have, it was close to 7', ""The reason Piastri ended up behind Norris after the pitstops was his own decision.\n\nIf McLaren hadn't given him the choice then I'd agree with you but they did and if he'd decided to stay close and put more pressure on Lando it could ahve been very different"", ""Lol you should watch more races with fights between teammates. Try the Mercedes era.\n\n\nThere's an ideal lap to stop and they can't stop both at the same time, so they'll always give priority to the car in first. McLaren then gave the option to Oscar, Oscar was the one that knew how it was to drive close to Lando in similar tyres and made the choice to not do that again. It was Oscar that made the decision not the team.\n\n\nIt's funny, when a team makes a call it's bad because they should've listened to the driver, when they ask the driver it's bad because the team is the one that should know.\n\n\nBattles between teammates a lot of times can become boring because after the first pitstop it's over, since the car ahead will have priority and build a gap in the pits."", "">yet Piastri and his engineer never even discussed staying out until the end.\n\nI really don't think they'd try to maneuver strategy like that to aid a driver on P2 to overtake a teammate on P1. You have to do it on the track, if you want to win. \n\nI mean, it's just ridiculous to think McLaren would play convoluted schizophrenic games with itself, trying to get one car ahead via surprising and cunning one-stopper, and then not have the other car also match that. \n\nThe goal was to finish 1-2, and the drivers aren't the main focus there."", 'Yeah, McLaren played it smart to put some distance between the drivers.\n\n>Anyway, I hope Piastri becomes smart enough to take strategic calls into his own hands when needed.\n\nThis isn\'t really how it works in battles between team mates, they don\'t really get the chance to outsmart each other on strategy very often as it introduces risk and 1 driver accusing the team of getting the ""better"" strategy.', 'They were never going to split strategy like that, and they also nullified Piastri’s delta by pitting him one lap after Norris instead of the 4 he had gained in the second stint.', 'I must have missed a large percentage of the GP where they were racing each other within 1 second.\n\nPiastri was given options and he picked the option he wanted.', ""Yeah, but I wish they hadn't.

Antonelli, Lintblad and most recently Dunne. Effect of Max is pretty obvious on F1. But his start of the career wasnt that much different to other recent champions. Few years getting established and then win several titles. Senna, Schumacher, Alonso, Vettel all did it. Hamilton came 2nd in his 1st season and won the next one (but had to wait from more championships few years afterwards).

The real difference is the age. Max came in as 16yo. Unheard of. 

He opened the door to teenage drivers in F1. Every teenager will now be compared to him.

So my question is: What will be required from the future driver to be hailed the next ""Supertalent""? What will it take to change to question from ""Is he the next Verstappen?"" to ""Is he the next Robin Raikonnen?"" (replace Robin with whoever will be the next big thing)

Toto Showed he is willing to give the top seat to a rookie. This might open the door for the opportunities. In my opinion it would have to be a driver that comes very young, under 20 years old and starts challenging the top driver the 1st/2nd season. Like Max did to Hamilton once he was in Red Bull. And he will need to beat Vettels record of youngest champion. 

  
Is this just my recency bias? Before Max, was this being done to everybody? Was Max hailed as next Vettel/Alonso? Was Hamilton hailed next Schumacher? Schumacher next Senna? Senna next Lauda?","['There\'s always the ""exciting rookie"" in F1, although it\'s more rare to have hype for a ""future GOAT rookie"" prospect.\n\nI probably will miss a few names in the time I watched, but Schumacher was definitely propped as ""GOAT rookie"" in 1992, while his few races in 1991 left more of a ""exciting rookie"" vibe.\n\nVilleneuve was ""exciting"", but never really viewed as GOAT stuff, even when winning the title in his 2nd year.\n\nThe next hyped ""GOAT"" rookie was probably Raikkonen. Alonso wasn\'t really hyped up much until his return after his rookie year in Minardi. We all knew he is good, but couldn\'t really be sure how good due to that car.\n\nMontoya was an interesting case where he wasn\'t exactly a rookie when he joined, but had a much greater career expected for him.\n\nHamilton was obviously a GOAT rookie expectation from the start.\n\nVettel actually was viewed more in the ""exciting"" category initially, but his results in his first season tipped the scales to ""could he be a GOAT prospect?"".\n\nNext was Verstappen in 2015 with all the hype.\n\nBelieve it or not, but Van Doorne was as close to GOAT rookie expectation as one can get, considering what followed for him.\n\nThen it\'s Leclerc that came closest to GOAT rookie prospect, although at that time Verstappen had kinda changed the curve and everyone was compared to him, which maybe affected how Leclerc is viewed. This is true for the like of Russell as well.', ""I don't know. Verstappen arrived long after people stopped asking about the next Schumacher, which is what he is"", 'Raikkonen and Alonso were known to be young when they started F1 as well, being 21 and 19 respectively.

People were saying Verstappen is the next Senna. Is he? Or is he just Max Verstappen?', ""Many drivers (including several of this year's rookies) have been hailed as future superstars at various points. The truth is that not everyone can make it to the top, and it's what they do once they're on the grid that really matters.\n\nFor every Verstappen, Hamilton, Vettel or Raikkonen who come into F1 touted as future world champions and actually achieve it, there's a Vandoorne, Magnussen, Hulkenberg or a Kvyat who either fall by the wayside or never come close to fighting for race wins/championships. Some, like Robin Frijns or Antonio Felix da Costa, never even make the grid.\n\nAntonelli, Hadjar, Bortoleto and Bearman are a notably impressive group of rookies. Are there likely future WDC/race winners among them? Yes, but history and logic tells you that all four of them are highly unlikely to end up anywhere near the GOAT conversation by the time they retire.\n\nAs for the next GOAT contender who hasn't made it yet, Lindblad looks very promising, as does Slater, but there was a time not too long ago when the same thing was being said about Theo Pourchaire."", 'Lots of drivers get the ""potential next Verstappen/Schumacher/Hamilton"" tag, but it rarely sticks. It\'s a shorthand for ""Given the right circumstances, this guy could be the real deal"". But in the 30 years I\'ve been watching, there have been a few drivers that have left little doubt from their first races that they were future greats - Alonso, Hamilton, Max, Seb. I can\'t think of any others that arrived with the same sense of certainty.', 'Laughed out loud at the mention of Dunne.', ""I think Freddie Slater will be the next generational talent. \n\nNo doubt he will have his own career path though. It won't run parallel to Verstappen's. \n\nin terms of showing he's a generational talent... I guess getting up to speed quickly and blowing his teammates out the water. Verstappen was actually a bit different in this regard as he entered f1 so young he did a lot of his growing as a driver under the spotlight. Someone like Hamilton came in much further along in his development and almost won the championship in his rookie year. Alonso was an outsider for the championship in the 4th best car in just his second season.""]",0,85,0.15,0,71,71,0,1,-0.03,0

The reason Max is still in a Red Bull is commercial.', 'Why not have him drive the McLaren instead?', ""When building an F1 car, engineers must choose a balance between maximum performance and driveability. Most teams choose somewhat of a middle point, but Red Bull chooses performance and completely sacrifices driveability to make the car as fast as possible. The result is that, if engineered right and tuned right, the Red Bull can offer great pace but the driver has to be extremely precise and operate on a razor's edge. Outside of that extremely tight operating window, the car's performance falls off a cliff and the car can be unpredictable (aerodynamic stall, poor grip from floor not sealing for ground effects, loose rear end, etc.). Verstappen has that precision and adaptability to drive on the knife's edge (aka talent), but his teammates do not, hence the current scenario with the number two Red Bull driver. If a driver cannot drive on the knife's edge, the car's driveability needs to be increased. However, this cannot be done with an upgrade or with setup. It is a fundamental aspect of the car design that cannot be changed at this point.\n\nF1 Engineer Explains Red Bull's Difficult Car:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1hHV7uRCA"", 'He isn’t a midfield driver to drive an easier car.
