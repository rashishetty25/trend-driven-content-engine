I think it has to be what if Kubica didn’t injure himself and actually went to Ferrari in 2012? Could have Ferrari won the constructors in 2012 with an Alonso-Kubica lineup?

Not to mention that following his death, Colin Chapman took a long time to recover, and if anything Lotus underperformed for several years in terms of the innovation they were so good at in that era. \n\nIt's hard to imagine Jim being happy to race basically the same car for 5 seasons so I can't believe Lotus would have stuck with the 72 for as long as they did, despite how good it was - so had he lived in sure there would have been something better coming along in 72 or so and perhaps even something like the Lotus 78 would be ushering in the ground effect era a few years before Lotus eventually did it in 1977.\n\nOnce Jim died, drivers were just employees to Colin Chapman, whereas Clark was a major force within the team, pushing it forward always.

1muex4h,Let's dissect the horrendous 2016 Elimination Qualifying system,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1muex4h/lets_dissect_the_horrendous_2016_elimination/,2025-08-19, Discussion,"Possibly the biggest blunder in F1 qualifying has got to be this terrible attempt to make qualifying more exciting. I'm all for coming up with new ideas, but it only took one attempt for everyone to realise that the new system was garbage. We're fast approaching the 10th anniversary of this farce, so I decided to look back on this horrible HORRIBLE qualifying format.

For those of you who forgot, how it worked was that after the first five minutes of the session, a car would be eliminated after every ninety seconds, until only one car remains who would then receive pole position.

**What Formula One were expecting to come out of this:**

* They clearly wanted this format to work as a pass the parcel/ticking time bomb system where cars were constantly on the edge, trying to set new fastest lap times in order to avoid being the next car to be eliminated.
* They were hoping for massive OMG moments where Lewis Hamilton locked up into the first corner, and the clock is ticking down, he has to set a quicker lap time quick or else he's going to get eliminated in P17

**What actually happened:**

* There was no pass the parcel tension because the teams that started at the bottom, stayed at the bottom.
* Cars were perfectly fine to just stay in the garage because they were either contempt with their position on the grid, or because they knew they were going to get eliminated anyway.
* Pole position was decided long before the session actually ended, as there were no cars on track in the last few minutes.

**Why did this happen:**

* F1 cars especially during this time were only really designed for one glory lap, meaning that they were incapable of setting fastest lap after fastest lap.
* Once the cars were getting eliminated, there wasn't enough time for the other drivers in danger to get onto the track and set a fastest time, so what's the point in going out.
* Because the drivers in danger weren't going out, the drivers further up the timing grid weren't in any danger of getting eliminated, so there weren't any incentives for them to go out either.
* Because Mercedes were so strong, Ferrari knew they weren't going to beat them, so when qualifying reached the final four, what reason was there to send the drivers out. They weren't going to beat Mercedes, and nobody was going to overtake them for the second row, because they were all out.
* Likewise, once Mercedes were guaranteed for P1 and P2, they had no reason to hit the track either.

All these different factors meant that the qualifying was quickly scrapped, which is probably for the best, as this system had even more flaws that we never got to see with the system.

* Q1 and Q2 in Australia were rather chaotic, but over time, the engineers would've better understood the system, and they would've ended up just like the disastrous Q3.
* Even if Lewis Hamilton made a major error in Q2 which put him in P8 at the end of his run, because drivers were being eliminated every three minutes, there would be less cars on track that could possibly overtake him, which in turn would big qualifying upsets even less likely to happen.
* Because eliminations occur once the clock reaches zero, unless a driver in danger of being eliminated is super close to the finish line anyway, you're almost never going to have an instance of a qualifying session being decided by the end of it.

So qualifying was a disaster, but was it always destined to be? Was Formula One's vision of a ticking time bomb/pass the parcel system ever going to be good? I started to think about the possibilities:

* First of all, you would have to ban cars from sitting in the pits, which they would do if there was no danger of them being eliminated.
* Because of this, the cars will need to be fuelled up for full distance, and will need tyres that don't degrade anywhere near as much as the Pirelli rubber. Son now all the cars are on track at all times, but will this still be enough?
* The next problem that has to be tackled is actually getting the cars to push at all times. This system is supposed to be encouraging drivers to be setting fastest laps all the time, but Mercedes were so much better than everyone else in 2016. Why wouldn't they set one massive lap right at the beginning, and then just coast the next few laps whilst the rest of the slower cars get eliminated one by one.
* The only way to solve this is by having the drivers getting eliminated after every lap or so, and having the times getting reset after each elimination. Then the drivers will need to be constantly pushing at all times, right?
* All these changes are needed to get the ticking time bomb system F1 was pushing for to work, however because of this, the cars are essentially being fuelled up for a standard F1 race stint, so it's not unreasonable to presume that the cars that will be quickest through my proposals, are the ones that have the strongest race pace.
* This will result in the starting grid for the race being in the order of which cars have the fastest racing pace as oppose to one lap pace, which would then increase the likelihood of the main race itself being boring with little to no overtaking, due to the cars being fastest on race pace already being at the front of the grid.

So in conclusion, the elimination qualifying format was always doomed for failure, and there was about zero chance of it ever being better than the one it replaced. I understand that why people like the idea of the ticking time bomb that needs to be passed on, but it just doesn't work for F1.","[""Man, this was a disaster. A proper 'designed by committee' format that no one wanted. So glad they abandoned this mess pretty much immediately.\n\nNot quite as bad as the brief 2005 Quali format (where Quali on Saturday was followed by a second session on Sunday with aggregate timings deciding the grid), but not far off it."", ""Yeah absolute garbage, less safe and just wasn't good to watch, I think the current format is basically perfect but I would have them use every tyre compound, hards in Q1, mediums in Q2 and softs in Q3 so it keeps getting quicker"", 'I was in the crowd in Melbourne that day. I remember the boos as the drivers were all out of their cars with several minutes of qualifying still on the clock.

But I know there had been different opinions about it and from what I see people disliked it quite a lot I’d say. Because until Grosjean’s crash in 2020 f1’s halo explanation video had around 4x more dislikes than likes but after that crash the ratio changed the other way around it has a lot more likes than dislikes.

Also I saw a screenshot from Massa’s Facebook account kinda mocking the halo because when you look from the above it reminds you a flip-flop.

Finally, I can see that the narrative about halo changed overwhelmingly positive, people love it now. Which is extremely nice I’d say.

Anyways what do you people thought about halo, and if your opinion changed about it what was the reason ? It’d be nice to see what others thought about it. 

Thanks","['For me it was less about the aesthetic, but the worry about drivers being able to see out from through the Halo.

It was reinforced by Grosjean's fireball in Bahrain, and by Verstappen almost parking his car on Hamilton's head at Monza, then by Zhou's rollover at Silverstone too.\n\nOver time I've actually started to like how the halo looks on the cars as it's become a more integral part of the car's chassis."", 'It\'s pretty hard to watch Zhou\'s crash at Silverstone and think to yourself ""if he died it would have been worth it for my subjective preferences on car aesthetics"".

1mugeau,History of F1 Qualifying Formats - Which Was Your Favourite?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mugeau/history_of_f1_qualifying_formats_which_was_your/,2025-08-19, Discussion,"# Pre War - Drawing Lots

Yep, before the war F1 grids were often decided by drawing lots, absolute random chance!

# 1950 - 1996 - 2 x 1 Hour Sessions

This format was pretty simple and around for most of F1's history.

All cars had an hour on Friday and an hour on Saturday to set times as they wished. The fastest time a car managed in either session was used to decide the grid.

At it's worst it could all be decided on Friday if the weather turned for Saturday and there was no changes.

A lot of down time as teams waited for optimum conditions.

But usually guaranteed the fastest drivers would deservedly get their place on the grid and was a fair system of deciding the pace of drivers.

# 1977-1992 - Pre Qualifying

The top teams from the previous season (26 cars) ( or half season as pre quali elligibility was recalculated mid season)were exempt from pre qualifying and pre qualifying would only take place when the grid was over 30 cars.

1 hour session was held (usually) on Friday morning for the lower teams and the fastest 4 from this session would be allowed to enter full qualifying, the other cars were done for the weekend there and then.

Many teams used to go around and pretty much only compete for this 1 hour session then head home.

# 1996 - 2002 - One Hour Shootout

One hour on Saturday, 12 laps for each car (including in laps and outlaps).

Usually we saw each car do 4 runs with 1 hot lap in each run, sometimes 3 runs if the tyres needed some more warm up.

Fastest time from each car set the grid.

Led to some fantastic excitement in the last 15 minutes with cars fighting for optimal track conditions and often pole was set by the last man over the line.

Usually also led to the first half hour being almost exclusively used so the lower teams could get some TV time or nothing happening at all.

# 2003 - 2004 - Single Lap Quali 2 Sessions

On Friday cars would go out one at a time and complete a single fast lap, running order was reverse championship order, this would set the running order for Saturday.

Slowest car from Friday would go first for a single lap and then every subsequent car in reverse order from Friday's session.

For 04 this was changed to all be done on Saturday.

Concept was TV gets to see every corner of every lap and no one would be complaining about traffic or dirty air and no down time.

Downside was track conditions varied a lot and people realistically could be out of contention just by dumb luck. Starts raining just before your lap? Tough. Also drivers could purposefully go slow or spin on their first session to get better track position if it was advantageous to go early (weather coming in for example).

# 2005 6 Races - Aggregate Qualifying

For the first 6 races of 05 we were back to Single Lap Qualifying, but we had low fuel runs on Saturday added to a race start fuel lap (which varied because of refueling) on Sunday morning.

Absurdly complicated to follow and made qualifying lack drama and tension.

# 2005 13 Races - 1 Lap Race Fuel 1 Session

single lap qualifying for 1 session only, race fuel onboard the cars with starting order set by reverse finishing position of the previous race.

# 2006 - 2007 - Fuel Burn Elmination

This format saw the introduction of the now familiar 3 knockout sessions eliminating the slowest drivers after each session to leave us with the top 10 for Q3.

But in Q3 you had to start with your race fuel, but you topped it back up for the race. So we had the 'spectacle' of F1 cars trundling around trying to use as much fuel as physically possible to get down to a quali weight for a fast lap at the end. All while F1 was starting to try and have green credentials.

# 2008 - 2009 - Race Fuel Knockout

Same as the format before, but with no refueling before the race, so the fuel you ended Q3 with was your race fuel.

This eliminated the fuel burn phase and meant we got down to fast laps quicker, but meant cars were fastest in Q2 and not for pole position and grid position relied a lot on fuel strategy rather than outright pace.

# 2010 - Current - Knockout Quali

Our current system of 3 knockout sessions with low fuel and as many laps as you can do in the time limit.

# 2016 2 Races - Elimination Quali

Again, 3 sessions, but this time after an initial period of a few minutes (5-7 minutes depending on session) the driver with the slowest time would be eliminated every 90 seconds.

Designed to add tension but had the opposite effect as it was pointless to go out once initial laps had been set.

# 2023 2 Races - Mandatory Tyre Knockout Quali

For a 2 race experiement F1 mandated the use of Hard tyres in Q1, Mediums in Q2 and Softs in Q3, otherwise the same as the 2010 onwards system.

# 2023 Onwards - Sprint Quali

A condensed standard knockout qualifying session with shorter time limits and mandatory tyre usage for each session (usually Mediums Q1 and 2 and Softs Q3)

tldr - F1 largely left qualifying alone until the 2000s then have fucked about with it endlessly to get where we are today.

So what is your favourite Qualifying format? And did I miss any?","['I don’t mind the current knockout method but could you imagine the chaos that would be had if we brought back random draw?', 'I like the current format best. Everyone gets to qualify under the same circumstances so it is the fairest way to bring it down to the combination of driver and car.', 'Yeah current formats nails it in a lot of ways providing drama and stakes.  The problem with the older versions is the majority of them felt like FP for the majority of it.  It was only the final 5 minutes that mattered', ""I know I'm in the minority here, but I really liked single lap qualifying. It was cool to see the differences between each car and driver and I enjoyed seeing Minardi's get wrestled around for a full lap."", 'Sprint qualy was introduced in 2023 btw', ""The elimination could have worked. All it needed was for the current laps to count when the time hit zero. That's it. How hard is that for the FIA to grasp?"", 'Keep the first two sessions how they are and then a top ten shootout for q3 in reverse order of top ten in q2.', 'I have to confess that until I got into F1 properly I always thought the previous race result would determine the starting position for the upcoming GP. For example, race winner starts next race on pole and so on… I know, I was naive', 'I don\'t dislike the modern Q1/Q2/Q3 format, but i think it\'s the worst one for TV broadcasting.\xa0\n\n\nWith the older 1-lap format or the 60 minutes format, you could see almost all of the main drivers doing their pole laps in full (unless the director fell asleep, like with Senna in monaco 88). You could see small mistakes, huge corrections, ballsy moves etc...\n\n\nNowadays, every time the clocks reaches zero there are still multiple drivers completing their laps, and the director ALWAYS focuses on just one guy (usually the first one completing the lap, even if it\'s a mid-level car). If you\'re lucky, you may see HALF of a pole lap here and there, but most of the time you only see the last corner or the last sector.\n\n\nI know there are ways to see multiple laps at once (Multi-cam, picture-in-picture, dedicated onboard feeds etc...), but not every broadcaster/every country has those options, unfortunately. So, to me qualify is basically staring at the on-screen timing while some random car complete the lap.\xa0\n\n\nLet me repeat that Q1/Q2/Q3 is the best compromise between sport integrity and spectacle, and i welcome it. It\'s just that, on a broadcast level, i feel like i\'m just watching a fancy live timing, since the ""full pole lap"" is often only avaiable on replays.']",20,44,0.75,20,41,41,3,9,-0.030000000000000027,3
