But I think everything compensated, and even when I went to Le Mans, the second Le Mans, we were two minutes behind the leader one hour before the end and then they had a puncture, then they had a wheel that was not properly done, then they had a double pit stop ... then I won the second Le Mans.

While I agree Alonso has been unlucky not to win more championships, he was also fortunate to pick up the titles in 2005 and 2006. Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone never liked seeing one team dominate, and when Schumacher and Ferrari started winning almost every race in 2002, the FIA began looking for ways to rein them in. The qualifying format was switched to single-lap runs, which exposed Ferrari’s weakness with tire warm-up and limited Schumacher’s usual strategy of starting heavier on fuel. The points system was also revised to keep the championship battle closer for longer. Things got so extreme after 2002 that Mosley even floated ideas like adding ballast to the championship-winning car or reversing the starting grid.\n\nThe real turning point for Ferrari came with the one-tire rule in 2005. It was no secret that Bridgestones degraded faster than Michelins, and the regulation change effectively swung the advantage toward Micheli supplied teams. That allowed Renault and Alonso to capitalize, even though Ferrari still had a strong,if tricky car. Renault’s rapid engine development also paid off when V10s were banned in 2006. Had Ferrari been able to carry its early-2000s advantage forward, it’s an open question whether Alonso would have still won those two titles.', ""The starts those Renaults had back then were crazy.

Emil Frey Racing will field a Ferrari 296 GT3 for Max Verstappen's eagerly awaited GT3 debut in the ninth round of the Nürburgring Endurance Championship. The Formula 1 World Champion will team-up with Chris Lulham in the 4-hour-race on the legendary Nordschleife after obtaining his racing license two weeks ago. Max Verstappen already tested the Ferrari in May under the pseudonym Franz Hermann, and now he is making his official racing debut.

Emil Frey Racing will compete in the ninth round of the Nürburgring Endurance Championship (NLS) this coming weekend and is set to provide an absolute motorsport highlight: the traditional Swiss racing team will field a Ferrari 296 GT3 for the eagerly awaited GT3 racing debut of Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen.

The 27-year-old Dutchman successfully obtained his racing license for the legendary Nordschleife just two weeks ago and is now facing his first official challenge in a GT3 car. Together with Emil Frey regular driver Chris Lulham, who is also a protégé of the Verstappen.com Racing program, Max Verstappen will compete in the 4-hour endurance classic. Over 100 cars are registered for this traditional race, which promises another high-calibre field of competitors this year.

The Oracle Red Bull Racing driver had already attracted attention in May when he clocked up his first test kilometres in a Ferrari 296 GT3 on the Nordschleife under the pseudonym Franz Hermann. Since then, the motorsport world has been eagerly awaiting his official racing debut in GT3 – and now the time has finally come.


With Max Verstappen making his debut in the NLS, the “Green Hell” will once again live up to its reputation as the stage for legendary motorsport stories this weekend.

Max Verstappen (Netherlands)*
""It's my passion to take part in GT3 races like this too. I can hardly wait. I am enthusiastic about racing, even outside of Formula 1. Every lap on the Nordschleife is a very special experience. The atmosphere is also really good and there are lots of endurance racing fans there. It is my hobby to drive in categories other than Formula 1. My dream is to compete in the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring Nordschleife one day.""

Chris Lulham (Great Britain)
“Our debut in the NLS this weekend will be a great learning experience for all of us. The car felt fantastic here during testing, so I can't wait to get back on the Nordschleife. The weather will be changeable and probably won't make it easy, but I'm ready to take on the challenge together with Max and see what we can achieve!”
