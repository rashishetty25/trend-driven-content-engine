Never change', 'Max vs Lewis walked so Max vs Russell could run', 'Bro if this gets them hyped up enough to ditch the bullshit PR written answers every other driver gives in interviews, I’m all for it.', ""Full quotes in this article: https://racer.com/2024/12/05/russell-reveals-verstappen-threat-in-remarkable-attack/\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n> “He said, ‘I don’t know why you would want to screw me like this, I’m so disappointed in you. I was going to not even race you tomorrow, I was going to let you by, but now if I have to, __I will purposely go out of my way to put you on your f****** head in the wall__.’ So I don’t understand why he was so unnecessarily aggressive and violent in that regard.\n\n> “But we’ve got a guy who’s on the top of this sport who feels he’s above the law, and I don’t think that’s right.\n\n> “I admire his on-track battles, and when he’s hard and aggressive. But what we saw in the end of the season in ’21 or what we saw in Mexico with Lando, they weren’t hard, aggressive maneuvers. **They were ‘do or die. I’m willing to take this guy out’**. Which I don’t think is the way we should go racing.\n\n> “I honestly just want to set the record straight, to be honest. Because it’s just a total double standard that he has for the regulations, and just **thinking that he is above everybody else**.\n\n> “So it’s not me trying to assert my leadership style or anything. It’s just somebody has come out and said that I’m a two-faced motherf****r, and he’s entitled to his own opinions. But coming out and saying that publicly, and slamming me publicly, I’m just not going to accept it, and __I’m going to tell people what the reality was__.\n\n> “He pushes himself to the absolute limit week in, week out, and in 95 percent of the scenarios, that is incredible to see, and **I respect him for that 95 percent**. But there have been incidents that have gone unpunished. Maybe that is why he thinks he can get away with murder. But that is not the world we live in, and actions have consequences.”\n\n> “It can’t just keep going on like that. For me, it’s interesting, this whole regard with him and his own team,” he said. “They’re doing their utmost to get [Christian] Horner out of Red Bull, but at the very first race that he wasn’t competitive, he was absolutely slamming his team, and I know for a fact the week after, a **quarter of his engineering team were sending their CVs to Mercedes, to McLaren, to Aston**.\n\n> “So **I don’t respect somebody who doesn’t appreciate those who have given him the chance to perform**, because these last 12 races, he has had a car that is of normal competitiveness, and he’s been in the fight the same way as myself, Lewis (Hamilton), Charles (Leclerc), Carlos (Sainz), Lando and (Oscar) Piastri have been. And that’s how it should be.\n\n> “I feel like we all need to lead by example here. He’s the biggest, most successful guy in the sport for the last couple of years. He can do what he wants in his own business, but when he starts throwing comments around like he did on Sunday night about me, I’m not just going to sit there and accept it.”\n\nEdit: this part was missing in my quote above:\n\n> I just don't know why other drivers have when they've been in this battle with him, just sort of made it so easy and just let it be.\n\n> Lewis is a world champion who I aspire to be like, and I think he is a gold standard of a role model that younger kids should be looking up to. And the way Lewis dealt with that championship fight, he was hard, he was aggressive, he was always respectful, and he never went beyond the line.\n\n> You can go beyond the line in making a slight misjudgement, **but going out of your way to say you will purposefully crash into somebody and put them on their head is beyond the line**.\n\n> “People have been bullied by Max for years now, and you can’t question his driving abilities. **But he cannot deal with adversity**. Whenever anything has gone against him — Jeddah ’21, Brazil ’21 — he lashes out. Budapest this year, the very first race the car wasn’t dominant, crashing into Lewis [Hamilton], slamming his team…\n\n> “For me, those comments on Saturday night and Sunday were totally disrespectful and unnecessary. Because what happens on track, we fight hard, that’s part of racing. **What happens in the stewards’ room, you fight hard, but it’s never personal**. But he’s taken it too far now.”"", 'I love the chaos.

MARCA wanted to know if Fernando agrees that he uses this two-faced attitude, since he had a run-in in Australia and was sanctioned for the Mercedes driver\'s statement.\n\n“No, I don’t think so. I think George is a great driver, a great person and I’m good friends with George as well, I don’t think he’s just showing different faces here and there. I think it’s more about what I think Max probably agrees with me in that I said many times that some of the penalties are a bit not consistent, like if you have that episode in Qatar and then you go to the next event and you replicate exactly the same episode, you can induce that episode by driving, then you don’t get the same result in terms of penalties, so that’s the frustration that we sometimes have,” he says about penalties that are applied once and then they don’t come back again.\n\n""They\'ve recently changed the race director and also some of the people in the stewards\' room, so I hope all those changes are for the better and to improve this consistency that we\'re asking for . We have to give them a bit of time as well and hopefully, yes, here and next year we\'ll have a more consistent and better result,"" he added about the episode.\n\nStaying motivated throughout 2024\n\n“It wasn’t difficult to stay motivated because every two weeks you have the opportunity to do a little bit better than the weekend before. This calendar doesn’t allow you to rest or have time to think. You are racing continuously so, yes, it wasn’t easy, it wasn’t difficult to get motivation, but, yes, in a way I am used to not having the best car, so I think I once had the best Toyota car in the WEC in 25 years of racing, so I am always motivated.”\n\nMelbourne, the 25th anniversary of the first race with Minardi\n\n“I don’t really care, you know, it’s not a big deal, I’m just enjoying this part of my career and I still feel fast and motivated and I’m enjoying with the team, the progress, the good things, but also the bad things, where we try to learn from them. We’ll soon start working with great people that I admire, like Adrian Newey, Enrico (Cardile) will join the team also soon, like Andy Cowell recently. They’re people that I competed against and now I have the possibility to work alongside them and learn from them and, you know, I think it’s a good moment of my life and my career, so I’m enjoying every day.\n\nGround Effect Cars \n\n“I don’t know, obviously these ground effect cars are a bit different. I think this year we also showed everyone that it’s difficult to improve the car, because the cars have become very sensitive to changes and very critical in some areas where even improvements are no longer a guarantee that they will make the car faster. Running so low and so close to the ground and some of the kerbs are also a bit difficult for the car, we can lose even parts of the car when we go over the kerbs, so this kind of fragile aspect of the cars is not very good in terms of having fun driving or attacking in qualifying laps or in the race. But yeah, I think it was no different than last year or 2022 when we introduced this ground effect, so this year was just another one of these.”\n\nHappy to be done or would you rather continue?\n\n“No, I’m happy it’s over, I think it’s a very long season for everyone, for the mechanics, for everyone in the team, 24 races is ultra demanding, especially the last triple we did. I think for Max it ended when he won in Las Vegas and for us probably after the summer. We were already fifth in the championship, with no threats from behind and the remaining seven or eight races have been a bit long. We try to learn about the car for next year’s project but apart from that there’s not much to do, so yeah, I’m happy to take the winter break now and start from scratch next year and hopefully be more competitive. The motivation is different when you finish Abu Dhabi and start next year’s car and next year’s simulator work and everything than just coming in, knowing that we’ll be ninth to twelfth here and maybe we can correct the starting positions on Sunday. And we’ll only get one or two wrong, so this is what we’re missing in terms of emotions on Formula 1 weekends.”\n\nHis best performances in 2024\n\n""The best performance was Monza for the race and China for qualifying.""\n\nWhat is this track like for the AMR24?\n\n""It will be the same, I don\'t think it will be a good track, so, yes, fighting for Q3 if possible and fighting for points on Sunday, that will be the goal, but nothing really exciting.\n\nHe does not appear in the top-10 in the F1 Power Ranking\n\n""Yeah, I see it in the media sometimes, you know, but it\'s pointless. When I see that I\'m not on the list, I think, I don\'t know what position I am in, I just see the top 10 and then I\'m not there and I\'m ninth in the Drivers\' Championship with the seventh or eighth fastest car...

He wasn't a different driver in 2014 compared to 2013. He was the same 4-time WDC driver, with the same talent. The only thing that changed, **was the car.** \n\nWas it a bad car? **NO.** Could a driver perform with it? **Yes**, look how Daniel beat him in his 'debut' season with RBR. \n\nAnd yet, Vettel **struggled** with the car, regardless of the Renault engine's disappointment. \n\nVettel didn't lose his speed and talent overnight. The car simply did **not** suit him. \n\nSure, to adapt to that new style of 2014 which didn't suit his driving style 'much' didn't help and i'm sure that also had an effect on confidence which really impacts things like a domino effect.\n\nHamilton, after 2021, **especially** losing out the WDC the way it went, has had an impact. It would be no different to anyone, from Vettel, Alonso, Verstappen, etc. But it's not unlike Vettel post-2013. Vettel @ Ferrari revitalized and showed he still had it. **He may not have managed another WDC with Ferrari, and maybe Hamilton won't either.**\n\nLet's see what happens with Max in 2026. He's on a high now, but the whole car change **and** if RBR could go a bad direction in 2016, might be a Vettel and a Hamilton repeat all over again, Perhaps Max will have 5 titles by then though, but it's **very** possible that this happens. \n\nAnybody claiming Max would have 'lost it' after 2025, and say 'it was just the car' is **bonkers** and **ignorant.**\n\nJust like with Vettel 2014, RBR didn't build the car the way they built it around Seb and built a (fast) car with a disappointing engine that could not follow the rules that made the Vettel era with RBR so succesful and had to 'compromise' building a car that's good enough for **both**, which just happened to fit Ricciardo better than Seb.\n\n2022 onwards, not only did Mercedes make a dog of a car that had huge porpoising problems, they built a car that doesn't suit Hamilton and suits George more. Then, Hamilton announced his departure, and Mercedes bailed on anything Hamilton and went with George instead.\n\nThere's a **real good chance** that you'll see Hamilton perform outstanding again in 2025 with Ferrari from the get go. **Vettel beat Raikkonen in his debut year @ Ferrari and finished P3, with a 128 points lead on Kimi.** \n\nVettel's 2014 results had nobody expecting or believing that, and Kimi ain't no slouch. \n\nThere's literally **no reason** to think Hamilton couldn't do exactly the same trick. \n\nAnd final note: maybe, just maybe, the current format really doesn't suit Hamilton. So in his debut year with Ferrari, maybe it won't come to fruits as they hope. But maybe, just maybe, the 2026 rules actually suits Hamilton perfectly and he's gonna dominate again.\n\n**time will tell**"", 'Unless you are under the impression that Mercedes is “sabotaging” Lewis’s car, which wouldn’t make sense given his performances on Sunday…\n\nI think it’s probably his driving style not matching the W15.

Verstappen scored the highest for the weekend with a 9.2. Norris was not in the top 10, meaning that at best he scored a tenth under Bottas, which would give him a 6.9. Funny enough they post the below Leaderboard

[Official leaderboard after Race 23](https://preview.redd.it/68ribibhyy4e1.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aeefe9d0dc72a20343d9299f6db275dc690257d)



So, Verstappen is equal with Norris with no change in position. Should Verstappen not have either been 2nd (so change is +1) or if he was equal with Norris, should Norris not fall to 2nd?

Even if we look at the best possible Qatar-score for Norris (6.9) that is a difference with Verstappen his score of 2.3. Divide that by 23 races and you get exactly 0.1.

Leaving the safety issue of refueling aside, which other series have addressed, refueling adds the variable of fuel distance to the equation. 

Adding a second mandatory pit stop for tires would, for some races, could bring some different tire strategies into play. For example instead of a one pit strategy of Med to Hard, a two pit strategy of Soft, Soft, Hard. 

What other options would introduce more variables into race strategies and potentially reduce the likelihood of some races just being a procession?

Edit:  Some tracks make it very difficult to pass and sometimes only with DRS. With the high reliability of cars, there usually isn’t high attrition except for accidents. That means strategy is the thing that can make the difference. ","['Why the need of artificial ways of creating more drama? We could even add sprinklers as Bernie suggested.', 'Hm.
