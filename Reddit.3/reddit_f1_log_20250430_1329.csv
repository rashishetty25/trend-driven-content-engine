1kanq3g,Ferrari Won't Give Up SF-25: Big Package to Come After Spanish TD,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kanq3g/ferrari_wont_give_up_sf25_big_package_to_come/,2025-04-29, News,,"['Fred will still be talking about the SF-25’s potential in Abu Dhabi', 'Smart of them to wait until after the TD. On the off chance that the TD actually hammers any or all of McLaren, Red Bull and Mercedes, this could set Ferrari up well to chase them down in the constructors.', ""Guess they're just waiting to see if the TD hampers McLaren in any way.\n\nThat car can definitely be faster than the RBR and Merc in a fair few tracks, it's just the McLaren that is a level ahead but if they get slowed down, this can be a free for all."", 'Prepare for the car to get worse after the upgrades', 'Translation \n\nThe final developments of the so-called Venturi cars are in the pipeline. All teams will be able to afford just one large design revision package compared to the two steps of previous years . Corrections are also limited, it is no coincidence that McLaren has ""their finger on the trigger"" but in fact continues with the policy of caution. The technical directive on the flexibility of the wings introduced late (at least according to some) also has its weight. All the front wings will have to be rebuilt with new specifications , which has its economic impact. At the beginning of the year Frederic Vasseur has already announced that Ferrari the introduction of the TD will not move the plans, he has simply set the date in which the new front wing that was already in the pipeline will be introduced on the SF-25. Normally the factories must make at least 6/8 examples available per team, with the appropriate load variants and reserves also to deal with the frequent back to back. We can quantify the cost at around 1 million dollars . The average development budget for current cars is approximately $18 million, which would mean a good 10% of the budget that Red Bull says “will have been wasted due to the TD flex delay” . However, being the final year with this philosophy there is a double concept to dedicate tools and resources to. This easily means a worse impact in terms of percentage, probably close to double.\n\n\nWhat happens if the values change in Spain?\n\n\nLess flexibility of the wings limits the aerodynamic balance of the cars , probably also the window of use will shift because the bends will become more decisive to tame than the slow sections. The cars could suffer more understeer in the medium-slow to keep the wing down in the fast sections.\n\n\nIn the first five races Verstappen minimized the damage , remaining relatively in the slipstream of the McLarens , in Jeddah the penalty gave the victory to the icy Piastri. From their point of view the stewards applied the regulation, questionable but not a scandal. It must also be said that the escape routes allow a certain type of attitude, probably Piastri could have pushed Verstappen and he did, after all the Dutchman had already done it in the past. Note Antonelli who blocked the front and then gave the position back to a Leclerc who had granted him more space than Piastri.\n\n\nRed Bull is pushing with a package of innovations ready for Imola. It should be worth 2 theoretical tenths but nobody trusts the correlation. Engineer Lambiase, between Bahrain and Arabia, as a trusted man of Verstappen has unusually returned to Milton Keynes to personally contribute to some technical discussions, seems to be revealing a profile very similar to Ross Brawn.\n\n\nFerrari has small adjustments. A giant package will be deployed later perhaps in more events, but a revised rear-end may come after the introduction of the TD in Spain . The technical heads want to show that the SF-25 project has not failed and that things can change . The SF-25 can do more , Leclerc can now use the car much better, more speed in fresh air to avoid degradation requires better qualifying. Jeddah showed that turbulence has returned to 2021 levels, now the chasing cars need 1”sec of better pace to overtake. The large diffusers extract the most air but are no more responsible than they were three years ago. The attempt by the engineers to get more downforce without being able to lower the car has quietly pushed the work around the bodywork and the edges of these floors which now generate more harmful interactions for the chaser.\n\n\nThe side comparison images of the best cars are perhaps the most interesting example to at least understand what is meant by clean flows and the search for efficiency in the load. All the teams had come to the conclusion that the downwash design left more ways, however the stability of the load was the most complex part to find. The aerodynamicists work in the tunnel but the correlation is problematic because the vortices under the floor are unstable at high speeds. If the car waves, those around the skirt will also be unstable, sending the technicians into crisis. An antidote has not been found, the search for more load moves the reference points every time. No observer can fully know the reasons for a design, however the visible differences are clear. The W16 has the cleanest horizontal line, while maintaining the very large and steep edge slots. The low line is well connected with a basically flat design of the front wing, not by chance it seems to be the car with a low drag coefficient. McLaren and RBR seem to be the most harmonious, however the MCL39 has reached the best compromise for a year, limiting the use of cuts in the areas of greatest flexion of the floor, which take away a certain rigidity from the floor. Unlike Ferrari and Redbull, the surface of the large external bulkhead behind the front wheel is less than the maximum allowed, a sign that the ultra aggressive design of the front suspension can actually contain the disturbance compared to the competition. Mercedes may have also optimized that area well, at least in numbers. Ferrari has maintained a layout not so far from the old car, at least in this area. You can see a less gradual and more sudden drop in the flows under the sidepods. This could be one of the reasons that creates problems when the SF-25 travels in dirty air, however there is a compensation that comes from greater efficiency in the upper part of the bodywork. In short: rigidity and efficiency are always definitely the watchwords of this regulatory cycle.\n\n\nFerrari: Leclerc on top, Hamilton in crisis, Lewis is not escaping reality\n\n\nIt is no secret that the multiple English champion has not been able to digest the \'ground effect\' cars. He has had some very problematic Mercedes not to mention the initial failure of the W13, now a Ferrari that is profoundly different from his routines , with which he has driven since the end of January. All this is not enough to explain his poor form, other drivers have also changed teams, moreover in the TPC tests with the SF-23 he seemed to have done sufficiently well.\n\n\nThe driving style says something but not everything, both want the front end firm for corner entry but Leclerc adapts much better from the center of the curve . The Englishman needs to ""feel the load"" that pushes the car down, which requires very high sensitivity, he is formidable in the acceleration phase because it allows strong management of the tire in traction. Unfortunately on these cars it is not possible to generate a mechanical excursion that totally meets his old preferences. Leclerc as well as Verstappen has the greatest instinctive ability of the grid even when the rear is not planted.', 'I might be dumb but what does TD stand for?', '""team does EXACTLY what was planned before the season started when it comes to upgrades for the car""\n\nFixed the headline.', ""I'm here for whatever happens, but please don't put us through another Canada-Silverstone run.

Playing for Burnley FC isn’t quite the same as playing for PSG, much like Mazda Cup isn’t quite like F1.']",0,33,0.44,0,32,32,0,2,0.010000000000000009,0
1kbbci6,Should crashing in qualifying result in an automatic DSQ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kbbci6/should_crashing_in_qualifying_result_in_an/,2025-04-30, Discussion,"I’ve been thinking about how one crash in qualifying — intentional or not — can totally ruin another driver’s lap, especially on tight tracks like Monaco. It's such a narrow circuit that a red flag at the wrong time can wipe out chances for pole, and sometimes it feels like there's no real consequence for the driver who caused it.

What if there was a rule that said: if you cause a red flag in quali, you're automatically disqualified from the session? Or at least your best lap is deleted? It would definitely make drivers more careful and stop any “accidental” red flag tactics. I get that sometimes it's just an honest mistake, but the impact it has on the whole grid can be massive.

Would love to hear how others feel about this — would it be too harsh, or is it a fair way to keep things clean?","[""It's almost always (like 99.99% of the time) a genuine mistake."", 'Not disqualification but laptime deletion. So relegated to 20th, 15th, or 10th depending on the session they are in.', 'No', 'No, qualifying is about being on the limit. If qualifying is about being safe - meh. Like Verstappen in Saudi in 2021. If he did not bin it in the last corner he would have been P1. With your rule his previous best last should have been deleted so he would start at P10. So he would rather do a safe lap and start P3or P4 then pushing the car to its limit.', 'Dsq is maybe a bit harsh but I think deleting fastest lap time(s) from the current session is fair.\n\nSo if you crash in q3 you start p10 instead of p20.', ""Absolutely not. It's fine how it is"", ""your fastest time being deleted doesn't sound like an AWFUL idea, but at the same time the fun part of quali, especially in street tracks, is to watch the drivers go to the absolute limits, if you have a punishment for crashing you risk significantly worsening quali"", 'DSQ would be too harsh, unless it is explicitly proven that it was done on purpose, but it is very hard to prove. Also in the cost cap era, not a lot can afford to crash.\n\nI think we should allow people do mistakes.', ""Just go out at the start of qualifying rather than sitting in the garage until the last moment then you won't get caught out""]",0,63,0.13,0,58,58,0,3,-0.010000000000000009,0
