I\'m not gonna pretend I didn\'t go overboard from time to time with my ""anti-Yuki-to-Red-Bull"" crusade when Tsunoda fans also went overboard regarding him being good enough to go there, however I do believe that I also raised a couple of valid arguments to communicate why I don\'t think he was worthy of the seat. And I literally did not get a solid counterargument, ever. Maybe I got some half-assed answer, but nothing substantial, nothing factual.\n\nMy point is that Tsunoda is just another case of being so likeable that people start to rate him MUCH higher than reality, simply because they want to see such a likeable person succeed, not because he\'s actually that good. We\'ve had many such instances. And what you\'re describing is just these people coping with the thought that they weren\'t right. This, along with previous claims, fit perfectly on the stages of grief scale. First they denied Tsunoda wasn\'t good enough, then they cursed Red Bull for not promoting him, now they\'re making shit up to make it look like they weren\'t wrong, there\'s just something sinister in the background, some kind of conspiracy. Denial, anger, bargaining... Next up on the list is depression. I wonder how that\'s gonna look like.\n\nTL;DR: it\'s called **BIAS**!', ""I've been seeing that *everywhere*  since Liam's promotion was announced."", ""Tsunoda won't overshadow Max. People claiming he will clearly haven't seen Max or Yuki drive.\n\nHowever, I do think Tsunoda would've been the better choice for that second Red Bull seat in 2025. Here's why: \n\nI think Lawson has more potential than Tsunoda, however, Lawson is also still a rookie. He drove five races in 2023, he drove six this year. The guy clearly is still a rookie, and as such will likely make some rookie mistakes and needs some maturing to do. I think making those mistakes and maturing in the safe environment of a midfield team is better for him than making those mistakes in the pressure cooker that is Red Bull Racing He needs to be able to focus on himself and his own development, and constantly being compared to Verstappen won't do him any good in that respect. \n\nThis is where Tsunoda comes in. It is often claimed Red Bull don't want to promote him because he is tied to Honda and will likely move away from the Red Bull fold after 2025. I think that makes him the perfect driver for Red Bull Racing at this point. If he gets destroyed by Verstappen like Perez, Albon and Gasly before him, fine, he's out at the end of the season anyway. If he does do a good job, they can offer him a new deal. It's not like Tsunoda would choose to be a reserve at Aston-Honda (or a race seat in a midfield team) over a race seat with Red Bull Racing if offered the chance. \n\nSo long story short: Promoting Tsunoda now seems to be like the better long-term move for Lawson.""]",1,11,0.56,1,10,10,1,3,0.06000000000000005,1
