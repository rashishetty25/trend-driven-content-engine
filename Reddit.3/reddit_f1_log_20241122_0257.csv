The critical value for the screws that fix the floor panel to the car is one millimeter.

1gwb2mp,[The Race] What’s Changed For Norris After Brutal F1 Title Bid Collapse,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gwb2mp/the_race_whats_changed_for_norris_after_brutal_f1/,2024-11-21, News,,"['I wonder if he’ll start performing better now that the pressure is off', '‘Brutal’ goddamn clickbait in every title?', ""Am I the only one who thinks Norris's title chances were never really that real to begin with?\n\nVerstappen won seven races at the start of the year. The only reason Norris was ever in with a small sniff at all was because Red Bull seemed to just fade away mid-season. But even then, they still had a massive points advantage and Verstappen in their car, so it was clear he was still favourite to win the title.\n\nNow he's gonna lose it, suddenly the media are portraying this as some massive failure by Norris and McLaren when, really, it's crazy he ever got as close as he did to begin with"", 'Focus on 2025 Lando.', 'From the article…”I wouldn’t change anything”. Also from the article “I need to make tweaks”. Clear as mud.', 'Hasn’t he only gained 5 or so points on Max in like 7 races all whilst having the fastest car?\n\nI don’t think he was ever really in the hunt, mathematically maybe, but not realistically', 'Title could well be ""We\'ve ran out of things to write so here\'s this"".', 'It does sound like he’s more relaxed now, but that would be kind of a bad sign for him, right? If he can perform well with no pressure but crumbles under pressure. But that’s something that can be changed, hopefully he has a good sports psychologist and he’ll likely be better prepared for next season now that he knows a chance at the title is a possibility', 'The quality of headlines coming out of The Race has been on a downward spiral for a year and a half now.']",0,34,0.46,0,159,159,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0
