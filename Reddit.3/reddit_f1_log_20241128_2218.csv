1h1y0bh,How bad is Perez doing right now? Comparisons with Gasly and Albon’s final 10 results for Red Bull.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1y0bh/how_bad_is_perez_doing_right_now_comparisons_with/,2024-11-28, Statistics,"10 races was the number used as Gasly has 10 race finishes in Red Bull - in order to minimise swings in his relatively small dataset, the most recent 10 results from each driver were used (so most recent 10 finished races, with DNFs - both classified and not - excluded, along with exclusion of Gasly’s DSQ in China 2019 Qualy). Where a result is excluded the next most recent race is added to the dataset (so in exchange for excluding Perez’s COTA DNF, we count back and include Silverstone as our 10th)

Qualifying results are the top table, as you can see Albon has the highest average qualifying results with Gasly not far behind. Perez lags behind significantly.

In terms of race results, Gasly has the best average placement and scored the most consistently, though crucially Albon got two podiums in this period. Again, Perez lags behind.

 Race start numbers for each driver being assessed are:

* Gasly - 27-39 (Australia - Hungary 2019)
* Albon - 28 - 39 (Belgium - Abu Dhabi 2020)
* Perez - 271-283 (Silverstone - Las Vegas 2024)

As you see, Gasly and Albon’s level of F1 experience is well matched during these periods. Perez is significantly more experienced than both.

Points totals in these periods (excluding sprints as these didn’t exist in Gasly or Albon’s tenure) are -

* Gasly - 63 (2x FL)
* Albon - 65
* Perez - 33 (1x FL)

So again, Perez is lagging behind both Gasly and Albon.

All 3 stints were done in cars which were clear of the midfield cars behind them. The Red Bull was 3rd best in the grid at the time Gasly drove it, 2nd best at the time Albon drove it, and has swung a little while Perez has but we can be conservative and say 3rd best. All three cars were certainly good enough to make it to Q3.

During the assessed periods Max scored:

* With Gasly - 4 podiums (2x P1, 2x P3)
* With Albon - 5 podiums (1x P1, 3x P2, 1xP3)
* With Perez - 5 podiums (1x P1, 3x P2, 1x P3)

So all cars were at points capable of a win, and certainly capable of podiums.

Based on this I would say that Perez’s recent form is the worst of the three stints.

On the alter was a pair of secateurs, a bowl, a white linen cloth, and a photo of former F1 champion Michael Schumacher. After a demonic oration from Wolff, the Mercedes drivers, engineers, and mechanics stood in queue to the alter, chanting the lyrics to Daftpunk\'s track ""Around The World.""\n\n\n> Wolff began by holding the secateurs high in the air before beginning to clip his fingernails into the bowl.

Hamilton has never been a fan of this fingernail ritual which dates back to when two German Mercedes drivers - former champions Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg - would hang out in\xa0the back of the garage and giggle as they clip their fingernails. It was Rosberg\'s idea to make it a team exercise. It was a tradition that ended once Rosberg retired from the team, and Hamilton beckoned to end the tradition.\n\n\n> After Mercedes 1-2 victory at the Las Vegas GP this year, it is believed that the ritual will once again return throughout the 2024 season.

1h1i3r4,VERY interesting couple of years coming up,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1i3r4/very_interesting_couple_of_years_coming_up/,2024-11-27, Discussion,"Honestly,  
The next couple of years are going to be very spicy on and off the track.

**2025:**  
  
\- **McLaren** should be right out of the gate fighting for both championships  
  
\- **Ferrari** are coming good, if they do not do their between season mess up of car changes they should also be right there. Here is hoping they fix their core ""Ferrari"" problem which always seems to cost them during the season. Just seeing Lewis in Red is going to get a lot of headlines and those merch sales are going to crazy. Will he be competitive and how is Leclerc going to handle that mentally?  
  
\- **Red Bull:** Who will be driver 2. I honestly can not see Perez fixing his issues. It has been 2 years and the only reason to keep him would be the money being pumped in to Red Bull to keep him. Red Bull also continues is self implosion progress with the in fighting and issues so I expect we see more from that.  


\- **Mercedes**: New young driver, how will he get on and are they finally on the path to also be right up there? With 4 genuinely competitive teams on the cards next season this is going to be amazing for us fans.

\- **FIA:**  I can not see anything but them continue to be a mess. I do not see any possibility of real improvement unless they again have a new CEO and do real effective changes like paying for permanent consistent stewards using the same technology every single race.  


**2026:**  
The new new regulations for me kind of say ""Yeah the big change we said would be amazing, did not really work so we trying again"".  
As many would agree I am happy to see the cars ARE getting smaller, it is not much but for me its been one of the bigger issues with the racing with just the sheer size of the modern cars.  
I am not confident on the new aerodynamic concepts for 2026 and I am a little worried we continue down a path of F1 cars all looking to much the same and I hope that will not be the case.  
In the efforts to track more manufactures though it does look like it may be another era of engine dependance so it may be down to who nails the new engines. Mercedes have indicated they are quietly confident along with Ferrari. Red Bull do not seem to be so with all the complaints they have around it.

2026 should also bring 2 more cars on the track with a new team and it will be interesting to see how that all pans out.  
It does mean 2 more drivers on the track and with it being a very US focused team I am sure at least 1 of these would be an American driver. Who would that be, who has the super license to be able to drive?","['One season is not predictive of the next one.
