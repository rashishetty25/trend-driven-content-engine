Given that the F2 graduates this year have all been doing pretty well in F1 (except Jack Doohan who was never given a proper chance), the argument about engines might seem like sour grapes, but the suspicions are there and changing them will not be easy.\n\nIt's not a suspicion, just look at Durksen flying down straights all the time.\n\nIt's clear as day that there's engine disparity."", 'Always nice to be served some local history trivia and F1 business gossip', 'For the new fans, or recent fans ...\n\nJoe Saward was ""The"" F1 journalist back in the paper, hold in your hand, flick the pages, and read until it got awkward, and then go and buy the magazine,  days.\n\nGuy always had insanely good articles, and not just a webpage, but like multiple spreads for an article, once per month.  \n\nI love that his writing has evolved from what was his guaranteed reliable motor-racing report, and has incorporated his GP travel experience, into what has happened in F1.  \n\nOnly time I remember to read it, is when someone posts the link here.  \n\nLast month, I posted some of the old F1 Racing magazine scans, and got a lot of replies from people about how it reminded them of their earlier days.   \n\nSaward\'s articles are like this last link... between ... what was the magazine articles, and the incessant need for clickbait news articles.\n\nRather than clickbait, on the magazines, we\'d get the evolution story about how the journo got the interview, with a driver, followed by four pages of tough questions.  Not sites recycling driver conference questions.\n\n\nEdit:  Can read a Saward essay about travel.  Now, throw into the middle of it, a one-on-one interview with Mika, or Schumacher, or Alonso, or Hamilton etc.  That\'s how most magazine F1 news was.
