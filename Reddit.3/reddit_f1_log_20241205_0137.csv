I decided to look how many points both of them have scored in 2022-2024 seasons, where they have been teammates.

**George Russell:**

* 2022: 275 points
* 2023: 175 points
* 2024: 235 points
* Total: 685 points

**Lewis Hamilton:**

* 2022: 240 points
* 2023: 234 points
* 2024: 211 points
* Total: 685 points

So both of them have scored same amount of points across those three seasons!

What about number of wins between these two? Russell has scored three victories (Brazil 2022, Austria 2024 and Las Vegas 2024), whereas Hamilton has scored two (British 2024 and Belgium 2024).

In case Hamilton scores more points in Abu Dhabi, he will technically become third teammate to Russell who has outscored him over their time as teammates (Kubica did outscore him 1-0 in 2019 and if you want to count 2020, Bottas technically did outscore him 4-3 when they happened to be teammates for that one race).

And, if Russell scores more points, he will become the second teammate to Hamilton who has outscored him over their time as teammates (Button did outscore him 672-657 during 2010-2012 seasons)

So, who do you think will end up having more points in total across these three seasons?

Or do they both end up on same amount of points? This is only possible if either of these two scenarios occur:

1. Both of them end up outside the points (0 points for both) or
2. One of them finishes 9th in the race and the other one finishes 10th. And the one who finishes 10th in the race also drives fastest lap of the race. Both would end up getting 2 points from the race.

And yes, now this statistic will 100% be mentioned on broadcasts during this weekend!","['Now I want them both to DNF to keep this.', ""Russell 9th. Lewis 10th with fastest lap.\n\nIt's the only logical outcome"", 'Crofty is writing this down as we speak', 'A genuinely delicious stat', ""If I remember correctly, Hamilton and Button's three-year partnership also ended with them being close on points, Button beating out Hamilton by just 15 points."", 'Lando must be very close to that total as well.

He wasn't a different driver in 2014 compared to 2013. He was the same 4-time WDC driver, with the same talent. The only thing that changed, **was the car.** \n\nWas it a bad car? **NO.** Could a driver perform with it? **Yes**, look how Daniel beat him in his 'debut' season with RBR. \n\nAnd yet, Vettel **struggled** with the car, regardless of the Renault engine's disappointment. \n\nVettel didn't lose his speed and talent overnight. The car simply did **not** suit him. \n\nSure, to adapt to that new style of 2014 which didn't suit his driving style 'much' didn't help and i'm sure that also had an effect on confidence which really impacts things like a domino effect.\n\nHamilton, after 2021, **especially** losing out the WDC the way it went, has had an impact. It would be no different to anyone, from Vettel, Alonso, Verstappen, etc. But it's not unlike Vettel post-2013. Vettel @ Ferrari revitalized and showed he still had it. **He may not have managed another WDC with Ferrari, and maybe Hamilton won't either.**\n\nLet's see what happens with Max in 2026. He's on a high now, but the whole car change **and** if RBR could go a bad direction in 2016, might be a Vettel and a Hamilton repeat all over again, Perhaps Max will have 5 titles by then though, but it's **very** possible that this happens. \n\nAnybody claiming Max would have 'lost it' after 2025, and say 'it was just the car' is **bonkers** and **ignorant.**\n\nJust like with Vettel 2014, RBR didn't build the car the way they built it around Seb and built a (fast) car with a disappointing engine that could not follow the rules that made the Vettel era with RBR so succesful and had to 'compromise' building a car that's good enough for **both**, which just happened to fit Ricciardo better than Seb.\n\n2022 onwards, not only did Mercedes make a dog of a car that had huge porpoising problems, they built a car that doesn't suit Hamilton and suits George more. Then, Hamilton announced his departure, and Mercedes bailed on anything Hamilton and went with George instead.\n\nThere's a **real good chance** that you'll see Hamilton perform outstanding again in 2025 with Ferrari from the get go. **Vettel beat Raikkonen in his debut year @ Ferrari and finished P3, with a 128 points lead on Kimi.** \n\nVettel's 2014 results had nobody expecting or believing that, and Kimi ain't no slouch. \n\nThere's literally **no reason** to think Hamilton couldn't do exactly the same trick. \n\nAnd final note: maybe, just maybe, the current format really doesn't suit Hamilton. So in his debut year with Ferrari, maybe it won't come to fruits as they hope. But maybe, just maybe, the 2026 rules actually suits Hamilton perfectly and he's gonna dominate again.\n\n**time will tell**"", 'This is Lewis in his Bam Margera ‚Äúlook I‚Äôm not trying to say nothin‚Äô or nothin‚Äô‚Äù phase.\n\nIf it‚Äôs not him, or the setup, it‚Äôs the car.
