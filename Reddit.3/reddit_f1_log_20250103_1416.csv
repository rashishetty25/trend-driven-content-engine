That's a lot of days."", ""Just visited Michael Schumacher's private collection in Cologne. Was super cool."", ""i saw comparison with chess champions, and logic is that current players are better than previous, because they have access to more knowledge. It could be similar to racing, Leclerc, Norris and Russell have the information that Mika and Kimi didn't so by that logic they are better.\n\n**It isn't ridiculous to say**. It's just imo ignoring context of time and resources. Charles wasn't racing in the 90s and Mika in 2020s. Would Charles do the same with less and vice versa? We don't know."", ""> Is it a ridiculous take to claim that Leclerc, Norris and Russell are better drivers than Hakkinen and Raikkonen ?\n\nA little, yes. 3x WDC between Hakkinen and Raikkonen, vs 0 for the rest. Hakkinen beat a pretty strong Schumacher in 1998 and an even faster Irvine in 1999, despite having loads of DNFs. People also don't realise how fast a young Kimi was. He's still 3rd on the all time list of most fastest laps, behind only Hamilton (2nd) and Schumacher (1st), more than half of which came before the end of his championship winning season in 2007, where he beat both the reigning WDC Alonso, and a rookie Hamilton. In 2005 he got 10 out of 19 possible fastest laps. In 2003 he was only 2 points off beating Schumacher to the WDC with 3 DNFs to Schumacher's 1. Early Kimi was a rocket ship.\n\nLeclerc, Norris, and Russell could achieve more in years to come, but right now it's difficult to argue they're better than Mika or Kimi. I think there's an argument to be made for Leclerc and Russell getting multiple WDCs given the right car, but Norris I'm not sure. 2024 showed that even with a championship winning car he's missing that edge that'll make him a multiple WDC when given a hard challenge."", ""Based on the replies here the reason appears to be that some people don't understand that drivers slow down with age."", 'It‚Äôs absolutely not a ridiculous take at all. \n\nHakkinen to me was the second best of his generation but in some ways that says more about the generation than it does about Hakkinen. I think Mika really distinguished himself from Coulthard in the three years they had championship-calibre equipment and the only time they were close - in the first half of 2000 - you can see visibly that Coulthard improved.\n\nHowever, Mika had some issues throughout his career. He had a few start line incidents before his Adelaide accident, and he had an iffy year-and-a-half afterwards as well as some high profile errors in 99. The potential could be seen throughout the time prior to around Silverstone 97 but he never looked as consistently good as he would go on to look in 98 and 2000.\n\nRaikkonen was quite simply never that good. Everything that happened after 2007 - when his sensitivity to car characteristics/regulation changes became apparent and both he and Massa compared badly to top-level team-mates - lines up with him not being as good as he looked before that point.\n\nLeclerc is definitely better than them. I am tempted to say George is too but it is tricky to assess him because Lewis has fluctuated so much in the past three years. Lando I am a bit less sure of because his 2020 vs Sainz is a bad look relative to Leclerc, and while he has almost certainly improved since then it is difficult to establish so much as he hasn‚Äôt been up against a known benchmark in that time.', 'It‚Äôs uncomfortable for a lot of people to say because in their minds it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòWell Hakkinen is a double world champion, how can drivers that only have a few wins be better than him‚Äô, but ultimately I don‚Äôt see any reason why you can‚Äôt rate Leclerc, Russell or Norris above those two. Success is a function of the car and simply the drivers you named haven‚Äôt driven as good machinery as the two Finns so their numbers aren‚Äôt as good, but in terms of performance relative to teammates I think they‚Äôre just as good if not better.\n\nLeclerc performed way better relative to Vettel than Raikkonen did, and his advantage over Sainz was about the same as Hakkinen‚Äôs over Coulthard (I rate Sainz considerably above Coulthard). Norris was very close to Sainz in his second year, and beat Ricciardo by greater margins than Hakkinen had to any teammate, and almost to the same extent Raikk√∂nen did to Coulthard in 2004. Russell has basically matched (slightly past his best) Hamilton over a 3 year period, something I can‚Äôt imagine Raikkonen or especially Hakkinen doing.', ""Imagine how we used to deal with it when the season ended mid-October and didn't start until mid-March!

We can never really do a fair comparison, but at least once all careers are over you can compare stats at some level to give an overview. Until then, any comparison is comparing achieved results vs potential.""]",10,23,0.92,10,22,22,1,1,0.010000000000000009,1

That therefore probably rules him in for a shot, but by no means guaranteed."", 'Considering he was one of the big reasons that Andretti wanted into F1 in the first place then he should at least be given a chance.', ""At least do a test Herta vs Crawford\n\nbecause in the other seat you'll need an experienced driver to help set the car up. A year ago i'd have said Ricciardo but he said he doesn't want to come back so probably Bottas or Perez, or maybe take Sainz or Albon from Williams if the other dominates him next year."", 'If they want to perform well, they shouldn‚Äôt be as stubborn as to have a U.S. driver in one of the seats.', 'The name is pronounced ‚ÄúBottas‚Äù', 'Definitely No', 'In short: No. \nNo doubt he has the skills, but in front of him there are many kids who have gone through the ranks that would most likely get the spot. If they want to go down that route.They will most likely get Wilee Coyote types initially to get the best performance out of the car..', ""I think the decision to use nationality as the deciding factor is a mistake. Being American might open up commercial opportunities, but it doesn't guarantee that a driver will be quick -- or, more importantly, that they can build the team up, which are the two qualities Cadillac need.\n\nThe three drivers Cadillac should be looking at are Bottas, Gasly and Russell. Bottas is the obvious choice because he's been sidelined. Gasly should be an easy pick because he's just being wasted at Alpine. Russell might be an outside shot at best, but if he's shown up by Antonelli, if Mercedes build another dud car, and/or if his relationship with Wolff deteriorates, then getting him would be a major coup.\n\nThe best combination would be Bottas and Gasly. If they can only get one and/or they're forced to take a rookie, then they should be looking at Dino Beganovic, who is a Ferrari Academy driver and impressed in the final rounds of Formula 2. It's only then that they should be considering Herta or Crawford against Beganovic."", 'petition to ban articles from the-race']",0,50,0.41,0,49,49,0,0,0.03999999999999998,0
