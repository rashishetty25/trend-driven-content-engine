One thing has surprised me is that many drivers wouldn't defend the inside line, even if the position was worth fighting for. It's almost like they fancied their chances at simply braking on the racing line instead. Why was this? As modern day drivers, unless at a clear pace disadvantage will almost always defend the inside line and it's usually a mistake if they don't do it soon enough.","['Divebombs would could get you killed back then. Nowadays you just do it and hope the other driver sees it coming and takes evasive action. Otherwise, you have a crash, you get out and then thump the other guy on the helmet. By the rules and risk assessment of today, divebombs are heavily incentivized so drivers have to be much more defensive.', 'From what I\'ve been able to discern from my borderline obsessive viewing and reading about 1970s and 80s F1, it was mostly an unwritten code of conduct sort of thing.\n\nIt was considered bad form to hold up an obviously quicker car, unless it was in the closing stages of the race. Generally if you demonstrated that you had the pace to get alongside a rival, they would simply let you go. It was just too risky to pull the kind of defensive moves we see today with the cars of the time, so this kind of situation developed naturally.\n\nThings began to change in the mid 1980s with the arrival of a new generation of drivers who hadn\'t been around in F1 when death was an ever-present like in the 70s and early 80s. The older drivers still stuck to the old rules of engagement, while newer guys were generally a lot more aggressive both on attack and in defence. Keke Rosberg for example gave a fairly lengthy criticism of Nigel Mansell\'s defensive driving after the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix, dismissing it as ""not Formula 1 tactics"" and giving an example of how earlier in the race he had let Alain Prost past because Prost had been able to put his nose alongside and was clearly quicker. The newer guys didn\'t really buy into that attitude though.', 'I think it was much harder to change your line under braking in the past (depending on how far ""the past"" is of course) so you committed to a line and a braking point some distance before the corner and then rode it out? Drivers now worry about flat spotting, not about four wheel drifting into the gravel trap.', ""Partly it is probably because modern F1 cars are HUGE. Long and wide. This means they can pretty much block the driver behind even with a sub-optimal exit (ie defending the inside line). Being ahead is a huge premium on turn exit as there is really not a lot of room to go around. Another factor would be modern aerodynamics.\n\nI think you'll notice that the early era cars were far smaller (relative to track widths). A car behind with better exit speed could simply drive around the narrower slower car. With less efficient aero, there was not as much loss of grip behind a car whereas today the car behind would lose a lot of front end."", 'When you open the door you should not be allowed to slam it in someone‚Äôs face.', 'Safety was almost nonexistent so risk had a lot more severe consequences.

From most to least important:\n\n- Turbocharger. Putting a turbocharger in the exhaust is great for power and efficiency, but has a significant effect on the noise output. Removing the turbo would significantly drop the power, so you'd need to compensate by increasing the engine displacement (the old V10's were 3.0 litres, and the V8's were 2.4 litres compared to the current 1.6 litre V6).\n\n- Fuel Flow Restrictions. The current PUs have restricted fuel flow that effectively limits their maximus revs to around 12-13k RPM. The V10s back in the day did not have this and revved all the way up to 19k RPM in qualifying.\n\n- Engine configuration. Because of the way the noise is created and the harmonics involved, a V6 does not scream in the same way as a V10 (which has a pretty distinct sound). You could make a larger, higher revving V6 that makes a better noise that's as loud as a V10, but you can't exactly recreate the sound of a V10 with a V6.\n\nFundamentally, if you want an engine that sounds like the older engines, you need a larger displacement, naturally aspirated design that revs higher than the current PUs.

There seems to be this expectation that every driver should be this ‚Äòperfect personality‚Äô, and there is so much hate thrown around if they aren‚Äôt.

Let sportspeople be sportspeople, without having to be 100% likeable at all times.
