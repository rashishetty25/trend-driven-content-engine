1mzt4tf,Max Verstappen’s Trainer: What I’ve Seen in Max That NO ONE Else Has [High Performance Podcast],https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mzt4tf/max_verstappens_trainer_what_ive_seen_in_max_that/,2025-08-25, Video,,"[""There's lots of interesting things here. To me, the most interesting is the info about the mind games played in 2021. Two examples:\n\nMax planned to touch Lewis' car in Interlagos. It was discussed by the team in advance. It was a psychological thing. He knew he'd be fined 50K and there was no performance penalty, so he was fine with it.\n\nMax was always quick to the post race press conferences and sometimes had to wait for Lewis, who liked to change out of his fire suit. As the season went on, Max started going to the press conferences later and later so Lewis had to wait for him.\n\nEdit: also for those that care about such things, Bradley is now Ruth Buscombe's partner."", ""The bit about Max taking initiative in obtaining a sim version of the Jeddah track that even Red Bull didn't have in their sim was very interesting."", 'Anyone wanna recap for those who don’t wanna engage with the clickbait?', ""TL:DW ?

I'm interested only what is in the clickbait title, not enough to watch/listen one and half hours."", 'But rich claiming he could help Max “learn how to win”…', 'Kind of bizarre retelling of the 2021 season as if ""mind games"" determined the outcome and not some peculiar made up restart procedures', ""I also like that the whole elbows out driving style and Red Bull being the big disruptor (with all the politics) was all intentional. That's what they had to do to challenge the mighty Mercedes/Lewis. It wasn't always pretty, but it had to be done."", ""Wait, didn't Ruth get married last year or sth? They mention her changing her last name on F1tv, if I remember correctly."", ""That's kinda funny considering Lewis was at his best in the final leg of the season and (almost) won all of the final races""]",0,31,0.39,0,164,164,0,1,-0.019999999999999962,0

But I loved the strategies based on fuel. Light, slower cars could challenge heavy, better cars. More pit stops. More possibilities of mistake, but also unexpected advantage.

There were some accidents in the past but I’m sure it can be made safer and with possible electric direction. It should be safer I assume?

What do you think?","[""The big argument against refuelling isn't safety - though that certainly is an argument - it's that it kills the racing.
