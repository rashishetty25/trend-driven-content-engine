Basically, it looks at the before-and-after of my time with each team I’ve been part of. The position in the championship of the team when I first join, compared to where they finish when I leave, usually improves by four or five places.

1kxj5hx,[AMuS] Does Hamilton need a new engineer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxj5hx/amus_does_hamilton_need_a_new_engineer/,2025-05-28, News,,"['We are checking', ""Answering your question: \n\nCharles on medium, Mclaren on hard. Lapping '16 very close to each other fighthing"", '*Tension in the Ferrari team*\n\nTranslation:\n\n> **Communication problems between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer Riccardo Adami also made headlines in Monaco. The two don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.**\n\n> In the first few races of the year, the communication problems between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer, Riccardo Adami, could still be attributed to the duo needing to get used to each other. But after their eighth Grand Prix together, the two still don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.\n\n> Minor misunderstandings between drivers and engineers are nothing unusual in Formula 1. In the case of Hamilton and Adami, however, it\'s the tone that makes the difference. Normally, the partner at the pit stop should support the driver and provide clear instructions. At Ferrari, however, misunderstandings and questions arise again and again.\n\n> In the final part of the Monaco race, for example, Hamilton wanted to know if he was still a minute behind the leading four. The answer was no answer: ""Charles is on mediums, the McLarens are on hard tires. They\'re fighting very closely,"" Adami radioed to the driver.\n\n> **The sound makes the music.**\nHamilton reacted audibly annoyed to the useless information: ""You\'re not answering my question. Actually, it doesn\'t matter. I just asked if I was a minute behind."" Only then was Hamilton given the current gap, as requested.\n\n> After the race, a somewhat strange exchange also occurred. Hamilton radioed his engineer on the cool-down lap: ""It wasn\'t the easiest weekend. But we won\'t give up the fight."" He was met with silence, to which Hamilton followed up: ""Are you angry with me, or is something wrong?"" Again, there was no response.\n\n> During his press conference, team principal Frederic Vasseur once again had to answer questions about the somewhat confusing radio messages. The Frenchman attributed the communication problems to the special Monaco layout, where radio communication is only possible in certain sections of the track.\n\n> **Vasseur sees no tensions.**\nFurthermore, Hamilton\'s statements in the cockpit generally shouldn\'t be taken too seriously: ""There\'s no tension just because someone asks a question. He\'s under pressure, he\'s fighting, he\'s driving between the walls – and he\'s doing that at 300 km/h. For me, that\'s all totally fine. I spoke to him after the race. He wasn\'t upset at all.""\n\n> But because this wasn\'t the first time Hamilton and Adami had talked past each other this season, frustration is growing among the record-breaking winner\'s fans. Their idol\'s poor results aren\'t helping to calm the situation, of course. The newcomer isn\'t looking for a chance against teammate Charles Leclerc.\n\n> Many fondly remember the times with Peter Bonnington at Mercedes. ""Bono"" and Hamilton formed a well-coordinated and close-knit team. While there were always a few questions about strategy, a certain respect was always expressed in their communication. The same couldn\'t always be said of Hamilton\'s radio messages in the first races of the year.\n\n> **Leclerc happy with new engineer.**\nEven his interactions with Sebastian Vettel and Carlos Sainz, whom Adami had previously coached at Ferrari, didn\'t always run smoothly. As a result, fans on social media are increasingly expressing their desire for Hamilton to be paired with a new man, preferably a British engineer, to avoid language barriers.\n\n> Ferrari demonstrated last year that it is willing to act in this position when necessary. Midway through the season, for the seventh race in Imola, Leclerc was given a new partner at the pit lane: Bryan Bozzi. The Italian replaced Spaniard Xavier Marcos. Since then, there have been clearer statements, something Leclerc repeatedly praises. Perhaps Ferrari should now try something new with Hamilton.', ""When the driver has to ask if the engineer is mad at him during the race, or when the engineer's mistake costs the driver 3 places on the racing grid, yeah, I think Hamilton needs a new engineer"", 'Short answer: si\nLong answer: yes', 'maybe Ferrari should just give the F1 team to their WEC crew?', 'Is water wet?  Is the Pope Catholic? Similar questions with a similar answer.', ""Whole article about their Monaco communications but amus didn't mention the main miscommunication of the weekend which cost the driver 3 places"", 'It’s a relationship I don’t foresee getting any better. Ferrari is stuck in their own ways though traditionally, culturally with their insistence on hiring Italian/home based. Not to mention it sounds like every engineer is waiting for instructions to be passed down 15 levels before they make a radio call.

Platinum is a *rating* from the FIA, it's not a *licence*. As a driver you request to be rated by the FIA, you do not ask to be given a specific rating. The FIA decides what rating you get. It's like a tool or a guide for racing organisations like the SRO (GT World Challenge etc.), so they know where to place this driver into a certain category (like Pro, Pro-Am etc.), depending also on the rating of the driver's teammates.

Being rated by the FIA does not ""bring Verstappen closer to competing in WEC and ELMS"", because it's not a licence. Being Platinum is not a requirement at all to race in those championships nor did Verstappen need to do anything extra to be given a rating apart from just asking for one.

Also, not all F1 drivers are Platinum-rated. As a driver you only ask to be rated, if you intent on doing sports car racing. Only 6 current F1 drivers (including Max) actually have a Platinum-rating: Alonso (WEC champion and Le Mans winner), Colapinto (ELMS race winner and Spa 24H competitor), Norris and Stroll (Rolex 24 at Daytona competitors), and Hülkenberg (Le Mans winner). Edit: I didn't wanna forget about Friday drivers Drugovich, Hirakawa and Vesti, who too have a rating.

Alongside the facts listed above, my personal expectation is Verstappen might try and do the KW 6h ADAC Ruhr-Pokal-Rennen, the sixth round of the Nürburgring Langstrecken Serie on August 16. He is definitely not doing WEC or ELMS.

Edit: you don't even technically need to ask to be rated, but it is very common to do. As somebody who's been working in the sports car racing industry for a while now, I've seen cases of drivers set to make their debut without having requested to be rated. The FIA will then scramble to find out who this driver is and what their career history is to rate them asap 😅","['At risk of pedantry Haas test driver Ryo Hirakawa, who is doing FP1 for them this week, is platinum too', 'I believe after you turn 50 the FIA takes away your platinum status.

1ky6yot,[AMuS] Excitement through new front wing checks,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ky6yot/amus_excitement_through_new_front_wing_checks/,2025-05-29, News,,"['I expect to be disappointed', ""*Preview of the 2025 Spanish GP*\n\nTranslation:\n\n> **The FIA \u200b\u200bhas announced stricter front wing checks for Barcelona. We'll reveal what this means in our Grand Prix preview.**\n\n> Many engineers have marked the Spanish Grand Prix in bold on their calendars this year. During the winter break, the FIA \u200b\u200bannounced that all teams would have to prepare for more rigorous front wing testing leading up to the Barcelona weekend. Those who had designed the carbon elements to be too flexible in the past had to retrofit them.\n\n> A flexible front wing, in which the main blade and flaps bend backward, not only reduces drag, resulting in higher top speeds on the straights. The built-in flexibility also helps optimize the setup balance between fast and slow corners.\n\n> In tighter corners, drivers want the front axle to grip the turn. This requires a lot of downforce, which a steeply angled front wing produces. In faster corners, it's more comfortable for the drivers if the rear end doesn't veer off so easily. If the front wing is flatter, the aero balance automatically shifts rearward.\n\n> Since this trick became popular over the past two years, teams have taken increasingly extreme approaches to bending. Development has been increasingly tailored to this. With testing becoming more stringent, engineers now have to put the brakes on. The question is which cars will lose the least performance with the stiffer wings.\n\n> Some teams, including McLaren, predict that the new rules won't significantly change the balance of power from the first eight races. Others, such as Red Bull and Ferrari, hope that the gap to the Papaya cars will be noticeably reduced.\n\n> Barcelona could therefore represent a turning point in the season. The varied track has always been a good indicator for the rest of the year. Those who don't show any weaknesses here will be good anywhere. Many teams are also basing their performance on Barcelona as a factor in how long the development of the 2025 cars will progress.\n\n> The weather isn't expected to cause any additional drama. The latest forecasts call for dry conditions throughout the entire race weekend. Maximum temperatures are expected to only slightly exceed 25°C. A warmer climate would be especially welcome for McLaren. Then they could once again use the tire joker in the race – as they did recently in Miami.\n\n> **The track: Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.**\nThe Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya is an ideal benchmark for the cars' performance. Fast corners with high centrifugal forces alternate with medium-speed and slow corners. All-rounders are especially in demand. Those who look good here usually do well on other tracks as well. Because all types of corners are accommodated, an efficient aerodynamic package is required.\n\n> Despite two DRS zones and the more than one-kilometer-long straight, overtaking is traditionally difficult in Barcelona. Qualifying therefore remains crucial. The 600-meter-long sprint into the first corner is one of the longest of the entire season. Here, we often see slipstream battles as the chasing pack chases the man in pole position.\n\n> **Das Setup.**\nBarcelona has been a fixture on the calendar since 1991. The technicians know the track's quirks almost inside and out. The changing winds from the nearby Mediterranean can occasionally throw up surprises. The wings have to be set very steeply at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya to provide sufficient downforce and stability for the fast corner combinations.\n\n> Brake wear is usually not an issue. The engines aren't subjected to excessive strain either. Tires, however, are a regular source of tension in races. As usual, Pirelli brings the very hard compounds C1 to C3. The fast right-hand corners T3 and T9 place particular strain on the left front tire.\n\n> **The Upgrades.**\nAs already mentioned, Barcelona is one of the benchmark tracks in Formula 1. After the wave of upgrades at Imola, we expect to see many new parts on the cars again. Sauber has already announced a larger package. Mercedes also intends to significantly expand its offerings.\n\n> More exciting, however, is the new regulations. Most teams will have to respond to the more stringent endurance tests with reinforced wings. In most cases, the changes will not even be visible from the outside. Mercedes had already conducted test runs in Bahrain and Imola with a stiffer Barcelona wing.\n\n> **The favorites.**\nMcLaren is naturally at the top of the list of favorites again. The high temperatures and above-average tire wear favor Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. The two Papaya drivers travel to Catalunya separated by just three points. This could cause internal tensions.\n\n> Max Verstappen should be significantly more competitive than he was in Monaco. The fast corners of Barcelona are exactly what the RB21 is looking for. The world champion already showed in Imola that he's ready to take advantage of even the slightest opportunity. Since 2016, only two drivers have won in Barcelona: Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton.\n> Speaking of Hamilton: Barcelona will be Ferrari's last chance to turn things around. The Scuderia must finally get its tire problem under control in qualifying. And the setup window must be larger. In Monaco, they were able to concentrate entirely on the slow corners. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200ball-round qualities will be required again.\n\n> Mercedes also travels to Spain with concerns. Tire wear has been the Silver Arrow's Achilles heel twice this year.

The word is that the US is trying to broker such a deal and so Morocco will need to move fast to get a race, although if the money is right there is not reason that F1 cannot have two races in Africa, particularly as a race in Morocco would be more like a European event with the teams able to take all their equipment on ferries from Spain, rather than having pack everything into the flight boxes.

1kxo32d,Madrid track layout,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxo32d/madrid_track_layout/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"So I just saw a layout of the 2026 Spanish Grand Prix in Madrid and it’s getting a lot of hate for the amount of turns and comments about it being yet another track that isn’t conducive to overtakes. I’ve also heard grumbling of how many of the tracks on the current schedule (see Monaco) are similar in difficulty to perform overtakes. 

My question is: what aspect of track design lends to more overtakes? And why are many of these circuits being built this way? Is it more of an issue with the design or is it just how large the modern F1 car is, or a mix of both? You’d think these race organizers would want uh, you know, actually racing instead of a parade of cars (see Monaco again.)

","['Take silverstone, interlagos or cota as examples of good tracks for racing.\n\nTake Hungaro mexico or Sochi to see what’s not good for racing\n\nThen there’s a middle ground of tracks like Spa or Monza that used to be good for racing but are ruined by DRS trains and dirty air\n\nFor an overtaking chance to occur in modern f1 you need a straight that’s not preceded by a slow twisty section and that ends in a heavy braking zone\n\nThe madrid track is an abomination from any point of view', ""I would argue that Bahrain, Interlagos, Las Vegas, Canada and Mexico are the best for overtaking right now. \n\nGenerally F1 cars need a long straight followed by a heavy braking zone to encourage overtaking, with the emphasis on heavy braking. \n\nLots of sequential corners and a narrow track make overtaking difficult. Imola is difficult because it's a lot of medium speed corners with no straights long enough to create overlap. Monaco is difficult because it's narrow and there's basically no straights to create braking events big enough to pass. \n\nJapan was difficult because the dirty air made it hard to be close enough at the beginning of the long straights, and turn 1 isn't a big enough braking event to allow for overtakes. I was surprised there weren't more opportunities at the Casio Triangle but I think 130r makes that hard. \n\nI think a lot of people would argue with me on Mexico being good for overtakes but I think the thin air creates and interesting balance where you get Monza-like downforce levels while trying to add on as much downforce as possible.

1kxpby6,Does Sauber get a pass for being sh*t?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxpby6/does_sauber_get_a_pass_for_being_sht/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"I started watching F1 during the COVID lockdown in 2020 (yes I'm a DTS F1 baby), and I've seen Williams and Haas get absolutely dragged through the mud for some appalling seasons. This is probably fair- Haas had some dismal years from Bad Santa to Mazepin, and Williams during Claire's last years was in a sorry state.  

However, looking at Sauber's F1 results since *2008*, when they placed 3rd in the WCC, they've been quietly and consistently bad. Sauber has managed to place higher than 7th in only three seasons: 

2009: 6th 

2012: 6th 

2022: 6th  

Unlike both Williams and Haas, which are on an upward trajectory, Sauber seems to only be getting worse. So where is the uproar over their poor performance? Does Sauber not have a dedicated fanbase like the other teams?  

Wondering if some real F1 veterans can enlighten me on this one. 

Thanks!","[""Sauber have always been underdogs (with the exception of when they were owned by BMW). They went through some very bleak years a while back - they didn't turn on the wind tunnel because they couldn't pay for the electricity at one point.\n\n\nNow they're kind of in a transitional period and it was expected that they would not be great, however the political infighting between Seidl and Hoffman hurt the development of the team."", 'Williams got a lot of flack in my opinion because they are a historical team and people expect more success out of them. They’ve been surpassed by the 2 other historical teams (McLaren and Ferrari) and leapfrogged by the 2 newcomers (Mercedes and Red Bull), so there’s a level of disappointment. As far as HAAS goes, they’ve had too many seasons where they seemed incompetent (2021 comes to mind) and have had their fair share of drama.\n\nAs for Sauber, they’ve always been an underdog team with lower funding and fewer fans, so of course lower expectations. People do love some of their drivers and moments (Kubica my goat), but they’ve also gotten equal and well-earned criticism for pay drivers and now controversial sponsors. I think the lack of fans just put them in the back of most people’s minds. Kinda hard to hate on the team that’s always forgotten.', 'They are in a holding pattern until being Audi branded. They expected to be nowhere.\xa0', ""In addition to what's already been said by others, the longer-term F1 fans have seen lots of examples of *really* bad teams, and Sauber have never hit those lows. Sure, they've been last in the championship, but they've never been several seconds behind midfield (e.g. when Caterham, Virgin & HRT joined in the early 10s), and they never been a total headcase outfit (look at examples from the 90s like Lola, Andrea Moda or Life). The grid is so close together nowadays (<2s) that unfortunately someone has to be last, but I'd say they are still performing at a very respectable level for their resources.\n\nAlso, they have historically been the launching pad for some great young drivers - all of these guys who made their F1 debut with Sauber went on to win races or championships later in their careers: Frentzen, Raikkonen, Massa, Kubica, Vettel, Perez, Leclerc."", ""Saubers been the plucky underdog for almost 30 years now (Over 30 years if you include BMW years) at this point it's a surprise if they aren't at the back."", 'There are 10 teams. Someone\'s going to be at the back. If some teams are ""on an upward trajectory"" then others have to be the opposite. \n\nSauber are not consistently last in every qualifying/race. And even if they were, why people feel the need to dump on the team at the back is beyond me. That they can build a car so close to the fastest track car in the world is commendable. But a McLaren is a ""rocketship"" and a Sauber is a ""shitbox"", according to some people. It\'s crazy. They are both incredibly fast.', ""They are being given a pass, yes. Because for the longest of time (1993 - 2005, 2010 - 2016), it was a privateer team, which meant lower budgets, less sponsors and all decisions being filtered through one person (Peter Sauber). When they were given the time of the day, when they became the BMW factory team, they did deliver as well as they could. As for their current stint... well, they got shafted when they became Ferrari's C-Team, with Ferrari seemingly more interested in developing Haas than investing in them. And now they're in a holding pattern for Audi, not even bothering to recover from the Alfa Romeo stint cause, why spend the money when Audi can spend theirs?"", ""I feel like Sauber gets dragged for it all the time, but in the last few years, it's been understandable. They've been in the process of selling to Audi for a few years, and it's also the last few years of the regulations. It doesn't really make sense for Sauber (team now owned by Audi) to put a lot of money into making a good car when they are about to finally be under the Audi name, and want to spend all possible money towards making 2026 and the future as good as possible.\n\nProbably they'll get a pass at first in the new regulations because they have a first time engine manufacturer, so we might assume it's that if they struggle.\n\nFrankly, they aren't that far off the pace. All the drivers and all the cars are so good. Usually everyone is within a second in qualifying, and that definitely hasn't always been the case in F1. Honestly sometimes F1 qualifying is tighter in times than professional spec series qualifying, even when we all know that there's a general pattern that the better drivers are at the better teams, with some exceptions for most teams having a number one and number two driver, and some drivers not fitting in the driver market. With that taken into account, it's crazy how tight the whole F1 grid is. Sauber doesn't always have both cars out in Q1. They are bad, but there is usually a team this bad or worse. Hulkenburg getting some points in the first race by surviving and taking advantage of the weather took some pressure off them so they don't have to worry about having a pointless season."", 'You can say ""shit"", eh?']",0,84,0.4,0,438,438,0,1,0.020000000000000018,0
