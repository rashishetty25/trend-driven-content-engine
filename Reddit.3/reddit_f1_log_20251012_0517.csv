Let's say you're Mercedes, and you've built the best engine. Now you have a competitive edge on Honda or Ferrari. But if you then sell your engine to Aston or McLaren, how do you maintain a competitive advantage? Do you tell them nothing about how it works? Do you detune it in some way and they have to figure out how to squeeze performance out of it? Or do you then just give up that advantage and totally rely on the chassis and aero being better than Aston/McLaren? Hopefully my question makes sense.","['In the past customer engines would not have the same performance but that is now illegal. Customers would also have very little say in the engine packaging which would also cause issues for their development but that has changed as well. McLaren gets all the information about next years engine at the same time as Mercedes and also has a say in packaging and other configuration options. Which means any performance difference between McLaren and Mercedes will not be caused by the engine. Not sure if Williams has the same deal as McLaren is paying extra to have that information and input.', 'By the regs the PU supplied to all Works or Customer teams must be the same.\xa0\n\nThe slight performance differences come way earlier in the design stage, where a Works competitor like Mercedes or Aston next season can fully design their chassis to be perfectly compatible with the PU (or the other way around).\n\nEverything down to the location of a coolant hose, how electrical harnesses are routed can be collaborated on with a works PU. A Customer team will have to work around what’s provided to them.', ""Well, the cars need more than an engine to go fast around a track. Ask yourself why McClaren is faster than Mercedes the last two years when they're using the same engine, but Williams is slower than both. Everything outside of the engine is important too."", ""There's specific rules against all of these things.  Engine manufacturers can't sell competitors detuned engines or keep proprietary secrets anymore.  They have to master their own engine just like anyone else.  the only advantage they have is that they have the minds that designed the engine on staff to give them some pointers."", ""The whole idea is that generally, if the engine and the rest of the car are made within the same company, the engineers who developed the engine get to directly share the minute details that can end up making all the difference in F1. But if a customer team's aero department does an outstanding job, they can overturn that potential advantage, as McLaren have done the last 2 seasons."", "">But if you then sell your engine to Aston or McLaren, how do you maintain a competitive advantage?\xa0\n\nConsidering where Mclaren is at, clearly they don't keep the advantage. but generally controlling the car and the engine design is beneficial."", 'I also read that the engine supplier creates their engine to be optimised for their associated oils and lubricants sponsor. So Mercedes engines out of the box are optimised for Petronas. When they’re sold, the customer has to adapt them to their own oil supplier. Not sure how much truth there is to that but it sounds pretty feasible.', ""I think the engines need to be mechanically all the same, they cannot sell de-tuned engines anymore (I don't know when it stopped). But the software can still be different, engine mapping can be different and custom oil and fuel can also make a difference.\n\nOne example is Mercedes and their party mode (banned for a while now) that was not given to the customer teams.\n\nThey likely also have better diagnostic data about the engine and can run it more aggresively. The customer teams probably need to be more conservative to protect the engine."", ""The main thing between customer and manufacturer is data and design. McLaren get the engine and design their car around that. Mercedes can design the engine and car at the same time.\n\n\nIt gets complicated when a manufacturer also has a team (Ferrari mercedes) and customers as in theory the customer will always be second best. However a car is not just an engine. It's also a gearbox, suspension, aero and driver.\xa0\n\n\nHowever the engine is the one of the biggest things when it comes to the cars historically and so being the main or only engine runner is a big deal, you have your teams reputation and the engine makers too (honda for example, fuck it Renault too deciding not to make engines anymore)\xa0"", 'The goal is to infiltrate the dealers and find the supplier!']",57,40,0.87,57,38,38,8,9,0.020000000000000018,8

Its showing the garage, marina, infinity pool, random crowd shots or top cars where there is NO action happening instead of ACTUAL OVERTAKES. We saw the Kimi overtake on Charles about 10 laps later. We never saw Lance, Carlos overtakes, We didn't see Fernando catching Lewis at the end. There is no reason we had to see Lando sitting in Max's dirty air for 30 laps instead of all this. This happens in Quali too. Why tf would we want to see somebody pulling into their pit box and being wheeled into the garage instead of somebody else SETTING THEIR FAST LAP? The disrespect to anybody that is not in the Top 4 teams is ridiculous."", 'Spoken by the man who is absolutely obsessed with drivers wives and girlfriends', 'It’s not about that. It’s about why do we have time to show girlfriends but they can’t show the only drivers doing passes? Broadcast direction has been trash this year.', ""I'm pretty sure thats still more time than Carlos himself got (actually not sure, but it surr felt like it)"", 'It’s not just the girlfriends, it’s the overall bad direction like watching lap after lap of a chase that would never amount to a pass. The girlfriends are just another example.\xa0', 'If you want to strawman sure, but the problem is we spent like 30 laps watching Lando catching Max. There are parts of the circuit where overtaking is near impossible. When Lando got passed the main overtaking DRS zone we could have shown Carlos Sainz, Alonso, or others making moves. Also we could just get replays that we can play when Lando and Max get into tighter parts of the circuit. Doesn’t have to be live', 'Not surprising the biggest creep of the paddock is saying this broadcast is ok\n\nAnd even those 15s is way more than Carlos got while overtaking', 'Kym Illman is a creep.', 'Its always the  same 4 girlfriends every grand prix thats why its so annoying, we dont need to see them at every track', '15 seconds is an eternity in Formula 1, especially when you’re prioritizing celebrities over on-track action.']",0,99,0.38,0,95,95,0,2,0.010000000000000009,0
