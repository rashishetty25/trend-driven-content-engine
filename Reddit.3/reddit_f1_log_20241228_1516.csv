I remember Smedley mentioning on a podcast that because all these kids want to be picked up by an academy they front load the costs in Karting, spending thousands to get the best machinery and test a shed load just to be noticed. Like there's kids spending more on Karts than they would on cars, talking around 400k just to do Karting.\n\nYou can see how thats just unsustainable, so making it more affordable just has to be done. I also like the fact they are using electric Karts as its a solid way to level the playing field to find the most talented drivers because then engine power is the same all round. I remember Rowland saying that as well, saying he wished that was the case for all of Karting because at the moment it's way more about equipment than the driver.\n\nIt's just we're seeing a lot more talent being priced out. It's just going to lower the quality of the drivers we're getting in the future. I mean it's always been a rich man's sport, but now it's getting on all new level of rich.
