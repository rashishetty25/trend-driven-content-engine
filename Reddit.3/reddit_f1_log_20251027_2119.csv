Also worth noting: the first time Leclerc and Verstappen passed through the double-yellow zone, Verstappen gained nearly 4 tenths on Leclerc in the stadium by not slowing down as much. He almost passed Leclerc on the main straight by setting up the overtake (aka, racing) in a double yellow zone.

He had a fundamentally different approach to most of the lap, braking and accelerating later than Norris. This especially cost him exiting the esses, because otherwise it wasn't costing him time really. Could this also lead to rear tyre overheat and lower traction towards the end of the lap? He has visibly less smooth run from the last corner, this alone losing him almost two tenths.

Hard to explain the loss in the first sequence that put him on a back foot for the rest of the lap. Watching the onboards it seems Norris attacked the second corner more bravely, went on the throttle before the curb and simply took the following bumps on the chin, with good effect. Only Oscar knows why he didn't do the same.

The loss was basically:

* 3 tenths in the first sequence
* 1 tenth exiting the esses
* 2 tenths exiting the final corner

It feels like every single one of them has had some incredible breakout drives this season and are all absolutely holding their own to their experienced teammates.

Bortoleto going from P16 to points was another storyline that got missed in the chaos of the front but was absolutely well done. And Kimi holding his own towards the front with a McLaren baring down towards him, another solid weekend from him. It’s funny how a lot of these rookies seem to have stellar weekends in tracks where they would have never raced before, and super impressive.', 'After Zandvoort, things looked super grim for Lando and Oscar seemed to have one hand on the WDC. Five straight McLaren wins (would have been 5 straight 1-2s if not for the mechanical DNF), Max a hundred points back, it looked like McLaren were going to run the table with wins for the rest of the season and the odds of Lando pulling out enough wins over Oscar to claw back a 34 point deficit looked downright impossible. Many people were (rightfully) saying he’d need to go on a run of consistency he’s never shown before to do it. \n\nSince Zandvoort, he’s been 5-0 over Oscar in races and 4-1 in qualifying. There has been no other stretch this whole season where either of them have outscored the other more than three weekends in a row. He’s outscored Oscar by an average of 7 points per weekend over those 5 races—which is the exact amount he would have outscored him by if he won 5 straight with Oscar finishing P2 every time, something that seemed impossible to imagine a few months ago. While everyone was focusing on Max’s incredible run (and well deserved, he’s had some amazing performances the last 5 races) and Max’s chase of Oscar’s lead, Lando has been seemingly almost quietly just chipping away every weekend at whatever he could get. He hasn’t been perfect, he’s had his mistakes in Baku and in Singapore qualifying, but he’s just kind of kept his head down and done what he needed to do each weekend. \n\nThere’s still a long way to go and this WDC could truly go any direction, but you’ve gotta give credit to Lando for how he’s shown a ton of resilience this season. To bounce back from Canada by winning 3 of the next 4, and to bounce back from Zandvoort by retaking the championship lead just 5 races later is super impressive and something I don’t think many people expected him to be able to do.', 'Can anyone explain, why FIA let Leclerc keep his position after cuts the corner, please no memes like because he is lord Leclerc', ""I still maintain that Max would've had an absolute ass time trying to overtake that DRS train that just collectively disappeared for a pitstop. I think he would have finished 4-5th with everyone fighting each other."", 'The rules definitely need changing, too many people just pretend to bail out and take short cuts to keep their positions. \n\nF1 rules are flawed AF. the overtaking rules is always being exploited by smart drivers like Max and prevents fair and hard racing.

1oh7gaq,Jenson Button's 2010 'Butterfly Effect' Rewrote F1 History,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oh7gaq/jenson_buttons_2010_butterfly_effect_rewrote_f1/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"A single driver move in 2010 changed the trajectory of multiple champions and the dynamics of the entire grid. When Jenson Button, fresh off his championship win with Brawn GP (the team that became Mercedes), opted for McLaren, he set off a chain of events that defined the next decade of F1.
What if Button had stayed?
Button at Mercedes (the dominant era): Button, with his smooth style and skill, would have had a second golden opportunity. He likely would have won multiple championships in the hybrid era, much like Lewis Hamilton.
Hamilton at McLaren: Without Button, Lewis's story with McLaren would have continued. He might have stayed longer, but it's unlikely he would have tolerated the McLaren-Honda disaster. His frustration would have pushed him to seek another top team, like Ferrari, completely changing his trajectory.
Vettel at Red Bull: Sebastian Vettel's frustration with Mercedes' dominance was the main reason for his departure to Ferrari in 2014. With Button at the wheel of the dominant Mercedes, Vettel might have hung on longer at Red Bull. This would have affected the rise of other drivers, like Sergio Pérez and Max Verstappen.
Verstappen's rise delayed: With Vettel still at Red Bull, the opportunity for Max Verstappen wouldn't have come so quickly. Max's meteoric rise, with his 2016 victory, would likely have been delayed by several years.
Ferrari and other teams: If Pérez had signed with Ferrari (a real possibility in 2013), the team's lineup would have been very different. Also, Nico Rosberg's retirement after the intense rivalry with Hamilton never would have happened, so Bottas wouldn't have arrived at Mercedes in 2017.


Without Jenson Button we would never have seen the dominance of Hamilton or Max Verstappen, nor Alonso in the Honda era, nor even Vettel at Ferrari, nor the retirement of Rosberg and the signing of Bottas at Mercedes.So obviously events from 2010 to 2025 would never have happened but anyway what do you think?

1ohapgy,F1 stewarding. Why is Max Verstappen assessed differently to other drivers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohapgy/f1_stewarding_why_is_max_verstappen_assessed/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"Before I start, I want to preface this by saying I am not a Max hater, I think he is one of the best drivers to ever grace the sport, however, it amazes me how much he gets away with on track compared to other drivers, yesterday's race being a prime example.

Let's take each incident from yesterday's race. 

1. Lap one. Max makes a great start and is forced wide into turn one. Knowing that if he brakes at the appropriate point to make the corner he is most likely going to come out in p5, given the shape of the corner, he overshoots the corner and runs across the grass. Before people say he gave the places back, I would argue they weren't his places to begin with, as he was in overspeed whilst everyone else was braking so of course he was alongside at the apex. If there was a wall there he would be forced to tuck in and not have a risk free pass. I can't believe there wasnt a penalty for this. For the record I think Leclerc should have had one as well, Lewis seemed to get passed him and instead of staying on track he just cut the corner and took the place. 

2. The incident with Lewis. This one is perhaps even more egregious. He comes from a long way back and makes a lunge on Lewis. Lewis is banged into and is forced off track. Max then, on the outside for the next corner with Lewis on the inside, just cuts the grass and takes the place from Lewis. I can't believe this was not a penalty, it was a slam dunk penalty for forcing a driver off track and gaining an advantage. Cut and dry. Then Lewis gets a 10 SECOND Penalty for locking up at turn 4 and not giving the place back, which I think was incredibly harsh but it is what it is.

3. The VSC. This is an interesting one as I've seen alot of people saying the FIA screwed Max with the VSC, however before that during double yellows, Verstappen gained about 5tenths in the last sector by not lifting compared to Charles, which is the reason he was so close coming out of the last corner when the VSC was thrown. If it hadn't have been thrown and Verstappen would of got the move done, it would have been interesting to see what the stewards would've done.

I think this points to a wider conversation about f1 stewarding, and it's integrity. It feels to be like for some drivers they have incredibly harsh penalties but for others they can drive incredibly recklessly and no punishment is afforded. There is no consistency at all and it baffles me that these stewards are watching the same race as everyone else.

Anyway happy redditing and welcome opposing viewpoints and discussion :)","[""As for point number one, he did brake at the usual point, however he was forced off the track and onto the bumpy curb where he started bottoming out, at which point you cannot slow down at the normal rate.\n\n\nThe second incident was a messy bit of driving all around, however Chandok's Sky analysis said the stewards got it right.TLDR he was ahead at the apex of turn two and kept it on the track, he was ahead at the apex of turn 3 and Hamilton pushed him wide, thus he didin't need to give the place back, and Hamilton gained a substantial advantage with his off road driving which is why he got a penalty. As for my opinion, the whole sequence was on the edge of the rulebook and if he did get a penalty it wouldn't surprise me, same as it wasn't a massive surprise he didn't get one.\n\n\nAs for the yellow flag incident, the precedent was set in I think Miami, that even a slight lift is enough, so it could be the case that Leclerc lifted more than what was necessary but none of us can judge without the telemetry and I believe other teams would have brought it up if the brach was substantial.\n\n\nLastly, I find it funny that the most punished driver of the last 18 months is thought of having preferential treatment. Stewards rotate every race and while the consistency is lacking because of it, it also ensures no individual bias. And the only confirmed biased steward, who was later removed (Johnny Herbert) was, interestingly, anti-Max."", 'this is going to be a loooong break of useless repeated posts', 'the drivers agreed to these rules. he was not assessed differently.', 'Do you guys watch races with eyes closed?', '1. Stewards are typically lenient on lap one incidents and ultimately he left the track in P4 and rejoined in P4 so he didn’t gain anything \n\n2. Per the driving rules, Max had his mirror ahead at the apex and so long as he had control of his car and didn’t go off track he’s free to push Lewis wide. As for the following corner it’s just the nature of the circuit and the line Lewis was now on, Max couldn’t have stayed on track whilst avoiding contact. Then at the next corner where lewis locked up, the stewards found he gained and lasting advantage and didn’t give the position back hence the 10 second penalty\n\n3. Delta isn’t a good measurement for this kind of incident, you need to look at the telemetry to see if he lifted significantly. For example Charles might’ve lifted more than he needed to, which caused the delta to close up. That being said I haven’t personally seen the telemetry and there wasn’t an official investigation which was a bit surprising but I imagine that might’ve been different had he got past', 'It is cut and dry that he did not force Lewis off at T1 and then avoided him by cutting the next corner. Hamilton then left the track and gained a lasting advantage by doing an overtake like that. Hamilton is simply in the wrong according to the applicable guidelines, whatever your opinion about those might be.\n\nVSC was related to potential fire being reported and the following marshal intervention. Nothing to do with on-track battles. And no indication that someone didnt lift enough.\n\nWhen a T1 goes like yesterday its difficult for the FIA to assess exactly who is and is not in the right, and they tend to let things go especially on lap 1 and with multiple drivers involved. Again, think about it what you want, but i dont think Verstappen got any special treatment there.', '> Lap one. (...)  I can\'t believe there wasnt a penalty for this.\n\nHe was well ahead of Russell long before the corner, before he event went to the outside to attempt to overtake the Ferraris. Arguing that he wasn\'t is just disingenuous. \n\n> Before people say he gave the places back, I would argue they weren\'t his places to begin with, as he was in overspeed whilst everyone else was braking so of course he was alongside at the apex.\n\nWhat are you even talking about here? Yes, they weren\'t his places to begin with, which is exactly why he needed to give them back, which he did. Do you think the rules say you only need to give a place back if you *didn\'t* gain it off track? Your whole argument here makes no sense at all.\n\n> The incident with Lewis. This one is perhaps even more egregious. He comes from a long way back and makes a lunge on Lewis. Lewis is banged into and is forced off track.\n\nMax came from a long way back, but was ahead at the apex, in full control of his car, and able to make the corner on his own. Therefore he was entitled to space and it was Lewis to needed to make sure there was no contact. Lewis failed to do this, and the stewards actually investigated him for it (as they should), but they basically deemed the contact too insignificant to penalize, considering neither car got damaged.\n\nPhrasing a contact Lewis initiated as ""Lewis got banged into"" just shows how incredibly biased and dishonest you are being in your entire argument.\n\n> Max then, on the outside for the next corner with Lewis on the inside, just cuts the grass and takes the place from Lewis.\n\nAgain, complete nonsense. Max was ahead of Lewis at this point, and the only reason Lewis was still sort of alongside was because he went off track at the exit of turn 1. Max is obviously entitled to space at this point, but Lewis leaves him none, forcing Max off. At that point Max has no choice but to cut the corner.\n\nHe then rejoined the track ahead of Lewis, gaining the place, and immediately lost it again when Lewis cut the next corner and gained a few seconds from that.\n\nI\'d argue that if Max had stayed ahead, he clearly would not have had to give the place back. But that\'s not even relevant since he didn\'t.\n\n> I can\'t believe this was not a penalty\n\nFor what? Leaving the track and *not* gaining and advantage? People keep demanding a penalty for this incident, and I really wonder how they think the rules work.\n\nEven ignoring the fact that Max was clearly entitled to that space and so wouldn\'t have had to give the place back if he had stayed ahead, the fact is that he didn\'t. You can\'t get a penalty for gaining an advantage if you did not gain an advantage. How is that not obvious?\n\n>  it was a slam dunk penalty for forcing a driver off track and gaining an advantage. \n\nThe driver being forced off was Max Verstappen. Are you saying he should get a penalty for forcing himself off?', ""because he knows the rulebook better than the stewards and is always pushing it to the limit, he's by far the hardest driver to steward"", ""Did you watch the race last year? Then, both situations went against him and he got 2x 10 second penalty. And that was based on the rules of F1.\n\nBased on the rules of F1, Verstappen didn't deserve a penalty for either situation this year. Don't hate the player, hate the game. 19 drivers agreed to the rules of wheel-to-wheel racing."", '1 day later and the narrative still hasnt changed?\nu can argue that the rules are bad but the application was correct yesterday, only leclerc shouldve given a place back on lap 1']",0,139,0.35,0,115,115,0,0,0.009999999999999953,0
