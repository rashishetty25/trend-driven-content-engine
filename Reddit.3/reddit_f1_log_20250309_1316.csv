For me, I think it will end up being Perez and Jak Crawford. I think they'll want a young driver and a vet. Bottas is probably the best vet available, but it will probably be Perez because he's from Mexico and can bring big sponsor money and a lot of Mexican fans.
And Jak because I think they'll want a young American driver and I don't think that Herta is as strong a connection as it was before.

I think it should be Bottas and Yuki. Yuki doesn't have a contract for next year and even though he's not so young anymore, he still has potential and hasn't gotten the shot he deserves. And Bottas is the best vet available.

And I personally would love for it to be Bottas and Mick Schumacher. This is meant to just be who you would love to see, I know this won't happen, I know that it shouldn't happen, but man I really want to see Mick drive anything other than a Haas. Him and Valterri are my favourite recent drivers.

Let's hear yours!","['One will be a US marketing opportunity (Herta, Palou, O‚ÄôWard)\n\nThe other will be someone loaded with sponsorship money because Cadillac will need that cash injection to start (Zhou, Perez)', 'Who do I think will get them: Checo and Herta\n\nWho do I think should get them: Bottas and Herta\n\nWho do I want to get them: Me and My Buddy', ""I'll be really disappointed if it's checo or ricciardo.

6. Williams

8. VCARB
9. Haas
10. Sauber

I think Williams takes a step forward on driver talent alone. Last year was a disappointment for them, but I really feel Sargeant dragged the whole team down. Alpine and VCARB had good momentum, their success will rely heavily on if their new drivers can perform at this level. Haas I just don't believe in and Sauber I see mailing it in as next year is the year.. but Hulk scoring some points and getting them to a few Q3s is entirely possible.

I wouldn't rule out challenging Aston for 5th to be honest (though I don't expect AMR to drop further than 6th unless they have a particular difficult season). \n\nBehind that...

He never reached even close to that level for the rest of his career, being soundly outperformed by Johansson the following year and Berger from 1987-1988, then spending the rest of his career in backmarker teams.\n\nTrulli in 2004. Trulli was a good driver, but for him to be match/beat Alonso in the same car is a huge outlier compared to the form in the rest of his career. His first half of the season was superb, but after losing the podium on the last lap in France, his performance and relationship with Briatore deteriorated and he was sacked before the end of the year (although he was still one point ahead of Alonso by then).\n\nIrvine in 1999. Irvine was a good, underrated driver, but his 1999 performance is an outlier in his career. Even excluding the races Schumacher missed through injury, Irvine outscored him 46-44. Obviously there are some caveats (Australia, France, Malaysia), but still a great performance by Irvine nonetheless.

On that basis, I would give a slight edge to the Red Bull.\n\nThe one thing people might say is an outlier about that year is that Vettel and Webber were quite closely matched, but to me that‚Äôs consistent with Vettel having a fair bit of improvement left in him. Webber was better in Monaco, Turkey, Germany, Hungary and Brazil. Webber also finished ahead in Spain, which is partially on Vettel for being unable to overtake Massa, but partially on the team for not strategising a way out of that situation. Vettel also took himself out hitting Kubica in Australia and got himself a drive through in Singapore. That to me is a much higher number of races (half the season pretty much) where Vettel didn‚Äôt maximise the potential of the car compared to a good number of years after 2010.']",5,15,0.86,5,15,15,2,0,0.14,2
