1m8y3k9,[AMuS] Verstappen is commited to stay at Red Bull for 2026. But Red Bull agreed to let him go for 2027 in case he wants to leave the team,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m8y3k9/amus_verstappen_is_commited_to_stay_at_red_bull/,2025-07-25, News,,"['Great, now what are we gonna talk about over the summer break?', 'Would be interesting if George and Kimi only get 1 year contract extensions', 'This seems like a fairly smart move by Max. He might forfeit the chance at a 2026 title should Merc be capable of it, but he also eliminates the risk of being locked into a bad situation, be that Merc underperforming or committing to Red Bull only for their works engine to flop. \n\nAlso helps Merc avoid paying an enormous sum to buy him out right now.', 'This doesn’t fit my narrative', 'Google Translation \n\n> The Verstappen mystery is beginning to unravel. For months, the industry has been puzzling over whether the Dutchman will stay at Red Bull or join Mercedes. After Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff and Verstappen met during the break following the Silverstone race in Sardinia, rumors of a transfer were reignited.\n\n> The much-quoted exit clause will come into effect after the Belgian GP. According to this clause, Verstappen could leave if he finishes worse than third in the World Championship. With an 18-point lead over fourth-placed George Russell, this is rather unlikely, despite the points inflation on a sprint weekend.\n\n> It has since leaked out that Verstappen will stay with Red Bull in 2026. He still describes the team as his second family. And from his perspective, it\'s not about exit clauses or personnel matters, but about the team proving to him that it can build a competitive car. ""The last year and a half haven\'t been so good. Now we\'re looking ahead. We have to work on the car and improve it for this year, but also for next season.""\n\n> With this, the world champion is already confirming between the lines that he will definitely stay with Red Bull for another year. The defending champion\'s camp has realized that a hasty move will create more problems than it solves. As of today, no one can reliably predict who will have a good or bad chance next year. A fellow driver says: ""If you\'re going to make a mistake, it\'s better to do it with the team you\'re with. In 2026, you\'ll be able to make a much better choice with more knowledge.""\n\n> Verstappen would have to commit to Mercedes or another team long-term. Anyone who moves now can\'t immediately turn around a year later. At Red Bull, he would effectively be free at the end of 2026. Then the cockpits at Ferrari, Aston Martin, and Mercedes will also be filled.\n\n> Verstappen could, of course, continue driving for Red Bull if the team succeeds in challenging for victories, even under the new regulations. Verstappen\'s management has demanded this freedom. Team boss Christian Horner refused to accept it. This is said to have been the final piece of the puzzle for his disempowerment.\n\n> It would also be interesting to see what happens if Verstappen, contrary to expectations, slips to fourth place after the Belgian GP. Then Toto Wolff will have to consider the Verstappen option again.\n\n> In that case, Andrea Kimi Antonelli would probably have to leave and be parked at another Mercedes team. This is how one should interpret the statements of George Russell, who emphasized again in Spa: ""If you look at the facts, Mercedes can\'t get ahead of me.""\n\n> George Russell could live with Verstappen, even if the two drivers aren\'t best friends. ""I have respect, but I\'m not afraid of Max."" For Mercedes, it would be a fine line to form the two very different superstars into one team. That would almost be on the scale of what happened with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren. This speculation may already be history after the Belgian weekend. Then Mercedes will tell its drivers the truth.', 'There are so many conflicting reports about Verstappen’s contract and plans. Every story seems to be claiming something different\n\nI’m just waiting for August when Mercedes announce either a Russell contract extension or that they’ve signed Max. I honestly don’t think the people writing these articles know much more than the rest of us', ""Whichever team is quickest in 2026, that's where he'll go.

Said it was the first time it had ever happened in his career', 'Went from handing in manuscripts about where Ferrari needs to improve to win championships...to this within the space of a day.\n\nJust Ferrari things.', 'It was an odd mishap. Even at first view, the spin and loss of the rear was FAR earlier than usual for an F1 car. When I saw it, my immediate thought was ""the car broke"" because it seemed like it spun while mostly on straight line braking. If the car spun as it tried to turn into the apex or coming out of the apex, that would be a typical ""too aggressive"" driver move but this really didn\'t seem like it.', 'A key trend in F1 at the moment is for fairly extreme anti-squat and anti-dive geometry to keep the car ""flat"" under acceleration and braking and preserve a consistent ride height for optimal aero.\n\nAll of that theoretically makes the car faster, but it reduces the ""feel"" for the driver. As an accomplished sim racer, Verstappen is probably well placed to exploit this and drive fast without being able to feel the car as well - might explain why RedBull cannot seem to find a team mate able to consistently exploit the car\'s capabilities. Verstappen isn\'t a magician,  there is simply a performance ceiling where the car couldn\'t lap any faster that he can get close to. Piastri\'s McLaren has more front anti-dive than Norris is comfortable with and is therefore theoretically faster IF he can exploit it.\n\nEvery change to the suspension that impacts squat/dive is going to slightly change the optimal brake bias and how the downforce level changes under acceleration and braking. Lewis just found where the limit is. If you never come off the track, you aren\'t trying hard enough to go fast.\n\nOn a fast track like Spa, consistent ride height and the ability to deliver more consistent ground effect downforce is going to allow less top-down aero and a higher top speed. Ferrari haven\'t done the drivers any favours timing the new package for a sprint weekend on a high speed / hairy circuit like Spa - it has the most potential to make a difference here, but the drivers need to learn how the car now behaves.', 'Here we go…\n\nWhy can’t we just take anything at face value anymore.

SVT Sport: “The duel continues — F1 driver Ollie Bearman’s Varberg kart track record didn’t last a full week before Elton Zewenwacht, 23, reclaimed it.”  ￼

The story follows up on Bearman’s previously celebrated kart lap record in Varberg, where he clocked 28.97 seconds after several days of dedicated practice and technical fine-tuning—lighter clothing, chassis tweaks, fuel adjustments, setting tire pressure lap-by-lap, and even using a leaf blower to cool the engine  ￼.

-But a New Champion Emerges

Barely one week afterward, Elton Zewenwacht took the wheel. Unlike Bearman’s multi-day effort, Zewenwacht needed only a few laps to adapt—and then he broke the record. His new best: 28.95 seconds—two hundredths faster  ￼.

Zewenwacht, who previously had no competitive experience beyond rental karting, used the same kart—initially even with the same worn tires—and gradually improved. He slipped to 28.99 seconds before switching to fresh tires. By the third or fourth lap, he hit 28.95  ￼.

Despite outperforming an active Formula 1 driver, he kept things respectful:

“He can come back and try again,” he said gently, inviting Bearman to return for a rematch.","[""I've seen enough, put this man in the second red bull"", '>Unlike Bearman’s multi-day effort, Zewenwacht needed only a few laps to adapt—and then he broke the record.

He’s saying that he’s not humiliating George, because George is the one who made it public, and that George publicized it because he wanted the narrative to be “Merc respects me enough not to flirt without telling me first.” (Obviously, because the actual newsy part of that story is not “Merc is keeping George in the loop” but “there is something for Merc to keep George in the loop about”, this did not work.)\n\nAbsolutely loved Toto saying that Max and George would be a Prost-Senna lineup. We can only dream.', 'Interesting that Toto blames George for making the negotiations public. I get why George would want to create the narrative if it was going to come out anyway, but Max never said anything about negotiations of his own volition and I doubt Toto would have either. So he just increased the scrutiny on himself for no reason.\n\n>”I think he has now triggered the whole media avalanche. Sometimes I am naive but I try to be transparent with the drivers. I said to him: ‘I have the obligation of exploring what Max is going to do in the next two years’. He came out with it, wanting to show that ‘I am aware, nothing is behind my back, I’m alright with it’.”', ""“But obviously a Russell and Verstappen line-up? That’s Prost and Senna.”\n\n\n\n\nExactly what I've been saying for months and getting downvoted for. Wolff would ditch Antonelli not Russell.\xa0"", 'The reason I do respect Toto a lot is because of this:\n\n\n> “It’s about being in the quickest car and that’s what Max will do.""\n\n\nHe doesn\'t bullshit around, he\'s honest about that he wants to sign Verstappen, recognizes perfectly Verstappen\'s mindset, and that its upon him and Mercedes to provide a car Max wants to drive. The Verstappens, Toto and Mercedes have always been on good terms, and I think to this day Toto is regretting letting Red Bull snapping up young Max by putting him into the Torro Rosso. One can only dream of what would have been if they had signed him for Mercedes at the time.', ""I'd be pretty upset if I was Russell, he has done everything right, he should be the team leader, he has proven himself and is a consistent performer.. he's no Verstappen but he's a high level driver, and when his teammate struggles to not DNF he should not be the one at risk."", ""i think the most likely theory for Horner's depature is that the Thai side  have been wanting to sell for a while and tasked Horner with finding a loaded buyer, and if the sale went through, Horner would get a percentage stake as payment. Horner may have found an interested party and was slowly moving towards a deal but then the office scandal happened, so the Thais had no choice but to just side with Horner, but as the season progressed and the general slump of Red Bull performance probably gave the buying party cold feet so they backed out and thus Horner ended up getting the Red Bull treatment."", ""It was interesting Russell said he only notices it on media day. He seems to detach himself from all the noise when he's not on track, which is a skill 🤣.\xa0\nMaybe he's even a bit amused by the sh*storm he caused. I think he hadn't quite counted on it going so mental.\xa0\nThe funny thing is, everyone really already knew Toto was in touch with Max.\xa0"", 'Didn’t George do a similar thing when he went to merc (talk about it in the media)? I didn’t watch that season but I did hear something about it', 'Yeah if the Senna is Bruno', 'I think ""blames"" is a word with a strongly negative connotation and I did not read it like that but rather matter of factly.
