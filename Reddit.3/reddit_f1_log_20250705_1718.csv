2019 - 2021 - Giovinazzi - Spun out of his first race at Silverstone and caused a safety car which changed the course of the race. 

2015-2018 - Ericsson - Had two huge shunts in his time as Sauber's second driver. In 2018 he spun off at Abbey during the race and in 2016 he had a big incident in practice but was cleared to race after checks. 

2013-2014 - Gutierrez - During the 2014 British Grand Prix he had a collision with Maldonado at vale which damaged his suspension causing him to go straight on into the gravel and out of the race at abbey.

2012 - Kobayashi - Less of a crash but just as serious. Crashed into his pit lane crew requiring trips to hospital. Everyone was okay.

It would not make sense for Bottas or Alpine to take on another driver just for the sake of trying, but rather they need to find a better and more permanent solution for the second car. It goes without saying that Bottas is also looking further ahead.\n\n‚ÄòA short stint somewhere... does that help in any way? My main focus is entirely on 2026 and beyond, and what the best option is from there. What is the most interesting project, and of course I want to be competitive, that\'s what\'s most on my mind,‚Äô Bottas continues.\n\nHowever, the Finnish veteran does not rule out the possibility if a place in racing were to open up immediately. Admittedly, that is also part of the role of a reserve driver.\n\n""Yes, I\'m ready to jump into the car at any stage. It\'s not going anywhere, and I\'ve had a chance to test it. There will be more test days coming up this summer, so we\'ll be ready if the call comes, Bottas said.\n\nIn addition to Alpine, Bottas is being lined up for Cadillac, which is joining the F1 series next season and could use an experienced driver.\n\n*Translated with* [*DeepL.com*](https://www.deepl.com/?utm_campaign=product&utm_source=web_translator&utm_medium=web&utm_content=copy_free_translation) *(free version)*', 'If you were Bottas would you choose Alpine or Cadillac for 2026?', 'Negotiation is a pretty strong word here.

All these teams using Ferrari reduce their development cost. 

Red Bull is sharing development costs with Ford to collaborate on Red Bull's new engine (Red Bull shares history with Ford from its past Jaguar days). What are the chances in the future of American Haas switching to Ford/Red Bull engine, to help Red Bull lower their future development cost?

Or is Haas permanently wedded to Ferrari for engine, parts, and shared design/technical workings, even if Haas is often getting older generation Ferrari stuff. ","[""Haas actually have the option of buying current spec Ferrari parts, they just don't for reasons. Their engines *are* current spec but that's mandated by the rules nowadays.\n\nThey seem quite content with this arrangement and Ferrari is a much better proposition as an F1 engine provider than Red Bull-Ford in the near (and likely medium) term future, so I don't see them switching that way. Especially as Red Bull may not be so amenable to selling them parts the way Ferrari does right now, given they already have a similar arrangement with the junior team. Manufacturers don't exactly turn a profit on parts supply deals so there'd be very little benefit in it for Red Bull.\n\nToyota might be a more likely destination but if that ever happens, it's probably not happening until 2031 at the earliest when the next engine formula cycle comes to an end."", ""If Haas get any new engine, surely it's Toyota returning somehow?\n\nE:I know Toyota aren't signed up to develop an engine for the new regs, but I have no doubt F1 will bend over backwards to allow it to happen, and who better than the team they have their name on...."", ""> so there'd be very little benefit in it for Red Bull.\n\nI don't think Haas are likely to switch away from Ferrari, and if they do I would agree its likely to be to a future Toyota project if anything, but there are definitely benefits to Red Bull in supplying the engines to other teams.\n\nWhile they're not going to be turning a profit on it, the economy of scale is definitely a factor. Red Bull have said having 2 teams locked in for their new engine was a big part of what made the project make sense financially. Spreading the costs further across 6 engines rather than 4 would definitely be desirable for them.\n\nThere is also the benefit of the data from 6 engines rather than 4.
