1htcxty,[Motorsport IT] F1 | Ferrari: Fiorano and Barcelona to prepare Hamilton in red,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1htcxty/motorsport_it_f1_ferrari_fiorano_and_barcelona_to/,2025-01-04, News,,"['Finally the photoshops will stop.', ""**Translation:**\n\n  \n*The Scuderia has defined an ‚Äòelastic‚Äô test programme for Lewis's preparation after the FIA introduced stricter limits: from this year, the full-time drivers will be able to do a thousand kilometres in four days with the Previous Cars. Hamilton will be busy at Fiorano and then Barcelona. The dates are still up in the air depending on the weather.*\n\n  \nOne thousand kilometres in four days. That's how long Lewis Hamilton will have to get acclimatised with Ferrari's working system before the launch of the 2025 single-seater (19 February) and the tour de force that will follow, namely a filming day and the three days of collective testing in Bahrain.\n\nAt Maranello they have planned an ‚Äòelastic‚Äô test programme to ensure the best possible weather conditions considering the limitations of January. The aim is to secure test days in acceptable track conditions to complete the work that has been planned for some time.\n\nThe eagerly awaited debut of the seven-time world champion behind the wheel of a Ferrari (the choice is between the 2022 or 2023 single-seater) is scheduled to take place at the Fiorano circuit, a day that could vary (depending on weather conditions) from 20 to 21 January.\n\nAccording to information gathered by [Motorsport.com](http://Motorsport.com), the test programme will continue in the final days of January at the Barcelona circuit, with the hope of finding milder temperatures. In this case too, Ferrari has guaranteed themselves a window of several days (at least four) in order to postpone the test in the event of bad weather. A measure that has also become necessary because of the new regulations regarding TPC (Testing of Previous Cars) tests, i.e. tests with single-seaters used at least two seasons before the current one.\n\nLast 11 December, the FIA published a new version of the sporting regulations with several new features, including the paragraph regulating TPC tests. Paragraph ‚Äòg‚Äô of Article 10.2 introduces new limits: if a TPC test is carried out by a driver participating in the F1 World Championship, it will be subject to distance and duration constraints. A maximum mileage (in the calendar year) of 1,000 km has been introduced, which can be completed in a maximum of four different test days. For drivers not registred in the F1 world championship, the days are increased to twenty, with no mileage limit.\n\nIn Hamilton's case every lap will be precious, especially now that the kilometres have been capped. A tightening, the one introduced by the FIA, which came after the controversy raised last year by some teams following tests conducted within the rules but outside the spirit of the regulations.\n\nOne of the most commented cases was the test day organised in June last year by Red Bull at the Imola circuit, when Max Verstappen took to the track with the 2022 single-seater for some technical checks, going against the reasons for which the TPC tests were originally conceived, namely to offer an opportunity for drivers who need to familiarise themselves with driving a F1 car and with working methods.\n\nThe 1,000 kilometres allowed by the regulations give a driver the chance to acclimatise and familiarise himself with the working system, which is the case for Hamilton as it is for all drivers making their debut in a new team.\n\nLewis will have four days in which the team will try to make it as easy as possible for him to settle in, and then, from the first day of testing in Bahrain with the 2025 single-seater, we will start talking about performance.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'How many laps around Barcelona roughly is 1000km?', ' Cold conditions, SF-23 is perfect for that', '1000km in 4 days is, more or less, the same distance than 1 GP Race every day.\n\nSeems though, but hope everything goes OK for everyone', 'This is going to be so good.', 'This is going to be the best thing and nothing can convince me otherwise.', 'All the restrictions on testing are insane to me. Especially for rookies. Let the man drive as much as he wants in the F1-75.

1htf2ky,Why doesn't Rory Byrne get more fanfair?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1htf2ky/why_doesnt_rory_byrne_get_more_fanfair/,2025-01-04, Discussion,"He's listed as the Chief Designer most notably on both the F2002 and F2004, two of the most successful cars to date.

What's the story behind those great cars? Was it considered more of an ensemble effort with names like Brawn and Allison in the team?

Newey gets the lion's share of accolades when it comes to RBs and past figures like Murray and Chapman are held in high regard.

Some of these guys were just as talented as Newey in their areas of expertise, but circumstances didn't always favour them as much as they have with Newey.\n\nEDIT: Can't believe I also forgot Costa and Postlethwaite!
