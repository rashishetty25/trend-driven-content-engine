Being American might open up commercial opportunities, but it doesn't guarantee that a driver will be quick -- or, more importantly, that they can build the team up, which are the two qualities Cadillac need.\n\nThe three drivers Cadillac should be looking at are Bottas, Gasly and Russell. Bottas is the obvious choice because he's been sidelined. Gasly should be an easy pick because he's just being wasted at Alpine. Russell might be an outside shot at best, but if he's shown up by Antonelli, if Mercedes build another dud car, and/or if his relationship with Wolff deteriorates, then getting him would be a major coup.\n\nThe best combination would be Bottas and Gasly. If they can only get one and/or they're forced to take a rookie, then they should be looking at Dino Beganovic, who is a Ferrari Academy driver and impressed in the final rounds of Formula 2. It's only then that they should be considering Herta or Crawford against Beganovic."", 'Sergio: I am experienced and available', ""Crawford is terrible.

But the measurement here wasn't the car not being good enough, it's just that Zhou did bugger all in 3 years and was consistently slower than his team mate.

What has he done to be considered a better driver than Gasly/Ocon for example? Even the worst version of Hamilton is still better than current Piastri. \n\nData shows that most of the drivers reach their peak quali pace in their 2nd season and Piastri didn't show anything special.
