For people who had followed him in his first career knew he left too early, still capable of amazing drives. \n\nThe motorcycle accident definitely changed what he could do on a race track, there were some serious injuries, and one to the skull which generally results in a fatality. \n\nYet  the 40 year old improved every year till he retired again. In his final year he was faster than Rosberg in race pace and they were 10-10 in Quali. Rosberg in his prime against a 43 year old, who also got pole in Monaco.\n\nMichael in my opinion is in the top 3 of Grand Prix racing.

By 2009, my cable tv package no longer had the sports channel that broadcast F1. I remember being so excited hearing Schumi's come back, i switched to a more expensive cable package. His first test was in a GP2 car, he came within 4/10ths of the lap record sitting in a race car for the first time in over 3 yrs and in a machinery completely different to what he was used to. You could see he still had the pace between 2010 to 2012, but reliability issues, mid-grid positions prone to crashes and few unforced errors pretty much brought an end to his comeback. Ross Brawn would later credit Schumacher's feedback and work with the engineers are being the foundation for Mercedes championship success in 2014.\n\nWe now know both Williams and Mclaren tried signing Schumacher multiple times in the 90s and 2000s. It is anyones guess how many more titles he could have won had he jumped from one competitive team to another instead of toiling much of the 90s without titles at Ferrari.

1hkqm89,Women liking F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkqm89/women_liking_f1/,2024-12-23, Discussion,"so I'm a teen (f) and I've been watching F1 since I can remember. I literally grew up watching every race, my father being a hard-core fan. Hell I saw some of these ""big"" races, like I remember watching anxiously as Romain Grosjean spun off, the car catching fire and I even remember then the feed being cut off cause they did not want to show anymore incase he didn't make it out alive. 

Anyway, I've been a core ferrari fan all my life. It's not because of any one thing in particular and I don't support all of the teams decisions, but because it was a team my father once supported. I fell in love with RED and the emotions attached with the teams previous driver like R√§ikk√∂nen and Vettel. 

But now, it's become so insanely mainstream. Drive to survive has made it into this insanely big thing where there are so many people who now all of a sudden care about motorsport only cause the drivers look good. There's no issue with being a new fan, however my issue is that so many people talking only about the drivers looks invalidates the skill and people who care about the racing aspect, especially as a woman.
The moment you talk about F1 with men who don't know you, the first assumption is that we only watch the sport cause of the men. I had to mention the ferrari thing earlier now because it happens a lot more when you saw you're a ferrari fan.

Now, obviously certain men are the issue but it's genuinely becoming increasingly common to have a view point as such and I wanted to know of other women who watch F1 have experienced a similar outlook.

Disclaimer, I'm not talking about all men or only men but it's simply an observation.","[""For every gate there's a crappy keeper that wants to deem people not worthy. Never feel the need to prove your f1ness to some asshat. Enjoy whatever part or parts of the sport that you enjoy."", 'You have probably heard this a lot, so I hope it doesn‚Äôt come off as condescending, but I am a high school teacher so I deal with this a lot.\n\nTry your best not to feel like you need to explain the things you like. If you know you enjoy F1, or really anything, because it makes you happy then don‚Äôt feel bad if people judge you for something it‚Äôs not. People that are worth your time will come to realize that you love F1 for the racing, and those that don‚Äôt, just don‚Äôt waste your time worrying about them. \n\nI‚Äôm sure your dad knows that you like the racing, and your close friends probably do too. If some random schmuck thinks it‚Äôs cause you‚Äôre in love with Leclerc who cares? Like the things you like!', ""Guys were gatekeeping female fans wayyyyy before DTS. I've been watching since '95 or so and it was like that back then too. It used to bother me too, but I learned just ignore them. You don't have to be able to name the top 3 of every single Monaco race since the dawn of time to be a fan. You don't have to justify yourself to some insecure bozo. \n\nMy personal opinion is that people are free to enjoy a sport however they please. If they go for a driver for looks, that's their choice. It doesn't hinder my enjoyment of the sport in any way, so why should it bother me? I'm sure drivers don't mind: more money for them from merch and buzz.\n\n I'll save my annoyance for developments such as INSANE ticket pricing, or what races they put in (\\*cough\\* Qatar \\*cough\\*) or take out (German GP!), or Helmut Marko LOL"", ""I've made my peace with people/men assuming things about me as a female fan tbh.

You are really into F1?, wow, who's your favourite driver, do you like Lewis' fashions'  etc. However the response to men who are fans is more like 'its brilliant isnt it, did you see spa this year, what do think about Mclarens strategy in Monza'  etc resulting in a full blown F1 natter. \nPatronising yes, and a shame yes but I just smile and throw in a snippet of technical know how about the latest upgrades etc and wait for the inevitable shocked silences then remind myself there are far more important things to worry about in life.\nHave fun, enjoy it and remember theres a big crowd of us enjoying it with you irrespective of  gender üòä"", 'As a fellow woman and one who\'s been actively following F1 since 1986, my experience is that f you\'re a being of the female kind, members of the male kind will always look down on whatever interest you might have that is not traditionally seen as ""female"" or ""feminine"". They did when I was a child, they still do; actually, it\'s possibly worse now, because it\'s often young people saying that, while people my age and older (50 and over) will not question me on my love for F1. Whatever has kindled your interest in the sport is nobody\'s business but your own and even if you like drivers because you think they\'re cute/fine/excellent specimens of the species that\'s your business only and if some people believe that\'s your only interest in the sport, pity them. You\'re living and enjoying something you love while they point fingers and fight.\n\nIf I may, distinguish yourself from these creatures by studying the history of the sport, its regulations and how they changed, the technical rules and what advanced them and so on. And of course, there\'s the drivers, if you want.\n\n(Also, as an Italian... Why Ferrari? You\'re in for a lot of heartbreak, disappointments, byzantine statements that won\'t ever make sense to a non-Italian and only make us groan).\n\nHave fun!\\^\\^', 'Gatekeeping sucks.

Anything that teen girls like is always looked through a prism of frivolity, even and sometimes especially when it\'s something ""traditionally male"". Unfortunately, some people are determined to gatekeep no matter what, and it\'s not worth your time or energy to worry about what people like that think of you. Equally, people who do like F1 for the drivers\' looks are allowed to do so, and it\'s a valid way to consume it even if it\'s not your preference. There are plenty of things men are into because the women associated with it are hot!\n\nBut I\'d also encourage you to try to cultivate relationships with any boys you meet who don\'t automatically go down that route - I realized when I got to university that I\'d (in what was generally rational self-preservation) stopped engaging with boys entirely about sport. It took me ages to clock that some of the boys I met in university (who I later became friends with) weren\'t asking me about football because they wanted to ""test"" me or ""prove"" I wasn\'t a real fan, but because they were *actually interested in what I thought*. \n\nSo yes, keep an open mind, don\'t feel like you need to justify yourself to anyone, and just enjoy following the sport in whatever way you like. :-)', ""You don't have time for gate-keepers.
