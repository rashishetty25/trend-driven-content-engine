Regardless, Hadjar keeps getting my attention, even when he doesn‚Äôt get ultimate results, he is getting up there in individual qualifying sessions when tested and having solid performances in that Racing Bull both in qualifying and on the track as a rookie. He seems like he‚Äôs getting faster and certainly more consistent while wheel to wheel back in the field. 

Is Hadjar going to rise to the top? To me this is becoming a story without enough attention given the car. Could be promising. 

Maybe one of the underrated stories this season?","['I‚Äôve been really impressed with the way he‚Äôs bounced back from Australia.

They are really really well prepared now.\xa0\n\n\nI don't see much differences between Isack, Kimi, Ollie. They adapt-and-learn very quickly, are fast, use their brains, some small rookie mistakes time to time.\n\n\nAbout Isack his racing building was tough and sometime painful, with very modest background to start. I think it give him a bit of a edge, a huge, handled hunger easily noticeable."", ""Hadjar was probably the best driver in F2 last year. Had some bad luck that potentially cost him the title so it's no surprise to me that his pace has been impressive so far. If anything I was a bit worried about his temperament and being like Yuki was a few years ago, but he seems to have reigned it back some. Can't wait to see how this year's crop of rookies do"", ""So far he's looking super strong. He was racing Yuki on pace whilst they were team mates and has had the measure of Lawson so far.\xa0\n\n\nI think Yuki and his experience is the right choice for RB right now, but at the end of the year I think there is a real chance Hadjar could be a better option"", 'This is only his rookie year, he just needs time to settle into the team and get some miles under his seat.', ""He was pretty close to Yuki at the beginning of the year, considering he's a true rookie with very little testing of previous cars, and Yuki is a 5th year. Now, with their different experience accounted for, he's looking better than Lawson.\n\nAntonelli had an incredible more than 30 GPs worth of testing coming in. Bearman had 3 actual GPs + 1 sprint and a decent amount of previous car testing, Doohan had 1 GP and a decent amount of previous car testing, Lawson had 11 GPs + 4 sprints. Bortoleto and Hadjar each had just a few hours in the car each. \n\nHadjar definitely has impressed me a lot this season, and I already thought highly of him from watching him in F2 last year. I admit that I didn't really see it before last year, but it works like that sometimes. \n\nI think Red Bull was definitely gearing up for Arvid to be their next big thing, but Hadjar's definitely going to not let anyone look past him. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see him in Red Bull next year, for one reason or another. If Max leaves the team, or if they don't re-sign Yuki after Honda leaves, or if Yuki takes a seat elsewhere. I wouldn't even be completely shocked to see another driver swap this year."", ""Out of all the rookies, I'm most impressed with Hadjar considering the overall package he's in.  Its easy to suggest Kimi is doing to best when he's clearly been given the best opportunity out of all the rookies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHadjar is in a midfield car and constantly getting close to Q3 or into Q3.  More than anything during races the strategy has been screwing up Racing Bulls, not the drivers.  He absolutely has pace.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the future of F1 is Piastri v Antonelli.  Though, I do feel if he keeps this trend up I could see him in the RB seat in the not-so-distant future winning races.""]",3034,252,0.95,3034,7192,7192,13,2,0.0,13

It kills the best parts of racing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ke33lb/aheadattheapex_rule_needs_to_go_it_kills_the_best/,2025-05-03, Discussion,"You can see that the way Max races is starting to really proliferate through the grid now and I think it really puts a damper on the racing. In my opinion, you should be able to earn the right to some racing room on the outside and you shouldn't need to be ahead at the apex for it. The best racing I've had in many years of simracing, is when both parties give each other space in situations like Liam and Fernando in the sprint race today and many others recently.

I understand that this rule is one of very few possible ways of consistently stewarding and I also understand there is a difference in competitiveness between casual simracing and the pinnacle of motorsport , but I'd honestly rather have the inconsistencies from a few years ago back in exchange for giving the outside car more rights. **Ahead-at-the-apex should not give you 100% control of the corner**.","['I have a great idea\n\nTell the stewards that your allowed to tell drivers to give positions back', 'Both drivers should give room. Simple. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are side by side or ahead. No pushing someone off. The rule discourages back and forth racing that lasts multiple turns.', ""It's worth keeping in mind that the new clarifications put less emphasis on being ahead at the apex. It's now worded so that it's about how close the cars are going into the corner, not just apex.\n\nThis is to stop drivers lifting off the brakes and racing to the apex."", ""I think the rule is mainly used to put blame if something goes wrong. But its abused as 'I am first I can push you off' which is what needs to change."", 'I don\'t like the idea of ""my corner"" but at the same time without some level of regulation we\'d see people just divebomb and have contact most times in corners.  They should let them race more though', ""Good defending is making the attacker take an awkward line out of the corner because he needs to leave space. Especially with Lawson this morning, he quickly had a concrete wall forcing him onto the track, but Alonso did not have to leave any space so he didn't."", 'When Max was ""racing the way Max races"" was when you had to leave space for the car on the outside. That\'s gone now. Oscar is fully allowed to run the car on the outside out of room.', 'Agreed, but part of it is circuits are now being designed with this rule in mind. Street circuits, with lack of run-off and tight walls mean that the outside driver will always have to lift if squeezed, which typically means the stewarts will not penalize the inside car if no contact occurs. Maybe if they are consistent with it, it be better, but they are trying to minimize how much they penalize in general', 'Completely agree, it‚Äôs idiotic. It‚Äôs awful for racing that they have sanctioned forcing drivers off the track. Nobody is breaking the rules by doing it, but the rules are horrendous. \n\nAnd the whole needing to debate different bits of alongside, and whether they were ahead (by not braking for the apex at all) is not interesting.\n\nJust make them leave racing room. Disallow forcing drivers off, and we‚Äôll see good battles for a couple of corners, we‚Äôll see overtakes round the outside, it will be much better. \n\nIt‚Äôs the final blow to racing rules that have slowly degraded in quality over the years.']",167,112,0.7,167,108,108,27,11,0.0,27

Despite not knowing the track, he had the confidence to take more risks than usual.**\n\n> The second sprint qualifying session of the year ended with a massive sensation. A Mercedes is at the front. No, it\'s not George Russell. Andrea Kimi Antonelli surprised friend and foe with pole position for the sprint. The 18-year-old Italian is driving in Miami for just his sixth Grand Prix.\n\n> Antonelli only knew the 5.412-kilometer Miami Autodrome from the virtual world. ""I did 70 laps in the simulator during preparation,"" said the hairy-haired driver from Bologna, who now lives in San Marino. The start to his first Formula 1 season was promising. After five Grands Prix, Antonelli is in sixth place with 38 points. You couldn\'t expect more from a rookie.\n\n> The team had prepared its rookie well for the big adventure. ""The speed was always there, whether in karting or the junior series. We told him to take it easy this season, gain some mileage and experience. Kimi stuck to that and managed the risk well,"" praised team principal Toto Wolff in retrospect.\n\n> **Antonelli deliberately waits until the end.**\nBut with steadily improving results, his confidence grew, too. This paid off in Miami. Antonelli immediately fell in love with the track. The fact that he had never driven on it before dampened his expectations. And he now dared to take more risks.\n> In both SQ1 and SQ2, the prodigy qualified in the top five with exhilarating ease. This gave him the confidence to wait for a final attempt in the top ten. His much more experienced teammate, George Russell, insisted on going out on track right at the beginning, thus guaranteeing a clear path.\n\n> Russell underestimated that the track would accelerate again within five minutes. Mercedes also decided not to give Russell\'s Mercedes four laps of fuel, allowing them two attempts with two cool-down laps in between, like Max Verstappen. ""We thought the tires would only provide optimal grip on the first lap,"" apologized chief engineer Andrew Shovlin.\n\n> **Tire temperatures in the green zone.**\nWrong thought. Verstappen improved again on his second attempt. It wasn\'t enough for Antonelli. The Mercedes driver was two and a half tenths faster. Red Bull blamed it on the new engines that all Mercedes teams received in Miami. ""Max lost four tenths on the straights. He had an old engine,"" lamented motorsport director Helmut Marko.\n\n> Antonelli himself was surprised that he ended up at the top of the rankings. ""It felt like a good round. I could have maybe done a little better in a few areas. But I\'m happy that I was on the music in all three sectors.""\n\n> Wolff believes Antonelli can maintain the lead if he gets off to a good start. Even though Verstappen, Norris, and Piastri had better long runs in the first practice session, if Antonelli takes the lead, everyone behind him will have to swallow the turbulent air.\n\n> The tire drama from Jeddah will not be repeated. Mercedes deliberately sent Russell and Antonelli on longer runs of 16 and 13 laps in free practice to ensure tire temperatures didn\'t skyrocket again. The result was positive.', ""Ok it's a sprint pole guys let's not get too carried away"", 'I really hope he does well, the italian anthem is too beautiful to not be a regular haha', '""Miracle""?? üò≠', ""Mercedes was predicted to be fast here. Mercedes was fast here. George was on a stupid strategy in SQ3 that no one else was on for good reason.

Mercedes had him do more than 30GPs worth of testing of previous cars. They are probably why there is now a limit of the testing of previous cars now."", ""Let's get some perspective here: Its easy to be a child prodigy when your from an extremely wealthy and powerful family as Kimi Antonelli is. Powerful in the sense that Kimi's father owns multiple motorsports teams(some successful) and he has connections all over the F1/wider motorsports world. So Kimi already had one foot in the door from a very young age via his influential father.\n\n\nI mean there could be a poor working class lad whose even more talented and faster than Kimi(I guarantee there is), but you'll never see him in F1.
