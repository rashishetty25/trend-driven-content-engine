What kind of Team Principal would I have been if I'd have just let George go because Mercedes said, ‘we want George now’. That's not how it works, is it?\n\n“[George] was clearly upset and it was really difficult. It was very hard to stand my ground because if someone comes to me and they're upset, and it's because of me because I'm a blocker, it's really hard – but I had to put my team first.\n\n“As much as I would have loved to have made George's dreams come true, I couldn't at the time, and that was one of the hardest parts of being a Team Principal for me.

1khboa7,Rookie Drivers and a very small window of opportunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1khboa7/rookie_drivers_and_a_very_small_window_of/,2025-05-07, Discussion,"It feels like these rookie drivers are thrown into the deep end and expected to swim like Olympic champions from day one, doesn't it?

They've all dominated in feeder series like F2/F3 or even Formula E, but stepping into an F1 car is a whole different beast. Everything is on another level. They're suddenly racing against seasoned pros who've been honing their craft for years.

And the problem is, these rookies often aren't given much breathing room to actually learn and develop. If they don't deliver stellar results almost immediately, the knives start coming out. Teams are under immense pressure to perform, and unfortunately, young drivers can be seen as the easiest variable to change if things aren't going to plan.

It's a pretty cutthroat environment. One bad race, or even a couple of slightly off performances, and suddenly their seat is under threat. Where's the time for them to really understand the nuances of the car, figure out their driving style in this new machinery, and build confidence? It feels like they're constantly under the microscope, judged on every single lap.

You see flashes of brilliance, for sure. A stunning qualifying lap here, a gutsy overtake there. But consistency, the hallmark of a top F1 driver, takes time and experience. Maybe we need to rethink how we integrate these young talents, give them a longer leash, and acknowledge that becoming an F1 star isn't an overnight thing. It's a tough gig, and expecting instant perfection might just be setting them up for failure.","['Except not all rookies straight up dominate f3 or f2\n\nIf you are talking about Doohan, he didnt win neither f3 or f2, despite having multiple shots.\n\nAnd if he is unlucky, then what can Pourchaire, Drugo say?

Could shape out to be an interesting middle of the season especially with extra pressure on McLaren to essentially not screw up the advantage.', 'Mercedes must be gleeful regarding 2026 prospects, works team advantage, two really fast drivers, they are in drivers seat for both WDC&WCC', 'If Merc get a car that’s as good as McLaren’s I genuinely think George can claw back the thirty or so points between him and Piastri.\xa0\n\nI think Russell’s been the second best driver so far this year.\xa0\n\n[EDIT] Ok getting lots of interesting replies so this is a long edit.\xa0Wow I didn’t realise that lots of people rated Oscar’s season so far as high as they do and in some cases better than Max’s. I think Max has definitely been the best driver this year. Just look at the team mate gaps in Quali and race pace down the grid. Furthermore Verstappen has literally outqualified Piastri in half the races this year amd outraced him in a third of them. And that Red Bull is nowhere near McLaren.\nAnd I would also rate George and probably Leclerc over Piastri. But tbf the three of them are very tight imo.\n\nHere’s my “justification” for this.\n\nPiastri is on 131 points.\xa0\n\nIf Russell was in Piastri’s seat at McLaren these are the results I’d say he would’ve got.\n\nAustralia - P2, Lando was on it that race but George had solid pace throughout and didn’t spin off like Oscar did so easy P2.\n\nChina sprint - P2, Made a great opportunistic move on Leclerc irl. His Quali lap was decent enough it would’ve had him top three on the grid and then he probably would’ve just done what Oscar did irl.\n\nChina - P1, Yeah George was absolutely on it this race and would have beaten Lando similarly to Oscar.\xa0\n\nJapan - P3, His small mistake in Quali left him P5 irl. In the McLaren he’d have been ahead of Leclerc but wouldnt have been able to pass Max or Norris.\n\nBahrain - P1, He was on fire this race and I’d assume Lando still messes up Q3 so it’s pole and win for George.\n\nSaudi Arabia - P2, His Quali lap was actually really strong so it’s touch and go weather he would’ve beaten Max to pole. Either way he’d have taken the lead at the start but he was really bad on his tyres so he wound’nt have been able to do what Oscar did and even though overtaking was hard I’d guess he would have ended P2.\n\nMiami sprint - P2, he was decent in the sprint but not spectacular. All the other top cars ran into difficulties though and I doubt he was that bad that Hamilton would’ve beaten him.\xa0\n\nMiami - P1, Overall Norris would still get pushed off by Max on lap 1 and George would have found his way through after probably qualifying fourth or fifth. And he would’ve been the lead McLaren after lap 1 and thus won the race. Also his race pace was really strong so I don’t think Norris could’ve caught up.\n\nObviously it’s subjective but if that were what happened it would leave him on 140 points. Nine more than what Piastri has.', 'The title would better match Ferrari', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Mercedes has so far been reluctant to further develop the current Silver Arrow. However, the factory team has now announced a major upgrade offensive for the upcoming races.**\n\n> Mercedes is currently on track with second place in the team standings. The Silver Arrows have been significantly more competitive in the first six races of the season than last year. With four podium finishes for George Russell, the haul is impressive. Only the significant gap to market leader McLaren somewhat dampens the record.\n\n> But that\'s about to change. At the first six overseas Grands Prix, the engineers held back on upgrades. At the European season opener in Imola, Mercedes also wants to fully launch the development race. But that doesn\'t mean nothing has happened at the first races of the year.\n\n> ""We\'ve already made a few upgrades. They weren\'t particularly big or sexy, but there were always new things coming in,"" reveals technical director James Allison. The fact that Mercedes hasn\'t been mentioned much in the FIA\'s upgrade lists so far is also due to the calendar. ""We\'re already a quarter of the way through the season. The teams have been faced with many races in a row. It\'s quite difficult to make upgrades to the car when the races are flying around you like that.""\n\n> **Improvement with Imola upgrade?**\nBut that\'s about to change. After Miami, the engineers will have a two-week break to catch their breath. The European season opener traditionally also marks the start of the major development race. It\'s expected that most teams have something bigger planned for Imola. According to Allison, that\'s also the case with Mercedes.\n\n> ""In the next races, we\'ll be bringing new parts that are more visible from the outside. With a bit of luck, they should be able to improve our results."" The AMG W16 showed its strengths in the first few races, especially in qualifying. Over the race distance, however, the drivers struggled to maintain their good starting positions. McLaren, Red Bull, and Ferrari seem to be taking better care of their tires.\n\n> Allison is confident that Mercedes can improve in this area with the new parts: ""Hopefully, the upgrades we bring in the next two or three races will swing the pendulum a bit in our direction. We\'ll continue to try to work on tire temperatures in the race. That should help with the results as well.""\n\n> **New parts for Imola, Barcelona and Montreal.**\nThe second triple-header of the season, Imola, Monaco, and Barcelona, \u200b\u200bis now on the schedule. Allison doesn\'t believe the picture will change much compared to the first few races: ""We\'ve always been strong in qualifying so far, so we can expect to continue putting the car near the front of the grid. With a bit of luck, we\'ll even be a bit stronger here with the upgrades.""\n\n> However, the engineers\' focus is on improving race pace: ""We have to make sure that we can deliver on Sunday what we promise on Saturday. The most important thing is to control the temperatures in the tires and ensure that the car can show the pace it is capable of.""\n\n> However, further development is far from halted after the triple-header. Team boss Toto Wolff reveals: ""We have something planned for Imola, Barcelona, \u200b\u200band even Montreal."" Whether they can still catch up with McLaren is questionable, however. If the gap continues to grow, Mercedes will likely also discontinue development of the current model at some point. With the upcoming technological revolution just around the corner, 2026 presents a great opportunity to finally win a world championship title again.', 'They aren’t upgrades until they improve track time until then they are updates to the car that might or might not make the car faster', 'I want to see the impact of TD on FW to them.

Can't post screenshots because it just turns out black because of content protection, plus they flash, so that wouldn't prove anything. But if you have F1TV, here are the timestamps.

5:40 - 6:00 - We see a few cars go by without lights. I believe Pin, Palmowski, and Chambers

8:35 - 8:50 - Chong complaining on the radio that she can't see the car ahead because the visibility is so bad. Driver ahead based on grid order should be Anagnostiadis. No idea if she had her lights on or not, but see next example, as driver 2 ahead is Ciconte who doesn't appear to have her lights on.

13:00 - 13:20 After Felbermayr spins you can see who I believe is Ciconte continue down the road wihtout lights flashing.

Hard to believe that this wasn't reported right away. I could verify that the 3 frontrunners Pin, Palmowski, and Chambers turned on their lights later. But it shouldn't have happened in the first place. The team should have ensure the lights were turned on before they started the formation lap.
