1kwoziz,Barcelona is not a bad circuit.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kwoziz/barcelona_is_not_a_bad_circuit/,2025-05-27, Discussion,"I have seen a lot of people on here and elsewhere commenting that the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix will likely not be great for overtaking and that this track is one of the most boring on the calendar. 

And that was right. Before they got rid of the last chicane. Since then it has actually been one of the very best tracks for overtaking. 

And in 2022 there were 50, the tenth highest total of the season. 

In 2023 there were 65 overtakes, the fifth highest total of the season.

And in 2024 there were 55 overtakes, the second highest tally of the whole season! 

And it's not slam dunk DRS overtakes either. The battles usually go right into the braking zone and last year Russell vs Norris even went through the whole of sector 1 and most of sector 2! That battle lasted over half a lap! https://youtu.be/6OpfnQFgvkw?si=WWkd6bLYIzYiCvsr

You can also defend but still have fun battles. A perfect example of this is Russell vs Verstappen in 2022 
https://youtu.be/XtT9tNfdAlM?si=1gvNKihBynCRMDqX

Furthermore there is fairly high tyrewear at this track and both 2023 and 2024 were two stoppers. 2022 was a three stopper. 

So I think we should be optimistic about this race because since the removal of that last chicane it has been a great circuit for racing!

What do you think?

1kwprc0,[AMuS] Will the front wing be a game changer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kwprc0/amus_will_the_front_wing_be_a_game_changer/,2025-05-27, News,,"['Lmao, the only part about the new front wing is only in the title. The article is 99.9% about Monaco', 'Ferrari turnaround in Barcelona \n\nTranslation: \n\n> **Ferrari was further up front in Monaco than they had expected. Now, the team at Maranello is hoping that the new front wing rule will bring about a change in Barcelona.**\n\n> McLaren team principal Andrea Stella already knew it on Friday before the first practice session in Monaco. ""Ferrari is a contender for victory here."" At that point, his Ferrari colleague Frédéric Vasseur wouldn\'t have dared to make that statement. Especially not home driver Charles Leclerc: ""We thought Monte Carlo, with its slow corners, didn\'t suit us. Secretly, we hoped it would go like it did in 2021. We didn\'t have the best car then either, but we took pole position in Monte Carlo.""\n\n> After setting three fastest times in the free practice sessions, Ferrari\'s expectations increased. When Leclerc missed pole position by 0.111 seconds, Ferrari spoke of disappointment. ""When we came here, I thought a top-ten finish would be a challenge. Then we narrowly missed pole position and thus gave away the win. Compared to our original expectations, it was a good weekend. And yet, I\'m still annoyed not to have won.""\n\n> McLaren suddenly changed its tactics in Q3, setting two fast laps on its second attempt with a cool-down period in between. Ferrari opted not to, even though they\'ve recently performed better on used tires than on new ones.\n\n> Vasseur didn\'t see this as a decisive disadvantage in the battle for the fastest time: ""If you want to do something like that, you have to adjust your entire program from Friday onwards. We were considering the medium tire as an alternative. McLaren was simply very fast. They did 1:10.1 minutes on the first push lap. And that was with fuel for three laps on board.""\n\n> **Bumps and curbs help.**\nThe rule that the Ferrari SF-25 doesn\'t perform well in slow corners suddenly seemed to no longer apply. And Ferrari had nothing in its luggage other than a larger rear wing that would have explained the miraculous transformation.\n\n> Leclerc concluded: ""With one exception, Monte Carlo has only slow corners. This allowed us to focus entirely on that during the setup without having to accept many disadvantages in other areas.""\n\n> In fact, the Ferrari drivers only lost time between the Tabak curve and the Schwimmbad section. Last year\'s Monaco winner offered a second explanation: ""The track has a lot of bumps, and you have to go over the curbs a lot. Our car can handle that. Perhaps that compensated for our other weaknesses.""\n\n> **Other slow curves.**\nVasseur\'s statement on the supposed miracle was interesting: ""We don\'t fully understand it either. It could have something to do with the fact that the slow curves of Monte Carlo are different from the slow curves elsewhere. They are very slow.""\n\n> Even more crucially, due to the relatively low speed, Ferrari had little to worry about excessive wear on the crash barrier, allowing them to run at the ground clearance they considered ideal. ""We have less contact with the ground here. That also helps,"" admitted Vasseur.\n\n> The Frenchman admits that, despite the upturn in form in Monte Carlo, the team fell far short of expectations in the first third of the season. It looks as if Ferrari has fallen into the same trap it fell into in 2023. In an effort to address last year\'s weaknesses, the engineers overreacted and turned their old strengths into weaknesses. Now they\'re good in fast corners, but they gain less time there than in slow ones.\n\n> **McLaren with the ground clearance up.**\nMcLaren did better. The Papaya races lost their time in the slow sections in 2024. These are now the car\'s strengths, but without giving up much at the other end. While they\'re not as fast as Red Bull in the fast corners and not better than Ferrari, they\'re better overall. Stella offers a deeper insight: ""We can now run maximum downforce with a bit more ground clearance than last year."" With these cars, that translates to more mechanical grip.\n\n> The McLarens are generally better balanced than their rivals. The competition attributes this to the front wing, which flexes in such a way that the aero balance shifts from front to rear with increasing load. If stiffer front wings are now mandatory in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bMcLaren would lose the most, their rivals hope.\n\n> McLaren shrugs off the dreamers: ""We\'re not afraid of the new endurance tests. Nothing will change for us,"" promises Stella. His colleague Vasseur, on the other hand, believes: ""The new rule can be a game changer."" Vasseur\'s calculations are as follows: Ferrari was the most conservative in developing these flexible wings. Therefore, they also have the least to lose. Toto Wolff doesn\'t want to dismiss Vasseur\'s theory. ""Perhaps the Ferrari actually loses less than the other cars.""', 'It will fuck Ferrari over the most, somehow', ""the change is from 15mm of flex to 10mm, and considering McLaren haven't bought any major updates yet, I imagine they're gonna bring big ones here to mitigate any problems the changes will cause, but I really don't think 5mm of difference will hurt McLaren at all"", 'Expect no change!', ""Ok but what about an article about the Spain upgrade? Cause this article is *entirely* about Monaco. \n\nDon't bother clicking on it."", 'No', '[https://i.ibb.co/8D3ygPVG/me.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/8D3ygPVG/me.jpg)', 'I was waiting for the OP to post the second part of the article 🙃']",38,14,0.73,38,12,12,14,2,0.030000000000000027,14

This is a standard for oval racing, where you must maintain a minimum speed, and we have it in F1 for quali. Whether you do it as a set limit based on practice times, or a percentage of the current fastest lap, have it so if you lap below a set pace then you\'re black flagged on safety grounds. This would stop the sandbagging that dogs the race. \n* A hot lap competition with Indy 500 quali rules and points down to 20th. Set a three hour block, and you can put your name in to be next on track to set a flying lap. You either join the back of the queue and can keep your existing time, or if you want to jump to the front you lose it. If you hit the barrier and damage your car, you lose your time. It\'d keep drivers pushing, which is where Monaco comes alive. \n* Make it a NASCAR stage race, bringing out the safety car and doing a standing restart after 25 and 50 laps. Add in a mandated green flag pitstop (that has to be taken after X laps) to stop people just changing rubber under caution. Close the field back up. \n\nMonaco is not a normal grand prix track, and so I don\'t know why we want it to host a normal grand prix in the modern era.
