1k5gu1b,Is Oscar Piastri's decision to snub Alpine for McLaren in 2022 one of the smartest career moves in F1 history?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k5gu1b/is_oscar_piastris_decision_to_snub_alpine_for/,2025-04-22, Discussion,"Aside from the obvious example of Hamilton’s gamble to join Mercedes, are there many career decisions in F1 that have worked out better than Piastri’s choice to ditch Alpine for McLaren?

Back in early July 2022, while still an Alpine reserve driver, it was already speculated that Piastri had signed a deal with McLaren — even though at the time, McLaren were behind Alpine in terms of car performance.

When Alonso made his shock move to Aston Martin, many expected Piastri to step up and partner Ocon at Alpine. Instead, he stuck with his McLaren move — a decision that completely altered his career path for the better. Rather than scrapping for the odd points finish at Alpine, Piastri now finds himself a championship contender in just his third F1 season.

For some perspective:

Points since Piastri joined F1:

Oscar Piastri — 488

Alpine F1 Team — 190

And just for fun: if Piastri had gone to Alpine as originally planned, who do you reckon would be Lando Norris’s teammate right now? I’d guess Gasly.","['Certainly, although Hamilton joining Mercedes in a shock move is probably better.', 'Lewis to Mercedes netted him 6 WDC. \n\nSchumacher to Ferrari netted him 5 WDC. \n\nNeither team on top when they moved. \n\nKimi to Lotus on a £50k per point contract is worth a mention too, if for different reasons.', ""Piastri obviously made the right call but he definitely didn't snub Alpine. It seems Alpine's propaganda is hard to fight.\n\nHe never had a seat at Alpine. By the time they came calling, he was already committed to McLaren.\n\nAlpine ran a smear campaign and Piastri couldn't fight back because his deal with McLaren wasn't public yet, but Alpine certainly knew about it."", 'I think the only better move I can think of to date was Hamilton to Mercedes in 2013, possibly Schumacher to Ferrari in 1996 but that took a few years to show championship level results', ""Also, Mark Webber's biggest achievement in F1."", ""Not really, it was a common sense move because at the time the deal was made it was a guaranteed seat vs a potential seat at one of either Alpine or Williams.\n\nIt's similar to the Verstappen situation where he was being courted by everyone, but only Red Bull had an F1 drive to give him immediately.

They had great pace when they were in clean air as shown last race. Since this article is based and focused on what happened last race, where Ferrari had good racepace, it\'s obvious what they meant with the title.\n\nI know it\'s hard for some people, but read the article first and not just the title. The amount of people who can\'t read properly around here is astonishing', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> **The Saudi Arabian GP showed that if you drive in clean air, you can beat faster cars. That\'s why the battle was so fierce in Turn 1. And that\'s why the timing of the pit stops was all about finding the golden opportunity.**\n\n> The McLaren is a faster car than the Red Bull. And it treats its tires more gently. Nevertheless, Max Verstappen pulled away from his tail, Oscar Piastri, at the end of the first stint. The Ferrari is a slower car than the McLaren, Red Bull, and Mercedes. Nevertheless, Charles Leclerc occasionally set faster lap times than Verstappen and Piastri.\n\n> The secret lies in the position on the track. Those at the front of a pack benefit in two ways. They drive in clean air. This allows the aerodynamics to work optimally. According to the engineers, this is a bonus of at least two-tenths of a second. Those with other cars in front of them experience a worse airflow. The car begins to slide, the tires heat up, and lose grip more quickly.\n\n> Good cars can afford to stay behind for longer than bad ones. But even they get caught up eventually. For 15 laps, Oscar Piastri stayed within Max Verstappen\'s DRS zone. Then the leader took three-tenths of a second per lap off his pursuer. In the second stint, Piastri enjoyed the luxury of a clear run. Until he gradually closed the gap on his teammate, who was driving countercyclically on hard tires. At a distance of 2.5 seconds, Piastri suddenly felt understeer. By then, he was already driving in the turbulent air of Lando Norris.\n\n> **A Grand Prix with two races.**\nIn the fourth year of the ground-effect era, aerodynamics have practically reached their limits. Even small disturbances in the airflow can have major consequences. Therefore, it\'s more important than ever to avoid any cars in front of you. This makes the starting grid, the start, and the timing of pit stops even more important than ever.\n\n> In four of the five Grands Prix, the driver who had the lead after the first corner won the race. That would likely have been the case in Jeddah as well, had Verstappen not received a five-second penalty for defending his position at the start by cutting the first chicane.\n\n> So it was a two-race Grand Prix. Verstappen dominated the first, and Piastri dominated the second. The world champion reduced a 4.8-second deficit to 2.8 seconds, but Piastri only drove as fast as he had to. On the very last lap, he showed his pursuer who was boss in the ring with his personal fastest lap.\n\n> **Lots of risk in the first corner.**\nVerstappen and Piastri knew the first corner would be decisive. Therefore, both took high risks at the braking point. Verstappen\'s was greater because, according to overtaking regulations, the driver on the outside lane is always at a disadvantage. He needs a half-car-length lead at the apex to make the corner his own. For the driver on the inside, the same height is sufficient.\n\n> Overtaking was difficult despite three DRS zones. There were 32 position changes due to differing strategies. Those who didn\'t manage it right away damaged their tires. That\'s why it was so important for Piastri to overtake Lewis Hamilton as quickly as possible after his pit stop. He risked it in the DRS zone, weaving at high speed.\n\n> Drivers stuck in a pack have to drive tactically. It\'s better to leave a three-second gap and only open up at the end of the stint. When timing pit stops, it\'s becoming increasingly important for teams to find gaps in the field to make an undercut or overcut effective. Esteban Ocon gained six positions with his early pit stop in Bahrain, because he had a ten-second gap to the car in front where he fell.\n\n\n> **Overcut gives Leclerc a clear path.**\nIn Jeddah, Ferrari did everything right with the overcut of Charles Leclerc. The fifth-placed driver in the World Championship was within two to three seconds of George Russell in the first stint. Nevertheless, he complained of slight understeer caused by the turbulent air emanating from the Mercedes in front of him.\n\n> When all the drivers ahead of the Ferrari had turned into the pits, Leclerc was in the lead. And he suddenly set lap times that astonished both friend and foe. Leclerc, on ancient medium tires, was getting faster instead of slower. Between laps 21 and 28, he improved from 1:33.9 to 1:33.3. His new pursuers on fresh hard tires were barely faster. Leclerc held on until lap 29, creating a tire gap of ten laps to Piastri, nine to Russell, and eight to Verstappen.\n\n> More importantly, Leclerc had eight laps of clear air before entering George Russell\'s DRS zone. By then, the Mercedes driver had already hit the wall. He had overtaxed his tires while trying to follow the leaders. The front tires became so hot that they blistered. This made Russell easy prey for Leclerc and Norris.\n\n> **Hamilton weak, despite clear driving.**\nRussell couldn\'t even complain about traffic that caused his tires to give out so dramatically. ""The speed in the race was higher than we expected. And we set up the setup a bit too front-heavy,"" the strategists explained.\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli also struggled with hot tires, but to a lesser extent than Russell. In the second stint, the Italian benefited from having the track to himself from the 30th lap onwards. The previous duel with Isack Hadjar had cost rubber, but Antonelli then used the quiet period to give his tires a rest. It paid off. When Hamilton closed in from behind, he had an answer. There was still life in his tires.\n\n> The fifth round of the World Championship was also a sobering experience for Lewis Hamilton. The record winner was on his own for large stretches of the race and yet failed to benefit. He was simply too slow. His personal fastest lap placed him only in seventh place. Given the good conditions, he should have achieved more.\n\n> The Williams drivers were also well positioned in the field from their pit stop. Carlos Sainz and Alexander Albon only had to briefly contend with Esteban Ocon, who had already switched to hard tires during the safety car period. After that, the Williams drivers were able to build up speed unhindered, aiming to get into Isack Hadjar\'s pit stop window. They succeeded. After his late stop on lap 34, Hadjar was up against two Williams cars and was left with a hopeless battle, as one was giving the other DRS.\n\n> **Safety car as friend and foe.**\nLando Norris and Isaac Hadjar proved that bucking the trend and starting with harder tires was a good decision. This automatically brought them into clear air at some point. Norris had clear air for 32 laps, Hadjar for 21.\n\n> Had Norris not been outsmarted twice by Hamilton\'s DRS on the home straight, he would have had more time in reserve later in the duel with Leclerc. Hadjar frustrated Albon twice. In the first stint, he drove six laps into the Williams\' gearbox, and in the second, twelve. Neither of these actions was good for the tires.\n\n> Anyone who tries to gain a clear path with a different tire sequence is playing with fire. You can either hit the bull\'s eye or pull a blank. Ferrari tried it in Bahrain and was cheated by the safety car. From Ferrari\'s perspective, it came too early. Norris, Hadjar, Stroll, and Hülkenberg would have preferred a safety car after lap 23 in Jeddah. That would have given them a free pit stop.', 'This may be the least funny thread in the history of Reddit so far.', 'Dirty air really that bad this season?', ""Like Fred said, F1 is becoming a qualifying world championship, Max was the only pole sitter to lose across the last 5 (6 with the sprint) races they've had, and he only lost because of the T1 incident and penalty."", ""Clean air is king sure, but Charles (granted much fresher tyres) was still able to push along nicely even when in the dirty air of others.

He should have braked sooner in order to make the corner, which meant he had to slot in behind Piastri. That’s what’s dictated by both the rules and physics.
