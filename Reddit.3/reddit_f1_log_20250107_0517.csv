For the last 3 big rule changes there have only been 3 teams that stood any chance of competing for wins because of the disparity in expenses, workforce and facilities. Heading into 2026 we could have as many as 7 teams competing on (somewhat) similar footing in terms of budget, workforce and facilities and as such any of them have a chance to be competitive if they get the regulation change right.\n\nIn terms of a backmarker being competitive (for wins), If you consider Alpine or Williams a backmarker based on this years performance then maybe.
