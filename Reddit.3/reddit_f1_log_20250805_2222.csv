1mibr2x,Is Bortoleto the best rookie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mibr2x/is_bortoleto_the_best_rookie/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"In my opinion, what he’s been doing in a Sauber shows much more talent than all the other rookies this year. Since the start of the season, I already thought the best ones would be him—because he won the Formula 3 and Formula 2 titles in his rookie seasons—and Antonelli.

1miae1n,Bunch of facts about both Championships while coming into Summer break,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1miae1n/bunch_of_facts_about_both_championships_while/,2025-08-05, Statistics,"There is 274 points left in 2025 World Drivers' Championship (10 Grand Prix's and 3 Spirnts)

This means that Oliver Bearman, Franco Colapinto and Jack Doohan are officialy out of contention for this title.

Yuki Tsunoda is last driver eligible for the Championship as he currently has 10 points, while Oscar Piastri has 284, Tsunoda would win because he would have 10 wins compared to Piastri's 6 so far.

Oscar Piastri will not Max Verstappen's 2023 record of 575 points scored by a single driver as he can only get to 558 points if he would be flawless after the break.

Now some facts about World Constructor's Championship.

475 is the most points a team can get from last 10 Race Weekends.

This means that bottom 6 cannot win this year as Williams could only get to 545 points, which is 14 less than McLaren's current tally.

McLaren can miss out on only 34 points until the season ends if they want to be first team to get 1000 points, if they win it all they will earn 1034 in a single season.

This means they can only lose 3 races and all 3 sprints as they would lose 33 points that way.

The earliest possible race in which McLaren can win Constructor Championship is...

Azerbeijan

If McLaren has 3 more 1-2s and Ferrari would finish 3-4 that would put McLaren at 688 points and Ferrari at 341 (347 points gap). In remaining 7 Race Weeks there would be 346 ! points left so Ferrari could finish just 1 point behind McLaren.

1mi8moa,Driving Styles Compared: Hamilton’s Rear vs Max’s Front Bias,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mi8moa/driving_styles_compared_hamiltons_rear_vs_maxs/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"Everyone keeps talking about how Max Verstappen prefer a very strong front end so extreme that most of his teammates fail to extract competitive performance of the same car.

Lewis Hamilton is on the opposite side preferring a stable rear, but how does it actually look like?

From the moment Lewis Hamilton started karting, his father would stand next to the track and move further where his rivals would typically brake forcing Lewis to [mold his style of late braking](https://youtu.be/MOtvpi1aM-I).

Lewis tries to brake as late as possible often braking and turning at the same time and is also aggressive at corner entry. This usually results in the rear sliding mid corner and Lewis has to open up his steering to correct.
You can see this style clearly on his older onboard with the McLaren at [Turn 2](https://youtu.be/FJQ4QyJNuA8?t=22), and [Turn 13](https://youtu.be/FJQ4QyJNuA8?t=72).

The Mercedes Lewis dominated with had insane rear grip where he could throw the around car and it looks like it is glued on the track [1](https://youtu.be/rh6vBU-YNK0?t=19), [2](https://youtu.be/rh6vBU-YNK0?t=63), [3](https://youtu.be/SP3882i0H-0?t=28), [4](https://youtu.be/SP3882i0H-0?t=74).

Verstappen on the other hand prefers a very strong front end. Verstappen is not a late braker like Hamilton and he is conservative on corner entry. He prefers to do most of the car rotation mid corner [1](https://youtu.be/uvlHBDD2R2M?t=19), [2](https://youtu.be/uvlHBDD2R2M?t=64). 

More detailed explanation:[1](https://youtu.be/mS_IM7p4l18?t=42), [2](https://youtu.be/v0_da8T5wxc)","['Max’s steering input look much smoother than lewis’s. Can anyone explain why?

In both situations Lewis had to correct and lost time.\xa0\n\n\nI don't see how this is representative of his driving style, Lewis is one of the fastest F1\xa0drivers of all time and showing 2 examples in which he lost time doesn't really show that."", ""By the way, 'often braking and turning at the same time' is something that basically every race car driver in the world does. Its possibly the single most essential aspect of going fast. Although I get what you mean here, in that Lewis relies on it a bit more than others."", ""The guy you've linked in the detailed explanations at the end, does he have any credibility or relevant experience? I've seen him popping up on social feeds and I'm not sure I agree with a lot of what he says. He's often talking about idealised lines and being off them as a negative, despite as far as I can tell he's never actually driven anything close to an F1 car? More so that he has no idea of any of the current setups he's critiquing so how could he possible comment on what is the ideal line for a given car. \n\nHappy to be proven wrong if he has a long list storied past I'm unaware of."", ""I don't know why you think Hamilton like a stable rear.

If you watch the video he did with the Chris Harris he says that; he doesn't like the current F1 driving style but it's what he needs to do, he needs to adapt to the car.\n\nClearly Red Bull have made a decision on what makes their car quick from a design perspective. Max has the adaptability to mould his style to what is required."", ""I'd love to see how Verstappen goes in a Rally1 car since he likes these oversteery setups. Two time WRC champion Kalle Rovanperä tested a Red Bull F1 car, surely Max could test a GR Yaris Rally1, or a Puma Rally1 given the Ford-Red Bull partnership. (Ocon recently drove a Yaris Rally1 with Takamoto Katsuta at Goodwood, I imagine made possible by the Haas-Toyota Gazoo Racing partnership)"", '> Lewis tries to brake as late as possible often braking and turning at the same time\n\nI’m at work and can’t watch the videos, but every driver does this. It’s called trail braking, and even low-level amateur drivers do this. Not to be rude, but this is like Racing 101, and it really ruins your credibility if you don’t know absolute basics like this.\n\nI also think this whole analysis is a little flawed because Max has talked about how he approaches every car differently. Some cars require different lines than others, even within the same series. Max uses his extreme oversteer setups in the current Red Bull because that’s what’s needed to get the most performance out of it, not because he likes it.', 'What I have seen, Hamilton, Riccardo and Vettel, all three brakes really late into the corners, they are some of the best late brakers and that style demands stable rear end whereas Max takes it smoother with early breaking, which helps him easily overtake or undercut drivers within 0.1s gap.... but with rear stable end and low downforce, this thing is quite difficult to achieve. \n\nThats why Riccardo failed badly in this regulation, these high downforce cars just dont like late braking... Hamilton tried to change his technique in this regulation but still he cant seem to perfect it like before..\n\n2026 cars have low downforce which can sure help Hamilton but I would love to see Max adapt to it again like he was in 2017-21 era...\n\nalso rookies gonna struggle real bad with low downforce cars... imo, low downforce is a proper test of skills on corners where slight mistake can lead to a crash.']",204,88,0.91,204,82,82,2,1,0.0,2
1mier4k,"If the rumors about plank wear are true, why is Ferrari setup this weekend be treated as ""disaster""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mier4k/if_the_rumors_about_plank_wear_are_true_why_is/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"First of all, I think everyone agrees that lower rider height gives you more car performance, therefore Ferrari is faster than they should be in qualifying.

In Q3, P1 - P6 only separated by 0.126s, assuming the ""lower rider height"" gains them 2 tenths, Leclerc on paper should only qualified P6 behind both Aston Martin, which means he will be stucked behind Alonso. If it's 3-4 tenths difference, Leclerc will qualify P8 which makes it worse. (Even if it's only 1 tenth gain, he qualifies P4, which he will eventually finish P4, exactly the same.)

From what we saw how the race goes, it's impossible to overtake Alonso if you are not McLaren, especially if Leclerc doesn't have that ""2-tenth"" advantage by lowering ride height. Given Ferrari's race strategy, they will probably choose a 2-stop behind the DRS train like Max did and get somewhere below P8 or even out of the points.

But with this ""plank gambling"", they got P4 eventually, has a shot to go for podium or even win (if there are some SC or VSC to keep the plank healthy so that they don't need more tyre pressure in the final stint).

""Hungaroring is just Monaco without walls."" Yes, the gambling didn't pay off this time because there is no SC / VSC, but they lost nothing (in terms of race result) and has everything to gain potentially by doing so. That's how teams play the rule if they don't have the best car.

1mhyrn9,How do this season's constructors compare now that we're half way through?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mhyrn9/how_do_this_seasons_constructors_compare_now_that/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"Obviously McLaren have the best car this year, but it seems so hard to judge outside of that. The Aston Martin seemed like a tractor and then suddenly had both in the top 7. The Red Bull appears to (have) been capable of winning races for the first third of the season, while the second car can't get inside the top 15. The Merc also seemed competitive for the first third of the season.

The RB has been consistently able to be just inside the top 10 with three different drivers. The Sauber is a tractor that both of its driver's have been able to drive into the top 6. The Ferrari seems all over the show, the only vehicle that seems consistently shit is the Alpine, but even then Gasly has had it inside the top 10 a few times. 

So, given all that, how are we ranking them? I guess taking an average across the first half of the season I'd say:

1. McLaren 

2. Mercedes? This felt like an easy pick up until the last three races

3. Ferrari? Again, so all-over the place that it's hard to assess this car

4. Red Bull - It has been competitive at times in the hands of a generational talent, but worst on the grid while Yuki/LL have been piloting

5. Aston Martin - Stroll has been in and out of the points all season in the AM, and lately Alonso has been accumulating even more points than Stroll in it. Hungary in particular it was strong

6. Racing Bull - Doesn't have the pace to compete at the top, but is reliable and has been consistently in the 8-12 placings

7. Williams? - Has shown the ability to have pace, but has also been inconsistent despite having two very good drivers

8. Sauber? - Everyone labels it a tractor, but it has been on the podium and has scored points under both drivers

9. Haas - Seems harsh as it has scored points under both drivers hands too

10. Alpine - Gasly has regularly taken it into the points, but both second drivers have struggled to drive it out of the bottom quarter.

  
What are your feelings/rankings so far, I'm interested to see and have something to talk about while I wait for the Netherlands :)","['Tie between Mercedes and Ferrari as there have been races where one has been clearly better than the other.\n\nAnd I would order the middle and lower class of the grid like this: Williams, Aston Martin, Sauber, Haas, Racing Bulls & Alpine', 'Consistently, RB over Aston Martin', 'All teams are very close together overall, especially compared to the past. \n\nWhen it was normal that we saw some cars lapped multiple times and most cars lapped at least once, tier list of the constructors was easy. \n\nNow we have a double situation:\n\nAll teams are relatively close together, we have qualifyings where almost all cars are within 1s during Q1. And we super sensitive tyres that change their performance with just a change of the ambient temperature by few degrees kelvin. \n\nSuddenly Mercedes is the fastest car in Canada, only to go for a spell of mediocre results for Russell and terrible results for Antonelli. Suddenly the Williams finds itself nowhere, only to be somewhere the next race.

They’ve both taken turns being the second or third fastest team, occasionally slipping to fourth if Ferrari shows up. But on average, I’d give Merc the edge.\n\nRed Bull – Pretty much the same story as Merc. I know there’s probably a case for putting them fourth and I get that. I think that argument mainly comes from the gap between Max and Yuki. But like I said earlier, I’m judging based on what the car is capable of, so I’m giving weight to the fastest driver.\n\nFerrari – Similar vibes. Flashes of performance, but just not consistent enough to crack the top three. They've been better in the last couple of races though. So, that could very well change.\n\nWilliams – Reliability’s been a pain, but in terms of raw pace, I think they’ve been ahead of the rest below them.\n\nRacing Bulls – Quietly solid. They've been around the points more often than not, and haven’t had the wild ups and downs that Haas or Sauber have.\n\nAston Martin – They started the season off terribly, but they’ve finally begun to find some form. Curious to see if they keep climbing.\n\nHaas – Bit of a toss-up between them and Sauber, could go either way.\n\nSauber – They’re picking up lately, which is nice to see.
