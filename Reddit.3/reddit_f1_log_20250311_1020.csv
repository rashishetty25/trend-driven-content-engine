1j7w9un,[AMuS] Silver Arrow loses test race clearly,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j7w9un/amus_silver_arrow_loses_test_race_clearly/,2025-03-10, News,Translation in comments. ,"['I never trust Mercedes in pre-season', ""Last season, weather conditions influenced the cars' behaviour a lot. We'll see this year, but I wouldn't take the Bahrain testing results as a gospel of truth"", '> Mercedes analyzed the data from the test drives in Bahrain. The engineers found that the McLaren was significantly faster. But not all questions have been answered yet.\n\n> The Groundeffect era has not gone according to plan for Mercedes so far. With the introduction of the current regulations in 2022, the great series of successes ended after eight constructors\' cups in a row. For three years, the factory team searched in vain for a way back to success. George Russell and Lewis Hamilton did manage four victories last season. In the team standings, however, they were defeated by McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull by a relatively clear margin.\n\n> With the new AMG W16, they finally want to attack at the front again. The car has some aggressive changes - for example, the sidepods have ultra-narrow air intakes. On the front suspension, the track rod has been placed behind the wishbone, as was the case with McLaren last year. To do this, the engineers tested two new noses in Bahrain, which were used alternately. However, the team kept a secret how the two variants affect the handling and which nose will be used in Melbourne.\n\n> In general, the technicians drew a positive conclusion after the three days of testing. There were no concerns about reliability. The new W16 rolled around the desert circuit like clockwork. Only in the last morning session did the Silver Arrow suffer a small hiccup. A battery change meant that almost an hour was lost in the pits. Afterwards, it turned out that the change had not been necessary at all. A small electrical gremlin had led to an error message.\n\n> Otherwise, the engineers carried out the planned program almost completely. Because Mercedes did not hold the usual shakedown in Silverstone this year, it was not necessarily expected that the W16 would even secure the weekly best in the distance classification with 458 laps - just ahead of Haas (457) and Toro Rosso (456).\n\n> Expectations were also basically met in terms of performance. The data collected on the track corresponded to the values \u200b\u200bpreviously calculated in the simulations. The feedback from both drivers was accordingly positive. The engineers also expressed cautious optimism that the new W16 would no longer show the major fluctuations in form of its predecessor, which, depending on the conditions, sometimes drove all opponents into the ground and then lagged hopelessly behind again.\n\n> ""The team worked hard over the winter to improve the weaknesses of the W15. Judging by the first signs, we seem to have made good progress in these areas,"" said chief engineer Andrew Shovlin with satisfaction. In Bahrain, the drivers could not see any major outliers either up or down. The working window seems to have become larger, and the handling a little more stable. However, the temperature fluctuations on the three days in Bahrain were more moderate. It was never as cold as it was in Las Vegas last year or as hot as it was in Budapest. So it is still too early to give the all-clear.\n\n> But even if the internal performance targets have been achieved, that doesn\'t automatically mean that the new Silver Arrow is a World Championship candidate again. Formula 1 is a relative business. If the others develop even better, your own progress is of little use. In this case, McLaren seems to have pulled well ahead of its direct competitors. The Mercedes engineers were shocked to discover that the gap on the long runs was between half a second and a whole second.\n\n> In a direct comparison of the race simulations, George Russell would have finished 20 seconds behind Oscar Piastri, who was driving parallel on the final day. Andrea Kimi Antonelli shared the track with Lando Norris in his test race on the second day. In the end, he was half a minute behind. These are worlds of difference in Formula 1 that are not easy to make up.\n\n> It is only a small consolation that Mercedes was able to keep up with Ferrari and Red Bull in the chasing pack. All three teams hope that the changeable and sometimes very windy conditions in Bahrain were not representative and that the gap will automatically be reduced somewhat.\n\n> Ferrari also used the excuse that the SF-25 was carrying a lot of excess weight because of the many sensors. At Red Bull, the setup was not yet right. In addition, Max Verstappen did not use a comparable racing simulation. So there is still some room for improvement here.\n\n> Mercedes also did not appear to have a perfect set-up during its long runs. The engineers\' aim during the test drives was not to adapt the car to the Bahrain track as best as possible, but to try out as many settings as possible with a view to the rest of the season. In order to gain experience, they also went in extreme setup directions, which did not always lead to a positive result. The question is how close McLaren was to the ideal performance. The pursuers should not assume that the papaya racer has already reached its best form.', 'The only certainty is that McLaren are the quickest. My how much? Not certain. Who’s behind them? Even less certain. \n\nCan’t help feel the cool temperatures flatter Merc. When that was in play last season they were outright quickest. Otherwise they were 4th at best.', "">The data collected on the track corresponded to the values \u200b\u200bpreviously calculated in the simulations\n\nReal world data finally correlating to the simulations is Mercedes' version of Next Year"", 'His big a lead do we think Lando could build by the time the flexi regulation changes hit?\n\nCould be like last season but with max and co chasing Lando’s early lead down?', ""Didn't everybody think McLaren was doomed after testing last year?"", ""It was never realistic to expect them to fight the top 3 even with alot of positive changes. It's been a recurring theme now over the last 3 seasons that Merc don't know why their car isn't up there, and when it is up there, they don't know why it is up there. Like they know the 2024. car liked cold weather, but why exactly did it like cold weather so much it was useless without it remains a mystery and it seems like it's still the case for this year's car.\n\nThough it would be idiotic to take testing times for granted, or even other team's statements. Everyone likes to play underdog, everyone kind of writing off Ferrari already and saying it's McLaren's championship to lose, but Ferrari haven't really commented on the matter, just said it's all going in the right direction on all fronts.

1j7ztsj,Enough about the best drivers to never win a championship...

Some may say Stirling Moss, others say Ronnie Peterson. But that's not what I wanted to talk about today.

I wanna ask you, who do you think is/was the best team to never win the world constructors championship?

Was it BAR who came 2nd in 2004 and to this day hold the record for the most podiums without a win as a constructor?

Or was it BMW Sauber who looked genuinely competitive at the beginning of 2008 but really dropped the ball in 2009 and then pulled out?

Was it Jordan who had a shot at the 1999 title despite their funding being far off the one from Ferrari and McLaren?

Was it Ligier who came home in 3rd and 2nd in 1979 and 1980 respectively?

The Bolognese pilot will thus complete its road to F1 reaching what she wanted to identify as a starting point rather than arrival. Despite this, the emotional component can only be intense on the eve of his first weekend in F1. Antonelli has already performed well with the W16 in Bahrain tests in terms of feeling with the car, but in a long interview released to the Sky Sport microphones he told how only by crossing the gates of the Melbourne paddock will manage to make how much road he really traveled.\n\n>**Antonelli: ""I will realize that I am in F1 only in the Paddock of Melbourne""**\n\n>Being a Formula 1 pilot involves numerous commitments from the winter stop, which Andrea Kimi Antonelli has said to have been intense in terms of preparation, inside and off the track. ""I stopped two weeks at Christmas and then went to Adidas, where I did some physical tests, then I did the first test, just to resume the pace a little,"" said the young Italian driver. ""I drove the Mercedes of 2020. A nice car monster."" Antonelli then told what is the feeling of being able to drive for the first time an F1 as a pilot holder on a race weekend; An emotion that, despite the first official commitments of the Prevalson, will only be unique when it arrives in the paddock in Australia. ""There was the event in London, then the Bahrain tests, but I think the first time I walk in the paddock will be the moment I will make and say \'it\'s all true\'."" \n\n>Before pointing his gaze to Australia, Kimi, however, recalled where all this began, with the video call of last summer in which the Mercedes leaders announced that he would lead Mercedes in 2025. ""I was at home with my parents and I made this video call and in which Toto were, James Allison, Bradley, all \'big\'. Toto immediately went straight to the point and said to me: \'I don\'t want to wait for you, next year you will be our F1 driver . I didn\'t sleep at the night, I was two hours to watch the ceiling. Relationship with Toto? He is a great person and I\'m happy to have a person like him by my side. "" \n\n>**Work with Bono and how the pressure is managed in F1**\n\n>But can an F1 pilot be afraid of something? ""As a child I was afraid of the darkness,"" said Antonelli. “A fear that maybe sometimes I can have is that of not performing, maybe to go to the track and say: \'But if not pierced and if I can\'t keep the same level? But I must say that on certain occasions it can help. "" A fear that the pilot who grew up in the Mercedes\' Academy, however, has been able to manage well to the sound of victories and titles conquered in the preparatory categories. Going beyond the pure performance gap of the vehicle available, one of the greatest changes that a pilot is facing is certainly due to the figures at his side. “On a race weekend for me and George there will be at least twenty engineers . It is very nice because however you go a lot more in detail. Maybe every engineer asks you a different thing about the car, obviously I interact a lot more with Bono [Peter Bonnington], which is my performance engineer , then there are all the others too. "" \n\n>Although today\'s rookie arrive in F1 with a level of preparation that is not a little advanced compared to what happened in the past, the pressure to be managed and the so -called \'to make the bones\' are aspects that only by experiencing the maximum protagonist category can you fully acquire. “It does not happen every day to be in this position, I had to work to arrive where I am now. I am happy to represent Italy in F1 and the goal is to bring the Italian flag back to the top step of the podium , "" he said speaking between past and present. A key role in his path Antonelli relegated him to the family and his father Marco, thanks to a decades of experience in Motorsport. “To manage the pressure in the first place I speak with my father . Then, however, a small group of people you trust and with whom you have the confidence that you can express how you feel, especially in the most difficult moments, is enough. "" \n\n>**On the opponents in F1: “I have already noticed how ruthless Max is. In F1 there are no friends. "" And then he jokes: ""On the kart I beat Leclerc\'s time""**\n\n>After his announcement as an official pilot, the 2006 Bolognese pilot took part in two free sessions, where he said he immediately understood what it means to run against drivers of the caliber of Max Verstappen. “I have already noticed how ruthless Max is , for example FP1 in Mexico I was preparing for this lap and he pulled me a detached just last sector of the last lap. Outside you have no friends, you have to be due because it is also a way to get respect from others . Obviously respecting the rules, but you have to show that you are not there to play, do seriously. "" Moving instead on a nicest anecdote, Kimi Antonelli told about when, during a holiday in Greece, he beat the record signed by Leclerc in a Kartodromo in Mykonos. “Apparently yes, I beat his time. It was very nice because they were kart for rental but modified, so I was impressed. "" To try to beat the Monegasque pilot and beyond, the Italian rookie will not have to wait much, because the GP of its debut in Australia is now upon us. ""I am sure that if you start on the right foot it will be a good year and it will be fun,"" concluded Kimi.', ""Love to hear it. He already has so much pressure on his young shoulders.
