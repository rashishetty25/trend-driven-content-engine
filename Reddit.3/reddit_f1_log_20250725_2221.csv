1m8y3k9,[AMuS] Verstappen is commited to stay at Red Bull for 2026. But Red Bull agreed to let him go for 2027 in case he wants to leave the team,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m8y3k9/amus_verstappen_is_commited_to_stay_at_red_bull/,2025-07-25, News,,"['Great, now what are we gonna talk about over the summer break?', 'Would be interesting if George and Kimi only get 1 year contract extensions', 'This seems like a fairly smart move by Max. He might forfeit the chance at a 2026 title should Merc be capable of it, but he also eliminates the risk of being locked into a bad situation, be that Merc underperforming or committing to Red Bull only for their works engine to flop. \n\nAlso helps Merc avoid paying an enormous sum to buy him out right now.', 'This doesn’t fit my narrative', 'Google Translation \n\n> The Verstappen mystery is beginning to unravel. For months, the industry has been puzzling over whether the Dutchman will stay at Red Bull or join Mercedes. After Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff and Verstappen met during the break following the Silverstone race in Sardinia, rumors of a transfer were reignited.\n\n> The much-quoted exit clause will come into effect after the Belgian GP. According to this clause, Verstappen could leave if he finishes worse than third in the World Championship. With an 18-point lead over fourth-placed George Russell, this is rather unlikely, despite the points inflation on a sprint weekend.\n\n> It has since leaked out that Verstappen will stay with Red Bull in 2026. He still describes the team as his second family. And from his perspective, it\'s not about exit clauses or personnel matters, but about the team proving to him that it can build a competitive car. ""The last year and a half haven\'t been so good. Now we\'re looking ahead. We have to work on the car and improve it for this year, but also for next season.""\n\n> With this, the world champion is already confirming between the lines that he will definitely stay with Red Bull for another year. The defending champion\'s camp has realized that a hasty move will create more problems than it solves. As of today, no one can reliably predict who will have a good or bad chance next year. A fellow driver says: ""If you\'re going to make a mistake, it\'s better to do it with the team you\'re with. In 2026, you\'ll be able to make a much better choice with more knowledge.""\n\n> Verstappen would have to commit to Mercedes or another team long-term. Anyone who moves now can\'t immediately turn around a year later. At Red Bull, he would effectively be free at the end of 2026. Then the cockpits at Ferrari, Aston Martin, and Mercedes will also be filled.\n\n> Verstappen could, of course, continue driving for Red Bull if the team succeeds in challenging for victories, even under the new regulations. Verstappen\'s management has demanded this freedom. Team boss Christian Horner refused to accept it. This is said to have been the final piece of the puzzle for his disempowerment.\n\n> It would also be interesting to see what happens if Verstappen, contrary to expectations, slips to fourth place after the Belgian GP. Then Toto Wolff will have to consider the Verstappen option again.\n\n> In that case, Andrea Kimi Antonelli would probably have to leave and be parked at another Mercedes team. This is how one should interpret the statements of George Russell, who emphasized again in Spa: ""If you look at the facts, Mercedes can\'t get ahead of me.""\n\n> George Russell could live with Verstappen, even if the two drivers aren\'t best friends. ""I have respect, but I\'m not afraid of Max."" For Mercedes, it would be a fine line to form the two very different superstars into one team. That would almost be on the scale of what happened with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren. This speculation may already be history after the Belgian weekend. Then Mercedes will tell its drivers the truth.', 'There are so many conflicting reports about Verstappen’s contract and plans. Every story seems to be claiming something different\n\nI’m just waiting for August when Mercedes announce either a Russell contract extension or that they’ve signed Max. I honestly don’t think the people writing these articles know much more than the rest of us', ""Whichever team is quickest in 2026, that's where he'll go. Gambling on who'll rein in the new car at this point would be foolish. Prove it on the track and Max will come calling."", 'I think the speculation will continue until Mercedes or Red Bull make formal announcements', 'Plot twist: both Red Bull and Mercedes get fucked up by the rule changes', 'I guess firing Horner worked']",2926,288,0.98,2926,275,275,93,2,0.0,93

He’s saying that he’s not humiliating George, because George is the one who made it public, and that George publicized it because he wanted the narrative to be “Merc respects me enough not to flirt without telling me first.” (Obviously, because the actual newsy part of that story is not “Merc is keeping George in the loop” but “there is something for Merc to keep George in the loop about”, this did not work.)\n\nAbsolutely loved Toto saying that Max and George would be a Prost-Senna lineup. We can only dream.', 'Interesting that Toto blames George for making the negotiations public. I get why George would want to create the narrative if it was going to come out anyway, but Max never said anything about negotiations of his own volition and I doubt Toto would have either.

I said to him: ‘I have the obligation of exploring what Max is going to do in the next two years’. He came out with it, wanting to show that ‘I am aware, nothing is behind my back, I’m alright with it’.”', ""“But obviously a Russell and Verstappen line-up?

Horner may have found an interested party and was slowly moving towards a deal but then the office scandal happened, so the Thais had no choice but to just side with Horner, but as the season progressed and the general slump of Red Bull performance probably gave the buying party cold feet so they backed out and thus Horner ended up getting the Red Bull treatment."", ""It was interesting Russell said he only notices it on media day.
