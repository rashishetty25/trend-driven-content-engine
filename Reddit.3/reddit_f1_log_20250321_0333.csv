1jfkxx5,A look back on Jordan GP's 1st win.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jfkxx5/a_look_back_on_jordan_gps_1st_win/,2025-03-20, Video,"With news of Eddie jordan sadly passing away, I thought I'd take a look back at Spa 1998, one of the most notoriously chaotic GPs in F1 history.

Obviously to win in an underpowered car you'd want the safety car and rain on your side. But for a team like Jordan GP where in 1998 they barely started getting points 5 rounds prior, they pulled through with insane strategy, and secured a 1-2 as a first win.

Fly high, Eddie. You did an unbelievable amount to get Ireland into motorsport.

That is, tracing which side of the garage a driver is on and finding out which one has the most driver's champions victories.

I know Max is in Vettel's old seat (both drove with Riccardo), so that seat has 8.

Kimi's seat has 6 for sure, but what about Button's championship, (if that counts), both drivers left Brawn when it went to Mercedes. Rosberg and Barrichello switched seats to and from Williams, so does that mean it was Button whose seat was taken up by Schumacher and later Hamilton, making it 7?

But it's got to be an old team, Ferrari or McLaren probably

Ferrari has 15 driver's titles, so at least 8 are in the same seat, McLaren has 12, so might beat Ferrari out?

Okay, so it probably can't be Ferrari *or* McLaren, neither has a clear 8 to beat Red Bull.

Oddly, the only other competitor is Mercedes, if you count Brawn and Tyrell then it should be feasible for Lewis's seat to beat RB

*Okay so by my calculations, the most successful seat I can track is Max's current seat, as 8 drivers championships have been won in it, second best is a tie between Hamilton, Senna, Lauda, Hunt, and Fittipaldi's McLaren seat, and Hamilton and Button's Mercedes-Brawn seat. Both at seven.*

1jg233o,TIL about how Chris Amon was possibly one of the greatest and most underrated drivers in F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jg233o/til_about_how_chris_amon_was_possibly_one_of_the/,2025-03-20, Throwback,"When we talk about underrated drivers we always come up with more modern era drivers, but when we think about the older era drivers, I think the biggest name that pops to my mind is that of Chris Amon.

In my humble opinion, Chris Amon was a great and versatile driver who just never had the luck or reliability to win a Grand Prix, and if I may say, if he got to drive with Ferrari in their early 60 era, he may have been a contender for a championship. Ferrari in the late 60s were just struggling to keep up with Lotus, Brabham and Matra International (future Tyrrell) so getting podiums quite consistently was an amazing feat by Amon.

He was also very capable of doing great with a newcomer such as March in 1970, being able to finish at the podium a three times (2 second places and one third) that season (although the 701 was quite a competitive chassis overall). Even at his brief stint at Matra in 1971 and 1972 he was able to get two poles (1971 Italian GP and 1972 French GP) with a car that was just not as good as before.

To sum it up, Chris Amon is not talked about much due to how long it has been since he last competed in F1, but his record shows how much of a wasted talent he was, maybe if he got a seat at Lotus in 68' he could have won a race ir maybe a few more, we will never know how good this man truly could have been.

And to quote Mario Andretti on how unlucky Amon was: ""if he became an undertaker, people would stop dying"", or even legendary Ferrari engineer Mauro Forghieri: ""by far the best test driver I have ever worked with. He had all the qualities to be a World Champion but bad luck just wouldn't let him be"".","['If you were a Kiwi, your dad would have been telling you this ever since you were old enough to remember. \n\nFun fact: Brendon Hartley is the second unluckiest driver.', 'Really was the best part of that late 60s Ferrari team. I think in 69 he finished one race. Just a dire period for them.', 'He won arguably the most famous Le Mans race in history.', 'My favourite quote regarding Amon was from Mario Andretti in the subject of Amon\'s luck: ""if he became an undertaker, people would stop dying"".\n\nAmon himself always said later in life that he was lucky to just have survived the era of formula 1 he raced in (unlike Clark, Rindt, Cevert, and so many others).\n\nIn my totally unbiased kiwi opinion I reckon he was the best driver to never win a race.', 'the Nico Hulkenberg of the 1960s?', 'Liam Lawson third?', 'The more you learn of F1 history, the more you realize that Ferrari going through dire times is actually the norm, not the exception.', 'Ken Miles was robbed', ""He'll be fine.

We may have lost Eddie, but we at least have that to look forward to.

People who knew him, or even those who had never met him, will be keen to add to what he said, or who he was, or what he did for them. None of them will say he was an awful person, or that he didn’t care, or that there was some malice lurking beneath that gregarious exterior. Indeed, there was no boundary between his exterior and his interior. Eddie was unashamed of who and what he was. We all envied him his lack of restraint, even though it could make you wince with embarrassment on most occasions.

Eddie was a Tigger, ‘T-I-G-G-E-R!!!!’. He bounced from place to place, never resting. He had the energy of a nuclear power station. He was to social convention what a wrecking ball is to a tower block. He just didn’t care for stupid rules and niceties. He’d cut the ‘crap’ right out and be alarmingly direct and familiar without ever being impolite.

I used to remember not so long ago videos explaining the driving style of memorable f1 drivers, such as Alonso, Schumacher, Senna, Hamilton, Vettel, Verstappen, even Marc Márquez, if im not wrong. I strongly remember that the thumbnails were a photo of the driver with a solid dark grey background behind.

Some of the videos were quite popular, I think they were from JaramaFan. I used to watch them frequently, as they were of an excellent quality, explaining the ability of adaptation from fernando as well as his renault-michelin technique (neutroviraje), the tire management from seb or the late brake from lewis.

From one day to the next, they went from being among the first result to being unexistant.
