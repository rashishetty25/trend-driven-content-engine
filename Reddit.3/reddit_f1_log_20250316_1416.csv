If there wasn\'t much more rain coming, I thought it could work. You also have to factor in that even if they caught me on an Inter, they‚Äôd have to box again for slicks, if it‚Äôs not going to rain anymore. So, it was fine. I thought, ""Yeah, we\'ll do another lap,"" but then, unfortunately, on that lap, the first sector was still okay-ish, but then in Sector 2, it started to rain a bit too much and we had to box. But in hindsight, it wouldn\'t have mattered. If I‚Äôd boxed with Lando, it would have been P2. If I‚Äôd boxed the next lap, it would have been P2. And the lap that I did box, I was also P2. So, we tried something else‚Äîit might have worked. In a way, it didn‚Äôt work, but we didn‚Äôt lose any position, so it‚Äôs fine.\n \n**Q: Max, when you think where you and the team were at the start of the weekend on Friday after practice, how satisfying is this P2?**\n\nMV: I think it\'s good compared to the teams behind us. But if you look at the first stint, we were quite a bit off. As soon as the tyres started to overheat, we had no chance. McLaren just took off. So, we still have a lot of work to do to fight for a win. But yeah, I‚Äôm happy that we are second here. It\'s basically one place better than we should have been. And it\'s 18 more points than I had last year at this race.', 'The thing is that if Verstappen had pitted the lap after (instead of two laps after), he could have overtaken Norris. In the first half of his outlap, Norris was struggling to keep up with Lawson, so he was losing time.', 'It was the reverse Sochi 2021 I feel, where back then Lewis pitted immediately when things went south but Lando decided to stick out and then faced the consequences.\n\nWhile in this case Max didn‚Äôt pay as much of a consequence, Lando made the earliest call to pit in before anybody else and turned out to have made the right decision. As that race was one of the biggest heartbreaks since I started watching F1, this was a very, very rewarding moment for me. Your favorite driver is learning from the mistake he‚Äôs made 4 years ago! Sochi 2021 died so Melbourne 2025 could live.', 'Possibly, but that‚Äôs when you only look at Lando. At that point, they still thought that he might be able to stay out on slicks, so if he pitted, he would lose out to the Ferrari‚Äôs. In hindsight, this wasn‚Äôt the case, but still. \n\nAnd that is assuming he actually had a big enough gap. I remember seeing Norris 21 seconds behind as the biggest gap. Would that have been enough?', ""Yes, I actually think that they did not pit because they were more concerned by Ferrari than Norris, especially in case of a safety car, which eventually arrived but too late for Ferrari. Maybe a bit of greed on their side. \nI haven't watched back the gap to Norris, but for sure it would have been a tight battle at the exit of the box""]",135,7,0.95,135,7,7,36,0,0.0,36

1jcfw84,Things we (re)learnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jcfw84/things_we_relearnt/,2025-03-16, Discussion,"1. McLaren: well-balanced car. The Drivers gotta step-up and minimize mistakes.


2. Max: pure talent, man! A class driver ‚Äîand Lando knows it. One mistake, and Max will be right there, ready to snatch away points from you. Especially when it rains.


3. Russell: He drives.


4. Norris vs Piastri is loading. Rivalry within house is gonna be fun for us, headache for Brown and opportunities for Max.


5. Hamilton is learning, so is Ferrari.


6. Williams and Vowles are cooking. Hope it doesn't end up like Aston Martin in 2023.


7. For me, the back-markers are still unclear. Ferrari, despite fighting with Williams and Alpine, will soon catch up to be among the front-runners or at least the lower front. Mercedes is in the upper midfield, and maybe Williams too. Alpine and the rest, including Aston Martin, seem more like mid to lower midfield teams. Sauber and Haas will probably eventually end up being the tail of the pack, but for now, I think they can still catch up to RB, Alpine, and Aston Martin. I'm not convinced yet on who will be the lapped cars.


8. Rookies are adapting among big shots. They'll deliver soon.


Edit: some additional points I should've added + elaborating few.

9. Lando deserved that win‚Äîhe drove brilliantly, and praising Max or discussing mistakes doesn‚Äôt take away from that. But we all know how even a small mistake can cost him dearly. I agree with Crofty that he could have suffered the same fate as Oscar with that mistake, and no, that mistake wasn‚Äôt small‚Äîc‚Äômon, guys. As for Max, it‚Äôs clear he can deliver even without being in a rocket ship.

10. Mercedes vs Ferrari: Many pointed out that Mercedes was faster than Ferrari, and I agree. However, Ferrari has the advantage of a seasoned (legendary) driver. Both Kimi and Lewis will need some time to settle in, and as I mentioned elsewhere, opinions might shift as the weeks and races progress. That said, we‚Äôre not quite at the point where we need to discuss Ferrari‚Äôs No. 2 driver‚Äîlol.

11. Piastri: Some people don‚Äôt see him as ready for a championship battle yet, but I believe he has the potential. In my opinion, he can deliver.

12. Kimi: He‚Äôs getting the hang of the car. I‚Äôd love to see him and Ferrari battle in the coming days.

13. Yuki: He had a great race‚Äîuntil he didn‚Äôt. We‚Äôll often hear him and Liam in the same sentence this year.","['George:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1ihmdnn40pe1.jpeg?width=783&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69b5fb3771009894d07285ddb89c9785c5f2fb65', ""McLaren >>> Red Bull > Mercedes >> Ferrari for me. \n\nStrategy aside, Ferrari's pace wasn't great either day."", 'We have to give Lando credit for his restarts today.
