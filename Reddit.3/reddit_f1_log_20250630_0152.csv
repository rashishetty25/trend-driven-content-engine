Hey all,

So watching the start of the race, I was a bit confused when Carlos made his way to the pits for a pit lane start. I was under the impression that once the marshals assisted his car, he was immediately DSQ'd. It ended up being a non factor, but, I figured I'd post this here to help clear it up for people.

Looking back at the regulations for 2025, in 26.7 it states that a car is DSQ'd for receiving marshal assistance anywhere other than the pit lane. However, it also states that there is an exception for 26.7d where marshals are allowed to assist team personnel to remove the car from the grid. As such, 47.2 takes over and it became a pit lane start for Carlos.

Note that this is not entirely clear because 26.7d specifies after the race start, during the intermission between the start of the formation lap and start of the race is not specified.

**HOWEVER**

Where it becomes more confusing is 44.12 (44 covering race start procedure). 44.12c states that any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car.  44.12d states that they may attempt to restart it once back in the pits. Carlos shuts off his car right before the marshals begin pushing him. They then stop pushing and he restarts the car. Should he not be DSQ'd for restarting his car after receiving assistance?

Personally I'd get rid of Kimi but I'd feel awful doing it. I just couldn't refuse a line up of arguably the two best drivers on the grid.

Max is a Goat tier driver and many in the paddock think he might have as much as two to three tenths on the whole grid. In this years Mercedes I think he could be right in the championship fight.

All that suggest that Kimi has a higher ceiling than George (which is very high) is his junior career, but here’s the kicker, George Russell has a better junior career, and against better competition.

In F1 I don't think you refuse a line up of potentially the two best drivers on the grid just to maintain good vibes and the power of friendship.

This is a competitive sport. If I got a chance to potentially have BOTH of the two best drivers on the grid (I’d put Leclerc > Russell tbf but it’s close) I would do it.

And if you get rid of George and get Max/Kimi you run a big risk of Max obliterating Kimi like he has with so many team mates, Kimi losing all confidence, and when Max retires (which he hints is sooner rather than later) you are left with no George. No Kimi. No Max.

And I feel like keeping George/Kimi and keeping Max is the emotions talking. It would be like 2002 Williams refusing 2002 Michael Schumacher to maintain harmony and good vibes. 

You may say Verstappen and Russell would cost each other points by crashing into each other but I think they would more than make up for the points they lose crashing into each other and simply put, I think a team will have a higher points tally with Max/George than they will with Max/Kimi or George/Kimi.

But what do you think? Im interested to hear other opinions even if they are different from my own because all three options have very strong arguments.","[""Just like with Lewis joining Ferrari you take the deal. Getting a (multiple) world champion on board is always favourable. I'd sign him and see how the season plays out and decide on the other driver later on."", ""Wolff has a trauma of missing Verstappen when he was a teenager, I'm pretty sure he's not going to upset Antonelli because he wouldn't want to lose him."", 'Well, no one’s saying no to Max. So I think the obvious answer is dropping George. Toto’s said Kimi needs time (he said 3 year programme) and he fully intends to give it to him bc they would never put him in the seat if he wasn’t a future WDC contender.', ""> Personally I'd get rid of Kimi but I'd feel awful doing it. I just couldn't refuse a line up of arguably the two best drivers on the grid.\n\nI'd try and see if I couldn't park Kimi elsewhere for a bit. Alpine are taking Mercedes engines from next season onwards and have a 2nd seat open. \n\nMercedes can take their time with this decision because it's not like any other top seat will open up for Max. Sure Aston Martin is an option but a risky one at that. \n\nSee how Kimi fares against George until the end of the European leg and then make up your minds as to whether it's enough to warrant giving George the boot or not."", ""Theyd ditch George. It would be harsh, but he'd do it."", 'I think the best and post sensible option is for toto and max to partner and start a new team.

1ln2upy,Side pod design old v new,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ln2upy/side_pod_design_old_v_new/,2025-06-29, Technical,Been looking at pictures of old f1 cars from the 80s-late 90s and the thing that gets me the most is the shift of side pod design around 2005 when the openings became sorta small and rounded like on the Renault r27. And also instead of being low like the McLaren mp4/4 they were moved higher up the car like on the rb19. My question is why the change? Since most of the cars also had their side pods low or atleast right in the middle like the Ferrari f1-2000.,"['Packaging also became smaller and more refined which you can track to v10>v8>v6 now so there was more freedom to direct the airflow in an optimised manner', ""2005 specifically had further engine restrictions on the v10. This meant power output was down compared to previous years so naturally cooling would have been less. Then of course the next year was v8s.\n\nAero design also became more evolved and more efficient, so they're still probably getting a similar volume of air passing through the smaller sidepods as they did with the large ones. They were just better at directing the flow of air to where it needs to go before it hit the sidepod.\n\nSame goes for the engines too. They evolve to produce less heat at similar levels of power as the technology advances.\n\nYou've got 4 different engine configurations in 4 different photos too. 1.5L v6 Turbo > 3.0L v10 > 2.4L v8 > 1.6L v6 Turbo. All of those will have vastly different cooling requirements."", 'The idea was to direct the airflow around the sidepods to feed air above the diffuser and towards the beam wing. \nThis reduced drag and generated downforce, making it much more efficient than simply feeding the beam wing with air flowing over the top of the sidepod. The slimmer the sidepod, the more air is channeled into this area, further enhancing aerodynamic efficiency.', 'They got sculpted that way when the engineers realized you can send air down that way for aerodynamic effect. Prior to that, the thinking was to send more of the air over the car.\n\nInterestingly enough, the seed for this concept dates further back than 2005. In 1992, Ferrari experimented with a ""double floor"" with high-mounted sidepods that channeled air under them but over the floor. The concept actually worked, but was scrapped because Ferrari didn\'t want to blame the engine (which suffered from scavenging issues) for their failures that year. \n\nThen, when the sculpted sidepods came into force, Toro Rosso tried this extreme implementation again with the STR6.\n\nNow, with the 2022 regs reducing overbody downforce, engineers took the sculpting to the extreme again, taking from what was learned from the previous concepts and optimizing it, with the air channeled down there flowing over the diffuser and energizing the rear beam wing.']",3,4,1.0,3,4,4,0,2,0.0,0

Personally i think it would. They will have data from the past season to get the most out of the car bringing them closer to the top teams who build a new car. The top teams would still be ahead by their superior R&D but it would allow for more surprise, better growth of younger drivers and the field more closer pacewise.","['The whole point of F1 is that each team has to build their own car.', ""I would prefer to keep it the way it is.
