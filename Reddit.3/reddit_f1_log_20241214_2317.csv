His points haul was hurt badly by DNFs and missing Saudi because of apendicitis.\n\n\\- Norris was marginally faster than Verstappen on average, (the closest of any of the top drivers) it was most likely Verstappen's superior ability to fight on track and secure wins that enabled him to run away with the championship, not the pace of his car (this is common opinion I think).\n\n\\- Piastri was slower than both Ferraris, and closer to Russell on pace, however he made up for it it the points with incredible consistency and reliability across the season. He very slightly closed last year's gap to Norris from 14.6 seconds to 13.8 seconds per race on average, however if Norris hadn't pitted for fastest lap in Las Vegas, it would have increased to just over 15 seconds.\n\n\\- The mercedes drivers were very close, but Russell's leads were more dominant (probably due to his better qualifying).\n\n\\- The Verstappen-Perez gap is quite shocking, but enough said on that I think\n\nExplanation of method: all classified results for each driver are used, up to 2 laps behind the race leader. I wanted to make this comparison to try and get a sense of the relative pace of the drivers, and eliminate the points bias between finishing positions, it has its own problems because of field spread being heavily effected by safety cars etc for different races, but I think it presents an interesting perspective on how close the cars actually were on track."", 'I agree to a certain extent, but couldn’t decide a good method for which ones to remove as every driver has results that are effected by incidents, hence why I decided to leave all classified finishes less than 2 laps down, but yes it doesnt show actual pace or finishing position, just gap to race leader and teammate.

He is only talked when, “Yuki deserves the RB seat” instead of him. But I want to talk a bit about “his” carreer. He drove only 5 races in 2023 and 6 in 2024. He did not even completed a whole season worth of races, two seasons combined. He lacks of experience especially compared to Yuki’s “4 full seasons” of experience.

He didn’t even have a full season worth of drive (11 races in total, correct me if i’m wrong), so it is not reasonable to compare the two and saying Lawson is bad.

New fan here, started watching F1 last year.

I’ve been doing some “research” for a while now. I’m currently watching every race from the 2012 season.

I simply hate how they used to display the gaps between drivers. You need to check the time really fast as it will soon disappear and show the gaps for the next group of cars.

I find it hard to follow on how the race is at that exact moment, comparing to nowadays where the times are always visible.

There are other things I don’t like, such as the radio messages, which have bad audio quality and that’s understandable, but providing subtitles doesn’t require that much technology.

The way they show the starting grid is also horrendous.
