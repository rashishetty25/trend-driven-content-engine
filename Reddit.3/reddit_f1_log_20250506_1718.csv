I think Oscar is the only driver to cleanly pass Max multiple times now, and he makes it look easy. This last race clearly showed the difference between him and Norris, and well everyone else. 


When Oscar made the move it looked like of course, why doesn't everyone just undercut Max when he tries to go deep and push off the track. Of course this is easier said then done. 


Yet, I am constantly impressed at how clean Oscar is. It stands out as Max's overtakes are quite aggressive and messy as he basically challenges contact. I think Raikkonen would be the last guy that I can remember being that good/clean.

While the McLaren is very good, he is definitely taking advantage of having the best car and is being bold when opportunities come up.\n\nIt's genuinely impressive to watch, him and Kimi are definitely making me excited about the future of the sport on the driver side.\n\nSome of Oscar's passes seem to come out of nowhere, he pulled one on Leclerc last year at Baku, and did one more recently on Hamilton that was just beautiful.\n\nI think he'll only continue to get better and unless the new TD changes things radically, I have to imagine Oscar wins this championship."", 'One thing to note is this year is the first with the new overtaking rules.

They came in an immediately showed something even if it wasn’t really expected of them. \nF1 is so competitive and tight these days that teams can’t really afford to keep a driver who may or may not become good over time. Sure Doohan may become really good (he arguably should be decent considering his testing programme) but really in 6/7 races can it be said he’s been anything other than underwhelming? (even factoring in the fact the cars a tractor). I don’t expect Colapinto to set the world alight but he compared well to Albon (who is having a season right now). If he eliminates the crashes (which might reduce as his future is secure) he’ll be serviceable. Just avoid Alpines socials for the time being….', "">But it would do Colapinto a disservice - and be a naive assessment of Doohan's start to 2025 - to pretend there is no competitive element to this at all. [...] At worst, Colapinto may be a crash risk, and may not be a superstar in the making - the sample set of a part-season at Williams is too small to know for sure on both counts - but he is a proven point scorer already and is a driver with ability.\n\nThis is something that I really agree with. Yea, Doohan was dealt an unfair and terrible hand, but it's not as if Colapinto was out of reach to Albon as a rookie with little preparation last year. I think everyone can agree, especially with his performance so far this season, that Albon is a fantastic driver.\n\nColapinto crashed a lot, but most importantly he had the pace. I believe that people just don't like the idea of him on the grid because he brings with him *very* annoying people.\n\nUltimately, this is another self-inflicted gunshot in the driver management side of things for Alpine.

Comparing Doohan to other drivers of his age is interesting. Colapinto finished 4th in his second F3 season with just two 2 sprint wins, whereas Doohan finished 2nd in his second season with 3 feature race wins and 1 sprint win. Their first F2 seasons are hard to compare with Colapinto getting called up to Williams before it  finished.\n\nDoohan's second season of F2 would probably have been a championship winning season if not for the setup/chassis issues (depending on who you believe) Doohan experienced in the first half of the season. He outscored the entire grid in the second half of the season to finish runner up to a highly rated Théo Pourchaire, who at that point was into his 4th F2 season.\n\nDoohan conclusively (imo) had a better F3/F2 junior career compared to Liam Lawson. Doohan only finished 21 points behind Lawson in F2 despite it being Lawson's second season compared to Doohan's first.\n\nF2 and F3 is littered with drivers who should have had F1 careers, so Doohan can count himself somewhat lucky regardless, but I think a lot of people have passed judgement on his speed without actually watching any of his junior career. The guy was genuinely rapid imo and might have flourished in a much lower pressure environment compared to the basket case that is Alpine.

1kfjgbg,Are the 2025 racing rules killing side-by-side battles?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfjgbg/are_the_2025_racing_rules_killing_sidebyside/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"The 2025 changes to racing rules are making proper wheel-to-wheel racing, especially over multiple corners, nearly impossible.

[Video - How F1's secret racing rules have changed for 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbTAHyzkrY)[Article - The new F1 racing rules that sealed Verstappen penalty](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/revealed-new-f1-2025-racing-rules-verstappen-jeddah-penalty/)  
The above video and article by THE RACE explains these changes well but I will give a summary below:

Under the new rules, if a driver is overtaking on the *inside* (and they are in control and within track limits), **they no longer have to leave space for the car on the** ***outside*** **at corner exit**. That’s a major shift from 2024, where both drivers were expected to leave each other room if they were side-by-side at the apex.

Because of this rule change, if a driver overtaking on the inside manages to get alongside the wing mirror of the car on the outside, the car on the outside effectively has to give up the corner. The inside driver can now legally run them out of space on exit, so there’s little incentive to stay side-by-side. As a result, we’re unlikely to see drivers hanging it around the outside anymore, which basically kills the chance of multi-corner battles.

https://preview.redd.it/jl0tjjo6d0ze1.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=e093fee9a8b09a072921ff232e44bd2ab3b7e79f

This rule change is why **Piastri's Lap 1 Turn 1 incident** in Jeddah was deemed legal. Under the 2024 rules, this move would likely have resulted in a penalty.

**TLDR: Inside car just divebombs, outside car either backs out or gets run off. Not much of a battle.**

Another key 2025 rule change concerns overtaking around the outside. Under the new guidelines, a driver attempting a move on the outside must now be **ahead at the apex** to be entitled to space on corner exit. Simply being **alongside**, as was sufficient under the 2024 rules, no longer guarantees that right. This makes outside overtakes significantly harder and discourages side-by-side racing, as drivers will be less likely to attempt moves around the outside.

This rule likely explains why Verstappen wasn’t penalized for forcing Norris off in **Miami Lap 1 Turn 2** — Norris was only alongside, not ahead, so Verstappen wasn’t required to leave room.","[""So once the car on the inside is ahead, they have the right to the whole track? That's beyond stupid."", 'The interesting thing is that these changes resulted from a meeting with all drivers in Qatar last year, after criticism that drivers overtaking on the inside were being penalised too often.\n\nRussell spoke in an [interview](https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/13262139/qatar-gp-f1-drivers-fia-stewards-hold-productive-meeting-to-discuss-racing-rules-after-max-verstappen-and-lando-norris-controversy) about it:\n\n>""If you are able to stay on the circuit [when overtaking on the inside] you are in your right to run the driver wide, as it has been for all of us since go-karts,"" he said.\n\nThis is exactly what the drivers wanted (to be able to run the defending car off the road) and is more consistent with lower category motorsport compared to previous versions, according to Russell.', ""Yes. Take a look at the Ocon and Hamilton battle. Absolutely unreal battling by both and it was 100% fair. And Ocon didn't actually have to leave Lewis space according to the new rules (albeit that space was largely the run off, but such is the track layout), he didn't because he can actually race wheel to wheel. Historically he just chooses not to when it's a teammate lol.\n\nWheel to wheel racing has never been as low quality as it is now. And it's not because the drivers are incapable, it's because they're choosing not to because the rulebook is dumb as fuck and seemingly written in a way solely to cause debate. You couple that with stewards making inconsistent decisions every single weekend and you end up in a scenario where nobody actually knows where the baseline is because it changes every week."", 'Absolutely yes', 'Yeah pretty much.\n\nWhat we have today isn\'t good racing by any stretch. The amount of actual good racing we had over the last years is very little.

Now that the dust has settled in Miami, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""The RB21 performance varies so much from track to track it's insane... Max was on par and maybe even faster than Piastri in Saudi and here he was 8 tenths slower."", ""I am as disheartened as everybody else to see Ferrari going back into the disorganised, lost figures of themselves in the team, but in my opinion, demanding for Fred Vasseur's exit from the team is simply absurd\n\nDating back to when Luca Di Montezemolo destabilized the Holy Trinity of Ferrari itself, it seems that the team is unable to find middle ground with their values and the prospects to win on certain aspects in a cultural sense. Whether it is the unwillingness to break out of traditional norms to take risks in exchange for chances of winning or the organisation of the fold crumbling under pressure, changing team principals on a constant basis will not solve the problem at hand, especially since Vasseur was the man who narrowly led Ferrari to the top, had it not been for the middle stretch of the races. There is a case to be made with Binotto, but constantly being in the cycle of  shifting, blaming and replacing would only send the organisation back to square one, and fumbling over themselves\n\nThat being said, I also believe Vasseur needs to iron these issues out if Ferrari wants to salvage the rest of their season. Miscommunication between drivers and engineers are not the most unheard of, but for it to be a recurring theme is insane. Neither Leclerc nor Hamilton had adequate pace to catch Antonelli, and they barely kept Sainz at bay in a car believed to be much weaker than theirs. The issue that the drivers are figuring out the car's strengths and weaknesses, and trying to salvage what they can with its characteristics is concerning at this stage of the season. By changing the car's philosophy *(which I get the reasoning but I wouldn't have particularly been on board with)*, the gamble did not pay off well\n\nWith the race where they can bring upgrades coming in, I hope they find something. If that doesn't work, then I can only hope Vasseur would use the time and his efforts to fix the team. It will not be easy, if my understanding of Ferrari's rigid rules are factual, but if the team wants to win, then the bigwigs really need to consider these aspects first before anything. A lot of Ferrari's future is on them"", 'From my second time attending this race (or any F1 event) in person:\n\n1) Turn 18 is a better spot to sit than turn 12. Glad I tried something different this time but I’d do another spot before sitting at the ‘beach’ in Miami again. \n2) But, my vantage point made the gap in the field even more outstanding in the last third of the race where Lando and Oscar would come around 11, 12 and 13 and disappear and their sound would disappear. Like… quiet on the track except for piped in commentary. Then came George and his sound would lessen and then Max and his engine noise dissipated and then… everyone else. The McLarens were just in a different universe. \n3) I recognize Max as an incredible talent and I’m a big Lewis fan but I also like having many winners and contenders so I think this year has been fun. I’ll be just as bored if McLaren walks away with all the wins  this year (could be likely!) than I would be if Max did it again or if we were in the Lewis/Merc dominant era . So, I like the dominance shifting and the fun that brings to us, the fans. \n4) Last for me was seeing Albon punching in the top third and every time I saw him go by I was impressed with his chasing of Max and then Ferrari. I like him and I particularly like Vowles and so I think it’s super cool to see Williams showing a spark and have a resurgence.', ""With the rumours of Doohan possibly getting replaced I can't help but feel sad for him.

Their car needs development and strategy department needs a full overhaul. The pit crew is really good though.\n\nRed Bull, Merc and Williams seem to be the ones vying for the second best car at the moment.

I love that you mostly had to use the long straight to force the car to defend and take a weird line into the chicane, and then have to nail those corners to get the chance to overtake into Turn 1.\n\nIt made the overtakes difficult and you had to work for them, but possible. It also made a great viewing experience to watch how the end of the long straight goes to see how far the leading car has to defend offline, and builds your anticipation for Turn 1.\n\nThe race settled down quite a bit after the VSC as the cars were mostly sorted in order of performance, but the Lando/Piastri/Verstappen battles was probably my favourite part of this season so far.', ""30+ sec down the road when not even leading from T1 is really a painful gap for everyone not named McLaren. I would be lying if I didn't say that I am not looking forward to hot thermal deg races.

Lando kept trying the switchback instead of going outside so Max didn’t have to brake so hard and was able to carry more speed through the corner and keep the position.\n\nLando really needs to try something new when battling Max because it’s just so predictable and Max is completely in his head.', 'Someone should host a barbeque next to the circuit next time.

Max Verstappen will remain a spectre on the driver market until he has decided whether to stay or go with Red Bull.\n\nThe drivers who are still without a contract at the moment can still hold out hope. Cadillac has two cockpits up for grabs for 2026. And one decision has already been made by the Americans. Two drivers with Formula 1 experience will be entering the premier class.\n\nThis means that the signing of an American has been put on the back burner. IndyCar vice-champion Colton Herta was long regarded as a promising candidate for one of the two cockpits. However, a high-ranking team member reveals: ‘GM is entering the Formula 1 project with two priorities. Firstly, the performance has to be right. Only in the second step is the American identity on the agenda.’ This increases the chances for applicants with a Formula 1 background.

Talks have already been held with all the suspects. The following names are being traded: Sergio Perez, Valtteri Bottas, Guanyu Zhou, Felipe Drugovich, Patricio O'Ward.\n\nMick Schumacher can also hope to become a Cadillac works driver next year. The WEC driver from Alpine has been in talks with the US racing team for some time. He travelled to Miami between the WEC events in Imola and Spa to meet with the Cadillac bosses and show his colours. Board member Mario Andretti is indirectly involved in the driver selection process. ‘Others make the decisions. But they ask me for my opinion.’\n\nSchumacher was also invited to Cadillac's evening event in Miami Beach, where the racing team presented its new logo. This shows that Schumacher is serious about his interest. With 43 GP starts and twelve world championship points in his two Haas seasons and two years of simulator work at Mercedes, the 26-year-old German fulfils the requirements demanded by Cadillac.\n\nCadillac can also follow Schumacher's performances at close quarters. Alpine driver Schumacher is one of Cadillac's competitors in the World Endurance Championship (WEC). Most recently, the former Haas driver drove the Alpine to a podium finish in Imola.

He's 51 years old, in a game that needs energy and lightning reactions to rapidly changing circumstances. 

He's too old, too slow, too ponderous, not creative or flexible and given his lacklustre career results, he's - at best - a B-player. 

Someone like Lambiase or Bonnington are absolutely flying doors ahead of Adami. It's blindly obvious those guys are on another level completely, enabling their drivers to be successful by creating opportunities, gaming things out well in advance, reacting to circumstances, keeping the driver focussed, providing data, answers, options, and competent race management.

They also almost certainly have the trust of the team management and thus autonomy to make quick, independent decisions, whereas half the delay with Adami is probably checking with management for 2-3 laps before a decision, because they don't trust him.

Ferrari needs a clean sweep on race engineers, new blood with experience, a new system. Bryan Bozzi is also a B player - better than Xavi Marcos for sure but still not good enough. All those memes about the clowns on the prat perch? A big chunk of those seats are filled by the race engineers.

1kfi3v2,A bone to pick with this race director and his unwillingness to use red flags,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfi3v2/a_bone_to_pick_with_this_race_director_and_his/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"I know red flags have a bit of a negative stigma, as there seems to be a common opinion that it's better to keep the race moving under yellow flags, a VSC or a safety car than to red flag it and bring everyone back to the pits. 

But...why? 

Red flags have become much more common in recent years, presumably for safety reasons. But I've noticed a reversal from this under new race director Rui Marques, who in Saturday's Miami sprint didn't red flag the race after an accident between Liam Lawson and Fernando Alonso that I'm almost sure would have caused a red flag between 2020 and 2024. 

It quickly became obvious that we'd finish the race behind the safety car, losing four potentially thrilling laps of action. 

But again...why? 

We also lost 4 laps to a safety car in Bahrain, and a ridiculous 20 total laps in Australia. That's nearly half the race!

I totally understand the use of the safety car or VSC if there's some debris on track or it appears the incident in question can be dealt with quickly, but I fail to see who benefits from a safety car period of more than a couple of laps. The fans lose out on a bunch of racing laps, and cheap pit stops often give certain drivers lucky advantages at random.

**Benefits of a red flag over a safety car:**  

* Fewer racing laps lost 
* The option for a far more entertaining standing start (but can still do a rolling start which is identical to safety car restart, if desired)
* Oftentimes more fair (no cheap pit stops, and let's not get started on Abu Dhabi 2021)

**Benefits of a safety car over a red flag:**

* Often less of a delay in the action 

But even that last point is flimsy, as I'm as entertained by what's going on during a red flag period as I am watching the cars crawl around the track behind the safety car. 

**53 races/sprints before Marques took over:** 

Safety cars for 4+ laps: 15  
Red flags: 9 

**12 races under Marques:**

Safety cars for 4+ laps: 7  
Red flags: 0

I don't know if this is the result of an edict or what, but I don't think it's a good trend for the sport.
