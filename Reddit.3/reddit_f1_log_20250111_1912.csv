You don\'t have to be hardcore invested in it in your favourite drivers/teams most recent gear ever 5 weeks, depending on what is legal as advertisement.  \nBut as an occasional live visitor having sprint and race makes visiting Saturday and Sunday more interesting.  \n  \nAs to people working there (and also the thousands of volunteers) it\'s a strain, but they\'d be better off working as an engineer outside of the sport, where they\'d earn more money - so they\'re also there as they like the challenge.  \nSimilarly all teams are now pivoting to engineering services companies, which allows them to keep the workforce and not everyone singularly committed to F1 full time.  \n  \n[Toto Wolff, with the incoming cost cap, planned to transform their ~20m per year services arm to ~100m services industry](https://www.ft.com/content/8f3b4450-24a9-4438-ae50-7d30ea2a00fc) and I\'d say he also managed to achieve it - considering the turnover of the company.  \nSimilarly McLaren and Red Bull Technologies (parent company of Red Bull Racing) are also structured in a similar manner (though more publicly - as different subsidiaries), allowing them to keep their workforce busy & happy as well as to have different teams for the ~80 or so people who travel to circuit.  \n  \n> F1 has turned from probably the peak of motorsport  \n  \nI don\'t think that was ever the case - it always has had regulations and restrictions where modern technologies are tested in various industries and once their compact / robust enough they come to F1 - independently if they\'re road relevant or not (sequential gearboxes from motorcycles, composite materials from aerospace engineering, automatic gearboxes/traction control once technologies was reliable and fast enough after it was used in road cars).  \nThe formula changes and is dictated by what ever is currently interesting for manufacturers (why Ferrari got technical veto power - when they were the only full manufacturer in the sport in the 80s).  \nOther times other sports have been faster, more technical (Group B in 80s, LMP in 90s, CanAm in 60s).  \nF1 is just the ""highest level"" of open wheeled formula (regulations) that isn\'t a spec series.  \n  \n> We are literally in a scenario where Germany, a country which has a total of 3 world champions and has won a total of 12 drivers titles doesnt have GP, yet a continent who cant even get a driver into the sport hosts 4.  \n  \nBecause Germany, while a world known car country, is primarily a football country, where the stadiums are regularly sold out in first and second league - and many aren\'t interested in motorsports - Formula 1 peaked in 2000 with viewership and attendance and has been declining ever since, as even Germans got bored of Schumacher.  \nIn contrast to other countries, even Italy and Spa, as well as COTA, are (local) government subsidised and Germany doesn\'t do that, as it concentrates more on industry and voluntary youth clubs for football/handball/basketball.  \n  \n> Why do any of you watch it?  \n  \nCars going vroom, makes dopamine happen, independently of a team/driver/circuit.\nThis doesn\'t happen with other sports, movies or television.  \n  \nEdit: i should enable autocorrect.', 'Cars go vroom fast:)', ""Not going to bother replying to all of this but just want to point out that Germany has never really loved F1 apart from the Schumacher years.
