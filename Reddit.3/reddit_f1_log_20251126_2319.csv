1p6zg81,"Seb Vettel on how Lando has impressed him: “I think I’m generally impressed by him.

And then you had this image of racing drivers where machines, were so precise and no mistakes and it’s all racing and you don’t show weaknesses. And this goes across sports. Don’t show weaknesses because you know, you don’t want to show to your opponent, blah, blah, blah. And I think it’s all crap. I think we are all humans. We all have our problems that we’re facing. And it’s great to see Lando being such a role model inside Formula One, but also then especially outside Formula One.  
  
And I think that’s why also reason why he’s so popular, because he’s giving people that something else, not just, you know, racing. And okay, finishes 4th and finishes first. And you know, he’s popular because he wins and popular because of results and performances. But no, he’s giving people something else. And that’s what people appreciate. And if you ask people, they’re probably not able to phrase it perfectly. But I think that’s in essence why he is one of the most popular drivers on the grid. And I think it’s such a great thing happening.  
  
And of course, I also see the comments of others criticizing that part. ‘It makes him vulnerable or it’s not good.’ But I strongly disagree. \[from naenia01\]

1p6yhpg,Who wins Qatar 2025? A summary of some predictors,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6yhpg/who_wins_qatar_2025_a_summary_of_some_predictors/,2025-11-26, Discussion,"With the double DSQ and Verstappen win at Vegas, the last two race weekends of the season have become massively important—and with Qatar being a sprint weekend it seems it will be the most decisive of all. As a track:

* Qatar is high-speed with long, flowing corners, little demand for low-speed traction, and high sensitivity to brake balance and platform stability. Only one corner averages less than 100 km/h, with most well above 200 km/h.
* Overtaking is hard but not impossible with a big opportunity into T1 with DRS.
* Tire degradation is extremely high and tire deltas are essential to pass. Historically, it’s been a 2-stop race but this year Pirelli has gone further, mandating a 25-lap limit on each compound in the 57-lap race.
* Qualifying is key: in the 3 Qatar Grands Prix, whoever leads the race after T1 has won every time (twice pole sitters and Verstappen in 2024 starting P2).

2025 circuits similar to Qatar:

* Suzuka: Verstappen on pole, eking out a race win with Norris P2, Piastri P3
* Jeddah: Verstappen again on pole with Piastri +0.010. Piastri pressured Max into a lap-1 error and won with Max P2 +2.8s. Having crashed out in Q3, Lando recovered to P4.
* Spain: Piastri on pole with Lando +0.209 and Max +0.302. Piastri wins with Norris P2 +2.5s, while Max falls from P3 to P10 after a pitlane error (and more lol).
* Silverstone: Max takes pole gambling on low downforce with Piastri +0.103 and Lando +0.118. Race day is wet and he drops to P5. Leading, Piastri suffers a 10s penalty for unsafe braking and Lando claims P1.

**Max: 3 poles, 1 win. Oscar: 1 pole, 2 wins. Lando: 0 poles, 1 win (not on pace).**

History at Qatar (quickest on pace in bold)

* 2023 Sprint: **Piastri on pole** & Norris P2 in sprint shootout. **Piastri P1**, Max P2, Lando P3.
* 2023 Grand Prix: **Max on pole**\--Piastri P6, Norris P10 due to track limits, despite having the pace for P3+P2 respectively in Q2. Merc-on-Merc violence plus great race pace led them to the podium within 6s of **Max in P1**. (P4 was +34s.)
* 2024 Sprint: **Lando on pole**, Oscar P3 at +0.159s, Max P6 at +0.303. Lando led comfortably while Oscar in P2 needed DRS to hold off George, and the two swapped at the final corner. Oscar P1, **Lando P2,** Max P8.
* 2024 Grand Prix: **Max on pole**, Lando P3 at +0.252, Oscar P4 at +0.309. Lando in P2 drops to P15 due to a penalty and recovers to P10. **Max P1**, Leclerc P2, Piastri P3.

Impact of Pirelli’s 25-lap rule

* This surely helps Red Bull. With McLaren’s infamous tire wear advantage, this caps their ability to extend leads with low deg. over long stints or flip track position with it. Max is also right in his wheelhouse being able to attack flat-out when strategies are predictable.
* In McLaren’s favor, however, predictable strategies at this point in 2025 is perhaps a positive for Lando, who needs to avoid unexpected disaster more than he needs to dominate. And their tire advantage will still play a role over shorter stints.

Many are forecasting this race as a Piastri track on paper and a sure McLaren oasis among a bumpy last-half stint. I’m not sure how clear that really is. Thinking of Piastri’s performance at similar tracks earlier this year, it seems this ought to be a Piastri weekend. But those performances came long ago and before his dramatic fall from pace. His performances at Qatar also don’t even come out much better than Lando, and at Qatar in 2024 he complained of low grip, something he and Stella have made clear has been problematic this season.

For Lando on the other hand, who’s in the midst of a meteoric resurgence, he struggled at comparable tracks in 2025, and at Qatar has struggled with track limits, even compared to a grid full of drivers who have had brushes with it. And with McLaren’s DSQs in Vegas which they blamed on lack of data—and only one practice in Qatar—I can see them playing it safe with ride height and losing some performance.

Red Bull aren’t out in the clear with how unpredictable their performance has been, even at tracks historically dominated by them like Mexico. Max is very strong at Qatar (which seems a bit lost in the conversation so far), but he's struggled in the sprints. And he needs much more than a great showing, including help from Mercedes and Ferrari which this season is a crapshoot.

I lean Max but I don’t have a solid prediction. Just giving out info I looked up for myself. But to have a penultimate race weekend this important and this unpredictable is utterly fascinating.","['Verstappen levels of technical writing acumen. This is great. Something that came to mind while reading this is whether teams will risk tweaking their car between the sprint and GP quali, despite the risks of messing up the car (i.e. Red Bull at Brazil), because there is so little racing left in the season.\n\nI have a quick question about the unique 25 lap limit. Do laps under a safety car count? Could we potentially have 7 laps of safety car that brings it back to a 1 stop race for teams that gamble for such a scenario?', ""Lando just has to stay close to Max and Oscar. That's all. The only chance Oscar and Max have is when Lando DNF's or drops out of the points because of a crash or technical failure. It should be a walk in the park for Lando."", ""This is so detailed! I loved reading through. I'll say it will be another Max win with Norris P2. And maybe Russell or Leclerc P3, though I am leaning more on Russell's side given his track record this year."", 'I assume Mcl play super safe so Max wins and they aims for a comfortable 2-3. Only thing is atp Oscar has nothing to lose so he will full send it at any opportunity even if the risk is higher than normal. Luckily I think Lando has proven he can handle some level of pressure (coming back from the deficit) so a clean quali and race and he will be ok.\xa0', 'I think Max has the best chance of winning in Qatar.  The new engine combined with the 25 lap tire change limit, certainly helps his chances.', ""So Norris wins the championship. Pack it up boys, we're done with the season"", ""What's the 25 lap rule? You gotta pit in 25 laps even on hards?"", ""It's about time Ferrari wins a race!"", 'I’ve said before since the American schedule started, Piastri’s best track in the second half seems to be Qatar. He’s consistently delivered strong drives there so I think if he has any shot (albeit little) to take the title, this is his best opportunity. However, Lando’s just as quick around Qatar as Oscar is so Oscar’s gonna need some of that same luck he got at Zandvoort to bring the points difference down significantly.

Once teams started coming up with crafty ways to generate ""accidental"" dirty air the FIA didn\'t step in to course correct. An example being the front wing plane to end plate connections being shrunk down to a wire allowing air to spill to the sides.\n\nMy hot take: If they kept true to the intent of the regs, as they did with Astons more traditional wing design that did 1 race before a rule adjustment, the racing would be better.', ""I also think that ironically, the cars being so close in pace and the dirty air team up to make races worse because the delta needed to overtake is often larger than the delta between the pace of the cars.

It's always the tyres, for at least the last 2 decades if not more. Strategic variants and tyre offsets lead to good racing.
