1hxssxl,"Jack Doohan’s experience at Abu Dhabi, and why Alpine are concerned ",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hxssxl/jack_doohans_experience_at_abu_dhabi_and_why/,2025-01-10, Statistics,"There’s a lot of talk about the expectations being piled on Jack Doohan by Alpine, and whether they’re justified or not. But after another comment made me look up some numbers, I decided to look into Jack’s testing at Abu Dhabi alone, and why the result he had at Abu Dhabi may have been the nail in the coffin.

In Abu Dhabi, Jack finished second last. Kevin Magnussen was the only person who finished behind him, but remember that Kevin pitted for fastest lap. Jack was last when compared to people on the same strategy throughout the entirety of the race. Flavio Briatore seemed less than enthused with this in his post Abu Dhabi video.

You can put this down to rookies being rookies, but it should be noticed that Jack has extensive testing in Abu Dhabi prior to this race. He has done the young driver tests in 2022 and 2023 for Alpine, and also has done FP1 at Abu Dhabi in 2022 and 2023. Based on the official timing…

2022 FP1 - 25 laps completed
2022 YDT - 111 laps completed
2023 FP1 - 23 laps completed
2023 YDT - 107 laps completed.

In total, this is 266 laps done by Jack in an Alpine F1 car at Abu Dhabi alone. Abu Dhabi is 5.3km long, so this totals to **over 1400km of experience at this track alone.** That’s 17.5% of the entire testing Lewis Hamilton did before his McLaren debut which is often touted as extensive - and he’s done that at one singular track.

Was Alpine really asking too much for him to do an better job at a track he has this much experience on? Particularly when he has experience with the A424 through FP1 sessions and testing days. Add in the extensive TPC program - this year he’s had Paul Ricard, Qatar for 2 days, Zandvoort for 2 days, and is it a shock that Alpine current have doubts?","['He also did extensive TPC in Abu Dhabi in 2024 before the race. That’s one of the locations Alpine uses along with Qatar. Which means it was the best race for him to debut. He even won Abu Dhabi in F2. Still, it’s just one race. Everything can go wrong in one race. Colapinto in Brazil is an example.', ""I am still wondering why everyone thinks he will be some great talent. Look at his junior career, doesn't really suggest he will have a long career in F1. I think it just came down to Alpine once again completely messing up driver decisions and they were simply stuck with him and no good alternatives (they also would look a bit odd after keeping him so long as reserve and then just gambling on someone else).\n\nI hope he will do well, since he seems like a nice guy based on F1TV stuff, but I am not expecting him to finish the season."", 'Big difference between testing/practice and an actual race. It was his first race at any level in 378 days - compare that to Colapinto who had 28 races in that same period', 'But maybe the Alpine car sucks.', 'I chalk it up to him being conservative and not wanting to bin it on debut, which would have been worse case possible. I don’t think he’s a top talent, but let’s wait and give him a proper run in testing and at Bahrain. If he’s still proper shit well we get Colapinto back early', '[“Theres no expectation”](https://youtu.be/c4uPjl9OXQc?si=oSJG0dL1C8sT3Tlh) All he had to do was finish the race and he did. Alpine should be concerned about their car not the rookie with one race under his belt. Well see what happens after round 1.', "">Was Alpine really asking too much for him to do an better job at a track he has this much experience on?\n\nI feel like it's premature to judge a driver on a single performance, even at a circuit that they have considerable experience at. Especially considering the circumstances of how Doohan came to be in the seat in the first place."", ""I firmly believe that there was something fucky going on with Ocon's car ( Which Doohan also drove).\n\nOcon went from being the faster Alpine driver to nearly 1sec off territory after he announced his Haas deal.\n\n Gasly is good but he's shouldn't be 1sec faster than Ocon on merit.\n\nThis Franco to Alpine talk has been going on behind the scene by the time AD rolled around. Alpine doesn't want Doohan to succeed. Franco is a decent driver too and he brings in a shed load of money and exposure to the team."", ""He's had one single race, nothing to judge him on much like Colapinto - he started off very aggressive and got some results but you eventually saw a cost to that.\n\nMaybe Doohan was conservative given a crash would have been the worst outcome for him in the situation.\n\nDrivers need a whole year minimum, but teams and fans all want the next big star to come in from debut.""]",134,50,0.81,134,46,46,134,50,0.81,134

1hxny6m,New F1 fan (existing NASCAR fan) with a few questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hxny6m/new_f1_fan_existing_nascar_fan_with_a_few/,2025-01-09, Discussion,"Hello everyone! I live in the southern part of the US and have been a pretty big NASCAR fan for almost two decades now. I just really got into Formula 1 about halfway (or maybe about two thirds) into the 2024 season. I just had a few questions for you all; I know I could likely find some of these answers through my own research, but I really wanted to correspond directly with some real Formula 1 fans, especially as there are not a whole lot of F1 fans near where I live. Like I said, I’m pretty new to this, so please forgive my ignorance if any of these questions seem pretty stupid! 

First of all, I really fell in love with F1 quickly. It is so much different than NASCAR, and so much more technical, that there is just so much to try to learn. Even though I became a fan in the middle of the 2024 season, I went back and watched all the races for the year (and yes, I did legally pay for this!), as well as other random races from years (and sometimes decades) prior. One thing I really love about F1 is how important qualifying is, especially compared to NASCAR. For a race like Monaco for example, I almost feel like qualifying is more important than the race itself (at least in terms of how well you are likely to finish). Anyway, here are a couple of real basic questions I have:

1. I noticed when watching races from previous years (and especially prior decades) that the engines all sound a little different. Is this mainly just due to regulations changing regarding the engines and their displacement, or is it perhaps from changes in the quality of the microphones picking up the sound? By contrast, NASCAR races from the 70s or 80s don’t sound a whole different than they do today, at least to me they don’t. To be honest, I actually think I like the sound of F1 cars from previous decades better than the current sound.
2. I admittedly don’t know a lot about all the drivers yet. However, I have noticed that a lot of the drivers seem to come from relativity affluent families, and oftentimes they are the children or some type of relative of previous F1 drivers. It seems like it would be pretty expensive to finance a kid’s career through the feeder series over the years, so it definitely makes sense that a lot of the drivers would come from families that are well off. This is true for NASCAR as well to an extant. Anyway, I was just wondering if there are any current drivers who grew up poor or maybe middle class and basically overcame the odds through talent alone. 

3. I notice that a lot of F1 drivers are quite slender, relatively short, and in general their fitness seems to be taken more seriously than in NASCAR. As a bigger guy myself, I was just curious if there have been any “big guys” who have had successful F1 careers in the past (let’s say over 6 feet tall and 200 lbs or more; for non-Americans, 6 feet is 1.8288 meters, and 200 pounds is 90.7185 kilograms)? 

4. Last question for now…I really want to go to an F1 race! However, it is quite an investment for my family and I, at least compared to NASCAR races. If you all had to choose between seeing a race in Miami, Las Vegas, or Austin Texas, which would you choose (assuming you are probably going to have to buy tickets on the cheaper end of the range)? I’m used to going to races at oval tracks where you are never really losing sight of the cars, so trying to determine sight lines for F1 courses is a little challenging for me.

Thanks so much everyone! I really love this sport and appreciate anyone who takes the time to reply…have a great weekend and stay safe!","['Welcome to the fandom! It’s quite addictive so be careful. Will try to answer to the the best of my ability. \n1. Yes, due to different engine regulations. In the last ~20 years F1 has gone from V10s to V8s and now V6 hybrids. In 2026 there will be another regulation change where 50% of the horsepower will be from the electrical side\n2. Yes, most drivers come from affluent backgrounds. The main exceptions in today’s grid are Hamilton, Ocon, Gasly to an extent\n3. Height isn’t as much of a challenge as weight, it’s just hard to keep the weight down. Most drivers are around 70-75 kilos so you can imagine it’s hard to be around that weight if you’re over 6 ft\n4. Of the American races I’d recommend Austin. Probably closest of the 3 to a NASCAR vibe, and is the better track as well. You’re never going to be able to see the whole track from anywhere, unfortunately, but turn 1 at COTA seems like a good place for the race start and a good amount of overtakes.\nHope that helps. Enjoy the journey!', "">I notice that a lot of F1 drivers are quite slender, relatively short, and in general their fitness seems to be taken more seriously than in NASCAR.

But generally not to this extent given racing drivers are usually not very long and neither big. Probably the most recent outlier in terms of height and weight and succesful has to be Nigel Mansell. He also drove for the most part in an era in which you would gain a lot of laptime for free by being light, therefore disadvantaging Nigel. But not even Nigel was 90 KG.\n\nBerger's height in 1996 was a problem when he switched from Ferrari to Benetton, given the car wasn't designed for a driver 10 cm taller than Schumacher.\n\nSo height and weight can sometimes be a struggle, height probably these days not anymore if you aren't 1.90m or something. Weight will always be a sensitive thing given nobody wants to be above the weight that is currently set for the drivers. Previously it was possible to just drive better but these days being above the weight limit would probably be a death sentence."", 'Part 1:\n\nHi and welcome! i can\'t answer all of your questions but I\'ll give some info.\n\n>especially as there are not a whole lot of F1 fans near where I live.\xa0\n\nJoin the club! There are a lot more F1 fans in the U.S. in the past few years, but still not a whole lot. I saw someone in my area wearing a team jersey recently and that\'s so rare, I had to go talk to them. We were both surprised and happy to meet another F1 fan!\n\n>For a race like Monaco for example, I almost feel like qualifying is more important than the race itself\xa0\n\nYes, in Monaco especially quali is super important. The cars are too wide and big for the track, the track is narrow, which makes overtaking difficult. It is typically the race each year that has the fewest overtakes.\n\n>Anyway, I was just wondering if there are any current drivers who grew up poor or maybe middle class and basically overcame the odds through talent alone.\n\nYes, it\'s expensive to go through the ladder to get to F1. Karting alone can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. A few current drivers were considered middle class: Lewis Hamilton, Esteban Ocon, Charles Leclerc (some will argue his family was semi-rich just because they lived in Monaco but they did not have a lot of money). Ocon\'s parents sold their house and the family traveled in a big van to his karting races. Talent does shine through, eventually, and then they can get sponsors to offset some or all of the costs.\n\n>I notice that a lot of F1 drivers are quite slender, relatively short, and in general their fitness seems to be taken more seriously than in NASCAR.\n\nYup they are all slender and not very tall. The two tallest are Ocon and Albon at 6\'1"". Most are around 5\'7-ish. They need a lot of core strength and not muscles (except their necks). Google ""Formula 1 driver\'s necks"" and compare them to other series\' drivers. The G forces in an F1 car are super high so they need strength to stay positioned in the car and for head stability. They have belts and other stuff, of course, but they\'d be moving a lot more if they didn\'t have core strength. There are a lot of videos out there about how they train their necks, it\'s very interesting.\n\nTheir athleticism is somewhat minimized by outsiders. It\'s January 9th and almost every driver has already started extensive training (multiple hours a day) to get ready for the season, which doesn\'t start for 2 months.\n\nMany years ago there were larger drivers, the tallest ever I think was 6\'4"", but in the past many years no one has been very large. Their weight effects the cars performance and their are regulations about it. You\'ll see drivers get weighed after every race', ""Re #3, since 2019 there's been a minimum weight for the driver+suit+helmet+HANS+seat, which was 80 kg (176 lb), and increasing to 82 kg this season. Prior to this weight limit being implemented, there was a sordid history of eating disorders amongst drivers.\n\nI remember seeing somewhere that the above gear (so everything excluding the driver) is ~5 kg. So once above ~160-170 lb, driver weight starts to become a factor that will ultimately result in time lost. It's something like .03 seconds per lap for every extra kg of weight.\n\nAs for conditioning, I think neck and leg strength are the main concerns, other than general endurance. F1 drivers notoriously have thick necks, given the unique strain F1 racing places on the neck."", ""I'm also from southern US.\n\nI highly recommend watching the season in review documentaries on the old seasons. Great entertainment and will give you just about all of the history."", ""Hi welcome to F1! Glad to have you! \n\n1) yes the engine regulations have changed several times which is why they sound different. There is quite a noticeable noise difference between the current V6 engines and the previous V8 and V10 with many people preferring the loudness of previous years so you're not alone in that opinion lol\n\n2) yes F1 is considered the billionaire boys club unfortunately it is extremely hard to get into without having money, family connections or both. The money involved is quite nauseating with karting costing hundreds of thousands of pounds and a season in the lower formulas (F2, F3, F4) costing £1-2 million. Drivers who are the exception to the rule are normally considered to be Lewis Hamilton and Esteban Ocon. There are others who might also fall into that category but these two are the ones who have talked about it at length for example it's well known that Ocon's parents sold their house and the garage attached (Ocon's dad was a mechanic) to fund his career and for several years the three of them lived in a caravan travelling to races across Europe. \n\n3) weirdly fitness didn't used to be such a focus of the sport and it's really only since the 90s to 2000s that drivers started really focusing on becoming as fit as possible so the further back you go the more likely you are to find drivers that are not the type you'd see today. Keke Rosberg is the one that immediately came to mind - he won the Championship in 1982 - but there might be others too\n\n4) Austin definitely. Everyone says it has such a good atmosphere and of course it's a proper circuit. Miami would probably be quite expensive considering celebrities seem to have taken it over and Las Vegas would be a night race so probably not the best for a family (assuming you have kids) also it's normally very cold so not the best to be sitting around the grandstands in."", 'Also from the Southern US!  I recommend COTA for a race in the US.  Great atmosphere and the races are generally very good.  Plus it’s a sprint weekend,  so more racing bang for your buck!\n\nI went to COTA in 2024 and had an amazing time!  Before you travel to a race, make sure you check out  \nr/GrandPrixTravel.
