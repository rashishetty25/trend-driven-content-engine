I think it has to be what if Kubica didn’t injure himself and actually went to Ferrari in 2012? Could have Ferrari won the constructors in 2012 with an Alonso-Kubica lineup? Maybe even Kubica could get the 2012 title. Alonso and Hamilton even praised his driving ability. It’s a shame we never saw his peak in F1. At least he’s doing well in WEC and Le Mans. ","[""What if Frentzen had taken the '99 title in that Jordan?"", 'What if Ricciardo stayed with Red Bull and Honda? Would he have looked the same as Gasly/Albon in 2019/2020? Or would he continue to get a couple of wins and podiums like before?', ""What if Schumacher didn't get on the ski slope that day? For me he is the best driver that I've seen.

What would 3 car teams even look like."", '""Maybe even Kubica could get the 2012 title.""\n\nLet\'s calm down. Alonso in one of the best seasons ever produced by anyone in F1 history couldn\'t do it, and you think Kubica could extract even more from the car in his first season in a new team ?\n\nI rate Kubica highly but I don\'t think he ever was a Hamilton/Alonso level driver. Heidfeld kept him honest from 2006 to 2009, he was fairly close.', ""I'm showing my age - but for me, it's what it Jim Clark hadnt been killed at Hockenheim in 68. \n\nCan you imagine Jim in a Lotus 72? I could easily imagine another three championships & some incredible battles with Stewart in the early 70's.  Not to mention that following his death, Colin Chapman took a long time to recover, and if anything Lotus underperformed for several years in terms of the innovation they were so good at in that era. \n\nIt's hard to imagine Jim being happy to race basically the same car for 5 seasons so I can't believe Lotus would have stuck with the 72 for as long as they did, despite how good it was - so had he lived in sure there would have been something better coming along in 72 or so and perhaps even something like the Lotus 78 would be ushering in the ground effect era a few years before Lotus eventually did it in 1977.\n\nOnce Jim died, drivers were just employees to Colin Chapman, whereas Clark was a major force within the team, pushing it forward always. Had he survived, the entire 1970's would have been very different in my opinion."", 'Kubica raced in f1 with 1 functional arm.
