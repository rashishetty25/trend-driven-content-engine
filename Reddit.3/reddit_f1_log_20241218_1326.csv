I said in my recent post on 1992-2003 that there seemed to be two versions of Eddie at Ferrari - one was a great competitive spirit that could take points away from Michael‚Äôs rivals and the other was miles off the pace. \n\nHowever, he started off at Ferrari with a car that was not particularly good and reportedly had very little opportunity to test in his first year or so at Maranello.

I don‚Äôt think I need to say how vastly different every region of Africa is and when you look at the most likely candidates in my opinion this divide is clearly shown.

Obviously South Africa has always been the frontrunner since Kyalami used to host F1 but not only does the country seem unstable at times (I haven‚Äôt kept up but I remember protests at one point) but South Africa is very different to most countries. Then you have Rwanda who seem to be leading the race now and seem to be the most economically stable country in Africa and most realistic host. Watching football I‚Äôve seen their advertising all over Arsenal and it seems they‚Äôre going a step further now but once again Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia. And the final option which is by far the least realistic but it‚Äôs just the reality of having a race in this continent would be an Egyptian GP but as you can imagine the divide is biggest at the North of Africa and it would be seen as another desert race. I only include it because it‚Äôs the most well known African country and has a history vastly greater than any desert race we currently have. Beyond these 3 options I can‚Äôt think of anything else, maybe a Moroccan GP since they seem to be hosting the WC with Spain and Portugal and at the most extreme push Senegal for being the closest possible option West Africa has.

 I think a lot of people have this idea that we can just start having races anywhere in Africa to represent the continent but it is beyond unrealistic to start hosting races in West Africa, East Africa and most of North Africa so why force one race to tick the continent off when it‚Äôs not really proper representation. I feel like only die hard Kyalami fans would be pushing for it otherwise there is little interest. Personally, I‚Äôd rather countries focus their efforts towards their people rather than paying ridiculous money to host an F1 event which is why I kept the options as realistic as possible. So for me it‚Äôs not worth forcing an F1 race here where one race can‚Äôt possibly please even a fifth of the continent (it‚Äôs not as simple as hosting Melbourne for Australia) and the options that exist mostly don‚Äôt exist apart from Kyalami yet the most realistic option still will be a soulless Rwandan GP. ","[""Personally I think that races should be awarded based on how much the host country/city can actually viably support the race and how many actual fans from the locality will get to see the race in person, as well as the general appeal of the race to the existing F1 fan base.\n\nMaybe hosting a race in Africa could bring in a large fan base, but if the race isn't likely to be run for more than a couple years and they stop because of the expense, then it's probably not a great idea to host a race there.\n\nAlso, with 24 races,  we are approaching the point at which we don't really have time for more races. So the question becomes which race gets cancelled to make room for a race in Africa?"", 'About as important as having a race anywhere else. It‚Äôs a sport, a show, purely for entertainment and money.', ""> However, I don‚Äôt see how simply adding one race to this continent helps almost anything except for checking Africa off the list\n\nWell, they're not going to add a dozen new races all at once so arguing that they should add multiple is a nonstarter that only delays getting races into the continent. They should just add a race and see how popular it is. Popularity will determine if they add more races to the area.\n\nI would remind you that there is only one race in South America, and five in North America. (Two races in South America if we're going by Marko's reckoning.)\n\n>Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia.\n\nOmg who cares about 'representing all of Asia/Africa'?
