1m7gfbg,"I Drove a Real F1 Car at Magny-Cours ‚Äî Full Experience, Cost, Driving Impressions (w/ Video)",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m7gfbg/i_drove_a_real_f1_car_at_magnycours_full/,2025-07-23, Discussion,"So today I got to live out a lifelong dream and drove a real F1 car around the Magny-Cours Grand Prix circuit. This is an unapologetically long post for anyone curious about what it actually entails‚Äîcost, experience, driving impressions, and more. There‚Äôs a video link down below, and I‚Äôll do my best to answer any questions you‚Äôve got!

Big thanks to my incredible wife and family for making this dream a reality for my 40th birthday. ü•π

**TL;DR:**

Yes, it‚Äôs every bit as awesome as you imagine‚Äîand totally worth it.

# Cost:

Let‚Äôs get this part out of the way: it‚Äôs not cheap.

* Formula Renault: 2x 15-minute sessions
* F1 Car: 1 out lap + 3 flying laps
* Price: \~‚Ç¨2800 total
* Insurance: ‚Ç¨8000 excess if you crash the F1 car
   * Optional insurance available for ‚Ç¨350 to reduce excess to ‚Ç¨4000
   * I skipped it. My strategy was simple: don‚Äôt crash.

# Briefing & Organisation:

As a non-French speaker, I was a bit nervous about language barriers‚Äîbut the staff were amazing. They went out of their way to make sure I was fully included, even doing dual-language briefings just for me.

They also gave me a personal track guide with an instructor, while the French attendees were grouped 8 to a minibus. I got to ask loads of questions!

The briefings were solid, with useful instruction on things like weight transfer and the grip circle‚Äîa helpful way of visualizing how lateral loads impact traction.

# The Track ‚Äì Magny-Cours:

One of the main reasons I picked this experience was the track. Not many F1 driving experiences let you drive on a real Grand Prix circuit‚Äîbut Magny-Cours absolutely is one.

* Long straights where you can go flat out
* Proper heavy braking zones
* Wide range of corners
* Cones marked braking, turn-in, apex, and exit points
* No restrictions on pace‚Äîcoaching was designed to help you go faster, not just stay safe

After this, Magny-Cours is now one of my favorite tracks.

# The Cars:

**Formula Renault**

These are not slow.  
Acceleration was wild, but the car was approachable enough to build confidence. Still had more than enough power to bite‚Äîmultiple people spun during the morning.

By the end of my sessions, I felt like I was really starting to explore the car‚Äôs limits.

**F1 Car ‚Äì Benetton B198**

* 1998 Benetton B198 chassis
* Original V10 replaced with a 3.5L Cosworth HB V8 (same spec Schumacher used to win the 1994 title)
* Still over 600hp
* No joke.

# The Driving Experience:

Their starter was broken, so I got a push start‚Äîold school!

* Launch: 2nd gear, clutch in, exactly 5% throttle (displayed on the wheel), then clutch drop on command‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre driving a freaking F1 car.
* Gearbox: Paddle shifts are violent‚Äîinstant upshifts, jarring downshifts. Get it done in a straight line if you can.
* Braking: After being told to ‚Äústop braking like a grandma‚Äù in the Renault, I overcooked it and locked up on my first fast lap (big smokey lock up...). Backed it off slightly after that. Still, incredible stopping power.
* Steering: Heavy. After 4 laps, my arms were toast. These big tyres don‚Äôt turn themselves.
* Power: It‚Äôs not the original V10, but it‚Äôs still ferocious. I applied the same throttle I had in the Renault‚Ä¶ then found another couple of centimetres of pedal travel and entered warp speed. You‚Äôll hear in the video when I hit the ‚Äúparty zone‚Äù of the throttle‚Äîit just goes.
* Cornering felt solid, but I was cautious with throttle application‚Äî‚Ç¨8000 reasons not to spin...

# Post-Lap Emotions:

When I got out, I was literally shaking from adrenaline. Genuinely got emotional‚Äîtears and all. It was one of those rare life moments where the dream actually lives up to the hype.

# The Video:

I wasn‚Äôt going for lap records‚ÄîI pushed as much as my wallet would let me. Please be kind, but critique away:

He's one of my favorite drivers, but I'm curious to hear from those who followed the sport back when he was promoted‚Äîhow was it received at the time? Was he seen as an obvious choice, or did it come as a surprise?","[""Naturally I think. The thing is Rosberg's retirement came out of nowhere. He literally won the title and retired. Everyone expected him to be at Mercedes for the next few years. So when it happen, Toto had to work fast. Bottas was, and still his, managed by him and he was seen back them as potential world champion by some, and if not, a really fast driver by others. So it was the natural choice."", 'He was the obvious choice. He was a massively exciting prospect, handpicked by Frank Williams and lived up to the hype in his rookie season of 2013 (especially in Canada/USA) in a terrible car. Then he was consistently fighting for podiums in 2014-2016 and was managed by Toto Wolf so everyone knew he was the next in line. Nobody expected it to come so soon with Rosberg retiring, but it was an obvious move.', 'It was a bit of a no brainer given the timing. It was really clear that Bottas was fast, he was performing well in the williams at a time when williams were performing ok. They needed a driver fast, there was already the strong relationship between Merc and williams, who else would they go for?', ""So Rosberg's exit was a massive shock to everyone including Mercedes\n\nThey had no backup plan\n\nPretty much everyone at that point was tied down, locked in a contract. Though Toto said pretty much every F1 driver bar 2 phoned him about the seat (Kimi Raikkonen & Danil Kyvat).\n\nThere was some memes and jokes from Max and Mercedes twitter account about Max replacing Nico. But obviously this was not that serious, Max was not leaving Red Bull and Red Bull would not let Max break his contract anyway, and some people were hopeful Alonso would get the seat, but again in a contract (and also spygate).\n\nThe only feasible option was Pascal Werhlein the Mercedes junior driver who was in Manor. Manor was a Mercedes customer team and Mercedes got to choose one of the drivers for a manor seat as part of the deal.\n\nThe problem with Pascal is he was a rookie in 2016 and only had 1 years experience. So Mercedes were concerned he did not have enough experience, so they were also exploring the option of paying Williams to release Bottas from his contract. Bottas was chosen as an alternate option because Williams were a team that financially would probably accept a monetary offer to break a driver contract (Ferrari and Red Bull wouldn't) and Bottas was seen as a good driver, future top team material.\n\nBottas was THE BEST driver Mercedes had a reasonable chance of breaking the contract on\n\nHowever it was obviously still a very expensive option, because you have to pay Williams as well as Bottas.\n\nWhen it became clear these were the 2 options Mercedes were exploring. People were very much hoping Mercedes would go for Bottas, fearing Werhlein would mean a boring F1 Season with Hamilton having no challenge, But people were skeptical Mercedes would spend the money to break Bottas contract\n\nWhen they did go for Bottas i think some people were pleasantly surprised, and very happy about it. Despite dominating Mercedes had garnered a lot of good faith (particularly after Bahrain 2014) from the fans for allowing their 2 drivers to race and allowing 2 strong drivers . The decision to go for Bottas was seen as more of this policy of going for 2 strong drivers."", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/5oauej/valtteri_bottas_confirmed_to_drive_for_mercedes/\n\nReddit thread from when this was announced.', 'I remember the great story at the time that literally every driver phoned Toto except Raikkonen.', ""I remember my first thought being that it made sense, though I've often wondered what Wherlein would have done.\n\nThe funniest part of it though was Massa unretiring, especially after his big emotional farewell in Brazil."", 'I remember thinking that both hulkenberg and Mercedes missed out on each other by a few months', 'Thought it was quite an obvious move at the time especially with Rosberg retiring quite late and Bottas being managed by Wolff']",973,283,0.96,973,7723,7723,6,0,0.0,6

And he's had suggestions of his own; he's sent documents to the team detailing with his own inputs on the direction for 2026.¬†

""I was at the factory two weeks, a couple days each week. We did preparation, naturally going over where we were on the previous race, things that we need to change.

""I hold a lot of meetings, so I've called on lots of meetings with the heads of the team, so I've sat with John, Benedetto and Fred in several meetings. I've sat with the head of our car development, with Loic, with also the heads of different departments, talking about engine for next year, talking about front suspension for next year, talking about rear suspension for next year, things that you want, issues that you have, that I have with this car.

""I've sent documents, so I've done through the year. After the first few races, I did a full document for the team. Then during this break, I had another two documents that I sent in, and so then I come in and want to address those. Some of its structural adjustments that we need to make as a team in order to get better, and all the areas that we want to improve, and then the other one was really about the car, the current issues that I have with this car.""

How come Hamilton has got so involved with his inputs for 2026? Perhaps he feels he's not got much time left in F1, so wants to make his mark as he angles for an eighth title.

""The reason for it is that I see a huge amount of potential within this team, the passion - nothing comes close. It is a huge organisation with a lot of moving parts, but parts are not firing on all the cylinders that they need to be. That's ultimately why the team hasn't had the success I feel it deserves.

""I feel it's my job to challenge every area and challenge everybody in the team, especially the guys at the top who are making the decision. If you look at the team in the last 20 years, they've had amazing drivers - Kimi, Fernando, Sebastian. I refuse for that to be the case with me.

She went to tons of races back in the day, including motorcycle events, and was a big James Hunt supporter.

The craziest part? She was actually at the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji ‚Äì one of the most legendary and dramatic races in F1 history. The rain-soaked title decider where Lauda retired early and Hunt fought through the chaos to finish just high enough to win the championship by a single point. She was there, live in the stands.

It honestly blows my mind that someone in my own family experienced that moment firsthand. And motorsport love clearly runs deep in my family ‚Äì my other grandparents are big fans too. They still watch every F1, MotoGP, and just about any major race on TV to this day.

Edit:

Oh, and I just remembered ‚Äì the man my grandma later married is from a family that‚Äôs actually related to Christian Klien, the Austrian F1 driver. But that was way before Christian Klien became a F1 driver. So yeah‚Ä¶ turns out motorsport really does run through all kinds of branches in my family!
