That was actually really cool and I hope they do that type of shot in more races. That’s how they should use drones if they do plan on using it more\n\nBut I still think they should either scrap or rotate Monaco with Spa since they’ve already confirmed that’s a thing. Fundamentally cars can’t overtake here and mandating more pit stops won’t fix it. The only stakeholders who like are the sponsors, winner of the race, organisers of the race and the VIPs who attend\n\nEveryone knows it’s garbage for racing. Don’t forget this is a race with a significantly shorter total distance than that’s required as well.

So instead of trying to fix the race with things like 2 mandatory pit stops, why not double down on the part of the weekend everyone actually likes?\n\nI think the Monaco GP should become a time attack event instead of a race. Move FP1+2 to Saturday, skip FP3, and have an extra-long qualifying session in the race's time slot. Use a similar elimination format to normal qualifying sessions (maybe with 5 rounds instead of 3?) and award points using the same system as the races (ie.  25 for pole, 18 for 2nd, etc). The finishing order of the race is mostly determined by qualifying anyway, so this is just cutting out the middleman."", ""McLaren did relatively well this weekend, Norris did what he had to do to salvage points for the weekend. What a stellar drive. I wouldn't say he was faultless but his drive essentially gave him the victory. The qualifying lap was also worth shouting out as well, though. While I do feel like I am unable to tell how this speaks for Norris's future qualifying sessions considering this is rather track-specific, and the TD *(which shouldn't affect them, per their statement but i'll watch closely either way)* is arriving next week, this is what was needed for the weekend \n\nI say that because as much as the race was still somewhat loose by the seams in turns of entertainment value, it takes a different kind of approach to ensure that you stay afloat in Monaco. With attention to all drivers in this regard, I doubt it is as easy it looks. Verstappen did what he had to do, as a competitor, by bunching up the field, leaving Norris to the pressure cooker that is by ensuring Leclerc stays behind and ensuring nothing happens to warrant a crash. Yes, Leclerc wasn't going to get past him *(in looks to the radio that Norris was slow, now we know it's because he was bunched up)* but that is the challenge, innit? I imagine that keeping your head on your shoulders while remaining patient and focused are part of the parcel of being a well-rounded driver, and if you rise up to the task, then hell yeah!\n\nI want to show my appreciation for Piastri too. While this is not the best of weekends for him, he kept it consistent, slightly playing defense towards the end, and he brought the podium back to Woking. Like I said, it may sound pedantic to suggest otherwise, but it is easy to get it wrong in Monaco if you are not careful, so the fact he kept it solid was good! \n\nChampionship gap's getting narrower once more. To that, I say, I commend both the McLaren boys in keeping respectful while pushing each other in the pursuit of maximizing the results. I'll repeat myself: this team has an amazing driver line-up in their hands with two fantastic and talented drivers in their own regard. I'll speak for myself here but it is easy to forget that this is such when title battles are at play, and at the end of it all, if there is a show for a tussle and it is all under good strides, then I'm probably the biggest winner of them all"", 'Just posted this in another thread but I wanna hear what people think\n\nOne thought I had during the Williams/Mercedes debacle: when Antonelli went straight through the chicane and passed Albon, what was stopping him from simply staying ahead, taking a penalty, and backing up the field while Russell served his drive through and pitted twice?

If Williams are gaming the system you might as well try to do it back to them', ""For the record, I think the two-stopper added at least some unpredictability to the race, which is at least an improvement over the debacle we had last year.

1kw8ns9,Imola: Suggested Changes,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kw8ns9/imola_suggested_changes/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"I had posted a moment ago with images of my suggestion but the Auto Mod removed it under grounds that it my post had links in it, which it didn't? Anyway..

So I'm well aware that Imola has now dropped off the calendar but I still think about how the circuit could be improved. We did see some overtaking this year which was great but, still feel more could be done.

As Imola is surrounded by either river or buildings there's not much you can do making massive layout changes, there are also buildings and sports facilities on the inside of the circuit to consider as well.

My main suggestion is to remove the Variante Alta Chicane entirely to provide a nice straight from Acqua Minerali to the first Rivazza. This chicane seems a bit out of place these days and I don't think removing it would take the essence of the circuit away, whilst improving the racing.

I also feel that modifying the Rivazzas to provide a heavy braking zone for cars approaching the twin corners should be considered but even leaving them as they are should still provide an extra opportunity to overtake with Variante Alta gone.

What are your thoughts?","['The tracks are fine, just make the cars smaller and lighter and the racing will improve a lot', ""Imola is gone. No point talking about it.

Any mistakes or collision at Tabac (very likely since it would now be a super heavy braking zone with overtaking opportunity) will be very dangerous.', 'On the surface I like that idea but you need a place for runoff at the end of the straight for all that speed, and cars side by side in the tunnel could be catastrophic.', ""The chicane is the only place where they can pass, and it's there for safety reasons"", ""DRS doesn't matter since it's gone next year in favor of active aero."", 'Yes.\xa0']",0,10,0.15,0,9,9,0,0,-0.05000000000000002,0
1kw7b69,Why do people think Alonso is washed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kw7b69/why_do_people_think_alonso_is_washed/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"I keep seeing the narrative that Alonso is washed yet if anything he is better than he was in 2023, where he was voted second best driver of the year by team principles - the car is just worse now. His pace gap in qualifying to Stroll is around 4 tenths, slightly larger than in pervious years together. He hasnt been outqualified since halfway through last year, and I genuinely struggle to remember when he has been outright slower than Stroll without some kind of external reason like floor damage in the entire time they've been teammates. 

The idea that he makes more mistakes is potentially only true when comparing to his absolute peak in 2011-2014 but he has actually made very few genuine mistakes this year and has generally just been very unlucky. Australia has the caveat of the huge amount of gravel on track and the only real mistake was a spin while running 15th in Miami. 

Most people who argue he is washed say that he simply has a bad benchmark, however I would say he has a particularly good benchmark as Stroll was teammates to Massa, Alonos longest standing teammate, and the pace gaps are very coherent when compared, with Massa generally slightly closer to Alonso in his prime years (around 3 tenths) whereas Massa and Stroll were quite evenly matched together, despite Stroll being new to the sport. 

I urge anyone who genuinely thinks that he is washed to give me evidence for it in the replies, I would like to hear your logic behind it, that doesn't just rely on the obvious downgrade of the Astons these last couple of years or simply stating the fact he is old.

All that F1 would need to do is to create a Monaco specific PU rule which is to disallow using any battery in the GP, *except* for when you're the car behind and using manual override.

Since it's significantly more powerful than DRS with hundreds of horsepower of an advantage over a car not using any energy and could be activated anywhere, I could see it being possible to line up a move on the pit straight or into the chicane.

1kvon1d,Is Antonelli performing beneath expectations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvon1d/is_antonelli_performing_beneath_expectations/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"This post might bring controversy, but I think young Kimi is performing slightly worse than expected, further overshadowed by all the praise about Hadjar recently. So far he has less than half the points of GR, 0-10 vs GR in race/sprint h2h, and 2-8 in qualifying h2h.

GR is great, and honestly I don’t think race pace, mistakes, (like losing the lead at the sprint) or even crashes are worrying, but it’s the raw pace that he has yet to show. In my understanding, speed is mostly not taught, and most great drivers become competitive in qualifying just about immediately. I think it is slightly concerning that Kimi has mostly struggled with qualifying thus far other than in Miami.

Can anyone who has followed him through his junior career give some input on how we should view his performance thus far?
