Ferrari need to change their approach because all they seem to care about is race position, rather than what track conditions are like. This goes for the drivers too because in such situations, the drivers are the ones battling the conditions and can tell what they can handle or not. 

They need to be more firm just as Russell and Verstappen were about what needed to happen, else they won't ever change cause it's been happening for years. I'm surprised Hamilton wasn't more decisive but I suppose new team new relationship so he was still learning how the atmosphere would be like.

Bono took charge with Kimi and was understandably so. Same with Stoll, his engineer mostly made the calls and he never seemed like the type to care that much. Hulk put his experience hat on.

As for Norris and McLaren, they clearly learned from previous situations because both Lando and Will could tell that the type of rain that fell, will obviously not dry for the remainder of the race.

I can see how he would work well with Stroll. \n\nI'm usually on Lando's, Max's, and Oscar's radios every race, and I decided to hop on other onboards after the last race. The communication styles are so different, and you can tell who have an understanding already and who don't. You can also kind of tell who has higher expectations of their pit wall/strategy team. \n\nAlso, just because there's an understanding or personal relationship already doesn't mean that things go perfectly. This wasn't broadcasted but Max was mildly unhappy that the team didn't pit him for inters a lap before they did. I'm sure he would have been more unhappy if he hadn't been in P2 by then already. \n\nI think both Max and Lando have personal relationships with their engineers, but the trust levels about the teams' strategies in the rain may be different. Max didn't ask a lot of questions about the incoming rain. I'm not sure if he even asked any. Lando, on the other hand, asked for every detail, made his preferred strategy clear, and even reiterated it again. (I'm willing to consider that this was perhaps a trauma response though, given how often McLaren has messed up his strategy in the rain. 😅)\n\nRussell's engineer serves as a good contrast to Lewis's. George was told how many positions he would lose beforehand while Lewis had to ask after the fact. In fact, I feel like that was Ferrari's main issue. They keep talking about unimportant things before the important things. Leclerc's engineer rattled off the tires everyone was going on before they even talked about what tire Charles wanted to be on. And it's like he hadn't even intended to ask what Charles wanted."", 'A good race engineer can make a real splash', 'Some very strong reactionism going on here.', 'I thought my brain was playing tricks on me when I heard Bortoleto\'s radio and thought I heard Lando\'s old performance engineer/deputy race engineer, Jose.

I thought I heard him talk to a ""Xavi.""', ""I think having Bono also helped contribute to Kimi's good race, Bono is a very experienced engineer, and speaks very clearly and directly, which no doubt helps as Kimi is a non native English speaker."", ""I was wondering how much of a factor Gary Gannon was to Lance's good performance, good to see some actual quotes from Lance on that"", 'I don\'t think it\'s as bad as everyone\'s making out. It\'s the first race with a brand new engineer after having the same one for over a decade, as well as more of a language barrier. I have a feeling that the message of ""leave me to it"" might not have translated across properly.\n\nThere\'s only so much you can do in testing. It\'s impossible to recreate the pressure of a race, particularly in the rain.\n\nI\'m sure they\'ll improve things quickly.', 'Oh yeah nobody knew about that before.', ""Gary Gannon is the absolute GOAT race engineer.

1jehq65,Every Driver on the current grids worst season in F1.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jehq65/every_driver_on_the_current_grids_worst_season_in/,2025-03-18, Discussion,"Ok so last week I made a post about every drivers best season in F1. Now I'm gong through what I think is their worst. I'd be really interested to hear your opinion and what you agree/disagree with. 


Max Verstappen - 2015 -
Yeah so Max is pretty hard to choose because all of his seasons have been impressive. While his worst spell was at the start of 2018 he was great for most of that year which is why I have gone for his first season 2015. While he had some amaizmg drives he did make some errors like crashing out in Monaco and Silverstone and Sainz often was faster than him.

Liam Lawson - 2024 - So out of just two options 2023 was more impressive. 2024 did also have some good drives (COTA) his qualifying deficit to Yuki and his spin in Qatar hold him back. 

Lando Norris - 2019 - This is very difficult because all of his seasons have been impressive. However I have put 2019 as his worst as Sainz usually outraced him. That said Lando had a lot of bad luck in 2019. 

Oscar Piastri - 2023 - 
So like Lawson there is only two options and Oscar was more impressive in 2024 than 2023. Yes he was great in races like Qatar but he often wrecked his tyres and could not usually compare to Lando in race pace. 

Charles Leclerc - 2023 - This was really hard to pick because Leclerc's seasons are all pretty good. Every year bar 2024 he has either been in a midfield car or had terrible luck. Ultimately I narrowed it down to 2020 and 2023 but despite his many high profile mistakes in 2020 his demolition of Vettel and what he did with that car made it better so I put 2023 here because Carlos was often faster than him. That said it was still a decent year that was just plagued by bad luck. 

Lewis Hamilton (2024) 
For most of his career it has been said that his worst year was 2011, when he had a strange obsession with colliding with Massa and was defeated by Button. However his wins in China and Germany are two of his best. 2024 though was ended with a few of the worst performances of his career (USA, Brazil, Qatar) and he 
was very poor in qualifying. 

George Russell (2023) Not a very difficult choice imo. Every other year he has defeated his team mates but in 2023 Hamilton was easily better than him and finished five places higher in the standings. George also made a lot of costly errors, Canada and Singapore his most spectacular. 

Andrea Kimi Antonelli (N/A) 

Fernando Alonso (2017) 
Yeah all of Alonso's other seasons were too good to pick (I found out too hard to judge 2001 seeing as he was in a Minardi) so I just settled on this one. Vandoorne faired fairly well against him compared to how Alonso often demolishes his team mates. 

Lance Stroll (2024) 
In previous years Stroll had had his big mistakes, but also the odd moment where he becomes prime Senna. 2024 didn't really have many of those moments and his only real highlights were in his strong stretch from Canada to Hungary, peaking with Silverstone. However his embarrassing moments in Saudi Arabia, China and Brazil detract from the good moments and leave 2024 as his worst year. 

Gasly (2022) So Gasly's years are usaually filled with high highs and low lows. 2022 is an exception. Most of this is because the car was slower and I couldn't put 2019 because of his great podium in Brazil and some of the preceding races. 

Doohan (2024) Doenst really count though. Also I'm not counting 2025. 

Ocon (2020) After two impressive years at Force India Ocon's return to F1 with Renault was quite slow and steady. Ricciardo fairly easily beat Esteban who struggled to rediscover some of the raw pace he'd had before. 

Bearman (2024) Both his best and worst year. 

Tsunoda (2022) IMO Yuki was lucky to keep his drive after that season ( he's turned into a very good driver since). In 2021 he made a lot of mistakes but also had some great performances. In 2022 the car didn't really allow for great performance sand Yuki didn't help with some big errors. He crashed into his team mate at Silverstone just after he's crahsed coming out of the pits in Canada. He also had a sizeable crash in Singapore. 

Hadjar - N/A - 

Albon - 2020 - Albon struggled both pace wise and on the mental side in 2020 as Max challenged the Mercs but Alex struggled to beat the midfield. After a strong but unlucky first race he seemed to be on for a bright year. However he quickly began having bad qualifying sessions, colliding with other drivers (KMAG in Silverstone, Kvyat in Germany) and just making big mistakes such as spinning in Imola and Turkey.

Sainz (2022) 
2018 is obvious answer but he made more high profile mistakes in 2022 as he struggled to adapt to new cars. In Australia he had bad qualifying sessions, bad start and spun out by himself on lap 2. He crahsed in Qualifying in Imola, had a big crash in Miami practice, he went off into gravel in Spain race. Later on he also crashed by himself a few corners into Japanese Grand Prix. 
His win in Britain was also quite fortunate as he went off and let Max through before Max got a puncture because of debris and then Leclerc was faster but left out on old tyres under safety car.

Hulkenburg - 2019 - 
After topping the midfield in 2018 Nico Hulkenburg ended up finding himself without a seat on the grid for 2020 because of his poor 2019 season. Whenever Hulkenburg got a decent points scoring result Ricciardo was usaually ahead and when had a big chance to take his first podium at his home race in Germany he spun off. 
He also just lacked pace quite often like in Brazil when he finished outside the points despite most of the top drivers screwing up.

Personally in my opinion the current grid is the best it has ever been in terms of talent but I'd definitely be open to the idea of being corrected.

You have absolute top tier talents in Verstappen, Leclerc, Hamilton, Russell, Norris, Piastri, Alonso, Sainz etc..the level below them as well is still extremely strong.
