Hi everyone! Don’t know if this is allowed here but I thought it might interest a few people.

I started getting into F1 in the offseason after 2022 thanks to YouTube constantly pushing FormulaBone videos at me until I finally caved. My first season actually watching every race was 2023. Even though that season was an inadvertent way to memorize the Dutch national anthem, I really enjoyed watching week after week, following the storylines online, and I became hooked, I’ve been watching ever since.
As I dove deeper into the world of F1, I discovered that apparently, the 2021 season is worth watching and some even consider it the best season of F1 of all time (I’m sure that’s debatable). Since this season is almost at its end and I’ve grown impatient waiting for Las Vegas this weekend, I decided I would finally start watching the 2021 season from start to finish. On top of that, I figured I’d document my thoughts while watching every race, maybe it’ll amuse a lot of you on here. So, I’m just gonna write down my thoughts as I watch this race. I don’t really have a schedule of when I’ll watch all the races, but the holidays are upon us as well, that gives me a chance to watch a lot more too.

ROUND 1: BAHRAIN

-Wow, baby Max

-Huge expectations on Lewis to win the 8th, but from the beginning the commentators are making it clear that this season is Lewis vs. Max

-Oh, hi Christian Horner! (Rip)

-Weird seeing Russell in a Williams, I didn’t realize that’s where he was before Mercedes

-There are so many drivers I haven’t seen before: Bottas in a Mercedes (I’m excited for him and Checo in Cadillac next year), Vettel, Danny Ric in a McLaren, Kimi (how worth it is it to watch the 2008 season?), Giovinazzi (who?), Lattiffi (I’ve heard him called 🐐-tiffi), Mick Schumacher, and Mazepin

-Crazy to think that face masks were a thing in F1, I hadn’t thought about that

-Formation lap, dammit Checo…you just got to Red Bull. Anyone know if his move to Red Bull was largely attributed to his win in Sahkir from 2020? He’s starting from the pit lane right now.

-Oh, now I know why they called him Maze-spin…

-VSC must have been new this season, Martin Brundle clearly doesn’t like them in the broadcast

-These graphics are so cool, I kinda wish they’d use them today.

-So was Mercedes on a high of building good cars? This Mercedes looks amazing compared to what I’ve seen.

-Oh shoot, Checo out here trying to prove himself, he’s up to 5th!

-I’m learning that this is the season where Alonso returned after his two year hiatus.

-Hamilton back in 1st, weird seeing him there but then I realize he’s the 7-time champion, I missed the Hamilton era.

-I wonder why Mick’s abbreviation is “MSC” instead of “SCH”? Maybe he didn’t want to use the abbreviation his dad used?

-Why isn’t Lewis using the #1? I thought the champion used #1 in the livery? Max in a #33 feels weird lol

-Yuki with a spiky haircut makes him look like a high schooler

-Stroll is beating Vettel…odd.

-I want to explain that I know how this season ends, I know that the last race was very controversial. But I feel like watching the whole season will provide all the context as to why this season was so divisive. I’m excited to see the progression.

-Checo is not doing bad for debuting with Red Bull. Checo is my favorite driver #Mexico and I’m excited for him to return but this being his first season in Red Bull will be cool to see. I’m also aware that this is the season where he earned the nickname “The Mexican Minister of Defense”, let’s see why. Not a bad drive thus far being at lap 27/56.

-Checo used to be teammates with Lance???

-What’s up with these new regulations that they keep talking about? That’s something about F1 that I still struggle to understand.

-Hamilton has been hanging on to the lead for a while here.

-Fascinating, Mercedes pitted Lewis in lap 29, now he’s down in 3rd

-Norris holding steady in 4th, I can see how he was eventually going to lead the championship like he’s doing right now.

-OH SHIT THEY FUCKED UP BOTTAS’S PIT STOP 10.9 SECOND PIT STOP

-Damn that sucked, Bottas down in 5th

-Verstappen with a 20 second lead? What is this, 2023??? /s

-Toto with a face mask is somehow very menacing

-Ferrari finished 6th in 2020? Wth???

-Alonso retiring in a race…so this is where it started? Lap 34/56

-Hamilton is quite vocal on the radio, looks like that’s just always how he’s been. Probably a good quality to have from a driver, communicative and always giving feedback. I’m happy to see he continues to do this in Ferrari.

-CHECO IN 4TH WOOT WOOT

-At the beginning of the race during the grid lineup Crofty pointed out that Yuki was lining up next to Kimi, youngest driver next to the oldest driver. Weird to think that at some point there was a driver older than Alonso on the grid.

-They’re talking about a 3 pit strategy…3? Was that common back then? Or is it a Bahrain thing? Nowadays I don’t think that’s common, right? Or maybe I’m just blind?

-I’m sure I can Google this but Carlos used to be teammates with Lando, right? Why did Ferrari pick up Sainz? 

-For the botched pit stop from earlier, Bottas is back up in 3rd.

-Lap 40/56, Hamilton back in the lead with a an 8.6 second gap for now.

-5111 laps…that was Michael Schumacher’s record of laps lead in a career and apparently Lewis just broke that record in this race. They also alluded to 2020 being a record-breaking season for Lewis. It’s kinda cool seeing and hearing all that after being so used to just hearing about Max and Red Bull dominance in the last three years.

-You can see the good chemistry between GP and Max…how long have those two been working together?

-Lap 43/56, there it is 5112 laps led by Lewis Hamilton…but Max is now 5.4 seconds behind.

-Oof, Checo catching up to Riccardo in 6th

-Is this Checo just being good? Or Checo driving a rocket ship?

-For this being Perez’s first season at Red Bull, he brought the sponsors! Telcel and Claro to name a few stand out to me. Red Bull wasted no time putting that stuff on the livery.

-Perez passes Danny Ric and he seems to be gaining on Charles, damn.

-Vettel hits Ocon in lap 45/56, damn 

-A graphic just came up saying Hamilton is at 95 career wins so far…I remember last year that Lewis won Silverstone that was win 104 or 114, right? Excited to see some Hamilton wins as I go through this season.

-Max cutting the gap to 3.3 seconds with ten laps to go, geez.

-Perez is 4.3 seconds from Leclerc

-It’s looking like this race is coming down to the wire, Max 2.5 seconds from Lewis lap 48/56

-Checo is just flying! 3.2 seconds from Leclerc!

-“Leave me to it Bono” Lewis has a trend of not liking it when they update him mid race. Just leave him to it dude lol

-Lap 50/56 Max 1.4 seconds from Lewis omg

-Commentators just mentioned Honda, is 2021 the first year Honda partnered with RB?

-Hamilton goes wide in turn 10! Max 1.054 seconds behind!

-Wtf happened to the car? Is it really the tires? Lewis’s tired are apparently 10 laps older than Max’s.

-Damn, first race of the season and it’s a nail biter.

-Perez 0.8 from Charles LFG

-Checo goes through to 5th!

-Max is 23 this season? Damn

-Max goes through! Lap 53/56 but Max went off track limits!

-Wait Max giving back a position??? What???

-Vettel with a 10 second time penalty, seems fair

-Check starting from the pit and ending in 5th is a great drive

-Hamilton is hanging on by a thread wow

-Lap 55/56 Max is 0.9 seconds behind Lewis

-FINAL LAP Max uses DRS and he’s 0.5 behind Hamilton 

-Bloody hell Lewis wins it by 0.7 seconds what a race

-If this is how 2021 starts I can’t wait for the rest of the season wow

-Looking back at the replay, probably a good decision to give Lewis the position back rather than waiting for the stewards to say something

-Amazing win from Lewis but that Mercedes doesn’t look all that strong…foreshadowing???

Alright, that concludes this first round of the 2021 season. Thanks for following along.

Lewis kept using 44, Vettel used 1 in 2014 as he was the champ in 2013.\n\nThis is a huge wall of text by the way, it looks spam-y.', 'Oh I’m so excited, thanks for the heads up. I definitely won’t be watching the next race this weekend with Las Vegas on Saturday, and I’ve still got school and things to wrap up in the next few weeks.

Yet another thing I’m learning about F1 culture.', 'Yeah the broadcast kept alluding to Mercedes just being on this dominant run for the last seven years. Knowing how this season ends it’ll be exciting to watch what happens to Mercedes throughout the season. It’s interesting though because I thought Max’s run in 2023 was the most dominant ever. And I think it literally was, Red Bull won all races but one and Max himself won all races but three or four I think. To think Mercedes had an even faster car in 2020 sounds crazy to me.', 'Thanks! I’m excited to dive into this history, join in when you can! I’m reading comments that maybe I shouldn’t be posting a wall of text. I think for the next race I’ll just post a general blurb at the start and I’ll leave comments as I watch the race. I like sharing my thoughts as a play-by-play format because I think that’ll give people the chance to jump in and comment on thoughts I have. I’m excited to keep watching.']",0,24,0.43,0,21,21,0,24,0.43,0
1p2av9p,Why do some people hate the new chassis for the 2026 season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p2av9p/why_do_some_people_hate_the_new_chassis_for_the/,2025-11-20, Discussion,"I've seen on multiple places online that some are calling the new regulations horrible and calling the new car design too small and saying it looks like the Formula E car and the F3 car even though it doesn't look anything like them. 

Are they complaining just to complain or is the design actually bad, I'm a new fan and I don't really know what to think, in my opinion it looks like the older 2004-2008 cars but safer making tracks like Monaco actually viable to drive on as the current cars are too wide for that old close racing. 

As I said before I'm a new fan and I didn't actually see how the racing used to be, if there are any long time fans who saw the older cars in action(Sorry if my question is unclear as English isn't my first language) ","[""If you keep clicking trash content over anticipating next year you'll get trash content over-anticipating next year."", 'It’s formula one.\xa0\n\nIf things change, you’ve got people complaining. If things stay the same, you’ve got people complaining. \xa0If the tires last forever, people complain. If the tires fall off quickly, people complain. If things are changed for literal safety reasons, people still complain.\xa0\n\nIt’s not worth paying attention to or trying to find reason behind.\xa0', 'Welcome to the madhouse!\n\nFolks like to complain is probably the biggest reason lol. We\'re going from establish regs, which people don\'t generally like, lol, to something totally unknown. \n\nThe fun part of the unknown is that..we don\'t know what\'s going to happen. There\'s been a lot of fearmongering narratives that the new cars will be ""slower than F2"" etc., and honestly - that\'s just not going to happen. The cars will probably have slower lap times to start off compared to the current cars, but honestly - that\'s OK. As a casual viewer, I can tell the difference between a quali push and a race lap speed, but honestly I can\'t tell the difference between a 1:15.00 lap and a 1:16.500 lap. If we\'re a few secs/lap slower, but the wheel to wheel racing is better? Hell yeah, sign me up.', 'As a formula 1 fan since the days it was shown on the BBC, you will always get people moaning and complaining about the regulations no matter what... Bit of advice, just watch the racing and enjoy it for what it is...', 'Dont let other people tell you if you should like it or not, keep an open mind and just wait and see. You dont have any influence on the ruleset anyways.', 'The cars are so damn big, 2026 is a love in the right direction and then we need another reduction of the same amount. \n\nThen we can see where we are at but even after that probably still need another reduction in length.', '90% of the internet is people complaining about random shit. 5% is people complaining about the complainers, and the rest is memes.', "">calling the new car design too small\n\nI didn't think I'd ever see anyone wanting larger cars in F1..."", ""I do not care how they look at all. I also dont want to see the race more about battery management over a lap than driver's ability to turn/brake/exit corners. So i also hate the 2026 cars because its 100% going to resemble formula e with the added negatives of the cars also not being balanced."", ""Anyone that knows anything about F1 would agree that these cars are too big. They're shrinking by a few percent only. It's a start, but it's not enough. Anyone arguing the 2026 cars will be too small is overestimating the change and is clueless about F1 in general. \n\nThere are other arguments about energy management that might be legitimate, but even then their effect on racing will be hard to determine until we see these cars driven in anger. Right now it's all theory and speculation. Basically, don't believe anything you read if someone's predicting anything concrete. Whatever problems an average fan can imagine are the same problems teams of highly-educated and experienced F1 engineers have been putting their minds to for the last year or two. Fans know nothing.""]",0,22,0.27,0,129,129,0,0,0.0,0
