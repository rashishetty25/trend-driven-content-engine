Of course it won\'t always be perfect.\n\nCharles also says that they need to introduce more common sense in to the stewarding process and less black and white guidelines because it is impossible for the guidelines to cover every single scenario and incident. Something myself and I\'m sure others have been saying for several years now.', '> Ferrari driver Leclerc said he believes that what is critical going forward is making sure that common sense comes to the fore more, because the guidelines will never cover off perfectly every single incident.\n> \n> ""There are many, many rules, and in a sport like racing, it\'s very, very difficult to write black and white every single scenario that can happen,"" he said.\n> \n> ""I appreciate the fact that we are all trying to tackle as many situations as possible, but I feel like this is never ever going to be the case.\n> \n> ""It will rely a little bit more on the stewards feeling on certain situations...but now today we are really sticking to the book and that makes it difficult to have common sense sometimes in some specific situations.""\n\nThis is a bingo for me. The guidelines are written very rigidly, and I put zero blame on the stewards making their decisions based on what the guidelines outright say.\n\nI cannot imagine it\'s possible to rigidly outline rules for every racing scenario - I think there needs to be some vagueness for something as fluid as w2w racing.', 'The problem with the stewarding is that they are having far too much impact on race outcomes for such subjective decisions (and I’m specifically talking about contact/passes not rules like moving before the start). Stewarding and reffing should not be so visibly fucking with the sport. I’d rather see no rules and let the drivers self-enforce like nascar does than have what we have now. I think Sainz’s idea makes sense - I’d like to see one season of a PAID group of former professional drivers or expert race analysts doing the stewarding for crashes.\n\nRegular Track limits, start/stop procedures etc can be done by volunteers but not these highly impactful subjective decisions about contact/passes.', 'I don’t mean to be controversial or a contrarian but can someone give me a good reason why the current rules don’t work? I understand that it discourages pass attempts like what Piastri attempted but in my opinion it enforces the driver to be better at judging and making the move. \n\nMax nearly always makes that same pass within the rules and whether you like it or not, it’s the rule. But when Piastri does it, causes a crash, and by the guidelines doesn’t meet the criteria for a safe pass everyone wants to blame the driver that closed the door. \n\nI guess my point is, the current rules are strong enough to make the drivers have to be certain on their judgement and not just wing it. While the alternative is far more risk for both drivers and allows more subjective judging to determine if it’s just “racing” or a penalty\n\nEdit: why downvote when I literally ask you to explain why the way you think differently would work better. Why do people just want to base rules off vibes?', ""The only problem with this is ... when a decision is controversial (and there's bound to be some) then there's nothing to fall back on.\xa0"", '\\>There have been periods in F1 where the stewards were able to quickly come to the correct decision without any problem.\n\n\\>Something myself and I\'m sure others have been saying for several years now.\n\nI don\'t want to sound harsh, but i\'ve read this take on litterally every sport i\'ve been a fan of.  This is always a mix of survivorship bias and a lack of understanding in how ""rules judging"" works.', '>Charles also says that they need to introduce more common sense\n\nThe problem with common sense is that it leads to inconsistency (which is also a major complaint). What\'s common sense to one steward, isn\'t to another.\n\nIf they\'re gonna rely more on steward ""gut feeling"" rather than guidelines, then the first step is a paid stewards team, so we can (mostly) have the same stewards at every race.\n\nAnything beyond that will just swing the pendulum too far in the other direction.', ""To be fair the stewards don't really have big time constraints either.\n\nIt's not like in rugby where you have to make a decision on foul play within a minute or so. In F1 you can take up to 10minutes or so and they often do. That's plenty of time to make the right call.\n\nAbsolutely agree that fewer guidelines and trusting the experts to make the right call is the way to go.\n\nOr alternatively just actually follow the guidelines instead of ignoring 3/4s of them half the time."", 'I agree, some people don’t realize that sometimes it will make sense to ignore a rule', '>I’d rather see no rules and let the drivers self-enforce like nascar does than have what we have now.\n\nThen you should go watch NASCAR in my opinion.\n\nThis does NOT work for Open-Wheel racing. The cars are too fragile, and pretty much break apart if you so much as sneeze into their exhaust port.']",41,29,0.9,41,159,159,-1,0,0.0,-1

1. Lando Norris 390
2. Oscar Piastri 366
3. Max Verstappen 366

Breakdown: 

Lando needs to piece together 35 points out of a possible 58 available. Why? Because if Max or Oscar takes all 58 that would give them both a possible 424 total points. By taking all 58 I mean they win the Sprint of Qatar, the Grand Prix and then Abu Dhabi. So if you’re rooting for Lando he just needs 35 points which would give him 425. If you want Oscar or Max to win you hope Lando can’t scrounge out 35 points and scoop as many points as you can. ","['Thanks!
