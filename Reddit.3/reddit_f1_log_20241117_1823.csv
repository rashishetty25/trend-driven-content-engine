1gt403f,Was Schumacher Really Pushed Out At Ferrari?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gt403f/was_schumacher_really_pushed_out_at_ferrari/,2024-11-17, Discussion,"Alright. I'm sure the vast amount of readers here knows the story. As reported by a BusinessF1 article, that [Schumacher was prematurely pushed out at Ferrari](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/51sn70/interesting_read_on_how_schumis_first_retirement/?rdt=33460) because good ol' Montezemolo got power hungry.

There appears to be but one problem. BusinessF1 is the one and only (AFAIK) source of the story, and we know that rag is as good as [diarrhea soaked toilet paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/18cxbwy/i_think_we_should_all_be_aware_that_buisnessf1/). 

To my knowledge, this story has **never** been corroborated by *any* reputable media outlets, nor have there been any actual insider statements. 

This is not one of those paddock open secrets where there has been enough confirmation with sources that a reputable outlet like the BBC would report on it with qualifying statements such as ""...understands that..."", ""...reportedly..."" ala Alonso's 2009 Ferrari move.

On the contrary, [Ross Brawn himself states that Michael didn't have it in him at the end of 2006 for the commitment required to gun for another WDC](https://youtu.be/t15tKnsUJrk?t=2335), and additionally Todt said had the rest of the dream team stayed on, [Todt would have quit himself](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/todt-reveals-he-planned-to-quit-ferrari-4406126/4406126/).

So, in the interest of getting to the bottom of this as a lifelong Schumacher fan, I was wondering if anyone has ever managed to track down a reputable source/report that was remotely contemporaneous to the events? Or is this story complete bullshit as is typical from BusinessF1?

Key takeaways found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gt403f/was_schumacher_really_pushed_out_at_ferrari/lxkkshm/).

It‚Äôs why Rossi wasn‚Äôt able to get his shot and how Kimi got the gig. \nThe power struggle stories abounded and seem to make sense as well. MS was collateral damage.', 'In ‚ÄúMichael Schumacher: The Edge of Greatness‚Äù, James Allen very much describes the power struggle within Ferrari and that Schumacher‚Äôs retirement announcement was practically forced by Ferrari. \n\nIt‚Äôs always hard to say if that was true or not, a lot of stuff happens behind the scenes of F1 that we‚Äôre not privy to, but James Allen makes a pretty convincing case for it in his book.  Assuming he has much better direct sources than I have, I have no reason to doubt that what he wrote is true.', 'Mercedes is doing what Ferrari did back then', 'The number one thing that throws cold water over the ""he was pushed out"" was he stayed in the Ferrari universe years after the fact despite being able to sign for other teams if he wanted to. The reason he left was that he got bit by the racing bug again after prepping to be a potential replacement for Massa in 2009 (while Massa was in a coma from being hit by debris), but given that Ferrari already had 3 drivers contracted for 2010, there was simply no room for a return. \n\nAlso its an open secret that he lobbied for Ferrari to sign Kimi. Not the kind of thing you do if you were expecting to keep driving.', ""I remember that kind of being the thinking at the time. They had just signed the highest-rated young talent (Raikkonen) and already had their young star that they'd developed in-house (Massa). Something had to give.\n\nThere's two lines of thinking around the whole thing:\n\nThe first is that Ferrari planned to have Schumacher team up with Raikkonen, with a view to the future and Raikkonen eventually replacing Schumacher as 'the man' at Ferrari. But Schumacher chose to back away, seemingly not wanting to race alongside an equal. Thus Massa ‚Äì who was probably going to be the reserve in 2007 ‚Äì got a reprieve.\n\nThe second is that Ferrari signed Raikkonen as a direct replacement for Schumacher, with Schumacher ageing and out of contract at the end of 2006.\n\nBoth theories are credible, and there was plenty of material around both ideas at the time (and since), but we'll never know the exact truth.\n\nPersonally I don't think he was explicitly forced out, but I do believe he jumped before Ferrari had a chance to sort of push him."", 'Wasn‚Äôt BusinessF1 the ‚Äújournalist‚Äù that said Suzie Wolff was feeding info to Toto?

Raikkonen remains the last champion for the Scuderia.\n\nI believe that Michael didn't really want to retire, but he had a great relationship with Felipe, so he decided to leave so as not to leave his friend without a seat for 2007. And of course, if Schumacher had stayed until the end of 2009, he would have had the potential to fight for title in 2007 and 2008.""]",519,159,0.9,519,1629,1629,19,6,0.010000000000000009,19

I feel like the penalty in terms of a fine is way too light for this","['It really feels like the FIA uses the NHL‚Äôs ‚Äúspin a wheel to determine punishment‚Äù method whenever there is an infraction lol and the last couple of months have really highlighted their lack of consistency', ""Clearly, there are two schools of thought.\n\nThe first, which many of the comments here are in, believe that it's a significant safety breach and therefore should be penalised harshly. To this school, there could have been a major incident on track that the drivers were driving into, and therefore a harsh punishment is necessary to deter this at all costs.\n\nThe second, which the FIA and some others fall into, is that it's a procedural breach in a rarely used section of the regulations. It's not ideal, but the procedural similarities between the Aborted Start and Extra Formation Lap procedure are fairly needlesley similar, and it's not the first time we've seen a mistake like that. In this school, the drivers and teams should know better, but they're not in racing conditions and they're driving knowing that there could be danger on track, so there was no really no reason to enforce a harsh sporting penalty.\n\nThere are clearly some very strong opinions each way, all depending on your view of how unsafe it was."", ""I have no idea why it wasn't heavily penalized, driving onto a track that was essentially closed, driving onto a track that has marshals working on it recovering a vehicle that are under the assumption the track is closed and are not expecting F1 cars to come past, driving onto a track in wet conditions, driving onto a track with heavy vehicles/cranes probably on there.\n\nDirectly going against race director instructions, running a red light, all of which due to just stupidity and not understanding the rules.\n\nIt seems like a massive safety violation and safety hazard, but they're more concerned about someone saying a naughty word or touching a rear wing than they are about actual safety.\n\nI guess it's been too long since something really bad happened so we're back to being passive and not pro-active as we wait for something really bad to happen after which they will pretend for a little while to take safety seriously again."", 'Big difference is that all the other cases you named are infringements of technical violations. Those are sanctioned brutally to deter cheating.\n\nThe start procedure is no part of the technical regulation.\nWas the penalty light? Yeah probably. But the case hardly ever happens so it was forgivable. He didn‚Äôt gain any advantage from it nor were the procedures compromised.\nI think it‚Äôs fine to penalise it lightly. Would others have gotten a harsher penalty? Possibly but we can‚Äôt say for sure.', 'It is a procedural breach of the sporting regulations. There is no set penalty for this and only a single precedent which was NFA. The penalty could have been higher but there is no real reason to say it should have been higher or lower. The entire procedure was used exactly two times, there was an infringement both times and one time it was nothing, the other time it was a fine. So in that sense it wasnt lower than usual.\n\nIn general, correlating the severity of the penalty to the severity of the infringement doesnt work, in particular across different types of infringements or even across different rulebooks. The rules dont work like that.\n\nIn terms of fuel, everyone was instructed to do the extra lap. If anything, doing an extra lap not accounted for in the race distance is a disadvantage because teams fuel the cars for the exact distance.', 'My big issue with it was reading the doc, they explained why it was on the driver and the team, and Lando and George didn‚Äôt have an excuse and it caused a safety issue and then let them off with a fine.\n\nLooking at Lando:\n\n1. He broke the clearly set out rules, going when the light was not green.\n\n‚ÄòAlthough the signal was appropriately given the light panel illuminated as prescribed, and the teams notified by the messaging system, the driver left the grid and proceeded on a lap that he assumed to be an extra formation lap.‚Äô\n\n2. Doing this was a safety issue, which are usually harshly penalized\n\n3. Lando was starting on pole, his championship rival was starting at the back of the grid. By doing what he did the race was shortened by a lap which directly benefits Lando.\n\nPeople say ‚ÄòLando finished p6 the one lap  less didn‚Äôt give him an advantage.‚Äô Well there‚Äôs a difference between it not giving him an advantage and him failing to use the advantage. He had no idea that the race was going to go terribly.\n\nI don‚Äôt think Lando was a crazy mastermind who purposely went to make the race one lap shorter in order to give him an advantage over Max. But you can‚Äôt give out penalties based on ‚Äòwell i don‚Äôt think he meant to do it‚Äô. However unlikely it is, Lando could‚Äôve don‚Äôt it to give himself an advantage. And didn‚Äôt get penalized.\n\nSomeone could do it again, and then go well in the document for an aborted start in Brazil, you set the precedent that doing this results in a driver fine, not a racing penalty. \n\nThere was no part of the document that said they‚Äôre not giving a harsher penalty because of extenuating circumstances. \n\nThere was no part of the document that said the situation was confusing and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre giving this specific penalty.', 'My belief is they did it to keep the championship ‚Äòfight‚Äô alive for Vegas, like all the marketing material for will Max win the championship here!?', ""Amusingly I don't think they could give a sporting penalty under Article 46 - Delayed Start  and Article 47 - Aborted Start: I don't think the rulemarkers even imagined a situation where this is misinterpreted.  \n\nThat being said, in the end it seems like everyone did the second formation lap, so I am not sure there would've been a fuel advantage."", 'I agree the penalty was too light, for as far as I know there were still marshalls and equipment on or near the track, but except for Sainz, everybody made an extra formationlap.']",0,88,0.45,0,83,83,0,17,0.07,0
