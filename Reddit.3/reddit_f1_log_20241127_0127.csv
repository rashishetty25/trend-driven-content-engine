Instead, Michael Andretti is out, Mario Andretti is relegated to a non-executive board position, and GM have agreed to pay more than double the original anti-dilution feed. Formula 1 got practically everything they wanted, which doesn't make much sense if they were running scared from the Department of Justice.\n\n*Autosport* have put forward [this piece](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/why-general-motors-has-got-the-green-light-that-andretti-did-not/10676534/) explaining why the team got in, and this part stood out to me:\n\n>Autosport understands that key to getting F1 interested was in Towriss working with General Motors to change the nature of the deal.

It sounds like Andretti wanted to enter his team and GM had the option of developing an engine to supply them with from 2028, but they weren't obligated to provide it. So if the Andretti team wasn't doing as well as expected or if they could get a better deal from an existing supplier, then GM would be able to write off or repurpose whatever engine development they had done. If I'm being charitable, then I have to say that that feels a bit misleading because Andretti's complaint was that they were being frozen out, but giving GM the option of engaging means that they weren't being completely honest. At worst, it sounds like a bit of a Trojan horse where Andretti uses the promise of an GM engine to enter the sport in 2028, but they never have the intention of using a GM engine -- and they get to keep their entry even when the GM engine never materialises.\n\nThat might sound like splitting hairs, but it would go a long way towards explaining why Formula 1 never really responded to the investigation and how they were able to broker a new deal with GM directly instead of capitulating and letting Andretti in on his terms.""]",29,67,0.73,29,222,222,2,1,0.010000000000000009,2

1h0kk2y,Simple analysis - How much does Max owe 2024 WDC to RBR Dominant Start?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0kk2y/simple_analysis_how_much_does_max_owe_2024_wdc_to/,2024-11-26, Statistics,"There's been lots of statements flying around such as ""Max won WDC24 without the fastest car"".

With recency bias it feels that way, however its eye opening to look back at the beginning of the season and how dominant the RedBull was (first 7 races). So much so that we had Perez finishing 2nd / Podium. This level of dominance had no close challengers over this period. Effectively free points for RedBull + Max.

With this in mind I wondered what the championship table would look like based on two different scenarios:

1. If Mercedes were the ones to have a 7-race dominant car at the beginning of the season - For this I swapped the RedBull drivers finishing positions with the RedBull drivers for the first 7 races as follows; where Lewis finished ahead of George I would put him as the first Redbull and George as the second RedBull, and vice versa. However when populating the Mercedes cars I always put Max as the higher finisher.
2. Same as point 1 but for Ferrari.

The output:

**Scenario 1**

||
||
|Lando Norris|340|
|Charles Leclerc|319|
|Lewis Hamilton|304|
|Max Verstappen|302|
|George Russell|280|
|Oscar Piastri|268|
|Carlos Sainz|259|

**Scenario 2**

||
||
|Charles Leclerc|365|
|Max Verstappen|359|
|Lando Norris|340|
|Oscar Piastri|268|
|Carlos Sainz|267|
|George Russell|217|
|Lewis Hamilton|208|

There's no point in doing a McLaren swap for the first 7 races because this would clearly just result in a Lando P1 by a decent stretch.

So all scenarios point to the fact that - while Max didn't have the fastest car **all** season - He ultimately does owe his WDC24 to having a vastly dominant car earlier in the season.

Put another way, Max essentially had a 50pt (to Charles) and 60pt (to Norris) starting advantage heading into a 17 race season. You take that away and give the corresponding advantage to each of those drivers and they both take the WDC win.","['All these speculations are silly.

1gzzqjv,F1 should push the current regulations a year longer ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzzqjv/f1_should_push_the_current_regulations_a_year/,2024-11-26, Discussion,"I don't know if this is a popular opinion or whatever but with the likes of Ferrari and McLaren finally getting some pace while Red Bull seems to be dropping off and Mercedes recently finding some really good pace I think they should push the new regs until 2027 and let this play out some more 

Now I know full well that development has already started on the new cars so this is probably just a pipe dream but good God would I kill to see what teams could come to winning ways with an extra year of these regulations 

And obviously with the recent announcement of GM joining this is guaranteed not going to happen (not that the odds were high to begin lol)


Would love you to hear everyone else's opinion on this

EDIT: id like to start by saying some of you on here need to settle down and read the post first 

I state VERY CLEARLY I know full well this won't happen as teams are already geared up for 2026 and I am excited to see the new regs and Audi and GM's progress during the next few seasons of this sport 

I was simply saying with teams catching up it's a shame we are just going to get one season of multiple teams being competitive 

Now of course I know that teams like McLaren and Ferrari may be able to rival red bull ( if they are still dominating by then) in 2026 with the new regs and I am excited to see what Aston Martin can cook up with the genius mind of Adrian newey and that brand new wind tunnel and factory 

Thanks for hearing me out ","['Mercedes had pace cause it was cold dude', ""Yes, let's tell Audi that the car they are preparing for 2026 will have to wait a year. They also have to compete in 2026 nonetheless because contract stuff. Also all the other teams have to completely change their development plans for next 3 years..\n\nYou do realize that it's a huge business right? You can't change something that has been planned for so long because of the uncountable consequences"", 'Everyone is already geared up for 2026. Too late for this.
