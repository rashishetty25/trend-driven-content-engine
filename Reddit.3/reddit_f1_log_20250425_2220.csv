There is no softening of the energy split. However, a back door for changes remains open.**\n\n> It was the defining Formula 1 topic in recent weeks. Several manufacturers wanted to overturn the new engine regulations for 2026. After F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali himself took up the V10 engine with synthetic fuel as an alternative for the future and FIA President Mohammed bin Sulayem jumped on the bandwagon, Red Bull and Ferrari wanted to grab the opportunity.\n\n> The two heavyweights of the premier class fought against the new Power Unit, which will come to Formula 1 in 2026. The electrical component is increasing sharply: almost half of the power is supposed to be delivered by the battery, the rest comes from the V6 turbo. Officially, the teams expressed safety concerns at the FIA. The longer recuperation phases could lead to large speed differences and create dangerous situations.\n\n> Other voices from the paddock, however, saw a different motivation for the advances. Ferrari and Red Bull are in arrears with the development of the new drive for 2026. It is rumored that Mercedes is on track to deliver the best power unit. Similar to 2014. At that time, the engine forge in Brixworth had best designed the change to the complicated drives of the current generation and the Formula 1 under several years in the choke.\n\n> **No energy split changes planned.**\nThe first damper was given to the opponents of the new regulations at the Bahrain Grand Prix. At a meeting of all engine manufacturers, Ferrari and Red Bull refused to reinstall the desired V10 naturally aspirated engine in the cars as soon as possible. Newcomers Audi, returnees Honda and also Mercedes would not have been able to develop a different drive at such short notice.\n\n> But the competition did not give up. They wanted to relax the energy split management. On Thursday (24.4.), however, Ferrari and Red Bull, which will develop their own combustion engine for the next season and are supported by Ford on the electric side, suffered the next defeat. The Formula 1 Commission rejected the proposal to change the distribution between the combustion engine and the battery. The plan was to reduce the 350 kW on the electric side to 200 kW in the race. The rest of the power should have been provided by the 1.6-liter V6 turbo engine.\n\n> Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was enraged by the advances of his opponents in the run-up to the meeting. ""I actually wanted to protect ourselves and not comment on it at all. But that\'s really a joke. Just a week ago we had a meeting about the engines. And now these things are back on the agenda.‚Äù Now the Austrian can take a deep breath. The new regulations are given a chance for the time being.\n\n> **Back door remains open.**\nThe F1 Commission discussed fundamental improvements to the energy management strategy for 2026, as well as measures to address financial problems that drive-prower manufacturers may face if either performance losses or significant reliability problems occur in 2026. All these topics will be discussed in more detail by the specialists in the relevant advisory committees.""\n\n> With this decision, the premier class has taken precautions. If there are large differences in performance on the racetrack next year, there would be opportunities to make adjustments in the sense of the sport. If manufacturers are significantly behind, they are likely to exceed the budget cap for the engines and receive more test bench hours.', ""If the changes are purely to the distribution of the electric system, it could just be that Ferrari believes their ICE is very strong and wants that to be more responsible for power.\n\nUltimately, I wouldn't be shocked if Merc had by far the best engine, but Ferrari have made good engines in general lately.

But this is always how Lewis has been, really feeling the emotions, positive or negative post race.\n\nUltimately Lewis is 40, he's not at his 2018/2019 peak anymore, but he also isn't washed.

When tyres changed from bridgestone to high deg pirelli, everyone said Lewis was fucked because it wouldn't work with his aggressiveness yet he adapted and still performed at the top, becoming a tyre whisperer even. Even when he started as a rookie, people were reporting that he could easily handle cars that were so unpredictable and unstable even world champions like raikkonen or hakkinen would have complained ferociously about it.\n\nHamilton achieve what he achieved in great part because like so many greats before him, like alonso, like schumi, he could adapt to any changes thrown his way across the years.\n\nSo it's so weird to me how quick everyone is to believe that his struggles are explained simply because he can't adapt to the ferrari or even the ground effect cars. I can understand Hamilton saying it because f1 drivers clearly aren't wired to accept they could ever hit their limits and are always quick to find excuse to keep their confidence intact. \n\nBut from my pov, it feels instead like Hamilton, finally, finally declined.""]",0,208,0.45,0,726,726,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
