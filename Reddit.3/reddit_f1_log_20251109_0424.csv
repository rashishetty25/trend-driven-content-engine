But since then it's become just as worse as by 2021 and imo this year has been worse. It's disappointing because they made so much of making sure any car updates had to keep 'to the spirit of the regulations' but that just seemed to be left behind.\n\nI haven't read much about the aero side of next year but I hope they think about where it went wrong in this generation and try to fix it."", 'To be fair, this current whole reg cycle has been a trap for Mercedes. Unpredictable form, hard to find competitive cars consistently (22-23), weird drop offs sometimes mid season onwards (2024), etc.\xa0', ""How does he know for sure? Porpoising only shows up on track. Unless the suspension rules are going back to the previous regulations, different floor geometry won't matter so much. The cars can still disturb the under body airflow and disrupt the downforce."", 'Thank god we’re getting rid of ground effect. Absolutely ruined racing in the corners.', ""I think what pains me immensely inside is how much it has affected the quality of racing. This season has reflected sorely on how bad it has gotten as the seasons come by. Cars running so close to the ground might be limited, given what we are going to see with the new regs next year.\n\nShovlin is right that it shouldn't be bad, provided that little drastic implementations that actively encourage those things will come up, but I do want to see how much it will impact the production of racing and overtaking opportunities"", 'I wouldnt say its as bad or worse than 2021. That ruleset was on a really bad level. Sure, 2025 cars do notably worse than 2022 cars, but i would say they quite reach that level.\n\nAs for next year, improved wake performance and improving the current shortcommings in that area is the primary target for the aero regulations, next to the drag reduction for the PU. We will see how sucessfull they will be with that.', ""I've watched some deep dives on the new aero regulations by aero engineers.\n\nHonestly, looks promising regarding managing dirty air.\n\nDirty Wake should be much narrower due to the barge boards working to pull it under the car rather than wash it out to the side, as they do currently. \n\nSmaller wings, particularly the front wing will also reduce how much dirty air is generated and how much the following car is affected by it.\n\nIt remains to be seen how easy overtakes will be given the following car no longer gets drs advantage (all cars get drs next year)"", 'Such a shame really. 2022 was the best year of these ending regulations, everything else was very poor in regards to what these rules were meant to accomplish.', 'The FIA needs to be proactive in minimizing dirty air by changing the regulations as teams discover tricks. Something that makes the car faster and makes it harder for the following car to overtake is a massive bonus for the teams and something they will want to pursue.', 'One thing that most people forgot was the Spa TD in 2022 and the massive height increase for the floor in 2023. These made floors less effective and as such made running in dirty air much worse. Which is why teams had to focus on normal aero surfaces for downforce as well as sealing the floor']",84,31,0.96,84,211,211,-3,2,-0.020000000000000018,-3

so I buy both apple TV and F1TV app $29.99 per year subscription, try watch in apple TV nothing there it seems till 2026

open F1 TV app, says I need a “pro” subscription (after paying $30) and it seems I need to go to the site to get that

then I go to F1 site, click watch sprint there, and then it says upgrade sub, click that, when I get to the next page it just says manage subscription on Apple F1 app and there is nothing to upgrade here

Every race is just terribly executed. Im watching the 8 hours of bahrain as we speak. and its so refreshing to see a motorsport BE a motorsport. we dont have that in F1 anymore. It likes to brand itself as the pinnacle. But its not, it really isnt.

  
The broadcasting is just bad. Theyre trying everything to miss as much as possible. As someone who likes to simrace, im racing in a gt3 league currently. where there is better broadcasting to be found. by 2 dudes and 5 viewers. Im not even kidding. almost constant picture in picture. to constantly switching at the right times. Its much better than f1 and i stand by it. they should be ashamed, that 2 amateurs can broadcast a 40 person race and miss less than probably a dozen professionals with half the cars. 



The calls they make are just beyond ridiculous. i get it, sometimes you cant always get it right. but with the VSC last race and the call here to do a rolling start. its so obvious you dont do any of those things. it kills the action and its not even for safety because there is no risk to be had. Its an entertainment industry and they cant figure out how to get more people hooked. 

Maybe not killing the action as it happens help boosts the number. 

  
i am writing this out of frustration and im sure theres much more instances to name. but my brain is just cluttered because im honestly baffled by how bad f1 is compared to other series. 



All that oil money. and still no good racing...
