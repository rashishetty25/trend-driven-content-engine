This rule, which was in place for most of F1's history (1950-1991), means that to count points towards the World Championship, you only count points from your 11 best results, leaving the rest as 0s on your tally. This created interesting scenarios where a driver might be driving 4th, but because all his best results were podiums, he would not gain any points and he was incentivized to go risk it for 3rd place.

  
The most famous case of this rule was probably 1988, Senna's first WDC, where Prost outscored the Brazilian handsomely (105 vs 94) but lost the championship (87 vs 90) when applying the 'best of 11 rule'.

  
I was curious to see how this rule would have impacted the 2000s championships, so I went ahead and calculated the points tally with this new system. Here are the most interesting outcomes.

  
NOTE: ""Best of 11"" was adjusted from time to time in F1 and it was based, naturally, on the number of total races. For example, in the 60, 70s they used 'best of 8' and 'best of 9'. The number of races has increased exponentially since then, especially in the 2010s, but for simplicity's and entertainment's sake, we will maintain the 11 threshold.

# 2008: Massa's lawsuit works out

Felipe's lawyers need to find out who was responsible for dropping the 'best of 11' rule.

1hagpm8,Duration of pit stops - Abu Dhabi,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hagpm8/duration_of_pit_stops_abu_dhabi/,2024-12-09, Technical,"Hi there. While watching this past race in Abu Dhabi, I noticed during both Verstappen's and Piastri's 10-second penalty, the overall time for the ""stopped"" time in the pit stop showed 13.4 and I think 13.5.  But there is no way they actually took 3+ seconds to do the actual 'stopped' work of swapping the tires.  If anything, the stopped work seemed as fast, if not faster than, a typical pit stop, so I was expecting to see 12.something on their overall stopped times.  Does anyone have any idea what is going on here? ","['Teams usually go slightly over the penalty time without touching the car, for safety.\n\nIf they fail to serve the penalty correctly that‚Äôs another time penalty on top. Sacrificing an extra half a second to ensure you don‚Äôt get another 10 second penalty is just good sense.', 'Two reasons:\n\nThe first is that there is no FIA-representative telling them when they can start working on the car, but it is judged afterward if they waited long enough. The teams have to monitor the time-penalty themselves. Is they go really tight on the 10 seconds, they run the risk of the FIA finding that they are too short, because maybe the guy who is timing started his stopwatch 0.2 or 0.3 seconds too early. In that case, they will get another penalty, so they take a little bit more to be safe.\n\nThe second is that while the work may seem very fast, it will always be slightly slower than with a normal pitstop. These guys work mostly on muscle-memory. They start when the car pulls in. But now they have to wait, and it kind of messes up their rhythm. In an ideal pitstop, the wheelguns are on just before the car fully stops.', 'I think just cause the car is worked on before it\'s ""still"".\n\n\nThe car drives in and even before being perfectly still the wheels are being undone and the mechanics getting hand on it.\n\n\nSo the 2.3 second time is not the total time someone was touching it. It\'s the total time the car was stopped.\xa0\n\n\nWhen you\'re doing a penalty you can\'t touch it when it\'s moving so naturally might be quicker in terms of touching but longer in terms of still', ""I was having a hard time understanding how/why the team would be inaccurately keeping track of the 10-second penalty, but I hadn't considered a 'safety' factor they may add in, so thanks for that.  \n\nThey must be adding more than a half second though I guess (?) (which seems like a lot?), because honestly the work was lighting fast once they finally did start.  Can't imagine it was still a 2.5+ second duration of time spent working. ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nSeems like a pretty large safety factor for a sport with such tight/accurate/important margins."", 'Yep, plus if you have to wait there will be slightly different reaction times with each member of the pit crew instead of working on the car coming into the pits.', 'Thanks for the input!', ""Hadn't considered this either.  Thanks!"", 'It‚Äôs because of how detrimental fucking it up is. A penalty can be recovered from, it‚Äôs highly unlikely you can recover from two though.\n\nThere‚Äôll also be additional human factors involved as well. The pitcrew are used to one input for beginning their process - ie. car stopping. They‚Äôre going against this, having to watch another input (lollipop man oking them to start) and then starting the process, which is going to cause delays of split seconds on each of them.', 'One individual is responsible for doing the timing, you don\'t want individual crew mates doing their own internal timing. In the past you\'ve seen individuals reach for the tire before the the time keeper gives the signal, which creates a new penalty if they\'re judged to have touched the car before the elapsed time has gone by.\n\nMuch easier to simply have the time keeper run the lock \\~1/2 to 1 second longer and have a clean penalty free ""lower stress"" pit stop.']",0,15,0.41,0,133,133,0,0,0.03999999999999998,0

Mine

1. Verstappen- I think that's clearer after this season
2. Leclerc- Quick and has made gains in racecraft and consistency 
3. Hamilton- It is hard to rank Lewis. He lost to George in qualy but seemed faster in race trim.
4. Russell- Ran Lewis very close during their time as team mates. Has that dog in him that could win a WDC
5. Norris- Quick but lacks some intangibles at present
6. Sainz- Well rounded. I think he's in the same tier as some above but less potential
7. Alonso- At the backend of his career but still very good.
8. Piastri- It feels harsh but right now I think he's a tier below the top 6
9. Hulk- Would do a job in a top team. Good qualifier
10. Gasly- Impressive midfield driver, looked very good at the end of the season
11. Ocon- Not much to separate between him and Gasly
12. Bottas- I really don't know how good Bottas still is because his car was terrible 
13. Tsunoda- Has shown growth this season
14. Albon- Some stellar drives but Colapinto might have shown his true level?
15. K mag-
16. Perez- Terrible season. Not sure how washed he is though
17. Stroll- Shouldn‚Äôt be on the grid but he isn't a disaster. Capable of a good drive on occasion.
18. Zhou- Hard to rank given this  years car


Colapinto and Lawson have a small sample size to judge so I didn't include them. But I would rank then in and around 15th based on what we have seen.

Another level up this year. Seems to be able to manage tires better. Still a bit error prone but is ready to lead Mercedes\n5. Carlos. Tragedy he lost his place at a front runner. Nearly as fast as Charles and still one of the most cerebral drivers. Little less consistent but still very good. Red Bull will regret not signing him.\n6. Lewis. The pace has started to fall off and errors are more numerous but can still pull out the old GOAT occasionally.\n7. Oscar. Amazing progress in year 2 to solve his tire management issues. Quali h2h vs lando is misleading because the average gap between them was among the closest on the grid. Needs a bit more consistency and better overtaking skills to challenge Lando next year.\n8. Fernando. If he was in a top 4 car, he would have won races. Still one of the best but some signs of errors creeping in.\n9. Gasly. One of his best seasons ever. Hope it‚Äôs enough for tempt another shot at a winning team.\n10. Hulk. Amazing pace and consistency. Still got it.\n11. Yuki. Fast and consistent. Still some errors and hot flashes.

Very inconsistent but could have been his situation. Brazil suggests good upside next season.\n14. Liam. Consistent but lacks pace vs Yuki and overdrives the car. Could struggle at Red Bull.\n15. KMag. Flashes of pace but no consistency and some poor racecraft.\n16. Bottas. Was so far back the only benchmark was zhou who he was consistently faster than.\n17. Franco.

Leclerc - Improved massively in consistency and only fell off when the car fell. His only issues are strategic decisions and rain, where he's clearly a step below Verstapped. \n\n3. Norris - The speed is there but the consistency and mentality isn't quite yet. He's definitely capable of winning a WDC in the future and I dare say if the car performance was the same he'd win this year if he could do it again. \n\n4. Russell - He has all the qualities of a champion but races like Australia or some tyre degardation issues show why he isn't yet. Still WDC calibre.\n\n5. Sainz - He's brought the fight to Leclerc and was beaten. That's a fairly apt comparison so I'd say he's capable of performing well in a WDC fight but I wouldn't back him for a win. He just has these weekends where he's missing the edge or just crashes out unnecessarily.\n\n6. Alonso - His age is finally showing I'd say. There was a mid-season slump and sometimes he just randomly goes off the track and loses a couple of second. That said, his pace and racecraft are still incredible and he is undoubtedly limited by his machinery.\n\n7. Hamilton - Similar story to Alonso. The consistency doesn't seem to be there anymore. He can be the best driver on the grid by a good margin one race and then get eliminated in Q1 in the next one. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if he finds his footing again next year.\n\n8. Piastri - The biggest letdown of the season imo. He's clearly capable but Norris dominated him most weekends. The margins are smaller than they look in the H2H but there were way too many weekends where Piastri just wasn't there.\n\n9. Gasly - Best midfielder this year imo. Very few incidents and the moment the car became good, he capitalized.\n\n10. H√ºlkenberg - Has shown incredible qualifying pace but there were also some very clumsy incidents and races that make him less solid than Gasly imo. \n\n11. Ocon - Very hard to rank since the Alpines usually had different upgrade packages but I think he was a bit flattered by Gasly's bad luck early on. \n\n12. Tsunoda - I think there's a decent gap between 11 and 12 and now there a few very close ones again. There was some incredible driving from Yuki this year but there were also plenty of annonymous weekends.  \n\n13. Magnussen - He seemed very willing to play the team game and that reflected poorly on his points. There were some very weekends but at this point everyone has them.\n\n14. Albon - A bit of a disappointment to be honest. The car wasn't great but Colapinto was uncomfortably close to him and more importantly, he got into way too many accidents this season. Though, I do think Albon is fully capable of being the best driver in the midfield. Just not this year.\n\n15. Bottas - He's a great qualifier but the races this year have been rather terrible for him. Obviously the car was terrible but he's been close with Zhou in the races and I don't particularily rate him. I'd imagine he would still do a decent job in a better team though.\n\n16. Stroll - Stroll is overhated because he can be pretty good on his day. Still, he gets into these clumsy incidents that really do not do him a favour. \n\n17. Perez - Perez isn't a terrible driver. His midfield days are proof of that. The Red Bull is a difficult car to drive and Perez is apparently terrible at driving that particular car. \n\n18. Zhou - I don't think Zhou is bad. He's just a capable pair of hands that's not particularily fast. But in a grid this stacked being average results in being last.

1haslhw,Senna vs Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1haslhw/senna_vs_verstappen/,2024-12-10, Discussion,"I always wonder how legends would fare against the new blood and I‚Äôm curious if anyone here is old enough to have watched Senna throughout his Formula One career? How does Max compare to him from an overall standpoint (personality, interviews, driving style, aggressiveness, popularity etc). I never got to watch Senna but from all the docs, YouTube and shows I‚Äôve saw on him, Max seems to have a lot of similarities. 


For conversation‚Äôs sake, if they were both in their prime and racing in equal cars, who do you think would win? Do you think Max will have a similar legacy when he retires? ","['honestly this is impossible to compare. It\'s like saying ""if an apple and an orange were perfectly ripe at the same time and eaten by the same person, which one would taste better?"" and the answer to that would always be subject to the mouth in question.\n\ni don\'t think any current driver could truly be competitive in the f1 machinery of the 80\'s and early 90\'s, and vice versa. the cars are just worlds apart. further - i don\'t think that either driver would be at their best in a ""middleground"" car either.\n\nThat said - there was a race senna participated in where all drivers were in identical benzo 190e road cars - and senna destroyed everyone. I have a feeling that if you set up a similar scenario for Max, he would very much do the same.\n\nMax won\'t ever have the kind of legacy that senna does. The reason that senna has made such an impact (arguably larger than that of any other f1 driver) is because he died behind the wheel in his absolute prime. the question of ""how much *could* he have achieved"" will forever go unanswered. I don\'t believe this will be the case for max.', ""The answer is same as it always is for every sport; today's champion will beat every previous champion.\n\nThe minimum and maximum skill level increases as a sport ages. Current training and practice has all the knowledge of the sport from 30 years ago, plus 30 years of additional development."", 'Nobody knows the answers  of course.\n\nBut I think it‚Äôs fair to say that Max is an all time talent.  \n\nWhat I mean by that is he would be competitive in similar machinery with Hamilton, Schumacher, Senna etc.  assuming they raced together at the time.\n\nIt‚Äôs so hard to compare though because the machinery changes so much over time.', ""I disagree with people who say you can't compare because of different machinery. There is little evidence that different machinery changes the pecking order of F1 drivers in any way. Even within eras there have been massive regulation changes where the cream keeps rising to the top regardless. \nExamples:\n\n- F1 drivers had to adapt to downforce in the early 70s\n- the late 70s F1 drivers had to adapt to ground effect\n- the 80s F1 drivers had to adapt to turbo powered cars , and then NA cars again when turbos were banned \n- the 90s F1 drivers had to adapt to electronic aids, and then the banning of them, then new safety regulations, refuelling, a new rule stating that weight must include both driver and car (before it was just car)\n\nStill, the best drivers always remained the best drivers, and vice versa. That's because no matter the open wheeler, the same techniques to driving fast still apply, so I don't see why we can't compare across eras either. Besides, it's fun to.\n\nAnyway, I watched Senna's entire career. Verstappen would beat him in the same car. He's just a total machine, but it would definitely be close."", ""Senna is what got me into the sport as a kid. Schumi made it boring. Seb made it exciting again. Mercedes made it boring. Max made it fun, then boring.\n\nThis is just my opinion, but Max is the best driver of my lifetime. He's a robot in a car. Lewis would be second. Senna is still my favorite."", 'Probably Max. But I think the only thing that separates them are the newer training techniques that Max and other modern F1 drivers would be receiving. If you were to level that field and reduce the comparison to just pure racing instincts then I‚Äôd venture to say that Senna is ahead', 'These types of comparisons are impossible to make because they never had an overlap of teammates and the cars and regulations they raced in are far too different', 'The real answer is that would both crash into each other‚Ä¶ full speed‚Ä¶ zero fucks left to give. Both are too competitive to let the other win. They are both equally good and equally aggressive.

1ha8ben,It's past time to re-evaluate the narrative of the 2024 season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ha8ben/its_past_time_to_reevaluate_the_narrative_of_the/,2024-12-09, Discussion,"The prevailing narrative on social media this season has been ""McLaren are bottling the WDC/WCC"" or ""Lando is bottling the race/championship"" or - when they have won - ""McLaren should have won this earlier"".  Even now that they've completed their best season in literal decades with a championship win, the narrative still seems to be focused on the fact that McLaren are not perfect.  As if any team is.

It is my view that RBR has broadly escaped criticism on social media for their dramatic drop in form in 2024. with the exception of Checo Perez, who I think is often the scapegoat that takes all (or most) of the blame for the failings that belong to the team as a whole.

Both the WDC and the WCC were RBR's to lose this year.  The only team that *bottled* anything was RBR in falling so spectacularly hard after the season had started, especially after coming off of several years of complete dominance.  The WDC this year was won by Max Verstappen, but with one hand tied behind his back and an entire Formula One team strapped to his back as he pulled himself over the line by sheer force of will and unbelievable skill.

Maybe it's a reaction to British Media, which I'm largely unexposed to, but the narratives on social media to me seem completely out of touch with reality.

If you're wearing Papaya or ""Rosso Corsa"", you should have nothing but pride for how your season went - even if you have plenty of opportunities still to improve upon for next season.  But if you're with Red Bull (and your name isn't Verstappen), you need to be going into the off-season with some humility and some organizational soul-searching, because this was a bad, bad season for you and 2025 is fast approaching.","[""You have a team that has lost it's way in terms of car development with a car that is difficult to setup and drive (RBR).
