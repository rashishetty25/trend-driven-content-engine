Charles should have listened to those words of wisdom.', '(By Par Alexandre)\n\nScuderia Ferrari, struggling at the start of the season, suffered a particularly dramatic setback at the Chinese Grand Prix. After finishing in 5th place, Charles Leclerc was disqualified from the final standings due to a weight problem, a costly penalty for Ferrari in the championship race. But while the official reason was linked to a lack of weight under the regulation 800 kg, a new revelation from Fred Vasseur, Ferrari\'s main team, brings to light an additional and rather unusual cause for this disqualification.\n\nLeclerc had done everything right during the race, but once on the scales, Ferrari\'s SF-25 turned out to be slightly under the minimum required weight of 799.4 kg, after removing the two liters of fuel needed for post-race analysis. This missing kilo was enough to disqualify the Monegasque driver. At first glance, this might appear to be a purely mechanical infringement, but it seems there was more to it than that.\n\nRemember the exchange between Leclerc and his race engineer at the Australian Grand Prix? It should already have aroused suspicion: ""Is there a leakage? ... I have a full seat of water, like, full of water!"" What appeared to be an amusing exchange at the time of the race turned out to be the same reason why the single-seater lost weight at the Chinese Grand Prix. Indeed, according to Fred Vasseur, it wasn\'t just tire wear that contributed to the disqualification, but also the loss of a liter of water due to a failure in Charles Leclerc\'s drink supply.\n\n**In an interview with L\'√âquipe newspaper, Fred Vasseur revealed that the situation was far more complex than a simple question of worn tires: ""Charles Leclerc\'s downgrading on Sunday is similar to what happened to Russell last year in Belgium,"" he explained. ""The tires are only part of the explanation... We also lost a liter of water when Charles\' drink supply leaked. Downgrading for weight is always an addition of small factors.""**\n\nFerrari being the limit of all parameters at the Chinese Grand Prix, it was this missing liter of water that played a key role in Leclerc\'s disqualification. A cause which might seem anecdotal, but which, combined with tire wear, cost Ferrari dearly. Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur adds: ""The aim of the game in F1 is to get to the limit of all parameters, everywhere. To get to the last gram of weight, to get to the last tenth of a millimetre of skid, to get to the last millimetre of aileron deformation"". Let\'s hope that this water leak will be definitively repaired for the Japanese Grand Prix.', 'TL;DR: Must be the water.', 'Gotta say, lads\n\nI called it: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/r2hB5SK7Ha', 'Must be the water.', ""Leclerc really is Raikkonen's successor.

1jl753z,[AMuS] Mercedes solves Antonelli puzzle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jl753z/amus_mercedes_solves_antonelli_puzzle/,2025-03-27, News,,"[""Driver of the day voters somehow collectively spotted Kimi taking damage I guess \n\nStill the oddest DotD winner I've ever seen"", 'Translation:\n\n> The fact that Andrea Kimi Antonelli was voted Driver of the Race by the fans in Shanghai ultimately came as a bit of a surprise to the driver himself. In terms of pure numbers, the 18-year-old hadn\'t really delivered a particularly outstanding performance. The Italian started in eighth place, and he crossed the finish line in eighth place as well. He was 53.7 seconds behind winner Piastri and 42.6 seconds behind George Russell in the sister car.\n\n> The disqualification of the two Ferraris subsequently pushed the youngster up to sixth place. After the race, the youngster revealed that he had sustained damage to the underbody somewhere, which was affecting his pace. Given this, the Silver Arrows driver\'s performance naturally had to be reassessed. The only question that remained was how and where the underbody was damaged.\n\n> After a detailed analysis of the TV images and an examination of the car, chief engineer Andrew Shovlin provided the solution a few days late: ""Leclerc had hit Lewis\'s right rear wheel. The end plate of his front wing broke off. Kimi saw this, but unfortunately he couldn\'t avoid it because other cars were next to him. He drove over the debris, which flew under the car and damaged the deflectors at the entrance to the underbody.""\n\n> Damage costs two to three tenths.\nThis sensitive area of \u200b\u200bthe car has a significant impact on aerodynamics and, consequently, performance. However, the loss of downforce was difficult to quantify, Shovlin regrets: ""It definitely cost a lot of performance. It would be easier to calculate how much it affected the lap time if we had already completed a few laps. But here it happened on the very first lap, so we can only estimate it. Based on the aerodynamic data, we estimate that the loss of downforce cost two to three tenths per lap.""\n\n> Another problem was that the damage affected only one side of the car. The loss of downforce was particularly noticeable on the rear axle. ""Kimi quickly got on the radio and complained that he had no grip at the rear. As a result, the tires started to slide, they overheated, and lost grip. He struggled with this problem for most of the race. During the pit stop, we were only able to alleviate it slightly with the front wing,"" said Shovlin.\n\n> There\'s more to come from Kimi. \nIn the end, the driver had to somehow deal with it himself: ""When you have that kind of damage to your car, it can result in inconsistent handling. Depending on the corner or wind direction, it\'s sometimes better or worse. The balance shifts in different directions. He really did a good job there. But of course, it was a bit frustrating when you saw his strong pace at the beginning of the weekend. He was battling with the two Ferraris and with Max.""\n\n> Overall, Shovlin gives his young prot√©g√© a glowing review for his start with the factory team: ""He\'s a brilliant fit for our team. It was quite difficult to succeed a driver as successful as Lewis. Everyone here in the team enjoys working with Kimi. And he\'s just having fun. Melbourne was particularly difficult with the rain in the first race. But he adapted well. I think there\'s a lot more to come from Kimi.""', 'So glad to let him play with puzzles.

In my opinion, he was out of the VCARB seat next season and most probably out of F1. If he performs well he may get a chance to remain in RBR next year. If he goes down the path many previous teammates of Max have gone and struggles with the car, nobody will put the blame on him for underperforming. It is by now a well known factor that this car is difficult to drive and unless RBR fixes it, only Max can get it to somehow work (still a bad car, but Max has proven that he can extract more).A couple of decent results will only give him a chance to be a candidate for a seat in other teams (assuming there is something available). The blame of this whole swap fiasco lays solely on the shoulders of RBR‚Äôs management for their inexplicable decisions and their design team for failing to produce a car (that Max,Checo and most recently Liam have said for, at least, since last season) is (mildly phrased) not good.', 'Hey folks, question about driver numbers:\nIf Max were to lose the championship this year, but it happens before the last race, does he have to return to his original number for any remaining races in this season? \nE.g. let‚Äôs say Lando bags it in the second to last race. Does Max have to race with 33 for Abu Dhabi, since he‚Äôs not the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù champion at that point, or does he keep the 1 since it‚Äôs for the previous year and then it officially becomes Lando‚Äôs when he receives the trophy at the gala? \nJust a random thought I had. Here‚Äôs hoping as a Max fan it won‚Äôt become relevant ü§ûüèª:)', 'Has it been established that Verstappen likes excessively ""pointy"" cars? (Going off Albon\'s ""maximum sensitivity"" comment and Horner\'s quote below.) I\'m wondering if Verstappen would push for this behaviour from any team\'s car, and thus would render the 2nd car practically undriveable for any other driver, sacrificing a WCC for the WDC. If you were a team principal is that a risk you would take? Or am I reading too much into Red Bull\'s issues? \n\n> ""If I think back to the beginning of \'22, we had quite a stable car but with quite a bit of understeer, which obviously Max hates. We had an upgrade in Spain where we put a lot more front into the car and Max made a big step forward. Checo [Perez] sort of nose-dived from that point.""', 'According to Japanese media, Franz Tost advocated for Yuki to be promoted last year.', 'If graphene, CNTs, aerogel, and other advanced ‚Äúsupermaterials‚Äù were available, what could they mean for F1?\n\nWhat kind of technologies could we expect?', 'What if Hamilton never left Mercedes?\n\nI have spent hours trying to figure out all the permutations. When I was bored over the winter I made myself a little project calculating all the Quali times and reliability and starts from every race.\nIt‚Äôs a lot more complicated but the chmapioms were\xa0\n\n2014 - Hulkenburg (Merc)\xa0 Beats Rosberg by one point after going into double points finale 49 behind.\xa0\n\n2015 - Rosberg (Merc)\xa0 Is actually given a really close run by Ferrari‚Äôs drivers Alonso and Vettel but has strong end of the season to win.\xa0\n\n2016 - Rosberg (Merc)\xa0 Unlike 2015 this one is far less exciting than real life season. Rosberg wins pretty easily from team mate Hulkeburg. Vettel and Alonso take a couple wins for Ferrari and Ricciardo likewise for Red Bull. Highlight of season is Max winning the 2016 Brazilian Gp for Force India.\xa0\n\n2017 - Rosberg (Merc)\xa0 Very similar season to 2007 irl with just Ferrari‚Äôs Vettel and Alonso battling for championship and Rosberg somehow coming through to win it. Disillusioned Alonso leaves Ferrari and is replaced by Hamilton while Hulkenburg is replaced at Merc by Max. Carlos Sainz also gets his first win this year in dramatic race at COTA, he drives from Rrd Bull alongside Ricciardo in this timeline. Ferrari win constructors.\xa0\n\n2018 - Rosberg (Merc)\xa0 Undoubtedly one of the best seasons of all time. After race nine in Austria the top three in the championship are Vettel and the two Red Bulls (Ricciardo and Sainz). At seasons the championship is between three different drivers, (Hamilton and the Mercs) after the most insane Vettel bottlejob from like fifty points clear.\xa0 In last race Hamilton‚Äôs Ferrari breaks down (like Raikkonen‚Äôs irl) and though Max overtakes Rosberg he is left ruing his abysmal start to the year and Rosberg wins by a hair before announcing his retirement as a four time world champion and one of the greatest he sport has seen.\n\n2019 - Verstappen (Merc)\xa0 Verstappen wins for Merc this time after being given a run for his money by Hamilton at Ferrari. Max seals the title in Brazil. \xa0 Both their team mates (Vettel at Ferrari and Ocon at Merc) have poor seasons leaving the door open for Sainz to take third in standings for Red Bull. Vettel is replaced by Leclerc who spent 2019 at Haas.\xa0\n\n2020 - Verstappen (Merc)\xa0 Total domination akin to 2023 irl. Ocon is no match is he has a pretty poor season \xa0just like irl.\xa0 Also like irl, practically everyone aside from backmarkers gets podiums. Daniel Ricciardo is best of the rest for Red Bull. After Ocon‚Äôs poor season Russell is promoted to Mercedes. Hamilton and Leclerc get the best results possible out of THAT Ferrari.\xa0\n\n2021 - Verstappen (Merc)\xa0 Not as exciting as real life. Russell wins plenty of races and keeps championship interesting but towards end of season Max just streaks clear. Red Bull don‚Äôt have Max in this world so though Sainz and Ricciardo take some wins neither can beat Max in the Merc.\xa0\n\n2022- Leclerc (Ferrari) Take your pick who wins this 6 way championship battle.\xa0 You have Sainz and Ricciardo in Red Bull who both have pretty bad seasons particularly Ricciardo.\xa0 Then you have Leclerc and Hamilton at Ferrari. Hamilton struggles with Ferraris bad porpoising while Leclerc still has to deal with Ferrari reliability and strategy.\xa0 Then in Merc you have Max and Russell. Both have great seasons, particularly Max who is battling for the championship all the way to the end in THAT Mercedes. It comes down to Max, Leclerc and liaise shot for Sainz with Leclerc winning it in Abu Dhabi.\xa0\n\n2023 - Carlos Sainz (Red Bull) So Ricciardo is replaced by Norris at Red Bull and we get Carlando 2.0 as they have the best car.\xa0 Both have good years with Sainz only winning because he is more engrained in that Red Bull car after six seasons there.\xa0 They don‚Äôt make the Red Bull look quite as good as Max did and Leclerc, Hamilton and Verstappen all take the odd race wins with Oscar Piastri also winning in Qatar.\xa0\n\n2024 - Charles \xa0Leclerc (Ferrari) Again, take your pick who wins this one.\xa0 You have Lando and particularly Carlos dominating early season races for Red Bull before the convergence. Leclerc beats Hamilton at Ferrari and goes for his second title.\xa0 Piastri and Bottas are McLaren drivers and start winning when they get best car but neither has the outright speed of Norris. Max and Russell take plenty of wins but are kind of having their own little civil war.\xa0 Ultimately Leclerc actually wins the championship and the Constructors goes to Ferrari.\xa0 For 2025 season Bortoleto is promoted to McLaren to be Piastri‚Äôs team mate. Red Bull keeps Carlando. \xa0Verstappen is sick of Merc and jumps to Ferrari alongside Leclerc and Antonelli is promoted to be Russell‚Äôs new team mate at Merc.\xa0', 'https://preview.redd.it/b09sa076ydre1.jpeg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50195c179d247f055f46662b22651e0b2162d7e0', ""Lando (or whoever it is) won't be crowned champion until the prize gala after the end of the season. Until that point Max is still champion and can use number 1"", 'The champion retains his status until the end of the season.', ""He would probably push in that direction, but I think we should be clear about one thing: the current Red Bull is not Verstappen's ideal car.\n\nVerstappen has been increasingly vocal over the past year or more about how difficult their car is to drive. The key is that his talent allows him to drive around pretty large issues with the car and still extract the results, while his teammates have not been able to do the same.\n\nRed Bull had a car at the beginning of 2023 where Verstappen could win every race and Perez could be on the podium, or even challenging Max for wins in a few cases. Some of that is the gap to competitors being larger, and some of that is the car being easier to drive.\n\nNow at the end of 2024 and the start of 2025 they have a car where both drivers complain about how difficult it is, but Max is usually in the top 3, while his teammate has often gone out in Q1. The car feels worse to both of their drivers, and both would prefer it be nicer (and probably more like their 2023 car) but Max is simply able to drive around the problem better.""]",1,19,0.66,1,18,18,0,10,0.0,0
1jl06i2,The Alien Trap: Is Red Bull Racing Repeating Repsol Honda's Mistakes with Marquez in MotoGP? [OC],https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jl06i2/the_alien_trap_is_red_bull_racing_repeating/,2025-03-27, Discussion,"For anyone here who follows MotoGP, you know how Marc Marquez dominated in the 2019 season on a bike that other riders complained they couldn't get the best out of. Marc's preference? A bike that is very front-sensitive, allowing him to place it exactly where he wanted it, being fast across all racetracks. Pedrosa, Lorenzo, Espargaro, Crutchlow, Rins, Mir ‚Äî so many riders, most of them multiple world champions, failed on the RC213V and ended their careers. Honda rookies kept failing since 2016 on a bike that was too unforgiving.

While the front-end sensitivity of the bike helped make up for the slight power deficit the RC213V engine had, it also needed the riders to push too heavily on the front end. Making up time in braking was Marc's style, and the bike developed in that direction. Please the golden boy, the blessed alien, and you'll get the most dominant season in 2019. What follows when he injures himself? Disaster for four straight years. Come 2025, Repsol has left MotoGP, Marc Marquez is dominating on the factory Ducati, and Honda has to start fresh. They stay happy with point finishes. Guess Marc's main sponsor? Red Bull.

Does this sound familiar?

Kvyat, Sainz, Gasly, Ricciardo, Albon, Perez, Lawson, and now Tsunoda will step into the highly sensitive and yet slow car that Red Bull's other alien, this one in F1, has mastered. Or has he? Red Bull as a company relies heavily on backing aliens, and right now, there are just two in F1 and MotoGP. Yes, Verstappen can work wonders, but it has a limit. A crap car is a crap car. The world saw what Marc Marquez did on a year-old Ducati. He chose to go into the 2024 season on last year's undeveloped non-factory Ducati and gave the factory riders a run for their money. Who knows? Maybe Verstappen can take a page out of Marc's playbook and try the Racing Bulls car, perhaps. Because the RB21 doesn't seem to be pleasing him too much.

The trap of a team or manufacturer falling into alien-oriented development of their racing machine is far too real and evident in the cases of both Max Verstappen and Marc Marquez. Both teams have sabotaged their driver development programs, and juniors are more scared than ever.

If my theory makes sense, which it does to me, Red Bull Racing is headed for a dark and bleak future, especially with so many seniors, including Newey, departing. Horner and Marko both seem to have developed an arrogant and disrespectful attitude towards others. Guess where else it happened? Alberto Puig at Repsol Honda. I remember talking to a friend in 2021, saying, ""This guy will drown Repsol Honda if things continue like this."" Honda played along the same way they are right now. Forcing a Japanese rider, Hiroshi Aoyama, alongside Marquez. If it isn't working for Red Bull anyway, we might as well push our Japanese guy onto the grid.

To conclude, this combo of Red Bull over-emphasizing on aliens, opinionated boomer management, and Honda's opportunism and rigid values have doomed one team and multiple junior driver careers. It is only a ticking time bomb at Red Bull Racing Honda. I would love to hear your opinions, but with what's happening with Lawson and Tsunoda, it is heartbreaking. Verstappen doesn't seem happy either. Red Bull's decline in F1 has just begun.",[],0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0
