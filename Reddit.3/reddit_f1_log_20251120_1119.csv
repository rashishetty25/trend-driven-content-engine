1p15wh1,[SkySportsF1] Jenson Button believes Ferrari chairman John Elkann should have talked to Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton rather than criticising his drivers,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p15wh1/skysportsf1_jenson_button_believes_ferrari/,2025-11-19, Social Media,,"[""Yeah, so he's got an issue with his drivers fronting the media and airing their problems so he..... fronts the media to complain about it?\n\nGrow up, the drivers own the hearts of the fans, how did you think this was going to go for you?"", '\nImage source: [SkySportsF1 on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRPGiF3lzgi/?img_index=2)\n\n\n**Jenson\'s full quote to the question about Elkann and his statements:**\n\n\n>*""They have always had the pressure to perform, every F1 team does. But especially Ferrari. You\'ve got the whole of Italy wanting Ferrari to win races. So there\'s a lot of outside pressure and internally for the whole team, that\'s for everyone in that team.

Montezemolo decided to rock a steady boat with Schumacher, Todt and Brawn at helm because he was hurt and affraid due to him not being as revered as the aforementioned trio and because he started to lose the political power within the team. So he gave Schumacher an ultimatum to either drive alongside Kimi or to retire.  Afterwards he got rid of Kimi to get Alonso and there were also rumors of Ferrari wanting to get rid of both Massa and Kimi in 2008 due to them underperforming in the eyes of the team.\n\n\n\nAfter a certain amount of time, Alonso had enough of Ferrari\'s ""mishaps"" so he started to criticize the team and to flirt with RBR by openly wishing to get a RBR car as a Christmas gift.\n\nThat had ruffled Montezemolo\'s feathers so he opted to rehire Kimi as a sort of punishment for Alonso\'s missbehaviour and started to hold talks with Vettel to replace him.\n\nJust as Vettel had started to drive for Ferrari, Montezemolo gets pushed out and replaced by Marchionne.\n\nVettel being Montezemolo\'s signing  didn\'t really receive the love and support from Marchionne who even decided to hire Leclerc because he wasn\'t sure that Vettel was as good as he was perceived due to Kimi not being a proper benchmark. \n\nMarchionne dies, Elkann takes over. Elkann shifts the team dynamic over to Leclerc which resulted in Vettel not having his contract renewed and Sainz being Elkann\'s signing.\n\nSame Elkann gets rid of Sainz to sign Hamilton while offering him a fruitful deal so he could boast about how he had signed statistically the best F1 driver to ever grace the sport.  The team as a whole underdelivers and what does he do?

Any time they get grumpy, it's a little bit actually towards me and Andrea because we're trying to be fair and balanced. And I think the fact that they've both been a little bit grumpy at times with us actually tells you things have been fair and balanced because we're trying to make sure they race clean, and they are.  
  
All the incidents that they've had, which isn't that many, have all just been, at the end of the day, racing incidents. But we want to make sure the championship's decided on the track and not through that. I think we're lucky that we have the two drivers that we have.  
  
I'm not sure that Andrea and I and the team would be able to manage other drivers the way we can Oscar and Lando. So I think a lot of credit is due to just who they are as individuals. And that's part of our recruiting process for drivers is character, and do they do they think like us? And we talk about the elephant in the room all the time.

also alain prost is the only driver in the history of f1 to beat 5 different champs in equal cars (Niki lauda - Kiki rosberg - Ayrton senna - Nigel mansell - Damon hill).  
I understand why people say that senna was better, because senna was actually way faster than alain prost in qualy pace and race pace, but in the 80s raw speed wasn't as important as it is now. tyre management, fuel management, strategy and many other things that was more important back then compared to now, and alain prost was the absolute best at most of these things which made him a 4 time world champion and one of the greatest ever, if not the greatest.

So Prost pretty much always went into the race with the “hardest driver to overtake” (according to Mansell) ahead of him, and despite that, Prost never lost to him on total points scored over the season. This is because of the difference in philosophies: Senna was raw speed while Prost was very intelligent and always prioritised a setup that would grant him better tyre management and fuel consumption.

1p1csr9,Qualifying theory similar to reverse Grid,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p1csr9/qualifying_theory_similar_to_reverse_grid/,2025-11-19, Discussion,"So, I've had a theory pop into my head and have worked on it a little with the help of Chat GPT.

It came about after Max put in his Pole lap at COTA with 1 run in Q3 waiting for track evolution, he came out, did an incredible lap and that was it.

My idea is basically, that the top 5 in Q1 would lock in the first 5 positions and then end there running. Q2 would be the next five and Q3 would be the rest of the grid 11-20.

A major part of this process would be to allow the smaller and slower teams/drivers a little more time on the track, and also mean the top dogs would have to come in swinging straight out of the gate. With the potential for a rookie to put in a banger of a lap from the get go and start from a better position, intentionally shaking up the starting grid, as we've seen from Max and Brazil the last 2 years starting from the back isn't necessarily the end of the race. (Although I am very aware that not everyone can do what Max can).

My main question is, I am probably wrong in the approach, so why would it be so bad?","[""Tires. You've completely disregarded tire allocation and wear.\n\nSorry...You AND ChatGPT disregarded tires."", ""So you immediately know who's on pole?\n\nWho's watching to the end of the session, to see who fills the back of the grid? \n\nThis is the antithesis of a climactic qualifying."", 'Why would anyone keep watching once pole is decided?\xa0', 'If the top 5 in Q1 have their positions guaranteed, why would anyone run Q2 and Q3? Why waste the tires, why put wear on the parts, when there is no benefit, even if they do a faster lap than the top 5 Q1 guys?', 'Defining the top positions in the first part of qualifying is not good for tv ratings.\n\nCurrent format has worked well for many years. It has a few quirks, accidents causing red flags, in some circuits congested final laps.', 'I like this in theory. To get pole you just show up and nail the fastest last while navigating traffic with little track time and no track evolution. But as others have said there are problems:\n\nThe way things are now with tire allocation, your pole sitter and top 5 would have extra tires available for the race. Meanwhile the person who tops Q3 would have used all his available softs just to get P11 and then everyone in front of him has extra sets for the race and will have every strategy available to them, making it even harder for that last group to make up ground.   \n\nMy other problem is more of a sporting one. Usually quali times drop right to the very end, with the last group setting the fastest times of the session due to track evolution, driver confidence and less traffic. Your proposed structure would more than likely lead to the pole sitter not setting the fastest lap in qualifying. Rather, the person in P11 (and probably a few more) would be faster than those out in Q1. \n\nThat being said I kinda would like something like this, just to change up the format a bit. I suggest doing this for sprint quali at first, especially since they already kind of control tire allocation. Just have ""Sprint Qualifying Tires"" that are use it or lose it. The tires are for qualifying only and don\'t come out of team allocations. Due to the shorter sprint race distance the strategy doesn\'t change that much anyways. And as far as my second issue with this goes, I don\'t think many fans (and possibly drivers too) would care if the sprint pole wasn\'t necessarily the fastest lap set. \n\nI feel like they could do something like this for the sprint races and actually make them fun and exciting, not just previews of what we\'re about to see on Sunday. Honestly they kinda ruin the GP imo.', 'Nah, chat gpt usually knows the difference between there, their and they’re', 'Agreed. \xa0That is a well-intentioned but poorly thought out, terrible idea.', 'Because you’d rather start 6th than 20th?', ""This is what I was thinking. The average viewer wants to see who takes pole, not so much who qualifies outside the top 10. If pole is set within the first 15 minutes of qualifying a lot of people are not going to continue watching the session and that's going to affect TV ad revenue.""]",0,22,0.22,0,138,138,0,0,0.03,0
