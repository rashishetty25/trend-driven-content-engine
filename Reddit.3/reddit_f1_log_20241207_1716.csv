Everyone being like ‚ÄòThat was completely crazy!‚Äô But you know, you‚Äôre young. Monday I was at school, and I never really got to see it again. It‚Äôs very different to, I think, every other driver in the paddock, in that I was just so focused on my own thing and enjoyed so much what I was doing, I didn‚Äôt really take an interest‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n# ‚ÄòThe motivation for Hamilton at Ferrari will be crazy‚Äô\n\nSafe to say Leclerc is taking a close interest in Hamilton now. Sitting in Ferrari‚Äôs paddock home, surrounded by red shirts and hats to sign, Leclerc is well aware that the now seven-time-world champion is about to turn his ‚Äì and the team‚Äôs ‚Äì life upside down.\n\nIf he is concerned about the impact\xa0[the arrival of Hamilton](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/08/30/lewis-hamilton-ferrari-fans-monza-italian-gp-mercedes/)\xa0might have, he is playing it very cool. The Monegasque, who made history on Friday when he and younger brother Arthur became the first brothers to participate in a practice session as team-mates, is for the moment more concerned with the constructors‚Äô championship battle this weekend in Abu Dhabi. Ferrari begin the weekend just 21 points behind leaders McLaren and Leclerc believes ‚Äúeverything is possible‚Äù, although since speaking he has been handed a 10-place grid penalty for a battery change, which seriously hurts the Scuderia‚Äôs chances.\n\nWhatever happens this weekend, though, Leclerc accepts scrutiny on him is going to increase tenfold next year once Hamilton decamps to Maranello.\n\nFormula One‚Äôs most successful driver has endured a torrid final season at Mercedes and many believe Ferrari are splashing out ¬£50 million a year on a busted flush. Hamilton will be 40 by the time Melbourne rolls around next March and\xa0[some of the language he has used recently](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/11/30/qatar-f1-grand-prix-sprint-race-qualifying-latest-live/)\xa0‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely not fast any more‚Äù in Qatar last weekend a notable example ‚Äì had a note of despair about it. But Leclerc does not think so.\n\n‚ÄúI think the boost of motivation he‚Äôll get coming into a team like Ferrari will be crazy,‚Äù he predicts. ‚ÄúLewis is still exceptional. It‚Äôs been a tough season for Mercedes as a team. I think they‚Äôve been struggling with the car, and they explored a little bit like we did for those three races after Monaco, where you are exploring with the set-up, and that doesn‚Äôt help any of the drivers, and that makes it very, very difficult. Confidence is everything in Formula One.\n\n‚ÄúBut I have no doubts at all that I‚Äôll be facing peak Lewis Hamilton, and that it will be an extremely huge challenge.‚Äù\n\n**Full interview:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/12/07/charles-leclerc-ferrari-can-revitalise-lewis-hamilton-2025/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/12/07/charles-leclerc-ferrari-can-revitalise-lewis-hamilton-2025/)', 'Not with the way he ended this season.', '""He will lose motivated"".', ""Of course.

But I think there‚Äôs some things people aren‚Äôt considering about the overall picture which I‚Äôm surprised about. 

‚Ä¢ Yuki is on a 1 year contract atm at RB(jr) and it seems most expected that if he was to join Red Bull then his contract would carry over. Next year there could be driver openings and there is no real solid evidence that Red Bull are back on the up and not a continued stagnation downwards. 

‚Ä¢ If Yuki is good in the Red Bull‚Ä¶ then what‚Äôs really stopping him from joining another team if his contract will be short? It‚Äôs fair to say that after all this time Yuki probably has no loyalty/love for the Red Bull brand so if an equal or better offer came knocking you‚Äôd expect him to take it. Plus you have the incoming of Honda  (with a newey) to a team that might break Alonso with another year like this (or maybe stroll gives up, though unlikely). Toyota partnering with Hass who are massively on the rise (how far this partnership could increase is still to see). 

‚Ä¢ With Liam they have someone who they will be able to offer a cheaper, longer contract, with a selection of break clauses (not trying to repeat the Perez mistake) who will 100% accept it because he doesn‚Äôt have the possible future connections that Yuki has. 

I‚Äôm a Son of Law enjoyer and I hope he does well but I‚Äôm crazily surprised why Red Bull to them might not want to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù a year on a driver they might not be able to keep. ","['Maybe Red Bull know more with them then we do', 'Yuki is a upper midfield driver at best and i believe he is near his ceiling at the moment.\n\nI think RBR thinks Lawson could have the higher ceiling so they are putting the eggs in his basket.
