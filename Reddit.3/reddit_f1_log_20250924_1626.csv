1noqorn,The One Person in F1 That Max Verstappen Actually Listens To,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1noqorn/the_one_person_in_f1_that_max_verstappen_actually/,2025-09-23, News,"An interesting interview with GP! 

Some highlights for me:

>Nine years later, Lambiase now feels that his job every Grand Prix weekend is to be Verstappen’s “dad, a sports psychologist, best friend, worst enemy, everything,” he says. “You’re his complete circle of friends in one.”

After Hungary 2024

>The pair didn’t speak for three or four days after that. By the time they had cooled off, Verstappen and Lambiase were able to clear the air and get back to work. It wasn’t their first disagreement, and they knew it would be far from their last. Lambiase admits that he gets carried away, too. Instead of talking Verstappen off the ledge, he needles him a little more. And like anyone in a long-term relationship, he can detect a change of mood in the cadence of his voice.



>What makes this one work is their understanding that mildness doesn’t win F1 championships. “He’s very straightforward, blunt and honest, but he expects that similar level of treatment back,” Lambiase says. “If you try to pander to him—wrap him in cotton wool and try to be his best mate and be that yes-man—you will lose him within months","['Love getting to know more about their dynamic and how they work, they seem like one of if not the best engineer-driver combo out there', ""I really appreciate Max and GP's relationship; the trust between a driver and their engineer is essential. It's rare to find a pair like them. I believe Max even said that if GP ever leaves, he would too."", 'GP is Alfred', '> The One Person in F1 That Max Verstappen Actually Listens To\n>\n> \n> The only thing the Formula One world champion can hear over the roar of his 200 mph engine is the British accent in his ear. It belongs to Gianpiero Lambiase, and he’s the closest thing Verstappen has to a co-pilot.\n>\n> By Joshua Robinson\n>\n> Sept. 20, 2025 9:00 am ET\n> \n> Max Verstappen prepares to drive during a practice session ahead of the Italian Grand Prix.\n>\n> From the moment that Max Verstappen buckles his seat belt, closes his visor, and feels the first revs of his engine vibrate through the chassis and into his bones, he is completely alone at the wheel of his Formula One machine.\n>\n> Or nearly alone.\n>\n> For the next two hours, Verstappen navigates the pressure cooker of a Grand Prix with nothing but his instincts, his reflexes, his explosive temper—and the soothing tones of a measured British accent in his ear.\n>\n> The voice, broadcast directly to Verstappen’s helmet and bumping up against his own thoughts, belongs to Gianpiero Lambiase. He is the British-Italian engineer who has sat on the pit wall, on the other end of Verstappen’s radio, coaching and cajoling one of motor racing’s most temperamental geniuses. They’ve spent nearly 100 days a year together for almost a decade, through foul-mouthed rants and four world championships. One former boss compared them to “an old married couple.” \n> \n> But in Verstappen’s one-man cockpit, Lambiase is actually closer to a co-pilot.\n> \n> “Both of us have quite fiery characters, and I think that’s good,” Verstappen says. “I wouldn’t want it any other way, honestly.”\n> \n> From the pit wall, any number of Red Bull team officials can radio into Verstappen, including the team principal. When Verstappen pushes his button to talk, however, the only person he can reach is Lambiase—which isn’t to say the conversations are private. In recent years, Formula One has made all race radio available to every team, allowing rivals to listen in, and snipped the juiciest exchanges to be aired on the live broadcast.\n>\n> So everyone in F1 has heard Lambiase be insulted, cursed at, adored, and praised by the Dutchman at the wheel. Even Verstappen occasionally reminds himself that he and the man he calls GP aren’t on a secure line.\n>\n> “You remember GP has a family as well, so they are watching,” he says. “If you are, you know, shouting on the radio, that is not always a nice thing for them to see.”\n> Gianpiero Lambiase is the only race engineer Verstappen has ever known at Red Bull \n>\n> That doesn’t always stop him. Verstappen, 27, was one of the primary targets of motor racing officials’ efforts last year to curb the use of profanity over the radio. In Singapore, he was ordered to “accomplish some work of public interest” for his inappropriate language during a news conference.\n> \n> But in the heat of the moment, at 200 miles per hour, the odd radio F-bomb is an occupational hazard. Lambiase knows enough not to take them personally.\n>\n> “Mate, this car is just undrivable,” Verstappen fumed during the British Grand Prix this summer. “F—!”\n>\n> Lambiase, 44, is the only race engineer Verstappen has ever known at Red Bull, the team he joined at the age of 18. And, initially, the University College London-educated mechanical engineer felt intimidated. He’d been entrusted with the care of F1’s newest wunderkind, a driver destined for world titles from the moment he first zipped up his overalls.\n>\n> If they couldn’t forge a good working relationship, then Lambiase had no doubts that his career as a Red Bull race engineer would be a short one. Nine years later, Lambiase now feels that his job every Grand Prix weekend is to be Verstappen’s “dad, a sports psychologist, best friend, worst enemy, everything,” he says. “You’re his complete circle of friends in one.”\n>\n> He is also Verstappen’s eyes for everything beyond the narrow letterbox of his helmet. Lambiase fills in the picture with news of weather, track position, and the competition. The important thing is to pick his spots, because Verstappen won’t be shy about telling the pitwall to zip it—just like the time in Austin that Lambiase kept babbling to Verstappen in high-G-force braking zones.\n>\n> The engineering part comes in when Lambiase is helping to devise strategy and the constant barrage coming at him from around 16 radio channels connected to every department—chassis performance, aero control systems, tire monitoring. On the pit wall with his nose glued to a bank of monitors, he sometimes looks like he’s running an Apollo lunar mission.\n> Verstappen was one of the primary targets of motor racing officials’ efforts last year to curb the use of profanity over the radio.\n>\n> They are the highest-performing race cars in the world. Each one is its own miracle of engineering. But equally, a million things are always going wrong. Lambiase can see the problems bubbling up in the data and Verstappen can feel them encased in the cockpit. What sets Verstappen apart is how effectively he can translate a vibration in his wrists or the texture of his brakes into usable data. \n>\n> Then it’s up to the guys wearing headsets to survey the state of the race and decide what constitutes an emergency. \n>\n> “You’re on a boat down a river, and you’re surrounded by a whole load of crocodiles,” Lambiase says. “So you’re dealing with the closest crocodile to the boat. That’s all we’re doing.\n>\n> Sometimes, though, the crocodiles are coming from inside the boat. That was the case in Hungary last year—and it sent Max-GP relations to their lowest point.\n>\n> The problem was a disagreement over pit-stop strategy, which Verstappen felt cost him vital track position. In no uncertain terms, he let Lambiase know that he blamed him for his race going down the tubes.\n>\n> “You guys gave me this f—ing strategy, OK?” Verstappen said. “I’m trying to rescue what’s left.”\n>\n> The pair didn’t speak for three or four days after that. By the time they had cooled off, Verstappen and Lambiase were able to clear the air and get back to work. It wasn’t their first disagreement, and they knew it would be far from their last. Lambiase admits that he gets carried away, too. Instead of talking Verstappen off the ledge, he needles him a little more.

Millions may be eavesdropping, but wherever they are, however fast Max is going, Lambiase and Verstappen have no time for anything more than clear, direct, us-against-the-world conversation.\n>\n> “You have to do what is right for the team and driver at the time,” Lambiase says. “And if you start being concerned about what you’re saying, then I think you’re lost in showbiz.”\n>', ""Personal favourite Silverstone 2020\n\nCan we win this race?\n\n> If you get on with it, maybe.\n\n*****\n\nJust a dynamic you can't buy.

There's new regulations coming up where stability is key. Which is why most teams who signed their drivers for this year also signed them for 26.

1np9zmr,A series of questions about “low downforce”…,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1np9zmr/a_series_of_questions_about_low_downforce/,2025-09-24, Technical,"The recent conversations about red bull’s step in performance and whether it is just track-based have raised a few (semi-related) questions for me that im just gonna lump under this post. Feel free to address any portion of it. Apologies for length.

I understand that red bull performs better on low downforce or low deg tracks which i understand to be a recurring feature of their car, not just this year. But then im reminded of vegas 2024 where there was a lot of discussion about their lack of low downforce wing. It had been speculated that they just forgot to bring it and then eventually it was said that they just never developed it. Are they able to get away with not developing for the lowest possible downforce because they already tend towards lower downforce configs? If so, why did they wind up needing to take a saw to their wing?

Follow up question. What about the car makes it better for low downforce vs mclaren? Is it just that the car inherently generates less downforce because of its design? Or are they doing something specific? In simple terms, what is determining how much downforce a car has?

Finally, when we talk about low vs high downforce tracks, my simplistic understanding is it just that low speed corners and straights require less downforce and dont want drag. And high speed corners require the car to kind of stick to the track more? Is there more to it than this? And also, silly question, what makes a corner fast vs slow, what about the corner itself drives this?

TIA!

Edit: i realized i wasnt paying attention and reversed what i meant. That high speed corners need less downforce and low speed required being glued to the track more, right?","['So different cars have different strengths.\n\nDownforce comes at a cost of drag, if a team can generate their downforce cheaply for very little drag then it means they can generate more without losing too much top speed.\n\nThis is a huge advantage.\n\nHowever once you come to low downforce circuits this advantage can be wiped out as you aren\'t bolting that downforce on.\n\nSome cars inherently more ""slippery\' through the air and naturally generate less drag making them well suited to low downforce circuits. Has often been a feature of Williams cars for example.\n\nBut once they try and bolt the downforce on it is less effective with lower peak downforce figures and more costly with higher drag penalties for a given level of downforce.\n\nAs to why Red Bull didn\'t develop low downforce wings it becomes a cost benefit analysis. If the low downforce parts are only useful for a couple of races then that development effort and budget might be better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn the days of infinite budget you can guarantee that every team would have a Monza and Monaco specific package if they could afford it.\n\nIn days of budget caps teams need to be more sensible with their spending and develop things with wider use windows.', 'Downforce and Drag are related. \n\nThe same aero elements which keep you glued to the track in medium and high speed turns create drag on the straights which reduces your top speed.\n\nWhich is the whole concept behind DRS', ""I could be wrong, but low and high downforce setups are tweaked with the front and rear wings, but the floor isn't tuned differently per track. So having a car thats good on low downforce tracks probably means you have a very good floor design that doesnt produce much drag."", "">i realized i wasnt paying attention and reversed what i meant. That high speed corners need less downforce and low speed required being glued to the track more, right?\n\nEvery corner is helped by having more downforce.\n\nA car with high downforce will take a high speed corner even faster than one with less downforce.\n\nOnly time that doesn't help is if the car isn't grip limited around the corner (something like Curva Grande at Monza turn 3).\n\nDownforce is a compromise between straight line speed and cornering speed.\n\nExcessively low speed corners don't benefit as much from downfoce as downforce only really kicks in above 100kmh really, so it is more noticed in medium and high speed.\n\nThe length and frequency of the straights determines downforce levels more than the corner profile really."", 'Downforce is related to the car with the equation. This is generally produced by the wings and other aero pieces that can generate lift (negative lift):\n\nF = - (ρ * Cl * A * v^2) / 2\n\nCl is the coefficient of lift. Hence the - sign. \nρ is the density of air\n\nDrag is related to downforce with the equation: \n\nF = Fd^2 / ( π * AR)\n\nFd is the force of downforce and AR is the aspect ratio of the wing. \n\nThese are very basic ways to look at complex systems but you can see how downforce increases with the square of velocity and drag increases with the square of downforce. This means the efficiency of a car to produce downforce massively impacts drag. So each team is trying to maximize Fd while absolutely minimizing AR. So that means you need to create efficiencies with the total area and the cross sectional area. This is all occurring downstream of other effects so you also need to calculate the impact of all of those leading to the surface you are trying to optimize. In general when people say a car is good in low downforce its probably something along these lines', 'I hope that this gives you a bit of a clearer picture of the situation when it comes to Red Bull vs McLaren: https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/tech-weekly-can-red-bull-and-verstappens-resurgence-continue-beyond-baku.3unGY4D5rVdxVHIfwyjB0z', '1. It’s not just that RBR have found a low-downforce setup working well for Max’s driving style, but also the fact that Pirelli brought harder compounds for the last two races, which made tyre-deg (RBR’s achilles heel) a non-issue\n\n2. Qualifying plays a very important role (even more so) at high-speed, low downforce circuits, since it’s very difficult to follow cars and overtake due to lesser effect of slipstream and DRS - both due to everyone running a low downforce configuration \n\n3. McLaren car has more mechanical grip than any other car on the grid, which makes it most efficient on tyre-deg but conversely makes it harder to strip downforce off at circuits like Monza and Baku. It’s all about design philosophy and trade-offs. In the past, RBR enjoyed dominance at high downforce circuits only to struggle at low downforce ones, while McLaren won at Monza in 2021 with a low downforce configuration because their car inherently lacked downforce. \n\n4. Low speed corners actually require higher downforce than medium to high speed corners because the entering speeds are low and you need high downforce to maximize exit speeds.

Thanks for the explanation. Are you able to elaborate at all about what makes something a low downforce circuit?', 'Underbody aero produces very little drag. For the sake of F1 discussions its more or less considered ""free downforce"". The hard part is trying to seal the floor edges which ironically requires drag inducing vortex generators on the overbody aero such as barge boards and the front wing.']",37,28,0.83,37,28,28,10,0,0.019999999999999907,10
