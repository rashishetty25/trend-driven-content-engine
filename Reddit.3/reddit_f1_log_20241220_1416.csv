To better integrate into the Italian team, as well as Loic Serra himself, the English driver is taking Italian lessons and it was no coincidence that he expressed a few words in our language already in Abu Dhabi, while entering the Ferrari box. ‚Äú99% of our work is in English but I think it is nice to know how to speak a little Italian for the mechanics and for the relationship within the team‚Äù ‚Äì said Fred Vasseur in this regard, who then took care to underline also in a somewhat joking manner that ‚Äúit is not essential for performance‚Äù. \n\n\nVasseur: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt difficult to convince Hamilton that the Ferrari project was excellent‚Äù\n\n\nBetween the end of last year and the beginning of 2024 , the planets aligned to bring Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari. ‚ÄúI think sometimes it\'s also a question of coincidences and last year they were all there, that is, Lewis was on the market and Ferrari had a seat available.‚Äù ‚Äì said the Ferrari TP at the traditional Christmas lunch in Maranello, who then wanted to focus on the arguments useful for convincing the seven-time world champion to accept the offer of the Italian team. ‚ÄúFirst of all, in 2023 we won more races than Mercedes. And the start of the season had also been good, so it wasn\'t too difficult to convince him that Ferrari would be a good project . And I think he had been thinking about driving for Ferrari for at least 20 years because we were already discussing it in 2004,‚Äù revealed the French manager.\n\n\nThe seven-time world champion will arrive at Ferrari after a very long experience in a team like Mercedes , quite different in its working methods and without that Niki Lauda who was fundamental initially and who made the environment within the Anglo-German team very special. ‚ÄúI am not sure that we have to do a copy and paste of what Mercedes did, where the environment worked very well at the beginning, a little less at the end.‚Äù ‚Äì said Vasseur ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy objective in fact is not to do a copy and paste of what has been done in the past, or to try to attract all the people from Mercedes and to create a Mercedes team that have not been champions in the last two or three years, but to find the best way to manage Lewis differently with our team, with our guys and our resources‚Äù. \n\n\n\nVasseur believes that managing the Leclerc-Hamilton duo will be even easier than the Leclerc-Sainz duo \n\n\nMuch of the curiosity of the insiders during the next season will be to understand and see how Fred Vasseur will be able to manage the desire of Charles Leclerc to enter the history of Ferrari by winning his first world title and that of a seven-time world champion who would further enter the history of F1 by becoming the first driver to win 8 world championships, the last with a Ferrari that has not won it since the now distant 2007 (drivers). ""This year my challenge was to manage Charles and Carlos, but I think it was part of our performance because I am truly convinced that emulation in the team is the key to the performance of the entire team , "" said the French manager, who thinks in a way that is practically opposite to the Red Bull identity, where all the efforts are concentrated on the Verstappen side of the box. \n\n\n‚ÄúWe had a couple of heated moments between Charles and Carlos. Monza 2023 or even Las Vegas 2024 for example. But in the end, I think it was beneficial for the team‚Äôs performance .‚Äù ‚Äì said Vasseur, who then wanted to explain how these sporting disagreements have never damaged the Scuderia in terms of points collected ‚Äì ‚ÄúManaging Charles and Lewis? I‚Äôm not particularly worried, given that they have a huge mutual respect and know each other well. They have been talking about their future relationship for months now.

He scored 57.1% of Alonso‚Äôs points that year compared to 66.1% vs Schumi. I would argue that isn‚Äôt due to Massa being weaker in 2010, but more the competition was much stronger. There were three top-tier cars in 2010 compared to two in 2006 and that one of those 2006 cars had a woeful Fisichella in it. An average day for Massa simply left him with a worse result - including relative to his team-mate - in 2010.\n\nThe next few years Massa dipped to 45.9%, 43.8% and 46.2% of Alonso‚Äôs points. However, between the 2012 summer break and Spain 2013, we saw a significant upturn in form that saw him score 66.3% of Alonso‚Äôs points - almost the exact same as he scored vs Schumacher in 2006, demonstrating that previous level was still within him. During that stretch he scored all three of his post-2010 Ferrari podiums and had some other excellent battling drives from positions of adversity like in Singapore. He also did it during a stretch where Alonso was quite clearly at the top of his game, so Massa was almost certainly the variable here. \n\nI think what really affected Massa from the start of 2011 until that late 2012-early 2013 spell was that Ferrari were much less competitive than in 2010, then in Monaco 2013 he had two heavy crashes and it felt like that dented his confidence, because he dipped again after that.\n\nPeople will say ‚ÄòSurely he improved in 2007 and 2008 and then declined?‚Äô.

Since we can only talk about current people, Vettel's first WDC was fourteen years ago. A lot of people have literally died in the last fourteen years. It's very difficult to compare legacy across eras. Even though obviously Seb and Max overlapped in their F1 years, their eras of dominance were significantly separate in sports terms. It's not as much because of Max that more people know of RBR now, it's much more because of Liberty media and Netflix, and other factors.\n\nUltimately, I think most people still think of Red Bull as an energy drink company that they know sponsors various extreme sports."", 'If the measure of ""legacy"" is only WDCs, even though their total WDCs are equal,  I would give Seb the edge as he was the youngest and the first WDC for RB.

In principle, it was a luxury problem, both would have deserved the promotion. But Lawson may have more room for improvement in the future. It was his mental strength in particular that tipped the scales in the end.‚Äù\n\n(Marko)\n\n>""It was very, very tight between the two of them. I mean, Yuki is a very fast driver. He\'s got three or four seasons of experience now. He did a very good job in the tire test for us in Abu Dhabi where the engineers were impressed with how he performed.\n\n>""With Liam, when you look and go into the analytics of his race, pace was slightly better in the races that he did. His qualifying pace was very tight with Yuki, and you\'ve got to assume that the potential with Liam having only done 11 grand prix, is he\'s only going to get better and stronger. He\'s shown real mental resilience and toughness.\n\n>""A couple of things have stood out with me with Liam - how versatile he is,"" Horner said. ""You put him into a situation, he gets on with it. If you remember his debut in Zandvoort after Daniel broke his fingers, he was racing against Max on his out lap.\n\n>""He\'s got that kind of gritty racer mentality. He did a year in the DTM where he adjusted to driving a Ferrari GT car incredibly quickly alongside Alex Albon and generally had the upper hand. And again, his racecraft has been really one of his key strengths. So he\'s not afraid to go wheel-to-wheel and even rub wheels where necessary. So I think he\'s going to do a great job for us.""\n\n>Horner added:\n\n>""The engineers have enjoyed working with him through the running that he\'s done this year. He\'s got a good work ethic as well. So it is great to have Yuki still involved with the Racing Bull scene next year. And of course he\'s on standby should he ever be required.""\n\n(Horner)\n\nthat is the reason given.

I think it would make sense to pair Tsunoda with whichever American driver Cadillac decides to thrown into their car. Firstly I know he‚Äôs associated with Honda and the typical move would be to Aston Martin, but depending on Lance and Papa strolls plans that might not be realistic to get a drive in 2026. But you put him in a Cadillac I think he‚Äôd succeed. He‚Äôd be the senior driver of the two (which he has experience with Nick and Lawson), he has a hunger and fire in him that I think would mesh well with American fans, and Japan and Honda has a huge presence here in the states. I could see him contrasting well with whatever American personality you put next to him and it would work from a marketing and sports racing perspective. I think he‚Äôs matured a lot, has learned a lot, and I genuinely a top 12 driver on the grid. Let me know if this is wishful thinking but as an American I‚Äôd love to see him in a Cadillac!","[""Fuck me some of these reactions to the news are ludicrous.
