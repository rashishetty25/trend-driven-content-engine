And restrictions are being studied...","['It’s Elf fuel and the early ‘90 again.\xa0\n\nIt was said that the Elf fuel used by the Renault engines in the early nineties which lead Williams to two championships gave them something like 60-80 hp, and only 3 employees knew the entire, secret formula.

We are talking about a chemical power that could be worth between 30 and 50 horsepower.\n\nAn enormity if we consider that Renault will leave the Circus because it pays a power deficit on the current unit of about thirty horsepower, that is to say the lowest value of the range. The teams are discovering that the oil companies (Aramco, Petronas, Shell, ExxonMobil, BP) are proceeding with a “rearmament” with dedicated budgets that for some are astronomical and others more limited. The effect is that important differences could be generated, moving what should return to being a championship of power units, a F1 of gasoline.\n\nThe search for chemical additives that can act as effective anti-knock agents, allowing for higher compression ratios in combustion engines, is leading some groups to seek partnerships with small, ultra-specialized centers capable of coming up with novel solutions.\n\nIt should not be surprising that in the budget cap of engines the cost of a liter of e-fuel was calculated at 200 euros. This figure is to be drastically reduced (150 euros?), introducing important bans on additive substances. Those who are more advanced in the development of new fuels will try not to get to the point of imposing stringent constraints, but it is becoming increasingly clear that without restrictions we could find ourselves as in 2014, at the start of the hybrid era, with an unchallenged and unchallenged domination of Mercedes.', ""Those first 3-4 years of this new regulation are going to be painful.
