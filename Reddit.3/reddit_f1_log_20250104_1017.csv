But a lot of people are acting like it's the end of the world.. Why do they say that if a f1 car passes the crash tests easily, then it's a bad thing? I don't have much knowledge on the topic of the cars and how 1 thing has impact on another so sorry 
People were claiming that it means that the car will be slower?? Or that's it's just ""bad"". Help? ","[""I think it really depends on the year - in this case, we're on basically the same regulations as last year, so if they are not overhauling the main structure that much for this years' car and already know they've minimized the mass of the structural stuff - they may have just been able to build it on the early end, get it done and that's that.  The efforts are more going to work on the aero (floor, wings and other dangly bits) that are not crash critical."", 'There are two schools of thought.\n\nIf you pass early, some say you probably could have made the car lighter (and lighter = faster) because you’re meant to fail, add weight, try again, over and over until you finally reach a balance of the lightest car that can pass the crash test.\n\nHowever if you pass extremely late, you might have to frantically pile a ton of weight on to get the car through because the concept is wrong. That’s what happened to Alpine in 2024, and they had a grossly overweight car to begin with because of it.\n\nFWIW, Ferrari and Aston were the first to pass in 2024.', ""It means absolutely nothing. Just pointless speculation about fans who know nothing about how Ferrari operates (and never will).\n\nCrash tests are just a standard safety procedure. Teams know how to pass it and can do it quite easily. Sometimes they don't quite make it the first time, because of how strict the test is. That has nothing to do with how fast the car might be. Maybe they just need to add a tiny bit of material in one place.\n\nThe teams always make it in the end, without much trouble (unless the team is incompetent and struggling to even build a functioning car). Red Bull failed the crash test multiple times in one pre-season recently and still ended up champions."", 'It doesn’t mean much. Didn’t Red Bull failed theirs like 2 or 3 times last year?', 'To answer your question, the idea is that if you pass your crash test too easily your car is unnecessarily safe.. typically what you want is to be just on the wrong side of the limit and then add material to the failed site.\n\nHaving said that no one knows what Ferrari have done and what their procedure is. The above answer is just to explain to you why people are reasoning it is a bad thing to pass on the first try.\nFor example Red Bull is known to regularly fail on their first try and then add reinforcements ..', 'Just wait till test day in Bahrain and FP1 in Australia. One way to lear if a car is good is during test day, who ever makes the most laps in all 3 days will equal a good car. Exaple Williams in 2023 and HAAS in 2024 both teams did in total of 400 laps and were preaty competitive in those years. Williams 2023 and HAAS 2024.', 'Will Alpine pass the test though ?', ""I wouldn't read too much into it this year... This is now going into the 4th year of this regulation, also this year's cars even though the may be a new design they're basically going to be evolutions of last years cars with the completely new regs coming next season.  Think more along the line of hundreds of small changes to last years cars  instead of new complete clean sheet of paper designs."", '![gif](giphy|jV0wXGqzUXNXFmShkC|downsized)', 'It could mean that they didn’t reach the full potential of the car they’re developing, because they could have pushed it farther, make it light enough that it fails the first time so they know exactly how much weight is the minimum required to pass. \n\nBut I don’t think there’s really a significant correlation between performance and speed of crash testing, at least I haven’t seen anyone go through and check that data.']",0,21,0.46,0,208,208,0,2,-0.019999999999999962,0
