1p8vagk,Impact and cost of street tracks,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p8vagk/impact_and_cost_of_street_tracks/,2025-11-28, Discussion,"Curious how impactful it is to cities that convert their downtowns to street tracks. Seems like it knocks those areas out of commission for a goodly while for set up and take down, plus the race days themselves. And the cost of installing grandstands, pit facilities, etc. I’m guessing tens of millions of dollars all-in? Clearly those towns think the economic or reputational benefit of hosting a race is worth it. ","[""> Clearly those towns think the economic or reputational benefit of hosting a race is worth it.   \n  \nCheck hotel prices in cities during a race weekend and compare it against a non race weekend.  \n  \nAt Las Vegas some suites with a view to a circuit went for 100k, at Monaco the nightly price increases from $500 per night to $20000 per night.  \n  \nFor regular circuits like Spa a $60 hostel 5km away suddenly costs $300 per night.  \n  \nWhile they don't directly benefit from it, the local economy and taxes from the event do help.  \n  \nOther circuits like Cota just get government subsidies that cover ~75% of the hosting fees, as without it they couldn't afford it to bring the circus to town.  \nhttps://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a1977191/cota-receives-293-million-texas-trust-fund-support-f1-us-grand-prix/"", 'It all boils down to the total cost for the facilities versus what the race visitors spend on lodging, food, and everything else.', 'First, don\'t assume that the municipality that hosts the race actually pays the costs for building out the infrastructure.  That cost is usually covered by the race organizer, in addition the race organizer usually also covers the costs associated with the safety and security procedures - they pay for the police overtime and they pay for the fire rescue teams.\n\nYes, there\'s a loss of tax revenue - but the impact of that revenue depends on where the race is actually located and many of these street tracks aren\'t actually located in the central business district of a city -  adjacent to, or on the edge of that district but not in that district.  Miami\'s a perfect example here - the race was originally proposed to be in downtown Miami, the local government refused and instead it\'s out at the Dolphin\'s stadium which is several miles away from downtown Miami and isn\'t located in a business district of any sort.\n\nBut the big thing is that the city gets fees, a lot of fees, from the organizer to hold the race on city streets.\n\nAlso, unlike say, Monaco - the decision to host a street race often gets a lot of resistance from residents.  It was extremely questionable if the Miami-Dade government was going to approve the race plans - and those plans were tweaked several times to get approval from moving the race out of downtown Miami - and then further changes to the track plan to keep the race fully on the grounds of the stadium and race on the street at all. Las Vegas - there\'s still a lot of pushback over that race from residents and part of the reason it\'s held overnight is because it reduces the traffic disruption that the race causes on The Strip and surrounding streets. There\'s also still no guarantee that Las Vegas will have a race for more than a few years before the city and county kick them out.\n\nWhen New Jersey almost got a race - it was going to be held in a State Park - again outside of a business district, although again it met a ton of resistance because there was a bit of residential around the venue.  Ultimately though, it was Superstorm Sandy that killed that plan, not the residents.\n\nAnd it\'s not just F1 - Nascar won\'t be holding another street race in Chicago in 2026, despite attendance rising every three years, and making numerous changes in the three years the race was held to minimize disruptions.  Chicago\'s race was ""loop adjacent"" and not in the loop, in a location that is frequently shut down for things like Lalapalooza and Taste of Chicago among other major events - and it still wasn\'t approved by the City to come back for 2026.', 'When it comes to my opposition to street tracks, my main one is that the lack of a permanent racing circuit deprives the local motorsport community of a year-round venue with high safety standards they can use to develop local talent. Permanent tracks also can enhance the local economy from year round activity. Youth tend to be influenced by exciting activities and hobbies, so what better way to support a healthier and safer release valve than to build infrastructure to facilitate a much more professional approach to motorsport in general.', ""You think it's economically profitable.   \n  \nI think those towns folk just see an opportunity to get some of that money in their own pockets and couldn't care less about if it's profitable or not."", 'Vegas I believe is paid for by F1 (Liberty Media) and taxes from tourists to the strip aka the casinos and convention centers.  The city of Las Vegas is a separate municipality from the strip, or ""Paradise"" as it\'s called.  From my understanding very little to none of the tax money from the people that actually live in Las Vegas and their local economy was used.', 'NASCAR coming back to Chicago would have also required a new contract. The one they had was for three years, the last of which was this year.\n\nChicago has the ability to negotiate new terms more favorable to them for 2026 and beyond. This put a pause on the race for 2026, 2027 is still open.\n\nNASCAR wants to explore doing this in other cities and locations and next year they are going to the Nacal Base Coronado in San Diego.', 'And Miami is a private venture by Red Bull, Bainbridge Capital, Hardrock & Amex.  \n  \nMeaning currently, bar Monaco, all other street circuits are Petro States with a hint of sports washing.  \n  \nFor Las Vegas the paddock part is also a plot of land owned by Formula One Group - but the large companies along the circuit have also a vested interest and can hike prices, Bellagio alone likely has a massive advertising budget for this, considering how prominent they are there for the post show tv time.', ""But that's my point though - the city isn't convinced that they want NASCAR back.""]",12,13,0.71,12,50,50,-1,0,-0.010000000000000009,-1

The other is you can have what’s called porpoising, which is an aerodynamic [characteristic] of these cars, they effectively bump up and down, and that’s what we had.\n“So we weren’t running too low, what we had was too much porpoising. That came from a lack of data coming out of Thursday and Friday when all the sessions were raining. But yes, nine other teams did get it right, so at the end of the day we got it wrong.\n\n“The FIA is looking at it ’cause they also feel that the penalty’s a bit draconian. But it’s what the rules say.”\n\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella made a similar claim in a statement issued by the team yesterday. “The FIA itself has admitted that this lack of proportionality should be addressed in the future to ensure that minor and accidental technical infringements, with minimal or no performance benefits, do not lead to disproportionate consequences,” he said.']",0,79,0.32,0,1030,1030,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0
