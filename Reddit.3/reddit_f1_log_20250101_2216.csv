1hrcwr0,Thoughts on Stake Sauber’s F1 Reserve/FP1 driver(s) for 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hrcwr0/thoughts_on_stake_saubers_f1_reservefp1_drivers/,2025-01-01, Discussion,"
With Sauber's Academy/junior driver development seemingly still in somewhat of a limbo, at least until the full rebranding under Audi, I'm interested to see which drivers they take on in 2025, especially for their F1 reserve/FP1 nominated driver(s) when considering the increase in rookie FP1 session requirements for this season.

You would imagine that the Sauber FP1 rookie seats would really be super attractive to a whole host of currently non-Academy aligned F2 drivers, and up for offer to the highest bidder to gain exposure at the F1 level.

One thought that I have pondered is whether Enzo Fittipaldi may feature at all, in part as he seemingly hasn't as yet secured any race opportunities in either side of the Atlantic, and also in part to the common 'Stake' brand personal sponsorship he had in 2024.

Are there any thoughts as to which over junior academy drivers may potentially come under the Sauber/Audi banner this year and into next, especially with Pouchaire, Maloney and Schreiner all leaving?

Other than new F1 Academy driver pick Emma Felbermayr, and possibly a continuation with German karter Taym Saleh (who they really haven't hardly promoted at all these past seasons), things are looking really thin on the ground, unless they really are just waiting for the Audi rebrand in 2026 to relaunch the junior team with a bang (let's hope).

I also have a feeling that Audi stalwart Allan McNish may be involved in leading the new Audi F1 Junior Team when launched, in a similar head role as Pirro previously had at McLaren... I cant find the posts now, but do recall seeing an Instagram post earlier in 2024 of a Sauber Academy driver camp where McNish was in the background of some of the photos, and then in this below Insta post from Audi F1 engine development driver Neel Jani from back in November, where the Audi F1 engine base hosted the ADAC Team Germany Junior drivers, again you can see Allan McNish posing in the photos:

I personally think Allan would be a great addition, both from an operational and mentorship, and from an outward-facing general team/media point of view.","['I imagine for this year just whoever the highest bidder is.', "">a whole host of currently non-Academy aligned F2 drivers, and up for offer to the highest bidder to gain exposure at the F1 level\n\nThis year's Formula 2 grid looks pretty weak, if I'm being honest. The most promising drivers are already spoken for and the rest look very average.\n\n>One thought that I have pondered is whether Enzo Fittipaldi may feature at all\n\nI doubt it. He never really set the world on fire in Formula 2.\n\n>unless they really are just waiting for the Audi rebrand in 2026 to relaunch the junior team\n\nThat probably seems the wisest course of action. They appear to be committed to Hulkenberg and Bortoleto for 2025 and 2026, so assuming that goes to plan, 2027 would be the earliest they could take someone. Their best most would be to pick up someone in Formula 3 who either shows promise like Noah Stromsted, Javier Sagrera, Noel Leon, Roman Bilinski, Mari Boya or Laurens van Hoepen; or to take a gamble on someone who could become good like Bruno del Pino or Matias Zagazeta. But I expect that they would end up churning through a lot of drivers trying to find someone good."", ""Theo Pouchaire never has really impressed anyone in F1 tests! He is decent but nothing impressive, just look at the fact he didn't even get a WEC hypercar drive instead has been announced as a reserve driver there, so I am not sure if he will get the chance for FP!, as for what will happen to driver academy I would be surprised if it doesn't get rebranded because Audi statement said it bought the entire team and the academy was under the Sauber F1 operation"", 'Is it not still Theo or Zane?', 'F1 test like the the last one in Mexico with his car having brake problems forcing him to retire the car after 1 formation lap ? You are having a laugh', ""Did he do many F1 tests to make an impression? As far as I understand Sauber alongside Williams tend to do the least on that side as they cant really afford it. Like he'll do the odd tyre test but he's not testing 2 year old cars every other week like other teams are doing with their jnrs. \n\nI think with Pourchaire it's more just wrong place at the wrong time. I mean his jnr record is as good as drivers like Bearman, Lawson or Doohan just at the wrong team/driver academy really. If it was a pure meritocracy he shouldve been taken over Zhou, but now it's just too long on the sidelines and been jumped over by a younger more interesting prospect in Bortoleto (which is understandable)."", 'They both ""graduated"" from the academy a few weeks ago.', ""Doesn't make them not reserves.
