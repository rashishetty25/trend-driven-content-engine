1hnfkgi,"Arvid Lindblad is going to Formula Regional Oceania.

It's a winter series, and gives out points like any non-FRECA formula regional (18, 14, 12, 10, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0) while having a much weaker strength of field than another winter option like Formula Regional Middle East.

I believe Arvid has 28 Super license points at the moment. (30 if he got no penalty points last year, but it's hard to find reference for that. Picking up at least a point or two is very common so I think he probably did at one point.) So, he only needs 3rd in FROC to get a super license without even needing FP1s. (If you're trying to check my math, remember that karting SL points last 5 years. It's not something that comes up that often, but Arvid still has 3 SL points from karting that haven't rolled off.)

It is more respectable than doing F4 Middle East, which would be an option. Bedrin did it after his first year in F3. Formula Regional Oceania does have Red Bull history back when it was the Toyota Racing Series.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

I felt like I was watching 30 minute commercials selling F1 to a US audience. Driver spats! Inter-team rivalries! Will Buxton telling me this is the biggest moment in F1 history!\nDo people agree? Disagree? Is Drive to Survive season 3 akin to Breaking Bad season 3, and I’m missing some of the greatest TV of all time?!', ""Was China 2007 Raikkonen's greatest all round weekend performance? He topped every single practice session, Q1, Q2 and only missed out on pole position because Hamilton had 4 laps less fuel than him. Fuel corrected, he was on pole, also was 0.177 faster than Massa, having 2 laps more fuel than him (Massa made a mistake in the final corner though). \n\nHe was absolutely brilliant in the first stint, and was faster than Massa in 13 of the first 17 laps (As Massa pitted on the 17th lap of the race), despite having 2 laps more fuel than Massa. Pulled off 3 consecutive fastest laps, as Massa pitted and cut the gap to Hamilton from 8 to 4 seconds. And let's not forget, he did all of that in mixed conditions, so they were not dry at all. Also, Massa was running  3rd, just behind Raikkonen, so he has no excuse for roadblock or traffic as well. Both Raikkonen and Hamilton were left with the same set of wet tires after their stops, as they were not changed. Raikkonen conserved it better than Hamilton, and overtook him for the lead.\n\nA lot of people try to give Kubica a lot of credit for this race, but Heidfeld had 3 laps more fuel than Kubica, and still outqualified him. He was running ahead of Kubica as well, but Sauber pitted Heidfeld for the wet tires, while Kubica for the dry tires. Kubica got lucky that he pitted for dry tires at the right time, while Heidfeld had to pit after 4 laps again for the dry tires, so he lost all his advantage and dropped behind Kubica. Raikkonen pitted 8 laps after Kubica's stop for dry tires, and was only 3 seconds behind him. He had fresh tires, and with the car advantage, he would've won that race even then (In a case where Kubica got incredibly lucky). \n\nI know Raikkonen had some blisteringly quick/dominant drives in his McLaren years (Spain 2005, Monaco 2005, Silverstone 2004, France 2005 to name a few), but this one is so underrated because nobody talks about it at all. And, it happened on the 2nd last weekend of the championship, when Raikkonen took the championship away by 1 point after Brazil."", 'Does any one know where I can watch the sky broadcasts for past F1 seasons (particularly the 2010-2020 seasons) in Australia.

He doesn't narrate the videos, but he provides great written blurbs of analysis of drivers onboards and topics that rely on onboard footage to teach about certain F1 drivers styles, etc.\n\nBut I have a question. F1 is stupidly sensitive about copyright and protecting their stuff. How come his channel hasn't been struck by copyright (and hopefully never will be struck), whereas other YouTube content creators have been struck by copyright?"", ""Why aren't there any female drivers in the F2, F3 or F4 series?
