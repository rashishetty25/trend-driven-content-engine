They've all dominated in feeder series like F2/F3 or even Formula E, but stepping into an F1 car is a whole different beast. Everything is on another level. They're suddenly racing against seasoned pros who've been honing their craft for years.

And the problem is, these rookies often aren't given much breathing room to actually learn and develop. If they don't deliver stellar results almost immediately, the knives start coming out. Teams are under immense pressure to perform, and unfortunately, young drivers can be seen as the easiest variable to change if things aren't going to plan.

It's a pretty cutthroat environment. One bad race, or even a couple of slightly off performances, and suddenly their seat is under threat. Where's the time for them to really understand the nuances of the car, figure out their driving style in this new machinery, and build confidence? It feels like they're constantly under the microscope, judged on every single lap.

You see flashes of brilliance, for sure. A stunning qualifying lap here, a gutsy overtake there. But consistency, the hallmark of a top F1 driver, takes time and experience. Maybe we need to rethink how we integrate these young talents, give them a longer leash, and acknowledge that becoming an F1 star isn't an overnight thing. It's a tough gig, and expecting instant perfection might just be setting them up for failure.","['Except not all rookies straight up dominate f3 or f2\n\nIf you are talking about Doohan, he didnt win neither f3 or f2, despite having multiple shots.\n\nAnd if he is unlucky, then what can Pourchaire, Drugo say?

Maybe not because he supported Doohan and wanted to keep him in the seat, though -- probably because Briatore wields a lot of influence behind the scenes. Oakes always felt like a temporary figure in the team, especially given the talk that Renault are looking to sell it. Given that he aligned himself with the Mazepins, I don't think Oakes is some paragon of moral virtue; rather, I think he's playing Pilate and washing his hands of it. It's generally believed that ten teams is the minimum number that the sport could compete with, so Cadillac's entry means that the sport is less dependent on Alpine.

Norris still in the fight bringing home 10 points in P5 but the gap with Albon is increasing and now he also has to deal with Sainz.

Further back Hulkenberg picks up his best result of the season with a third place, propelling him up the order from P18 to just outside the top 10 and settles in at P11.

Yuki still on the bottom end every weekend, seems like he is still very cautious in the pitlane, him and Alonso still failing to score a top 10 finish this season.
