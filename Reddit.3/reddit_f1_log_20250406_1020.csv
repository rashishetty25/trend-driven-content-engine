But then the Dutchman put his Red Bull on pole position with a dream lap. There are four reasons why this miracle happened.\n\n> The radio call on the out lap spoke volumes. Max Verstappen loudly shouted his joy at his 41st pole position in Formula 1, his first since the 2024 Austrian GP, \u200b\u200binto the airwaves. Normally, the Dutchman is relatively relaxed on the radio. He\'s achieved so many victories and set so many fastest times in his career that one more or less doesn\'t elicit much emotion from him. But this time, everything was different.\n\n> The Formula 1 World Champion expected fourth place on the grid at best. His Red Bull struggled to find its form for three practice sessions, despite the engineers\' thorough redesign of the car. The Red Bull RB21 fluctuated between decent and undriveable. Verstappen complained that he never knew what the car would do in the next corner. In the third practice session, he was still half a second behind the McLaren.\n\n> Only the final intervention was successful. ""We completely overhauled our car,"" reported team principal Christian Horner. ""Everything was put to the test: the weight distribution, the downforce level, the damper, spring, and anti-roll bar settings, and the tire pressures.""\n\n> **Red Bull hit the window.**\nThe trump card played in crisis mode worked. Starting in Q1, the drivers sensed that the Red Bull was suddenly a good racing car again. ""The differences are minimal. If you fall out of the window by just a millimeter, you\'re immediately nowhere,"" Horner marveled. Verstappen praised: ""The car was difficult to drive for a long time, but we improved it step by step and worked our way towards a good setup.""\n\n> But then you\'ll still need Max Verstappen in the cockpit to convert the improved handling into the fastest qualifying time. ""I was at the limit everywhere, even a little over here and there,"" reported the defending champion. Not only that, Verstappen completed two clean laps in Q3. Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri, and George Russell all lost time in the first sector.\n\n> Piastri and Russell were blown away by the wind in Turn 2. On Saturday (April 5), the wind blew from the opposite direction to Friday. A tailwind made the notorious S-curves even more challenging than usual. Piastri\'s manager, Mark Webber, lamented: ""With any other Sector 1 time in his qualifying laps, Oscar would have taken pole position. But there\'s no reward for ideal times."" Horner applauded his driver: ""That was perhaps the lap of his life.""\n\n> **Verstappen\'s Fear Curve was Degner 2.**\nRed Bull responded correctly to the changed conditions. They opted for a touch more downforce to give the drivers more confidence through the S-bends. This also helped bring the tires into their temperature window for the beginning of the lap. But Verstappen\'s problem area wasn\'t the S-bends, but Degner 2.\n\n> Verstappen had lost two-tenths to the McLarens on every lap there, Horner revealed. Except for the decisive attempt. He was suddenly just as fast because he kept his tires in the window during the first section of the track to ensure optimal grip in his fear corner. The showdown in the duel with the McLarens was thus moved to the chicane before the start and finish. And there, the Red Bull driver took 66 thousandths off Norris.\n\n> According to Verstappen, pole position was the easier part of the task. Up until now, the McLarens had primarily demonstrated their strength in the race. However, there is a small glimmer of hope. The McLaren drivers were the only ones experiencing grainy front tires during the long runs in third practice. Norris more so than Piastri. An expert from the rivals commented: ""This suggests that they want to keep their rear tires as close to the temperature window as possible.""\n\n> Nevertheless, Verstappen prefers to play the pessimist for the race. He sees McLaren as the favorite. If it weren\'t for the weather. Rain is forecast for parts of Sunday. If that leads to mixed conditions during the race, it will play into the hands of the best Formula 1 driver. Piastri is unfazed: ""We\'re fast on both wet and dry tracks.""', ""Crazy performance by Max.

Interesting to see are their two different approaches: Lando lifts straight off the throttle and stomps then back on it, whereas Max has a more ""rounded"" approach to this. Lando gets the better exit and goes flat through T3, where Max has to lift slightly. Max gains time by being on the throttle longer inbetween T4 and T5, yet has a worse exit out of T6. In the Dunlop (T7), Lando has to lift slightly, which brings Max back to his tail. The Degners paint a clear picture: Max is longer on the throttle, lifts more gradual, yet steps on back on it just as quick, lifts more gradual, brakes 10 metres later and hops back onto the throttle as quick as Lando does. Nonetheless, has a worse exit out of the Degners and loses time approaching the Hairpin. Max has a slightly better exit out of it and begins clawing back speed to Lando. Spoon is the masterpiece of this lap: Braking about 40 metres later than Lando, he carries more speed into T14, where he doesn't bother with feathering like Lando, but steps once onto the accelerator. Yet, a significantly worse exits loses him quite some speed until T15. At the Casino Triangle, the strategy should be clear to everyone by now: Max brakes 30 metres later and and steps more onto the throttle inbetween T16 and T17, but has, yet again, a worse exit out of this tricky last corners. Lando gains much speed approaching T18, but is momentarily stationary on the throttle pedal. Max comes closer again and this was maybe the difference inbetween P1 and P2 today.

My conclusion: Despite his many complaints, Max has complete trust into the cars braking characteristics and is able to compensate much this way, despite not being able to step onto the the accelerator as soon as Lando (as seen inbetween the Degners and T16/17).  
(the eagle-eyed may have spotted, that Lando's throttle graph is slightly beneath Max's in the high-speed factions. In fact, he drives at 99%, a few spikes exclued, where Max is at 100%. Two theories of mine: Either the data is faulty OR McLaren has built in a mechanical resistor into the gas pedal, which the pilots have to overpower to get the pedal to the metal.

1jspixl,Jacques Villeneueve and Crofty,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jspixl/jacques_villeneueve_and_crofty/,2025-04-06, Discussion,"Everytime Crofty came on comms with a take that frankly, gave away he was a little lost since the race was mostly quali + pitstop strategy based and less on-track action/drama, Jacques goes ""yeahhh...."" then refutes his take with something more practical, less exciting and with a tone that might appear pretentious to some viewers. It was hilarious. Its like Jacques is trying to actively not tweak in his seat listening to Crofty's takes.

Although Villeneueve seems like he's a little stuck in the days he used to race in F1, I find his takes very insightful race craft wise (wdc afterall...), more than Crofty at least. And his opinion refreshing. I may not agree with him on some but it's refreshing to see a clash of opinions.

One instance during the last few laps: Crofty was like ""what are mclaren doing, let piastry pass lando to challenge max so we can finally have some racing"" and Villeneueve was like ""yeahh.... no he shouldn't, I wouldn't have lol. Every point counts individually, its champion mentality""


My conclusion is while Crofty's comms are more race focused with special attention to the viewers' entertainment, Villeneueve is more driver focused paired with his personal bias and opinions. I loved hearing both.","['I think the only combo that would‚Äôve been worse would‚Äôve been if they had Danica commentating\n\nPair of them made me want to cut my ears off', 'Jacques did shut down Crofty‚Äôs BS but usually then chriped in with his own BS which was worse because it was not even aimed at creating excitement', 'Crofty is the main reason I am paying for F1TV.

For 4 years you are a best-seller, industry leader, a soda giant. But then the 5th year your competitors start doing  something new.
