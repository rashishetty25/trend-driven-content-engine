# The Formation Lap

This week, we‚Äôre forgoing the typical *Last Week in Formula 1* preamble in favour of sharing a spot of news, dear reader and fellow racing fan.

There‚Äôs changes coming over the next week to *Last Week in Formula 1*, which include a new name and livery, along with the launch of a new weekly feature.

As this humble racing newsletter expands in scope, *Last Week in Formula 1* isn‚Äôt broad enough to capture all that will be published, hence the change.

Mums the word for now, but **the announcement will be landing in your inbox on Wednesday November 13th, bright and early at 6:30am PST.**

*(*[*Which is all the more reason to subscribe on Substack if you haven‚Äôt already.*](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/)*)*

Until then, you have the latest edition of *Last Week in Formula 1‚Äôs* mutterings and musings, twistings and turnings, tidbits and playtime to enjoy below.

*(If you missed last week‚Äôs issue,* [*you can find that one here.*](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-october-28-november-3-2024)*)*

**Now, for the uninitiated:**¬†

If you‚Äôre a rookie ‚Äòround these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly feature compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world into one easy, breezy, beautiful read.

Every fun fact, story, and piece of news has been sourced from posts in r/formula1 (AKA: Formula 1‚Äôs publicly accessible online paddock).

Given this is The Internet, I suggest taking everything you read with a grain of salt. However, over many years of following the subreddit, there‚Äôs far more truth than lies posted‚Äîand much of the news comes from reputable sources.

Lastly, like the cars we enjoy watching so much, *Last Week in Formula 1* and ¬† *nope, not this time either!* are in a constant state of development. Any feedback you have on what‚Äôs covered, the format, or anything I may have missed is welcome in the comments.

Now let‚Äôs hit the track‚Ä¶

# Trackside Stats

***Behold:***

* [The laps lead leaderboard in 2024.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjex8o/f1_laps_led_in_2024/)
* [The WDC state of play with 3 rounds remaining.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjk67a/f1_team_standings_after_2124_rounds/)
* [The WCC state of play with 3 rounds left](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1go45o8/f1_2023_vs_2024_constructor_standings_after_21/) (and compared to last year).

Proving that Maxi‚Äôs 4th WDC title has never *really* been in doubt or danger, despite Red Bull‚Äôs travails and McLaren‚Äôs rise, [Max has *still* scored more points than Lando since Miami](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gla8v2/max_vs_lando/), when McLaren‚Äôs season began gaining steam.

A whopping [*nine* of Max‚Äôs laps around Interlagos were good enough to claim Fastest Lap honours‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjk9iv/f1_nine_of_max33verstappens_lap_times_in_brazil/) His best being over a second quicker than Lando‚Äôs best.

Owing to‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure what, a mixed bag of causes I‚Äôm sure‚Ä¶ [Pierre Gasly has achieved 3 out 5 of his F1 podiums when starting from 10th or worse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjv0tv/fun_fact_pierre_gasly_has_achieved_3_out_of_his_5/)

For those following the riveting Black vs. Yellow T-Cam 2024 Championship, [here are the updated standings after Round 21](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl4hjc/black_vs_yellow_tcam_2024_championship_standings/) went down in S√£o Paulo.

Alas‚Ä¶ [Only 184 laps remain in this season for the ages.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gne0sw/f1_the_racing_has_been_fantastic_this_year_and_we/) Enjoy them all!

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

Is this news if hardly anyone is surprised? In an officially official statement, [Sauberaudi have confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkth3f/stake_f1_team_kick_sauber_team_statement/) that [Valtteri Bottas](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkyowb/valtteri_bottas_after_three_years_at_stakef1team/) and Zhou [Guanyu](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gktmna/zhou_guanyu_personal_statement/) will be leaving the team after this season, [paving the way for Nico Hulkenberg and‚Ä¶¬†](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkuhzn/f1_the_2025_sauber_driver_lineup/)

[Gabriel Bortoleto, who has been *confirmed* as a Sauberaudi driver for 2025.¬†](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkuhzn/f1_the_2025_sauber_driver_lineup/)

*(I‚Äôm pleased as punch about this development, as I‚Äôve been super impressed with Young Gabriel over his last two feeder series seasons, and am eager to see what he can do in Formula 1‚Äîeven if he is driving a tractor initially).*

As for Sauberaudi‚Äôs departing drivers, Zhou‚Äôs future is an uncertain mystery, while [Valtteri seems headed for a reserve/development role at Mercedes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl6o1y/mercedes_hinting_a_bottas_return_probably_as_a/)

In a poignant marking of this ending era at Sauberaudi, [former team strategist (under their Alfa Romeo guise) Ruth Buscombe Divey penned this *adorable* goodbye post honouring her time with Valtteri and Zhou.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gli4f3/thank_you_for_every_undercut_every_overcut_every/)

Meanwhile, [folks around the paddock seem rather confident that the Argentine surprise, Franco Colapinto, will be on the grid next year](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl3o1t/campeonesnet_mar%C3%ADa_catarineu_when_asked_to_rate/), somehow.

And if The Race is reporting that Franco is firmly [‚ÄúIn Red Bull Frame As Perez Replacement Option‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glmqc0/colapinto_in_red_bull_frame_as_perez_replacement/) for 2025 there‚Äôs *definitely* fire amongst all the smoke.

I don‚Äôt want to put too much stock in this, because Flavio Briatore mostly, but *apparently* Flavio has changed his mind on Jack Doohan sitting in their car next year and [he‚Äôs giving Franco the ‚ÄúI want you‚Äù stare from across the room.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glzwer/la_gazzetta_dello_sport_flavio_briatore_has/)

In other driver news‚Ä¶ [Shots have been fired from the portside cannons at FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem, courtesy of the Grand Prix Drivers Association (GDPA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glni62/grandprixdriversassociation_on_instagram_gpda/).

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

To the collective pain of Williams fans the world round, the team that‚Äôs been showing much promise and signs of growth this season, are having to accept that all may be for naught, at least in terms of rising in the WCC standings.¬†

Team Principal [James Vowles gave his honest assessment](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjkcdg/f1_im_hurting_right_now_james_vowles_gives_his/) of a torrid Brazilian Grand Prix weekend that began with so much promise, and was undone by big crashes and Alpine‚Äôs shock double podium rubbing salt in their wounds.

Speaking of Williams and their travails, in addition to likely losing $30 million in prize money, their recent spate of damages has them in a spot of bother, [leaving them uncertain of what car spec they can bring to Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glunax/unsustainable_run_of_damage_leaves_williams/)

The Middle East Oil Barons‚Äô gradual takeover of Formula 1 continues, with [Qatar‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund set to buy a minority stake in what is becoming the Audi F1 team.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gmnca2/tobi_gruner_according_to_our_information_qatars/) Audi will retain full control, but gain a cash infusion for investments into their Hinwil factory and such.
