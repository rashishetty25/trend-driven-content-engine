The wet is quicker than the inter, don't red flag the race for conditions because some drivers are trying (and successfully) trying to game the system or just making the wrong decisions by staying out or going onto inters and are thus struggling for grip. Unless there's a big incident that needs the red flag. Red flags should be for when the wet isn't good enough, not for when the inter isn't.""]",640,32,0.99,640,32,32,20,4,0.0,20

I just want to clear up a apparent misunderstanding of how the red flag actually benefited Verstappen in today's win. 

It all starts in lap 27 when Hulkenberg got stuck somewhere on turn 1, after the rain got increasingly more intense. Norris already asked a few times to be pit, since the intermediates from the start are getting more worn for most of the grid, which means less grip and a harder time for all of them to keep the car on track. 

# Lap 28/29 

Both of the leaders dive into the pit to try and get a cheap pit stop under the VSC conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/itpieu32bryd1.png?width=2472&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0a709e49f502ae77a817621aa7253fc60bc945

Gap back to Verstappen is about 19 seconds under the VSC conditions. Gap in racing conditions before the VSC was called was about 13 seconds. As seen in the photo, the VSC was ending when both of them came into the pit. 

# Lap 30 

Both of them have pitted, but notably they have both pitted on new intermediates instead of wet weather tires. The gap is now 13 seconds in favor of Verstappen. During all of this the rain intensity is at the peak of the race, and the conditions would call for wet tires, as shown by Tsunoda. He was about 17 seconds back from the lead pair at the point of pitting. He did however pit himself and at lap 30 he was already only 7 seconds back. 

https://preview.redd.it/4npm87owcryd1.png?width=2438&format=png&auto=webp&s=a445efc8f6f9dedb410d3ddcf976266c4ba36dc6

About 10 seconds after the above screenshot a safety car is called, since the conditions are about to be undrivable. Tsunoda in a timespan of about 10 seconds made up 4 whole seconds on his wet tires.

# Lap 32 

After a few laps behind the safety car, Colapinto find the wall and the Red Flag is called. The order under the red flag does not change.

# So how did the red flag benefit Verstappen? 

(This is the opinionated part, so please discuss if you think different) 

  
The real benefit of the red flag to Verstappen and a lot of the grid behind is obviously the free pit stop. However, the positions from Norris and Russell are arguably already won when they decided to pit under the VSC for new intermediate tires. 

If the red flag, or safety car had not been called they would have lost time to anyone that pitted for wet tires. Its in my opinion very likely that they would have had to pit again under the conditions we have seen, and with the wet tire runners so much faster. 

If there was only the safety car called, Verstappen would be in front of them anyway. In this case I think a few different things could have happened depending on the rain intensity. Whats most likely is that Verstappen would have tried to stay out as long as possible on his old intermediates, unsure if they can make the whole race, but it would have been interesting to see, especially since it would have taken a long time to clear enough standing water for a rolling restart, so I think the remaining laps under speed would have been about \~30 laps, but probably less, since it was raining a lot. 

In any case, I think the red flag was not the deciding factor for Verstappen today, but Red Bulls and Verstappens choice to stay out and not switch tires. 

Norris and Russell got new intermediates, so that was a gamble from them on a safety car as well, since there was no way to drive on anything other than wets at that point, and they would be dropped behind Ocon, Gasly and Verstappen. Really unsure what that strategy call was. 

Love to hear corrections and your input, good night to everyone going to sleep! 

","[""Switching to Wet is useless most of the time, if we're under Wet conditions it means a red flag is coming, we don't see wet tyres racing anymore. Norris and Russell bet on the rain easing off and everyone needing to pit for inter, Max and Alpine bet on the likely Red Flag due to the conditions."", 'I just wish they would have listened to george :(', ""I don't think it was bad strategy from anyone tbh, gambles from both sides and one side had it pay off, the other didn't. On another day the safety car comes in and the fresher tyres win out in wetter conditions.\n\nThe real strategy disaster was Leclerc being out of the picture before we even got to this stage because they had the bright idea to pit him into slow traffic that he was then stuck in."", 'The SC completely f\\*cked over the guys who made the right choice and went on the wets.', 'George wanted to stay out and McLaren is generally kinder on tyres so presumably Lando also had life left. It was less ‚Äúluck‚Äù and more a bad decision to pit in the first place. If they had tyre left, the only reasonable option is to wait it out.

There seems to be multiple people and sources saying there was ""long time"" between crash and Verstappen dropping out of top 10. Rewatched to confirm. First picture is moment yellow flags are thrown out (graphic isn't even fully shown yet), second one (1 second later) shows Leclerc making into top 10. Only thing Max lost here was p11 to p12 and he already has +5 grid penalty. Biggest loser here was Bottas who was robbed since Albon and Lawson got their times done (Albon when time left 1:09, Lawson when time left 1:03).

Tldr: no, there was less than 1 second for stewards to react for red flag which is basically impossible. Red Bulls dropped because they left themself last.

I'm also on the side that it took them too long to react (50 seconds).","['It doesn‚Äôt matter that Max didn‚Äôt get through, that is bad luck they all experience.

This accusation is, after the end of the 2021 season, potentially justified. However, the discussion has been doing an incredible disservice to the fact that the past few seasons have been an ongoing showcase of a potentially dangerous slowness to deploy Safety Cars, Virtual Safety Cars, or red flags. To educate myself and (hopefully) the rest of the subreddit, I went back and reviewed very SC/VSC intervention so far this season and made note of how long it took the race director to make the decision and neutralize the race. 

  
TL;DR up front, because this is going to be long; the average time this season between an incident occurring and a VSC or SC being deployed is a whopping \*48 seconds.\* 

  
Quick methodology notes up front: I used the very helpful [list of safety car interventions this season](https://www.lightsoutblog.com/every-safety-car-f1-2024/) by Nick Haldenby at Lights Out Blog, and went back to each race with the F1TV feed, the live timing, and a stopwatch. For cars that stopped alongside or on the track, I started the clock at the point when the car stopped moving (assuming that they wouldn't want to intervene in a race if a driver can quickly get moving again). Twice this season we've had VSC's deployed due to debris on the track, at Miami and Austria -- I've chosen not to include these as they would skew the average time calculation. So, here's the list:

  
Saudi Arabia, Lap 6: Stroll into the barriers, 50 seconds

Australia, lap 17: Hamilton stops on track, 20 seconds (from the moment of stoppage -- he did spend a long time trying to limp the car back)

Australia, lap 58: Russell into the barriers, 12 seconds

Japan, lap 1: Albon and Ricciardo collide, 23 seconds (race red-flagged)

China, lap 22: Bottas stops in the runoff, 1 minute 37 seconds (this was the incident reposted today of him exiting his car while standing at the end of the braking zone, under only yellow flags)

China, lap 27: Tsunoda and Magnussen collide, 15 seconds

Miami (sprint), lap 1: Norris and Stroll collide, 58 seconds

Miami, lap 29: Sargeant and Magnussen collide, 24 seconds

Monaco, lap 2: Perez/Hulk/Magnussen collide, 39 seconds (race red-flagged -- had to open Perez' onboard for this to even figure out when the crash occurred)

Canada, lap 25: Sargeant into the barriers, 40 seconds

Canada, lap 54: Sainz and Albon collide, 27 seconds

Azerbaijan, lap 50: Perez and Sainz collide, 1 minute 35 seconds

Austin, lap 2: Hamilton into the gravel, 53 seconds

Mexico, lap 1: Tsunoda into the barrier, 41 seconds

Brazil (sprint), lap 22: Hulkenberg stops on track, 2 minutes 2 seconds

  
The fastest reaction was a mere 12 seconds in Australia, while the longest came yesterday at 2 minutes and 2 seconds. However, that does still leave our average time at 48 seconds for this season. I did not take notes on every incident's on-track battles, but did notice that they didn't seem to favor one team consistently throughout the season. Without inside information that I doubt we'll ever see, it's impossible to know whether the delays are coming from a communications issue, a lack of confidence, or a desire to leave it as late as possible so the racing can continue (a la the old ""Racing back to the caution"" rule that NASCAR rightly did away with in the 2000's). Regardless, this is very clearly an ongoing issue, going back years, Taking longer than 60 seconds to make the decision for intervention should be a rare occasion, and yet we've had 3 such incidents this season.

  
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do the same analysis for the 2023 season yet, but I would like to. Without a convenient pre-made list of SC and VSC interventions, it's a bit more work, but if people would like me to I'll happily keep working on it (I might do anyway, just for my own curiosity). 

  
In parting, this specifically came out of my frustration at seeing people saying things like, ""any other race and they'd have sent the VSC out right away,"" when I clearly remembered this being a pattern of behavior from the officials. It's good to be aware of the potential for issues like that, but in situations like this where driver safety is being potentially placed at risk, it detracts \*HEAVILY\* from a very real, very concerning pattern. ","['Quality post and effort OP. This also reminds me of how long race control took before deploying a safety car back at Baku 2021 for either Stroll or Verstappen‚Äôs retirement when their tires randomly blew up. I remember after the race it was found that multiple drivers ignored the double waved yellows in that section by going significantly faster, yet in the end no one got a penalty for it. This has consistently been an issue like you said.\n\nEdit: [This article goes into further detail about how long it took for the Safety Car to be deployed for their crashes, and mentions how Masi wasn‚Äôt satisfied with how some drivers failed to slow sufficiently for double waved yellows](https://www.racefans.net/2021/06/09/eight-safety-questions-raised-by-azerbaijan-grand-prix-crashes-and-f1s-reaction/)', 'I saw that hulkenberg was moving (in neutral presumably) after the start of the double yellows. \n\nWhen did he stop moving? Was it a huge gap between him stopping completely and him getting out of the car?', ""I'm a marshall at Monza and I will try to explain why there's usually a long delay from the incident to the actual decision\n\nFirst of all a marshall has to report the incident to the race director to asses the conditions of the track and the driver, it's not so easy to do from the camera feed but a marshall that is right there at like 10m or less can easily evaluate the situation better.\n\nThen the circuit race director has to translate what is being said (because for us we communicate in Italian but the FIA race director understands English) and the FIA race director has to make a decision\n\nKeep in mind that usually as long as the car it's still limping around and the driver is not out they won't ever give out a VSC or a SC because it's always better to just wave a double yellow and let the driver bring the car to safety\n\nIn cases like Australia I highly doubt that there was even some sort of communication between the track marshall and the race director, they gave the VSC too quickly so I suppose the fia race director decided without hearing the marshalls (and rightfully so, I'm not blaming the decision it was the right thing to do)\n\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of communication between the track marshalls and the race director then again between the two of them. Then the decision is given out which in turn takes another few seconds\n\nIt's never as easy as on TV you might think it is, and also trust me a race director does not want to use a SC or a VSC (while on the FCY they are more favorable because it's a lot better)\n\n\nAlso it's worth noting that if an accident happens like at turn 1 but all the cars are already past that point they will tend to wait for the sc/vsc, because marshalls might be able to remove the car in like 20/30 seconds without having the need to deploy a safety measure. In case the sc/vsc is deployed they will let them race up until almost the end of the lap so they get a bit more action before having the race neutralized"", 'The worst thing is if I‚Äôm remembering correctly even there fastest of 12 seconds was to slow considering the scenario, Russel was upside down in a high speed section with debris up in the air blocking vision of Russel, so within that 12 seconds  a car almost drove directly into the underfloor of russels car, a red flag should of immediately been thrown out in this situation, it‚Äôs just not good enough and unfortunately seems like it is going to take another fatal accident before they tighten up these calls.', 'Agree this is a quality post! What I don‚Äôt get is why the VSC cannot be deployed right away, even for just a few seconds, when something is clearly happening at the track. Almost as a swift replacement for double-waved yellows in most situation. Then full SC can be deployed within 30-60 seconds if deemed crucial. That was the whole point of introducing the VSC: not to have all the issues and instances OP rightfully brought up!', ""I watch a lot of feeder series as well, and the thing I note in both places is that sometimes flags or safety cars or other things aren't called until they imminently need to be called for safety. What I mean is that if the accident happens at turn one, and in two seconds all the cars are past turn one before anything could possibly be called... well, the cars won't be back around to turn one for more than a minute, sometimes much more depending on the track. So, often I think officials let it go for a bit so that we can get some more active racing while they aren't actually near a hazard. In several feeder series, they are much more likely than F1 to not call a safety car of any kind if some yellows or double yellows around one area are sufficient, and then they are active racing around the rest of the lap."", 'Do you also know the average time without the 2 minutes and 2 seconds from yesterday? I would expect that the average would be way down then and even shows more what of an outlier yesterday was.', 'Just a note - WEC/GT3 series (SRO based) have a mandated decision time of 45 seconds to call a VSC/SC or leave it under local yellows.', ""You have to consider, that safety car deployment will take longer / is delayed on purpose, if all cars are are close to each other with no back trackers and the fiele has already patheted the yellow sector.\n\nFor example first lap accidents or accidents after safety car restarts.\n\nThere is no risk in waiting to deploy the SC until sector 3, if the crash happens in sector 1 and that's what is done every time.\n\nFor red flag incidents it is different and they tend to call it faster to avoid a mess regarding restarting positions and to allow cars to cool down before returning to box.""]",361,103,0.94,361,882,882,2,0,0.0,2

1gi5jfq,"So, what's actually in the rules if there is no qualifying session?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gi5jfq/so_whats_actually_in_the_rules_if_there_is_no/,2024-11-02, Discussion,"We've all heard different things from different commentators, so I went and checked the text of the [Sporting Regulations for 2024](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_1_-_2023-09-26.pdf) and, surprisingly, I couldn't find anything that deals directly with a qualifying session being cancelled.

The closest thing I could find is the rule about drivers that are not classified at the end of a qualifying session (39.4.b):

>Drivers will be considered to be ‚Äúunclassified‚Äù in the following circumstances:

>i) If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race Director.

>ii) If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted

>iii) If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint shootout

Unless this is covered by some other rule that I didn't see (if so, apologies for wasting your time), if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:

>The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows:

>\- Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 **(or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)**

If I understand correctly, then it has to be Free Practice 1 classification order and the commentators that mentioned the possibility of Stewards using a different order are incorrect. I wonder if the rest of Rule 39.4.b is the cause of this misunderstanding:

>The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters such as:

>\- A suitable lap time being set in another practice session  
\- The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the Championship  
\- The gravity of the offence which caused the driver‚Äôs disqualification

which is about allowing drivers that did not classify at the end of the qualifying session to start the race and not about their position in the grid if allowed. Usually drivers are allowed to start the race unless there are serious driver / car performance or safety concerns.

Did I miss something?

Final note: the Rule on moving the qualifying session is quite straightforward, basically the Race Director and Stewards can do whatever they want (inside FIA rules) based on Rule 15.3.a:

>The clerk of the course shall work in permanent consultation with the Race Director. The Race Director shall have overriding authority in the following matters and the clerk of the course may give orders in respect of them only with his express agreement:

>a) The control of free practice, qualifying session, sprint shootout, sprint session and the race, adherence to the timetable and, if he deems it necessary, the making of any proposal to the stewards to modify the timetable in accordance with the Code or Sporting Regulations.","['Fuck knows', ""the truth is there is no precedent. race director will make the final call if the qualifying doesn't go through.\n\nalthough i personally feel if the weather is bad enough for there to be no qualifying whatsoever then it is really ambitious to hope for a race to happen as well."", ""Stewards discretion seems to be the most likely option but teams will protest for sure. It's going to be a hot mess.\n\nAlthough it probably won't matter looking at the forecast"", ""Time for Verstappen to pull a Hamilton '21\n\nWe're here for it"", ""Logical answer: sprint quali grid\n\nProbable answer: some FIA moment ruling that hasn't been thought of makes FP1 the race grid session."", ""You did not miss anything i think, there is no rule yet.\n\n>if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:\n\nThat is the question. If quali doesn't happen at all, does that mean that all 20 drivers failed to set a lap time during Q1 in the sense of this regulation? I don't think it has to be seen that way if Q1 never started and the stewards could use a different order.\n\nFor next year the rules in this situation would be WDC order."", '""If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1""\n\nThey didn\'t, the -did- set a time in SQ1.

Senna was described as a danger to himself, and other drivers, and it would only be a matter of time before he caused a serious (potentially fatal) crash. It was said that he meditated deeply prior to the race and that he believed that he was guided by some higher power, which made him untouchable in the race. It was claimed that he remained sitting in his car when the race was interrupted (red flagged) often for long periods, as he did not want anything to break this mental focus.¬† It was said that his ‚Äúcrazy beliefs‚Äù rather than exceptional talent, was the only explanation for the crazy high speeds he was able to able to race at, in very poor conditions with near zero visibility!

Was it the same case with Schumacher as well? Nowadays most people, including me, adore him but that's only because we only ever heard of the legend.

My feeling is the guy needs a humbling. Incredible driver, but he has no regard for anyone else's safety, even after it seemed like he had got past that hitch in his development. All the greats have this to some regard I guess - the competitive edge borders a bit on sad for me though. \n\nAt the end of it, we want to see these guys battle it out on a fair footing and if not, be dished a penalty that's warranted. Max did get 20s on the weekend, which was fair, but I do feel if you are repeat offender, the punishment needs to be harsher.
