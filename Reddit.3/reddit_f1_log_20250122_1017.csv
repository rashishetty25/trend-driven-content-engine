i would like to buy my boyfriend tickets for the upcoming f1 season as a valentines day gift.

which race would you guys suggest will be the most entertaining to watch? he likes ferarri but doesn't exclusively root for one team or player.

At the track, depending on the track, it might be difficult to sit in a place that is likely to have overtakes, and it can still be very entertaining to watch the cars go past.

I'm sure there are situations that can change the number so I'm basically asking, right now, how many teams you feel F1 should grow/shrink to for maximum health of the sport.

In my opinion F1 should look to target 12 active teams if possible.  I think that's a good number to allow 3-4 to struggle at any given time without majorly impacting the competitiveness of the entire grid and ensuring a competitive midpack, which as we saw in 2023 and  2024 can be vital for the longterm viability of the sport with McLaren and Aston Martin emerging from the midpack to challenge for top positions (and then Aston Martin falling back, but it was still fun while it lasted).

Bottom line in my mind 12 teams is the right number to maintain a healthy midpack from which new challengers for the stop spots might emerge.  This is entirely my own opinion but I'm curious what others think.","[""I think the maximum sustainable number is 13 since it's required for a circuit to be able to accommodate that, but a few probably wouldn't be able to support any more.
