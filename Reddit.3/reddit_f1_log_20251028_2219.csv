1ohyali,Gabi on Ollie finishing P4: ‘That was very nice’,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohyali/gabi_on_ollie_finishing_p4_that_was_very_nice/,2025-10-28, Video,,"['What a wholesome guy, always seems happy when others succeed', '‘Not for our championship’ \n\nI like that he had to remind him of that haha. Wholesome moment though.', 'All the rookie this year seems promising', 'Gabi cheered like Ollie just won the whole championship', 'The rookies in general are pretty talented, I can see some future stars of the sport there.', 'His turn next', 'Yeah he’s gonna cost me my bonus, but sure, happy for him.\xa0', ""They are also friends. He cited Max and Bearman as the people he is close with and hangs out outside the track. But his reaction to Hulk's podium and radio was very sweet. Gabi seems like a very nice guy."", ""Eh, Doohan and Colapinto both I'm not impressed by, compared to the others at least. They're not the worst in recent years by any means, just not as good. But perhaps it's being warped by the Alpine being an absolute dogboat.\n\nLawson also has a rough spot, but since he's been in the AlphaTauri he's kept up decently with Hadjar imo. Kimi is up against one of the strongest drivers on the grid in a car that, I think, is quite hard to understand how to optimally drive it (not as bad as the RB, but the Merc is a weird car), and he has shown flashes of real good stuff.\n\nHadjar obviously has the podium and, aside from the Straya formation lap, has impressed me the most. Bearman is getting more comfortable with the Haas and it's showing, I think in recent races he's done better than Ocon. Gabi is perhaps not getting as many points as his teammate, but he's beating Hulk in quali this season, right? Which I think speaks volumes that he's good, even if Hulk is having a (to his standards) poor qualifying season."", ""Franco said Gaby was his closest friend in the grid the other day but maybe the feeling isn't mutual lmao""]",295,13,0.96,295,326,326,5,0,0.0,5
