1kgt8cf,Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess did he doing good anymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kgt8cf/yuki_tsunoda_is_currently_in_a_position_where_no/,2025-05-07, Discussion,"Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess whether he is fast or slow anymore.

Yuki began 2025 with excellent pace. In Australia, he steadily maintained P5 and even overtook Ferrari for P4 after the restart, but VCARB's wrong pit stop decision destroyed everything. In China, Yuki continued to maintain good speed and secured P6 in the sprint race, with abundant opportunities to claim P8 in the main race, but once again, VCARB made an incorrect pit stop decision, and then the front wing of his car exploded...

Clearly, Yuki with VCARB raced well and proved himself as the best of the rest, even holding off some cars from the BIG 4. RB also positively evaluated that performance and promoted him to the main team.

Continuing with Red Bull, after 6 consecutive years of struggling with their second driver, they and everyone else understood that their car is undrivable for anyone except Max. Their approach with Yuki has also changed. RB has agreed to let Yuki use a setup that is ""slower but more stable.""

This also leads to some questions: how much slower is this ""slower but more stable"" setup compared to Max's setup in an ideal lap? Can Yuki with this ""slower but more stable"" setup achieve better speed than Yuki with the fastest possible setup? Yuki himself lacks experience with RB's car, so setup issues may continue throughout the season.

Anyway, Yuki's speed was immediately better than Liam's. Yuki made a mistake in Japan quali Q2, but in subsequent races, he consistently made it to Q3. Interestingly, the race where he was closest to Max's pace (Bahrain) was when RB's car completely lacked pace, and even Max had to compete with Alpine and Haas. I've also noticed that Yuki's Q3 qualifying lap times typically don't improve compared to Q2 - perhaps he's playing it safe and avoiding crashes? Maybe Yuki doesn't know how to improve his speed further when he can't adopt Max's driving style? It's very difficult to assess.","['Yuki has been better than Lawson and miles off the mark from Max. At the end of the day that’s probably what RBR have come to terms with to accept. I reckon he’ll see the season out, because who else could they realistically throw in there at this stage?

Combine that with him not always performing perfectly and you run into the realistic problem that you arent fighting with the top dogs, but are firmly in the midfield. \n\nFrom that perspective i think that he performed adequat.', 'I think Red Bull are content with Tsunoda’s performance for now because they have bigger problems in the shape of the car itself. Marko said they don’t remember when they had both cars finishing in the top 10, so the bar had been well and truly lowered at Red Bull for the moment, and Tsunoda is clearing it at least.\n\nTsunoda’s promotion came with the realisation within Red Bull that the car was the problem. Red Bull know they have to fix that first and then assess him again. They also know there’s very little for them to compete for this year as long as the car stays as it is. The Miami upgrades didn’t work as much as they expected and Marko has said that Imola will be the last chance saloon for them. \n\nIf those upgrades work and they’re able to cut the deficit by a decent chunk, then Tsunoda’s performance will be back under the microscope.

Just to give an example, in qualifying the SF-25 was only 2 tenths better than the problematic SF-23 . Better tyres (softer), better aero after two years of work in the tunnel, good efficiency in terms of top speed and DRS, no sign of porpoising. Yet the car practically never came to life except in Jeddah. A series of performances never in line with expectations while the operation on the tyres remains unknown. The Maranello team had a bad weekend where only the sprint, thanks to the weather that mixed the cards, once again rewarded Hamilton after a desperation move. Leclerc did not even start due to the accident with the intermediates, a questionable move in terms of evaluating the conditions.\n\n\nMcLaren was untouchable, even Verstappen had to destroy his first stint to resist in vain . The Miami heat made the MCL39 more unbeatable than ever. The spectre of a summer domination that would wipe out the competition\'s motivation looms. Everything depends on the drivers\' ability to avoid making mistakes.\n\n\nFerrari\'s potential unusable, the simulator says it exists but the track doesn\'t, here\'s why Vasseur talks about it\n\n\nIt\'s not purely aerodynamic, the car is simply running with mechanical settings that are inefficient for the race, this is compromising the qualifying. For some reason the engineers can\'t get the rear suspension to work as it should. It could be a problem with the anchors or the travel. From what we understand there is a new suspension in the works that could be combined with the latest big package but the timing is unknown.\n\n\nIt is a very delicate and totally unexpected change during the season , not rapid, if nothing else it clearly indicates where the problem is and that it is not strictly aerodynamic in nature. The hope is that the corrections work as they did a year ago , after the technical direction was suddenly vacant due to the departure of Cardile (who will take up a position at Aston Martin next July). At that time Vasseur took the interim but was certainly caught off guard as we entered a delicate phase. This could be a delayed backlash, perhaps the cause of some assessments deemed insufficient on the courageous changes of the 677 project.\n\n\nHowever, Ferrari cannot endure a long season that risks seeing it at times even in fifth place.\n\nCurrently in Maranello there are already two teams, one dedicated 100% to the 678 project in the works . A phase where normally dozens of different designs are tested, some extreme, to establish where the areas of greatest profit are. DT Loic Serra was in Jeddah where things worked less badly, at least for Leclerc, he was not in Miami . On his shoulders the responsibility of a triple and burdensome commitment: thinking of a good car for next year, curing the SF-25\'s illness, implementing (a lot) the quality of the technical choices on the track.\n\n\nEveryone asks the same question and it\'s legitimate: couldn\'t the Ferrari SF-24 have been further refined instead of changing it ""99%""?\n\n\nChanging the aerodynamic balance to focus more on the front end required a completely different overall geometry. Tweaking the gearbox and reducing the overall dimensions of the rear suspension did not pay off . The trap was just around the corner but could not have been foreseen in the simulations that only gave gains without any drawbacks. For better or for worse, the Venturi cars will remain among the most unpredictable and unreadable in the history of F1.\n\n\nAfter the stormy (in every sense) American weekend, it is worth underlining the words of the seven-time world champion reported by the BBC which now perhaps seem clearer: ""I think this car has really good performance. Something is holding us back at the moment, it\'s there, we just can\'t use it . Until we have a solution for that, this is where we are"" signed Lewis Hamilton.', ""The only good takeaway from this is that Serra had nothing to do with the design of the SF25, so that gives me hope he may yet come good on the 2026. car. As for the SF25 it might end up scrapped as it's simply not worth it to invest too much time trying to catch a soon to be 200 point deficit when you have a regulations shift next season. They should have done this switch for last  year and then this year the car would be right up there to try and steal a title before the reg switches.\n\nEither way, it's easy to talk shit now, gonna be a long one boys, strap in and hope for some miracles :D"", 'Yeah thank god they changed it from last year.', 'https://preview.redd.it/xxxzywsvzbze1.jpeg?width=702&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d9866ea85ee53e9a14cc654d6aaac6bd584888e', 'I will keep praying for upgrades that make Ferrari two seconds faster than everyone else 🙏', 'Every time I read an article like this, I mostly feel bad for Leclerc.

They've all dominated in feeder series like F2/F3 or even Formula E, but stepping into an F1 car is a whole different beast. Everything is on another level. They're suddenly racing against seasoned pros who've been honing their craft for years.

And the problem is, these rookies often aren't given much breathing room to actually learn and develop. If they don't deliver stellar results almost immediately, the knives start coming out. Teams are under immense pressure to perform, and unfortunately, young drivers can be seen as the easiest variable to change if things aren't going to plan.

It's a pretty cutthroat environment. One bad race, or even a couple of slightly off performances, and suddenly their seat is under threat. Where's the time for them to really understand the nuances of the car, figure out their driving style in this new machinery, and build confidence? It feels like they're constantly under the microscope, judged on every single lap.

You see flashes of brilliance, for sure. A stunning qualifying lap here, a gutsy overtake there. But consistency, the hallmark of a top F1 driver, takes time and experience. Maybe we need to rethink how we integrate these young talents, give them a longer leash, and acknowledge that becoming an F1 star isn't an overnight thing. It's a tough gig, and expecting instant perfection might just be setting them up for failure.","['Except not all rookies straight up dominate f3 or f2\n\nIf you are talking about Doohan, he didnt win neither f3 or f2, despite having multiple shots.\n\nAnd if he is unlucky, then what can Pourchaire, Drugo say?

But no one is saying that their team should go out and sign Doohan now. Because everyone knows that he isn't that good.

Norris still in the fight bringing home 10 points in P5 but the gap with Albon is increasing and now he also has to deal with Sainz.

Further back Hulkenberg picks up his best result of the season with a third place, propelling him up the order from P18 to just outside the top 10 and settles in at P11.

Yuki still on the bottom end every weekend, seems like he is still very cautious in the pitlane, him and Alonso still failing to score a top 10 finish this season.
