1ityyp4,Drive to Survive made me a fan... BUT,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ityyp4/drive_to_survive_made_me_a_fan_but/,2025-02-20, Discussion,"I (31M) as a kid was too young to understand F1, but I always watched the Hungarian Grand Prix (because I'm from Hungary) when Schumacher was still active. However, in 2021, I got back into the world of F1 through the Drive to Survive documentary, which my girlfriend (now wife) introduced me to. The 2024 season was the first one we watched live together, and it was an incredible experience. I got hooked on F1!

So much so that I started watching retro races from the 2000s, where Michael Schumacher won his first championship with Ferrari. Now I'm at the 2001 season, where he started breaking old records one by one (he secured his 49th victory at Nürburgring, which is where I’m at). Even though I know he will go on to win four more consecutive titles, it's still a joy to watch the battles between him and Mika Häkkinen, Kimi Räikkönen scoring his first career points, and Rubens Barrichello taking his first-ever win at Hockenheim. It's never too late to be a new fan of this sport.

All this is just to say that while the overly dramatized Netflix-style storytelling and fan culture may not be for everyone (the F1 75 was sometimes painfully to watch) without Drive to Survive, I wouldn't have gotten so deeply into the world of Formula 1.
I love this sport and I just wanted to share it with all of you. 😊","[""I was a fan long before DTS (from 2001), and while I've only seen a season or two of DTS, and while it's not for me, I appriaciate that it brought a lot of new people into the sport. I think it's a decent first step, and if you actually like the sport, you'll realize that it's just drama for netflix and the actual sport is more interesting. So I don't mind it as much"", 'Hey DTS got my wife to go from groaning whenever I turned on F1 to actively following the sport and watching races with me, so it will forever have my appreciation for that.\xa0', ""I don't believe in gate keeping so whatever brings more fans into the sport I am all for. Sports don't grow with niche fandoms\n\nThat being said, I can't stress enough how much I loathed DTS. I had to struggle through the first season but I've never had as much as an iota of interest to check it out again."", ""Watching since 1997 and I still watch DTS just because I'm permanently starved for F1 content."", ""I know it's been talked about to death.\n\nBut I do LIKE the idea of DTS. If they just didn't make up storylines and build the show in the editing room it would be fantastic. Have 24 episodes a season 30 minutes long. Do the driver interviews, a brief explanation of what's going on at each race weekend and fill it with the drivers just..doing stuff or behind the seasons interactions. \n\nBoom, great show."", ""I do appreciate that DTS opened the door for so many to become a fan of the sport, but I don't appreciate how artificial it can feel once you do start exploring all the nuances and getting yourself up to speed. \n\nI understand it's for entertainment, and it does a reasonably good job of it, but I feel like if your F1 documentary largely depends on its viewers being uninformed or turning their brains off, it doesn't succeed at being a documentary."", ""So it done it's job. Nothing wrong with coming via DTS. I picked up F1 because McLaren had a livery like a TGV and I was into fast machines as a child. As long as you enjoy it that's all that matters."", ""Had a similar experience to OP and a few other folks here. DTS was my first experience, then I got into following races regularly with Miami in 2023. I had enough context from DTS to know and care about the drivers at that point, and it was a fantastic leaping off spot to be able to then look for ways to bring myself up to speed and be able to follow the logic of a race weekend more easily. Now, I'm ravenous. Especially as I didn't grow up watching F1 or with family who particularly care about cars or motorsport, there's no way I would have found the sport or interest I have for it without DTS.\n\nThat said, last season's DTS was the first that I've watched after actually following race by race, and oof. It is tough to watch as an existing fan. The intended audience is absolutely people who are brand new to F1. \n\nI get why a lot of folks may get caught watching *just* DTS and not being able to follow more closely (time differences, access to streams, etc. are all valid barriers), and that does create the odd group of folks who only know the DTS drama and don't realize the difference with the real thing. However it's pretty impressive how digestible DTS has made an engineering and tech-heavy sport like F1 for the general population."", 'Loads of people got into f1 through dts and then make fun of people who got into it after them', ""I have a hard time with this.

It gave some nice insights, but it got me thinking about another interesting angle: what if we could compare drivers' peak periods rather than their entire careers?     
  
So I built a new feature that lets you analyze drivers based on their best consecutive periods. Here's what it does:    

* Compare any F1 drivers during their strongest stretch (you choose the stint) 
* See how legends stack up when comparing their prime years 
* Discover hidden gems - sometimes shorter peak periods reveal surprising performance levels 
* Eliminates the ""career length bias"" from the equation

You can try it out here: [https://www.formula1points.com/performance/stints](https://www.formula1points.com/performance/stints) I think it offers an interesting new perspective on the age-old ""who was better"" debate.

The following cars fascinate me…\n\n1990 Lola/Larrousse - This car led the midfield at a good number of races from the French GP, though you could debate this depending on your definition of ‘midfield’. Either way, it was very competitive while being driven by Aguri Suzuki and Eric Bernard, who appeared evenly matched. Suzuki went on to make the ghost of Michele Alboreto look very good in 1992, which makes me wonder what a proven quality driver could have achieved in the 1990 Lola.\n\n1991 Jordan - This is obviously a widely celebrated car, but something that caught my eye when watching the 1990 season is how much Andrea de Cesaris struggled compared to Emmanuele Pirro. Was de Cesaris revitalised by this car, or was the car’s potential unfulfilled by a mediocre driver line-up?\n\n1995 Simtek - Jos Verstappen had this car running genuinely in the midfield for a good chunk of the time it was on circuit. It was incredible that this team produced this car while their existence was in such a precarious state. This was a world away from the car that was battling to make the grid the year prior.\n\n1997 Jordan - Like the 91 Jordan, this car is often highly praised, but I suspect even those who praise it might not realise how good it truly was. Ralf Schumacher and Giancarlo Fisichella were both defacto rookies, and even at their best were good but hardly world beaters. Their three podiums (and a fourth that got away at Hockenheim) look nice, and they were clearly best at power-dependent circuits, but they qualified this car in the top five at circuits like Imola, Monaco, Magny-Cours, Silverstone and the Nurburgring, so this car could clearly deliver results anywhere and the drivers were simply inconsistent.\n\n1997 Sauber - You only need to take a look at Johnny Herbert in the 1995 Benetton to see the 97 Sauber was a remarkably quick car, though the customer Ferrari engine clearly lacked power. Herbert had a podium at the Hungaroring and five other points finishes, four of those well inside the points. He was in the hunt for a podium when he broke down at Silverstone, was taken out after a great qualifying and a fantastic start in Melbourne, ran well in the points at Imola before breaking down and at Monaco before crashing in the rain. Herbert had arguably his best year, but given Schumacher had absolutely walloped him two years prior and that Frentzen had beaten him very convincingly in 96, you have to believe this would’ve looked a great car in their hands.\n\n2000 Arrows - This car was an absolute straight line rocketship. In Austria, Pedro de la Rosa legitimately ran ahead of Rubens Barrichello’s Ferrari and had made it to the one-stop pit window before breaking down. Granted, the Ferrari may have been a few laps heavier on fuel, but that was still outstanding for this team at this time. De la Rosa then ran towards the front all race before rain fell at Hockenheim, while Jos Verstappen was within a few seconds of beating Ralf to a podium at an admittedly attrition-heavy race at Monza. De la Rosa’s performance at the Nurburgring and Verstappen’s in Canada would indicate this was also a good car in the wet.\n\n2000 Minardi - This was no ordinary backmarker Minardi. This car was over 0.4% closer to pole position than the 1999 car and 0.8% closer than the 2001 car. Like the Arrows, it quite clearly excelled on low downforce circuits. Marc Gene had it on the fringes of points contention prior to late pit stops in Austria and was easily holding onto the midfield at Hockenheim. There were few other race day highlights, but this car makes you wonder what Alonso could’ve done with an extra 0.8% of pace the following year.', 'With the statement from Ben Sulayem to consider a return of the V10 engines, what percentage chance do you think this could actually happen? \n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I don’t know what to think about it. I believe there will always be a hybrid component remaining. But I can already imagine it with one or two electric motors (both front and rear) combined with a V10 (around 2.2 liters or so), using as many standard parts as possible, so that manufacturers can focus more on the development of the electric motors.', ""What do you guys think, was 2001 Michael's best year in terms of pure qualifying speed?\xa0\n\n\n11 pole positions\xa0\n\n\n16-1 qualifying h2h against Rubens (was only outqualified in Monza, but Michael didn't even want to race that weekend)\n\n\nIncredible laps in Suzuka, Hungary, Silverstone, Canada, Australia"", 'Which grand prix on the calendar has the most unexpected podiums?', '5 days left until testing', ""Personally, I think it's a bit of a PR manoeuvre to try to start getting some of the public back on side ahead of the elections later in the year.\n\nFundamentally, the current PU regulations are determined by manufacturer interest, and there is no interest from them currently for a V10, sustainable fuel or not. Unless that changes, I find it hard to believe."", ""> With the statement from Ben Sulayem to consider a return of the V10 engines, what percentage chance do you think this could actually happen?   \n  \nIf he stands by it and it's aligned with Dominicali of Formula One Group, it's a proposal they can present to the manufacturers to decide if they're interested.  \n  \n> But I can already imagine it with one or two electric motors (both front and rear) combined with a V10 (around 2.2 liters or so), using as many standard parts as possible,\n\nI mean majority of noise experience comes from the engine and this exactly is what the PU manufacturers specialize in - getting combustion efficiency up to produce power is their specialty and this exactly is the what creates a performance difference between manufacturers.  \nIf you say everyone will use standard parts (say cosworth), the manufacturers are more likely to leave the sport.\nWeight is another factor as combustion fuels, even with 70% efficiency loss still contain a factor of hundred more energy per kilogram compared to batteries, with potential energy ~12kw/kg, 70% efficiency ~3.6kw/kg - versus average of 0.4kw/kg for batteries (and say 10% loss due to transfer).  \nAnd that's the main challenge, compared to a electric engine (which is already 85-90% efficient with majority of loss coming from conversion and transfer from battery to the engine), how do you increase efficiency and get back to the 55-60% systems efficiency claimed by Mercedes with MGU-K and MGU-H.  \n\n>  so that manufacturers can focus more on the development of the electric motors.  \n  \nEveryone would be using the same Bosch or Marelli electric engines, as if you prescribe weight and voltage for electric power unit limitations there is little to gain in development bar packaging it efficiently for chassis aerodynamic improvements which would yield noticeably higher gains.  \n  \nFor relevant gains you'd need to go with exotic and potentially toxic materials that F1 already went through before 2000s, which is why PU materials are heavily regulated.  \nI.e. https://www.racefans.net/2007/02/08/banned-beryllium/"", 'It’s certainly a candidate along with 2000 and 1996 I would say. It’s probably fair to say the McLaren was the quicker car up to Monaco, where Coulthard was right with Schumacher in the championship. Afterwards, the Williams was the quicker car everywhere except Hungary as they won three races, lost great opportunities to win at Spa and Indy, while Ralf was right with Michael at the Nurburgring before his penalty.\n\n2000 the McLaren was the quicker car and Schumacher got nine poles, with part of the reason for him not getting more probably being explained by Hakkinen and Coulthard operating at a higher base level throughout the year than Ralf, Montoya and Hakkinen himself in 2001, in addition to McLaren arguably failing away slightly as the 2001 season progressed, particularly on power circuits.\n\n1996 Schumacher took four pole positions and was within striking distance of pole on several other occasions despite being in a far inferior car to the one he drove in 1995, when he also had four poles. He was 1% faster than Irvine on average, and while a good chunk of that was down to Irvine struggling to adapt to the car (a good chunk of Irvine’s Ferrari career is just not consistent with his usual base level) it undoubtedly took a great performance from Schumacher to make that gap as big as it was.', 'Unexpected podiums are really driven by circumstance more than anything else, though obviously the circuit can contribute. \n\nThe Hungaroring and Montreal for example tend to produce a much higher rate of first-time winners than any other circuits, with Hill, Alonso, Button, Kovalainen, Ocon and Piastri getting their first wins at the former and Boutsen, Alesi, Hamilton, Kubica and Ricciardo getting their first at the latter. That’s over a quarter of first time winners since 1989 from those two circuits alone, yet nobody would say the Hungaroring helps create great racing.\n\nI would probably say Monza is up there as a circuit that has the most potential to create a surprise result simply because it’s so different in nature compared to other circuits and can shake up the competitive order. I would say Monaco is like this too, but we’ve seen many more unexpected results at Monza than Monaco recently.', ""The public don't vote for him and if no one stands to oppose him, he is re-elected regardless.      \n\nHe doesn't need to do anything for the general public and I don't think the FIA members would want him to do that anyway.""]",3,14,0.64,3,14,14,1,10,0.040000000000000036,1
1itwzxz,All the race suits scrutinized,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1itwzxz/all_the_race_suits_scrutinized/,2025-02-20, Discussion,"What the title says. Purely subjective of course, but I found last years McLaren diagonal split orange/black design to be incredibly unflattering to even these highly trained athletes, so seeing them stick with it made me scrutinize all suits.

Race suits ranked:

Kick Sauber 5/10
Incredibly simple, their graphic designer is paid by the hour and this is what they could deliver.

Haas 6/10
This is a good suit, harkening back to the Haas maverick glory days, but also doesn't take much risks, hence a conservative rating.

Williams 6/10
An average suit and they get the extra point for incorporating the yellow name tag. It's a fine looking suit, but also doesn't provide any iconic feature. 

VCARB 6/10
By all means an ugly suit imo, but I appreciate how they incorporate the cashapp green. It's different and sort of recogniseable, which I appreciate but let's not get too excited, it's still in essence as exciting as a 2007 puma teamwear football jersey. 

Alpine 7/10
For whaf they're working with this is their cleanest suit of the BWT years imo. They do themselves no favour by not just simply going all pink. Matching the black/blue alpine vibe with BWT's pink will forever be a middling at best look. In light of that 7/10 is as high as they could go. 

Aston Martin 7/10
They made only small changes but it's a clean suit with some detail.

Mercedes 5/10
Now this is harsh, but I had to punish the stripes on the legs that look like they're wearing boots, in a bad way. The adidas stripes make sense but ended up too thick and look clumsy. Remember that I'm a self-declared expert. 

Red Bull 7/10
Never change a winning team (too much at least). I appreciate how they make small changes every other year to give some indication of what year we're in once we look back at Max' dominance in a few decades. It's not their best, tho. 

Ferrari 5/10
In the grand scheme of Ferrari suits it's ok. Better than 2022 & 2023 but worse than 2024. I thought they'd go a bit iconic/classier for Hamilton's arrival, but they just regurgitated last year's with a somewhat oddly weighted white stripe on the leg to balance the white on the car I presume. Feels rushed. 

McLaren 4/10
I can understand why they hold on to a WCC winning car livery, but the race suits? C'mon give the poor boys a break. In their defense, their race suits have been bad since they dropped the blue ones in 2022. The diagonal feature irks me so much. Why?? It's not even curved so we could say - oh! it's the mcl logo sort of?! No it just seems like a stupid design idea that will not age well and now we have it for another year. 

Making a nice race suit with orange and black/gray colors should not be too hard. ","['You missed Alpine and Ferrari.', 'I guess Ferrari and Alpine do not provide race suits for their drivers?
