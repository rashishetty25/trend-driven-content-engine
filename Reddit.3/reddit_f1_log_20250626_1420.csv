Two experienced drivers are on the wish list. Nationality is not important for now. An American driver is no longer a requirement. General Motors has decided that performance is the priority. Only then will the goal of being a truly American team come into play.”\xa0\n\nPerez/Bottas all but confirmed them. I think that is the right decision. The last thing a new team needs is rookies crashing and especially in the era of the cost cap. And the main thing they need is experience on how to set up a car and getting two drivers who are not just experienced but have won every constructors championship from 2017-2023 between them is great for Cadillac.', 'Are they building their car for combat?', 'Audi and Cadillac occupying 19-22 grid spots at Melbourne 2026', 'Translation and full article: \n\n> **The clock is ticking for Cadillac. The new Formula 1 racing team is mobilizing on all fronts. The US team is growing. The engineers are developing the 2026 car, and the race crew is preparing for front-line action in the tactics room. We\'ll keep you updated on the latest developments.**\n\n> Cadillac has to face one question again and again: Why so early? Why is the American automaker launching its car in 2026 and not a year later? Why is General Motors launching its own engine in 2029 when it could wait until 2031, when the regulations might stipulate less complex drive systems?\n\n> The answer to the question is simple. Formula 1 wanted it that way. It\'s clearly a bit of a dig at the Americans, after the approval process cost so much energy. It\'s based on the motto: If they really want to be there, they should do it as soon as possible with the start of the new Concorde agreement.\n\n> Time pressure is the biggest problem for the newcomer. Cadillac only received the final approval from the FIA \u200b\u200bon March 7. Now, in almost exactly twelve months, a team must be built, the necessary infrastructure created, the processes synchronized, and a car developed and produced. That\'s an extremely tight deadline.\n\n> **First car is built in England.**\nAs of May, the Silverstone branch had 300 employees on the payroll. By the end of the year, that number is expected to rise to 500 to 600. It doesn\'t help that Audi is seeking the same specialists from the same catchment area for its Bicester branch. It\'s also a problem that poachers from other teams have work bans and won\'t be available until the fall.\n\n> General Motors currently employs around 100 people at its engine factory in Charlotte. This number will also have to expand rapidly, as three years of development time for such a complex powertrain passes in the blink of an eye. Russ O\'Blenes\' team can\'t build on past experience. Therefore, Cadillac engineers stepped on the gas with the prototype of the V6 turbo. The first example was already tested on the test bench the week after the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\n\n> The Cadillac F1 Team\'s new headquarters in Fishers near Indianapolis is scheduled to be operational by the second quarter of 2026 at the latest. To align the tight schedule with the factory\'s completion, the following master plan was established: The 2026 car will be built entirely in England, the 2027 car half in England and half in the USA, and from 2028 onwards, production will take place entirely at the headquarters in Fishers.\n\n> **Weight as a joker for Cadillac?**\nFor Cadillac, the 2026 Formula 1 season has already begun. All stress and crash tests have already been conducted on a test monocoque. The findings will then be incorporated into the carbon fiber tube that will form the basis of the 2026 car. Technical advisor Pat Symonds reveals that they plan to have most components ready two months earlier than usual to avoid taking any risks. Participation in the first test in January 2026 is mandatory for the newcomer. Every kilometer of experience counts.\n\n> The easiest way to gain ground against the established teams would be weight. Lowering the minimum weight to 770 kilograms opens up a third area, alongside aerodynamics and engine power, where you can differentiate yourself from your opponents. Hardly anyone will make the weight limit in the first year. Every kilogram less guarantees a better lap time.\n\n> The Ferrari engine is a constant. Compared to aerodynamics, weight seems like a more manageable area. But Symonds warns against underestimating it. ""As a newcomer, we have no reference point when it comes to weight. The established teams know how far they can go with every component because they\'ve done it hundreds of times before.""\n\n> **Problem with short-term rule changes.**\nAs with all other teams, the aerodynamic development is expected to be a precision landing. They\'re taking enough time to ensure the components are just ready for the first test and the season opener on March 8. Last-minute rule changes hit a new team harder than the well-established technical teams.\n\n> For example, this spring, the FIA \u200b\u200breduced the size of a fin in the lower section of the rear brake vents. A small change with a big impact. The fin helped seal the underbody between the rear wheel and the floorboard. To compensate, the ground clearance must be lowered again.\n\n> This means new wind tunnel test runs and new computational models for CFD simulation. Small teams with limited simulation tools are more severely affected by such short-term changes in direction than teams with 400 engineers and a fully equipped infrastructure. The lack of experience continues in other areas. The greatest need for improvement lies in aerodynamic elasticity – the keyword being flexi-wings – and the issue of how to control tire temperature via brake ventilation.\n\n> **Cadillac drives along in the factory.**\nIn parallel with the car\'s construction, Cadillac is working on its processes. Since the Spanish Grand Prix, a team of strategists has been based at the Silverstone factory, virtually driving through each race as if they were actually there. This is designed to refine the strategy programs and prepare the people at the control center for their tasks.\n\n> This fall, Cadillac plans to borrow a 2023 car from Ferrari and simulate races as part of TPC testing. This will allow the racing team to prepare for the future task and the mechanics to practice tire changes in real-life conditions.\n\n> The driver question is expected to be resolved this summer. Two experienced drivers are on the wish list. Nationality is not important for now. An American driver is no longer a requirement. General Motors has decided that performance is the priority. Only then will the goal of being a truly American team come into play.', ""Does anyone know what kind of relationship they'll have with Ferrari for those first few years?

You get a little bit of rookie fp1 time but even for your main drivers F1 current car testing is hyper restricted. Very small amounts of time.\n\nYou can't just take your latest Haas, ship it to a test track in Japan and run 1000 miles.\n\nYou can however take previous cars and do that. \n\nThis lets your really compare a driver to known good drivers who drove that car when it was current gen. It also lets people who have talent but not experience in F1 get used to how to drive an F1 car so when they get to your latest car they are up to speed quickly.\n\nThis is something a lot of the rookies that have come into F1 and done well from the off have had. Hamilton notably had a lot of testing time (might have been current gen back then as well as rules were looser) but Kimi had a lot of miles on previous F1 cars before he ever touched the wheel of a modern Merc.\n\nAlso the engineers can probably draw links between the current car parts and previous and may be able to learn things that are relevant to the current or next gen car."", ""Well they get data which they always love to have, and get to scope out talent. Possibly they get money to let people drive the cars as well, but I don't know for sure."", ""Toyota's clearly using it to reward their drivers. The example here being that Tsuboi won Super Formula last year, so he's getting an F1 test. Also, even at his age, they are very interested in seeing him in an F1 car. Even for someone who doesn't look like a likely F1 prospect, they're always interested in seeing the data. Toyota would love to find an F1 likely prospect within their fold. I'm sure they hoped they had one with Miyata, but he hasn't adapted to F2, which, even though they are very, very different cars, is a large strike against him.\n\nHaas benefitted more directly when Ocon and Bearman also got to drive the car, which has happened. With Ocon changing teams, even driving a 2023 Haas is helpful, especially since it's still in the same regulations. And a little off season test always helps keep the neck strength up too. Driving an F1 car is really the best neck exercise, better than they can do in the gym. And, with Ollie being a rookie, practice time was even more valuable."", ""They absolutely started having a TPC program after Toyota's investment in them.

Lots of teams have old cars sitting around, and that doesn't mean they do anything with them. We believe by all reports that Haas weren't spending the full budget before, and I presume they are now, so things like TPC didn't fit into Haas's budget before, and now it does."", 'Okay I stand corrected.']",135,8,0.97,135,7,7,7,1,0.010000000000000009,7

That alone will see someone take a punt on him, whether it's McLaren themselves or another team happy to make space for him with some cash from McLaren as a sweetener. He's a wrecking ball on wheels currently and I'd argue he could do with a second year in F2 to iron out those kinks but he's so quick he might make that impossible by winning the whole thing this year despite his recklessness. Anyone from Ireland should be very excited, he could potentially be the real deal if he does the work, stays disciplined and improves his racecraft."", ""McLaren doesn't have space at the moment, but they let Bortoleto go, or they wrote a contract that let Bortoleto escape, one of those. Dunne would be a good choice for another team looking for a rookie."", 'Will be interesting to see how he does. He’s got amazing raw talent. It seems like there won’t be an opening in 2026. I hope he gets a seat.', '>McLaren junior eyes F1\n\n... Where would he go?', 'No space at McLaren until 2028', 'If he does win F2, then perhaps a year in Formula E with whoever Neom McLaren turn into will keep him race craft ready for an opening into Formula 1.', 'Can we please stop posting PlanetF1 links?', ""I hope i McLaren doesn't lose him to any other team like how Alpine lost Piastri to McLaren\n\nHe is slightly rough but rapid"", 'I would bet that Dunne crashes the car. He is fast, but also a wreckless driver and causes a lot of touches/crashes in F2. \n\nFurthermore I wouldnt say that there is no space at McLaren. Look what they did with Theo Pouchaire. They promised and he had a contract but then they switched and in the end he had no cockpit at all. So if Lando has a low and Zac Brown is happy with Dunne, I would also bet that Zac would do the change immediately.']",90,40,0.82,90,264,264,3,0,0.0,3
