Charles is depressed. George’s dash is broken. Drink system is broken. DRS is broken.', ""Quick recap on the DRS/timing issues for those who don't know what was going on:\n\nAbout two-thirds of the way through the race, the transponder on George Russell's car stopped working. This meant that he tumbled down the live timing tower, making it seem like he had issues. He didn't, the car was still going perfectly fine, so all the broadcasters removed the timing tower from the broadcast to avoid making people think he had retired.\n\nFortunately, F1 has a backup optical timing system on the start-finish straight to make sure that they can get correct race results even if a transponder fails. After a bit of work from the various broadcasters' technical teams, they were able to replace the timing tower using the results from this end-of-lap timing. Of course, that only updates once per lap, so it would have been pretty heavily delayed at certain points.\n\nNow for DRS: as you probably know, DRS can only be activated if you're within 1 second of the car ahead. George Russell didn't know if he was within 1 second of the car ahead, because he doesn't have timing. But also the car *behind him* doesn't know if they're within 1 second, because the car ahead doesn't have timing. So both RUS and whoever was behind him didn't have automatic DRS, and had to override it in order to be able to use it. This is why RUS was able to accidentally activate his DRS.\n\nNone of this was an issue with the broadcasts themselves, and honestly the broadcast teams did really well to compensate for it given that the data they ordinarily use for timings simply was not accurate."", 'Hey look the 2nd Red Bull scored points', 'Great race from Haas.

Meanwhile, Piastri commits earlier and cleaner, maintaining momentum through the high-speed section.

In Turns 4 and 14, it’s actually Piastri who lifts earlier than Norris. Feels like Piastri’s just piecing together a smarter lap overall — giving up a little entry to gain more on the exit.

1jy2ugp,McLaren's High Downforce Setup vs. Cooler Late-Race Temperatures and Safety Cars in Bahrain,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jy2ugp/mclarens_high_downforce_setup_vs_cooler_laterace/,2025-04-13, Discussion,"While it's likely Piastri and Norris will have a pace advantage at the start, this delta will be smaller as track temperatures decrease towards the end of the race, and with their high downforce setup (shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jxn93v/fdataanalysis_no_driver_had_a_lower_top_speed/)) a late safety car might put them under pressure. 

I had a look at the history of safety cars in Bahrain. I didn't investigate why the data is so skewed, but we hardly saw the safety car for over a decade, and have seen it almost every year since 2017, including three times in each of the COVID double-headers here. 

Going by the most recent data, we will most likely see one, either late or early. If degradation is high enough for 2 stops, and there's a late safety car neutralising the field on equal tyres, the McLarens might be in trouble. 

Of course historical data is not predictive, but is this a risk, and is it one they needed to take?
