1l5ukmz,"The latest letter of support for FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem's leadership. Signed by FIA Member clubs from across Africa, including one member leader who was suspended by court order 6 months ago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l5ukmz/the_latest_letter_of_support_for_fia_president/,2025-06-07, Social Media,"The list of signatures is \[from MBS' instagram.\](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKnA0puoXK7/?img\_index=1) The full letter itself is from the \[FIA¬†Vice President for Sport in Africa, Rodrigo Rocha's Linkedin\](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7333873816831528962/) as this was not included in MBS' instagram post

The suspended member is Maina Muturi who was elected president of the Kenya Motor Sports Federation back in 2023. However in late December last year, a Nairobi court issued temporary orders to suspended Mr Muturi pending the hearing and determination of a case filed by a KMSF director (And former chairman) James Kahumbura who is now acting head.

As far as I'm aware, he is still suspended although he has tried to act as leader since then, signing agreements on behalf of the KMSF that have had to be nullified by the High Court as they were made in defiance of the court order.

The latest news in regards to this I can find state:

\> *""The court has given Muturi seven days to show cause why he should not be committed to civil jail for disobeying court orders. He has also been ordered to appear in court on March 25 to respond to the contempt charges.""*

So possibly he has signed this from civil jail or more likely, the FIA needs to update their contacts list.","['Straight out of the FIFA playbook', ""It's Dirty politics, I'm guessing he's gonna get re-elected soon."", 'Aside from a letter and a list of names, it would also be interesting to see how much money each name was given by MBS.', ""This is why people need to realise he's likely going to get reelected again."", 'People need to realise that whatever he does in motorsport is basically irrelevant to these people', ""This sport is going down a dark path\n\nThe more this person is in that role, the worse it'll get"", 'This isn‚Äôt suspicious at all', 'Lmfao, only could bribe the African FIA members to vouch for him', 'This is extremely FIFA.
