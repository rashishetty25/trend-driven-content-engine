1k2wavj,[AMuS] Ferrari seeks consistency,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k2wavj/amus_ferrari_seeks_consistency/,2025-04-19, News,,"['‚ÄùFerrari seeks consistency‚Äù. \n\nSo have we the last 20 years.', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **After four races, Ferrari is still waiting for its first podium finish. The new car is as good as a Mercedes or Red Bull under the best of circumstances. However, it lacks consistency.**\n\n> You have to look very closely for Ferrari\'s good moments this season. Lewis Hamilton\'s sprint victory in Shanghai. Charles Leclerc\'s second place on the grid in Bahrain. The two Ferrari drivers\' solid middle stints at the same race. ""A good stint or a highlight isn\'t enough to win. We need more consistency,"" demands team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur.\n\n> The bottom line is that the disappointments outweigh the disappointments. The poor performance of the red cars in the rain in Melbourne. The disqualification of both cars in Shanghai. The 16-second gap to the winning trio at the Japanese GP, in a race in which everyone was able to drive 53 laps at the limit because their tires barely wore down. The two to four-tenths gap to McLaren. Vasseur sees the Papaya racers as one step ahead of everyone else.\n\n> Although Ferrari had the best car in the second half of the 2024 season, the engineers changed the concept over the winter. The old SF-24 with its pushrod front axle was reaching its limits. The aerodynamicists saw no room to squeeze more out of the underbody.\n\n> **Old car was at its limit.**\nA pullrod front axle, on the other hand, allows the airflow towards the rear to be configured in such a way that, ultimately, more downforce can be produced. But that\'s precisely where Ferrari is currently struggling. ""We don\'t have a further development of last year\'s model, but rather a new car. It will take time until we find the right car balance for all conditions,"" the team principal apologizes.\n\n> Leclerc is on the right track. Last year\'s third-place finisher in the World Championship knows the team inside and out, and he has a reference point in mind with the old car. After Suzuka, Leclerc said with relief: ""I think I\'ve now found a way to get more out of the car with the setup."" The eight-time GP winner also made it clear: ""To beat McLaren, we need more upgrades.""\n\n> Lewis Hamilton isn\'t quite there yet. The team\'s newcomer is still experimenting too much. ""Charles is largely staying true to his setup over the weekend. I\'m still tweaking the car a lot to get a better feel for it. At the same time, I\'m trying to adapt my driving style.""\n\n> **New subfloor opens window.**\nFerrari already introduced a new underbody in Bahrain. It wasn\'t a response to the problems of the early races, but it did address a weak point of the SF-25 that the engineers had apparently already been aware of. Compared to its predecessor, the working window has been significantly narrowed. Ideally, Ferrari would have to run extremely low everywhere, but that\'s not possible because it would otherwise cause excessive wear on the underbody.\n\n> The new underbody is intended to open up this window somewhat and deliver the same downforce across a wider setup range. Bahrain was a small first step forward, according to Vasseur. But more such steps must follow. ""We have the ingredients for a good car, we just need to put them together correctly at the right time. I have the feeling that Mercedes and Red Bull, and usually one of the two McLarens, aren\'t doing any better.""\n\n> Vasseur is annoyed that defeats are often portrayed as major dramas. ""We\'re talking about a tenth of a second here, one way or the other. That made five starting positions in Bahrain. One tiny mistake is enough, and you either look good or bad. Red Bull wins in Suzuka and trails in Bahrain. But it\'s still the same car.""', 'A consistent p5-p7', ""We're consistently inconsistent. We're already there"", '""Next year"" has been pretty consistent theme for the past decade.', 'Same old Ferrari excuses. \n\nI feel sorry for Lewis and Charles. At least Lewis already has 7 titles and is a GOAT but Charles has no titles and with Max on the grid, he could end up retiring with no titles which will be one of the most terrible things of the sport.', 'The SF-25  has serious design flaws. Its the only top car that is struggling with ride height this year. Those were the kind of issues that teams solved back in 2023.\n\nThe 24 Ferrari was an extremely well balanced car. How the fuck did they mess this up so badly?\n\nEven Leclerc is complaining about the car being extremely tricky to drive. So Hamilton struggling is not really a surprise.\n\nIMO, Ferrari should write this season off and just focus on the new regs. The gap to Mclaren is just too big.', 'They are consistent. \n\nConsistently underwhelming.', 'And i seek happiness... not in life general but in Ferrari doing good in F1 .... both are so far away from reality...']",107,32,0.94,107,30,30,5,0,0.0,5
