Low, Somewhere in the between or extremely high?', 'Hey, did *the-race* remove all their podcasts from YouTube and move it behind their Patreon?', 'How good do you reckon was the 1986 Williams? Would they have dominated the season with a Prost-Senna lineup?', 'Another year, and another round of ""Monaco is no longer fit for purpose"" press comments and articles. I don\'t understand the obsession with trying to force Monaco to be an orthodox F1 race, unless you magically shrink the cars down to F3/FE size, it simply won\'t be. \n\nWhat makes Monaco hard to master is that, the more you push, the closer you are to clipping the wall and ending your session. It\'s why Friday and Saturday are the \'action\' days for F1. At the end of this race, Oscar was closest to stacking it because he was the only one pushing to try and catch Max/Lando/Charlie. \n\nRather than try to make it a traditional race, why not try to add something more radical that keeps the drivers on the edge? \n\n* Minimum laptimes in the race. This is a standard for oval racing, where you must maintain a minimum speed, and we have it in F1 for quali. Whether you do it as a set limit based on practice times, or a percentage of the current fastest lap, have it so if you lap below a set pace then you\'re black flagged on safety grounds. This would stop the sandbagging that dogs the race. \n* A hot lap competition with Indy 500 quali rules and points down to 20th. Set a three hour block, and you can put your name in to be next on track to set a flying lap. You either join the back of the queue and can keep your existing time, or if you want to jump to the front you lose it. If you hit the barrier and damage your car, you lose your time. It\'d keep drivers pushing, which is where Monaco comes alive. \n* Make it a NASCAR stage race, bringing out the safety car and doing a standing restart after 25 and 50 laps. Add in a mandated green flag pitstop (that has to be taken after X laps) to stop people just changing rubber under caution. Close the field back up. \n\nMonaco is not a normal grand prix track, and so I don\'t know why we want it to host a normal grand prix in the modern era. It\'s not going away, too much money comes into the sport at Monaco, and too much herritage is tied up in it.', 'I’m trying to understand why do people watch F1.\n\nI understand the aesthetics of the sport and it look cool to watch.\n\nBut I don’t get why F1 is so popular.\n\nMajority of the F1 racers came from Wealthy/Nepotism Family. The chances of making it in F1 is less than 1%. Unless your bringing in a $30 million dollar sponsorship fee your not gonna be driving an F1 car.\n\nCompared to sport like basketball and soccer, the chances of making it pro is slim. But a lot of people can relate to the sport and play in their free time without heavy investment.\n\nI’m not hating on the sport, but I’m just trying to understand how so many people support a sport that only cater to the rich.\n\nAll the parties and networking events associated with F1 is all rich people and to get in to those events. You realistically need to be rich or have connections.']",0,49,0.47,0,43,43,-3,8,-0.14,-3
