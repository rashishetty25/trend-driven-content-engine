Then he rejoins the festivities. First, he says: ‚ÄúCould anyone else become champion in this car? I would say: I wish them good luck.‚Äù\n\nThere are emotions, there is relief and, above all, Max Verstappen is happy that it's over. At least, that with two races to go he has secured his fourth championship in a row. An incredible achievement. Especially when you consider that the Red Bull driver did not have the best material for months. He himself estimates that he has not had the fastest car for seventy percent of this season. Still, things are now decided. ‚ÄúI had thought we would have to fight until the last moment, but then luckily the rain came in Brazil. That worked out pretty well,‚Äù Verstappen said, referring to his fabulous victory at Interlagos, which indirectly meant the knockout for rival Lando Norris.\n\n**Proving them wrong**\n\nThe intermediate score, more than three and a half hours after he crossed the finish line in Las Vegas? ‚ÄúI've had four beers now and two gin tonics,‚Äù said Verstappen, now holding a can of Red Bull. ‚ÄúMost of all, I'm pretty relieved. The race wasn't great, but actually a little better than expected. It's nice that it's done now and we can go into the final races in Qatar and Abu Dhabi reasonably relaxed. There I still want to get some nice results.‚Äù By then he has already wittily taken revenge on McLaren boss Zak Brown, by rubbing his nose in his face that he can also become world champion in a non-dominant car. Referring to earlier statements by the American about Verstappen's titles in 2022 and 2023. ‚ÄúSuch things only motivate me. **If people are critical and think that I can only win in the best car, I prove them wrong. If I don't get credit for this now, I don't know what else I can do. Whether I would have become champion in the McLaren? Yes! And much sooner too. In 2021 in another car (the Mercedes, ed.) I would have taken the title as well. In 2022 it would have become more difficult, because Ferrari was perhaps a little too fragile then. And last year? Well, that would have been a bit trickier.‚Äù**\n\n**Not just shouting around**\n\nA roar of laughter followed, as Verstappen and Red Bull gave the concept of dominance a whole new dimension last season. At the beginning of this year, that's where things seemed to be heading as far as 2024 is concerned, too. But since early May, the panels have shifted considerably. The question is legitimate whether anyone else could have become champion in the RB20. Especially if you compare Verstappen's performance to that of teammate Sergio P√©rez. ‚ÄúWhether it could have been? We're in Vegas, so you can maybe bet on that. I would say I wish them good luck.‚Äù Verstappen acknowledges that he is happy with how he has handled disappointments this year. Intrigues were plentiful at Red Bull, both on and off the track. As recently as early September in Monza, he said that a world title was no longer realistic. ‚ÄúWe had quite a difficult time after a very good start. I am quite proud of how we got through that as a team. As a person it's important to stay calm and not just shout around that it all sucks. I wouldn't have been as good at that a few years ago. You learn that over the years, too. And a few championships help put it into perspective more easily.‚Äù\n\n**Never been desperate**\n\nIn Las Vegas, Verstappen stayed ahead of both McLaren drivers quite easily. Mercedes (George Russell won) and Ferrari had it better than Red Bull, though. It will be interesting next week in Qatar to see how the proportions are then. At that circuit, McLaren should normally come out well, as should Red Bull. ‚ÄúAnd we have to keep a close eye on everything...,‚Äù Verstappen is referring to the possible gimmicks McLaren might have used, at least according to Red Bull. ‚ÄúI'm very proud of this season, though. I never despaired, but we had a lot of conversations - including at the factory in Milton Keynes - about what we could do better. A lot has happened and it has been a tough year.‚Äù Now he stands at four world titles, as many as Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel. And one more than, among others, his ‚Äúfather-in-law‚Äù Nelson Piquet. ‚ÄúBut the first time I met him I had nothing at all... Now, fortunately, that's a different story. He also became champion in Las Vegas in 1981. He sure knows how to party here. Used to anyway.‚Äù"", 'What happens when you give the most honest nation on Earth alcohol?\n\nMax: ‚Äúhold my trophy and watch this‚Äù', 'Verstappen to Brown:\n\n#SUCK MY BALLS MATE', 'It must be fun to win the WDC in Vegas']",8880,467,0.95,8880,20539,20539,154,2,0.0,154

Which one of you or anyone here at 18 yrs old or 19 yrs old has not made mistakes?

I understand when teams discuss Plan A or Plan B. Ferrari, on the other hand, confuse me with what sound like additional strategies like Plan E or Plan H or Plan Z.

What are these strategies? Are they taking into account both cars, e.g. Car A on 2 Stops and Car B on 1 Stop? Or are they random names as some form of OPSEC?","['They are predetermined before the race. Usually the order is random to try and prevent the other teams from guessing. Ferrari may be using letters outside of the ‚ÄòABCDE‚Äô to prevent the tendency of putting the most obvious strat as A.\n\nBernie Collins says she always used to pick a predetermined, easily remembered number (so for example 20) and put that with a letter, for example E. She‚Äôd then tell the driver E plus 6 or something, meaning pitting on lap 26 - even if that was the plan right before the race it‚Äôs still E plus 6, to make it harder for the other teams to guess.', ""No team has only 2 strategies, it's just different how they explain it."", 'serious answer: teams have strategies planed for a race depending on what happens. for example, they might think a 1 stop is the ideal - plan A - but a safety early on might have them change to a 2 stop (plan b). or tire degradation is too high, or too low, etc', 'Only a Ferrari engineer can unjumble the mess that they come up with. \n\nAnd the strategies change race by race.

1gynmcd,Is it me or was the post-race Vegas a disaster?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gynmcd/is_it_me_or_was_the_postrace_vegas_a_disaster/,2024-11-24, Discussion,"Hello, I was watching the post race thingy (before the podium) and it was BAD, first of all the interviews. I have no problem with Jenson Button, he is great, but whatever misfit was alongside him he did not ask a single good question. (can anyone educate me where he raced in?).

Before this the drivers where moved by cars to the podium, why didnt the cars just park at the strip, or was this a problem with the track invasion? It just took way to long to get the drivers back to the Strip, it was boring.

  
Also the podium looked like it was on top Aarav's Shed (the Shed) there seemed to be no atmosphere at all, also there was no cooldown room, at least the trophee looked nice. The gimmic of the drivers being lifted up onto the podium was not impressive at all.

  
The race itself also has a lot of problems, from it being way to extravagant to the fact that the track looks like a pig upside down.
