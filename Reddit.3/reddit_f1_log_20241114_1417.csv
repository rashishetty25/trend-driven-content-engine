If it is also a driver who has 257 Grands Prix under his belt and was able to celebrate eight victories, then the excitement is especially great. And so, of course, those responsible for Toro Rosso had to answer a lot of questions when the first rumors about an imminent expulsion of Daniel Ricciardo surfaced in Singapore.*\n\n\n*But no one from the leadership officially wanted to confirm the farewell. Even the driver himself did not want to know that it could be his last appearance in the premier class. Instead, an attempt was made to make the race weekend quite normal. But the longer the hanging part dragged on with the evasive statements of the participants, the clearer it became to everyone in the paddock that a great career is coming to an end here.*\n\n\n*When the separation was finally made official with a week‚Äôs delay, a lot of criticism hit the team. Ricciardo had been denied the chance to celebrate a proper farewell to Formula 1 and the fans, was the accusation. The secrecy was not worthy of a pilot like Ricciardo.*\n\n\n*Team boss Laurent Mekies admitted at the next race in Austin that they were not happy with how the weekend went: ‚ÄúWe could have handled it differently, or maybe even should have done it.‚Äù In the meantime, it was known that everyone involved knew about the impending separation before the Singapore weekend.

We knew we‚Äôd look a bit old as a team. But we also did this to protect the driver.

I have never seen such a mental strength that this person has in an athlete. And I‚Äôve been to many sports.‚Äù*\n\n\n*But the miracle unfortunately did not take place.

I keep hearing about 2026 being the year in which new regulations will apply, and this appears to mean fundamentally redesigned cars?

That is, if next year‚Äôs regulations are similar, then presumably the teams (focussing on 2026), will be applying moderate improvements to the existing cars for 2025, rather than entirely new designs?

Additionally, does anyone know yet how different the cars might have to be under the new, upcoming regulations?
