1iwqacf,"Do we have a record lowest number of current drivers to have taken part in an earnest ""title battle""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iwqacf/do_we_have_a_record_lowest_number_of_current/,2025-02-24, Discussion,"Obviously, modern F1 fans are well aware of the level of net dominance we've seen in the past 15 years, with only 1 WDC winner since 2010 winning it fewer than 4 times. However, those 15 years have had very different outcomes, of some years seeing a straight cruise to the record books, versus others with a number of different drivers in contention right through the final race. 

Currently, our grid is not only very rookie-heavy, but the dominance over the most recent regulations cycle has dwindled the number of drivers to ever have taken part in an earnest title battle. 

At any point in any season, only Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, and Lando Norris have ever truly been in the running to win the WDC. Considering that 3 of them are champions themselves, that's a pretty surprising statistic. 

Considering that FOM themselves have hyped up long shots like Perez in 2023 or Bottas for a number of years, there are seasons in which a great deal of drivers have had more legitimate title shots than any of the other 15 drivers on this year's grid... but of course, with aspiring competitors in potentially top seats like Piastri, Lawson, Russell, and Antonelli, we may add to this list quickly!

As did Norris."", 'We just need to not have one car way faster than the rest to start the season. Now when we practically have no mechanical retirements or major issues anymore, being even ~ 0.2, 0.3 ish seconds quicker a lap consistently can pretty much end the season in a few races.', ""2007 maybe? Only Alonso and Raikkonen had really been in proper title fights before that season. So that's (x2).\n\n\nThis year Leclerc has never really been in the running for a title yet and Norris was barely in the running at all last season because the field got way more competitive in the second half so a bunch of teams and drivers, including his own teammate, took wins and points away from him when a dominant car like Verstappen had early season would have given him a much better chance of catching up Verstappen's gigantic lead. I'd honestly say only Alonso, Hamilton and Verstappen have been in proper title fights on the current grid. Including Norris is incorrect IMO. So (x3).\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Just had a look back from 1994-2006. Looks about right give or take depending on what you call a credible title contender.
