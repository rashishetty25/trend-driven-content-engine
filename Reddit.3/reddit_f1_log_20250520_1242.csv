1kr1lon,Losing Imola and other historic racetracks will make the sport poorer,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kr1lon/losing_imola_and_other_historic_racetracks_will/,2025-05-20, Discussion,"First,



I have to admit I'm biased. Totally and utterly biased almost to a fault.



I was born 8 miles from Imola's racetrack, in the town that at the time was the home of the Scuderia Minardi and now is home of VC Racing Bulls. I'm the 3rd generation in my family that has experienced the racetrack. Both its inside and its outside.



All the greats raced here and all of us dreamt of racing there in a way or another. When I was in highscool in Imola I remember all of us being barely able to listen to the teacher during the race weekend or the seasonal tests:



""So in fact when Galileo **WROOOOOOOOOOOOM** falling objects **WRAAAAAAM** vacuum""



We went with the family to visit the boxes on friday(it was open at the time) and there was a nearby hill were we could gather and look without the need for a ticket.



My grandpa raced motorcycles in there and almost made a whole career out of it. He was a proud Ferrari fan, there's ALWAYS been a Ferrari flag moving in the wind at our family home. All year long.



My father raced with his friend in the racetrack, since before the races the municipality opened the track for anybody that wanted to go through it(for free). Everybody has a story related to the racetrack. I was lucky enough to get in a car driven by Augusto Farfus. I can tell you it was the ride of a lifetime.



There is a passion, a kind of love from the people that inhabit this region that is almost indescribable. You might think that this passion identifies with Ferrari but it's not  just that. Racing drivers and teams are revered. We realize how dangerous it is and I can tell you that everybody remembers where they were(if they were alive) when Ratzenberger and Senna passed away.



I was a kid and I remember my dad crying for it.



We breathed fast cars since we were born. Cars and motorcycles are a RELIGION around here. In the span of 30 miles you get Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, Pagani, Ducati. Those are the fabric of our dreams and the language in which we decline our passion for speed.



This is not to minimize what might be felt in other places, I can just tell you this is what is felt here and what I know for sure.



I am sad, I am incredibly sad at the idea of F1 leaving town (again).

I know F1, Liberty media and whatever don't give 2 shits about what I just exposed. It's becoming less and less a sport and more an attraction. I also know the point of the matter is making money, it's always been but I feel like the nature of the sport is going more towards the lifestyle associated to it(said by Domenicali as well in an interview for italian television).

I think this is going to make everybody poorer. I have nothing against the glamour and the stars roaming through the paddocks, honestly though, I don't care about catering an experience that has to be instagram polished just for the glamour of it.

The entertainment is nice and all but the point of F1 is racing and emotions and passion.

Entities with a lot of money worldwide got races that I honestly find soulless. On TV some of those look good but I'm willing to bet everything that on the ground there's not the same passion. It's the same old experience you can have with a glass of champagne in hand and a catering.



The only upside I could see is having other people in different regions experiencing what I/We experienced growing up. But I don't think that will be the case either. Prices are outrageous and due to that I don't think kids will be able to have a shared experience like we had here.



There's also the surroundings of the classic racetracks that's not to be discounted. In Imola you're literally at a 10 minutes walk from the city center. You can have the best food you ever had or get a nice breakfast in an authentic plaza and then go experience the racing.

In Dubai? Nice buildings which look the same, no character and extremely commercial.

So I’m cautious optimistic about his chances to fight for the title.', 'Putting it simple: having a better feel for balance, rear end behavior, and brake response probably gives Max the confidence to make the lap 1 move (admittedly, wouldnt put trying regardless past him at all 😉)\n\nThat aside - on this track Redbull and McLaren were pretty much on par - best evidence is the almost non-existent delta between NOR and VER after NOR clearing PIA after the safety car - similar tire age, similar fuel load, similar degree of clean air', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **All signs pointed to victory for McLaren. In the end, Max Verstappen still emerged victorious. Did Red Bull manage to turn things around and bring the wonder car to its knees with its onboard resources?**\n\n> The favorites couldn\'t be clearer. Oscar Piastri on pole position, McLaren fastest in the discipline where Red Bull and Mercedes are most feared. Hot weather and track temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius on Sunday, plus the softest tire compounds Pirelli can offer, all signs pointed to a McLaren victory.\n\n> And yet, in the end, Max Verstappen won. Just like in Suzuka. Although the track and conditions aren\'t comparable, Formula 1\'s farewell performance at Imola told a similar story. Verstappen won the start. This is even more crucial for Red Bull than for McLaren. With a clear track and a clean airflow, the RB21 almost has McLaren qualities.\n\n> Then, with the better-placed car, McLaren gambled with the strategy, just like in Japan. Piastri was brought in for a tire change on lap 13. This committed them to a two-stop race early on. McLaren underestimated two things. The hard tire wasn\'t as good as expected. And Piastri was stuck in traffic longer than expected. Although the Australian had to overtake seven cars in 15 laps, he only lost just under a second to Verstappen. This shows: The speed was there.\n\n> **McLaren loses race at the start.**\nLando Norris was already ten seconds behind after ten laps in the slipstream of George Russell\'s Mercedes when he finally managed to establish his pace. 18 laps later, it was 8.7 seconds. After Verstappen\'s VSC gift, the lead grew to 20 seconds. Norris reduced it to 18.4 seconds before the safety car 18 laps later.\n\n> The neutralization gave Verstappen and Norris a chance for a second tire change, narrowing the gap to zero, but McLaren was unlucky enough to have Piastri on old tires between them. By the time Norris had fought his way past his teammate, the train had finally left the station.\n\n> The bottom line is that McLaren was perhaps a touch faster, but never fast enough. ""The race might have had a different outcome had Oscar won the start,"" admitted team principal Andrea Stella. From then on, McLaren was on the defensive and had the choice to react or take a risk. They chose the risk and lost.\n\n> **That\'s why the heat was good for Red Bull.**\nBut why couldn\'t the McLarens take advantage of the conditions and the tire types available, as was the case in Miami? The track temperature was only 39 degrees Celsius. Yet, winner Piastri beat Red Bull and Mercedes by more than 37 seconds.\n\n> For Stella, the result at Imola was no surprise. ""Suzuka and Jeddah, like Imola, showed that this type of track suits Red Bull and limits our advantage. All tracks feature fast, flowing corners. Imola requires a completely different aerodynamic configuration than Miami. Furthermore, Red Bull made a good step with their upgrades. Nevertheless, we were surprised at the end by how fast and consistent they were.""\n\n> Red Bull technical director Pierre Waché had an explanation for why the heat didn\'t play into McLaren\'s hands on Sunday. ""On certain types of asphalt with certain tire compounds, the tire wear mechanism changes in our favor in hot weather."" The Frenchman declined to elaborate on the tire 101. ""That would give too much away.""\n\n> **Better balance enlarges setup window.**\nRed Bull has improved its much-maligned RB21 with its two-piece upgrade. The new underbody, which was already installed in Miami, delivers more stable downforce. The modified cooling intake optimizes the airflow around the sidepods, the modified rear wishbone fairings to the diffuser, and the new rear brake vents allow for better control of tire temperatures. ""But it will take time until this works as well as it does at McLaren,"" fears Sporting Director Helmut Marko.\n\n> The impact of recent developments was felt by the drivers. The Red Bull no longer changed its balance between turn-in and the apex. The understeer mid-corner disappeared, but the oversteer on the exit remained. But Verstappen can live with that. ""For the first time in a long time, Max hasn\'t complained,"" Marko said with a sigh of relief.\n\n> The champion praised: ""The car was easier to control. This made it easier to manage the tires."" Team principal Christian Horner explained that the improvements to the car expanded the setup window. Friday and Saturday were like night and day. This time, it was possible to find a good car setup and not just a half-baked compromise.\n\n> The decisive factor will be whether Imola, like Suzuka, was just a snapshot in time where the car benefited from favorable conditions or whether it will provide a better platform in the long term. Technical director Waché remains tight-lipped: ""Am I confident now? I don\'t have an answer to that. I was after Suzuka, and then we were beaten by McLaren three times in a row.""', 'i seriously hope this was a real improvement for red bull, it would make the title fight an absolute banger if it was these 3 going at it every race', ""It's not 'or', it's 'and'."", 'I think the simple answer to this question is, track dependent performance. And if RBR have been able to widen the operating window, there will be more tracks where they are able to compete with McLaren. Max is other worldly but he didn’t just make up for a 35 second deficit across a race by himself', ""Passes were surprisingly easy due to the higher than expected tire deg. Verstappen's pace was real. I think it's a 50/50 mix of an improved car and Verstappen magic.\xa0"", 'Even Yuki said the car felt better... Before he wrecked in q1', 'Horner did say that they made good improvements to the car over the weekend in his post race interview, but also praised effusively the move that Max put on Oscar in T1, so my guess is that they got the car reasonably closer and then the rest was Max being Max.']",137,155,0.84,137,1463,1463,5,0,0.0,5

1kr1qzm,Ferrari is conducting wind tunnel tests on a new suspension system. They are losing half a second per lap in qualifying.

Without developments, it risks finishing even behind Williams\n\n\n\nThe show of character at Imola helps “breathe,” brings morale (more to Hamilton than Leclerc) but cannot hide the serious troubles of a Ferrari, called this weekend to the Monte Carlo test, on the dreaded slow corners. Focusing on 2026, with rule changes and new superhybrid engines that few like, is crucial. But giving up the fight in the current championship could have devastating consequences on the standings and prestige. That is why developments are essential. Among the most important and long-awaited is the modified rear suspension. It has passed dynamic dyno testing and is being tested in the wind tunnel with different aerodynamics, it will change especially in the attachment area. The goal is to unlock “potential,” a topic that generates disagreements between team principal Fred Vasseur and the drivers.\n\n\n\nWorld Championship still long: you can't win but neither can you give up\n\n\n\nThere are 17 races and four sprints left in the World Championship. The gaps for those like Ferrari who travel far from the frontrunners (McLaren and Verstappen) have shrunk to the point where even teams that previously were not are now a threat. Williams, a team on the rebound, with Albon's fifth-place finish at Imola: 51 points collected, fifth among constructors behind the Cavallino, last year at the same stage of the championship was at zero.\n\n\n\nFerrari, on the other hand, took the reverse route: the average gap from the McLarens was 4-5 tenths, while at the end of 2024 it was around a tenth. The figure takes into account tire differences; this season Pirelli introduced softer compounds. Almost all the teams have met the performance increase forecast, not Ferrari.\n\nSome examples? If the 2024 Rossa had faced qualifying at Imola instead of the current one, it would have been half a second faster.  An enormity that cannot be explained only by errors in the preparation of the launch lap (Vasseur's thesis), by general difficulties in warming up the tires. \n\nThe compromise on heights\n\n\n\nIn Maranello, technical director Loic Serra is juggling two tasks: directing the 2026 group and correcting the SF-25's mechanical problems. It is not an easy job nor one that is quickly solved. Hamilton in recounting Sunday's comeback said the “car came to life.” What does that mean? That it starts going fast when the gasoline in the tank drops below 70 percent. The car's fundamental conundrum is a mechanical one: when the downforce (the force that crushes the car to the ground) shifts back, coming out of corners, the trim adjustments are not sufficient to cover its limits. Compression damages the bottom if the height is too extreme in qualifying, and so one must accept compromise solutions that lose 15-20 load points on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe 2024 wing for Monte Carlo\n\n\n\n The fix is forced, the revised suspension is expected by the British GP at Silverstone (July 6). But first the most decisive Saturday of the season must be faced, in Monte Carlo where something winning will be seen again: in fact, the rear wing of the SF-24 with which Leclerc took pole and then triumphed in the race twelve months ago will be used. It will also be Adrian Newey's first time in an Aston Martin uniform. They tell us in Maranello that someone regretted not taking him. Market research is wide open-the problem is convincing the brains to come."", '> They are losing half a second per lap in qualifying \n\nCharles is making it 4 poles in 5 years in Monaco regardless.', 'Ferrari had great pace in last race but..... what I can see in race that the car still feels sluggish at tight corners, the rear end is way too slippery and it hasn\'t improved much since Aus. We can only hope that this new setup helps in reducing it.\n\nAnd the Article is right, they can\'t give ip the development on 2025 as Williams is improving every race.

1kqa20i,The Stealth Winner at Imola: Pirelli,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kqa20i/the_stealth_winner_at_imola_pirelli/,2025-05-19, Discussion,"Imola this year was a great example of how good tire engineering can contribute to an entertaining race. This was obscured somewhat by the safety cars, but tire wear presented every team with interesting dilemmas, and the difficulty of the choice was highlighted by how many teams chose different strategies, or split strategies between their drivers. 

Pit stops at Imola are unusually costly, but Pirelli had tire compounds where it was difficult to decide between a one-stop and a two-stop strategy. At first it seemed like the undercut would be massively powerful, only for the mediums to come back. But as the stint went on, Albon (on a one stop) started warning the team they were taking a big risk by running those tires so long, though he was delivered by a timely safety car.

Imola is a track where it's difficult to pass, but the race would have been good even without the safety cars because everyone was worried they were on the wrong strategy, and were making difficult choices at multiple junctures, some of which jumbled up the running order in interesting ways.","['It was an easy one stop race despite the tyres being a step softer than last year. The mediums have strong pace for nearly 50% of race distance.\n\nAs Isola mentioned ahead of the race, they are thinking about introducing a gap between the compounds so that the Hard tyre is the slowest tyre at events later in the year, so that more stops of fresher rubber is quicker.', 'i disagree, the race was an easy one stopper and it wasnt even close. \n\nHalf the grid just got baited by ferrari and Leclerc into a two stopper.', ""Have we seen the same race?\n\nThe C6 was borderline unusable. It was so bad that it wasnt the best tyre during qualifying. The only reason C6 was used is that every team gets so many of em and only a few C5 and two C4. \n\nEven with the C5 collapsing early (if you used it during qualifying or got baited into the stop), the 2 Stop was clearly disadvantaged, even without the perfect 1 stop VSC.\n\nSo we had a soft that couldn't hold a single lap. A qualifying where you can't push 100%. \n\nA medium that was good for 25+ laps of management. \n\nA hard that was good for a 24h race. \n\nGreat tyre engineering here."", '>good tire engineering\n\nmediums faster than the soft', 'Without the VSC and SC it would have been a boring race where Piastri, Russell and Sainz would have suffered from their early stops/bad strategy.', 'I though the whole point of the new compounds was that they couldn’t make a 1 stop strategy work easily, you know, as max pushed easily to do it before the vsc', 'should just do away with the C1 and C2 entirely imo', 'disagree', 'Mate what are you on about. Almost all the grid was going for a one-stop before any shenanigans happened.']",0,57,0.47,0,397,397,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0

Thought Leclerc was great until the Albon kerfuffle but even then that was a net win for Ferrari.\n\nBut it does seem like Straw has overrated qualifying. I don't really get Lando behind Oscar.

Youd think they would outweigh the qualifying difference"", 'Oscar’s PR is nuts lol', 'Questionable rankings to say the least', ""Most weird rankings I've seen yet, but i guess Edd has done a valid attempt of taking luck completely out of the equation, and give each driver his due.\n\nOnly thing i really disagree with is Piastris ranking. You lose the lead (and possibly the race) like that, you don't get to be 4th."", 'There’s no way Albon and Sainz should be so far apart, even in quali they were only half a tenth apart', 'Piastri was the 4 best driver this weekend per this ranking. He started on pole, lost it at T1, couldn\'t manage his tyres so was pitted early, unlucky with the SCs and finished P3 behind his teammate. All his bad luck comes from him making a mistake at T1.\n\nI REALLY can\'t understand that one, it does feel like both McLaren drivers have different expectations set to extract from the car. Whenever Norris makes a mistake it\'s always ""with the car he has he shouldn\'t be making those mistakes or finishing lower than x"". With Piastri it\'s like there is always a reason for his mistakes, even if it is ultimately his fault, there\'s always an excuse as to why. Seen it in Australia, saw it yesterday in Imalo. It\'s kinda weird.', 'Not awful rankings but I feel Alonso always gets a huge leg up on these considering Stroll is his only benchmark\n\nPiastri is also rated too high. If it was who Norris had decided to brake 3 years before turn 1 we’d still being clowning him for it', ""I really disagree with his ratings on the Mclaren drivers and I feel like Mr Straw is overrating Qualifying a little bit too much. If this was Monaco or your average race at Imola, then yeah, putting a lot of importance on qualifying is justified, but at this particular race weekend, it doesn't considering the pole sitter finished 3rd, Leclerc could've easily have gotten 4th or even 3rd if he got a bit luckier, and one of, if not currently the strongest qualifier on the Grid (Russell) having an absolute mare of a race after beating a Mclaren in qualifying."", 'definitely don’t agree with everything but i like that he tries to take the luck and safety car shananigans out of it and looks purely at the driver’s performance and whether the driver maximized or not']",0,149,0.43,0,859,859,0,1,0.0,0
1kqqrmy,A call for respect on behalf of Argentine Formula 1 fans,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kqqrmy/a_call_for_respect_on_behalf_of_argentine_formula/,2025-05-19, Discussion,"I deeply regret the inappropriate comments and insults uttered by a small group of people who, perhaps newly familiar with Formula 1, have unfairly attacked drivers and their associates who had some kind of incident or interaction on the track with Franco Colapinto.



I want to make it clear that this attitude in no way represents the feelings of the vast majority of Argentine motorsports fans, and Formula 1 fans in particular. The true followers of this exciting sport greatly enjoy every broadcast, value the talent of all the drivers, and enthusiastically support the career of our representative, Franco Colapinto, without ever resorting to disrespect or verbal abuse.



We sincerely apologize to anyone who may have felt offended by these regrettable actions, which tarnish the sporting spirit and genuine passion we feel for the highest category of motorsports.","['I don\'t think it\'s just a ""small group"" given how we have seen similar grotesque behaviour in other motorsports like Indycar and other sports like football.', 'Does Argentina have a disproportionate amount of teenage boys? Or adults with the same level of maturity?', ""Having seen what happened to Callum Illot, I feel like it's not a small group.  I even had people tell me in the wake of the Illot situation that I shouldn't be so sensitive and that was just how people act in Argentine sporting communities."", ""I think the problem is the very big difference between traditional motorsport fans and football fans. There's a group so big on instagram formed by dumbass football fans that watched their very first F1 race last year, honestly anyone who watched F1 before 2024 in Argentina is dying of embarrassment right now. I'd like to bury my head in the ground and hope these attacks never happen again."", 'I think this is a nice post, but the issue is a BIG problem, the pure numbers mean nothing, and the only way to fix it is for other Argentine fans to aggressively call bad fans out and ostracise them from the discussion. \n\nIn cricket we have a similar problem with fans from  a certain subcontinental country - and their ‘support’ just ruins it for everyone involved.', 'Nah fam, I agree it’s not all argentinians, but it’s not a small group either. This is not the first time of the first sport where this happens.', ""The same thing happened with Augustin Canapino and Callum Ilott in Indy car tho. And other drivers in Indy that Argentine fans didn't like for whatever reason."", ""This isn't new or a particularly small group. It's cool you aren't like them, and it's probably not an actual majority who are crazy.. but it's not some group of 100 fans or something.  Its a LOT more than that."", 'Appreciate your statement, I do believe it is going to take more, louder fellow countrymen pushing back and speaking out. It is a large number, came to F1 only when Franco entered, they did it at Williams, then Alpine even before in seat, then death threats, then racial slurs. All escalated. It’s going to be a long season of this if not curtailed. There’s various utube channels that claim to be Franco supporters that are nothing more than hate chambers. If he does well, they bash his team mate (Albon, Gasly) if he doesn’t do well they bash TP and even mechanics with outlandish claims. Think at this point there would be backlash for Williams if he ever were to return as this fan base goes against the new ethos. Argentine Sports/Racing Federations should speak out and folks should file complaints with utube. Alpine (Flavio, Franco) and FIA need to issue harsher statements calling out fanbase and referencing Doohan and Yuki incidents by name. Vague PR statements are rather offensive. Think FIA should fine teams for fan behavior like in other sports leagues. FIA implemented new rule at beginning of year stating negative comments lead to online abuse but it was in protection of stewards and race officials with fines for drivers and teams. Where’s the decisive action to protect drivers? Something has to change. Even with intense rivalries of past, this isn’t how F1 should operate as a brand and this should not be an acceptable new norm. It hurting drivers, they need ACTION, that includes hurting Franco’s own career.']",0,143,0.4,0,970,970,0,12,0.0,0
