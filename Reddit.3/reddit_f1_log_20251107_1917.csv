1oqc7h6,Fear of tire damage in Qatar: Pirelli plans radical rule change,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oqc7h6/fear_of_tire_damage_in_qatar_pirelli_plans/,2025-11-06, News,,"[""Translation:\n\nThe Qatar Grand Prix is Pirelli's most challenging race. No other racetrack puts as much strain on tires as the Losail circuit. It is the combination of many extremely fast corners, rough asphalt, and aggressive curbs at the exit of corners that pushes the rubber rolls to their limits.\n\nTires have been the focus of attention at all three Grands Prix held in the emirate since 2021. At the Qatar debut in 2021, Pirelli counted four tire failures during the race. Each time, it was the left front tire that was affected. Valtteri Bottas, George Russell, Nicholas Latifi, and Lando Norris had stayed on the track too long on one set of tires despite high wear.\n\nThis was a warning to Pirelli for future races. When Formula 1 returned to Qatar two years later, the problem worsened. Not only were the ground effect cars 50 kilograms heavier than their predecessors, they also achieved significantly higher speeds in the fast corners. To increase the radius, the drivers allowed themselves to be carried far beyond the kerbs.\n\nDriving on the bumpy track caused breaks between the tread and the carcass. Moving the track limits inwards did not help. In order to ensure the race could be completed safely, Pirelli and the FIA imposed a running time limit on the tires. No set of tires was allowed to be driven for more than 18 laps. That meant at least three pit stops per participant.\n\nFor 2024, the curbs were flattened slightly. This eliminated the risk of tread separation. However, the fear of tire damage remained. Unlike on other tracks, the problem at Losail is not thermal wear, but abrasion. “When the tread becomes too thin, the tire is no longer protected. Then a stone or a small splinter is enough to tear the rubber layer,” explains Pirelli's head of motorsport Mario Isola.\n\nLast year, Pirelli left it at a recommendation. The teams were asked not to drive more than 24 laps on one set of tires. But as soon as the race started, some teams ignored the warning and, for strategic reasons, covered longer distances than Pirelli had requested.\n\nLewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz both suffered a blowout on their left front tire almost simultaneously after 34 laps. Both had driven over debris from a rearview mirror that a Williams had lost on the home straight with their heavily worn tires.\n\nTo prevent a repeat, Pirelli is currently discussing a mandatory mileage limit with the teams for the penultimate World Championship race on November 30. The maximum permitted mileage is still under negotiation.\n\nIn the end, however, it will mean that all drivers will have to change tires at least twice during the race. Pirelli does not want to prescribe a specific number of mandatory pit stops, as this would mean having no control over the number of laps per set of tires."", ""Why shouldnt tires burst when overused? If a driver risks it and it blows up, it's their fault not pirellis. Isn't this exactly what we want? And softs not going for 40 fucking laps?"", 'I have a foolproof plan to avoid this issue in future\n\n\nDrop Qatar\xa0', 'May I suggest….wets?', ""It's about having stint limits like 2023. Last year, teams were essentially pushing the tyres to the puncture limit because the wear is high, but the tyres dont lose performance accordingly"", 'All the people talking about giving recommendations and leaving the teams to deal with it, I recommend you watch the NASCAR Cup highlights from Sunday…', 'i thought the whole intent with the tire system was to try to encourage varied strategy and incentivize pit stops. they have the task of making tires good enough for the cars to perform but also bad enough to where people need to pit due to pace or dnf concerns. \n\nas far as what was described here teams pushing their tires to the absolute limit before risking a dnf sounds like the goal being met. i guess not in the way they wanted to and perhaps safety is enough of a concern, but yeah.', 'Let the teams decide how much to push it', 'How about give the recommendation about what the tyres can take and then let the teams take the risk on how far to go with them.

1. Drivers accumulate points for every position   
2. There is a POSTSEASON ( yes this is a motorsport but it's also american so yeah)  
3. Top 16 in the regular season (which lasts until Belgium here) Earns you a place in the playoff   
4. There are 4 post season round RO16, RO12, RO8 , and the final 4  
5. Everyone's points get reset apart from the postseason points you earn  
6. you get 5 bonus postseason points per regular season win   
7.Each knockout round runs for the 3 races where the bottom 4 get eliminated   
8. In the final race the final 4 go at it for the win whoever finishes ahead wins the WDC  
9. (This is for the NASCAR guys in this subreddit ) No stage points just cause the races are too short to implement it
