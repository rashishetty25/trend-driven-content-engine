My take is, you do a mistake right? But like in the Sainz case it wasn't so fatal because both drivers continued the race and they still have a chance of improving or getting something out of it. But in the Kimi - Charles scenario, Charles is absolutely done. There is nothing that he can do to overturn the bad luck.
