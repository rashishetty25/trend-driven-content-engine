1i9ojre,The FIA swearing ban is mentally insane.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i9ojre/the_fia_swearing_ban_is_mentally_insane/,2025-01-25, Discussion,"What on Earth was MBS thinking when he drew up those rules? Penalty for friggin swearing? Race ban threats? Thousands of Euros in fines?

I think this is too much. Almost every F1 driver swears, and these new rules are a recipe for disaster, both in F1 and in other FIA series.

The average accrued penalty points by the end of the first season of these rules will be worse than Lord Mahaveer's F2 season.

And not just that, it's in the Motorsport Code, meaning it won't just be F1 that's affected; F2, F3, FE, WEC, it will apply to anything FIA-regulated.

How long until an F1 race has as many starters as Monaco '96 had finishers? How long until an LMP2 driver wins the 24 Hours of Le Mans because most of everyone in the Hypercars said a bad word?

These new rules are a powder keg. I can only hope they'll be taken out.","[""All of the F1 drivers should get together every GP and swear like sailors. \n\nLet's see the FIA ban all 20 drivers."", ""He's an insecure petty little dictator.

•	⁠**3** rookies,

•	⁠**13** drivers staying with their team,

•	⁠**3** drivers changing teams,

•	⁠**1** driver coming back after a break from F1.

Other key numbers:

•	⁠**19** drivers started the 2024 season in the same seat they started 2023 (and the whole grid started in the seat they finished the 2023 season in),

•	⁠**8** drivers started the 2019 season in the same seat they finished 2018 with,

•	⁠Lewis Hamilton drove **12** seasons with Mercedes while at the end of 2025, Max Verstappen will have been with Red Bull for **9.5** seasons,

•	⁠In the last decade, Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas had the longest teammates tenure with **5** seasons together between 2017 & 2021,

1ia1n64,The Drivers Should Threaten to Boycott 2026 Over the FIA’s New Rules,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ia1n64/the_drivers_should_threaten_to_boycott_2026_over/,2025-01-26, Discussion,"My initial feeling was that they should just strike for the first 3 races of 2025, but admittedly a lot of fans have already bought tickets, and while most real fans would understand why it was happening, some people may still be upset at the drivers. 

So instead the GPDA should issue a statement that says ‘If anyone is punished based on these ridiculous rules this year, we guarantee that NONE of us will race in 2026’. 

What, they’re going to risk the first season of their new regulations being made up of reserve drivers and F2 drivers? No one would buy tickets to next years’ races, and We all know F1 is about the bottom line. 

Realistically, I know there are contracts in place that make this difficult, but I’ve got to imagine that the teams stand behind the drivers more than the FIA. 

Even just say Max and Lewis doing it could be enough. Nevermind if Charles/Lando/George join in.

The drivers hold more power in F1 than FIA because people pay to see the drivers race, to hear their thoughts, see their personalities etc… not see what ridiculous rules the FIA can come up with next. The drivers can shut this whole thing down. 

I hope they flex the power they have.
