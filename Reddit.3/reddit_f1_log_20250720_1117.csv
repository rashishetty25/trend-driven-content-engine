1m45i4q,Carlos Sainz: Williams rebuild has brought 'highest workload' of F1 career,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m45i4q/carlos_sainz_williams_rebuild_has_brought_highest/,2025-07-19, News,,"['It will be very interesting to see if he ups his game in the second half of the season.\xa0\n\nI was sure that Sainz would have the measure of Albon this season but Alex has proved me completely wrong.\xa0', 'Alex was always going to have an early advantage as he‚Äôs been there for about 4 years now so he‚Äôs had time to fully establish himself within the team, but seriously Carlos needs to up his game and Williams really needs to stop having so much reliability trouble.', 'People here acting like Carlos isn‚Äôt driving well as if the first half of his season hasn‚Äôt been riddled with bad luck that whenever he gets close to scoring big points, something out of his control always has to happen to him. \n\nThe only thing I can really fault him for were the first 3-5 races, but even then he got his act in qualifying and in race pace relatively quickly. Otherwise, here‚Äôs the full context of all his past races based on radios and post-race debriefs in the media\n\nSilverstone - Was having a very solid race and a very good pace. Maximized the car during quali and started P9. Was well into the points until Charles took them both out.\n\nAustria - Something was wrong with the brakes before quali even started. Didn‚Äôt even start the race because the car got on fire\n\nCanada - Got impeded during qualifying and was subsequently knocked out of Q1. Had to start the race from the back of the pack, but showed good pace with the car and managed to climb up to p10 even though he was doing a lot of LICO because the car had a lot of unresolved cooling issues\n\nBarcelona - Got held up in the pitlane because Alpine had issues during qualifying and had to do his final quali lap with a lot of traffic (for added context, the Williams car is not good in that circuit so everything had to be perfect). Last safety car in the race could have been an opportune moment to get in the points but there was a lot of delayed action coming from the pitwall.\n\nMonaco - Mostly on the driver during quali that got him knocked out at Q2. Couldn‚Äôt get the softs on this track.\n\nImola - Beautiful qualifying. Truly on top of the car now, but was extremely unlucky with the safety car in the race that turned his p6 start into a p8 finish\n\nMiami - Miami sprint mistakes were mostly on him‚Äî however he quickly bounced back for quali and started p6. However he had to start the race with old mediums because the team placed the wrong tyre on him during the sprint. In addition, he collected damage from his teammate and experienced time loss of about 3 tenths per lap. He was also unlucky with the safety car again\n\nSaudi - Incredible qualifying with a p6 start again. However the car couldn‚Äôt really compete with the top cars for this track and had to end the race with a p8. However, it was a really clean race. The only problem was the 6 seconds pitstop\n\nBahrain - Furst time he really got a hang of qualifying. P8 start. But then, him and Yuki had a racing incident when Yuki lost the car and he had to DNF\n\nJapan - Team didnt tell him about Hamilton so he got a penalty for impeding. If he started where he should have then points could have been in the table especially since he was one of the few who managed to put out multiple overtakes despite the track not being overtake friendly\n\nChina - Seat was unattached during quali and was told to LICO multiple times during the race (highly implied that they miscalculated the amount of fuel needed)\n\nAustralia - Lack of familiarity with the merc engine made him DNF. However he helped maximize team points by calling for the right strategy.', ""Sainz' performance is a bit of a shocker honestly. I expected both to be matched (especially as his 2018 year did not look particularly good against Hulk with 5 less DNFs) evenly and Albon having team advantage, but this is not good."", ""I always remember a behind the scenes bit where sainz was moaning about having to do autograph signings or something and leclerc had to point out to him how lucky they were to be F1 drivers and it's always stuck with me about him. Bit of a mask slip.\n\nI won't find a source it was years ago."", 'Go Weeyums!', 'It is taking Sainz longer than I expected to adjust to the culture shock of moving from Ferrari to Williams. Sort of like when Clay Reggazoni went from Ferrari to Ensign.', ""Damn, mad respect for Sainz putting in that grind! F1 ain't just about speed, it's bout the sweat n blood behind the scenes too. Ppl gotta realize, talent gets u started but it's the work that keeps u at the top. üí™üò§ Gotta love that hustle. #Respect4Sainz"", 'Wayyy too much hype surrounding him this past off season. \n\nMany people just parrot whatever comments they read on here but anyone who thought he‚Äôd dominate Albon have not been paying attention. \n\nIn 22 when Ferrari were closest to winning the wdc he was absolutely nowhere. His team got binotto to nerf the car for him the next year and ferrari suffered as a whole.', ""This makes it sound like he's been slacking his time at Ferrari?""]",1148,108,0.98,1148,697,697,75,8,0.0,75
1m3vut0,"In your view, was the Ground Effect Era a success?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m3vut0/in_your_view_was_the_ground_effect_era_a_success/,2025-07-19, Discussion,"With the new regulations featuring a move away from Venturi tunnels, I want to hear everyone‚Äôs opinion on this matter. 

Comparing general field spread from 2017-2021, it has of course been much better across the last four years. 

Racing in the early stages of the regulations (2022 to mid-2023) compared to the 2017 - 2021 era, was definitely better. But the advantage it offered of ‚Äòcloser racing‚Äô was relatively quickly nullified for what it promised as cars reached higher levels of downforce again. And according to multiple drivers it‚Äôs back to pre-2022 levels of dirty air again since 2024. A promised advantage that barely lasted 2 years really.

Not to the mention the exaggerated spray from the floors and how it affected wet racing (or rather the lack of wet racing). There‚Äôs also the weight issue with cars weighing almost 800kg (Multiple drivers mentioning how it affected handling and general racing)

So I ask you, do you think the ground effect era was a success or rather a step in the wrong direction?

And what was your biggest ‚Äòissue‚Äô or ‚Äòproblem‚Äô with this set of regulations.","['I remember watching the first race of 2022 and being flabbergasted how close the cars were following each other half way through the first lap. Pre 2022 cars would drop quickly 1~2s behind each other due to dirty air. After the raised the ride height due to porpoising this era started to get worse', ""The biggest problem was that they simplified the suspension. With a more complex one, most of the issues would have been solved, and raising the floor wouldn't have been necessary."", ""I think it underdelivered, but as a fan I can't really complain. Was very interesting nonetheless."", 'The ground effect era imo was at its best in 2022 for about half a season, when it almost completely negated dirty air and allowed for some of the most exciting battles in ages with cars able to follow each other closely. Starting with TD039 we‚Äôve been going completely backwards, although when you look at how many drivers and teams have ended up on the podium across the current regulation set, overall it‚Äôd still be deemed as a success. I would also like to call out cost cap and aerodynamic development restrictions as equal enablers of close racing during this era.', 'The word ‚Äúporpoising‚Äù got annoying really quick.', 'It is a success in that they managed to make races faster and somewhat more competitive in an 800+kg car over 5.5m long. \n\nFundamentally this is the problem. The car needs to be smaller and lighter (IMHO). Easy to say and hard to do given the competing requirements of cost, ""road relevance"", raceability, safety and overall speed.', ""A qualified success. \n\nGood: Field spread has been very close. Outside of the top 4 teams there's basically no backmakers any more. There's the top 4 and the midfield. Which is great and probably the first time in 30 years of watching F1 that there's really no tail end charlies. \n\nFollowing has been easier at least at first. The issue is the FIA did not follow up the way they had said they would. There was supposed to be rule changes every year to stop teams making dirty air. They didn't and now we see the results. \n\nIt didn't help that Red Bull dominated for much of it. 2023 was an interesting enough season down the field but one driver winning almost very race is never that compelling. But that sort of thing happens whatever the regulations"", ""Mercedes tried out a whole new concept which was amazing to see, sad it didn't pan out. But that takes balls."", ""Contrary to most opinions here, I think it has been the best of the 3 formulas of the turbo hybrid era. Field spread has been much closer, we've had a great variety of winners, and there's been more potential for close battles.\n\nIt's definitely not been perfect, as often happens, they've optimised their cars to the detriment of good racing, but I've enjoyed watching 2022-2025 much more than I did 2014-2020.""]",566,290,0.94,566,6163,6163,9,2,0.0,9
