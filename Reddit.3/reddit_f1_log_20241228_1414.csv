1hnfkgi,"Arvid Lindblad is going to Formula Regional Oceania. I believe this is to get the super license points he needs to be the Red Bull reserve driver in 2025 (pending permission for a 17 year old, otherwise, he'll be eligible in August.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hnfkgi/arvid_lindblad_is_going_to_formula_regional/,2024-12-27, Discussion,"Formula Regional Oceania, in my opinion, is the best deal for easy super license points that there is. It's a winter series, and gives out points like any non-FRECA formula regional (18, 14, 12, 10, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0) while having a much weaker strength of field than another winter option like Formula Regional Middle East.

I believe Arvid has 28 Super license points at the moment. (30 if he got no penalty points last year, but it's hard to find reference for that. Picking up at least a point or two is very common so I think he probably did at one point.) So, he only needs 3rd in FROC to get a super license without even needing FP1s. (If you're trying to check my math, remember that karting SL points last 5 years. It's not something that comes up that often, but Arvid still has 3 SL points from karting that haven't rolled off.)

It is more respectable than doing F4 Middle East, which would be an option. Bedrin did it after his first year in F3. Formula Regional Oceania does have Red Bull history back when it was the Toyota Racing Series.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

It's just going to lower the quality of the drivers we're getting in the future. I mean it's always been a rich man's sport, but now it's getting on all new level of rich.
