Also worth noting: the first time Leclerc and Verstappen passed through the double-yellow zone, Verstappen gained nearly 4 tenths on Leclerc in the stadium by not slowing down as much. He almost passed Leclerc on the main straight by setting up the overtake (aka, racing) in a double yellow zone.

He basically demonstrated to race control that he wasnt going to properly respect a double-yellow, and use it to gain an advantage.

Safety needs to come first and double yellows do not always slow people down in the way they should.

There's a maximum of 43 points available each weekend (25 for the fastest stop, 18 for the second fastest stop), which means that McLaren can only earn 4x43=172 points at most, which isn't enough to close the 204-point gap, even if Ferrari failed to score a single point at the next four races.

So congrats to Ferrari on a dominant season in the pits, they win their second Fastest Pit Stop Award after winning the inaugural one in 2015, become only the second team to win it multiple times and dethrone Red Bull who had won it the past 7 years.

To be honest, if it's very serious, it would have been instantly red flagged.

As we know, drivers needs to lift ""significantly"" when they saw double yellow, or it will be 10s stop-and-go penalty. However, F1 cars (or even F2) are still travelling at 250kph or higher even if you lift.
No one can stop the car at 250kph or even react to human on track if they exist at blind spot. At this point we are just waiting for disasters to happen.
