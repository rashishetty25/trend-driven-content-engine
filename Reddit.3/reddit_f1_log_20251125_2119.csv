In '86, it was a four-way fight between Alain, Nigel, Nelson and Ayrton, while in '25 it was seen more as an internal battle between the McLaren duo—almost like another Silver War.

However, with two Grands Prix left, I’ve found the two seasons to be quite similar.

In the ’86, Nigel led with 70 points, followed by Nelson on 60 and Alain on 59. Right now, Lando has 390 points, with Oscar and Max both on 366. Considering the points systems of each era, the trends look quite similar.

In the ’86, the title fight was between the two Williams drivers, who were competing with the constructors’ championship-winning team, and Alain, the defending champion driving a McLaren that was regarded as relatively uncompetitive. This year shows a similar pattern as well, with McLaren’s two drivers battling against the defending champion, Max.

In the end, Alain, sitting in third like Max currently, went on to successfully defend his title against Williams. Will Max be able to do what Alain did in ’86? What are your thoughts?

1p6jhj2,Bearman's Performance where HTB is Allowed/Banned: A logistic regression model,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6jhj2/bearmans_performance_where_htb_is_allowedbanned_a/,2025-11-25, Statistics,"Welcome to unserious stats with me, Woakula! With 2 days before Thanksgiving, I’m alone in the office and have just enough time to entertain myself with mindless nonsense before I go to lunch. Anyways I was intrigued by the table about Bearman’s performance where Hormone Treated Beef (HTB) is/is not restricted originally created by u/_StarDust_0. I figured it’d be fun to run it through a logistical analysis to see if we can find anything interesting.

First off, I suppose I need to answer what is logistical analysis? Well, logistic regression/analysis is a method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a binary outcome. It predicts the probability of an outcome occurring which is represented as a 0/1 or a no/yes in this the case a top 10 finish.

Here is the data courtesy of u/_StarDust_0, if you find errors here take it up with them, I just copied it without verifying the accuracy, as any good data scientist should.

https://preview.redd.it/9l15n3ffxf3g1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9512a9aadbff9f8621856a5cd0629d245488f7e

  
Here are our variables:

1.      Outcome variable is the race result (which I divided into top 10 finishes (0/1 or no/yes))

2.      Independent variable is the approved status of Hormone Treated Beef (0/1 or banned/allowed)

**Our question is: Does the approval status of Hormone Treated Beef increase the probability of Bearman finishing top 10?**

My 5 lines of code in R:

>`model <- glm(race_top10 ~ HTB_numeric,`

>`data = f1_bearman,`

>`family = binomial(link = ""logit""))`

>`exp(coef(model))`

>`summary(model)`

The line starting with model is our logistic regression model

Exp(cof(model)) converts the logistic odds-coefficient created in the previous step into an odds ratio which is more interpretable.

Summary(model) is our output.

https://preview.redd.it/h9pgwp5oxf3g1.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=381e00544bc049cdd2588935852879333df1e57c

**Interpretation:**

Let’s take a look at our exp(coef(model)) line:

The intercept is 0.20. this is the odds of a top 10 finish when HTB is banned. We do need to convert this odds to a probability:

Probability = odds / (1+odds)

Probability = 0.2/(1+0.2) = 0.167 or 16.7%

So when HTB is banned, there is a 16.7% chance of Bearman finishing the race in a top 10 position.

HOWEVER, when HTB if allowed the odds are multiplied by 11.667

New odds = 0.2 x 11.667 = 2.33

Converting to probability: 2.33/(1+2.33) = .70 or 70%

Therefore, When HTB is allowed Bearman has a 70% chance of scoring a top 10 finish. A whopping 53.3% increase compared to regions where HTB is banned. Get our boy some HTB!

**What does the summary(model) line tell us?**

Well our coefficient of 2.4567 tells us that we have a positive direction (when HTB is allowed the log-odds increase) we converted these log odds to probability in the previous step.

The p value (Pr(>|z|)) tells us if the relationship is statistically significant. In this case we have a p-value of 0.0179. This tells us there is a 1.79% probability of observing a relationship this strong (or stronger) between HTB approval status and a top 10 race finish for Beaman. This means the relationship is unlikely to be due to random chance alone (technically lol) We have ""evidence"" that HTB is a genuine predictor of a top 10 race finish.

**But what about the confidence interval?** 

Let's run a 6th line of code:

`exp(confint(model))`

this line calculates the confidence interval for our odds ratio which was calculated in step 2. 

https://preview.redd.it/xqarmy01yf3g1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=085b69031badcbaf47394b003dd4d429cb09ff54

Look at the HTB\_numeric line, the lower and upper bounds are massive. Way too big to actually be useful in the real world, but for the laughs let's convert them to a probability anyways

Probability lower bound: 1.77/(1+1.77) = .6389 or 63.89%

Probability upper bound: 115.82/(1+115.82) = .9914 or 99.14%

So we are 95% confident that the true probability of HTB affecting a top 10 finish from Bearman lies somewhere between 63.89% and 99.14%. With such a large window there is a lot of uncertainty in our model. 

Let’s conveniently forget that for this to be real we need to come up with a plausible reason this relationship exists. I hypothesize that HTB is actually a performance enhancing substance that only affects our GOAT Ollie Bearman. When he races in countries where HTB is allowed he eats a big steak allowing him to digest all the drugs (cause that’s how this works in my universe). He shows up on race day and bam! An increased chance at a top 10 finish! Why isn’t his team bringing HTB with them everywhere for the performance gainz? Well idk, maybe a freezer it too expensive…..

1p6bcc3,[OC] Probability Distribution of 2025 Final Championship Points: Verstappen vs. Norris (Qatar Sprint to Abu Dhabi),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6bcc3/oc_probability_distribution_of_2025_final/,2025-11-25, Statistics,"I’ve been playing around with the points permutations for the final three races of the season and built a probability distribution for Verstappen vs Norris from the Qatar Sprint to Abu Dhabi.

# Analysis

* Each remaining race gives a range of possible points for each driver (0 to 25 for a race, 0 to 8 for a sprint).
* I treated every finishing position as equally likely.
* I generated all combinations of results across the remaining weekends.
* For each combination, I calculated the driver’s total season points.
* Then I created a probability distribution based off all the combinations available.

The chart shows the final distribution for both drivers. The overlap area between the curves represents the chance that Verstappen finishes ahead of Norris in total points.

Verstappen and Piastri are currently on equal points, so Piastri’s distribution is mathematically identical to Verstappen’s. I left it out to keep the chart clear.

# Key Result

The probability Verstappen finishes the season with greater than or equal points than Norris is about 8%.

This isn’t a prediction; driver form, car pace, DNFs, and the usual chaos are not part of this model.","['Why do you use equal distribution of places. This makes no sense. It would be much better to make distribution based on the results from the season or any different way than equal.', 'This is a pretty rudimentary visualization. Like I guess people can find this interesting but this would be the same with any driver and 2 go and sprint and just shifted by their point gap. Not really anything unique', 'So basically if they were to roll the actual dice instead of racing then Max would have 8% chance to win, yes? :)', 'Lol sure of course the race is gonna be rolling dices', 'So. Probability distribution gives them an equal likelihood to finish the season with exactly the same point spread as they do now.\n\nBecause you plugged in likelihood of finishing 10th just as likely as first. Genius.....', 'Yeah this is just completely missing the point and has no real relevance with the likelihood of places being equal. It’s \xa0such an over approximation that it’s misleading rather than being a rudimentary model as it’s got a fundamental error in the assumptions made.\xa0', ""In the distribution i used max wins everything with 100% probability and every other driver is unable to finish the race. Also Max becomes my friend.\n\nIt works out to 100% chance for Max to win. Ain't math fun?"", '\\[Edit\\]\n\nThis chart shows the probability distribution given a driver finishes in the top 10.   \nA distribution chart showing all resultant race positions skews both charts to the left, however the probability outcome for P(MV>=LN) remains the same.', 'Fancy maths to tell us Max will win again.', ""Agreed. We already have a fairly good idea of how Max and Lando have finished this race before. Granted, it is a different car every year. But might be interesting to use their predicted finishes based on previous years and then adjust the odds based on the percentage increase or decrease of both compared to prior years.\n\nBut I don't know statistics or probabilities, I'm just throwing stuff out there.""]",13,15,0.57,13,13,13,1,4,0.0,1
1p5uq5n,How do you rate drivers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5uq5n/how_do_you_rate_drivers/,2025-11-24, Discussion,"How do you rate drivers?

In F1 spaces, there's a pretty strong consensus over where each driver relatively ranks. This post was prompted by [this discussion post asking who would be closest Max in the second RBR seat](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5ftxx/which_driver_from_the_current_grid_would/), where there's a clear favorite answer (Charles) and then some runners-up (George, Fernando, and Lando a few times), which seems to be about the usual ranking.

But like...how do you guys know? I get that different drivers have demonstrated fantastic W2W skill or pace or raw speed, but these things are obviously affected by the car. When comparing drivers who have never been teammates, e.g. Russell vs. Leclerc, in your mind, how do you compensate for machinery? Like, I don't think I could say George *wouldn't* have done even better than Charles in the 2022 Ferrari, or that Charles wouldn't have more race wins than George in the 2025 Mercedes. 

I guess related: where does the consensus in the relative quality of cars come from? This season, with all the VCARB/RBR shenanigans, I've heard that the RBR has a higher ceiling but the VCARB is easier to drive. But based on what we know (everyone not Max has done better in the VCARB than the RBR), it seems equally possible that Verstappen is just car Jesus who  would have won the championship in the VCARB and the RBR without him would be a backmarker—not saying this is true or I believe it, but it doesn't necessarily seem *less* true than the current popular opinion.

I think the boring answer is that fans will naturally reach consensus (especially with new fans coming in and learning about past seasons via memes/stories) and that F1 is fundamentally not a sport where you can compare drivers like that, but I might be/probably am missing something. So how do you compare drivers and cars?","[""Vibes\n\nAnd consider how they're performing compared to their teammates, how consistent they are, and in relation to the team/car's recent performances.\n\nBut mostly vibes."", ""For that discussion post you linked, the reason Leclerc is mentioned is likely more because he and Verstappen like similarly slippery cars + have known each other for a long time so they're often associated together. \n\nIf we're rating based on skill, you'll never find a clear consensus on the 2nd best after Verstappen. There are people on here who 100% believe Leclerc, Russell, Norris, etc. are all bums - when in reality they just don't like them. Sports are inherently biased, that's part of the fun but also frustration when speaking to other fans."", ""This is Reddit, we rate drivers based on whether we like them or not.
