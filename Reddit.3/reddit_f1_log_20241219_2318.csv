In short, the day after the great launch event of the season in which all ten teams will take part, their respective Team Principals as well as the drivers and internationally famous guests to best celebrate the 75th anniversary of the World Championship. It is important to underline that in that event only the liveries of the various teams will be presented while for the new cars, those who want can do their own dedicated event as the Maranello team will do.\n\n\n\nVasseur: “I was very proud of the team’s reaction to the technical problems encountered” \n\n\nFerrari has had a three-faced season . A first part clearly as the second force with the aim of catching up with Red Bull, a more complicated middle part, as the third and even fourth force on the track after the introduction of the problematic floor in Spain, to then have a final part of the season (from Monza onwards) of a high level , managing to also play the role of first force in some appointments. “I think the approach this year has been very good. Even when we encountered difficulties in July, the team’s reaction was very good . We never blamed anyone or a department but we worked together to find solutions between the different groups and it certainly went well.” – Vasseur told the press present at the Christmas lunch in Maranello, including AutoRacer – “Of course, it would have been better not to have had problems, but I think the reaction was good and that is what we expect for the future if we want to fight for the championship.” \n\n\nAfter a period of great understanding, where Charles Leclerc was often sacrificed to collect useful data later in the factory in those analyses of unforeseen problems introduced with the package brought to Spain, the SF-24 is back competitive. ""I was very proud of the team\'s reaction this year, because a positive point of our season for me is when we struggled between the end of June and the beginning of July and we were able to react quickly, then showing good pace both in the race in Budapest and Spa."" Vasseur said. Let us remember that in Hungary what the French TP called \'evolved bottom\' had debuted, with the first artificial corrections made thanks to CFD analysis and without spending hours in the tunnel , to correct part of the problems encountered with the Montmelò package. ""This type of reaction will be fundamental for next year. It is true that now when you develop the car, sometimes you also take some risks by introducing updates, and it is something that has affected everyone, but it is the way you react in this situation that becomes fundamental, also for next year,” concluded Vasseur.\n\n\nFerrari Surprise: Vasseur Announces Less Than 1% of SF-24 Components Ported to 2025 Car\n\n\nThe Italian team has high expectations for the 2025 car because, as already underlined several times, it has invested a lot of technical resources , setting up a completely new project that sees changes in all the macro areas of the single-seater: from the chassis, therefore to the position of the driver and the engine, to the mechanics as well as the aerodynamic surfaces . “We are in the fourth year of application of this regulation and we know our previous project very well. For this reason the 2025 car will be completely new , ” announced Fred Vasseur during the Christmas lunch in Maranello .\n\n\nA calculated risk according to the team principal of the Italian team, even if with the current regulation “sometimes you have the feeling of not running any risks but then on the track you realize that there really were”. There will be important changes to the front , with the suspension that will become a pull-rod design, following the philosophy already used by McLaren and Red Bull. Linked to the important mechanical steps forward, the aerodynamic surfaces of the floor have also undergone a strong restyling since, as understood by AutoRacer , it will be quite different compared to the first spec 25 iteration seen on the track starting from Las Vegas s . Surprisingly, compared to the car that won 5 of the 24 races during the season just ended, 99% of the parts will change, given that Vasseur stated that the 2025 Ferrari will share “less than 1 percent of the current car”, for what is in effect a truly different project designed to try to win at least one of the two world championships available.', ""The rules from 2024 to 2025 are as stable as they get in F1, and literally everything will change for 2026, so redesigning the entire car for what will be the final year will either end up being an amazing hail mary to get Lewis or Charles a(nother) championship, or it'll fail spectacularly.

To better integrate into the Italian team, as well as Loic Serra himself, the English driver is taking Italian lessons and it was no coincidence that he expressed a few words in our language already in Abu Dhabi, while entering the Ferrari box. “99% of our work is in English but I think it is nice to know how to speak a little Italian for the mechanics and for the relationship within the team” – said Fred Vasseur in this regard, who then took care to underline also in a somewhat joking manner that “it is not essential for performance”. \n\n\nVasseur: “It wasn’t difficult to convince Hamilton that the Ferrari project was excellent”\n\n\nBetween the end of last year and the beginning of 2024 , the planets aligned to bring Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari. “I think sometimes it\'s also a question of coincidences and last year they were all there, that is, Lewis was on the market and Ferrari had a seat available.” – said the Ferrari TP at the traditional Christmas lunch in Maranello, who then wanted to focus on the arguments useful for convincing the seven-time world champion to accept the offer of the Italian team. “First of all, in 2023 we won more races than Mercedes. And the start of the season had also been good, so it wasn\'t too difficult to convince him that Ferrari would be a good project . And I think he had been thinking about driving for Ferrari for at least 20 years because we were already discussing it in 2004,” revealed the French manager.\n\n\nThe seven-time world champion will arrive at Ferrari after a very long experience in a team like Mercedes , quite different in its working methods and without that Niki Lauda who was fundamental initially and who made the environment within the Anglo-German team very special. “I am not sure that we have to do a copy and paste of what Mercedes did, where the environment worked very well at the beginning, a little less at the end.” – said Vasseur – “My objective in fact is not to do a copy and paste of what has been done in the past, or to try to attract all the people from Mercedes and to create a Mercedes team that have not been champions in the last two or three years, but to find the best way to manage Lewis differently with our team, with our guys and our resources”. \n\n\n\nVasseur believes that managing the Leclerc-Hamilton duo will be even easier than the Leclerc-Sainz duo \n\n\nMuch of the curiosity of the insiders during the next season will be to understand and see how Fred Vasseur will be able to manage the desire of Charles Leclerc to enter the history of Ferrari by winning his first world title and that of a seven-time world champion who would further enter the history of F1 by becoming the first driver to win 8 world championships, the last with a Ferrari that has not won it since the now distant 2007 (drivers). ""This year my challenge was to manage Charles and Carlos, but I think it was part of our performance because I am truly convinced that emulation in the team is the key to the performance of the entire team , "" said the French manager, who thinks in a way that is practically opposite to the Red Bull identity, where all the efforts are concentrated on the Verstappen side of the box. \n\n\n“We had a couple of heated moments between Charles and Carlos. Monza 2023 or even Las Vegas 2024 for example. But in the end, I think it was beneficial for the team’s performance .” – said Vasseur, who then wanted to explain how these sporting disagreements have never damaged the Scuderia in terms of points collected – “Managing Charles and Lewis? I’m not particularly worried, given that they have a huge mutual respect and know each other well. They have been talking about their future relationship for months now. And I think it’s much better to fight for the very first positions on the grid rather than fighting for the last and I think it’s a good problem for a team to have this type of discussion .

Before like 2014-16 no one cared about throwing a rookie into a top car. Then Hamilton and Rosberg happened and Red Bull started this driver program epidemic and all of a sudden there was this barrier of “we want an experienced driver in the top car and can use our junior team or a team we have a connection with to foster talent” (George at Williams, Leclerc at Alfa). But now I think they just don’t care anymore or see less value in having an established 1 driver with a steady 2nd that won’t challenge them. Red Bull lost all their good assets while Perez and Ricciardo were there. They’re in the rebuild of their young driver program kind of. Yuki clearly has a glass ceiling. Max is max. So you have two seats to fill that were blocked by old slow guys. Throw the young kids in there and see what happens. Same thing with Antonelli at Mercedes.

My point is that all these arguments about Honda links tying down Yuki are unfounded hogwash used to justify not hiring the better VCARB driver.

I mean sure he's lovable but is that enough to get the RB seat? Feels more like a train everyone had boarded, logic be darned. Not saying he's a bad driver or that he doesn't deserve the seat, as he did his time but Lawson just makes way more sense.

Trial by fire because the grid in 2025 is going to be tight. That's the RBR way, feels like a return to old ways. Lawson is going to have to be up to the task, swim or sink. If he swims they'll have a good partnership for 2026. If he sinks, they'll get another, more experienced driver off the market for 2026.

Also Yuki's contract has one more year on it, Honda and their weird decision (again) to leave F1 hurt Yuki more than anything. Getting Yuki, they'd have to get a fresh driver for 2026, an year of unknowns. Better to have someone next to Max that has had some lashes of the whip that is going to be 2025.

Other than the one incident at the beginning of the year he’s remained calm and consistent since. He’s also consistently outperformed every teammate he’s had.

Yes. Is he an immediate WDC contender that can challenge Max? We can quite confidently say no. Not able to beat an experienced driver like Yuki does not mean he is bad, but it proves he doesn’t show his potential yet. For this type of driver, there is no rush to promote him, and giving him time to develop in the junior team is the best scenario to shape him into a reliable rear gunner. Why can’t he do that in RBR? To my opinion, RBR is not really a team for development. Their patience is thin, and they expect him to perform immediately, in a car that in 2024 even Max said sometimes it is not easy to drive. The constant pressure to a driver who only drove 11 races is a lot. Lawson could navigate it very well, and that means he will be with Max long term. If it doesn’t go well, RBR WCC position takes another hit with only one driver delivering for the team again. Fast tracking Lawson could setback his career development.\n\nDo I support RBR to promote Yuki because he deserves it? No. Do I expect he would be competitive against Max? No. Do I think he could contribute more than Lawson in the immediate term? To some extent, Yes. Yuki is objectively more ready to take the RBR seat within the RB stable, given his performance and also experience, and also let Lawson to develop more. If he is really really good, RBR can keep him until they see the next Max regardless of the Honda deal. Honda was clear thst they will support Yuki even he is not driving with their engines. If he is not good, RBR wants to sack him anyway, there are no harms.\n\nThe only reason for RBR to pick Lawson over Yuki now is if they think Lawson will perform better immediately in 2025 alongside Max which I am not convinced. I am more inclined to say RBR wants to burn through their Junior drivers until they have Linblad ready to drive for RBR. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.', 'I mean I think one of the biggest arguments is that because Yuki would be out 2026, there’s no harm in putting him in for 2025. If he sucks then they can drop him anyways. And having Liam in vcarb gives him more time and experience to develop as a driver without the harm of having max as your teammate. It was a win win.', 'Its not ""Yuki Bias""... \n\nI saw it the other way, It is more like Tsunoda ""hate"" are more strange because people stuck in the past... Calling him hot headed, slower than Lawson (by data he was faster), and only focused on Ricciardo or Lawson\n\nPeople demand performance, when Tsunoda deliver vs RIC-DEV-LAW they close their eyes\n\nPeople demand less swearing, when Lawson flip the bird, people close their eyes\n\nSo actually, The bias on social media is againts Tsunoda, and because of that those who really watch Tsunoda progression actually hoped he went to RBR', 'He’s beaten every teammate he’s had since Gasly left, and Lawson doesn’t even have a full season in F1 under his belt.', 'Do you think Gasly would do much better in the red bull next to Max now then when he got the seat? What about Albon? Maybe you should let drivers develop before dumping them in the seat. Even Max had more time at Torro Rosso (and showed way more)', ""If anyone from their Jr program who truly deserves that seat is Carlos. But they didn't sign him for whatever reason. Now it's like meh"", 'It’s the one sided promise other drivers get “beat Yuki and get the Redbull seat” which ended up being “get close to Yuki and get the Redbull seat” after it couldn’t be done. while there was no reciprocal deal for Yuki. That’s bias.']",0,96,0.39,0,506,506,0,0,0.0,0
1hhpk72,Why do people think Tsunoda over Lawson. Tsunoda is a Honda driver.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhpk72/why_do_people_think_tsunoda_over_lawson_tsunoda/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"TL;DR - Tsunoda is a Honda driver, not an RB one.

Liam Lawson was the obvious choice surely? Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he’s probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026 following either Alonso’s retirement or then finally dropping Stroll. I know he’s had a large majority of his career with the RB family but he’s only there thanks to Honda supplying the engine.

Knowing this, Red Bull don’t want someone who’ll be there for a year then leave, they want someone young to potentially be Verstappen’s successor (Ricciardo to Vettel).

With Hadjar most likely getting the vacant VCARB spot, if Lawson pulls a Gasly, I can see RB going for Hadjar instead of Tsunoda too. 

No shade on Yuki, on his day he can be amazing. I just don’t think Red Bull will want to waste time and money on a driver they know won’t be there next year.","['Alonso has a contract 2026 and stroll has an infinite contract, there is no space for him at Aston?!', '> Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he’s probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026\n\nWell, no, because why would he do that if he has a race-winning car?', ""Tsunoda getting into F1 with Honda does not at all mean he has to stay with them several years after the fact. It's such a weird idea that this would be the case, when for all other drivers we are open to movement between teams according to their performance. Especially since Tsunoda *also* has been a driver for a Red Bull team even if he didn't come from their junior program. If Tsunoda performed better than Lawson it would be very natural to give him an offer to drive in the Red Bull car."", ""The biggest reason is experience. Maybe people wouldn't be as hesitant about Lawson being promoted if he had more than 11 GP under his belt, like a full season or 2. Though that didn't help Gasly. \n\nBoth would probably falter alongside Max Verstappen, very few can probably keep up with him honestly, I just hope he can do better than Perez.\n\nAlso being a Honda driver shouldn't mean squat."", 'If you think Alonso will retire before the 2026 season where there is a new set of regulations and an Adrian Newey designed car you are insane!', ""Because Tsunoda is better and if offered would jump at the chance. Also I'm sure if needed he'd happily break the Honda link if it meant getting the chance to win races."", ""I don't even think its about Honda. Red Bull have the power to buy Yuki away from Honda and make him a Red Bull driver. \n\nThey just think that he has reaches his ceiling and that this is his pace. Clearly it isn't enough. They see Lawson holding his own against Yuki despite much less experience and are willing to take the slim chance that Lawson will grow much further into a driver that can support Max. \n\nThe choice between Yuki and Liam was one where Yuki would have definitely struggled and one where Liam will struggle at the start but may grow."", 'There is no way Lawrence Stroll is replacing a 2x world champion with Yuki Tsunoda. There is a pattern there. He is going after a top driver once Alonso retires.', 'For the reason you stated Yuki is a Honda driver promote him let Max destroy him and then get rid of him next year if that’s what happens, alternatively he impresses and you make him a RB driver not a Honda one. Let Lawson and Hadjar find their feat at racing bulls and promote the better looking option in 2026. Nothing I’ve seen of Liam right now makes me think he would be superior to Yuki in the RB seat.']",0,65,0.27,0,305,305,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
