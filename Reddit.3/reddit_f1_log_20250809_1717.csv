Can I draw it and explain it to you in a computer? Because here just speaking about it obviously I’m not going to go into detail but it’s completely different,” he told media including Motorsport Week.\n\n“The way you use the gears, the downshift and how it goes into engine braking, the transition from the brake migration to the engine braking is different.

As a reminder, he rated them as follows:

Kimi Antonelli: “He is clearly an elite driver, although he is under enormous pressure. His performance is impressive: he has already driven around 10,000 test kilometres, but he has also had two serious accidents. You can feel the pressure on him. And, of course, Toto Wolff wants to repeat the Verstappen story at Mercedes. However, going straight to an elite team will be a challenge for him. But in terms of potential, he is certainly a top driver.”

Oliver Bearman: “He is a very fast driver, although he had a lot of accidents in Formula 2 and Formula 3 because he takes big risks. He goes to the limit. Maybe he won’t get to the top as fast as Antonelli, but he’s definitely a standout.”

Isack Hadjar: “Hadjar lost the championship by only four or five points [sic]. Our data analysts calculated that he lost about 80 points due to technical failures and other problems. So he is very fast. I would say that if he continues to develop well and learn to control his emotions, he has A-level potential as well.”

Gabriel Bortoleto: “I would classify him as a ‘B’ driver. He’s a very intelligent driver: he won the Formula 3 championship, but with only one win and he usually stays out of trouble. In Formula 2 he only managed two victories. He is a driver who brings the car home safely, has a good command of strategy and tyre management, but I don’t see that pure speed in him.”

Jack Doohan: “He is a ‘C’. I don’t think he will complete the season.”

They’re fairly detailed, which is why I think they warrant a bit of discussion now we’ve seen races from them all.

1ml10j4,How does the dirty air and downforce mechanic effect wet racing ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ml10j4/how_does_the_dirty_air_and_downforce_mechanic/,2025-08-08, Discussion,"As you all know we can’t really see much racing in F1 in ground effect era. They usually get red flagged due to visibility and safety issues. But I remember/know them being much less frequent in previous eras. But how do they affect it ? 

I know that Pirelli tried and tested using tyre arches to reduces spray but I’ve also read that they weren’t as successful as they want it to be and the main issue was the floor. But I don’t really know how that works since I’m not educated in technical areas. 

While I was looking for some answers I found out that the dirty air mechanic changed quite a bit (and also loopholes are exploited) and they’re the reason but there weren’t any explanations that I coul find. Can anyone explain it please 

  
TL,DR : I don‘t know how ground effect floor effects wet racing and couldn’t find any explanation and I’m asking here for one 

  
Thanks ","['The main issue with wet racing is the spray that is generated. This is worse the further back you are - P1 only has the safety car’s spray coming up in front of them, P20 has the safety car and 19 other cars in front of them.\n\nThe ground effect works like an upside down airplane. The car is sucked down onto the floor which helps push the wheels into the ground and means it propels the car forwards more effectively and that steering is more effective. However, when it’s raining, the ground effect sucking the car onto the floor pushes more spray up from the floor in turn. So if we took a 2021 car and a 2025 car, and had them drive around a wet track, the 2025 car would generate more spray.\n\nIf the drivers can’t see, it’s not safe to race. Look at Hadjar on Antonelli in Silverstone, Hadjar couldn’t see Antonelli’s taillights through the spray until he was in the back of him.', 'Ground effect cars generate downforce by creating a low pressure region beneath the car. The basic idea works like this:\n\nAs the engine propels the car forward, air enters the area beneath the floor. This air is accelerated as it flows through the underside of the car. The acceleration is typically achieved by narrowing the space between the car and the ground. This is often done using Venturi tunnels, if you are interested in the specific shapes that help accelerate the flow.\n\nAs the air speeds up, its pressure drops. This follows directly from Bernoulli’s principle.\n\nWith lower pressure beneath the car and higher pressure above it, the car is effectively pushed downward. The air above forces the car toward the ground. This is what creates downforce. The car is quite literally pressed into the track by atmospheric pressure because of the lower pressure underneath.\n\nOnce the minimum pressure is reached under the car, the air must gradually return to atmospheric pressure. This process is called diffusion. Diffusion increases the pressure while slowing the air back down.\n\nFor ground effect to work effectively, large volumes of air need to be moved through the Venturi tunnels and then expanded in the diffuser. On a wet track, this means a lot of water on the surface gets sucked in, accelerated through the tunnels, and ultimately expelled out of the rear of the car.\n\nPrevious generations of cars relied more heavily on front and rear wings to generate downforce. As a result, they did not pick up as much water from the track surface — only the spray from the tires. That still happens with current cars, but now the ground effect system adds significantly more spray from the underbody.', 'Also to note inters and wets have a larger diameter than slicks so that raises the cars ride height and decreases the DF generated by the floor.', 'More than anything to do with the aerodynamics, F1 became a lot more conservative about racing in the rain after Jules Bianchi died when they were literally racing in a typhoon.', 'Not really 100% related, but the ground effect cars have been pretty poor in the dry and wet. The floors are essentially vacuuming up water and spraying it out of the diffuser in the rear. \n\nMany things have masked how poor the 2022 regs have been. 2023 was a snooze fest, 2022 was only exciting because Ferrari pulled a 2017 and acted like they could actually win, 2024 was only exciting because Horny and Newey had a falling out and the car started getting slower, and 2025 has been a competition of who can do more laps on the medium in clean air.', 'To see the practical results, see the 1998 Belgian GP', 'In very short: older cars generated spray from the tyres. Ground effect cars generate spray from the whole floor.\n\n\nThere simply is much much more spray these days. Silver lining is that of it stopped raining, it only takes half dozen of laps to dry the track.', 'thanks']",104,27,0.87,104,234,234,0,1,0.0,0

Yeah, let's not incentivize that kinda shit."", "">I think reciprocal points for finishing position is the best, i.e. 1st gets 1 point, 2nd gets 1/2 of a point, 3rd gets 1/3 of a point down to the last finisher or driver classified.\n\n>The problem with the linear points is that it's unfair because top teams and drivers will be disproportionately affected by DNFs or random accidents (..) since the only way to catch up is hope the other driver DNFs or to not DNF.\n\nReciprocal points have basically the same problem you describe as linear ones, but instead of the top being the most affected, it's the ones from about P5 downwards."", ""People intrinsically value the higher positions more so the points system accounts for that. If they are in P13 and P14 then DNFs would have a bigger impact but not many people care about those positions anyways and it's easier to make up with a P4-6 or better for midfielders.

1mljh6z,is Aston Martin's potential being hidden by its drivers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mljh6z/is_aston_martins_potential_being_hidden_by_its/,2025-08-09, Discussion,"Lance Stroll is not without his qualities - particularly in wet races - but it's pretty clear that he's not a top quality driver and is only got the seat because of his father. If he was the only driver at Aston Martin, we would have great difficulty in assessing how good the car actually was. but one of Stroll's biggest defenders is Fernando Alonso, and I don't think that's a coincidence. Stroll makes Alonso look good. Alonso is able to consistently outperform his team mate (at least on track position) and so looks like he's doing a decent job, but I seriously doubt that Alonso is the same driver he was 20 years ago. In short, Aston Martin have two seriously below par drivers. Could it be possible that the current AM car is much better than anyone has suspected? With Adrian Newey on board, it would be interesting if Verstappen were to jump ship and join him","['We’ve truly hit the summer break, folks.', ""Of course Alonso isn't as good as he was 20 years ago. But they doesn't mean he's a bad driver.\n\n\nAnd it's ridiculous and without evidence to suggest that he only defends Stroll to make himself look good.\n\n\nAston isn't secretly sitting on a championship winning car."", 'Or maybe Alonso defends him because he’s the son of his boss?', "">Stroll makes Alonso look good\n\nIf you are not a new fan, you know how good Alonso really is, he's up there with Lewis and Max. He's not the same as 20 years ago, but he's still better than midfield drivers. I'd say he's similar to Lewis now, they are at the end of their career, a bit slower than the top guys, but they are consistent and still better than 80% of the grid. Put Alonso or Lewis to any midfield team and I'm 100% sure they will score more points than their teammate"", ""It'll be interesting to see where they'll be next year, with Neweys designs and all."", 'Of all the teams to do this with Aston is not one imo. Alonso is still a top ten on the grid at least.\xa0\n\nSauber and particularly Racing Bulls are much bigger cases of this.\xa0', ""Stroll's not as bad as people make him out to be."", 'Without any sort of data point, this is purely vibes based. And no, i dont think theres some hidden pocket of performance in the aston martin. \n\nAlonso is not the same driver he was 20 years, that much is true, but to imply that Alonso regressed enough that he cannot extract the performance out of a midfield/sometimes backmarker car is just... highly unlikely.']",0,99,0.31,0,89,89,0,9,0.010000000000000009,0
