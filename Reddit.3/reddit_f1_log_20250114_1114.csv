1i0hqd2,What are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i0hqd2/what_are_some_races_where_an_unlikely_cardriver/,2025-01-13, Discussion,"F1 isn't a stranger to unlikely race winners nor the unlikely cars/drivers that ""almost"" won a race. Most recently, Esteban Ocon in last year's Sao Paulo GP took advantage of the red flag and led until the 2nd safety car restart where Max Verstappen overtook him en route to a famous victory. 

However, I recently rewatched the 2012 Italian GP, a race most famous for Lewis Hamilton's final pole-to-win with McLaren and Fernando Alonso's podium extending his championship lead to 37 points, including 39 points over Sebastian Vettel who retired in the closing stages. What also stood out was Sergio Perez, who ran an off-set strategy by starting on the hards, finished 2nd and just 4.4 seconds off the lead despite starting from 12th and had a great chance at challenging for the win if he qualified well enough (his teammate Kamui Kobayashi qualified and started from 8th).

This drive by Perez in Monza is certainly much less remembered than Perez's drive in Malaysia the same season where in changing conditions he rapidly closed down on Fernando Alonso, cutting the lead to 0.5 seconds and eventually finishing a memorable 2nd place, with just 2.3 seconds off the lead.

So like this, what are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public?

The Finn maintains that the current world champion, in addition to being an immensely talented driver, is very tough in wheel-to-wheel battles. He leaves hardly any room, and his rival must understand that Verstappen will not be the first to lift his foot off the accelerator.\n\n>Although Bottas hasn’t had the opportunity to fight Max over the past three years, during his seasons with Mercedes, he did go head-to-head on the track with the reigning world champion. They are two very different drivers, and especially in close combat—where Verstappen usually makes the difference—Bottas has struggled the most.\n\n>Bottas is well aware that Verstappen will never make things easy. He is always an aggressive driver, as his rivals in recent years have experienced. On top of that, he now has top-tier consistency, having eliminated the mistakes that were characteristic of his earlier years competing at the top level in Formula 1.\n\n>“It’s tough to fight against him. He leaves no space, and you know he’ll never back off. Everyone knows that when racing against him. Max is a very consistent driver who no longer makes mistakes, unlike when he started his career—but that’s natural. Now he’s in his prime,” Bottas acknowledged in comments published on the Racing News 365 website.\n\n>“He’s very fast, talented, and now he has the experience and confidence as well. This makes him a really tough driver to beat. It’s clear that in the future, he’ll also need a good car, as we’ve seen this year with many different winners,” he added.\n\n>When asked if Verstappen’s unwillingness to yield is his greatest strength, Bottas believes it is, but that doesn’t mean it’s his only one. The Finn highlights Verstappen’s consistency and regularity, which allow him to perform exceptionally in qualifying and race smartly every weekend. This has led him to win four consecutive titles, though securing a fifth this year won’t be an easy task.\n\n>“Probably, and his consistency too.

The Finn argues that the reigning world champion, in addition to being an immensely talented driver, is very tough in close combat. He leaves hardly any space and his rival must be aware that he won\'t be the first to lift off the throttle.  \n  \nAlthough in the last three years Bottas has never had the chance to fight with Max, during his seasons at Mercedes, he did face the current world champion on track. They are two very different drivers and especially in close combat, where Verstappen has usually made the difference, is where Valtteri has suffered the most.  \n  \nBottas is aware that Verstappen will never make it easy for him. He will always be an aggressive driver and his rivals in recent years have experienced that. In addition to that, he has a first-class consistency, with which he has eliminated the mistakes that characterized him so much in his early years fighting at the top of Formula 1.  \n  \n""It\'s tough to battle with him. He leaves no space and you know he\'s never going to lift off the throttle. Everyone knows that when they race against him. Max is a very consistent driver, who no longer makes any mistakes, unlike when he started his career, but it\'s natural. Now he\'s in his prime,"" Bottas acknowledged in words published by the Racing News 365 website.  \n  \n""He\'s very fast, talented and now he has the experience and confidence as well. This makes him a really tough driver to beat. It\'s clear that in the future he will also need a good car and we\'ve already seen that this year, with many different winners,"" he adds.\nAsked if that ability to never give up is Max\'s greatest virtue, Bottas believes it is, but that doesn\'t mean he doesn\'t have more. The Finn underlines the consistency and regularity he has to go fast in qualifying and race intelligently every weekend. That has led him to win four consecutive titles, although taking the fifth this year will not be easy.  \n  \n""Probably, and the consistency. In any scenario, he is capable of doing a perfect lap and his racing ability is also tremendous, he is always very intelligent. In general, he is a very complete driver and for that reason he has already won so many titles in Formula 1,"" Bottas concluded.', 'This year Norris had a great option to make his mark, every time Verstappen and Norris fought, Norris should not stand down, but leave just enough space for them both, and if Verstappen would crash, there would be a crash.\n\nIn a few races, when Leclerc would close the gap as Verstappen title chance would start slipping away, Verstappen would start giving enough space for both cars.\n\nHowever as Norris is not championship material, the next year will be the same.', ""Ask Magnussen, Perez and Verstappen what it's like going wheel to wheel with Bottas when Bottas goes bowling or misses the braking zone by seconds and the apex by multiple car widths and drives straight into the side of his opponents."", 'Wow an absolute huge, wild and insightful take from the eternal genius Sir Valtteri of Bottas.\n\n\nPut him back in one of the cars he simply cannot be reserve forever.', 'So standard modern “journalism” then', ""> unlike when he started his career\n\nInteresting from Verstappen a couple of years ago that he thinks 2020 was the season he finally put it all together and was 'ready' for a title-winning car. \n\nMark on the race podcast is pretty consistent that Verstappen in the RBR is a clear cut above everyone now, without exception.\n\nAs he says: Verstappen has literally no weaknesses, and anyone who'll beat him to the title will need *some* degree of car advantage.\n\nWe don't really talk about Verstappen in GOAT discussions, I guess just because he's still totting numbers anyway (even though they're just one aspect).

1i1390j,Jordan's 2000 Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i1390j/jordans_2000_season/,2025-01-14, Discussion,"I'm rewatching the 2000 season at the moment and Jordan's season has peaked my interest. After the heroics of 1999, where the team was punching well above it's weight, Jordan set out to solidify themselves as a top team in 2000. They signed fast Jarno Trulli to replace the demotivated (and retiring) Hill and it was expected that both Jordans could fight at the sharp end of the field. 
In reality, we know how it went. Jordan had a hugely disappointing season, even failing to clinch third in the constructor's championship. This led to the competition with BAR over the factory Honda engines in 2001, putting the team under additional pressure. Jordan declined each year, became a proper backmarker by 2004 and Eddie sold the team. 

But rewatching the 2000 season, Jordan's year is remembered far worse than it was, focusing on pace alone. The Jordan was, over the balance of the season, the third fastest car slightly ahead of the Williams. It achieved front row starts and was a regular top 6 qualifier. Jordan had several races where they ran up front just behind the McLaren's and Ferrari's, on some occasions even splitting them (Australia after both McLaren's retired, Monaco where Trulli ran in P2 for the first half of the race). They were semi-regularly on course for additional podium finishes (both in Australia, Frentzen in Great Britain, Trulli in Monaco, Trulli in Germany and Belgium). Pace-wise the EJ10 (and its B-Spec) wasn't much worse than the 199 from the previous year. 

But it was woefully unreliable. The Jordans finished only 15 out of a possible 34 times and more often than not, they retired in points-paying, sometimes even podium positions. This helped Williams, who were a tad slower overall but much more reliable to achieve third in the constructor's. I personally think if Jordan sacrificed just a bit of speed for more reliability, the car still would have been fast enough to clinch third in the constructor's with something around 40-45 points. They still wouldn't have solidified themselves as a top team, but the outlook for 2001 and beyond would have been much better. Clearly ahead of BAR, no direct competition with them for the Honda works engines, more resources to focus on fine tuning the package.

In a way I think the 2000 season shaped the future and eventual downfall of Jordan. I'd like to know the opinions of others on this. Would a better 2000 have helped Jordan to stay afloat much longer?

Tl;dr Would a more reliable car in 2000 that would have got third in the constructor's have helped Jordan longer term to stay in F1 for longer?","[""I don't think it would have made much of a difference in terms of longevity. This was the era where privateers were basically being priced out as manufacturers flooded in. Best case for them is that Honda stays with them and dumps BAR which means they get bought by Honda in 2005 instead."", ""All those big manufacturers coming into F1 certainly was a major contributing factor in Jordan's demise. Do you think a better 2000 would have enabled Jordan to at least remain a solid midfield team until they would be eventually bought out? Or could you imagine a Sauber-Like scenario where they would be bought by e.g. Honda and when Honda pulls out in 2008/2009 they would revert back to Jordan?""]",6,3,0.88,6,2,2,6,3,0.88,6
