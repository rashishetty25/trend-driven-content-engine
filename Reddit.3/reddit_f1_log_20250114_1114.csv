1i0hqd2,What are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i0hqd2/what_are_some_races_where_an_unlikely_cardriver/,2025-01-13, Discussion,"F1 isn't a stranger to unlikely race winners nor the unlikely cars/drivers that ""almost"" won a race. Most recently, Esteban Ocon in last year's Sao Paulo GP took advantage of the red flag and led until the 2nd safety car restart where Max Verstappen overtook him en route to a famous victory. 

However, I recently rewatched the 2012 Italian GP, a race most famous for Lewis Hamilton's final pole-to-win with McLaren and Fernando Alonso's podium extending his championship lead to 37 points, including 39 points over Sebastian Vettel who retired in the closing stages. What also stood out was Sergio Perez, who ran an off-set strategy by starting on the hards, finished 2nd and just 4.4 seconds off the lead despite starting from 12th and had a great chance at challenging for the win if he qualified well enough (his teammate Kamui Kobayashi qualified and started from 8th).

This drive by Perez in Monza is certainly much less remembered than Perez's drive in Malaysia the same season where in changing conditions he rapidly closed down on Fernando Alonso, cutting the lead to 0.5 seconds and eventually finishing a memorable 2nd place, with just 2.3 seconds off the lead.

So like this, what are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public?

They are two very different drivers, and especially in close combat‚Äîwhere Verstappen usually makes the difference‚ÄîBottas has struggled the most.\n\n>Bottas is well aware that Verstappen will never make things easy. He is always an aggressive driver, as his rivals in recent years have experienced. On top of that, he now has top-tier consistency, having eliminated the mistakes that were characteristic of his earlier years competing at the top level in Formula 1.\n\n>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough to fight against him. He leaves no space, and you know he‚Äôll never back off. Everyone knows that when racing against him. Max is a very consistent driver who no longer makes mistakes, unlike when he started his career‚Äîbut that‚Äôs natural.

He will always be an aggressive driver and his rivals in recent years have experienced that. In addition to that, he has a first-class consistency, with which he has eliminated the mistakes that characterized him so much in his early years fighting at the top of Formula 1.  \n  \n""It\'s tough to battle with him. He leaves no space and you know he\'s never going to lift off the throttle. Everyone knows that when they race against him.

1i1390j,Jordan's 2000 Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i1390j/jordans_2000_season/,2025-01-14, Discussion,"I'm rewatching the 2000 season at the moment and Jordan's season has peaked my interest. After the heroics of 1999, where the team was punching well above it's weight, Jordan set out to solidify themselves as a top team in 2000. They signed fast Jarno Trulli to replace the demotivated (and retiring) Hill and it was expected that both Jordans could fight at the sharp end of the field. 
In reality, we know how it went. Jordan had a hugely disappointing season, even failing to clinch third in the constructor's championship. This led to the competition with BAR over the factory Honda engines in 2001, putting the team under additional pressure. Jordan declined each year, became a proper backmarker by 2004 and Eddie sold the team. 

But rewatching the 2000 season, Jordan's year is remembered far worse than it was, focusing on pace alone. The Jordan was, over the balance of the season, the third fastest car slightly ahead of the Williams. It achieved front row starts and was a regular top 6 qualifier. Jordan had several races where they ran up front just behind the McLaren's and Ferrari's, on some occasions even splitting them (Australia after both McLaren's retired, Monaco where Trulli ran in P2 for the first half of the race). They were semi-regularly on course for additional podium finishes (both in Australia, Frentzen in Great Britain, Trulli in Monaco, Trulli in Germany and Belgium). Pace-wise the EJ10 (and its B-Spec) wasn't much worse than the 199 from the previous year. 

But it was woefully unreliable. The Jordans finished only 15 out of a possible 34 times and more often than not, they retired in points-paying, sometimes even podium positions. This helped Williams, who were a tad slower overall but much more reliable to achieve third in the constructor's. I personally think if Jordan sacrificed just a bit of speed for more reliability, the car still would have been fast enough to clinch third in the constructor's with something around 40-45 points. They still wouldn't have solidified themselves as a top team, but the outlook for 2001 and beyond would have been much better. Clearly ahead of BAR, no direct competition with them for the Honda works engines, more resources to focus on fine tuning the package.

In a way I think the 2000 season shaped the future and eventual downfall of Jordan. I'd like to know the opinions of others on this. Would a better 2000 have helped Jordan to stay afloat much longer?

Tl;dr Would a more reliable car in 2000 that would have got third in the constructor's have helped Jordan longer term to stay in F1 for longer?","[""I don't think it would have made much of a difference in terms of longevity. This was the era where privateers were basically being priced out as manufacturers flooded in. Best case for them is that Honda stays with them and dumps BAR which means they get bought by Honda in 2005 instead."", ""All those big manufacturers coming into F1 certainly was a major contributing factor in Jordan's demise. Do you think a better 2000 would have enabled Jordan to at least remain a solid midfield team until they would be eventually bought out? Or could you imagine a Sauber-Like scenario where they would be bought by e.g. Honda and when Honda pulls out in 2008/2009 they would revert back to Jordan?""]",6,3,0.88,6,2,2,6,3,0.88,6
