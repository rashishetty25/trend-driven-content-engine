But in the Kimi - Charles scenario, Charles is absolutely done. There is nothing that he can do to overturn the bad luck.

It happened on Sunday, June 9, 1957. Car races were also held on the dune circuit that day. In one of them, Willem Adriaan Gerlach, a doctor from the village Appelscha, started in his Porsche 1600 S. Shortly before the end of the race, however, he lost control of the car in the first corner after the Tarzan corner. The car rolled over three times and, according to a journalist from the Leeuwarder Courant, ended up in a potato field.  
  
Gerlach was thrown from the car. Unconscious, the driver was taken to the Sint Elisabethgasthuis hospital in Haarlem. There, his condition proved so serious that he died of his injuries that night.  
  
Gerlach was 47 years old. He had run a general practice in Appelscha since 1940, also serving residents of Fochteloo and Zorgvlied. He left behind a wife and three children. The bend where the fatal accident occurred was later named the Gerlach corner.  
  
The accompanying photo of Gerlach's crashed car appeared in several newspapers on Tuesday, June 11, 1957,
