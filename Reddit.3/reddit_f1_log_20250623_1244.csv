He competed next to Liam Lawson at RB and battled with Doohan and won F3 and an Italian F4 championship. Did he just not do well in F2 that caused him not to get promoted while Doohan and Lawson both made it?

He‚Äôs absolutely killing here stateside but just wonder if anyone has more insight into him. ","['in f2 he was:  \n2022:10  \n2023:8  \n2024:11', ""A mix of many things.\n\n\nHe was lacking a tiny bit of consistency in F2, he was quick but never the quickest, he got unlucky and never managed to step up to be a title contender.\n\n\nHe's absolutely destroying the Indy NXT grid this year and it's not even close, he would have won every single race if didn't get screwed in Indianapolis. I have no doubt he's going to receive offers for an IndyCar drive after this season if not before.\n\nI hope he can find some success there."", 'Basically, yeah. His 2021 F3 title win boosted his stock by a lot, and he was signed with Prema for F2 in 2022, who had won both the 2020 and 2021 titles on the spin, with Mick Schumacher and Oscar Piastri respectively, so expectations of him were high.\n\nDespite taking 2 wins that season, he summarily underwhelmed that season, finishing behind his teammate in the standings, in 10th place.\n\nRed Bull would keep him in their junior team for 2023, and he moved to MP Motorsport, who won the 2022 title with Felipe Drugovich.\n\n2023 was assumed to be his title contention year, and it did start out decently, but he fell away as the season progressed, finishing 8th, an improvement in position, but still not enough, and so he was dropped from the Red Bull Junior Team.\n\nHis shot at F1 pretty much gone, he stayed in F2 with MP, taking a final win, before bowing out and heading stateside, where he appears to be making a good go of things.\n\nI wish him nothing but the best', ""He had what I think is a pretty decent junior career up until he got in to F2. He definitely did have quite a number of unlucky moments but also didn't seem to be able to get grips on the car. Hence why he finished down the order compared to previous categories, whilst competitors moved up the ranks."", ""f2 is important, even winning in your 3rd season isn't enough a lot of the time, and he wasn't even top 5 in any of his F2 seasons"", ""He's very similar to Vips. Both came into F2 with a ton of hype, but were never able to live up to it. Some very good results hampered by inconsistency and bad luck. His main issue I feel was his qualifying form. More often than not he was in the back rows, which made him very vulnerable to the chaos that's inherent in F2."", ""You have to look at the relative experience and results of the IndyNXT field as well.\n\nHauger comes in to the best team in the series, Andretti have one at least (if not all 3) out of driver champion, team champion or rookie of the year in every single season since 2017 in IndyNXT.  \nHe brings with him the experience of 177 race-starts in F4, F3 and F2 (and some 30 races outside of that).  \nHis closest competitor so far is Lochie Hughes, who had less than 100 race starts before this season, but he also did no racing in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid.\n\nOther notable things to notice in the field. Josh Pierson, ended up last of all full-time IndyNXT drivers last year (driving for the only team other than Andretti to have won a title during the last 5-6 seasons). He has suddenly stabilized around top 5.  \nNiels Koolen who in a full season for Van Amersfoort (which is far from a bad team) in Formula Regional Europe and Middle East. In addition to some races in Italian F4 and Eurocup-3 (this is the championship where Tsanapol Inthraphuvasak was a genuine podium contender) and a few races in F2 managed the total of 0 points. Not only that out of those 47 races, he got 13 top-20 (so 20th and better). Though, Eurocup-3 had less than 20 drivers, and F2 had 22. So a top 20 there isn't really an achievement.  \nKoolen managed his first ever top 10 in formula cars in IndyNXT last year.  \nHowever, this year he has qualified in the top 10 on merit, have had several top 10s and are currently in the top 10 in the championship.\n\nEven as a Norwegian, I am struggling a tiny bit to get hyped, as it feels like the field is... healthy in terms of number of cars, but not exactly high level. When Niels Koolen and Jack Miller is actual top 10 contenders, then it worries me :P"", 'He (and also Doohan whilst he was there) never really seemed to be that highly regarded by Red Bull. He lost full his full academy backing after his disappointing first F3 season, regained it once he won the championship but then struggled in F2 due to various reasons (not seeming to click properly with the car, luck, consistency, etc). Lawson in comparison was always held in higher regard by Red Bull.\n\nI think a lot of us who‚Äôve watched him over the past few years have felt he was a driver who just wasn‚Äôt quite good enough for F1 but is good enough to have a decent career basically anywhere else. He‚Äôs clearly a level above the others on the NXT grid, looking forward to seeing what he can do in Indycar when the time comes.', 'Goes to show how important F2 is.

Crazy', ""Dorilton wanting an American driver is the main reason why they overlooked many talented drivers.\n\nDe Vries talked about it a bit in a podcast that he actually wanted to sign for Williams and Jost Capito was eager to sign him too, however Dorilton wanted to wait and see if Sargeant could get a SL instead. Which is why he preferred the AT seat as didn't have to wait.\n\nThen once they had Sargeant it was whoever could pay for the seat. I think Drugovich was a serious contender for the seat in 24 but he couldn't cough up the money, so they stuck with Logan. \n\nSo I'd imagine for Palou its very likely he was on the list. But with the caveat that he'd need to bring a load of money to offset Dorilton's need for an American driver. Given he costs money, there was really no chance"", 'Wouldn\'t put too much stock into being ""on the list"", as that\'s just the polite thing to say about a driver you didn\'t sign.\n\nPretty interesting tho that Vowles compares Palou to rookies like Kimi and Bearman and says he would have needed a full year of preparation before driving an F1 car.', 'Vowles said all of this publicly. the article didnt make it up.', 'Williams probably wouldn‚Äôt be interested in him either, so the feeling‚Äôs probably mutual. There is some real talent in indycar, but it‚Äôs usually where F1 rejects go, not the other way around', "">So I'd imagine for Palou its very likely he was on the list.

Last time I've heard, they're still fighting about it at the court."", 'I think hes saying that because of the price. He put Colapinto in the car with no experience but if you invest a lot more money into a driver, youd probably want to maximize that return by preparing properly', 'well yeah, vowles was asked ""why didn\'t you sign palou?"", and vowles essentially answered ""as if it wasn\'t painfully obvious, out of the billion reasons why we didn\'t sign him here are some of the most PR friendly ones""']",0,21,0.29,0,191,191,0,1,0.009999999999999953,0
