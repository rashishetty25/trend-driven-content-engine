In 1974 he became the leader of the team after the death of Peter Revson, and he was able to get a podium (3rd) on the Monaco Grand Prix. In 1975, he started the season by being on pole on the first two races, it looked promising for Shadow, but he DNS'd on Argentina amd retired in Brazil due to a mechanical failure while standing strong in the lead (27 laps led in the race), while Tom Pryce overshadowed Jarier in race performance, the Frenchman was still a very capable driver, but Shadow's dip in performance during the second half of the 75' and whole 76' season and also Pryce outperforming him left Jarier without a ride for 77.

The next season he became the first driver ever for the backmarker German team ATS, where in his debut with them, he finished 6th. But the performance of the team went downards and he jumped from ride to ride, until in 1978 he got the golden chance in quite tragic reasons. Lotus signed him as a last minute replacement for Ronnie Peterson, after the Swede died from injuries suffered in the Italian Grand Prix. Jarier looked strong in his debut with the team on the US West GP, where he was running third before his car broke down.

But the saddest moment came in Canada, where he got his third pole in F1 and dominated the whole race for almost 50 laps when his car broke down again and he had to retire, basically his last chance to win a Grand Prix ended there. From then on he got 2 solid seasons with Tyrrell, getting 2 podiums in 1979 and being a consistent point scorer with them.

After that, he drove for backmarker team Osella and in his last year in 1983 with Ligier, where he became known as a moving chicane who ignored blue flags as much as he could. Overall, Jarier's career was one of pure bad luck and bad choices, which leaves a very underrated driver, who had massive potential and could have won a few races, but never got the shot to run a full season with a top tier team.","['Btw, sorry for making such a long post, I just love writing about racing memorabilia too much.', '“Jarier really is completely out of order, I mean he really shouldn’t be allowed to drive in Grand Prix racing, he is, well he’s got a mental age of 10 in the first place and that was absolutely disgraceful… he should certainly have a short suspension for that, and for being himself he should have a permanent suspension” -James Hunt, 1983 Austrian Grand Prix\xa0', ""Where's Montoya with that BMW that exploded every race?

1jpquoo,[AMuS] Does Cadillac have a wind tunnel advantage?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jpquoo/amus_does_cadillac_have_a_wind_tunnel_advantage/,2025-04-02, News,,"['Translation and full article:\n\n\n> Cadillac has been an official member of the 2026 Formula 1 field since March 7. The US racing team now has eleven months to assemble a team and a car. Does Cadillac benefit from a wind tunnel advantage?\n\n> This Formula 1 project has never had an easy time. What began with Andretti Global\'s application in February 2023 took two years to final approval. During that time, the applicant vacillated between hope and fear. At the beginning of 2024, Formula 1 management mockingly recommended that Andretti try again in 2028.\n\n> By then, the company had already been declared a General Motors factory under the Cadillac flag. But it took Andretti\'s complaint to the U.S. Congress alleging antitrust violations that broke the ice. A face-saving compromise was reached. Suddenly, everyone was thrilled with General Motors\' commitment to Formula 1. On March 7, the FIA \u200b\u200bgave its final blessing.\n\n> The two years underground were not wasted. Since the fall of 2023, an ever-growing group of engineers, model builders, financial experts, and managers have been doing preparatory work for a team and a car scheduled to debut in 2026. For a long time, it was a journey to nowhere, as board member Mario Andretti explains: ""As long as we didn\'t have the commitment, we were only driven by the belief that everything would turn out well. Now everyone knows they\'re working on something that will be on the starting grid in 2026.""\n\n> Audi as a competitor on the labor market. The Cadillac Formula 1 team is spread across four locations. Its headquarters are in Fishers near Indianapolis, where a state-of-the-art race factory is currently being built. At the European branch in Silverstone, engineers are developing the American automaker\'s first Formula 1 car. Their wind tunnel is located at Toyota in Cologne. General Motors\' engine division is located in Charlotte, where it plans to eventually design and build its own Formula 1 engine.\n\n> Since its registration, Cadillac has been subject to the budget cap and all the regulations of the 2026 regulations. Now the rookies also have to pay their $450 million entry fee. One team member says: ""If there\'s no problem anywhere, it\'s with money. We\'re well financed."" The two major investors, Mark Walter and Dan Towriss, are absolute heavyweights with their companies.\n\n> Currently, around 300 people are working on building the team and developing the 2026 car. By the end of the year, the workforce is expected to grow to 650 employees. In theory, Cadillac has a good chance of recruiting new talent. They have plenty of open positions and room for improvement in their budget. But now, with Audi, they suddenly have a competitor on the English job market. The Ingolstadt-based company has opened a technology center just around the corner in Bicester.\n\n> Job advertisements only since the beginning of March. Cadillac\'s technical advisor Pat Symonds warns against underestimating the growth process: ""We were only able to issue detailed job advertisements once our approval was secured at the beginning of March. Before that, we had asked the non-binding question in the advertisements: Would you like to participate in an exciting project?""\n\n> Employees Cadillac recruits from other teams now can\'t start work immediately. Most are on leave until the end of the year. This means they won\'t be available until the next car. The newcomer also doesn\'t have unlimited flexibility within the budget cap. It all depends on how much you want to build yourself or outsource.\n\n> The plan is for Cadillac to do as much as possible itself. But that requires production facilities, know-how, and people. All of this is a time constraint. Unlike Audi, the Americans are essentially starting from scratch. Audi at least found a functioning infrastructure and a well-coordinated team at Sauber in Hinwil. And yet, Formula 1 boss Mattia Binotto has respect for the task: ""The transformation into a top team doesn\'t happen overnight. It takes up to five years.""\n\n> Building the car and integrating new employees is one thing. At least equally challenging are seemingly simple tasks such as logistics, establishing an IT department and a supplier network, liaising between development and production, and purchasing trucks and a motorhome. Cadillac essentially didn\'t get the ball rolling on these until the second week of March.\n\n(1/2)', 'Toyota F1 had the largest budget and most technologically advanced wind tunnel at the time. They ended up 0 wins, 3 poles, and 13 podiums in 140 starts.', ""They have an advantage, sure, but it doesn't automatically translate to performance."", 'Did Haas when they had unlimited development before they joined?', 'From what I am reading, it is most likely hearsay until we get more concrete information about their wind tunnel advantage. It is hard to calculate a result when nothing much has been properly tested just yet', 'Interesting they are not buying mechanical components like suspension from Ferrari. I would think they would buy as most as possible so they can build out the most needed team like aero and gradually build out the rest of the team. \n\nWhile it is a different regulation, I still think actual track time with current team is better than the wind tunnel advantage. Cadillac has very limited correlation data for now.', 'All I have to say is that livery render looks sexy as hell.', ""They're going to be 11th, they have some advantages sure but it's of little benefit when they're drastically disadvantaged in other areas."", 'Paywalled']",65,24,0.85,65,23,23,19,3,0.030000000000000027,19

1jp59f6,Phoenix Finance F1- A team that never rose from its ashes,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jp59f6/phoenix_finance_f1_a_team_that_never_rose_from/,2025-04-01, Throwback,"It's 2001, and everyone finished the season, and everyone was ready for a new season, well... except Prost. They had mounting debts, and it wasn't even insured that Prost would even compete in the 2002 season. They had offers from Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Pedro Diniz. Alain Prost didn't want to sell the team. He searched for sponsors. But when it was realised that no sponsors were found, the team was liquidated in January of 2002.

One of the possible asset buyers was Craig Pollock, the ousted BAR team principal. But the real buyer was the one and only. Tom Walkinshaw, the F1 version of being-everywhere man of the mid-90s. He outbid Paul Stoddart, who later became a Minardi team principal. Tom still owned Arrows. He was in a court case with Jos Verstappen over benching Jos for Heniz-Harald Frentzen. With the court still ongoing, he had to join up with someone, and that someone was Charlie Nickerson of Phoenix Finance Limited. So Charlie and Tom arranged that Charlie can run the team, and Tom would help with the assistance. Pollock would be the new team principal. Stoddart wasn't happy, to say the least. He thought that liquidation should have stayed in place. And he was not that wrong.

The thing is, they didn't buy the whole shares of the team. Instead, Charlie and the company bought some of the shares. As that was the case they were refused an entry for the 2002 season. They didn't went to Albert Park. They tried to go to the second race, in Malaysia, but they were refused entry there as well. Here are words of Bernie Eccelstone:
 “[Nickerson has] bought nothing in Formula 1. All he has bought is some show cars. He can forget it. He is wasting his time thinking about racing in Malaysia.” And he was. Next thing you know, he changes the team name to DART Grand Prix to convince FIA(failed BADLY), then BACK to Phoenix Racing after failed entry in Imola, then Nickerson ends up suing F1 and FIA. It went as well as expected. Stoddart was a happy man.

Now the drivers in question are interesting, one of them was supposed to be Gaston Mazzacane and the other seat went to Tarso Marques. And also, Tomáš Enge was possibly spotted testing the main machine. The machine was named the Phoenix Grand Prix AP04B. This was the Prost AP04 from 2001, however the car had the rear end of the Arrows AX3 Seater, a 3-seater car Arrows had designed a couple of years earlier. Rumors suggested that Chassis 3 was actually a Prost AP05 car but it is impossible to have this confirmed. Chassis 01 was a Prost AP04B. The cars appeared to be painted blue with no sponsor colours or logos.

The engines also came from the Arrows AX3 Seater, and were labeled as the Arrows T2-F1 V10. These engines had been used by Arrows in their F1 cars in 1998 and 1999, originating from a design by Brian Hart whose engine company was bought by Walkinshaw and merged into Arrows in the middle of 1997. The tyres were supposed to be provided by Bridgestone, however the Japanese company had already stated in early March that it would be unable to supply to Phoenix and Michelin said the same thing. So the most likely option at this point was a supply of Avon, yes Avon tyres, which Minardi had used a year before to shake down their PS01 car with Christijan Albers. The team was made up of approximately 50 employees; with most coming from the former Arrows test team and the folded Prost GP. With them were drivers Tarso Marques and Gastón Mazzacane. Managing Director Charles Nickerson stayed at the Arrows base at Leafield where the team were using floor space to prepare the cars. 

In the end of this bizzare saga, nothing was heard or seen from the Phoenix Grand Prix team after Imola. A few races later Tom Walkinshaw’s Arrows team hit financial trouble. The team could not afford the ever-increasing costs of F1 anymore and collapsed following the German Grand Prix. The team’s A23 cars were a fundamentally good design however – Paul Stoddart bought them with a view to using them as replacement to the PS03 in 2004 with Verstappen setting quick times in testing in the car, renamed as the Minardi PS04. Even later down the line, the A23 was used as the basis for Super Aguri’s first F1 car in 2006, the SA05, and while obviously dated and uncompetitive considering the advances made in the preceding years, provided a solid platform for the Japanese team to begin their F1 journey.

My moral of the story: Don't think you have everything if you ACTUALLY need everything.

Hill, Alesi, Hakkinen and Barrichello had high highs, but also some low lows.\n\n1997 - Probably Villeneuve just over Coulthard, the latter being the only candidate (except possibly Salo) who didn’t have a down year.\n\n1998 - Hakkinen\n\n1999 - Frentzen\n\n2000 - I think Hakkinen but can’t argue against Frentzen, who very much backed up what he did the prior year. \n\n2001 - Probably Trulli, but like 97, this is another year where convincing cases are hard to come by.\n\n2002 - Barrichello', 'Say we went back to 1950 number of races and you could only pick 6 races on the current calendar to make up the whole season which six would you choose?\xa0', 'Still waiting for Charles to drop his single after both Ferrari DSQ.
