It can't be, simply because the limit of the force applied is the limit of grip the tire has.\n\nIf the tire is slipping/locked up then that'll be the force exerted by the rubber in dynamic friction coefficient mode. If the tire is gripping the surface then it'll be static friction which is larger. Now, F1 cars operate normally in much higher grip situations than this particular spin; a dry track at high aero loads pushing the rubber against the track is the normal case. If the driver brakes hard, then the force will peak in static friction (i.e. not locked up) just before the limit is reached and then drop way down when the tire locks up and goes into dynamic friction i.e. sliding. The bottleneck will *always* be tire grip, and never braking pressure. This is true of any old car on the street, too. If you slam on the brakes then you'll always either slide (abs notwithstanding) or stop. It's just pretty easy to produce a higher force by pinching a brake disk than the force produced by friction in the short contact patch line/area of the tire with the road.\n\nEven in these high grip conditions, in a dry track with high downforce, going forwards, sideways, or backwards, suspensions don't just snap. They'd be very bad suspensions if they did because that's the standard environment they're expected to operate in. In a wet track, at a low speed, as in the incident, the grip is much lower. The maximum force that the tire puts on the suspension can't do more than tickle it. It doesn't matter if he accelerated or braked or reversed, the tire would start sliding way before the suspension flinched.\n\nIt seems much more likely there was a smaller defect there for a while, it grew larger as the track dried and Bortoletto started attacking kerbs more aggressively (and generally as fatigue added up), and the suspension snap is just an after-effect of the chain of failures that happened after the defect became a failure. \n\nHe had been getting brake failure messages on the dash pretty much the whole race too, and had to repeatedly do some settings on the wheel to reset the error message that came up. These messages became more and more common towards the failure. Brakes are right there close by the suspension, and if one were to speculate, perhaps the sensor errors were caused by a misalignment of something in that general area, and their becoming more frequent implies the misalignment could be increasing. And hey, there happened to be contact in the tire whose suspension snapped. Seems like a pretty clear picture to me that there was an issue brewing there for much longer up to the spin."", 'did the damaged suspension then went on to hold for 46 laps? seems unlikely', 'I think his suspension snapped before hitting the wall because his tyre suddenly started turning the opposite direction when he spun and hit the wall. The forces and vibrations this generated through his rear axle probably snapped the suspension.', '![gif](giphy|ulxHhvKW9X6459dtOn)', 'This is why i use reddit, thanks', ""I'm pretty sure this is a mix of both sides of the argument.\n\nHulk tapping Bortoleto's rear right might have weakened his suspension. Driving on it 46 more laps might have weakened it further.\n\nThen Bortoleto spins due to the rain and the sudden change of force the suspension dealt with during the spin caused it to fail before hitting the wall.\n\nIt's odd that the suspension failed without contact with the wall, but it's absolutely believable that a rookie spun out due to those conditions.""]",2275,130,0.97,2275,4069,4069,-2,0,0.0,-2

That is, tracing which side of the garage a driver is on and finding out which one has the most driver's champions victories.

I know Max is in Vettel's old seat (both drove with Riccardo), so that seat has 8.

Kimi's seat has 6 for sure, but what about Button's championship, (if that counts), both drivers left Brawn when it went to Mercedes. Rosberg and Barrichello switched seats to and from Williams, so does that mean it was Button whose seat was taken up by Schumacher and later Hamilton, making it 7?

But it's got to be an old team, Ferrari or McLaren probably

Ferrari has 15 driver's titles, so at least 8 are in the same seat, McLaren has 12, so might beat Ferrari out?

Okay, so it probably can't be Ferrari *or* McLaren, neither has a clear 8 to beat Red Bull.

Oddly, the only other competitor is Mercedes, if you count Brawn and Tyrell then it should be feasible for Lewis's seat to beat RB

*Okay so by my calculations, the most successful seat I can track is Max's current seat, as 8 drivers championships have been won in it, second best is a tie between Raikkonen and Schumacher's Ferrari seat, Senna, Lauda, Hunt, and Fittipaldi's McLaren seat, and Lewis's Mercedes seat. All at six.*","[""Okay, so Raikkonen and Schumacher had the same seat, that's 6  \nScheckter is the other seat, with Lauda that's 4\n\nWhen Lauda and Regazzoni come in there is a complete driver replacement, I think Regazzoni took Ickx's seat, as Ickx leaves of his own volition mid season, and Regazzoni has to recommend Lauda.\n\nAand now it's 1971 and Ferrari has entered three cars in multiple races.\n\nThe way the cars and seats boil down, I think only Ickx can be followed further.\n\nI don't think I can follow this trail back further, from '70 to '69 all three drivers get changed out, and while I could say Ickx, who also drove in '68, is a good enough connection, the same issue occurs in '67.\n\nSo it probably can't be Ferrari, unless they're a strong case to tie the drivers together before there are only two.

Ohh, Mercedes perhaps .."", 'You need to factor in three championships Sir Jackie Stewart won for Tyrell/Matra, it\'s practically Lewis\' seat.\xa0\n\n\nWilliams have 7 WDCs, too, just so you know.\n\n\nThe whole concept of counting titles per ""seat"" is problematic.

1jfozun,Opinions: The poor reception to Lewis' comments is simply down to difference in terminology usage.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jfozun/opinions_the_poor_reception_to_lewis_comments_is/,2025-03-20, Discussion,"To put it short: I think this is more of a translation error, so to speak, than anything else. Lewis didn't *literally* mean that the relationship between Max and GP is abusive, ""abuse"" here in the UK, has multiple connotations and things like swearing are sometimes referred to as ""abusive language"", which is what I think Lewis was trying to say, but it doesn't actually mean that the relationship itself is abusive. It does feel like this whole little thing has itself, ironically, been overbliwn because of a simply difference in usage of words.","['Are we really debating semantics when there are countless other things we should be baselessly speculating on during race week?', ""I agree it's overblown, but I also don't understand his point anyway. Which - if I understand it correctly - is about the media not writing about Max unleashing on the radio to GP. But about exactly that -  and unleashing to his team too - is what I've seen many articles about."", ""I've said it on another thread and I'll say it again. People are picking and choosing when to be super literal about a words definition."", 'If English wasn\'t his native language then yeah, maybe we could likely chock his comment up to a language barrier, or being ""lost in translation"".\n\nHowever, I think Lewis is articulate enough to know the meaning behind the words he\'s using. \n\nLet\'s not downplay it. He said what he said.', ""I think everyone overblows everything F1 drivers say in media. It's a lot easier to type something out and think about it and be able to correct yourself before hitting post."", 'I think the main objection people have is that it was unwarranted to mention Max by name in defense of your own criticism. It was a classic and pretty hostile what-aboutism and Lewis let his mask slip about where his relationship with Max stands from his point of view and it doesn\'t correspondent with earlier statements he made about that. Because it\'s clear that he does not have the respect for Max he says he has and is definitely more bothered by the fact he\'s been overtaken in skill level by Max than he lead on.\n\nEdit: I\'m talking about this direct quote,\n\n""Go and listen to the radio calls with others and their engineers\xa0‚Äì far worse,"" he said. ""The conversation that Max has with an engineer over the years, the abuse that the poor guy\'s taken and you never write about it, but you wrote about the smallest little discussion I had with mine.""\n\nSource: https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/hamilton-verstappens-radio-exchanges-far-worse-than-me-and-adami/10705141/', 'jesus christ does this really need a separate thread?', ""I mean, Free Practice isn't until tomorrow and I didn't want to get in the way of all the other semantic posts that'll come in then..."", ""Lewis has been getting slammed for saying 'Leave it to me, please'. Please show me articles where Max has said something as innocuous as that and been treated with the same level of scrutiny that Lewis has been. There's no denying that there have been articles about what Max has said on the radio, but I find it hard to believe that if Max said exactly what Lewis did, there would be any articles written at all. And that was Lewis' point.""]",0,38,0.32,0,36,36,0,11,0.020000000000000018,0
