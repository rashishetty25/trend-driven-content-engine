Lapping '16 very close to each other fighthing"", '*Tension in the Ferrari team*\n\nTranslation:\n\n> **Communication problems between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer Riccardo Adami also made headlines in Monaco. The two don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.**\n\n> In the first few races of the year, the communication problems between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer, Riccardo Adami, could still be attributed to the duo needing to get used to each other. But after their eighth Grand Prix together, the two still don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.\n\n> Minor misunderstandings between drivers and engineers are nothing unusual in Formula 1. In the case of Hamilton and Adami, however, it\'s the tone that makes the difference. Normally, the partner at the pit stop should support the driver and provide clear instructions. At Ferrari, however, misunderstandings and questions arise again and again.\n\n> In the final part of the Monaco race, for example, Hamilton wanted to know if he was still a minute behind the leading four. The answer was no answer: ""Charles is on mediums, the McLarens are on hard tires. They\'re fighting very closely,"" Adami radioed to the driver.\n\n> **The sound makes the music.**\nHamilton reacted audibly annoyed to the useless information: ""You\'re not answering my question. Actually, it doesn\'t matter. I just asked if I was a minute behind."" Only then was Hamilton given the current gap, as requested.\n\n> After the race, a somewhat strange exchange also occurred. Hamilton radioed his engineer on the cool-down lap: ""It wasn\'t the easiest weekend. But we won\'t give up the fight."" He was met with silence, to which Hamilton followed up: ""Are you angry with me, or is something wrong?"" Again, there was no response.\n\n> During his press conference, team principal Frederic Vasseur once again had to answer questions about the somewhat confusing radio messages. The Frenchman attributed the communication problems to the special Monaco layout, where radio communication is only possible in certain sections of the track.\n\n> **Vasseur sees no tensions.**\nFurthermore, Hamilton\'s statements in the cockpit generally shouldn\'t be taken too seriously: ""There\'s no tension just because someone asks a question. He\'s under pressure, he\'s fighting, he\'s driving between the walls – and he\'s doing that at 300 km/h. For me, that\'s all totally fine. I spoke to him after the race. He wasn\'t upset at all.""\n\n> But because this wasn\'t the first time Hamilton and Adami had talked past each other this season, frustration is growing among the record-breaking winner\'s fans. Their idol\'s poor results aren\'t helping to calm the situation, of course. The newcomer isn\'t looking for a chance against teammate Charles Leclerc.\n\n> Many fondly remember the times with Peter Bonnington at Mercedes. ""Bono"" and Hamilton formed a well-coordinated and close-knit team. While there were always a few questions about strategy, a certain respect was always expressed in their communication. The same couldn\'t always be said of Hamilton\'s radio messages in the first races of the year.\n\n> **Leclerc happy with new engineer.**\nEven his interactions with Sebastian Vettel and Carlos Sainz, whom Adami had previously coached at Ferrari, didn\'t always run smoothly. As a result, fans on social media are increasingly expressing their desire for Hamilton to be paired with a new man, preferably a British engineer, to avoid language barriers.\n\n> Ferrari demonstrated last year that it is willing to act in this position when necessary. Midway through the season, for the seventh race in Imola, Leclerc was given a new partner at the pit lane: Bryan Bozzi. The Italian replaced Spaniard Xavier Marcos. Since then, there have been clearer statements, something Leclerc repeatedly praises. Perhaps Ferrari should now try something new with Hamilton.', ""When the driver has to ask if the engineer is mad at him during the race, or when the engineer's mistake costs the driver 3 places on the racing grid, yeah, I think Hamilton needs a new engineer"", 'Short answer: si\nLong answer: yes', 'maybe Ferrari should just give the F1 team to their WEC crew?', 'Is water wet?

Ferrari is stuck in their own ways though traditionally, culturally with their insistence on hiring Italian/home based.

1kxe5me,Grand Prix Plaza Las Vegas,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxe5me/grand_prix_plaza_las_vegas/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"Quick review of some components of the newly opened Grand Prix Plaza in Las Vegas, for those considering going.

Quickest background.  Netflix era F1 fan, watch every race, follow every social media account I can, etc.  I have a basic G29 steering wheel and pedal setup at home, and have played multiple seasons of all of the recent F1 games, although I have spent more time playing Gran Turismo 7 for the past two years.  Have never driven a proper racing sim setup with motion.

I arrived on a recent weekday morning around 1030am when the Plaza opened.  Talked to the Go Kart track employees for a few minutes about options for races, and decided to book a Mixed Race (~20mph or so) that is geared for all ages for $79.  Comes with two 15 minutes races, consisting of a qualifying session and then a grid start race.  Both sessions rankings are set by fastest lap only, to prevent the race session from being a block fest.  Blocking is easy to do as the track is pretty tight in most places, with a few decent opportunities to go 2 or maybe 3 wide and pass when needed.  Karts have functional DRS, which works by SLOWING the lead car, allowing the trailing car to pass.  Great concept in theory, but maddening when you're the lead car on a fast lap and you're artificially slowed down because someone is behind you.  Karts have functional ERS, which works great, is fun, but was not explained enough to the other drivers in my party who missed using it the entire first 15 minute session.  I used ERS to successfully get pole lap out of 10 drivers.   10 drivers on a grid made for 20 was pretty good, only a few bottlenecks during each session - the track workers are pretty good with telling people to move over, etc.   Overall, I enjoyed it for the price, my party members who are not F1 fans thought it was a blast, and I would do it again at the mixed race level or the nightly elite races which are 30 mph and I'm sure way more fun (I would have done the 30 mph race but did not have time in my schedule).

The arcade simulators was my most anticipated component of the event, as I'm an avid F1 game racer with a basic setup and hadn't ever used a Sim.  Cost is $40 for 9 time trial laps around the Vegas circuit.   The chair and wheel and pedal all seem to be pretty mid to high level in quality, but the game engine is a major fucking letdown.  All of the driver assists are on, and there is no way to turn them off.  The camera is halo, and can not be changed to cockpit for full immersion.  The game steers, brakes, and shifts for you around the circuit even if you try to override the shifts, or brake slightly earlier than the settings.  This setting is helpful for average tourists, but for anyone who has ever spent any time playing the F1 game or any other racing game, it is not worth the money.  If anyone from F1 or the GPP is reading this, theres got to be a way to change the settings for amateur or frequent players of racing games - your new F1 arcades across the world and this GPP will not bring in repeat customers otherwise.  As someone who loves F1 and racing games, I would not ever spend money on their Sim racing games again unless this was changed.  Just my $0.02.

There's a small store, restaurant, and museum on the second floor of the paddock.  I skipped the museum due to time, but walked into the empty restaurant at the northern end of the paddock  building at 11am just to see it and the menu.  Menu looked good and i would definitely try it once.  Restaurant decor was a bit sparse, but the views over T1 were very cool.  To get to the restaurant, you walk the entire length of the paddock and you can walk the exterior balcony and oversee the entire front stretch, which is very cool.

The word is that the US is trying to broker such a deal and so Morocco will need to move fast to get a race, although if the money is right there is not reason that F1 cannot have two races in Africa, particularly as a race in Morocco would be more like a European event with the teams able to take all their equipment on ferries from Spain, rather than having pack everything into the flight boxes.

1kxo32d,Madrid track layout,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxo32d/madrid_track_layout/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"So I just saw a layout of the 2026 Spanish Grand Prix in Madrid and it’s getting a lot of hate for the amount of turns and comments about it being yet another track that isn’t conducive to overtakes. I’ve also heard grumbling of how many of the tracks on the current schedule (see Monaco) are similar in difficulty to perform overtakes. 

My question is: what aspect of track design lends to more overtakes? And why are many of these circuits being built this way? Is it more of an issue with the design or is it just how large the modern F1 car is, or a mix of both? You’d think these race organizers would want uh, you know, actually racing instead of a parade of cars (see Monaco again.)

Also, what is in fact the best track for overtaking? ","['Take silverstone, interlagos or cota as examples of good tracks for racing.\n\nTake Hungaro mexico or Sochi to see what’s not good for racing\n\nThen there’s a middle ground of tracks like Spa or Monza that used to be good for racing but are ruined by DRS trains and dirty air\n\nFor an overtaking chance to occur in modern f1 you need a straight that’s not preceded by a slow twisty section and that ends in a heavy braking zone\n\nThe madrid track is an abomination from any point of view', ""I would argue that Bahrain, Interlagos, Las Vegas, Canada and Mexico are the best for overtaking right now. \n\nGenerally F1 cars need a long straight followed by a heavy braking zone to encourage overtaking, with the emphasis on heavy braking. \n\nLots of sequential corners and a narrow track make overtaking difficult. Imola is difficult because it's a lot of medium speed corners with no straights long enough to create overlap. Monaco is difficult because it's narrow and there's basically no straights to create braking events big enough to pass. \n\nJapan was difficult because the dirty air made it hard to be close enough at the beginning of the long straights, and turn 1 isn't a big enough braking event to allow for overtakes. I was surprised there weren't more opportunities at the Casio Triangle but I think 130r makes that hard. \n\nI think a lot of people would argue with me on Mexico being good for overtakes but I think the thin air creates and interesting balance where you get Monza-like downforce levels while trying to add on as much downforce as possible. The first two sequences of corners I feel create decent opportunities for pass attempts."", 'You need a high-speed straight ending in a heavy braking zone, followed by a low speed corner, with decent track width. Lose any one of those and you lose overtaking. Turn 1 at Baku is an overtaking dream. Turn 1 at Hungaroring is more difficult.

Turn 1 at Monaco is a nice 90 degree-ish right hander, but the straight is too short, speeds are too low, and the track is too narrow.', ""I'm looking forward to it and interested in it, Vegas also got a lot of hate but it's been one of the better races last couple of years, I am sure that they built the track with the current cars in mind so i wouldn't be too worried tbh."", ""Long straights followed by hard braking zones is the usual recipe for modern F1.

I know that the experience in person can vary significantly from watching the race on site from the TV. So, anyone has any recommendation on which of those gives you a more enjoyable experience?

It was just funny to me when I saw a few pictures of them next to the drivers, and this guy that is probably supposed to be 21 or so standing next to people like Oscar and Lando, and even Carlos and looking older than them. It's fine. Some people just look older than their age. If I was told that someone who looked like him was 21 I wouldn't automatically jump to thinking they were lying, I'd just think he looked really old for his age. I think it makes more sense when there are only actors around, putting in real life athletes hanging around skews it a bit, but whatever. I totally understand doing it with high schoolers, because labor rights make it annoying to work with anyone under 18. And kids are usually worse actors. So a typical show casts a 22 year old to be 15, and then when the show is still going on five years later and the teens are only supposed to have aged two years, you just go along with it."", ""Spoilers for a trailer I watched. \n\nYeah, I didn't know it was that long ago. Or I guess I wasn't positive it was set in the modern era and not like set in 2007ish times, so the 90s wouldn't have been that long ago. If the character was in his 40s, the gap from his retirement would have also had to have been smaller, and it would just be all around less crazy. It would be almost like a more extreme version of calling Hulk back. It could be like if Massa retired after his 2009 crash, ended up racing elsewhere, but then came back in like 2017 to mentor Stroll because Papa Stroll wanted Lance to have a mentor. And Massa can be a few years older than he was then. That would be extreme, but still semi-believable. Not like 55ish year old Pitt whose character can't have been that established in F1 because he's apparently never won an F1 race?\n\nI'll watch it and enjoy it, I just wish they'd gone with making the character younger. Pitt could totally play a 40 something. After factoring in the never won a race thing, maybe he's not actually that old? Maybe he had barely started his F1 career and was like 23 in 1999? He could maybe barely be late 40s now? Though I'm not sure why someone who barely had an F1 career twenty five years ago would be the ideal candidate for an F1 rookie.""]",0,14,0.4,0,14,14,0,0,0.0,0

1kxpby6,Does Sauber get a pass for being sh*t?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxpby6/does_sauber_get_a_pass_for_being_sht/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"I started watching F1 during the COVID lockdown in 2020 (yes I'm a DTS F1 baby), and I've seen Williams and Haas get absolutely dragged through the mud for some appalling seasons. This is probably fair- Haas had some dismal years from Bad Santa to Mazepin, and Williams during Claire's last years was in a sorry state.  

However, looking at Sauber's F1 results since *2008*, when they placed 3rd in the WCC, they've been quietly and consistently bad. Sauber has managed to place higher than 7th in only three seasons: 

2009: 6th 

2012: 6th 

2022: 6th  

Unlike both Williams and Haas, which are on an upward trajectory, Sauber seems to only be getting worse. So where is the uproar over their poor performance? Does Sauber not have a dedicated fanbase like the other teams?  

Wondering if some real F1 veterans can enlighten me on this one. 

Thanks!","[""Sauber have always been underdogs (with the exception of when they were owned by BMW). They went through some very bleak years a while back - they didn't turn on the wind tunnel because they couldn't pay for the electricity at one point.\n\n\nNow they're kind of in a transitional period and it was expected that they would not be great, however the political infighting between Seidl and Hoffman hurt the development of the team."", 'Williams got a lot of flack in my opinion because they are a historical team and people expect more success out of them. They’ve been surpassed by the 2 other historical teams (McLaren and Ferrari) and leapfrogged by the 2 newcomers (Mercedes and Red Bull), so there’s a level of disappointment. As far as HAAS goes, they’ve had too many seasons where they seemed incompetent (2021 comes to mind) and have had their fair share of drama.\n\nAs for Sauber, they’ve always been an underdog team with lower funding and fewer fans, so of course lower expectations. People do love some of their drivers and moments (Kubica my goat), but they’ve also gotten equal and well-earned criticism for pay drivers and now controversial sponsors. I think the lack of fans just put them in the back of most people’s minds. Kinda hard to hate on the team that’s always forgotten.', 'They are in a holding pattern until being Audi branded. They expected to be nowhere.\xa0', ""In addition to what's already been said by others, the longer-term F1 fans have seen lots of examples of *really* bad teams, and Sauber have never hit those lows. Sure, they've been last in the championship, but they've never been several seconds behind midfield (e.g. when Caterham, Virgin & HRT joined in the early 10s), and they never been a total headcase outfit (look at examples from the 90s like Lola, Andrea Moda or Life). The grid is so close together nowadays (<2s) that unfortunately someone has to be last, but I'd say they are still performing at a very respectable level for their resources.\n\nAlso, they have historically been the launching pad for some great young drivers - all of these guys who made their F1 debut with Sauber went on to win races or championships later in their careers: Frentzen, Raikkonen, Massa, Kubica, Vettel, Perez, Leclerc."", ""Saubers been the plucky underdog for almost 30 years now (Over 30 years if you include BMW years) at this point it's a surprise if they aren't at the back."", 'There are 10 teams. Someone\'s going to be at the back. If some teams are ""on an upward trajectory"" then others have to be the opposite. \n\nSauber are not consistently last in every qualifying/race. And even if they were, why people feel the need to dump on the team at the back is beyond me. That they can build a car so close to the fastest track car in the world is commendable. But a McLaren is a ""rocketship"" and a Sauber is a ""shitbox"", according to some people. It\'s crazy. They are both incredibly fast.', ""They are being given a pass, yes. Because for the longest of time (1993 - 2005, 2010 - 2016), it was a privateer team, which meant lower budgets, less sponsors and all decisions being filtered through one person (Peter Sauber). When they were given the time of the day, when they became the BMW factory team, they did deliver as well as they could. As for their current stint... well, they got shafted when they became Ferrari's C-Team, with Ferrari seemingly more interested in developing Haas than investing in them. And now they're in a holding pattern for Audi, not even bothering to recover from the Alfa Romeo stint cause, why spend the money when Audi can spend theirs?"", 'You can say ""shit"", eh?', ""I feel like Sauber gets dragged for it all the time, but in the last few years, it's been understandable. They've been in the process of selling to Audi for a few years, and it's also the last few years of the regulations. It doesn't really make sense for Sauber (team now owned by Audi) to put a lot of money into making a good car when they are about to finally be under the Audi name, and want to spend all possible money towards making 2026 and the future as good as possible.\n\nProbably they'll get a pass at first in the new regulations because they have a first time engine manufacturer, so we might assume it's that if they struggle.\n\nFrankly, they aren't that far off the pace. All the drivers and all the cars are so good. Usually everyone is within a second in qualifying, and that definitely hasn't always been the case in F1. Honestly sometimes F1 qualifying is tighter in times than professional spec series qualifying, even when we all know that there's a general pattern that the better drivers are at the better teams, with some exceptions for most teams having a number one and number two driver, and some drivers not fitting in the driver market. With that taken into account, it's crazy how tight the whole F1 grid is. Sauber doesn't always have both cars out in Q1. They are bad, but there is usually a team this bad or worse. Hulkenburg getting some points in the first race by surviving and taking advantage of the weather took some pressure off them so they don't have to worry about having a pointless season.""]",0,83,0.41,0,397,397,0,2,0.009999999999999953,0

what do you think would happen? or what do you think is an achievement that’s worthy of being part of the triple crown if you remove monaco? could be from any motorsport series, doesn’t have to be from f1

Monaco is just *another* F1 race, much more beholden to the season surrounding it and given that it's really a qualifying session + a parade, it's arguably the easiest F1 race to win.
