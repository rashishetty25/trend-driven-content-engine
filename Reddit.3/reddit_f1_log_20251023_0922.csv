1odel9t,Norris is a particular bad starter: the numbers,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odel9t/norris_is_a_particular_bad_starter_the_numbers/,2025-10-22, Discussion,"https://preview.redd.it/67gqcyy45pwf1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=19074f8c188fdf5639e61217cb9199d328c08e0c

When Norris starts from the front two rows he loses an average of 0.65 positions, the worst among top drivers in recent memory. He’s also the most likely to lose positions (40% of races vs Max at 16%) and the least likely to gain (10% of races, vs Max at 28%).

Note that this analysis only considers starts from the front two rows, which naturally biases the results toward losses (since there’s more room to move backward than forward). Even so Max still manages to gain positions on average. Alonso And Leclerc also perform strongly across these metrics.

**Methodology:**

* \~15 years of data analyzed
* Only races where the driver started in the front two rows
* Lap-1 position changes capped at ±4 to limit the impact of outliers

Edit: [updated](https://i.imgur.com/EGQQaUO.png) with data back to '96. Mark Webber hahahaha! Also, per /u/[Ger\_Oktoberfe](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ger_Oktoberfest/)st's  [suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odel9t/comment/nkubqpp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I added a position delta relative to the average, which broadly tells a similar story. Lastly, data sourced from the [jolpica-F1](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1) API.","['Russell\'s comments after COTA were amusing - he was banking on Norris doing the sensible thing at the start. Instead Lando did Lando things and it blew up in George\'s face.\n\n*""I made a good start. Max covered Lando. I expected Lando to go on the outside to cover Charles, so I stayed on the inside but Lando didn\'t move across. He got overtaken and I got boxed in and got overtaken by Oscar and Lewis.""*', 'i think on F1TV they said that 3 times he lost position this season when P3 started on softs', 'Great data analysis,  I love stuff like this!\n\nWould it be possible to add some columns where you correct this for starting position? \n\nFor example from pole position,  there will definitely be an average loss, if you consider all races over the same period.\n\nSo if the average loss from position P1 is -0.3  you can correct all starts from p1. Same for p2 p3 p4', ""I don't think it’s so much his reaction time to the start itself but his general risk aversion wheel to wheel in t1 and the way he preps the tires. One of Lando’s biggest strengths is his ability to preserve the tires over race stints. This probably requires him to be gentle with them early and they’re probably running cooler than they should at the start of the race."", 'This is a very interesting analysis, but I think your math could be improved. The problem here is that it\'s a lot harder to go forward from 1st than it is to go forward from 4th. That\'s skews the data against people who get pole a lot. Having only the first 4 start rows also means you have very little data on most of the mid-field.\n\nMy suggestion: First, calculate the average position-after-one-lap for each starting position. Let\'s borrow from golf and call this ""par"". So for pole is probably like 1.5 or so, while for 10th it\'s probably very close to 10. Then just compare each driver\'s start with what is par, and get your average from that.\n\nWould allow you to do all drivers and all starting positions, and probably give a more accurate result.', 'He’s also quite poor at safety car restarts. He gets caught sleeping a lot.', 'Alonso and Max in another level... But the next one is Perez.', ""Question, could you separate it by years?

I was wondering if he's made any improvements this year and if there's any variability in each year or is it consistent?\n\nObviously the further back you go the less data you have but I still think it would be interesting."", ""I'd say Webber was an even worse starter as a front runner, but apart from him yeah...""]",1686,255,0.95,1686,4726,4726,84,0,0.0,84

We have three all time greats (Max, Hamilton and Alonso), a few drivers that with the right car could be at least multiple time WC (Leclerc, Russell, Piastri and Norris), a midfield packed with race winners, consistent point scorers and future race winner drivers, and one of the best rookie class we've ever seen. Arguably the worst drive in the grid, Stroll, already has 3 podiums and 1 pole. 

If we think that not so long ago we had paying drivers like Latiffi, Mazepin, Sirotkin and so many others, and that in the early 90s almost half of the grids were paying drivers of this level, I can't think of a season that had a better grid. Not saying that it couldn't be improved of course, but how much better could it be?","[""Every generation is better than the generation before. Before Schumacher, most racing drivers started in the early teens. Today everyone on the grid was racing karts since around the time they started primary school if not before. They've gone through years of development and training, and get specialist support to hone their fitness and reactions. The standards just get higher.\n\nEven recent pay drivers were better than the pay drivers of the past. All three of those you mentioned won things at the level below, and managed to do enough to get the needed Superlicense points. We used to get drivers who were just rich playboys having a jaunt.\n\nSo, yeah, this is probably the best grid in history. It'll soon be beaten."", ""The backmarkers are better than they used to be.\n\nBut I'm not sold that the front of the grid is that great, bar Verstappen. \n\nWe've got Lewis and Fernando of course, but the grids of 10 years ago had better versions of them."", '2012 grid was the best by far.

Tsunoda hasn’t really been helping Verstappen or Red Bull strategically this season – there’s been no teamwork when it could’ve mattered.

There’s literally nothing to lose.

It could actually be a win-win situation:
1.	Talent evaluation: Red Bull gets to see how Hadjar performs under real race pressure.
2.	Strategic upside: A hungry rookie might be able to snatch a point or two from McLaren. 
","['No', ""Let's not forget that Tsunoda performed fine in the Racing Bulls too. Qualified p5 in Australia and was in Q3 in both the Sprint and 'main' Qualifying.  Lawson also did poorly in his first 2 races in the RBR, but is also doing well in the Racing Bulls - that car is fast and easy to drive.\n\nNo point in running Hadjar's confidence, putting him under more pressure (considering he is supposed to help Verstappen) and I don't think he will be that much of an upgrade. \n\nAlso, considering that Honda paid for Tsunoda to be in that seat.... Not happening. Yuki will be leaving RBR this year, I don't see a demotion saving him, they would probably rather keep Lawson. So let him finish his season."", ""No.    \nAlso: why would you want that when next year's car is a new concept? To shatter Isack's confidence before he has a real chance?"", ""Absolutely no reason to do that.\n\n\n1. Not necessary\n2. No lol just no chance of that at all\n\n\nThe second red bull car doesn't have all the same upgrades as the first car so it's never going to get close so it's just pointless throwing someone else in and ruining their confidence\xa0"", 'No. It’s already insanely hard to learn the car. Let alone for a rookie. Let alone with 5 races left on the calendar. It’s not worth potentially floundering Hadjar for a couple more points which they aren’t guaranteed. \n\nDon’t forget that Yuki probably would be doing much better if he was in the VCARB instead of the RB21. I think out of all the options Red Bull had, promoting Yuki was the best option for this year. If you look at Checo’s form at the end of 2024 it’s very similar to Yuki’s performance save for a few outliers. It was mostly 10ths or lower or DNFs with a few decent positions spattered about. However Checo was riding the wave down on the rb20 and Tsunoda has been riding the wave in the trough and is on the way up so we’ll see how it plays out.', ""> to see how Hadjar performs under real race pressure\n\nAs if up until now Hadjar wasn't participating in real reaces?\n\n> A hungry rookie might be able to snatch a point or two from McLaren\n\nOr might not be able to do that.\n\nYour argument isn't convincing.\n\nThey know the car is difficult to drive and Hadjar has no experience with it. There is nothing to gain by putting him into that car."", ""Yeah absolutely. If red bull just sacrifices another young driver to the racing gods on the bloody altar that is the second seat next to Verstappen that's a Championship in the bag for him.
