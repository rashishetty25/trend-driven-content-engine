Cars running so close to the ground might be limited, given what we are going to see with the new regs next year.\n\nShovlin is right that it shouldn't be bad, provided that little drastic implementations that actively encourage those things will come up, but I do want to see how much it will impact the production of racing and overtaking opportunities"", 'I wouldnt say its as bad or worse than 2021. That ruleset was on a really bad level. Sure, 2025 cars do notably worse than 2022 cars, but i would say they quite reach that level.\n\nAs for next year, improved wake performance and improving the current shortcommings in that area is the primary target for the aero regulations, next to the drag reduction for the PU. We will see how sucessfull they will be with that.', ""I've watched some deep dives on the new aero regulations by aero engineers.\n\nHonestly, looks promising regarding managing dirty air.\n\nDirty Wake should be much narrower due to the barge boards working to pull it under the car rather than wash it out to the side, as they do currently. \n\nSmaller wings, particularly the front wing will also reduce how much dirty air is generated and how much the following car is affected by it.\n\nIt remains to be seen how easy overtakes will be given the following car no longer gets drs advantage (all cars get drs next year)"", 'Such a shame really. 2022 was the best year of these ending regulations, everything else was very poor in regards to what these rules were meant to accomplish.', 'The FIA needs to be proactive in minimizing dirty air by changing the regulations as teams discover tricks. Something that makes the car faster and makes it harder for the following car to overtake is a massive bonus for the teams and something they will want to pursue.', 'One thing that most people forgot was the Spa TD in 2022 and the massive height increase for the floor in 2023. These made floors less effective and as such made running in dirty air much worse. Which is why teams had to focus on normal aero surfaces for downforce as well as sealing the floor', 'From what I\'ve gathered about next years Aero Regs, they\'re basically trying to brute force the dirty air issue compared to the 2022 cars which were an attempt at a more ""elegant"" solution.\n\nIntroducing moveable aero on the front wing, raising the height of the rear diffuser, introducing inwashing barge boards, the return of ellaborate front wing endplates were all introduced to help reduce dirty air. \n\n[Driver61](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OwHobp4xPE) does a good job explaining how the 2026 aero regs will *roughly* perform, and by the looks of things, it\'s quite positive compared to how the engine regs have been percieved.']",77,29,0.97,77,29,29,35,17,0.010000000000000009,35

3. Top 16 in the regular season (which lasts until Belgium here) Earns you a place in the playoff   
4. There are 4 post season round RO16, RO12, RO8 , and the final 4  
5. Everyone's points get reset apart from the postseason points you earn  
6. you get 5 bonus postseason points per regular season win   
7.Each knockout round runs for the 3 races where the bottom 4 get eliminated   
8. In the final race the final 4 go at it for the win whoever finishes ahead wins the WDC
