""I even sent him an Instagram DM once. A very long one where I told him all about it. But I didn't get a reply.

So, I worked very closely with a psychologist, a sports psychologist. Almost my entire career, especially in my world champion year. Sometimes I sat with him for up to 2 hours every other day, going through everything that was possible. Visualizing, repeating, meditating, everything. If I were his psychologist, the first thing I would say is, of course, that's wonderful for us. Yes, he makes himself very approachable. He shows his feelings, his doubts. That's great, of course. But for him, I would recommend that he doesn't repeat it over and over again, because in the repetition, at some point you also reinforce it in yourself.""

Interviewer: The negative, right? 

""Yes, of course, the negative. If you say every day that I'm not good enough, at some point you'll believe it. That's why I would strongly recommend that he reduces that, not always the negative. Even when he's on pole, he talks about the one corner he messed up - and he's on pole. Just cheer about the brilliant performance, more positivity. And then of course he's just a bit of a sensitive person.

You had wild overtakes, cars with weird skinny noses, team liveries that looked like someone lost a bet and strategies that made absolutely no sense but somehow worked.

Montoya sending it from 3 miles back, Takuma Sato just deciding to try things and teams like BAR-Honda constantly doing something ridiculous.

Don’t get me wrong, this era of car is on a different level. But back then it felt like anything could happen… and half the time, it did.

1l6nrfp,are the current gen cars all uniquely quirky?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l6nrfp/are_the_current_gen_cars_all_uniquely_quirky/,2025-06-08, Technical,"The second Red Bull seat along with with Hamilton's move to Ferrari get the most attention but it seems like in the current generation, any driver that moves to a new team does considerably poorer vs. their teammate, even if that teammate is a rookie. It almost seems like having no experience with the car ( and possibly not having to unlearn behaviors) is a larger benefit than experience. 

Do the current generation of cars have individual unique qualities that are more exemplified than in previous generations? 

I'm using Bearman/Ocon, Bortoleto/Hulkenburg, Sainz/Albon, Hamilton/Leclerc as examples. I also consider the Lawson/Hadjar Racing Bulls and Colapinto/Alpine in this bucket as well but there's not been as many races for them.","[""Apparently what confounds many drivers is that the current gen really don't react well to hustle.\n\nSo if you're not quick, your instinct is to give it a bit of stick, and they don't react well to that. \n\nAlonso was saying that often you can go slower when you push, quote unquote."", 'I wonder if it’s actually hard to assess drivers as well. Ricciardo at McLaren and Checo at Red Bull have shown that the quirks can be career killers. I see a guy like Bottas on the sidelines when he perhaps shouldn’t be. \n\nIt’s felt like in recent years that rookie drivers were a liability. Now it feels more like too much experience can be your downfall.', 'I think at the limit these cars have weird tendencies that most drivers have learned to drive around. Mostly to do with the fact that as they slow the cars, downforce doesnt bleed off linearly in a predictable manner. I think it was Ocon who put it best, there is one very specific way to drive these cars, not like previous generations where you would have 3 ways to get the maximum.\n\nNow every team handles the downforce issue a bit differently. Which is why Max can tame his car, while his teammates struggle, Leclerc and Sainz had moments where either did better when design philosophy went one way. Arguably a case can be made for Ham and Rusell. in 2023 when Ham got the car he wanted, he was p3 in the constructors, when (it can be argued) it was more towards Rusell, he struggled, Russel did beat him, but was only p6.\n\nBasically these gen cars are kinda shit, drivers dont like them, engineers dont like them either. Downforce calculations for that underfloor become far, far more complex at the limit, which is the cause for all the correlation issues you hear about.', ""It's definitely odd that experience seems almost bad for these current regulations.\n\nI've hated these regulations, it just feels like the entire point was to reduce dirty air, yet it's the biggest issue the drivers have.\n\nThe tyres have been a disaster, either they last the entire race or can't do two laps in quali, it's definitely been a frustrating set of regs.\n\nHopefully the new regs will get away from these issues, the tyres have been awful, it's why McLaren has been so amazing, they're the only team that's figured out some magic to resolve this issue, but whatever they've done seems impossible to replicate by the other teams, so props to them. \n\nBut car setups need to not be so restricted, the floors needing to be so low to the ground seem to lock everyone into specific types of setups and it seems like we don't have as many varied driving styles since pushing sometimes seems to make cars actually go slower.\n\nWe'll see what happens next season, it's great that the McLaren boys have a battle this season, but it mostly feels like whoever qualifies first wins, so I'd like to see the sport get away from that again."", ""The real reason is the cars are all extremely close. You can see the talk on the Williams channel with Sainz, Albon, and Coulthard, where Sainz says he looked like a fool getting knocked out in Japan while Albon was a legend going to Q3, but in the data the gap was 0.05 seconds.   \n\nJust a few years ago, cars had much more gaps to other teams. Even when performances swung, they would go from one big gap to another big gap - especially at the front. There have been races where Red Bull, Ferrari, and Mercedes would lap the rest of the field upto P7, and P7 would have a super lonely race with nobody within 10-15 seconds. For example, in the 2019 Australian GP, the gap in Q1 between first and getting knocked out was ~0.62 seconds. That gap in 2017 would've probably put you firmly in 5th."", ""i think Magnussen spoke about this in an interview, basically the current f1 cars has quite a unique way in driving them, you can't really be agressive with it, one example is Lewis, he has been a late braker most of his career, and because the current car relies so much on floor downforce late braking would distrupt the airflow underneath and cause the car to become unstable\n\nhttps://www.planetf1.com/news/kevin-magnussen-lewis-hamilton-daniel-ricciardo-ground-effect-f1-car-struggles"", 'I don\'t know how it is compared to previous regulations, but you sometimes forget that the cars aren\'t just made by different manufacturers, they\'re also completely unique, no part is the same between teams. (except for some fia supplied parts ofc) Teams come up with fundametally different ways to solve the same issues within the rules, which lead to these ""quirks"".\n\n(Two cars in the same team are obviously the same with the exception of differently scheduled upgrades, if I didn\'t make that clear)\n\nEdit again: I somehow totally forgot teams can buy suspension parts from each other, (as well as engine and transmission ofc)', ""Everyone grew up carting, and a big part of carting is weight management in braking and cornering. They are extremely flat platforms, but acceleration, braking and cornering is still shifting weight around. Drivers are using weight transfer to help with cornering grip, and often using braking to unweight the rear to quickly rotate the car.\n\nThese cars *hate* this. The floor wants to be flat relative to the ground to generate ground effect downforce. These cars take every corner at high enough speed to have some aerodynamic effect from the floor in play, and weight transfer in any axis can lead to a reduction in downforce or the stalling of the floor. They hate curb-riding more than any other iteration of F1.\n\nThese cars fight the instincts of these drivers at every turn. Lewis has built a career on unweighting the rear under very late braking to plant to nose and rotate the rear of the car, and now all that does is compromise some percentage of the floor's effect. Many other drivers clearly struggle.\n\nIt's not surprising that the youngest drivers adapt to this the fastest. It's also not surprising that these cars suit basically nobody."", 'Ground effect cars seem to punish those who brake late. So slow in fast out is preferred.']",389,54,0.95,389,1232,1232,18,1,0.010000000000000009,18

I am relatively new to F1 with a non-engineering background. \n\nI recently picked up the book - How to Win a Grand Prix: From Pit Lane to Podium - the Inside Track by Bernie Collins and the insight is absolutely fantastic. \n\nBut at the same time, it has completely sapped any fun out of F1 to me. \n\nThe amount of numbers, science, engineering and statistics, down to the millimetre.\n\nIt would be great to see one race a year where everyone races in the same car, to see who's skill comes out on top. \n\nRather than a sport, F1 just seems like one big science experiment with too much technology.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?"", ""I'm by no means an expert, but my understanding is that MotoGP, Moto2 and Moto3 are effectively three classes of one world championship, all running the full calendar. (Crucially, it's not like WEC or other modern multi-class championships where all classes race simultaneously).\n\nOn the other hand, F2 and F3 for most of their history have been wholly separate championships from F1, and are also not World Championships according to the FIA. There's a long history of alternative championships (GP2, Formula Renault, F3000 etc.) and long stretches of history where F2 and F3 either didn't exist at all or did exist in some form but were not formally tied to F1."", 'The FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing contains multiple classes, it\'s structured more like WEC, which also has multiple classes and both have winners for the individual classes.  \nWhile the FIA Formula One World Championship - is just that, for formula 1 and the FIA Formula 2 Championship and Formula 3 Championship are 3 separate championships.  \n  \nIf it was called the \'FIA Formulae World Championship"", then it could be a grouping of various classes under one championship banner, also including Formula E for example.', 'F2, F3, and F4 are explicitly designed to be ""feeder series"", in that FIA intends them to be rungs of a ladder on which drivers climb up, accumulate Super License points, and hopefully get into Formula 1. FIA actively pushes successful drivers ""upwards"" by making a rule that F2 and F3 world champions can no longer compete in the same series the next year. You may also see this from the aspect of F1 teams: they sign feeder series drivers into their dedicated junior programs aiming to foster future F1 drivers.\n\nWhile people might sometimes consider Moto2 and Moto3 as analogous to feeder series based on riders\' career paths, they are not intentionally made so by FIM. The different series are officially different displacement classes of the World Championship. There is also no Super License system or banning of Moto2 and Moto3 champions from staying in their series.\n\nOne may compare Formula 2 to JuniorGP and the whole concept of F1 feeder series to Road to MotoGP.', ""F2 and F3 aren't world championships for a start. I don't really follow MotoGP but I'm pretty sure that the lower categories follow the MotoGP calendar entirely whereas F2 and F3 don't.\n\nThe FIA is pretty strict about what counts as a world championship.

Not to scare you away, but the sport is primarily an engineering and money management game above individual drivers performance, as the best driver won't win a race in the worst car, while a mediocre driver has a chance of winning in a great car.""]",4,7,0.75,4,7,7,1,2,0.030000000000000027,1
