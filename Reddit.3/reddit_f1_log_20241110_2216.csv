1gnnzfy,"Into the Buxtonverse: following up on Will's predictions of the 2025 grid, four years later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnnzfy/into_the_buxtonverse_following_up_on_wills/,2024-11-10, Discussion,"During the 2021 summer break, Formula One published [a prediction](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/buxton-my-just-for-fun-prediction-of-what-the-2025-f1-grid-will-look-like.5ngS2W3xboKjYqmOubDVhM) by u/willbuxton of which drivers would form the 2025 F1 grid and where they would drive. Will assured the reader that it was just for fun and implored them not to take it too seriously, so I've decided to create an in-depth analysis.

First up, what he got right: 9 of the 20 drivers, with correct teams for 3 of them.

|Driver + Team correctly predicted|Driver correctly predicted to be on grid (predicted team)|
|:-|:-|
|Max Verstappen - Red Bull|Lando Norris (Red Bull)|
|Charles Leclerc - Ferrari|Carlos Sainz (Ferrari)|
|George Russell - Mercedes|Pierre Gasly (McLaren)|
||Liam Lawson (Aston Martin)|
||Esteban Ocon (Alpine)|
||Andrea Kimi Antonelli (Williams)|

The prediction of Ferrari keeping their LEC-SAI lineup for a 5th straight season deserves praise. That was a bold call given that Sainz had only completed half a season with Ferrari and had never spent even 3 full seasons with a team in his career, and it took a black swan event to keep it from coming true.

I also respect the predictions of Antonelli and Lindblad being on the grid, keeping in mind that both of them were still karting at the time. Antonelli will be on the grid in '25 while the Lindblad prediction may end up being off by only 1 year if Lindblad performs in F2 next year like he did in F3 this year. Also, by predicting Lindblad to be on the grid in '25, Will implicitly predicted that the 18-year-old age restriction would be relaxed or lifted, which did indeed happen in our timeline.

Finally, I think Seb's retirement took quite a few people by surprise in our timeline, while Will seemed to have seen it coming and was only off by 1 year in predicting it.

Okay, nice job with those predictions Will. Now let's take a look at some that didn't pan out:

|Drivers whose career ends were incorrectly predicted|Drivers predicted to be on the grid whose F1 careers ended prior to 2025|Predicted drivers who never entered Formula 1 as of 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fernando Alonso|Mick Schumacher|Pato O'Ward|
|Lewis Hamilton|Nyck De Vries|Theo Pourchaire|
|Lance Stroll||Dennis Hauger|
|Oscar Piastri||Jamie Chadwick|
|Alex Albon||Arthur Leclerc|
|Sergio Perez||Kyle Kirkwood|
|Yuki Tsunoda||Zane Maloney|
|Nico Hulkenberg||Arvid Lindblad|

As you can see, there are quite a few drivers whose careers ended by 2025 in the Buxtonverse but not here. While there was a brief ""rookie winter"" in our timeline where teams heavily valued experience, teams in the Buxtonverse were eager to give new talent a shot.

Another interesting note: Oscar Piastri's and Theo Pourchaire's fortunes are almost mirror images of each other's in the Buxtonverse. There, Alonso (still driving for Alpine) retires mid-season 2023 and is replaced by Piastri for the rest of the year, who also keeps the seat for '24. Meanwhile, Pourchaire drives for Alfa/Sauber in '23 and '24 and replaces Piastri at Alpine in '25 (it's implied that his French nationality plays a part), with Piastri failing to find a '25 seat. The two of them had finished 1-2 in F3, separated by 4 points, the year before the prediction was published and it seems Will put a lot of stock in Theo's youth and inferior machinery.

# Championship Predictions

|Year|WDC|WCC|WCC-P2|WCC-P3|WCC-P4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024|Lando Norris (Red Bull)|Red Bull|McLaren|Mercedes|Ferrari|
|2023|Max Verstappen (Red Bull)|Ferrari|Red Bull|?|Mercedes|
|2022|Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)|Mercedes|Ferrari|?|?|

Will was correct in predicting that the top teams of '21 would still be the top teams going into '25. But he didn't foresee Red Bull's utter dominance of the middle third of the new regulations or Mercedes' struggles with them.

# Miscellaneous Predictions

> Williams have regained momentum and form under the new regulations, picking up podiums and pride.

Not exactly.



>Aston Martin have had a rollercoaster few years. The change in regulation wasn’t kind to the team, dropping them to ninth in 2022, but steady progress in 2023 and 2024 has brought them back up to a competitive space for 2025.  
...  
In 2024 (...) fifth in the constructors’ championship

This is kind of accurate?



> Schumacher moved to Alfa Romeo in 2023 after a second season with Haas in 2022 failed to live up to expectations.

In a way, that 2nd part came true.



>AlphaTauri remained unchanged in 2022 and rocketed to 5th in the constructors’ championship. At season’s end Yuki Tsunoda made way for Liam Lawson and another solid season brought the team home in sixth.

>But Gasly’s defection to McLaren for 2024 left an open door and into it stepped the impressive Dennis Hauger, fresh from the F3 title in 2021 and the F2 crown in 2023 to race alongside Lawson into 2024.

Both AlphaTauri and Dennis Hauger long for the Buxtonverse.","[""Is crazy to even try to guess who'll be on 4 years on the grid. Some of those people are very well around 14 years old.
