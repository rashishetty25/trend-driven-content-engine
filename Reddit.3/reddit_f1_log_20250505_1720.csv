I think there was a point where I got told my engine was running hot during the straight where I overtook Carlos. So, um, there’s always a delay—and there was more delay in that moment.

Because, of course, the two of you worked very well together in Jeddah, sitting in position. But did it feel like there was a big difference to that?\n\n>AA: Um, not a big difference, no. But I think we were just quicker in different parts of the race. I think the first three laps, Carlos was quicker than me—he got past me. I thought I had damage from Turn 3, and I was kind of a little bit in limbo about what was going on with the car. I kind of got into a rhythm, and then I think Carlos used up his tyres, and I knew I had pace.\n\n>We were under threat from the Ferraris behind us, and I just wanted to get on with it. I knew I could catch up to Mark in front of him, and once I got past, I could settle into my own race. So I think Carlos and I were very evenly matched—we’re just quicker in different parts of the race. Jeddah, we worked well together. This weekend, I just felt like I had the pace to get past the cars in front of Carlos. And arguably, I think George got a little bit lucky with the VSC.

Issue #1 - Cutting away at critical moments.
China - Max vs Norris pit exit they cut away to show Leclerc's regular pit stop.
Bahrain - Instead of showwing Piastri crossing the finish line in 1st they showed Norris and Russel who weren't fighting that close.
Miami - Max vs Norris on lap 16 cutting to a replay of the previous overtake.
(So many more examples)

Issue #2 - The timing board not showing the intervals or just not working at all.
Issue #3 - The unnecessarily long shots of someone in the Crowd/VIP section in the middle of the race.
Issue #4 - Taking too long to show a replay of something we missed.
Issue #5 - The lack of Radio Replays & often times the extreme delay of them (Ex. Miami Qualifying- It wasn't until 10 minutes later, after doing the interviews did we get a replay of max's reaction to him getting pole).

This issue wouldn't be much of a problem if all I had to do was switch broadcasting channels, but F1 doesn't work like that because the same display is given to every channel world wide and the best thing I can do is open up all the tabs from multiviewer and make my own version of a TV Directing with the onboards.","['There has been a notable, marked change for the worse.

Personally, I think comparing it to Sochi or Valencia is a bit over the top. Today’s race was pretty solid, especially the first 20 laps with Max going at it with the McLarens. There was genuine tension and some real overtaking opportunities across the track.

That said, I still have gripes. The chicane under the bridge is awful, clumsy and out of place and I really wish there was some grass or gravel to punish mistakes. The ever-present concrete runoff strips the track of consequences and character.

But overall? Miami doesn’t make me nearly as mad as it seems to make some fans. It’s not a classic, but it’s certainly not the disaster people love to label it as.

In Miami the SF-25 was fifth force on the track, slipping even behind Williams, with only small flashes of light with the Sprint Qualifyng of Charles Leclerc (however with a 3 tenths gap) and above all the Sprint Race with the strategy call of Lewis Hamilton. It was certainly the worst performance offered by the Rossa in this championship, which will arrive at Imola with its world championship dreams already compromised and a very deficient car. Frederic Vasseur in the post-race analysed the Ferrari race from pure performance, to problems, to driver management and the near future. \n\n**Vasseur: \'We have to solve the problems in Qualifying. McLaren in race on another planet. Right strategy, we followed our whole rulebook"".**\n\nThe race reads 57 in 57 laps for Ferrari compared to McLaren and this testifies to a very tough time, with a poor performance. ‘McLaren was definitely on another planet, our performance was similar to that of Red Bull and Mercedes’ commented Team Principal, Frederic Vasseur ‘Max tried to stay with them but he totally ruined his tyres’. The Frenchman was asked again about the famous potential of the SF-25 that has been talked about so much, but he has a different idea for this weekend. ""We didn\'t find the best balance. Yesterday we struggled a lot and our best lap in Qualifying came on used tyres; it\'s the first time this has happened in 2 years. This is frustrating. We have to work and fix our problems, one by one, and improve.""\n\nThe pace of the Rossa was significantly lower than that of the MCL39, as mentioned, but Vasseur\'s main focus is on the exploitation of the tyres to make the car run at its best. ""It\'s much more a question of the tyres than the characteristics of the car. At times we were able to extract much more potential from the tyres than this weekend, and from that comes the performance."" Going into the substance of the race, given the lacklustre pace and the fifth force on track - with one Williams in front and the other just behind the two SF-25s - the focus was on the drivers\' team radios and Ferrari\'s race strategy. ""We were the only team to swap on track today, but I think it was the right choice. Lewis had a softer tyre and we wanted to try to catch Antonelli. We followed our internal rules. When we saw that he could not catch Antonelli, we did the swap again,‘ said Vasseur, who defended the team\'s choice. ’It is never easy to ask drivers to give up their position, but they obeyed and I think it was the best choice.\n\nNow there will be a week\'s break and then Formula 1 will return to Europe, with the first of the two Italian races, and Ferrari will have to try to redeem itself at Imola, where Frederic Vasseur is convinced we will see a better SF-25. Will it also be supported by developments? ‘We will have something to take a small step forward and then there will be another step in Barcelona,’ he told Sky Sport F1\'s post-race microphones, but the focus should not be on developments. ‘We have to find the best compromise with the car and put everything together.’']",99,47,0.92,99,475,475,-4,0,0.0,-4

1key7fh,Only 6 times between their return in 2010 and today have Mercedes had as big a margin over the next non Mercedes car as McLaren did today.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1key7fh/only_6_times_between_their_return_in_2010_and/,2025-05-05, Statistics,"McLaren's lead car finished 37.644 seconds ahead of the next non-McLaren car today.

Only 6 times in the most dominant period the sport has ever seen did Mercedes have as big a gap as this at the end of a race,

Spain 2014, Brazil 2014, Spain 2015, Canada 2015, Belgium 2015 and China 2016.

And in all of these races Mercedes were on pole and led going into the first corner other than China 2016 where Ricciardo led into first corner but got a puncture a couple of laps later.

The McLaren's were 3rd and 6th after lap 1 today and still pulled this gap. ","[""That's because they didn't want the FIA to find out how strong their engine was.\n\nMercedes pulled 24 seconds in ten laps in Bahrain 2014 while fighting around every corner, including 4.6 seconds in the very first lap after the safety car restart. They could have lapped the entire field every week if they wanted to.\n\nThis was a huge victory for McLaren but that Merc was something we might never see again."", 'A little side note: Mercedes had the engine turned down for the majority of 2014. Especially at the start of the season. They actually thought they would lap the field if they didn’t turn it down. Which isn’t a crazy thought considering how much better the engine was than Renault and Ferrari.', 'This is so hard to determine though because most dominant teams build a gap and then cruise to the finish. Turning down the engine and just managing the race comfortably. \n\nLook at Bahrain 2014 as an example of just what Mercedes were capable of when they really wanted to. After that late race safety car Hamilton and Rosberg were battling each other fiercely costing each other time and yet they were still pulling out seconds per lap over the 3rd placed car. \n\nOr look at 2021. Hamilton and Verstappen pushed each other all the way and so they were often 1-2 and close together but some 30-40 seconds ahead of their team mates who would be 3rd. This shows just how much they would keep in reserve during their dominant eras and how much they could have crushed the field if they really wanted to push all the way when there wasn’t another driver/team to fight with. \n\nSo ultimately this stat is meaningless because we never see the best of what dominant teams/cars are capable of because they keep it hidden unless someone comes along to push them into revealing their true pace.', 'Thanks for updating this stat. The fact that Max is in contention at all given how 2014/2015 Merc were compared to the rest of the field is incredible', ""McL was dominant today but still not the most dominant we have seen in this period. It's pretty important that they both had to push because they were racing each other and not managing the race comfortably, and the race had no SC/Red flag to close the gaps unlike others, while the VSC gave them 5-10s of racetime to their nearest competitor (VER), who was compromised by RUS a bit at the end as well. Still a scary display, but Merc's equivalent was ridiculous."", 'I have not seen Lando and Piastri fight wheel to wheel.

Couple this with %70 street circuits and you have a snooze fest for the year.

However I do think saying the success of Red Bull in the ground effect era is due to Newey is very overstated. I think Rob Marshall was the key to the RB18’s and especially the RB19’s success. Red Bull’s first upgrade package after Marshall left Red Bull late May 2023 was I think the first upgrade where they claimed they made a misstep. Furthermore, Marshall’s new team is McLaren. After gardening leave he got to work on the MCL38. The first upgrade package was the Miami upgrade. The race which Lando won, and the first race where McLaren made arguably the quickest car. His first full fledged McLaren is this year’s MCL39. While it’s no RB19, it’s eerily similar in high deg tracks. Newey was famous for the suspension design of the RB18, but I think the aerodynamic prowess of especially the RB19 was due to Marshall. ","['Adrian Newey was in F1 when MSC was smashing everyone with Ferrari. He was also in F1 when RBR got smashed by everyone all the time. He is a genius, but it takes more than 1 person to win a WDC/WCC.', ""So Marshall is the water in the tires guy and Christian knows he's doing it because he did it for them - confirmed."", 'Case against Newey? No.\n\n\nCase that Newey wasn\'t the only great man at Red Bull? Absolutely.\n\n\nThere have probably been other great people over the years. But just for one moment people might know. When McLaren realized in front of the DTS cameras they\'d had a terrible miscommunication so the Honda engine didn\'t actually bolt to the chassis correctly.\n\n\nIt wouldn\'t matter if Newey was a total wizard, if he didn\'t have a support staff who could translate that to reality. And I\'m sure in many case, take his general input, and actually iron out the details.\n\n\nIf Marshall has been the magic at McLaren. Zak did a lot to make the team ready to take advantage of it. New facilities, great people, seemingly a good atmosphere. It means a lot.\n\n\nThe old quote that goes something like, ""The more preparation I do, the luckier I seem to be"".\xa0', ""I don't think the two ideas explored here (Rob Marshall was/is a core component of Red Bull's success in the GE era and Adrian Newey is the Maestro who made RBR tick) are mutually exclusive, nor do I think we can weigh the two against each other per se.\n\nNewey has talked repeatedly about how he views himself as leading a team of engineers and designers while still very much being *the*  architect of the cars he's in charge of. Rob Marshall being the chief of car design and implementer of his vision (which I think is the opening anecdote of Newey's memoir) can easily fit the vision of both of them being integral to Red Bull's run of dominance. \n\nI'd also say that the real way to test this would be to see Red Bull having a prolonged run with Newey but without Marshall, and we just don't have that data. The reporting on the Christian Horner sex-pest fallout makes it very clear that Newey was checked out at Red Bull for sometime before the announcement (at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix, which is your inflection point for Marshall at McLaren) that he was leaving Red Bull and that Red Bull technical leadership had been shifting for sometime to the rest of the team.\n\nTo put it differently, I think there's a very strong case to be made that Rob Marshall is an elite designer in the Ground Effect Era, but that's not zero-sum with Adrian Newey not being elite and it's going to be incredibly hard to disentangle the effects (hah) of Marshall from Newey at Red Bull. The best way to test this is to see how next year's Aston Martin (which should be a Newey product) compares to its McLaren competitor, and how they develop from there."", 'Newey might not be the miracle worker some think (watch Aston Martin become championship contenders next year) but the guy still left an huge impact on red bull', 'I’ve always thought that.

More so than anyone else.\n\nYour point about the 2023 Spain upgrade being the first since Marshall left is correct, as is your observation that it was more of a downgrade than an upgrade (which imo should be talked about a lot more).\n\nBut you see between 2023 and 2024 Red Bull did actually make a big step forward amd that was without Marshall and with Newey. Then you can see that the moment he left they no longer understood the car and how to set it up and Pierre Waché doesn’t seem so far to be as capable as Newey.\xa0\n\nAlso we know that in 2022 he personally designed the suspension with the anti dive and anti squat, with the explicit purpose of controlling the ride height and keeping the floor loaded, with ZERO porposing. Because he was familiar with it from his Indy days.\n\nHis last project in his studies was on how ground effect influences sports cars. This meant he knew more than any other designer about it and he’s actually said that he saw porpoising coming before 2022 and THAT is why Red Bull had the least porpoising on the whole grid. The other teams were all caught off guard by it in 2022.\n\nBy the way I don’t think your post is not making some good points but I do disagree with the main message. \xa0Also some people in the comments who know absolutely nothing about the cars are saying some things I strongly disagree with.']",77,33,0.72,77,470,470,0,1,0.0,0

It seems nowadays (maybe because of social media) that the young guns like Kimi Antonelli and Piastri had a lot of buzz around them when they were starting out.

Was it the same for Lewis when he started out? Was he considered some generational type of prospect? He seemed pretty competitive his first year and I believe won a WDC in his second year with McLaren.
","['He got signed to Mclaren at what 13? so yes I’d say he was hyped, and is a generational talent', 'he had the same amount of points as his teammate, the reigning world champion, and missed out on one point in his rookie year for wdc. i assume that everyone knew that he’s the next best thing then', 'At the time is was basically unheard of for a rookie to join a top team. Even Verstappen with all his hype joined the RB junior team. Hamilton went straight into McLaren with equal status to Alonso because they knew how good he was. That told us how good he was.', 'To answer your question, yes, Lewis was indeed a generational talent.\n\nIn his debut year with McLaren, alongside a seasoned Fernando Alonso (let\'s just call him the ""Schumacher Slayer"" for all intents and purposes), he not only outshone his veteran teammate but lost the championship *in his rookie year* by one point.\n\nAs you point out, he went on to win in his second year and would then absolutely *dominate* during the hybrid era while at Mercedes.', 'he would’ve won a wdc on his first try if it weren’t for him getting stuck in a pit entry', 'By people not blinded by race, Lewis was considered generational. Since he was 13 he was expected to be in F1 - and he delivered. Almost won WDC on his first year, won it his 2nd. Lewis was insanely hyped to people who actively followed F1!', 'He was talked about as a potential F1 driver when he was 13 years old. Before my time but massive hype in GP2, was even better than expected as a rookie.', 'People knew Lewis was going to be good. He blew away very strong fields in Formula Renault UK and Formula 3 Euro, and won the GP2 title (as F2 was then known). As a rookie, he came directly into a McLaren team run by Ron Dennis, not a man known for taking chances on unproven drivers. \n\nEven for people who thought they knew how good Lewis was, his performance in his rookie season was astounding. He was on the podium in his first nine starts; won four times. He hardly made a mistake all season until China, when he made the mistake that ultimately cost him the championship.', 'up until 2007, in 57 years of formula one, the best any rookie ever did was to podium their first two races in a row.  i want to say it was chris amon.  lewis did it six times in a row.  the hype was insane, and deserved']",32,78,0.65,32,1417,1417,0,1,0.0,0

1kfddg0,[AMuS] McLaren's secret trick,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfddg0/amus_mclarens_secret_trick/,2025-05-05, News,,"['Translation: \n\n> **The Miami GP was a resounding slap in the face for McLaren\'s rivals. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris beat their closest rivals by more than 37 seconds. The secret, once again, was how the Papaya racers managed tire temperatures.**\n\n> More is not possible. McLaren left Miami with 58 points. A one-two finish in the sprint race, a one-two finish in the main race. Lando Norris was ahead on Saturday, and Oscar Piastri on Sunday. The McLaren drivers had made their task unnecessarily difficult. The two pole positions went to Andrea Kimi Antonelli and Max Verstappen.\n\n> This is proof that the Mercedes and Red Bull cars have the potential to beat McLaren on a single lap. But as soon as McLaren takes the lead in the race, Piastri and Norris disappear over the horizon. It\'s as if they could drive every lap like they did in qualifying. After 57 laps, their lead over third-placed George Russell was 37 seconds and over world champion Verstappen was almost 40 seconds. ""They\'re in a league of their own,"" team principals Toto Wolff and Christian Horner had to admit.\n\n> The match winner was the same on Saturday as on Sunday. The McLarens kept their tire temperatures within the desired range. All the other cars\' tires eventually overheated. In the sprint, the McLaren drivers broke away from the field at the exact moment their intermediates became too hot on the drying track. In the main race, the game was over when Piastri and Norris prevailed against Verstappen. The Red Bull\'s tires were already so close to the red that Verstappen\'s bag of tricks was no longer of any use in defending his position.\n\n> **A completely legal trick.**\nToto Wolff marveled: ""They demonstrate their superiority on every tire type. We have a similarly fast car to them, but only on one lap. McLaren can reproduce that every lap."" His colleague Horner sees differences depending on the track and outside temperature. ""Their advantage is always greatest where the tires are most stressed. That\'s why we looked much worse in Miami than in Jeddah.""\n\n> Conclusion: McLaren must have something beyond high downforce and balanced car balance. Wolff praises the rival: ""They\'re not doing anything illegal. We have no doubt that they\'re operating within the rules, whatever they\'ve found."" It\'s becoming increasingly clear that the McLaren engineers have a clever solution for keeping the tires cool. ""Five degrees makes a huge difference,"" explains Wolff.\n\n> This is precisely what\'s troubling the opponents now. ""We don\'t know,"" asserts the Mercedes team principal. ""But we\'re working hard on it. We\'re not just sitting back and watching, but trying to find the key through experimentation and development work."" According to Wolff, the McLaren secret isn\'t some kind of brainwave, but the product of continuous improvement of the car since the major turnaround at the 2023 Austrian GP.\n\n> **Find the key as quickly as possible.**\nRed Bull is taking a different approach. The dethroned class leader is firing on all cylinders at McLaren in the hopes of eventually hitting the mark. Somehow, people in Milton Keynes don\'t want to believe that everything is above board. But they also have no idea what could be causing McLaren to let its tires caress themselves like that.\n\n> After the Miami GP, team principal Christian Horner initially expressed his conciliation: ""Hats off to McLaren. They taught everyone a lesson today. They\'re doing a better job with tire management than the rest of the field."" On one point, he agrees with colleague Toto Wolff: ""We need to find out as quickly as possible what McLaren is doing. Whatever it is, it could be a match-winner next year as well.""\n\n> Clearly, the trick has nothing to do with the current ground-effect cars. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella, of course, offers no explanation. He only says: ""We have to thank our engineers for creating factors that allow us to keep the tires within their window."" The Italian admits that some aspects can be carried over into the new era of Formula 1, while others need to be adapted to the 2026 cars and their aerodynamics.\n\n> **A clever air circulation.**\nStella also denies that her exceptionally good tire management in the race has nothing to do with the problems that sometimes make it difficult for drivers to set the perfect lap in qualifying. ""We don\'t pay a price per lap for caring for the tires better than others. It\'s no problem for us to get the tires into their working window quickly."" In qualifying, drivers are more likely to complain about a lack of feel for the front axle.\n\n> The opinion is now gaining ground in the scene that the engineers in Woking have found a particularly clever solution for circulating air in the brake ventilation drums, keeping the brakes hot while keeping the tires cool. The external shape of the drums is standardized. Inside, you have complete freedom. You\'re not allowed to install any explicit cooling elements, but you\'re not restricted in the choice of materials.\n\n> An insider speculates: ""Perhaps they circulate the air in such a way that it stays cool in the crucial areas and shield the heat through the use of certain materials."" Chief Technical Officer Rob Marshall is said to be the father of the system. He has been carrying the concept around with him for years, but has only now made it work. That would be bitter for Red Bull. Marshall was at Red Bull for 17 years before moving to McLaren in early 2024.\n\n> Stella also made an interesting statement. ""Even when it gets hot, our car stays cool. We\'ve developed a very efficient cooling system."" This also affects tire temperatures. If the car as a whole gets too hot, it radiates to the tires. Stella\'s statement also explains why the McLaren is near the back in terms of top speed. More cooling reduces efficiency.', 'So basically McLaren could keep dominating into the new regulation unless the others figure out what the magic trick McLaren are doing with the tyres.', 'Signing Rob Marshall was a big coup for McLaren.', '9 other teams HATE this one simple trick.', '>If the car as a whole gets too hot, it radiates to the tires. Stella\'s statement also explains why the McLaren is near the back in terms of top speed. More cooling reduces efficiency.\n\nWould be hilarious if the actual solution is ""we wrapped the power unit in a few extra layers of insulation""', 'TLDR: McLaren keep their car cooler, how? 🤷', 'How much of their dominance comes from finding this “magic trick” versus them finally having use of a new wind tunnel?', 'It’s interesting that Wolff says that the belief is that McLaren have this ‘trick’ from continued improvement since 2023. Because it’s also the same year that Wolff said he didn’t think McLaren had found a silver bullet.

Behind the scenes, hard work is being done to get the adventure off to a flying start, and to ensure that things go smoothly, Audi has adjusted the team's structure. In the new setup, Mattia Binotto has been given a new role. The former Ferrari team boss was previously chief technical officer and chief operational officer, but he has left those positions.

Binotto is now responsible for the overall development of Audi's 2026 Formula 1 car. The Italian has been tasked with optimising the coordination between the chassis and the powertrain. According to the German manufacturer, Binotto must do this by tightening up existing processes so that the development of the technology and the various departments within the organisation run more efficiently.Until now, the chassis and engine were overseen by different managers, but now everything falls under Binotto. It is no easy task, because Sauber has locations in Hinwil in Switzerland and Neuberg an der Donau in Germany, while a development centre is currently being built in England. Binotto is therefore tasked with ensuring that all locations work well together.

Newly appointed team principal Jonathan Wheatley is now solely responsible for the running of the racing activities. Wheatley and Binotto must jointly manage the transformation of Sauber into the Audi works team.

The F1 project falls under Audi Formula Racing GmbH and that branch has undergone further changes. CEO Adam Baker is leaving, making that position redundant. Experienced engineer Christian Foyer is the new operational boss and will focus on the development of the hybrid powertrain.

The way he handled getting past Max this race was a perfect example. He's also one of these drivers that I feel uses his racecraft to maximise results especially on Sunday. Both Alonso and Prost are great qualifiers but where they really stood out against their competitors was their racecraft and race vision, as well aa their competotive mentality. 

Piastri has some amazing overtakes just like the ones Fernando pulls off, like his move on Leclerc in Baku, Norris in Monza, Hamilton in Australia and now the move on Max, amongst others (Austria and Spa) He is also very consistent which are the two strengths of Prost and Alonso. Even when they didn't nail the setup that weekend or didn't have the fastest car, they would maximise the result or atleast finish P2 behind their main rival, (e.g Prost vs Senna or Alonso vs Schumacher) Piastri has done this by always qualifying within a tenth of Pole up until this week and always making the best of the situation despite setbacks (recovering in Australia) 

This season he is especially benefiting from this as his rival - Norris, has similar pace (arguably perhaps slightly better at times) but doesn't have the consistency nor the racecraft to benefit. I am looking forward to seeing Piastri develop and he may well become a driver who is similar in approach and hopefully results as either Alonso or Prost, although the bar is still very high as these two drivers are two of the GOATs imo.","['I agree. Piastri is what Prost always have been during his career, a man of raceday. It reminds me a lot how Prost conducted his McLaren and then Williams both against Lauda and Senna. Exploiting opportunities and results. Chilling blood, clinical. While Max reminds me of 1992 and 1993 Senna, racing with his ass and soul against a much better team with his teammate nowhere near in sight. Norris is... Idk, a better Damon Hill maybe right now.

Fernando not so much lol Alonso is hotheaded as hell!', '100% agree, Prost and Alonso are the best analogs. One of the most impressive things for me is how he’s handled Max. It actually started last season at Abu Dhabi where he showed Max he’s willing to crash and won’t back down. This season he’s used this and Max’s determination to never be out braked to force a mistake at Australia, Saudi and now Miami. He’s so methodical about how he does things and the results were there for all to see yesterday when he beat his slightly quicker teammate. With the caveat that he only has 2 and a bit seasons in F1 Lando still has a tiny advantage over long stints because of his experience with these tires. Oscar is better to much better at nearly everything else. He makes fewer mistakes, drives far more intelligently and takes what’s on the table nearly every time.

1kfb055,Where did drive through penalties go? Time penalties are often not appropriate/enough of a disadvantage. +10 should be minimum time penalty.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfb055/where_did_drive_through_penalties_go_time/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"The last drive through penalty I remember was ~~Hamilton at Silverstone 2021~~. It feels like in the last few years they have been abandoned in favour of +5 time penalties.

We have seen several times drivers not really be affected by a +5. Max has shown them to be worth 'tanking' to get clean air, protect tyres, and pull a gap to neutralise the penalty. He's even gone as far as to laugh them off over the radio. We also saw Haas in Saudi Arabia use the second car to block the following pack to neutralise a penalty.

I just don't think these +5s are enough of a deterrent for the incidents they are usually being applied to.

Thoughts?","['Hamilton got a 10s penalty that race, not a drive through.\n\nAlso, the current regulations require 10s penalties for those incidents, rather than 5s', ""This was discussed last year - and actually the drivers successfully lobbied last year to have the baseline penalty increased to +10, for the reasons you stated. The KMag/Haas battle worked because they essentially tanked KMag's race for him to hold back the others from Hulk - even though he dropped way down, Hulk was protected, so the team net gained from the penalty, regardless of the length of the penalty.\n\nIt has been odd to see more +5s penalties this year. Max's penalty in Saudi was 5, and not 10, likely because it was the first turn in the first lap, so there's usually leniency anyway. \n\nI agree that drive throughs etc. should be used more, and that if you're going to have a penalty system, it needs to be stringent enough to actually deter the behavior it's intended to deter. But I don't know that we're seeing a new trend toward lighter penalties this year, or an overall issue within the penalty system that there has been movement to correct in the last year or so, but the implementation isn't great."", 'Norris received a drive through penalty in Qatar 24 for failing to lift under yellow', 'Yup, we are in a very uncanny valley with respect to penalties at the moment.\n\nThe fix I think is to have permanent stewards so that we get consistent penalties.', 'I fully concur - 10s or more, minimum. Absolutely. Also, I\'d love to see substantially more disqualifications for driving standards.\n\nI don\'t at all buy the argument that strategic acceptance of penalties is ""just driving to the rules the way they are."" That\'s BS. They\'re *rules*. If you\'re playing the game, you\'re agreeing to *rules.* You don\'t just break them when it suits you because you can handle the consequences, you follow the rules because it\'s the sporting thing to do. Taking any kind of penalty because you think it\'ll be a net positive is very, very bad sport. If you like watching that sort of thing, then you must be really enjoying racing that\'s adjudicated off the track and after the race. For me, I\'d rather people drive with intellectual honesty and in the spirit of good competition.\n\nThe cars are still going to go 300kph. Let\'s not pretend like holding people to higher standards won\'t still result in good racing. 90% of the overtakes in Miami were very clean and thrilling to watch.', ""I'm pretty sure that Alonso and Hamilton both got drive throughs last year, and Norris got a stop-go which is even worse.\n\nI do think that in situations like Jeddah the penalty should be that they have to give up the position, and if they don't do so in a couple of laps they get a drive through."", 'Indeed, FIA race penalties are much like government fines for corporation misdeeds (in the US at least).  Just the cost of doing business where the benefit gained is greater than the cost of the punishment.', 'It\'s a bit difficult topic.\n\nWhen DT and stop/go were the only available options, a lot of time, fans lamented that DT was clearly too harsh for some minor infringements, we have to remember that gaps are much narrower and SC more frequent than when the penalty system was devised.\n\nBut now we have +5s penalties, there\'s the issue of the penalty being an actual benefit if the driver manages to complete a pass he wouldn\'t have without it.\n\nMaybe they should switch to a system of ""drop x positions ASAP"" as the penalty, but even with this one, there would be the obvious issue of it being way too harsh to someone who got their 4th track limit strike while being 40 seconds ahead of next competition.', 'Yeah it used to be that every penalty was a drive through.\xa0\n\nHamilton got one in Qatar last year for speeding in pit lane (race director and stewards went crazy that race) but other than that they are very rare. Same with 10 second stop and go penalties.\n\nPersonally I think drivethroughs should be the punishment if you take someone out of the race and it’s your fault.\xa0\n\nIt’s unfair if you take someone out of the race completely and only have to serve a ten second penalty.\xa0']",16,47,0.57,16,44,44,3,1,0.0,3

I have been to a couple Irish pubs for football matches when I was in US, but did not get a chance to meet a lot of fans of my team.

This time for the Miami Race, I met this Australian guy, who was cheering on for Oscar since the beginning of the race, and made it a festival as Oscar overtook Max. He bought a bunch of drinks too.

Apparently his kid used to race with Oscar back in the day. A bunch of us from different nations, randomly started chatting with him and got to know more about him, and basically had a lot of fun. I barely at my phone as I was mostly was either chatting or listening to the stories through out the race, and missed how Ferrari screwed the strategy yet again. And there was one Polish guy among the group, I think who does the drink I got (Heineken) and suggested me a great beer. 

I guess what I want to ask is, you guys have any such stories with you. I bet back in the no internet days, you had more time most of us had the time to talk to people. Have you had any such fun stories? Met random guys who can rally the people and make it a joyful occasion?

1kex0hm,Should Ferrari have swapped the cars earlier?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kex0hm/should_ferrari_have_swapped_the_cars_earlier/,2025-05-04, Discussion,"I feel like a lot of the discussion around this topic is being heavily influenced by Sky sports coverage and Lewis’s radios. But from my perspective, it’s not as clear cut as it seems

But why didn’t Ferrari swap them?

First of all i’ve seen some people saying ‘they kept him behind for 10 laps’ ‘should’ve swapped before they overtook Sainz’. So why didn’t they swap before they overtook Sainz? Lewis just wasn’t close enough. 

The VSC cut Charles’s advantage over Lewis and Charles pit a lap later.

Lap 31: Charles is on one lap old hards that are not properly up to temperature, Sainz gets past and Lewis 2.3 behind.

Lewis does gain about a second that lap on Charles, but Charles is now behind the williams and it’s cold hards vs a lap older mediums, and since Ferrari in particular have faced issues warming up hards, a pace difference is expected

For the next almost lap, the gap lingers around 1.2-1s, but Lewis doesn’t properly break DRS until the VSC is called.

So between lap 30 and the end of the VSC on lap 34, there was no opportunity and Charles uses the VSC restart to get past Sainz and Lewis comes along with him.

The way the overtake happened meant Lewis was instantly in Charles’s DRS. Which means he never actually got into Charles DRS on his own. He had one lap where he was much faster but even over the next lap before the VSC, he couldn’t do much to get into DRS.

But now he’s in it, seems to have the better tires and better pace. Why didn’t Ferrari swap them on lap 35? Well, by the back straight, Sainz is in Lewis’s DRS and Lewis is 0.6 behind Charles at the point where DRS would open. No question that they could not risk a swap then.

What about lap 36? Well back straight, Lewis is almost 0.8 behind and Carlos is still within DRS. No question that they couldn’t do the swap that lap.

What about lap 37? On this lap, Lewis does manage to lose DRS to Sainz but by the back straight? Again over 7 tenths back with Sainz less than 1.2 back. Still way too risky.

What about lap 38? Starting to look more viable as Sainz fell back a bit in the lap but by the back straight he caught up a bit and it’s Lewis 0.6 back and Sainz 1.2 behind again. That’s still a very uncomfortable margin for Ferrari to mess with, considering that Sainz proved that the Williams has the pace to keep a Ferrari behind it. Last thing they want to do is risk losing p8.

What about lap 39? Well that’s when they finally did swap.
Lewis 0.7 behind at the point where DRS opens and Sainz now over 1.6 behind.

By the start of the pit straight Sainz is 0.9 behind Charles. If that’s done a lap earlier that’s 0.5 by the start of the pit straight at least, leaving Charles incredibly vulnerable.

He was head of vehicle performance, not aero or chassis concept, and not responsible for top-level technical direction. At Ferrari, he holds a critical role without a proven record of leading any of this.

The result? Ferrari is heading in the wrong direction, their car concept feels like a patchwork. They messed up their progress from last year which gave me way too much hope, but SF-24 was still spearheaded by Enrico Cardile.

McLaren with Ron Dennis was successful and the way he worked paid dividends until one day it stopped working and it was doing more harm than good. McLaren did not persevere, they didn’t just replace him with someone from within the organisation, because those people were highly likely to do the same thing again. They knew they needed to break the team to the ground, oust those rigid people and rebuild it. It was an incredibly brutal decision to take  and it could have gone very wrong without the right person in charge, but it ended up being the correct one.

It took years for them to make it to a stable level as an organisation before they even started to fix their technical knowledge issues. \n\nWilliams is running the same plan.
