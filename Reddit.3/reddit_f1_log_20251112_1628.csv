1ouzdb2,Has the testing ban/limits stunted Ferrari performance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ouzdb2/has_the_testing_banlimits_stunted_ferrari/,2025-11-12, Technical,"I recently listened to the High Performance Podcast where they spoke with Miki Hakkinen.

And one of the things Miki spoke about was his frustration that Ferrari were able to test so much more than McLaren (or any other team).

He basically said that after a bad race he knew Monday morning, Ferrari would be out on their test track. That as soon as a season was over, they'd be on their test track. And there was no limit to how long they could test for each day.

In contrast, McLaren had to go to Silverstone, where they could only run between 10:00 and 17:00 and it would be raining.

This got me thinking, that a lot of Ferrari's woes have come since the testing ban. Was their test track and near unlimited testing their golden goose?

Do you think Ferrari failed and still struggle with the limited testing? Unable to properly utilise simulation and wind tunnel and much perfered real world running to teat upgrade parts?","['I mean yeah. Thats a given.\n\nA track on the doorstep of your factory that you own will always be a massive benefit to you when you can test on it whenever you want and for how long you want.\n\nFerrari had cars running at Fiorano non stop back in the day.

Ferrari and Lotus were once the only teams with their own race tracks. Lotus had Hethel and of course Ferrari had Fiorano. \n\nOf the two, only Fiorano became a world class facility, and Ferrari used it a LOT. Elio de Angelis famously said he would never drive for Ferrari because he didn't want to live at Fiorano, he may have been exaggerating a little during the 80's but by the time Michael Schumacher arrived at Ferrari in 1997 that's exactly what Michael did - lived in an apartment (Enzo's old apartment actually) right on the circuit. Testing everyday and sometimes into the evening when it was practically dark.\n\nThis was of course a huge advantage for Ferrari and something that by this stage no other team could do."", 'No, i’ve heard somewhere they have the best mechanics and engineers.

However, it impacts all the other teams too. \n\nOther teams have seemingly adapted to the switch and having to use the digital world and simulation.

When the loopholes close they are kind of screwed. I think they used the flexiwing as an example but again I forget.

1ov4dx7,How likely is it that we see a struggling McLaren in 2026?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ov4dx7/how_likely_is_it_that_we_see_a_struggling_mclaren/,2025-11-12, Technical,"Since the season is almost over (both in terms of results and in terms of races) I thought a bit about the next season. With the new regulations coming in in 2026 there will probably be some shuffling in performance between the teams. What I wonder specifically, is how this will affect McLaren.

As we all know, one of the advantages of making your own engine is that the architecture and general construction can be adapted to the kind of car your team wants to build. Now, I assume (maybe wrongly), that the engine freeze from 2022-2025 also more or less locked in the architecture of the Mercedes engine, allowing McLaren to eventually overtake them in performance.

So I wonder (and I hope there is someone more technically versed than me), if there is a chance that the new Mercedes car goes into a different direction than the McLaren and that the McLarens will struggle (at least in the first season) to come to terms with the new engine.","[""As likely as it is for any team.

Then later, there were rumblings that Ferrari\'s engine was good, then Ford, and now former Alpine workers hired at Ferrari are apparenly ""shocked"" at how poor it\'s performing. Point is we won\'t know until testing ends and teams qualify for race 1. And even then, the strongest package can be the least reliable. \n\nSo will McLaren be struggling? To use Max\' odds here: 50%. They either will or they won\'t. That makes next year so exciting.', 'It’s impossible to know but McLaren has done really well with upgrades since they got their new wind tunnel up and running. I think we can expect a competitive McLaren next year based on how the last two years went. Rumors of Merc having the strongest PU will help as well.', 'Obviously, no one knows until the cars hit the track in Australia, but i feel like in addition to them having the Merc engine and being a semi-works team due to the deal they made with Mercedes on that, another thing they have going for themselves is whatever they are doing with development/wind tunnel/correlation has been absolutely working for them for the last 2+ years. I think someone made the point on here that McLaren haven’t brought an upgrade that failed to perform as expected (if not better) since at least the beginning of 2023 .

There are some significant changes to regulations and everyone is pretty much starting from scratch. My bold prediction is that Aston Martin will make a big leap with Newey at the Helm.

I used google colab for this if there is some error don't grill me for it. I just wanted to see what would be the possible combinations for Norris to win the title. If someone finds an error I'll delete the post.  
  
Norris would win the title with just one podium and 3 minimum P5's with Max winning all and Oscar in P2 always. This is the most lazely way Norris could win the title.

I am a Verstappen fan so this is the closest fight we can get for Max to win the title I believe because by the season end Max would have more wins than Lando and that would give the title to Max.

I agree that Oscar's penalty was not right as he got squeezed with nothing else he could have done. If anything it should just be a racing incident. 

  
However, I actually think what happened was that Kimi didnt even know Oscar was there as it looked like he was just aiming straight towards the apex. 

  
This happens way too often where the driver looks to simply not be checking their mirrors. 

  
Nearly every racing sim I play have proximity indicators (red arrow/circle that tells me theres a car alongside). I use these all the time when I am too focused on the corner, and unable to check my mirror/radar. It has saved me countless times. 

  
This is what F1 needs. Some kind of indicator on their steering wheel, a hud, or some audible indicator. I feel like it would improve the sport by making side by side racing more accessible.
