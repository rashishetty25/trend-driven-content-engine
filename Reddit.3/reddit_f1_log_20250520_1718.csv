Without developments, it risks finishing even behind Williams\n\n\n\nThe show of character at Imola helps “breathe,” brings morale (more to Hamilton than Leclerc) but cannot hide the serious troubles of a Ferrari, called this weekend to the Monte Carlo test, on the dreaded slow corners. Focusing on 2026, with rule changes and new superhybrid engines that few like, is crucial. But giving up the fight in the current championship could have devastating consequences on the standings and prestige. That is why developments are essential. Among the most important and long-awaited is the modified rear suspension. It has passed dynamic dyno testing and is being tested in the wind tunnel with different aerodynamics, it will change especially in the attachment area. The goal is to unlock “potential,” a topic that generates disagreements between team principal Fred Vasseur and the drivers.\n\n\n\nWorld Championship still long: you can't win but neither can you give up\n\n\n\nThere are 17 races and four sprints left in the World Championship. The gaps for those like Ferrari who travel far from the frontrunners (McLaren and Verstappen) have shrunk to the point where even teams that previously were not are now a threat. Williams, a team on the rebound, with Albon's fifth-place finish at Imola: 51 points collected, fifth among constructors behind the Cavallino, last year at the same stage of the championship was at zero.\n\n\n\nFerrari, on the other hand, took the reverse route: the average gap from the McLarens was 4-5 tenths, while at the end of 2024 it was around a tenth. The figure takes into account tire differences; this season Pirelli introduced softer compounds. Almost all the teams have met the performance increase forecast, not Ferrari.\n\nSome examples? If the 2024 Rossa had faced qualifying at Imola instead of the current one, it would have been half a second faster.  An enormity that cannot be explained only by errors in the preparation of the launch lap (Vasseur's thesis), by general difficulties in warming up the tires. \n\nThe compromise on heights\n\n\n\nIn Maranello, technical director Loic Serra is juggling two tasks: directing the 2026 group and correcting the SF-25's mechanical problems. It is not an easy job nor one that is quickly solved. Hamilton in recounting Sunday's comeback said the “car came to life.” What does that mean? That it starts going fast when the gasoline in the tank drops below 70 percent. The car's fundamental conundrum is a mechanical one: when the downforce (the force that crushes the car to the ground) shifts back, coming out of corners, the trim adjustments are not sufficient to cover its limits. Compression damages the bottom if the height is too extreme in qualifying, and so one must accept compromise solutions that lose 15-20 load points on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe 2024 wing for Monte Carlo\n\n\n\n The fix is forced, the revised suspension is expected by the British GP at Silverstone (July 6). But first the most decisive Saturday of the season must be faced, in Monte Carlo where something winning will be seen again: in fact, the rear wing of the SF-24 with which Leclerc took pole and then triumphed in the race twelve months ago will be used. It will also be Adrian Newey's first time in an Aston Martin uniform. They tell us in Maranello that someone regretted not taking him. Market research is wide open-the problem is convincing the brains to come."", 'Ferrari had great pace in last race but..... what I can see in race that the car still feels sluggish at tight corners, the rear end is way too slippery and it hasn\'t improved much since Aus.

Red Bull is trying to dethrone its direct rival by any means necessary. Will their strategy work?**\n\n> Max Verstappen recently won four consecutive world championships. But it currently looks unlikely that the Dutchman\'s streak will end this year. The McLaren drivers have settled into the top two spots in the drivers\' standings. Even Verstappen\'s victory at Imola couldn\'t change the one-two lead held by Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris for the time being.\n\n> The Grand Prix in Emilia-Romagna also demonstrated that Red Bull is currently doing everything it can to prevent the impending change of power. With a major upgrade package, the engineers got the RB21 back on track. The setup window was enlarged. Verstappen praised the balance for the first time this year. This also helped keep the tires alive over the race distance.\n\n> Red Bull isn\'t just trying to increase the pressure on its rivals on the racetrack. Hardly anyone in the Formula 1 paddock is as adept at playing the political games off the track as team principal Christian Horner. The Briton is attempting to destabilize the Papaya competition at every level. The goal is to distract McLaren from the essentials and, if possible, artificially slow them down.\n\n> **Water affair hits nerve.**\nThe attacks began during the preseason. First, they tried to lobby the FIA \u200b\u200bagainst the flexible wings. This was immediately successful with the rear wing. After Oscar Piastri\'s victory in Baku, McLaren had to reinforce the flap on the tail unit so that ""mini-DRS"" could no longer occur on the straights. The Red Bull camp also put a lot of pressure on the referees regarding the front wing. However, the rules here will only be tightened in Barcelona.\n\n> Red Bull also tried to spread suspicion behind the scenes that McLaren was filling its tires with water to better control the heat in the rubber. This attempt, however, failed. Both Pirelli and the FIA \u200b\u200bdenied the allegations. There was no evidence of such a practice. But Red Bull at least managed to force McLaren to address the allegations.\n\n> The reaction of McLaren CEO Zak Brown demonstrated that Red Bull had struck a nerve. In Miami, he sat at the pit lane with a water bottle on which he had written the word ""tyre water."" Parallel to this mocking action, the racing team boss publicly complained that Red Bull always only makes allegations behind the scenes. He called on his opponent to lodge a protest. This would allow the accusations to be officially dismissed.\n\n> **Red Bull hopes for escalation.**\nSo far, McLaren hasn\'t been significantly unsettled by Red Bull\'s measures. At the end of last year, the storied team celebrated winning the Constructors\' Cup. And this year, as already mentioned, the Papaya Rockets came out of the starting blocks strong. But Red Bull is far from out of steam. The attacks off the track have continued in recent weeks.\n\n> After the Formula 1 race at Imola, Horner tried to evoke an impending clash between the two McLaren drivers: ""McLaren has two drivers fighting for the world championship. At some point, it always comes to a point where self-interest takes precedence over team interest. That\'s the conflict. They did well and didn\'t collide. It\'s commendable that they\'re fighting each other. But you could see how close it is.""\n\n> Red Bull, however, doesn\'t want to just wait until Norris and Piastri get at each other\'s throats. At the same time, engineers from both Red Bull and sister team Toro Rosso are bombarding the FIA \u200b\u200bwith inquiries about possible technical tricks on the MCL39. The focus remains on how McLaren manages to keep the rear tires within a moderate temperature window, which gives the drivers an advantage on the long runs.\n\n> **TD information released to the press?**\nThe FIA \u200b\u200bsent its answers to Red Bull\'s questions to all teams ahead of the Imola weekend. However, it is understood that the crucial clue was not included. The inquiries have so far gone unanswered. It is somewhat suspicious that the day after the Imola race, various journalists from Great Britain and the Netherlands reported simultaneously on two FIA ""technical directives"" that were sent to all teams before Imola.\n\n> Firstly, this was supposedly a clarification regarding the skid blocks on the underbody. Secondly, the aforementioned communication between the FIA \u200b\u200band Red Bull regarding tire cooling was leaked to selected media representatives. It is suspected that Red Bull itself is behind the story. The idea is apparently to create the impression that the rule changes had an impact on McLaren\'s performance.\n\n> Immediately after the Imola race, Horner had already teased that the team had been surprised by the weak pace of their opponents. However, the Englishman declined to speculate on the reasons. According to McLaren, the track layout, with its many fast corners, was primarily responsible for the fact that they weren\'t able to perform as dominantly as they did recently in Miami.\n\n> **Next dispute in Barcelona?**\nThe next round of the political battle is expected to take place in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhen the new front wing regulations come into force. Opinions on the issue have been divided even in advance. While Horner calls this a significant change, McLaren doesn\'t expect the balance of power to change.\n\n> Things will get especially exciting if the Papaya racers actually lose some of their pace advantage for a long time. Then the McLaren management will have to ask themselves further critical questions about whether the car was actually artificially slowed down. This could cause disruption to the previously smoothly running system. And that\'s exactly what Red Bull wants to achieve.', 'The headline cracked me up, sounds like RBR is trying to initiate a papaya coup.', 'I believe McLaren will be the quickest car all year tbh', ""my theory is that the McLaren has more to come from upgrades, they started the last 2 seasons behind, so likely started the design work of this year's car a little behind too, and spent a large amount of effort on the mechanical platform to give it the race day advantage it has and it's stable platform, probably focusing more on having that ready for the start of the year alongside some aero revisions, since aero can be upgraded in season easier than suspension. plus the front wing they started with this year is unchanged from last year, identical. I reckon the aero was improved but there may be more to come especially at Spain, a few months into the calendar so enough time for a big aero update and when the Flexi wing clampdown comes into force, so they can focus a package to improve the cars down force and cater it to a less flexible front wing. I think there is more to come from the McLaren but that's just my theory.\n\nedit- plus most other teams have bought some form of bigger upgrade this season, mclaren has only bought some circuit specific changes, a small floor test in saudi to confirm changes for bigger updates, and their suspension update this race which is more just reducing blockage and drag than a massive overhaul. so mclaren is yet to bring something big like redbull's changes this and last round"", 'Yeah, they’re already starting to go down the Ferrari road of awful strategy decisions during races and slow stops', 'While it’s a part of the games they all can play in this sport, RB’s insistence to constantly do this to the pack leaders is just annoying as a neutral. Especially considering we sat through their own period of dominance from 2022-23 that was far worse than McLaren’s now.', ""Piastri can't at the very least."", '>Red Bull is trying to dethrone its direct rival by **any** means necessary\n\nBy ANY means? Hm\n\nDoes ""any"" stand for ""any"" or ""all"" in this situation? :)']",9,31,0.64,9,30,30,0,15,-0.07999999999999996,0

1kqqrmy,A call for respect on behalf of Argentine Formula 1 fans,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kqqrmy/a_call_for_respect_on_behalf_of_argentine_formula/,2025-05-19, Discussion,"I deeply regret the inappropriate comments and insults uttered by a small group of people who, perhaps newly familiar with Formula 1, have unfairly attacked drivers and their associates who had some kind of incident or interaction on the track with Franco Colapinto.



I want to make it clear that this attitude in no way represents the feelings of the vast majority of Argentine motorsports fans, and Formula 1 fans in particular. The true followers of this exciting sport greatly enjoy every broadcast, value the talent of all the drivers, and enthusiastically support the career of our representative, Franco Colapinto, without ever resorting to disrespect or verbal abuse.



We sincerely apologize to anyone who may have felt offended by these regrettable actions, which tarnish the sporting spirit and genuine passion we feel for the highest category of motorsports.","['I don\'t think it\'s just a ""small group"" given how we have seen similar grotesque behaviour in other motorsports like Indycar and other sports like football.', 'Does Argentina have a disproportionate amount of teenage boys? Or adults with the same level of maturity?', ""I think the problem is the very big difference between traditional motorsport fans and football fans. There's a group so big on instagram formed by dumbass football fans that watched their very first F1 race last year, honestly anyone who watched F1 before 2024 in Argentina is dying of embarrassment right now. I'd like to bury my head in the ground and hope these attacks never happen again."", 'I think this is a nice post, but the issue is a BIG problem, the pure numbers mean nothing, and the only way to fix it is for other Argentine fans to aggressively call bad fans out and ostracise them from the discussion. \n\nIn cricket we have a similar problem with fans from  a certain subcontinental country - and their ‘support’ just ruins it for everyone involved.', ""Having seen what happened to Callum Illot, I feel like it's not a small group.  I even had people tell me in the wake of the Illot situation that I shouldn't be so sensitive and that was just how people act in Argentine sporting communities."", 'Appreciate your statement, I do believe it is going to take more, louder fellow countrymen pushing back and speaking out. It is a large number, came to F1 only when Franco entered, they did it at Williams, then Alpine even before in seat, then death threats, then racial slurs. All escalated. It’s going to be a long season of this if not curtailed. There’s various utube channels that claim to be Franco supporters that are nothing more than hate chambers. If he does well, they bash his team mate (Albon, Gasly) if he doesn’t do well they bash TP and even mechanics with outlandish claims. Think at this point there would be backlash for Williams if he ever were to return as this fan base goes against the new ethos. Argentine Sports/Racing Federations should speak out and folks should file complaints with utube. Alpine (Flavio, Franco) and FIA need to issue harsher statements calling out fanbase and referencing Doohan and Yuki incidents by name. Vague PR statements are rather offensive. Think FIA should fine teams for fan behavior like in other sports leagues. FIA implemented new rule at beginning of year stating negative comments lead to online abuse but it was in protection of stewards and race officials with fines for drivers and teams. Where’s the decisive action to protect drivers? Something has to change. Even with intense rivalries of past, this isn’t how F1 should operate as a brand and this should not be an acceptable new norm. It hurting drivers, they need ACTION, that includes hurting Franco’s own career.', 'In summary, social media and echo chambers have made it easy for a “vocal minority” on instagram to hurl racist abuse at competitors in “support” for “their” driver. \n\nThis is sadly nothing new - see the extremist arms of popular drivers’ fan bases who shout vile things at one another online. The internet has made this acceptable. \n\nThis isn’t just an Argentinian fan problem. See also the racist abuse hurled at black British football players after the Euros.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is half the shit people say online they wouldn’t have the balls to say in person.', 'Nah fam, I agree it’s not all argentinians, but it’s not a small group either. This is not the first time of the first sport where this happens.', ""The same thing happened with Augustin Canapino and Callum Ilott in Indy car tho. And other drivers in Indy that Argentine fans didn't like for whatever reason.""]",0,157,0.4,0,1277,1277,0,0,0.0,0
