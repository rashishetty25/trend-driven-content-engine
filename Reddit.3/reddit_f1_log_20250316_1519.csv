With Max behind me because you see what like a drying line and a better line and as soon as you out brake yourself by a metre you pay the price immediately and it can be game over. You're playing with fire for a lot of races like today, trying to push the limits and having big snaps, and almost crashing a lot of times. Plus the level you gotta be at to try and win the race with a driver like Oscar and a driver like Max. So tough, stressful but we made just the right decisions at the right time, that's what won me the race as well as good pace and good driving but strategy was also a winner today so i gotta thank the team for that"", ""I think he realised how lucky he got when he and Oscar went off and that the roles could have easily ended up reversed and Lando been the one to have gotten stuck.

No need for team orders yet."", 'He did great. But the stupid team order when piastri was lining up for an overtake was disgusting .

I had a feeling that the best he could manage and clutch was P2 anyway, no matter what they had tried to do. I forgot that the overheating of those tyres had played a part in scaling back the overall car performance. His race management was fantastic. Verstappen, as a driver in tricky conditions and a competitor to the front, should not be dismissed easily in the slightest. \n\nI am pretty interested in seeing how Verstappen can extract the most out of the car this season. He seems to have a mighty knack for it, and he can give the frontrunners a run for their money. This season is Norris' to lose so if Verstappen manages to bring the fight to McLaren, it is going to be peak"", 'The conditions were very strange in that moment. I was sitting in the grandstand at the final corner, just one corner after where Lando and Oscar went off and only about 100 metres away, and there were barely even a couple drops of rain when they went off, and it took probably about 2 more minutes before it started to properly rain. The rain that took Lando and Oscar off was extremely localised.', '**Q: Alright, very well done to you. Max, let\'s come to you now. You ran Lando very close at the end. What were you thinking? Just one more lap?**\n\nMV: No, not so much, to be honest. I just tried my best, tried to be close, tried to put a bit of pressure on, but it\'s very hard to pass around here. There was only one line. Even if I had gotten a run into whatever, Turn 9, you have to go onto the wet part, so you can\'t really do a lot. But at least it was close. It looked good on TV.\n \n**Q: Can we talk a lot more about the rain? Tell us about the call to stay out one more lap?**\n\nMV: Two more laps! We were on the Medium, and of course, you never know how that\'s going to work out. But I thought it was quite a sensible call with 15, 16, or 20 laps to go when the Safety Car came out. Then, of course, it started to rain. I saw them go off in front of me, kept it clean, and when I saw Oscar rejoining, I thought, ""Well, let\'s stay out,"" because it was only those three corners. The rest was still dry. When I continued, basically, the first two sectors were fine – it was just if I could survive the final sector. I think that lap I did was okay. If there wasn\'t much more rain coming, I thought it could work. You also have to factor in that even if they caught me on an Inter, they’d have to box again for slicks, if it’s not going to rain anymore. So, it was fine. I thought, ""Yeah, we\'ll do another lap,"" but then, unfortunately, on that lap, the first sector was still okay-ish, but then in Sector 2, it started to rain a bit too much and we had to box. But in hindsight, it wouldn\'t have mattered. If I’d boxed with Lando, it would have been P2. If I’d boxed the next lap, it would have been P2. And the lap that I did box, I was also P2. So, we tried something else—it might have worked. In a way, it didn’t work, but we didn’t lose any position, so it’s fine.\n \n**Q: Max, when you think where you and the team were at the start of the weekend on Friday after practice, how satisfying is this P2?**\n\nMV: I think it\'s good compared to the teams behind us. But if you look at the first stint, we were quite a bit off. As soon as the tyres started to overheat, we had no chance. McLaren just took off. So, we still have a lot of work to do to fight for a win. But yeah, I’m happy that we are second here. It\'s basically one place better than we should have been. And it\'s 18 more points than I had last year at this race.', 'The thing is that if Verstappen had pitted the lap after (instead of two laps after), he could have overtaken Norris. In the first half of his outlap, Norris was struggling to keep up with Lawson, so he was losing time.', 'It was the reverse Sochi 2021 I feel, where back then Lewis pitted immediately when things went south but Lando decided to stick out and then faced the consequences.\n\nWhile in this case Max didn’t pay as much of a consequence, Lando made the earliest call to pit in before anybody else and turned out to have made the right decision. As that race was one of the biggest heartbreaks since I started watching F1, this was a very, very rewarding moment for me. Your favorite driver is learning from the mistake he’s made 4 years ago! Sochi 2021 died so Melbourne 2025 could live.', 'Possibly, but that’s when you only look at Lando. At that point, they still thought that he might be able to stay out on slicks, so if he pitted, he would lose out to the Ferrari’s. In hindsight, this wasn’t the case, but still. \n\nAnd that is assuming he actually had a big enough gap. I remember seeing Norris 21 seconds behind as the biggest gap. Would that have been enough?', ""Lando was bugging his engineer to pit early instead of late as soon as he found out that the rain would be Class 3. He even reiterated the plan before the safety car restart. Then, maybe about half a lap before he went off, Lando said that they should pit because he was starting to struggle a bit. You could see the extremely localized spits of rain on his onboard camera. It's almost good that he went off in sector 3 and could pit immediately because McLaren really didn't want to pit too early and that forced everyone's hand and made their decision for them.\n\nI agree with you. I was getting Sochi flashbacks, and I wasn't even the one in the car! This felt like a redemption race for that day. \n\nI stand by the fact that Lando is and has always been very good in the wet, but it felt like the first time he was able to show that he could hold his own in wet/changing conditions while the spotlight was on him.\n\nIn fact, I feel like this race was a small answer to a lot of the criticism he gets. Bad in the wet? Wet race. Poor starts? Kept P1 throughout multiple restarts. Falters under pressure? Keeps it together with a charging Verstappen right behind him in the wet. Emotional communicator? Was extremely calm and clear on the radio.\n\nI was already happy for him even before the win was secured. There's been a lot of growth all around."", 'Correction, Lewis wanted to stay out but Mercedes forced him to pit while McLaren was talking in riddles to Lando.', ""Yes, I actually think that they did not pit because they were more concerned by Ferrari than Norris, especially in case of a safety car, which eventually arrived but too late for Ferrari. Maybe a bit of greed on their side. \nI haven't watched back the gap to Norris, but for sure it would have been a tight battle at the exit of the box"", 'One of the perks of following Lando around is seeing his growth.

1jcfw84,Things we (re)learnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jcfw84/things_we_relearnt/,2025-03-16, Discussion,"1. McLaren: well-balanced car. The Drivers gotta step-up and minimize mistakes.


2. Max: pure talent, man! A class driver —and Lando knows it. One mistake, and Max will be right there, ready to snatch away points from you. Especially when it rains.


3. Russell: He drives.


4. Norris vs Piastri is loading. Rivalry within house is gonna be fun for us, headache for Brown and opportunities for Max.


5. Hamilton is learning, so is Ferrari.


6. Williams and Vowles are cooking. Hope it doesn't end up like Aston Martin in 2023.


7. For me, the back-markers are still unclear. Ferrari, despite fighting with Williams and Alpine, will soon catch up to be among the front-runners or at least the lower front. Mercedes is in the upper midfield, and maybe Williams too. Alpine and the rest, including Aston Martin, seem more like mid to lower midfield teams. Sauber and Haas will probably eventually end up being the tail of the pack, but for now, I think they can still catch up to RB, Alpine, and Aston Martin. I'm not convinced yet on who will be the lapped cars.


8. Rookies are adapting among big shots. They'll deliver soon.


Edit: some additional points I should've added + elaborating few.

9. Lando deserved that win—he drove brilliantly, and praising Max or discussing mistakes doesn’t take away from that. But we all know how even a small mistake can cost him dearly. I agree with Crofty that he could have suffered the same fate as Oscar with that mistake, and no, that mistake wasn’t small—c’mon, guys. As for Max, it’s clear he can deliver even without being in a rocket ship.

10. Mercedes vs Ferrari: Many pointed out that Mercedes was faster than Ferrari, and I agree. However, Ferrari has the advantage of a seasoned (legendary) driver. Both Kimi and Lewis will need some time to settle in, and as I mentioned elsewhere, opinions might shift as the weeks and races progress. That said, we’re not quite at the point where we need to discuss Ferrari’s No. 2 driver—lol.

11. Piastri: Some people don’t see him as ready for a championship battle yet, but I believe he has the potential. In my opinion, he can deliver.

12. Kimi: He’s getting the hang of the car. I’d love to see him and Ferrari battle in the coming days.

13. Yuki: He had a great race—until he didn’t. We’ll often hear him and Liam in the same sentence this year.","['George:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1ihmdnn40pe1.jpeg?width=783&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69b5fb3771009894d07285ddb89c9785c5f2fb65', ""McLaren >>> Red Bull > Mercedes >> Ferrari for me. \n\nStrategy aside, Ferrari's pace wasn't great either day."", 'We have to give Lando credit for his restarts today.

Then race is hard to judge cars pace as Verstappen and Russel are the two best wet weather drivers on the grid imo.\xa0\n\nBut that Racing Bull had quite a few updates from fasting, and damn it was fast.\xa0', 'The biggest loser is me for waking up at 4am to see Ferrari start P7 P8 and end P8 P10', 'I find it hilarious how Stroll basically had the same race as Kimi and got no credit from anyone.', 'Because their strategists are baboons and have been for ages.', '>How Racing Bulls got no points is just mad.\xa0\n\nThey wanted one last farewell to danny ric by giving Yuki an Hungary type of Strategy', 'Racing Bulls went to the Ferrari school of strategy', 'Racing bulls should be banished to the shadow realm for the strategy call today.', 'Probably because Stroll is an 8-year veteran and Kimi is an 18 year old rookie…? Haha, what did you expect?', 'Well not really..\n\nStroll started 13th, Kimi 16th\n\nStroll didn’t overtake anyone (at least in memory), Kimi did like 5 times (Hulk twice, Stroll twice, Albon) \n\nOvertaking in the wet, especially when not just at a restart is deceptively hard these days. See Lewis stuck behind Albon, or even just think back to Brazil. Most of the other overtakes in the race were because the driver in front made a mistake.\n\nKimi was close to the pace of Russel, even when driving through the midfield where traffic and spray was worse, and Russel had no one around him out front.\n\nAnd the most relevant difference is that Kimi is an 18 year old rookie. The youngest rookie, with the least experience. And yet he kept the car on track, performed overtakes and kept a great pace. In his first formula one race ever.  \n\nMeanwhile the fate of the other 5 ‘rookies’ was DNS, 3 DNF’s and one last place. Of course Antonelli is going to stand out.']",25,20,0.86,25,19,19,25,20,0.86,25

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Charles- Has absolute pace but can be inconsistent and is not great in mixed conditions.
