For me, I think it will end up being Perez and Jak Crawford. I think they'll want a young driver and a vet. Bottas is probably the best vet available, but it will probably be Perez because he's from Mexico and can bring big sponsor money and a lot of Mexican fans.
And Jak because I think they'll want a young American driver and I don't think that Herta is as strong a connection as it was before.

I think it should be Bottas and Yuki. Yuki doesn't have a contract for next year and even though he's not so young anymore, he still has potential and hasn't gotten the shot he deserves. And Bottas is the best vet available.

And I personally would love for it to be Bottas and Mick Schumacher. This is meant to just be who you would love to see, I know this won't happen, I know that it shouldn't happen, but man I really want to see Mick drive anything other than a Haas. Him and Valterri are my favourite recent drivers.

Piastri has the talent, but he couldn't deliver every weekend last year. But when he did, he was sometimes even faster than Lando.

However, when Norris had his Singapore-level pace… nobody could catch him—except himself, almost crashing into the wall.

Can Norris handle the pressure if the car is the fastest and he has bad luck or poor performances? Or maybe we'll see Norris 2.0 with no mistakes, crushing everybody. Or maybe Piastri will get as comfortable as he was in the lower categories, where he won almost every race…

All in all, I'm very excited for the new season! Hopefully, it will be a tight season with more teams fighting for wins than just one.
