1i9ojre,The FIA swearing ban is mentally insane.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i9ojre/the_fia_swearing_ban_is_mentally_insane/,2025-01-25, Discussion,"What on Earth was MBS thinking when he drew up those rules? Penalty for friggin swearing? Race ban threats? Thousands of Euros in fines?

I think this is too much. Almost every F1 driver swears, and these new rules are a recipe for disaster, both in F1 and in other FIA series.

The average accrued penalty points by the end of the first season of these rules will be worse than Lord Mahaveer's F2 season.

And not just that, it's in the Motorsport Code, meaning it won't just be F1 that's affected; F2, F3, FE, WEC, it will apply to anything FIA-regulated.

How long until an F1 race has as many starters as Monaco '96 had finishers? How long until an LMP2 driver wins the 24 Hours of Le Mans because most of everyone in the Hypercars said a bad word?

These new rules are a powder keg. I can only hope they'll be taken out.","[""All of the F1 drivers should get together every GP and swear like sailors. \n\nLet's see the FIA ban all 20 drivers."", 'I feel like anyone who is surprised by this hasn’t been paying attention.

1ia1n64,The Drivers Should Threaten to Boycott 2026 Over the FIA’s New Rules,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ia1n64/the_drivers_should_threaten_to_boycott_2026_over/,2025-01-26, Discussion,"My initial feeling was that they should just strike for the first 3 races of 2025, but admittedly a lot of fans have already bought tickets, and while most real fans would understand why it was happening, some people may still be upset at the drivers. 

So instead the GPDA should issue a statement that says ‘If anyone is punished based on these ridiculous rules this year, we guarantee that NONE of us will race in 2026’. 

What, they’re going to risk the first season of their new regulations being made up of reserve drivers and F2 drivers? No one would buy tickets to next years’ races, and We all know F1 is about the bottom line. 

Realistically, I know there are contracts in place that make this difficult, but I’ve got to imagine that the teams stand behind the drivers more than the FIA. 

Even just say Max and Lewis doing it could be enough. Nevermind if Charles/Lando/George join in.

The drivers hold more power in F1 than FIA because people pay to see the drivers race, to hear their thoughts, see their personalities etc… not see what ridiculous rules the FIA can come up with next. The drivers can shut this whole thing down. 

I hope they flex the power they have.

1iads2c,With redbull losing Honda and Newey does that open the door to Ferrari and McLaren?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iads2c/with_redbull_losing_honda_and_newey_does_that/,2025-01-26, Discussion,"I think redbuls dominance as much as Max is hood, it was due to Honda. Yes they take over the Honda power train and become a constructor, but they lost the expertise of newey. As a new constructor I just think they are at a loss losing newey to aston.

With Aston in early 2024 showing they are up there, with newetu it may make Alondo thst much more competitive  as the car takes leaps and bounds to be a winning car that's to jewery.

Am im giving too much credit newey? Is he not actually that good?

Anyway I think redbull is on the decline. Max maybe a tops driver, but I think the 2025 car will struggle against McLaren and Ferrari due to the inexperience of being a new constructor and the lise of newery. Max's work is cut out for him, tho Liam will be a good now driver so might help Max  dive some, take out threats? As Liam knows his place and would want to keep his RB seat?

The 2025 season maybe epic... teams seem to be on equal footing as they lose and gain expertise.

The lol will be id Newey designs a car that puts Lance on the podium more often than not.
