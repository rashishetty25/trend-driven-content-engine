1h1y0bh,How bad is Perez doing right now? Comparisons with Gasly and Albon‚Äôs final 10 results for Red Bull.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1y0bh/how_bad_is_perez_doing_right_now_comparisons_with/,2024-11-28, Statistics,"10 races was the number used as Gasly has 10 race finishes in Red Bull - in order to minimise swings in his relatively small dataset, the most recent 10 results from each driver were used (so most recent 10 finished races, with DNFs - both classified and not - excluded, along with exclusion of Gasly‚Äôs DSQ in China 2019 Qualy). Where a result is excluded the next most recent race is added to the dataset (so in exchange for excluding Perez‚Äôs COTA DNF, we count back and include Silverstone as our 10th)

Qualifying results are the top table, as you can see Albon has the highest average qualifying results with Gasly not far behind. Perez lags behind significantly.

In terms of race results, Gasly has the best average placement and scored the most consistently, though crucially Albon got two podiums in this period. Again, Perez lags behind.

 Race start numbers for each driver being assessed are:

* Gasly - 27-39 (Australia - Hungary 2019)
* Albon - 28 - 39 (Belgium - Abu Dhabi 2020)
* Perez - 271-283 (Silverstone - Las Vegas 2024)

As you see, Gasly and Albon‚Äôs level of F1 experience is well matched during these periods. Perez is significantly more experienced than both.

Points totals in these periods (excluding sprints as these didn‚Äôt exist in Gasly or Albon‚Äôs tenure) are -

* Gasly - 63 (2x FL)
* Albon - 65
* Perez - 33 (1x FL)

So again, Perez is lagging behind both Gasly and Albon.

All 3 stints were done in cars which were clear of the midfield cars behind them. The Red Bull was 3rd best in the grid at the time Gasly drove it, 2nd best at the time Albon drove it, and has swung a little while Perez has but we can be conservative and say 3rd best. All three cars were certainly good enough to make it to Q3.

During the assessed periods Max scored:

* With Gasly - 4 podiums (2x P1, 2x P3)
* With Albon - 5 podiums (1x P1, 3x P2, 1xP3)
* With Perez - 5 podiums (1x P1, 3x P2, 1x P3)

So all cars were at points capable of a win, and certainly capable of podiums.

Based on this I would say that Perez‚Äôs recent form is the worst of the three stints. ","[""It's crazy how ruthless Red Bull used to be compared to how they are today"", 'I‚Äôve seen enough, give him a 5 year contract', ""Gasly and Albon had significantly worse cars that weren't title contenders."", ""These sorts of comparisons aren't very helpful.

there is now a proposal for the President and Deputy-Presidents to be paid salaries. While I think it is a good idea in principle ... the problem is that getting a salary is actually against the ... Association Loi of 1901 which exists for non-profit entities in France.

This is a problem that Max Mosley ran into years ago when he tried to move the FIA to Switzerland and subsequently received a tax demand from the French government  ... Today the FIA remains under French law because it does not want to settle a tax bill and leave. However, there is a Swiss version of the federation as well. The two FIAs have consolidated accounts, but they are run under different sets of laws.

This .. worked fine until the President tried to claim expenses for his own private jet from the French FIA. He does not need the money (he comes from a mega-wealthy family) but he wanted to use the money to establish a fund that would be distributed to small FIA clubs around the world which struggle to pay their bills. ... it was pointed out that this scheme might be misinterpreted when there was an election ... as a way to buy votes ... 

...the audit committee questioned the idea and since then several of them, including the president Bertrand Badre and Britain‚Äôs Tom Purves, are no longer involved. This may also be why there have been changes on the ethics committee as well, and the reason that the compliance officer has just departed.

so many FIA people have left during Ben Sulayem‚Äôs presidency that they could all get together and organise conferences to discuss their stories. The latest to go, I am told, are two stewards: Tim Mayer of the US and Singapore‚Äôs Janette Tan.

I honestly think if you could put Bottas in for a one year contract until Red Bull decide on a younger driver, that might be the best option. 

As others have said, Bottas is a very capable driver, but with minimal ego.  He would probably be a great support for Verstappen without getting in his way.  

The fact that Bottas could keep in sight of Hamilton (and sometimes outqualifying him) when Hamilton was at the peek of his performance speaks volumes at what an underrated driver Bottas is.

1h28yc1,Formula 1 Draft ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h28yc1/formula_1_draft/,2024-11-28, Discussion,"Alright, so first off, I‚Äôm European and usually think drafts are kinda stupid. But could it work for Formula 1? Probably not, but let‚Äôs theorize anyway.

F1 doesn‚Äôt have promotion or relegation, so that‚Äôs one point in favor of introducing drafts.

Here‚Äôs how I think it could work: Instead of F1 teams having their own academies, we‚Äôd put the financial strain on F2 teams. Their whole goal would be to get their top talent drafted by an F1 team. The F1 teams would have to pay the F2 teams for their drivers, so the F2 teams could fund academies and support drivers early in their careers‚Äîor just employ a pay driver to keep the bills paid when talent is low.

Also, no clue whether the worst teams should get the first pick or the last. What do you guys think would be most fair for the sport and the drivers?

Again, this was just a random idea to theorize about.","[""My favourite part of Formula 1 is when there is no formula. Adding structure and rules like this solving a problem by adding hurdles and schemes and eventually more problems.\n\n\nTeams from F2 on down should not be strained and trying to make constant elevators for a volume of drivers that will not make it. Especially in years when there is no change at the top level of the sport. F1 is not notoriously a turnover industry. Alonso has danced with a number of trams for nearly 20 years. Add into the mix of Hulk, Perez, Bottas, Magnussen, Ocon, Sainz, and Ricciardo that have all been about for nearly a decade. It's not that they exited the sport, but rather rewoven into new teams many times. Sure, eventually all drivers are cut or retire for good, but it's not like all 20 drivers turnover in 3 years. We are going to have Max, Lando, Leclerc, Piastri, Russell for a while. Stroll is going to cling. Albon is present. Hamilton is present. Yuki is present.\n\n\nWe probably get a strong rotation of drivers within two years, but it will go back to regular faces holding seats for a decade.\n\n\nAnd it is still very enjoyable. They are amazing."", ""What happens when there aren't f1 seats open, and you do realize f2 is already 90% billionaire kids and 10% f1 driver academy kids, yours would make it 100% billionaire kids, and less f2 teams because there's less money being piped in."", 'What if there aren‚Äôt open seats?', ""See, these things work in most American sports largely because the college system pays for itself either by tickets, donors, and even government money. So professional leagues get to draft from the very healthy college systems. \n\nF2 doesn't make a lot of money. Probably more now than it used to. A few name sponsors like Lucas Oil have come in. But mostly it's funded by the drivers. And some of those drivers are funded by F1 teams.\n\nIn every draft I'm familiar with, worst team picks first, or there's a lottery among the worst half of teams, with the worst teams getting more of a chance, if they don't want teams tanking to get a good pick."", 'Oh brother', 'Let‚Äôs just make all 20 drivers free agents, put the 10 teams in a hat, draw the draft order, and watch the chaos unfold.', ""Why?

Now every driver is free to agree with any team."", ""You're trying to compare Formula 1 to the NFL, MLB, NBA and the NHL who hold drafts every year.\n\nExcept each team has 15-50 players, and they can rotate them out as needed. It makes no sense to do that if you only need 2 players/drivers. On the major leagues, players get injured, let go, or they retire every year, there are always spots because there are tons of teams looking for new talent.\n\nAt most we might get 1-2 reserve drivers per team and that's the roster.\n\nThey might be better off doing a draft to hire new mechanics, as there's more of them needed"", 'FFS it‚Äôs not even the off season yet and we‚Äôre already getting inundated with shit posts']",0,22,0.12,0,52,52,0,0,-0.03,0
