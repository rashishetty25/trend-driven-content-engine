Alonso was in points, so they decided to get Alonso on a more conservative strategy. The only bad thing about the inter-to-slick pit was that it was too soon, they should have pitted Alonso two or three laps later, but at the same time it was time to take some risks with Alonso as he could be out of the points.\n\nI see it more as a stroke of good luck for Stroll than Alonso being unlucky again. I can only wish he could get more of those strokes', 'The biggest problem was that when his inters were dead they pitted Lance instead of him gifting him track position over Alonso making him lose a huge amount of time\n\nNot just that the slick call was way too early', 'For not the first time this season, the lower qualifying positions use a gamble strat and wins big. Haas has done it a few times.\n\nUnfortunate for Alonso, but they’re always going to play it safer for the driver who’s starting in the top 10.', 'I love Fernando in F1 but he could be winning in other categories with teams that actually value him.', ""Stroll was just in the absolute perfect position to swap onto softs under the second VSC, since they knew he wouldn't lose too much track position (did he even lose any positions?) and would come out ahead of the existing slick runners. And then he was in the exact right place when the rain started to fall, to get off the slicks and onto new inters. I think frustration at how well that worked out led to the Alonso-onto-mediums gamble, which was just way too early at that point."", 'As much as I loved seeing a Hulk podium, I reckon Alonso could have held the P3 much more convincingly to have had the outside podium chance.\n\nWhilst I also get that Stroll\'s strategy was more of a ""fuck it, we\'ve got nothing to lose""; it\'s baffling that they wouldn\'t listen to their lead driver on strategy calls.\n\nIt reminds me of some of Vettel\'s final races; granted the circumstances were a bit different, but the Aston strategy calls when he was the lead car almost appeared to be in favour of getting Stroll a point, instead of consolidating the 8 / 10 / however many points that Seb was running in at the time', 'Got absolutely screwed. Same as when Gasly threw gravel on the track just ahead of him in Australia in low visibility conditions and when his engine expired in Monaco.\xa0', 'Stroll gets ""experimental"" strategies actually more often than people probably realize - he tends to qualify significantly behind Alonso / way too far away from points. It doesn\'t always work, in fact it doesn\'t most of the time but when it does it yields some very good results. \n\nFor Alonso, the big problem is, I noticed, is that the team is just very slow to react. Undercuts almost never happen, Alonso is often left out 2-3 laps longer than he should be, the tyre dropoff is also brutal on the aston which makes things much worse.', 'Alonso was basically given the same strategy as the frontrunners staying out and then pitting for fresh inters on lap 11 which most of the grid did. Hulkenberg was the first driver to pit for inters on lap 9, then Stroll and Hadjar both pit for inters on lap 10, before everyone else followed on lap 11. \n\nAt the time Alonso was up in P6 only behind both McLarens, Verstappen, Hamilton, and Gasly. I think Stroll had a lot less to lose being further back so he pit first for softs on lap 7 during the VSC, a very bold call that no one else on the grid did.\n\nSo I agree with you that Alonso was more so unlucky that he lost out because Aston Martin were playing it safe as he was already high up in P6, whereas they gambled with Stroll and actually benefited massively. \n\nBut they later also took a gamble with Alonso as he was the first car to pit from the second set of inters and switch to slicks on the mediums, which turned out to be several laps too early. \n\nOverall Alonso was just unlucky when it came to the strategy calls. So more bad luck for him which is kind of how most of his career has been.']",128,34,0.97,128,31,31,11,0,0.0,11
