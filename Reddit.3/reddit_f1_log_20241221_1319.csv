Names like [Tazio Nuvolari](http://www.grandprixhistory.org/nuvo_bio.htm) (regarded by those with long memories as Italy's greatest driver), F1 champion [Nino Farina](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/hall-of-fame/Nino_Farina.html), 6-time German GP winner [Rudolf Caracciola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Caracciola) and 2-time Le Mans winner [Raymond Sommer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Sommer) all competed, as did the early giants of F1 like Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Mercedes (buoyed by financing from apparent motorsport fan Adolf Hitler). Some of the circuits - Spa, Monza, Nürburgring - will also ring a few bells. It's not hard to imagine that the championship would have carried on for decades to come if not for a [small incident in Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland). \n\nThe points were a little different...\n\nFor starters, the winner was the driver with the *fewest* points. 1 for a win, 2 for 2nd, and 3 for 3rd. To illustrate how unreliable cars could be, literally anyone else who completed 75% race distance got 4. 5 for those over halfway, 6 for quarter distance and 7 for lining up. Wake up late? To encourage participation, absentees or disqualifiers got a full 8 points. \n\nThe table shows how that might look today. To be fair, it's not an awful way of determining the top eight.

1hj6lwe,What makes a race exciting?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hj6lwe/what_makes_a_race_exciting/,2024-12-21, Discussion,"Hey guys, for a little personal data science project I'm trying to determine, based entirely on statistics, which races are the most exciting of all time. 

I'm doing this by assigning scores to things such as number of overtakes, number of safety cars, number of DNFs etc. and ranking them based on these scores. 

So my question to the F1 community is: What do you feel makes for an exciting, interesting race? 

It should be something that can be quantified like the stats I mentioned, so stuff like the atmosphere at the track or the celebrities present don't make for great data. Let me know what you think!","['Jeopardy. It doesn’t matter if the eventual victor started on pole and lead every lap. What matters is how they get to the chequered flag first.

This can bei weather Changes (rain, drying track etc) but also safety Cars from Crashes.', 'as FOM are now noticing, ""excitement"" isn\'t something that can be just measured with quantifiable factors.

I.e if different people win, it\'s automatically more interesting.\n\nAlso an easy one to statistically generate I\'d assume, is one I\'d recommend adding: total time the difference on track between 1st and 2nd is under 2s.\n\nId also add something like ""is 1st currently not the fastest on track"", as that ""hunt"" from someone behind is often exciting.\n\nAlso, I did a project very similar to this (just a different sport and obiective) back when I was at uni, so if you want any help feel free to DM me. Was a lot of fun tbh, but the major issue I can see you have is that you don\'t have ""true values"" for how interesting the races objectively were, so build models around.

Admittedly, this stat does fall over a bit if you consider the predecessors of these two respective teams. Toro Rosso had previously been Minardi, and Minardi never won a race, but Red Bull have their origins in the Stewart team (via Jaguar), and Stewart did win one race - Johnny Herbert won the 1999 European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring.

If you watch *turns 3 and 4*, it's pretty clear how much faster Mercedes was than the rest of the field. Hamilton and Rosberg were already pulling away, and it wasn’t even close. The gap they built up, even early in the race, was impressive. It’s wild to think back to how much quicker they were compared to everyone else, even on a track like Bahrain.

It made me wonder – what other races do people remember where a team was just so much faster than everyone else? I feel like we sometimes forget how dominant Mercedes was in 2014 with how things have shifted in recent years.

1hirou1,Rwanda’s F1 Bid: Should the plans go ahead?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hirou1/rwandas_f1_bid_should_the_plans_go_ahead/,2024-12-20, Discussion,"On paper, the Rwandan proposals sound fantastic: a state-of-the-art circuit in a stunning location, with a fast, flowing nature. It would be a refreshing contrast to some of the lifeless, run-off-laden tracks we see today.

But as exciting as this sounds, I can’t help but feel sceptical. Rwanda would have to build everything from scratch—not just the track but also grandstands, transport links, and all the infrastructure required to host an F1 event. This is a hugely expensive undertaking, and F1’s track record with new venues (think India and South Korea) doesn’t inspire confidence. Both countries invested heavily in new tracks, only for the races to disappear from the calendar after just a few years.

There’s also the sustainability angle. F1 has ambitious net-zero goals, but building a new circuit in Rwanda, when options like upgrading Kyalami in South Africa exist, raises questions about how serious the sport is about its environmental commitments. Wouldn’t working with an existing venue be a more responsible choice?

At the end of the day, Rwanda’s decision to pursue this project is their call. But F1 has a responsibility too. If the sport greenlights this project, it needs to ensure the plans are viable in the long term—not just a flashy but short-lived investment.

What do you think? Should F1 prioritise a return to Africa no matter what, or should it focus on sustainability and long-term viability?","["">There’s also the sustainability angle. F1 has ambitious net-zero goals, but building a new circuit in Rwanda, when options like upgrading Kyalami in South Africa exist, raises questions about how serious the sport is about its environmental commitments. Wouldn’t working with an existing venue be a more responsible choice?\n\nF1 added two more tracks in America when COTA is *in use* for a decade. I don't understand why they should hesitate letting Rwanda build its own one on the basis of a defunct venue. Plus, I didn't realise construction is bad for the environment."", 'no reason the sustainability angle would apply more here than anywhere else, and just because some venues failed to be successful or long-lasting doesnt mean new ones shouldnt be built. plenty of successful venues built in the modern times as well. so your points to me are largely moot.\n\nthe real questions about it to me are the humanitarian and funding questions. i am not familiar enough with the country to know much about it, but on a glance looks like a country with great amounts of poverty among other issues. so that seems like where some potential actual moral questions lie.\n\nthen again, how much does F1 care for all that?', ""A return to Africa would be great but I just don't see Rwanda as being close to the best option.\n\nThis is a country that's 33rd in GDP in Africa. They have other things they need to spend money on rather than this."", "">Wouldn’t working with an existing venue be a more responsible choice?\n\nThat's assuming that the existing venue is being responsible. There have been multiple attempts to get Formula 1 to return to South Africa over the years, and all of them have failed. There have been problems with funding, with the ownership, with local politics; at every possible roadblock, they have run into a problem that they cannot resolve.\n\n>F1’s track record with new venues (think India and South Korea) doesn’t inspire confidence. Both countries invested heavily in new tracks, only for the races to disappear from the calendar after just a few years.\n\nThat's a bit of a misrepresentation. The Korean Grand Prix fell apart because of the Global Financial Crisis. Formula 1 was trying to lure Hyundai into the sport, but the recession his Hyundai hard. The decision to build the circuit in Yeongam was based on the expectation that there would be more investment in the region -- compare the Shanghai circuit in 2004 to the circuit today and you'll get a sense of what they were aiming for -- but with the economic downturn, the investment never materialised.\n\nAs for the Indian Grand Prix, the sport got caught up in a taxation dispute between the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments. The circuit is technically in Uttar Pradesh, but it was sold to audiences as being in Delhi because the circuit is practically on the boundary between the two regions. The Uttar Pradesh government felt that they were on the hook for all of the expenses, but Delhi was the one getting all of the benefits. They reclassified the race as entertainment rather than sport because that would allow them to tax the teams directly, although they never actually intended to do that -- they were just trying to force the Delhi government to back down."", ""No because I don't care for F1 going to Africa when it contributes nothing to F1. If they wanna throw money at it to make it happen then let them, but it doesn't deserve to get a place for any other reason."", 'Construction is definitely bad for the environment. Anything that relies on fuels and materials that hurt the environment is bad for it.', "">on a glance looks like a country with great amounts of poverty among other issues. so that seems like where some potential actual moral questions lie\n\nI always find this argument to be deeply flawed. The implication is that Rwanda should not have a Grand Prix until such time as they address the issue of poverty. How, exactly, are they supposed to do that? There is only a finite amount of money circulating in the Rwandan economy, and programs to eradicate poverty are expensive and take lots of time to begin with. There is a very good chance that if they poured every single Rwanda franc that they have into a poverty eradication program, then they'll still come up short. So this becomes less a question of the ethics of hosting a race in a developing country and more about making sure fans and competitors are comfortable with where the sport is going.\n\nConsider this: it will likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build the circuit. Where do you think that money is going to go? Sure, some will be spent on hiring the architects who design the layout of the circuit and the facilities, but most of the money is going to be spent on acquiring materials, renting equipment and hiring workers to actually build the venue. That's money that's being injected directly into the local economy as well as creating jobs. When the Rwandan Grand Prix takes place, people will likely be flying into the country to see it, which means that they're going to be spending money on food and accommodation and injecting more money into the economy. And when the race is broadcast to the rest of the world, the government is no doubt hoping that investors will see that this tiny African nation has a modern developing economy, is able to complete a major infrastructure project and organise a global sporting event, and that that will be enough to convince foreigners to invest in Rwanda.\n\nBut no, we're so hung up on the ethics of having a race in a developing nation that we're apparently not willing to have a race there."", ""Rwanda is most well-known for its genocide, but it's made great strides in the 30 years since then. They don't have any worse human rights issues than any other country at the moment."", "">They have other things they need to spend money on rather than this.\n\nWhere are they going to get that money from?\n\nActually, now that I think on it, here's something that they could do: they could host a major international sporting event and use that to attract foreign direct investment -- the kind of sums that they will need to address these issues -- by showing their country to be a modern economy. This will be especially helpful because, judging by a lot of the comments in various threads on a race in Rwanda, most people only really know that it's a small, somewhat impoverished country in Africa that went through a genocide thirty years ago.\n\nAnd do you know who else had this idea?\n\nThe Rwandans!"", 'What do you think the other tracks contribute to the sport that the continent of Africa would not?

1hiygpa,American F1 fans share their thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hiygpa/american_f1_fans_share_their_thoughts/,2024-12-21, Discussion,"**Now that the dust has settled on the 2024 Formula 1 season, we’ve firmly entered a time of reflection — and, as F1 continues to pursue an American audience, it’s time to ask if the sport is on the right track.**

To find out, we spoke with 23 different American fans about their experiences with Formula 1 and their hopes for the future. Some fans rode the Drive to Survive wave into a new fandom, while others had been dedicated F1 viewers for decades. Though all felt the 2024 season was deeply compelling, these fans raised some critical points about the growth of F1 in America.

Doing so would allow for a kind of “translation” of F1-specific racing terms into a more general language designed to attract the ever-growing slate of American fans, and would also do wonders in making those new fans feel more at home.*\n\nWhat the fuck?

Maybe I should be glad I can’t read the rest of the article because I’d just get more annoyed lmao', '*“F1 has priced itself out of the market and is now an elite sport that only elites can afford,” he said.*\n\nThis is something FOM is comfortable with, their revenue is strongly linked to promoter payments and promoters who are forced to pay more have to charge fans more (excluding the state sponsored ME races…).\n\nI would suspect FOM sees attending a race as akin to attending a Super Bowl, a one off, very special event, that is expected to be expensive whereas watching on TV is the ‘norm’. I don’t think FOM sees attending a race like a football/soccer match would be, where frequent attendance is planned.', ""As an American F1 fan, I have a lot of thoughts on this article.

But then conversely, the Americans are just as guilty trying to create the show (see nascar).

There were reporters who covered 20-30 Indy 500s and weren’t allowed into the gates for F1.”\n\n>Another common theme among the fans we spoke to was the feeling that F1 was treating American fans with disregard.\n\n>“I have noticed that European F1 fans tend to look slightly down on American fans, at least online,” a fan named Mandy told PlanetF1.com.\n\n>“I’ve had more than one tell me there shouldn’t be any US F1 races since we have IndyCar — which is nice, but it’s a different sport!”\n\n>A fan named Preston agreed, pointing out that he feels F1 is trying to appeal more to entertainment fans than motorsport fans, to the detriment of American fans.\n\n>“[F1 doesn’t] seem to think we are ‘sophisticated’ enough to appreciate the technical ability or the amazing travel that happens with the sport,” he said./div>\n\n>Another fan, Jessica H., argued that “There is an attempt at showmanship that is incredibly basic, and a clear indicator that the F1 corporation doesn’t understand their audience [in America].\n\n>“You can really see that with their attempts to bring in celebrities and influencers.
