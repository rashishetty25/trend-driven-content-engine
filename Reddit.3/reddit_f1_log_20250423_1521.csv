1k5gu1b,Is Oscar Piastri's decision to snub Alpine for McLaren in 2022 one of the smartest career moves in F1 history?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k5gu1b/is_oscar_piastris_decision_to_snub_alpine_for/,2025-04-22, Discussion,"Aside from the obvious example of Hamilton’s gamble to join Mercedes, are there many career decisions in F1 that have worked out better than Piastri’s choice to ditch Alpine for McLaren?

Back in early July 2022, while still an Alpine reserve driver, it was already speculated that Piastri had signed a deal with McLaren — even though at the time, McLaren were behind Alpine in terms of car performance.

When Alonso made his shock move to Aston Martin, many expected Piastri to step up and partner Ocon at Alpine. Instead, he stuck with his McLaren move — a decision that completely altered his career path for the better. Rather than scrapping for the odd points finish at Alpine, Piastri now finds himself a championship contender in just his third F1 season.

For some perspective:

Points since Piastri joined F1:

Oscar Piastri — 488

Alpine F1 Team — 190

And just for fun: if Piastri had gone to Alpine as originally planned, who do you reckon would be Lando Norris’s teammate right now? I’d guess Gasly.","['Certainly, although Hamilton joining Mercedes in a shock move is probably better.', ""Piastri obviously made the right call but he definitely didn't snub Alpine. It seems Alpine's propaganda is hard to fight.\n\nHe never had a seat at Alpine.

You can carry more speed, brake late, and still make the corner but trade corner exit for better track position. \n\nI think anyone who plays sim racing or arcade game like F1 games or even Need for Speed games understands this concept. \n\nPalmer’s analysis is clearly biased to serve his opinion.', ""So Max could have made the corner. \n\nI guess throwing it up the inside and running your opponent off is now free game for Max for the rest of the season and he won't be penalized?"", 'How are we still talking about this?

Has gotten a lot better lately but noticed Carlos is getting most praise for single handedly providing double points. Then he pulls away during last lap for what he even calls “cheeky” lap. Alex radio stated “what is he…” like holding tongue and then he walked by Carlos’ car in parc ferma. His take on race vs Carlos’ left some fans with impression Carlos was the only one doing heavy lifting. Seems on any post specifically about Albon, albeit they aren’t numerous, the passionate Carlos fans come out. Just wonder if there’s tension to come. Realize there’s a newer fan base overall in F1, may not have the historical or driving knowledge and simply now fanatics for a particular driver. But see an issue for long term fans that remember Alex single handedly providing points, being loyal when had other suitors, and getting defensive as not equally appreciated by Carlos’ enormous and passionate fan base. Can see coming tension especially as truly believe we have a superior driver duo but cautious when remembering Carlos’ Silverstone, Vegas, and Spanish questionable team player clashes with Charles.

Norris was immediately faster than Ricciardo and had a great start to the year in 2021. But over the season Ricciardo did come back and was even the better driver in a lot of races toward seasons end. Then there was a reg change in 2022 and Ricciardo’s form spiralled ginormously. Could the 2026 regs prove similar for Carlos?\xa0\n\nThere has been some worrying language coming from Sainz that he doesn’t know where he’s losing time, which is one of the most worrying that things to hear from an F1 driver. However he has been faster than Albon in the last two rounds.\xa0\n\nAnd there is also the question of what if Williams build a great car next year? It’s not out of the question and Vowles has been targeting 2026 ever since he took over in 2023. They have already shifted their development to it. If podiums and even wins are on the cards that relationship could become a lot less harmonious.\xa0\n\nHowever Vowles did make the mistake of hyping Carlos up too much. He’s a great driver but the way Vowles was talking youd think he’d signed Leclerc, not Sainz.\xa0\n\nBut in the end I think that the drivers themselves will not fall out. Why? Because they seem like the two most level headed guys on the grid. They both seem very intelligent and calm.

He also always says he doesn't understand where he's losing time, and then he goes into the data and figures it out.

""Senna's having a load, and Senna's hiding into the pit wall. Schumacher trying to take it and Senna. Now let's see if the Brazilian moved across. Indeed, he did."" (Murray Walker commentating on a battle between Ayrton and Michael)

""He often used to put us in a position where you were gonna have an accident, and he would leave it up to you to decide whether to have that accident or not."" (MB)

Martin experienced this psychological warfare, first of all, when racing against Senna in F3.  
""Well, look, I've got a great big lead here, and he launches in from nowhere and then parks his role on my shoulder. I couldn't get out of the car until they lifted his car off the top of mine."" (MB)

""So when he wants to overtake, he'd he'd go on the inside and put the car in a place. If you try to take the corner, you're going to hit him."" (JC)

""Yes. He would put you in a compromising position and then leave you to make the decision. And if you didn't run into him, then psychologically you were buried and finished.  
He would then know that every time after that he showed you a wheel, you jumped out of the way."" (MB)

Is it just me, or did Max update this approach to modern times?","[""Yes, and I think Schumacher also had a similar approach as well. \n\nI rewatched that segment recently (I'd highly recommend it, one of the best things Top Gear made imo) and was definitely reminded of Max in that moment"", ""Absolutely! Max knows exactly what he is doing and where the limits of the rules are. So he keeps going there because he can. And by driving as aggressive as he does, others know what to expect and can ask themselves if it's worth the risk."", 'This is peak Formula 1 racing for me.\n\nIt needs to retain that jousting match factor in on track battles, where a driver can scare a competitor into submission.', ""I always enjoy watching this episode and I actually asked myself the same question. I think yes, this way is very similar to what Senna did.\n\nThe only difference is: with Senna people say it's magical or special and with Verstappen they say it's reckless and aggressive"", 'People talk too much about how Max knows the limit of the rules lol. He doesn’t. He just makes sure the decision is in the hands of the stewards and to not lose position on track. He gets a lot of penalties for someone who knows the limit of the rules', ""He's very similar with his driving, even their career paths are kind of similar.\n\nIt's funny when his rivals criticize his driving. Because if you ask them who the goat is, pretty much all of them will say Senna."", 'Can you do a spellcheck... this is difficult to read', 'Seems like the best solution from a game theory perspective would be to take the crash the first time and take both yourselves out, so that both parties are more likely not to have to play chicken the next time\n\nAnd you can see why you can’t really blame Hamilton or Piastri or Leclerc or whoever when they do hold their ground, it’s only not really an option if you’re behind on points directly on the WDC fight, but right now Piastri will have the advantage specifically against Max, because we’ve seen how he races that he won’t back down. This could open up the points for George or Lando if they do crash however', ""Schumacher absolutely followed the same philosophy. If you look at Hamilton vs. Rosberg, you can see this mindset in full force as well (with both of them, actually).\n\nIn the end, most GOAT drivers weren't exactly nice on track - But rather cut-throat and always stretching the rules (and most of the time, even overstepping them a little bit).""]",0,27,0.38,0,23,23,0,1,0.0,0

Pretty sure there are some people here a lot smarter than me that have looked into this already. Would be interesting to see if Max would have done a stint similar to Leclercs if he could have won. He seemed to have good pace on the mediums in the clean air.

","[""I don't think we really know how much extra pace Piastri had in hand. I feel as though he had enough in reserve to stay ahead of Max if Max had tried to overcut, what that might have meant for Piastri's tyre life at the end of the race is another matter."", ""He had good pace on old tyres but even that tyres can't hold for too long.\n\nFew more laps he will be even slower."", ""He could probably have gotten in front of Hamilton but I don't think he could make enough gap to cover piastri as well, he was on old tyres after all"", 'Oscar was doing purples pretty much immediately after he came out, so no.', "">I was wondering if Max could have pitted later than he did and come out in front of Piastri.\n\nImpossible. He gave everything he had (remember the, at least, two radio messages of his racing engineer to give it his all) in the mere two laps after Piastri pitted, and he STILL came around 2.5s behind PIA back on track. Piastri was already faster, so had max continued, he would've fallen even more behind. In fact, had he done even just a few more laps, let alone extend his stint like Leclerc did, he would've fallen behind Russell."", 'Fresh tires were much faster. Piastri took 3/4 of a lap to warm the tires during which time Delta increased by 0.5s or so. From that point on until Max pitted, delta was dropping 0.2 per sector.', 'Realistically, the way everything worked out, it went the best it could have.i was hoping for max to at least finish 2nd. That was good enough considering Mclarens pace,  Lando off the podium was necessary. Both those things happened. Not a bad weekend for Max. Still in the hunt.', 'Mathematical yes.

You wont find a good answer here because nobody can know', ""Am I the only one reading SA as South Africa?\n\nAnyway, the way it looked to me Max was only going to win if he'd had a better start and held off Piastri without overtaking off-track.""]",0,26,0.4,0,85,85,0,0,-0.009999999999999953,0

But over the last ten years or so I found out more and more - through people like Chris Harris - about how Ferrari acts toward customers (and “aspiring” customers) of their road cars and I fell out of love with the brand and because of that, the racing team. 

Nowadays I watch Verstappen in awe of his obvious talent and the fact that he just lives for racing - even excelling at sim-racing which he does in his down-time. And I follow the sport to see the rise of talent like Antonelli and, as a New Zealander, to see if Lawson can rise to a great career.

But I don’t really follow manufacturers as a fan any longer.

Interested to know if people here always followed one team and whoever drives for them - or just drivers - or whatever combination?

**edit:** Plus, I’m following Newey a bit especially to see if he can bring the Midas touch to another team - and to see if Verstappen will drive his designs again.","['Alonso\n\n.......still Alonso with a developed immunity to disappointment', 'Galaxy brain is to be an F1 fan.\n\n  \nUniverse brain was to be a fan of rain (until Spa 2021)', 'I just hope for strong fair racing and im always rooting for the underdogs.', ""Started as a Schumacher fan, then followed over to Kimi.
