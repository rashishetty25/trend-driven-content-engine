The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t rocked the Formula 1 world. Mercedes and Ferrari have moved somewhat closer.**\n\n> We don\'t need to rewrite the Formula 1 World Championship. The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t upset the balance of power between the teams. McLaren is still ahead, both on a single lap and in the long run. Max Verstappen is close. This has to do with the fact that Barcelona is a Red Bull track. The hope that stiffer front wings would upset the balance of the papaya racers was not fulfilled.\n\n> Mercedes has rediscovered its form from the first six races. But only for one lap. During the long run, the tires overheated. Ferrari delivered a solid performance. The gap to the leaders was half a second, slightly less than last time.\n\n> In the midfield, Aston Martin performed well on a single lap and Alpine on the long run. Toro Rosso showed the most balance. Their speed is good both on a single lap and over the distance.\n\n> Sauber has made a noticeable leap forward with its new aero package. Nico H√ºlkenberg\'s strong endurance run underscores that the Sauber has become more predictable. Williams, as expected, is struggling. The car doesn\'t thrive in the long corners. Haas had the same problem and plummeted to the bottom of the standings.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n> **1) Has the new front wing rule shuffled the field?**\nNot at all. On one lap, McLaren is ahead of Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Alpine, Toro Rosso, Sauber, Williams, and Haas. That\'s almost normal. Aston Martin looks slightly better than recently, Williams slightly worse. That depends on the track. Sauber and Alpine have made a leap with their upgrades. Haas adjusted the setup in the wrong direction after a strong first practice. On one lap, Mercedes is a pole position contender. But the Silver Arrows suffered a setback in the long run.\n\n> **2) Who has the fastest car in the long run?**\nWhen comparing the long runs, much depends on the time in the second practice session they were completed and the distance they covered. George Russell drove the longest stint on soft tires with 16 laps. Piastri was the marathon man on the medium tires with 14 laps. We only count the fast laps without cool-down periods or time lost due to traffic. The length of the race simulation logically puts pressure on the lap times. This is why Russell and Norris are far down in the standings.\n\n> Max Verstappen and Lando Norris are difficult to compare. Both completed a long run on the soft and medium tires, but at different times. Verstappen started on the medium and then switched to the soft. Norris did the opposite. Therefore, the world champion was faster in the soft long run, while Norris was faster in the medium endurance run. The difference was three to four tenths per lap. Taking the weight factor into account, it\'s a close race. The second stint was obviously helped by the fact that there was less fuel in the tank at the end.\n\n> The Ferrari drivers split their time in sync. First medium, then soft. Lewis Hamilton leads the soft long runs. However, he only completed three hot laps on the set. Oscar Piastri took the fastest time of the day, but suffered a setback in the endurance run. In 14 laps on the medium tires, the Australian only managed an average of 1:20.966 minutes. ""Things didn\'t go well in the first practice session. It wasn\'t until the second that we slowly found our way back to form,"" he said.\n\n> **3) Ferrari: Good or Evil?\nAfter the first practice session, Ferrari\'s faces were relaxed. Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc finished third and fourth, surprising even themselves. Barcelona hasn\'t exactly been one of the red cars\' signature tracks in the past. In the afternoon, with temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius in the shade, the corners of their mouths drooped again. Leclerc slipped to fifth place, half a second off Piastri\'s fastest time.\n\n> Hamilton, finishing eleventh, didn\'t even make the top ten. The Englishman complained about the car\'s balance. ""It was a confusing day with good and bad moments. But I think the final setup changes on Saturday should help us."" Leclerc expressed his positive surprise: ""It was a positive day. In the heat, everyone has less grip. That\'s why it\'s difficult to assess the cars\' true potential. But I feel like we still have something up our sleeve with our car.""\n\n(1/2)', 'While I agree the flexi wing clampdown won‚Äôt have much impact on the overall running order, I do think it‚Äôs a bit premature to say ‚Äúnothings changed‚Äù when we‚Äôve only seen 2 practice sessions. We all know Friday practice sessions can be unrepresentative.', ""Mclaren won by 30-40 seconds in Miami, that advantage isn't just a front wing difference."", 'We‚Äôll see after the race how things play out, too early to draw any conclusions. Although really you‚Äôd need multiple race weekends.\xa0', 'Non flexible wings don\'t make cars slower over a couple of laps. \n\nThe cars will be as fast as usual for 1 or 5 laps. \n It will hurt their tyre usages on long stints as they have to choose between beeing fast in the straight or have more downforce in the corners. \n\nResulting in beeing slower on a straight to keep the cornering speed or using up more of your tyres in the corners to go fast on the straight. \n\nWe will find out if anything happened in the pecking order on Sunday during the race at the earliest. \n\nIn FP2 Norris drove 3 laps on the medium at average 1.18s while Verstappen was doing 1.20.0 avarage with the same tyre but more laps and Piastri was doing 1.20.8 avarage with more laps. \n\nPiastri and Verstappen (and others) are also capable of driving 1.18s a lap for 4 or 5 laps and then the tyres might be done and they would have to continue with 1.22 laps. And nobody knows how much fuel they had in the car and what the "" simulation"" setting for the long run where. \n\nIf we tell Piastri to drive 1.20.8 s for 10 laps because we expect during the race to do that for 31 laps and Verstappen was told to do 1.20.0 because they anticipate to use that tire for no more then 25 laps in the race. \n And then they come back in and look at the tyre degradation and see that drivers were going too fast to have the tyres last their anticipated length or they find out they could have gone even quicker. \n\n\nLong story short. It is practice, other then cars looking stable or unstable on track there is nothing serious that spectators can learn from it.', ""I mean Friday isn't exactly a solid representation.  We gotta keep in mind most qualifying Saturdays have generally been decided by a thenth or less.  A front wing could very well be the difference in that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI understand qualifying isn't race trim, but who knows.  I will admit a front wing isn't going to be the sole decider in shaking up the grid, but if teams were using older-spec wings for the first 8 races it should show *some* impact."", ""Hopium isn't always foolproof."", ""We're only judging off one track though, hot temperatures and relatively high downforce suits the McLaren, if we got to a different type of track it might not be so similar.""]",143,46,0.88,143,333,333,3,2,0.0,3

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our¬†[guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our¬†[FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H√§kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

I didn't see much, now this question in the press conference. \n\nI'd be surprised if Ferrari let go of Fred so soon tbh, he's been doing a good job so far"", ""What's the difference, in practical terms, between a slipstream (good, makes you faster) and dirty air (bad, makes you slower). Is it determined by distance, whether or not you're on a straight, or something else? It seems to arbitrarily be described as one of these two things when one car follows another, but I don't know what makes it one vs the other."", 'What happens if there are the same set of times in qualifying? Do those drivers then continue to drive until the next fastest lap wins (even after the Q3 time window is over)? Asking as there were two sets of the same times during the FP yesterday!', 'Why are there no points at all for drivers in the 11-20th places, as there seems to be no difference between a driver who consistently finishes just outside of the points and those who finish last. Surely, their positions should also contribute in some way to the constructors championship as well? Maybe the points could be staggered in such a way that the last position gets none and above all gets points? (Relatively new to F1, Japan this year was my first so apologies if this is a really silly question!)', 'Yall have any fun spins on Piastri\'s ""Pastry"" nickname?\n\nI like ""Tasty Pastry"" personally', ""They're the same thing. It's the wake of a car in front leaves through calm air and it can be felt anywhere up to 5 seconds behind a car, with most notable effects being up to 2 seconds behind it. In some cases it's beneficial, in ithers it makes the car harder to drive.  \n  \nIt's called slipstream on a straight, as there it reduces the amount of air the following car has to punch through, meaning you'll be inherently faster in the wake of turbulent air of the leading car.   \n  \nIt's called dirty air in the corners, as the wings and airflow around the car that generates downforce requires undisturbed airflow to generate downforce, which allows the cars to take corners faster.  \nIn dirty air the downforce is reduced which usually results in higher tire wear (less downforce == more sliding on the tires) and harder to maintain tire & brake temperature."", ""Some prerequisite knowledge is that drag and downforce are intertwined. When you add downforce to a car it also adds to the drag. It's just a natural consequence of physics. You don't ever want drag, and you can only reduce it (if you're clever) but never eliminate it. \n\nHuge amounts of downforce allows F1 cars to go so fast in traction zones (i.e. corners, braking, and during initial acceleration phases) but when the tyres are not fighting for grip (like on a straight) the downforce is not necessary and then all it's doing is slowing the car down because of the drag. \n\nNow aerodynamic devices (wings, diffusers, etc) work best in undisturbed air. A car going through the air will push it out the way and create a wake (analogous to a boat's wake). This means a following car will lose downforce in the wake, but that also means that drag is reduced. So this is terrible in the traction zones, when you want maximum downforce, but great on straights when you want to minimise drag. \n\nSo yeah, it's all dirty air, but we just call it a slipstream outside the traction zones when it's beneficial."", ""Where on the track you are. \n\nSlipstream punches a hole through the air for you, if you're following directly on a straight behind it's good. Dirty air is when you're going around a corner and driving at different angles to the guy in front, so instead of driving through the hole he punched, you're driving through the air bouncing off his car. Thus slowing you down, affecting your own downforce and leading to greater deg."", 'If you look up a CAD simulation of vehicle wake aerodynamics it‚Äôs easier to wrap your head around. A body of mass travelling through the air creates a lot of turbulence, but immediately behind it you have a wake of low pressure that gradually trails off. Travel within that and you‚Äôll have significantly less air resistance. Closer you get the more significant the effect.', 'I believe the person that sets the time first gets the position.\n\nIn the title decider at Jerez in 1997, three drivers set the exact same time for pole position.']",5,14,0.86,5,13,13,3,7,0.18999999999999995,3

I'd understand if it was within the same reg cycle like ground effect but this spans wide body hybrids and ground effect. Surely the rule set changes enough so the cars have different characteristics which will suit different tracks?

They fell into that by default of their new Mercedes engines when the 2014 regs came in and saved Claire‚Äôs ass, and they kept philosophy since: Make the car stable and fast in a straight line at the expense of cornering and responsiveness. \n\nThis was especially prominent during the dark years between 2018-21 when Monza and Mexico were basically Williams‚Äô only legitimate chance at points barring something crazy happening like Germany 2019. \n\nNow with Dorilton as the owners and James as the TP, the design philosophy is changing with the culture.
