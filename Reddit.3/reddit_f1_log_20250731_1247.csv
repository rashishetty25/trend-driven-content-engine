before the race started Markus made a bold call to pit for the full wet tyres and by the end of lap 2 it paid off when he was leading the race by over 30 seconds but unfortanely due to auqaplaining a lot of drivers ended up crashing at turn one leading to a red flag, evaporating Winkelhock lead.

but what if there was no mass Auqaplaing leading to the mass crashes and red flag, and Markus Winkelhock car never suffered any failures: What if Markus Winkelhock won the European GP in 2007.

* Unsurprisingly, Ayrton Senna would be the best in qualification of all times with a **massive** ELO of 2282, followed by Schumacher (**2172**) and Nigel Mansell (**2161**)

Hi everyone,

I started a project this afternoon with the hope of answering a question I've always asked myself: who's the best driver of all time? It's obviously impossible to compare drivers that raced under different regulations, different cars, different track configs, etc.

But I thought about doing something else. I figured I could use the chess ELO algorithm to compare every driver WITH HIS TEAMMATE, as if they played a chess match, for each quali and race session since 1950. At the end of the season, every driver's ELO rating would carry over into the next season.

So I built a tool that does exactly that: it fetches data from a public F1 API ([Eargast F1 api](https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/)), runs through every race in F1 history, compares teammates head-to-head for both qualifying and race results, and adjusts their ELO accordingly. The result is a historical ELO ranking for every driver against their teammates... so theoretically no car advantage, although we know that's probably not the case (for instance Max was on the latest specification at Spa compared to Yuki running the old specs).

The results are available here: [https://matthewperron.github.io/f1-elo](https://matthewperron.github.io/f1-elo)

The project source code is available here: [https://github.com/matthewperron/f1-elo](https://github.com/matthewperron/f1-elo)

A few notes:

* I'm still updating the project and will probably add graphs and whatnot.
* I'm also looking at generating markdown files for each drivers, so we can see their complete carrer and  the impact on their ELO for every race/quali sessions they have done. This should also be useful to find bugs/issues with hhow the data is processed. I'll update this once this is completed. EDIT: DONE
* ELOs are updated after every session, and ratings carry from season to season.
* I arbitrarily chose to count factor ELO changes with 30% quali and 70% race ratios. This only impacts the global ELO ratings, not the individual Quali or Race ratings. I just thought it made sense. Thoughts?
* I don't discriminate between feature race/sprint or SQ/Q. I don't think I should? EDIT: actually, sprint races and sprint qualifications just aren't in the dataset :-|
* It considers DNFs for races, but with a twist. The API returns status for each race (see https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/status). I arbitrarily decided that the following status are valid:  'Finished', '+1 Lap', '+2 Laps', '+3 Laps', '+4 Laps', '+5 Laps', '+6 Laps', 'Lapped', 'Accident', 'Collision', 'Spun off'. The rest is DNF. I think it makes sense, if you spun off then you deserve to loose your match!
* Technical but... in the ELO calculation, I opted for a K-FACTOR of 64. I think the default value for chess is 32. There isn't a lot of races in which a driver has participated, compared to say the number of matches a chess player has played. So using a higher K-FACTOR value let's the ELO progress a bit quicker. Basically with a K-factor of 64, it means the ELO score can go up by 32 when both drivers have the exact same rating. See the readme for a better explanation on how ELO is calculated. So the PEAK ELO scores aren't as high as chess, and I had to play with huge K-FACTOR to get some similar numbers to chess, and I found ELO swings were way to harsh when I did. I might change this later after more experiment.

* I plan on updating the ELO ratings periodically (after each race) if people show interest. The code is open source and you can also just run it locally if you want. In order to not get IP banned I had to implement pretty strict rate limits and local caching, so keep that in mind if you want to run the calculation locally from scatch. EDIT: I added intermediary results to the git repo so the API doesn't get called if you check the repo out and run it locally.

Caveats.  
I have the full data set from the very first race but did it from 1980 to simplify the calculations of max total points as there have been races where teams had 3 drivers etc.   
Only Grand Prix results no Sprints included.  
No fastest Lap points.  
This is using the current points system only.  


  
Calculations are very simple. Total number of races for each year multiplied by 43 for constructors or 25 for drivers as the total points available for each season.

Then using corrected points for the current system calculated what every constructor or driver would have gotten and just did (points/available points)\*100
