Several manufacturers wanted to overturn the new engine regulations for 2026. After F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali himself took up the V10 engine with synthetic fuel as an alternative for the future and FIA President Mohammed bin Sulayem jumped on the bandwagon, Red Bull and Ferrari wanted to grab the opportunity.\n\n> The two heavyweights of the premier class fought against the new Power Unit, which will come to Formula 1 in 2026. The electrical component is increasing sharply: almost half of the power is supposed to be delivered by the battery, the rest comes from the V6 turbo. Officially, the teams expressed safety concerns at the FIA. The longer recuperation phases could lead to large speed differences and create dangerous situations.\n\n> Other voices from the paddock, however, saw a different motivation for the advances. Ferrari and Red Bull are in arrears with the development of the new drive for 2026. It is rumored that Mercedes is on track to deliver the best power unit. Similar to 2014. At that time, the engine forge in Brixworth had best designed the change to the complicated drives of the current generation and the Formula 1 under several years in the choke.\n\n> **No energy split changes planned.**\nThe first damper was given to the opponents of the new regulations at the Bahrain Grand Prix. At a meeting of all engine manufacturers, Ferrari and Red Bull refused to reinstall the desired V10 naturally aspirated engine in the cars as soon as possible. Newcomers Audi, returnees Honda and also Mercedes would not have been able to develop a different drive at such short notice.\n\n> But the competition did not give up. They wanted to relax the energy split management. On Thursday (24.4.), however, Ferrari and Red Bull, which will develop their own combustion engine for the next season and are supported by Ford on the electric side, suffered the next defeat. The Formula 1 Commission rejected the proposal to change the distribution between the combustion engine and the battery. The plan was to reduce the 350 kW on the electric side to 200 kW in the race. The rest of the power should have been provided by the 1.6-liter V6 turbo engine.\n\n> Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was enraged by the advances of his opponents in the run-up to the meeting. ""I actually wanted to protect ourselves and not comment on it at all. But that\'s really a joke. Just a week ago we had a meeting about the engines. And now these things are back on the agenda.‚Äù Now the Austrian can take a deep breath. The new regulations are given a chance for the time being.\n\n> **Back door remains open.**\nThe F1 Commission discussed fundamental improvements to the energy management strategy for 2026, as well as measures to address financial problems that drive-prower manufacturers may face if either performance losses or significant reliability problems occur in 2026. All these topics will be discussed in more detail by the specialists in the relevant advisory committees.""\n\n> With this decision, the premier class has taken precautions. If there are large differences in performance on the racetrack next year, there would be opportunities to make adjustments in the sense of the sport. If manufacturers are significantly behind, they are likely to exceed the budget cap for the engines and receive more test bench hours.', 'Same two teams trying to get changes to 2026 regs every time. Interesting.\n\nI think it‚Äôs becoming apparent that Red Bull are struggling big time with the power split.\n\nFerrari could be too but they might also just have heard Mercedes have a rocket ship and they want to stop them. Tbh it still means that either Ferrari have a bad engine or Mercedes have a rocket ship. Possibly both.\xa0\n\nOr all the rumours are completely incorrect.\xa0']",81,86,0.89,81,82,82,4,1,0.0,4
