Afterward, he said he only saw the red rear light at the last moment‚Äîtoo late to react.

**That made me wonder: why do F1 rain lights still blink during heavy spray?**

In light rain, blinking might help grab attention. But in dense spray, the off-moments make the car ahead briefly invisible, which is exactly when you need to see it. A solid, constantly lit rain light would likely be more visible through the mist, even if less ‚Äúattention-grabbing‚Äù on paper.

According to older threads and technical docs, the rain light flashes at ~4Hz in wet conditions and ~2Hz during ERS harvesting, but a solid mode does exist (like during pit limiter). Why not use it when visibility is at its worst?

With wet races becoming more common, shouldn't the FIA consider making the rain light stay on instead of flashing in extreme spray?","[""A blinking or strobing light demands your attention, a single continuous light would eventually start being ignored because it's there constantly. It's why every emergency vehicle has strobing lights."", 'Having two lights side by side in each of the three ""points"" of the triangle, that flash on and off alternately, would possibly help.\n\nThat way there\'s a light visible all of the time, but the flashing makes the light move to still draw attention to it.', ""I've raced in rain worse than this weekend.

If you can't stop in half the distance you can see ahead to be clear, it is not safe to race.\n\nTLDR, it doesn't matter in the slightest. By the time you see the light you are incapable of stopping."", 'That light was off more than it was on.

I think we take it for granted and we see people getting in the way of flying qualifying laps or hitting each other on track but his point is really a valid one.

Current F1 drivers of course adapt and are used to the current setup but the visibility of a modern F1 car compared to the past is clearly very limited.

I am a long term big F1 fan but for me I will take this and always consider this a bit more now though.

1. Mercedes - Even without verstappen merc look strong and with the new regs looking engine focused they may well be top of the field.

2. Aston Martin - Aston will unquestionable have the best chassis thanks to newey but honda look to be struggling slightly with the new regs although they are very good at making hybrid engines so may be pushing for title (alonso 3rd wdc???)

3. Ferrari - Will have a strong package like always, not having to switch to single turbo will give them slight advantage

4. Mclaren - Strong podium contender but given there extreme development to secure title this year it may be hard for them to compete for titles in coming years however the merc engine will work well for them

5. Williams - will be close with mclaren due to williams ignoring this year to focus on next regs and also having the merc engine, will have disadvantage due to lack of funding

6. Red Bull - Implosion for red bull with verstappens departure seeming iminent, newey wheatley leaving and horner may be out aswell, the switch to full works team may disadvantage them.

7. Alpine - Merc engine will be only saviour of this car

8. Haas - probably will have better aero and chassis than alpine but the new regs are mainly engine focused

9. Cadillac - New team so has catching up to do although will be working all throughout this year to try and catch up

10. Audi - Already struggling with engine will make them slow to start the new season

11. VCARB - just a worse version of the red bull
