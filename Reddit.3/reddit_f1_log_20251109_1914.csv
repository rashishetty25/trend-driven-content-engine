1ory4jp,Most F1 drivers from a single city,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ory4jp/most_f1_drivers_from_a_single_city/,2025-11-08, Statistics,"At the beginning of the Sprint Crofty said that Bortoletto will be the 18th driver in F1 from Sao Paulo to race at Sao Paulo.

To me this seems like a uniquely high number and I'm assuming it is purely down to the main racing infrastructure in Brazil being oritentated around a single city unlike other larger F1 nations who have their fan bases and circuits more spread out.

I'm curious if this number can be matched by any other city around the world, I very much doubt it but I'm very curious.","['Sao Paolo is also the name if the state.\xa0\n\n\nQuite a few states in Brazil share the name of their biggest/capitol city.', 'Bortoleto is not from São Paulo city, he’s from São Paulo state, which is the size of the whole UK and has a population over 40M people.\xa0', 'the German city of Mönchengladbach has, somewhat improbably, produced three Formula 1 drivers: Hans Heyer, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Nick Heidfeld.', 'I bet the big northern Italian cities or Paris would be the best bet, but I doubt any will have more than 18. \n\nMika Salo and Mika Häkkinen used to live within 100 metres of each other when they were kids. That must be the most F1 drivers from a single street.', 'Kings Lynn has produced at least 2 in George Russel & Martin Brundle', ""King's Lynn lol"", 'Sau Paulo with over 20 million people is though absolutely massive. It makes it easier to have this stat when the city in question is the fourth or fifth largest in the world.', ""I don't know for sure, but since there were SO many British drivers it's possible London is first! But frankly I don't have the will to research that!"", '18 is a wildly high number, I doubt any other city could even come close to that.']",72,44,0.91,72,614,614,0,0,0.0,0

1oryfox,FP1 Should be longer for Sprint Weekends.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oryfox/fp1_should_be_longer_for_sprint_weekends/,2025-11-08, Discussion,Would sprint weekends be better with a longer FP1 session? I think extending it to 90 minutes for only Sprint weekends would make them so much better since teams would have a bit more time to figure out the setups. This would also help make up for the lake of FP2. I know the sprint itself gives the teams data. But I think an additional half hour would still be a good compromise between a typical weekend for finding setups and sprint weekends.,"['Reducing fp time was one of the reasons Ross Brawn even wanted to introduce sprints originally', 'Teams having less time to figure out the setups is basically the point of the sprint system', 'No. Less practice = less predictability = more exciting races', ""Why ? Because RBR effed up ? They all had the same and didn't all fail"", ""Nah. Either remove sprints or dont touch the current system. What's 30 more minutes going to do?"", 'You have missed the whole point of sprint weekends, congratulations\xa0', 'Or ideally just get rid of sprints.', ""I don't want teams to gather perfect data. What's the point?"", ""Honestly yes, but purely for the fact that a red flag during FP1 on a regular weekend is a minor distribution in the grand scheme of things, maybe you go into qualifying without doing a low fuel run, or a race simulation depending on how your FP2 and 3 go, but if FP1 is lost you have teams going into Sprint qualifying with a lot of unknowns, does that make for more exciting racing? Possibly but it also can lead to people in setups that are completely undrivable.\nIt's a bit of a double edged sword""]",38,52,0.6,38,331,331,-2,0,0.0,-2
