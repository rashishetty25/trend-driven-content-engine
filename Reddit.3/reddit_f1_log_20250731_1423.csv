* Unsurprisingly, Ayrton Senna would be the best in qualification of all times with a **massive** ELO of 2282, followed by Schumacher (**2172**) and Nigel Mansell (**2161**)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Hi everyone,

I started a project this afternoon with the hope of answering a question I've always asked myself: who's the best driver of all time? It's obviously impossible to compare drivers that raced under different regulations, different cars, different track configs, etc.

But I thought about doing something else. I figured I could use the chess ELO algorithm to compare every driver WITH HIS TEAMMATE, as if they played a chess match, for each quali and race session since 1950. At the end of the season, every driver's ELO rating would carry over into the next season.

So I built a tool that does exactly that: it fetches data from a public F1 API ([Eargast F1 api](https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/)), runs through every race in F1 history, compares teammates head-to-head for both qualifying and race results, and adjusts their ELO accordingly. The result is a historical ELO ranking for every driver against their teammates... so theoretically no car advantage, although we know that's probably not the case (for instance Max was on the latest specification at Spa compared to Yuki running the old specs).

The results are available here: [https://matthewperron.github.io/f1-elo](https://matthewperron.github.io/f1-elo)

The project source code is available here: [https://github.com/matthewperron/f1-elo](https://github.com/matthewperron/f1-elo)

A few notes:

* I'm still updating the project and will probably add graphs and whatnot.
* I'm also looking at generating markdown files for each drivers, so we can see their complete carrer and  the impact on their ELO for every race/quali sessions they have done. This should also be useful to find bugs/issues with hhow the data is processed. I'll update this once this is completed. EDIT: DONE
* ELOs are updated after every session, and ratings carry from season to season.
* I arbitrarily chose to count factor ELO changes with 30% quali and 70% race ratios. This only impacts the global ELO ratings, not the individual Quali or Race ratings. I just thought it made sense. Thoughts?
* I don't discriminate between feature race/sprint or SQ/Q. I don't think I should? EDIT: actually, sprint races and sprint qualifications just aren't in the dataset :-|
* It considers DNFs for races, but with a twist. The API returns status for each race (see https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/status). I arbitrarily decided that the following status are valid:  'Finished', '+1 Lap', '+2 Laps', '+3 Laps', '+4 Laps', '+5 Laps', '+6 Laps', 'Lapped', 'Accident', 'Collision', 'Spun off'. The rest is DNF. I think it makes sense, if you spun off then you deserve to loose your match!
* Technical but... in the ELO calculation, I opted for a K-FACTOR of 64. I think the default value for chess is 32. There isn't a lot of races in which a driver has participated, compared to say the number of matches a chess player has played. So using a higher K-FACTOR value let's the ELO progress a bit quicker. Basically with a K-factor of 64, it means the ELO score can go up by 32 when both drivers have the exact same rating. See the readme for a better explanation on how ELO is calculated. So the PEAK ELO scores aren't as high as chess, and I had to play with huge K-FACTOR to get some similar numbers to chess, and I found ELO swings were way to harsh when I did. I might change this later after more experiment.

* I plan on updating the ELO ratings periodically (after each race) if people show interest. The code is open source and you can also just run it locally if you want. In order to not get IP banned I had to implement pretty strict rate limits and local caching, so keep that in mind if you want to run the calculation locally from scatch. EDIT: I added intermediary results to the git repo so the API doesn't get called if you check the repo out and run it locally.

1me17kr,[AMuS] Mercedes removes new rear axle again,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1me17kr/amus_mercedes_removes_new_rear_axle_again/,2025-07-31, News,,"['Last year of the regulations and still looking for answers, big oof. They better hope the engine is good next year because they seem to have at best the 4th best aerodynamics/engineering team in the field. Even then the McLaren will have the same engine as them. If they dont start ahead i dont see them catching up seeing how these regulations went.', 'Translation:\n\n\n\n> **Mercedes is still searching for the reason for its recent poor performance. The front wing and rear axle are suspected.**\n\n> For six races, the Mercedes was a fixture in the field. Not as fast as the McLaren, but consistent. George Russell finished on the podium four times in the first six Grands Prix. After Imola, he only managed it once more. Russell\'s victory in Montreal, however, was not a turning point; it was merely a solitary highlight in many mediocre performances.\n\n> The Silver Arrows lost their consistency after the race in Imola. And a problem they thought was under control resurfaced. The tires tended to overheat again in certain conditions. This led to the suspicion that the technical package, which debuted at the seventh World Championship round, was partly to blame for the fluctuations in form. The front wing and the new rear axle quickly became suspects.\n\n> To get to the bottom of the disappointing race at Imola, Mercedes returned to the old rear suspension. Meanwhile, a second important element also changed. Starting with the Spanish GP, the front wing had to pass the FIA\'s more stringent stiffness tests. Its flexibility is an important tool in balancing the car for both slow and fast corners.\n\n> **Misleading victory.**\nIn Canada, the Mercedes were again equipped with the new rear axle. It was no longer under suspicion. The moment of glory in Montreal was a deceptive confirmation. Drivers and engineers were all the more astonished to discover in the three subsequent races that the car was difficult to balance. This had negative consequences for tire wear.\n\n> This happened on race tracks where they had won the previous year. This made it clear: The fault might lie in the rear suspension and the front wing. To finally get some clarity, Mercedes is switching back to the standard suspension for the Hungaroring. The front wing had already been modified at Spa to reduce air turbulence around the front tires and the airflow in the lower areas behind them.\n\n> The outlier in Montreal can be explained by the fact that all the corners there have a similar profile. They are slow chicanes. The drivers brake and then turn in. The car can be set up well for this. Spielberg, Silverstone, and Spa offer corners with different speeds and radii. What suits one type of corner can be a disadvantage for another. A front wing that flexes less controlled then becomes a problem.\n\n> **Anti-lift rear axles are trending.**\nMercedes is following the trend with its rear axle modification. Red Bull, McLaren, and recently Ferrari have also modified the anti-lift behavior at the rear. Mercedes Technical Director James Allison explains the background: ""With this generation of cars, you want to keep the rear axle low because the loss of downforce is very high when you drop out of that window. But too close to the road is just as bad as too far away. When the driver hits the brakes, the car usually lifts at the rear. You want to prevent that as much as possible.""\n\n> In the Mercedes case, however, instability arose in certain types of corners. The rear end became nervous when turning under braking. Thanks to his experience, George Russell coped better with the car\'s sudden unpredictability than his younger colleague Andrea Kimi Antonelli. But he couldn\'t perform magic either. The Englishman finished 5th, 10th, and 5th in the final stages. Far from the podium finishes.\n\n> **Retrofitting proves difficult.**\nShouldn\'t the other teams with similar suspensions also be in the same boat? Not necessarily, as Mercedes chief engineer Andrew Shovlin explains. ""Those who planned for this type of suspension from the outset have it easier. We retrofitted and had to live with what we had. The gearbox housing is a carryover from 2024. There aren\'t unlimited points on a housing like that where you can attach suspension elements.""\n\n> Mercedes is therefore living with a compromise. According to Shovlin, there are around ten parameters in a suspension that are crucial for handling. From anti-lift and pro-squat to camber and caster. These still have to be reconciled with the wishes of the aerodynamicists, who have a significant say in the shape, position, and angle of the wishbones. ""Anyone who develops this type of suspension from a blank sheet of paper makes fewer compromises,"" says Shovlin.\n\n> The old suspension is making a comeback at the start of the Budapest weekend. The return to the familiar rear suspension setup should make it easier for Mercedes engineers to filter out other suspected troublemakers. ""After the second free practice session, we should have a pretty good idea whether our theories are correct,"" Shovlin hopes.', 'Does that mean the car is gonna scrape along the ground?', 'One step closer to a hover car.', ""Schr√∂dinger's Rear Axle...it both exists and does not..."", 'Do they not need a rear axle?

Would love to hear folks thoughts‚Ä¶
