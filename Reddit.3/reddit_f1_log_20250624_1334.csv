Him and Nico have the closest pace delta. So he's on the right track. As for Sunday's he'll only get better with experience. \n\nHulk is no slouch and is a good benchmark to have. Gabi can also watch and learn from Hulk in terms of how he works with the engineers. The man is well regarded for his technical know how. Engineers have praised his technical feedback and Gabi can learn a lot from him."", 'Regardless of how they slice it, it still looks pretty bad on Bortoleto that he has zero points while Hulkenberg has 20 points.

He needs to work on race pace, but that's something that comes naturally with more experience as we have seen with Piastri. I expect Bortoleto to be on par with Hulkenberg towards the end of this year and outperform him next year.

Recently I‚Äôve been doing a fair bit of research on driver‚Äôs styles. I‚Äôm trying to see who was fastest no matter what really. For example:

Ayrton Senna - extremely fast in his era. Unique style was akin to how traction control works, and enabled him to stay on the edge. Great longevity going from twitchy turbo cars to NA V12s, but difficult to predict how this would have fared in the TC V10s era. Was showing adaptability at Williams in 94, however. 

Schumacher - preferred understeer contrary to popular belief, however after his time at Benetton he adapted to a pointy oversteer setup which kept him at the limit more consistently than other drivers. But in the V8 era he struggled: he couldn‚Äôt use his ‚Äòrallycrosser‚Äô style to its full potential, and it‚Äôs also important to factor in age, he wasn‚Äôt as sharp. 

Fangio - the master of the four wheel drift. Only drove as quick as was necessary, demonstrating so at the 1957 German GP. Perfect style for his time.

Jean Alesi - one of my personal favourites, however less of an efficient style, more entertaining. Often took the car far over the limit. Right places, wrong times in the peak of his career. 

These are just some off of the top of my head, I know I‚Äôm missing out many massive names. In your opinion, how was the penultimate example for how to go fast, or the best all round driver?
