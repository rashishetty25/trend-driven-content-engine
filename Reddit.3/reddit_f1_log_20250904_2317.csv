1n8bs3e,[OC] F1 Media Driver Ratings for the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n8bs3e/oc_f1_media_driver_ratings_for_the_2025_dutch/,2025-09-04, Discussion,"Here‚Äôs how the major F1 media outlets rated drivers at the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix vs the race results, as well as the season-long averages from the same publications, compared to the current championship standings.

A couple notes: 

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Cumulative season ratings are calculated by averaging each outlet‚Äôs scores across all races.

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†For ""P1 w/ Matt & Tommy"", the values are the average of Matt & Tommy‚Äôs individual scores.
