The F1 season currently has 24 races and while most circuits are locked in with multi-year contracts, there appears to be at least one available slot in 2027, with the Dutch Grand Prix to no longer be held after 2026 and the Belgian Grand Prix shifting to a bi-annual rotation.¬† Italy may also lose one of its current Grand Prix races, with the Imola expiring at the end of this season.

Thailand is not the only contender in the bidding race though, with rival submissions expected from organisers in South Africa and Rwanda. Authorities in South Korea and Argentina have also previously expressed interest.

It also hosts an annual MotoGP motorcycle race in Buriram in the east of the country, which generated US$140 million in economic circulation in 2024 and created close to 7,000 job positions at the circuit, according to the tourism authority.

A race in Bangkok would mean two annual races in the region, alongside the Singapore GP, which has been on the calendar in its Marina Bay circuit form since 2008. It was the first night race in the sport‚Äôs history and the first street race in Asia.

what's to gain?

I remember rich energy that sponsored haas in drive to survive, but that thing isnt even in dollar stores. [Whatever that was really](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Energy#Brand_legitimacy), but at least they got their little spot in drive to survive.

but what about the rest?

edit: I think I got my answer , thanks everyone ( it's exposure, small, but still exposure. access to private events around and in the paddock for networking)
