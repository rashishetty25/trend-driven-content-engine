1gmnca2,[Tobi Gruner] According to our information Qatars souvereign wealth fund is set to buy a minority stake in the Audi F1 team. Talks have been ongoing for months. Audi won't give up control of the team but get fresh money for investments in Hinwil.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gmnca2/tobi_gruner_according_to_our_information_qatars/,2024-11-08, Social Media,,"['i’ve seen this path before.', 'You put in the oil money and then it becomes green, you see?', ""So soon we'll have a Saudi team (AM) and a Qatari team (Audi/Sauber)"", 'McLaren is already owned by Bahrain.

In ten years will Europeans have any teams left in the sports they created?', 'At least Audi has the common sense to not allow the Qatar lot to have any control of the team because that could be catastrophic', ""People making fun of RBR being just a sports drink brand, they'll soon be more European and closer to racing then actual car brands.\xa0"", 'This are good News tbh. Lets Not forget that mercs stake on their Team is only 33%.', '> Formula 1 is booming worldwide. Thanks to cost caps, growing interest from sponsors and increasing income from the sale of rights, the first teams are now operating profitably. Whereas it used to be necessary to invest millions in racing, it will soon be possible to earn real money with Formula 1.\n\n> One consequence of this is that the racing teams are increasing in value. Even small teams such as Haas or Toro Rosso are now valued at over a billion euros. And because this is an illustrious circle of teams that is not so easy to get into from the outside, the trend is even increasing.\n\n> Some racing teams have started to literally capitalize on the development and sell shares. In June 2023, for example, Alpine announced that it had sold 24% of the team to a group of investors including actor Ryan Reynolds, golfer Rory McIlroy, boxer Anthony Joshua and football stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.\n\n> In mid-September, the British website “Sky” reported that the US investment companies HPS and Accel were planning to invest in the Aston Martin Formula 1 team. Between 20 and 25 percent of the shares are to change hands. The deal is expected to increase the valuation of the racing team to at least 1.8 billion euros.\n\n> And according to information from auto motor und sport, Audi is also on the verge of concluding a deal with an investor. The purchase of the Sauber racing team was only completed at the beginning of the year. However, because the value of the racing team has already risen considerably since the deal was concluded, Audi can now really cash in.\n\n> Rumor has it that a suitable partner has already been found. The Qatar sovereign wealth fund wants to acquire a minority stake in the new works team. The emirate already owns shares in Volkswagen and Porsche. Now the billionaire investor from the Middle East is investing its money in the premier class for the first time.\n\n> The fresh money is likely to be used by Audi to further expand the Hinwil site. Here, the increase in personnel and infrastructure has not yet been completed. The car manufacturer would therefore not have to draw on its own reserves as a result of the Qatar deal.\n\n> Audi itself did not want to confirm the sale of shares in its F1 racing team. When asked by auto motor und sport, the company merely stated: “We are not involved in speculation. The team is not for sale.” However, the sale of a minority share would not be ruled out.\n\n> Even if it is not clear how high the sold share is, Audi will certainly retain control and not allow itself to be talked into decisions. According to our information, the negotiations began some time ago and are not a reaction to the current economic situation.\n\n> Managing Director Gernot Döllner said back in September at the race in Monza that the team’s involvement was not in question and was a long-term decision: “The decision was well prepared two and a half years ago and reassessed last year. We are firmly convinced that Formula 1 and Audi are a perfect match. It is in line with our strategy.”\n\n> The deal with Qatar could also be lucrative for Audi beyond the pure investment. The direct connection naturally opens up numerous opportunities at sponsor level. Qatar Airways is already active as a series partner in Formula 1. It is quite possible that the airline’s logos will soon be seen on the racing cars from Hinwil.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)', 'Audi is already working on an exit strategy...Killing all VAG Motorsport programmes for this... Disappointing.', ""  \nThe important bit\n\n>Audi exit not a topic\n\n>Even if it is not clear how large the share sold is, Audi will certainly retain control and not allow itself to be talked into decisions.

1gmh59u,Is Esteban Ocon one of the only drivers on the grid who performs even better with pressure at the front?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gmh59u/is_esteban_ocon_one_of_the_only_drivers_on_the/,2024-11-08, Discussion,"He's generally not that well liked in the F1 community because of the teammate incidents, and while he has had  some good midfield performances, I believe he's been even better at the front. Sort of like an inverse Norris.

He didn't put a foot wrong in Hungary 2021 when Vettel was in his DRS for 60+ laps. Later that year in Jeddah, he again made no mistakes while at the front and only lost the podium because he [lost a piece of his floor with 2 laps to go](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ocon-floor-damage-cost-me-in-saudi-f1-podium-battle-with-bottas/6856759/), before that he was almost matching Bottas' times. In Suzuka 2022, he qualified in the top 5 and finished P4 after defending against Hamilton the whole race. Monaco 2023 was simply a superb qualifying lap followed by a strong performance in the race, where Sainz was heavily pressuring him in the first stint and almost crashed into him. And finally last weekend, where I believe he had a shot at winning if Sainz didn't cause another red flag.

It's unlikely that Haas will have a frontrunning car anytime soon but I think he will bring the team their first podium. His ability to just soak in the pressure at the front is undeniable.","['Ocon is underrated, but I also don’t believe in this idea that he “performs better” on the rare occasion he is at or near the front. Ocon is simply imo a very clean driver that rarely makes mistakes hence why he sometimes has a nickname of “Oconsistency”. He doesn’t do a lot of aggressive overtakes, but he can pull off very smart and clean overtakes like when he did the switchback to get past both Alonso and Lawson at the COTA sprint race, and his double overtake two years ago in Spa.\n\nMost of the time when Ocon makes mistakes or collisions in wheel to wheel combat it happens with his teammate. For some reason Ocon gets too aggressive with his teammates a few times which simply feels self destructive imo. \n\nOcon and Gasly are easily the 5th best lineup on the grid and both are highly credible midfield drivers that can take advantage of chaos and score a podium or even a win when the rare opportunity arises for them both. \n\nIt is a pity for most of the season they haven’t had a better car to showcase their talents, but I’m glad they both capitalized on it beautifully at Brazil.', ""I think Ocon is a good underrated driver but,  as you  mentioned before, he's also an unloved one and receives lots of hate. He needed/needs a good PR team  to work in his image, but it seems like  he doesn't care. It might be one of the main reasons he is not highly regarded as an asset in the teams he joins."", 'He’s not one of the only ones, but he’s definitely good at it.\n\nNo chance he was going to win though. As it dried up the difference between the Red Bull and the Alpine was huge. Max would have gotten him towards the end.', 'Severely underrated driver', 'He’s good in rain. Brazil 24, Monaco 23 and Hungary 21 all have that in common.', "">and only lost the podium because he lost a piece of his floor with 2 laps to go, before that he was almost matching Bottas' times.\n\nBruh, I didn't even know this happened. The fact he only lost it on the line with that damage makes it even more impressive tbh.\n\n>It's unlikely that Haas will have a frontrunning car anytime soon but I think he will bring the team their first podium. His ability to just soak in the pressure at the front is undeniable.\n\nYeah, he seems to thrive a lot during chaotic races. It makes me think he'd be a great Rubens/Bottas type of driver for a top team with how he'll pick up the pieces if the better and more talented teammate had an off day"", ""Not sure why this post is downvoted, Ocon excels under pressure, when there's an opportunity for a big result he usually grabs it with both hands."", 'Hard to say, you would say the same about Gasly if he never went to red bull so unless he gets into a top car we probably won’t have a big enough sample size to tell', 'Definitely one of my favourite midfield drivers ever. I do wish there was less tripping over each other between him and his teammates though, that’s pretty rough']",0,42,0.48,0,388,388,0,0,0.0,0
