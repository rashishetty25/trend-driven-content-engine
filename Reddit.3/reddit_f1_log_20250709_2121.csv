**Sprints are not included.**

**Race Head-to-Head:** Only includes races where both drivers finished. If a driver completed enough of the race to be classified but retired due to a crash or mechanical issue, that is treated as a DNF.

**Qualifying Head-to-Head:** Only includes qualifying sessions in which both drivers set a valid qualifying time. If a driver didn‚Äôt participate in qualifying at all, didn‚Äôt set a time, or their time was dropped for a violation of the technical regulations, that weekend wasn‚Äôt included and is listed as a DNQ in the table.

**Qualifying Time Differential:** Uses the time from the last qualifying session in which both drivers participated. For example, if one driver made it to Q2 and the other was knocked out in Q1, the Q1 time is used for both.

**Use of Average (Mean) for Qualifying Gap to Teammate:** Because the chart for qualifying gaps uses an average, some drivers were helped or hurt by a single bad qualifying session. The two most extreme examples in each direction are:

* Oscar Piastri crashed during Q3 of the 2023 Canadian GP due to weather, which meant that his lap for that session was 3.303 seconds slower than Lando Norris. If that qualifying session was dropped, he would only be 0.174 slower than Norris instead of 0.434.
* ¬†Pierre Gasly‚Äôs teammate Brendon Hartley set a time that was 12.858 seconds slower during Q1 of the 2018 Azerbaijan GP.

1lvbg6m,Safety Car Restart Procedure,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvbg6m/safety_car_restart_procedure/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"The SC restart procedure has always been a bugbear of mine. I feel there are so many better ways to do it that don't involve slowing down significantly to allow the SC to 'escape' - possibly losing tyre temps and just causing general havoc.

Surely there are better ways to restart?

Option 1 - Send the SC into the pit a lap early - at which point, all vehicles are under a Virtual Safety Car. Paint a new line towards the end of the lap, at which point the VSC ends - and the front driver is now the SC and can restart at any point as they do now, with no overtaking until the SC line. They no longer need to completely slow down to allow the SC to 'escape' to a safe distance. Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap. (Maybe not VSC - maybe speed limited is the better wording)

Option 2 - Move the SC line further into the track rather than at the pit lane exit - meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap.

Probably many other ways to do it.","[""I think better communication would be enough. The problem at Silverstone was:\n\n* The call for the SC to come in was made late.\n* The teams didn't have any advanced knowledge the SC was going to be in that lap - the first the drivers knew was the lights going off.\n* Because they choose to bring the SC late they turned the lights off at a high speed part of the circuit, only Oscar could see the lights had gone out. Max didn't expect Oscar to slow to restart speeds (because he was unaware the SC was coming in).\n\nHad race control put the SC in notice out in the complex or - at worst- maggots and Becketts there would have been no issues. The SC would have had more time to escape, Oscar wouldn't have had to slow down to such a low speed to build a gap."", ""Option 1. The point of the VSC is that cars are to maintain the time gaps. This is obviously impossible at the end of the SC period when everyone is bunched together. The problem is track layout dependent. Any track with a substantial front straight tends to benefit the cars following the leader if the front car doesn't game the situation somewhat. You'd end up with the situation that many race leaders going into a SC lose their lead when SC ends and this is what the SC shouldn't really do.\n\nOption 2 is just confusing."", ""> Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap.\n\nIt may? Mate, SC gets called in once it's safe to bring it in. Once that's happened, it'll almost always be safe to restart as well. You'd be delaying things by a lap in almost all cases of this.\n\n> meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap. \n\nAlso, this frankly hasn't been a valid concern since they disallowed overtaking before the start finish line. Before that, you need to create a gap to ensure cars wouldn't be racing past a safety car that's still out on track. Nowadays, creating gaps and whatnot is purely done for gamesmanship.\n\nIf that bites someone in the ass, it's genuinely their own fault."", 'I like your options but I disagree that it solves the fundamental issue.\n\nThe problem is not that the SC has to ‚Äúescape‚Äù because they really don‚Äôt have to. Under the current rules, once the SC light goes out the leader becomes the SC, so he can theoretically be chasing down the SC, so long he doesn‚Äôt overtake SC. \n\nThe problem is that the leader ‚Äúfeels the need‚Äù to get as much advantage as they can at restart, which means gaming the car(s) behind. I believe this is the thing to solve. At the moment, the way to do this (consistently) is to slow down and start at your own pace.\n\nThe problem this race is a combination of 2 things: safety car coming in message late (meaning leader cannot anticipate the SC light going out), plus Oscar continue accelerating and then slow down so abruptly AFTER SC lights go out. He could have coasted or follow SC closely, but that will diminish the advantage he could gain at restart.\n\nTLDR: there is no rule demanding the leader to ‚Äúslow to restart speed‚Äù or let the SC escape. They do that to game the cars behind. That‚Äôs the real problem to solve.', ""I don't get all the fuss about the safety car procedure just because Piastri did some dumb shit.\n\nThe safety car turned off the lights at the start of sector 3 as it is normal.\n\nPiastri doesn't have to restart into the first corner of sector 3. He doesn't need such a big gap. Usually at Silverstone restarts were done into vale or even as late as the exit onto the straight, not before stow.\n\nBut an easy solution would be: don't allow high speeds before safety car line 1.\n\nPS: safety car lines have multiple purposes. You can't just move them."", 'The SC doesn‚Äôt need to escape.

**Alpine**

I can't personally see Alpine being his first option, Christian Horner likes a challenge and loves a journey, Alpine is yes facing a journey ahead of it, but I think Christian would prefer something new and refreshing. Alpine would make some sense as it's a home HQ, but I think it wouldn't suit. 

**Ferrari**

I mean, I just can't see intra-team relations being positive with Hamilton and Horner? I know it's friendly racing at the end of the day, but I just can't see Ferrari taking on Horner or Horner wanting Ferrari. 

**Cadillac**

I see this the most, why? Because it's a fresh new challenge, a chance to prove again he can take a team through a whole journey of being a fresh team to a championship-winning team. It's also a presitigous name, and will help Christian Horner build up his NA fanbase and profile, I can't see it being any other choice, as the PR boost, the publicity and profile boost and a challenge we know Horner likes to have suits the most.

So NDA  is honestly a must for them.\n\nThat's usually how it goes in most companies when a high end executive gets sacked.""]",0,76,0.34,0,76,76,0,76,0.34,0

Some interesting ones for me:\n\n* Red Bull being one of the most unpopular teams according to fan surveys. (Meanwhile Racing Bulls doing quite well, having a more wholesome image). \n* Having amassed too much power over the years, taking on more roles within the team and not being willing to share power. (For example CEO of Red Bull Racing, Red Bull Powertrains and Red Bull advanced technologies. I wouldn't be surprised if all these roles will be split up in the future). \n* The failing second seat and the mess that was having to let go of Perez financially and still the new drivers not delivering. So he cost Red Bull a lot of money without it making any change in how the second seat performed."", 'in line with their pevious reporting:\n\n>But now Red Bull sports director Oliver Mintzlaff has apparently been able to convince the owners to make the change at the top.

Something he missed out on doing 20 years ago and he remained a mere employee. Mateschitz protected him when he was around. Horner somehow survived the Horndog scandal with a bit of help from the Thai owners. But we knew that his days were numbered.
