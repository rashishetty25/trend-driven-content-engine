What is it I don’t get about McLaren culture that makes you stand so much from almost every other competitor in the history of the championship? \n\n*Oscar*: I mean, I think we’ve said many, many times now that we don’t just want a chance of this success just for this year. You know, there’s a big regulations change next year. We don’t know how competitive we’re going to be, we don’t know how competitive anyone’s going to be. **But you know, ultimately, we want the best chance of winning championships for as long as we’re Formula 1 drivers, and we’re both at McLaren for a very long time. And protecting the people around us that give us this opportunity is a very important thing. So I think it’s easy enough to put yourself second at times like that.** Especially, if we were fighting very closely the whole race, then you know, it’s slightly different. But Lando was ahead by a few seconds the whole race. So there’s no concern for me with that. And ultimately, again, we don’t just want this year to fight for a championship. We want it for as long as possible. And protecting the people—that includes the people doing the pit stops. You know, it’s not a very nice feeling, I would imagine. **So it’s important to protect all the people that we have because that’s what gives us a championship hope for years to come.** \n\n*Lando*: That was beautiful. He said it well, I don’t need to add anymore. **The team is priority. Team is number one, then drivers are second. That’s how it works.** Normally when you see teams who don’t have some sort of, enough respect for the team and the opportunities that the team give, it normally doesn’t last long. And you see that with plenty of other teams whether it’s been Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes. And we want to try and be in this position for a longer period of time than what they have been at the top.

1ni0tr7,With the new engine requirements in 2026…does Cadillac actually have a chance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ni0tr7/with_the_new_engine_requirements_in_2026does/,2025-09-15, Discussion,"I’m very  exited for Cadillac to enter Formula 1. Even more so that they have two excellent drivers.

I thought that they would not really stand a chance. That 2026 would be all about them learning as a team, figuring out car setup and so on.

That’s gonna happen, no doubt. I was thinking though. With all the teams having to adapt to the new engine requirements for 2026…is there a chance that Cadillac could actually make points?

It will be a whole new car and way of racing. What are your thoughts?
","[""cadillac will use ferrari engines, they have the same chance that they would have otherwise\n\nthe chassis regulations are very different but there's still some carry-over from the current cars, they still have a lot of learning ahead of them"", 'They are almost certainly planning on 0 points in 2026. Even if the car is decent, they still have to figure everything out operationally - the global logistics, weekend planning, how to arrange the fucking garage.', 'Absolutely not.', 'They will score a handful of points because there will be reliability issues, there are more races and more points on offer (sprints, etc).\n\nThey’re also coming in with what looks like good prep and a useful budget, so should be better than the likes of HRT or Manor.\n\nI’d be expecting for 1-5 points, hoping for a few more.', ""They have a chance, but it's a slim one.\n\nThere are two main reasons for that:\n\n1. The team is being set up entirely from scratch. That means zero built-in instiutional knowledge and new facilities, new people and new procedures in every part of their design, testing and manufacturing processes. That's not a guarantee that they do a bad job, but increases the risk of issues quite considerably.\n\n2. If we're realistic about it, what are the chances of a brand new team doing a better job on the chassis and aerodynamics of their car compared to any of the 10 teams who have done it before and crucially have actual working cars running this year?"", ""I doubt, like you said they're using 2026 to learn and adapt. Sure they have hired people that had experience in other F1 teams, but everything needs to click. In total [Ferrari customers teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_engine_customers%27_Grand_Prix_results) got 7 podiums since 1956 and one win, Sebastian Vettel with Scuderia Toro Rosso in 2008.\n\nSure customers teams in the past often got slower engines than the factory teams (different mapping).

They obviously weren't a top contender but they scored points right away, I can't help but think GM has way more resources and experience in racing than Hass did when they started out. Obviously they're not going to be fighting for race wins right off the hop but I seriously think people are underestimating the commitment and success GM has in racing."", 'They sure killed their lineup, though. Imagine Perez, no one has more practice racing midfield while their teammate laps the planet.', ""The engine will be the least of their problems (as long as Ferrari doesn't completely fuck it up).  \nPoints will still be a miracle."", 'No\n\nUnless they pull a brawn gp then they may get some points']",0,24,0.25,0,24,24,0,6,-0.04999999999999999,0
