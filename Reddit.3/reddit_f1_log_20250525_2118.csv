**Let‚Äôs rewind.**  
In qualifying, Adami told Hamilton that Verstappen was *‚Äúon a push lap,‚Äù* then immediately said he was *‚Äúslowing down.‚Äù* In reality, Verstappen *was* pushing. Hamilton ended up impeding him and received a three-place grid drop.

**During the race (Lap 76 of 78):**  
Hamilton asked:

>‚ÄúAre they still ahead by a minute?‚Äù  
Adami replied:  
‚ÄúCharles on medium, McLaren on hard. Lapping ‚Äò16 very close to each other fighting.‚Äù  
Hamilton responded:  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not answering the question. It doesn‚Äôt really matter I guess. I‚Äôm just asking if I‚Äôm a minute behind or?‚Äù  
Adami then clarified:  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 48 seconds.‚Äù

**Post-race:**  
Hamilton asked quietly:

>‚ÄúAre you upset with me or something?‚Äù   
No response.

**Context matters.**  
This isn‚Äôt the first awkward moment between the two. In Melbourne, Hamilton told Adami *‚Äúleave it to me‚Äù* when he received repeated reminders about engine modes. In Miami, he criticised the team for delayed team orders with the sarcastic, *‚ÄúHave a tea break while you‚Äôre at it.‚Äù*

Hamilton has said publicly that there‚Äôs no issue and that these are normal race situations. But with repeated miscommunications and visible frustration, questions are beginning to surface.

Is this a case of two people still learning to work together, or is there a deeper mismatch in communication styles? Could Ferrari‚Äôs overall decision-making be contributing to the problem? Is it time for a change, or does this just need more time?

Curious to hear what others think.","[""Lewis's radio was painful all day long. Idk what was wrong with Adami today but he was even more awkward than usual. It was like listening to the Vettel days with him."", 'Look at vettel and Adami(he ordered Ricky sometimes instead of other way around), Carlos and Adami(las Vegas 2024) the miscommunication has been eternal at that position.\n\nEDIT:  \n""Wake up guys, come on!""  \n""Tell it to him in Spanish""  \n""What are these two guys doing? They are not unlapping themselves, they need togo.  \nAdami: ""They restart like this. Treat them as lapped cars.""  \n""Stay out, stay out. No, box, box, box, box!"" Sainz: ""Make up your mind, guys!"" (silverstone 22)  \n\xa0""No, not inters! I told you, straight to slicks!""

It was a basic yes or no question. Its like his brain was malfunctioning.', ""They might replace Adami at some point but for me this is all a symptom of something bigger, Ferrari has been utterly dysfunctional for so long that they don't even look at themselves and question what they're doing here. Somehow Fred Vasseur has been absorbed into that dynamic instead of effecting change.\n\nAnd the lot of them are going to waste Lewis' final years and Charles' entire career"", ""Another moment from today that fits into this picture:\n\nIn a post-race media pen interview (clip circulating, easy to find if you're curious), Hamilton was asked about the ‚ÄúPush now, this is our race‚Äù radio message from Adami. His response was pretty telling:\n\n> ‚ÄúThe information wasn‚Äôt exactly that clear. I didn‚Äôt really understand ‚Äòthis is our race.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt know what I was fighting for‚Ä¶ I used up my tires a lot in that moment, but I was so far away from \\[the cars ahead\\] anyway.‚Äù\n\nThis lines up with the broader pattern from Monaco and earlier races; unclear communication, vague timing, and a lack of shared understanding on what the actual goal is.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just about tone or chemistry between driver and engineer. If Hamilton is burning through tyres without knowing who he‚Äôs racing, that suggests something deeper: a breakdown in how strategy is communicated and understood in real-time. Especially when it‚Äôs happening race after race."", ""the situation with Ferrari is they don't recognise this is a problem. if they did they'd be trying to fix this, too often this happens and it's not just Lewis, Charles, Seb and Carlos have had equally difficult conversations."", ""Ferrari has horrible, systemic issues, and I am afraid to say I think it's because they insist on remaining so strictly Italian and traditional to their own sensibilities.\n\nIt took Brawn and Schumacher's combined hard-headedness to see Ferrari successful again, and I think they are frankly in need of a similar dose of outside influence."", ""Adami has always been a bot with weird communication, doesn't give out details very well, and it simply seems he doesn't control the English language very well. Both as a sender and a receiver.\n\n\nHe needed to go a long time ago. Xavi got replaced, surely Adami can go?""]",3408,372,0.97,3408,341,341,692,43,0.0,692

The commentators are wrong. The 30 second penalty for ignoring the 2nd stop is ONLY of the race is suspended and cannot be resumed. If the 2 stop rule is ignored and the race finishes at normal it will be a DQ. The same way it is for ignoring the one stop rule in a regular race.

1kultn2,F1 ghost car video is completely inaccurate.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kultn2/f1_ghost_car_video_is_completely_inaccurate/,2025-05-24, Technical,"I really like the new ghost car videos but it seems the data is inaccurate. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUcbbUKWpxA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUcbbUKWpxA)

F1 Tempo shows Leclerc ahead in the tunnel by 1.5-2 tenths. Yet the ghost video shows Norris ahead at this point. It seems they either sync up the second ghost to always be ahead or just make the whole thing up. 

Idk how F1 tempo gets their data but i heard they are very accurate most of the time. ","['I always wondered if the ghosts were actually accurate.', ""Honestly its pretty tricky to calculate. First of all you are converting a gps position to relative position. Then you have to project it onto the camera using the correct FOV.\n\nI also don't believe they update GPS position very frequently (maybe every 100ms?) so you are essentially getting a linear interpolation between all of the GPS points\n\nDon't forget that when the source car updates GPS and when the ghost car updates GPS is also out of sync, so you are inevitably going to have interpolation warping.\n\nIt's cool tech, but it's also implicitly inaccurate.\n\nEDIT: Oh also, the live view of the source car is not when they are calculating the relative position from the source. So even from that perspective it is out of sync.  \nThat is, what you are seeing from the onboard, is not the data they are using to calculate the position of the ghost. It's from the GPS data of the source car. If they were to project the source car GPS onto the onboard, you would see pretty large desyncs.\n\nYou know what. If I wanted to save myself a lot of work with the 3D projection, I would probably just import the relative data into a 3D box engine like Gadot/Unreal/Unity, match the FOV in engine, and render out the movement of the entity with a transparent background.  \nThen you could easily just overlay the recording on top of the onboard and you don't have to do jack shit."", ""Sorry OP, I would really love it if F1-tempo was that accurate, but it's not. I think the 3d video has slightly better data, but they're both wrong. I'm just comparing the sector times here.\n\nOn the end of the first sector (after Casino square), per F1-tempo, Leclerc is 0.05-0.1 s ahead, but we actually know that the 1st sector was 18.216 for Norris and 18.290 for Leclerc, so .074 better for Norris, which matches the video.\n\nOn the end of the second sector (after Tabac) the 3d video shows Norris quite a bit ahead, maybe 0.15s (which means Norris had the better 2rd sector), while F1-tempo shows the gap still in the 0.05-0.08s range in favour or Leclerc (so an equal second sector). The actual times show that Charles had a better sector by 0.074s (33.180 vs 33.254) and, incredibly, Norris and Leclerc were level by the 2nd sector line, 51.470s. \n\nThe third sector, per the 3d video Norris might have even been slower, given how far ahead he was entering the swimming pool section, and on F1-tempo, Norris had a 0.185s better sector. In real life, Norris was .109 faster (18.484 vs 18.593).\n\nSo yeah, none of those are very good.\n\nEDIT: TL;DR, it was more or less like this:\n\n1st sector - F1-tempo off by 0.15 for LEC, 3D pretty much right.\n\n2nd sector - F1-tempo off by 0.075 for NOR, 3D off by 0.15 for NOR\n\n3rd sector - F1-tempo off by 0.075 for NOR, 3D off by 0.15 for LEC"", 'Is F1 Tempo 100% accurate?', ""It just looks shit with how much it lags and slides. They have literally all the data they need, I don't know why they can't just overlay it better."", ""Hey there, I'm the creator of F1 Tempo and thought I would chime in. I can't speak for how F1 calculates relative position in their videos, but I can of course comment on how it's done in F1 Tempo. \n\nThe comment by u/f1bythenumbers pretty much nails it in terms of how the deltas calculations work. The core problem that causes inaccuracy is the low frequency data. As distance is calculated by integrating speed, the error in the distance accrues quickly and by the end of the lap there can be large discrepancies. Additionally, laps are taken with difference racing lines, so aligning the data to perform a direct and accurate comparison is difficult.\n\nIn F1 Tempo, I do a drift adjustment using the known total lap time delta to produce a cleaner result. This is crude, because it's only using a single correction to adjust the entire lap, so data within the lap is prone contain drift. \n\nI've been aware of this problem for some time, and have been hard at work on a brand new version of a site that does a better job of delta calculations. I now use the known sector times and distances to perform drift adjustments at the sector markings as well. This certainly doesn't solve the problem completely, but it does help. \n\nThe name of the new site is called GP Tempo, and you can check out the same telemetry [by clicking here](https://gp-tempo.com/app?year=2025&roundnumber=8&session=4&drivers=%5B%22NOR%22%2C%22LEC%22%5D&laps=%5B%7B%22y%22%3A2025%2C%22r%22%3A8%2C%22s%22%3A4%2C%22d%22%3A%22NOR%22%2C%22l%22%3A26%2C%22c%22%3A%22%23F47600%22%7D%2C%7B%22y%22%3A2025%2C%22r%22%3A8%2C%22s%22%3A4%2C%22d%22%3A%22LEC%22%2C%22l%22%3A26%2C%22c%22%3A%22%23ED1131%22%7D%5D&tab=telemetry).\n\nTL:DR, deltas are an approximation, GP Tempo has an improved approach, but the results should still be taken with grain of salt."", 'The data is the same, but gp-tempo.com has a much improved interface that you should use (made by the same guy)', 'I hope all you realize that Norris‚Äôs car is 3D here.\xa0\n\nAs a vfx artist, i can day it is not easy to make it better.', ""Unfortunately, neither F1 Tempo or any other site that uses the Fast-F1 api will be correct.

For Monaco and it's mandatory 2 stop rule you can add a rule that all drivers are allowed to change tyres under a red flag, but tyres used only when a VSC or VC was out do not count as having been used (so you can't get 2 tyre changes out of a single VC upgraded to red flag)."", 'Everybody is talking about pit stops during formation laps (which aren‚Äôt allowed), but what about the formation lap after a red flag?\n\nFor example: red flag on lap 1, and everyone changes tires during the red flag.

This got me thinking, could Merc have done it too? I know they were out the points so it was never have been worth doing, but purely from a theoretical point of view, when Albon was doing 1:19s , could Antonelli have gone even slower , say 1:23s or something, building up a 4s gap per lap with Russell? Then allowing Russell to pit when a big enough gap had formed ?

It would have made it even more farcical if the cars were going ultra slow, like 15s off pole lap slow. I'm not even sure if they could've gone that slow and kept the tyres in the right temps, and presumably there is actually a limit where the car behind can actually start to overtake you if you're going so slow.","['They did. Antonelli backed up the pack enough for Russell to do his pitstops', 'They did the backing the pack up but they got an idea like 40 laps too late.', ""They did, eventually, but backing the pack up doesn't help you gain positions - rather just guarantee the position the lead driver currently is in. In fact, it may help the cars ahead if you do that. Since they were just out of the points, it's reasonable that they gambled that they might be able to at least interfere with Williams' games by sticking together and waiting it out.\n\nOut of the three teams that could really back up the pack to protect their positions, they were also really on the back foot being the furthest back and most likely to have it mess them up more to do it early. We saw the Williams' backing up game help RB out a bunch - Liam was able to take advantage of the gap made for Alex, and got his two stops in as well, whereas otherwise he may have had to be fully sacrificed and dropped out of the points to help Isack.\nThen, Williams were able to swap their drivers to get their stops in, but Merc didn't have that benefit of a team behind them doing the same play to create a gap in the way Williams did for RB- they just had the early stoppers back there who they would just get stuck behind if they pitted. And, if they created a gap for Russell to pit, theoretically they would have built that protected window for Williams anyway (A la how Lawson benfitted), so not only would they not gain, they actually may help the cars ahead with that move.\n\nIn the end, it cost Antonelli his drop to P18 from P12, but there just weren't many opportunities in play anyway.

The ONLY time Monaco is exciting is when it rains.

Thus I would propose the following:

- Make Monaco a Sprint weekend

- Reduce the number of support races, as more prep time will be required between sessions. 

- Have Pirelli bring significantly more sets of inters to the track.

- Prior to every session including the race, and assuming it‚Äôs not raining, send a bunch of water trucks out to wet down the track, to make it suitable for inters but not to the point of needing full wets.  

- Do not wet the run-off areas, the chicane cutting areas, the inside of the tunnel, and the pit lane - for safety purposes. Perhaps avoid wetting the curbs on the racing line at Sainte Devote, Nouvelle Chicane, and the swimming pool. 

- If there are any red flags in the race, re-wet the track once it is safe, unless it is actually raining. This might be just wetting the standard racing line and not the full track width for time reasons.

- Make Beau Rivage a second DRS zone. This may not be applicable if the 2026 rules eliminate DRS.
