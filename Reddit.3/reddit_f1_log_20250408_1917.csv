Now Ralf Schumacher told Sky Deutschland that Doohan might be replaced by Colapinto as soon as the next race. If that’s the case and Alpine retained Colapinto next year, by then he would be a “rookie” with a whopping 30-race experience. Many drivers have shorter career than that. Conversely, if Doohan managed to find a seat next year, he would not be considered “rookie” despite having just 4-race experience simply because one of those races are the first race.

Is there an official definition of “rookie” driver? I know there is a prescription for who can be considered as “young driver” for the FP1 but I’m not sure the same can be said for “rookie”.","[""I think the F1TV commentators usually say 'Full Season Rookies' to refer to the 6 on the grid.

But, then it becomes the question of what about two races missed? Three? Five?\n\nHonestly, it's a designation that means absolutely nothing except being eligible for rookie records and rookie of the year. The only race important thing is the after 3 GP distinction for rookie practice sessions, which will have Bearman giving up his seat this week.\n\nI think it would be pretty laughable to call Colapinto a rookie if he has nearly a year and a half of races under his belt. Calling Liam a rookie is pretty borderline to me. Actually, I've just this moment decided that a modern driver is a rookie for 24 races. So, come Hungary, Liam won't be a rookie anymore.

Thus, the meaning of that sentence said by Charles after the end of the Japanese GP becomes preclear: ""I go to Sakhir with a different vision of testing. I have a very clear direction that I want to take for what is my driving style, and I hope it pays off."" At this point, Ferrari is technically divided into two separate pits-nothing dramatic: it happens very often in motorsport-each of the two drivers will follow their own path, and Charles is convinced that with the right inputs he will be able to extricate himself from a deficit situation (which so far, however, sees him in a superior position against Lewis).\n\nFerrari, knock yourself out\n\nUnfortunately, the problems slowing Ferrari down are not only in qualifying but also in the race, when the car has to travel low to make the most of the ground effect.\n\nHamilton in Suzuka put it this way, ""More than that pace I didn\'t have, I was struggling with the rear.

I hope the Bahrain GP will allow me to get somewhat closer."" Where the expression ""somehow&gt;&gt;&gt; does not leave one calm.

1ju7eux,[AMuS] Antonelli made a strong Suzuka debut,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ju7eux/amus_antonelli_made_a_strong_suzuka_debut/,2025-04-08, News,,"['If Antonelli does turn out to be superstar as he is currently appearing to do so will Ferrari try to poach him at some point?', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli is a fast learner. The Formula 1 rookie once again impressed in Japan. The Italian is getting closer and closer to George Russell, but also knows where he still needs to improve.\n\n> The hype was huge when Mercedes announced at the Italian Grand Prix in late summer 2024 that Andrea Kimi Antonelli would succeed superstar Lewis Hamilton. A few days earlier, the Italian had just turned 18. His crash during free practice at Monza involuntarily drew attention. The question arose: Does the rookie have what it takes to succeed in Formula 1?\n\n> Three races have now been completed in the still-young 2025 season. And Antonelli has already silenced the critics. The Mercedes rookie finished all three Grands Prix in the points. After fourth place in Melbourne and eighth in Shanghai, Antonelli crossed the finish line in sixth place in Suzuka (April 6th). That\'s 28 points. In addition, there are the two points from the China sprint, when the teenager finished seventh.\n\n> Antonelli has settled into fifth place in the drivers\' standings. Thanks to his more than solid results in the first few races, Mercedes is second in the constructors\' standings. The factory team is already 36 points behind leader McLaren, but Red Bull and Ferrari are easily keeping the Silver Arrows at bay.\n\n> **Leading laps in Suzuka.**\nThe weekend in Japan didn\'t start particularly well for Antonelli. While teammate George Russell was long considered the only driver who could potentially challenge the McLaren, Antonelli struggled with the conditions. The Bologna-born teenager still had to learn the challenging rollercoaster. He also struggled with tire management to perfectly warm up the sensitive Pirelli tires for a fast lap.\n\n> After reserve driver Valtteri Bottas gave the rookie a few tips, things suddenly flowed smoothly: sixth place in qualifying, just one position and two-tenths of a second behind Russell. Things went even better for Antonelli in the race. While his opponents stopped earlier than him, he was able to record the first lead laps of his Formula 1 career. ""When I had clear air, the pace really improved and I was able to extend my stint on the medium tires. That was a good feeling.""\n\n> Antonelli was able to take advantage of the fresh tires towards the end of the race, setting two records. The youngster needed just 1:30.965 minutes for his 50th lap – no one in the race was able to beat that. Never before has a younger driver recorded a fastest lap and led a Grand Prix. World champion Max Verstappen was 6,803 days old in Barcelona in 2016. Antonelli was three days younger on race day in Japan when he achieved the feat.\nAntonelli is aware of his record: ""It was a nice feeling to lead the race for a few laps and to be the youngest driver in Formula 1 history to do so.""\n\n> **Russell as a benchmark.**\nThe development direction of the driver, described as a super talent, is in the right direction. But when will Antonelli first be on par with George Russell? He appears calm. ""I hope it will happen as soon as possible. But we also have to look at how strong George\'s start to the season has been. He already showed how good he is last year.""\n\n> According to Antonelli, part of the gap is also due to a lack of maturity: ""George always gets the most out of the car. I think that has to do with experience."" However, the challenger remains firmly convinced he can beat Russell at some point: ""The potential is there.""\n\n> **Student Antonelli.**\nSomeone who could give him tips on how to realize his potential at the pinnacle of motorsport is Valentino Rossi. Before the Japanese Grand Prix, Antonelli met up with his compatriot for a go-kart session. The nine-time motorcycle world champion shared some stories from his career. ""He told me a lot about his time. Now I want to go to MotoGP myself,"" the rookie beamed.\n\n> Before that, however, there are still Formula 1 races on the schedule. Antonelli also has to go to school for a few weeks. The final exam period is approaching. According to Mercedes, math is his particular problem area. He could ask his numerous engineers for some tutoring. The rookie is a great learner. He\'s already proven that in his short time as an F1 driver.', ""This kid is unreal at the moment, he is performing to the cars level and is keeping pace with George. So far I'm very impressed.\xa0"", 'When I read ""school"", I thought he was finishing up university - then I remembered he\'s just 18!\n\nI am really, really curious what it\'s like attending high/secondary school while being an F1 driver. I imagine it must seem faintly ridiculous to have to think about final exams at all, given his job...', 'Calling it now Bearman vs Antonelli will be the next great rivalry in the 2030s.', 'After watching 3 race I starting to like him. Let how the season end.', 'I thought the kid was overhyped as hell and that it was a mistake to directly put him into the Mercedes but Toto might have done a fantastic call with him.', 'Future superstar in the making ❤️❤️❤️', 'Rookie just showed the potential of that Mercedes.

1juagi3,"[Autoracer.it] Ferrari, the package is important: here's what new features we'll see on the SF-25 in Bahrain",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1juagi3/autoracerit_ferrari_the_package_is_important/,2025-04-08, News,,"['Such a below-expectation start to the season clearly prompted the team led by Loic Serra to revise development plans from the outset. Australia first, then China, and finally Japan highlighted the problems with which this SF-25 was born. “We can\'t turn as high as we would like,” Lewis Hamilton\'s no-nonsense confirmation in the Suzuka post-qualifying session was the final judgment regarding the limitations that are crippling Ferrari\'s real potential. In the first three outings, the car remained virtually the same at the level of the aerodynamic map but, despite this, the car offered some dynamics that are still unclear to Vasseur\'s men, ""We have to solve the balancing problems that are affecting us. If we make the most of the car, I think there is still potential to be extracted.""\n\nThe problems of a rear end that was too soft structurally already surfaced at the tests, Leclerc had already talked about it with some people very close to him. The issues came out in the open for good in Melbourne. Then in China, Ferrari decided to take a risk with the set-up, at the price of a disqualification for Lewis Hamilton\'s skid wear. Suzuka was the GP of awareness: the SF-25 “limited” by heights - there is talk of about 3 mm of extra height - expressed fourth-force potential overall. An overly negative result, which sentences that the redhead has on average lost 3-4 tenths to McLaren in a single winter. Running with set-ups that “cripple” the SF-25 by about 20 load points makes a major contribution to the technical lag that is being blamed on the current benchmark dictated by the MCL39. While waiting for the work in Maranello to bear fruit with the arrival of specific correctives, it emerges in blatant manners that the car has problems that are not so immediate to solve.\n\nUrgent technical reaction: here\'s how Ferrari changes in Bahrain. Will the new parts limit the evils of the SF-25?\n\nThe first evolutionary step to be put in place on the red car, placed under the decision-making guidance of Loic Serra, comes on the Sakhir track, a track of which there are many references thanks to the pre-season testing at the end of February. The technical run-up to McLaren does not look like an impossible task, but still not as fast as one might think (or hope). The arrival of new parts at race number four is, in itself, the concentration of expected components spread over the stages just ahead. It was never in Ferrari\'s plan to bring new parts to Suzuka, either for logistical reasons or because of choices the team wanted to make, despite the fact that in any case the team on the eve of the race knew it had to run on the defensive. For Bahrain, the SF-25 will be fitted, as anticipated, with an initial overhaul of the bottom as a whole.  \nThe areas of intervention were the neuralgic ones, of which it is always delicate to go to get hands on as they go to “mess up” some variables on the behavior of the car. However, given the state of affairs, the car needed a reshuffling of the load so that the changes can make the car more “predictable.” Novelties on a global level implemented touching venturi channels and extractor, updated in their overall. A real macro-upgrade intended purely for performance and peak load stability, studied in the tunnel in winter and deliberated at the beginning of the season. It is clear that the SF-25\'s balance problems, given by a rear end that always struggles to follow a front end-which, by design choice, is very pointed-may not be fully resolved in Bahrain. With these F1s we have often seen how an aerodynamic package can offer less than the factory data but there have been instances where a package has also overperformed than expected. There is confidence, however, that the platform of the SF-25 should in part benefit from the new parts in order to achieve greater balance and allow more consistent load to be expressed. Cautious optimism leaks out from Maranello on this aspect.\n\n\\[1/2\\]', 'Next year is our year', 'If these dont do much or even worse, backfire, I’d say Ferrari won’t win the championship.', ""People talked about a big upgrade coming in Bahrain, so here we go. In light of the big upgrade, I really really really hate Charles missing FP1. It's a bad idea. For teams not bringing a major upgrade, it's a good idea, sure, because they just did testing in Bahrain. But I hate this for Charles. Missing one free practice can be really rough. Then, what if something red flags FP2 or FP3 for an extended time? Giving up an FP1 when there's a major upgrade is just putting Charles at a massive disadvantage, and I don't like it at all."", 'https://preview.redd.it/l9qcjcv9ilte1.jpeg?width=678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d2472f2f0002bb3bf97a7d32a320916c567babe', 'Next race is our race', 'I am frightened.  😂', 'Ferrari deserves the win again once they make it look like less of a HP website banner.

1juilz6,Concept Convergence: The one thing that is not being brought up in the “difficult to overtake” conversations this season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1juilz6/concept_convergence_the_one_thing_that_is_not/,2025-04-08, Discussion,"In Adrian Newey’s 2017 autobiography, “How to build a car”, Newey brings up how the 2016 grid was almost a monolith, and how the racing became less exciting because “all cars looked the same”. He cites “concept convergence” as at times inevitable, but also a sign of a bad cycle of regulations. This has been the persistent problem of the post-2023 regs and why overtaking has been so difficult this season. The cars are the most identical they have been, and that’s a problem.

Some things that I noticed when browsing about discussions as to why the Japanese Grand Prix was a parade, is that people bring up the usual suspects of weight, dirty air by outwash, tyres lasting too long, and the cars just being too large in general. While dirty air will always be a contributor to bad racing, it is important to remember that the first half of 2022 had some of the best racing we’ve ever seen, with cars being the same size they are now, and the heaviest they’ve ever been (the 2022 cars are F1s all time heaviest cars), with tyres lasting much longer than they do now as well.

The reason why the first half of 2022 had exciting racing was plainly and simply, concept divergence. We had three functional concepts: The Red Bull downward sloping sidepod concept, the Merc “zero-pod” or “hide-pod” concept, and the Ferrari Bathtub concept. The Red Bull had great straight-line speed, the Ferrari was great in high-speed corners, the Merc was great in the low-speed corners and in tyre preservation. However, with TD39, and the 2023 floor edge regulations, everything changed.

By mid-2023, Ferrari abandoned the bathtubs, and Merc also joined the Red Bull concept in 2024. The cars more or less look the same now, and while some cars have different qualities than others (McLaren having a high-speed corner advantage last season and a tyre advantage this season), the characteristics of the cars are broadly the same, and the field spread is the lowest it has ever been. This, understandably, makes overtaking difficult, even with DRS. In 2021, while dirty air was still a problem, concept divergence was very strong with three different concepts pioneered by the three major engine manufacturers. Different cars still had different driving characteristics (like the Red Bull high rake concept vs the Merc low rake concept), while having roughly the same pace. This is not the case this season, as the variance in driving characteristics is extremely low.

In conclusion, this regulatory cycle has run its course, and the racing is not going to get any better. Hopefully, the 2026 regs allow for more concept divergence, which in turn will improve the product we see on track. While dirty air, weight, and the size of cars contribute to bad racing, concept convergence is the death knell for a regulatory cycle and what signifies the need for change. I am curious to know if anyone else had any thoughts on this. Thanks for reading.","['Spec series literally have identical cars and still far more overtakes than F1. If anything, the smaller the difference between cars is the closer the racing is.', '>In 2021, while dirty air was still a problem, concept divergence was very strong\n\n...and overtaking was still difficult, so...', 'Spec series has the best racing though, so all teams being very similar would be ideal.', 'I think design convergence and performance convergence can be separately analysed. One thing I really liked about 2022 ground effect regulations is that we had three distinct designs from the top 3 teams - Red Bull Racing, Mercedes, and Ferrari (as you mentioned). With time as teams saw performance benefits in one design over the other (Mercedes abandoning zero sidepods), and teams running into FIA TDs (Ferrari with flexi floor) we eventually see everyone settling into more or less a similar design concept. It just happens to be that McLaren have nailed all the critical parts - suspension geometry as well as sidepods and floor design. It’s not a coincidence that eventually all cars start to look alike as we get closer to end of current regulations. \n\nNow on the difficulty in overtaking part, it’s more about teams being closer to one another than ever before (qualifying gaps are a good indicator of just how close the field is) in terms of *performance*, since more or less every team now has a good understanding of current regulations. In Suzuka, Pirelli having an oversight in expected tyre deg due to track resurfacing led them to use same compounds instead of going a step softer which would’ve produced better racing. \n\n2026 regulations are shaping up to be similar to start of turbo-hybrid era in 2014 i.e. [a power unit formula](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/big-chance-f1-2026-is-engine-formula-adrian-newey/). Aero will have little role to play, at least initially, and eventually we will see design as well as performance convergence with time, just like we always do.', 'The issue is mainly the change to the floor edge in 2023. Raising this was done to remove porpoising but ended up forcing teams to try and seal the floor with a bunch of complex structures that created tons of outwash and vorticities.', ""This is a bastardization of what Newey said, and doesn't make much sense from any perspective you look at it. \n\nDo you know what season had better racing than the first half of 2022? 2024. This was because the cars were much closer in performance to each other than at any other times in theses regs. 2022 was more exciting from a car development perspective, because of the concepts being different. In addition, there's something to be said about cars being better in quali or in the race making things more exciting. However, it doesn't make sense to say the racing is not going to get any better this year, after three races, and it really doesn't make sense to blame concept convergence for the poor race in Japan. \n\nIf you looked at the first couple races of 2024, you would have thought we were going to be in for a terrible season. If we followed your hypothesis, it would have been. But we had a genuinely good year of racing overall, with lots of tight battles. \n\nThis year, we've had a fantastic race and a couple of boring ones, what is looking to be a genuine title fight, and four cars within three tenths in both quali and race pace on most circuits. It's very hard to predict, but there is no reason to think this will be a bad year."", ""That's not really true, the main reason for the low overtake is that f1 cars have been designed to spew a lot of dirty air making it hard to get a slipstream and their increased size. In spec series you can only change your set up you can't design your car to spew more dirty air. Which is why 2022 saw a lot of overtakes and close racing. The regs were new So people were still figuring the regs. So far no team has been to increase their dirty air tolerance. The size of the cars has made it so that even more dirty is spew due to size and overtaking harder as car now takes up more of the track."", 'A lot of spec series have refueling, and some have more tyre changes as well, which adds variance to the handling characteristics of cars. F1 does not have that privilege, not with tyre compounds being limited to three per race to save expenses, and refueling removed due to safety. Weight and size are also heavily regulated for safety reasons. That leaves concept divergence as the best possible option to encourage good racing', 'Yes, but again, the racing was good because two cars of two different concepts had roughly the same pace']",0,17,0.44,0,15,15,0,2,0.03999999999999998,0

That\'s more than can be said for Liam or even Checo at some points.\n\nHe messed up somewhere in Q2 and wasn\'t able to put in a solid lap there, and was further off Max\'s pace than he had been up until that point. It was an error on his part on the lap that mattered, on top of a bit of a difficult tyre call from the team.

Not exactly amazing feats for an RBR, but then few others managed to make any gains in the race either way, so it\'s something. He didn\'t go backwards and he didn\'t make any errors, which again is a step up from Lawson, if faint praise.\n\nIt\'s hard to say how much he could or should have been capable of in the race, given that none of the other top team\'s drivers were ""out of position"" on the grid. I feel like Max, or even the Ferrari/Mercs would have managed to gain some more places and get past the likes of Alonso and Bearman, the only data point we have is that Hamilton got past Hadjar in a few laps. Maybe it was harder for Yuki to make moves in the midfield train, but maybe he should have managed to gain more places and grabbed a few points.\n\nIt was always going to be difficult for Tsunoda to jump into a new car with no practice, one which is notoriously hard to drive. He didn\'t do amazing but he didn\'t do terribly, and there are positive signs. It\'s always going to be hard to say how well Lawson would have done given a few more races at more comfortable tracks for him, but for now at least, Yuki does seem to have been the better choice.
