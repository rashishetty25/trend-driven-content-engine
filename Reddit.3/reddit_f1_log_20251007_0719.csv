1nzdv3y,Why Piastri fans are rightfully upset,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nzdv3y/why_piastri_fans_are_rightfully_upset/,2025-10-06, See pinned comment,"*Obligatory note that this is a long discussion of the so-called ""fair Papaya Rules"" that have been implemented so far, if it's not your cup of tea you can sit out.*

I think the main reason why a lot of fans, specifically Piastri fans, are so frustrated with what happened in Singapore isn't because of the move itself - it is because of the precedent that McLaren have set this entire season with their meddling in the driver's races.

Before the season, the team had explicitly stated that if they are the top running team, they will be ""letting the drivers race"" so long as they adhere to the ""Papaya Rules"". As of this point, both drivers and the team have stated this means basically **""**[**do not make contact with each other**](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/brown-opens-up-on-papaya-rules-and-mclaren-team-orders-debate-as-norris.5y1UmREKJB6qZCNmQM9Zdt)**""**

**R1 - Australia:** However, in the first race of the season, there is already a team order being implemented to have Piastri hold position during the wet-dry transition just as he was entering Norris' DRS. We can say that it was justified due to the conditions, but a team order is a team order. This is the first marker that the team was already backtracking on their pre-season ethos.

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOAXze2VkaU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOAXze2VkaU) start from 10:53

Between Australia and Monaco, Piastri loses out in the Miami sprint to Norris after he benefits from a last minute safety car. In Imola where a trigger-happy early pitstop strategy forces Piastri, who qualified ahead, to pit far too early and into traffic. A consequential second early pitstop allows Norris to extend and end up behind Piastri with a 20 lap tyre advantage at the safety car restart. Norris overtakes and ends up P2. Part of racing, but Norris' pitwall was allowed to attack.

**R8 - Monaco:** to summarize, Piastri's entire race and strategy is to ensure that Norris' victory is protected by preventing an undercut from Leclerc. This is confirmed by team personnel and by Norris himself. Since it is Monaco, overtaking is a distant myth, but Piastri could have attempted an undercut on Leclerc himself had his strategy been allowed to do so, but Piastri plays the team game.

**R10 - Canada:** A new suspension specifically designed for Norris is implemented on his car. Piastri still qualifies ahead. However, once again a strong strategy from Norris' pitwall allows him to catch Piastri near the end of the race. He ends up crashing into Piastri and ending his own race, with Piastri luckily escaping a DNF. Norris rightfully takes immediate blame and the situation is diffused.

[This is how the situation was addressed by Stella](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/stella-says-norris-and-piastri-collision-not-acceptable-as-he-admits-briton.5I2G0joimFftevHuEeJDjj):

**R11 - Austria:** The first aberration in how these intra-team pressure points are addressed occurs. Piastri has a close call after a lock up whilst battling Norris for 1st place during the opening 20 laps. Note that after this lock up, an [immediate reprimand](https://youtu.be/Wj6DHG0X66k?si=PetzvPX8NrPepGcC) is given to Piastri from his engineer. Piastri even apologises for this after the race. Note that no contact has been made between the cars. [Stella addresses](https://racingnews365.com/mclaren-explains-why-it-felt-oscar-piastris-move-was-over-the-top) the scenario with the same severity and tone as Norris' **collision.** 

https://preview.redd.it/rrkr5qir5gtf1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=00646d24c036915c3322caa9290214a06f8311ad

**R12 - Silverstone:** Piastri receives a 10s penalty for erratic driving, allowing Norris to win the race. Piastri immediately questions his team. We can go round-and-round about the validity of that penalty, but McLaren, although agreeing that the penalty was unfair, do not even bother to contest it with the FIA. 

https://preview.redd.it/x4fqwtkp6gtf1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d608732953eae874b5b9125ca464abc0428eed

[Note that both Stella and Verstappen have agreed the penalty was harsh. ](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mclaren-lays-out-factors-on-why-it-felt-piastris-british-gp-penalty-was-very-harsh/10740013/)At the time, Piastri's request is dismissed as desperate and absurd, but I hope recent events can shed a new perspective on this. It is less about the penalty and more so about backing your driver when a perceived injustice has occurred.

**R13 - Belgium:** Piastri overtakes Norris to inherit the lead on lap one. Piastri is placed onto medium tyres. Norris in contrast goes on a hard-tyre strategy aiming for a one-stop and forcing Piastri to commit to the one-stop as well. Note that this is a two-step harder compound, giving Norris a major advantage. Once again, Norris is fairly allowed to try and attack for the lead, but Piastri holds him off.

**R14 - Hungary:** Piastri qualifies ahead and is committed to the two-stop strategy, which was assumed to be the 'optimal strategy'. Norris, after a rough lap 1, commits to a one-stop which turns out to be the better one. Piastri has to remind his team that he is racing Norris, not Leclerc, and manages to catch up to Norris. Once again, he is reminded before even attacking to [""remember how we go racing""](https://imgur.com/a/onboard-piastri-almost-running-into-norris-WSTosxT). A subsequent lock up happens, **but no contact is made**. 

At this point in the season, it is clear that Norris is fully allowed to attack and try and get ahead with no intervention from the team. **This is not the issue, as it is part of racing and he is entitled to do so.**

**R16 - Monza:** I think this race has been dissected enough times, but this is where the second major aberration occurs. 

First, **Piastri is asked to provide a tow to Norris** to ensure that he will pass into Q3. I don't believe this mattered in the end, but **why is Piastri being asked to help out his direct rival once again?** Not to mention how Norris tried to get a sneaky tow from him in Spain as well?

https://preview.redd.it/0iavnvifagtf1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf599d53ec7bcaa684bdbbe9b1c83acc649ea2e8

Into the race, Norris falls behind Piastri after willingly giving up his pitstop priority to ensure no threat of Piastri overtaking him under a safety car and a presumable ""threat"" of an undercut from Leclerc. A slow stop means Piastri comes out ahead, the team requests a swap, Piastri obliges **after explicitly stating that a slow stop was deemed to be ""part of racing"" by the team.**

What people are missing here is that **Norris was** **guaranteed that Piastri would not undercut him**. Keep in mind all those previous races where Norris was fully allowed to attack and use alternate strategy calls to successfully get ahead of Piastri, yet somehow he is able to dictate both his and Piastri's strategy and be **guaranteed by the team** that his position will remain? Moreover, why does the team care if Piastri would be undercut by Leclerc? They were over double in points ahead of the second team in the WCC, a 2 point loss would not have made even a fraction of injury.

**R18 - Singapore:** This leads us to Singapore. Keep in mind that up to this point:

* Norris has been fully allowed to try alternate strategies to get ahead of Piastri even though he was often the car behind during qualifying and the race.
* Norris has collided with Piastri
* Piastri has been publicly reprimanded for two lockups which have been given the same severity as Norris' collision
* Piastri has received several requests to help out the team and his rival, even though he is the championship leader.

After Piastri has qualified ahead once again (I hope you can see the pattern now), Norris takes an aggressive and opportunistic move in the opening turns, making contact with Verstappen and subsequently colliding with his teammate and nearly forcing him into the wall. Note several things:

* No reprimand is given to Norris over the radio whatsoever.
* Piastri is rightfully upset and requests team intervention as this is a clear violation of the most explicit ""Papaya Rule"". No intervention is done, and Piastri explicitly calls it unfair.
* In contrast to Canada, Norris has not taken any responsibility for this collision nor shown any remorse.
* Most pertinent, [Zak Brown calls it ""fair and clean racing""](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/clearly-just-hard-racing-mclarens-brown-and-stella-give-verdict-on-norris.1cEdvCBHmLSoFPKF73dmAW)**.**

https://preview.redd.it/3o2fy3jocgtf1.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e0daad85e1918ea9e4b823f804be44d3f2e372

On top of that, **Norris is once again able to dictate Piastri's pitstop strategy**, with no sign of the pitwall making any attempt to get Piastri ahead (by a potential undercut etc..). Piastri receives an equally slow stop as in Monza, increasing his gap to Norris from 4s to 9s. Piastri is able to reduce the gap to Norris to 2s by the end. Do the math.

My point with this post is to highlight the contrasting nature of these team interventions by Mclaren. Norris is now responsible for two teammate collisions that could have had disastrous consequences, yet Piastri is made to apologize for two lockups with the same intensity. Norris' pitwall is fully allowed to try and get ahead when he is behind, but Piastri's strategy becomes ""team focused"" and redundant.

I am not calling out or placing blame on any driver, but rather to illustrate that this bullshit ""two number one drivers"" ethos does not work when this team is so hellbent on contradicting themselves. Mclaren has tried to make this seem as ""impartial"" of a fight between the two drivers, but their actions do not follow. And the ""unconscious bias"" that may or may not exist for one driver is becoming less of a fallacy and more so reality.","[""Obviously this is a controversial topic, but OP has made an effort to present their point of view and it could be a good starting point for a discussion.\n\nIn order to make sure this thread doesn't derail, please keep in mind the following rules:\n\n* Fair criticism of teams and drivers is permitted, but don't let it turn into blind hatred.\n* Don't attack or generalise fanbases.

As a multi-generational fan of F1, I’m going to stand on my soap box and say I think that the inability of cars to follow other cars, and it’s impact on overtaking, is the worst In F1 history. The regulatory change was beyond ineffective.

If we cast our minds back to the 2021 season and broadly that era of cars, we saw plenty of
 on-track battles for points and wins.

2025 in particular has turned F1 into a qualifying formula, where we leave a weekend often unsure of who had the fastest car on a Sunday. The kind of lap time delta’s we have needed to see at many tracks to overtake (most recently Baku and Singapore) seem well over 1 second per lap. Aside from the first couple of corners, we are being robbed of results being decided on a Sunday, or the fastest driver on a Sunday winning races. 

One example, which is not like-for-like by remarkably similar: Hungary 2019, Hamilton pits from second to fresh tyres due to lack of ability to pass Max, catches him and passes for the win. 2025 Piastri pits from the lead, 3 laps earlier than Lewis did in 2019, and got stuck in the dirty air.

The spectacle is being lost. I really hope 2026 changes things.","[""You clearly haven't seen the 2020 season xD"", 'Dirty Air is way better than pre 2022.\n2017-2021 the Cars were downforce monsters producing massive Dirty Air.\nToday Problem are the tires.\nSofts lasting like 5 laps. Hards lasting forever.', ""Did you forget the field is about as close as it's been? Top 5 in qualifying often separated by 1-2 tenths.\n\nYes, dirty air is quite bad. But I refuse to believe that cars that rely way more on ground effect have more outwash and worse dirty air than the ones before them. How is that even possible? No, the dirty air is less than previous regulation cycle but the cars are also closer in pace.\n\nThat said dirty air has dramatically increased since 2022. That's for damn sure.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why bother with prescriptive rules when the teams will always find a way. Why not instead just have a metric. E.g. your CFD model needs to have no more than X amount of dirty air. i.e. regulate dirty air with a metric rather than by prescribing design. And then have more permissive design as long as it complies with the dirty air metric, all good."", ""The dirty air is nowhere near as bad as it was in the 2017-2021 regulations, and it's significantly better than it was in the 90's and 2000's. We used to see drivers struggle to get within 2s at tracks like Hungary and Spain - now it's common to see drivers within 1s lap after lap.\n\nIf you look at the live timings throughout a GP, you regularly see drivers within DRS range for multiple laps, sometimes even entire stints. A good example was the Sprint in Spa.\n\nRegarding Hungary 2019 - Max was on old tyres that had degraded heavily. In the 2025 race, Norris' hard tyres had very low deg so the delta to overtake wasn't met.\n\nThe lack of overtaking in 2025 is due to two reasons:\n\n  \n\\- The tyres, especially the hards, usually have close to zero deg in most races. China, Spain, Monza and Spa show that it's not just the street tracks. Therefore, the delta between cars is minimal.\n\n\\- The field is closer than it's ever been, which means the delta is minimal.\n\nIn previous years, for example 2018, we had much more tyre deg and much larger gaps between cars, so we had more overtaking."", 'No the dirty air problem is smaller than pre 2022, but car parity is higher.
