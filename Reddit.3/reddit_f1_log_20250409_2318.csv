Hope he does well.', 'I love how this massive project and ambition is another way for Max to relax. Dude just lives and breathes racing', 'Translation:\n\nAfter being launched in 2022 as an umbrella for the rally adventure of Jos Verstappen, the GT career of Thierry Vermeulen and the sim race activities of Team Redline, the next step will be taken in 2025 with Verstappen.com Racing by participating in the GT World Challenge Europe (GTWCE) through the support of existing teams. Chris Lulham, who comes from the sim race, will participate in the GTCE Endurance Cup with GTCE drivers Harry King and Thierry Vermeulen in an Aston Martin Vantage AMR GT3 EVO. Next weekend they have their first appointment at Paul Ricard in southern France, where a 6-hour race is scheduled.\n\nOne of Verstappen\'s ambitions is to help talented sim drivers make the step to the real circuit. He wants to prove that sim racing can be a great substitute for a career through karting, which not everyone has the money for. The 22-year-old Lulham is the first sim racer chosen by Verstappen for this. ""Chris has a long track record at Team Redline, Max\'s sim race team,"" Raymond Vermeulen told Motorsport.com. ""Max has a high hat on him, because he always comes with good feedback when adjusting the virtual car. Last year, he once invited Chris for a private test. He got in and had a good speed from the first lap, even though the conditions on the track were very difficult at that time. This made it clear to us that he has a lot of talent and can handle the transition from the sim to the real GT3s. Then we started testing with him more often.‚Äù\n\nThe 24-year-old King has walked a more traditional path. He started in karting before climbing the Ginetta ladder in England. After becoming champion in the Ginetta GT4 Supercup in 2019, titles in the British Porsche Carrera Cup and the Porsche Carrera Cup Benelux followed. Last year he finished second in both the Porsche Supercup and the extremely competitive German Porsche Carrera Cup. ""A fast, experienced boy, a real racer"", describes Vermeulen the Brit. ""After he happened to be available last year due to circumstances, we quickly recorded him for this year."" Vermeulen\'s son Thierry, who has been on the road in motorsport since 2020 and has been part of Verstappen.com Racing since the first hour, completes the driver cast.\n\nVerstappen.com Racing is working with an existing team for the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe: 2 Seas Motorsport. ""The relationship with 2 Seas Motorsport has been there for a long time"", Vermeulen explains. ""Nick Cristofaro, who after racing himself has set up his own race team with the Bahraini Isa Al Khalifa, is a good friend of Max."" Since the beginning of 2024, Verstappen has owned an Aston Martin Vantage, which he occasionally takes on the circuit. For these moments, he already called on the team from Silverstone for practical support. Vermeulen: ""It was therefore logical for us to also take this step with them to the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe.""\n\n**Despite his busy Formula 1 career, Verstappen is very closely involved in the GT3 project.** For example, he assists the drivers with advice and action during private tests and SIM sessions, but he also interferes with the livery, he has helped find a good basic adjustment for the car and gives his input to the engineers in preparation for the race weekend. ""Of course, he himself made enough meters with that car to be able to make a good contribution to the baseline set-up"", says Vermeulen. **""He also helped develop the sim models of the Aston Martin, so to convert what they tested on the circuit to the sim.""**\n\n**Ambitious goals**\n\nRegarding the goals for the first year of Verstappen.com Racing as a participant in the GT World Challenge Europe, Vermeulen says: ""We are ambitious. We don\'t participate to fill the field, we participate for the marbles. We want to drive at the front regularly."" Vermeulen acknowledges that this will not be an easy task in the extremely competitive GT World Challenge. ""There are big teams with a lot of experience. It will be powered. But we do expect to regularly fight at the front in our class.""\n\nLulham is also participating in the Sprint Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe this year. Together with Thierry Vermeulen, who is starting his third full season in the Sprint Cup, he will drive a Ferrari 296 GT3 from Emil Frey Racing. ""We expect to get podium places,"" said Vermeulen. According to Verstappen\'s agent, the fact that Lulham and Vermeulen are driving two different cars this year is \'only good\'. ""The Ferrari is of course a very different car than the Aston Martin, but that only benefits the development of the driving skills,"" he says. ""They have now tested enough with both cars, so we don\'t expect any problems if they switch from one car to another.""', 'Lmao the headline made it seem like max proposed to verstappen.com racing', 'I did enjoy the Redbull sim to real life mini series. https://youtu.be/Kdcjo7Ypdtw\n\nAlso I believe iRacing holds a competition for sim racers to drive real life F4 cars and receive lessons.

1jv1c8l,What is the Japanese fandom of Yuki Tsunoda like?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jv1c8l/what_is_the_japanese_fandom_of_yuki_tsunoda_like/,2025-04-09, Discussion,"Formula 1 largely operates in English, so I mostly have only encountered English language fandom of Tsunoda.  

Seeing the teams create Japanese culture themed liveries, helmets, and promotional materials last week I realised I've seen virtually nothing of Tsunoda fandom from a Japanese perspective.  

I might be stereotyping here, but are there manga, anime, magazines, games, technology, food products, endorsements etc that we don't really see outside Japan?

I was a big fan of the Initial D series as it was being produced and there was a lot of hype around Keiichi Tsuchiya and the drift driving on hill climbs etc that seemed to produce a lot of fandom and commercial spin offs.  I'd imagine that there'd be something of that surrounding Yuki Tsunoda in Japan?

Please share anything in the comments!","[""In terms of mass media/sponsor stuff, every now and then there's some Red Bull promo here (like buy two cans, get a pin badge with Yuki's helmet/car on it), and I'll sometimes see someone wearing a VCARB cap, but that's about it in terms of seeing him in the wild here. I haven't seen him on any random endorsement ads or anything.  \nMaybe that'll change now he's in Red Bull, but I'd be surprised unless he sees some success there."", 'I am only speaking based on my experience in Japan over the last 3 weeks‚Ä¶\n\nBefore the Grand Prix, as I met and spoke with Japanese people in Tokyo they were largely unaware the Grand Prix was on, didn‚Äôt know Yuki but were like ‚Äúoh ya, car racing. That‚Äôs cool‚Äù. Couldn‚Äôt find merch or anything in Tokyo, but sugar free red bull has Yuki on it here.\n\nThen, when I went to the Grand Prix, I would say the overwhelming team support I saw was for Red Bull and Racing Bulls and almost even split between Max and Yuki. Some of the Yuki merch the fans were wearing was a few years old, so unlikely driven by the recent news. They were probably supporting throughout his career. Also, obviously, some really cool fan made outfits supporting Yuki. There was also a Yuki themed gachapon in one of the shops. But outside of that, just saw the type of merch you would see at any Grand Prix, I didn‚Äôt see anything uniquely different for Yuki. There was a nice photo ‚Äúalley‚Äù of his journey to F1 showing photos from when he first starting karting and then most of his Grand Prix starts.\n\nI spoke to some younger (than me) Japanese fans on the trains to and from (mostly early to mid twenties) and they were supporting Yuki this year and were fans of some of Hirakawa and Iwasa, but said they were larger fans of other drivers and before this year who would have supporting Ferrari or Aston Martin. \n\nI‚Äôm still in Japan for a couple more weeks, so if there are things I have missed, please let me know as I would LOVE to buy some Yuki merch whilst here, but compare to Melbourne, which I also attended, not close to same level of support Oscar had where he was voicing tram stops, the Grill‚Äôd dedicated burger/meal, murals, he was selling everything in all the OOH ads.', 'I was in Japan last year and Yuki did some kind of popup store, meet and greet thing. I wish I had gone because I guess it wasn‚Äôt hard to reach him, if that tells you anything.', ""I dont know about how big the fandom is but I do know that when he moved to red bull there was ZERO coverage from the biggest japanese news sites like asahi shimbun or nhk, so I dont think he's known by general public in japan\n\n\nEdit: also I looked up his japanese name on twitter the day or two after he went to red bull and it was staggeringly quiet, no one outside motorsport circle was talking about it at all\xa0"", 'When we were in Japan last year I was expecting a lot of Yuki ads. They were none. It is all about Ohtani', 'They talk about him, sure, but Japanese motorsport has been in a ""crisis"" for some time now due to dwindling interest and attendance numbers. People who know him are likely fans of Japanese motorsports too like Super GT or Super Formula and not really the casual person on the street.\n\nLast year Yuki had a karting exhibition event together with some Super Formula drivers like Toshiki Oyu. But domestic motorsports don\'t seem to use his image that much. Japanese F4, where he started his career, doesn\'t take much advantage either except for a few mentions here and there (that might change though as the 2025 season is about to start soon)', 'I can‚Äôt imagine any Japanese athlete having a fandom coming close to Shohei Ohtani. The man is a god in Japan and it‚Äôs frankly justified.', 'I‚Äòm currently in Japan for the First time. He‚Äôs on Red Bull cans if that helps', 'From what I‚Äôve seen to get news and media coverage for non domestic sports you need a world beater type of athlete (think Ohtani).

1jv6inq,2025 Bahrain GP - Build Up Thread,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jv6inq/2025_bahrain_gp_build_up_thread/,2025-04-09, Discussion,"Let's try something new! Let's use this thread to discuss the upcoming race in Bahrain.

**Circuit Information**

The Bahrain International Circuit joined the F1 Calendar in 2004 and was the first country in the Middle East to host a Formula 1 event. In recent years, the circuit has also hosted pre-season testing. The circuit is characterised by many hard braking zones and slow corners, as well as a notoriously abrasive track surface that usually leads to high degradation.

**What happened last year?**

The 2024 Bahrain GP was the season opener and it was a weekend dominated by Red Bull Racing. Many thought the season would be a carbon copy of 2023. Little did we know....

[2024 Pole Lap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7Mikgrm52k)

[2024 Race Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y5wMpKXNK4)

**Tyre Selection**

C1 - C2 - C3

This is the same tyre selection as Suzuka however do not expect the same one stopper with zero degradation. The abrasive track surface and long acceleration zones put a lot of stress onto the rear tyres, and the race is typically a two stopper at the very least.

**Weather forecast**

Unlike pre-season testing, which was abnormally cold, we can expect day time temperatures hovering close to 30 degrees celcius. The Bahrain GP is a night race, but with the race being hosted a month later than usual we can still expect track temperatures at lights out to be very high.

**What time is the race?**

It‚Äôs not as good as the McLaren but let‚Äôs not pretend like it‚Äôs a sauber lol', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> Max Verstappen doesn\'t have the best car, but he\'s right in the thick of the World Championship race. Thanks to his class and the right setup changes, he managed to turn things around in Japan. But that won\'t last forever.\n\n> McLaren should really be worried. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have the best car in the field, yet Max Verstappen is breathing down their necks after three races. Norris is one point behind, and Piastri is 13 points ahead. The McLaren drivers should seize the opportunity and build a lead now before Red Bull can turn things around with its car.\n\n> In this way, Max Verstappen won his fourth title in 2024. He used his superior car in the first five races to build a large lead in the World Championship. He then managed the cushion until the end. His advantage is that Red Bull focuses solely on him. His opponents always have to consider both drivers.\n\n> The World Championship will likely come down to a three-way battle between Verstappen and the two McLaren drivers. Mercedes and Ferrari will soon have to find the two to four tenths that separate them from the title contenders. McLaren has a consistent lead. Red Bull will only be able to do so if the engineers finally find the right setting.\n\n> **Off track on Friday.**\nIt was the same pattern at all three Grands Prix this year. On Friday, Red Bull was nowhere to be seen. Just in time for qualifying, the RB21 was competitive with Verstappen at the wheel. In Suzuka, it even made a jump from Saturday to Sunday, even though no further changes to the cars are allowed.\n\n> ""I think the low track temperatures and low tire wear played into our hands. This allowed us to keep the rear tire temperatures under control,"" Verstappen explained. Before qualifying, motor racing director Helmut Marko had set a third-row position as a realistic goal. In the end, it was pole position.\n\n> On Friday, the Red Bull performed so poorly that the driver felt as if something was twisting between the front and rear axles. His car went from understeer to oversteer and back again. Every corner delivered a new surprise. ""Suzuka is a track where you need confidence. And unfortunately, I didn\'t have that,"" the champion apologized.\n\n> **Marko curses Simulator.**\nSporting Director Helmut Marko cursed the simulator work, which had once again produced the wrong setup. ""Whenever the simulator promises us great lap times, things go backwards on the racetrack. That was the case two years ago in Monte Carlo and again this time. I told Max he should rely on his experience rather than what the simulator says.""\n\n> Team principal Christian Horner downplays this: ""The best sensor in the car is the driver. After three practice sessions, we finally managed to get the car into its window. And then, with Max, it was capable of taking pole position and winning."" But Verstappen demands more from Red Bull. He wants a car that no longer requires him to worry about whether the penny will drop in time.\n\n> To be capable of winning at Suzuka, Red Bull had to set up its cars differently in virtually every parameter than the simulation data suggested. One might therefore question the correlation between the tools and reality, but the truth is probably different.\n\n> **Only good in one configuration.**\nThis Red Bull RB21 is a car that only functions in one configuration. And that configuration is different on every track, every day. Therefore, drivers and engineers have no choice but to work towards the perfect setup step by step and hope they achieve it by qualifying.\n\n> The second driver falls behind in this process. He lacks the experience with the car and the class of the lead driver to quickly find his own solution. In the end, he must either follow Verstappen\'s path or insist on his own car setup. Both options cost lap time.\n\n> Technical director Pierre Wach√© admits that the new Red Bull has inherited the problems of the old one. ""The car\'s balance is constantly changing. It takes too long to fix it. And luckily, we have Max in the car to implement it. If we can do it permanently, the car\'s operating window will also expand again.""\n\n> **McLaren improvement in Bahrain?**\nThe Frenchman curses the ground-effect cars that lead many teams into a dead end: ""In the end, it\'s always the same problem: Drive as low and stiffly as possible, make sure the car\'s balance isn\'t lost, and you stay legal with the plank underneath the car."" The previous generation of cars was more frugal. Several solutions led to the goal.\n\n> McLaren is the only racing team that has consistently adjusted its parameters. Team principal Andrea Stella believes he has a trump card in his hand despite the close points standings. ""At the moment, the track layout and conditions still determine the result. That will settle. Then it\'s important to have the best car. You can\'t deliver a masterful performance like Max\'s in Suzuka for 24 races.""\n\n> Many experts expect the McLaren to have an advantage, especially in hotter temperatures. Then the papaya racer can also better exploit its tire advantage. However, it has been quite chilly on each of the three race days so far. That could change in the next two races in Bahrain and Jeddah. McLaren would be well advised to finally convert its pace advantage into points.', ""I'm not an engineer, but from what I can see, the Red Bull really seems to hate any body roll. The car is fast through sharper corners, but it loses out in longer corners with sustained turning. Max lost out marginally to Norris through sector 1 and through spoon despite the McLarens backing off slightly due to having a tricky car at the limit. He made up all the deficit and a little more through the last chicane which can be squared off easily. Also, looking at the last chicane of Max, it was clear the Red Bull's suspension was stiffer than the McLaren's, potentially to reduce body roll through corners, but this would also make kerb riding and traction zones more difficult to nail."", 'In the right hands yes', 'I think the car is very good but just has a narrow setup window\xa0', ""The Race have an article just now from RBR staff saying they think the fundamental outright pace gap to McLaren is very small, but McLaren's real strength is tyre presentation.\n\nWhich in fairness has been the story since testing."", 'Its definitely blown out of proportion. Or its blowing out of proportion because Lawson just happen to suck the first 2 races. Its not a worst car than Ferrari atm. Media just milking this over and over again. When Mercedes (or atleast George) was qualifying 4th consistently last year, they were not talking about it like they‚Äôre talking about the RB now.', '""but let‚Äôs not pretend like it‚Äôs a sauber lol"" \n\nfunny how absolutely nobody is doing that yet people cant keep themselves from making such comments. The lowest i have seen the red bull be rated is 5th and lets be honest based on china quali they werent too far off that.', ""so, a car can be either a Mclaren or a Sauber. Based on your logic then every car in between is a 'very good car in the right conditions'.

*  Bring back refueling. 
   * Shit ton of strategy comes back into play. Fuel heavy and go long with hards? Go light and fast on softs? Lap times could be 4-6 seconds different between the two - it would definitely let some more miracle wins happen IMO put more things up into chance (SC, caught out in the back, etc.)
   * Allows us to have smaller, lighter cars. Smaller fuel cell also allows for a smaller frame overall, so we can get more exciting racing. Won't help Monaco until we give them all spec-super-charged F4 cars.
   * A less than 0.5% chance of fire is small, and if there is a fire, people are in protective suits, are trained, and looks cool and would get world-wide attention. Win-win except for the people who get caught on fire, but they're probably going to be okay.
* Mandatory 2 pit-stops
   * No red flag shenanigans that has happened in the past where we get no pit action.
   * Could require all 3 compounds to be used, or, go like Indy, bring compounds down to 2, and force teams to use at least 1 new tire per compound in the race (effectively making it a mando 2 stop)
   * Gives the pit crew more NIL opportunities with their on-screen-time. The drivers have too much focus right now anyways.
* Points for every position
   * No one gives a shit about Stroll fighting a Sauber/Alpine for 19th, however, if its worth 1 championship point, people would care more. We'd get more chaos as people fight tooth and nail for every point possible.
   * Scale it up obviously, and yes that means we'd have people in the 1000s if they have a great season - that's okay. They are points, they have changed multiple times before - no one cares it doesn't matter that Senna only got X points.
* Weekend format change
   * Friday - FP1, Quali
   * Saturday - Sprint Race (reverse entire grid) at 65% distance of main race
   * Sunday - Main Race
      * Things that change in this format - 
      * This benefits us from a very predictable race if teams are given 3 hours of track time to figure things out. We get more racing instead of practice. Gives fans a better reason to attend the Friday instead of just free practice- some races do not have support races so literally all they have those 2 days is just free practice. 
      * We'll have the best drivers trying to knife throughout the field. They will move up the grid - the slower drivers/cars will fall back. While some might certainly win the sprint race from the front, most will not.
      * Gives more TV time so F1 can make more $ (the reason this would happen)
* Allow teams to enter a 3rd car for 1 race per season.
   * More for lulz but would allow reserve drivers to get some action, or some rookies. Should bring a little more chaos. I am guessing most do at their home GP, so Ferrari would run 3 at Monza, RB 3 at Suzuka (this year) but normally at RBR with VCarb. McL, AM, Merc & Williams all probably run 3 at Silverstone. Haas at USGP, Cadillac at Vegas probably. Alpine now Monaco? Audi Spa?
