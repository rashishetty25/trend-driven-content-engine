1mibr2x,Is Bortoleto the best rookie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mibr2x/is_bortoleto_the_best_rookie/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"In my opinion, what he’s been doing in a Sauber shows much more talent than all the other rookies this year. Since the start of the season, I already thought the best ones would be him—because he won the Formula 3 and Formula 2 titles in his rookie seasons—and Antonelli. However, Antonelli has been showing himself to be far inferior to his teammate. I believe it’s due to the pressure of starting in a big team like Mercedes, but to me, that makes Bortoleto the best rookie. That said, welcome back, Ayrton Senna.","['I think we’ll be watching Bortoleto in F1 for many years to come.\n\nHadjar has also been extremely impressive!', 'He could be. Hadjar started off strong.

1miae1n,Bunch of facts about both Championships while coming into Summer break,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1miae1n/bunch_of_facts_about_both_championships_while/,2025-08-05, Statistics,"There is 274 points left in 2025 World Drivers' Championship (10 Grand Prix's and 3 Spirnts)

This means that Oliver Bearman, Franco Colapinto and Jack Doohan are officialy out of contention for this title.

Yuki Tsunoda is last driver eligible for the Championship as he currently has 10 points, while Oscar Piastri has 284, Tsunoda would win because he would have 10 wins compared to Piastri's 6 so far.

Oscar Piastri will not Max Verstappen's 2023 record of 575 points scored by a single driver as he can only get to 558 points if he would be flawless after the break.

Now some facts about World Constructor's Championship.

475 is the most points a team can get from last 10 Race Weekends.

This means that bottom 6 cannot win this year as Williams could only get to 545 points, which is 14 less than McLaren's current tally.

McLaren can miss out on only 34 points until the season ends if they want to be first team to get 1000 points, if they win it all they will earn 1034 in a single season.

This means they can only lose 3 races and all 3 sprints as they would lose 33 points that way.

The earliest possible race in which McLaren can win Constructor Championship is...

Azerbeijan

If McLaren has 3 more 1-2s and Ferrari would finish 3-4 that would put McLaren at 688 points and Ferrari at 341 (347 points gap). In remaining 7 Race Weeks there would be 346 ! points left so Ferrari could finish just 1 point behind McLaren.

1mier4k,"If the rumors about plank wear are true, why is Ferrari setup this weekend be treated as ""disaster""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mier4k/if_the_rumors_about_plank_wear_are_true_why_is/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"First of all, I think everyone agrees that lower rider height gives you more car performance, therefore Ferrari is faster than they should be in qualifying.

In Q3, P1 - P6 only separated by 0.126s, assuming the ""lower rider height"" gains them 2 tenths, Leclerc on paper should only qualified P6 behind both Aston Martin, which means he will be stucked behind Alonso. If it's 3-4 tenths difference, Leclerc will qualify P8 which makes it worse. (Even if it's only 1 tenth gain, he qualifies P4, which he will eventually finish P4, exactly the same.)

From what we saw how the race goes, it's impossible to overtake Alonso if you are not McLaren, especially if Leclerc doesn't have that ""2-tenth"" advantage by lowering ride height. Given Ferrari's race strategy, they will probably choose a 2-stop behind the DRS train like Max did and get somewhere below P8 or even out of the points.

But with this ""plank gambling"", they got P4 eventually, has a shot to go for podium or even win (if there are some SC or VSC to keep the plank healthy so that they don't need more tyre pressure in the final stint).

""Hungaroring is just Monaco without walls."" Yes, the gambling didn't pay off this time because there is no SC / VSC, but they lost nothing (in terms of race result) and has everything to gain potentially by doing so. That's how teams play the rule if they don't have the best car.

Lewis Hamilton is on the opposite side preferring a stable rear, but how does it actually look like?

From the moment Lewis Hamilton started karting, his father would stand next to the track and move further where his rivals would typically brake forcing Lewis to [mold his style of late braking](https://youtu.be/MOtvpi1aM-I).

Lewis tries to brake as late as possible often braking and turning at the same time and is also aggressive at corner entry. This usually results in the rear sliding mid corner and Lewis has to open up his steering to correct.
You can see this style clearly on his older onboard with the McLaren at [Turn 2](https://youtu.be/FJQ4QyJNuA8?t=22), and [Turn 13](https://youtu.be/FJQ4QyJNuA8?t=72).

The Mercedes Lewis dominated with had insane rear grip where he could throw the around car and it looks like it is glued on the track [1](https://youtu.be/rh6vBU-YNK0?t=19), [2](https://youtu.be/rh6vBU-YNK0?t=63), [3](https://youtu.be/SP3882i0H-0?t=28), [4](https://youtu.be/SP3882i0H-0?t=74).

Verstappen on the other hand prefers a very strong front end. Verstappen is not a late braker like Hamilton and he is conservative on corner entry. He prefers to do most of the car rotation mid corner [1](https://youtu.be/uvlHBDD2R2M?t=19), [2](https://youtu.be/uvlHBDD2R2M?t=64). 

More detailed explanation:[1](https://youtu.be/mS_IM7p4l18?t=42), [2](https://youtu.be/v0_da8T5wxc)","['Max’s steering input look much smoother than lewis’s. Can anyone explain why? Or am i wrong in assuming this?', ""By the way, 'often braking and turning at the same time' is something that basically every race car driver in the world does.

I've seen him popping up on social feeds and I'm not sure I agree with a lot of what he says. He's often talking about idealised lines and being off them as a negative, despite as far as I can tell he's never actually driven anything close to an F1 car?

1mi9y6c,A look back at MasterCard Lola. The F1 team that participated in only one qualifying session and then retired from Formula 1.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mi9y6c/a_look_back_at_mastercard_lola_the_f1_team_that/,2025-08-05, Throwback,"MasterCard Lola was a British team that entered Formula 1 in 1997 with the car T97/30. Their drivers were Vincenzo Sospiri and Ricardo Rosset. In the first race of the 1997 season, the Australian Grand Prix, the cars were too slow to qualify for the race. According to the regulations in force at the time, if a car did a lap time in qualifying that was 107% slower than the time of the pole position holder, it would not enter the race. And since the cars of MasterCard Lola were 11 and 13 seconds slower, they failed to qualify in the race. Later, they tried to fix the problems of their car with some testing at Silverstone. Their attempt didn't help them become as fast as they wanted and even though they went to Interlagos for the Brazilian Grand Prix, they retired due to financial and technical issues, as they stated. Not so much later, MasterCard Lola completely withdrew from Formula 1, saddled with £6 million in debt.","['IIRC, the original plan was to enter in 1998 for the new regs but they got pushed (I want to say by Mastercard but might be wrong) to enter a year earlier, giving them something stupid like 100 days to build an F1 team from scratch. \n\nThe car was based off an Indy chassis and a complete dog that hadn’t even been inside a wind tunnel.

There was a lot of development done with the FG01 through the 1995 season, and by the end of the year they were faster than the Pacifics (!), but Roberto Moreno's qualifying time for the last race is 1995 was still a full second slower than the slowest driver in something approaching an actual F1 car managed, and that driver was Taki Inoue.\n\nSo basically Lola, in 1997, fielded a car that was slower than a reworked and developed version of a mediocre F1 car from 1992..."", ""Car looks like it's throwing up middle fingers in pic #3"", 'Looks sharp 👍🏻', ""Mastercard did push them to enter a year earlier, despite protest from the team saying they weren't ready.\n\nThe sponsorship agreement was also terrible as Mastercard paid the team only if people signed up to a special VIP club through a promotion that involved the team.\n\nUnfortunately, it was kinda doomed from the start.\n\n- Shitbox car that failed to qualify because it was rushed at the request of Mastercard.\n\n- Whether related to the performance of the car or not, no one was signing up to their VIP club, this meant Mastercard failed to pay Lola.\n\n- Lola were never a big manufacturer throughout their history, while they made successful sports cars, there were always tight on money.

It was actually Lando Norris who pulled me into the sport. His social media presence, humor, and down-to-earth vibe really stood out to me and made F1 feel more accessible. From watching clips of him joking around with other drivers to getting a glimpse into his personality off the track, I got curious about the actual races, and now I’m completely hooked. I’ve been diving deep into past seasons, race highlights, team rivalries, and everything in between.

That said, I’ve always had a soft spot for Ferrari too. Growing up in the U.S., my exposure to F1 was limited, but I still knew about Michael Schumacher. He was a legend, and as someone with German heritage, I always admired him. Most of my motorsports background comes from watching NASCAR as a kid, since that was way more mainstream here in the States, but Schumacher and Ferrari still managed to break through that and grab my attention.

So now I find myself rooting for Lando first, but also hoping Ferrari can get back to being dominant. If Lando ever switches teams, I’d follow him without question. But there’s still that nostalgic pull toward Ferrari that keeps them as a secondary favorite for me.

1mizfhc,Which team has the best driver pairing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mizfhc/which_team_has_the_best_driver_pairing/,2025-08-06, Discussion,"I've asked this question a couple of times in the past and it has always sparked some interesting discussions, so I thought the summer break would provide a good opportunity for another one: 

In the first half of the season, which team in your opinion had the best driver pairing? How you interpret ""best"" is completely up to you of course, consistency, potential (maybe if even unfulfilled), you name it. It just has to be for both drivers. No Max bailing the team out (spoilers).

I've only done this for the best four teams so far, but given that the field is so incredibly close, it's probably fair to include all teams. I'll go first (duh):

**1. McLaren** This is the only one where I'll outright disagree with you if you have a different opinion. I said it wasn't close when I asked this question after race 5 or so and a bunch of you disagreed and went for Ferrari instead, and fair enough, but I genuinely think at this point McLaren has had the best driver pairing by a mile. There's barely anything between them, they deliver what can be expected from this rocketship of a car, and while as a Piastri fan I'd love for him to win this, it'd be incredibly exciting to see their form continue after the summer break and ideally we get a titanic battle up to the last race.

**2. Ferrari** This is already where it gets tricky to judge. The car has gone up and down from race to race (you can basically copy paste this for every team bar McLaren). Chuck has been excellent, but Hamilton has struggled more than I think many people expected. His qualifying especially has been pretty rough lately, but his racecraft on Sunday has saved him a couple of times. We're not quite yet at Checo levels of ""bad saturday, good sunday"" yet, but he's probably happy about the summer break for a reset.

**3. Mercedes** Effectively the same as with Ferrari, but below them because I think Kimis lows have been lower than Hamiltons. He has shown that he has the speed and talent, but it's a tough place in the spotlight for a rookie, especially against such amazing drivers in the other top teams. He's a rookie after all, he'll learn, but now he needs to show that he has the resilience to bounce back. George has been amazing in a so-so car, just slightly below Chuck for me.

Positions 4 to 8 can really be put in any order and I'd agree. Not only the cars are incredibly close, so are the pairings in my opinion.

**4. Sauber** Probably a controversial one and very likely influenced by recency bias, but these two have genuinely impressed me. The car was arguably the worst one at the start of the season and the results show, but Nico was generally solid to good, has managed to pick up the occasional points and as soon as the car improved he was there (and even, finally, got the damn podium). But even more impressive in my opinion and why they are so high up: Bortoleto is making a very strong case for being the best rookie of the season. Was given a rough hand with the Sauber car in the beginning, but he kept his head down, improved steadily, gained his first points and is even ahead of Nico in qualifying. If he keeps this up, boy can we expect great things of him in the future. With the momentum he's gained lately, he probably wishes to skip the summer break entirely.

**5. Williams** These would probably be among the top 3 with 2 Albons, but unfortunately Sainz has been struggling quite a bit to adapt. I remember people saying he'd wipe the floor with Albon, but it's safe to say this hasn't happened. He has the occasional drive where he shows just how good he is, but in a field this close any small mistake gets punished harshly. Obligatory ""the car is up and down"".

**6. Aston Martin** Car up and down yada yada. Alonso is Alonso and has been on point whenever the car and luck allowed him to be, and Stroll has been quietly having a really solid season with some very strong drives.

**7. Racing Bulls** Very hard to judge with two rookies, and one of them even got his spirit broken very early in the season. These would likely be a lot higher had Yuki stayed there. Hadjar has been excellent and is here to stay I think, and Lawson has shown lately how fast he can be in the right environment. If the trend continues, these two have the potential to become a really scary midfield pairing imo.

**8. Haas** Essentially the same text as Sauber, just a bit lower in general. Ocon I think is on the same level as Hulk, but Ollie hasn't had the headturning moments that we've seen from Bortoleto (I'm just realising that I'm using the wildest mix of first and last names).

**9. Red Bull** Likely another controversial take to put them this low, but they effectively haven't been a **pairing** for the biggest part of the season. They've been an amazing Max and somewhere in the distance the second car. I'd put them even lower if the second car wasn't such a toxic spot that will almost by design crush any driver that isn't the highest quality. Also, Yuki has shown signs of improvement, even if it didn't result in any points. Red Bull can consider themselves so damn lucky that Max stays with them at least for 26.

**10. Alpine** Someone has to be last, and for me it's the team that manages to outmess even Red Bull (not that this is their driver's fault, I just wanted to mention how much of a mess this team is). Pierre has been as good as we know we can expect from him and puts a genuinely horrible car higher than it deserves, but they are the only team that hasn't scored any points with their second car. Doohan was being given a shit hand from the get go, and Colapinto hasn't lived up to the hype.

  
This was my take, what's your's? : )

  
","[""Genuine question: Why is Mercedes so high but Red Bull so low? Merc is also pretty one sided when it comes to Quali gap, H2H and Race H2H between teammates. Not hating on Kimi or Yuki at all, I know and fully understand that there are context factors for both.
