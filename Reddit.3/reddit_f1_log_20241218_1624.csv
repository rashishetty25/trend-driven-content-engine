If everyone is busy, the boss sweeps the floor and gets coffee for workers. Not the other way around.', ""How to be a decent manager:\n\nStep 1 don't be Christen Horner\nStep 2 look at step one again."", ""Some say it's the pressure of carrying an entire nation's hopes and dreams on your shoulders, where everything wrong gets scrutinised and criticised by the every Italian, from the press to even the man on the street.

It was only thanks to Todt and Brawn shielding him that nothing drastic happened."", ""It wasn't necessarily the fact that it was lead by non-Italians, but that there was an agreement between Todt and Montezemolo, that thd hirarchy of Ferrari and McLaren wouldn't meddle with the team, thereby shielding them from the politics being played at both companies. The moment Montezemolo broke that agreement, the team went downhill. You could see the same negative dynamics play out at Alpine or at McLaren during the power struggle between Dennis, Whitmarsh and Ojjeh."", '>The case of Prost, a driver that has multiple championships, being fired because he called the car tractor or whatever will forever form my opinion of the team.\xa0\n\n\nTo add to that, his quote about the car handling like a truck was massively taken out of context after a post-race interview and Ferrari never sought any clarification. He\'s explained why in interviews and more recently in his documentary that aired earlier this month.\xa0\n\n\nAll he meant was how his car, in one particular race (Japan 1991), was almost impossible to drive because he had damage. At turn 1 he made contact with another car and his steering buckled as a result, making the car feel heavy and very hard to turn, hence the truck comparison. Now the whole year the Ferrari already had an issue where the steering would lock in long turns and the car almost couldn\'t turn, so the steering damage in Japan must\'ve amplified the issue and felt like hell. Prost called that race one of the best he\'s ever had despite finishing P4 and 25 seconds off the podium. For the record Brundle finished P5 and got lapped, the other Ferrari\'s engine blew up on the opening lap. At the time he was also in the middle of contract negotiations for the upcoming season and Ferrari felt his comments were even more disrespectful given the situation.\xa0\n\n\nYou\'re right that Ferrari has always had an issue with accepting criticism, especially from their own drivers. Another anecdote mentioned in the Prost documentary, in 1990 (which he called of his favorite seasons in F1 in terms of team atmosphere) he brought up to Ferrari how the engine was not good enough to compete with McLaren\'s engine and the team wouldn\'t accept such criticism. He said ""at Ferrari, the engine is sacred. You don\'t touch the engine, you don\'t talk about the engine. Everything has to be about the rest of the car. Except the chassis was very good that year.""

I figure it is the kind of info which is probably casually dropped in the middle of a YouTube video, but I wouldn't know how to search for it by itself.

For context, the reason I want to know is that the Ambulance Trust I work for loves to describe our approach to resuscitation as a ""Pit Stop"" approach, where everyone has a single role and they all come together to work as a team, but I would quite like to be able to point out the next time just how often Pit Crews get to practice working as a team, compared to the one afternoon every 18 months that my trust thinks is sufficient dedicated training time.","['At the factory the teams tend to short sessions with around a dozen stops twice a day. |  \nAt the track they will do a 30 min session every day each 30 min session would be around 50 stops.\n\nRed Bull article about this: [https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops)', ""During peak race season I'd venture to say they're practicing daily - for hours a day."", 'Idk but Talking Bulls podcast had an episode with members of their pit crew, can probably find out there', ""On race weekends, they usually practice on Thursdays and Fridays.

Off-season (December - Feb/March). The crew are working almost exclusively from the factory, and the top teams will be training their pit crews for maybe 1 hour per day. Not all of that is pitstop practice, so some days may see dozens of pit stops while others might involve some strength training at the gym. For the smaller teams it will be more workload dependent, and also dependent on their facilities (not all teams have a Red Bull-style dedicated pit stop practice room). There may be weeks where the crew needs to spend time on other things and only have time to practice for 30 minutes on 1 or 2 days in a week.\n\n\n2. In-season at the Track (Wednesday-Sunday). Similar between the teams. Each team will spend 15-30 mins per day practicing pit stops. Due to travel and the time it takes to set up the paddock, there is usually no practice on a Monday or Tuesday of the race week.\n\n\n3. In-season Off Weeks. Depending on travel schedules, fatigue and rest days, the crew might not spend much time practicing back at the factory between races (the number of days in the factory will be team-dependent). At the top teams the training might be similar to off-season when the crew are back in the factory, since they have more support that lets them take time away from their normal duties. On the other hand, some top teams will offer their crew more rest days between events as a perk, so the practice volume might be very small. For the smaller teams, who don't have as many staff and so rely more on the trackside staff to fill in when they're back, it will be heavily dependent on their workload. A busy week might mean they don't train at all."", ""They definitely don't practice daily during the season as they may not have time with all the time spent traveling and performing other tasks. Regarding the off-season, Vasseur mentioned two ago that the crew had done about 1800 practice stops over the winter.

Super fast delivery but unfortunately the actual part came floating inside the frame. 

Looks like a double side tape was used to keep it in place which didn‚Äôt work as expected. 

See image below. ( the white patch in image is some tape at the place where the piece should have been)

What should be my course of action? Is this considered defective, can the frame be opened to place it in place or sadly I should file a return.


Was really looking forward to having a piece of Lewis/mercedes f1 history.

Note: it‚Äôs not in new acrylic box. It‚Äôs inside old style frame that seems to sealed from all side.

But how much of an advantage is it to have lightweight drivers on the grid nowadays, that cars are much heavier than in the past.

This year the extremes were Tsunoda (54 kg) and Hulkenberg (75 kg). 21 kg is about 10 laps of fuel or 2,5% of the car's weight. How many seconds per lap could that amount to?","[""it isn't anymore. light drivers have ballast to make it's equal. the minimum weight is 80kg\n\nalso this is a question for https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hg53d8/ask_rformula1_anything_daily_discussion_thread/"", 'the lighter drivers have added ballast to reach the 80kg minimum weight', 'Ballast to make weight up to 80kg must be placed under the drivers seat/cockpit so cannot be used to improve car balance.', ""Interestingly, in the 80s and early 90s, only the car had to be a certain minimum weight. The driver was excluded. This theoretically meant the lighter drivers had the advantage. \n\nIf I remember correctly Eddie Cheever was one of the heaviest drivers.. Yet he was also one of the quickest. In 1982, he went up against one of the lightest drivers on the grid, Laffite, and thoroughly outperformed him. He then went on to do reasonably well against the legendary (and another light weight) Alain Prost in 1983.\n\nIn 1995, the driver weight was included as well with the car for the first time, and their sum had to be a certain minimum weight. \n\nAnd .. Absolutely nothing changed with regards to the pecking order of drivers. Nothing significant, anyway.\n\nI don't deny weight is important, but driver talent matters more than how much you weigh."", 'None as ballast is added to compensate for the difference between lighter drivers and those that are heavier.\n\nThe cars all have the same minimum weight requirement with the ballast added.', ""It's no longer a big disadvantage but it used to be before they added the minimum driver weight rule. I guess one advantage a small driver has is they can have move the ballast on the car for better car balance, whereas for the taller/heavier drivers they can't really do that.\n\nI believe 10kg is around 3 tenths in performance per lap, so before that rule and if your car was overweight being light was a decent adavantage. It was particularly bad problem in 2014 for example as all the cars were overweight, a lot of the tall drivers had go on strict diets to get closer to their teammates. Vergne for example was hospitalised because he passed out after a race due to dehydrating and starving himself. Hulk as well was allegedly passed over by both Mclaren and Ferrari because he was seen to be too heavy for them.\n\n So it used to be a big deal, but now it's not really anything that matters."", 'Is there any driver that is over 80kg?', ""Well, if we're talking about very small differences, a lighter driver with ballast under the seat is slightly better for the center of gravity height than having a heavier driver, even if the overall weight is the same. \n\nAlso, a shorter driver results in a lower polar moment of inertia, so the car could be very slightly more agile"", 'Unlikely. \n\nUnless youre as tall as ocon, albon or russell, you have to be fairly burly to be 80kg, and while fit, they definitely arent conventionally muscular.\n\nFor the majority of the grid, 80kg would make them close to or overweight by BMI (yes, BMI is not a good indicator without context)', 'Fairly sure Justin Wilson was over 80kg when he was in F1 in 2003. \n\nUgo Ugochukwu in F3 is a big guy, about 6‚Äô3‚Äù at just 17 with more room to grow.

1hge2iy,How important is it to have an F1 race in Africa and is it worth it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hge2iy/how_important_is_it_to_have_an_f1_race_in_africa/,2024-12-17, Discussion,"People for long have complained that a world championship doesn‚Äôt visit the second largest continent on the world. However, I don‚Äôt see how simply adding one race to this continent helps almost anything except for checking Africa off the list. I don‚Äôt think I need to say how vastly different every region of Africa is and when you look at the most likely candidates in my opinion this divide is clearly shown.

Obviously South Africa has always been the frontrunner since Kyalami used to host F1 but not only does the country seem unstable at times (I haven‚Äôt kept up but I remember protests at one point) but South Africa is very different to most countries. Then you have Rwanda who seem to be leading the race now and seem to be the most economically stable country in Africa and most realistic host. Watching football I‚Äôve seen their advertising all over Arsenal and it seems they‚Äôre going a step further now but once again Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia. And the final option which is by far the least realistic but it‚Äôs just the reality of having a race in this continent would be an Egyptian GP but as you can imagine the divide is biggest at the North of Africa and it would be seen as another desert race. I only include it because it‚Äôs the most well known African country and has a history vastly greater than any desert race we currently have. Beyond these 3 options I can‚Äôt think of anything else, maybe a Moroccan GP since they seem to be hosting the WC with Spain and Portugal and at the most extreme push Senegal for being the closest possible option West Africa has.

 I think a lot of people have this idea that we can just start having races anywhere in Africa to represent the continent but it is beyond unrealistic to start hosting races in West Africa, East Africa and most of North Africa so why force one race to tick the continent off when it‚Äôs not really proper representation. I feel like only die hard Kyalami fans would be pushing for it otherwise there is little interest. Personally, I‚Äôd rather countries focus their efforts towards their people rather than paying ridiculous money to host an F1 event which is why I kept the options as realistic as possible. So for me it‚Äôs not worth forcing an F1 race here where one race can‚Äôt possibly please even a fifth of the continent (it‚Äôs not as simple as hosting Melbourne for Australia) and the options that exist mostly don‚Äôt exist apart from Kyalami yet the most realistic option still will be a soulless Rwandan GP. ","[""Personally I think that races should be awarded based on how much the host country/city can actually viably support the race and how many actual fans from the locality will get to see the race in person, as well as the general appeal of the race to the existing F1 fan base.\n\nMaybe hosting a race in Africa could bring in a large fan base, but if the race isn't likely to be run for more than a couple years and they stop because of the expense, then it's probably not a great idea to host a race there.\n\nAlso, with 24 races,  we are approaching the point at which we don't really have time for more races. So the question becomes which race gets cancelled to make room for a race in Africa?"", 'About as important as having a race anywhere else.

They should just add a race and see how popular it is. Popularity will determine if they add more races to the area.\n\nI would remind you that there is only one race in South America, and five in North America. (Two races in South America if we're going by Marko's reckoning.)\n\n>Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia.\n\nOmg who cares about 'representing all of Asia/Africa'?
