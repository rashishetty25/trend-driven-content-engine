1ij26ge,Did 1990 (or the era approx) mark the end of Formula One as it was known at the time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ij26ge/did_1990_or_the_era_approx_mark_the_end_of/,2025-02-06, Discussion,"A few months back I finished watching the seasons from 1992 through 2003, essentially completing the Schumacher era through to when I actually started watching F1 in 2004. I had some thoughts on that here, some of which I have wavered on through further analysis since: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/WgE30i5xEI

I have also watched back the 1990 and 1991 since making that thread, and I have to say I was very surprised by how different the sport felt in those years compared to those immediately after. 

It could be argued that the time around 1990 represents something of a high watermark for F1. The field as a whole was far less competitive than it is now, with the gaps from the front to the midfield and the front to the back being far bigger than they are today. However, the races were generally far less predictable in spite of that. Who saw Leyton House coming at the French GP? Who knew there would be a Benetton one-two and Aguri Suzuki podium in Japan? Who knew Jean Alesi would have Tyrrell in contention at certain races?

I would contend that the time around 1990 saw the sport begin to transform into what it is today. The cars first took on the same basic shape of today and innovations like the semi-automatic gearbox, driver aids and active suspension had in some cases been seen before, but really took over the sport in the years including and immediately after 89. This made the sport feel technology-driven and computerised in a way that much more closely resembles today than anything that had come before it. This can also be said of race strategies; 1990 feels like the last year where the majority of races saw certain teams steadfastly committed to not making a tyre stop even if it was obvious they should, with Benetton not making stops because they were best equipped to go without them and Williams seemingly much more scared than other teams of the potential pitfalls. By the end of 1991, race strategies began to become more uniform and much more similar to today than they had been even immediately before.

Also in 1990 we had a very strong talent pool with four great champions (I am starting to wonder if maybe Piquet and Mansell were overrated, but I‚Äôd never have questioned their greatness without a deeper dive) and several other accomplished drivers who had mostly come into the sport through streamlined processes that were propped up by big backers of the sport like Marlboro and Elf. Afterwards, several drivers - Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve, Eddie Irvine and even the likes of Kimi Raikkonen and Juan Pablo Montoya later on - took some highly unconventional routes into F1. I would argue this partially explains why the bulk of the 1990s saw a very weak pool of talent - there was a huge gulf between Schumacher and pretty much everyone else, whereas the 1980s saw several drivers being able to bridge the gap between the GOAT candidates and the occasional race winners. 

The years after 1990 also saw the death of many small garagista teams that had previously been thriving hand-in-hand with the Hondas, Renaults and Ferraris of the world, for whom I would argue the sport has transformed into more and more of a financial black hole since; it is safe to say that ‚Äòwin on Sunday, sell on Monday‚Äô really isn‚Äôt a thing anymore other than for premium brand manufacturers and even that may be stretching things.

The garagista teams - along with past giants like Lotus and Brabham - were on their knees soon after 1990 and with that we saw an influx of pay drivers like Jean-Denis Deletraz, a shortlived response to the raised barrier to entry and the further raised barrier to success.

Add in the changes to circuits - with 1990 marking a farewell to the original fast Silverstone as well as the short Paul Ricard, and future years seeing the sport react to the events of Imola 1994 - and I would argue that by approximately 1996, the sport much more closely resembled the sport of today than the one of 1986. 

Obviously, there is a degree of hyperbole here as the sport saw significant changes after 1996 - for example, the Tilkefication of circuits largely took place in the early 2000s as a response to Greg Moore‚Äôs fatal crash in the 1999 Fontana CART race, and lap records at traditional circuits continued to tumble until approximately 2004. From that point I would argue the sport has only ever been able to be a version of the pinnacle of motorsport due to rising costs, the need to reign in excellence for the good of entertainment, the demand for environmental sustainability and the standardisation and homologation of specs and parts. 

It is also possible my opinions here are subliminally influenced by technological advancements throughout the world at the time, with race broadcasts arguably being the main beneficiary of this. The graphics introduced in 1994 made events so much easier to follow than anything from before and this is probably the context in which it is most true that F1 circa 1996 resembled today more closely than it did the decade prior.

It may also be worth noting the years after 1990 did not see the sport‚Äôs biggest sea change - that honour would probably go to the years immediately following 1967 due to sponsors, wings and the sea of political changes particularly regarding driver power increasing at the expense of circuit promoters.

All-in-all though, I can massively empathise (albeit not quite agree) with the rose-tinted perspective from which fans and observers view the era approx 1990. A lot of changes and the loss of a wild-west nature of sorts really feels like it can be traced back to that year or era. Am I onto something here? Am I making a degree of sense but being a little too hyperbolic? Or am I being completely crazy?","['For me, the Williams with the active suspension and the transition to high nose cars was the changeover.\xa0\n\n\nBefore that they were flat bottomed slot cars with absurd horsepower wrestling the cars around the track.\xa0', 'At the time, no one noticed a turning point change. That‚Äôs only visible through time. You have the full history to analyze. Back then no one knew what the future would bring, thus changes were gradual. Basically, the boiled frog effect.', 'I can\'t comment on how it was as a fan at the time as I wasn\'t alive, but going back and watching the old seasons there\'s a definite vibe shift around that period. However, I think it was more of a gradual change happening over nearly a decade than a single year thing.\n\nI think it started around 1986 with the retirement of more old school drivers like Lauda and Rosberg. \n\nThen in 1987 you had Bernie Ecclestone getting full commercial control over the sport by setting up what\'s now known as FOM, and finally burying the hatchet with FISA / the FIA which was a pretty huge deal. You also had the start of turbos being phased out with the introduction of the boost restrictor valves, which eventually led into their total ban in \'89. Again, that was a pretty seismic change.\n\nI\'d say the process of transitioning over to what I\'d consider ""modern"" F1 finished in around 1994. You get the new graphics package like you mentioned which completely changed how you follow races, and also had the passing of a driver who was truly a talisman of his era in Senna.', 'The shift to aero and away from mechanical grip accelerated in the 90s and I think with it the randomness you speak of disappeared. That coupled with cost control has led to greater standardisation and therefore much lower failure rates in components.\n\nAll that combined has resulted in aero concepts that are nearly Boolean across a season, but the random failure rates of old are gone. \n\nAlso I think the journey to F1 now is on rails, and as such the gap between the top and the bottom is closer meaning most cars are having the maximum extracted of them evenly, whereas in the early 90s the delta between top and bottom drivers was much greater and led to things like Alesi in the Tyrrell.', 'Basically, the world of F1 changed almost overnight on May 1st, 1994. I guess if you would have been around back then, you would have known but that black weekend changed everything.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994\\_San\\_Marino\\_Grand\\_Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_San_Marino_Grand_Prix)\n\nEdit: Added Wikipedia link', ""Thinking esp. about backmarkers, they got barely any coverage in the early 90s. Maybe partly because there were so many of them, but overall people couldn't care less how a Dallara or a Larrousse finished. That definitely changed in the late 90s, when only 22 cars were on the grid and all the low-effort teams had disappeared. The level of quality (or professionality) across the grid has vastly improved and the gaps between front and back got a lot closer."", 'I think there were a few things going on that didn\'t all happen for the same time or the same reasons.\n\nThe Concorde Agreement had regularized F1 and thrown out privateers in 1981 (basically the start of the shift to ""modern F1"". The garagistes had been in trouble for a while in 1990. They had been actually competitive in the DFV era, but with budgets rising and expensive works turbo engines required in the 80s it became much harder.   \n  \nThe FIA started encouraging teams to join with cheaper 3.5 liter DFV-derived engines in 1987. At the time F3000 had 3.0L engines and free chassis competition, so the leap for F3000 teams to join F1 was not very big. The low-budget teams rushed in from 1987 and peaked in 1989 with almost 40 cars at some races. They mostly folded in a few years as anyone who couldn\'t get big sponsors, works engine deals, and high-tech driver aids couldn\'t compete. The field shrank down to only 20 cars by the end of 1996. Despite plenty of lucky podiums for smaller teams, the front of the pack separated itself during the turbo era and couldn\'t be caught. Over twelve seasons 1984-1995 only four teams won 94% of races, and every driver/constructor champion from 1983-2008 had a works engine!  \n  \nIt wasn\'t really until the 2000s that the car manufacturers muscled in. That change was very rapid--in 1999, Ferrari was the only one, but by 2006 the top six teams were five carmakers and McLaren, which was 40% owned by Mercedes. Along with the expansion of the calendar and new Tilkedromes built all over Asia and the Middle East, that\'s what marks the transition into our current F1 era.', 'As others have said, the change is gradual and only obvious in hindsight, but I agree that the 90‚Äôs is when F1 became significantly more professionally run at all levels. \n\nRegarding Williams and a fear of old tires: you probably know this already, but watch Adelaide 1986 to inform of the reason‚Ä¶', 'I feel like the change happened around 2003. It was around then that ‚Äòthe show‚Äô became the biggest concern and regs were changed more and more almost every year in order to improve the on-track action . \n\n2003 was when the points system changed to stop Schumacher winning it too soon and they started messing around with the qualifying session because a one hour open session was too boring for TV.\n\n2005 they messed about with banning tyre changes.\n\n2008 control ECU to ban traction control.\n\n2009 aero changes and kers to improve racing\n\nand so on']",56,38,0.77,56,35,35,5,3,0.010000000000000009,5

And maybe 1999 but only because he missed too many races.\n\nI don't see anyone on his level in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004."", 'Which driver retirements (if any) do we expect to see after this season?

Considering that the brakes also weigh much less than a regular brake.', '15 straight seasons is an exaggeration, yes, but you‚Äôve already touched on the reasons why\n\n1992 was a seriously impressive year in isolation for Schumacher. There were times where he really took the fight to an dominant car/driver combination in Mansell and Williams, along with the best driver of the era in Senna. He shone in all conditions, made few errors aside from a calamitous French GP and dominated Brundle in qualifying. However, if you compare him to Brundle in races, you realise Schumacher‚Äôs year was maybe not quite that good. There were a good few races in which Brundle was close to him - even slightly ahead on one or two occasions. Hakkinen‚Äôs 1994 is much more impressive than Schumacher‚Äôs 1992 relative to Brundle - there was only one race where Mika looked like being beaten by Brundle, and that was in Adelaide where he suffered brake failure, only being behind in the first place because he got himself a penalty for speeding in the pits. In no other race was Brundle even close to Mika on pure pace. There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs a reliable indicator of Hakkinen relative to Schumacher, so we can safely conclude Michael wasn‚Äôt yet in his prime in 1992.\n\n1993 was a year of consolidation for Schumacher. He was the clear #2 behind Senna for me that year. He had three-race ending incidents at Kyalami, Donington and Suzuka, but also some fantastic performances like Spa where (IIRC) he was the only driver all year to overtake a Williams in a dry-weather straight fight, and of course Estoril where he won and Monaco where he should have won. Some people will say Schumacher must have been incredible that year because he absolutely walloped Patrese, and while I think Schumacher was definitely fundamentally faster in 1993 than 1992, you have to take in consideration that Patrese was fundamentally worse in active cars, and also note that in 93 itself he was a complete incident magnet. Senna was the clear #1 because even though his year as a whole was not perfect, when he had any chance to prove a point he simply completely clowned virtually the entire field.\n\n2003 was a down year for Michael but I have a hard time suggesting who was better. I find it impossible to believe Kimi was ever fundamentally as quick as Michael like many believe, and Alonso was impressive but I think he still had a little way to go to reach the level of 2005 and onwards.\n\n2005 Michael was not immune to the woes of Ferrari that year, and in 2006 Alonso was just a little bit better - the difference is Fernando was virtually flawless, with his lowest points being two below-par races at Indy and Hockenheim. Michael‚Äôs low points were much lower, crashing in Australia, taking himself out in Hungary, and Monaco you can call what you will.\n\nEvery other year Michael was the best driver on the grid by a clear margin. You‚Äôd be able to say the same about 1999 if it wasn‚Äôt for the injury, it‚Äôs one of the weakest years from a driving calibre perspective among the frontrunning teams.']",9,45,0.91,9,44,44,-1,1,-0.010000000000000009,-1
