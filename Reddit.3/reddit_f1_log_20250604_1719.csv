What irritates me is when Jack was struggling all we heard about was how he is going to lose his seat the poor fella must of had pressure from everywhere, but now Franco is struggling and there doesn't seem to be anywhere near the pressure. Why is that? The media doesn't seem to even want to talk about him or even interview him. I saw at least 10 interviews with Jack before he stood down asking him the worst questions, and some of them were very rude. Why the different treatment?","['as an aussie it was pretty rough watching the treament of doohan. everything with him was a comparison to his dad (way more than they ever have with sainz/sainz)and then basic ""how did pace feel today?""\n\nthe narrative the whole time was essentially he wasnt good enough and waiting him out til he was replaced, which seemed to be a plan regardless of how he did', 'Because it was 90% Franco’s batshit fan base that raved about Doohan 24/7, and now ofc he’s not performing like they expected they’re all quiet', ""Same reason we don't hear about Lawson vs Tsunoda.

The issue is that Gasly has been the only one to come even close to extracting it. Colapinto seems to be pretty similar to Doohan in terms of pace which makes it looks like the millions Alpine spent to buy him out of the contract was pointless given they could have just kept Doohan in. \n\nHaving said that, Alpine are last in the constructors and the only way they improve on that is by giving Colapinto or Doohan some bloody stability. Time in the car is scarce and precious and you need to become an expert in how it handles to be able to extract the lap time and be able to give solid feedback regarding the set up. Just look at how Sainz and Hamilton aren’t fully up to speed yet despite how good they are. \n\nAs for the media, there are far more interesting stories on the grid and this one is just a B Tech version of the Tsunoda at Red Bull story.', 'Because the ""5 race contract"" isn\'t an actual thing and was most probably invented by the Alpine PR department.
