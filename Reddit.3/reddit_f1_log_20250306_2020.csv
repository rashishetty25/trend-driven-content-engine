1j4trr4,The 'risky' McLaren F1 2025 choice that caught Red Bull's eye,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j4trr4/the_risky_mclaren_f1_2025_choice_that_caught_red/,2025-03-06, News,,"['Well this explains one reason for their improved slow corner performance compared to last year, at least during preseason testing. The front suspension of an F1 car is designed to keep the car stable under braking. One way teams achieve this is by using an “anti-dive” suspension layout (like in the MCL39), which reduces how much the car’s nose dips forward during braking. But this design choice comes with a trade-off. In a normal suspension setup, the forces from braking and cornering are spread out more evenly across the suspension components. Whereas with an anti-dive layout, certain parts of the suspension (higher-up) take on much greater forces because they are working harder to resist that forward movement of the car. This puts more stress on the components and the only way to make this design reliable is to use stronger materials potentially making it a bulkier setup.', '> In fact, Red Bull technical director Pierre Wache made an eyebrow-raising observation in Bahrain - in suggesting that McLaren may have taken a bit of a gamble with its front suspension.\n\n> Speaking to The Race, Wache said: “The suspension of the McLaren is very interesting – in terms of kinematics. And one aspect is the anti-dive. It is very high.\n\n> ""It is quite a risky kinematic for me. If they can make it work, it will be interesting.”\n\n> Asked what he meant by it being risky, Wache said: “In terms of the load on the suspension legs and everything.”\n\nThe Race then proceeds to explain what Pierre means in detail, key takeaway:\n\n> And it is this layout that Wache thinks could pose some risks – with the anti-dive layout perhaps exposing the individual suspension components to much greater structural forces than a more normal suspension layout would have.\n\n> This could pose headaches in terms of opening up potential reliability problems, but also perhaps require compromises in needing to bulk up individual components to make sure they are strong enough. That has weight consequences.', 'So.... Something something car loses front wheels at the end of straight....\n\nPierre knows something about that I think.', 'I suppose I would trust the McLaren engineers who designed it and presumably tested it, over the Red Bull ones who simply got to look at it, but… we will see how it works out! The McLaren looked lightning fast in testing, hopefully reliability doesn’t take a step back.', ""If there's one team I'd put my money on understanding composites and their ability to take dynamic forces well, it would be the team that introduced the first carbon fiber F1 chassis and 'mini-DRS'. Even if it's risky, you don't win in F1 by playing safe."", 'That MCL38 vs MCL39 dissected comparison would make an amazing interactive compare view thing where you have the slider to drag back and forth over the car. Love the art they do every time.', ""The question of suspension kinematics has something to do with structural integrity, but the biggest concern is driver feedback, wasn't it?"", 'Ngl the angle of that drawing makes it look like a tractor.', 'Hoping for a McLaren rocket ship\n\nLando and Oscar are good guys.

(0:02) I see other drivers making a similar 'correction' sometimes, where it basically looks like they're trying to turn into the corner again mid-corner. Are they trying to get the front tires to grip up? Or is he catching oversteer?"", 'Was cleaning up some space when I came across [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/VDh5WCu.jpeg) from a few years ago of Albert Park. I was in Melbourne for a wedding. A friend lives there. He picked me up and on the way to our brunch we detoured through Albert Park, and I took this picture as a memento. Nice little reminder of our friendship and that catch up after so long.', 'Hey, my friends and I have a little season long predictions pool with some standalone pick questions (like “which race will the title be decided at”, # of GP winners, will there be a first time winner, etc)\n\nDoes anybody have any suggestions of questions we could add?\n\nPreferably with an objective answer', ""[I'm always super impressed by Barrichello when i watch the highlights of this fantastic race](https://youtu.be/AXIdNpq8uxs?si=0eVEnsY62X_2Pu1I).

And personally, it’s also nice to hear that I’m not the only one who sees it as a missed opportunity for F1 not to have regenerative braking on the front wheels—at the very least, to recover some energy.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ltBgnIt8aLQ?si=VtP5qSI6UUH7BjRV', "">Are they trying to get the front tires to grip up? Or is he catching oversteer?\n\nProbably a bit of both. Counter-steering will catch oversteer, and opening up the steering can actually give the front tyres a bit more grip as you're not overloading them with too harsh angle of steering."", ""I think he is catching oversteer. If you slow the video down to x0.25 speed its easier to see. Lewis makes three distinct increases in steering angle on corner entry. Just after the third increase, you can see the car rotate more while he's maintaining that steering angle, and then right after, he makes the steering adjustment before hitting the apex and proceeding through the corner exit"", 'You can try to take some inspiration from the yearly quiz here: https://redd.it/1izaw6d']",11,8,0.82,11,8,8,-1,1,-0.010000000000000009,-1
