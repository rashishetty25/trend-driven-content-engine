In the past days we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating Hulkenberg's podium.

So in order to properly commemorate this historic event we decided to create a limited edition flair, featuring a limited edition emoji made by u/Blanchimont.   
  
This flair can only be claimed in the next 27 hours. So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance. If you change your flair back after the 27 hours you will not be able to recover the limited edition flair.  
  
To claim this flair all you have to do is to send a comment under this post including the words ""Hulkenpodium"" or ""Hulkengoat"" (and pray that AutoModerator doesn't crash and burn)

Alonso was in points, so they decided to get Alonso on a more conservative strategy.

I can only wish he could get more of those strokes', 'The biggest problem was that when his inters were dead they pitted Lance instead of him gifting him track position over Alonso making him lose a huge amount of time\n\nNot just that the slick call was way too early', 'For not the first time this season, the lower qualifying positions use a gamble strat and wins big. Haas has done it a few times.\n\nUnfortunate for Alonso, but they’re always going to play it safer for the driver who’s starting in the top 10.', 'I love Fernando in F1 but he could be winning in other categories with teams that actually value him.', ""Stroll was just in the absolute perfect position to swap onto softs under the second VSC, since they knew he wouldn't lose too much track position (did he even lose any positions?) and would come out ahead of the existing slick runners. And then he was in the exact right place when the rain started to fall, to get off the slicks and onto new inters. I think frustration at how well that worked out led to the Alonso-onto-mediums gamble, which was just way too early at that point."", 'As much as I loved seeing a Hulk podium, I reckon Alonso could have held the P3 much more convincingly to have had the outside podium chance.\n\nWhilst I also get that Stroll\'s strategy was more of a ""fuck it, we\'ve got nothing to lose""; it\'s baffling that they wouldn\'t listen to their lead driver on strategy calls.\n\nIt reminds me of some of Vettel\'s final races; granted the circumstances were a bit different, but the Aston strategy calls when he was the lead car almost appeared to be in favour of getting Stroll a point, instead of consolidating the 8 / 10 / however many points that Seb was running in at the time', 'Got absolutely screwed. Same as when Gasly threw gravel on the track just ahead of him in Australia in low visibility conditions and when his engine expired in Monaco.\xa0', 'Stroll gets ""experimental"" strategies actually more often than people probably realize - he tends to qualify significantly behind Alonso / way too far away from points. It doesn\'t always work, in fact it doesn\'t most of the time but when it does it yields some very good results. \n\nFor Alonso, the big problem is, I noticed, is that the team is just very slow to react. Undercuts almost never happen, Alonso is often left out 2-3 laps longer than he should be, the tyre dropoff is also brutal on the aston which makes things much worse.', 'Alonso was basically given the same strategy as the frontrunners staying out and then pitting for fresh inters on lap 11 which most of the grid did. Hulkenberg was the first driver to pit for inters on lap 9, then Stroll and Hadjar both pit for inters on lap 10, before everyone else followed on lap 11. \n\nAt the time Alonso was up in P6 only behind both McLarens, Verstappen, Hamilton, and Gasly. I think Stroll had a lot less to lose being further back so he pit first for softs on lap 7 during the VSC, a very bold call that no one else on the grid did.\n\nSo I agree with you that Alonso was more so unlucky that he lost out because Aston Martin were playing it safe as he was already high up in P6, whereas they gambled with Stroll and actually benefited massively. \n\nBut they later also took a gamble with Alonso as he was the first car to pit from the second set of inters and switch to slicks on the mediums, which turned out to be several laps too early. \n\nOverall Alonso was just unlucky when it came to the strategy calls.

Just watched an Open Wheel Opinion video on Red Bull and she basically said Max is balancing the car on a knife’s edge like Senna used to able to and that’s the only reason it’s placing so high.

1luxkb3,In equal machinery which driver do you think would win at each track?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1luxkb3/in_equal_machinery_which_driver_do_you_think/,2025-07-08, Discussion,"For some reason this thought popped into my mind while I was trying to get to sleep last night.

So I decided to go through each track this morning and who I thought would be most likely to win each race.

This is what I came up with,

Australia - Verstappen - tight with Norris. Albon and Alonso.

China - Russell - Prime Hamilton might win here, but Russell is quite underrated in China imo.

Japan - Verstappen - And it's not even close. 

Bahrain - Leclerc - He is spectacular in Bahrain. Shoutout to Gasly too.

Saudi Arabia - Piastri - This was a really hard one. Verstappen, Piastri, Leclerc and even Russell are all very good here. Piastri just beats Leclerc for me.

Miami - Verstappen - Very hard one to pick. Nobody seems to have always been clean in Miami. 

Imola - Verstappen - Verstappen has basically dropped a 10/10 performance every race he's driven in Imola. 

Monaco - Leclerc has been unlucky in the past  but is rapid around his streets. Shoutout to Ocon.

Spain - Verstappen did have a mad moment this year but it's not for a lack of pace. Prime Lewis might beat him but he was underwhelming this year so Max takes it.

Canada - Verstappen - Russell is good in Montreal, but this is a battle between he three world champions on the grid. Verstappen, Hamilton and Alonso. I'll give Max the edge because he's in his prime and he does not beat his team mates here, he destroys them.

Austria - Verstappen - I really wanted to give this one to Lando but Max's record here is incredible.

Britain - Hamilton - Verstappen and Norris are really good in Silverstone, but I have to pick Hamilton. 

Belgium - Verstappen - He seems to be driving on easy mode every time we come to Spa. Hamilton and Piastri are both very good here too.

Hungary - Hamilton - Lewis has been great here every race since 2017. Verstappen is very good too.

Netherlands - Verstappen - He's won here in 2021-2023 and then got a strong 2nd in 2024. Gasly is also very very good around Zandvoort. Lando and Fernando too.

Italy - Leclerc - Hamilton, Sainz, Leclerc, Russell. A good few very good drivers around Monza. I narrowed it down to Leclerc vs Hamilton. I guess we'll find out who's better this year. I'll go Leclerc (Shoutout to Ricciardo when he was in F1)

Azerbaijan - Leclerc - Perez not being on the grid makes this an easier choice. Leclerc is fabulous around Baku, especially in qualifying.

Singapore - Norris - Lando is fantastic around Singapore and every year he has raced in Singapore he's maximised his performance. 

USA - Verstappen has been incredible here ever since his rookie season. Norris and Hamilton (bar last year) are very good too.

Mexico - Verstappen - Another one of Max's great tracks. In fact Max has won by 12-20 seconds 5 seperate times in Mexico. (Shoutout to Ricciardo again when he was in F1, he was great around here)

Brazil - Verstappen - This is an interesting one. Hamilton used to be great here but he hasn't had a good race in Brazil since 2021. Verstappen is great in Interlagos, Russell is very good too, as are Norris and Sainz. 

Las Vegas - Leclerc - We've only had two races in Vegas so it's hard to choose. Gasly is great in Quali but had terrible race pace in 2023. I'll go with Leclerc as the best overall. His performance in 2023 was fabulous and he was still alright in 2024. 

Qatar - Verstappen - Verstappen and Russell are great around this circuit . Shoutout to Gasly again. Max just pips George for me courtesy of his race here last season.

Abu Dhabi - Verstappen - Leclerc, Hamilton, Verstappen, Sainz, Norris and even Tsunoda Quite a few drivers tend to impress in the final race of the year. Peak Hamilton might win here but as for right now it's between Verstappen and Norris. Max had an incident last year but it wasn't for lack of pace. He also won 4 races in a row from 2020-2023. 

So what do you think? I had a blast writing this and would love to hear your thoughts.","['Hulkenberg of course', 'Equally bad or equally good?', 'On their current form? Max would sweep', 'The obvious answer is Max, but this scenario would give us highly motivated Hamilton and Alonso.', 'I’m glad to see so many Hulkenpodium flairs\U0001fae1', 'Definitely Stroll', 'Equal cars Verstappen would be the favorite for every track.', 'I think you might be underestimating the liked of Alonso and, of course, Hülkenberg\xa0', 'Highly depend on wich machinery. If they all compete on a RB, Max win every single gp.']",0,53,0.4,0,38,38,0,7,0.010000000000000009,0
