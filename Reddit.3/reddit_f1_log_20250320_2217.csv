Obviously to win in an underpowered car you'd want the safety car and rain on your side. But for a team like Jordan GP where in 1998 they barely started getting points 5 rounds prior, they pulled through with insane strategy, and secured a 1-2 as a first win.

Oscar made more mistakes than that one.

By the time they were past and McLaren was ready to let them fight again, Oscar was more than two seconds back. That wasn\'t because of team orders, it was because Oscar made a mistake that wasn\'t on the main broadcast. Oscar\'s a great driver.

I\'m not sure it was one of anyone\'s best F1 races except maybe Yuki\'s, and technically Kimi\'s since it was his first F1 race. And that Haas is so terrible, I couldn\'t say for sure about Bearman.

1jfh220,Which is the most successful current seat in F1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jfh220/which_is_the_most_successful_current_seat_in_f1/,2025-03-20, Discussion,"Inspired by u/akastus's question about the most successful race engineer, I was wondering which F1 seat has had the most world championships won in it? That is, tracing which side of the garage a driver is on and finding out which one has the most driver's champions victories.

I know Max is in Vettel's old seat (both drove with Riccardo), so that seat has 8.

Kimi's seat has 6 for sure, but what about Button's championship, (if that counts), both drivers left Brawn when it went to Mercedes. Rosberg and Barrichello switched seats to and from Williams, so does that mean it was Button whose seat was taken up by Schumacher and later Hamilton, making it 7?

But it's got to be an old team, Ferrari or McLaren probably

Ferrari has 15 driver's titles, so at least 8 are in the same seat, McLaren has 12, so might beat Ferrari out?

Okay, so it probably can't be Ferrari *or* McLaren, neither has a clear 8 to beat Red Bull.

Oddly, the only other competitor is Mercedes, if you count Brawn and Tyrell then it should be feasible for Lewis's seat to beat RB

*Okay so by my calculations, the most successful seat I can track is Max's current seat, as 8 drivers championships have been won in it, second best is a tie between Raikkonen and Schumacher's Ferrari seat, Senna, Lauda, Hunt, and Fittipaldi's McLaren seat, and Lewis's Mercedes seat. All at six.*","[""Okay, so Raikkonen and Schumacher had the same seat, that's 6  \nScheckter is the other seat, with Lauda that's 4\n\nWhen Lauda and Regazzoni come in there is a complete driver replacement, I think Regazzoni took Ickx's seat, as Ickx leaves of his own volition mid season, and Regazzoni has to recommend Lauda.\n\nAand now it's 1971 and Ferrari has entered three cars in multiple races.\n\nThe way the cars and seats boil down, I think only Ickx can be followed further.\n\nI don't think I can follow this trail back further, from '70 to '69 all three drivers get changed out, and while I could say Ickx, who also drove in '68, is a good enough connection, the same issue occurs in '67.\n\nSo it probably can't be Ferrari, unless they're a strong case to tie the drivers together before there are only two. (Someone might be able to trace the actual cars, as they hold over from season to season at this point."", ""Ferrari or McLaren I'm not sure though, Williams was pretty successful in the past too. Ohh, Mercedes perhaps .."", ""Vettel+Verstappen= (4+4) 8\nSchumacher+Raikkonen (5+1) 6\nWith Hamilton It's difficult because Brawn Is Mercedes, but both drivers changed for 2010, if you count that It,'s 7"", 'You need to factor in three championships Sir Jackie Stewart won for Tyrell/Matra, it\'s practically Lewis\' seat.\xa0\n\n\nWilliams have 7 WDCs, too, just so you know.\n\n\nThe whole concept of counting titles per ""seat"" is problematic. In 95% of the cases there is a clear driver number one.\xa0', ""Aston Martins first seat.\n\nIt's priceless"", 'Maybe you could think of it as lead, 2nd, 3rd/reserve etc. to include earlier eras and team orders', ""Okay so McLaren:\n\nAlready an issue; I don't know how to determine who Alonso replaced and who Hamilton replaced, I'll figure that out later and go down the list\n\nHakkinen, Prost, 5\n\nSenna, Lauda, Hunt, Fittipaldi 6\n\nSo no matter what this doesn't beat Verstappen-Vettel\n\nEdit: Alonso replacing Raikkonen makes:\n\nHamilton, Senna, Lauda, Hunt, Fittipaldi 7"", ""I *think* it's got to be one of those two, Ferrari has 15 so if they're evenly split one will have 8 Driver's, while Williams only has 7 total. \n\n**However** a lot of Ferrari Driver's championships date from before there were only two seats per term, so it's possible some of those champions drove for seats that can't be counted anymore"", ""I theoretically could count Stewart's 3 at Tyrell/Matra as one of the seats of Mercedes, so if that's Button-Hamilton that's 10, the clear winner, but I got stuck at the 1980-81 gap, very little info and both drivers switch""]",33,14,0.74,33,57,57,1,0,0.0,1
