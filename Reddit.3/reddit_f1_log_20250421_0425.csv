Here‚Äôs the breakdown (Stroll‚Äôs Q1 exits listed first each year compared to teammate):

	‚Ä¢	2017 ‚Äì Massa: 11 - 3
	‚Ä¢	2018 ‚Äì Sirotkin: 15 - 16
	‚Ä¢	2019 ‚Äì Perez: 14 - 7

	‚Ä¢	2024 ‚Äì Alonso: 5 - 3
	‚Ä¢	2025 ‚Äì Alonso: 3 - 0

Total: Stroll ‚Äì 74 | Teammates ‚Äì 46

My count gets to 74 instead of 75 so there‚Äôs a qualifying elimination that I‚Äôve missed out but it‚Äôs largely accurate. 

Vettel in 2022 was a bit of a surprise with nearly as many Q1 exits as Stroll. But overall, his record relative to teammates hasn‚Äôt looked quite as dire since 2020. He did have a streak of 5 consecutive Q1 knockouts in mid 2023 after the AM became undriveable and Bahrain / Japan this year was poor with mistakes.

And everytime there are 2 sides with great arguments. Yet the stewards very clearly only see it as black or white. 

  
The ahead of the apex rule absolutely needs to go, the only thing it does is create confusion. space should always be given if someone is alongside. You shouldnt be able to squeeze them off just because you were 10 cm in front. As a driver thats very hard to see. This not only kills the racing. but also gives us anti climax races. Another problem this rule creates, is that it gets abused alot. ''im in front? i better just push the other driver off cuz its legal anyway'' 

it also creates scenarios where drivers are fully alongside but still need to bail out in awkward spots or risk a penalty or it kills the battle entirely.  take today for example. what could max have done different? Just not turn in? Just brake so hard that he makes a switchback? But that cant be because there are cars behind. the only thing he couldve done is cut the track and give the position back. But thats just bad racing. That someone can win a battle simply because they were the car that was slightly in front. at that point its not really racing anymore.

im pretty sure there isnt another series outside of formula that uses this format of wheel to wheel rules. Its stupid, outdated, confusing. And every incident is different. So why is it so black and white. You dont own a corner, its that simple. you share it.

And there is a very simple solution. When 2 cars are going side by side at the turn in of a corner (front axle near rear axle) space should be given by both sides.

Corners have multiple apexes, depending on the line you're taking. In a situation such as this, where a car is on the inside, while the other is on the outside, the apexes will differ. So this is not a good benchmark to begin with. \n\nNot only that, but chicanes are actually a nightmare in this situation. Same scenario - two cars alongside each other. The one on the inside has ths entry. Fine. The problem is that the car on the outside upon entry has the better line for the exit out of the chicane. And that's what I hate the most about this situation. Everybody, from the fans to the stewards act like this ain't actually a thing. \n\nThe rulings they always dish out in these scenarios clearly indicate that they expect the car that has the worse line upon entry to yield the whole chicane. But nobody has the guts to actually lay it out in writing. To actually turn it into a rule. Because how the hell would you tell racing drivers to yield two corners based on a relative benchmark?\n\nNow with regards to the Verstappen-Piastri situation.  Please don't come at me with the 'Max would've never made the corner' nomsense. That's the single dumbest take I've seen within the F1 community since 2021.\n\nHe obviously did make the corner. He didn't go out because he had too much speed. He went out because Oscar took the optimal line throughout the whole chicane. Now, yet again, if the standard for chicanes is indeed that the car with the optimal line upon entry is entitled to the whole thing, then fine. I don't agree with it, but turn it into a rule. We don't even have this. We only have rulings that act as if this is what the regulations say, but they don't.\n\nI think Max was a bit too ambitious, however I really dislike how Oscar acts as if the chicane was entirely his. The fact is that he wasn't actually ahead at the apex, which is why people keep spreading around the whole 'Max wouldn't have made the corner nonsense'. They are aware of it, they just pretend that Max was alongside/ahead simply because he bombed into the corner. It's clearly not the case. \n\nIf you don't like Max's behavior in t1, which I can see why, then you shouldn't like Oscar's behavior in t2 either. He clearly had not attention to leave any space and acted as if he was a full car length ahead.\n\nIf they didn't take any action against Hamilton in Abu Dhabi 2021, then they shouldn't have taken any here as well. \n\nThe truth is that Max has a solid case in claiming that he was pushed out. Because he clearly was, midway through the chicane. Just like Hamilton could make this case with regards to the Abu Dhabi lap 1 incident.""]",58,92,0.77,58,87,87,-1,1,0.0,-1

1k3fzbf,2025 Saudi Arabia Qualifying - Speed Traps,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k3fzbf/2025_saudi_arabia_qualifying_speed_traps/,2025-04-20, Statistics,"Here are speeds for each driver from the FIA for 2025 Saudi Arabia qualifying.

It shows how hard it might be for the McLarens to overtake here, as they have a below average speed in most sectors, except Oscar in Intermediate 1 and Lando at the finish line. Their overall maximum speed is below average for both drivers.

The second image is the same data and shows speed differential to the driver above them on the grid (Driver Ahead) for each sector and the speed trap, as well as where they sit within the field (Ave).

Oscar has no sectors in the green, which means his speeds are average or below average. Lando is solidly 14th in all sectors and the speed trap, apart from the finish line, where he is first.

Max and Yuki have all sectors in the green.

George only has one sector in the green, Intermediate  2 and Kimi is the same.

Charles has all sectors in the green, apart from the finish line. Lewis is green in all sectors, so it shows he is losing time in corners.

At no point on the track is Oscar faster than Max, though if he has DRS, it might change things.

For Lando, his maximum speed is slower than 7 of the 9 drivers ahead of him, with only Oscar and Kimi slower. As above, he is fastest at the finish line. In Intermediate 1, only Kimi is slower of those ahead of him, and in Intermediate 2, only Oscar is slower.

Hope you like this. Will be interesting to see if cornering speed and tyre management will be enough for McLaren to overcome their speed deficit.

1k3zqmf,Has the ground effect era been a success?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k3zqmf/has_the_ground_effect_era_been_a_success/,2025-04-20, Discussion,"Given this is the last season before another shift in regulations, the question is simple, but also rather complicated at the same time. Most ‚Äòcasual‚Äô F1 fans would look at the question at face value, and probably come to the conclusion that no, it has not. The simple reason being Red Bull‚Äôs dominance since the introduction of the regulation changes. 

However, there is also the argument to be made that Max‚Äôs dominance could mislead opinions. It was only in 2023 that the Red Bull managed a 1-2 in championship standings, 2022 saw Perez finishing 3rd on a similar points tally to Charles, with George not miles behind. 2024 seeing Perez all the way down in 8th. Which suggest as everyone understands, the Red Bull certainly has had its struggles in terms of drivability. 

F1 isn‚Äôt just about championships though, so what about the rest of the field? I think the best measure for this is to look at average overtakes per season, given the whole reasoning behind the reg changes was to promote better racing, with cars being able to follow closer to the car in front, and for longer without their tyres being cooked. So, let‚Äôs look at the numbers:

2014: 45.2
2015: 33.1
2016: 52.2
2017: 25.5
2018: 35.7
2019: 45.2
2020: 36.9
2021: 36.7
2022: 45.2
2023: 50
2024: 38.8

It‚Äôs actually interesting to see that bar 2023, numbers were somewhat similar, with similar fluctuations to preceding seasons. 

For me it comes down to two questions:

1) Did it break a one team dominance?
2) Did it promote competitive racing throughout the grid?

For the first I‚Äôd say again, a complicated answer. Yes, Red Bull were dominant. However, the overwhelming reason behind this was Max‚Äôs pure dominance. With the second seat looking more in line with the other top teams. So, I would argue that whilst on the face of things the answer would be a no, if you take the Max factor into consideration it‚Äôs actually a yes. 

For the second, I think as the numbers support, we didn‚Äôt see a suddenly more competitive mid to lower pack, with it seemingly staying around the same in terms of competitive performance.

I also think we‚Äôre now seeing with multiple years of development of cars under the regs it‚Äôs becoming less competitive. The joke of this season being more of a qualifying championship than a racing one, popping up far too frequently than we‚Äôd like.

Interested to see other people‚Äôs perspective on this topic.
","['Mixed bag really. At the start it was a 2 horse race, then 1 horse collapsed.\n\nIt then had the most one sided championship in F1 history. \n\nBut then, a year later, 7 drivers had multiple race wins, a new record, and a new WCC after 15 years. \n\nNow it looks like a tight WDC between 2 drivers, but Max is always there, and George is 1-2 upgrades away from becoming a shadow contender himself.', ""Following is significantly easier compared to before but the FiA's refusal to police teams for adding more and more over body down force has led to similar issues with being able to actually pass.\n\nSo in some cases its a success and in others its a failure."", 'I would say no. From memory the idea of ground effect was to allow cars to race more closely and be less troubled by dirty air. It‚Äôs pretty obvious that dirty air is still a huge issue. \n\nI feel like the regulations change a lot rather than evolve. Maybe if they evolved then they could find ways to mitigate dirty air etc and have closer racing. Every time regulations reset we seem to end up with the one team dominance you mentioned.', ""One point here, regs are not created to prevent one team dominance. The cost cap/WT weighting is supposed to do that. I'd say its been mildly successful in doing so."", ""not really. in 2022 it was good. but once teams developed their cars again. dirty air came back. now 2025 it's close to 2021 levels again. not quite but we see in the times how cars stay around 1.2 sec away to get away from the dirty air.\n\nmaybe 2026 it will get better with the inwash concept but I dunno."", ""It does genuinely seem like cars can follow closer than before. Hadjar was in the DRS of both Williams for over 10 laps today. In Japan both McLarens were right behind Max for absolutely ages, and other cars were in similar positions throughout the field. That wouldn't have been possible in the previous regs\n\nThe problem is that following closely hasn't necessarily led to more overtaking."", 'DRS, 18"" rims, massive cars, overly complex hybrid powertrains, letting teams outwash the front wing again...ground effect is just one facet of the current formula\'s disappointment.', 'was only one good season during it', 'Wouldn\'t say so, no. The closer-than-ever grid is more a result of the wind tunnel scaling and the cost cap propperly kicking in than anything. But the main promise was to have better on-track action, and that has mostly failed. Races since late 2023 look awfully similar to the 2021 cars, often with DRS trains or fly-by overtakes. Dirty air is a problem again, and the tires.....oh boy, where do I even begin here. \n\nThe tires are the one thing I hate the MOST about this ruleset. Pirelli wanted F1 to have a bit more road relevance, and they needed to develop a tire with less thermal degradation, that was less prone to overheating, and could be pushed in a more consistent manner, with a wider operating window, while still allowing for different strategy options. Thus, they made the decision to switch to the new 18-inch wheels with narrow sidewalls. \n\nAnd they have failed in every aspect. They are still overly finicky, can\'t handle a full qualifying lap on most circuits, and there\'s often little to no difference between tire compounds - how often have we seen drivers saying that the hards ""were too good""? And to top it all off, they are one of the main culprits in the massive weight increase from the already quite heavy 2017-2021 cars to now. \n\nBut the thing is - it *almost* worked. There were some brief moments in 2022 where we had lightning in a bottle, like Austria and especially Silverstone, where we had 3, 4, 5 even 6 cars on frame battling for position. Those bits of racing were absolutely glorious to watch. And then....nothing. Back to the usual.\n\nAll in all, there were some banger races, especially last year.

1k3sk0b,The Verstappen and Piastri incident today have highlighted that the overtaking/defending rules in F1 need to change,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k3sk0b/the_verstappen_and_piastri_incident_today_have/,2025-04-20, Discussion,"The title speaks for itself, these overtaking rules in F1 are ridiculous. All this ""ahead at the apex"" stuff is utter BS. In every other motorsport in the world, the rule is that if 2 cars are side by side going into a corner, both cars must leave a cars width of space for the other car throughout the duration of the corner. It doesn't matter who got to the corner first, if they are side by side under breaking, they must leave space. Piastri didn't do that.

The way the rules are currently makes F1's racecraft look like a joke despite being the pinicle of motorsport. And I should know, the driving standards in Nascar right now leave a lot to be desired, but this is ridiculous. What Piastri did today would have been penalized in Imsa, Wec, Indycar, etc... or at the very least, no penalty and let Verstappen keep the place. Not only are the current rules stupid, but they actively hurt the racing product because drivers can't race side by side for an extended time because one of them will be forced off track. This isn't even the only incident of this manner. Look at Verstappen and Norris at Cota last year, or Verstappen and Lewis at Abu Dhabi in 2021. This has been a problem for a long time. 

These rules need to change, and the penalty for it also needs to be substantial to discourage drivers from doing this. I'm thinking it should be a drive through like you see in Imsa for similar incidents.","['I think that it shows how poorly this track is designed.

It looks like the onboard cameras have very low resolution and bitrates from the artifacts. It should have at least a 1080p.

Ferrari was able to livestream an onboard shot at Le Mans WEC with better quality

You are comparing a trackside fullsize 4K broadcast camera with fiber uplinks to a lightweight, wireless, webcam style camera in the car.\n\nThe onboard cameras are 1080p, however these are tiny cameras, with very small sensors. Image quality is thus already lower. Now combine that with the fact that the car has to sent the images wirelessly it also sends this 1080p footage with low bitrates. \n\nThe quality of footage we‚Äôre getting is amazing for what it is.', ""I remember when all on board footage would cut out when there was a tall building or tunnel between the car and the antenna.\n\nAren't we getting a little spoiled, watching races live all over the world from multiple angles from cars doing 330 kph?"", ""[The Science Behind Onboard Cameras | F1 TV Tech Talk | Crypto.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDqdMyHxayU)\n\nAll onboard cameras share the wireless signal together with all the telemetry, radio, transponders and basically all realtime communication from the car to the pitbox. They are capped in bitrate because they reserve the rest for the more important stuff like things mentioned above.\n\nThe cameras themselves are 4K but they can't send that signal so they record it locally. That's why you will see replays on social media that are pristine in quality, as they use the recording from the car that they take after the race is done. \n\nThey also need to be incredibly light, as every extra milligram of weight means they need to take it from somewhere else. All in all these are about as high-tech as they can be.\n\nAnd let's not forget, the production and broadcast center is in Biggin Hill in the UK, no matter where the race is in the world. So at any time during the race, about 120 video feeds are sent in real time over dedicated fiber from any place on the planet to Biggin Hill where the signal is being produced and the World Feed is made."", ""I'm shocked we're able to wirelessly get video AT ALL from all 20 cars going around a 4 mile track at 200 mph."", ""> It looks like the onboard cameras have very low resolution and bitrates from the artifacts.  \n  \nThe onboard cameras themselves were 720p until F1TV Premium was introduced - as you're showing screenshots from Sky, maybe they're upscaling it from a different resolution?  \nhttps://f1tv.formula1.com/detail/1000008550/tech-talk-how-f1-s-onboard-cameras-work-"", ""Like, okay ?
