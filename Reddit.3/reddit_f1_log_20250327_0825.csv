Hulkenberg completely lost the rear on seemingly normal acceleration on the exit of T3/4, having to save multiple severe oversteer moments that put him into the gravel, damaging his floor and effectively ending his race. Later on in the lap, Bortoleto was in a battle with Bearman, and turned in relatively normally into T8 and instantly lost the rear in a basically unsavable moment that put him into the gravel, taking him out of race contention as well.

Both of these moments can be viewed here: [https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z\_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68](https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68)

If one of these drivers had experienced this alone, it would be easy to put it down to driver error. However, the appearance of a similar issue on both cars in the first lap in seemingly innocuous moments when the drivers weren't even trying to make a move, leads me to believe that there was potentially some sort of issue on the car, or more specifically, the tyre preparation plan that the team had in place during the formation lap (ie number of burnouts, target tyre temp). It seems likely that the team made a miscalculation that resulted in the rear tyres being out of the window on both cars to start the race.

But can the MGUK be made so energy-recovering/efficient that a front MGUK is not needed? Especially with the upcoming regulation changes in 2026.\n\nOr is this actually already possible but simply limited by regulations?', 'Yes and no. Because the weighing is done after the race there are no restrictions (outside of doping etc) about what you can consume or dispose of before the race. However, drivers and their teams do try and understand how much weight the driver will lose during the race (more of an issue at say Singapore than Imola for example) and they try and balance the car with that in mind.', ""> But can the MGUK be made so energy-recovering/efficient that a front MGUK is not needed? Especially with the upcoming regulation changes in 2026.  \n  \nBasically it's all down to the energy potential of a moving car that determines the limit of recovery (as well as some translation loss through magnets in the engine, wiring and conversion to chemical storage [batteries]).  \nBut the regulations are actually the ones that limit how much energy can be recovered.  \n  \nCurrently it's artificially limited to 2MJ per lap and starting 2026 it is artificially limited to 8-9MJ per lap.  \n  \nTake a simple 7th grade physics calculation, how much potential energy does a 750kg car have, when it's going at 200kph.  \n\nKE = 1/2\\*m\\*v\\^2  \nm = 750 kg  \nv = 200 km/hr = 200,000 m/hr = 200,000/3,600 s/hr = 55.55 m/s  \nKE = 1/2\\*750 kg\\*(55.55 m/s)\\^2  \nKE = 1,157,175.9 J  \n  \nOr ~1.1MJ when it's running at 200kph (or maybe I'm misremembering my maths).  \n  \nIf the circuit has 10 places where it could do a full stop from that speed - that's ~11MJ of potential kinetic energy, of which currently only 2MJ can be recovered based on regulations.  \nWith 2026 regulations we're still not recovering all of the potential energy due to artificial limitation on how much is allowed to be recovered during a lap (this is also done to avoid drivers going unnecessarily slow in corners, to speed out with a MGU-K boost).  \n  \nAs the cars are a bit heavier and can go much faster - meaning there is much more potential energy and as they don't do a full stop, there is slightly less potential energy, but using the same formula you can easily calculate the potential energy of a car going at 350kph, slowing down to 100kph and do this for every corner at all circuits.""]",2,4,0.75,2,4,4,1,3,-0.25,1
1jkev3g,Verstappen driving style vs teammates,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jkev3g/verstappen_driving_style_vs_teammates/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"Is Yuki’s cornering technique in concept the most similar to Verstappens out of all his teammates since Riccardo left and development was focused on the dutchman?

I have read that Tsunodas driving style is sharp and quick preferring a pointy front end and loose rear. he is also very late and aggressive on breaking. The main difference is being that he lacks the smoothness and a robotic precision that Verstappen has but he has good reflexes. 

From what Ive seen, it seems like Yuki’s driving style is a more ""staccato"" version of of Verstappen. With that being said is Yuki not more well placed to develop into a better teammate? 

Because at least he follows the same philosophy, whereas other teammates would have had to change their whole way of thinking about a corner to adapt Tsunoda seemingly needs to """"just"""" smooth everything out. What were the driving styles of Verstappens failed teammates

Sidenote i dream of what Leclerc vs Verstappen in redbull would look like. ","[""I expect Tsunoda to struggle at least initially but I think he's Red Bull's best option at this point. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see just how far off Tsunoda is compared to Lawson on the Racing Bulls.  I still don't think the Racing Bulls car is faster (with Max behind the wheel) than the Red Bull but there is definitely a drivability difference."", 'We’ll find out soon enough- sink or swim time for TSU', ""A lot of drivers like the pointy front - Leclerc, Gasly, Albon, and Tsunoda as well. \n\nUsually, the issue is that Max sets up the car so extreme that it's borderline undrivable without being extremely good and accustomed to the car. There's a great interview with Albon about how the issue progresses. You set up your car less extreme than Max and you're slower a bit but then you want to compete with him, you push too hard and then you make mistakes and you lose confidence in the car and that's it for you\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ddEW\\_jHupA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ddEW_jHupA)"", 'A F1 car is designed to go as fast as they can design in around a track, without a driver in mind. \nThis car is “delivered” to the racing team that is going to set it up from circuit to circuit with automated and driver in the loop sims to find the fastest. Just at the last moment, a drivers preference is dailed in on track. \n\nThe difference between the tier of drivers get bigger when that car that is designed and setup by those 1000 people, has a small window of performance or is somewhat unpredictable. \n\nThis means that the RedBull car just isn’t a well balanced predictable car where anyone that’s not Verstappen, Hamilton or other top tier drivers can get that performance out. \n\nBut. The other way round, a driver maybe need a car to behave a certain way to get get his “mojo”. And if that’s not there, well, most of the times it’s just.. that’s a lost season or lost career.', ""I think the whole driving style conversation is a bit played out. For example (looking at your last sentence), in one of the interviews where Albon talked about the pointiness of the Red Bull car, he mentioned that he prefers more oversteer even when compared to drivers like Leclerc. Does this mean Charles would perform worse alongside Max than Alex did? I seriously doubt it. \n\nIt likely just comes down to the Red Bull being unpredictable due to design flaws. That makes it difficult to wrangle into some good pace. Max has reported the car oversteers and understeers basically from corner to corner. Max has enough ability to catch these changes and adjust on the fly, maintaining a decent pace. The better the driver, the more likely they'll be able to do the same.\n\nWhether Yuki will be able to is less to do with his preference and more to do with his actual raw ability. Biggest test for a driver is likely that second Red Bull seat."", ""If yuki brakes late then It's the complete opposite to verstappen who brakes early"", 'Only hopium is Yuki said last year [the car will suit him](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/tsunoda-sim-test-shows-red-bull-f1-car-suits-me/10677407/) after his first simulator experience at Red Bull', ""If he's late and aggressive on the brakes I don't think he'll get on well with the car.  Max is the opposite, he generally brakes early to get a feel for and stabilise the platform, then maximises the mid corner and exit to generate lap time.\n\nBraking late and aggressively will make the car even more pointy on corner entry than it already is."", 'I recommend to check ""B-Sport"" channed on YouTube by one former F1 engineer. He looks at this more simply: Adrian Newey, as a hobby driver and experienced designer, knew which areas he can sacrifice a little, to gain much better window of ""drivability"" for the car, so that the driver will more likely take 100% from the car potential. Other RB designers just use data and performance stats, which actually do not reflect on the drivability.\n\nSo it came to this, RB car on paper is the best, but no one can extract 100% potential from it. And it is fault by design, so no tuning, no small changes of bodywork will help much.']",0,50,0.42,0,426,426,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
