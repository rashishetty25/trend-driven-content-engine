1i78lvs,"Starting today, we are banning Twitter/X content on r/formula1. We urge all journalists, creators, photographers and other F1 personalities to also make their content available on alternative platforms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i78lvs/starting_today_we_are_banning_twitterx_content_on/,2025-01-22, Meta,"**TL;DR:** For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter, with the intention to make this ban permanent in some form.

Hey everyone!

After [yesterday’s proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6lm2v/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/) we discussed within the mod team whether a full ban on Twitter content would be feasible. We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers & FOM have not. But we also realize that it’s a *chicken or the egg problem* and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a non-trivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news

In the end we’ve settled on the following approach:

* For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter with the only exception of screenshots of relevant posts by teams, drivers & F1 that are **not available on any other platform**. Even in case of major breaking news, we ask you to post links to the press releases or a screenshot of the post from Instagram, with a link in the comments.
* We hope that this trial period will provide a nudge for F1 journalists, creators and teams to make their content available on alternative platforms as **we intend to make this ban permanent in some form.**

Why a trial period? First of all, sometimes mods make bad decisions even if with the best intentions. (For example in 2015 this subreddit banned images & gifs, which caused a controversy that was only resolved after [Will Buxton stepped in to mediate the situation](https://redd.it/3jmslx).) Second of all, this is one of the strictest approaches to Twitter content and strict bans like this can have unintended consequences, so we might need to later refine this ban. We intend the trial period to last at least until the first races of the new season, after which a final form of the ban would be implemented.

This subreddit has had restrictions on what content can be posted for a very long time. We’ve had the source rating system that labeled the quality of news sites and is still used for removing sensationalist and unoriginal articles. We’ve also had limitations on Instagram due to its requirement for an account to view posts. There’s no doubt that over the past years Twitter has become a low-quality source: the login requirements, the flood of bots, the prioritization of content from paying users and promotion of sensationalist content. But unlike with news sites in our source-rating system, for Twitter there wasn’t really an alternative. But now that viable alternatives are emerging and the proposal thread from yesterday has shown that the community prefers those alternatives, **we think it’s time to try and see how the subreddit works without content from Twitter.**

# For journalists, photographers, creators & other F1 personalities

Our preferred alternative platform is Bluesky and to help avoid impersonations we have created a [list of verified F1 related accounts on Bluesky](https://go.bsky.app/57f6geP). This list is used both for feeds & starter packs on Bluesky, but also for AutoModerator here on Reddit. We are adding new verified accounts whenever we come across them, but please contact us on Bluesky or send a modmail here on Reddit to accelerate this process. We want to assist with this transition and we also want to hear your feedback throughout this trial period, so please get in touch.","['https://preview.redd.it/ffwlldom9jee1.jpeg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e7761f171e9f5d7430bb27593eb3c53408674db\n\nI see F1twt is reacting to this in a so normal way. 😭', ""Twitter was such a low bar for quality news anyway.

“It’s lights out and away we go!” I kept hearing in my head. I took my foot off the brake and hit that gas knowing I was going to have the quickest response time of anyone!

1i7kouu,[Formula Jonah] (OT) Rolex 24 at Daytona explained,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i7kouu/formula_jonah_ot_rolex_24_at_daytona_explained/,2025-01-22, Video,,"['Kevin is in a BMW!', 'This Saturday in Florida the Rolex 24 at Daytona will take place. This is the time honoured start of the professional sportscar racing season. 61 entries will compete across four classes for top honours - the winning drivers of each class being presented with a Rolex Daytona watch as a prize for their efforts. \n\n12 top class [sportscar prototype GTP/Hypercar cars](https://i.imgur.com/LYXESUc.png) will compete for overall victory, from manufacturers BMW, Porsche, Cadillac, Lamborghini and Acura. In GTD Pro, the class where GT3 road based cars are piloted by top rated professional Platinum and Gold drivers, we see 15 entries (cars) featuring 9 different road based chassis from nine different familiar manufacturers - sure to be an exciting and competitive class. [Breakdown of GTD Pro](https://www.dailysportscar.com/2025/01/22/2025-daytona-24-hours-preview-gtd-pro.html).\n\nThat\'s 27 cars with all professional driver squads - the primary focus of the broadcast. A field bigger than F1. It\'s the biggest professional GT3 field seen around the globe. And the only other championship, aside from WEC, where the GTP/Hypercar prototypes compete.\n\n24 hour races are mentally punishing. Strategy plays a huge part in racing here - stay on the lead lap and in the lead group, and after a late race safety car with 2h-1h to go, it\'s anybodies guess as to who crosses the line first to win the Rolex. Recovering from mistakes is possible, but don\'t push it too far or you\'ll be in the pits for a lengthy repair, or even out of the race altogether.\n\nIf you\'re in one of the [red highlighted countries here](https://i.imgur.com/seDLNZV.jpeg), you will need a VPN to watch on YouTube. In the USA only 6 hours will be shown on TV, the rest on the Peacock streaming service. In other blocked countries it is likely it will be on paid TV or streaming services - in my native NZ it is available on Sky Sports, for example.
