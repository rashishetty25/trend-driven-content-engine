It’s a 5.4 km layout with 22 corners, and apparently features the world’s longest banked corner. There’s a mix of high-speed sections and some more technical bits. Lap time is around 1:34.

Not gonna lie, I’m not entirely sure what to make of it. Visually it doesn’t seem all that striking, and I’m a bit on the fence about whether it’ll produce good racing.

That reconfiguration hasn’t worked and they now need to get something that does work.\n\nLet not forget Hamilton is declining as a driver. Ferrari signing Hamilton cannot have been for truly competitive regions. They would have kept Carlos if that was the case.\n\nHamilton is as much about long term Ferrari ambassadorial roles as much as anything else.\n\nLeclerc is number 1. If Ferrari had a car that was competitive vs Mclaren there might be a stronger conversation here, but Leclerc isn’t doing what Max is doing.\n\nIts Mclaren vs Max and then Merc vs Ferrari.', 'What’s interesting is that before the season starts many people include media claim Lewis will beat Charles and his Merc form dip was bc team sabotage. Now five races on, it’s people overacting, we shouldn’t expect him to outperform Charles 🤫', 'It’s been 5 races. Blimey.\n\nThis same outlet on their podcast pre season said summer break is the real measure of anyone joining a new team and there will be peaks and troughs until then. \n\nI don’t think he’ll ever be as fast as Leclerc, it’s clear these ground effect cars removed his advantage of what made him so fast, and he’s 40… but my guess is after summer break we settle in to 2ish tenths gap in qualy and similar race paces.\n\nI think Charles is as good as anyone on the grid bar old Dutchy, and it’s his team at his physical peak. I’ll just enjoy 2/3 years of a victory lap in the red car and the odd race win for Lewis.\n\nMark Hughes has always seemed very negative about Lewis, on the podcast it’s like he can never quite give him a genuine compliment.', ""I would highly recommend people listen to yesterday's podcast with Mark, Ed and Scott. They go into a bit more detail about this topic as they received lots of questions about it.\n\nAnd before people say 'But he won in China' - that's covered in the article."", ""Lewis was renowned for his adaptability. \n\nI remember when he complained about the merc as bottas was closer, when he switched to merc he stated he liked stability despite his reputation but that mclaren often gave him unstable cars and he just adapted, I remember when there were accusations that button influenced the team to direct development towards making the car more to his liking compared to Lewis' tastes, because he couldn't deal with it; doesnt matter Lewis still adapted, always. When tyres changed from bridgestone to high deg pirelli, everyone said Lewis was fucked because it wouldn't work with his aggressiveness yet he adapted and still performed at the top, becoming a tyre whisperer even. Even when he started as a rookie, people were reporting that he could easily handle cars that were so unpredictable and unstable even world champions like raikkonen or hakkinen would have complained ferociously about it.\n\nHamilton achieve what he achieved in great part because like so many greats before him, like alonso, like schumi, he could adapt to any changes thrown his way across the years.\n\nSo it's so weird to me how quick everyone is to believe that his struggles are explained simply because he can't adapt to the ferrari or even the ground effect cars. I can understand Hamilton saying it because f1 drivers clearly aren't wired to accept they could ever hit their limits and are always quick to find excuse to keep their confidence intact. \n\nBut from my pov, it feels instead like Hamilton, finally, finally declined."", ""I think it's a bit dramatic to say after just 5 races that this is untenable, and also that liberty media are going to be concerned by this!\n\nClearly it hasn't been the dream start, but it's such a long season and a lot of learning to be done for Lewis.\n\nIf anything I think him being so down after Jeddah and basically saying it's going to be bad all year, really hasn't helped him and has given ammunition to write so many articles like this. But this is always how Lewis has been, really feeling the emotions, positive or negative post race.\n\nUltimately Lewis is 40, he's not at his 2018/2019 peak anymore, but he also isn't washed. Time will tell if he can reach the level again to compete for a championship, but it's way too dramatic to say this is a Ricciardo situation after 5 races."", ""When are we allowed to to talk about his age?
