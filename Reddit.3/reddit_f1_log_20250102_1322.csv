Fuck, I think I‚Äôd put RBR second over McLaren.', ""Don't really care about those rankings but it always shocks me how Piastri is being overrated by the media. What has he done to be considered a better driver than Gasly/Ocon for example? Even the worst version of Hamilton is still better than current Piastri. \n\nData shows that most of the drivers reach their peak quali pace in their 2nd season and Piastri didn't show anything special. If he doesn't magically improve this year then it's fair to say that he is not a wdc level driver."", 'Ferrari not being no. 1 is a damn joke', ""Show me a team principal in the world who would rather have Norris-Piastri than Hamilton-Leclerc, and I'll show you a liar"", 'Tsunoda/Hadjar above Gasly/Doohan??? Doohan and Hadjar are difficult to compare but I would argue that Doohan was better in F2, and Gasly wiped the floor with Tsunoda when they were teammates.', ""It makes sense if it's based on Lewis' 2024 form where he had no motivation and such, because he was fucking miserable most of the season. \n\nBut it's Lewis Hamilton we are talking about and full on motivated Lewis is one of the GOATs for a reason, so it kinda depends on if he gets it together with a new environment or not."", ""Norris / Piastri have an advantage as both drivers have had their seats for multiple years and comfortable with the team, while Hamilton at Ferrari is an unknown as we don't know yet how well he'll settle in and how much he can maximise the package. That and Hamilton's fluctuating form last year impacts his rating this year.\n\nThat said, I don't think there's much in it between Leclerc and Norris.  Both are excellent qualifiers,  have good race pace but I think Leclerc has a slightly more robust mentality.\n\nOscar vs Hamilton though?  Harder to call based on not knowing what Hamilton we will get.  A motivated Hamilton in a car he is comfortable in is a fearsome prospect that will be very hard to beat, while if he has a repeat of last season, then it will be a lot closer between the two."", 'Agree.
