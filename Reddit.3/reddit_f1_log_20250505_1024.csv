Because, of course, the two of you worked very well together in Jeddah, sitting in position. But did it feel like there was a big difference to that?\n\n>AA: Um, not a big difference, no. But I think we were just quicker in different parts of the race. I think the first three laps, Carlos was quicker than me‚Äîhe got past me. I thought I had damage from Turn 3, and I was kind of a little bit in limbo about what was going on with the car. I kind of got into a rhythm, and then I think Carlos used up his tyres, and I knew I had pace.\n\n>We were under threat from the Ferraris behind us, and I just wanted to get on with it. I knew I could catch up to Mark in front of him, and once I got past, I could settle into my own race. So I think Carlos and I were very evenly matched‚Äîwe‚Äôre just quicker in different parts of the race. Jeddah, we worked well together.

Now a Netflix scene featuring team boss Christian Horner is further escalating the dispute between the title contenders.**\n\n> The Miami sprint has further heightened Red Bull\'s concerns that McLaren holds a potentially decisive championship-deciding trump card. The one-two finish by Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri and the simultaneous zero lap by Max Verstappen are one thing. But what happened in the first ten laps is much more worrying.\n\n> Verstappen was still able to keep a reasonable distance from the two McLaren drivers until lap six. Then, as if by magic, the two Papaya racing cars disappeared over the horizon. This happened precisely at the moment the track began to dry out and the intermediate tires became increasingly hot.\n\n> Who had the best control over tire temperatures? McLaren, of course. And that makes the mystery surrounding the MCL39 even greater. Red Bull has been trying to get to the bottom of the mystery since the start of the season, bombarding the FIA \u200b\u200bwith questions about what is and isn\'t allowed. This is a desperate attempt to draw conclusions from the association\'s answers.\n\n> **Netflix scene causes trouble.**\nBased on thermal imaging camera images, Red Bull has virtually black on white that the McLaren\'s brake linings stay cooler on the outside than on any other car. And that naturally affects tire temperatures. McLaren clearly has absolute control over this. And that could be the match winner, both for a single lap and for the entire race. Because the tires don\'t overheat and therefore don\'t lose grip.\n\n> Red Bull is convinced that it\'s impossible to cool its tires with air alone. Last year, suspicions arose that McLaren was filling its tires with small amounts of water. And this is precisely what\'s now causing McLaren CEO Zak Brown\'s displeasure.\n\n> The American was annoyed by a scene in a Netflix documentary series in which his Red Bull colleague Christian Horner mentioned in a conversation that they had evidence of water in the McLaren\'s tires. Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\n> **Protest fee must hurt.**\nThe McLaren boss is now calling on Red Bull to file an official protest. If, as claimed, they have evidence, it must be brought to light. So that the matter is settled once and for all. Brown suggests that the FIA \u200b\u200bshould set a precedent. ""The protest fee should be high enough that a team will carefully consider whether to actually file an appeal.""\n\n> Depending on the severity of the allegation, the fee should be between ¬£25,000 and ¬£50,000, and this amount should be part of the capped budget. The plaintiff then thinks twice about whether to denounce another team without sufficient evidence or develop a new front wing with the money. Brown considers the allegation untenable from a technical perspective: ""Water in the tires would mean additional weight, and tire pressures would skyrocket during warm-up.""\n\n> The FIA \u200b\u200balso considers the activism against McLaren to be excessive. Since the first rumors of the water theory circulated at the 2024 Brazilian GP, \u200b\u200bFIA technicians have double- and triple-checked the McLaren in the areas in question. There have never been any complaints. Of course, the brake linings and what\'s hidden inside are also in focus.\n\n> The regulations set clear limits on the exterior design. Under the hood, there\'s freedom with the airflow and materials. Cooling elements or heat exchangers in the wheel carrier area are prohibited. In the gallery, we show you the different solutions on the cars of the top teams.\n\n> Apparently, McLaren has somehow managed to separate the air so that the brakes (hot) and tires (cold) remain within the desired temperature range. The fact that McLaren is doing something different from the competition is also evident in the behavior of the mechanics. During certain work on the car, they form a wall in front of the car, thus forming a screen against curious photographers.', 'There is something insane with the Mclaren once the track is drying, same last year and they suddenly just pull a 20s gap after being on the same pace as other cars prior, both cases, Australia this year, it got negated by a safety car.', '> Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\nIts cool to see a traditional team like McLaren back on top in F1 but holy fucking shit the team would be so much easier to root for if Brown would talk less. I want Horner vs Toto back that was way more fun.', ""I don't get why teams take it so personally when other teams think they might be doing something. \n\nAt the end of the day every team has a right to question other teams and maybe protest if they want. \n\nIf you've nothing to hide then who cares about a protest"", '>Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\nDidn\'t McLaren spend years protesting RBR and Merc? Protesting and shit throwing is nothing new in F1, Brown should know that better than anyone.\n\n>\n\n>\xa0""The protest fee should be high enough that a team will carefully consider whether to actually file an appeal.""\n\nAnd this is so backwards thinking, McLaren should be investigated just for saying this. That will just allow teams to cheat, and others would be too scared to protest. His orange friend from the visit last year holds the same beliefs.', 'I‚Äôm not going to lie, I want to see what a full on fight between Zak and Horny would look like across a full season lmao \n\nI liked the Toto v Horner, but we can‚Äôt wait forever for Merc to finally catch up and actually challenge CONSISTENTLY (I said this for the people that are going to come and talk about good results) for championships and wins, so this is the best alternative', 'If its not true, why care so much to respond almost angry like this and wanting to raise prices of protests? Why wanting to create a situation where smaller teams can not afford to protest while hoping bigger teams get pushed off from doing it to save money? \n\nAt the same time, if you have nothing to hide, why get angry? Just let them try and waste their time and effort right? It kinda creates the idea you have something to hide. \n\nThey did find something, that is clear. Could be they are nervous that a protest could expose the legal thing they found for everyone to copy?', ""Don't hate the player, hate the game. This guy seems to forget the Ron Dennis' McLaren days."", 'Look it‚Äôs no secret McLaren have come up with something as evidenced by the drivers statements that they can‚Äôt fire the tyres up in cool conditions. \n\nThe question is whether it‚Äôs legal or not and it‚Äôs hidden within the duct so no one will be able to tell adequately.

Issue #1 - Cutting away at critical moments.
China - Max vs Norris pit exit they cut away to show Leclerc's regular pit stop.
Bahrain - Instead of showwing Piastri crossing the finish line in 1st they showed Norris and Russel who weren't fighting that close.
Miami - Max vs Norris on lap 16 cutting to a replay of the previous overtake.
(So many more examples)

Issue #2 - The timing board not showing the intervals or just not working at all.

Personally, I think comparing it to Sochi or Valencia is a bit over the top. Today‚Äôs race was pretty solid, especially the first 20 laps with Max going at it with the McLarens. There was genuine tension and some real overtaking opportunities across the track.

That said, I still have gripes. The chicane under the bridge is awful, clumsy and out of place and I really wish there was some grass or gravel to punish mistakes. The ever-present concrete runoff strips the track of consequences and character.

In Miami the SF-25 was fifth force on the track, slipping even behind Williams, with only small flashes of light with the Sprint Qualifyng of Charles Leclerc (however with a 3 tenths gap) and above all the Sprint Race with the strategy call of Lewis Hamilton. It was certainly the worst performance offered by the Rossa in this championship, which will arrive at Imola with its world championship dreams already compromised and a very deficient car. Frederic Vasseur in the post-race analysed the Ferrari race from pure performance, to problems, to driver management and the near future. \n\n**Vasseur: \'We have to solve the problems in Qualifying. McLaren in race on another planet. Right strategy, we followed our whole rulebook"".**\n\nThe race reads 57 in 57 laps for Ferrari compared to McLaren and this testifies to a very tough time, with a poor performance. ‚ÄòMcLaren was definitely on another planet, our performance was similar to that of Red Bull and Mercedes‚Äô commented Team Principal, Frederic Vasseur ‚ÄòMax tried to stay with them but he totally ruined his tyres‚Äô. The Frenchman was asked again about the famous potential of the SF-25 that has been talked about so much, but he has a different idea for this weekend. ""We didn\'t find the best balance. Yesterday we struggled a lot and our best lap in Qualifying came on used tyres; it\'s the first time this has happened in 2 years. This is frustrating. We have to work and fix our problems, one by one, and improve.""\n\nThe pace of the Rossa was significantly lower than that of the MCL39, as mentioned, but Vasseur\'s main focus is on the exploitation of the tyres to make the car run at its best. ""It\'s much more a question of the tyres than the characteristics of the car. At times we were able to extract much more potential from the tyres than this weekend, and from that comes the performance."" Going into the substance of the race, given the lacklustre pace and the fifth force on track - with one Williams in front and the other just behind the two SF-25s - the focus was on the drivers\' team radios and Ferrari\'s race strategy. ""We were the only team to swap on track today, but I think it was the right choice. Lewis had a softer tyre and we wanted to try to catch Antonelli. We followed our internal rules. When we saw that he could not catch Antonelli, we did the swap again,‚Äò said Vasseur, who defended the team\'s choice. ‚ÄôIt is never easy to ask drivers to give up their position, but they obeyed and I think it was the best choice.\n\nNow there will be a week\'s break and then Formula 1 will return to Europe, with the first of the two Italian races, and Ferrari will have to try to redeem itself at Imola, where Frederic Vasseur is convinced we will see a better SF-25. Will it also be supported by developments? ‚ÄòWe will have something to take a small step forward and then there will be another step in Barcelona,‚Äô he told Sky Sport F1\'s post-race microphones, but the focus should not be on developments. ‚ÄòWe have to find the best compromise with the car and put everything together.‚Äô']",94,46,0.93,94,44,44,4,0,0.010000000000000009,4

1key7fh,Only 6 times between their return in 2010 and today have Mercedes had as big a margin over the next non Mercedes car as McLaren did today.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1key7fh/only_6_times_between_their_return_in_2010_and/,2025-05-05, Statistics,"McLaren's lead car finished 37.644 seconds ahead of the next non-McLaren car today.

Only 6 times in the most dominant period the sport has ever seen did Mercedes have as big a gap as this at the end of a race,

Spain 2014, Brazil 2014, Spain 2015, Canada 2015, Belgium 2015 and China 2016.

And in all of these races Mercedes were on pole and led going into the first corner other than China 2016 where Ricciardo led into first corner but got a puncture a couple of laps later.

The McLaren's were 3rd and 6th after lap 1 today and still pulled this gap. ","[""That's because they didn't want the FIA to find out how strong their engine was.\n\nMercedes pulled 24 seconds in ten laps in Bahrain 2014 while fighting around every corner, including 4.6 seconds in the very first lap after the safety car restart. They could have lapped the entire field every week if they wanted to.\n\nThis was a huge victory for McLaren but that Merc was something we might never see again."", 'A little side note: Mercedes had the engine turned down for the majority of 2014. Especially at the start of the season. They actually thought they would lap the field if they didn‚Äôt turn it down. Which isn‚Äôt a crazy thought considering how much better the engine was than Renault and Ferrari.', 'This is so hard to determine though because most dominant teams build a gap and then cruise to the finish. Turning down the engine and just managing the race comfortably. \n\nLook at Bahrain 2014 as an example of just what Mercedes were capable of when they really wanted to. After that late race safety car Hamilton and Rosberg were battling each other fiercely costing each other time and yet they were still pulling out seconds per lap over the 3rd placed car. \n\nOr look at 2021. Hamilton and Verstappen pushed each other all the way and so they were often 1-2 and close together but some 30-40 seconds ahead of their team mates who would be 3rd. This shows just how much they would keep in reserve during their dominant eras and how much they could have crushed the field if they really wanted to push all the way when there wasn‚Äôt another driver/team to fight with. \n\nSo ultimately this stat is meaningless because we never see the best of what dominant teams/cars are capable of because they keep it hidden unless someone comes along to push them into revealing their true pace.', 'Thanks for updating this stat. The fact that Max is in contention at all given how 2014/2015 Merc were compared to the rest of the field is incredible', ""McL was dominant today but still not the most dominant we have seen in this period. It's pretty important that they both had to push because they were racing each other and not managing the race comfortably, and the race had no SC/Red flag to close the gaps unlike others, while the VSC gave them 5-10s of racetime to their nearest competitor (VER), who was compromised by RUS a bit at the end as well. Still a scary display, but Merc's equivalent was ridiculous."", 'I have not seen Lando and Piastri fight wheel to wheel. The mercs in 2014 to 2016 were fighting every possible corner.', 'Ah shit, here we go again with those posts', 'One team winning %90 of the races is not a fun watch. Couple this with %70 street circuits and you have a snooze fest for the year. Quali is the most exciting part of the weekend sadly.', ""Like others have said, this is very misleading stat that doesn't add context. Mercedes were extraordinary sandbaggers during this era. They were so dominant they had to hide their dominance for fear of being nerfed by the FIA.  Mercedes was only ever really threatened one time the whole era and that was the very last year because Honda decided to go all out.""]",80,52,0.85,80,47,47,4,3,0.010000000000000009,4

Maybe Lewis‚Äôs tires would‚Äôve been slightly better if he‚Äôd gotten ahead earlier but 2 extra laps of dirty air shouldn‚Äôt ruin your tires to the extent people are making out. The Ferrari‚Äôs mediums are actually very good at recovering from dirty air and gaining pace, see Charles in Bahrain or even Charles‚Äôs pace in Miami after he was following the two williams closely the whole stint but gained pace once they pitted.\n\nRight after the pits, Lewis on two lap old mediums was significantly faster than Charles on one lap old hards.

However I do think saying the success of Red Bull in the ground effect era is due to Newey is very overstated. I think Rob Marshall was the key to the RB18‚Äôs and especially the RB19‚Äôs success. Red Bull‚Äôs first upgrade package after Marshall left Red Bull late May 2023 was I think the first upgrade where they claimed they made a misstep. Furthermore, Marshall‚Äôs new team is McLaren. After gardening leave he got to work on the MCL38. The first upgrade package was the Miami upgrade. The race which Lando won, and the first race where McLaren made arguably the quickest car. His first full fledged McLaren is this year‚Äôs MCL39. While it‚Äôs no RB19, it‚Äôs eerily similar in high deg tracks. Newey was famous for the suspension design of the RB18, but I think the aerodynamic prowess of especially the RB19 was due to Marshall. ","['Adrian Newey was in F1 when MSC was smashing everyone with Ferrari. He was also in F1 when RBR got smashed by everyone all the time.

No.\n\n\nCase that Newey wasn\'t the only great man at Red Bull? Absolutely.\n\n\nThere have probably been other great people over the years. But just for one moment people might know. When McLaren realized in front of the DTS cameras they\'d had a terrible miscommunication so the Honda engine didn\'t actually bolt to the chassis correctly.\n\n\nIt wouldn\'t matter if Newey was a total wizard, if he didn\'t have a support staff who could translate that to reality. And I\'m sure in many case, take his general input, and actually iron out the details.\n\n\nIf Marshall has been the magic at McLaren. Zak did a lot to make the team ready to take advantage of it. New facilities, great people, seemingly a good atmosphere. It means a lot.\n\n\nThe old quote that goes something like, ""The more preparation I do, the luckier I seem to be"".\xa0', ""I don't think the two ideas explored here (Rob Marshall was/is a core component of Red Bull's success in the GE era and Adrian Newey is the Maestro who made RBR tick) are mutually exclusive, nor do I think we can weigh the two against each other per se.\n\nNewey has talked repeatedly about how he views himself as leading a team of engineers and designers while still very much being *the*  architect of the cars he's in charge of. Rob Marshall being the chief of car design and implementer of his vision (which I think is the opening anecdote of Newey's memoir) can easily fit the vision of both of them being integral to Red Bull's run of dominance. \n\nI'd also say that the real way to test this would be to see Red Bull having a prolonged run with Newey but without Marshall, and we just don't have that data. The reporting on the Christian Horner sex-pest fallout makes it very clear that Newey was checked out at Red Bull for sometime before the announcement (at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix, which is your inflection point for Marshall at McLaren) that he was leaving Red Bull and that Red Bull technical leadership had been shifting for sometime to the rest of the team.\n\nTo put it differently, I think there's a very strong case to be made that Rob Marshall is an elite designer in the Ground Effect Era, but that's not zero-sum with Adrian Newey not being elite and it's going to be incredibly hard to disentangle the effects (hah) of Marshall from Newey at Red Bull. The best way to test this is to see how next year's Aston Martin (which should be a Newey product) compares to its McLaren competitor, and how they develop from there."", 'Newey might not be the miracle worker some think (watch Aston Martin become championship contenders next year) but the guy still left an huge impact on red bull', 'Shut your dirty mouth. *covers ears*\n\n\nI need Aston Martin to win next season.\xa0', 'I‚Äôve always thought that.

He is one part of the equation for sure. Without the flexi wings, I think McLaren would have scored fewer points last season and possibly this season.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli misses pole position by 67 thousandths of a second, leaving teammate George Russell in the dust. Ferrari is nowhere to be seen. Even experts struggled to explain the qualifying result in Miami.**\n\n> McLaren is dreading a fast qualifying lap. The slightest mistake is enough to lose pole position. For the third time after Suzuka and Jeddah, Max Verstappen is taking advantage of this. In the first two cases, it could have been attributed to the track layout. Suzuka and Jeddah feature mainly fast, flowing corners.\n\n> The Miami Autodrome is different. Only the first sector is Red Bull territory. The rest is almost exclusively made up of tight corners that require a lot of maneuvering. Not exactly Red Bull\'s specialty. Until Q2, things were fine. Verstappen pulled away from everyone in the first sector. The McLarens made up the deficit in the other two sections.\n\n> Only in Q3 was everything different. For the first time, Verstappen lost less time in the second half of the track than he gained at the beginning of the lap. There were three reasons for this. Verstappen managed a nearly perfect lap, apart from a small wobble in Turn 1. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri made too many mistakes.\n\n> **Unusual result.**\nFinal fine-tuning of Red Bull\'s setup minimized the damage in the slow corners. But the most important factor was the track temperature, which had dropped from 44 to 38 degrees Celsius by the end of the session. McLaren couldn\'t exploit its strength of keeping the tires in the window throughout the entire lap as much as it had in Q2. The opposition suffered less, however.\n\n> With the minimal gaps in the field, the condition of the tires determines the lap time. Small things have a big impact. If the tire is too cold or too hot, it provokes mistakes. Verstappen, Piastri, and Antonelli in the first corner. Russell, Norris, and Hamilton in the hairpin at the end of the straight. When, like Andrea Kimi Antonelli, they\'re only 0.067 seconds behind the fastest time, it\'s doubly frustrating. ""I was too greedy in the first corner.""\n\n> At least it was enough for the rookie to once again win the team battle at Mercedes. George Russell only started from P5: ""Qualifying has actually been my strength this season. But whatever has worked so well so far isn\'t working here in Miami. Kimi did a great job. He drives a little differently than I do. This obviously puts the tires in a better window. I didn\'t find confidence. It went from one extreme to the other. It was the worst qualifying of the year. In the end, fifth place ‚Äì it could have been even worse.""\n\n> **Are used tires faster than fresh ones?**\nSometimes things get really complicated, as in the case of Ferrari. ""We were faster on used tires than on new ones,"" puzzled team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur. Lewis Hamilton saw things somewhat differently. He would have liked to have had two new Pirellis in the Q2 session instead of just on the second run. ""If we\'re already having trouble getting into Q3, it would probably be better to try it twice with fresh tires. We\'ll have to discuss that again.""\n\n> Charles Leclerc couldn\'t pull himself out of the fire in eighth place either: ""Something was strange today. We need to analyze it. I was completely outside the window of the car. From Q1 to Q3, we had to make a lot of changes. That\'s unusual. But it never felt good. It hurts when you\'re doing your best and your best in a Ferrari is only P8.""\n\n> The Monegasque lost four of the seven tenths to the opposition in the first corner alone. The Monegasque set the fastest time in the final sector. This isn\'t the first time Ferrari has struggled with this problem. ""We also gave away three tenths in the first corner in Jeddah,"" Vasseur reveals.\n\n> This clearly indicates that the tires are heating up too slowly. In qualifying, this is a killer. In the race, it can be a wildcard because it reduces tire wear over the distance. Then a Ferrari is almost as good as a McLaren. The difference is that the Papaya races can do both: fire up the tires quickly and keep them alive over the distance.', 'Why don‚Äôt they have a tire that‚Äôs somewhere between the intermediate and wet, or even a hard/soft intermediate. I feel the full wet is worthless, unless it‚Äôs quasi-undriveable conditions.', 'What was Lewis talking about two set of new tyres for Q2 for him to get through? He took two new sets in Q1, and you need to keep one set of new soft for Q3 or if you don‚Äôt get to Q3 it will be for the race, so he only has one new set for Q2. He doesn‚Äôt have two new sets for Q2. Or he is implying the team should only use 1 set of new in Q1 but it risks him not getting through Q1‚Ä¶', ""The inter is just an incredible tyre. There's no need for a tyre in-between the wet and inter because the inter can cope with a wide variety of conditions already. \n\nThe wet is just super slow. The inter is multiple seconds a lap faster."", 'They should have only 1 wet weather tyre. WEC for example only has a ""full wet"" equivalent and it works perfectly fine.\n\nSave money, avoid wastes, make it really hard to simply race a wet tyre into a dry track so that strategy and driver\'s abilities are even more important.', 'BRING BACK THE GROOVES!\n\nBut only as a special inter-intermediate compound!', ""I think he meant that if you're unsure if you're going through to q3, it's better to use two new sets in q2 to make it through, instead of saving one set but then not making it through. If you need to, you can do q3 on the used sets"", 'Exactly, the irony us that Pirelli designed a very great tyre with the inters meanwhile the full wets having such a narrow window between too dry to use and too wet to race for the cars that it only works on a flat track and when the race has been started.', ""Yeah. Realistically we just scrap the wet tire. \n\nCall the intermediate wet. They won't run in conditions that a wet tire will be the choice. It looked like it in Brazil last year.

It seems nowadays (maybe because of social media) that the young guns like Kimi Antonelli and Piastri had a lot of buzz around them when they were starting out.

Was it the same for Lewis when he started out? Was he considered some generational type of prospect? He seemed pretty competitive his first year and I believe won a WDC in his second year with McLaren.

I am in Munich right now, and was wondering how to watch F1. The internet suggested me to go to Killian Irish Pub (I am no sponsored by them), the environment is very vibrant. I have been to a couple Irish pubs for football matches when I was in US, but did not get a chance to meet a lot of fans of my team.

This time for the Miami Race, I met this Australian guy, who was cheering on for Oscar since the beginning of the race, and made it a festival as Oscar overtook Max. He bought a bunch of drinks too.

Apparently his kid used to race with Oscar back in the day. A bunch of us from different nations, randomly started chatting with him and got to know more about him, and basically had a lot of fun. I barely at my phone as I was mostly was either chatting or listening to the stories through out the race, and missed how Ferrari screwed the strategy yet again. And there was one Polish guy among the group, I think who does the drink I got (Heineken) and suggested me a great beer. 

I guess what I want to ask is, you guys have any such stories with you. I bet back in the no internet days, you had more time most of us had the time to talk to people. Have you had any such fun stories? Met random guys who can rally the people and make it a joyful occasion?

1kex0hm,Should Ferrari have swapped the cars earlier?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kex0hm/should_ferrari_have_swapped_the_cars_earlier/,2025-05-04, Discussion,"I feel like a lot of the discussion around this topic is being heavily influenced by Sky sports coverage and Lewis‚Äôs radios. But from my perspective, it‚Äôs not as clear cut as it seems

But why didn‚Äôt Ferrari swap them?

First of all i‚Äôve seen some people saying ‚Äòthey kept him behind for 10 laps‚Äô ‚Äòshould‚Äôve swapped before they overtook Sainz‚Äô. So why didn‚Äôt they swap before they overtook Sainz? Lewis just wasn‚Äôt close enough. 

The VSC cut Charles‚Äôs advantage over Lewis and Charles pit a lap later.

Lap 31: Charles is on one lap old hards that are not properly up to temperature, Sainz gets past and Lewis 2.3 behind.

Lewis does gain about a second that lap on Charles, but Charles is now behind the williams and it‚Äôs cold hards vs a lap older mediums, and since Ferrari in particular have faced issues warming up hards, a pace difference is expected

For the next almost lap, the gap lingers around 1.2-1s, but Lewis doesn‚Äôt properly break DRS until the VSC is called.

So between lap 30 and the end of the VSC on lap 34, there was no opportunity and Charles uses the VSC restart to get past Sainz and Lewis comes along with him.

The way the overtake happened meant Lewis was instantly in Charles‚Äôs DRS. Which means he never actually got into Charles DRS on his own. He had one lap where he was much faster but even over the next lap before the VSC, he couldn‚Äôt do much to get into DRS.

But now he‚Äôs in it, seems to have the better tires and better pace. Why didn‚Äôt Ferrari swap them on lap 35? Well, by the back straight, Sainz is in Lewis‚Äôs DRS and Lewis is 0.6 behind Charles at the point where DRS would open. No question that they could not risk a swap then.

What about lap 36? Well back straight, Lewis is almost 0.8 behind and Carlos is still within DRS. No question that they couldn‚Äôt do the swap that lap.

What about lap 37? On this lap, Lewis does manage to lose DRS to Sainz but by the back straight? Again over 7 tenths back with Sainz less than 1.2 back. Still way too risky.

What about lap 38? Starting to look more viable as Sainz fell back a bit in the lap but by the back straight he caught up a bit and it‚Äôs Lewis 0.6 back and Sainz 1.2 behind again. That‚Äôs still a very uncomfortable margin for Ferrari to mess with, considering that Sainz proved that the Williams has the pace to keep a Ferrari behind it. Last thing they want to do is risk losing p8.

What about lap 39? Well that‚Äôs when they finally did swap.
Lewis 0.7 behind at the point where DRS opens and Sainz now over 1.6 behind.

By the start of the pit straight Sainz is 0.9 behind Charles. If that‚Äôs done a lap earlier that‚Äôs 0.5 by the start of the pit straight at least, leaving Charles incredibly vulnerable. 

So I truly don‚Äôt think there was an opportunity to swap the cars before the lap they did it on. They maybe could‚Äôve done it, but it‚Äôs an unnecessary risk. It‚Äôs one thing to tell Charles not to fight if Lewis has the pace to overtake. But this required Charles to slowdown and they did not have enough of a margin behind for that to be comfortable.

I want to add that i‚Äôm not an expert, i‚Äôm just a fan giving my insight and all my information is from youtube live timing not any official source. Also the lap is based on where the leader is so when it‚Äôs lap 36 but i‚Äôm talking about the back straight then the drivers are probably actually on lap 35  ","['This is the debate topic of the week sorted.', 'Imagine being paid to be a strategist and the most obvious scenario wasn‚Äôt planned out. People are questioning the indecision more than the timing.', ""Yes, he was on faster tires and the hard was at that point known to be shit early on. It's just that simple, swap early and swap back if Leclerc reels Ham in again / at the end if the doesn't get Antonelli"", ""Yes Lewis was in the faster tyre at that point. If he doesn't succeed, you can always swap back (he has shown he will let the other driver back, like Hungary with Bottas). \n\nPoor management by Ferrari"", ""Man honestly who give a shit finished 7-8 wooow what a race wtf is this trash can't build a decent car to save their fucking lives"", ""The truth is that Ferrari would've never have caught Antonelli.

Leclerc was always going to have more pace at the end of the race. He finished 1.5 seconds behind Antonelli, without the time lost with the swaps, it‚Äôs very likely that he would have got P6.', 'if Lewis was so much faster than Charles, he should have passed him on the track or at least had a couple of attacks that showed he had the better car']",0,101,0.5,0,83,83,0,7,0.010000000000000009,0

In Suzuka, he qualified P15, moving up three places to P12, still outside of the points.

Bahrain was his first Q3 appearance, starting P10 and moving up to P9 to score 2 points.

Jeddah was his highest qualifying of P8, but he crashed out with Pierre Gasly, registering a DNF.

Finally in Miami, he went out in Q1 for the sprint, clawing up to P6 for three points, while qualifying P10 for the feature race and staying there to score an additional point.

Overall: 3 Q3s, 1 Q2, 1 Q1, with 6 total points. How would you rate his performance? 

Personally I give him a 6.5/10, as there‚Äôs a lot of room for improvement, but he hasn‚Äôt been fully incompetent thus far. ","['Not great.
