A lot of talented drivers have shifted further back in the grid. I'd like to hear opinions on how you rank these teams going into the season. I have them like this..

6. Williams
7. Alpine
8. VCARB
9. Haas
10. Sauber

I think Williams takes a step forward on driver talent alone. Last year was a disappointment for them, but I really feel Sargeant dragged the whole team down. Alpine and VCARB had good momentum, their success will rely heavily on if their new drivers can perform at this level. Haas I just don't believe in and Sauber I see mailing it in as next year is the year.. but Hulk scoring some points and getting them to a few Q3s is entirely possible.

I wouldn't rule out challenging Aston for 5th to be honest (though I don't expect AMR to drop further than 6th unless they have a particular difficult season). \n\nBehind that... I'd expect Williams and Haas to be fighting for 7th, and I'd give the edge to Williams largely on the driver lineup. They maybe be able to challenge for 6th but I'm not totally sold at this stage. \n\nVCARB could surprise but I'd say they're comfortably 9th, with Sauber propping up the bottom of the table in a distant 10th, barring a lucky race where they can profit from chaos and walk away with a healthy points haul while their rivals fail to capitalize (which I would think is very unlikely)."", ""First of all it's 5-10. There's nothing whatsoever to think that Aston are even in the top 5 nevermind a sure place within it. In fact pre-season testing has put them at around the 9th fastest team only just ahead of Sauber. \n\nIt's probably more like\n\n5. Alpine. 6. Williams. 7. Haas. 8. Racing Bulls. 9. Aston Martin. 10. Sauber."", ""I think Aston are further back than they have been, no longer clear 5th.

Whilst pre-season testing isn't a reliable indicator of a team's performance of the coming season, its undeniable that red bull's performance has fallen off since mid 2024. 

My question is how can a team that was so dominant, winning all but 1 race in 2023, be where they are right now, without a change in regulations?

Red bull's internal issues aside (power struggle, hornergate, newey departure) how much of the performance drop can be attributed to reduction of development time & money from finishing 1st for several consecutive seasons + cost cap breach penalty (-10% wind tunnel time) + late grasp of the current regulations by competitors?

In terms of absolute performance, Max was faster at every comparable race (2023 vs 2024) in the latter half of the calendar (Quali times). The smallest gap is 0.285s faster (Italian GP), ballooning to 1.09s faster (Mexico) and 2.7s faster (COTA) neither of which occasions he got pole!\n\nWhat actually happened was that the competition caught and passed Red Bull, which creates the impression of Red Bull falling away.

Red Bull hit their development ceiling before everyone else. If they can gain a tenth of a second on their rivals today, that is a big gain.

Hes amazing and gets the maximum points their cars can get, but his tendency to be able to drive around a cars problems can be problematic. It was already the case in 2019/2020, when they realized Max's skills were making them see things wrongly, and they course corrected in 2021 with a much more stable car.
