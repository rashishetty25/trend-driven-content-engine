**Image 1: Constructor Dominance**

This first graphic shows which constructor was the fastest in each mini-sector of the Silverstone circuit.

* **Red Bull Racing:** Unsurprisingly, they were absolutely dominant on the straights. The dark blue lines show their top-speed advantage on the Hangar and Wellington straights.
* **McLaren:** The papaya orange shows up strong in the high-speed cornering sections, owning large chunks of the Maggotts, Becketts, and Chapel complex.

  
**Image 2: Track Dominance - Piastri vs. Verstappen**

This second graphic drills down into the individual performances of Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen, showing who was faster and where.

* It's a classic trade-off: Verstappen leverages the Red Bull's incredible straight-line speed, while Piastri's McLaren appears to have the edge in cornering performance.

If that movie left you craving for more high-speed drama, legendary rivalries, and behind-the-scenes stories, welcome to the community - you‚Äôre in the right place!

**Link to Megathread for F1 Movie here:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk8rn0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk8rn0/)

So now that you‚Äôve seen *F1*, you might be wondering: *What should I watch next?* To get inspired & motivated or just want to know more about Auto racing sports and what it is about, basically the history and all the reasons why it has the most amazing audience globally!

I started building this list with the idea of rounding up **all the movies directly related to Formula 1**. But then I thought, why stop there? So I added films and docs about Formula 2, Formula E, and other motorsport gems too. And, as it turns out, there actually aren‚Äôt *that* many dramatic feature films that focus solely on F1, most of the really good stuff is in incredible documentaries and behind-the-scenes specials - leaving with only 20 to 30 titles - which is also amazing, but mostly its interview, documentary films..

So, this collection isn‚Äôt just about flashy F1 cars. It‚Äôs a hand-picked mix of movies and docs that truly capture the spirit of **auto racing - the rivalries, the heartbreaks, and the rush of living life at 200 mph.** No filler, no random car cameos just for show, only films and stories that deserve to be here. I tried my best not to just add & fill up movies that just had scenes of luxury looking F1 cars that are mostly in the background.

Got any favorite racing movie that always gets your heart racing? Or a hidden gem that deserves more love? Mine has to be ***Ford v Ferrari or Gran Turismo and later F1 & Rush***!

*Drop your recommendations below if I missed any!*

Also, I do think that more Movies & TV Shows should be made in this genre, because apart from documenting & preserving digitally these events, it would give an exposure to a large set of audience who is not yet aware of the past stories and how the cult following start growing!","['Speed Racer is about 70 spots too low', ""The Netflix Cup because it has the drivers in it even though they are playing golf? I admittedly say as someone who hasn't watched it."", 'really hard to call a 150 item list ""essential""', 'Gran Turismo at number 3 is nuts. It‚Äôs not the worst race movie but it‚Äôs nowhere near the top 3. Especially not ahead of Rush.', 'Didn‚Äôt know there was that many racing films. Fair ply for taking the effort to make this! My favourites will probably always be Cars 1 or Cars 2.

1ls2kgt,Let‚Äôs speculate possible driver changes for next year,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ls2kgt/lets_speculate_possible_driver_changes_for_next/,2025-07-05, Discussion,"So, let‚Äôs assume Max goes to Mercedes. That would be the first piece to fall in a long domino train, in my opinion. What are the possible changes in your opinion?  
  
I believe these are the only logical moves:    
  
Max -> Merc  
Russ -> RB  
Hadjar -> RB  
Limblad -> RacingB  
  
I don‚Äôt see Stroll being asked to leave. We always expect that move but we know it‚Äôs daddy‚Äôs team and won‚Äôt happen.   
  
I believe Audi doesn‚Äôt need to change Hulk/Bortoletto. They are finding their way to the top.   
  
Lando/Oscar: If it‚Äôs not broken don‚Äôt fix it.   
  
Thoughts? What are your theories or scenarios?  
  
Edit to add:  
I don‚Äôt know what the real deal is with Ferrari. Lewis is always sad/disappointed and his engineers screw him over all the time. And Leclerc being anxious he can‚Äôt win a  championship. Not sure if this situation will also trigger more moves. ","['I hope Stroll retires. A Russell-Alonso lineup with all the engineering talent and state of the art facilities that AM has would be a super team. A British driver in arguably the most iconic British brand would be a marketing gem', 'You‚Äôre really going out on a ‚Äúlimblad‚Äù with these speculations.', 'The only sure move for me is Yuki gone from Red Bull and possibly out of F1 altogether.\n\nI think Max and the Merc drivers might stay where they are for 1 more year.', ""The question about Russell is quite interesting because he's repeatedly reiterated not talking to other teams which Horner has repeatedly confirmed. However, we do know that there was some contact between him and Horner in the past (but he turned Horner down).\n\nSince around April, we've repeatedly heard about Toto's intention to re-sign him which has led to some interesting quotes. In an interview around a month ago, George said that 2026 would be his 5th season with Mercedes only to be reminded by the interviewer of the lack of contract. In Austria, Toto said that the talks with Max had no impact on the talks with George, and this weekend, George has repeatedly suggested being teammates with Max and said that Toto never lied to him."", 'Horner uses his power of persuasion to sign both Lando and Oscar to RB leaving Zak dumbfounded and furious.', ""I cannot see GR to RBR happening for the simple reasoning being that you don't replace your outgoing driver with the driver he's replacing. In the eyes of global marketing, that's being the submissive dog picking up the scraps and it's precisely why no big team wanted to sign Carlos even though he was probably in the top 3 of available drivers that year."", 'Stroll seems to be pretty done himself.', 'Max to Merc\nGeorge to RB\nHadjar to RB\n\n\nHorner to Ferrari.\xa0\n\n\nMeaning\xa0\nToto will be TP to Max\nHorner will be TP to Lewis\xa0\n\n\nAnyone remember Abu Dhabi 21?
