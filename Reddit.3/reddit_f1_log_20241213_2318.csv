Red Bull outscored Mercedes by 121 points in the constructors. Checo finished the season on 152 points, meaning so long as he gave a 32 points swing over Mercedes, Red Bull would still outscore Mercedes.

This means  Checo would have had to race Australia (where he scored 10 but didn't affect Mercedes who finished 17 (RUS) and retired (HAM)) and also Japan where he scored 18 points to secure the constructors bronze medal for Red Bull.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.

Edit: To do the math, assuming teams pay their full bonus, McLaren employees got a 20% increase in bonus compared to last year, and Red Bull employees got a 16.67% decrease. Now, teams might not choose to pay this much in bonuses. Individual teams might have goals they have to meet to get their bonuses by their individual employee contracts. Just like teams don't have to spend the whole budget cap in the first place. For instance, it might be in Red Bull's employee's contracts that they have to place top 3 in the WCC or no bonus at all. But they might have something much more lenient. Just like driver contracts, we don't know what are in employee contracts.

Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""

I did not understand how any of this worked until looking up the regulations, and I don't think many people understand how it works either. I did this digging to comment on another post that the poster deleted, but I thought it was interesting and other people might not know, so I wanted to post it anyway.

It seems like an easy compromise, especially if this is played as a ""Checo can mentor the driving academy guys"" and ""he can fight to get his seat back"" narrative.  Does RB really value the development aspects of the CARB team so much they would rather fire Checo from the RB team than give up the seat?","['Ricciardo already did that and see how that went.
