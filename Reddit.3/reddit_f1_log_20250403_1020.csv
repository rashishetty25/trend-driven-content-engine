1jpquoo,[AMuS] Does Cadillac have a wind tunnel advantage?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jpquoo/amus_does_cadillac_have_a_wind_tunnel_advantage/,2025-04-02, News,,"['Translation and full article:\n\n\n> Cadillac has been an official member of the 2026 Formula 1 field since March 7. The US racing team now has eleven months to assemble a team and a car. Does Cadillac benefit from a wind tunnel advantage?\n\n> This Formula 1 project has never had an easy time. What began with Andretti Global\'s application in February 2023 took two years to final approval. During that time, the applicant vacillated between hope and fear. At the beginning of 2024, Formula 1 management mockingly recommended that Andretti try again in 2028.\n\n> By then, the company had already been declared a General Motors factory under the Cadillac flag. But it took Andretti\'s complaint to the U.S. Congress alleging antitrust violations that broke the ice. A face-saving compromise was reached. Suddenly, everyone was thrilled with General Motors\' commitment to Formula 1. On March 7, the FIA \u200b\u200bgave its final blessing.\n\n> The two years underground were not wasted. Since the fall of 2023, an ever-growing group of engineers, model builders, financial experts, and managers have been doing preparatory work for a team and a car scheduled to debut in 2026. For a long time, it was a journey to nowhere, as board member Mario Andretti explains: ""As long as we didn\'t have the commitment, we were only driven by the belief that everything would turn out well. Now everyone knows they\'re working on something that will be on the starting grid in 2026.""\n\n> Audi as a competitor on the labor market. The Cadillac Formula 1 team is spread across four locations. Its headquarters are in Fishers near Indianapolis, where a state-of-the-art race factory is currently being built. At the European branch in Silverstone, engineers are developing the American automaker\'s first Formula 1 car. Their wind tunnel is located at Toyota in Cologne. General Motors\' engine division is located in Charlotte, where it plans to eventually design and build its own Formula 1 engine.\n\n> Since its registration, Cadillac has been subject to the budget cap and all the regulations of the 2026 regulations. Now the rookies also have to pay their $450 million entry fee. One team member says: ""If there\'s no problem anywhere, it\'s with money. We\'re well financed."" The two major investors, Mark Walter and Dan Towriss, are absolute heavyweights with their companies.\n\n> Currently, around 300 people are working on building the team and developing the 2026 car. By the end of the year, the workforce is expected to grow to 650 employees. In theory, Cadillac has a good chance of recruiting new talent. They have plenty of open positions and room for improvement in their budget. But now, with Audi, they suddenly have a competitor on the English job market. The Ingolstadt-based company has opened a technology center just around the corner in Bicester.\n\n> Job advertisements only since the beginning of March. Cadillac\'s technical advisor Pat Symonds warns against underestimating the growth process: ""We were only able to issue detailed job advertisements once our approval was secured at the beginning of March. Before that, we had asked the non-binding question in the advertisements: Would you like to participate in an exciting project?""\n\n> Employees Cadillac recruits from other teams now can\'t start work immediately. Most are on leave until the end of the year. This means they won\'t be available until the next car. The newcomer also doesn\'t have unlimited flexibility within the budget cap. It all depends on how much you want to build yourself or outsource.\n\n> The plan is for Cadillac to do as much as possible itself. But that requires production facilities, know-how, and people. All of this is a time constraint. Unlike Audi, the Americans are essentially starting from scratch. Audi at least found a functioning infrastructure and a well-coordinated team at Sauber in Hinwil. And yet, Formula 1 boss Mattia Binotto has respect for the task: ""The transformation into a top team doesn\'t happen overnight. It takes up to five years.""\n\n> Building the car and integrating new employees is one thing. At least equally challenging are seemingly simple tasks such as logistics, establishing an IT department and a supplier network, liaising between development and production, and purchasing trucks and a motorhome. Cadillac essentially didn\'t get the ball rolling on these until the second week of March.\n\n(1/2)', 'Toyota F1 had the largest budget and most technologically advanced wind tunnel at the time.

1jq3dmz,Equipe Ligier: The Ups and Downs of the first ever French Team to win a Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jq3dmz/equipe_ligier_the_ups_and_downs_of_the_first_ever/,2025-04-02, Throwback,"This story begins with two friends, Guy Ligier and Jo Schlesser, both of them were avid race car drivers who had a dream, the dream od creating their own car brand and sports team, but those dreams seemed to shatter when Jo Schlessee perished on the 1968 French Grand Prix while driving the infamous Honda RA302, which John Surtees deemed a deathtrap, when his car lost control and the magnesium chassis burnt into flames. Guy decided that nothing would stop him from making his and Jo's dream come true, so he created Ligier Automotive, and as a tribute to his late friend, every car the team built had the initial JS as a tribute to his late friend.

Ligier jumped into the thriving world of F1 in 1976, which seemed a risky decision, but he signed a promising driver named Jacques Laffite to take the wheel of their first ever F1 car, the JS5, and also signed an exclusivity deal with Matra, after taking their F1 team assets, things seemed to go on a very good way, they got their first pole at the Italian Grand Prix and they also got three podiums finishing a respectable 6th ppace in the Constructors Championship with 20 points, even though 1977 went a bit more sour, they got their first ever win, and the first for an all French team in F1 history at the Swedish Grand Prix.

1978 was another solid year with podiums but no wins, but there came the ground effect, and with that, their best car, the JS11, they started the season with 2 straight wins of Laffite in Argentina and Brazil, and after signing a second driver in Patrick Depailler, winning the Spanish Grand Prix and leading the championship after Monaco, Ligier was looking to get it all, but Depailler broke his legs in a gliding accident and had to retire from the season. Reliability also killed all chances from getting a championship, as did Depailler replacement, Jacky Ickx, who wasn't able toget the grips on the car. Ligier finished that year 3rd in Constructors, with Laffite 4th and Depailler 6th even after missing half of the season.

By 1980, they signed Didiee Pironi as Ickx's replacement, and even though Laffite didn't like having a teammate, the car was solid and they garnered 2 wins and a 2nd place in Constructors (P.S. by 1979 they swapped to Ford after Matra gave poor results). In 1981 even though Laffite was the only competitive driver, he had a small chance of getting the championship at the last round in Las Vegas, and he ended up just 6 points behind champion Nelson Piquet. 

But suddenly, from 1982 to 1984, Ligier suffered a deep downward dive in performance, going pointless in 1983, only scoring a few podiums in 1982 and also losing their star driver Laffite, but in 1985 the team had new Renault engines that were powerful enough to make that car fight for points and podiums again, and in 1986 everything seemed to be going right into place, Laffite returned in 1985 and Rene Arnoux signed also for them, the duo looked strong and were consistent points and podiums contenders, but in the British GP in Brands Hatch, a massive crash ensued and Laffite broke both of his legs, ending his long career in F1 and leaving Ligier devastated, as they had lost their top driver. From 1987 to 1992 nothing seemed to work on the small French team, their performance was worse and worse as the seasons went on, they even weren't able to qualify in certain races. 

The morale was on the floor, but suddenly, in 1993, they were able to make a car solid enough and with good drivers such as Martin Brundle and Mark Blundell, they were able to finish on the podium a few times, and get enough points to get the team up to 5th in the Constructors Championship, and they were also the best team with a passive suspension that year, compared to the top teams who used an active suspension. 

By 1995, Ligier was able to sign a deal with Mugen Honda as their engine suppliers, but of course, with that came Aguri Suzuki as their driver along with Olivier Panis. During the season Brundle and Suzuki swapped seats for certain races, with Brundle even scoring a podium, the team put another solid season and finished 5th in Constructors again. In 1996, things seemed grim for the team as they were going to shut down after that season, but they were able to leave with a last hurrah with the miraculous win of Olivier Panis on the crazy Monaco GP where he got the first win for Ligier in 15 years, and of course the team's top driver, Jacques Laffite was there for the celebration aswell. At last, they closed the season with a respectable 6th place in the Constructors Championship with 15 points. And so ends the tale of the Equipe Ligier with 9 wins, 50 podiums and 9 poles, a remarkable tale that begun with two friends wanting to create a car brand and ended up with one of the most beloved teams in F1 history.","[""I'm surprised you totally skipped over the whole reunion with Renault that both caused their brief upswing in 1993 and the vulture-like Briatore by-out, as well as the constant failed negotiations with Prost that started as far back as his Ferrari days as those were what really sealed the team's fate. The team's brief spell as a Lambourghini customer was an interesting chapter too."", 'That was a great read mate. Thank you for putting the effort and not just posting a ""here is my Ligier livery if they were in F1"" type stuff.', 'My favorite Ligier story was how the JS11 had way too much downforce from its ground effect that it needed to ""cheat"" with a series of flaps (dubbed the *clapet*, french for ""valve"") in both its venturi tunnels that would open at a certain pressure. The team went to great efforts to hide this that their actions raised the suspicions of Giorgio Piola. Luckily for the latter, a chance to see what was going on opened up when one of the cars crashed at the final race of the 1980 season at Watkins Glen. Back then, the garages were some distance from the pits, so when the car was brought there, Piola ran as fast as he could to snap photos of the venturis before the team, most of whom were coming from trackside, could cover them up with towels. On the way back, Piola saw Ligier designer Gerard Ducarouge and gave a thumbs up at him, indicating that he caught what they were doing. According to Piola, Ducarouge apparently hated his guts after this.\n\nPiola talks about this in this video with Autosport. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zVD34wK-Q', 'I know the cars were built by Ken Tyrrel.

The pits were a no go zone general admission wouldn’t get you in.  \n\nThe track was laid out then that the pits were on Ocean blvd which had several apartment buildings. Residents were inside the track so we entered in the back door of one of the apartments walked up two flights of stairs and out the front door into the pits.. \n\nOther than ticket guys at the pit gate security was non existent, we were literally walking around the pits mingling with the mechanics and drivers. Having been raised by a Porsche racing father and a bonafide pit rat  I knew the do’s and don’ts a of pit lane, be cool don’t get in the way we just walked around looking at the cars watching the prep for the next session even climbed over the pit wall to get a better look, nobody said boo even got some smile from Mario. I was standing in front of one of the Shadows and four feet behind me they fired up the Ligier. That Matra V-12 started and I jumped over the pit wall out of pure fright lol the mechanics were laughing at me  Stupid kid!  Great fun great day, we were sunburnt and tired and hungry..  Stayed the entire day then called mom confessed my sins and waited for her to come with the station wagon and get us.
