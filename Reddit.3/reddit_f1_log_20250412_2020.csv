This has me wondering‚Äîshould Pirelli bring back the 2018-style naming and color convention to improve clarity?

Back in 2018, each compound had its own name and color (e.g., Hypersoft, Ultrasoft, Supersoft...), which made it easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps. Since 2019, Pirelli has simplified this into just ‚ÄúSoft,‚Äù ‚ÄúMedium,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHard‚Äù regardless of which actual compound is selected, but that‚Äôs led to some confusion‚Äîespecially when C2 is called ‚ÄúSoft‚Äù one weekend and C5 gets the same label another.

So with six compounds now in regular use, and possibly staying that way into 2026 and beyond, is it time to revisit or modernize the naming system? Maybe bring back unique names and colors‚Äîor at least tweak the current system to reduce ambiguity?

Curious to hear what others think‚Äîwould reintroducing distinct compound names make things clearer, or is the current format better for casual fans?","[""I liked the rainbow, but I understand why some people didn't. Always sounded cooler when they called it the hypersoft."", 'I liked the pirelli rainbow more than what we have now. but i understand the ease of understanding just Soft - Medium - Hard and using C1-C6 for the more hardcore technical fanbase. \n\nFor someone who has no clue about the details behind the tires. Knowing that Soft goes fast but not far, Hard goes far but less fast. And medium goes in between. Is simple. Instead of having to remember one week, why they are driving on Ultrasoft, supersoft and soft tires. And the next week all of a sudden superhard, hard and medium tires.   \nHaving the same colour scheme across every week also helps distinguishing between what the soft medium or hards are. Instead having to remember this week we have orange which is the hardest, blue which is the medium, and white which is the softest. just for it to be a week later be blue for the hardest, and another race having white as the hardest tire. \n\nAnd using C1-C6 just removes any confusion between it.', "">easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps.\n\nIf everyone's tires are the same 3 compounds in a race, does it really matter?

Pierre Gasly starts fifth in the Bahrain GP and lost only 0.375 seconds to pole position. Despite an engine handcap of three tenths.**\n\n> It‚Äôs a round birthday. Alpine chief renovator Flavio Briatore was 75 years old on the day of qualifying for the Bahrain GP. When Pierre congratulated Gasly in the morning, the eternally young Italian asked: ‚ÄúAnd, what did you bring me as a birthday present?‚Äù Gasly pointed to his right foot. A heavy gas foot should straighten it.\n\n> Alpine had arrived with zero points for the fourth round of the World Championship. The only team was still empty, and the French cars had left a very good impression during the winter test drives in Bahrain. But it seemed to be swept away in Melbourne, Shanghai and Suzuka.\n\n> Briatore stood in front of his troop: ‚ÄúWe were not as bad as we looked. Our problem was that we never got what was theoretically possible out of the softest tire compound.‚Äù This resulted in poor starting positions and correspondingly difficult races. The team did not travel to Bahrain with a single point. This is not the claim that Alpine had before the 2025 Formula 1 season. They wanted to be ‚ÄúBest Of The Rest‚Äù and annoy the top teams McLaren, Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes.\n\n> **Engine costs lap time.**\nThe Renault engine is not a rocket with which you can win places. ‚ÄúWe lose three to four tenths of the drive alone, depending on the route,‚Äù Briatore curses. It‚Äôs the old problem. The engine has to be into charging mode too early on the straights to fill the battery. For Bahrain, the loss according to the simulation is 0.3 seconds.\n\n> And yet, with 1.30.216 minutes, Gasly managed a time that was only 0.375 seconds above Oscar Piastri‚Äôs pole position. ‚ÄúWithout the loss of the engine, we start from the front row,‚Äù Briatore is convinced. Gasly impressed especially in the second sector, where he was practically as fast as the McLaren drivers. It is the sector with the most curves in which time goes flutes. This is shown to the engineers: The car is aerodynamically healthy.\n\n> It could have gone better in the first three races, Briatore is annoyed. The error was that the engineers had tried to compensate for the power deficit elsewhere. For example, with the differential setting. ‚ÄúThe experiments didn‚Äôt help,‚Äù says the master craftsman. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I told the team before the weekend: no more experiments. We‚Äôre driving like in the test.‚Äù\n\n> **Grace period for Doohan.**\nThe Alpine also kept its tyre temperatures in the window for the entire lap. Pierre Gasly and Jack Doohan did not lose a disproportionate amount of time in the last stretch, unlike some competitors. The fact that Gasly also took sixth place in the third training session in shearing heat is a good sign. Even there, the tire temperatures did not shoot through the ceiling.\n\n> Jack Doohan was also on his way to Q3. The Australian came in sixth place through Q1 and had a good chance of getting one lap further even after the first attempt in Q2. But then, in the last attempt, Doohan no longer brought all sectors together optimally. ‚ÄúHe still has to work on that,‚Äù the team said. ‚ÄúJack is fast, but not yet constant.‚Äù According to recent information, despite his two accidents in Melbourne and Japan, he still has a grace period until summer.', 'So basically what they‚Äôre saying is that alpine is probably on pole or p2 if it had a Merc or a Honda pu in it?

1jxpyev,Mercedes has screwed George several times in the past two years and it is not talked about often.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jxpyev/mercedes_has_screwed_george_several_times_in_the/,2025-04-12, Discussion,"With today's grid penalties, I realised that Mercedes in the past two years has screwed up George's performances more often than not.

Some particular instances that instantly come to mind -

1)Britain 2024 - water system issue
2)Spa 2024 - DSQ
3)Brazil 2024 - strategy fuck up and not listening to him
4)Japan 2025 Qualy - same
5)Today, releasing before time.
Some more strategic calls I can remember faintly, where the team didn't bother listening to him.
6) Hungarian GP Qualy 2023

Several pitstops in the past two years I can recall, Mercedes pitstops have never been spectacular but sometimes it feels they need a new pitcrew.

While George himself makes some spectacular mistakes, Mercedes are no better sometimes.","['Is any team not screwing their drivers over?', ""It's fine.

It wasn't even a genuine mistake but just plain failure to adhere to the rules.

Wolff said they couldn't upgrade their equipment because of the cost cap. They did last year and were better, but still not as good as they were.

1jxdtv3,How did McLaren pull off such a good car in so little time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jxdtv3/how_did_mclaren_pull_off_such_a_good_car_in_so/,2025-04-12, Discussion,"Aston Martin and Ferrari haven‚Äôt gotten the top gong for a while.

Aston Martin like McLaren had money issues for a bit, but still McLaren they somehow did the unthinkable and became a top team.

Alpine are just terrible, so are haas and Williams.

It was only a few years ago where McLaren was a tractor at Bahrain.  **Who made McLaren a top team?**","['New Wind Tunnel + Going back to Mercedes engines + Poaching key staff from Red Bull + Zak Brown and Andrea Stella are actually good at their jobs, no matter what people say about them.', 'They switched from Renaults engine to Mercedes, which automatically improved them.\n\nThey hired good people.\n\nTheir wind tunnel and simulator seem to correlate very well with real life.\n\nEasier said than done.', ""McLaren had a pretty healthy upwards trajectory, with some important hires from other teams. \n\nIt's not really fair to look at 1 or 2 races at the start of the season to compare performance. McLaren had a bad car at Bahrein in both '22 and '23, but in '22 they still had a good car (best of the rest), and in '23 they started slow but then were racking up podiums and showed glimpses of (what could become) a race winning car at the end of the season."", 'Williams is improving.', ""getting rid of James Key did wonders for them. Look what Key's doing to the Sauber"", 'McLaren were always a top team, they were just underperforming. Especially during the McHonda years, they ticked every box that made a team a top team - except for results. Credit to Zak Brown for turning a sinking ship around. If they bring home both titles this year then he has done everything right', 'It‚Äôs still McLaren. They had resources, they had backing, they had a driver everyone wanted to nab from them. They had everything to make them a top team again. They avoided the pitfalls of Williams (and to some extent Ferrari) when they restructured the whole organisation and didn‚Äôt allow themselves to be left behind. McLaren had decent infrastructure to be a midfield team but not enough to be a top team again. So they invested in that side a lot. \n\nSeidl said in 2022 that McLaren lacked knowledge, there were gaps in their team that they needed to address. \n\nZak Brown said when he met Seidl his first demand was he wanted the Mercedes engine and he wanted a new wind tunnel. Brown just did whatever the Team Principal wanted, it was his job to go and get the backing and approval from the board to make it happen.  \n\nI guess that structure of just letting the TP get on with running the team instead of worrying what‚Äôs going on above him, works really well for McLaren.\n\nI also think some credit has to go to the drivers. If they didn‚Äôt have such a demanding one, I think they might have been content with being clear leaders of the upper midfield and the odd podium here and there. That kind of ‚Äòpushy‚Äô non-complacent attitude didn‚Äôt let the team rest.', ""IMO Zak Brown doesn't get the recognition he deserves.  \nWhen he took over at McLaren that car was a blank canvas in terms of sponsors. 2 year later and you didn't know where to fit another company logo. Money issues solved.\n\nThey went on to bring on talents and build a team for the long term.  \nCompared to Ferrari that fires every Team Principle that doesn't deliver in 6 months. Or compared to Red Bull and Mercedes who just poach from each other and have a betting game of who can pay more, McLaren brings on long lasting Team members.\n\nThey are now just the boring, stable team. Many people think they don't deserve to be there at the top, but what we see now is the work of the previous 7 years that they continued building that team and solved problems together rather than firing people who struggled."", 'It\'s rarely 1 person that suddenly makes a car perform well.\n\nIt\'s possible multiple unknown names managed to figure out how to extract performance out of the car in their specific area.\n\nWhile usually it\'s a few key people that figure out the actual aerodynamic performance.

Gonna have to build an entire separate car for the race and I‚Äôm not sure how long even the hard tires would be able to last? 

If the racing is anything like the Indy 500 it would be a DRS train for the most part. Which them being in a DRS train going around an oval you would assume would be drastically different than a DRS train going down the straights on a road course.

Lastly standing or a rolling start?","[""Serious answer:\n\nIt would be awful. No regeneration for the ERS, for starters.

The current F1 cars produce a lot of downforce from the floor, plenty enough to run all the corners flat out.
