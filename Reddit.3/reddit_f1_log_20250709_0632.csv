In the past days we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating Hulkenberg's podium.

So in order to properly commemorate this historic event we decided to create a limited edition flair, featuring a limited edition emoji made by u/Blanchimont.   
  
This flair can only be claimed in the next 27 hours. So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance. If you change your flair back after the 27 hours you will not be able to recover the limited edition flair.  
  
To claim this flair all you have to do is to send a comment under this post including the words ""Hulkenpodium"" or ""Hulkengoat"" (and pray that AutoModerator doesn't crash and burn)

Given that he mentioned Canada and other sc laps, I think that should have been added.\n\nThe far more interesting (and due to the rule difference only relevant) comparison is to the other sc restart on lap 17, which was quite similar (just slightly earlier on the straight and therefore slightly different acceleration). Arguably, that caused more trouble for the mid-pack. Supposedly, that was already [seen ](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/the-data-that-doomed-oscar-piastri-and-why-his-defence-fails/)by race control as a potential problem, but they didn't ultimately refer it to the stewards that time."", 'Piastri got unlucky with the timing here but even if he didn’t get a penalty I do think this kind of driving shouldn’t be allowed in future races.

The fact that many people are on different side of the fence regarding this penalty means it deserves to be looked at"", 'Idk seems like a lot of excuses for suddenly dropping from 218 to 52 kph in those low visibility conditions, while effectively acting as safety car since the lights went out.\n\nI think if Max did such a sudden slow, he would have been absolutely raked over the coals by the media for unsportsmanlike brake checking the pack behind him.', 'The F1 manual is 2"" thick but is printed with dark grey ink on light grey paper. \nYou\'ll often hear commentators and fans say, ""the rules are clearcut,"" but practically every race there is a rules and interpretation discussion. \nPalmer is on the money with so much being subjective.

Alonso was in points, so they decided to get Alonso on a more conservative strategy. The only bad thing about the inter-to-slick pit was that it was too soon, they should have pitted Alonso two or three laps later, but at the same time it was time to take some risks with Alonso as he could be out of the points.\n\nI see it more as a stroke of good luck for Stroll than Alonso being unlucky again. I can only wish he could get more of those strokes', 'The biggest problem was that when his inters were dead they pitted Lance instead of him gifting him track position over Alonso making him lose a huge amount of time\n\nNot just that the slick call was way too early', 'For not the first time this season, the lower qualifying positions use a gamble strat and wins big. Haas has done it a few times.\n\nUnfortunate for Alonso, but they’re always going to play it safer for the driver who’s starting in the top 10.', ""Stroll was just in the absolute perfect position to swap onto softs under the second VSC, since they knew he wouldn't lose too much track position (did he even lose any positions?) and would come out ahead of the existing slick runners.

I think frustration at how well that worked out led to the Alonso-onto-mediums gamble, which was just way too early at that point."", 'I love Fernando in F1 but he could be winning in other categories with teams that actually value him.', 'As much as I loved seeing a Hulk podium, I reckon Alonso could have held the P3 much more convincingly to have had the outside podium chance.\n\nWhilst I also get that Stroll\'s strategy was more of a ""fuck it, we\'ve got nothing to lose""; it\'s baffling that they wouldn\'t listen to their lead driver on strategy calls.\n\nIt reminds me of some of Vettel\'s final races; granted the circumstances were a bit different, but the Aston strategy calls when he was the lead car almost appeared to be in favour of getting Stroll a point, instead of consolidating the 8 / 10 / however many points that Seb was running in at the time', 'Got absolutely screwed. Same as when Gasly threw gravel on the track just ahead of him in Australia in low visibility conditions and when his engine expired in Monaco.\xa0', 'Stroll gets ""experimental"" strategies actually more often than people probably realize - he tends to qualify significantly behind Alonso / way too far away from points. It doesn\'t always work, in fact it doesn\'t most of the time but when it does it yields some very good results. \n\nFor Alonso, the big problem is, I noticed, is that the team is just very slow to react. Undercuts almost never happen, Alonso is often left out 2-3 laps longer than he should be, the tyre dropoff is also brutal on the aston which makes things much worse.', 'Alonso was basically given the same strategy as the frontrunners staying out and then pitting for fresh inters on lap 11 which most of the grid did. Hulkenberg was the first driver to pit for inters on lap 9, then Stroll and Hadjar both pit for inters on lap 10, before everyone else followed on lap 11. \n\nAt the time Alonso was up in P6 only behind both McLarens, Verstappen, Hamilton, and Gasly. I think Stroll had a lot less to lose being further back so he pit first for softs on lap 7 during the VSC, a very bold call that no one else on the grid did.\n\nSo I agree with you that Alonso was more so unlucky that he lost out because Aston Martin were playing it safe as he was already high up in P6, whereas they gambled with Stroll and actually benefited massively. \n\nBut they later also took a gamble with Alonso as he was the first car to pit from the second set of inters and switch to slicks on the mediums, which turned out to be several laps too early. \n\nOverall Alonso was just unlucky when it came to the strategy calls.

**Sprints are not included.**

**Race Head-to-Head:** Only includes races where both drivers finished. If a driver completed enough of the race to be classified but retired due to a crash or mechanical issue, that is treated as a DNF.

**Qualifying Head-to-Head:** Only includes qualifying sessions in which both drivers set a valid qualifying time. If a driver didn’t participate in qualifying at all, didn’t set a time, or their time was dropped for a violation of the technical regulations, that weekend wasn’t included and is listed as a DNQ in the table.

**Qualifying Time Differential:** Uses the time from the last qualifying session in which both drivers participated. For example, if one driver made it to Q2 and the other was knocked out in Q1, the Q1 time is used for both.

**Use of Average (Mean) for Qualifying Gap to Teammate:** Because the chart for qualifying gaps uses an average, some drivers were helped or hurt by a single bad qualifying session. The two most extreme examples in each direction are:

* Oscar Piastri crashed during Q3 of the 2023 Canadian GP due to weather, which meant that his lap for that session was 3.303 seconds slower than Lando Norris. If that qualifying session was dropped, he would only be 0.174 slower than Norris instead of 0.434.
*  Pierre Gasly’s teammate Brendon Hartley set a time that was 12.858 seconds slower during Q1 of the 2018 Azerbaijan GP.

Maybe not worldclass, but solid midfielders at least.\n\nThe car is the problem.', 'Max is a superb driver. He can extract a lot from a good car. The Red Bull is a good car, just needs a lot to unlock it. \n\nThe McLaren is a great car.\n\nPut Max in the Haas or Alpine, he isn’t sticking it on pole around Silverstone I don’t think.', 'Its neither.\n\nThe Red Bull is a fast car, but a difficult to drive fast car. It has a strong front end and can be snappy.\n\nThat is different from a slow car, that is for example very draggy, or has a lot of understeer and has a low total performance potential.\n\nThe Red Bull is fast, but difficult.\n\nAND the second driver they promote are generally not top tier standout drivers. They promote solid, midfielders.', ""The car is notoriously difficult to drive but it is not a backmarker. Putting rookies in that car won't solve its issues. Perez performed well in it in the beginning, then it got worse. \n\nPut Leclerc/Hamilton/Alonso/Russell in the car an they'll perform. Put Hadjar/Antonelli there and you'll ruin another prospective rookie's career."", ""Max is a racing freak but he is not god. You can't drive faster than the car will physically allow you, that is the ultimate pace or maximum potential of the car. The maximum potential of a car is no the same thing as how easy the car to drive or the car response to setup/ track/ weather changes. The car can be extremely fast but extremely sensitive or very easy to drive but lacking in maximum potential. \n\n  \nThat Red Bull car does have some speed to it, but its balance & operating window is so narrow that only Max Verstappen can adapt to it. Max Verstappen and the greatest drivers before him are very good at extracting the last potential of a car, but if the maximum potential of a car is lacking, i doubt he would be able to put it on pole and challenge for race win consistently at all. If you really think Max can drag a 2019 Williams car to challenge for wins then I have a bridge to sell you."", 'I think people tend to undersell the importance of time in the car. Max has been in the RB for almost 10 years, he’s driven it for every iteration as they’ve developed toward the car now. So it’s hard to drive for everyone, but Max hasn’t had to adapt so much. Whereas it must be jarring for other drivers joining the team.\n\nBut also idk 🤷\u200d♂️', 'Redbull seems to have failed to develop the car consistently because for a long time it continued to provide good results in hands of Max. But comparing a car that has 2 wins to Haas or Williams is simply wrong, imo.', 'It’s a Stoner on a Ducati situation. \n\nPeople think of car performance as a smooth line but my theory is it’s more like a pyramid where it’s big steps so if you go a little bit forward you gain a lot of height. \n\nThe car is very fast but it’s also very tricky so if you’re not quite good enough to get into that next plateau of performance you’re a long way back. Easier cars to drive have much smaller steps so more representative of skill but the Red Bull has really big gains. Effectively the car development dropped Perez off a step and no one since has been out in the car who is good enough to get onto the same step as Max.']",0,167,0.48,0,157,157,0,6,-0.020000000000000018,0

1luxkb3,In equal machinery which driver do you think would win at each track?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1luxkb3/in_equal_machinery_which_driver_do_you_think/,2025-07-08, Discussion,"For some reason this thought popped into my mind while I was trying to get to sleep last night.

So I decided to go through each track this morning and who I thought would be most likely to win each race.

This is what I came up with,

Australia - Verstappen - tight with Norris. Albon and Alonso.

China - Russell - Prime Hamilton might win here, but Russell is quite underrated in China imo.

Japan - Verstappen - And it's not even close. 

Bahrain - Leclerc - He is spectacular in Bahrain. Shoutout to Gasly too.

Saudi Arabia - Piastri - This was a really hard one. Verstappen, Piastri, Leclerc and even Russell are all very good here. Piastri just beats Leclerc for me.

Miami - Verstappen - Very hard one to pick. Nobody seems to have always been clean in Miami. 

Imola - Verstappen - Verstappen has basically dropped a 10/10 performance every race he's driven in Imola. 

Monaco - Leclerc has been unlucky in the past  but is rapid around his streets. Shoutout to Ocon.

Spain - Verstappen did have a mad moment this year but it's not for a lack of pace. Prime Lewis might beat him but he was underwhelming this year so Max takes it.

Canada - Verstappen - Russell is good in Montreal, but this is a battle between he three world champions on the grid. Verstappen, Hamilton and Alonso. I'll give Max the edge because he's in his prime and he does not beat his team mates here, he destroys them.

Austria - Verstappen - I really wanted to give this one to Lando but Max's record here is incredible.

Britain - Hamilton - Verstappen and Norris are really good in Silverstone, but I have to pick Hamilton. 

Belgium - Verstappen - He seems to be driving on easy mode every time we come to Spa. Hamilton and Piastri are both very good here too.

Hungary - Hamilton - Lewis has been great here every race since 2017. Verstappen is very good too.

Netherlands - Verstappen - He's won here in 2021-2023 and then got a strong 2nd in 2024. Gasly is also very very good around Zandvoort. Lando and Fernando too.

Italy - Leclerc - Hamilton, Sainz, Leclerc, Russell. A good few very good drivers around Monza. I narrowed it down to Leclerc vs Hamilton. I guess we'll find out who's better this year. I'll go Leclerc (Shoutout to Ricciardo when he was in F1)

Azerbaijan - Leclerc - Perez not being on the grid makes this an easier choice. Leclerc is fabulous around Baku, especially in qualifying.

Singapore - Norris - Lando is fantastic around Singapore and every year he has raced in Singapore he's maximised his performance. 

USA - Verstappen has been incredible here ever since his rookie season. Norris and Hamilton (bar last year) are very good too.

Mexico - Verstappen - Another one of Max's great tracks. In fact Max has won by 12-20 seconds 5 seperate times in Mexico. (Shoutout to Ricciardo again when he was in F1, he was great around here)

Brazil - Verstappen - This is an interesting one. Hamilton used to be great here but he hasn't had a good race in Brazil since 2021. Verstappen is great in Interlagos, Russell is very good too, as are Norris and Sainz. 

Las Vegas - Leclerc - We've only had two races in Vegas so it's hard to choose. Gasly is great in Quali but had terrible race pace in 2023. I'll go with Leclerc as the best overall. His performance in 2023 was fabulous and he was still alright in 2024. 

Qatar - Verstappen - Verstappen and Russell are great around this circuit . Shoutout to Gasly again. Max just pips George for me courtesy of his race here last season.

Abu Dhabi - Verstappen - Leclerc, Hamilton, Verstappen, Sainz, Norris and even Tsunoda Quite a few drivers tend to impress in the final race of the year. Peak Hamilton might win here but as for right now it's between Verstappen and Norris. Max had an incident last year but it wasn't for lack of pace. He also won 4 races in a row from 2020-2023. 

So what do you think? I had a blast writing this and would love to hear your thoughts.","['Hulkenberg of course', 'Equally bad or equally good?', 'On their current form? Max would sweep', 'I’m glad to see so many Hulkenpodium flairs\U0001fae1', 'The obvious answer is Max, but this scenario would give us highly motivated Hamilton and Alonso.', 'I would pick alonso for bahrain and hungary', 'Definitely Stroll', 'Equal cars Verstappen would be the favorite for every track.', 'Max at every track but Monaco. 😢']",0,66,0.43,0,49,49,0,3,0.0,0
