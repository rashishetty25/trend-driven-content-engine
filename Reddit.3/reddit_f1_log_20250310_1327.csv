1j7w9un,[AMuS] Silver Arrow loses test race clearly,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j7w9un/amus_silver_arrow_loses_test_race_clearly/,2025-03-10, News,Translation in comments. ,"['I never trust Mercedes in pre-season', ""Last season, weather conditions influenced the cars' behaviour a lot. We'll see this year, but I wouldn't take the Bahrain testing results as a gospel of truth"", '> Mercedes analyzed the data from the test drives in Bahrain. The engineers found that the McLaren was significantly faster. But not all questions have been answered yet.\n\n> The Groundeffect era has not gone according to plan for Mercedes so far. With the introduction of the current regulations in 2022, the great series of successes ended after eight constructors\' cups in a row. For three years, the factory team searched in vain for a way back to success. George Russell and Lewis Hamilton did manage four victories last season. In the team standings, however, they were defeated by McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull by a relatively clear margin.\n\n> With the new AMG W16, they finally want to attack at the front again. The car has some aggressive changes - for example, the sidepods have ultra-narrow air intakes. On the front suspension, the track rod has been placed behind the wishbone, as was the case with McLaren last year. To do this, the engineers tested two new noses in Bahrain, which were used alternately. However, the team kept a secret how the two variants affect the handling and which nose will be used in Melbourne.\n\n> In general, the technicians drew a positive conclusion after the three days of testing. There were no concerns about reliability. The new W16 rolled around the desert circuit like clockwork. Only in the last morning session did the Silver Arrow suffer a small hiccup. A battery change meant that almost an hour was lost in the pits. Afterwards, it turned out that the change had not been necessary at all. A small electrical gremlin had led to an error message.\n\n> Otherwise, the engineers carried out the planned program almost completely. Because Mercedes did not hold the usual shakedown in Silverstone this year, it was not necessarily expected that the W16 would even secure the weekly best in the distance classification with 458 laps - just ahead of Haas (457) and Toro Rosso (456).\n\n> Expectations were also basically met in terms of performance. The data collected on the track corresponded to the values \u200b\u200bpreviously calculated in the simulations. The feedback from both drivers was accordingly positive. The engineers also expressed cautious optimism that the new W16 would no longer show the major fluctuations in form of its predecessor, which, depending on the conditions, sometimes drove all opponents into the ground and then lagged hopelessly behind again.\n\n> ""The team worked hard over the winter to improve the weaknesses of the W15. Judging by the first signs, we seem to have made good progress in these areas,"" said chief engineer Andrew Shovlin with satisfaction. In Bahrain, the drivers could not see any major outliers either up or down. The working window seems to have become larger, and the handling a little more stable. However, the temperature fluctuations on the three days in Bahrain were more moderate. It was never as cold as it was in Las Vegas last year or as hot as it was in Budapest. So it is still too early to give the all-clear.\n\n> But even if the internal performance targets have been achieved, that doesn\'t automatically mean that the new Silver Arrow is a World Championship candidate again. Formula 1 is a relative business. If the others develop even better, your own progress is of little use. In this case, McLaren seems to have pulled well ahead of its direct competitors. The Mercedes engineers were shocked to discover that the gap on the long runs was between half a second and a whole second.\n\n> In a direct comparison of the race simulations, George Russell would have finished 20 seconds behind Oscar Piastri, who was driving parallel on the final day. Andrea Kimi Antonelli shared the track with Lando Norris in his test race on the second day. In the end, he was half a minute behind. These are worlds of difference in Formula 1 that are not easy to make up.\n\n> It is only a small consolation that Mercedes was able to keep up with Ferrari and Red Bull in the chasing pack. All three teams hope that the changeable and sometimes very windy conditions in Bahrain were not representative and that the gap will automatically be reduced somewhat.\n\n> Ferrari also used the excuse that the SF-25 was carrying a lot of excess weight because of the many sensors. At Red Bull, the setup was not yet right. In addition, Max Verstappen did not use a comparable racing simulation. So there is still some room for improvement here.\n\n> Mercedes also did not appear to have a perfect set-up during its long runs. The engineers\' aim during the test drives was not to adapt the car to the Bahrain track as best as possible, but to try out as many settings as possible with a view to the rest of the season. In order to gain experience, they also went in extreme setup directions, which did not always lead to a positive result. The question is how close McLaren was to the ideal performance. The pursuers should not assume that the papaya racer has already reached its best form.', 'His big a lead do we think Lando could build by the time the flexi regulation changes hit?\n\nCould be like last season but with max and co chasing Lando’s early lead down?', ""It was never realistic to expect them to fight the top 3 even with alot of positive changes. It's been a recurring theme now over the last 3 seasons that Merc don't know why their car isn't up there, and when it is up there, they don't know why it is up there. Like they know the 2024. car liked cold weather, but why exactly did it like cold weather so much it was useless without it remains a mystery and it seems like it's still the case for this year's car.\n\nThough it would be idiotic to take testing times for granted, or even other team's statements. Everyone likes to play underdog, everyone kind of writing off Ferrari already and saying it's McLaren's championship to lose, but Ferrari haven't really commented on the matter, just said it's all going in the right direction on all fronts.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.
