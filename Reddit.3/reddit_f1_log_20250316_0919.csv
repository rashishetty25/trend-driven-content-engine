There‚Äôs no way all his past teammates are this bad. Gasly, Albon, Perez, Lawson all over 6 tenths or more slower than Max in the same car. Hell, Perez was closer in the 2020 RP than he was in 2021 RB, meaning RP was probably the 2nd quickest car in 2020, but Max is just an alien.

It‚Äôs very early; but Albon will probably be at least equal or very very close to Sainz. Obvs it his first quali session, but rarely did drivers close such a deficit over a season and then gain it on top. 

I‚Äôm genuinely starting to think Max might have spoken the truth when he said in 2020 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 2 tenths faster than anyone else‚Äù.  And that ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù included the likes of prime or at least very close to prime Hamilton.

I haven‚Äôt seen this level of domination since Schumacher in the 90‚Äôs. Just levels above everyone. That generation was also made to look bad by him, because great drivers like Barrichello or Irvine who beat almost all of their other teammates, including legends of the 80‚Äôs but also future talents(hell, old Rubens was matching a prime Jensen Button; who wasn‚Äôt that far off Lewis) were absolutely demolished by Schumacher. And the media couldn‚Äôt accept Schumacher was that much better than everyone else, so the entire generation was just deemed weak.

I think Max at this point has the same effect, however this generation is more proven because we‚Äôll have direct comparison between Leclerc-Vettel, Norris-Ricciardo, Russell-Lewis,  Leclerc-Lewis, Albon-Sainz etc.

","[""Probably a mix of both. Max is an all time great calibre of driver but also the car is very difficult to find a balance with that gives the driver confidence. Max can live with that, his teammates haven't been able to and it widens the gap between them.\n\nIf the car was more compliant his teammates would be closer.

There's no way that he is that bad in the car, I've never seen him doing similar things in RB. I'm pretty sure the car is pretty much undrivable for everyone except for Max. \nThat said, Max is a beast and he would probably beat everyone as his teammate even with an easier car to drive."", 'No doubt Max is one of the most talented out there, but Lawson‚Äôs session wasn‚Äôt reflective at all - he made a lot of mistakes on a track that punishes. \n\nHe‚Äôs unlikely to beat max but the difference isn‚Äôt quite what we saw this weekend so far.', 'There are still people who underestimate how great Max really is.', 'Of course Max is on another level but here are multiple factors to consider.\nLawson is new at RB, it‚Äôs his first full season, his teammate is the current four time world champion and Max apparently has gotten all the upgrades.\nI wouldn‚Äôt read too much into it.', ""Max is one of the best drivers to ever do it.\n\nI have no doubts that you could put anyone in the 2nd seat currently and Max would come out ahead.\n\nHowever, drivers like Gasly, Albon, Perez and now Lawson? They're not top drivers, so it's not exactly a big surprise that they are lagging behind Max. OK, maybe a bit too early to judge Lawson, but.... having followed his career for years, he's not really given the impression that he's a top driver.

McLaren didn't mess up their strategy and implemented team calls to prevent possible crashes. You might not like it if you're an Oscar fan, but in those conditions, that was the right call, IMO. 

Red Bull had a sound strategy.

Williams had good strategy scoring amazing points with Albon in P4.

Mercedes should be happy about a podium and a rookie who did incredibly well for a debut, great strategy.

Sauber with points in race 1 is incredible.

Haas didn't have pace but at least kept both cars on the track.

Alpine were... Alpine. Not great for sure.

Racing Bulls bottled their strategy completely messing up Yuki's race.

Ferrari decided to shoot themselves in the foot. The radio messages were funny, but as a driver, that must be frustrating.

1jcfw84,Things we (re)learnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jcfw84/things_we_relearnt/,2025-03-16, Discussion,"1. McLaren: well-balanced car. The Drivers gotta step-up and minimize mistakes.


2. Max: pure talent, man! A class driver ‚Äîand Lando knows it. One mistake, and Max will be right there, ready to snatch away points from you. Especially when it rains.


3. Russell: He drives.


4. Norris vs Piastri is loading. Rivalry within house is gonna be fun for us, headache for Brown and opportunities for Max.


5. Hamilton is learning, so is Ferrari.


6. Williams and Vowles are cooking. Hope it doesn't end up like Aston Martin in 2023.


7. For me, the back-markers are still unclear. Ferrari, despite fighting with Williams and Alpine, will soon catch up to be among the front-runners or at least the lower front. Mercedes is in the upper midfield, and maybe Williams too. Alpine and the rest, including Aston Martin, seem more like mid to lower midfield teams. Sauber and Haas will probably eventually end up being the tail of the pack, but for now, I think they can still catch up to RB, Alpine, and Aston Martin. I'm not convinced yet on who will be the lapped cars.


8. Rookies are adapting among big shots. They'll deliver soon.


Edit: some additional points I should've added + elaborating few.

9. Lando deserved that win‚Äîhe drove brilliantly, and praising Max or discussing mistakes doesn‚Äôt take away from that. But we all know how even a small mistake can cost him dearly. I agree with Crofty that he could have suffered the same fate as Oscar with that mistake, and no, that mistake wasn‚Äôt small‚Äîc‚Äômon, guys. As for Max, it‚Äôs clear he can deliver even without being in a rocket ship.

10. Mercedes vs Ferrari: Many pointed out that Mercedes was faster than Ferrari, and I agree. However, Ferrari has the advantage of a seasoned (legendary) driver. Both Kimi and Lewis will need some time to settle in, and as I mentioned elsewhere, opinions might shift as the weeks and races progress. That said, we‚Äôre not quite at the point where we need to discuss Ferrari‚Äôs No. 2 driver‚Äîlol.

11. Piastri: Some people don‚Äôt see him as ready for a championship battle yet, but I believe he has the potential. In my opinion, he can deliver.

12. Kimi: He‚Äôs getting the hang of the car. I‚Äôd love to see him and Ferrari battle in the coming days.

13. Yuki: He had a great race‚Äîuntil he didn‚Äôt. We‚Äôll often hear him and Liam in the same sentence this year.","['George:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1ihmdnn40pe1.jpeg?width=783&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69b5fb3771009894d07285ddb89c9785c5f2fb65', ""McLaren >>> Red Bull > Mercedes >> Ferrari for me. \n\nStrategy aside, Ferrari's pace wasn't great either day."", 'We have to give Lando credit for his restarts today.
