The F1 season currently has 24 races and while most circuits are locked in with multi-year contracts, there appears to be at least one available slot in 2027, with the Dutch Grand Prix to no longer be held after 2026 and the Belgian Grand Prix shifting to a bi-annual rotation.  Italy may also lose one of its current Grand Prix races, with the Imola expiring at the end of this season.

Thailand is not the only contender in the bidding race though, with rival submissions expected from organisers in South Africa and Rwanda. Authorities in South Korea and Argentina have also previously expressed interest.

It also hosts an annual MotoGP motorcycle race in Buriram in the east of the country, which generated US$140 million in economic circulation in 2024 and created close to 7,000 job positions at the circuit, according to the tourism authority.

A race in Bangkok would mean two annual races in the region, alongside the Singapore GP, which has been on the calendar in its Marina Bay circuit form since 2008. It was the first night race in the sport’s history and the first street race in Asia.

If Komatsu is what he appears to be, they have a chance to move forward into the midpack for only the second time in their history in 2025.  It might not work, but a window to move forward has appeared for the team for the first time in at least 4 years.  

With many of the big players focusing significant resources on the 2026 regulation changes there's an opportunity to make some short term noise for one year, nail the final year of the old regulation to move up into the P5 range for one year to enhance their reputation, then accept you'll be a little behind on the new regs and play catchup eyeing 2027.  

or they could play it safe, look to 2026 and not worry too much about the car this year in the same way Vowles says he's going to do.

Bottom line:  With new backing and access to improved facilities, Haas has greater upside than they've had in awhile, and it'll be interesting to see if they can capitalize on it.

  
As for why I bring up Aston Martin, that should be reasonably obvious.  They don't lack for talent, and their facilities have improved considerably in the last 3 years, but they have a reputation of being one of the most directionless teams in formula 1.  For those of us familiar with the American NFL, I've referred to Lawrence Stroll as the Jerry Jones of Formula 1, which is still an apt comparison.  High profile signings. lack of coherent vision, a fetish for ""pet"" players that are somehow immovable even while they fail to get the job done.

The problem at Aston Martin is not a lack of resources, or good drivers.  Alonso is great, and Lance, despite the meme that he is, has his moments and is an adequate second driver.  But there is a vast lack of coherent vision at Aston-Martin.  The talent that Jerry... sorry Larry is bringing in is from different teams with different schools of thought, brought in without regard for how well their ideas mesh together, and without ownership making executive decisions on exactly how they want to attack the regulations, all the talent and facilities in the world won't create a great car.  Just ask Ferrari.  

Larry's identity seems to be simply be ""I have a lot of money and therefore should win.""  That doesn't work in a universe with a cost cap.  You have to have some idea what kind of car you want to build.  Fast in the straights, quick in the corners, light and agile or heavy and powerful.  You have the talent, personnel, facilities and drivers to do any of those things, but not all of them at once.  So pick one.

If Aston manages to figure that out they can move up in 2025.  But ironically the best chance of Aston figuring this out is if Lance, who has been front and center suffering from this rudderless, flailing, throw-crap-at-the-wall style of management, gains more pull on the management side of the team and his near decade of F1 driving experience allows Lance to come up with a concrete improvement plan, decide what HE wants to do, run it by his dad's people and starts building an actual identity for the team himself.  Will it happen who knows, but from where I'm sitting, it's the best chance for Aston to move forward and not backward.","['Late season AM is gonna be really interesting, they’ll be going at 100 percent by then with Adrian N and their facilities complete', 'Maybe Aston Martin needs to build a car... for COMBAT.', ""Haas's performance has always largely been dictated by the performance of the Ferrari, rather than anything to do with management/team principals. It's no coincidence their cars mirrored each other in their areas of improvement last year. That will probably change this year with them deciding not to go down Ferrari's pull rod suspension route, so it will be interesting to see how they handle that."", ""With the new regs coming any mid to back marker team could be an x factor if they decide to keep working in this year's car after the others have moved on."", 'Nice P and R reference.', ""not 2025, 2026 is when they are the biggest factor as that's always been the aim for winning races.

Helping make things harder to assess is the big variance in how they compared to each other from the beginning to the end of their time together.\n\nHe appeared to have a very good 2001 against Button, better than Ralf in 2000 against the same benchmark, but this is widely attributed to Button’s struggles in adapting to the woeful Benetton, as well as the team environment hurting Button mentally.\n\nFisi’s next two years were alongside rookies, then his 2004 was against a second-year Massa before he got the drive alongside Alonso.\n\nThere seem to have been several points prior to 2005 at which Fisichella’s stock was very high, and maybe one or two occasions (mainly 98) where it was somewhat lower. From 2005, his stock crumbled. But do we think that reflects how well he actually performed? \n\nWas his performance alongside Alonso a reflection of what he always was, or did his level vary? Did Ralf surpass him after 97?

Some people believe Lando still doesn’t belong in that group despite taking 8 poles in 2024, which is laughable.

I also believe Bottas, Hulkenberg and Sainz are underrated over one lap. Probably the three drivers just behind the upper echelon. 

Hamilton and Alonso are also in that category, and I feel you could make an argument for Gasly and Ocon too.","['Verstappen and Leclerc. If Verstappen managed to finish his Saudi lap in...2021? 2022?

If it's a race pace car, like the sf24 and the 2022 red bull car  obviously it will be harder to put it on pole. If it's a quali car like the sf90, then it'll be easier to pole but harder to hold on to it. Extreme cars like those always skew quali stats.\nThat being said, Leclerc is the fastest over one lap on his day but Max is  fairly more consistent than him so Max takes this easy.\nNot gonna devote too much attention to the other 2 as it's just laughable that they're brought up at all.

All four have elite pace over one lap, with Max having the highest level of consistency (though not by much tbh, they all have high consistency when it comes to dragging the most out of their cars in qualifying).\n\nSainz's pure one-lap pace is underrated. On his day he's every bit as fast as the top 4, but he can't find that elite pace consistently enough to quite be ranked with them imo. It puts him just a step below.
