I mostly wanted to post this to encourage some discussion about what would work best for F1 in terms of rules/racing guidelines. We're never going to get to a consensus but it's a fun discussion to be had. ","['I think it\'s also worth noting that stewards *should* be looking at the incidents themselves and not the consequences of said incident. Which is very tough to do.\n\nIf you take consequence into action then a small bump, like let\'s say between Vettel and Leclerc in Brazil 2019, would be penalized heavier than someone spinning the other around where both can continue (Vettel and Verstappen 2018 for example). One being a racing incident and the other with a more obvious ""agressor"". \n\nBut if you don\'t take the consequence in action there will be situations where not everyone will be happy with the outcome because they feel it is either too light or too harsh of a punishment. I could name one in particular but I think most people have one in mind. \n\nAnd that\'s just one part of the decision making. Also if you leave it up to the drivers you\'ll just end up with situations where they\'ll just risk the penalty and be fine with it because they\'ll make up for it. That\'s not the way to go, it also will be inconsistent as hell.', 'My view is very simple: corner ownership is not real. If a car is meaningfully alongside, give space. The way people get a ""right"" to run others off is what has caused every other flashpoint this year.', ""It's not just the rules, a big part is the enforcing of them, and it sucks for drivers and spectators.\n\nYou see an incident on track and you don't know if it's going to be a penalty or if it's not even going to be investigated at all, with Max and Norris turn 1, it was noted but who knows what they would have decided on, it clearly looked like Max was in the clear by the rules, but RBR either questioned the rules or did not trust how the stewards would enforce those rules."", ""Great read, thanks for the share. There's also a podcast featuring Mark, Josh and Edd from earlier this week which covers this topic.\n\nAs they mention in the article and the podcast, the drivers are the ones that have pushed for this. The issue is that written wording can never cover the vast array of racing scenarios.\n\nMark said on the podcast earlier this week, 'the stewards aren't inconsistent, the racing incidents are', but each incident is compared against a checklist that the stewards are being forced to use.\n\nSainz - Bearman was a good example of this. The rules as written didn't require Sainz to square off the corner, and because he's ticked the right boxes, the stewards are forced to give a penalty to Bearman."", 'The Drivers have pushed for stupid, stupid rules.\n\nOne lesson to take from this is don\'t let the drivers decide how the rules are implemented. It\'s like letting the inmates run the asylum.\n\nThe rules should be very simple and be what these guys have grown up being expected to do in junior racing:\n\n* If a car manages to get significant overlap they have to be given at least a car\'s width to the track edge\n* Signficant overlap could be defined in many ways but I would say at least front wheel ahead of rear wheel\n* No one can ever ""own"" a corner, any car alongside must be given space\n\nThis is how Leclerc raced Piastri and it resulted in a fantastic overtake, letter of the law, Leclerc was free to basically shove him out the way.\n\nMy proposed rules give more leeway to attackers to be confident they won\'t be taken out but makes defending still possible if done well, it would allow more multi-corner battling as cars would remain side by side without the current threat of being shoved off if the other driver claims the corner.', 'What would f1 media be without the word ""verdict""?', 'Take BEA/SAI for instance, in simple terms SAI established his overtake as per the rules by being ahead into the corner & apex. He must therefore be given sufficient room to complete the manoeuvre safely & within track limits. That room is entirely at the discretion of SAI to give or not give. SAI chose not to give room, BEA biffed him and was duly punished. It’s kinda perfect. BEA could’ve withdrawn earlier, concede and not receive punishment; SAI could’ve given more space and the two navigate that corner somewhat alongside each other instead of ruining each others progression - They didn’t. It requires you to know who you are racing and exercise some smarts.', ""Shout out to my favourite quote from the article, Jon Nobles suggestion:\n\n>A small part of me would love F1 to have no racing rules at all, and leave drivers to sort things out amongst themselves.\n\n>If anyone got pushed off wide or spun out in a race, they could take it up with their rival in the paddock afterwards - or exact their revenge at the following event.\n\nIn general for me the rules are just too strictly applied. I think there should be at least a clear marker for when another car needs to leave space. I don't mind the 'far enough alongside' guideline. I just think a bit more common sense should be applied rather than making the rule black and white. For me an attacker should always make sure the defender gets enough space to stay on track. The defender should get a bit more leeway. They can't always leave space, depending on what the attacker is doing. \n\nI also agree with Glenn Freeman that the stewards need to make more use of racing incidents. Not every collision is only because of one party."", 'That does mean that you need guidelines that determine when someone is meaningfully alongside. \n\nTo try to get a bit more discussion, when would someone qualify as significantly alongside for you? Does it change on the inside or outside of the corner or for is it different for the attacker/defender? Does it change when someone lunges in from far back with a lot of speed?', ""Making rules that make racing better is really difficult. There is no one size fits all rule for racing. Like you said, every incident is different. Interpretation of humans (stewards) will always be needed but because those stewards change a lot, consistency is hard to come by. \n\nThe Sainz-Bearman one is really a good example of following the letter of the law a bit too well. It just doesn't feel like that is what the rule is supposed to do/who the rule is supposed to protect. It also doesn't make the racing itself better. But hey at least the stewards were applying the rules consistently... yay?""]",0,25,0.44,0,23,23,0,9,0.06,0
