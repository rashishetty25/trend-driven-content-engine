The Monegasque immediately wanted to clarify the matter, denying any possible crisis with the team with which he has now competed for seven seasons and then focusing on the themes of the weekend on the Sakhir circuit , where Ferrari brings the first important updates of the season.\n\n\nLeclerc: “There are no negative things with the team”\n\n\nIn the days following the Japanese GP, many rumors circulated regarding Leclerc's statements , in which he repeatedly reiterated that he had found a direction in which to move to best manage the SF-25. Some saw this as a fracture within Ferrari, with the Monegasque intent on taking a different path than Lewis Hamilton, who would have been listened to more by the team.\n\nIn Bahrain, Leclerc clarified that none of this is true: “ I didn’t really understand where these rumours came from . What I said, and I repeat it now, is that there are no negative things in it. There is a direction that I found very interesting to go and work in, but it is done every year and I want to push in that direction. There is nothing of what I have seen written , that we are both going in very different directions or that the team was going in a different direction, none of that. Obviously we are all here to try to maximise the potential of the car and if I feel more comfortable putting the car in a different place, then it is positive for everyone .”\n\n\nProgress expected in Bahrain, not miracles\n\n\nFerrari arrives in Sakhir with some new features on the SF-25 that are highly hoped to help them turn around a disappointing start to the season. Leclerc believes that performance can benefit from this: “ We have some new features coming on the car, which I hope will help us close the gap a little bit . Will they be enough to close the gap completely? I don’t think there’s a lot in what we’re bringing here, but I hope it helps us at least get closer. It’s still a significant step forward .”\n\n\nLeclerc confirmed that the gap to recover on McLaren is 3 tenths, a gap he hopes to close completely when the next updates arrive: “ In Suzuka, the gap that was between us and McLaren was 3 tenths . We have to work hard to recover it, so that's what we're doing and I'm confident that we can close it.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.
