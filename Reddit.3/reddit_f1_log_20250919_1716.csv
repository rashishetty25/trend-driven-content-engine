Jenson Button said it drove terribly in the first test , but when told he was faster than everyone was shocked', ""I think what you also need to add is that Honda put *all* of their efforts into 2009 during the 2008 season, to the point they were very much ahead of the curve when 09 started.\n\nMoreover, they were able to maximise their results when they had the advantage, which massively disappeared as 2009 evolved and the other teams caught up. There was also a legal battle over the Brawn, which they thankfully won, and they managed to gain enough sponsorship to keep themselves afloat during the year.\n\nI think you've summarised other factors nicely though, so not much more to add on my account."", 'Double diffuser.

But they were 9th in the WCC in 2008, with only 14 points with only one podium (3rd in GB GP)\n\nIn 2009 I think some things just matched miraculously to allow BrawnGP to happen: they switched to Mercedes engines (arguably better than Honda engines), they risked it all going with the double diffuser (bigger teams didn’t as they understood it would be illegal and quickly shut down by FIA), and Ross Brawn made magic with some of his decisions, maybe partially because he had more freedom from a Honda that was going out.']",0,13,0.3,0,13,13,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0

From my own experience, you don’t need weeks of prep, just a few sessions training in the heat made a massive difference in resiliency and cut heat injuries way down.

Misunderstandings and falsehoods can be easily clarified.\n\nErgo, if Liam was fully secure in whatever he was doing in 2026, Racing Bulls wouldn't go around censoring fair and frankly innocuous questions. Reading between the lines and using the context provided, you can pretty well infer what's happened and why the question's been blocked.\n\nYou can say what you want about the headline or the premise of the article or the state of the F1 media, which I agree has been sullied by clickbait, poor research, and drivel masquerading as op-eds. But this is a brave and important piece calling out the obstruction of the press, a trend that I've noticed is rising in motorsport in recent years and exacerbating the erosion of real journalism.\n\nThat PR teams increasingly view the press as something to be censored suggests a failure of two things: properly training their drivers to be able to answer challenging questions, and building relationships with the media that serve both parties.\n\nThis second part is jeopardized when public relations entities control access and narratives to an unreasonable degree, thereby limiting journalists' ability to work –\xa0and yes, as Mat's article says, often by speaking on behalf of otherwise cooperative sources. It's all about image control. And while in some cases image control is prudent, it's counterproductive and absurd when taken to an extreme, as it often is in racing.\n\nI know several other reputable racing journalists these days who feel powerless to do real reporting because they'll be yelled at, chased out, or denied access for deigning to do their jobs properly, which sometimes entails asking tougher questions because they're the only ones charged with doing so.\n\nGood journalists generally aren't interested in engaging with this kind of coercive behavior, and many simply stop trying after a while –\xa0which only invites more rubbish to the table. Mat alludes to the perils of this pretty well at the end, when he has to offer speculation instead of firsthand material.\n\nThe quiet protest of declining the invitation is exactly what should be done.
