Now that the dust has settled in Suzuka, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""I have to say - I do think people are overreacting a bit coming off of this race in regards to these regs. I think the reasons why we've had such an astoundingly tedious race (even by Suzuka standards) is a combination of factors such as - late track resurfacing that caught up Pirelli and their tyre choices off guard, and the weather that was too dull, to put it simply (cool, but not damp or cool enough to make it interesting, like making cars slide all over the place, but neither was it warm enough to induce serious tyre wear). Having said that - no changes to the regs did make it so the team's were completely unobstructed from adding elements and making changes to their cars that would make them even harder to follow, but I do think this was an unfortunate exaggeration of the problem. On top of that - Pirelli cannot be completely absolved of the blame here. Their task is horrible, difficult, and the combination of those words, yes, but fact of the matter is - Hard is just an op tyre now, and that shouldn't be the case."", 'Falling asleep on lap 7 and waking up with two laps left to the grid being almost identical was a trip.', 'RBR still has the best on track operations. They are the team who makes the changes between Friday and Saturday work the most.', ""Ah, Suzuka. Probably the best circuit in the world, and one I plan to go to next year, but yesterday was absolutely dull.\n\nOn one hand, I don't mind there being races like that. The 2010 season is one of my all time favourites but it did also feature several dull races. I think what made yesterday frustrating was the fact that across the whole grid, very little happened. The race between the front three was pretty much the only battle across the grid, and even then Norris never got close enough to even get DRS. Max won the race on Saturday, and the overall performance from him was probably his best ever. I know people rank CoTA 2021 as his finest race but I think this was better overall.\n\nThe main worry I've got for the season is Pirelli. It's a small sample size but so far the Hard tyre in both China and Japan was absolutely incredible. Zero deg, zero graining and easily the outright fastest race tyre. As a result, there is only one strategic option available (M-H). Pirelli either need to be a bit braver and make all tyres softer, or where possible the H needs to be a step harder so that it is truly slow and a two stop becomes a better strategy. Ideally the hard should be between 1.5-2s slower than the Medium. \n\nOddly, last year at Suzuka tyre deg was a really issue and we saw a mixture of 1,2 and 3 pit stops across the grid. Perhaps the resurfacing has made the track too easy on the tyres? Likewise, the cold weather probably helped. A track as brutal as Suzuka should not be an easy one stop imo."", 'Hirakawa going from FP1 in an Alpine to changing teams and doing FP1 in a Haas within a week is insane and I’m totally here for it', 'It will be interesting to see McLarens advantage at much hotter tracks considering we’ve had colder weather during the first 3 races. We will see if anyone can get near them in Bahrain and Jeddah where the weather is going to be much hotter.', ""Well that was a bit of a dull race. I did enjoy the tension from the top three basically being close together the whole race. With Max being the one in front though, I wasn't really expecting him to make a mistake. After the pitstops I didn't really think McLaren could win the race, unless Max' tyres would've fallen off massively.\n\nThe biggest issue with this race was that the resurfaced part of the track meant that there was a lot less tyre degradation than expected. It was also quite cool. I don't remember who said it, but on Friday during practice apparently there was a lot more deg. Contrary to some people I saw yesterday, I don't really blame Pirelli. Last season they brought the correct tyre range in Japan and we had the two stop. They simply can't account for everything, they don't know how much deg the resurfacing will bring, they can't control the weather.\n\nMaybe a bit of a weird opinion but I'm kind of glad that the TV director missed the pit exit shenanigans by their stupid decision to switch to Leclercs pitstop. It was the only thing that brought some tention because we missed what actually happened. Meanwhile if we'd been with Max and Lando the whole time, we wouldn't even have had the tention of 'did Max do something?'. We would have just seen Lando drive himself into the grass the first time around. And that would be it, nothing Max did wrong, just a bit silly from Lando."", 'For everyone saying McLaren could have challenged Max with a split strategy, they are correct. However, Lando and Oscar’s side of the garage clearly see each other as the main championship rival. \n\nOne side of the garage will not be ready to take a statistically weaker strategy that can hand an advantage to the other, not at this stage at least.\n\nIt’s like asking Nico to sacrifice a win in 2016 to let Hamilton win against Max/Seb or something.\n\nThe McL’s aren’t that ahead of the pack as a 2016 Merc yet not early season I do not see any driver sacrificing anything.', ""I think people are being too harsh on McLaren. The race was won in qualifying because of a Max god lap. Undercuts and overcuts were both notoriously unsuccessful throughout the entire field, and the cool surface with zero tire deg made overcoming dirty air to overtake virtually impossible.\n\nI think alot of people were broken by the 2023 Red Bull. That's not the bar...no car has ever been that dominant when you factor in the complete package + reliability. McLaren's car isn't utterly dominant, they aren't going to win every race, and Suzuka has been Red Bull's most dominant track in these ground effect regs.\n\nThere are 21 races and a pretty substantial aero rule change still to occur this year, we all need to pump the brakes a bit."", 'I’m still recovering from my nap']",33,124,0.88,33,120,120,0,5,0.020000000000000018,0
