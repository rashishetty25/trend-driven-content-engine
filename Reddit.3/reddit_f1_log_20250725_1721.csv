1m8y3k9,[AMuS] Verstappen is commited to stay at Red Bull for 2026. But Red Bull agreed to let him go for 2027 in case he wants to leave the team,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m8y3k9/amus_verstappen_is_commited_to_stay_at_red_bull/,2025-07-25, News,,"['Great, now what are we gonna talk about over the summer break?', 'Would be interesting if George and Kimi only get 1 year contract extensions', 'This seems like a fairly smart move by Max. He might forfeit the chance at a 2026 title should Merc be capable of it, but he also eliminates the risk of being locked into a bad situation, be that Merc underperforming or committing to Red Bull only for their works engine to flop. \n\nAlso helps Merc avoid paying an enormous sum to buy him out right now.', 'This doesn’t fit my narrative', 'Google Translation \n\n> The Verstappen mystery is beginning to unravel. For months, the industry has been puzzling over whether the Dutchman will stay at Red Bull or join Mercedes. After Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff and Verstappen met during the break following the Silverstone race in Sardinia, rumors of a transfer were reignited.\n\n> The much-quoted exit clause will come into effect after the Belgian GP. According to this clause, Verstappen could leave if he finishes worse than third in the World Championship. With an 18-point lead over fourth-placed George Russell, this is rather unlikely, despite the points inflation on a sprint weekend.\n\n> It has since leaked out that Verstappen will stay with Red Bull in 2026. He still describes the team as his second family. And from his perspective, it\'s not about exit clauses or personnel matters, but about the team proving to him that it can build a competitive car. ""The last year and a half haven\'t been so good. Now we\'re looking ahead. We have to work on the car and improve it for this year, but also for next season.""\n\n> With this, the world champion is already confirming between the lines that he will definitely stay with Red Bull for another year. The defending champion\'s camp has realized that a hasty move will create more problems than it solves. As of today, no one can reliably predict who will have a good or bad chance next year. A fellow driver says: ""If you\'re going to make a mistake, it\'s better to do it with the team you\'re with. In 2026, you\'ll be able to make a much better choice with more knowledge.""\n\n> Verstappen would have to commit to Mercedes or another team long-term. Anyone who moves now can\'t immediately turn around a year later. At Red Bull, he would effectively be free at the end of 2026. Then the cockpits at Ferrari, Aston Martin, and Mercedes will also be filled.\n\n> Verstappen could, of course, continue driving for Red Bull if the team succeeds in challenging for victories, even under the new regulations. Verstappen\'s management has demanded this freedom. Team boss Christian Horner refused to accept it. This is said to have been the final piece of the puzzle for his disempowerment.\n\n> It would also be interesting to see what happens if Verstappen, contrary to expectations, slips to fourth place after the Belgian GP. Then Toto Wolff will have to consider the Verstappen option again.\n\n> In that case, Andrea Kimi Antonelli would probably have to leave and be parked at another Mercedes team. This is how one should interpret the statements of George Russell, who emphasized again in Spa: ""If you look at the facts, Mercedes can\'t get ahead of me.""\n\n> George Russell could live with Verstappen, even if the two drivers aren\'t best friends. ""I have respect, but I\'m not afraid of Max."" For Mercedes, it would be a fine line to form the two very different superstars into one team. That would almost be on the scale of what happened with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren. This speculation may already be history after the Belgian weekend. Then Mercedes will tell its drivers the truth.', ""Whichever team is quickest in 2026, that's where he'll go. Gambling on who'll rein in the new car at this point would be foolish. Prove it on the track and Max will come calling."", 'I think the speculation will continue until Mercedes or Red Bull make formal announcements', 'Alonso retired after 26, Max and Lance duo for 27', 'There are so many conflicting reports about Verstappen’s contract and plans.

Is there still light at the end of this tunnel?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m941pq/i_feel_for_lewis_is_there_still_light_at_the_end/,2025-07-25, Discussion,Poor guy is one of the greatest of all time and yet he keeps taking it on the chin. He looked broken coming out of that car just now. At this point do we feel that his stint at Ferarri will ever become a success or are big changes needed? How long do we think Fred will continue to defend either side of this misery?,"[""> Is there still light at the end of this tunnel?\n\nYes, usually it's a train."", ""He's getting the full Ferrari experience"", ""What's there to pity him? He is the most successful F1 driver and is omega rich."", 'The entrance of the Ferrari tunnel is brightly lit, but the other side has been shrouded in darkness since 2008', ""I mean, for Lewis to have seen Ferrari from the outside, he'd be dumb to think it's going to be a change just because he's driving for them now.\n\nAnd I don't think he's dumb. This was a $50,000,000 per season layup before he retires - any positive results along the way are a bonus."", ""I was extremely optimistic his expertise and history of dominance would've pushed Ferrari at least *marginally* closer to their goals. I did not expect him to absolutely eat shit, and I certainly would've expected Charles to benefit from having him as a team mate.  \n\nAll that to say; **no, I don't think there is a light at the end of this tunnel.** I think it's over. As a big fan of athletic legacies - which sounds weird but idk how else to phrase it - its extremely depressing."", 'When I first saw the announcement I honestly assumed it was a sentimental bucket list item to check off before he inevitably retires. I guess I just have a really hard time believing he genuinely thinks he can get his eighth at Ferrari, and that this was anything more than a very expensive business transaction.', 'Honestly I didn’t like the move from its announcement. I get the marketing behind it, you can’t say no, and we couldn’t have guessed the car to get worse from last year, but this is exactly how I saw it going', ""Being 100% honest here; I like Lewis, I think he is one of the GOATs of the sport. But I HATED his move to Ferrari. I hated it for him, because of Ferrari doing Ferrari things. But I also hated it for what it did to Carlos,  shunting him to a mid-field team and I hated it for what it did to Charles, potentially splitting Ferrari's focus between their drivers. So, while I feel for Lewis , he was the only one who had complete agency over this move and all its consequences; so he made his bed, he can lie in it.\n\nEdited for grammar""]",0,53,0.32,0,45,45,0,53,0.32,0
