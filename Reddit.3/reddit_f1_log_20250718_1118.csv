Law/Lin will still be Racing Bulls line up. The Red Bull one would consist of Hadjar and someone else.\xa0\n\nThat someone else could be Yuki. Or it could be another.

This would almost definitely not happen as the only scenario where Toto replaces Kimi would be if he finds somewhere to loan him eg Alpine.\xa0\n\nRussell - If Max goes to Mercedes and Russell is outed then Red Bull would want him. This is a more likely scenario than any of the above driver but still I think Russell would chose Aston Martin if he can.\n\nAlonso - This leads to the last option. If Russell goes to AM and AM decide to out Alonso rather than Stroll (depends how much influence Honda has in driver line up. If they had a lot they would not accept Alonso’s sacking) then Alonso would want a seat. He would have RB and Alpine with seats open.
