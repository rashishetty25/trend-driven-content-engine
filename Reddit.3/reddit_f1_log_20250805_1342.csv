1mhyrn9,How do this season's constructors compare now that we're half way through?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mhyrn9/how_do_this_seasons_constructors_compare_now_that/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"Obviously McLaren have the best car this year, but it seems so hard to judge outside of that. The Aston Martin seemed like a tractor and then suddenly had both in the top 7. The Red Bull appears to (have) been capable of winning races for the first third of the season, while the second car can't get inside the top 15. The Merc also seemed competitive for the first third of the season.

The RB has been consistently able to be just inside the top 10 with three different drivers. The Sauber is a tractor that both of its driver's have been able to drive into the top 6. The Ferrari seems all over the show, the only vehicle that seems consistently shit is the Alpine, but even then Gasly has had it inside the top 10 a few times. 

So, given all that, how are we ranking them? I guess taking an average across the first half of the season I'd say:

1. McLaren 

2. Mercedes? This felt like an easy pick up until the last three races

3. Ferrari? Again, so all-over the place that it's hard to assess this car

4. Red Bull - It has been competitive at times in the hands of a generational talent, but worst on the grid while Yuki/LL have been piloting

5. Aston Martin - Stroll has been in and out of the points all season in the AM, and lately Alonso has been accumulating even more points than Stroll in it. Hungary in particular it was strong

6. Racing Bull - Doesn't have the pace to compete at the top, but is reliable and has been consistently in the 8-12 placings

7. Williams? - Has shown the ability to have pace, but has also been inconsistent despite having two very good drivers

8. Sauber? - Everyone labels it a tractor, but it has been on the podium and has scored points under both drivers

9. Haas - Seems harsh as it has scored points under both drivers hands too

10. Alpine - Gasly has regularly taken it into the points, but both second drivers have struggled to drive it out of the bottom quarter.

  
What are your feelings/rankings so far, I'm interested to see and have something to talk about while I wait for the Netherlands :)","['Tie between Mercedes and Ferrari as there have been races where one has been clearly better than the other.\n\nAnd I would order the middle and lower class of the grid like this: Williams, Aston Martin, Sauber, Haas, Racing Bulls & Alpine', 'Consistently, RB over Aston Martin', 'All teams are very close together overall, especially compared to the past. \n\nWhen it was normal that we saw some cars lapped multiple times and most cars lapped at least once, tier list of the constructors was easy. \n\nNow we have a double situation:\n\nAll teams are relatively close together, we have qualifyings where almost all cars are within 1s during Q1. And we super sensitive tyres that change their performance with just a change of the ambient temperature by few degrees kelvin. \n\nSuddenly Mercedes is the fastest car in Canada, only to go for a spell of mediocre results for Russell and terrible results for Antonelli. Suddenly the Williams finds itself nowhere, only to be somewhere the next race. The drives to P19 and starts from the pitlane only to start P5 next race. \n\nIn the past these up and downs of 0.5s of lap time due to a fitting track did make you jump like 2 or 4 positions maximum. Now you jump halve the field. Hitting the tyres gives you another 0.5s compared to teams that miss it. \n\nMy current order is: McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull, racing bulls, sauber, Williams, Aston, Haas and Alpine. \n\nThe order 10 races ago might be quite different. With Aston even worse, Williams P5, Sauber worse and a change between Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull', 'The only certains things are Mclaren will finish P1 and Alpine P10 (only team with no upgrades since Barcelona and no upgrades scheduled for the rest of the season, 100% focusing on 2026).', 'As we\'ve seen several times this season, these cars are one upgrade from gaining or dropping several places in the pecking order. And the track can make a massive difference. Several teams have been at the back of the grid one week then deep in the points the next. So to call any of them ""tractors"" or ""shitboxes"" is in my opinion both dumb and also disrespectful. The field is so tight this year and it\'s hard to know which teams will swing which way, which is part of why this season is great. 1st is wrapped up. There\'s pretty much a 2-way battle for 2nd with 4th almost guaranteed. But behind them it\'s anyone\'s game.', 'Kick Sauber have looked significantly improved since there last upgrades a couple races ago', ""Don't want be mean or anything, but you are aware that there is a WCC that pretty much reflects the pecking order?"", ""I personally believe that a car is only as good as its fastest driver. With that in mind, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd rank the teams based on overall pace in the first half of the season:\n\nMcLaren ‚Äì No notes. \n\nMercedes ‚Äì It‚Äôs been pretty tight between them and Red Bull. They‚Äôve both taken turns being the second or third fastest team, occasionally slipping to fourth if Ferrari shows up. But on average, I‚Äôd give Merc the edge.\n\nRed Bull ‚Äì Pretty much the same story as Merc. I know there‚Äôs probably a case for putting them fourth and I get that. I think that argument mainly comes from the gap between Max and Yuki. But like I said earlier, I‚Äôm judging based on what the car is capable of, so I‚Äôm giving weight to the fastest driver.\n\nFerrari ‚Äì Similar vibes. Flashes of performance, but just not consistent enough to crack the top three. They've been better in the last couple of races though. So, that could very well change.\n\nWilliams ‚Äì Reliability‚Äôs been a pain, but in terms of raw pace, I think they‚Äôve been ahead of the rest below them.\n\nRacing Bulls ‚Äì Quietly solid. They've been around the points more often than not, and haven‚Äôt had the wild ups and downs that Haas or Sauber have.\n\nAston Martin ‚Äì They started the season off terribly, but they‚Äôve finally begun to find some form. Curious to see if they keep climbing.\n\nHaas ‚Äì Bit of a toss-up between them and Sauber, could go either way.\n\nSauber ‚Äì They‚Äôre picking up lately, which is nice to see. Could easily jump a spot or two if they keep it up.\n\nAlpine ‚Äì Yeah... no comment."", 'I think the construtors points table is a pretty good indicator of where everyone is. The only real development is that it looks like the Sauber has improved a lot, so they can expect to move up if no one else does development', 'The Ranking between merc Ferrari and rbr is really Hard because they bassically had comparable results. \n\nI would say that you can, make an Argument for almost every Order between them.']",0,20,0.46,0,17,17,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
