1ig1713,How would you feel about a formula racing league system where the best and worst constructors can be promoted or relegated into the next division?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ig1713/how_would_you_feel_about_a_formula_racing_league/,2025-02-02, Discussion,"Not sure if this has been discussed on here before, this is just a shower thought I had, I'm not saying this would ever be logistically possible to implement. 





I'm thinking a league with 3 formula divisions all using the same technical regulations for fairness. Obviously this means that F1, F2 and F3 would have to run the same spec car as each other, which constructors can then tweak based on the regs, so that if an F1 constructor dropped into F2 they wouldn't just absolutely dominate the F2 season, and if an F2 team got promoted to F1 they would actually have a chance to be competitive. I can see it boosting F2 and F3 viewership but obviously there is a lot wrong with this idea too




","['That’s essentially what we had before. Do well or be erased. Problem is racing just can’t operate that way, and that goes for any series. Expenses in racing are unlike stick and ball sports. As the saying goes; how do you become a millionaire in racing?

F2 teams don't have the money to pull off a proper F1 campaign, and even if they did, it takes years to get an organization of that size up to speed. You can't expect the 11 formula 2 teams to be pouring the money (at least 135 million dollars a year, but I doubt it can get under 200 million a year) into having an F1 ready operation when only 1 of them will go up to F1 the next year"", ""Does not work, because F1 should not be spec series and F2 and F3 should be.\n\nAs an idea, i am very interested in it, but it can't work. Non-spec series lower than F1 would not be financially viable, and especially big car manufacturors would not want to take part, F1 has had enough trouble attracting them and it remains to see whether everyone who takes part in 2026 will remain.\n\nYou would need Indycar and F1 and perhaps also Formula E to first unite into one and same series, then split it in lower and higher series where rules are almost identical. That is only way it would work, and that is fantasy and even then it likely would not work, and i don't see F1 fans wanting pure oval races (i think lot of people would be interested in oval as part of a race track like old monza), at least not more than Indy 500, and i don't think Indycar fans would be happy in many ways.\n\nIt works for sports like ice hockey where game is played with same equipment on same rinks with only minor differences in rules between series. At most it would work for F2 and F3, but since they are meant for driver and personnel development it would create contractrual problems if F3 winner signs up with F2 team, but that team gets relegated to F3. They are designed for personnel to swap series, not entire teams."", 'You lost me at F1 being a spec series. If you want to watch a spec series watch one of the many that already are.', 'Won work.

Constructors can tweak it, so the ones that know 10 races before the end of the season that they will not be relegated, can start working on next years bits and pieces as well, while the bottom and top teams will have to double dip and double money it?\n\nWould this be the MotoGP-way, all series do the same races, or do they keep the calendars similar to now. If the latter, how should contracts work, there is a massive difference between working 9 race weekends and 24.\n\n  \nI do feel that FOM could take inspiration from how Moto GP, 2, 3 is being handled in terms of programming etc. There is still a whole lot more viewers for the main event, but it feels more like a package, and while Moto3 isn\'t a possible career-path like the small cc class was in the ""old days"", Moto2 is still an actual career path. Slightly similar to how it is possible, while harder than before, to make a living and a career out of being a driver in the Truck og xFinity-series in NASCAR.\n\nFIA Formula-racing is however set up in a clear pyramid, where it isn\'t a viable career to spend 10-15 years in F2 like you can see people doing in xFinity, Moto2 etc.  \nHeck, even WRC2 has become an actual place for paid rally-drivers now. Yes, that is in part due to very low number of manufacturer entries in the top class, but it is still possible.  \nThere would have to be massive changes for this to be thing in F1,2,3 though.', 'No one has money for that.
