And just 11 when his soon-to-be Ferrari team-mate won his maiden world title the following season; on the final corner of the final lap of the final race.\n\nYou might think that historic moment ‚Äì the sport‚Äôs first black driver, a generational talent and hero to millions of young karters around the world,\xa0winning the world title\xa0‚Äì would make an impression on a motorsport-mad boy growing up in Monaco, the playground of Formula One‚Äôs elite. But you would be wrong.\n\n‚ÄúActually I think I‚Äôm a bit of an outlier in the paddock, because I didn‚Äôt really watch Formula One growing up,‚Äù Leclerc confesses when I ask for his earliest memories of the man he will\xa0soon be calling his team-mate.\n\n‚ÄúEvery weekend I had free, I was with my father on a karting track, and we‚Äôd just drive. That‚Äôs what I loved doing most. So actually, I don‚Äôt have many memories of watching F1 or Lewis in his first seasons.\n\n‚ÄúI do remember a bit, the reaction to what happened \\[at Interlagos\\]. Everyone being like ‚ÄòThat was completely crazy!‚Äô But you know, you‚Äôre young. Monday I was at school, and I never really got to see it again. It‚Äôs very different to, I think, every other driver in the paddock, in that I was just so focused on my own thing and enjoyed so much what I was doing, I didn‚Äôt really take an interest‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n# ‚ÄòThe motivation for Hamilton at Ferrari will be crazy‚Äô\n\nSafe to say Leclerc is taking a close interest in Hamilton now. Sitting in Ferrari‚Äôs paddock home, surrounded by red shirts and hats to sign, Leclerc is well aware that the now seven-time-world champion is about to turn his ‚Äì and the team‚Äôs ‚Äì life upside down.\n\nIf he is concerned about the impact\xa0[the arrival of Hamilton](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/08/30/lewis-hamilton-ferrari-fans-monza-italian-gp-mercedes/)\xa0might have, he is playing it very cool. The Monegasque, who made history on Friday when he and younger brother Arthur became the first brothers to participate in a practice session as team-mates, is for the moment more concerned with the constructors‚Äô championship battle this weekend in Abu Dhabi. Ferrari begin the weekend just 21 points behind leaders McLaren and Leclerc believes ‚Äúeverything is possible‚Äù, although since speaking he has been handed a 10-place grid penalty for a battery change, which seriously hurts the Scuderia‚Äôs chances.\n\nWhatever happens this weekend, though, Leclerc accepts scrutiny on him is going to increase tenfold next year once Hamilton decamps to Maranello.\n\nFormula One‚Äôs most successful driver has endured a torrid final season at Mercedes and many believe Ferrari are splashing out ¬£50 million a year on a busted flush. Hamilton will be 40 by the time Melbourne rolls around next March and\xa0[some of the language he has used recently](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/11/30/qatar-f1-grand-prix-sprint-race-qualifying-latest-live/)\xa0‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely not fast any more‚Äù in Qatar last weekend a notable example ‚Äì had a note of despair about it. But Leclerc does not think so.\n\n‚ÄúI think the boost of motivation he‚Äôll get coming into a team like Ferrari will be crazy,‚Äù he predicts. ‚ÄúLewis is still exceptional. It‚Äôs been a tough season for Mercedes as a team. I think they‚Äôve been struggling with the car, and they explored a little bit like we did for those three races after Monaco, where you are exploring with the set-up, and that doesn‚Äôt help any of the drivers, and that makes it very, very difficult. Confidence is everything in Formula One.\n\n‚ÄúBut I have no doubts at all that I‚Äôll be facing peak Lewis Hamilton, and that it will be an extremely huge challenge.‚Äù\n\n**Full interview:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/12/07/charles-leclerc-ferrari-can-revitalise-lewis-hamilton-2025/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/12/07/charles-leclerc-ferrari-can-revitalise-lewis-hamilton-2025/)', '""He will lose motivated"".']",45,3,0.92,45,2,2,45,3,0.92,45
