For me, I think it will end up being Perez and Jak Crawford. I think they'll want a young driver and a vet. Bottas is probably the best vet available, but it will probably be Perez because he's from Mexico and can bring big sponsor money and a lot of Mexican fans.
And Jak because I think they'll want a young American driver and I don't think that Herta is as strong a connection as it was before.

I think it should be Bottas and Yuki. Yuki doesn't have a contract for next year and even though he's not so young anymore, he still has potential and hasn't gotten the shot he deserves. And Bottas is the best vet available.

And I personally would love for it to be Bottas and Mick Schumacher. This is meant to just be who you would love to see, I know this won't happen, I know that it shouldn't happen, but man I really want to see Mick drive anything other than a Haas. Him and Valterri are my favourite recent drivers.

Let's hear yours!","['One will be a US marketing opportunity (Herta, Palou, O‚ÄôWard)\n\nThe other will be someone loaded with sponsorship money because Cadillac will need that cash injection to start (Zhou, Perez)', 'Who do I think will get them: Checo and Herta\n\nWho do I think should get them: Bottas and Herta\n\nWho do I want to get them: Me and My Buddy', ""I'll be really disappointed if it's checo or ricciardo.

1j74spl,"Can Piastri challenge Norris for the championship? Now, with two years of experience and a couple of wins under his belt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j74spl/can_piastri_challenge_norris_for_the_championship/,2025-03-09, Discussion,"I think there is a chance we could see either a McLaren fight similar to 2007, where both drivers lose the championship to a Ferrari driver by one point, or a Rosberg vs. Hamilton-style battle from 2016‚Äîif the car is miles ahead of everyone else.

Piastri has the talent, but he couldn't deliver every weekend last year. But when he did, he was sometimes even faster than Lando.

However, when Norris had his Singapore-level pace‚Ä¶ nobody could catch him‚Äîexcept himself, almost crashing into the wall.

Can Norris handle the pressure if the car is the fastest and he has bad luck or poor performances? Or maybe we'll see Norris 2.0 with no mistakes, crushing everybody. Or maybe Piastri will get as comfortable as he was in the lower categories, where he won almost every race‚Ä¶

All in all, I'm very excited for the new season! Hopefully, it will be a tight season with more teams fighting for wins than just one.

","['He needs to be consistently faster than Norris, not just challenge him every now and again as he did last year.', 'As a fan of Oscar, I still think there are too many questions that need to be answered. I do believe he‚Äôll improve from last year, but the gap to Lando does feel quite big. \n\nHe can improve tire management but one lap speed is gonna be difficult to improve and the fact that he got zero gp poles last year compared to Lando‚Äôs 8 (!!!) was disappointing. I think it‚Äôs safe to say Lando is all around a faster driver and Oscar will need to give it his all (and pull something out of nowhere) for the entire season to beat him this year.', 'If anything I think last year showed that he simply isn\'t fast enough. I was impressed with his rookie season especially how cold and calculated he is, but it seems he just lacks speed.\n\nAll the ""killer-instinct"" in the world doesn\'t help you if your teammate is consistently 10s ahead of you in the race.', ""I don't think there was any point last year where Piastri was quicker than Norris across the whole race. Maybe 1 or 2 off-weekends..? Exception makes the rule though."", ""I just don't think he has the pace. Too many races where's he's pottering about a pit stop behind Norris.\n\nLook at Baku. He made a great move on Leclerc and won the race so you can't be too critical. But then look at the pace Norris had. Norris would have dominated that race and won it much easier than Piastri did. Good, but not top tier. That sums it up."", '2007 had two evenly matched drivers, and Rosberg was not that far off Lewis.

Absolutely\n\nCan he be a World champion RIGHT NOW when he is going against Norris? No\n\nCan Norris handle the pressure? Yes, i think Abu dhabi last year should have killed all speculation', 'No', 'I don‚Äôt think so. I don‚Äôt think he has the necessary raw speed. \n\nUltimately that‚Äôs still the number 1 requirement for an F1 driver. \n\nPiastri seems stronger mentally. He‚Äôs more aggressive when wheel to wheel and he doesn‚Äôt crack under pressure. None of that matters though when he qualifies behind Lando something like 75-80% of the time.  Then Lando can disappear off into the distance. \n\nIf Piastri can get that qualy ratio to something more like 50/50 then I think he‚Äôd have a great shot.

The question is how many GPs could he take this year? Piastri doesn't want to be a wing man so could be imo the biggest hurdle to clearing well over 10 Ws.

Yeah, Piastri could stick it on pole and drive away, but if he got stuck in the midfield he tended to stay there. \n\nI think if Norris can do what Max did last year and bag 6-7 of the opening 10, then he will stand an excellent chance of winning the title. \n\nPiastri won't want to play second fiddle (and nor should he) so Norris will have to demolish him on track to ensure his support later on in the season."", ""What are these posts lol.\n\nSeason hasn't started yet.
