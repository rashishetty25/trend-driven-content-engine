For me, I think it will end up being Perez and Jak Crawford. I think they'll want a young driver and a vet. Bottas is probably the best vet available, but it will probably be Perez because he's from Mexico and can bring big sponsor money and a lot of Mexican fans.
And Jak because I think they'll want a young American driver and I don't think that Herta is as strong a connection as it was before.

I think it should be Bottas and Yuki. Yuki doesn't have a contract for next year and even though he's not so young anymore, he still has potential and hasn't gotten the shot he deserves. And Bottas is the best vet available.

And I personally would love for it to be Bottas and Mick Schumacher. This is meant to just be who you would love to see, I know this won't happen, I know that it shouldn't happen, but man I really want to see Mick drive anything other than a Haas. Him and Valterri are my favourite recent drivers.

Let's hear yours!","['One will be a US marketing opportunity (Herta, Palou, O’Ward)\n\nThe other will be someone loaded with sponsorship money because Cadillac will need that cash injection to start (Zhou, Perez)', 'Who do I think will get them: Checo and Herta\n\nWho do I think should get them: Bottas and Herta\n\nWho do I want to get them: Me and My Buddy', ""I'll be really disappointed if it's checo or ricciardo.

I did own one, and even got it fucking signed by the man himself a few days before his Monza 2019 win after meeting him at the track, but of course my clumsy self lost that hat the very same evening (or it got swiped, I genuinely don’t know any more, the trauma was that bad)\n\nIt has gotten to the point where I’d pay good money for even an unsigned one, and then I will make it my life mission to go get it signed again, lol.

1j74spl,"Can Piastri challenge Norris for the championship? Now, with two years of experience and a couple of wins under his belt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j74spl/can_piastri_challenge_norris_for_the_championship/,2025-03-09, Discussion,"I think there is a chance we could see either a McLaren fight similar to 2007, where both drivers lose the championship to a Ferrari driver by one point, or a Rosberg vs. Hamilton-style battle from 2016—if the car is miles ahead of everyone else.

Piastri has the talent, but he couldn't deliver every weekend last year. But when he did, he was sometimes even faster than Lando.

However, when Norris had his Singapore-level pace… nobody could catch him—except himself, almost crashing into the wall.

Can Norris handle the pressure if the car is the fastest and he has bad luck or poor performances? Or maybe we'll see Norris 2.0 with no mistakes, crushing everybody. Or maybe Piastri will get as comfortable as he was in the lower categories, where he won almost every race…

All in all, I'm very excited for the new season! Hopefully, it will be a tight season with more teams fighting for wins than just one.

","['He needs to be consistently faster than Norris, not just challenge him every now and again as he did last year.', 'As a fan of Oscar, I still think there are too many questions that need to be answered. I do believe he’ll improve from last year, but the gap to Lando does feel quite big. \n\nHe can improve tire management but one lap speed is gonna be difficult to improve and the fact that he got zero gp poles last year compared to Lando’s 8 (!!!) was disappointing. I think it’s safe to say Lando is all around a faster driver and Oscar will need to give it his all (and pull something out of nowhere) for the entire season to beat him this year.', 'If anything I think last year showed that he simply isn\'t fast enough. I was impressed with his rookie season especially how cold and calculated he is, but it seems he just lacks speed.\n\nAll the ""killer-instinct"" in the world doesn\'t help you if your teammate is consistently 10s ahead of you in the race.', ""I don't think there was any point last year where Piastri was quicker than Norris across the whole race. Maybe 1 or 2 off-weekends..? Exception makes the rule though."", ""I just don't think he has the pace. Too many races where's he's pottering about a pit stop behind Norris.\n\nLook at Baku. He made a great move on Leclerc and won the race so you can't be too critical. But then look at the pace Norris had. Norris would have dominated that race and won it much easier than Piastri did. Good, but not top tier. That sums it up."", '2007 had two evenly matched drivers, and Rosberg was not that far off Lewis. If the car is far ahead of everyone, I expect Lando to run away with the title, with Oscar winning a few races.', 'Can Piastri be a World champion? Absolutely\n\nCan he be a World champion RIGHT NOW when he is going against Norris? No\n\nCan Norris handle the pressure? Yes, i think Abu dhabi last year should have killed all speculation', 'No', 'I don’t think so. I don’t think he has the necessary raw speed. \n\nUltimately that’s still the number 1 requirement for an F1 driver. \n\nPiastri seems stronger mentally. He’s more aggressive when wheel to wheel and he doesn’t crack under pressure. None of that matters though when he qualifies behind Lando something like 75-80% of the time.  Then Lando can disappear off into the distance. \n\nIf Piastri can get that qualy ratio to something more like 50/50 then I think he’d have a great shot. I don’t really see that happening though.']",0,98,0.36,0,92,92,0,0,0.019999999999999962,0
1j76p83,Landomination,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j76p83/landomination/,2025-03-09, Discussion,"Given the gaps he was putting on the field at the end of last year, the confidence jump he seems to have taken, the RB drop off, and (hopefully it's different but yeah) Ferrari challenges my thoughts are Lando could go nuts this year. The question is how many GPs could he take this year? Piastri doesn't want to be a wing man so could be imo the biggest hurdle to clearing well over 10 Ws. Bring on Albert Park!","['Season did not even start yet.', ""No one is going to dominate the beginning of the season like Max has done the last couple of years.\n\nIt'll be between McLaren and Ferrari, but Max is so good that he'll stick it in there as well. And I wouldn't be surprised if Mercedes also start being top contenders after an upgrade."", ""Norris definitely had the edge over Piastri last season. Yeah, Piastri could stick it on pole and drive away, but if he got stuck in the midfield he tended to stay there. \n\nI think if Norris can do what Max did last year and bag 6-7 of the opening 10, then he will stand an excellent chance of winning the title. \n\nPiastri won't want to play second fiddle (and nor should he) so Norris will have to demolish him on track to ensure his support later on in the season."", ""What are these posts lol.\n\nSeason hasn't started yet. Maybe wait and let's all see if that's truly the case. How about that? \n\nThere are other drivers that could definetly pose a challenge to Norris. This championship isn't a given to him lol.

I expect 5+ wins from Lando this year"", 'If he got 4 wins last season, bare minimum if the car is relatively the same as last year pace wise to the rest of the grid, then he should be aiming for at least 7 or 8 wins this year, especially if the gap stays the same or closes marginally to Piastri.', ""I hope this season is a McLaren vs Ferrari classic to rival the likes of '76, '99 and '08."", 'Blessed,  are you new?', 'Lando is not consistent enough to dominate.']",0,55,0.19,0,53,53,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
