we often hear discussions about the current F2 cars not being a good indicator for driver performance in current F1 cars.

How much more support is needed to run N F1 car over an F2 car?\n\nYour idea significant drives up the overhead for an F2 team, and massively disadvantages the teams stuck with the back marker F1 cars…', '\\- Costs will rise  \n\\- Won\'t be a spec series anymore  \n\\- Need more experienced engineers  \n\\- Too many crashes in F1 machinery by inexperienced drivers  \n\\- Jump from F3 to ""F2"" would be too much', ""Doesn't work in practice.\n\nTeams only have a limited number of old cars and most are used for testing.  Hell some teams don't even keep old cars around instead just upgrading carrying it over to the next year with changes.\n\nBuilding 30 F1 cars would also be expensive as all hell for a team that would do it. Alongside engines and having to have spares and parts ready across the whole year.\n\nThis would massively skyrocket the price of F2 seats. Likely killing the series outright.""]",0,42,0.25,0,41,41,0,25,0.04999999999999999,0
