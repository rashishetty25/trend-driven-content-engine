Difficult as in wanting to make sure the terms are to his liking and don't only suit Mercedes. One thing he said recently that stuck with me is that his priority is to win a championship. That says to me that if Mercedes don't give him a car good enough he will want to be able to leave, so it is likely that he will want clauses to that effect. Of course that would mean that if Mercedes don't nail the new regs not only will Verstappen not be interested, but they run the risk of Russell leaving. That is also why I think the 1+1 that is allegedly being offered would be more risky to Mercedes than Russell himself, as long as the 1+1 goes both ways, which I am sure he will make sure it does.\n\nI would have been surprised if Cadillac hadn't approached him as an option.

1mjxmit,2025 Mid-Season Driver Ratings,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mjxmit/2025_midseason_driver_ratings/,2025-08-07, Statistics,"Summer break means time to look at how the model’s driver ratings are shaping up. 2025 has so far not delivered what the second half of 2024 promised. McLaren have been dominant with little chance of anyone else getting involved in the fight. However, 2025 offers some interesting new teammate pairings. The mathematical model seeks to eliminate the factor car by only measuring drivers against their teammates.","[""In defense of the model, it makes itself quite clear that the lack of data for rookies makes it quite hard to give them or their teammates a fair score. And in a season with 6 rookies, that's bound to be a problem."", ""A note with regards to data visualization, don't use smoothed lines for line graphs. Instead use straight connections or stepped connections.  \nSmoothed lines introduce implied datapoints that aren't actually in the data. In your graphs you can particularly see that in the peaks and valleys that happen in-between races.\n\nHere's an example using the Lawson graph with some rough vertical gridlines added. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/bQ6b8SR\nThe second image is an attempt to show how the straight line graph would look.\nIn-between race 11 and 12 the rating drops, but because the smoothed graph has to smooth out the curve, there is an actual peak in-between those two races that implies the actual rating is higher than it is. Inversely, the rating stays approximately the same in-between race 12 and 13, but the graph has a significant drop in-between those two races.\n\nThe lack of vertical gridlines amplify that issue because you can't exactly tell where the individual measurements are, so viewers won't see that the peaks and valleys aren't actual data.\nWith a straight line plot you don't need to have vertical gridlines as the changes in the line show where the data points are, but with smoothed lines you absolutely need them.\n\nOn another note, as you have a scale that goes from 0 to 100, set the y-axis range to 0 to 100. \nThat way you show the data with regards to the full range.\nLawson's graph is another good example for this because he seems to have hit a rating of 10 for races 3 and 4, so the graph implies that he has hit the lowest possible rating.\nAnd because of the smoothed lines it actually looks like the graph goes below 10, making it look like his rating goes into the negative and gets clipped."", 'I clicked on the link first, thought ""this list is pretty decent when you consider the factors, maybe I\'d change one or two things"" then clicked into this thread and was shocked to see the vitriol lol.\n\nIsn\'t it obvious a mathematical model will become more accurate the more data it gets? The bottom half of the ranking is weird, but the top half seems fine. Sure, I\'d probably bump Russell ahead of Albon, but it\'s not like it put Albon at number one or anything truly ridiculous. \n\nA few questions:\n\n1. Have you ever considered doing this for IndyCar? Drivers there have very long tenures, so it might be cool to see how the model rates them over time. I understand if you aren\'t interested in the series though.\n2. What would Leclerc need to do to beat one of Verstappen\'s last five seasons? Would he need to beat his teammates as decisively as Verstappen?\n3. Why does the model project Piastri to improve so much? How do we know he isn\'t near his ceiling? \n\nThanks for the time you put into this. Even if it\'s not 100% reflective of RL, it\'s fun to see how the stats are interpreted by the model.', 'LOL at the meltdowns', ""Sees Albon ranked 3rd, I don't know what you guys are talking about, this model is clearly perfect!"", 'Holy this list is awful, Borteleto and Hadjar below Franco is crazy, Piastri 5th and Norris 6th is hilarious, agree that Albon has been top 5 or close though', ""why are people so mad at this? I don't get it really."", 'Are sprint races included in the model at a third of the weight of a normal race?', 'a very nice season from Leclerc !', ""I'm just here to support you because you're going to get a bunch of hateful comments just for trying something different.\n\n\nI agree that one of the main issues with models like this one is that the model clearly assigns most of the weight to the car and then gets the deviations for each driver. This is a proper way of modelling, but it may not be as accurate. Having said that, in F1 the data is limited and models will always be limited by the amount of data that you can provide to them. You're not doing an experiment, but working with observational data, which is way harder to analyze (much harder than most people will ever understand).\xa0\n\n\nKeep it up.\xa0""]",250,486,0.77,250,3538,3538,3,0,0.0,3

Anyways when he retired my friend was obviously sad, also he gradually quit F1 like first he just started to watch Quali and Race also stopped spending time in f1 communities afterwards he only started to watch races and nowadays he usually just looks up to race results and watches some races if they're promising to be exciting (Silverstone this year for example)

Then Checo joined F1 in 2011 and that made me incredibly excited, so I started following it much more and watching qualys and races more often (sometimes it was too early in Mexico so after a night out I missed those). A turning point was Liberty Media taking over and making it much, much easier to watch F1, so by that point I very rarely missed a race. Checo then joined Red Bull and of course the excitement went through the roof. The last two years were rough though, I didn't want to watch the qualy anymore and just focus on the races, as it was honestly very hard to ignore his downfall.
