It happened on Sunday, June 9, 1957. Car races were also held on the dune circuit that day. In one of them, Willem Adriaan Gerlach, a doctor from the village Appelscha, started in his Porsche 1600 S. Shortly before the end of the race, however, he lost control of the car in the first corner after the Tarzan corner. The car rolled over three times and, according to a journalist from the Leeuwarder Courant, ended up in a potato field.  
  
Gerlach was thrown from the car. Unconscious, the driver was taken to the Sint Elisabethgasthuis hospital in Haarlem. There, his condition proved so serious that he died of his injuries that night.  
  
Gerlach was 47 years old. He had run a general practice in Appelscha since 1940, also serving residents of Fochteloo and Zorgvlied. He left behind a wife and three children. The bend where the fatal accident occurred was later named the Gerlach corner.  
  
The accompanying photo of Gerlach's crashed car appeared in several newspapers on Tuesday, June 11, 1957,  
","[""Other guys that had corners named after them in Zandvoort weren't doing much better in that regard. \n\nThe Slotemakerbocht is named after Rob Slotemaker, who suffered a fatal neck injury in a race at the track in 1979.

I noticed that a lot when the Red Bulls are braking into the pits.

I get why sports cars pop and crackle on startup or when revving, but what exactly causes F1 cars to backfire so much while slowing down?

I realised the video I uploaded was an F2 car, let me see if I could find the F1 cars I recorded.","['That\'s a F2 car, not F1.  The Mecachrome engine is setup to delay the ignition timing on downshifts to intentionally ""backfire"".

People tend to think they don't because we rarely see actual flames, but if you really pay attention during a night race, you will see the flames. The ignition of small amounts of fuel simply just happens deeper inside the exhaust pipe rather than on the edge."", 'Potatoes stuffed in the end of the exhaust.', 'Many categories of high performance ICE power trains backfire, OP.\n\nGo look up the current Cadillac Escalade V', ""This is the answer guys. On F2 cars it's called the anti-lag system, and it's why they shoot flames out the exhaust when downshifting.\n\nIf you watched the F1 movie, this was the biggest giveaway (other than size/proportions) that the APX movie cars were actually F2 and not F1. In fact, rather than painting out the flames in editing, they actually added fake flames to some of the other real F1 cars, presumably for consistency because they liked the dramatic look.""]",54,35,0.71,54,33,33,6,2,-0.030000000000000027,6
