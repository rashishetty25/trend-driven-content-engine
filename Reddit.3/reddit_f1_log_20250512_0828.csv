1kk8pzy,[AMUS] Is this the explanation for the McLaren mystery?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kk8pzy/amus_is_this_the_explanation_for_the_mclaren/,2025-05-11, News,,"['For those not quite completing how a material can have a “stop sign” at a specific temperature, here’s an example:\n\nYou can’t heat water hotter than 100°C (at atmospheric pressure), because the moment it hits 100°C it turns to water vapor via boiling. \n\nMcLaren may be using a solid that melts at a target temp to do the same thing. The solid inside the brake drum liner stops the tire receiving excess heat from the rim because it’s made of/coated in whatever material they’ve designed to melt instead of heating up beyond the target level. \n\nThere are lots of other technical difficulties to overcome, but maybe this comment simplifies some of the main scientific ideas from the article above.', ""Translation:\n\n> **Everyone is puzzling over the McLaren trick. A student may have found the key to the secret with his doctoral thesis. We explain this ingenious idea that could be used to cool tires.**\n\n> Formula 1 has rarely been so confused. The McLaren MCL39 is a fast racing car, but it's not far behind Red Bull and Mercedes in setting a fast lap. Yet it harbors a secret. It's already apparent during the qualifying laps, especially on tracks that put a lot of strain on the tires. The McLarens don't degrade over the lap because the tires stay within the temperature range.\n\n> In races, the Papaya racers are usually in a different league. They can conserve their tires and thus their lap times at a high level. When the tire temperatures of their rivals begin to rise, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris disappear into the distance with a lead of more than a second per lap. Regardless of the tire type. Here, too, the more the track layout, the asphalt, or the external conditions stress the tires, the greater the McLaren advantage.\n\n> This is a completely new quality of superiority. In the past, the competition searched for the key to why the fastest car was so fast. Now they have to figure out why this McLaren has so much endurance. One thing is clear to everyone after the Miami GP. More downforce and stable car balance may be ingredients in the cocktail, but the real secret lies elsewhere.\n\n> **Everyone looks at the brake ventilation.**\nMcLaren's opponents now know where to look. Photos of the brake ventilation systems are piled up on their desks. Sometimes closed, sometimes open. But they reveal nothing. Things only get interesting when the mechanics work on the extremely complex cooling system. But that's exactly when McLaren employees line up in front of the car like footballers at the free-kick wall, and you can't see anything.\n\n> The question of all questions is why mechanics always behave so suspiciously. That might be the answer. The solution might only be found if one could see what the mechanics are changing, adjusting, replacing, or checking. The regulations regarding brake ventilation are relatively clear. The so-called drum, which encloses the entire assembly and is located directly under the rim, is subject to strict regulations regarding its dimensions. However, the air flow inside and the materials used are free.\n\n> A small clue to solving the mystery may have emerged. It could, but doesn't have to, be the key. Eight years ago, a student researched the use of phase-change materials for his doctoral thesis at McLaren. Martin Buchan is now an aerodynamics engineer. He has now shared his knowledge in a\xa0YouTube video\xa0and drawn his own conclusions.\n\n> **Brakes hot and tires cool.**\nBrake vents have two functions. They are designed to cool the brakes, but keep them hot enough for optimal deceleration. They are also designed to quickly heat the tires via the rims, but then keep them within this temperature window for as long as possible. The challenge lies in balancing these two mutual requirements.\n\n> Even with the most skillful approach, the heat radiated by the brakes and the car will transfer to the tires. Especially during a race. Last year, Red Bull suspected that McLaren was filling its tires with water to keep them cool. The FIA \u200b\u200brefuted the suspicion. McLaren was subjected to several thorough inspections. The result was the same every time: This car is legal.\n\n> So there had to be some ingenious trick keeping the brakes hot and the tires cool. A trick that works without sensors, electronics, actuators, or the use of coolant. In other words, a process that runs passively and follows the laws of physics and chemistry. Presumably, McLaren's brake ducts aren't all that different mechanically from those of competitors.\n\n> **The miraculous heat storage.**\nInside the drum-shaped brake linings, there is usually a second sleeve with fins attached that influence the airflow. A channel runs between the two walls, which determines the temperature that the outer casing radiates onto the wheel rim. This is the case with all cars.\n\n> One could now imagine McLaren shielding this channel towards the inner panel with a very special material. A so-called phase-change material, which is also used in batteries, for example, as a heat storage device. The same requirements apply there as for tires. The temperature should rise quickly, but not exceed a certain target.\n\n> In the case of tires, it would work like this: The dissipated braking heat heats up the tire. According to this theory, McLaren would interrupt this process by having the insulating material change its state of matter, for example, from solid to liquid. During this transition, the temperature remains constant despite further external heat input.\n\n> The temperature in the outer drum triggers the phase change. The material used depends on the temperature at which the stop sign must be set. The amount of phase-change material used determines how long the heat is maintained at the desired level. A clever air distribution system can reverse the cooling direction. The brakes are then cooled to a point where the material has resolidified.\n\n> **Evidence for two-phase theory.**\nAdmittedly, this all sounds a bit otherworldly, but it's at least plausible. There's some evidence to support this. For example, Red Bull's disruptive maneuver with water in the tires. Team employees insist they saw moisture on the inside of McLaren's rims on several occasions. But the likely source wasn't the tire, but the brake drum. Perhaps fluid was sweating out during the phase transition.\n\n> It's also interesting to note that Red Bull complained at last year's Austrian GP that McLaren had been driving with temperature sensors on the brake drums. This is only permitted during free practice. According to Red Bull, McLaren did it at least once during the rest of the weekend. If this is true, it could be interpreted as the engineers trying to find out more about the temperatures inside the fairing during a race.\n\n> It's also noticeable that McLaren often performs aggressive long runs in the third free practice session, leaving the competition far behind. Perhaps they're trying to find out under extreme conditions whether everything is working as planned.\n\n> It's obviously no easy task to get this process working. A lot of development and testing goes into it. It looks like McLaren already tried out a precursor to the system after the 2024 summer break. Starting with the Dutch GP, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have excelled, especially in the second half of the races. The competition was already wondering how the two kept their tires in such good condition.\n\n> Even if rivals already know exactly what McLaren is doing, it's not that easy to copy the trick. Red Bull may already have a theory pointing in this direction. Recently, Max Verstappen has been complaining more and more frequently about mysterious braking problems. When asked whether this was related to tire cooling, team boss Christian Horner gave only monosyllabic answers."", 'One thing teams do to fuck with other teams is hide bits to throw off teams and steer them away from what they’re doing. It’s part of the fun and games', 'This is the cool engineering shit that makes AP Calc worth it.', 'So... Is a heatpipe (Like the ones you see in PC coolers) but at a competitive, fast and more secret level?', 'It’s an interesting theory—slush definitely is a useful temperature buffer. I’m somewhat skeptical of the practicalities, however. This is all unsprung weight, and making it heavy should meaningfully impact traction. Can they afford enough buffet material not to saturate over the course of a race?', 'Good read! More information provided! It’s more and more likely phase-changing material is the trick. Let’s see how the whole thing develops. Fun time for the F1 tech world! 😄', ""Interesting read! Very ingeneous. We might never really know if this is the trick to McLaren's success. I hope we will find out someday"", "">It's also interesting to note that Red Bull complained at last year's Austrian GP that McLaren had been driving with temperature sensors on the brake drums. This is only permitted during free practice. According to Red Bull, McLaren did it at least once during the rest of the weekend. If this is true, it could be interpreted as the engineers trying to find out more about the temperatures inside the fairing during a race.\n\nThis has me a bit puzzled, if this is truly not allowed and they actually did it, how didn't a massive DSQ and sporting penalties follow. Just creating your own testing sessions is easily the biggest advantage you can have in a test deprived time like we are in now?\n\nEither the FIA took a massive shit on integrity or it's not true imo""]",1241,223,0.96,1241,3358,3358,79,14,0.0,79

These fucking sleeves are off to narnia while the torso is so tight that leaning forwards causes it to pull at my shoulders\n\nSupposedly fits a 32”-34” hip but my 30” is stretching it. I’ve bought clothes from taobao for $10 with more accurate size guides\n\nAlso, $40 to return it. FORTY FUCKING DOLLARS???', 'Why the hate against Norris ?', '> Usually a XS in F1 gear so I got that from the online store but apparently they fucking hate consistency.  \n  \nEuropean norm for clothing sizes - arms are usually longer than upper body. The S/M/L difference between US and varies heavily - from the states i need to order XL for correct length of T-shirt while in EU 3XL is enough and the US one can fit 2 of me width wise.\nXS pullover sleeve length is usually ~76cm while upper body size is 58cm with a chest width of 52cm and waist width of 44cm', ""I think it stems from his historical comments towards Mercedes having the strongest car so it was easy for Lewis, but then dismissing the fact McLaren have the strongest car now. Like he can't have it both ways. Either Merc were the fastest and it was easy, and therefore it should be easy for him, or the opposite is true, not both ways."", 'Because he was adorable and unthreatening in 2019. People loved him but then he grew up and people didn’t like that. He beat Ricciardo and people hated that because they liked Ricciardo. And he demolished Ricciardo and his confidence grew a bit which made them even more angry. Because you see his personality in 2019 was put on because he didn’t feel like he belonged in F1, people mistook it for weakness and they loved him because he was unthreatening. Forgetting the fact this child had speed run the junior series on his way to F1 but whatever, people really loved him for being adorable and unthreatening. \n\nBut then he got threatening. Turns out the little shit had a lot of natural pace and speed. It was great until he showed it. Then the tables started to turn because people started going ‘oh no what if he beats *my favourite* ? Oh no that can’t happen!’. So adorable Lando Norris became the bogey man, a horrific one at that. They compared him to Nazis (actually true of Twitter), they started to read way too much into his innocent comments which used to make them laugh, now it was a declaration of war. \n\nNow they’ll say shit like ‘I didn’t like him because of what he said about Mercedes’ or ‘I didn’t like him when he said ‘simply lovely’, or ‘I didn’t like him when he said he has no sympathy for Daniel’, or ‘I didn’t like him when he said Vettel should focus on racing in that one episode of Grill the Grid’, or ‘I didn’t like him when he snapped at Lewis even though Lewis defended him, its my right to be offended on Lewis’ behalf’. \n\nAny other driver would have said the same stuff because they have to believe they’re the best. But apparently Lando Norris isn’t allowed to do that. It’s as if he’s discovered a brand new thing by the way people react to stuff that other drivers have and said. He’s also somehow held to a much greater standard than every other driver but that’s a post in itself. \n\nIt all boils down to one thing - you were threatened by him when he stopped being a little kid. His crime was that he grew up and believed he belonged in F1. \n\nDownvote me but you all know it’s true 😂', ""That is just one of the couple of comments he made. Just last race he criticized Max that he ruined his own race by defending Norris so hard, or the 'no talent, all luck' comment (although that was taken very out of context).""]",1,9,0.57,1,6,6,-1,5,-0.18000000000000005,-1
