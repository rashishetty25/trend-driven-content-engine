I am posting this knowing full well this is not how it will turn out. Enjoy.***

**Ferrari - Leclerc (joined for 2019) + Hamilton (joined for 2025)**

\- It's probably going to stay the same as I see no reason why it would not have success. Hamilton retires at the end of the year and Bearman takes his seat.

**Aston Martin - Sainz (joins for 2027) + Russell (joins for 2026)**

\- This is a WHOLE new lineup. Alonso retires at the end of 2026, leading Sainz to replace him at an extremely fast team over at Aston Martin. He was the number 1 choice to replace Alonso in 2025 if he left for a different team, and he is an incredibly fast driver. Russell is another fast driver. I guess that Aston Martin misses out on Verstappen because Mercedes offers a slightly better package and maybe decides to finally join the WEC Hypercar Frenzy. giving Verstappen a future with the team after F1. As a result, George Russell becomes a free agent and a no-brainer for Aston to sign as their next best option.

**Redbull - Piastri (joins for 2026) + Lawson (joined for 2025)**

\- Redbull-Ford powertrains are expected to start on the back foot. With this in mind, Verstappen decides to leave the team for 2026, and join Mercedes. As a result, they need a replacement and convince Piastri to leave Mclaren after tensions between him and Norris boil over resulting in Papaya rules and team orders favoring their lead driver (Norris).

**Mercedes - Verstappen (joins for 2026) + Antonelli (joined in 2025)**

\- Toto Wolff finally gets his perfect driver lineup of Max Verstappen and Andrea Kimi Antonelli. Although a hard decision, it had to be done. Max decides to approach Toto and is signed on a massive deal. Mercedes joins the Hypercar class of the WEC giving him a future with the German team and marque beyond F1. Antonelli continues to develop as a driver.

**Williams - Browning (joins for 2027) + Albon (joined for 2022)**

\- As a replacement for Carlos Sainz, Williams ends up opting for Luke Browning as a junior driver. This once again makes Albon the senior figure within the team, who hopes to continue Williams's upward trajectory.

**Cadillac - Bottas (joins for 2026) + Herta (joins for 2026)**

\- Cadillac enters the frenzy and needs to decide on drivers. Herta manages to get enough Superlicense points and is a shoo-in as their American rookie. They elect to choose Bottas as their experienced hand, due to his experience with Ferrari power units and serving as a Mercedes reserve driver in 2025.

**Hitech GP (Alpine leaves for Hitech in 2026) - Colapinto (joins for mid-2025) + Gasly (joined in 2023)**

**-** Pierre Gasly is their current lead driver and with the team on an upward trend and switching to Mercedes power units, its a no-brainer to continue with the team, he elects to stay with the team for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, Doohan is sacked after just 6 races due to Colapinto offering more sponsorship money, and he joins the team on a multiple-year contract.

**Mclaren - Norris (joined for 2019) + Tsunoda (joins for 2026)**

\- After losing Oscar Piastri to Redbull, Mclaren decide to establish a clear 1-2 lineup, and opt to sign Yuki Tsunoda for the 2026 season. This is alongside regular title contender Lando Norris.

**Haas/Toyota - Ocon (joined for 2025) + Bearman (joined for 2025)**

\- Haas chooses to retain their lineup of Esteban Ocon and Oliver Bearman. However, where as Ocon is a permanent fixture, Bearman will get the call up to Ferrari for 2028 following the retirement of Lewis Hamilton. As a result, Haas, who have recently announced that they will be the basis of a Toyota return, are likely to picked a driver backed by Gazoo Racing.

**Audi - Hulkenberg (joined for 2025) + Bortoleto (joined for 2025)**

\- Audi chooses to stick to their lineup of Hulkenberg and Bortoleto. Hulkenberg has done a good job developing the car and the team is heading in the right direction. Bortoleto is showing more and more to be the future of the team, as Hulkenberg prepares to end his chapter in formula 1 and retire as an Audi driver and brand ambassador at the end of the year.

**VCARB - Lindblad (joins for 2026) + Hadjar (joined for 2025)**

**-** VCARB keeps their lineup of Hadjar, who was signed following the Lawson promotion, and Lindblad, who was signed following the departure of Yuki Tsunoda. While Hadjar is seen as a reasonable driver, Lindblad is the focus of the team, as he is predicted to be Redbull's next World Champion.","[""I'll have whatever he's having."", 'Smoking on that loud pack', 'https://preview.redd.it/twz7jkd3cvhe1.jpeg?width=342&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed3384d410aa7992d6314ebc0357b0f70ebeaa17\n\nYou are higher than Travis Scott will ever be in a room', ""I can take wild predictions, but OP, Tsunoda to McLaren might be the wildest prediction I have ever heard from somebody since the time I have heard somebody predicting that Guardiola will move to Manchester United.
