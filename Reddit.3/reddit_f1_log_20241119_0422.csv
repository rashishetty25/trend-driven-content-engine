[The first historic group presentation is already set for 18 February](https://autoracer.it/it/f1-a-londra-un-grande-evento-di-lancio-della-stagione-2025/) even if it will only be the liveries and the great manoeuvres for the new set-ups of the various racing teams have already begun. Among the racing teams, **Ferrari** has [already made it clear](https://x.com/MuseiFerrari/status/1857455148869587089) that [the 2025 single-seater will be unveiled at a separate event](https://autoracer.it/it/ferrari-non-presentera-la-monoposto-2025-a-londra-non-sara-lunica/), and so will the other top teams. On the subject of the market, there are still some missing pieces in the chessboard for next season, such as the future of Colapinto and the knots at Red Bull, but 2025 can already be considered the year of revolution.\n\n**Abu Dhabi test: on track Arthur Leclerc and Antonio Fuoco, reserve driver pair 2025**\n\nBefore that, however, there will be another step after the Abu Dhabi race that will close the 2024 world championship, namely post-season testing. Very willingly, **Ferrari has given the go-ahead for Carlos Sainz** to test the Williams in Abu Dhabi after the last round of the championship. It will thus be the beginning of a new partnership with Alexander Albon, a pair that in the announcement Williams described as one of the most formidable on the grid. **Lewis Hamilton, on the other hand, will not be present with Ferrari**, being unable to leave before 31 December. A question of opportunity after a great history and very complex contractual agreements. Nevertheless, Lewis Hamilton awaits the red car, like the most beautiful Christmas present, and **Ferrari has already planned what will be his ‘entrance** ’ to Maranello (we will analyse the plan). One will also have to wait to see **Kimi Antonelli** with Mercedes, the 18-year-old Italian called to Toto Wolff's court. The wait is also growing for **Gabriel Bortoleto**, Brazilian, F3 champion and F2 leader who will debut with Sauber (Audi), as well as **Liam Lawson**, with a future still to be decided between Red Bull and Racing Bulls.\n\n**Esteban Ocon** will be at Haas as early as testing, leaving Jack Doohan free to get into the Alpine for his first kilometres as a Formula 1 driver, while waiting to find out if the positive rumours about him are true, given how well he is spoken of by those who have seen him grow in the junior categories. Everyone is also waiting to see who will win the constructors‘ championship, given that the drivers’ one is certain. **Ferrari, still in the fight, is not worried about rushing Lewis** and is meanwhile thinking about what set-up to give the team in the future. Antonio Giovinazzi is currently confirmed as a reserve driver. With him will also be **Arthur Leclerc**, who will spend more time on the track, forming a pair of reserve drivers as happened this year. It is understood that it will be the young Monegasque who will take part in FP1 in Abu Dhabi, for a special session with his brother Charles. In the rookie tests, on the other hand, which will also take place in Abu Dhabi, Arthur and Antonio Fuoco are both the main candidates to run kilometres on track. Fuoco, moreover, has recently driven the F1-75 and is the other driver who remains in the Cavallino's F1 orbit as a specialist in the Maranello simulator.\n\n**Ollie Bearman**, formerly a Haas driver, running three races this year, one with Ferrari and two with the American team, has lost his rookie status and will not be able to be employed in this role. On the other hand, there is no suggestion that Ferrari has evaluated **Gunayu Zhou** as a reserve driver. According to reports, the Chinese driver is not on the Scuderia's shortlist of names for the F1 project. It is not ruled out that the Scuderia will consider a third name as a reserve driver, should non-F1 commitments prevent Arthur Leclerc and Antonio Giovinazzi from being available, with appropriate evaluations underway. After a year in which no driver has moved, we are about to experience almost a revolution, between a legend joining the legend and the many young people who will create one of the greatest generational replacements in recent years.

1gu4rbi,Exclusive: Ferrari in Las Vegas with a new wing and an experimental floor,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gu4rbi/exclusive_ferrari_in_las_vegas_with_a_new_wing/,2024-11-18, News,,"['Experimental…. Is it armoured against man hole covers?', 'The manhole covers of Vegas yearn for the experimental floor', ""Translation \n\n\nWith three races to go, McLaren must defend a 36-point lead over Ferrari and 49 over Red Bull , Mercedes had recovered many points in the summer but the threat has quickly deflated. It can be a lot or a few, depending on your perspective. After the start of the season, it was unpredictable to see a Red Bull suffering for 10 races. However, the internal war between Horner and the Austro-Dutch faction had undermined its stability and perhaps its technical clarity . Huge figures such as Newey and Wheatly have left or will gradually leave the team. Some experienced designers and specialist engineers have moved to Ferrari , the recruitment campaign for the 2026 engine was good but did not take away big figures from the competition. Verstappen, Marko and Horner have signed an indefinite truce to at least secure the drivers' title.\n\n\nMcLaren found itself stronger than observers (and even itself) had predicted . Despite several errors of maturity (but it was not the only one this year) it can return to success after 27 years. After Interlagos the team could see the pressure on Lando Norris eased, now with very low chances of bothering Verstappen, which on the one hand cannot be considered positive but on the other it could prove useful to better express its important speed. Red Bull has shown signs of improvement but the Woking car starts as a contender for victory in two out of three races. The task of Ferrari, who finds itself the first pursuer, is not easy and it is not impossible . Not to mention variables out of control such as temperatures and complex conditions, competitiveness in races such as Abu Dhabi and Lusail will fundamentally depend on the position in qualifying. The SF-24 overall was not able to do well on a single lap or at low track temperatures . The situation has improved a lot with the changes in Monza, but it could not be resolved in every condition.\n\n\nExclusive: In Las Vegas, Ferrari will test an experimental chassis useful for the 677 project.\n\n\n\n“If we find something (in the tunnel) we will try it,” Vasseur had said. In fact, the most important updates have been completed, however Ferrari will have a specific experimental underlay available for Friday’s free practice, useful for correlating the new 2025 car . For budget cap reasons, being a component useful only for testing, in America there will be only one underlay that, according to the plans, both drivers will have the opportunity to try for a run. It is certainly a way to verify some steps forward in the implementation of the basic underlay of the 677 model , which will also have a much more advanced design than the current one. Nonetheless, no one is confident that they have definitively stifled the hopping, the engineers want to make sure they continue development with a good anti-porpoising metric (thanks to the Monza spec) in the most sensitive areas.\n\n\nThe real novelty in Las Vegas will be the availability of a front wing that is lighter than the Monza specification (which will be present) that can be used if the track offers satisfactory levels of grip. On the rear, however, the technicians will choose the best option between the SPA and Monza specifications. Ferrari does not have a PU change in its starting program on Leclerc's no. 16. In Brazil, qualifying and the wet race, exceptionally performed on the same day, allowed the Monegasque's freshest unit to be saved stress and km of degradation. The technicians plan to continue the rotations within the elements of the available pool.  This year there will not be a full white and red livery as happened on the SF-23, we will see a small distinctive note. The drivers' and mechanics' uniforms will also feature a logo to commemorate the launch of 'Gladiator II' . The Maranello team knows that the very fast Las Vegas track represents the best opportunity of the three remaining to close the gap on McLaren."", 'Lewis seeing the “experimental” Ferrari go P1 in the H.M.S Silver Arrow: *Interesting*', 'If the wing is lighter than the upgrade brought in Monza, I can only hope it works for a track like Las Vegas, which I am still trying to discern whether it could *(and probably, so does the team, given that it will be tested for a bit to assess their chances)*. \n\nStill, I am optimistic for their chances!

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‘round racing friend, for the latest batch of team updates, driver buzz, technical adventures and trackside stats is ready and waiting for you…

[*Throttle & Tread’s*](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/) thirteenth edition of *Last Week in Formula 1* has arrived.

Before leaving the garage, [you can catch up on last week’s issue here.](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-november-4-2024)

If you’re a rookie ‘round these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly feature courtesy of *Throttle & Tread* recapping the most recent interesting and important goings-on in the Formula 1 world.

In the perfection-seeking spirit of F1, *Last Week in Formula 1* and *Throttle & Tread* are in a constant state of development. So any feedback you have on what’s covered, the format, or anything I missed is welcome in the comments. 

And if you, like me, enjoy pretty things…

You can have the pretty-with-pictures version of *Last Week in Formula 1*, along with *Throttle & Tread’s* *Briefings* and *Race Track Rundowns,* delivered safely into your inbox [by subscribing to *Throttle & Tread* on Substack.](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/)

Now let’s get down to business…

\~\~\~

# Trackside Stats

Lol, shit—courtesy of u/F1GuyDan, we now know that if Red Bull used Max Verstappen as a one-driver team, [they would have finished in the same place in the WCC standings every season of Max’s career, except for 2017 and 2022.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goz9xv/f1guydan_if_red_bull_used_max_verstappen_as_a/)

u/F1GuyDan also served up a Reddit specialty—finding new ways to express how disappointing Sergio Pérez has been this year: [We’ve learned he’s closer to Zhou in the standings (who has 0 points) than Max, Charles, and Lando.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqx3zh/f1guydan_guanyu_zhou_is_closer_to_sergio_perez_in/)

**More on Max’s dominance:** [Here’s how he can win his 4th WDC title in Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1go8419/how_max_can_become_champion_in_las_vegas/)

And speaking of fast drivers, [here’s 2024’s Fastest Lap standings as of Brazil…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gorxqs/fastest_laps_2024/)

Along with [2024’s ‘podium’ (so far) for top 5 finishes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpq39z/rn365_top_5_finishes_2024/)

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

Welp, this *should* put to bed any further rumours of where Checo will be next year. [Apparently Sith Lord Christian Horner has given the okay to Perez’s sponsors that he’ll be driving for the main team next year, as per his contract.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gopmsh/marca_checo_p%C3%A9rez_is_not_moving_and_will_start/) 

Unrelated to anything of consequence, but a driver musing nonetheless, [Guenther Steiner had some blunt, choice words on the subject of Lance Stroll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goesf1/guenther_steiner_on_lance_stroll/)

Carlos Sainz was honoured by the Scuderia Ferrari Club in Maranello, [given a plaque that reads, *“Wherever you go, we will continue rooting for you. You’ve entered our hearts, and you’ll stay there.”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplue3/motorsport_last_night_carlos_sainz_was_honored_by/) Hey I’m not crying… You’re crying!

In a twist that caught me off guard but makes sense when you consider historical ties, [Zhou Guanyu—a former Ferrari Driver Academy padawan—is expected to become Scuderia Ferrari’s Reserve Driver for 2025.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gskr71/zhou_guanyu_is_expected_to_be_scuderia_ferraris/) Bravo Zhou!

On the subject of reserve drivers, while there’s no media confirming Mick Schumacher’s recent bit of vague-gramming, [I’d hazard a guess *this* means his time as Mercedes’ reserve is over](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gtcojc/mick_sumachers_instagram_post/), paving the way for King Valtteri’s return.

For those interested in the goings-on of recently departed F1 drivers, [Logan Sargeant has done a seat fitting with IndyCar team Meyer Shank Racing,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp3hj7/otmeyer_shank_racing_step_1_seat_fit_logan/) ahead of what I assume will be a test with the team. As an IndyCar fan who watches all the races, Logie Bear better start sharpening his elbows…

While we’re on the subject of IndyCar, [Romain Grosjean is scrambling to stay on the grid next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp7c4a/grosjean_scrambling_to_stay_on_indycar_grid_in/) Alas, his classic form of oscillating abruptly between high peaks and low lows while collecting a trophy case of crashes won’t help.

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

In a surprising turn of juicy events—that will affect all teams in one way or another—[F1’s Race Director Niels Wittich has been fired](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gppllt/panning_photo_of_charles_in_the_rain_during_q3/) ([rather than stepping down, as the FIA have claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplmhc/jennie_gow_breaking_niels_wittich_to_step_down_as/)). With only three race weekends remaining in 2024, the timing seems rather odd. I daresay we can add another name to the list of those butting heads with FIA head Mohammed Ben Sulayem.

*But ‘ol Rotten Eggs Benny Boy didn’t stop there…* [FIA Compliance Officer Paolo Basarri was also fired last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gr8pxe/bbc_sport_paolo_basarri_leaves_role_as_fia/) Which is *curious,* as Basarri happens to be the official who compiled a report into allegations that Sulayem interfered with operations during two races in 2023. [I think I smell a rat dictator?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ALZTuyM7lg)

In a similar vein, Greg Maffei, president and CEO of F1’s commercial rights holder, Liberty Media, [will leave his role at the end of the year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqd2ir/racefans_on_bluesky_greg_maffei_president_and_ceo/) I daresay we’re starting to see some effects of the FIA-FOM power struggle that’s been quietly reaching a boil since Mohammed took over the FIA leadership.

*The firings will continue until morale improves:* Aston Martin Technical [Director Dan Fallows, who was poached from Red Bull with great fanfare and high expectation, has been let go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpjono/dan_fallows_will_no_longer_serve_as_technical/) Current Aston Martin Executive Director [Bob Bell, a highly regarded design engineer who I’ve never heard of, will fill in as TD on a temporary basis](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpkypa/bbc_executive_director_bob_bell_a_highly_regarded/) (I presume until Lord Newey is able to start drawing in British Racing Green). Daddy Stroll must be losing patience…

Well folks, in case you had any lingering doubts or were clinging to shreds of hope, Renault’s F1 engine program is officially *done.* [Alpine have confirmed their switch to Mercedes’ engine and gearbox from 2026.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpioxc/f1_breaking_alpine_announce_they_will_switch_to_a/) In celebration of their storied success, [here’s a collage of all the championships they powered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpm4t9/so_long_renault_engines_heres_the_wccs_wdcs_they/)

*I was surprised when this one appeared in my timeline…* F1 is working on a proposed 2026 rule change that’ll make life harder for customer teams like Toro Tauri VCARB or Haas: [If a team finishes P5 or higher in the WCC, they have to design all non-listed parts on their own after a period of three years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gru00i/tobi_gr%C3%BCner_formula_1_is_working_on_a_rule_change/) I can’t imagine this idea will go down well or smoothly…

In a related-and-exciting bit of news for Haas, while insisting have no plans to build an F1 engine, [Toyota wants to give Haas independence from Ferrari](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gsioi5/toyota_wants_to_give_haas_independence_from/) as they settle into supporting the project on the aerodynamics side.

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

The fine folks at [Ferrari appear to believe that F1’s wind tunnel time allocation rules (the worse you’re doing, the more time you get) will be a game changer for the 2026 regulation overhaul.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goofx4/why_ferrari_thinks_f1s_wind_tunnel_rules_could_be/) Their notion of course being that teams not fighting for the championship will self-sabotage/withhold resources in the first half of 2025 in order to get maximum wind tunnel time ahead of 2026.

There was an F1 Commission meeting last Wednesday, [in which they seem to have settled on a few items, courtesy of trusty F1 insider Chris Medland:](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqiv4p/chrismedlandf1_the_f1_commission_meeting_today/)

* A spec driver cooling kit for when a heat hazard is declared has been approved from next season onwards.  
* Yet-to-be-known tweaks for how the starting grid will close up when a team withdraws a car have been agreed upon.  
* And the post-Abu Dhabi rookie sprint race is slated for a 2026 debut.

# This Week in Formula 1 History

**Brazil, 2018.** [Esteban Ocon collides with Max Verstappen, causing him to lose the lead of the race](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp9wzr/throwback_to_2018_brazilian_gp_when_ocon_collided/)—leading to some spicy interactions in the paddock.

**Macau, 2014.** [A young Max Verstappen finished 7th in the Macau Grand Prix after starting in 24th](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gsltl7/today_10_years_ago_max_verstappen_raced_in_the/)—a mighty impressive feat on a fast, twisty street circuit.

Formula 1 old heads and purists rejoice! [The Monaco Grand Prix has extended their contract with F1 through 2031.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gr1ih7/monaco_grand_prix_contract_extended_to_2031/) Take *that* fears of falling off the calendar!
