•⁠  ⁠Cumulative season ratings are calculated by averaging each outlet’s scores across all races.

•⁠  ⁠For ""P1 w/ Matt & Tommy"", the values are the average of Matt & Tommy’s individual scores.

•⁠  ⁠Colours represent each driver’s ranking (1–20) within that column, from green (highest) to purple (lowest).",[],8,0,0.64,8,0,0,7,0,0.10999999999999999,7
