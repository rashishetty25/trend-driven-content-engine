The British team is set to welcome Nick Roberts, a former senior strategy engineer at Racing Bulls with over a decade of experience within the Red Bull organisation.\n\nPlanetF1 revealed signing of Nick Roberts is a new development in Aston Martin's reorganisation, following the announcement in March of the arrival of Adrian Newey as technical managing partner. The legendary designer is already working on the AMR26, a car that will have to adapt to new regulations including sustainable fuels, active aerodynamics, and a high degree of electrification.\n\nRoberts will officially join the team in 2026, once his gardening period is over. During this period, Aston Martin will prepare to integrate his expertise into race decision-making; he will report directly to Peter Hall, the team's head of strategy.\n\nRoberts' departure from Racing Bulls came earlier than expected. He confirmed this on social media with a light-hearted message, saying that for the first time in ten years he would be able to follow the season 'as a fan'. However, he accompanied the announcement with a green heart emoji, clearly hinting at his next destination.\n\nThis move is not an isolated one. In June, Aston Martin brought in Giles Wood, a former colleague of Adrian Newey's at Red Bull, to bolster the simulation and modelling departments. Wood's appointment was a direct response to criticism of the reliability of the team's simulation tools by Newey himself after their first appearance on the track in Monaco.\n\nWith the addition of Nick Roberts, another experienced figure from the Red Bull family, Aston Martin is further reinforcing its ambition to be in contention for victories from 2026, the year in which it will also debut its partnership with Honda as a power unit supplier.\n\nRoberts' departure coincides with a period of transition at Red Bull. The Austrian team is preparing to say goodbye to Will Courtenay, its veteran head of strategy, who will join McLaren in 2026. Until then, Hannah Schmitz, currently the senior strategy engineer, will take over his responsibilities.\n\nMeanwhile, Racing Bulls has restructured its strategy department by promoting Guillaume Ducreux, who will work alongside Matthieu Dubois. Both have previous experience at Alpine.\n\nNick Roberts' arrival represents much more than just a new signing. His in-depth knowledge of Red Bull's processes, both on the track and in talent development, will be a valuable asset as Aston Martin looks to join the elite.\n\nWith Adrian Newey at the helm of the technical side of things and a strengthened strategic structure, the Silverstone-based team is aiming to become one of the major players in the new Formula 1 cycle."", 'Love Newey but I‚Äôll never support that team as long as Larry is involved.
