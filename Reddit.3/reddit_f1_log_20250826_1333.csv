1n0gwl2,"Looking at mid-season ratings, do you still think that results from 2024 F2 are not representative of rookies performance?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n0gwl2/looking_at_midseason_ratings_do_you_still_think/,2025-08-26, Discussion,"I will preface by saying that I know it has been just 14 races and things could change in the future. At the same time however, it is enough to draw some conslusions.

In 2024 there were many discussions about how we shouldn't look to much into 2024 F2 results. This notion applied almost exclusively  to Prema, because both of its overhyped drivers had underwhelming rusults. (in comparison to expactations). Also both of their drivers were set to join F1 basically from the beginning of that year. So it seemed easier to blame the team than to acknowledge that the Prema boys might have been underperformimg. Meanwhile rookies like Bortoleto and Hadjar were barely talked about. 

As for now, after 14 races it seems that the F2 2024 standings generally reflect the order, in which rookies are rated on F1 grid. Moreover I still kinda don't understand, how some people are surprised that Bortoleto (literally F3 and F2 back to back champion) is doing that well. ","[""Your first mistake is assuming that people know Bortoleto was a back to back champion. Most people watching F1 turn the TV on just before the race starts, and maybe just before qualifying starts and that's it, and that extends to people posting on here"", 'look at how the status of the 2018 F2 title challengers in during the mid season break in 2019\n\nF2 champion Russell: languishing in the back in a Williams\n\nF2 Runner up Norris: showing strong potential in a Mclaren against Carlos Sainz\n\nF2 3rd place Albon: Promoted to Red Bull Racing\n\nmaybe its still too early to know, all three drivers have done well but the pecking order between them is more clear now 5 years later', 'It’s way too soon to say. I think you can’t really judge the quality of a F2 grid until 5 years later when you see what they all went to achieve elsewhere. \n\nHadjar is actually a good example of F2 results not always being representative of talent. He finished P14 in his rookie F2 season behind his teammate who was also a rookie. At the time many people questioned why Red Bull didn’t drop him, especially since his teammate was also a RB driver and he did get dropped. He changes teams and there’s a new car and suddenly he challenges for the title. Now he’s doing a great job in F1 and those same people who questioned him are now applauding him.\n\nOllie and Kimi were also not the only favourites underperforming last year. Victor Martins was a F3 champion and had a good rookie year, yet last year he was absolutely nowhere. Taylor Barnard was highly rated and yet got comprehensively beaten by his teammate who people didn’t rate that highly. He left to go do FE and did an amazing job there.\n\nSo the flaws of the F2 championship were somewhat exaggerated last year because favourites weren’t doing well, but that doesn’t mean those flaws don’t exist. The truth is that there is no objective way to judge junior drivers against each other, so it often comes down to right place right time. I don’t think any of the rookies are drowning right now, so I don’t think there are any that shouldn’t be there. Of course you can question how someone else would be doing in their shoes, but those what-ifs have always been there and will always be there.', ""I do think people really underestimate how representative F2 can be, especially last year. In general because it was a new car we didnt really have a best team, some teams figured out the car quicker but it was peaky from many. So that aspect did make it hard to truly understand the order, though I think people did over blow it just because the pre-season favourites in Kimi and Bearman struggled.\n\nI think generally the top drivers in any given season are the top drivers for a reason. Many can say its car and team setup, but you still need to be good enough to make sure you maximise that chance. This is the same in every category, its naive to think everywhere is completely equal. For sure that can make it easy to dismiss certain results, but its unfair to really downplay a driver when they are performing in my opinion.\n\nWhat Hadjar and Bortoleto have shown this season is there's a good reason why they were the ones that fought for the title. So yeah, I do think it adds some weight to the championship when they are performing."", ""Yes and no. Bortoleto and Hadjar, were top two last year, and are arguably the two best rookies this season so far, so in that regard, this was extremely representative. But I can't sit here and pretend that Bearman was only the 12th best driver, especially after his performances at Haas and even his sole outing for Ferrari. It's a bit frustrating, really, how inconclusive that championship often is."", 'Antonelli sadly  is driving exactly like in F2, incredible inconsistent.', ""Watching f2 last year, it was so clear to me that Bortoleto was the best driver. Kimi might have more potential because tbh, I don't know how to judge that without access to data etc, but Bortoleto was definitely the stand out. \n\nI'm ready for that audi to be good next year"", 'Yes, I still think the results were unrepresentative, with Bearman as a prime example. He has been quietly excellent this year; his points tally is mediocre because he keeps finishing 11th but he has been matching the far more experienced Ocon on pace. \n\nBear in mind that Bearman was regularly getting poles and wins in his debut F2 year in 2023, and was probably the fastest driver on the grid in terms of qualifying pace, but then was suddenly nowhere in 2024 despite staying at the same team. This makes no sense from a driver perspective; I find it impossible to believe he just got way slower for no reason in the space of a few months. The issue was clearly with the team.\n\nNone of this is to say that I am surprised by Bortoleto, by the way. He absolutely deserved the championship last year and has been fantastic so far this year.', ""Yeah it was unrepresentative imo. Anyone who was convinced Bortoleto would fail wasn't paying attention, but that's not really an argument for F2 being representative. He's 1 driver, you can easily make the opposite argument with Bearman. Bearman finished 12th in F2 last year, he was nowhere near the 12th best driver on that grid.

Red Bull denies interest in the superstar. Will Briatore now make his move?\n\nThere is intense speculation in the USA that IndyCar superstar Álex Palou could join Max Verstappen at Red Bull Racing in 2026. With four titles and a victory at the Indy 500, the Spaniard has achieved everything in motorsport. The only thing missing is the premier class.\n\nThere, Palou's F1 dream seemed to have been dashed for the time being. In 2022, he wanted to join McLaren and even tested for the British team in Austin. But in the end, he stayed with Chip Ganassi Racing and created legal chaos by signing several contracts. McLaren is still demanding compensation.\n\nPalou dominates US Formula 1 – will he now become Verstappen's teammate?\n\nOne thing is certain: for five years, Palou has been the benchmark in ‘American Formula 1’. He won the title in 2021, 2023, 2024 and 2025, and this year he added the long-awaited victory at the Indy 500. He has long been a superstar in America. In Formula 1, however, he has been left out in the cold – until now.\n\n**According to IndyStar, a newspaper based in Indianapolis, Red Bull is seriously interested. Sources report that Palou could join the team alongside Verstappen in 2026.**\n\n**However, this time there is no fire where there is smoke.** [**F1-Insider.com**](http://F1-Insider.com) **has learned that Red Bull has no interest in the Spaniard and that the rumours are coming from Palou's busy manager, former Ferrari team boss Daniele Audetto.**\n\nPalou wants victories and titles\n\nPalou himself is also playing down the rumours. After his Indy 500 triumph, he said: ‘Why should I waste three or four years with a team that can't win? I want victories and championships.’\n\nHowever, he was referring primarily to F1 newcomer Cadillac. He did not mention a top team like Red Bull. And his contract with Ganassi contains an exit clause.\n\nInterest from Alpine?\n\nThe Alpine team, led by cult team boss Flavio Briatore, is genuinely interested. The Italian is looking for a driver to replace Argentine Franco Colapinto in 2026, whom Briatore wants to get rid of after mediocre performances. The two ‘oldies’ Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez have declined, both having signed with newcomer Cadillac.\n\nAnother factor in Palou's favour is that Briatore works closely with F1 superstar Fernando Alonso, who in turn is a mentor to his compatriot Palou.\n\nOne argument in favour of Alpine is that the French team will be ditching the underperforming Renault engine in 2026 and will be racing with the supposedly more powerful Mercedes power units. That could at least give the four-time IndyCar champion pause for thought. In any case, he is unlikely to become Verstappen's teammate.\n\nAuthors: Bianca Garloff, Ralf Bach\n\n*Translated with* [*DeepL.com*](https://www.deepl.com/?utm_campaign=product&utm_source=web_translator&utm_medium=web&utm_content=copy_free_translation) *(free version)*"", 'to gauge sponsors reactions']",0,11,0.47,0,11,11,0,11,0.47,0
