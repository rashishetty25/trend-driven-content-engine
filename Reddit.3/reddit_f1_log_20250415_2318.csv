1jzint0,The new “Radio Rewind” series on F1’s Youtube channel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jzint0/the_new_radio_rewind_series_on_f1s_youtube_channel/,2025-04-15, Discussion,"There’s been a noticeable change in F1’s video format on YouTube. In the past couple of years, F1 consistently uploaded “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 Onboards” for every race weekend. It was a very good format and fans for the most part are enjoying it. However, this year they’ve completely dropped these two series in favor of “Radio Rewind.”

Now, “Radio Rewind” isn’t exactly new — it was typically used for classic races like Malaysia 2012, Canada 2011, Australia 2010, and Hungary 2006. But it seems like they now plan to make one for every race weekend.

Normally, I wouldn’t complain about it. I mean, it’s basically a combination of “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 (or even more) Onboards” in a single video. However, after the first few races, I have to say I’m not a fan of this new format.

First of all, it only focuses on the race (or the sprint, if there is one), completely leaving out practice sessions and qualifying. That’s a huge shame, because there are often a lot of interesting or funny team radios — or even crashes — that get missed.

Secondly, there’s the issue many fans have pointed out: the lack of subtitles for the team radio. Personally, I find this absurd. Formula 1 team radio has never been known for its clarity, so without subtitles, it’s really hard to understand what’s being said — especially when it comes to technical terms.

I’m not sure why they’ve chosen this direction. Maybe it’s to push out more videos per race weekend, but so far, it seems fans and viewers aren’t happy with it. The comment section under the latest Bahrain GP “Radio Rewind” video was filled with people asking F1 to bring back the old format — separating the onboards and team radio into two separate videos, just like last year.

So what do you think of this new format? Do you like it, or do you also want to go back to the old one?","[""Yeah it's bad. Seems like a cost cutting measure to me.\n\nBut 90% of the comments on those videos are people complaining, so I'm sure they know."", 'And the captions were not just for better understanding, they would add fun little effects to it like shaking when driver was shouting, or text bouncing when the car was porpoising', '""maybe it\'s to push out more videos per race weekend"" \n\nbut theyre doing the opposite? 2023 we used to get radio rewind, top 10 onboards and post-race radio of every driver. now it\'s condensed in one video.', 'I do miss the post-race radio of every driver.', 'I miss the ""Every Diver\'s Radio at the End of Their Race""', 'Radio rewind was there up to the 2022 season, there were some bangers in there', 'I miss top 10 onboards.

If there\'s many drivers that are competitive, we really should not focus on 1 entire lap of a driver. \n\nI know it\'s an incredible hard job, and they also have some very good direction sometimes, but these are some very consistent annoyances that I think a lot of people share.
