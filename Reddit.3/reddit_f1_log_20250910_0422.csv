I think the top teams besides McLaren seem to have drivers that are the clear favorite. Russel at Mercedes, Max at Red Bull, Charles in Ferrari. I think you could maybe argue Kimi next year and Hamilton might improve but that’s an interesting if.

Towards the midfield the Williams pair I think are a clear favorite. Albon and Sainz in a battle would be intense. I think it’s clear to say Albon has proved he is good enough to match and beat Carlos, now if in a title battle Albon might fall to pressure more than Carlos? I think that’s a question that still means a fight would go long between the two.

Honorable mentions, Haas I think would have some really interesting veteran versus fast young kid. We will see if 2026 has an underdog story or a top team nailing it or if we’re lucky a close front two teams and a title battle! :)","['I would be thoroughly entertained by a Charles and Lewis inter team battle if we were in a reality where Ferrari was not burdened by itself. I think I’d mostly want to see it because I’m actually not entirely certain how an outright season long battle would go between the two of them, at least in terms of how they would personally react and behave.

1ncomu6,Thought experiment with Oscar v Lando,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ncomu6/thought_experiment_with_oscar_v_lando/,2025-09-09, Statistics,"After last weekend, I decided to run a little experiment. It turned out to be more eye-opening than I expected, because I thought it would confirm something I already believed—but instead, it showed me something completely different.

With a little help from AI, I used random number generation to adjust Oscar Piastri’s form to reflect how he performed last year.

Looking back at all of his finishes from 2024, his average was 5.1 with a standard deviation of 3.0. So the idea was to simulate his current season as if he hadn’t improved, using last year’s stats as the baseline. I thought this would create a model where Lando was clearly McLaren’s number one driver.

My assumption going in was that, if Oscar wasn’t consistently near the front, Max Verstappen would be seriously challenging Lando and might be ahead. 

Here’s how I set it up: I left all other drivers’ positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spots based on that statistical profile, promoting the drivers ahead of him. For example, in my model he finished third at Spa instead of winning. There were a few other adjustments like that, but he still only finished outside the points once and even got two wins, which felt realistic.

What I actually ended up with was Lando leading Max by about 70 points. Behind them, there’s roughly a 60-point gap to George Russell, followed by Charles and Oscar close together, about 50 points ahead of Lewis, with Kimi and Alex another 50 points back.

So what I learned is this: Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar’s form stayed at last year’s level.

I’m Australian, so of course I’d love to see Oscar win the whole thing, but I’ll happily say this: Lando is fantastic this year. And unsurprisingly, even in this model, McLaren is running away with the Constructors’ Championship.","['There’s a reason people get degrees in statistics and other fields. \n\nWhat you’ve done is throw darts in the dark to draw a conclusion with no objective meaning. \n\nJust saying “AI” doesn’t make something meaningful or correct.\n\nOf course Lando has been good. He’s one DNF away from being in an extremely close fight for the championship. You don’t need any weird statistical manipulation to tell you that.', '""If you just change everything, everything will appear different""\n\n\n-Will Buxton', "">\xa0Lando has improved drastically this year\n\nHow did you conclude that Lando improved and not that McLaren's car did relative to the rest of the field?"", ""Maybe im taking it at too simplictic of a level, but how does making Oscar run worse peove Landos improvement?\n\nWhat happens when you run the same stats against Lando comapred to this year?\n\nDid you include McLarens technical inprovements and mid-speed corner dominance into the equation?\n\nI still feel that a drivers biggest push to improve comes from his own team mate's performance and data comparison. If you're cruising over your team mate, and winning against other teams comfortably, there isnt the pressure to find those extra 0.010's."", "">Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar’s form stayed at last year’s level.\n\nWhy would you make the assumption that Piastri's form has stayed the same as last year? It has been well-documented -- both by Piastri and by McLaren -- how he has applied himself to address the shortcomings that he had in 2024, and I think you would be hard-pressed to argue that he has not improved as a result."", '""I left all other drivers’ positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spot""\n\n\nSo you arbitrarily made Oscar worse in your game, so Oscar ended up worse. I don\'t want to be too sarcastic but that is hardly surprising.\n\n\nAlso, your conclusion is that Norris improved much? Isn\'t that like killing Batman and concluding Robin is amazing? I mean, yeah, if you make one of the two title contenders worse in your game, the remaining one wins.', ""Lando hasn't improved on last year, McLaren have relative to RedBull.\n\nIn 2024 Verstappen won 7/12 of the first half of the season, but only 2/12 of the second half. Lando and Max drove pretty consistently at their respective levels across the season with the performance of the cars being what changed."", ""If a driver does not improve from 1 season to the next but the car improves into a dominant car, their standard deviation of position would decrease.\xa0\n\n\nSimple example of this would be if you made the car 5 seconds a lap faster than everyone but Piastri's performance did not improve, his standard deviation of position would likely be between 0 and 1 because he'd finish 2nd most races."", '""With a little help from AI"" girl no', 'so you entered data and and lowered oscars finishes to make it "" realistic "" and then deduced that lando has improved, informative.......\n\nDid you know if we lowered all of maxs finishes statiscally yuki has improved']",0,28,0.11,0,27,27,0,0,-0.030000000000000013,0
