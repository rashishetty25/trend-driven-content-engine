In an interview with auto motor und sport, Flavio Briatore reveals why he came back, how he wants to apply the old success model to Alpine and what he understands by a good management style.

**You decided to make a comeback to Formula 1 at the age of 74. Why return to retirement?**

> Briatore: I was never really away. In the meantime, I was an ambassador for the sport for Stefano Domenicali and worked with him on new races and marketing opportunities. And as Fernando Alonso's manager, I was always in contact with the scene. But I was mainly involved in setting up my restaurant chain. I started from scratch. We are now one of the largest groups in the luxury segment worldwide and employ 1,200 people. It pretty much runs itself by now. There wasn't much left for me to do. My son moved from Monte Carlo to Geneva because he is studying there. It was getting a bit lonely at home and I was bored. And Formula 1 never really lets you go. I admit, I missed it. And then I had a conversation with Luca de Meo. I've known him for ages. I told him that it was sad to see a former world champion team in this state.

**And how did it become a job?**

> Briatore: In the beginning, the idea was to help a little. I wasn't sure because so much has changed in Formula 1. We talked about the last few years of Alpine in a very non-committal way. Losing two drivers like Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri in one summer was a bit of an inability. Fernando wanted to stay because the season before wasn't that bad. We wanted to sign the contract in Canada. Then Laurent Rossi suddenly disappeared. We could no longer contact him. That was the moment when I started talking to Lawrence Stroll from Aston Martin. We even had an offer from Williams. I said to them: get your shop in order first. In the end, we signed with Aston Martin because we couldn't get on with Alpine's management. The faults lay with the management. That's when I said to Luca: if I get full responsibility, I'll do it.

**You became world champion with Benetton during your career and made Renault world champion in the 2000s. Is the situation today comparable to back then?**

> Briatore: It is comparable to 2002. But we are in a better position with Alpine than we were with Renault back then. The team was in total disarray in 2002. Everyone was arguing with everyone else. With Luca, I now have the opportunity to do everything we want to do in the next three to five years. The first step was to get rid of our own engine. That means we're saying goodbye to something that only costs us money but brings us nothing. Mercedes will give us the best engine and the best gearbox in the business in 2026. If you want to win, 80 to 90 per cent of your components have to be the best. You don't need handicaps. In 2002, Renault had a very good engine. It was so good that we were even able to sell it to Red Bull later on. And the gearbox? It can't win you any races, it can only lose you some.

*How do you want to turn Alpine around?**

> Briatore: I have clear and simple management structures. We have appointed Oliver Oakes as team principal because he is young and motivated and has motorsport experience. Running a Formula 1 team is certainly different to being a Formula 2 team principal. But Ollie learns very quickly. He is a great choice.

**Why didn't you want to be team principal yourself?**

> Briatore: Why? I have been for long enough. I want to take care of the big picture and not be at the factory in Enstone every day. I represent our president Luca. I don't need a title to do that. Everyone knows that: I make the decisions. You need a team principal and a technical director to implement them. I have my old Benetton team in mind. There were three or four people running the place. I had less experience back then, but fortunately I had a good technical team around me with Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds. Now we have a good team under our Technical Director David Sanchez, a mix of people from the past and young engineers. We have to build the new Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds from that. In the meantime, everyone can see the light at the end of the tunnel. With the Mercedes engine, we have the basis to win. That is the mission. Not just driving around in circles.

**How do you intend to achieve this?**

> Briatore: You need the right people in the management positions. They can do what they want in their area as long as they deliver results. If not, that's where I come in. I am a democratic dictator. I trust people as long as they return the trust. If they are bad, I change them. Bad people infect everyone who works under them. They then say to themselves: why should I work for someone who is worse than me?

**They say that people make the difference. Adrian Newey was on the market. Why did he go to Aston Martin and not Alpine?**

> Briatore: You'll have to ask him that. Adrian is an artist. We're not ready for someone like him yet. To benefit from him, you have to have the right team around him. Maybe we'll be ready in two or three years. That's why I've never spoken to him seriously.

**Can the solutions that worked in the 2000s still be applied today?**

> Briatore: I think so. Successful models survive the test of time. As a manager, I have to make sure that everyone in the team understands what it's all about. Everyone must always have the goal in mind. The past is part of the present. That's why I had the world champion cars from 1995 and 2006 and all the world championship trophies placed in the entrance hall at Enstone and the previous year's car taken out. On Monday, our people come to the factory, see what this team has achieved and are prepared to work an extra three hours. When success comes, you no longer ask how high your personal commitment is. The difference today is that the teams have become much bigger and spend more money. You have to recognize the good people and let them grow. The size of the teams means that responsibility in the individual areas is spread over several shoulders.

**Isn't it harder to keep 800 people happy instead of 400?**

> Briatore: It all depends on the management staff. That's maybe 20 people. Just like in my restaurants, actually. We have 37 establishments worldwide. The product is different, but the system of creating a good product is the same as in Formula 1. We have to find the best people for all departments, in the technical office and production. The technical director has the task of putting it all together and overseeing the final product. I see a lot of progress here. The mood and motivation are much better today than they were five months ago. You only have to look at the faces of the people in the factory. There is a completely different spirit than when I started. You motivate employees with two things: Money and success.

**How much time do you devote to Formula 1?**

> Briatore: About 60 percent. I will be at Enstone three days a week in the winter. That's enough. I'm not going there to show my face. Something has to come out of it. I meet with our department heads there and find out whether the targets are being met. In the end, I'm only responsible to Luca de Meo. I owe him success. And we are lucky with him. He is a fan of motorsport. He wants to win. Even more so than Louis Schweitzer and Carlos Ghosn, with whom I had dealings in the past.","['>Flavio Briatore: ""I am a democratic dictator.""\n\nIn that case, I\'ll look forward to his episodes on *Behind the Bastards*.', ""MBS: And I'm an authoritarian dictator!"", 'https://preview.redd.it/ag2xv8f9qe7e1.jpeg?width=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edda0fd3d031224c0f3f306151c0b2b15fe73ae4', 'This guy should be far away from the sport but the world we live in money talks and criminals walk.  Utterly disgusting tbh', ""Part 2:\n\n**Unlike in the past, we now have a budget cap. Is the price right and is the system fair?**\n\n> Briatore: The name budget cap sounds very good. The reality is different. If you want to do it right, the driver has to be included in the budget. And also expensive engineers. Adrian Newey is as expensive as a driver. That's a big cost factor. It makes no sense to take him out. So the rich teams will always have an advantage because they can afford the expensive drivers or engineers and don't have to suffer in other areas. If the driver were included, it would be a fair system. Then you can decide: Do I prefer to spend my money on the driver or the car?\n\n**You used to preach efficiency with Renault and criticized when teams had over 500 people. Now we're at 800 to 1,000, what do you think?**\n\n> Briatore: That's completely crazy. Why do we race? To entertain the spectators. The spectator doesn't care how many people work for the teams. The car doesn't look any different to them if 300 instead of 2,000 people are working on it. And if the gearbox was the same for everyone, nobody would notice. People don't care whether it has five or eight gears. It doesn't make the car any faster. It only causes costs. How many cylinders does the engine have? It doesn't matter, the main thing is that it makes noise for the local people. You can't even hear that on the TV. You only notice the engine when it breaks down. Just like it still happens to us. Then everyone talks about the engine. We'd be better off investing our money in the show. We need a battle of the gladiators and not an arms race of components that make no difference.\n\n**Don't think Alpine will lose its identity with a Mercedes engine. The French have always been proud of their products?**\n\n> Briatore: The French want to win. We don't win with our engine. It's as simple as that. If we want to win, we have to give up the areas in which we are not competitive. That's one less problem for us to worry about in the future. Let's focus on the car. McLaren becomes world champion with a Mercedes engine. How many times have you read or heard about McLaren-Mercedes becoming world champions? Never. Haas is Haas and not Haas-Ferrari.\n\n**Can you guarantee that the move to a customer engine is not the first step towards selling the team?**\n\n> Briatore: I don't understand this speculation. Since I joined Renault, the same questions have always been asked. When we won the world championship title in 2005 and 2006, I was asked whether Renault wanted to stay in Formula 1. The truth is: I always got what I needed for the job from Renault. They appreciate that I am careful with their money. I believe in efficiency. That's why I'm now saving money everywhere in the areas that don't make my car faster. I don't think about what I'll be doing in five, ten or 20 years' time. I decide what's important now.\n\n**How long did it take you to figure out where Alpine was and what was needed to get back to winning ways?**\n\n> Briatore: It didn't take a genius to figure out that Alpine was down. When I came on board, the team had two points on the board. What is needed? I think we have a recipe for winning with 30 to 40 percent less money than the others. At Benetton it was 50 percent less. I know this team. That's why I came back. I wouldn't have done it with anyone else.\n\n**Where will Alpine be at the end of the season?**\n\n> Briatore: We have taken a big step forward and improved to the same level as Haas and Toro Rosso. But that was already a step for 2025. It wouldn't have been worth the effort for a few races in 2024. We had actually already ticked off that year. That's why I told the engineers: we'll only bring the upgrade if it will help us next year.\n\n**They wanted Carlos Sainz. He signed with Williams. What went wrong there?**\n\n> Briatore: I spoke to Sainz. He was interesting for us, but only for four years. It makes no sense to take a driver like Carlos for one or two years. Either he believes in our program or he doesn't. I don't need a driver who costs me a lot of money and is looking to go to another team when the opportunity arises.\n\n**You are also interested in Franco Colapinto. Why is that? You already have a young driver in Jack Doohan.**\n\n> Briatore: I'm interested in any driver who is fast. Colapinto surprised everyone. But we have contracts with Gasly, Doohan and Aron for next season. If there was an opportunity to get Colapinto for 2026, you have to think about it. Nevertheless, you always have to be careful when assessing drivers. In this sport, you quickly get hyped up after a good race. Then the price rises and suddenly we're talking about 20 or 30 million dollars. The choice today is much greater than it used to be. Today, there are six to seven promising drivers in Formula 2 and Formula 3. We want to concentrate on the good ones in our academy and no longer run around with a watering can. It will probably come down to three drivers. Aron, Mini and Martins.\n\n**We have five rookies at the start next year. One at Alpine. Has time run out for the veterans?**\n\n> Briatore: It is now time for a generation change. Sainz is a very good driver. But when he was on the market, none of the top teams took him on. They prefer to go for young drivers. Toto Wolff on Antonelli, Christian Horner on Lawson. Young drivers are hungrier than someone who has a wife and two children and 30 or 40 million in the bank. Even Enzo Ferrari said that drivers slow down when they have children. I think the rise of Piastri has made people think. Bearman jumps into a Ferrari overnight and drives a great race. The young drivers are much better trained. And the competitive pressure is higher. In Formula 2, you're in first place today and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton or Rosberg used to win 70 percent of all races. When Schumacher came to us, he still lacked experience. We first sent Fernando to Minardi. Verstappen didn't even have a driver's license when he started at Toro Rosso.\n\n**How long can Fernando Alonso survive in this environment?**\n\n> Briatore: Fernando is the exception. I've been his manager for 22 years. He has money, but no children. And he is still hungry. If he finishes 14th, he wants to be 13th. Someone else his age would do his job by the book if it's only about 14th place. There are now two feelings in my chest. On the one hand, I wish Fernando could get off to another flying start with Adrian Newey at Aston Martin in 2026, but on the other hand, he's racing against Alpine. But still, would a World Championship title as a farewell be a brilliant story?\n\n**Where should Alpine finish next year, where in 2026 and 2027?**\n\n> Briatore: Alpine must always be in the top 6 next year. Maybe a podium every now and then. We have to improve our car to achieve this. That should be possible. Aerodynamically, we have much more leeway than Ferrari or McLaren. In 2026, we want to be on the podium in 50 percent of all races. Then you automatically win one or two races. In 2027, we have to be in a position to compete for the title."", ""Didn't he get a life-ban for crashgate Singapore 2008?

The winning firm will invest 400 million euros in the development of the project and will join forces with IFEMA Madrid to get the most out of the VIP and Hospitality areas.\n\nThe agreement with Match Hospitality contemplates a progressive economic injection during the ten years that the contract lasts.

By the numbers, Yuki has had over SEVEN TIMES as many race starts as Liam; Liam was not getting slaughtered, and arguably matching Yuki on pace and performance. If Liam is already on equal footing as someone with that much more experience, how is he not the more desirable promotion? \n\nThe one thing that everyone seems to have forgotten that IMO really killed it for Yuki was when he dive bombed DR3 after the checkered flag in Bahrain. He got team orders, and he retaliated immediately. Not that I think the 2nd seat RBR driver will be in a position to receive team orders vs Max, but that's not something they need to deal with, and if that's where Yuki is at emotionally after 3 full years driving, I wouldn't want him near the better car either."", ""I saw a comment yesterday that mentioned the cost of buying a driver out of their contract early could come under the cost cap (when their salary usually doesn't), is there any truth in that?"", 'Just got an email from f1 that in switzerland you wont be able to subscribe to f1tv for next season. Does anyone have more info?

Lol"", ""I'm 17 and going to a grand prix next year. I've thought of Tokyo grand prix as it's affordable and would be cool. The other ones are too costly. Even that's not a problem, the problem is that the living cost of that country might be high too. So tell me some good countries which are not overly expensive to live in even if I get the tickets which might be costly.\n\n          \nI live in India\n\n\n\n      Max limit for my trip is like 26-2700 dollars."", ""> Yuki has had over SEVEN TIMES as many race starts as Liam;  \n  \nMainly as Yuki is primarily there because of Honda. It's unclear if he wants to stay with CashGrab or go to Aston with Honda.  \nConsidering it was Honda pushing for him to get a test in the big RBR car, it's obvious that Red Bull doesn't apparently know where his alliances lie."", ""I don't like it from a driver development perspective, personally. I don't think Lawson is nearly at a level where being under the microscope at a team that expects to be competitive for the constructors is the best thing for his development. We've seen it play out with Albon and Gasly recently.\n\nI don't think Yuki's a good option either, but IMO he's still the better driver (as he should... the gap should be much bigger if anything) and there's no risk of damaging a relationship with a valuable prospect. I also think that the team orders would be better received at RBR than at AT where he's gunning for a promotion.\n\nIn any case it's nuts that a team like RBR is down to these two plus Perez for their second driver option.

1hge2iy,How important is it to have an F1 race in Africa and is it worth it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hge2iy/how_important_is_it_to_have_an_f1_race_in_africa/,2024-12-17, Discussion,"People for long have complained that a world championship doesn‚Äôt visit the second largest continent on the world. However, I don‚Äôt see how simply adding one race to this continent helps almost anything except for checking Africa off the list. I don‚Äôt think I need to say how vastly different every region of Africa is and when you look at the most likely candidates in my opinion this divide is clearly shown.

Obviously South Africa has always been the frontrunner since Kyalami used to host F1 but not only does the country seem unstable at times (I haven‚Äôt kept up but I remember protests at one point) but South Africa is very different to most countries. Then you have Rwanda who seem to be leading the race now and seem to be the most economically stable country in Africa and most realistic host. Watching football I‚Äôve seen their advertising all over Arsenal and it seems they‚Äôre going a step further now but once again Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia. And the final option which is by far the least realistic but it‚Äôs just the reality of having a race in this continent would be an Egyptian GP but as you can imagine the divide is biggest at the North of Africa and it would be seen as another desert race. I only include it because it‚Äôs the most well known African country and has a history vastly greater than any desert race we currently have. Beyond these 3 options I can‚Äôt think of anything else, maybe a Moroccan GP since they seem to be hosting the WC with Spain and Portugal and at the most extreme push Senegal for being the closest possible option West Africa has.

 I think a lot of people have this idea that we can just start having races anywhere in Africa to represent the continent but it is beyond unrealistic to start hosting races in West Africa, East Africa and most of North Africa so why force one race to tick the continent off when it‚Äôs not really proper representation. I feel like only die hard Kyalami fans would be pushing for it otherwise there is little interest. Personally, I‚Äôd rather countries focus their efforts towards their people rather than paying ridiculous money to host an F1 event which is why I kept the options as realistic as possible. So for me it‚Äôs not worth forcing an F1 race here where one race can‚Äôt possibly please even a fifth of the continent (it‚Äôs not as simple as hosting Melbourne for Australia) and the options that exist mostly don‚Äôt exist apart from Kyalami yet the most realistic option still will be a soulless Rwandan GP. ","[""Personally I think that races should be awarded based on how much the host country/city can actually viably support the race and how many actual fans from the locality will get to see the race in person, as well as the general appeal of the race to the existing F1 fan base.\n\nMaybe hosting a race in Africa could bring in a large fan base, but if the race isn't likely to be run for more than a couple years and they stop because of the expense, then it's probably not a great idea to host a race there.\n\nAlso, with 24 races,  we are approaching the point at which we don't really have time for more races. So the question becomes which race gets cancelled to make room for a race in Africa?"", 'About as important as having a race anywhere else. It‚Äôs a sport, a show, purely for entertainment and money.', ""> However, I don‚Äôt see how simply adding one race to this continent helps almost anything except for checking Africa off the list\n\nWell, they're not going to add a dozen new races all at once so arguing that they should add multiple is a nonstarter that only delays getting races into the continent. They should just add a race and see how popular it is. Popularity will determine if they add more races to the area.\n\nI would remind you that there is only one race in South America, and five in North America. (Two races in South America if we're going by Marko's reckoning.)\n\n>Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia.\n\nOmg who cares about 'representing all of Asia/Africa'? An African race doesn't need to be put on a pedestal with all these heightened expectations. But there SHOULD be a race in Africa."", ""The importance is to increase market share. F1 isn't too popular in Africa so a race there could entice people enough to start watching it. They have to find the right dictatorship with enough money."", 'Scandinavia or Finland deserve one more', ""People who want Kyalami I'm sorry to say are nostalgia blind, f1 returning there won't bring your childhood or Senna back. I don't think it would race well nowadays and just because it's a classic track doesn't make it good. See Imola.\n\nKnowing F1 tho, it's not a question of if. But how much people are prepared to suck up to MBS n co."", '>\xa0the country seem unstable at times\n\nUnlike the US that hosts 3 races, or Saudi Arabia that had a literal missile threat during a GP.', 'I feel like another point I could‚Äôve mentioned that would‚Äôve been interesting would be: would you want a race in Africa to fill the ‚Äòworld‚Äô championship quota before having tracks that are currently missing? Tracks in Turkey, Malaysia and Germany amongst others are proven to be great in countries that can easily host these tracks if a deal was agreed', 'God forbid a country have protests!']",0,50,0.3,0,48,48,0,6,0.010000000000000009,0
