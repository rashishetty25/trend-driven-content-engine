ETA - user rustyiesty points out below that Richie Ginther also raced for BRM in 1962 and also hadn't won prior. Not sure why Wikipedia doesn't have him listed, but that reduces the scope of the stat to more modern times with the WCC in a format like today.

I do think Norris’ season has been underrated somewhat, but I would still put McLaren ahead of Red Bull overall. Could it be possible that the model is underrating Verstappen (as ridiculous as that sounds) and therefore the Red Bull? I know his delta to Perez has exceeded expectations and this is taken as a Perez underperformance, but I find it unlikely Perez has just underperformed for four years straight, maybe Verstappen’s ceiling could be slightly higher? Did Verstappen exceed the expected delta to Albon and Gasly in 2019 or 2020?\n\nWhat caused Sainz’s ceiling to increase? I don’t necessarily disagree, but is it something to do with him being closer to Leclerc than expected?\nHave there been any other ceiling changes (bar him and Piastri)? I checked the 2023 ratings and it appears Stroll’s ceiling has decreased, and Russell’s very slightly too (if I remember correctly).\n\nI do think Gasly has been underrated somewhat, but as you say that’s more a quirk of him being behind Ocon in Brazil, which is a bit of an outlier race.

1hazmn9,I think the 2026 rules are going to hurt overtaking a lot,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hazmn9/i_think_the_2026_rules_are_going_to_hurt/,2024-12-10, Discussion,"You know why no other motorsport allows active aero? Because it bolsters dirty air and reduces slipstream. It's rule number 1 of racing regulations - its why GT3's have bolt-on wings while their road-going counterparts are shapeshifting. In the 2026 F1 regs, teams will be able to toggle between aero modes on most straights at all times - which means dirty downforce creating a huge wake in the corner, and Monza trim down the straights.

[Take it from PlanetF1](https://preview.redd.it/reme6rzr306e1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=256f7aa727bfea4b22178ba706d0d48b05159c79)

Despite this, DRS is getting removed in 2026. I hate it as much as the next guy but removing the aid that makes 3+ tenths on a straight when you'll have these Project 400 monsters making reduced slipstream, is a recipe for disaster.

  
Downforce decreased by 30%? Surely that is SOME good news for the following car? Nope - its all been sourced from lovely clean ground effect.

[Venturi effect has been the dirty air magic bullet](https://preview.redd.it/cquec0l7706e1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=6846ac5c3e1250ff14c4edc1523f4fd066b71980)



There is a ""DRS replacement"" for the following car, in the form of an ERS boost. How exciting! Thats way better than DRS, it can be used anywhere including small straights (DRS potency is exponential with speed), gives diversity in overtaking and maybe even a challenge to control the traction!

Oh, it only STARTS to activate at 295kph. And its a gradient that only really kicks in around 310-320. Its somehow even less diverse than DRS. Now every motorway overtake will become even more redundant, and every straight less than a kilometre will be abandoned. 

[You can do the maths](https://preview.redd.it/zzoox5vx706e1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=9175f92639228e14ce23b006d35f1bfceaedaf5d)

And it depletes the battery so there's not even intrinsic gain for the following car like DRS. Which is so critical when dirty air is gonna be a problem! Funny DRS train battles will perish - now each position swap is a huge battery depletion, if the guy can even get close.



They must be hoping that their vaunted ""inwash"" effect can save the day. But it doesn't fill me with hope that their last amendment from November was to allow more front wing and bargeboard appendages to ""claw back some lap time"". I think 2026 is going to be a massive struggle for on-track action.

  
To people who think the sleuths at the FIA are trustworthy enough to avoid this cock-up - they sat on extensive ground effect for 40 years when it was the cure for dirty air all along, they forced hybrids through while bankrupting 2 teams and providing little value to anybody, and they commissioned the 2017 regs. Also traction control shouldn't've lasted until 2007.  


Its a shame because people will conflate this latest gaffe with the car size reduction, which is a brilliant first step towards tiny, agile, raceable ones. Small (particularly narrow) cars are the best way to create exciting racing. But with extreme dirty air, racing can never initiate in the first place.

(Not to mention it is a markedly small step: Weight reduction is half of what was gained between 2021 and 2022 even IF theres no backsliding. And dimension reductions are less than half of 2016-to-17s gain.)

  
Does this match the public sentiment? Most of the F1 fans I've talked to haven't even looked at the regs. But im interested to hear some opinions. And I'd like to hear from an expert about the active aero stuff, because I am no expert but I find it hard to believe active aero was a productive solution here?","['I think most of the reaction to the regulations are overblown and it’s worth waiting until we see them in action for a few races before forming an opinion', 'I am not saying you are wrong in your worries, but ground effect is not the nectar that makes following easier. It is the reduction of outwashing elements and the reliance of the front wing to control the airflow that helps. You force the teams to use a single plane front wing with no end plate and ensure its width is less that the overall width of the car and you remove outwashing bargeboards, then you will also have cars that are easy to follow without increasing any downforce from the floor. The issue here is that the cars will most likely be slow. Inwashing elements greatly reduce the width of the wake and that is the key to making cars easier to follow.', ""When I saw the news about DRS being removed I also got worried about overtaking getting worse, not only that but small front wing damage will probably force most drivers to pit, while with the current regs you usually can keep racing with only a small performance cost.\n\nIt looks like most of the changes have been made so the engines can be raced without making the cars incredibly slow on straights. I have the feeling that overtaking will be very hard in 2026, but I hope I'm wrong."", ""I disagree, or at least, am a bit more optimistic.\n\nConsider that:\n\n- Slower cornering speeds with lower downforce actually creates more potential for varying lines through corner complexes. Additionally, lower downforce places more emphasis on driver skill in braking zones.\n- Cars may have a harder time following due to lack of slipstream and no DRS to overtake, but they will still have battery deployment to bring them alongside and will be able to stay alongside without instability due to inwash aero.\n- Smaller footprint due to reduced length and width means more nimble.\n\nTaking these three things together and what I think we will see (and what F1 is aiming for) is less 'push to pass' on the straights (though some 'push to draw alongside') but more battling / overtakes through corner complexes, which I think could be significantly more exciting and is certainly more reliant on driver skill."", 'lol just make the fastest car', ""Reduction in downforce doesn't really matter, it's the reduction in downforce while following another car that's important."", 'Drs is going away because we’re getting the F1 version of Indycar’s Push to Pass. There will still be an advantage to the chasing car. Not sure all of the details yet but it should be fine. Also, less downforce means less dirty air. Cars should be able to follow each other closer, for longer.', ""To me this reads mostly like a bunch of half-informed hot takes patched together. I'm not saying the concerns aren't unwarranted, but they are way more complex than they seem. If these concerns can be reached through some thinking and discussion they have definitely been evaluated and addressed quite a while ago.\n\nEdit: also speaking from experience, ground effect is not the magic bullet to solve racing, it was just aggressively marketed to create hype for the 2022 reg changes. Sure it does help to some extent but great racing can be achieved without it and poor racing can still happen with it."", 'More drag and/or less power aid overtaking the most. Both make the slipstream effect stronger. But instead they want to make the cars even faster on a straight line which will make overtaking harder.\n\nI predict there will be a panic rule chenge for mid 2026 because the racing is so terrible.', 'That’s how it was in 2009, and any other year they massively changed the regulations. \n\nIt’ll shake things up, but eventually the teams will find their footing and things will shake out in a few years, it’ll settle in and we’ll reset the regulations again. And on and on. \n\nThe one big change that came about post-2009 was the rise of Red Bull. Vettel winning in a Toro Rosso was a huge shock in 2008, but Red Bull claiming a seat at the table was something nobody was expecting. \n\nIf you would’ve told me that Mercedes and Red Bull would dominate F1 for the 15 years in January of 2010 I would’ve laughed at you. But from 2010-2024 only Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have claimed a WDC. Crazy to think that Jenson Button was the last driver not from Red Bull or Mercedes to claim the driver’s crown.

I just rewatched it with a start stop clock and from moment of movement of the mechanics to when his tyres started to move I keep getting around 1.66 and if you take into account my reaction times it should be even less than that.
