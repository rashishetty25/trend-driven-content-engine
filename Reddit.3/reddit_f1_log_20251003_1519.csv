I think he's born to be, and will forever be, one of the best ever, if not the best in Formula 1.** So I think for anyone to have a chance of going up against him and beating him is pretty slim at times.

P1 however look comfortable for the time being, but the Williams performance isn't as strong as it was earlier in the season.\n\nWorst stop goes to Norris again, as Alonso had a time penalty for his jump start, he makes up a few tenths in the lane with the 6th time but would be impossible to overcome a 4 second pitstop.. an issue obviously talked about for a while now, but Mclaren generally has had the luxury of not having competition and the slow stops not being punished.. maybe now they'll actually work on improving it.\n\nMidfield is kinda interesting, drivers like Hulkenberg, Alonso and Hamilton suddenly racking up points after being firmly down the lower end earlier in the season.. even Stroll has made his way into the top 10 now at the expense of Piastri who can only sit by and watch."", 'Oscar: bro.\xa0', 'Lmao hilarious', 'I hope that over time they become a bit less random, but for that it requires collecting more data and see if we can find out patterns, and then causes and whatnot, or so I hope.', 'Impressive work by Williams.']",114,6,0.87,114,37,37,8,0,0.0,8

1nws9lz,Can Singapore GP keep its crown as F1 night race challengers loom?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nws9lz/can_singapore_gp_keep_its_crown_as_f1_night_race/,2025-10-03, News,,"['bring back the Singaore sling\xa0', '[Gift link updated](https://bt.sg/g/ngFd), excerpts here:\n\n> [SINGAPORE] When the inaugural Singapore Grand Prix lit up the Marina Bay circuit in 2008, few could have foreseen how it would reshape Formula 1.\n> \n> That September evening marked the championship’s first night race, dazzling spectators with the city-state’s bejewelled skyline and festival atmosphere. More significantly, it became the first to demonstrate how the event could be more than just a sporting contest, with concerts featuring global stars, a clubbing stage and a showcase of local cuisine.\n> \n> Yet, Singapore was determined to make the race a success. The government paid 60 per cent of the total reported cost of about S$150 million, with S$33 million going towards the construction of the pit building. In recent years, the number has come down to S$135 million to S$140 million.\n> \n> This big bet seems to have paid off. Seventeen years on, Singapore remains one of the most prestigious races on the calendar. F1’s chief commercial officer Emily Prazer described Singapore as “one of the most revered Grands Prix” earlier this year. Motorsport.com’s Europe, Middle East and Africa president James Allen said in 2018 that Singapore was the only venue besides Monaco that “does more for Formula 1 than Formula 1 does for the venue”.\n> \n> But with Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and, most recently, Las Vegas now vying for the limelight with their own night races, the question is whether Singapore can continue to hold its crown.\n\n[...]\n\n> Singapore’s model has become the blueprint, with many other night races incorporating similar elements, particularly with the addition of concerts to the race weekend. Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia and Las Vegas had them integrated from their first races, while Bahrain and Qatar added them around 2014 and 2023, respectively.\n> \n> F1 itself has enjoyed an immense popularity boom, which has translated into almost a 250 per cent rise in its share price since Liberty’s takeover in 2017. It now trades at around US$100, compared to under US$30 at the time of F1’s sale.\n> \n> Singapore and the other night races have enjoyed a strong boost alongside it. The race weekend alone in the Republic brings in about S$130 million annually in terms of net spend, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in 2022, with S$2.2 billion collected from about 720,000 international visitors across 2008 to 2024.\n> \n> McKinsey & Company also estimated that the 2019 race generated S$70 to S$75 million in global media exposure.\n> \n> The hospitality sector saw a similar bump. Data from commercial real estate information company CoStar showed that Singapore hotels’ revenue per available room (RevPar) increased to S$557 on race weekends from 2022 to 2024, up from S$448 from 2008 to 2019. The average daily rate also rose from S$513 to S$645, even as occupancy dipped from 87.3 per cent to 86.4 per cent.\n> \n> “Over the years, the Singapore Grand Prix has consistently driven strong hotel performance,” says a CoStar spokesperson, in response to queries from BT. “F1 remains a very popular event for inbound travellers.”\n\n[...]\n\n> Dr Chadwick also sees Singapore’s race as “integral to the national sport strategy” of the country. He describes the four Gulf night events as “trinkets” in comparison, noting that their circuits and races do not integrate into the city the way Singapore’s does, particularly in terms of transportation.\n\n[...]\n\n> (Saunders) notes that the Singapore race has always felt “ahead of its time” in terms of successfully drawing a younger and diverse demographic that Liberty has been pursuing since its takeover of F1 in 2017.\n\n[...]\n\n> Saunders believes that given the race’s success, both Singapore and F1 will likely be keen to renew their deal. Miami has already signed a 16-year contract extension – a sign, he suggests, of what may lie ahead for Singapore.', ""The issue with Singapore isn't the night race, but rather the quality of the actual race. The track is just Monaco with extra steps to a certain degree. \n\nVegas is a better, but maybe that's just me. I am getting tired of the gimmicky tracks where the cars can't really race.\n\nIf Singapore does get renewed, I would like some clauses about changes to the track, but I'm just not sure how possible that is with a street track"", ""Singapore is overhated.\n\nThe 2022 and 2023 races were both bangers, and that wasn't the first time this race has been good, either."", 'what crown? for one of the most boring races of the season, unless something interesting happens like in 2017.', 'Vegas is a better track, just a divisive location.', 'What crown? Everyone thinks it shit', 'the current cars have basically no chance of finishing the race with the singapore sling', '‘If’ it get renewed. Lmao', 'We ain’t the audience, though. No one at the Singapore GP gives a shit about racing, I genuinely won’t be surprised if you did a survey of the demographics of people who attend each race/ have interest in each race the Singapore crowd is going to rank as “never watched other series nor have practically any understanding of motor racing” and stupidly wealthy for the rich guests who rather come to Singapore to do their literal backroom deals than godfuck nowhere Middle East.\n\nMost of the people I met/know could not give a shit about the support races, they just go for all the concerts and pretend they are not bored of watching F1.\n\n(Singaporean who fucking hates the Singapore race/track)']",43,13,0.83,43,13,13,6,1,0.019999999999999907,6
