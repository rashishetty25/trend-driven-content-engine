Intending to turn onto a road outside the circuit, he was stopped by a traffic officer who informed him that the road was closed and he had to continue straight ahead.*\n\n> *In a video recorded by surveillance cameras and published by the newspaper La Verità, the black vehicle can be seen stopping while the officer, using his baton and hand gestures, indicates the correct route. After a brief exchange between Antonelli and the officer, the car turns left and, during the maneuver, hits the officer’s leg, before being stopped a few meters further ahead by other officers. In the video, the officer bends over, holding his knee, and is visibly limping. Another colleague then calls for medical assistance.*\n\n> *The officer was taken to the hospital, treated, and discharged with a diagnosis of a serious knee sprain with ligament injury, and a sixty-day recovery period. According to ANSA, the Bologna Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation, which was later closed at the request of the judge, ruling that “the act did not constitute an offense” with regard to the charge of resisting a public officer. The charge of negligent injury was also dismissed, since the injured party did not file a formal complaint.*\n\n> *In the days following the incident, Antonelli apologized both to the injured officer and publicly, admitting his responsibility. Also speaking to ANSA, Imola’s mayor Marco Panieri explained:*\n\n> *“On May 21, after the accident, [the officer] came to my office accompanied by two deputy commanders. I put him in contact with Antonelli’s father so they could clear things up.

The reality? Bigger batteries, more weight, and slower cars.\n\n# Heavier cars, slower racing (just like the SUVs nowadays, a modern BMW SUV is over 2 tonnes...)\n\nTripling the electrical power means you need more energy storage. More storage = heavier batteries.  \nThe FIA says the cars will be “lighter overall,” but that’s mostly wishful thinking. Energy recovery will play a much bigger role, so drivers will be juggling deployment and regen instead of just driving flat out.\n\n**If people want to watch battery management and energy strategy, there’s already Formula E for that.**\n\n# The CO₂ comparison is kind of a joke...\n\nHere’s the thing: an F1 car over an entire race weekend burns roughly **220–250 kg of fuel**, or about **300 liters**.  \nThat’s roughly **700 kg of CO₂** for the whole weekend.\n\nNow compare that to Max Verstappen’s private jet — a Dassault Falcon 8X.  \nOne flight from Europe to Austin for the US GP burns around **12,000 kg of jet fuel** (about **15,000 liters**).  \nThat’s around **36 tons of CO₂** — about **50 times more** than his race car produces in a weekend.\n\n**And that’s one flight. Add up all the private jets, freight planes, and trucks that move the paddock around, and it’s obvious where the real emissions come from. The race fuel itself is barely a rounding error.**\n\n# The “green fuel” part isn’t what it sounds like\n\nSynthetic e-fuels can technically be carbon-neutral, but they take an insane amount of energy to make, and they still release CO₂ when burned.  \nThe only thing that makes them “green” is if the production process uses renewable energy and captured carbon — which is nice in theory but doesn’t make the cars any cleaner in practice.\n\n# So what’s the point?\n\n**The 2026 regs make the cars more complicated, more expensive, and likely slower — all for a “green” headline.**  \n**It doesn’t fix the real environmental footprint of F1, which comes from freight and travel, not what’s burned in the cars.**\n\n  \nAnd more boring races...', ""Why did they strike out Max's eyes?"", 'My thinking as well.
