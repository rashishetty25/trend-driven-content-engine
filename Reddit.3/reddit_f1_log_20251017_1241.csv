In the video, the officer bends over, holding his knee, and is visibly limping.

The charge of negligent injury was also dismissed, since the injured party did not file a formal complaint.*\n\n> *In the days following the incident, Antonelli apologized both to the injured officer and publicly, admitting his responsibility. Also speaking to ANSA, Imola‚Äôs mayor Marco Panieri explained:*\n\n> *‚ÄúOn May 21, after the accident, [the officer] came to my office accompanied by two deputy commanders.
