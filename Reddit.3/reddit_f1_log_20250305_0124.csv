The employee who accuses him of inappropriate behavior is going to the British employment court. This is reported by De Telegraaf. In the meantime, English media are not allowed to report on the case.\n\n\n\nThe 51-year-old Horner was acquitted after an internal investigation by the Formula 1 racing team. The case came to light in early February 2024. At the end of that month, it was announced that he could stay on as team boss, after completion of the investigation. The female employee appealed, but Horner was acquitted again. The Briton has been team boss of Red Bull Racing since 2005.\n\n\n\nAccording to De Telegraaf, the case will come before the employment court in January 2026. Conflicts between employers and employees are dealt with there. Ban on English media\n\n\n\nIt is striking that the English media have not reported on the case since April last year, while they were eager to do so before. A Reporting Restriction Order (RRO) has been issued in England, which means that all domestic media are not allowed to report on developments in the case.\n\nA year after \'the email\'\n\n\n\nA year ago, on 29 February, around 150 journalists received an email from an anonymous email address during free practice in Bahrain with incriminating documents about Horner. ""I was one of the chosen ones,"" says NOS reporter Louis Dekker.\n\nThis Google Drive document included text and photos that Horner had allegedly sent to the female Red Bull Racing employee in question.\n\n""That same evening I received an email from the law firm that Horner had hired,"" Dekker explains. ""The message was that I was not allowed to use anything from the email, otherwise legal action would be taken. The tone was quite intimidating. I was addressed as the recipient of the email.""\n\nAt the time, the team boss did not want to answer any questions about the matter after the successful opening race in Bahrain, in which Verstappen and then teammate Perez scored a \'1-2\'. ""He blamed it on a private situation and only wanted to answer questions about the racing. He even gave compliments when a journalist asked a question about the sporting situation on the track after a while.""\n\n""During the past season, the British media asked fewer and fewer questions about the incident and eventually it went quiet,"" Dekker concludes.', ""Surprising that it will take until January for the case to be heard, effectively making it 2 years since the story initially broke. Not giving an opinion on the case either way as we don't have the same evidence as those investigating do.

1j37a0s,Major F1 races which were largely uneventful?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j37a0s/major_f1_races_which_were_largely_uneventful/,2025-03-04, Discussion,"We have heard about many F1 races which had big storylines and milestones but turned out to be largely uneventful. 

What are some races do you think which fit into this criteria?

The 2010 Abu Dhabi GP might be one certain example. While there was a legendary 4-way championship going on, the on track action was terrible. Combine the fact that this was before DRS was a thing, and it was pretty much evident that the only way you could get over someone was through pitting.

However people remember it for being the only 4-way title decider and it's often overlooked that the actual race wasn't as good.

What other races can be put here?
","['China 2019 was hyped up by Liberty as the 1000th F1 race, but very little seemed to actually happen', 'Spa 2021 practically undefeated in that sense. \n\nAlthough I guess the only hype was Russell’s p2/3 qualifying, can’t remember.', ""Bahrain 2010.

And yet, no action."", ""Not really a major race but Styria 2020 worth a mention as we had a race at the same track the week before and it was an absolute belter (Lando's first podium, Albon getting spun out by Lewis, Mercs having problems with the curbs, 9 DNFs) \n\nPlus Austria the year before had the epic Leclerc v Verstappen fight for the win\n\nSo I was super excited to run it back a week later and then absolutely nothing happened, HAM BOT VER"", ""Russia 2017 - Bottas' first win was as about a dull a race as you could get."", '2005 United States GP, of course.', ""2016 Baku has to be up there. There's been something interesting happening there every year except the inaugral GP.\nThe only drama was that instructions over team radio were briefly banned but all that meant was that even the Mercedes drivers weren't racing each other as one of them spent half the race trying to adjust settings."", ""Australia 2024 was unbelievably boring despite the events that took place. Sure, Sainz won, Max had a DNF and Russell had a dramatic DNF. But the race as a whole wasn't really that exciting."", ""2007 Brazilian GP.

I am a long-time racing fan (the first F1 season I followed was 1994, yet in my childhood) and a great lover of history, my other passion. Soon, I became an avid reader of both and somebody who had always wanted to explore the rich past of motor sport. Later, I started doing serious research and writing.

Are there more history enthusiasts? I'd love to discuss their interests and know any communities where it's possible to deepen my knowledge and also contact with more racing-related people, as well as understand what the target audience expects to read in an every-changing world (I confess I'm not too keen on the digital side of things).

Best Regards
