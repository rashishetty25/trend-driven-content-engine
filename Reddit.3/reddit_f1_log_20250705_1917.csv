In an interview with Viaplay, Bottas said that talks are ongoing, but that they are more about next year.\n\n‘He first showed interest in Toto, but I think we\'re talking more about next year,’ Bottas commented on the situation.\n\nAlpine\'s driver lineup is tricky, as they have already tried Jack Doohan and Franco Colapinto alongside Pierre Gasly, but neither has been able to get the cars to perform. It would not make sense for Bottas or Alpine to take on another driver just for the sake of trying, but rather they need to find a better and more permanent solution for the second car. It goes without saying that Bottas is also looking further ahead.\n\n‘A short stint somewhere... does that help in any way? My main focus is entirely on 2026 and beyond, and what the best option is from there. What is the most interesting project, and of course I want to be competitive, that\'s what\'s most on my mind,’ Bottas continues.\n\nHowever, the Finnish veteran does not rule out the possibility if a place in racing were to open up immediately. Admittedly, that is also part of the role of a reserve driver.\n\n""Yes, I\'m ready to jump into the car at any stage. It\'s not going anywhere, and I\'ve had a chance to test it.
