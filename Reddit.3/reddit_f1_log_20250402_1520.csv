In 1974 he became the leader of the team after the death of Peter Revson, and he was able to get a podium (3rd) on the Monaco Grand Prix. In 1975, he started the season by being on pole on the first two races, it looked promising for Shadow, but he DNS'd on Argentina amd retired in Brazil due to a mechanical failure while standing strong in the lead (27 laps led in the race), while Tom Pryce overshadowed Jarier in race performance, the Frenchman was still a very capable driver, but Shadow's dip in performance during the second half of the 75' and whole 76' season and also Pryce outperforming him left Jarier without a ride for 77.

The next season he became the first driver ever for the backmarker German team ATS, where in his debut with them, he finished 6th. But the performance of the team went downards and he jumped from ride to ride, until in 1978 he got the golden chance in quite tragic reasons. Lotus signed him as a last minute replacement for Ronnie Peterson, after the Swede died from injuries suffered in the Italian Grand Prix. Jarier looked strong in his debut with the team on the US West GP, where he was running third before his car broke down.

But the saddest moment came in Canada, where he got his third pole in F1 and dominated the whole race for almost 50 laps when his car broke down again and he had to retire, basically his last chance to win a Grand Prix ended there. From then on he got 2 solid seasons with Tyrrell, getting 2 podiums in 1979 and being a consistent point scorer with them.

After that, he drove for backmarker team Osella and in his last year in 1983 with Ligier, where he became known as a moving chicane who ignored blue flags as much as he could. Overall, Jarier's career was one of pure bad luck and bad choices, which leaves a very underrated driver, who had massive potential and could have won a few races, but never got the shot to run a full season with a top tier team.","['Btw, sorry for making such a long post, I just love writing about racing memorabilia too much.', '‚ÄúJarier really is completely out of order, I mean he really shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to drive in Grand Prix racing, he is, well he‚Äôs got a mental age of 10 in the first place and that was absolutely disgraceful‚Ä¶ he should certainly have a short suspension for that, and for being himself he should have a permanent suspension‚Äù -James Hunt, 1983 Austrian Grand Prix\xa0', ""Where's Montoya with that BMW that exploded every race?

We need to draw on the experience that Yuki has.\n\n>""And in the meantime, you (Lawson) need to go and rebuild yourself in the Racing Bulls, in an environment that you know and is perhaps slightly less pressured than Red Bull Racing.""\n\nPressed on what convinced him to make the decision, Horner said that both himself and engineers were ""concerned"" over the degree to which Lawson was mentally struggling with the situation.\n\n>He said: ""I think with everything that we saw in Australia and China, you could see that it was really affecting Liam quite badly.\n\n>""We could have left it, and I think that Liam is a driver with talent. Maybe within half a season he would have got there, but we just don\'t have that amount of time.\n\n>""It was something that was very clear to the engineering side within the team, just how much Liam was struggling with it all, and you could see that weight upon his shoulders.\n\n> ""The engineers were coming to me very concerned about it, and at the end of the day, I think it was the logical thing to do.""\n\nLawson:\n\nLawson is adamant that there is nothing about his driving style that made the RB21 particularly challenging for him, but that he simply needed more time to adjust.\n\n>""For me, it\'s really neither,"" Lawson said. ""The car is hard to drive. But we were going through a process of making that adjustment.\n\n>""For me, it\'s honestly time. But the way that the weekend went, in Formula 1, in a pre-season test, you\'re driving all day and you have loads of time to adjust and things like that. So honestly, a lack of time in the car is really the biggest thing for me that made it hard to adjust.\n\n>""Each session we were going out, we were sort of adjusting or getting used to something that was a little bit unknown. It\'s not so much a driving style or something like that. It\'s just literally adjusting. And for me, I just didn\'t have the time to do that.""\n\n>‚ÄúI‚Äôm really looking forward to be racing in Japan this weekend,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSuzuka is one of my favourite tracks on the calendar.\n\n>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool to drive and very high speed, which makes it great fun in a Formula 1 car.\n\n>‚ÄúThis weekend is a big opportunity for me as I rejoin Visa Cash App Racing Bulls and I‚Äôm very excited to work with this team again.\n\n>‚ÄúAs always, I‚Äôll be giving it everything I have.‚Äú\n\nHorner:\n\nThere had been speculation that Verstappen was unimpressed by the saga as a result of an Instagram post that contained criticism of Red Bull being liked by his official account.\n\nThere are already murmurings over the Dutchman\'s future with the team amid long-standing interest from Mercedes and Aston Martin, but Horner played down the decision\'s impact on Verstappen.\n\n>""I think he was surprised at the speed. But he could also see how much Liam was struggling,"" Horner said.\n\n>""He knows where we need to improve on the car. He\'s been working really hard with the engineering team.\n\n>""We had a very good session with him last week where he\'s just very focused on improving the car, finding those final few tenths to get us really on terms with the McLarens ahead.""\n\nVerstappen will have the opportunity to share his thoughts on the situation when he fulfils his media obligations on Thursday ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix.', 'Had Liam gone into Suzuka and failed to deliver, it would have been dismal and could have further damaged his confidence and abilities. The swap has been harsh, but it might be a blessing in disguise, as Liam will now have more time and a lot less pressure to perform and regain his confidence. Time will tell.', ""Liam looks like he's aged 3 years in the past 4 months."", ""I would have hoped that they had a better talk with Lawson and that he himself also figured that moving back was the better approach because he didn't see himself figuring the car out.\n\nSadly that's not the case and it's just RBR making that call for him.\n\nMaybe it is the right call, but missing sessions in Australia, super tricky conditions in the wet, and then a sprint weekend in China as your only experience is very rough, especially when they are both unknown tracks to him."", 'I can imagine some shock but he had nothing they could fall back on.', ""Not the first time Horner's comments contradict that of a former staff member."", 'Horner is just so full of shit.', 'Shocking! Didntg see it coming at all?', 'you gon learn today that when you yap, you better have the facts to back it up']",139,64,0.91,139,60,60,131,47,0.19000000000000006,131

1jp59f6,Phoenix Finance F1- A team that never rose from its ashes,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jp59f6/phoenix_finance_f1_a_team_that_never_rose_from/,2025-04-01, Throwback,"It's 2001, and everyone finished the season, and everyone was ready for a new season, well... except Prost. They had mounting debts, and it wasn't even insured that Prost would even compete in the 2002 season. They had offers from Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Pedro Diniz. Alain Prost didn't want to sell the team. He searched for sponsors. But when it was realised that no sponsors were found, the team was liquidated in January of 2002.

One of the possible asset buyers was Craig Pollock, the ousted BAR team principal. But the real buyer was the one and only. Tom Walkinshaw, the F1 version of being-everywhere man of the mid-90s. He outbid Paul Stoddart, who later became a Minardi team principal. Tom still owned Arrows. He was in a court case with Jos Verstappen over benching Jos for Heniz-Harald Frentzen. With the court still ongoing, he had to join up with someone, and that someone was Charlie Nickerson of Phoenix Finance Limited. So Charlie and Tom arranged that Charlie can run the team, and Tom would help with the assistance. Pollock would be the new team principal. Stoddart wasn't happy, to say the least. He thought that liquidation should have stayed in place. And he was not that wrong.

The thing is, they didn't buy the whole shares of the team. Instead, Charlie and the company bought some of the shares. As that was the case they were refused an entry for the 2002 season. They didn't went to Albert Park. They tried to go to the second race, in Malaysia, but they were refused entry there as well. Here are words of Bernie Eccelstone:
 ‚Äú[Nickerson has] bought nothing in Formula 1. All he has bought is some show cars. He can forget it. He is wasting his time thinking about racing in Malaysia.‚Äù And he was. Next thing you know, he changes the team name to DART Grand Prix to convince FIA(failed BADLY), then BACK to Phoenix Racing after failed entry in Imola, then Nickerson ends up suing F1 and FIA. It went as well as expected. Stoddart was a happy man.

Now the drivers in question are interesting, one of them was supposed to be Gaston Mazzacane and the other seat went to Tarso Marques. And also, Tom√°≈° Enge was possibly spotted testing the main machine. The machine was named the Phoenix Grand Prix AP04B. This was the Prost AP04 from 2001, however the car had the rear end of the Arrows AX3 Seater, a 3-seater car Arrows had designed a couple of years earlier. Rumors suggested that Chassis 3 was actually a Prost AP05 car but it is impossible to have this confirmed. Chassis 01 was a Prost AP04B. The cars appeared to be painted blue with no sponsor colours or logos.

The engines also came from the Arrows AX3 Seater, and were labeled as the Arrows T2-F1 V10. These engines had been used by Arrows in their F1 cars in 1998 and 1999, originating from a design by Brian Hart whose engine company was bought by Walkinshaw and merged into Arrows in the middle of 1997. The tyres were supposed to be provided by Bridgestone, however the Japanese company had already stated in early March that it would be unable to supply to Phoenix and Michelin said the same thing. So the most likely option at this point was a supply of Avon, yes Avon tyres, which Minardi had used a year before to shake down their PS01 car with Christijan Albers. The team was made up of approximately 50 employees; with most coming from the former Arrows test team and the folded Prost GP. With them were drivers Tarso Marques and Gast√≥n Mazzacane. Managing Director Charles Nickerson stayed at the Arrows base at Leafield where the team were using floor space to prepare the cars. 

In the end of this bizzare saga, nothing was heard or seen from the Phoenix Grand Prix team after Imola. A few races later Tom Walkinshaw‚Äôs Arrows team hit financial trouble. The team could not afford the ever-increasing costs of F1 anymore and collapsed following the German Grand Prix. The team‚Äôs A23 cars were a fundamentally good design however ‚Äì Paul Stoddart bought them with a view to using them as replacement to the PS03 in 2004 with Verstappen setting quick times in testing in the car, renamed as the Minardi PS04. Even later down the line, the A23 was used as the basis for Super Aguri‚Äôs first F1 car in 2006, the SA05, and while obviously dated and uncompetitive considering the advances made in the preceding years, provided a solid platform for the Japanese team to begin their F1 journey.

My moral of the story: Don't think you have everything if you ACTUALLY need everything.
