It makes you far more alert, increases focus, gives you an insane burst of energy, quickens your reactions and it even dilates your pupils so you can see better. It effectively turns you superhuman for a short while.\n\nIt evolved for life or death scenarios, but an adrenaline rush can still be triggered in certain circumstances, that are high-stress. During an F1 weekend this would certainly be triggered during Q3 and on Race Starts. The peak effects will last just a couple of minutes, but the effects are still felt for up to an hour.\n\nAdrenaline levels decrease with age, so the older drivers will not benefit from this to the same extent as younger drivers.

1h3a8k8,"What level are the F1 academy drivers actually on?
",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3a8k8/what_level_are_the_f1_academy_drivers_actually_on/,2024-11-30, Discussion,"Basically the title, but aside from the cars which are obviously even slower than F4, how good or how bad are the drivers? Obviously, Pulling and Pin would probably survive in a higher series or an open one in general, given that pulling does have some experience in British F4 and Pin even managed a podium in WEC which is quite impressive, but what about the rest of the grid? I'm assuming the ones with no points would probably also flounder in F4 regional, but do the top 5 or top 10 have a good shot at podiums in weaker f4 regionals, or even F3/F2 for drivers such as pulling and pin.

Furthermore, how do they stack up to actual F1/F2 drivers. Does someone like Bianca Bustamante actually have the skill to backup mocking actual f1 drivers like Lance Stroll, or would Lance Stroll in a wig lap every single f1 academy driver comfortably without breaking a sweat in equivalent machinery over a full grand prix length. Would a talented F3 rookie, like Piastri in his F3 years be able to smoke the girls even?

","[""Based on Marta Garc√≠a, who won F1 Academy last year. F4 level at best. Considering she's been at the back of the field in FRECA"", ""Some of them race in Formula regional Europe (category right below f3) and I don't think they are doing very well. So none of them have any decent chance to get to F1, F3 maybe someone could reach but I think F2 is still too far away. We like to meme about how bad Lance Stroll is but the whole F1A grid including Bianca is far worse. Stroll is not a bad racing driver just a bad f1 driver"", ""The whole point of F1A at this point in time is exposure. They're the trailblazers at this point. I don't think anyone expects any driver on the current grid to be making it to F2 or F1. The powers that be want little girls around the world to be dreaming about becoming race drivers. The female talent pool is simply too small at this point. The more girls we have interested in racing the better and hopefully the number of girls driving go karts goes up at the grassroots level."", 'Just check the results they achieve in GB4, F4 or FRECA.\n\nedit: starting with something postive: Palmowski seems to be pretty good. Finishing 2nd in GB4 in what seems to be her first year racing formula cars. She is also only 18, so younger than most f1a drivers. And i think she has a good chance of winning f1a next year.\n\n""\xa0Pulling and Pin would probably survive in a higher series or an open one in general,"" - short answer no\n\nPin and Garcia (last year\'s champion) raced this in year in FRECA and they scored 0 points with a best finish of 13th and 14th. Garcia is 24. Plenty of drivers in that series are 17.\n\nPin finished 10th in F4 UAE with Prema, okay but not crazy\n\nPulling competed in British F4 and finished in 7th winning a race. She is 21, older than Pourchaire was when he won f2 in his 3rd season. She raced in that series previously and compete in W-Series and f1 academy already\n\nWeug competed in italian and adac f4 in the past and freca. Scored points but again nothing crazy in terms of championship position. Also freca scored points but only finished 17 behind drivers that only copeted in half the races.\n\nThere is a reason why F1a exists and that is why i do not agree with Fl√∂rsch at all that they should just compete in the normal ONLY. F1A helps to get them some experience and exposure to sponsors (racing is expensive someone has to pay for it) and then join the normal series a year later or 2.', 'They have F4 cars, exactly the same model used in any F4 category out there\n\nSome of them race in EURO F4 or Formula Regional (between F4 and F3) but none of them achieved any important result.

Also, a lot of F1 academy drivers took part.\n\nBasically compared to the guy's best time, Abbi Pulling set the fastest womens time that was 3 seconds slower. Now there's some caveats of course; the women only had 3 hours in the car vs the guys who had 3 days, the women had no sim time at the track and obviously a lot their first time driving a car as fast/powerful as the current FE car.\n\nTo make it sound better, if you compare Pullings time to the guy's 1st session, she was about 1.3 seconds off the ultimate pace. Also have to caveat that with the track was at it's best when the women went out.
