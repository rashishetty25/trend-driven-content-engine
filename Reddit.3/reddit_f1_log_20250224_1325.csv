This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Also you have to bare in mind that in Hakkinen's prime, Schumacher had yet to win those 5 titles - at the end of 99, they were equal in titles, and even when he retired at the end of 2001, it was still only 4 - 2 in Schuamcher's favour (the same as Vettel - Alonso for comparison). I agree with you and think it's ridiculous to look back now, but it was often said at the time and not too surprising that a journalist of the time has it still in his head. Also, as good as Mark Hughes is, you have to take the British journalist angle into it as well, they never were bowled over by Michael due to his incidents (especially 1994) so they've always tempered their praise of him"", 'As someone who agrees Hakkinen is overrated, I can think of a few reasons his reputation is so high:\n\n- ‘The only driver Schumacher ever feared’ is a fun sounding narrative which a lot of people choose to believe in.\n\n- He retired early. Hakkinen got out after a poor 2001 season and it is often brushed away as just  an off year or a lack of motivation. If he had continued on for a few years and had more poor seasons it would have affected his reputation worse.\n\n- He was a better qualifier than racer. A lot of fans and experts put a lot of weight on qualifying as it’s the best indicator of ‘raw speed’.\n\n- People have a lot of admiration for him for coming back from his severe head injury in 1995.\n\n- He just comes across as a pretty nice guy in general. Your personality can have a big impact on how you are perceived, see Villeneuve for the opposite effect.\n\nA bit unrelated, but I also find it bizarre that Hughes puts the likes of Coulthard and Fisichella as evenly matched with drivers like Frentzen, Villeneuve or Barrichello. Hughes puts a lot of weight on qualifying pace when rating drivers, but that wouldn’t explain why he would rate Coulthard on par with the others, or even close to them considering he was a mediocre qualifier.', 'It\'s the ""being the only driver Schumacher feared"" nonsense.

1iwqacf,"Do we have a record lowest number of current drivers to have taken part in an earnest ""title battle""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iwqacf/do_we_have_a_record_lowest_number_of_current/,2025-02-24, Discussion,"Obviously, modern F1 fans are well aware of the level of net dominance we've seen in the past 15 years, with only 1 WDC winner since 2010 winning it fewer than 4 times. However, those 15 years have had very different outcomes, of some years seeing a straight cruise to the record books, versus others with a number of different drivers in contention right through the final race. 

Currently, our grid is not only very rookie-heavy, but the dominance over the most recent regulations cycle has dwindled the number of drivers to ever have taken part in an earnest title battle. 

At any point in any season, only Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, and Lando Norris have ever truly been in the running to win the WDC. Considering that 3 of them are champions themselves, that's a pretty surprising statistic. 

Considering that FOM themselves have hyped up long shots like Perez in 2023 or Bottas for a number of years, there are seasons in which a great deal of drivers have had more legitimate title shots than any of the other 15 drivers on this year's grid... but of course, with aspiring competitors in potentially top seats like Piastri, Lawson, Russell, and Antonelli, we may add to this list quickly!

Only Alonso and Raikkonen had really been in proper title fights before that season. So that's (x2).\n\n\nThis year Leclerc has never really been in the running for a title yet and Norris was barely in the running at all last season because the field got way more competitive in the second half so a bunch of teams and drivers, including his own teammate, took wins and points away from him when a dominant car like Verstappen had early season would have given him a much better chance of catching up Verstappen's gigantic lead. I'd honestly say only Alonso, Hamilton and Verstappen have been in proper title fights on the current grid. Including Norris is incorrect IMO. So (x3).\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Just had a look back from 1994-2006. Looks about right give or take depending on what you call a credible title contender. I don't really class Villeneuve as a credible challenge to Hill in their dominant 1996 Williams for example. Some might think it's harsh but to me he was no challenge to Hill in the championship the whole season.\xa0\n\n\n1994 Senna, Mansell (x2).\n\n\n1995 Mansell, Schumacher (x2).\n\n\n1996-1997 Schumacher, Hill (x2).\n\n\n1998 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve (x3).\n\n\n1999 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve, Hakkinen (x4).\n\n\n2000-2001 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Hakkinen, Irvine (x4).\n\n\n2002 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Irvine (x3).\n\n\n2003 Schumacher, Villeneuve (x2).\n\n\n2004-2005 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen (x3).\n\n\n2006 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen, Alonso (x4)\n\n\nSo quite a few seasons during this time have had 2 previous title contenders on the grid."", ""If the field was closer it would not have been that different, maybe Sainz/Russel , other than that who's good enough to be in the mix?"", ""will this year be pog to watch as someone who's never watched before?"", ""Alboreto was on the grid during that time wasn't he?
