I decided to look how many points both of them have scored in 2022-2024 seasons, where they have been teammates.

**George Russell:**

* 2022: 275 points
* 2023: 175 points
* 2024: 235 points
* Total: 685 points

**Lewis Hamilton:**

* 2022: 240 points
* 2023: 234 points
* 2024: 211 points
* Total: 685 points

So both of them have scored same amount of points across those three seasons!

What about number of wins between these two? Russell has scored three victories (Brazil 2022, Austria 2024 and Las Vegas 2024), whereas Hamilton has scored two (British 2024 and Belgium 2024).

In case Hamilton scores more points in Abu Dhabi, he will technically become third teammate to Russell who has outscored him over their time as teammates (Kubica did outscore him 1-0 in 2019 and if you want to count 2020, Bottas technically did outscore him 4-3 when they happened to be teammates for that one race).

And, if Russell scores more points, he will become the second teammate to Hamilton who has outscored him over their time as teammates (Button did outscore him 672-657 during 2010-2012 seasons)

So, who do you think will end up having more points in total across these three seasons?

Or do they both end up on same amount of points? This is only possible if either of these two scenarios occur:

1. Both of them end up outside the points (0 points for both) or
2. One of them finishes 9th in the race and the other one finishes 10th. And the one who finishes 10th in the race also drives fastest lap of the race. Both would end up getting 2 points from the race.

And yes, now this statistic will 100% be mentioned on broadcasts during this weekend!","['Now I want them both to DNF to keep this.', ""Russell 9th.
