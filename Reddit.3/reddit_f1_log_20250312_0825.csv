Last year Leclerc essentially admitted he’d drive the same way if fighting for a title, Lando will probably drive like that this year, Piastri will and Kimi will too. Heck, maybe even Lewis will go back to his old ways if he can challenge for the title. Normalcy is returning to F1.', 'Maldonado: ""On track you have no friends, you have to be ruthless because it is also a way to get respect from others.""', '>**Antonelli towards the debut in Australia: ""In F1 you have to be ruthless""**\n\n>The Australia GP will mark the return to F1 of an Italian pilot on an official weekend, with Andrea Kimi Antonelli who will debut at the wheel of the Mercedes W16 . The Bolognese pilot will thus complete its road to F1 reaching what she wanted to identify as a starting point rather than arrival. Despite this, the emotional component can only be intense on the eve of his first weekend in F1. Antonelli has already performed well with the W16 in Bahrain tests in terms of feeling with the car, but in a long interview released to the Sky Sport microphones he told how only by crossing the gates of the Melbourne paddock will manage to make how much road he really traveled.\n\n>**Antonelli: ""I will realize that I am in F1 only in the Paddock of Melbourne""**\n\n>Being a Formula 1 pilot involves numerous commitments from the winter stop, which Andrea Kimi Antonelli has said to have been intense in terms of preparation, inside and off the track. ""I stopped two weeks at Christmas and then went to Adidas, where I did some physical tests, then I did the first test, just to resume the pace a little,"" said the young Italian driver. ""I drove the Mercedes of 2020. A nice car monster."" Antonelli then told what is the feeling of being able to drive for the first time an F1 as a pilot holder on a race weekend; An emotion that, despite the first official commitments of the Prevalson, will only be unique when it arrives in the paddock in Australia. ""There was the event in London, then the Bahrain tests, but I think the first time I walk in the paddock will be the moment I will make and say \'it\'s all true\'."" \n\n>Before pointing his gaze to Australia, Kimi, however, recalled where all this began, with the video call of last summer in which the Mercedes leaders announced that he would lead Mercedes in 2025. ""I was at home with my parents and I made this video call and in which Toto were, James Allison, Bradley, all \'big\'. Toto immediately went straight to the point and said to me: \'I don\'t want to wait for you, next year you will be our F1 driver . I didn\'t sleep at the night, I was two hours to watch the ceiling. Relationship with Toto? He is a great person and I\'m happy to have a person like him by my side. "" \n\n>**Work with Bono and how the pressure is managed in F1**\n\n>But can an F1 pilot be afraid of something? ""As a child I was afraid of the darkness,"" said Antonelli. “A fear that maybe sometimes I can have is that of not performing, maybe to go to the track and say: \'But if not pierced and if I can\'t keep the same level? But I must say that on certain occasions it can help. "" A fear that the pilot who grew up in the Mercedes\' Academy, however, has been able to manage well to the sound of victories and titles conquered in the preparatory categories. Going beyond the pure performance gap of the vehicle available, one of the greatest changes that a pilot is facing is certainly due to the figures at his side. “On a race weekend for me and George there will be at least twenty engineers . It is very nice because however you go a lot more in detail. Maybe every engineer asks you a different thing about the car, obviously I interact a lot more with Bono [Peter Bonnington], which is my performance engineer , then there are all the others too. "" \n\n>Although today\'s rookie arrive in F1 with a level of preparation that is not a little advanced compared to what happened in the past, the pressure to be managed and the so -called \'to make the bones\' are aspects that only by experiencing the maximum protagonist category can you fully acquire. “It does not happen every day to be in this position, I had to work to arrive where I am now. I am happy to represent Italy in F1 and the goal is to bring the Italian flag back to the top step of the podium , "" he said speaking between past and present. A key role in his path Antonelli relegated him to the family and his father Marco, thanks to a decades of experience in Motorsport. “To manage the pressure in the first place I speak with my father . Then, however, a small group of people you trust and with whom you have the confidence that you can express how you feel, especially in the most difficult moments, is enough. "" \n\n>**On the opponents in F1: “I have already noticed how ruthless Max is. In F1 there are no friends. "" And then he jokes: ""On the kart I beat Leclerc\'s time""**\n\n>After his announcement as an official pilot, the 2006 Bolognese pilot took part in two free sessions, where he said he immediately understood what it means to run against drivers of the caliber of Max Verstappen. “I have already noticed how ruthless Max is , for example FP1 in Mexico I was preparing for this lap and he pulled me a detached just last sector of the last lap. Outside you have no friends, you have to be due because it is also a way to get respect from others . Obviously respecting the rules, but you have to show that you are not there to play, do seriously. "" Moving instead on a nicest anecdote, Kimi Antonelli told about when, during a holiday in Greece, he beat the record signed by Leclerc in a Kartodromo in Mykonos. “Apparently yes, I beat his time. It was very nice because they were kart for rental but modified, so I was impressed. "" To try to beat the Monegasque pilot and beyond, the Italian rookie will not have to wait much, because the GP of its debut in Australia is now upon us. ""I am sure that if you start on the right foot it will be a good year and it will be fun,"" concluded Kimi.', 'Very curious to see how this kid develop.', ""Love to hear it. He already has so much pressure on his young shoulders. But I'm genuinely rooting for this kid. And it feels so weird to call an F1 driver a kid but it's the first time an F1 driver is actually younger than me."", 'This season will be fun with so many rookies....and Stroll', 'Probably the Rookie I\'m most excited to watch this coming season.\n\nBearman is obviously my favourite, although the bromance Ollie and Kimi had whilst at Prema was great, and the vibes I get from Kimi as a result, and from subsequent interviews is that he\'s a great kid himself\n\nBut Kimi is the one going straight in at a top team\n\nIf the other rookies dont get results its kind of understandable, even Kimi really with the experience that he\'s going up against, and dont just mean Russell - But when he delivers its going to be exciting to see. Almost the same with Lawson at Red Bull, but because he\'s not coming into F1 with the same hype its not as ""exciting""']",2854,229,0.98,2854,5868,5868,12,0,0.0,12

Alpine and Renault were more or less the same given they are both the Enstone team.', 'Hi everyone!\n\nThis is an updated version of a post I did some years ago ([here](https://reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/gnce67/race_wins_colored_by_team_improved_version/)). All data comes from [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/) (thanks!).\n\n### Constructor Race Wins I\n\nTo start: constructors/teams [1] race winners (with at least 20 wins). Dots inside of the squares are used instead of similar colours to more easily identify the teams. I tried to choose the most famous historical colours of the team, but sometimes I had to pick other colours to make the image more readable - for instance, McLaren got the more recent orange rather than the traditional red/white/silver. Indianapolis 500 winners are marked separately because, despite being part of the F1 WDC, most F1 teams did not participate in it and vice-versa.\n\nMercedes dominance between 2014-2020 creates a very visible teal mark, but we can also see other teams with strong year(s): Mclaren in the end of the 80s, Ferrari in the 50s and 00s, Red Bull last years (2021-2024). The legacies of Ferrari, and McLaren are clear: the largest interval between wins was 4 years (!) for Ferrari (1990 - 1994) and 9 years for McLaren (2012 - 2021). Williams was also very impressive in the 80s and 90s, but since then they\'ve had only a few wins in the early 2000s and their last win in 2012 (by Maldonado).\n\n### Constructor Race Wins II\n\nWe can expand this plot to all race winners, and also add columns with the WCC winner and the team with the most wins. There are some years where multiple teams have the same number of wins, and in those cases the WCC, if one of them, is selected (otherwise it\'s random).\n\nThere are some solitary wins from many teams, usually a mixture of brilliant racing and a great share of luck, more recently Toro Rosso (2008), Alpha Tauri (2020), Racing Point (2020) and Alpine (2021). And there are also some ""one-season wonder"" teams with amazing (but short) performances like Brawn (2009) and Renault (2005/6). It\'s also interesting to see that, alongside the periods of the stronger teams (Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes in the last decade), we have legendary teams popping up, having some good seasons, and disappearing again: Alfa Romeo (the first champions), Vanwall, Lotus, Tyrrell, Brabham and even Maserati.\n\nThere are some seasons where the WCC is not the team with most wins (e.g. just a couple of years ago, in 2021), usually because the second driver falls short of the competition. Amazingly, in 1982, the WCC was Ferrari with 3 wins, despite both McLaren and Renault having 4 wins each! Reliability is important!\n\n### Driver Race Wins\n\nWe can also look at which drivers won races. Added all drivers over 20 wins and 2 others: Sir Stirling Moss, the driver with the most wins without a WDC and Sir Jack Brabham, the legendary driver/team owner that won a WDC and WCC driving his own car (1966). The years in the legend are for the first and last wins.\n\nThe sheer number of Schumacher and Hamilton wins is just breath-taking. Every year from 1992 to 2021, one of them won at least one race, together winning around 36% of all races in those years. The fact that Schumacher\'s last win was in 2006 and Hamilton\'s first was in 2007 makes it look like a passing of the flame. Schumacher\'s 2004 is probably the most impressive start of any driver with 12 wins out of the first 13 races.\n\nThere are many other impressive drivers: Vettel, with his third most wins and the current record for consecutive wins (9! in 2013); Clark, the driver with most wins for 4 years, despite only 2 WDCs; Lauda, with wins across more than a decade. The rivalry between Prost and Senna is also notorious, with both drivers trading wins most years, and fighting for WDCs.\n\nAs with teams, it is not always the case that the driver with most wins is the WDC winner. The most recent example is 2016, where Rosberg won the WDC with a win less, due to better consistency (aka more 2nd places). Reliability was incredibly important also: in 1958, Moss had 4 wins (and a 2nd place) to Hawthorn\'s 1 win (and 5 2nd places), but every other race was a DNF. There are also cases where the WDC was decided by the best N results and not total number of points, e.g., in 1964, both Surtees and G. Hill had 2 wins, Surtees won the WDC with 40 points, despite Hill having scored a total of 41 points, since only 39 counted for the WDC.\n\n### The Complete Mess - Driver & Team Wins\n\nNow for a completely incomprehensible graphic, we can join both the teams and the drivers. I tried to pick colours and shapes that allowed to distinguish both the teams and drivers, but it\'s still quite confusing.\n\nThere isn\'t much new here. We can see Brabham\'s glory year (1966), where he won WDC and WCC as driver and team owner. We can also see Fangio\'s WDCs with 4 teams: Alfa Romeo (1951), Mercedes (1954/55), Ferrari (1956) and Maserati (1957). The different teams Prost won in while Senna mostly won at McLaren. The winning combos of Ferrari+Schumacher and Mercedes+Hamilton.\n\n1: The difference between ""team"" and ""constructor"" is a bit fuzzy, so I\'ll use them interchangeably, despite not being the same thing, for simpleness.\n\n### Extra Plots\n\nI also did a bunch of other, not as interesting, plots that you can find [here](https://imgur.com/a/X1iwA93). It includes similar plots for team with the most points, pole positions, fastest lap. It also includes more general plots like number of unique winning teams in a year (2012 with the record of 7 different teams!) and how consistent are the top teams.\n\nPlease feel free to ask for any plots you would like to see!', 'I\'m very grateful for putting the 2 ""Lotus"" wins as other. Too many of these things include them with Team Lotus.', 'I think you dont understand tetris!', ""I know, online, many folks say that the teams constructors doesn't matter much, especially for team like Red Bull, but man losing last year's constructors to McLaren must really sting them."", 'Damn.
