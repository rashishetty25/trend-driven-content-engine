One key feature of the brands’ fan engagement will include the launch of the world’s first Season Ticket, giving one lucky fan and a plus one access to every Grand Prix on the calendar with travel and accommodation included. Crafted from carbon fibre and precision-engineered rivets, the ticket symbolises speed, craftsmanship, and connection.

The season ticket will help fans not only enjoy the spectacle of live racing but also connect with other fans all around the world.
