I saw you do this at least another two times: ‘We are not the favorites.’ Do you think a change of mindset is needed?”

Lando: “No, I can say what I want, I can think what I want, I tell you what I always am, I always try and be as honest as I can be. If I don't think we're going to be quick, I don't think we're going to be quick. And I'm not saying I'm going to be 10th, I'm just saying I think it's going to be difficult to win. We were a long way off, just go and look at the data from last year, look at the race trace, we were miles off. And there's been plenty of races where we've not been quick enough this year, so it's not like we've won every single race and you're expecting me to say those things.

I'm just giving my opinion on ‘Do I think it's going to be as easy?’ I won last weekend by 30 seconds, very, very easy. I won today by pushing a lot more, only 10 seconds, and Max was probably the quickest out on track today.

Do I think that at a track that we've never been good at, we were very good here two years ago, we almost challenged Max for the win, we've never been good in Vegas. So why am I going to think, ‘Yeah, it's going to be fine, whatever?’ I'm giving my opinion, I'm giving my honest opinion on how I think we're going to be. We've never been good there, so I'm not the most confident about going into this race.

Maybe I'll win, then we'll see. But I'm not going to lie and say ‘Yeah, I'm very confident and I think it's going to be an easy weekend’ because I don't think that's how it's going to be. So no, I mean, you're very right to have your own opinion on what you think I should say and what I should not say and whatever, but I'll do what I like.”","['Honestly this is such a clear and precise answer for Lando, who in the past sometimes struggled to get his point across.

This year hasn't been great, but it's not the absolute worst season of Ferrari. They had worse ones. For example, 2020, when they had the worst result since 40 years. They had worse one in 2014, when alonso had to drive the most unstable car in f1 that had unique ability to understeer and oversteer at the same time. 

I just watched brazilian GP after another double DNF, but it's not like Ferrari is fighting for anything. Their real last chance is gonna be in Las Vegas. 

But there have definitely been a lot more painful moments for Ferrari team than today's race or double dsq in China. 

Like the image from Singapore 2017 or Vettel's crash in Germany 2018 or Leclerc's engine failures in 2022 alongside his crash in France that destroyed his chances for title.

1osgskk,I looked at 800 overtakes from the last 30+ years at Interlagos. Here’s where you actually want to sit,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osgskk/i_looked_at_800_overtakes_from_the_last_30_years/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I’ve always heard people say the Senna S is the best place to watch the Brazilian GP, but I wanted to know if that’s actually true. So I went through data from the past 30+ years (roughly 1990–2023) and looked at around **800 on-track overtakes** at Interlagos to see where the action really happens.

**Main Straight / Start–Finish, Best overall**  
About half of all overtakes happen here. The long DRS zone and slipstreaming make it the busiest part of the circuit, and you see cars pull out to pass right in front of you. Plus you get the start, pit stops, and podium. **Grandstand A** is the go-to spot if you want overtakes and atmosphere in one.

**Turn 1 (Senna S), Pure action**  
Roughly a quarter of the overtakes happen here. Cars come flying down the straight and dive under braking. It’s chaotic on lap 1 and great throughout the race.  
**Grandstand M** sits right at the end of the straight with a perfect view into the Senna S, while **Grandstand B** is slightly further back but still sees the braking zone and the start of the corner.

**Turn 4 (Descida do Lago), Underrated gem**  
Around 10 % of the overtakes happen here. It’s the second DRS zone, downhill, and you often get side-by-side moves that carry through the corner. **Grandstand G** looks straight down the hill and gives a great sense of speed.

**Best spot**  
If you combine the main straight and Turn 1, you’re looking at roughly **80 % of all overtakes** over the past three decades, which matches what most F1 analysis sites say about Interlagos’ two DRS braking zones being where nearly everything happens.

**Turn-by-Turn Ranking (top 8)**

| Rank | Location       | Total Overtakes | % of Total | Avg/Race |
|------|----------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| 1    | Main Straight  | 471             | 53.2%      | 14.7     |
| 2    | Turn 1         | 227             | 25.6%      | 7.1      |
| 3    | Turn 4         | 80              | 9.0%       | 2.5      |
| 4    | Turn 2         | 24              | 2.7%       | 0.8      |
| 5    | Turn 6         | 19              | 2.1%       | 0.6      |
| 6    | Turn 3         | 13              | 1.5%       | 0.4      |
| 7    | Turn 10        | 10              | 1.1%       | 0.3      |
| 8    | Turn 12        | 9               | 1.0%       | 0.3      |

**TL;DR:**

* **Main Straight (Grandstand A)** – best all-round experience and most overtakes (~50% of overtakes)
* **Turn 1 (Grandstand M or B)** – most dramatic corner action (~25% of overtakes)
* **Turn 4 (Grandstand G)** – cheaper and still plenty going on (~9% of overtakes)

If you can get a seat that shows both the straight and the Senna S, you’ll catch almost all the overtakes live.
