Leaving the safety issue of refueling aside, which other series have addressed, refueling adds the variable of fuel distance to the equation. 

Adding a second mandatory pit stop for tires would, for some races, could bring some different tire strategies into play. For example instead of a one pit strategy of Med to Hard, a two pit strategy of Soft, Soft, Hard. 

What other options would introduce more variables into race strategies and potentially reduce the likelihood of some races just being a procession?

Edit:  Some tracks make it very difficult to pass and sometimes only with DRS. With the high reliability of cars, there usually isn‚Äôt high attrition except for accidents. That means strategy is the thing that can make the difference. ","['Why the need of artificial ways of creating more drama? We could even add sprinklers as Bernie suggested.', 'Hm.  I prefer as little artificial factors as possible.  A forced second pit stop would not increase my enjoyment.', 'I don‚Äôt really want  a second mandatory pit stop.
