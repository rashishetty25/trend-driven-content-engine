Here's the breakdown of points:,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h7vfi2/max_verstappen_on_the_verge_of_doubling_sergio/,2024-12-06, Statistics,"Max Verstappen has scored **921.5** points more than Pérez so far. Currently, Verstappen has scored **1.99** times Pérez's points.

If Verstappen outscores Pérez by at least **11** points in the final race, his total will be exactly **2.0** times Pérez's total.

**Year-by-Year Points Analysis:**

|**Year**|**Verstappen Points**|**Pérez Points**|**Points Difference**	|**Verstappen % of Total Points**	|**Pérez % of Total Points**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021| 395.5 | 190 | 205.5 | 67.5 | 32.5% |
|2022| 454 | 305 | 149 | 59.8% | 40.2% |
|2023| 575 | 285 | 290 | 66.9% | 33.1% |

|**Total**|**1853.5**|**932**|**921.5**|**N/A**	|**N/A** |

 💡 **Fun Facts**

* Verstappen has scored approximately **66.5**% of Red Bull's points since 2021, while Pérez contributed just **33.5**%.

Leaving the safety issue of refueling aside, which other series have addressed, refueling adds the variable of fuel distance to the equation. 

Adding a second mandatory pit stop for tires would, for some races, could bring some different tire strategies into play. For example instead of a one pit strategy of Med to Hard, a two pit strategy of Soft, Soft, Hard. 

What other options would introduce more variables into race strategies and potentially reduce the likelihood of some races just being a procession?

Edit:  Some tracks make it very difficult to pass and sometimes only with DRS. With the high reliability of cars, there usually isn’t high attrition except for accidents. That means strategy is the thing that can make the difference. ","['Why the need of artificial ways of creating more drama? We could even add sprinklers as Bernie suggested.', 'Hm.  I prefer as little artificial factors as possible.  A forced second pit stop would not increase my enjoyment.', 'I don’t really want  a second mandatory pit stop. It starts to reek of what NASCAR does now with their dumbass stages. Takes tire strategy out of it.
