1. Lando Norris 390
2. Oscar Piastri 366
3. Max Verstappen 366

Breakdown: 

Lando needs to piece together 35 points out of a possible 58 available. Why? Because if Max or Oscar takes all 58 that would give them both a possible 424 total points. By taking all 58 I mean they win the Sprint of Qatar, the Grand Prix and then Abu Dhabi. So if you’re rooting for Lando he just needs 35 points which would give him 425. If you want Oscar or Max to win you hope Lando can’t scrounge out 35 points and scoop as many points as you can. ","['Thanks!

George Russell and others seem to ignore the fact, these people love it and get an experience many would PAY $1000s for?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p8jk9x/i_dont_get_the_anger_at_f1_and_fia_for_volunteer/,2025-11-28, Discussion,"i dont see it as abuse, i see it as symbiotic. 

 people love it and would actually PAY f1 to do it. Do they even talk to the people? of just think ""what billion dollar f1 isnt paying them???"" also alot of people in all these countries would never be able to get a ticket or get this close to the action. as it would be like 4 months pay or more

i do 100% think better training, better communication. or having  a mix of a few who are paid for the highest risk moments and to make sure the non paid people are being safe is a good thing. they can do more. but lets not just kill it becasue its not perfect

plus its part of the history. is f1 using them? Yeah kinda, but maybe, but just speak to these people and ask them. also if you pay them it changes everything.  no way would the same people get these gigs.

to be honest it seems a bit ivory tower like of George Russell telling f1 to kill something thats really important to alot of people and supports local racing club etc.
