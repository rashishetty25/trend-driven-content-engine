There is no point of moving up to shifters once you learned everything from TAG racing. Such as\n\n‚Ä¢ being smooth with the steering wheel  ‚Ä¢braking late as possible and getting on throttle as early as possible  \n‚Ä¢keeping minimum speed thru corner apex as high as possible. This is learned in younger categories because those karts have way less power. \n‚Ä¢general race-craft\n‚Ä¢developing confidence\n‚Ä¢driving in different weather and track conditions \n\nOnce you learn everything from TAG racing you might as well move into cars because you would want to continue your professional racing career.

There are a lot of drivers running kz2 that will be and are already in F1 (Nyck de Vries, Kimi Antonelli (he did Kz for the world championship), Logan Sargeant, Carlos Sainz, Pierre Gasly etc.) \n\n3rd It‚Äôs an insane learning curve, most of the things you learn from ok/okj/mini get thrown out the window, you sort of need to re-learn karting\n\n4th  is that winning the world karting championship is no easy feat, in kz/kz2  you are battling guys that have been at it for over 10 years, every weekend driving the same tracks and same kart. Seat time is very important in racing', 'On a side note, shifters look like soo much fun, and I really hope a televised series with onboards can come to fruition', 'Karting techniques aren‚Äôt 1:1 to racing cars, it‚Äôs the starting point for drivers because it‚Äôs the only racing you can do from a young age. \n\nBut other than the high level grip circle, reaction time, and wheel to wheel racing experience the actual driving technique is not the same in karts as it is in cars. \n\nSo it makes more sense to go to cars as soon as able then doing more karting.', 'I kept on reading ‚Äúwhy did F1 driver rarely join the shittier karting championships‚Äù.
