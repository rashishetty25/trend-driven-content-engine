The car that gets to the apex of the corner first is entitled to all the space they want.

1nm2dwg,Best Baku Times (All Qualifying and All Qualifying and FP2/3,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nm2dwg/best_baku_times_all_qualifying_and_all_qualifying/,2025-09-20, Statistics,"Never been a fan of the 3 session qualifying and with all the red flags I wondered what the timesheets would look if the best times were used in qualifying and what they would look like with Free Practice 2 and 3 times (more akin to the Friday / Saturday qualifying days of old).

Sainz is would drop the most with his team mate Albon gaining a mid grid slot. McLaren and Ferrari (esp in the second table where Hamilton is on the 2nd row) gain a lot.


","[""Thanks for posting this, really valuable when we didn't get the clear Q3 comparisons we usually get. McLaren seem to still have good pace, Piastri would be kicking himself for the crash if not for Lando also failing to put in a decent final lap. \n\nTomorrow probably either they both fairly easily overtake on the start-finish but fail to catch Verstappen or they get stuck in traffic with DRS unable to make up the time lost in the 90 degree turns. Both scenarios Piastri can be very happy with, any weekend where Lando gets reduced points from finishing down the grid is more or less a win for him if he keeps it on track himself. Start will be fairly critical, if Piastri can manage to get Hadjar out of the way, he can just match Norris on strategy to bring it home and be satisfied with another weekend that moves his advantage relatively further ahead."", 'This just makes me sad for Ferrari. Ham has the third fastest lap over the weekend so far and is P12 because Ferrari thought 6 lap old softs would do the trick.', 'I mean last time didnt Lando go from 15 to 4? I very much expect easy overtakes for moth McLaren, both top 5 Im guessing.', 'Yes most likely it will be fairly easy to overtake tomorrow, but it does still depend on the conditions and if there have been even small changes to the DRS layout. For tracks where overtaking is so DRS dependent, it can easily switch between extremely easy and almost impossible to overtake. It was good last year, 22/23 IIRC were pretty meh\n\nIf i was forced to guess, yeah we get another Verstappen 1st, McLarens 1-2 tomorrow.']",16,4,0.77,16,4,4,16,4,0.77,16
1nm29ab,Missed opportunity or wrong call?

It couldn‚Äôt have been ‚Äì if there was a yellow flag further back or a red, we would have looked like the heroes and everyone else would have looked like losers. Now I kind of look like the loser and them heroes, but it‚Äôs the price you pay sometimes around here and the risks you‚Äôve got to take. It was still spitting a little bit, so I think anyone who was further back, just more grip. just a decision that didn‚Äôt work out in the end. something we‚Äôll review and try to do better next time‚Äù*\n\nHindsight is everything, but I think given the way the session had gone up to that point, going out first wasn\'t necessarily a bad decision. With highsight now we\'re able to know he didn\'t actually have that much to lose by going out later (worst he would\'ve started if he didnt set a time was p8) but in the moment you don\'t know what the conditions are going to be and how many more flags are gonna come out. I think he pushed the limits as best he could. It was a scruffy lap from him but given when he went out, I don\'t think he was ever on for the top 3 or so. Maybe p5 if he hadn\'t tapped the wall but I think he was already down a bit before that mistake due to grip conditions.\n\nA shame since his first two laps in q3 were looking super strong until he had to abort, but that\'s how it goes and obviously everyone else was affected as well.', ""Damned if you do, damned if you don't with going out late or early. Just a missed opportunity of gaining an advantage on Piastri. Now let's hope McLaren let them race without any stupid Papaya rules."", 'It‚Äôs only Saturday. These talks may not age well.', '*""No, because I still did everything I could. If I\'d won every race, I could be world champion by now. But I didn\'t, you know?.
