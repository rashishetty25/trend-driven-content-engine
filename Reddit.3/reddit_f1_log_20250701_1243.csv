Now that the dust (and smoke) has settled at the Red Bull Ring, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more **detailed and thoughtful discussion** than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Please avoid low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').","[""That was a decent race. First part of the race with Piastri actually being in the DRS of Norris was really fun. I just felt a bit disappointed after the race that Piastri never got back into DRS after the first round of pitstops. I really wanted a close drs battle till the end but we never got it.\n\nI've already mentioned it in another thread yesterday, but backmarkers are frustrating me this season. Watch your mirrors! Listen to your race engineer! Why do they have to almost take the race leaders out?\n\nAlso can I just say that the Red Bull Ring is one of the best tracks we currently have for racing? There isn't just one overtaking opportunity. There are only a few real corners, but the track gives the option for battles to go on for multiple corners and makes the drivers have to actually think about where they overtake another car. I'm happy that it got renewed until 2041. And if we need to have sprints, can we please have it in Austria again next year? It's one of the best places for it."", 'There were a lot of comments in the Race Thread and Post-Race Thread from people who were unhappy with Oscar\'s strategy and with the radios from McLaren about Oscar\'s flatspot. They thought that McLaren should have called Oscar in immediately after the flatspot. There also seems to be a bit of confusion about the sequence of events, so I went on the onboards to have a look and listen. \n\nLando and Will begin discussing their pit options on Lap 19. At the beginning of Lap 20, Will signals to Lando that he will pit soon. In the middle of Lap 20, Lando gets explicit instructions to box. \n\nImmediately after that, Oscar tries the (at best, ambitious) maneuver that gets him his flatspot. The McLarens continue on for the rest of the half lap. While Lando approaches the pit entry, Oscar gets told that Lando will pit and to see how he does in free air. \n\nSome might say that Oscar could have been told to pit immediately after he got the flatspot. That doesn\'t make sense though. His situation wasn\'t a dire one that necessitated an immediate pit. Furthermore, the mechanics were already in place with Lando\'s tires. Pitting Oscar first would increase chances of a mix-up.\n\nNow, Oscar doesn\'t respond until he gets to the end of the lap. As Tom reiterates that he wants best pace until target lap, Oscar tells him about the flat spot. Tom tells him to see how he does in clear air. \n\nIn the second sector, Tom tells him that the flatspot doesn\'t seem bad on the data and tells Oscar to ""let him know."" In the third sector, Oscar says that it\'s not pleasant but okay. They then do not pit at the end of Lap 21. \n\nThis is supported by the data that shows Oscar go faster than the previous laps and also faster than Lando\'s inlap. \n\nI assume that if Oscar had said or performed otherwise, they would have pitted on Lap 23. Remember that McLaren was also not ready to double-stack since they were presumably already in front of the box with Lando\'s tires when Oscar made his move. Thus, Lap 23 would have been the earliest (safest) time for them to pit.\n\nOn Lap 22, Oscar gets asked the 4 with delta vs. 1.5 behind question. He answers it at the end of Lap 22: 4 with delta.\n\nFor me, McLaren\'s actions seem very reasonable.', ""something is seriously wrong with the Alpine car. Last 2-3 races I think an argument could be made it's legitimatley the slowest car on the grid."", ""On a positive note, Racing Bulls are finding their footing in several places. It is fantastic to see Lawson get those points, and it bodes well for the sister team, knowing that not only Lawson does have his star moments for solid drives, but he and Hadjar can respectfully work on those collectively, whilst building up confidence and experience on their own as an individual driver. \n\nI don't normally agree with terms branded by the viewers of the sport, but in this instance, there is very little wonder why people are labelling a move to Red Bull from the sister team as a *demotion*. \n\nMore of this from VCARB, please! Sauber and VCARB picking up the pace is fun for the midfield battle in the standings, and I am excited to see them hop into the mix"", 'McLaren are handling it all ok so far, but if Oscar and Lando remain this close up to the last races, it will be all out war.', 'I know there have been some complaints about the message to Oscar about the move in turn 4 being too marginal, but I genuinely think/wonder if this is something they\'ve talked and agreed about as a team (either at the start of the season, or at the very least after Canada) that they will receive that kind of feedback in race if the situation warrants it. Andrea Stella has said in interviews that they have ""written our racing principles together with our drivers"", so it seems to me Lando and Oscar feel a strong sense of responsibility to be able to have such freedom to race and they take that responsibility seriously. I think Oscar and Lando know exactly how unique the situation they\'ve found themselves in with such freedom to race (without the need for the team to be too worried about other teams/drivers) and they don\'t take that lightly.', ""On a different topic I haven't really seen discussed too much, Williams had an absolutely terrible weekend. To multiple problems with Carlos's car starting in quali (I think he damaged it in a trip through the gravel), his car blowing up before the race, and Alex having a mechanical failure while he was P6, forcing him to retire. Hoping they rebound and have a good home race for Silverstone."", ""I may be mistaken, but at one point toward the end of the race, I thought there was a situation where Lando was lapping a group of three cars, and when he got by the final one, that car then looked to be trying to overtake Lando again and the commentary said that driver does have the right to try to unlap himself.\n\nAm I misremembering and/or misunderstanding something?

This performance was confirmed once the team moved to Aston Martin with a podium finish for Sebastian Vettel in 2021 in Baku (then a second in Hungary) and nine for Fernando Alonso in 2023.\n\n>Szafnauer will not have had the same opportunity at Alpine, in particular because of Luca de Meo\'s expectations. ""The last time I spoke to him was in Montreal in 2023 [four rounds before his ousting in Belgium, Editor\'s note]. I explained to him that it would take time to implement a paradigm shift within the team. I told him how long it would take, to which he replied, \'I don\'t have that time.

It just shows that bad decisions by management always cause bad results on the track.""\n\n>The Italian\'s recent surprise resignation from his post as Renault Group CEO came as a surprise to Otmar Szafnauer.

So there\'s not a big correlation between track and production vehicles,"" he comments. "" Maybe they\'ll say, \'We bought this team for next to nothing and it\'s now worth a billion and a half.

Baku, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi, Abu Dhabi (5 races)

China, Japan, Singapore, Australia (4 races)

Canada, Mexico, Brazil, US x3 (6 races)

[Rightly] lots of Europe (9 races)

These now look like 4 logical race series that make up the world championship. A European series, an American series, a Pacific Series, and a West Asian series. If the fixtures were shuffled so that these blocks were run consecutively, the logistics would get cheaper and the environmental impact would be lower - but I think it has more potential to generate interest in ""continental"" points/trophies. Winning all 4 series in a year would be a ""Grand Slam"" season for a driver/team - a more challenging thing to achieve than ""just"" taking the world title, especially for drivers in leading teams with a fairly evenly matched driver in the other car. 

There would be 4 end-of-series races that are much more likely to be a down-to-the-wire points shootout than the final race of the season is.

Including equipment and cars at the end of every weekend. \n\nIt\'s important for European races to all be grouped because you can haul by truck. But let\'s be real. They flew out to Bahrain for testing. Back to England. Australia. Back to England, China, England, Japan, England, Bahrain, England etc etc etc.', 'So you are proposing that everyone stays on the road for 3/4 of the season.', ""I don't know if it's still true but they used to have two sets of equipment which is why they alternate often between continents. One set is shipping as the other set is in use."", 'Grouping races together is not more sustainable since it means the freight has to be flown instead of shipped to meet the timescales of races being next to each other in the calendar.\nThere are multiple sets of freight and the calendar is currently organised to try and minimise freight flights.', 'No. It is too different than the current F1 format. \n\nThe logistic of F1 are well documented. I doubt the logistic saving are something the teams care about. It is pocket change for them. \n\nThe format seems nice on paper. Europe is much well connected than the rest. America is really large. Probably a travel from Europe to US is cheaper than from Brazil to Mexico. Similarly Eastern Asia, Australia Singapore.\n\nThere are several F4 series around the world. Local sponsors would put some money, but not a lot. Participants drop some series because they are too far and too expensive to cover costs.', 'Here\'s the positives. I like the idea about hyping up different things in a Grand Slam type way. But, like with golf and tennis, a grand slam doesn\'t mean they\'re together in the calendar, it generally means throughout the calendar, so I don\'t think it would need to be for this either. There could be regional leaderboards for driver and constructor. Note that Africa might be added, so that would have to be given a region. South Africa doesn\'t exactly fit geographically with anything else, but that doesn\'t mean it shouldn\'t be added to the calendar. If something was going to by hyped up with separate leaderboards, I think rather than location, street circuit vs road course could be it. There\'s a lot of middle ground honestly in F1, and some ""street"" circuits are actually more like traditional circuits, because some are purpose built, but they could assign them.\n\nScheduling alone is a difficult mathematic problem. Venues have other events. There\'s weather patterns to consider.\n\nThen there\'s the thing people here never talk about. Monza and Imola have been very far apart in the calendar for good reason. Because I\'m sure it\'s one of the more likely races for people to go to both of. If you had them on back to back weeks, don\'t you think more people would go to both? Spa and Zandvoort are on opposite sides of summer break as well.\n\nYou might say, yeah, that make sense, we can jump around Europe because everything in Europe is close enough together, so we can avoid putting races near each other next to each other to improve fan experience. But then, when you do that, you\'re admitting that you don\'t mind making it better for Europe, but not for the rest of the world.\n\nIf someone in Australia is going to go to two races, the second is probably Singapore, third is Japan. If you have them back to back weeks, people are much less likely to go to more than one.\n\nIf someone in North America goes to multiple races, it\'s probably two in North America for most of them. If all of them are back to back to back, that makes it much less likely. They are trying Miami and Canada together next year, so we\'ll see how that goes. Except, as always when there\'s a week or more between races, all the drivers and most of the staff will go back to Europe between races. People just don\'t want to be away from home that long when there are two weekends off.', ""Tell me you don't understand climate without telling me you don't understand climate""]",0,22,0.35,0,93,93,0,0,0.019999999999999962,0

The Vegas romance between her and Sonny was so unnecessary and she somehow failed to make the car into anything other than a shitbox for more than 2 years until Sonny basically gave her a breakthrough idea in like his first month there.', ""I think this is emblematic of the biggest issue in the film: it is simply trying to do too much and so it does not really give itself the opportunity to do any one thing well. Here are all of the subplots that the film is trying to juggle:\n\n* Sonny's habit of racing despite his injuries.\n* Sonny's hostile relationship with the press.\n* Pearce trying to make a name for himself as quickly as possible.\n* Ruben's efforts to manage the relationship between the drivers.\n* Banning's attempt to hijack the team.\n* Kate's struggle to make it in Formula 1.\n* Jodie's lack of confidence potentially letting the team down.\n\nThere are just so many subplots that the film's only solution is to work through them as quickly as possible. Take the team itself -- APX is clearly able to attract world-class talent, since Kasper was a team principal at Ferrari and Kate worked at Lockheed-Martin. The film seems to be aiming for the idea that APX has everything it needs for a breakthrough, but they just cannot get the stars to align. However, it then gets distracted by off-track -- and worse, off-camera -- politics that threaten to undermine the team. Its solution to this problem is to have Sonny say a few words of encouragement to Jodie and then have the team go for a run together and suddenly they all work well. Check that box and then move on to the next subplot that needs to be resolved. Sometimes these things fit together pretty well; Sonny's relationship with and management of the team is in contrast to Pearce's, which fuels the tension between them. But because another subplot comes up, the film has no time to breathe.\n\nA character like Kate had the potential to be interesting. She gave up a career working for Lockheed-Martin to join Formula 1, chasing those few tenths of a second that could make the team great. It costs her everything, but she persists because she loves it, even though she cannot explain why. She is probably the person who can come closest to understanding Sonny's feeling of flying, and she is the person who can take that ephemeral feeling and turn it into a physical thing. There is a natural relationship there, but it should not be a romantic one. The film really wobbles in the pub scene because it presents Sonny's charm as flirting. It should have reframed it as him trying to persuade her into supporting him because he thinks Kate has to work *for* him when in reality he needs to work *with* her.\n\nWe know the film went through some reshoots because they were filming at Silverstone in 2023 and 2024. I suspect that the Banning scenes were a late addition -- the framing of the shots on the grid where the cars are behind the camera make me think that this was filmed separately and then spliced in. A lot of the complaints about the film stem from people not really understanding the Banning subplot, probably because it comes up so late. He goes from a goofy supporter of Ruben to a cutthroat board member in the blink of an eye, and the transformation happens off-camera, so I suspect the character was added in or rewritten at the last minute because the film felt the need for a third-act villain. The unintended consequence was that it compressed everything else that the film did, and characters like Kate and Jodie copped the worst of it."", 'It didn‚Äôt really pass the bechdel test in spirit even though it might have literally. Honestly this movie did feel like a load of compromises made because of a meddling studio - ‚Äúthere has to be a love interest for Sonny‚Äù included', 'I liked how the women of Sky F1 realised the movie was a little bit shit about women in the sport, so Bernie went round interviewing different female employees at Aston Martin and Red Bull during the Austrian GP weekend. I thought that was a nice bit.', 'Yeah having Jodie being schooled by Sonny immediately on how to do her job and the pit girl being useless had me rolling my eyes.', 'It could have meant so much for women in motorsport‚Ä¶ yet they created something thats just a setback for women, objectiving them and dumbing them down to be saved by men. \n\nIts just poor writing and gives the impression that no woman was in the room during the writing process\n\nWhat coulve been‚Ä¶ they could‚Äôve done justice to the intelligence, professionalism and capability of the real women working in motorsport.', 'Ok', 'This thread was set up to contain these discussions:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk8rn0/megathread_f1_the_movie_international_release/\n\n> F1 The Movie has been officially released in cinemas ""across the globe"", so we\'re setting up this thread for reactions, thoughts, reviews and any other discussion related to the movie.', ""The F1 academy exists. Anyone trying to argue that we aren't in the most progressive time for female racers is just wrong. I agree that the F1 movie could have done without the 5 minutes of sexual tension and the 30 second kissing scene, but do people really care that much? We have a female race engineer in F1 right now. I know that character wasn't the race engineer but still, the point remains.\n\nIt's. A. Hollywood. Movie.\n\nEdit: I guess there is also criticism about how the female wheel gunner was portrayed. Whatever to that too. In the end she kicked ass and I maintain the characters gender is moot anyway.""]",0,45,0.44,0,42,42,0,45,0.44,0
