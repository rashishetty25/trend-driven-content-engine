1gjhquu,2024 Brazilian Grand Prix - Day After Debrief,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjhquu/2024_brazilian_grand_prix_day_after_debrief/,2024-11-04, Day after Debrief,"Welcome to the Day after Debrief discussion thread!

Now that the dust has settled in Brazil, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post-race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyze the results.

Low-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Wanted to share because he is much appreciated in the Dutch motorsport community and deserves the recognition.\n\n\\---\n\n‘Ill Formula 1 photographer is back in the paddock: ‘This could be my last race’  \nBy Erik van Haren\n\nSão Paulo - It is a difficult task for anyone at a Formula 1 circuit: find someone who has anything bad to say about photographer Peter van Egmond. We’ll give it away: you won’t succeed. The 68-year-old from Veenendaal is terminally ill, but in Brazil he is back in his beloved world for the first time in almost a year.\n\n*Photo by Vladimir Rys: Terminally ill Formula 1 photographer Peter van Egmond is at the circuit of Interlagos, back in his beloved world, after a long absence.*\n\nOver 550 races, that takes a toll on a photographer. Up and down staircases, walking for kilometres along the circuits. Van Egmond has had surgery on both knees. He used to work for McLaren but has long since been employed by Red Bull, not having missed a race for twelve seasons. Until he got the bad news last winter: an eight centimetre tumour on his left kidney. Surgery followed, but the bad news kept on coming. The cancer had spread. Immunotherapy and heavy prednisone medications followed. Despite that, Van Egmond travelled to Brazil on Wednesday to show his face in the paddock and, for just a little bit, get back to his work for Red Bull.\n\n**Emotional**  \n“It might sound soft, but on the way to Schiphol \\[airport\\] I got pretty emotional. I missed this, being part of this world. If I were a normal photographer, I might feel less strongly about my absence. But I feel appreciated and part of the team”, says Van Egmond, one of the most beloved photographers in the paddock.\n\n“It feels like I have two families, at home and here”\n\nThe appreciation he feels comes from Red Bull. Financial, but on a different level too. “During the summer break, I got sent a shirt with autographs from everyone on the race team. And at Zandvoort I quickly visited and got surprised with a watch by Max. It feels like I have two families, at home and here. I have always loved going to races, but also to return homeward on Sunday afternoon. But I have never felt reluctant to go. Formula 1 has been such a big part of my life. I’m just not done yet. Some people count down the days to their retirement. I think: if I am able to go, why not?”\n\n*Photo by Vladimir Rys: Peter van Egmond alongside Max Verstappen. “Formula 1 is such a big part of my life. I’m just not done yet.”*\n\n**Return**  \nHe had already planned to work less. To not attend all 24 Grand Prix in a year. And now he chose Brazil to make his return, including a long plane ride. “My wife initially didn't really approve of me going, but she understands now. I’ve been at home a lot more all of a sudden. That turned out to not be as hard as I expected. Although my wife did start to work more…”, says van Egmond, smiling. And then he continues, in a serious manner: “I will not be declared clean \\[from the cancer\\]. There are three options: it could become worse, stay stable, or turn out a little bit better. If this goes well, I hope to attend roughly eight races next year. But I have to be honest with myself and see this weekend as a trial run. Maybe I’ll fail miserably. So in the worst case scenario, this could be my last race. If I feel this is not attainable any more, then it is done. But at least I will have tried.”"", ""this is heart wrenching.

Definitely expect them to be strong again."", 'Another 3 week hiatus just kill me now.', ""hope they've welded the manhole covers back down again"", 'Las Vegas could really open up the Constructors in Ferraris favour if this is true', 'Translation \n\n\nIn a tight fight for the Constructors\' Championship, Ferrari in Brazil significantly limited the damage compared to what was seen in the Sprint Race. McLaren adapted better to the Interlagos circuit and had greater potential than Ferrari, with an SF-24 that struggled more in the long corners, as Carlos Sainz explained, but above all in the wet. Having lost a few points, even finishing ahead of the two MCL38s in the race, was important, even though Carlos Sainz\'s accident resulted in a zero. Frederic Vasseur does not budge from his position: ""We don\'t look at the standings. Honestly, I don\'t even know what the points gap is. We have to keep our approach of looking at it race by race, without doing calculations . ""\n\n\n\nVasseur: “Made a mistake with Charles’ pit stop. These are difficult weekends even for those who are at the pitwall”\n\n\nAfter Qatar, Interlagos was the track where Ferrari expected to have the most problems against McLaren, and so it was. The Prancing Horse men did not hit the right window for the SF-24 both in the dry and especially in the wet, where Frederic Vasseur spoke several times of a difficulty in managing the tyre pressures , which then penalised the drivers a lot, both in Qualifying and in the race. “These weekends are difficult to manage both on the track, for the drivers, and from the pit wall. It is a matter of making choices that then anticipate the conditions that you will find in Qualifying and the race. It was a difficult Sunday, but all in all not dramatic for us ,” declared the Ferrari Team Principal. A lot happened during the race, between changes in conditions, rain showers and yellow flags (and one red) and this also caused strong variations in performance: “We were 6-7 tenths slower than Norris at the beginning of the stint, but then we were quicker at the end” .\n\n\nThe accident and subsequent departure from the pitlane by Carlos Sainz left Ferrari with only one car in the top of the standings, in a situation that was not easy to manage. In particular, Charles Leclerc paid for a pit stop that, in hindsight, turned out to be too hasty. “It\'s easy to talk about it afterwards. It would certainly have been right to stay out waiting for the red flag, but if you crash in the meantime, you still become the stupid one,” said the French manager. After the race, Charles Leclerc immediately took some responsibility for the non-ideal car setup, but Vasseur intervened, also talking about the strategy adopted on the Monegasque : “ He is not responsible for the setup . He is always the first to take the blame, but that is not the case here. For the pit stop, we underestimated the threat of Bearman and Hamilton , who overtook us, because we lost precious tenths when exiting the pitlane which is very slippery . But this aspect would not have changed our race much . ”\n\n\nVasseur: “Ferrari will come back strong in Las Vegas and we will have to take advantage of the opportunity”\n\n\nThe wet weekend certainly affected the performance of the SF-24, which has never managed to be as competitive as Red Bull and McLaren (or even Alpine), even though it finished ahead of Norris and Piastri, but it is impossible to know how it would have gone on dry surfaces. “I think we would have been closer, but it is difficult to say, there are so many variables such as setup and tyre management. We would still be talking about differences of 1-2 tenths,” said the Team Principal of the Prancing Horse. It is time to turn the page and wait for Las Vegas, the next GP on the calendar, which will open another, the last, hat-trick, after a 2-week break in which the teams will work and prepare for the end of the season as best as possible, even if, as Vasseru says, “We are already focused on next year\'s project. New parts? Yes, spare parts after this weekend ,” he said, letting out a laugh.\n\n\nExpectations for the American GP are important, especially since the SF-24 is in good form, excels in slow corners and has improved efficiency with the latest developments. “Last year we were very strong and I expect we can do well again this year.” In Maranello they were aware that Interlagos would put them in greater difficulty against McLaren and all in all they managed to minimize the damage over the weekend. “But I don’t want to lose as few points as possible, I want to fight to get more.

If we see how Mclaren had many offs too, this suggests they perhaps were pushing their boundaries too, when Alpine was perhaps just not pushing their boundaries for the sake of longevity and as such, benefit. \n\nGiven that Albon had a massively great qualification potential until the crash - and quite franly, Franco was getting well up to speed to, it might just have been Williams instead of Alpine on the podium.\n\nThat's one painful lesson, but perhaps because of the pain, a lesson that motivates them to actually learn from it."", 'Albon never should have gone out again']",3670,340,0.99,3670,15731,15731,3,0,0.0,3

1gktu1f,Red Flag Tyre Change Solution,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gktu1f/red_flag_tyre_change_solution/,2024-11-06, Discussion,"In order to remove the unfairness from the fact that you get a completely free tyre change under a red, have it so that they essentially simulate a pit stop if they choose to change tyres. Take the timings from the last active racing lap and remove the average pit time from anyone that decides to change tyres under a red flag. This is then your new grid for a restart.

  
I think it'd be the fairest solution as it also takes into account drivers who had built up large gaps to the car behind. There'd also be some strategy to it as you wouldn't just automatically change tyres.



The only downside i can think is teams trying to play mind games by changing tyres at the last possible second before a restart, but that could be avoided by mandating tyre changes within a certain time frame when the race has stopped.","[""The red flag tyre change rule is fine as is. It is the way it is for safety reasons. You don't want cars driving through debris after a red flag worthy incident and then send them out on dodgy tyres."", 'Teams are allowed to change tyres under a red flag because teams are allowed to work on cars in general under red. It\'s allowed because teams may need to repair damage like changing wings or like after Bottas went bowling in Hungary 2021 Red Bull mechanics did their best to patch up Verstappen\'s floor and sidepod. Are you going to account for that too or only tyres? It takes a lot longer to swap a front wing out in a pit stop. And how do you account for VSC, SC, differing pitlane lengths and who knows what other factors I\'m not even thinking of right now. Should drivers be forced to stop longer when they pit under SC or VSC? Because that\'s an ""unfair"" advantage as well.\n\nOr you just don\'t make up a lot of complicated new rules that are going to introduce new scenarios that are unfair anyway and just accept that sometimes things aren\'t perfectly fair and it\'s just part of racing.', 'I honestly don’t think there’s any unfairness to getting a free tyre change during a red flag. It’s all part of the strategy. Sometimes the red flag helps and sometimes it hurts. I think this rule is fine as it is.', 'Why only for Red Flag ? Pitting under SC/VSC should also give a time penalty to equalize pitstop times then. But then you basically punish a driver who managed his tyres well and could go on longer waiting for SC opportunity.', 'I think the red flag situation is fine as it is. If we want to get rid of people having advantage because of red flags, will we also reinstate gaps after we go racing? If P3 is 20s behind P2, P3 also gets an unfair advantage during red flag because the 20s is reset to 0.  \nIt\'s all part of the game and strategy. The more ""fair"" we will try it to make, the more rules we need to create. The more rules, the more grey areas, the more complicated and the more inconsistent steward decisions.\n\nAlso, changing anything on the car during red flag is also for safety reasons.', 'Ah Verstappen gained from a Red Flag, we must discuss it and change it. \n\nWhen anyone else gains from a Red Flag, it is all part of the game. \n\n\nIt is getting a bit predictable.', ""We had a rule that you couldn't change tyres under a red flag (outside of safety issues).

Both hold a decent amount of other records as well or at least are close (Max' ten win streak vs Seb's nine win streak) etc. Both have had iconic drives, wins against the odds and utter domination.

I just want to clear up a apparent misunderstanding of how the red flag actually benefited Verstappen in today's win. 

It all starts in lap 27 when Hulkenberg got stuck somewhere on turn 1, after the rain got increasingly more intense. Norris already asked a few times to be pit, since the intermediates from the start are getting more worn for most of the grid, which means less grip and a harder time for all of them to keep the car on track. 

# Lap 28/29 

Both of the leaders dive into the pit to try and get a cheap pit stop under the VSC conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/itpieu32bryd1.png?width=2472&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0a709e49f502ae77a817621aa7253fc60bc945

Gap back to Verstappen is about 19 seconds under the VSC conditions. Gap in racing conditions before the VSC was called was about 13 seconds. As seen in the photo, the VSC was ending when both of them came into the pit. 

# Lap 30 

Both of them have pitted, but notably they have both pitted on new intermediates instead of wet weather tires. The gap is now 13 seconds in favor of Verstappen. During all of this the rain intensity is at the peak of the race, and the conditions would call for wet tires, as shown by Tsunoda. He was about 17 seconds back from the lead pair at the point of pitting. He did however pit himself and at lap 30 he was already only 7 seconds back.

About 10 seconds after the above screenshot a safety car is called, since the conditions are about to be undrivable. Tsunoda in a timespan of about 10 seconds made up 4 whole seconds on his wet tires.

# Lap 32 

After a few laps behind the safety car, Colapinto find the wall and the Red Flag is called. The order under the red flag does not change.

# So how did the red flag benefit Verstappen? 

(This is the opinionated part, so please discuss if you think different) 

  
The real benefit of the red flag to Verstappen and a lot of the grid behind is obviously the free pit stop. However, the positions from Norris and Russell are arguably already won when they decided to pit under the VSC for new intermediate tires. 

If the red flag, or safety car had not been called they would have lost time to anyone that pitted for wet tires. Its in my opinion very likely that they would have had to pit again under the conditions we have seen, and with the wet tire runners so much faster. 

If there was only the safety car called, Verstappen would be in front of them anyway. In this case I think a few different things could have happened depending on the rain intensity. Whats most likely is that Verstappen would have tried to stay out as long as possible on his old intermediates, unsure if they can make the whole race, but it would have been interesting to see, especially since it would have taken a long time to clear enough standing water for a rolling restart, so I think the remaining laps under speed would have been about \~30 laps, but probably less, since it was raining a lot. 

In any case, I think the red flag was not the deciding factor for Verstappen today, but Red Bulls and Verstappens choice to stay out and not switch tires. 

Norris and Russell got new intermediates, so that was a gamble from them on a safety car as well, since there was no way to drive on anything other than wets at that point, and they would be dropped behind Ocon, Gasly and Verstappen. Really unsure what that strategy call was. 

Love to hear corrections and your input, good night to everyone going to sleep!

Lawson didn't see him (obviously didn't expect him) and turned in as normal.\n\n\nPart of the issue must be that the braking distances seem to vary a lot between cars. It might have something to do with energy harvesting, but actually I think it is because the drivers are nursing tires during the races. They *can* brake quite a bit later occasionally, but doing so takes a lot of life out of the tires. So on the average lap they lift/brake a lot earlier than someone *can* when attempting an overtake.\n\n\nThat means we see more overtakes than usual that seem like dive bombs based on how far back the attacking car comes from, but that end up being nip and tuck by the time the two cars make the apex. (Think about Piastri's overtake for the lead at Baku, as a similar example.)\n\n\nI wonder if part of the inconsistency with stewarding is that we have a lot of stewards who drove during the refueling era and who were therefore used to driving GPs with every lap closer to the limit rather than driving to a delta that is often 5 seconds off the one-lap qualifying pace on the same compound of tires.""]",244,42,0.99,244,604,604,-1,0,0.0,-1

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‘round racing friends, for the tires are warm and it’s time to hit the track… From driver news to team updates and technical tweaks, the eleventh edition of *Last Week in Formula 1* is ready to take you on a hot lap.

Before we get started, if you missed last week’s issue [you can catch up here.](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-october-21-27-2024)

If you’re a rookie ‘round these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly newsletter compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world.

Every fun fact, story, and piece of news has been sourced from posts in r/formula1 (AKA: Formula 1’s publicly accessible online paddock).

Given this is The Internet, take everything you read with a grain of salt. However, after over three years of following the subreddit, there’s far more truth than lies posted—and much of the news comes from reputable sources.

On a semi-related note, like the cars we enjoy watching so much, *Last Week in Formula 1* is in a constant state of development. Any feedback you have on what’s covered, the format, or anything I missed is welcome in the comments.

And if you, like me, enjoy pretty things…

You can have the pretty-with-pictures version of *Last Week in Formula 1* delivered to your email inbox every Monday [by subscribing on Substack.](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/)

Now let’s get down to business…

\~\~\~

# The Brazilian Grand Prix



**Sprint Qualifying / Sprint Race:**

P1. Oscar Piastri / Lando Norris

P2. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri

P3. Charles Leclerc / Charles Leclerc



**Qualifying / Grand Prix:**

P1. Lando Norris / Max Verstappen

P2. George Russell / Esteban Ocon

P3. Yuki Tsunoda / Pierre Gasly



***LWIF1’s Reaction:***

Thanks to checking my fantasy results before tucking into the race, I had the ‘pleasure’ of waiting for all the moments that would result in my losing nine million in team value—Carlos, Franco, and Williams… Thank you very much.

Personal entanglement with the Brazilian GP’s results aside, *what a day* in São Paulo that was. Watching a chaotic qualy feed directly into an even more chaotic race was a lovely way to close out the Americas triple-header.

While the WDC isn’t clinched yet, I daresay this race was more or less the icing on the cake—I don’t see Lando gaining 21 points on Max in each of the remaining rounds. And after a performance like we saw this weekend, I need no further proof that Max has earned what will surely be his 4th title.

***Personal highlights from Brazil include:***

* Yuki-san locking down a top 10 finish…
* A much-deserved double podium for Alpine…
* And witnessing a wet weather Maxterclass for the ages.

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

***The driving standards and racing rules conversation rolls on…***

*Master Shit-Stirrer* [*Toto Wolff fairly stated that Max’s previous on-the-edge duelling tactics going unpunished has legitimised his racing*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ge8a29/toto_wolff_past_max_verstappen_f1_clashes_going/)*—which we’re now seeing the long-term effects of… And that* [*his penalties \[or lack thereof\] will change how drivers race in F1.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geqmvn/motorsport_wolff_verstappen_penalties_will_change/)

*In case there was any doubt, questionable and inconsistent stewarding is DEFINITELY part of the problem: According to whom in Mexico, Liam defended aggressively against Franco while leaving enough room for him to remain on track.* [*This photo begs to differ…*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ge30is/according_to_the_officials_lawson_defended/)

*According to Mr. George ‘Head of the GDPA’ Russell,* [*“19/20 drivers are aligned on F1 racing guideline changes.”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdyvba/russell_19_out_of_20_drivers_aligned_on_f1_racing/) *Pray tell! Who could the outlier possibly be?!*

**As for the latest in this never-ending silly season…**

I won’t post links because there’s nothing concrete, but the rumour mill has been busy churning out “Perez is out after Brazil” think-pieces once again, largely based on Christian Horner’s inability to confirm that Checo will finish the season in his post-Mexico interview. Do with this info what you will.

*(Semi-relatedly,* [*Darth Helmut Mark blames Liam Lawson for his “unnecessary collision” with Perez, and Sith Lord Christian Horner is piling the pressure on Checo*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gesbgh/marko_blames_lawson_for_unnecessary_collision_as/) *to do… Something, please, anything!)*

Meanwhile, [Perez is defiant that he’s safe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ggslmb/perez_brazil_gp_interview_about_his_future_you/)

Continuing the Red Bull driver conversation, [paddock rumblings indicate that Red Bull would *love* to swoop in and sign Franco Colapinto for 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gfg301/red_bull_could_reportedly_pay_up_to_20_million_to/) (which would make for an even crazier story for the Argentine). However, Red Bull isn’t onboard with taking him on ‘loan’, allegedly wanting him all or nothing—which could result in them shelling out $20 million to Williams.

In the same vein, more ‘Franco to RBR’ smoke appeared during the Brazilian Grand Prix weekend. Here’s Exhibits [A](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ghbtfk/argentinian_journalist_that_broke_the_news_of/), [B](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ghc78j/bybit_argentina_under_the_post_of_the_rumorer/), [C](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ghcsez/ummmm/), [D](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gh9qd1/lukesmithf1_on_franco_colapinto_james_vowles_says/) and [E](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gh7vrj/christian_horner_was_seen_leaving_the_williams/). Just imagine the scenes if these smoke signals are coming from a bonfire of truth… What cinema!

Meanwhile, [Mulletman Valtteri Bottas is still considering Sauberaudi alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gge5ly/f1_ive_got_to_look_at_all_the_alternatives_bottas/) (namely a Mercedes reserve role) should the chips not fall his way.

Which is a move Mr. Bottas might have to make, as [the rumblings of F2 hotshot Gabriel Bortoleto claiming Sauberaudi’s remaining seat are reaching a fever pitch.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gibgdw/according_to_motorsport_brazil_sauber_signs/) A *lot* of smoke appeared during the Brazilian GP weekend—and in F1 where there’s smoke, there’s usually fire.

Adding fuel to this particular fire, [McLaren Team Principle Andrea Stella stated that McLaren won’t stop Bortoleto from driving in F1 for another team and that conversations are ongoing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ghan3p/phillip_horton_andrea_stella_says_mclaren_would/) Relatedly and meaningfully, [Bortoleto has apparently resigned from McLaren](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gh00mj/grandepremiocombr_bortoleto_resigns_from_mclaren/) (which *would* partially explain why he wasn’t given any of McLaren’s rookie FP1 slots in Austin or Mexico).

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

Ahoy there! [There’s another Ferrari flag gracing the entrance in Maranello.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdwo8u/yet_another_flag_has_been_added_in_maranello/)

In an interview that’ll warm you deep into the marrow of your bones, Haas’s rookie team principle [Ayao Komatsu said that securing P6 in his first season as the bossman would mean everything…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gfl3xn/f1_we_never_expected_it_komatsu_says_securing_p6/) And fair enough! Haas has been through the wringer in recent years, and I think they’ve been incredibly resilient in the face of a mountain of ‘crazy ex’ level problems.

[Sauberaudi has announced that former Ferrari strategist tragedist Iñaki Rueda will join the team as Sporting Director next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gfj9lb/jon_noble_sauber_has_announced_that_former/) Their current SD, Beat Zehnder will shift roles to Director of Signature Programs and Operations. *I will be blunt:* I cannot fathom the decision to hire someone so deeply involved with the absolute clown show that was Ferrari strategy before Freddie V came in and began cleaning house. Have fun with that one, Sauberaudi.

Hats off, Andrea!

[Mercedes have found themselves in a spot of bother thanks to their spate of recent crashes](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gerrmp/f1_wolff_admits_mercedes_w15_is_on_a_knifes_edge/)—the bills for which are taking swathes out of their budget.

There seems to be multiple people and sources saying there was ""long time"" between crash and Verstappen dropping out of top 10. Rewatched to confirm. First picture is moment yellow flags are thrown out (graphic isn't even fully shown yet), second one (1 second later) shows Leclerc making into top 10. Only thing Max lost here was p11 to p12 and he already has +5 grid penalty. Biggest loser here was Bottas who was robbed since Albon and Lawson got their times done (Albon when time left 1:09, Lawson when time left 1:03).

Tldr: no, there was less than 1 second for stewards to react for red flag which is basically impossible. Red Bulls dropped because they left themself last.

I'm also on the side that it took them too long to react (50 seconds).","['It doesn’t matter that Max didn’t get through, that is bad luck they all experience.

I have to admit, watching it live I had the complete opposite reaction to a lot of other redditors - they seemed to delay the red flag to try to give Max a chance to finish his lap, before realising it was too dangerous.

This accusation is, after the end of the 2021 season, potentially justified. However, the discussion has been doing an incredible disservice to the fact that the past few seasons have been an ongoing showcase of a potentially dangerous slowness to deploy Safety Cars, Virtual Safety Cars, or red flags. To educate myself and (hopefully) the rest of the subreddit, I went back and reviewed very SC/VSC intervention so far this season and made note of how long it took the race director to make the decision and neutralize the race. 

  
TL;DR up front, because this is going to be long; the average time this season between an incident occurring and a VSC or SC being deployed is a whopping \*48 seconds.\* 

  
Quick methodology notes up front: I used the very helpful [list of safety car interventions this season](https://www.lightsoutblog.com/every-safety-car-f1-2024/) by Nick Haldenby at Lights Out Blog, and went back to each race with the F1TV feed, the live timing, and a stopwatch. For cars that stopped alongside or on the track, I started the clock at the point when the car stopped moving (assuming that they wouldn't want to intervene in a race if a driver can quickly get moving again). Twice this season we've had VSC's deployed due to debris on the track, at Miami and Austria -- I've chosen not to include these as they would skew the average time calculation. So, here's the list:

  
Saudi Arabia, Lap 6: Stroll into the barriers, 50 seconds

Australia, lap 17: Hamilton stops on track, 20 seconds (from the moment of stoppage -- he did spend a long time trying to limp the car back)

Australia, lap 58: Russell into the barriers, 12 seconds

Japan, lap 1: Albon and Ricciardo collide, 23 seconds (race red-flagged)

China, lap 22: Bottas stops in the runoff, 1 minute 37 seconds (this was the incident reposted today of him exiting his car while standing at the end of the braking zone, under only yellow flags)

China, lap 27: Tsunoda and Magnussen collide, 15 seconds

Miami (sprint), lap 1: Norris and Stroll collide, 58 seconds

Miami, lap 29: Sargeant and Magnussen collide, 24 seconds

Monaco, lap 2: Perez/Hulk/Magnussen collide, 39 seconds (race red-flagged -- had to open Perez' onboard for this to even figure out when the crash occurred)

Canada, lap 25: Sargeant into the barriers, 40 seconds

Canada, lap 54: Sainz and Albon collide, 27 seconds

Azerbaijan, lap 50: Perez and Sainz collide, 1 minute 35 seconds

Austin, lap 2: Hamilton into the gravel, 53 seconds

Mexico, lap 1: Tsunoda into the barrier, 41 seconds

Brazil (sprint), lap 22: Hulkenberg stops on track, 2 minutes 2 seconds

  
The fastest reaction was a mere 12 seconds in Australia, while the longest came yesterday at 2 minutes and 2 seconds. However, that does still leave our average time at 48 seconds for this season. I did not take notes on every incident's on-track battles, but did notice that they didn't seem to favor one team consistently throughout the season. Without inside information that I doubt we'll ever see, it's impossible to know whether the delays are coming from a communications issue, a lack of confidence, or a desire to leave it as late as possible so the racing can continue (a la the old ""Racing back to the caution"" rule that NASCAR rightly did away with in the 2000's). Regardless, this is very clearly an ongoing issue, going back years, Taking longer than 60 seconds to make the decision for intervention should be a rare occasion, and yet we've had 3 such incidents this season.

  
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do the same analysis for the 2023 season yet, but I would like to. Without a convenient pre-made list of SC and VSC interventions, it's a bit more work, but if people would like me to I'll happily keep working on it (I might do anyway, just for my own curiosity). 

  
In parting, this specifically came out of my frustration at seeing people saying things like, ""any other race and they'd have sent the VSC out right away,"" when I clearly remembered this being a pattern of behavior from the officials. It's good to be aware of the potential for issues like that, but in situations like this where driver safety is being potentially placed at risk, it detracts \*HEAVILY\* from a very real, very concerning pattern. ","['Quality post and effort OP. This also reminds me of how long race control took before deploying a safety car back at Baku 2021 for either Stroll or Verstappen’s retirement when their tires randomly blew up. I remember after the race it was found that multiple drivers ignored the double waved yellows in that section by going significantly faster, yet in the end no one got a penalty for it. This has consistently been an issue like you said.\n\nEdit: [This article goes into further detail about how long it took for the Safety Car to be deployed for their crashes, and mentions how Masi wasn’t satisfied with how some drivers failed to slow sufficiently for double waved yellows](https://www.racefans.net/2021/06/09/eight-safety-questions-raised-by-azerbaijan-grand-prix-crashes-and-f1s-reaction/)', 'I saw that hulkenberg was moving (in neutral presumably) after the start of the double yellows. \n\nWhen did he stop moving? Was it a huge gap between him stopping completely and him getting out of the car?', ""I'm a marshall at Monza and I will try to explain why there's usually a long delay from the incident to the actual decision\n\nFirst of all a marshall has to report the incident to the race director to asses the conditions of the track and the driver, it's not so easy to do from the camera feed but a marshall that is right there at like 10m or less can easily evaluate the situation better.\n\nThen the circuit race director has to translate what is being said (because for us we communicate in Italian but the FIA race director understands English) and the FIA race director has to make a decision\n\nKeep in mind that usually as long as the car it's still limping around and the driver is not out they won't ever give out a VSC or a SC because it's always better to just wave a double yellow and let the driver bring the car to safety\n\nIn cases like Australia I highly doubt that there was even some sort of communication between the track marshall and the race director, they gave the VSC too quickly so I suppose the fia race director decided without hearing the marshalls (and rightfully so, I'm not blaming the decision it was the right thing to do)\n\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of communication between the track marshalls and the race director then again between the two of them. Then the decision is given out which in turn takes another few seconds\n\nIt's never as easy as on TV you might think it is, and also trust me a race director does not want to use a SC or a VSC (while on the FCY they are more favorable because it's a lot better)\n\n\nAlso it's worth noting that if an accident happens like at turn 1 but all the cars are already past that point they will tend to wait for the sc/vsc, because marshalls might be able to remove the car in like 20/30 seconds without having the need to deploy a safety measure. In case the sc/vsc is deployed they will let them race up until almost the end of the lap so they get a bit more action before having the race neutralized"", 'The worst thing is if I’m remembering correctly even there fastest of 12 seconds was to slow considering the scenario, Russel was upside down in a high speed section with debris up in the air blocking vision of Russel, so within that 12 seconds  a car almost drove directly into the underfloor of russels car, a red flag should of immediately been thrown out in this situation, it’s just not good enough and unfortunately seems like it is going to take another fatal accident before they tighten up these calls.', 'Agree this is a quality post! What I don’t get is why the VSC cannot be deployed right away, even for just a few seconds, when something is clearly happening at the track. Almost as a swift replacement for double-waved yellows in most situation. Then full SC can be deployed within 30-60 seconds if deemed crucial. That was the whole point of introducing the VSC: not to have all the issues and instances OP rightfully brought up!', ""I watch a lot of feeder series as well, and the thing I note in both places is that sometimes flags or safety cars or other things aren't called until they imminently need to be called for safety. What I mean is that if the accident happens at turn one, and in two seconds all the cars are past turn one before anything could possibly be called... well, the cars won't be back around to turn one for more than a minute, sometimes much more depending on the track. So, often I think officials let it go for a bit so that we can get some more active racing while they aren't actually near a hazard. In several feeder series, they are much more likely than F1 to not call a safety car of any kind if some yellows or double yellows around one area are sufficient, and then they are active racing around the rest of the lap."", 'Do you also know the average time without the 2 minutes and 2 seconds from yesterday? I would expect that the average would be way down then and even shows more what of an outlier yesterday was.', 'Just a note - WEC/GT3 series (SRO based) have a mandated decision time of 45 seconds to call a VSC/SC or leave it under local yellows.', ""You have to consider, that safety car deployment will take longer / is delayed on purpose, if all cars are are close to each other with no back trackers and the fiele has already patheted the yellow sector.\n\nFor example first lap accidents or accidents after safety car restarts.\n\nThere is no risk in waiting to deploy the SC until sector 3, if the crash happens in sector 1 and that's what is done every time.\n\nFor red flag incidents it is different and they tend to call it faster to avoid a mess regarding restarting positions and to allow cars to cool down before returning to box.""]",363,103,0.94,363,889,889,2,0,0.0,2

1gjgh9o,Regarding complaints about the full wet tires.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjgh9o/regarding_complaints_about_the_full_wet_tires/,2024-11-04, Discussion,"So it seems like this comes up whenever we have a particularly wet weekend, where everyone from drivers to fans complain that the wet tires are useless and why don't Pirelli just make a good full-wet tire? But I feel like, wouldn't they have done so if it was possible by now? I think it comes down to spray. By the time the conditions are wet enough that the intermediate doesn't work anymore, there is too much spray for the drivers to see. That's why the FIA have done some experimenting with wheel covers today reduce spray enough for the drivers to see, because until that problem is solved, it's kind of a moot point. Thoughts? 

Edit: to be clear, it's not like I think this is some new revelation. I just wanted to make sure I'm not missing something.","['Problem is that wet tires are made for conditions that are red flagged anyways. Drivers want a tire that is in between intermediates and full wets.', ""This gen in general is unable to race in really harsh conditions. The ground effect is the main reason. it creates awful amounts of spray by sucking up water and chucking it out behind it. Remember. Those cars can suck up heavy manhole covers with ease. Then on top of that they run incredibly low which can cause the entire floor plank to aquaplan at high speeds. Both of these factors would make the wildest rain tyre useless. The current rain tyre probably is fine enough for displacing a shit ton of rain. 80 litres per second I think. Which is a crazy amount. Drivers really hate it because they offer so much less grip (duh) than the inters. So even if Pirelly would come up with a magic tyre that offers awesome grip, life and water displacement, You'd still have cars floating up and a fuckton of spray. Which both mean that there is absolutely no shot of them racing in harsher conditions.\n\nEdit: simply raising the car would cause them to have even less grip due to absolutely castrating your main downforce source. The floor."", ""The spray and conditions being two much for the cars when the wets are needed is one thing, but the fact of the matter is that they are incredibly slow. Even in utterly horrendous conditions like the middle of the race yesterday, russel and lando were switching onto new inters because the wets are just not good. Their useable window right now is not when they are faster than the inters, it's when the inters may as well be slicks. Which as you mention, is a tiny window.\n\nPirelli themselves know this, they've done and are doing tests with Ferrari to improve this. Overheating seems the primary problem in regards with them being so bad, and its definetly fixable. Michelin and Bridgestone's extreme wets back in their day were way more comparable in speed next to the inters."", ""This much has been obvious for decades.\n\nThere is no revelation in what you have put, wet tyres need to move water, the only place to move water to is up, this makes spray.\n\nI don't think you have really moved the conversation on any with this."", ""Wider tyres + ground effect = too much spray \n\nand the inters are near the limit for these cars, they eprhaos could make a 50-60 ltr tyre iso an 80 ltr, (inters are 35 if im not mistaken) but I doubt it'll be used much anyway. \n\nMaybe 26 when we get new regs and cars it'll be different again 🤷"", 'What happened to [the super-intermediate tyres](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/FoqSgOQqwf) Pirelli suggested a year ago?', 'This is for the ""wet weather tyres are useless"" gang:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dfE3kvt.png', ""tire isn't the entire problem it's also the ride height.

1gi5jfq,"So, what's actually in the rules if there is no qualifying session?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gi5jfq/so_whats_actually_in_the_rules_if_there_is_no/,2024-11-02, Discussion,"We've all heard different things from different commentators, so I went and checked the text of the [Sporting Regulations for 2024](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_1_-_2023-09-26.pdf) and, surprisingly, I couldn't find anything that deals directly with a qualifying session being cancelled.

The closest thing I could find is the rule about drivers that are not classified at the end of a qualifying session (39.4.b):

>Drivers will be considered to be “unclassified” in the following circumstances:

>i) If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race Director.

>ii) If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted

>iii) If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint shootout

Unless this is covered by some other rule that I didn't see (if so, apologies for wasting your time), if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:

>The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows:

>\- Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 **(or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)**

If I understand correctly, then it has to be Free Practice 1 classification order and the commentators that mentioned the possibility of Stewards using a different order are incorrect. I wonder if the rest of Rule 39.4.b is the cause of this misunderstanding:

>The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters such as:

>\- A suitable lap time being set in another practice session  
\- The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the Championship  
\- The gravity of the offence which caused the driver’s disqualification

which is about allowing drivers that did not classify at the end of the qualifying session to start the race and not about their position in the grid if allowed. Usually drivers are allowed to start the race unless there are serious driver / car performance or safety concerns.

Did I miss something?

Final note: the Rule on moving the qualifying session is quite straightforward, basically the Race Director and Stewards can do whatever they want (inside FIA rules) based on Rule 15.3.a:

>The clerk of the course shall work in permanent consultation with the Race Director. The Race Director shall have overriding authority in the following matters and the clerk of the course may give orders in respect of them only with his express agreement:

>a) The control of free practice, qualifying session, sprint shootout, sprint session and the race, adherence to the timetable and, if he deems it necessary, the making of any proposal to the stewards to modify the timetable in accordance with the Code or Sporting Regulations.","['Fuck knows', ""the truth is there is no precedent. race director will make the final call if the qualifying doesn't go through.\n\nalthough i personally feel if the weather is bad enough for there to be no qualifying whatsoever then it is really ambitious to hope for a race to happen as well."", ""Stewards discretion seems to be the most likely option but teams will protest for sure. It's going to be a hot mess.\n\nAlthough it probably won't matter looking at the forecast"", ""Time for Verstappen to pull a Hamilton '21\n\nWe're here for it"", ""Logical answer: sprint quali grid\n\nProbable answer: some FIA moment ruling that hasn't been thought of makes FP1 the race grid session."", ""You did not miss anything i think, there is no rule yet.\n\n>if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:\n\nThat is the question. If quali doesn't happen at all, does that mean that all 20 drivers failed to set a lap time during Q1 in the sense of this regulation? I don't think it has to be seen that way if Q1 never started and the stewards could use a different order.\n\nFor next year the rules in this situation would be WDC order."", '""If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1""\n\nThey didn\'t, the -did- set a time in SQ1.
