I think Oscar is the only driver to cleanly pass Max multiple times now, and he makes it look easy. This last race clearly showed the difference between him and Norris, and well everyone else. 


When Oscar made the move it looked like of course, why doesn't everyone just undercut Max when he tries to go deep and push off the track. Of course this is easier said then done. 


Yet, I am constantly impressed at how clean Oscar is. It stands out as Max's overtakes are quite aggressive and messy as he basically challenges contact. I think Raikkonen would be the last guy that I can remember being that good/clean.

The way he handled getting past Max this race was a perfect example. He's also one of these drivers that I feel uses his racecraft to maximise results especially on Sunday. Both Alonso and Prost are great qualifiers but where they really stood out against their competitors was their racecraft and race vision, as well aa their competotive mentality. 

Piastri has some amazing overtakes just like the ones Fernando pulls off, like his move on Leclerc in Baku, Norris in Monza, Hamilton in Australia and now the move on Max, amongst others (Austria and Spa) He is also very consistent which are the two strengths of Prost and Alonso. Even when they didn't nail the setup that weekend or didn't have the fastest car, they would maximise the result or atleast finish P2 behind their main rival, (e.g Prost vs Senna or Alonso vs Schumacher) Piastri has done this by always qualifying within a tenth of Pole up until this week and always making the best of the situation despite setbacks (recovering in Australia) 

This season he is especially benefiting from this as his rival - Norris, has similar pace (arguably perhaps slightly better at times) but doesn't have the consistency nor the racecraft to benefit. I am looking forward to seeing Piastri develop and he may well become a driver who is similar in approach and hopefully results as either Alonso or Prost, although the bar is still very high as these two drivers are two of the GOATs imo.","['I agree. Piastri is what Prost always have been during his career, a man of raceday. It reminds me a lot how Prost conducted his McLaren and then Williams both against Lauda and Senna. Exploiting opportunities and results. Chilling blood, clinical. While Max reminds me of 1992 and 1993 Senna, racing with his ass and soul against a much better team with his teammate nowhere near in sight. Norris is... Idk, a better Damon Hill maybe right now. He is good, he can be great, but he definitely NEEDS to be better at his own mind. Maybe he needs the 2-3 years Hill needed too.', 'Great points of comparison; from what I have read about him, his work ethic also stands out.

Being 1/10th faster consistently isn’t enough this year for Lando, but making fewer crucial mistakes is plenty for Piastri', '100% agree, Prost and Alonso are the best analogs. One of the most impressive things for me is how he’s handled Max. It actually started last season at Abu Dhabi where he showed Max he’s willing to crash and won’t back down. This season he’s used this and Max’s determination to never be out braked to force a mistake at Australia, Saudi and now Miami. He’s so methodical about how he does things and the results were there for all to see yesterday when he beat his slightly quicker teammate. With the caveat that he only has 2 and a bit seasons in F1 Lando still has a tiny advantage over long stints because of his experience with these tires. Oscar is better to much better at nearly everything else. He makes fewer mistakes, drives far more intelligently and takes what’s on the table nearly every time. Lando can beat him in any given race but Oscar will win the season every time because of this. He’s a killer and I expect him to school Lando when they inevitably go wheel to wheel the same way Max does because Lando has made his self doubt so public for all to see.\xa0', 'No, Piastri is very much like Mika Hakkinen in his 97-98 period, cool and calm, just taking it all in his stride.\n\nLando is David Coulthard.', ""Piastri doesn't have the massive ego Alonso had at the same point in their careers.

[Video - How F1's secret racing rules have changed for 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbTAHyzkrY)[Article - The new F1 racing rules that sealed Verstappen penalty](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/revealed-new-f1-2025-racing-rules-verstappen-jeddah-penalty/)  
The above video and article by THE RACE explains these changes well but I will give a summary below:

Under the new rules, if a driver is overtaking on the *inside* (and they are in control and within track limits), **they no longer have to leave space for the car on the** ***outside*** **at corner exit**. That’s a major shift from 2024, where both drivers were expected to leave each other room if they were side-by-side at the apex.

Because of this rule change, if a driver overtaking on the inside manages to get alongside the wing mirror of the car on the outside, the car on the outside effectively has to give up the corner. The inside driver can now legally run them out of space on exit, so there’s little incentive to stay side-by-side. As a result, we’re unlikely to see drivers hanging it around the outside anymore, which basically kills the chance of multi-corner battles.

https://preview.redd.it/jl0tjjo6d0ze1.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=e093fee9a8b09a072921ff232e44bd2ab3b7e79f

This rule change is why **Piastri's Lap 1 Turn 1 incident** in Jeddah was deemed legal. Under the 2024 rules, this move would likely have resulted in a penalty.

**TLDR: Inside car just divebombs, outside car either backs out or gets run off. Not much of a battle.**

Another key 2025 rule change concerns overtaking around the outside. Under the new guidelines, a driver attempting a move on the outside must now be **ahead at the apex** to be entitled to space on corner exit. Simply being **alongside**, as was sufficient under the 2024 rules, no longer guarantees that right. This makes outside overtakes significantly harder and discourages side-by-side racing, as drivers will be less likely to attempt moves around the outside.

This rule likely explains why Verstappen wasn’t penalized for forcing Norris off in **Miami Lap 1 Turn 2** — Norris was only alongside, not ahead, so Verstappen wasn’t required to leave room.","[""So once the car on the inside is ahead, they have the right to the whole track? That's beyond stupid."", 'Yeah pretty much.\n\nWhat we have today isn\'t good racing by any stretch. The amount of actual good racing we had over the last years is very little. And no, i wouldnt call 1 random overtake during a DRS zone as ""good racing"". \n\nI\'m reffering to actual battles on track, like Norris vs Verstappen in COTA last year, or Charles vs Max in 2022 or their other countless battles they had.\n\nOther sports have much better racing than F1 and it\'s super sad that it got to this point in my opinion.', 'Absolutely yes', ""Yes. Take a look at the Ocon and Hamilton battle. Absolutely unreal battling by both and it was 100% fair. And Ocon didn't actually have to leave Lewis space according to the new rules (albeit that space was largely the run off, but such is the track layout), he didn't because he can actually race wheel to wheel.

1kfddg0,[AMuS] McLaren's secret trick,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfddg0/amus_mclarens_secret_trick/,2025-05-05, News,,"['Translation: \n\n> **The Miami GP was a resounding slap in the face for McLaren\'s rivals. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris beat their closest rivals by more than 37 seconds. The secret, once again, was how the Papaya racers managed tire temperatures.**\n\n> More is not possible. McLaren left Miami with 58 points. A one-two finish in the sprint race, a one-two finish in the main race. Lando Norris was ahead on Saturday, and Oscar Piastri on Sunday. The McLaren drivers had made their task unnecessarily difficult. The two pole positions went to Andrea Kimi Antonelli and Max Verstappen.\n\n> This is proof that the Mercedes and Red Bull cars have the potential to beat McLaren on a single lap. But as soon as McLaren takes the lead in the race, Piastri and Norris disappear over the horizon. It\'s as if they could drive every lap like they did in qualifying. After 57 laps, their lead over third-placed George Russell was 37 seconds and over world champion Verstappen was almost 40 seconds. ""They\'re in a league of their own,"" team principals Toto Wolff and Christian Horner had to admit.\n\n> The match winner was the same on Saturday as on Sunday. The McLarens kept their tire temperatures within the desired range. All the other cars\' tires eventually overheated. In the sprint, the McLaren drivers broke away from the field at the exact moment their intermediates became too hot on the drying track. In the main race, the game was over when Piastri and Norris prevailed against Verstappen. The Red Bull\'s tires were already so close to the red that Verstappen\'s bag of tricks was no longer of any use in defending his position.\n\n> **A completely legal trick.**\nToto Wolff marveled: ""They demonstrate their superiority on every tire type. We have a similarly fast car to them, but only on one lap. McLaren can reproduce that every lap."" His colleague Horner sees differences depending on the track and outside temperature. ""Their advantage is always greatest where the tires are most stressed. That\'s why we looked much worse in Miami than in Jeddah.""\n\n> Conclusion: McLaren must have something beyond high downforce and balanced car balance. Wolff praises the rival: ""They\'re not doing anything illegal. We have no doubt that they\'re operating within the rules, whatever they\'ve found."" It\'s becoming increasingly clear that the McLaren engineers have a clever solution for keeping the tires cool. ""Five degrees makes a huge difference,"" explains Wolff.\n\n> This is precisely what\'s troubling the opponents now. ""We don\'t know,"" asserts the Mercedes team principal. ""But we\'re working hard on it. We\'re not just sitting back and watching, but trying to find the key through experimentation and development work."" According to Wolff, the McLaren secret isn\'t some kind of brainwave, but the product of continuous improvement of the car since the major turnaround at the 2023 Austrian GP.\n\n> **Find the key as quickly as possible.**\nRed Bull is taking a different approach. The dethroned class leader is firing on all cylinders at McLaren in the hopes of eventually hitting the mark. Somehow, people in Milton Keynes don\'t want to believe that everything is above board. But they also have no idea what could be causing McLaren to let its tires caress themselves like that.\n\n> After the Miami GP, team principal Christian Horner initially expressed his conciliation: ""Hats off to McLaren. They taught everyone a lesson today. They\'re doing a better job with tire management than the rest of the field."" On one point, he agrees with colleague Toto Wolff: ""We need to find out as quickly as possible what McLaren is doing. Whatever it is, it could be a match-winner next year as well.""\n\n> Clearly, the trick has nothing to do with the current ground-effect cars. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella, of course, offers no explanation. He only says: ""We have to thank our engineers for creating factors that allow us to keep the tires within their window."" The Italian admits that some aspects can be carried over into the new era of Formula 1, while others need to be adapted to the 2026 cars and their aerodynamics.\n\n> **A clever air circulation.**\nStella also denies that her exceptionally good tire management in the race has nothing to do with the problems that sometimes make it difficult for drivers to set the perfect lap in qualifying. ""We don\'t pay a price per lap for caring for the tires better than others. It\'s no problem for us to get the tires into their working window quickly."" In qualifying, drivers are more likely to complain about a lack of feel for the front axle.\n\n> The opinion is now gaining ground in the scene that the engineers in Woking have found a particularly clever solution for circulating air in the brake ventilation drums, keeping the brakes hot while keeping the tires cool. The external shape of the drums is standardized. Inside, you have complete freedom. You\'re not allowed to install any explicit cooling elements, but you\'re not restricted in the choice of materials.\n\n> An insider speculates: ""Perhaps they circulate the air in such a way that it stays cool in the crucial areas and shield the heat through the use of certain materials."" Chief Technical Officer Rob Marshall is said to be the father of the system. He has been carrying the concept around with him for years, but has only now made it work. That would be bitter for Red Bull. Marshall was at Red Bull for 17 years before moving to McLaren in early 2024.\n\n> Stella also made an interesting statement. ""Even when it gets hot, our car stays cool. We\'ve developed a very efficient cooling system."" This also affects tire temperatures. If the car as a whole gets too hot, it radiates to the tires. Stella\'s statement also explains why the McLaren is near the back in terms of top speed. More cooling reduces efficiency.', 'So basically McLaren could keep dominating into the new regulation unless the others figure out what the magic trick McLaren are doing with the tyres.', '9 other teams HATE this one simple trick.', '>If the car as a whole gets too hot, it radiates to the tires.

Behind the scenes, hard work is being done to get the adventure off to a flying start, and to ensure that things go smoothly, Audi has adjusted the team's structure. In the new setup, Mattia Binotto has been given a new role. The former Ferrari team boss was previously chief technical officer and chief operational officer, but he has left those positions.

Binotto is now responsible for the overall development of Audi's 2026 Formula 1 car. The Italian has been tasked with optimising the coordination between the chassis and the powertrain. According to the German manufacturer, Binotto must do this by tightening up existing processes so that the development of the technology and the various departments within the organisation run more efficiently.Until now, the chassis and engine were overseen by different managers, but now everything falls under Binotto. It is no easy task, because Sauber has locations in Hinwil in Switzerland and Neuberg an der Donau in Germany, while a development centre is currently being built in England. Binotto is therefore tasked with ensuring that all locations work well together.

Newly appointed team principal Jonathan Wheatley is now solely responsible for the running of the racing activities. Wheatley and Binotto must jointly manage the transformation of Sauber into the Audi works team.

The F1 project falls under Audi Formula Racing GmbH and that branch has undergone further changes. CEO Adam Baker is leaving, making that position redundant. Experienced engineer Christian Foyer is the new operational boss and will focus on the development of the hybrid powertrain. Chief technical officer is Stefan Dreyer, who will also take on the role of spokesman.","['He’s a damn good engineer but just isnt the leadership type.

It feels like in the last few years they have been abandoned in favour of +5 time penalties.

We have seen several times drivers not really be affected by a +5. Max has shown them to be worth 'tanking' to get clean air, protect tyres, and pull a gap to neutralise the penalty. He's even gone as far as to laugh them off over the radio. We also saw Haas in Saudi Arabia use the second car to block the following pack to neutralise a penalty.

I just don't think these +5s are enough of a deterrent for the incidents they are usually being applied to.

Thoughts?","[""This was discussed last year - and actually the drivers successfully lobbied last year to have the baseline penalty increased to +10, for the reasons you stated. The KMag/Haas battle worked because they essentially tanked KMag's race for him to hold back the others from Hulk - even though he dropped way down, Hulk was protected, so the team net gained from the penalty, regardless of the length of the penalty.\n\nIt has been odd to see more +5s penalties this year. Max's penalty in Saudi was 5, and not 10, likely because it was the first turn in the first lap, so there's usually leniency anyway. \n\nI agree that drive throughs etc. should be used more, and that if you're going to have a penalty system, it needs to be stringent enough to actually deter the behavior it's intended to deter. But I don't know that we're seeing a new trend toward lighter penalties this year, or an overall issue within the penalty system that there has been movement to correct in the last year or so, but the implementation isn't great."", 'Hamilton got a 10s penalty that race, not a drive through.\n\nAlso, the current regulations require 10s penalties for those incidents, rather than 5s', 'Norris received a drive through penalty in Qatar 24 for failing to lift under yellow', ""I'm pretty sure that Alonso and Hamilton both got drive throughs last year, and Norris got a stop-go which is even worse.\n\nI do think that in situations like Jeddah the penalty should be that they have to give up the position, and if they don't do so in a couple of laps they get a drive through."", 'Yup, we are in a very uncanny valley with respect to penalties at the moment.\n\nThe fix I think is to have permanent stewards so that we get consistent penalties.', 'It\'s a bit difficult topic.\n\nWhen DT and stop/go were the only available options, a lot of time, fans lamented that DT was clearly too harsh for some minor infringements, we have to remember that gaps are much narrower and SC more frequent than when the penalty system was devised.\n\nBut now we have +5s penalties, there\'s the issue of the penalty being an actual benefit if the driver manages to complete a pass he wouldn\'t have without it.\n\nMaybe they should switch to a system of ""drop x positions ASAP"" as the penalty, but even with this one, there would be the obvious issue of it being way too harsh to someone who got their 4th track limit strike while being 40 seconds ahead of next competition.', 'I fully concur - 10s or more, minimum. Absolutely. Also, I\'d love to see substantially more disqualifications for driving standards.\n\nI don\'t at all buy the argument that strategic acceptance of penalties is ""just driving to the rules the way they are."" That\'s BS. They\'re *rules*. If you\'re playing the game, you\'re agreeing to *rules.* You don\'t just break them when it suits you because you can handle the consequences, you follow the rules because it\'s the sporting thing to do.

1kfnfh0,Stefano Domenicali and Liberty Media deserve a lot more criticism for their handling of the calendar,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfnfh0/stefano_domenicali_and_liberty_media_deserve_a/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"I'll preface this by saying that I totally get the need for the sport to expand and for certain races to be included on the calendar. Commercial considerations do have to come into play if F1 is going to be profitable, so I'm not naive enough to think that all of the races that are currently on the calendar for money reasons shouldn't be there.

However, it beggars belief that Domenicali and others at Liberty Media are running roughshod over the calendar in a way that's beginning to threaten the sport's DNA and apart from the odd grumble, there is nobody within the sport questioning any of it, or anybody in the media willing to hold them to account for it.

In the last few years we've seen France and Germany disappear from the calendar. Imola is set to go at the end of this year. Zandvoort is going at the end of 2026 and Spa is set to go onto a rotational deal. Barcelona is out of contract after next season and its future you'd think must be under some threat as well. We're entering a situation where it's entirely feasible that the 2028 season could feature just six core European races, if you don't include Baku, out of a 24-race calendar. 

Even those fans who aren't as bothered with the traditions of the sport must realise that it's going way too far now. It's important for F1 to be a global sport, but it's also important if it is to thrive long-term that it stays true to its roots and builds a calendar around the historic races that for decades have been at the heart of its foundations.

And then that brings me onto the decision to give Miami a contract extension to 2041, and regardless of the popularity or success of the event, to commit to extending a partnership that has run for just four years for another SIXTEEN is an utterly insane business decision. Extensions of that nature should be reserved only for events that have a track record of delivering races over many decades and where absolutely zero doubts exist about the promoter's ability to deliver it. To give that to such a new event, and one that has ranked among the least popular with fans since it was first introduced, carries enormous risk and really should raise serious questions about the leadership of Formula One. 

Not only that, but it's a total lack of respect for where the sport has come from, and yet there is nobody holding Domenicali and co for account for it. If World Tennis was threatening to remove Wimbledon and the French Open as Grand Slams or World Golf doing the same with the Masters or the Open while simultaneously signing 15-year agreements for unproven events they would be getting pelters. Like them or not, Monaco, Silverstone, Spa, Monza, France, Germany and other core European events are what has made Formula One what it is. That we're in a situation where several of those races have disappeared or are in the process of becoming rotational while other, far less valuable races consistently get 10-15 year contract extensions is not just sad, but it's indicative of the reckless leadership that Domenicali is overseeing. It's doubly disappointing when you consider he's from a proper motorsport background and should therefore understand the importance of upholding traditions.

Liberty's policy with the calendar may well work short-term and help bolster revenues, but if in a few years' time the DTS-inspired boom has died off and the Netflix generation of fans have died off, it faces being left in a very precarious position if you have a calendar full of dull, uninspired circuits in countries with little or no motorsport tradition. NASCAR acts as a cautionary tale here. 

Meanwhile, nobody within the sport seems interested in questioning what is happening, and that's a very, very sad thing indeed. 

","['It’s a matter of commercial viability, and has been for a while. Many cut events are cut because event hosts decided it wasn’t worth the money (or loss of).\n\nIf an event host believes they can fill seats, you can guarantee they’ll be at the table as it is always TBC who stays on the calendar.

He's 51 years old, in a game that needs energy and lightning reactions to rapidly changing circumstances. 

He's too old, too slow, too ponderous, not creative or flexible and given his lacklustre career results, he's - at best - a B-player. 

Someone like Lambiase or Bonnington are absolutely flying doors ahead of Adami. It's blindly obvious those guys are on another level completely, enabling their drivers to be successful by creating opportunities, gaming things out well in advance, reacting to circumstances, keeping the driver focussed, providing data, answers, options, and competent race management.

They also almost certainly have the trust of the team management and thus autonomy to make quick, independent decisions, whereas half the delay with Adami is probably checking with management for 2-3 laps before a decision, because they don't trust him.

Ferrari needs a clean sweep on race engineers, new blood with experience, a new system. Bryan Bozzi is also a B player - better than Xavi Marcos for sure but still not good enough. All those memes about the clowns on the prat perch? A big chunk of those seats are filled by the race engineers.

Fred Vasseur is a people-oriented team principal and I love him and of course he is getting a lot of heat (rightfully so), but the true problems of Ferrari lie in technology. Their current technical lead is Loic Serra, who joined from Mercedes, but let’s be honest, Serra was never the lead technical architect at Mercedes as far as I know. He was head of vehicle performance, not aero or chassis concept, and not responsible for top-level technical direction. At Ferrari, he holds a critical role without a proven record of leading any of this.

The result? Ferrari is heading in the wrong direction, their car concept feels like a patchwork. They messed up their progress from last year which gave me way too much hope, but SF-24 was still spearheaded by Enrico Cardile.

Serra is just not up to the job.","['The SF-25 was pretty much done by the time Serra joined the team in October. The car was made with Fred in the interim TD role.', 'No, because he joined in october 1st and by the time he joined the SF-25 had already been designed. His focus is on the 2026 car and some of the upgrades this year.', ""As someone mentioned, Ferrari needs to be broken and rebuilt, like what Vowles did with Williams. What is happening on the track is just a snapshot of how the company runs. Ferrari is relying on it's prestige and national pride, and it won't succeed until the culture and it's philosophy is reimagined."", 'I don’t know how many times it has to be said: Ferrari’s problems stem from Ferrari’s upper management and the culture within the organisation. It is not one individual’s fault, it is the overall way the team is run by people above Vasseur’s pay grade. \n\nMcLaren is the most obvious example. McLaren with Ron Dennis was successful and the way he worked paid dividends until one day it stopped working and it was doing more harm than good. McLaren did not persevere, they didn’t just replace him with someone from within the organisation, because those people were highly likely to do the same thing again. They knew they needed to break the team to the ground, oust those rigid people and rebuild it. It was an incredibly brutal decision to take  and it could have gone very wrong without the right person in charge, but it ended up being the correct one. They got rid of the traditionalists, the Dennis disciples and started from scratch. It took years for them to make it to a stable level as an organisation before they even started to fix their technical knowledge issues. \n\nWilliams is running the same plan. They were stagnant for years  because of tradition. The Williams family wanted to keep the team but it wasn’t the right decision for the team. Clare Williams was not the right choice to run that team and it cost them. They went outside of the family and made a decision to get outside influence into their organisation. Vowles is proving to be the right choice for Williams’ revival and they’ve changed the way they are working. \n\nFerrari meanwhile…promoting engineers and hiring Leclerc and Hamilton’s old team principal from years ago. They hired what fit into their structure as it is. They didn’t go outside of that box, they didn’t take risks and they’ll keep doing it over and over again. Ferrari would never make the kinds of decisions that McLaren made, they’d never be able to take the leap of faith that Williams are taking. Ferrari cannot afford to spend years struggling, hiring and firing and scrabbling like those two. It’s not in their DNA.

1kfi3v2,A bone to pick with this race director and his unwillingness to use red flags,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfi3v2/a_bone_to_pick_with_this_race_director_and_his/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"I know red flags have a bit of a negative stigma, as there seems to be a common opinion that it's better to keep the race moving under yellow flags, a VSC or a safety car than to red flag it and bring everyone back to the pits. 

But...why? 

Red flags have become much more common in recent years, presumably for safety reasons. But I've noticed a reversal from this under new race director Rui Marques, who in Saturday's Miami sprint didn't red flag the race after an accident between Liam Lawson and Fernando Alonso that I'm almost sure would have caused a red flag between 2020 and 2024. 

It quickly became obvious that we'd finish the race behind the safety car, losing four potentially thrilling laps of action. 

But again...why? 

We also lost 4 laps to a safety car in Bahrain, and a ridiculous 20 total laps in Australia. That's nearly half the race!

I totally understand the use of the safety car or VSC if there's some debris on track or it appears the incident in question can be dealt with quickly, but I fail to see who benefits from a safety car period of more than a couple of laps. The fans lose out on a bunch of racing laps, and cheap pit stops often give certain drivers lucky advantages at random.

**Benefits of a red flag over a safety car:**  

* Fewer racing laps lost 
* The option for a far more entertaining standing start (but can still do a rolling start which is identical to safety car restart, if desired)
* Oftentimes more fair (no cheap pit stops, and let's not get started on Abu Dhabi 2021)

**Benefits of a safety car over a red flag:**

* Often less of a delay in the action 

But even that last point is flimsy, as I'm as entertained by what's going on during a red flag period as I am watching the cars crawl around the track behind the safety car. 

**53 races/sprints before Marques took over:** 

Safety cars for 4+ laps: 15  
Red flags: 9 

**12 races under Marques:**

Safety cars for 4+ laps: 7  
Red flags: 0

I don't know if this is the result of an edict or what, but I don't think it's a good trend for the sport.
