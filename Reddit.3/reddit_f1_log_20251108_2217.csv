But since then it's become just as worse as by 2021 and imo this year has been worse. It's disappointing because they made so much of making sure any car updates had to keep 'to the spirit of the regulations' but that just seemed to be left behind.\n\nI haven't read much about the aero side of next year but I hope they think about where it went wrong in this generation and try to fix it."", 'To be fair, this current whole reg cycle has been a trap for Mercedes. Unpredictable form, hard to find competitive cars consistently (22-23), weird drop offs sometimes mid season onwards (2024), etc.\xa0', ""How does he know for sure? Porpoising only shows up on track. Unless the suspension rules are going back to the previous regulations, different floor geometry won't matter so much. The cars can still disturb the under body airflow and disrupt the downforce."", ""I think what pains me immensely inside is how much it has affected the quality of racing. This season has reflected sorely on how bad it has gotten as the seasons come by. Cars running so close to the ground might be limited, given what we are going to see with the new regs next year.\n\nShovlin is right that it shouldn't be bad, provided that little drastic implementations that actively encourage those things will come up, but I do want to see how much it will impact the production of racing and overtaking opportunities"", 'I wouldnt say its as bad or worse than 2021. That ruleset was on a really bad level. Sure, 2025 cars do notably worse than 2022 cars, but i would say they quite reach that level.\n\nAs for next year, improved wake performance and improving the current shortcommings in that area is the primary target for the aero regulations, next to the drag reduction for the PU. We will see how sucessfull they will be with that.', ""I've watched some deep dives on the new aero regulations by aero engineers.\n\nHonestly, looks promising regarding managing dirty air.\n\nDirty Wake should be much narrower due to the barge boards working to pull it under the car rather than wash it out to the side, as they do currently. \n\nSmaller wings, particularly the front wing will also reduce how much dirty air is generated and how much the following car is affected by it.\n\nIt remains to be seen how easy overtakes will be given the following car no longer gets drs advantage (all cars get drs next year)"", 'Such a shame really. 2022 was the best year of these ending regulations, everything else was very poor in regards to what these rules were meant to accomplish.', 'The FIA needs to be proactive in minimizing dirty air by changing the regulations as teams discover tricks. Something that makes the car faster and makes it harder for the following car to overtake is a massive bonus for the teams and something they will want to pursue.', 'One thing that most people forgot was the Spa TD in 2022 and the massive height increase for the floor in 2023. These made floors less effective and as such made running in dirty air much worse. Which is why teams had to focus on normal aero surfaces for downforce as well as sealing the floor', ""It's not worse than 2021, the field is just closer so it seems that way. The gaps in tires and car performance were bigger in 2021, that's all.\n\nBut yes, the teams very quickly started producing a lot more dirty air. Which is unfortunate. So it was kinda successful, in that it did exactly what they wanted. But it was unsuccessful in lasting long.""]",88,29,0.98,88,131,131,3,0,0.0,3

They've been quick in S1 and S3 but they were terrible in S2.

Qatar and Vegas will be a good track for them."", ""They were never the best car except maybe 1-2 races.\n\nJust had a run of good races. Simple as that.\n\nMclarens made a mess of Baku by themselves. Norris was probably faster in Singapore. Its just that it was Singapore. Norris wasn't much slower than Max in Austin if slower at all. In fact without Leclerc's big defensive drive it likely would have been much closer race.\n\nThings just reverted back to the norm."", ""Theres a combination of things. RB improved their car and had a run of tracks that were also better suited to them. The latest upgrade may not have worked as planned, but also tracks like this one and singapore dont work as well. \n\nLets also not forget that Max was on for a P2 in Mexico and the McLaren drivers over the past 6 to 7 races have made mistakes that have skewed the perception of how much progress RB have made.\n\nAlso. No, the car hasn't become absolute shit. Max was 0.3 seconds off pole and was going to take P2 in Mexico. That is not a shit car.
