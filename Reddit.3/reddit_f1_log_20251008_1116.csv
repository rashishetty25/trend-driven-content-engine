I wanted to follow up on some other posts and overall discussions around here lately with this video from the '24 Vegas GP that somehow has flown under the radar. Someone suggested I share this as a full post to follow up on another discussion post yesterday, so figured I do so while we've all got last weekend's direction fully in mind!

This video gives a really cool sense of the logistics and communications that happen during a GP just to keep the camera angles flowing. Most of us can and will agree that the direction choices this season have been particularly bad - and I'm definitely not going to argue with that lol. It's been terrible. 

Seeing this behind the scenes gives some cool perspective, though. You *really* can't just have some joe blow who knows wheel come in and do a good job with it - even to make poor decisions effectively, the director needs a level of experience in doing this specific task. 

And, it also begs a question for me. Considering all of the folks working in this room whose jobs are to execute this director's orderes for hours during the sessions' broadcasts, I wonder if there are any debriefs where those folks are asking ""hey, we missed a bunch of overtakes in the last 10 laps, how do we incorporate them in the the future"" or what's going on behind the scenes and between weekends. Currently, it certainly isn't leading to an on-screen product that a lot of us fans want to see.
