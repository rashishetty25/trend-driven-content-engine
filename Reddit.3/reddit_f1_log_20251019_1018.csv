1o9tszf,Max Verstappen may not become WDC this year but he is going to the factor that decides who the WDC will be,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o9tszf/max_verstappen_may_not_become_wdc_this_year_but/,2025-10-18, Discussion,"Verstappen winning the championship is a long shot, but he definitely be the factor that decides whether Oscar / Lando will be WDC this year.  

Given the fact that Red Bull seem to have fixed the problem enough to keep Max close to the McLarens, this is the absolute nightmare scenario to the Papaya Rules Team.  

1. Max already knows that getting WDC is a long shot, so he can go elbows out trying to get the win and be super aggressive in starts while neither Oscar or Lando can afford a DNF.  

2. Because Max is now in the mix, the idea that a McLaren driver can get 7 points swing in a race is no longer possible. It can be as small as 3 points if Max wins to as big as 10 points if Max manages to finish 2nd.  

3. Lando could have closed the gap to Oscar in a significant way in the past 3 races of not for Max. Right now, Max has protected Oscar's lead a bit. On the other hand, with Max in the mix, if Oscar / Lando manages to win with Max in 2nd, they can can a 10 point swing.  

3. Assuming the Red Bull car is now good enough to hang in undercut range in 3rd, if McLarens are in 1-2, who does the team first? If they give priority to the lead driver, the driver in 2nd gets undercut. If they give priority to the 2nd driver to save them from undercut, then 2nd driver gets the better strategy and may even win.  

4. In case of SC / VSC and double stack isn't possible, McLaren pitwall is gonna have trouble deciding which driver to give the pitstop to. McLaren don't do well under pressure where they have to choose between the drivers. This can lead to a lot of surprise turn of events.  

5. Also, the mental pressure that Max brings is going to affect the McLaren drivers. In quali, in race, they don't just have to worry about their own race and strategy, they will also have to worry about Max's.  

I am not definitely saying Max won't win the WDC. He clawed 40 points since summer break to the championship leader and if there is one driver on the grid I trust to achieve this kind of recovery, it's Red Bull + GP + Max combo. However, there isn't enough races left to perform miracles like winning every race without a clear car advantage and/or without any kind of double DNFs from McLarens.   

However, Max can do what he did to make us all say ""Thank god for Max Verstappen"" during Mercedes era: be a menace on track, fight for wins and podiums, do another HAM-VER-BOT rendition, and be a headache to the team that's on top.

Max being on pace makes him a podium contender all the time, and thatâ€™s most likely in the form of victories.\n\nPiastri has been kinda off the pace since Azerbaijan, so not having the swing of 25 x 18 points assured, makes the buffer he created much much more comfortable.', 'Biggest deciding factor will be Mercedes power units blowing up when we look back.

Youâ€™d think that with Ferrari being such a huge and prestigious name, heâ€™d at least be fighting for podiums, but it even looks like his teammate is outpacing him most weekends. Is it just the car? Has he fallen off a bit? Or is there something else going on behind the scenes?
