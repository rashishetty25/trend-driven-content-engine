Not a word about the fact that team principal Frédéric Vasseur and his engineers were being scrutinized, as was rumored in two Italian media outlets before the Canadian GP. Ferrari wants to answer all the doubters on the racetrack. Therefore, the aerodynamic upgrade planned for Silverstone was brought forward by one race to the Austrian GP (June 29).\n\n> The new underbody is intended to help open up the narrow window within which the Ferrari operates. This problem has been troubling Ferrari engineers since the beginning of the season. An initial underbody upgrade in Bahrain brought only minimal improvement. The Ferrari SF-25 remains a car that is difficult to drive at the limit, especially in qualifying.\n\n> According to Charles Leclerc, the third underbody version gives cause for cautious optimism: ""It\'s a significant step. Will it be enough for McLaren? I don\'t think so, because the gap is too big. Several small steps will be necessary.""

This is the mechanical part of the rescue operation.

Better starting positions would make things easier for Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton on Sunday. ""It\'s easier for us to manage the tires than to drive at the limit with little fuel. We lose too much time there because we rarely manage to get the tires into their window quickly enough,"" explained Leclerc.\n\n> **Criticism of 2026 cars.**\nWhile the eight-time GP winner is hoping that the second half of the season will be better than the first, he has nothing good to say about the 2026 car. Leclerc has already driven it on the simulator. ""To be honest, it wasn\'t much fun. But we\'re still in the early stages of development.""\n\n> The loss of driving pleasure is more due to the long recuperation phases than to the reduced downforce of the 2026 cars.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

1ll4gkg,Long shot Ferrari question,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ll4gkg/long_shot_ferrari_question/,2025-06-26, Discussion,"Hi Reddit,

Currently sat in a hot taxi feeling super gutted. We were supposed to go to Maranello tomorrow on the literal trip of a lifetime from NZ which has cost us $8000 to arrange.  Our flight has been canceled so now we can't go and my friend is GUTTED.

We happen to be going to Silverstone on Fri Sat next week. Does anyone know of there's any way I can get pit lane access or anything for her? I want to do something nice to make up for this.

Thank you","[""I don't know if I fully understand your question but yeah there are VIP packages that you can purchase."", 'Why not talk to airline and get a different flight arranged? Should be other flights to close by cities or connecting flights? Not sure how a paddock pass to a completely different race help you? You still need to reach there, right? So, ask airline to fix their problem and get you on a different flight. They might even throw some small upgrades your way to make up for it.', 'Dear Ferrari, my friend and his child with terminal cancer (both of them at the same time) and I planned a trip to Maranello and we spent $16,000 (2x what this guy said) and the flight got cancelled. I was wondering if you could give me pit lane access.\n\nThanks!', 'Not trying to downplay this. But I believe all the teams would receive thousands of sad stories like these everyday. \n\nWhat makes your story any different from the other thousands of them?', 'You can pay a lot of ££££ for the hospitality but pit lane ?? You need to be a member of the club for that and buy within a minute of them going on sale….
