This meant that he tumbled down the live timing tower, making it seem like he had issues. He didn't, the car was still going perfectly fine, so all the broadcasters removed the timing tower from the broadcast to avoid making people think he had retired.\n\nFortunately, F1 has a backup optical timing system on the start-finish straight to make sure that they can get correct race results even if a transponder fails. After a bit of work from the various broadcasters' technical teams, they were able to replace the timing tower using the results from this end-of-lap timing. Of course, that only updates once per lap, so it would have been pretty heavily delayed at certain points.\n\nNow for DRS: as you probably know, DRS can only be activated if you're within 1 second of the car ahead. George Russell didn't know if he was within 1 second of the car ahead, because he doesn't have timing. But also the car *behind him* doesn't know if they're within 1 second, because the car ahead doesn't have timing. So both RUS and whoever was behind him didn't have automatic DRS, and had to override it in order to be able to use it. This is why RUS was able to accidentally activate his DRS.\n\nNone of this was an issue with the broadcasts themselves, and honestly the broadcast teams did really well to compensate for it given that the data they ordinarily use for timings simply was not accurate."", 'Everything is broken.

No wonder the TV directors couldn‚Äôt keep up. \n\nRegardless of any debates on drivers, direction, and championships, what a race!', ""On a more positive note considering it would be nice for levity, let me redirect my attention to Haas\n\nIn the aftermath of Ocon's unfortunate crash around that turn and Bearman qualifying dead last, it seems like it is a race to be left in the pits. The sheer grit and consistency pulled off, alongside with the strategy that got their drivers climbing up the pack to take away double points for the weekend is so rejuvenating to watch! I am so, so thrilled to see Haas in this form, and I'm so glad to see Komatsu and the crew leading the charge. I really am rooting for these guys, through and through!"", 'Ferrari strategy was brilliant yesterday, they got screwed over by the SC. Should have ended Leclerc P2/P3 and Lewis P4/5.', 'Piastri has a fantastic opportunity now at WDC. Lando needs therapy. \n\nMercedes are solid but won‚Äôt win anything much this year. \n\nFerrari much improved and unlucky with the SC\n\nOcon and Bearman are shaking that Haas (I see you baby)\n\nLawson might be driving for Uber in 2026.\n\nSauber plodding along just waiting to be an Audi.\n\nThe gulf peninsula continues to be an utterly daft place to hold elite sport events of any kind.', ""I know it just been 4 races but i feel like Max's starts have been less optimal this season, he lost positions in both China and Bahrain which i feel like has been the first time he is losing positions on the opening lap for a while"", 'The soft outperforming the hard over a 40% race distance stint is so crazy and makes so little sense. Fuck these tires.', ""Yesterday was a great example of why it's important for the Hard tyre to always be the slowest, or at least not be be the obvious 'best' race tyre. We need more of that."", ""Well that was certainly a whole lot more eventful than Japan. \n\nI want to start off with Russells transponder not working. Holy shit does one transponder not working cause a lot of issues. First of all obviously the timing pages/broadcasts. It probably didn't help the TV direction either, with them not being able to spot the distances between cars reliably. But Norris and Leclerc having to guess whether they are within DRS distance of Russell was downright hilarious. I'm kind of hoping that they install some sort of backup for the transponder in the future because this was a mess. \n\nPiastri had a great weekend. I just had a look at the race pace for the weekend and depending on who's data you're looking at he had around 4 tenths on the nearest non McLaren. If not for the safety car that gap would've been a lot more than the 15s we had at the end. \n\nMeanwhile Norris had a messy weekend. I don't think I can use a better word to describe it. His qualifying wasn't it. He had a great start, negated it by starting out of his pit box and getting a 5s penalty. Overtook Hamilton off track and had to give it back. Had difficulties getting past both Leclerc and Russell, although that is also partly due to those two defending very well. Just not his weekend. Let's see if he can turn it around in Jeddah this week. \n\nRed Bull really screwed up everything they possibly could. I'm actually amazed that they didn't have some mechanical DNF of a random tyre falling off or something like that to complete the mess. Three bad pitstops. Not a great strategy with the hards, although they probably didn't have enough data on the tyre to predict how bad it was. Props to both Max and Yuki for finishing in the points. At one point I really thought Max' points finishing streak would be broken this weekend. \n\nFerarri did seem to be on point with their strategy, but the safety car kind of messed it up. Overall not too bad? Hopefully they can improve the car some more and actually challenge the McLarens. \n\nAlpine and Haas both had great weekends. Special shout out to Bearman because his p20 to p10 drive would've deserved driver of the day for me. Good strategy call with Ocon, undercutting a lot of people. \n\nDidn't really see anything from Hadjar this weekend. Lawson was messy. Sainz was in the wars and ended up with a penalty. Doohan did quite well, and seemingly his seat will be safe for a bit longer."", ""McLaren - class of the field this race, especially Oscar. Hopefully just one of the stronger tracks for them. It missed a battle out at the front, but that's more down to Lando underperforming in qualifying and then having mistakes here and there in the race which meant he couldn't go on the attack.\xa0\n\n\nMercedes - strong car this weekend, with yet another brilliant drive from Russell. Too bad they decided to have a strategic blunder on Kimi's side. Loved to see all his overtakes though, even if he did get stuck in a DRS train in the final stretch of the race.\xa0\n\n\nFerrari - had a good strategy. Did something opposite their rivals and could have paid off had the SC not ruined it a bit. I think given the circumstances both cars maximised their result.\n\n\nRBR - they usually have one or two off races during the season where pretty much everything goes wrong (pitstops, strategy, no pace). Let's see if this was that outlier or a preview of more to come. Nice to see that despite all that Yuki managed to finish in the points too.\xa0\n\n\nAlpine - their strongest race to date. Well executed for Gasly. Didn't quite managed to hold on to P6, but P7 is also a very strong result. I'm not sure what happened to Doohan tbh. I guess the tyres fell off, but didn't pay too close attention to his race.\n\n\nHAAS - team of the day if you ask me. They managed to turn around a pretty poor quali into a double points finish. Also helps to have two quality drivers (they've come far since 2021).\xa0\n\n\nSauber - rather anonymous. I wouldn't be able to tell where they finished without looking at the results.\xa0\n\n\nAston Martin - also pretty anonymous. A better race for Alonso than the previous three, but that's all there's to say on my part.\n\n\nWilliams - quite disappointing, tbh. I don't know if the pressure to perform is getting to Sainz, but as someone else said in a comment, it felt like KMag was back on track. Albon didn't quite manage to impress either,\xa0 but at least he made up a few positions after being robbed of a Q2 appearance.\n\n\nRB - also quite disappointing. Just didn‚Äôt seem to have the pace. I'm not sure if all the penalties Lawson received were fair compared to some other incident going unpunished, but even without these, it didn't look like he was having a good weekend.\n\n\nOverall, the race was very enjoyable with lots of action up and down the field. It only lacked a fight for the win.\xa0""]",13,72,0.81,13,72,72,4,13,0.050000000000000044,4

13 Hadjar 1:36:35:748
16 Lawson 1:36:43:870.

Is Lawson's time before or after the application of 15s penalties?

Pretty sure it has to be before, otherwise he would have ranked higher than Hadjar?","['After.', ""I believe that's after the penalty as Lawson shows 13 seconds behind Hadjar.

Then the time is added into their time after the race. \n\nSo that 15 seconds is given to Lawson and he will lose places if anyone is 14.99 seconds or closer behind him once they finish the race. \n\nThis is for every racing series. Amateur or professional.', 'Why do you find it unthinkable that Lawson finished in front of Hadjar before the penalty was applied?', 'Ask ChatGPT', 'T', ""Time penalties are served in one of three ways. \n\nIf a driver pits after receiving a time penalty, it is served during that pit stop. When the car enters the pit box, the pit crew have to wait for the penalty time to elapse before they can touch the car. So McLaren's crew just sat frozen for five seconds until the FIA official with the stopwatch said it was okay. Then they do the pit stop and the penalty is done.\n\nIf the driver has already completed their last pit stop before they get a penalty, then the time gets added onto their final time at the end of the race. So in this case, Lawson had ten (fifteen? not sure) seconds added to his final time once the race was over. \n\nFinally, if the driver gets a penalty then retires before the penalty is served, then that time penalty will translate to a grid drop penalty for the following race. Sainz retired from today's race still carrying a 10 second penalty, so that will probably translate to a 3 place grid penalty for Saudi Arabia.""]",0,15,0.41,0,68,68,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
