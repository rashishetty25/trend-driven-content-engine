From most to least important:\n\n- Turbocharger. Putting a turbocharger in the exhaust is great for power and efficiency, but has a significant effect on the noise output. Removing the turbo would significantly drop the power, so you'd need to compensate by increasing the engine displacement (the old V10's were 3.0 litres, and the V8's were 2.4 litres compared to the current 1.6 litre V6).\n\n- Fuel Flow Restrictions. The current PUs have restricted fuel flow that effectively limits their maximus revs to around 12-13k RPM. The V10s back in the day did not have this and revved all the way up to 19k RPM in qualifying.\n\n- Engine configuration. Because of the way the noise is created and the harmonics involved, a V6 does not scream in the same way as a V10 (which has a pretty distinct sound). You could make a larger, higher revving V6 that makes a better noise that's as loud as a V10, but you can't exactly recreate the sound of a V10 with a V6.\n\nFundamentally, if you want an engine that sounds like the older engines, you need a larger displacement, naturally aspirated design that revs higher than the current PUs. The more you move from that towards what we have now, the less noise you get."", ""> How hard will it be to make current F1 engines scream like the V10s?  \n  \nThere are certain acoustic harmonics that are not possible with 6 cylinders, compared to 10 cylinders - added to the fact that current engines are designed for fuel flow limitations (~12.5k rpm), even if the tules allow up to 15k rpm - but it's still notably lower than the v10 being allowed to go up to 20k rpm and were mostly running at 18k rpm."", 'Basically remove the fuel flow limit and the rev limit rules and anything can scream, including the current engines.
