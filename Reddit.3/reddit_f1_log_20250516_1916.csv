Hope you like it","[""I like your work, but I wanted to explain ideal laps for people who do not know. What an ideal lap time is is sticking all of their best sectors together across all their laps in a session.\n\nHowever, it very often isn't physically possible to do all these sectors at the same time. A large reason that's easy to understand is ERS (energy reserve system) deployment. They get a boost in speed when they want. In one lap in a session, they might have used the ERS on sector one and had their fastest sector one then. On another lap, they might have deployed more of it in sector two, on another lap in sector 3. The sectors through a total lap are also affected by tire management through the lap, or how a corner is taken. Practice is for trying out a lot of different things. Someone might take the last corner of a sector in a way that's fast for the first sector but slower for the next sector on one lap, and on another lap, they might try it the other way, which gets a better second sector time."", 'Keep in mind for a quali run you’re probably overcooking your tires if you push too hard throughout all sectors. So if the sector times came in three different runs it’s not as valuable although it does show the car can put in a shift throughout the lap.', 'I really like this analysis. Please do it again :)', 'Very interesting! Might be a dumb question, but how is the Ideal Lap calculated?', 'The top five are ridiculously close, with less than a tenth between them.', 'So, I assume less disparity between ideal and best lap is better?', 'Looking at ideal laps is always an interesting thought exercise and I like this graphic. \n\nHowever, I don’t usually put a lot of stock in ideal laps. Pushing hard for a purple Sector can easily result in overcooked tires by the time you get to Sector 3. This weekend in particular, teams are having trouble (as of FP1) figuring out how to get the most of the new C6 over the full duration of a lap, so we’re seeing a lot drivers set purples in one sector with yellows in the next sector. This is exemplified by how Russell and Norris were the only two drivers in the top 10 whose ideal laps and real best laps were the same lap.', 'Soooo Max on pole, again?', 'Thank you for the explanation']",78,20,0.92,78,18,18,-1,0,0.0,-1
