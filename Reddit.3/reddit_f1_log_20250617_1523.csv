1lcwcb2,Fernando Alonso's future?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lcwcb2/fernando_alonsos_future/,2025-06-16, Discussion,"
Alonso's future will be AM until at least 2026. He already said that he signed a multi-year contract in 2024 and according to Pedro de la Rosa, AM ambassador who usually comments on various things on Dazn, he will be probably also in 2027. 

I know that the English press makes up things and assumes many things quickly with Alonso, especially because many leaks, information and facts do not reach them and only appear in the Spanish press. Above all because, as I said, important people like Pedro de la Rosa keep information to themselves and give clues in the Spanish press. It has happened before, but lately it has been very noticeable. 

Now, speaking of Alonso's not-so-distant future... There are rumors that Russell will replace Alonso next year or in 2 years. That Alonso will go to Alpine because he was seen in the Alpine offices and other things. Pedro de la Rosa denied this, he was only there because Briatore and his parents were there, it was just a walk, that hoax has been denied. Cowell and AM backed Alonso and it is confirmed once again that Alonso is not going to Alpine and will remain at AM for a few more years.  Besides, it's obvious that he won't be returning to alpine, he had enough a few years ago. 

Now, there are rumors that Honda would like a Japanese driver to be in AM, BUT, it is not known if they would want to take Stroll or Alonso, here there is nothing confirmed 

I've gotten all this information from Pedro de la Rosa's IG, various informants, live broadcasts on DAZN, reliable sources, and reliable newspapers. In any case, you can visit Pedro de la Rosa's IG or search for information that's been coming out lately. I can't post Dazn videos because it's a paid service and I prefer not to break any rules of that style.

What do people think about all this? Please share if you have any information. I'm curious.","[""He's got another 40 years in him at least"", ""AM is his retirement Valhalla. I mean he is already a legend, bagging another WDC at his age now would just elevate that further. He will see out his contract, for a couple of years of Newey AM Honda for chance maybe at WDC and if that doesn't pan out he will retire probably. Get married, make babehs, and enjoy his millions and revisit the grid with his progeny decade+ later. \n\nNo way he is going back to Alpine. It's maybe shot at WDC, retirement, and long term roles and ambassadorship at AM. And maybe shot at the triple crown once a year at Indy for 5 years before babeh time, with all his free time, if he's up to the risks."", 'Good question! Crofty kept talking about Alonso going to the Alpine garage four times in Thursday and Friday in Canada. It sounds more likely he was just seeing friends or family or something but then again it is Alonso we are talking about, and it is Alpine we are talking about. I wouldn’t rule anything out.\xa0\n\nI think the situation with Aston is that Alonso has a contract for 2026. Fernando mightn’t be able to break out of that contract but the team can break him out. After that it appears that Aston want him to become a team ambassador or something. I don’t think Alonso will drive for Aston in 2027 unless he’s in the 2026 title fight which seems unlikely with the Merc engine runours, speaking of which, Alpine have the fancied Merc engine in 2026 which makes them an attractive option.\n\nWe also know that Flávio is Alonso’s manager and they have a long history. While one last get together sounds unthinkable, is it impossible? Stranger things have happened in F1.\xa0\n\nI think the situation all depends on Max Verstappen. If we get the unlikely scenario where he goes to Mercedes or Aston Martin, then I think Alonso has been told or heard that in this scenario he loses his seat. If Max goes to Merc then George goes to Aston to replace Fernando. if Max goes to Aston he replaces Fernando. Basically Lance will defo drive next season amd Alonso knows hes out if Max leaves Red Bull which is very unlikely.\xa0\n\nHowever I’ll reiterate that nothing is impossible in the F1 transfer market and if Max does leave RB Alonso doenst want to be left off the grid, therefore he is making sure he has a plan B, that plan B is Alpine.\xa0\n\nIf Alonso actually has the power to break his contract, maybe for a performance clause, then it will be very interesting to see if Alpine becomes his plan A. I think Flávio would 100% take him over Franco, so if both parties want each other (and Alonso might be tempted by getting 26 and 27 rather than just 26 at Aston) and Alonso can break free, Alpine have a very strong Alonso, Gasly partnership in 2026 and Aston are left with Stroll and would likely go in for Yuki or maybe an F2 driver.\xa0\n\n\xa0All of that said I think that the most likely scenario is we keep the status quo for 2026, but if Alonso can get out of his contract he might try. One final roll of the dice by the man who’s rolled more dice than any other.', 'Didn’t Alonso’s recent contract with AM include him signing up to stay there beyond his stint as a driver? I can’t remember if it detailed in what capacity but I definitely remember the ‘beyond driving’ part being discussed when he re-signed. This is pure speculation on my part obviously but I think he’ll see what Newey & co come up with for the new regs next year and then make a decision about his driving future based on that. I cannot see the Alpine rumour being true, the team is still the same shitshow he left, despite his ties to Flávio. I also still think it’s more likely Max will eventually go to AM than Russell tbh.', 'Guy is going to be 45 soon and at some point he will want to retire, he already has his management side gig and I wouldnt be surprised if he gets a few more drivers under him in the coming years. He isnt going anywhere and to be honest I doubt anyone would want an expensive old driver who is cranky. \n\nHulk and Hamilton will also be gone soon, Sainz is the next oldest but is still good enough to be in F1. I dont see any of them past 2027 to be honest, its time for a new generation.', 'I think you think highly of PDLR.', ""Alonso has a contract with AM until 2026, and he said he will keep racing while he think he is capable of doing it at the highest level. In the last races he showed he is capable of doing that. Alonso and Briatore are good friends, don't look too much into a visit to Alpine. \n\nEverything else are just rumours.\n\nHonda is going to be partner with AM. They will have voice in team decisions, so they may want a new driver in the second seat (Tsunoda, Iwasa, ?). The Strolls could be leaving F1 at the end of the year. Lance's hand injury could be one of the public reasons given for his exit.\n\nLuca De Meo is leaving Renault, so Briatore might have limited time remaining at Alpine. It could change owners for 2026. It seems an unlikely place for Alonso for 2026."", ""Mouthpiece for Manufacturer gives information backing what manufacturere wants to happen...\n\nShocking.\n\nI'd say not one peice of the informaton you presented means much of anything, statements from people connected to AM on Alonso's future are gonna be hardly reliable.\n\nThe only thing we know is he was in and out of the Alpine hospitality which is an odd occurence."", ""Russell will only replace him of he doesn't get re-signed by Merc. While the negotiations have stalled, Toto apparently stated an intention to re-sign him once there's a break in racing (so probably the summer break). \n\nIf Russell's future is still unclear by the end of August, then Alonso's seat might be in danger.""]",10,67,0.56,10,297,297,-1,0,-0.019999999999999907,-1

Why go against Mclarens history of letting team mates race.', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Lando Norris crashed into the rear of his teammate Oscar Piastri in Montreal. What impact will the McLaren collision have on the team structure? And how could Nico Rosberg possibly help Norris?**\n\n> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote the following lines in his poem ""The Sorcerer\'s Apprentice"": ""The spirits I summoned, I will not be rid of now."" After the tenth Grand Prix of the year, this sentence could almost be applied identically to the best Formula 1 team of this season.\n\n> Ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix, drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris spoke to the media on Thursday (June 12). After the first third of the season, it had become clear that Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were likely to battle it out for the world championship title. While the competition exhibited more erratic performance, McLaren shone with consistency.\n\n> The drivers know this, too. Regarding past internal team friction in the fight for the World Championship crown, Norris wisely said, ""Something will happen at some point."" And just three days later, he put his own words into action at the Montreal race.\n\n> Norris attacked Piastri in the hairpin on lap 66. However, his rival braked later before the final chicane and stayed ahead. Norris gained more momentum on the finish straight and tried to position himself to the left of the sister car. However, there was no room because the championship leader was covering the inside lane. Norris slammed into the rear of his teammate and then into the concrete wall. His race was over, and Piastri retained his fourth place.\n\n> **""It was only a matter of time.""**\nAbout an hour after the race, team principal Andrea Stella spoke to the journalists on site. The boss of the two rivals seemed composed: ""It was only a matter of time. It wasn\'t a question of \'if,\' but of \'when.\' Now we have certainty and can say: \'Canada 2025.\' Of course, we don\'t want that at McLaren. We\'ll have to have some discussions now.""\n\n> However, the famous ""papaya rules"" are not being put under review. There won\'t be a complete ban on attacks by team orders: ""Of course, we could control everything from the command post, but we don\'t want that. That would be artificial racing. We want to give both drivers the chance to fight for positions – also among themselves,"" explained Stella.\n\n> Norris himself had already apologized for the incident in the car. He then doubled down in the press conference. ""I simply misjudged it. It was my mistake, I take full responsibility, and I apologize to my entire team and to Oscar for attempting something like that.""\n\n> As Piastri spoke to journalists in the mixed zone, Norris approached him and apologized personally with a handshake to the Australian. Stella emphasized Norris\'s behavior: ""It\'s good that Lando immediately took responsibility. He simply misjudged the situation on the track. I\'m sure he\'ll learn from this and emerge stronger.""\n\n> **Does Norris need mental help?**\nSome experts may disagree. While Piastri has made fewer mistakes this year and is also assessing situations better in most duels, Norris seems to repeatedly slip up under pressure. He already made two errors in qualifying. Piastri started the Montreal GP, which was a poor performance by McLaren standards, from P3, while Norris had to start from seventh.\n\n> The fact that the two ultimately clashed on Sunday was also due to their differing strategies. Piastri used the medium rubber in the first stint, then switched to the hard tires twice. Norris preferred to start the race on the C4 tire. The long first stint and the intermediate sprint on the medium brought him within striking distance of his World Championship rival.\n\n> But Norris\'s good race pace ultimately didn\'t help him. Last year\'s runner-up left Canada 22 points behind Piastri. As he walked through the paddock, the weight of the defeat was evident on his face. He took a deep breath and kept his head down.\n\n> **Rosberg offers Norris help.**\nFormer champion and Sky expert Nico Rosberg has often noticed the Formula 1 driver\'s ups and downs. The former Mercedes driver knows from personal experience the psychological strain of a World Championship battle. He believes Norris needs a mentor of sorts to support him off the track, like Mark Webber does with Piastri.\n\n> ""I\'ve already offered him my help and written to him. But unfortunately, he hasn\'t responded. Maybe it will still happen,"" Rosberg revealed in front of the cameras. Rosberg himself had brought a mental coach onto the team during the 2016 season. The psychological support also helped him win the 2016 World Championship battle against Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton.\n\n> Rosberg subsequently decided to retire. After three years of friction and internal battles, calm returned to Mercedes. McLaren isn\'t quite there yet. Canada was the first incident of this kind. But the ghosts themselves summoned them.', ""I don't understand why people are so quick to call for team orders"", 'They need rules of engagement.\n\nTeam orders won’t work here.

I didn't know they were that far back in the past and that authoritarian..."", 'The guys at AutoRacer also released a video (in Italian) talking about the situation at Ferrari. It’s very interesting and insightful in terms of how everything is developing inside the team. \n\nIn chronological order from the video:\n\n\n- The “crisis” is partly due to underachieving expectations. At the beginning of the season, the target was the championship, and the current situation is merely fighting for podiums.\n\n- What Hamilton was referring to when he said, “there’s a lot happening in the background that I can’t say publicly,” relates to an ongoing deep restructuring of the Gestione Sportiva (GES).\n\n- Vasseur, alongside D’Ambrosio, is trying to fundamentally change Ferrari’s old management structures and has encountered internal backlash to these changes. One example is the frequency of upgrades.\n\n- Hamilton is deeply involved in this restructuring and trusts Vasseur.\n\n- They mention that Leclerc, despite delivering great results on track, isn’t taking on the leadership role in the way Hamilton is. This doesn’t mean he’s unhappy or wants to leave.\n\n- Hamilton isn’t very present in the simulator — which was expected — but this initially caused some surprise within the team.\n\n- They mention that the SF-25, while under Vasseur’s responsibility, was mostly developed by technicians who are no longer part of the team and who followed an older philosophy.\n\n- New technicians and engineers are now working under Serra’s guidance and direction.\n\n- The guys note that internal change at Ferrari is very difficult due to the Italian nature of the organization and its people. As a consequence, when things don’t go well, “bands” tend to form within the team.\n\n- Almost all of Binotto’s loyalists are now gone from the team.\n\n- There is no “upper board” or “higher-ups” interfering in team matters. John Elkann (Ferrari’s Chairman) is the one who will decide whether Vasseur continues or not.\n\n- Antonello Coletta has declined the team principal role twice when Elkann offered it, prior to Vasseur’s arrival.\n\n- Christian Horner is considered a potential replacement if he were to become available. This isn’t likely — unless Red Bull’s management no longer wants him, which cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\n- The team at AutoRacer emphasizes that the recent attacks on Vasseur are not well-founded, and much of the reporting has been vague about what’s really going on inside the team.\n\n- Vasseur has been very harsh to the Italian Press and he needs to learn how to deal with the pressure from the press. \n\n- They believe Vasseur will be renewed, and that this “crisis” is mostly a consequence of the deep changes underway at Ferrari. Ultimately, the decision lies with Elkann.\n\n\nIn summary, Ferrari is undergoing the deepest restructuring it has seen in the last few decades. The lack of results and the return to an uncompetitive and problematic car have exacerbated the difficulties Vasseur has faced in trying to restructure the team. There are a lot of changes happening, and Vasseur needs time to implement them. That said, he also needs to deliver results to Elkann and prove that what he’s doing is the right path forward.\n\n—\n\nHere’s a link to the video that I’m referencing above.

1ldmk8t,The Comeback: Is Ferrari the Boston Red Sox of F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ldmk8t/the_comeback_is_ferrari_the_boston_red_sox_of_f1/,2025-06-17, Discussion,"I just watched [The Comeback](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31186041/) on Netflix and was immediately struck by the parallels between the Boston Red Sox and Ferrari teams, especially when the teams aren’t winning. 

To those unfamiliar, the Boston Red Sox are one of the most storied teams in Major League Baseball history. For a time, and on multiple occasions, the Red Sox have been plagued by near-miss or fumbled title aspirations: the 1986 World Series against the Mets blowing the game with one out remaining, and the 2023 playoffs, where they blew a 3-run lead in game 7 in extra innings against the Yankees. The Red Sox finally broke “the curse” and won a World Series in 2004 to end an 86-year title drought. 

Both teams have passionate fans (Red Sox Nation and Tifosi), a rich history and tradition, are iconic brands in their own right, have enjoyed great successes, but also catastrophic defeats and prolonged droughts between championships. But two things that drove this home were: 

1. The media’s reaction to a losing team 
2. The amount of work and time to rebuild a winning team 

The media has a frenzied and panicked tone when the teams are underperforming - this goes beyond a bog-standard team enduring a losing streak. The knives are incredibly sharp, and fingers point in all directions. From questioning management decisions, challenging accountability and the lack of transparency to the lack of individual performance. The media becomes a singular point of criticism to express fan dissatisfaction. Dan Shaughnessy is probably one of the best examples, once having called the team “frauds” (the 2004 championship team, actually). 

I couldn’t say for sure who the Italian equivalent might be, as I’m not based in Italy and only learned Italian on Duolingo, but perhaps Giorgio Terruzzi or Pino Allievi? Terruzzi always seems particularly critical of Hamilton, recently writing that the [marmot murder was not pivotal in his result](https://www.corriere.it/sport/formula-1/25_giugno_16/f1-ferrari-commento-76b54281-b1a6-4495-a811-f83549b16xlk.shtml#:~:text=Hamilton%20has%20a%20weak%20excuse%20because%20he%20was%20hit%20by%20a%20poor%2C%20dazed%20marmot%20that%20compromised%20the%20aerodynamics%20but%2C%20let%27s%20be%20clear%2C%20we%20are%20once%20again%20talking%20about%20a%20broken%20promise%2C%20a%20breathless%20race%2C%20on%20a%20track%20that%20he%20loves%2C%20after%20an%20encouraging%20qualifying.), which seems disingenuous at best. The one thing that is slightly different is that Boston tends to focus on the [ownership and management](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/john-henry-red-sox-ownership-drawing-criticism-for-teams-lackluster-roster-management/#:~:text=In%20the%20Boston%20Herald%2C%20Jason,the%20Red%20Sox'%20overall%20plan) of teams, whereas, in my limited understanding, Italian media come for the team principal (and drivers, or at least one driver anyway). 

Building, or rather, rebuilding greatness takes time and investment. Given that the main performance assets in MLB are players, who are easily acquired by trade and can play immediately. Credit to the GM Theo Epstein, who recognised what needed to be done. Boston finally broke the curse in 2004 by trading for depth in pitching and all-arounders/defensive players, including getting rid of one of the faces of their franchise.  

Maybe it’s unfair to compare Ferrari to Boston in this way. In F1, beyond drivers, you need technicians and engineers who are not always readily available, and, even then, require periods of gardening leave that restrict their ability to make an immediate impact. The team principal plays a key role, which is perhaps why stability is most important and why you might be inclined to look further up the chain or at the wider structures in place, which need to change.

What happens at Ferrari remains to be seen but what do you think?

Edit: this was solely based on the Red Sox Netflix doc but appreciate other teams, sports and even players may have been better comparisons.
