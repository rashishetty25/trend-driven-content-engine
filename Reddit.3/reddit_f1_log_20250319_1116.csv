Ferrari need to change their approach because all they seem to care about is race position, rather than what track conditions are like. This goes for the drivers too because in such situations, the drivers are the ones battling the conditions and can tell what they can handle or not. 

They need to be more firm just as Russell and Verstappen were about what needed to happen, else they won't ever change cause it's been happening for years. I'm surprised Hamilton wasn't more decisive but I suppose new team new relationship so he was still learning how the atmosphere would be like.

Bono took charge with Kimi and was understandably so. Same with Stoll, his engineer mostly made the calls and he never seemed like the type to care that much. Hulk put his experience hat on.

As for Norris and McLaren, they clearly learned from previous situations because both Lando and Will could tell that the type of rain that fell, will obviously not dry for the remainder of the race.

The communication styles are so different, and you can tell who have an understanding already and who don't. You can also kind of tell who has higher expectations of their pit wall/strategy team. \n\nAlso, just because there's an understanding or personal relationship already doesn't mean that things go perfectly. This wasn't broadcasted but Max was mildly unhappy that the team didn't pit him for inters a lap before they did. I'm sure he would have been more unhappy if he hadn't been in P2 by then already. \n\nI think both Max and Lando have personal relationships with their engineers, but the trust levels about the teams' strategies in the rain may be different. Max didn't ask a lot of questions about the incoming rain. I'm not sure if he even asked any. Lando, on the other hand, asked for every detail, made his preferred strategy clear, and even reiterated it again. (I'm willing to consider that this was perhaps a trauma response though, given how often McLaren has messed up his strategy in the rain. 😅)\n\nRussell's engineer serves as a good contrast to Lewis's. George was told how many positions he would lose beforehand while Lewis had to ask after the fact. In fact, I feel like that was Ferrari's main issue. They keep talking about unimportant things before the important things. Leclerc's engineer rattled off the tires everyone was going on before they even talked about what tire Charles wanted to be on. And it's like he hadn't even intended to ask what Charles wanted."", 'A good race engineer can make a real splash', 'Some very strong reactionism going on here.', 'I thought my brain was playing tricks on me when I heard Bortoleto\'s radio and thought I heard Lando\'s old performance engineer/deputy race engineer, Jose. The article mentions that Jose Manuel Lopez is Bortoleto\'s race engineer though, and I assume that this is the same person (Jose Manuel Lopez Garica).\n\nThis is an interesting partnership because Jose was working with the driver development program right before he left McLaren, so I believe he had already been working directly with Bortoleto, a McLaren junior.\n\nWho is Bortoleto\'s performance engineer? I thought I heard him talk to a ""Xavi.""', ""I think having Bono also helped contribute to Kimi's good race, Bono is a very experienced engineer, and speaks very clearly and directly, which no doubt helps as Kimi is a non native English speaker."", ""I was wondering how much of a factor Gary Gannon was to Lance's good performance, good to see some actual quotes from Lance on that"", ""Gary Gannon is the absolute GOAT race engineer. Tuning in on the onboard radio of Schumacher's backmarker Haas car always felt like being part of a Zen meditation session. If there's any race engineer that can deal with Stroll, it must be him."", 'I don\'t think it\'s as bad as everyone\'s making out. It\'s the first race with a brand new engineer after having the same one for over a decade, as well as more of a language barrier. I have a feeling that the message of ""leave me to it"" might not have translated across properly.\n\nThere\'s only so much you can do in testing. It\'s impossible to recreate the pressure of a race, particularly in the rain.\n\nI\'m sure they\'ll improve things quickly.', 'Oh yeah nobody knew about that before.']",385,38,0.96,385,654,654,15,0,0.0,15

Sauber, Red Bull and Minardi wouldn't have an engine supplier. And also for the other manufactures like Ferrari and Mercedes it would be almost impossible to produce enough engines. They will have switched much of their production to the 2026 engines already"", 'Mmm... I don’t see them moving to V10 so soon, especially when some engine manufacturers (probably all) have been investing so much in the new 2026 engines. I guess they will stay 5 years with the new engines as planned and then switch to V10', ""Let's be clear, abandoning the 2026 PU change at this point would mean effectively jettisoning Honda and Audi (who have little interest in V10's and don't have a 2025 PU to carry on with), and by doing so would jeopardise the PU supply contracts for at least 3 teams (Aston, Sauber, Alpine) and even puts Red Bull and Racing Bulls in a slightly strange position since they're effectively in limbo between RBPT and Honda at the moment. It would also be a colossal waste of resources for the suppliers who are already well into the later stages of R&D.\n\nThat's just completely unrealistic in my view."", 'I’ve enjoyed PU’s not being a talking point in F1 for a few years now because everyone is roughly on a par.', 'Both suggestions are INSANE.\n\nScrapping the 2026 PUs entirely not only royally fucks RBPT and Audi, but it\'s already way too late to force teams to scrap all the work they did on the 2026 chassis.\n\nShortening the 2026 PU cycle to 3 years is entirely unheard of, teams invested billions of dollars, and Cadillac would have to either delay again their engine or develop a V6 for a single year and then move to a V10.\n\nLastly, not a single one of the current manufacturer has expressed any interest in developing V10s, the opposite infact. Honda for example is only in F1 for the high-fuel efficiency engine development.\n\nThis smells of a political battle to take power away from the teams and give it back to the FIA hidden behind the ""#BringBackTheV10"" narrative.', ""DeepL (1/2)  \n  \nIs the V10 coming sooner?\n\nFor several weeks now, Formula 1 has been discussing a complete U-turn on the technical rules that are to apply over the next five years. The aim is to introduce naturally aspirated engines with sustainable fuel before 2031.\n\nThe Formula 1 community has been discussing a contingency plan for the future for weeks. It sounds like a crazy idea, but it is becoming increasingly serious. The current regulations are to be extended by two years in order to switch directly to cheaper V10 engines that run on climate-neutral fuel. This would be a complete reversal of Formula 1's plans to make the sport even more attractive for car manufacturers.\n\nThe starting point was a song of praise for the V10 engine from Formula 1 boss Stefano Domenicali. Running on climate-neutral fuel, it would be a solution for the premier class, Domenicali mused aloud. It is cheaper and simpler than the current drive units and also than the hybrid drive planned from 2026. It allows for smaller and lighter cars.\n\nWhat initially sounded like dreams of the future suddenly gained momentum. The F1 management has other reasons to fear next year's major rule reform. It could jeopardize the balance in the field and thus the excitement. With new cars, new engines, new tires and the great unknown of e-fuels, there is a great danger that someone will interpret the new rules better than everyone else and then put on a show.\n\nA V10 would also be a lifeline if the manufacturers were to leave Formula 1 in droves at some point, as they once did in 2009. Private suppliers could also construct a ten-cylinder naturally aspirated engine.\n\nHelp for Cadillac?\n\n\n\nFIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem has belatedly jumped on the bandwagon. Even at an advanced stage of development, various teams report that the 2026 rules were too ambitious and express safety concerns about energy recuperation. This could lead to large differences in speed in the field, depending on whether one is in charging mode or not. Many are also worried that the show could suffer.\n\n\n\nThis has led to the idea of extending the current rules by two years and then switching directly to naturally aspirated engines in 2028. Some interpret the president's move as a way of preventing a flop. If the teams' concerns prove to be true, it will be the FIA's fault. They wrote the rules. Others accuse Ben Sulayem of wanting to help newcomer Cadillac. He is said to be emotionally close to the General Motors brand.\n\n\n\nThis scenario would be perfect for the Americans. They could drive with the proven Ferrari engines for two years and then launch their own V10. That would be a much easier task than building one of the 2026 horsepower monsters without any prior knowledge."", ""The problem with V10s is that none of the car manufacturers want this. The current manufacturers lobbied heavily for an inline 4 before agreeing on a V6. Honda and Audi joined the sport on the basis of a V6 formula.\n\nYes everyone gets nostalgic for the noise (myself included) but the manufacturers want compact, low cylinder count, engines because it's more road relevant. Gaining V10s will mean losing Honda, Audi, and probably another manufacturer."", ""Introduce V10 but allow a small electrical motor with no limits on recuperation and deployment \n\nAnd that's one way to keep current manufacturers engaged and interested""]",37,65,0.86,37,62,62,21,63,0.04999999999999993,21

Now I'm gong through what I think is their worst. I'd be really interested to hear your opinion and what you agree/disagree with. 


Max Verstappen - 2015 -
Yeah so Max is pretty hard to choose because all of his seasons have been impressive. While his worst spell was at the start of 2018 he was great for most of that year which is why I have gone for his first season 2015. While he had some amaizmg drives he did make some errors like crashing out in Monaco and Silverstone and Sainz often was faster than him.

Liam Lawson - 2024 - So out of just two options 2023 was more impressive. 2024 did also have some good drives (COTA) his qualifying deficit to Yuki and his spin in Qatar hold him back. 

Lando Norris - 2019 - This is very difficult because all of his seasons have been impressive. However I have put 2019 as his worst as Sainz usually outraced him. That said Lando had a lot of bad luck in 2019. 

Oscar Piastri - 2023 - 
So like Lawson there is only two options and Oscar was more impressive in 2024 than 2023. Yes he was great in races like Qatar but he often wrecked his tyres and could not usually compare to Lando in race pace. 

Charles Leclerc - 2023 - This was really hard to pick because Leclerc's seasons are all pretty good. Every year bar 2024 he has either been in a midfield car or had terrible luck. Ultimately I narrowed it down to 2020 and 2023 but despite his many high profile mistakes in 2020 his demolition of Vettel and what he did with that car made it better so I put 2023 here because Carlos was often faster than him. That said it was still a decent year that was just plagued by bad luck. 

Lewis Hamilton (2024) 
For most of his career it has been said that his worst year was 2011, when he had a strange obsession with colliding with Massa and was defeated by Button. However his wins in China and Germany are two of his best. 2024 though was ended with a few of the worst performances of his career (USA, Brazil, Qatar) and he 
was very poor in qualifying. 

George Russell (2023) Not a very difficult choice imo. Every other year he has defeated his team mates but in 2023 Hamilton was easily better than him and finished five places higher in the standings. George also made a lot of costly errors, Canada and Singapore his most spectacular. 

Andrea Kimi Antonelli (N/A) 

Fernando Alonso (2017) 
Yeah all of Alonso's other seasons were too good to pick (I found out too hard to judge 2001 seeing as he was in a Minardi) so I just settled on this one. Vandoorne faired fairly well against him compared to how Alonso often demolishes his team mates. 

Lance Stroll (2024) 
In previous years Stroll had had his big mistakes, but also the odd moment where he becomes prime Senna. 2024 didn't really have many of those moments and his only real highlights were in his strong stretch from Canada to Hungary, peaking with Silverstone. However his embarrassing moments in Saudi Arabia, China and Brazil detract from the good moments and leave 2024 as his worst year. 

Gasly (2022) So Gasly's years are usaually filled with high highs and low lows. 2022 is an exception. Most of this is because the car was slower and I couldn't put 2019 because of his great podium in Brazil and some of the preceding races. 

Doohan (2024) Doenst really count though. Also I'm not counting 2025. 

Ocon (2020) After two impressive years at Force India Ocon's return to F1 with Renault was quite slow and steady. Ricciardo fairly easily beat Esteban who struggled to rediscover some of the raw pace he'd had before. 

Bearman (2024) Both his best and worst year. 

Tsunoda (2022) IMO Yuki was lucky to keep his drive after that season ( he's turned into a very good driver since). In 2021 he made a lot of mistakes but also had some great performances. In 2022 the car didn't really allow for great performance sand Yuki didn't help with some big errors. He crashed into his team mate at Silverstone just after he's crahsed coming out of the pits in Canada. He also had a sizeable crash in Singapore. 

Hadjar - N/A - 

Albon - 2020 - Albon struggled both pace wise and on the mental side in 2020 as Max challenged the Mercs but Alex struggled to beat the midfield. After a strong but unlucky first race he seemed to be on for a bright year. However he quickly began having bad qualifying sessions, colliding with other drivers (KMAG in Silverstone, Kvyat in Germany) and just making big mistakes such as spinning in Imola and Turkey.

Sainz (2022) 
2018 is obvious answer but he made more high profile mistakes in 2022 as he struggled to adapt to new cars. In Australia he had bad qualifying sessions, bad start and spun out by himself on lap 2. He crahsed in Qualifying in Imola, had a big crash in Miami practice, he went off into gravel in Spain race. Later on he also crashed by himself a few corners into Japanese Grand Prix. 
His win in Britain was also quite fortunate as he went off and let Max through before Max got a puncture because of debris and then Leclerc was faster but left out on old tyres under safety car.

Hulkenburg - 2019 - 
After topping the midfield in 2018 Nico Hulkenburg ended up finding himself without a seat on the grid for 2020 because of his poor 2019 season. Whenever Hulkenburg got a decent points scoring result Ricciardo was usaually ahead and when had a big chance to take his first podium at his home race in Germany he spun off. 
He also just lacked pace quite often like in Brazil when he finished outside the points despite most of the top drivers screwing up. 

Gabriel Bortoleto - N/A - 
","['For most drivers their worst seasons on pure performance level will be their rookie seasons (there are a few exceptions).

So there we are! It doesn't look THAT bad now does it? 😅 Maybe something to console you Lewis fans out there, hopefully this is as interesting for you as it is for me. Should be noted tho, Hamilton is the only champion not to beat their teammate 👀👀

Also for those wondering, Kimi in 2014 doesn't really count but kinda does but kinda doesnt, I'm just throwing him in these posts for funzies ","['I mean, fun exercise but you can\'t really draw that many conclusions from it, especially in a race like last weekend\'s. To say ""It doesn\'t look THAT bad now does it"", just kind of makes it look like you went and looked for something that is not that unfavorable, even though it also isn\'t great. You could argue that Hamilton is expected to do better than just a ""+2"" if Bearman scored a ""+4"" on his F1 debut while stepping in a random weekend somewhere in the middle of the season, against that same team mate. \n\nSo, you can look at it whatever way you want, but it\'s just one race, Ferrari isn\'t looking too great and did Ferrari things, and Hamilton simply needs some time to adjust. On top of that, it was a chaotic race with many variables. Who\'s to say Hamilton would not have done significantly better/worse in a regular dry race? I don\'t see any point in drawing too many conclusions from his finishing position, whether that be seen as P10 or as a +2 compared to his team mate.', ""Honestly I think there should be way more questions about Ferrari's performance than Hamilton's. Lewis did perfectly fine relative to Charles, pretty much about what you'd expect for his first race."", "">Hamilton is the only champion not to beat their teammate\n\nIf you go further back, Schumacher didn't beat Irvine in Australia in 1996 because he DNFed. \n\n\nAnd technically, Prost didn't beat Mansell in the 1990 US GP, but that's because they both DNFed. Ouch."", 'Think people really need to stop getting hung up on this. It’s not like people are obsessing over this kind of thing for the other teams. \n\n>Should be noted tho, Hamilton is the only champion not to beat their teammate 👀👀\n\nSchumacher didn’t either but looks like you’ve accidentally missed that one (also Mika Salo/Eddie Irvine missing).', 'Why debutee not debutant?', 'As in many other situations, not just F1, I feel like the expectations people set on ther own always play a key role...', ""Father time is undefeated. \n\nIt's going to get worse not better..."", ""Agreed.

1jesvbs,Would Sainz regret leaving for Ferrari if Norris wins WDC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jesvbs/would_sainz_regret_leaving_for_ferrari_if_norris/,2025-03-19, Discussion,"Sainz  moved from McLaren to Ferrari back in 2021, and at the time it seemed like a no brainer. Ferrari is Ferrari, and he did have some success there. Sadly for him, he got Hamiltoned. 

Now he is at Williams, and McLaren looks stronger than ever. If in 2025 Norris ends up winning WDC, you have to wonder… will Sainz feel even a tiny bit of regret?

Obviously, he and Norris are great friends, and I’m sure he’d be happy for him. But deep down, when you are an elite driver, you want that success for yourself. 

I think it was the right call at that time, but still watching his old teammate achieve what he left behind could sting a little.

What are your thoughts. 




","[""No matter how badly the team is performing, most drivers still willing to die to come to Ferrari. I mean, it's Ferrari."", 'If he moved to any other team, he would. But it was fucking Ferrari.', ""in another timeline:\n\nSainz didn't leave McLaren\n\nPiastri signed with Red Bull"", 'At the time McLaren and Ferrari were basically at the same point in performance which was proven by the end of 2021. Whereas Sainz would have had to wait 3 years to get a 2022 Ferrari at McLaren, he only needed to wait 1 year to be in a race winning car at Ferrari. At the time it was the best decision he could have made. No doubt he felt vindicated seeing how far McLaren fell in 2022 after having had a decently successful 2021 season. Had McLaren continued on that upwards trajectory in 2022, would they have done better than Ferrari? I don’t think so. \n\nYou have to remember the people who are at McLaren now were not given the freedom to do what they’re doing now, plus the team was still lacking in resources and knowledge. It’s entirely possible that Sainz didn’t see the improvement in McLaren, or it wasn’t enough to convince him to give up a seat at Ferrari. Ultimately, if that was part of his decision process, then he was correct because McLaren did backslide, twice. It’s only after a huge restructuring operation that they started to move forwards and that restructure only happened at the end of 2022. The effects of it weren’t felt until mid-2023. \n\nWithout those vital parts at McLaren, Ferrari looked in 2022 and 2023 to be the better option. It’s only midway through 2023 that McLaren starts to show signs of improvement but because it’s done this before in 2021, there was no guarantee they’d be able to maintain it. It’s only because of drastic changes behind the scenes that McLaren ended up with the 2024 and 2025 cars. And I don’t think it would have been a good idea to turn down Ferrari at the time where Sainz had to make a decision whether to leave McLaren or not. \n\nMaybe now looking at it he could feel a bit like ‘slow and steady wins the race’ in terms of how Ferrari shot up in 2022 and slid down thereafter, or he could look at it is as ‘I got a chance to drive for Ferrari and I won races at Ferrari while McLaren were not in contention, and I won *when* McLaren were in contention’. I feel that the latter is probably more closer to the truth.', ""Even now the relations between McLaren and Sainz are still pretty warm, you will see genuine congratulations from the team whenever he does well (and it doesn't inconvenience McLaren). I'm pretty confident that Sainz left for Ferrari on good terms, he wasn't forced out or left the team in the lurch. I don't think he regrets joining Ferrari, but he will be pretty gutted that he was replaced for Hamilton, despite doing pretty much anything you could expect for that team."", 'No, people make choices in that moment, based on those situations, not about possible hypothetical future scenarios.', 'A Williams has out-qualified and finished ahead of both Ferraris every race this season. We are just that good.', ""Doubt he regrets it. It's just circumstance. \n\nYou don't move forwards by constantly thinking about the past."", 'Has it ever happened you bought something at regular price one day, and the next morning was at 50% off?\n\n\nNothing you can do about it!']",0,35,0.21,0,33,33,0,6,0.03,0
