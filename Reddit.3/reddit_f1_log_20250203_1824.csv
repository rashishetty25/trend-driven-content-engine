1igpmmn,Too harsh? Too soft? 10 penalty calls F1's stewards should have changed last season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1igpmmn/too_harsh_too_soft_10_penalty_calls_f1s_stewards/,2025-02-03, News,,"['> ""Verstappen was sentenced to “public work” for his comments in Singapore. Leclerc swore in Mexico and copped a fine, but when Norris did the same in Qatar no one seemed to care. Perhaps a swear jar next to the press conference sofa would be a quick and easy fix?""\n\nHow about we fix it by letting adults be adults. There is a line that should be drawn, like insults of disabilities or threatening someone. But giving fines, public work or bans for saying fuck or shit is ridiculous.', 'Just want consistency', 'This will be unpopular but I wish the stewards were almost universally more strict.  These are supposed to be the best drivers in the world you cannot convince me they do not understand how much more one needs to slow down to complete a corner alongside another car.', ""I do wonder why F1 doesn't just have one or two sets of stewards for the entire season. Right now, it feels the rules are applied differently depending on which track the race is at. I just want consistency at this point."", ""I'm surprised no one here is talking about Charles intentionally hitting Lando in Barcelona and getting nothing for it. Now imagine if Max or Esteban did that 😬"", 'Going through this list reminded me of how Kvyat once was penalized in some way that wasn’t in the rules for whatever he did, so after he served the penalty, they hit him with a proper penalty for the same incident.  \n  \nEver since then no stewards’ decisions can impress me.', 'Biggest BS of the season is still the false start by Norris, which did not get penalized at all, while there was a car being rescued on track.

Alonso's race was ended, Sainz lost 2 positions. Alonso received 3 penalty points. (Race fans believes this to be too harsh) \n\n2. Chinese Grand Prix: Sargeant passed Hülkenberg after the pit lane exit under the safety car. Williams didn't advise him to return the position. 2 penalty points for Sargeant. (Race fans believes this to be too harsh)\n\n3. Miami Grand Prix Sprint: Hamilton dived down the inside of Alonso at T1 of lap 1. Hamilton locked up making contact with Alonso, who went into Stroll (who already made contact with Alonso from the outside). Stroll went into Norris, ending Norris' race. 0 points for Hamilton or Stroll. (Race fans thinks Hamilton should've received a minor penalty) \n\n4. Spanish Grand Prix FP3: Norris held up Leclerc, who then swerved towards Norris in retaliation. Leclerc received a reprimand (Race fans believes Leclerc deserved a grid drop)\n\n5. Austrian Grand Prix Qualifying: Piastri had a lap deleted for track limits at T6. However, the angle wasn't available for all other cars on their laps. In previous years, the FIA hasn't punished drivers under similar circumstances. (Race fans believes this to be too harsh)\n\n6. Austrian Grand Prix: Verstappen's various defensive moves against Norris. Based on the FIA saying that they should've given Verstappen a black and white flag for driving standards, but didn't, Race fans believe there should've been a penalty.\n\n7. Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Pérez and Sainz's contact. Sainz was ahead of Pérez on the straight, and Pérez caused the collision (according to Race fans), due to having full view of Sainz's car. (Race fans believes Pérez should've received a (grid drop) penalty at the following race).\n\n8. Singapore Grand Prix: Verstappen swore in a press conference and was sentenced community work. (Race fans believes this to be too harsh/too inconsistent).\n\n9. Mexican Grand Prix: Verstappen received two 10-second penalties for incidents wish track limits. The first one (T4) was assessed correctly according to Race fans. The second (T8), was not harsh enough (in their opinion), as they think Verstappen also deserved penalty points.\n\n10. Mexican Grand Prix: Colapinto was forced wide by Lawson at T1, but hung it out through T2 and eventually passed. The stewards ruled that Colapinto left the track and gained an advantage, but the footage shows that Colapinto deserved space. (Race fans thinks if anyone deserved a penalty, it should've been Lawson).""]",938,219,0.94,938,203,203,174,30,0.0,174
