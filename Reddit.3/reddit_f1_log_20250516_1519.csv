What an ideal lap time is is sticking all of their best sectors together across all their laps in a session.\n\nHowever, it very often isn't physically possible to do all these sectors at the same time. A large reason that's easy to understand is ERS (energy reserve system) deployment. They get a boost in speed when they want. In one lap in a session, they might have used the ERS on sector one and had their fastest sector one then. On another lap, they might have deployed more of it in sector two, on another lap in sector 3. The sectors through a total lap are also affected by tire management through the lap, or how a corner is taken. Practice is for trying out a lot of different things. Someone might take the last corner of a sector in a way that's fast for the first sector but slower for the next sector on one lap, and on another lap, they might try it the other way, which gets a better second sector time."", 'Keep in mind for a quali run you‚Äôre probably overcooking your tires if you push too hard throughout all sectors.

Why change anything?\n\nIs it that the other cars caught up to his previous car? Is it rule changes every year to make them change things on the car? \n\nIt always confused me when you hear them say ""We don\'t have the pace this year"" but you did last year? Go back to that car then. \n\nHope this makes sense lol', ""It's interesting that it really goes back many years that RBR have never been great on tyre wear, as someone who sat through 2013 unfortunately. I think the two seasons fit together, that if the FIA brought something in tomorrow that either forced multiple pitstops or wildly harder tyres, that'd swing the title towards Verstappen massively. \n\nI at least appreciate Paul Monaghan the other day like 'yeah we're not about to figure that out in a month guys'."", ""Do they still do ice racing?
