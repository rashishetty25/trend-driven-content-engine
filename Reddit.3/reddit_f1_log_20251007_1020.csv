Hey, maybe a replay if you're lucky. \nInstead we spend several minutes watching Norris tailing Verstappen because the TV director is extremely optimistic and thinks anything of note is gonna happen. Lando tried once, maybe twice, and that was it, other than that he was just driving behind like Trulli was in front. I don't know why we have to cover that when there's much more interesting things going on elsewhere.\n\nAnd for god's sake, stop showing people in the garages unless there is something to show.

Norris wasn't overtaking Max unless Max made a mistake. And guess what? If that happened, YOU CAN SHOW A REPLAY! As long as Lando didn't get within 0,5s, he wasn't overtaking Max. It was interesting when they wrestled the backmarkers to lap them.

At this point, watching the team fall from grace to this extent is hair-tearing worthy. \n\nWhen I saw their first half of the season in 2024, I thought the second half will bring in more calamities than before. I was absolutely wrong. This is the season where their hubris is at a glaring form. It is nuts because they have two good drivers in their lineup, and yet, it cannot be converted into something remotely decent. \n\nThey are lucky not to be last in this race, I can tell you that.

On the flip side of that, this is the most ground effect Mercedes type win. They think they'll be fast and have no pace. They think they'll be slow and boom convincingly win the race instead. It's been four years of ground effects and Mercedes still have no clue what makes their car work. I'm not sure whether to laugh or to cry at this point. \n\nRed Bull (or well Max) did better than I would've thought coming into the weekend. On paper many people had Singapore as one of the worst tracks for them this season. P2 was a great result for them. Also shout out to the strategy team for choosing the soft at the start. That seems like the correct choice, considering most of the left side of the grid had difficulties getting away and got overtaken into the first few corners. If they had gone for the medium tyre, I wouldn't be surprised if they'd lost some places at the start. I am now really curious to see what will happen on the next few tracks. Hopefully both Mercedes and Red Bull can challenge for wins more. \n\nMcLaren won the WCC for which congratulations. Lando finally was a bit more aggressive at the start. The initial launch and overtake on Antonelli were great. However I wouldn't call the overtake on Piastri good, it ended up working out, but hitting Max and then Oscar in the same corner was rather clumsy. All three of them are lucky that they got away with that. Hopefully now that the WCC is won, the McLarens will actually take the gloves off for the last bit. I could use some more papaya on papaya aggression to spice up the races. \n\nFerrari is Ferrari and is still stuck in LICO purgatory. Hamilton decided to show us what happens if they don't LICO for a whole race and poof went his brakes. I just can't. Please free Lewis and Charles lmao\n\nSainz with a great drive from pitlane. Can't believe he made it to the points in Singapore. Alonso as well with some good overtakes. Also some entertaining radio chatter which did make me laugh a bit. \n\nI also want to mention all the backmarkers getting out of the way of the leading cars quite nicely. Which we have seen almost going wrong this season on multiple occasions. So I'm really happy about that. Reading the comments yesterday I think I missed a Sky conspiracy about vcarb telling Hadjar that Lando and Max  were both approaching.

1nzhqfw,The dirty air problem - the worst it’s ever been?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nzhqfw/the_dirty_air_problem_the_worst_its_ever_been/,2025-10-06, Discussion,"The 2022 regulatory overhaul that have bread the current generation of F1 cars had a major motivation of addressing the dirty air problem plaguing F1 especially from the generation prior, introducing a weighting towards ground effect instead.
As a multi-generational fan of F1, I’m going to stand on my soap box and say I think that the inability of cars to follow other cars, and it’s impact on overtaking, is the worst In F1 history. The regulatory change was beyond ineffective.

If we cast our minds back to the 2021 season and broadly that era of cars, we saw plenty of
 on-track battles for points and wins.

2025 in particular has turned F1 into a qualifying formula, where we leave a weekend often unsure of who had the fastest car on a Sunday. The kind of lap time delta’s we have needed to see at many tracks to overtake (most recently Baku and Singapore) seem well over 1 second per lap. Aside from the first couple of corners, we are being robbed of results being decided on a Sunday, or the fastest driver on a Sunday winning races. 

One example, which is not like-for-like by remarkably similar: Hungary 2019, Hamilton pits from second to fresh tyres due to lack of ability to pass Max, catches him and passes for the win. 2025 Piastri pits from the lead, 3 laps earlier than Lewis did in 2019, and got stuck in the dirty air.

The spectacle is being lost. I really hope 2026 changes things.","[""You clearly haven't seen the 2020 season xD"", 'Dirty Air is way better than pre 2022.\n2017-2021 the Cars were downforce monsters producing massive Dirty Air.\nToday Problem are the tires.\nSofts lasting like 5 laps. Hards lasting forever.', ""The dirty air is nowhere near as bad as it was in the 2017-2021 regulations, and it's significantly better than it was in the 90's and 2000's. We used to see drivers struggle to get within 2s at tracks like Hungary and Spain - now it's common to see drivers within 1s lap after lap.\n\nIf you look at the live timings throughout a GP, you regularly see drivers within DRS range for multiple laps, sometimes even entire stints. A good example was the Sprint in Spa.\n\nRegarding Hungary 2019 - Max was on old tyres that had degraded heavily. In the 2025 race, Norris' hard tyres had very low deg so the delta to overtake wasn't met.\n\nThe lack of overtaking in 2025 is due to two reasons:\n\n  \n\\- The tyres, especially the hards, usually have close to zero deg in most races. China, Spain, Monza and Spa show that it's not just the street tracks. Therefore, the delta between cars is minimal.\n\n\\- The field is closer than it's ever been, which means the delta is minimal.\n\nIn previous years, for example 2018, we had much more tyre deg and much larger gaps between cars, so we had more overtaking."", 'No the dirty air problem is smaller than pre 2022, but car parity is higher. What we see is cars far closer in performance, sorted by their performance (ie. qualifying and locking adaptations afterwards) and then be surprised that there is little overtaking going on beyond the start.', 'Not even close lol. A bigger part of the problem is actually that the cars are really close in performance now. You cant get that overtake delta anymore', ""Did you forget the field is about as close as it's been? Top 5 in qualifying often separated by 1-2 tenths.\n\nYes, dirty air is quite bad. But I refuse to believe that cars that rely way more on ground effect have more outwash and worse dirty air than the ones before them. How is that even possible? No, the dirty air is less than previous regulation cycle but the cars are also closer in pace.\n\nThat said dirty air has dramatically increased since 2022. That's for damn sure.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why bother with prescriptive rules when the teams will always find a way. Why not instead just have a metric. E.g. your CFD model needs to have no more than X amount of dirty air. i.e. regulate dirty air with a metric rather than by prescribing design. And then have more permissive design as long as it complies with the dirty air metric, all good."", 'Not even close. You were lucky to be following anywhere within 2-3 seconds on the previous generation of cars on this track. They can follow at least half that currently.', 'Did...   did you have ChatGPT write this post for you?', 'I don’t think it’s any worse than it has been before, it just so happens these cars are not as nimble in the corners where big divebombs regularly occurred. It was better in prior ground effect era years like 2022 or 2023 but continually adding downforce produces this outcome. \n\nFIA backed off completely on their policing of dirty air generating components. I would expect a 2022-esque season next year when the cars are still in their infancy.']",0,72,0.39,0,468,468,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
