He did an interview where he basically said Lewis is not even a 7 time champion, Michael should hold that record. Here\'s the exact quote: \n\n>""I still feel sorry for Massa today. He won the final at his home race in Sao Paulo, did everything right. He was cheated out of the title he deserved, while Hamilton had all the luck in the world and won his first championship. Today, I would have handled things differently. That\'s why, for me, Michael Schumacher is still the sole record world champion. Even if the statistics say otherwise.""\n\nHe then went on to describe how he and Mosely knew about Crashgate sooner than previously known. \n\nAnd since this interview was published in 2023, Bernie has said: 1) he didn\'t remember doing the interview, and then 2) okay he did the interview but the reporter is German and misunderstood his English. Not mentioning he\'s given lots of interviews to that reporter in the past.', 'Huge news for f1 podcasts', 'I don’t know enough about lawsuits to know if he has a case, but I fully understand that he’s giving it a shot. Bernie knowing Piquets crash was intentional but not doing anything about it is honestly quite disgraceful and a monetary compensation feels like the least Felipe deserves', "">He isn’t explicitly seeking to overturn the results, but he is seeking over $80 million in damages, among other matters. Additionally, Massa is seeking “a declaration that the FIA acted in breach of its own regulations in failing to promptly investigate the circumstances of the crash in 2008” as well as “a declaration that if the FIA had not acted in breach of its own regulations, it would have cancelled or adjusted the results of the Singapore Grand Prix with the consequence that Massa would have won the drivers’ championship in 2008.”\n\nJust putting this here because there's already people saying he's trying to change the result and that he's suing Hamilton/McLaren."", 'For me the main point of this is that the FIA had proff of wrong doing in time for the Ferrari to contest the race and they chose to hide it, therefore failing in their duty.\n\n\nWe dont know what kind of result should be valid from the Singapure GP and Felipe was robbed of his chance to find it out.\xa0\nGiven what was at stake he might be entlitled for compensation.', ""Massa's case is based purely on Bernie Ecclestone claiming that there's a regulation stipulating that the only course of action would have been to void the race but this claim by Ecclestone is absolutely baseless. He completely made it up and then denied he made this statement when he was asked about it again. The reality is that, if anything, an argument about simply disqualifying the team that cheated is the most appropriate action rather than taking points away from all the teams that didn't cheat.\xa0Piquet crashing had zero direct impact on the title fight between Hamilton and Massa. He literally kept his lead over Hamilton after the crash and only lost his lead over Hamilton because his team made a mistake that all the other teams did not make at the pitstop. You can't punish all the teams that didn't cheat for one team cheating just because you messed up which is essentially what Massa's is asking for here. If instead\xa0Ferrari didn't make that error then Massa would have kept his advantage over Hamilton and he wouldn't care at all about voiding the race.\xa0There were also 3 races left in the championship fight after Singapore so everything was still left to race for\xa0and, if anything, Spa 2008 was the biggest miscarriage of justice that year.\xa0\n\n\nAlso, if we are to use Bernie Ecclestone's own words then we should include everything he has said like the fact that, along with FIA President Max Mosley, they both actively helped Ferrari win so maybe we should consider disqualifying Ferrari from both the 2007 and 2008 championships when he was at the helm. Funny how Massa only selectively chooses to acknowledge what Bernie has said though.\xa0"", ""Even under earlier goals, I don't think under any logic you could declare the entirety of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix invalid even if a decision was taken back in 2008. At the very most, Renault could have been disqualified from the 2008 Singapore Grand prix with Alonso losing his win but to Massa that would have meant that Hamilton would have been classified as 2nd, making Hamilton win the championship by 3 points over Massa which of course would be against Massa's interests. It would also retroactively take away the dramatic moment of Hamilton passing Glock for 5th place as he'd have only needed to finish 7th (the same position finished to lose out on the 2007 championship).\n\nUnder the above logic, I don't think you could reward Massa compensation for this. Plus, fuel hose could have still got stuck anyway in a normal pit stop. Had it not got stuck and Massa finished in the points then sure, he may have become the champion by Brazil, but that's not on Renault or the FIA."", 'So crashgate caused Masa to pit, which made Ferrari botch the pitstop and left his fuel hose attached.  But if that never happened, then everything is fine?  So really, why doesnt he blame Ferrari for the bobbled pitstop causing him to lose out?', 'I would like to point out the complete stupidity of this case\n\nFirst off lets discuss Bernie as an unreliable witness. Its important to note that Bernie’s claim That he found out about crash gate in Brazil and the right thing to do was cancel the Singapore result completely but they covered it up, was first made by Bernie in I believe 2022/2023 to a  Journalist\n\nThe date is important here as it is after the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi result and subsequent FIA report that effectively said Hamilton was robbed of a World championship due to FIA mistakes .\n\nBernie hates Hamilton, he hates his liberal views and his stance to Human rights issues in places like Saudia Arabia. So it’s well within Bernies modus operandi to suddenly come up with a story that  delegitimizes one of Hamilton’s existing championships at a time when the Abu Dhabi controversy is still ringing high. if you read the Bernie interview the quote comes from there is a lot of Hamilton bashing\n\nWhat I am saying is Bernie lied because he did not like the near universal sentiment (that Hamilton was robbed) that Hamilton was receiving for 2021\n\nThat’s why, now there is a court case, Bernie is now backtracking and saying he can’t even remember saying it – because it’s a load of baloney \xa0\n\nSecondly there is the fact that nowhere in any of the regulations or statutes does it say that invalidating an entire race and removing the results & points is the correct response to a deliberate crash like this. Bernie has plucked this from his own A\\*se.\n\nthe correct thing to do was disqualify Alonso – which I would argue they should have done when it came to light – Ironically this would give Hamilton even more points relative to Massa.\n\nIn Jerez 97 Schumacher deliberately crashed into Villeneuve – Schumacher was disqualified – but the race result still stands to this day.\n\nFinally lets note that the Staged crash by Renault did not intentionally or unintentionally benefit Lewis. To anyone outside of Renault the crash was as random and unexpected as a normal crash and affected Massa and Hamilton in the exact same way, in that they HAD to pit when the safety car came in\n\nHowever when they pitted one pit crew executed a flawless pitstop and one Pit crew majorly f\\*\\*ked up with Massa driving off with a fuel hose attached and this is what ruined his race']",1802,543,0.96,1802,7814,7814,33,13,0.0,33

With Interlagos on the calendar this weekend, I’ve been feeling a bit nostalgic. I went back through the history of Formula One season finales since 1990, and it reminded me how much the end of the year used to feel different.

1985 - 1995: Australia (Adelaide) closed the season

1996 - 1999: Japan (Suzuka or Jerez in ’97)

2000 - 2005: Mostly Japan or Malaysia/China

2004 - 2008: Brazil’s Interlagos - the golden run of finales

2009 - 2025: Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina Circuit has taken over ever since


For me, Interlagos just has something no other circuit can replicate. The atmosphere is electric, the weather unpredictable, and the fans make it feel like the whole sport’s heartbeat is right there in São Paulo. Those finales gave us so many iconic moments - Raikkonen’s 2007 title shock, Hamilton’s 2008 “Is that Glock?!” drama, Vettel’s 2012 charge through the field.

Abu Dhabi has its glamour, but Interlagos always delivered chaos, emotion and pure racing theatre. I sometimes wonder if my fondness for it is just nostalgia - because so many emotional memories are tied to it being the last race - or if it’s genuinely the perfect place to end a season. It's just such a great track in any case.  

What do you all think?
Do any of you miss Interlagos as the finale, or has Abu Dhabi earned its place?","['Absolutely: Interlagos is a great track with tremendous atmosphere, Yas Marina is a terrible circuit with no atmosphere.

It was a disastrous day for Williams as both drivers, David Coulthard and Damon Hill, spun out. Hill’s race went from bad to worse when he slid into the gravel while attempting to return to the pits to serve a stop-go penalty for speeding. Just recently, Hill had signed a £5 million contract with Williams for 1996, but rumours were already surfacing that Frank Williams was reconsidering. Reflecting on his season, Hill admitted, “I’ve never felt this bad. I’ve made mistakes this season, I can’t deny that.

I've seen people post sector times and other data, and I've looked at OpenF1 and similar projects, but to the best of my knowledge:

1. There's no information on car setups and internals (like tire temps, body temps—is that even a thing? Does lower temp improve driver performance? At the very least, in Singapore and Qatar the effect of ""bad"" climate is clearly felt)
