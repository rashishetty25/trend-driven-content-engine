We tried to unlock what we felt had not worked and got a bit of performance out of it. It gives us a lot more confidence into tools, methodologies, approaches going into 2026.

We validate our approaches and [that will help] 2026, if we thought it would compromise it, we would not be doing it. We know there is a price to pay. We think it's reasonable and we think it's worth it.”\n\nMakes sense. They clearly understand the car much better now than they did mid-season, which will help if they have correlation issues with the next car. \n\nReminder that we have no idea how the teams will shake out next year, just rumors.
