1mochu4,[Thomas Maher] Confirmation of Sergio Perez making his F1 comeback (at Cadillac) is expected shortly after the summer break.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mochu4/thomas_maher_confirmation_of_sergio_perez_making/,2025-08-12, News,,"['I want the Checo and Bottas line up. Battle of the second drivers of Mercedes ans Red Bull', 'Experienced driver to help get the wheels rolling, a fantastic short term candidate with lots of sponsorship. Makes a lot of sense.', 'Somehow Checo has returned', 'Sergio “i fucking told you it was the car” Perez', ""Perfect signing for Cadillac. If they can get Bottas, they'll have a real solid lineup for a newcomer team."", 'How reliable do we think his info is?', ""Honestly, after seeing what he went through at Red Bull, I'm glad he's getting another shot.\n\nI was definitely one of the detractors last year, but no one has been to able to drive the second RB, and it would be a shame for his career to end that way."", 'Death, Taxes and r/formula1 getting trolled by Checo.', 'In all fairness I fully believe he has a lot more pace then what he showed in the red bull. Look at Lawson and Yuki. They are both also dreadful in that second red bull seat.', 'As a mexican, great news if true. Even if it turns out Checo is actually washed, Cadillac is still gonna sell merch like hotcakes lmao. Win-win']",4172,531,0.97,4172,473,473,203,8,0.0,203

The best skit gets an award apparently. I wish they would show that. They do zombies and things like that.

It's similar to baseball, where if you're there in-person there's a lot of small events and fun going on between innings that you rarely see on TV because it's during commercial breaks. F1 is always commercial free, and with F1TV there's basically unlimited time for extra stuff like this. It's a motor race! It's supposed to be fun!
