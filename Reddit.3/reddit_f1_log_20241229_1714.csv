1hoz0c5,"If Lewis Is in a Championship challenge with and he doesn't manage to win It ,Is It time to ask some questions about Ferrari in general?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hoz0c5/if_lewis_is_in_a_championship_challenge_with_and/,2024-12-29, Discussion,"I know that Ferrari now Is very different to the Ferrari of 10 years ago, But here's my point:
Over the last decade or so, Ferrari have let down multiple drivers with various issues , of course we have to consider some mistakes that were made by the drivers during those years
People forget that Alonso made a few mistakes in 2010,( like crash at monaco in FP3, Jump start in china i think...)but probably social media wasn't big at the time, so they weren't picked up like today
Vettel was another big One, he made some mistakes in 2017, and more so in 2018
Leclerc also made some mistakes in 2022, like France 
But i think it's clear that there Is a bigger problem here
When the car Is there the strategy Isn't there, when the strategy Is there the management isn't there, etc... The ""excuse"" of , the other team has a better driver (used by fans in last 6-7years)i'm afraid has run out, because Ferrari's drivers , along with mistakes , have also brought great things, and sometimes put the car on pole or won when It was difficult to , especially Alonso contending for a title in that 2012 car, which brings me to my next point
Ferrari over the last few years have shoen that they struggle to develop a car for the entire season, they Always have a drop off at some point usually at the end , 2024 was the First year where they were up there for almost the entire season
And usually , if they had a car, there Is some Chaos in the management (2018/2022) like , i know the drivers made mistakes, but that's becsuse they were Always put in a difficult position woth strategies, and with a car that fell off in the second half/third of the Season , while Merc and RBR were usually a lot more composed and manager to stay in the fight until the end
I'm quote young so i haven't seen the Schumacher era, but my uncle Who has been following F1 since the senna days Always says that at Ferrari, there Is Just a lot of Chaos, too many people want to have Power and they end up making a lot of different stuff , but never going one direction
This problem came to light more in 2022 where people could see the incredible Chaos going on at Ferrari, i am more confidente with vasseur , but i feel like i have seen this movie before, trending up, doing good, and then everything goes into chaos and Extreme pressure on the drivers, Who start making mistakes as a result, and on top of that , the car falls of , then again and again....
They have switched team principals so many times
Domenicali , Arrivabene , Binotto , Vasseur, and Mattiacci (i think that's his name from 2014) in that time redbull and Merc have only One , toto and horner, that alone tells you that something Is going on here, they Always change their mind SO many times
So , instead of meming the drivers or the team principals, saying it's entirely their fault and they are choke artists, it's important thing o take a look at the entire context , Lewis Is already close to retirement, so i can already see the ""Lewis Is washed"" stuff","['Can you repeat the question?', 'When you want to use and, use a comma.
