Reminds me of when the Michael lost his first championship with them in 1997 by trying to force Villenueve off track. Everyone in the Italian press was calling for him to be sacked. It was only thanks to Todt and Brawn shielding him that nothing drastic happened."", ""It wasn't necessarily the fact that it was lead by non-Italians, but that there was an agreement between Todt and Montezemolo, that thd hirarchy of Ferrari and McLaren wouldn't meddle with the team, thereby shielding them from the politics being played at both companies. The moment Montezemolo broke that agreement, the team went downhill. You could see the same negative dynamics play out at Alpine or at McLaren during the power struggle between Dennis, Whitmarsh and Ojjeh."", '>The case of Prost, a driver that has multiple championships, being fired because he called the car tractor or whatever will forever form my opinion of the team.\xa0\n\n\nTo add to that, his quote about the car handling like a truck was massively taken out of context after a post-race interview and Ferrari never sought any clarification. He\'s explained why in interviews and more recently in his documentary that aired earlier this month.\xa0\n\n\nAll he meant was how his car, in one particular race (Japan 1991), was almost impossible to drive because he had damage. At turn 1 he made contact with another car and his steering buckled as a result, making the car feel heavy and very hard to turn, hence the truck comparison. Now the whole year the Ferrari already had an issue where the steering would lock in long turns and the car almost couldn\'t turn, so the steering damage in Japan must\'ve amplified the issue and felt like hell. Prost called that race one of the best he\'s ever had despite finishing P4 and 25 seconds off the podium. For the record Brundle finished P5 and got lapped, the other Ferrari\'s engine blew up on the opening lap. At the time he was also in the middle of contract negotiations for the upcoming season and Ferrari felt his comments were even more disrespectful given the situation.\xa0\n\n\nYou\'re right that Ferrari has always had an issue with accepting criticism, especially from their own drivers. Another anecdote mentioned in the Prost documentary, in 1990 (which he called of his favorite seasons in F1 in terms of team atmosphere) he brought up to Ferrari how the engine was not good enough to compete with McLaren\'s engine and the team wouldn\'t accept such criticism. He said ""at Ferrari, the engine is sacred. You don\'t touch the engine, you don\'t talk about the engine. Everything has to be about the rest of the car. Except the chassis was very good that year."" I don\'t think it\'s as extreme nowadays, but it\'s still telling that their team culture, not their technical expertise, potentially cost them some championships along the way']",117,28,0.84,117,237,237,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0

Off-season (December - Feb/March). The crew are working almost exclusively from the factory, and the top teams will be training their pit crews for maybe 1 hour per day. Not all of that is pitstop practice, so some days may see dozens of pit stops while others might involve some strength training at the gym. For the smaller teams it will be more workload dependent, and also dependent on their facilities (not all teams have a Red Bull-style dedicated pit stop practice room). There may be weeks where the crew needs to spend time on other things and only have time to practice for 30 minutes on 1 or 2 days in a week.\n\n\n2. In-season at the Track (Wednesday-Sunday). Similar between the teams. Each team will spend 15-30 mins per day practicing pit stops. Due to travel and the time it takes to set up the paddock, there is usually no practice on a Monday or Tuesday of the race week.\n\n\n3. In-season Off Weeks. Depending on travel schedules, fatigue and rest days, the crew might not spend much time practicing back at the factory between races (the number of days in the factory will be team-dependent). At the top teams the training might be similar to off-season when the crew are back in the factory, since they have more support that lets them take time away from their normal duties. On the other hand, some top teams will offer their crew more rest days between events as a perk, so the practice volume might be very small.

Why did Ferrari sign him for 96?\n\nIt seems most people at the time felt there were better options for the Ferrari drive, but I have not been able to find any in-depth analysis on why Ferrari chose him. Was it simply that he was the best driver willing to sign a contract to be #2 to Schumacher? I feel like I have read/heard somewhere that Ferrari wanted to keep Berger but that he didn‚Äôt want to be Schumi‚Äôs team-mate.\n\nThe likes of Hakkinen, Barrichello, Frentzen and Coulthard all seemed to have better reputations than Irvine but I wonder if Ferrari looked at Eddie and saw a strong personality who wouldn‚Äôt be mentally fazed by Schumacher‚Äôs presence, and would instead just get on with the job as best as he could. \n\n2. How do we rate him overall? \n\nI ask this mainly in the context of his comparison to Barrichello. After a messy ‚Äò94, Irvine was very closely matched with Barrichello in ‚Äò95 and he seemed to mentally destabilise Barrichello a bit, or at least that is the general consensus and one that seems to be corroborated by Eddie Jordan himself.\n\nHowever, Barrichello went on to be a much better #2 to Schumacher than Eddie was. I said in my recent post on 1992-2003 that there seemed to be two versions of Eddie at Ferrari - one was a great competitive spirit that could take points away from Michael‚Äôs rivals and the other was miles off the pace. \n\nHowever, he started off at Ferrari with a car that was not particularly good and reportedly had very little opportunity to test in his first year or so at Maranello. How much do we think that skewed things against him? It seems to me he improved throughout his time at Ferrari and largely fulfilled his potential in ‚Äò99, albeit the main factor in putting him on the verge of a title was the numerous mistakes and mechanical failures for Hakkinen & McLaren that year.', ""Hey guys, I'm not sure, but I think Red Bull and Sergio may have agreed to part ways. If only someone could post a link or a tweet or maybe even a screenshot?"", 'So now that Danny Ric and Checo are gone, who is next up for everyone to complain about and speculate their departure from F1? \n\n(Aside from stroll who is perma complained about)', 'Another thing is - if Checo is gone, does Mexico GP go kaboom?', 'There was a relatively good interview (or bunch of quotes mashed together into one) with Steiner, where he said the sticking point with Perez may be the lost future income. Beyond his salary, he‚Äôd have personal sponsorships which he would lose out on if not driving.\n\nI found it insightful ‚Äî and if close to true, pretty much a ‚Äúwell, that seems like a you problem buddy‚Äù.', 'Would David Coulthard have won the 1996 F1 championship, if he had stayed in the Williams with Hill?', ""I just realised, probably going to be a useless stat, that both Ricciardo and Perez's first season in F1 was in 2011 and 2024 would likely be their final.\n\nRicciardo joined midway of 2011, left midway of 2024; Perez had full seasons for 2011 and 2024.\n\nAnd to me it felt Perez was older than Ricciardo for some reason, but they are one year apart, Ricciardo's older."", 'Where Perez announcement', ""Is the rb seat gonna be colapinto's?"", 'Somewhat amusing that the only two available seats left on the grid are both at Red Bull lol.
