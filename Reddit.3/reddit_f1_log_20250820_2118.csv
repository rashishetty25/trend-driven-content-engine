What I think I’ve learned about him, and just kind of watching how this all has unfolded over the last six months, the issues that Lando has are so much more with internal pressure than external pressure. So when people start talking about, ‘Oh he makes all these mistakes, he can’t take the pressure’ I think it’s when he’s exclusively putting pressure on himself.”  
  
“What’s really been impressive about Lando is he’s had a few races where’s he’s had incredible pressure in the car from somebody else, and he has not faltered. The first stint of the season, in Australia in the wet, He had the lead but Piastri was absolutely hounding him, in some of the most difficult conditions you could have possibly imagined, and he didn’t make a mistake, at least he made the same mistake that Oscar did and it worked out worse for Oscar, but like he withstood the pressure.”  
  
“Then you go all the way to this most recent race, you had Oscar catching him with a massive tire advantage the last 10 laps, he had to be picture perfect and he did not falter, and there’s a bunch of examples in between. So when people talk about Lando’s mental strength, I think there’s some things he can clean up when he’s putting pressure on himself, but what’s really impressive and what arguably harder to get better at as a driver, is dealing with that pressure on the racetrack inside the race car, and he’s doing that really well. So if he can keep putting himself in the position to be in front, I think he’s going to be really hard to beat.”

I think people blow it out of proportion. Being frustrated with yourself and saying some things in the heat of the moment doesn’t mean he’s weak mentally. As long as he’s delivering in the car it’s all that matters. Lando’s problem is not his mental fortitude, it’s his racecraft that he needs to work on, he’s blistering quick when left alone but his attack and defense needs work on.\n\n\n2. People talk obsessively about “mental strength” and how you need to have an iron mind to become champion and particularly Max and Lewis are being held up as almost demigods with unbreakable mental power and they play 4D chess with everyone else on the grid. All of that for Lewis to say “I’m useless” on tv and then for Max to quite literally run into Russel the moment he got a bad strategy. And even a seasoned veteran like Alonso had a breakdown during Imola. And I’m not saying that to talk down Lewis and Max or Alonso, I’m saying that cause people need to calm down.

He is a phenomenal driver and if he wins the championship it will be fully deserved. But his reaction to the Silverstone penalty and his multiple lock ups behind Lando that nearly took them both out shows he has his own moments under pressure. When things don’t go his way he gets frustrated.\n\nLet’s treat all drivers equally, instead of criticising one for traits they all share.', ""It is interesting that Norris tends to falter more when it's pressure he's put on himself. See Spa; he had a huge tyre advantage over Piastri and should have caught him - but made a few mistakes. In Canada it was the same - he should have passed Oscar but had a brain fart instead.\n\nYet his performance in Hungary was impeccable and he soaked up that pressure so well. \n\nHe's incredible reflective. In his post race interview last time he was more honest than most people on here about how much luck played apart and how he made some little errors. That's actually a very powerful thing; knowing that even though it worked well he can do better - even if sometimes it means he's hard on himself."", 'Norris is better when he’s the car being hunted. If he’s ahead then you can bet he will defend like his life depends on it and he’ll show some intelligence that makes Jolyeon Palmer dedicate a whole video to that one moment when Norris was smart. For whatever reason, he’s just a much better driver when he’s defending. It’s been that way since his 2nd year. \n\nI also don’t think the mentality stuff even comes from any logical place. It’s widely accepted that Norris has very high highs and low lows. But somehow the fact that the guy always bounces back from his crippling lows goes unnoticed. Presumably because it goes against the whole mentality thing. If he had poor mentality, he would follow up bad performances with bad performances. He would fall into a hole and never climb back out of it, just spiralling down for 4, 5, 6 races at a time. Instead what happens is that he has a shit weekend, erases it from his mind and goes again, more often than not putting in a great performance. To me that shows a significant amount of resilience. It’s as Oscar Piastri said last year ‘Lando’s bad weekends would be good weekends for most drivers.’ \n\nNorris clearly has a good mental fortitude because he wouldn’t be able to come back from the kinds of lows he experiences if he didn’t. Ignoring that helps perpetuate the agenda against him, because acknowledging it shatters that illusion so I can see why people are reluctant to really take notice of it. But it exists otherwise why is he still in this title race after Bahrain, Saudi and Canada?', ""I would add Monaco to the list of exceptional drives under pressure this year. Yes it's hard (impossible) to pass in Monaco but I'm pretty certain that driving almost a full race with a hungry Leclerc attached to your gearbox knowing that you're not allowed the tiniest mistake is pretty hard to do.""]",650,143,0.86,650,2045,2045,29,1,0.0,29

1mv96jx,Looking back at the criticism regarding Sauber promoting Zhou into F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mv96jx/looking_back_at_the_criticism_regarding_sauber/,2025-08-20, Discussion,"It seems like a long time ago, but I remember back in 2021 when the rumours that Zhou would be promoted to Sauber began. I remember the fury that people possessed in this very sub that he would be getting the drive over other drivers.

To be fair, it wasn't without reason. 2020 saw Nicholas Latifi get promoted to Williams, whilst 2021 saw Mazepin get promoted to Haas. Pay drivers in F1 is nothing new, but here we have two drivers severely underdeliver in their rookie seasons, and the prospect of a third rookie driver there to yet again underdeliver spectacularly wasn't very promising.

What makes it even worse were that other drivers with more convincing resumes weren't being considered for F1 at all. The most obvious example being Oscar Piastri not getting the seat, despite him winning F2 in his rookie year. People were furious that Zhou got the Sauber seat over him. Granted, by Piastri's own admission, he was never in contention for that seat, but you could certainly understand why people were annoyed.

It wasn't just Piastri though. I remember people being disappointed that Theo Pourchaire wasn't given a crack at the whip, with many people touting him at the time of being a star of the future. Nick De Vries was also a name that came up a bunch in the initial Sauber 2022 rumours, and I remember people really hoping that he'd get the seat over Zhou.

The point being, Zhou getting promoted to Sauber wasn't a very popular decision, and many expected him to be on the level as Latifi and Mazepin. I even recall a few comments on this sub predicting him to be *worse* than Mazepin. All of this made me all the more happy for Zhou when he scored a point in his very first race, and proceeded to be a perfectly competent driver for the rest of his career.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not touting Zhou to be a wonder kid or anything, but he was nowhere close to being considered one of the worse drivers in F1, and he was miles better than Mazepin and Latifi. Zhou was able to score points in all three of his seasons for Sauber, which isn't anything to snub at considering the quality of the car in 2024 in particular, and whilst Bottas was definitely better than him, he didn't completely annihilate him the way a bunch of us were expecting.

I think another thing to point out is that a lot of the fury of all the other drivers not making it to that Sauber seat doesn't really exist anymore. Piastri made it to F1 the following year with McLaren with very little else needing to be said about that move. De Vries did eventually make it to F1, but he undeniably underdelivered, and whilst Pourchairre sadly didn't make it to F1, I'd argue he never really grew as a driver as much as he was expected to, following his initial F2 season. Yes he was talented enough for F1, but I'd argue he wouldn't have been the superstar that everyone at the time was predicting him to be.

Throughout Zhou's career in F1, the quote ""he's proven that he deserves to be in F1"" was spoken out a lot, and the main reason for that is that prior to his debut in 2022, a lot of people didn't believe that. He may not have been the very best, but for China's first F1 driver, he did a remarkable job representing his country, and he was a whole lot better than many other drivers that proceeded and succeeded him, which had far more compelling resumes.","[""It's difficult if you aren't part of an academy to get a good seat in F1."", ""It also helped him that he is geuinely likable person and having Bottas guiding him in all areas...  Bottas 2.0 was in full swing, his media game is strong and a lot of that spilled over to Zhou's corner, they were popular driver pairing.\n\nI think he did just fine, not stellar but fine job. He was instantly hired as reserve driver by Ferrari too."", 'If you want to go and read something funny, in 2020 people here were pissed that Renault picked Alonso instead of Zhou to replace Ricciardo.', ""People just really, really dislike pay drivers. A lot more of the latest batch rookies are well received because they performed highly in junior series as well as F1. Getting promoted after finishing away from the top in F2 while the champion barely gets a free practice session just doesn't feel right.\n\n\nZhou has been very fortunate. Drivers have been sacked for way less."", 'I think disappointment at Giovinazzi not working out drove some of the anti-Zhou commentary, and sinophobia was likely an element with some people. As an Alfa supporter I was happy to be a Zhou supporter.\n\nSomehow his last year was the most disappointing, although hard to disentangle that from how awful the team was between Vasseur and Binotto.', ""He wasn't miles better than Latifi.  \n\n\nBut I recall the angst wasn't about Zhou, the person, but that he went past others seemed more deserving.  And that it was primarily for money.  \nPeople always want new drivers on the grid ... But only the ones they root for."", 'He exceeded the very low expectations in his first two years, sure. But, for whatever reason, he was as bad as people thought he initially would be last year. He qualified 3 tenths off 19th at Monza, two tenths at Miami, half a second at Monaco, 3 tenths in Canada, two tenths in Austria, half a second at Spa, half a second at Singapore, 4 tenths at Mexico, 6 tenths at Brazil. He qualified more than half a second off Bottas on\xa0**NINE**\xa0occasions.', 'I’m sorry but being slightly better than Latifi does not prove that he was good enough for F1. They were more deserving drivers for his seat and his results in his 3 F1 seasons doesn’t change that.', 'He was on average 0.600% slower than Bottas in qualifying last year, the fact that somebody is even attempting to defend that is ridiculous. Just for comparison, Sargeant, driver which got by far the most shit last year was 0.280% slower than Albon and that’s with driving the fucked up chassis for most of the year.', ""Did Latifi and Mazepin under deliver? Sure they weren't good at all - Mazepin especially seeming to not even understand certain things about the sport - but that era Williams and that era Haas are likely the two worst cars we've seen on the grid since contraction to 10 teams. What exactly were they expected to do? I think they were exactly what was anticipated, which were unproven drivers who didn't belong spinning out and crashing in some of the worst cars the sport has ever seen.""]",151,82,0.79,151,81,81,22,4,0.010000000000000009,22

Honda doesn't even want their own team unlike Toyota!"", ""Probably the coolest TPC programme in F1. Quality tracks and drivers who probably wouldn't get a chance otherwise. Plus the tickets for this were only £6."", 'Seems like fun...  kinda odd feeling to me:  long start straight to 1, then...  seems pretty technical with technical lots fidley bits and rather slow seeming corners.   short lap too?  length?   Also, this was in the original Pole Position, yes?', ""I always hated this track in Gran Turismo. Just not enjoyable to drive, it doesn't flow like Suzuka does. How's it for racing in F1?"", 'Fuji wouldnt exactly a great overtaking track for F1 cars either tbh.', 'Suzuka has several corners that are absolutely bonkers even for a modern F1 car. You really get to see who is willing to risk it to go faster.\n\nFuji doesn’t have a single corner that seems remotely challenging to a modern F1 car.', ""Agreed, seems like it would be especially ass for overtaking if F1 ran there. There's 1 line for every corner and like maybe one sequence you could try around the outside for first corner to be on the inside of the second corner and overtake, even at the end of thr straight might be only overtaking place on whole track. Doesnt even look fun to drive solo. Gotta say tho Japan has some really fun tracks for other types of racing tho, love them in iracing"", 'You know F1 was at Fuji 2007 and 2008? You can go see on YouTube what it was like to race there.']",49,9,0.89,49,8,8,3,1,0.0,3
