1ikju26,"2024 ""Reliability team standing""",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ikju26/2024_reliability_team_standing/,2025-02-08, Discussion,"

https://preview.redd.it/70isev7czvhe1.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=a73017de026ae12f5ec7c1251ec47309bda48fff

I came up with a slightly different ranking for the teams.  
The idea behind the ""Reliability Standings"" is to focus on the overall health of a team, not just on exceptional circumstances.

Rather than simply adding up the points of all the drivers in a team, we only keep the score of the driver who earned the fewest points in each race.

This highlights a team's reliability in maintaining consistent performance and minimizes the impact of drivers who might have had an exceptional result, but don't reflect the overall stability of the team.

This ranking allows for a different comparison of teams, taking into account consistency and the ability to avoid mistakes or retirements.

","['I don\'t really see this as accurate at all. You can\'t just ignore exceptionally good performances and then keep exceptionally bad ones in your model, it creates a warped image of teams with clear 1st and 2nd drivers like Aston. There is no way that Aston was less ""reliable"" throughout the entire season than Alpine. Alpine gets a massive boost from Brazil, which definitely wasn\'t the norm. \n\nWhat this tells me is that Stroll, who was almost always the ""2nd"" driver, was not extracting enough from the car, not the actual reliability of the team.', 'I think your attempt in showing reliability is not working here at all.\nyou just turned exceptionally good into exceptionally bad performance reviews.\nthe stat does not show what you think it does.', ""Shouldn't your scores already tell you that your model is likely not good? Just look at the distribution"", 'This is more of a ‚Äòhow often is the car good enough for the second driver to get points‚Äô, no?\n\nFor reliability you‚Äôd potentially be better showing the median points haul with the range.', 'I thought this would be about DNFs, maybe consistency/stability would be a better name for it', ""Yet another stat that confirms that Ferrari had the best lineup last year. Though, I wouldn't say this stat is reflective on how good Red Bull, Alpine and Aston Martin were."", 'spot on. he just turned the concept he wanted to avoid by 180 degrees to the exact opposite without actually telling us anything about reliability.']",0,7,0.25,0,7,7,0,0,-0.04999999999999999,0
