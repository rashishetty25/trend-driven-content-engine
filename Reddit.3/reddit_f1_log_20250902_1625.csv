It\'s definitely hurtful for any young F1 driver to accept that outcome. \n\nExcerpt from Marko\'s latest interview \n \n> On the one hand, Hadjar impressed during his Formula One debut year; on the other, too early promotion could be risky, given that Max Verstappen has outscored all his teammates in recent years. In other words, Hadjar\'s career shouldn\'t be cut at the root either. ""But Isack is different,"" Marko replied.\n\n> The 82-year-old top adviser says he saw the latter again during the racing weekend in the Netherlands. ""On Friday he had engine problems. One session was completely missed and the other average. But I wasn\'t worried at all. He even said to me, \'I\'ve got the speed, I\'ll rank in the top five.\'"" Hadjar has kept his word and that, according to Marko, marks the mental strength of the sister team driver. So when asked if the 20-year-old talent will be able to withstand the pressure of Red Bull\'s second seat, Marko nods affirmatively.\n\n> However, Red Bull are in no hurry to make a final choice and do not want to do so with excitement now. Marko has already indicated that he will wait until October anyway, with the Mexican Grand Prix as a possible point of reference. Yuki Tsunoda can still prove his worth until then, and Marko has been clear after being asked what exactly he expects from the Japanese: ""Consistency and performance.""\n\n> In Zandvoort, Tsunoda had exactly the same specification as Verstappen, but failed to turn that into a position in Q3. During the tumultuous race, the Japanese had to settle for the P9, although Marko does not want to judge too harshly. ""He had bad luck with the security car. Yuki had just changed his tyres and two laps later the safety car left. That put him in the grid tail, but otherwise he didn\'t do anything wrong either.""', ""Bold statement from him, considering that he's still under RB"", 'I feel like he would have given more time if it looked like there was a better chance of seeing that progress.\n\nAt the very least he should have been given until Japan and let him race on a track he has actually been to before.', 'He was thrown in at the deep-end...............praying Isack Hadjar is left well alone.

1n5trk2,My Experience with Disabilities at the Dutch Grand Prix – Accessibility in F1 Needs Serious Attention,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n5trk2/my_experience_with_disabilities_at_the_dutch/,2025-09-01, Discussion,"Hi all,
I wanted to share my experience attending the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix as someone living with Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, in the hope it raises awareness around how inaccessible F1 events can be for fans with disabilities.
This was my first Grand Prix, and I was so excited to finally go. I’d booked the F1 Experiences Live Pit Straight package (not exactly a budget ticket) and reached out months in advance to explain my needs – mainly urgent toilet access and limited mobility when walking fast or through crowds. I made it really clear that I carry a ""Can’t Wait"" card due to my Crohn’s and need bathroom access urgently at times.

Here’s how it went:
Thursday – Track Experience Day:
No seating in the main areas during waiting times for the pit walk or guest appearances. I had to stand for hours, which caused joint pain.

No visible bathrooms near the food trucks, so I avoided eating altogether in case I needed the toilet quickly.
The pit lane walk was late in the day, and most garages were closing down due to curfew – it felt like others who went earlier got a more engaging experience.

Friday–Sunday – Race Days:
My grandstand seat (Row 2, Seat 134 on the Pit Straight Grandstand) was not near the extra care court, despite requests. I had to walk through heavy crowds to reach it – not ideal when you physically can’t move fast or stand comfortably.
On Saturday, I had an arthritis flare-up and couldn’t make it back to my seat. I spent most of the day in the care court instead.

The extra care court staff were amazing – they offered me a chair and even helped with ice for my knee. But I missed out on watching most of the race from my actual seat because it was just too far from the bathroom.
The bigger issue:

It honestly feels like basic accessibility at F1 events is tied to VIP ticket levels. If you want decent toilet access, seating support, or less walking, you have to spend thousands. That’s not right.

Accessible event planning shouldn’t be treated as a luxury add-on. I paid over £1,400 for my ticket and still ended up spending half the weekend worrying about whether I could reach a toilet in time.

As a fan, a content creator, and someone living with chronic illness, I want to enjoy the sport I love without feeling like I don’t belong at the track. And I know I’m not the only one.


Final thoughts:
F1 needs to do better. Accessibility shouldn't depend on how much you can afford. I’d love to see:
Clearly marked accessible toilets and seating near all grandstands.
Disability support staff onsite for guidance.
More flexibility in seating assignments for those who request help in advance.

Actual disability liaison contacts for fans planning to attend.
I’ll be sharing more content about my experience to raise awareness, but I wanted to start here. If you’ve had a similar experience or know of other venues doing accessibility well, I’d love to hear about it.


Thanks for reading – feel free to share or comment if you think this is a conversation F1 needs to keep having.

Edit: when I say private bathrooms I mean a disabled bathroom
I am also not asking for anything I am just raising awareness for other disabled guest who want to go to a F1 Grand Prix","['I sympathize with you because I was at the Dutch GP and it was very difficult to navigate the crowds and the foot traffic at times. \n\nHonestly though I can’t imagine trying to attend an event like this with Crohns. I grew up attending large sporting events (major league baseball, football, hockey, and basketball) and this is my second F1 GP. I’ve also been to Wacken Open Air festival in Germany with 90k people. Bathrooms are always a problem at any event of this kind. I personally felt that bathroom access at the Dutch GP was decent and better than at Suzuka. The problem wasn’t accessibility per se (we sat in the pit grand stands, row 1, pretty close to you actually) as we were able to reach them quickly. The problem is simply the sheer volume of people. Foot traffic was insane. It took forever to get anywhere and going from our section (126/127) to where the extra care court was located would have taken a bit outside of going when F1 was on track. \n\nHow could they have done this better? The only thing I can think of would have been simply having more bathrooms and perhaps keep some maintained strictly for folks with urgent needs. But I don’t think they did a poor job, it’s just the reality of events this size.\n\nI think the biggest thing they could and should do would be to manage foot traffic. There’s no gates, lanes, or anything to direct people either in the circuit or outside on the way to the train stations. Just a giant clusterfuck of people jostling their way through. Completely the opposite experience to Japan and it made the whole experience much less pleasant, especially since I get anxiety in large crowds.', 'Did you consider buying tickets for the extra care platform?\n\nMy experience there on Sunday was very good. True the seating was on ground level so not the best view. But near accessible toilets and with personel for care.\n\nAgree that accessible toilets should be available for every ticket option.\n\nAddition: The Netherlands is behind general accessibility. But F1 is regarded as one of the most accessible event of the country. They let an external party Handicap.nl organize it for them. Their only focus on people with disabilities makes it good / great.', 'Arent there toilets directly under those grandstands? At least last year there were', 'Sorry that you had such a bad experience. Hope you comments reach the right people and they take it seriously.', ""Can you go through this with us?\n\nhttps://dutchgp.com/app/uploads/2025/08/2025_F1-Netherlands-Wayfinding-Map_Negative_VISUAL.pdf\n\nhttps://oversteer48.com/ben-pon-grandstand-zandvoort/#:~:text=As%20the%20video%20shows%2C%20sitting,your%20view%20of%20Turn%201.\n\nThe pit grandstand (27) where you bought your ticket for (you didn't buy a main grandstand ticket which is nearer to the extra care court) seat 134, from what I can see, has toilets directly underneath it at that location, and there is a stairway access point directly down to it at the back, so you move to the back of the stand of where you are and make your way down to the toilets. Is that not urgent toilet access?\n\nOn the map, wherever there is a food icon, there is a bathroom icon nearby. You say you didn't see a visible bathroom near the food trucks and therefore didn't eat but if you followed the map, which you get with your F1 experience ticket, would you have found one very quickly?\n\nYou also say you are a content creater and you will be sharing more content about your experience and you are starting here, what else will you be sharing?"", ""As a track owner who needs to spend millions to get an F1 race, I can see why they do what they do.  Most tracks sit idle or see materially lower attendance outside of F1 week. To build a venue that supports what you are asking for would likely be cost prohibitive, given the fact pattern. \n\nI think about sports stadiums in the US, where we have the ADA, compliance costs millions, where limited mobility is the focus.  I can not think of a situation where there are special bathrooms limited to a select group. They have handicapped bathrooms,  but they don't prohibit others from using them.  \n\nI empathize with your situation,  but I am not sure I agree that this level of special needs facilities should be mandated."", ""At such events the only thing you can do is concentrate the people with extra needs in a certain section. Cost wise you can't have extra toilets, care workers and buggys at every grandstand. Tracks are huge, the stands are often kilometers apart. And such places are not public areas, they are owned and run by companies. F1 Zandvoort is quiting because of the costs. Assen apparently has a disability quality mark, Zandvoort doesn't seem to have one.  They're also built for small trackday events 95% of the time, 4% larger events (say a couple of thousand people) and perhaps 2 or 3 very large events. So the permanent facilities are all concentrated at the paddock and not around the track."", 'I’m seeing lots of Americans thinking we have this right, but as a disabled person at COTA a few years ago, I don’t think we should be resting on our laurels. \n\nIn my situation, I’m and older woman that struggles with mobility, but I wasn’t asking for anything other than what COTA said that it was providing - I knew there would be long walks, long waits and I planned accordingly. What I hadn’t planned on were shuttles that never came, or shuttles that so full from previous stops that certain locations on the track were without transportation options entirely for what turned out to be hours at a time. \n\nThere was a back-up! Armies of golf carts had been hired, but we learned that with one exception, the only way to get a ride was to bribe them - something they were explicitly not allowed to do. We were once told that “tips were appreciated”. Another said, “We are raising money for charity if you’d like to make a donation.” We actually were relieved by the honesty of one woman saying, “I’m charging $20 a ride.” \n\nAs with so many things pertaining to disability rights, improving conditions for the disabled improves them for everyone. Running more shuttles and taking time to ensure all stops have shuttles that can take passengers makes the experience better for everyone. Hiring the golf carts for those with extra needs is a good plan on paper, but when those drivers become extra independent contractors that broke down trust and confidence quickly. \n\nGood planning, good follow through and transparency aren’t limited to disability access - they are the hallmarks of good event planning. Disabled patrons are often the first to notice when that falls apart, but by the second day, it was evident to most.']",800,195,0.77,800,1596,1596,-3,0,0.0,-3

Driving as fast as possible with a fixed amount of energy (or fuel).\n\nFormula 1 is not an old-school racing series, but rather the tip of the iceberg when it comes to technological progress and innovation in motorsport."", ""Translated Text:\n\nThe upcoming engine regulations for 2026 haven't even seen the racetrack yet, and the FIA, Formula 1, and engine manufacturers are already discussing the next powertrain concept. Formula 1 has long debated the return of the V10. But now, a V8 engine is the favorite.\n\nIt will be a 2.4-liter V8 engine, as used from 2006 to 2013. A new feature is the efficiency factor. CO2-neutral fuel will be burned with pre-chamber ignition for fuel-saving performance. The combustion engine will be coupled with a hybrid component producing 220 to 240 kilowatts of power. The electric power would thus be halfway between the current engine formula (120 kW) and next year's solution (350 kW).\n\nAfter the Italian GP, \u200b\u200ball parties involved plan to meet for another engine summit. Two questions will be addressed: Is a return to the V8 with hybrid components the right solution? And: Should it arrive in 2029, 2030, or perhaps only at the end of the future regulatory cycle in 2031? The FIA \u200b\u200bis reportedly pushing for 2029. And it has at least two supporters, RB Powertrains and Cadillac."", ""Sounds like it all depends just how quickly the manufacturers are willing to move to them. Can't see them coming 29 though, just feels too early.\n\nAlso, think this will be one step closer to F1 going towards the entertainment route instead of being a tech showcase. Feels like if you want to see the most advanced tech that aligns with road mobility, thats going to be in FE, whereas F1 will be more of an aero focus championship with less emphasis on the powertrain."", ""You know what, I like it. I've always been a fan of the V8's over V10's. And I think the hybrid system provides a good layer of extra strategy to drivers. So imo it's the best of both worlds."", 'Lots of daydreaming in the comments without a hint of some reflection about reality of F1 politics involved in this topic.', 'F1 could potentially be a HUGE advertisement for fully synthetic renewable biofuels if the sport actually focused on getting closer to carbon neutrality, rather than just having marketing and press revolve around it, and going the ""easy"" hybrid route that\'s super visible. Weighing the cars down with battery packs and slapping ""Hybrid"" on things is a bandaid.\n\nYes, the big footprint is from the logistics, and with DHL as partners they\'re managing to slash the environmental effects of taking the circus around the world, but the more public focus should be on sustainable racing that\'s great to watch and is a huge spectacle.\n\nSince the introduction of hybrids the cars have become fatter, heavier, and while faster, they\'re less able to race, follow eachother and overtake. They\'re also substantially less exciting to watch than cars of older generations.\n\nAs someone who runs an EV as a daily, is hugely conscious of the environment, living in one of the most environmentally conscious countries on the planet that runs on 100% renewable energy, and is a qualified engineer and car mechanic, stop screwing around with all this hybrid stuff for 22-26 cars with emissions outputs that are a drop in the ocean in terms of the sport\'s carbon footprint.\n\nFocus on the tracks, the logistics, the manufacturing, the recycling and the travel, where the biggest savings are to be made, and let the racing be a spectacle that draws people into the sport where you can then punch with a bigger message about environmental awareness. \n\nGive awards, creditations and additional prize money to teams for hitting environmental targets and team efficiency targets. Incentifize teams to look for ways to minmize their footprint or go fully neutral. Give them something to show off as part of their branding.\n\nDo the same with tracks and give them discounts on their hosting fees if they can demonstrate they\'re running sustainably. Cover the paddock roofs and infields with solar panels and turbines - put the tech front and center on TV and show it off to the audience. Let F1 be a platform to make this kind of tech seem normal.\n\nThe racing can still be green, but it can also be loud, exciting, and highly strung. Imagine getting Shell, Total, BP, maybe even some large US players like ExxonMobil and Chevron fully involved, and looking at ways to supply fully sustainable, carbon neutral, synthetic biofuels for racing with tech that could then be applied to the road.\n\nStrip the hybrid systems away from the cars completely, ditch the battery packs and go back to smaller, faster, lighter cars that have a better power to weight ratio and are simpler and cheaper to build. Cut back on the tech and make the racing more fun again, and while yes, they\'ll use about 30% more fuel, mandate the use of 100% renewable fuel and make sure that every mode of logistics is doing the same.\n\nHell, Volvo, Scania, DAF, Iveco, Mercedes and others are all building electric trucks these days, mandate that teams have to use them for the european leg of the season to further slash emissions.\n\nPush the sport back toward naturally aspirated V8, V10, or even V12 power plants that are more simple to build, repair, and recycle than the hybrids, and change the engine allocation numbers per season to a split system - x number of physical power units with x number of permitted full rebuilds with new internals during the year, with teams demonstrating that they\'re sustainably recycling everything. \n\nIt feels like a no brainer to me to completely revolutionize the sport while keeping its core intact. The actual running of the cars and their emissions is such a small part of the issue, yet it\'s the one they\'re probing at the hardest to the detriment of the sport by making it harder to get into and hard to sustain financially when there\'s so much other low-hanging fruit.', ""As much as I'd prefer this, it's a bit silly to go for this ruleset so soon after the new regs come in. 2030 at the earliest.\n\nThat said...This sounds like the perfect formula imo.

Like a lot of people my first reaction was ""WTF"", but I think the people who\'ve observed that going to F2 is more about learning European tracks and Pirelli tyres for Herta than the SL points are correct. Obviously F2 Pirellis aren\'t identical to F1 ones, but they\'re certainly closer than Indy Firestones.

1n6i3d2,Let's look back at Vettel's penalty in the 2019 Canadian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n6i3d2/lets_look_back_at_vettels_penalty_in_the_2019/,2025-09-02, Discussion,"A bit of context for all you whippersnappers who joined F1 during the 2021 season. 2019 was built up as the year of Ferrari. All the preseason testing all pointed towards Ferrari being THE team to beat during the season. What we actually got was Mercedes being as dominant as they've ever been. Every race up to Canada has either been an easy Mercedes 1-2, or a race where Ferrari shot themselves in the foot (Bahrain and Canada). Yes new viewers, we were all making fun of Ferrari before 2022.

The Canadian Grand Prix was one that many were enjoying during the race, mainly because as long as Vettel didn't suffer an engine blowout like Leclerc did in Bahrain, he would win the race. Unfortunately during the last ten laps or so, Vettel made an error. He went off the track, onto the grass, and rejoined the track in such a way that Hamilton had to brake in order to avoid a collision.

This resulted in Vettel receiving a five second penalty. A penalty that resulted in Hamilton and Mercedes winning yet another race. At this point in the season, none of the races were won by a different constructor, and Canada was only the second race where P2 wasn't Bottas.

I suspect this played a large hand in the massive backlash over the decision to give Vettel a penalty. Not just online, but the Sky F1 pundits, Channel 4 pundits, TV personalities, it was a wildly despised penalty. This led in turn to the FIA introducing a yellow card like system, where drivers were basically let off with a warning if they committed minor five second penalty offenses. This meant that certain driver on driver duels such as Verstappen v Leclerc at Austria and Hamilton v Leclerc in Italy resulted in the winner forcing a driver off the track and getting away with it, so the FIA quietly reverted back to the old way of doing it.

Personally speaking, I believe the only way Vettel doesn't deserve a penalty is if you don't believe that Hamilton was allowed to take the standard racing line at standard racing speed whilst Vettel sorted himself out, and nowadays the backlash has softened massively. What do you think of the penalty? Are you still mad about it?","[""What's the point of this thread?

That's a standard reaction.\xa0\n\n\nThe gamesmanship after the incident is what got the penalty issued"", 'It was a racing incident back then and its a racing incident now, the decision was unjustified and robbed us of a great race to the finish line', ""There was a great analysis from back in the day that basically Seb was fuel saving from the first corner. Aside from the small off, he was the Seb of old that weekend; drove like a man possessed and really put manners on everyone else in the grid.\n\n*Even more interestingly* though, was a fantastic bit of investigative journalism, I think from a Romanian journalist; the findings of which basically said Ferrari were ready to contest the decision, but were offered a better deal for their presence in F1 if they didn't contest Canada.\n\nI can't remember the source exactly, but I might be able to dig it up later (unless someone else is willing to go down the rabbit hole in the meantime).""]",0,39,0.29,0,33,33,0,4,0.04999999999999999,0
