1guz22f,Why is George beating or matching Lewis for 2 seasons out of 3 so overlooked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1guz22f/why_is_george_beating_or_matching_lewis_for_2/,2024-11-19, Discussion,"Seriously, unless we agree that Lewis is basically nowhere near his prime level, then why is Russell not getting any credit for what he’s doing.

Yet people act like he’s merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about “experimental setups” or “Lewis is just unmotivated”, but, I’m sorry, that’s just a cop-out. Then we can just argue endlessly that basically no driver is worse than another driver, since there could always be intangibles like that, “oh, he just doesn’t care about driving in midfield cars”. really? 


I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it’s just that people overlook George because they don’t like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance. It's hard to compare when we have no real baseline when it comes to the car."", 'personally i’m curious to see how george and lewis do next year to grasp where they actually are because this merc is a very confusing car. Even if lewis is past his prime imo he is way too good of a driver to be struggling to get into the points.

Otherwise you wouldn't stop hearing about it."", '> Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019\n\nIt was Charles 2nd season in F1 against a driver who was competing for a title the season before. \n\nIn general I do agree Russell has been underrated but don’t agree with all the arguments you’ve put forward.', 'Is it a hot take to say that George is better than Norris?\nI mean this was literally the result in F2, and people seem to forget that.', 'I mean it’s actually about set up issues and a horrible car as a whole.

They’re 2 points apart this year and last year Lewis ended third, while George ended up in 8th place.', 'It’s hard to actually value the performances seeing as both drivers and team are so hit and miss. \n\nOver the 3 years though George has done a great job and I’d be surprised if Redbull don’t ask for him in a swap should Merc sign Max', 'The only people who genuinely think Russell is ""only a top midfielder"" are the type of \'fans\' who are far too comfortable in spouting their ignorance in general about the sport. He\'s clearly comfortably in the Leclerc & Norris (and potentially Piastri in the future) bracket, and those who try and argue otherwise are just trying to fuel a narrative that fits whatever agenda they have.\n\nThat said, you\'re also making some statements in there regarding Lewis & Vettel that really don\'t make you look too much better.', 'George is in a quagmire. If he never beat Lewis at all, they’d say he’s the second coming of kovalainen and a burn out. If he beat Lewis three out of three seasons, it’s because Lewis is “past his prime” and “not all there anymore”. \n\nIn reality, he’s acquainted himself well under the toughest of circumstances, going up against the veritable goat in struggling cars. He’s taken it right to Lewis from the start and came out on top in 2022. Lewis crushed him in 23, but they’ve both made the best where possible of this year’s car. For all intents and purposes, this pairing is exactly what we expected to be but without the championship contending cars we expected to be underneath them.\n\nNow that Lewis is leaving, George has a narrow window to really stake his claim to the throne before the Antonelli tidal wave becomes overwhelming. He has to crush Kimi utterly and make him look like he never deserved to be here in the first place.']",3068,1240,0.82,3068,15159,15159,38,13,0.0,38

The cars are hopelessly out of step with the characteristics of F1 cars and the discrepancies in car performance that exist due to a lack of testing and availability of spare parts will never be solved because that would require them actually putting their hand in their own pocket.', 'That is why Super Formula is seen as a finishing school. It has more downforce, power steering(F2 does not. Professional drivers(meaning you have guys in the series for a few years and know the thing inside out), and you need to learn new circuits so it also does not aid the F2 graduates.', 'Pretty sure Yuki was never even given any FP session before his call up.', ""The thing is that junior Formula series used to scale pretty decently. Every move up the ladder means a car that is faster, brakes harder, has more downforce and experiences more G-forces. The tech increases every step and so does complexity, but in the end setup works largely the same. Pretty clear cut.\n\nHowever, nowadays driving an F1 car is way more than just driving as hard as you can. Many of the younger drivers will quite easily be quick over a few laps in an F1 car. To do good in an F1 race tough, that's where the scaling between F1 and junior categories falls on its ass.\n\nMedia and social media pressure is immense, but that has, at least in some part, always been the case for the sport so I'm going to leave that out if it. What is incredibly different is that an F1 driver nowadays has to be able to read a car a lot better and a lot more than they used to.\n\nTake braking. Before the introduction of hybrid elements a driver could basically only modify their brake balance in the car. Nowadays it's brake balance, brake migration (the shifting of brake balance depending on the brake phase), the amount of energy harvesting / '(hybrid) engine braking' etc. Those settings don't exist in any of the other cars and can greatly mess with a drivers ability to be on the absolute limit (Ricciardo's McLaren comments for example).\n\nThan there's conservation of energy and tires. So much of F1 nowadays is centred around keeping the tires alive long enough without them falling off the infamous cliff and making sure you don't use too much fuel. In essence, the car does not carry enough fuel to go a full race distance on full-send mode, so they need to conserve that energy. For most (junior) drivers this is a rather foreign concept as during the junior races they can easily just fill the car up and go all-out for the full distance. Being able to feel the car, being right on the edge of what the tires can do and what fits your fuel target is something incredibly finicky and not all drivers are great at doing so. Combine that with either having to attack or defend for position on track and you've got a complex task that they aren't taught from an early age.\n\nDrivers like De Vries are great examples. He's shown that he's a fast driver in plenty of categories, but he lacks the skill-set a driver needs to perform in F1."", 'The problem isn’t that F2 cars should be more like F1, it’s that F1 cars should be more like F2.', 'The major issue with the Junior Formulas is the lack of spaces and opportunity on the top category.\n\n\nYou have old and washed drivers holding on spots on mid-and-back field and some even on top teams... There is no way to get in unless someone gets injuried.']",576,76,0.97,576,71,71,329,24,0.020000000000000018,329

Good to hear that they are also considering to raise the weight limit to accommodate the cooling system into the adjustments. I wonder if they will make it mandatory to wear during specific weather or anybody could wear it at any time *(given Mercedes' overheating issue, it seems like the heat comes on for them even in overall weather conditions that are not necessarily the worst in comparison, so I am trying to figure out how it works, especially for them)*\n\nThe previous idea of an AC unit in the car in of itself does seem rather tacky, but given the introduction of this cooling system, I would argue that I don't think drivers, whom are highly trained athletes, should be close to passing out in high temperatures, especially with what we saw in Qatar 2023 and Singapore 2024.
