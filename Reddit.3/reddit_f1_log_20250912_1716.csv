1nf2lo9,"Please be respectful to the race organizers and understand why Verstappen's Porsche is ""detuned""",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nf2lo9/please_be_respectful_to_the_race_organizers_and/,2025-09-12, Discussion,"There are several publications, among which Motorsport.com, claiming Max Verstappen won't be able to win the GT4 class in the Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie tomorrow, because his Porsche is ""detuned"".

First, the NLS doesn't have a GT4 class. GT4-spec cars are split up into a bunch of different categories, like SP8T for turbocharged GT4-cars with specially designed parts (i.e. Bilstein suspension on Jimmy Broadbent's car) and SP10 for SRO-homologated GT4-cars (SRO is the licenceholder of GT4).

Verstappen's Porsche is entered in the CUP3 class, which is a separate class for detuned Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport cars. He is not competing against other GT4 cars. If his Porsche were not detuned, it wouldn't be a Permit B car and to get his Permit A ('GT3 licence'), he has to drive a Permit B car first.

Due to articles like Motorsport.com wrote, there have been several hate comments directed towards the NLS organizers, because Verstappen fans think his Porsche is nerfed to slow him down and what not and that it's unfair. Please be respectful and do your research.","['Half the argument on here are between folks who don’t understand F1 rules.

1nezs19,Formula 1 @ Goodwood Revival 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nezs19/formula_1_goodwood_revival_2025/,2025-09-12, Discussion,"Hi everyone,

The annual **Goodwood Revival** event has kicked off earlier today, and as per usual it features various retro era F1 machinery as well as numerous notable names from the sport. As such, I wanted to make a sort of PSA post, similar to the one I've made a few months back for the Festival of Speed, so people around here are made aware of the Revival and tune in for some nice classic racing

For those of you new to Goodwood - it's a large-scale event held in Chichester, England that covers all things ""speed"", hence the name of the *main* attraction, the Festival of Speed, dating back to the late 1990s. Over the years Goodwood has expanded beyond the scope of the FOS to two additional events: the Members Meeting, consisting primarily of the Goodwood Racing Club members gathering to drive cars, both fast and slow, new and old, and the Revival, dedicated to decades long gone, invoking the first half of the 20th Century, and this post is covering precisely that.

Unlike the FOS however you won't be seeing *all* kinds of F1 cars, instead giving the spotlight to vehicles ranging from pre-war Bathtubs on Wheels and up to the 1960s, but the action is still very much worth watching into even if you're not a petrolhead and check out F1 on occasion.

Here's how the scheduling for this year's Revival looks F1-wise:

Event Name | Main Theme | Featured Cars | Date & Time
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
**Goodwood Trophy** | Celebrating the post-war grids that lined up during the early years of the Motor Circuit in the late 1940s and early ‘50s, bringing together some of the oldest cars at the Revival | Grand Prix and Voiturette cars from 1930 to all the way to 1951, with an entry list that includes ERAs, Maseratis and Alfa Romeos that pre-date the F1 World Championship | Practice on Sept 12th @ 12:05 UTC // Race on Sept 13th @ 09:35 UTC
**Richmond & Gordon Trophy** | Bringing back to life a golden era of Formula 1 racing, and resulting in a mixed grid of differing approaches to the business of Grand Prix racing | A selection of 2.5-litre Grand Prix cars that raced between 1952-60, with machines hailing from a variety of manufacturers, including but not limited to the heavier Maserati 250Fs and Ferrari 246s, racing against the forward-thinking BRMs and Lotuses | Practice on Sept 12th @ 15:45 // Race on Sept 14th @ 17:10 UTC
**Glover Trophy** | Celebrating the proud history of Formula 1 racing at the Goodwood Motor Circuit, and a tribute to one of F1’s most popular non-Championship races with a grid evoking one of the most romantic eras of the sport. | A grid of 1.5-litre Grand Prix cars that raced between 1961-’65, such as the Lotus 25, as well as Cooper, BRM and Ferrari vehicles all making their mark on track | Practice on Sept 12th @ 16:50 UTC // Race on Sept 14th @ 15:55 UTC
**Jim Clark Tribute** | Paying tribute to the man who is often regarded as the greatest racing driver of all time on the 60th anniversary of his second World Drivers’ Championship victory. | DKW Sonderklasse,  Lotus Elite, Jaguar D-Type, Lotus 18, Aston Martin DBR1, Lotus 25, Lotus 49, Ford GT40, Lotus Cortina, and more | Track Parade on Sept 12th @ 11:40 UTC, Sept 13th @ 13:50 UTC, and Sept 14th @ 11:50 UTC
**Alfa Romeo Celebration** | Giving those in attendance the opportunity to experience many of the great stories across Alfa Romeo's rich racing and automotive history first hand, with a wide variety of machinery set to take part in a dynamic parade throughout the weekend | Alfa Romeo RL, P2, Tipo B, 6C, 8C, 158 Alfetta, Giulietta SZ, Giulia TZ and GTA,  Tipo 33, and more | Track Parade on Sept 12th @ 15:25 UTC, Sept 13th @ 16:10 UTC, and Sept 14th @ 16:40 UTC

Beyond that, various F1 personalities will also be present at the Revival, competing in the races held during this weekend, including (but not limited to) **Jenson Button, Jacques Villeneuve, Karun Chandhok, Max Chilton, Érik Comas, and Adrian Newey**

For the full timetable, you can visit [this link](https://www.goodwood.com/motorsport/goodwood-revival/plan-your-day/timetable/), and the official broadcasts can be accessed via YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd_wMcXJiGw)

Also, keep in mind that the livestream will be running all weekend-long, with a full replay of each day starting immedaitely as soon as the live coverage concludes, while the VODs for Days 1-3 will be uploaded separately on Goodwood channel at a later date (usually around 10-14 days after)

Of course the Revival itself isn't limited to *just* Formula 1, and in fact there's much more to check out from the same time periods but different racing series. Again, refer to the full timetable if you're interested 

Anyways that's all from me. Have fun and enjoy, folks!","['I wonder if Horner will show up there.

It\'s like letting the inmates run the asylum.\n\nThe rules should be very simple and be what these guys have grown up being expected to do in junior racing:\n\n* If a car manages to get significant overlap they have to be given at least a car\'s width to the track edge\n* Signficant overlap could be defined in many ways but I would say at least front wheel ahead of rear wheel\n* No one can ever ""own"" a corner, any car alongside must be given space\n\nThis is how Leclerc raced Piastri and it resulted in a fantastic overtake, letter of the law, Leclerc was free to basically shove him out the way.\n\nMy proposed rules give more leeway to attackers to be confident they won\'t be taken out but makes defending still possible if done well, it would allow more multi-corner battling as cars would remain side by side without the current threat of being shoved off if the other driver claims the corner.', ""Great read, thanks for the share. There's also a podcast featuring Mark, Josh and Edd from earlier this week which covers this topic.\n\nAs they mention in the article and the podcast, the drivers are the ones that have pushed for this. The issue is that written wording can never cover the vast array of racing scenarios.\n\nMark said on the podcast earlier this week, 'the stewards aren't inconsistent, the racing incidents are', but each incident is compared against a checklist that the stewards are being forced to use.\n\nSainz - Bearman was a good example of this. The rules as written didn't require Sainz to square off the corner, and because he's ticked the right boxes, the stewards are forced to give a penalty to Bearman."", 'IMO the broken racing rule is allowing mechanics to work on cars during red flags. If the race is suspended, the race is suspended, including repairs, tire changes, etc. Parc fermé conditions until cars go back on track.', 'I feel like we are having a very heavy Dunning-Kruger effect type of situation with this debate about the overtake rules', ""It's not just the rules, a big part is the enforcing of them, and it sucks for drivers and spectators.\n\nYou see an incident on track and you don't know if it's going to be a penalty or if it's not even going to be investigated at all, with Max and Norris turn 1, it was noted but who knows what they would have decided on, it clearly looked like Max was in the clear by the rules, but RBR either questioned the rules or did not trust how the stewards would enforce those rules."", 'Take BEA/SAI for instance, in simple terms SAI established his overtake as per the rules by being ahead into the corner & apex. He must therefore be given sufficient room to complete the manoeuvre safely & within track limits. That room is entirely at the discretion of SAI to give or not give. SAI chose not to give room, BEA biffed him and was duly punished. It’s kinda perfect. BEA could’ve withdrawn earlier, concede and not receive punishment; SAI could’ve given more space and the two navigate that corner somewhat alongside each other instead of ruining each others progression - They didn’t. It requires you to know who you are racing and exercise some smarts.', ""Shout out to my favourite quote from the article, Jon Nobles suggestion:\n\n>A small part of me would love F1 to have no racing rules at all, and leave drivers to sort things out amongst themselves.\n\n>If anyone got pushed off wide or spun out in a race, they could take it up with their rival in the paddock afterwards - or exact their revenge at the following event.\n\nIn general for me the rules are just too strictly applied. I think there should be at least a clear marker for when another car needs to leave space. I don't mind the 'far enough alongside' guideline. I just think a bit more common sense should be applied rather than making the rule black and white. For me an attacker should always make sure the defender gets enough space to stay on track. The defender should get a bit more leeway. They can't always leave space, depending on what the attacker is doing. \n\nI also agree with Glenn Freeman that the stewards need to make more use of racing incidents. Not every collision is only because of one party.""]",0,66,0.47,0,54,54,0,0,0.009999999999999953,0
