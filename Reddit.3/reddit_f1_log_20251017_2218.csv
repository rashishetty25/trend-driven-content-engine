1o8vy58,A warning about ticket prices and r/GrandPrixTravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o8vy58/a_warning_about_ticket_prices_and_rgrandprixtravel/,2025-10-17, Moderator Response,"Posting here because this is all about the mod of r/GrandPrixTravel and the kickbacks from a site called P1 Travel.  The sub is generally quite helpful but has a rule that any reselling of tickets at excessive prices will be removed.  And the mod, the single mod is always posting referral links (which he gets money for) to P1 Travel. The issue is the prices P1 Travel askes.  Lets take Suzuka which is on sale now:

B1 stand, officially 63,000yen turns into 132,000yen on P1... More than double. Then looking at the C stand + hotel package. It comes to 852.90¬†Euro going by the Japanese prices for everything you get, but the price is **‚Ç¨2,084** on P1 Travel**.**  More than a 2x price increase certainly seems excessive and into scalper territory for me. 

The biggest issue I have with this is sometimes I see people recommending to buy tickets from that site over official sales sites.  Pay double.. why? 

Before paying anything to any site, check official pricing first and ask yourself if you want to pay such a markup. And on seeing links anywhere on social media, check if they are paid links and then ask if the info you are getting is unbiased. ","['Thanks for bringing up this issue. We (r/formula1) used to redirect ticket and travel related questions to r/GrandPrixTravel. This was added after the mod of GrandPrixTravel suggested this in 2021 via ModMail\n\nIn February of 2025 we noticed that GrandPrixTravel has been **seemingly** monetized. They were stating that P1 Travel is a ""*community verified ticket vendor*"" of GrandPrixTravel and their subreddit was full of what appeared to be affiliate links for P1 Travel. We found these links in the following places on /r/GrandPrixTravel:\n\n* In the sidebar\n* At the top of their wiki page for official circuit websites\n* At the top of their monthly buy/sell threads\n* In standalone mod-made posts\n* In AutoModerator comments triggered by certain keywords\n\nSome of these links were paired with messages pointing out that some other ticket websites are not fully reliable. In addition we also noticed heavy promotion of FanAmp, an app.\n\nWhen we became aware of all of this in February **we stopped the r/formula1 AutoModerator from redirecting users with ticket & travel related questions to r/GrandPrixTravel and removed links to that subreddit from our sidebar.**\n\nWhile GrandPrixTravel can be a useful resource we considered that it would not be appropriate to continue recommending it given these issues, especially since [Reddit\'s Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct) clearly prohibits *""moderation actions (including actions taken using mod tools, bots, and other services) in exchange for any form of compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from or on behalf of third parties""*\n\nEdit: And obviously the r/formula1 mod team is in no way affiliated with the /r/GrandPrixTravel mod team', 'I made it to my personal mission to downvote that stupid mod every time I see it and the ‚Äúhi here is X from P1travel‚Äù comments (this seemed to have stopped showing up)\n\nI will always recommend that people buy from the race tracks and only from the race tracks maybe F1 if they are desperate but the resellers are a no go imo‚Ä¶', ""The question is, why hasn't somebody reported the subreddit for violating [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct), if this behavior has been occurring for awhile now.

I had a 79 min queue before I even had the option to find a seat. \n\nI went 3rd party to guarantee the seats I wanted. P1, F1, and others are all resellers and mark up tickets. It‚Äôs well known. \n\nLook at Suzuka now, everything except West Area is sold out.', 'I was wondering why the mod commented that on all the posts, makes sense..', 'The posts that I\'ve seen do always acknowledge that prices are higher than ""direct from circuit"". I guess it\'s a fine line, if there are no tickets left for ""general"" purchase, do you recommend a company that you are willing to put your name to, or let people amble off into the wild west of touts and scams.\n\nI do feel that if there\'s any recompense, or paid for promotion then it should be declared, but I think the ticket prices have always been made very clear in the posts, and the general line across the sub has always been ""go direct"" as a first port of call, so it\'s not a wholly uninformed choice if people use them as an alternative.', 'Can‚Äôt blame the guy for trying to make some money, but there may be a better way to go about it\xa0', ""Yeah, you can't really compare the circuit prices (which don't exist now) with reseller prices.\n\nIt would be better to look at other resellers - f1.com (which is also just a reseller) has them at 455 euros, with p1 coming in at 754 euros - so while not double it is a lot more.\n\nI think rather than saying go to p1 travel, any automod replies should say avoid sites with issues, such as viagogo and to an extent stubhub (yes it is often fine but a lot of people have had ticket issues with them).\n\nWhen I booked Suzuka last year I had to have multiple laptops open trying to get a good spot in the queue. Resellers are for people who don't want to or can't/haven't done that.\n\nFor some circuits, resellers may end up cheaper than dynamic pricing (looking at you Melbourne!) - I think we paid almost double face value from the circuit for Brabham tickets (my parents were coming over from the UK so we were prepared to pay that as we wanted to secure the tickets).""]",306,18,0.96,306,18,18,-2,0,0.0,-2

1o9d1td,Practice and sprints,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o9d1td/practice_and_sprints/,2025-10-17, Discussion,"On a normal race weekend, my understanding is teams use all 3 practice sessions to fine tune set up (with main details coming from the sim) and evaluate tyres.

Please will someone explain how teams get their data (apart from the sim) on weekends with a sprint race, with only 1 practice session? Or are the 2 extra sessions just an extra revenue stream? 

","[""You don't get the same amount of data during sprint weekends. You just have to get everything you can during the only free practice. So, it's packed with mini-race stints, hot laps and anything valuable in 1 hour. Some teams will use the sprint race as an extended practice session if they are trailing behind with no chances (points). That's another alternative to collect data and test a few things before qualy and race."", ""They simply don't get as much data as they would in a normal weekend. Adding to that the only FP session is in the morning (or at least in the earliest hours of the two session slots), so it's not even the closest of the situation of qualifying and race.\n\nThey have to squeeze everything into 1 hour of practice (obviously not possible), some use the sprint as another data gathering session."", ""One of the many reasons (among the greater risks of car damage with minimal time for repair) that  lot of the teams and drivers aren't fans of the sprint concept.\n\nPain in the arse for everyone."", ""Which could just be better for unpredictability. 3 full sessions of practice and you more or less have all the long run data to know what's going to happen""]",0,4,0.23,0,4,4,0,4,0.23,0
1o9cxak,Do you think that Lewis being the second driver of Ferrari lowers Charles's chance at winning a wdc?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o9cxak/do_you_think_that_lewis_being_the_second_driver/,2025-10-17, Discussion,"I think that it's obvious that in some cases the teammate is the decider of the race winner or even the championship. a clear example being what checo did in the 2021 Abu Dhabi grand prix, holding Lewis back for max to catch up was a key role in the outcome of the race, and maybe -just maybe the result would have been different if not for checo. 

Now this being said, Carlos was a perfect example of the second driver. He was good, confident in his driving, but also willing to let Charles overtake, or hold someone back for him even when it cost him a position, he knew that, even when he is very good, he wasn't the main driver, he wasn't the project. And as harsh as this maybe, I think it made the dynamic of the team work. Now Lewis on the other hand is a seven time world champion, in all measures he is a legend, and he won't hold back for anyone, It wouldn't even be fair to ask him to, neither will Charles, even if hadn't got the chance to prove it he's a top tier driver. This will result in a competition between drivers and we can't afford that, we are not McLaren where we have the best car and an utmost perfect team. And Charles isn't getting any younger and can't afford another vettel. So in the coming seasons even if Ferrari deliver a good car and fix there strategy, I think that it won't be enough for Charles to win. 


Ps: I am getting less and less confident in Charles getting the title he deserves. I mean by 2027 it's too late to change teams - and I don't even think he is willing to - if he changes teams now where will he go, will he get the attention and be prioritized enough, we'll he be able to adapt and start showing results soon enough. And the answer is I don't think so. As for staying in Ferrari, even if they solve the strategy and deliver a good car, will Lewis cooperate and help him, or be just another burden on his shoulder. I think there will be another tragic Daniel Riccardo.
