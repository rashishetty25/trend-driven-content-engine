The 2024 Formula 1 Dutch Grand Prix, held in 2024, saw Lando Norris of McLaren take a dominant victory, ending Max Verstappen's three-race winning streak at his home Grand Prix. 

This race, held in 2023, was marked by unpredictable and dramatic rain showers that impacted the strategy and outcome. Max Verstappen emerged victorious, equaling Sebastian Vettel's record of nine consecutive F1 wins.

I totally understand what he is saying from a team principal POV. You wanna make sure he gets deal sealed for future. Nothing wrong with that. But saying these things when your current drivers haven't given the confirmed seat next year with that contract shows that you're not confident about them. You are just talking about future. It also means that you are not trying to make your current driver WDC but waiting someone else who is WDC already to come in? There are hella lot of things could be put out of this situation Toto."", ""He's the best driver since Schumacher, of course Toto wants to sign him."", ""it's been a slow week at the rumor mill i see"", 'And why would Verstappen want to sign with Mercedes?\n\nAt this point, it is pretty clear that Wolff wants to sign Verstappen to sate his own ego. He has been so pre-occupied with it that Mercedes have completely fumbled their handling of Kimi Antonelli. The team have no clear way to deal with him and his career could be on the rocks if they cannot help him turn things around. To my mind, that indicates a team that is just as poisonous as Red Bull has been -- it is just a different venom. I have long thought that Toto Wolff missed the point of *Drive to Survive* and started to believe the hype when he was cast as a hero when he was really just a foil to Christian Horner.']",112,50,0.82,112,41,41,64,24,0.0,64
