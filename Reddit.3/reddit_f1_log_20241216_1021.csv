Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our¬†[guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our¬†[FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H√§kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.
