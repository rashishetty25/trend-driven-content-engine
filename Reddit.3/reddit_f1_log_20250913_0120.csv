1nf2lo9,"Please be respectful to the race organizers and understand why Verstappen's Porsche is ""detuned""",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nf2lo9/please_be_respectful_to_the_race_organizers_and/,2025-09-12, Discussion,"There are several publications, among which Motorsport.com, claiming Max Verstappen won't be able to win the GT4 class in the Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie tomorrow, because his Porsche is ""detuned"".

First, the NLS doesn't have a GT4 class. GT4-spec cars are split up into a bunch of different categories, like SP8T for turbocharged GT4-cars with specially designed parts (i.e. Bilstein suspension on Jimmy Broadbent's car) and SP10 for SRO-homologated GT4-cars (SRO is the licenceholder of GT4).

Verstappen's Porsche is entered in the CUP3 class, which is a separate class for detuned Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport cars. He is not competing against other GT4 cars. If his Porsche were not detuned, it wouldn't be a Permit B car and to get his Permit A ('GT3 licence'), he has to drive a Permit B car first.

Due to articles like Motorsport.com wrote, there have been several hate comments directed towards the NLS organizers, because Verstappen fans think his Porsche is nerfed to slow him down and what not and that it's unfair. Please be respectful and do your research.","['Half the argument on here are between folks who don’t understand F1 rules. You want us to understand multi-classes?', 'I’m just glad the GT4 class is getting some love.\n\nSince you’re correcting bad “nerf” takes, can we call you a nerf herder?', 'Man, it would genuinely never strike me to get *angry* with the organizing body of another motorsport class that a particular driver has *chosen* to join, because I think it might not be showing his ""utter domination"" properly. Jeepers.', "">First, the NLS doesn't have a GT4 class.

There is a SRO GT4 class, which is SP10, no other class is properly GT4.\n\nSP8T is for race cars with a turbocharged engines between 2.6L and 4L, which include non-homologated GT4 cars.\n\nCUP3 is for Porsche Cayman GT4 Trophy cars, which as you put it is separate, and doesn't use cars homologated for SRO GT4.\n\nAlso, theorically, there could be GT4 in other categories, with for example the A110 GT4(+) could be entered in the SP3T category with its 1.8L engine."", 'Not surprising at all. A lot of so-called motorsport fans don’t really know much.

Everyone wants a F1 (or whatever series) champion to show up and compete in their event. There is zero reason for them to hurt that person\'s chances. ""Come watch Max compete for 9th!"" is not what they want on their marketing. I would entertain a conspiracy that they over-tuned his car a million times easier than that they hurt his chances on purpose. And I wouldn\'t get that the time of day either. \n\nPeople are so quick to anger. Not asking ""Why is the car detuned? Oh, that\'s just how the category works? Ok,"" and instead jumping straight to ""They don\'t want the object of my parasocial relationship to succeed!

The annual **Goodwood Revival** event has kicked off earlier today, and as per usual it features various retro era F1 machinery as well as numerous notable names from the sport. As such, I wanted to make a sort of PSA post, similar to the one I've made a few months back for the Festival of Speed, so people around here are made aware of the Revival and tune in for some nice classic racing

For those of you new to Goodwood - it's a large-scale event held in Chichester, England that covers all things ""speed"", hence the name of the *main* attraction, the Festival of Speed, dating back to the late 1990s. Over the years Goodwood has expanded beyond the scope of the FOS to two additional events: the Members Meeting, consisting primarily of the Goodwood Racing Club members gathering to drive cars, both fast and slow, new and old, and the Revival, dedicated to decades long gone, invoking the first half of the 20th Century, and this post is covering precisely that.

Unlike the FOS however you won't be seeing *all* kinds of F1 cars, instead giving the spotlight to vehicles ranging from pre-war Bathtubs on Wheels and up to the 1960s, but the action is still very much worth watching into even if you're not a petrolhead and check out F1 on occasion.

Here's how the scheduling for this year's Revival looks F1-wise:

Event Name | Main Theme | Featured Cars | Date & Time
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
**Goodwood Trophy** | Celebrating the post-war grids that lined up during the early years of the Motor Circuit in the late 1940s and early ‘50s, bringing together some of the oldest cars at the Revival | Grand Prix and Voiturette cars from 1930 to all the way to 1951, with an entry list that includes ERAs, Maseratis and Alfa Romeos that pre-date the F1 World Championship | Practice on Sept 12th @ 12:05 UTC // Race on Sept 13th @ 09:35 UTC
**Richmond & Gordon Trophy** | Bringing back to life a golden era of Formula 1 racing, and resulting in a mixed grid of differing approaches to the business of Grand Prix racing | A selection of 2.5-litre Grand Prix cars that raced between 1952-60, with machines hailing from a variety of manufacturers, including but not limited to the heavier Maserati 250Fs and Ferrari 246s, racing against the forward-thinking BRMs and Lotuses | Practice on Sept 12th @ 15:45 // Race on Sept 14th @ 17:10 UTC
**Glover Trophy** | Celebrating the proud history of Formula 1 racing at the Goodwood Motor Circuit, and a tribute to one of F1’s most popular non-Championship races with a grid evoking one of the most romantic eras of the sport. | A grid of 1.5-litre Grand Prix cars that raced between 1961-’65, such as the Lotus 25, as well as Cooper, BRM and Ferrari vehicles all making their mark on track | Practice on Sept 12th @ 16:50 UTC // Race on Sept 14th @ 15:55 UTC

For the full timetable, you can visit [this link](https://www.goodwood.com/motorsport/goodwood-revival/plan-your-day/timetable/), and the official broadcasts can be accessed via YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd_wMcXJiGw)

Also, keep in mind that the livestream will be running all weekend-long, with a full replay of each day starting immedaitely as soon as the live coverage concludes, while the VODs for Days 1-3 will be uploaded separately on Goodwood channel at a later date (usually around 10-14 days after)

Of course the Revival itself isn't limited to *just* Formula 1, and in fact there's much more to check out from the same time periods but different racing series. Again, refer to the full timetable if you're interested

1neyppe,Our verdict on F1's broken racing rules and how to fix them - The Race,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1neyppe/our_verdict_on_f1s_broken_racing_rules_and_how_to/,2025-09-12, Discussion,"Don't know if I really needed to add that this was from the race after the title included our verdict but oh well. 

I mostly wanted to post this to encourage some discussion about what would work best for F1 in terms of rules/racing guidelines. We're never going to get to a consensus but it's a fun discussion to be had. ","['I think it\'s also worth noting that stewards *should* be looking at the incidents themselves and not the consequences of said incident. Which is very tough to do.\n\nIf you take consequence into action then a small bump, like let\'s say between Vettel and Leclerc in Brazil 2019, would be penalized heavier than someone spinning the other around where both can continue (Vettel and Verstappen 2018 for example). One being a racing incident and the other with a more obvious ""agressor"". \n\nBut if you don\'t take the consequence in action there will be situations where not everyone will be happy with the outcome because they feel it is either too light or too harsh of a punishment. I could name one in particular but I think most people have one in mind. \n\nAnd that\'s just one part of the decision making. Also if you leave it up to the drivers you\'ll just end up with situations where they\'ll just risk the penalty and be fine with it because they\'ll make up for it. That\'s not the way to go, it also will be inconsistent as hell.', 'My view is very simple: corner ownership is not real. If a car is meaningfully alongside, give space. The way people get a ""right"" to run others off is what has caused every other flashpoint this year.', 'The Drivers have pushed for stupid, stupid rules.\n\nOne lesson to take from this is don\'t let the drivers decide how the rules are implemented. It\'s like letting the inmates run the asylum.\n\nThe rules should be very simple and be what these guys have grown up being expected to do in junior racing:\n\n* If a car manages to get significant overlap they have to be given at least a car\'s width to the track edge\n* Signficant overlap could be defined in many ways but I would say at least front wheel ahead of rear wheel\n* No one can ever ""own"" a corner, any car alongside must be given space\n\nThis is how Leclerc raced Piastri and it resulted in a fantastic overtake, letter of the law, Leclerc was free to basically shove him out the way.\n\nMy proposed rules give more leeway to attackers to be confident they won\'t be taken out but makes defending still possible if done well, it would allow more multi-corner battling as cars would remain side by side without the current threat of being shoved off if the other driver claims the corner.', ""Great read, thanks for the share. There's also a podcast featuring Mark, Josh and Edd from earlier this week which covers this topic.\n\nAs they mention in the article and the podcast, the drivers are the ones that have pushed for this. The issue is that written wording can never cover the vast array of racing scenarios.\n\nMark said on the podcast earlier this week, 'the stewards aren't inconsistent, the racing incidents are', but each incident is compared against a checklist that the stewards are being forced to use.\n\nSainz - Bearman was a good example of this. The rules as written didn't require Sainz to square off the corner, and because he's ticked the right boxes, the stewards are forced to give a penalty to Bearman."", 'I feel like we are having a very heavy Dunning-Kruger effect type of situation with this debate about the overtake rules', ""It's not just the rules, a big part is the enforcing of them, and it sucks for drivers and spectators.\n\nYou see an incident on track and you don't know if it's going to be a penalty or if it's not even going to be investigated at all, with Max and Norris turn 1, it was noted but who knows what they would have decided on, it clearly looked like Max was in the clear by the rules, but RBR either questioned the rules or did not trust how the stewards would enforce those rules."", 'The fix: less rules. \n\nLess written rules that is. A panel of judges is enough for it to be fair most of the time. And less whining from fans.', 'Take BEA/SAI for instance, in simple terms SAI established his overtake as per the rules by being ahead into the corner & apex. He must therefore be given sufficient room to complete the manoeuvre safely & within track limits. That room is entirely at the discretion of SAI to give or not give. SAI chose not to give room, BEA biffed him and was duly punished. It’s kinda perfect. BEA could’ve withdrawn earlier, concede and not receive punishment; SAI could’ve given more space and the two navigate that corner somewhat alongside each other instead of ruining each others progression - They didn’t. It requires you to know who you are racing and exercise some smarts.', 'IMO the broken racing rule is allowing mechanics to work on cars during red flags. If the race is suspended, the race is suspended, including repairs, tire changes, etc. Parc fermé conditions until cars go back on track.']",0,75,0.44,0,218,218,0,2,0.0,0
