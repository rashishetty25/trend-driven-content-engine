1n0gwl2,"Looking at mid-season ratings, do you still think that results from 2024 F2 are not representative of rookies performance?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n0gwl2/looking_at_midseason_ratings_do_you_still_think/,2025-08-26, Discussion,"I will preface by saying that I know it has been just 14 races and things could change in the future. At the same time however, it is enough to draw some conslusions.

In 2024 there were many discussions about how we shouldn't look to much into 2024 F2 results. This notion applied almost exclusively  to Prema, because both of its overhyped drivers had underwhelming rusults. (in comparison to expactations). Also both of their drivers were set to join F1 basically from the beginning of that year. So it seemed easier to blame the team than to acknowledge that the Prema boys might have been underperformimg. Meanwhile rookies like Bortoleto and Hadjar were barely talked about. 

As for now, after 14 races it seems that the F2 2024 standings generally reflect the order, in which rookies are rated on F1 grid. Moreover I still kinda don't understand, how some people are surprised that Bortoleto (literally F3 and F2 back to back champion) is doing that well. ","[""Your first mistake is assuming that people know Bortoleto was a back to back champion. Most people watching F1 turn the TV on just before the race starts, and maybe just before qualifying starts and that's it, and that extends to people posting on here"", ""I do think people really underestimate how representative F2 can be, especially last year. In general because it was a new car we didnt really have a best team, some teams figured out the car quicker but it was peaky from many. So that aspect did make it hard to truly understand the order, though I think people did over blow it just because the pre-season favourites in Kimi and Bearman struggled.\n\nI think generally the top drivers in any given season are the top drivers for a reason. Many can say its car and team setup, but you still need to be good enough to make sure you maximise that chance. This is the same in every category, its naive to think everywhere is completely equal. For sure that can make it easy to dismiss certain results, but its unfair to really downplay a driver when they are performing in my opinion.\n\nWhat Hadjar and Bortoleto have shown this season is there's a good reason why they were the ones that fought for the title. So yeah, I do think it adds some weight to the championship when they are performing."", 'It’s way too soon to say. I think you can’t really judge the quality of a F2 grid until 5 years later when you see what they all went to achieve elsewhere. \n\nHadjar is actually a good example of F2 results not always being representative of talent. He finished P14 in his rookie F2 season behind his teammate who was also a rookie. At the time many people questioned why Red Bull didn’t drop him, especially since his teammate was also a RB driver and he did get dropped. He changes teams and there’s a new car and suddenly he challenges for the title. Now he’s doing a great job in F1 and those same people who questioned him are now applauding him.\n\nOllie and Kimi were also not the only favourites underperforming last year. Victor Martins was a F3 champion and had a good rookie year, yet last year he was absolutely nowhere. Taylor Barnard was highly rated and yet got comprehensively beaten by his teammate who people didn’t rate that highly. He left to go do FE and did an amazing job there.\n\nSo the flaws of the F2 championship were somewhat exaggerated last year because favourites weren’t doing well, but that doesn’t mean those flaws don’t exist. The truth is that there is no objective way to judge junior drivers against each other, so it often comes down to right place right time. I don’t think any of the rookies are drowning right now, so I don’t think there are any that shouldn’t be there. Of course you can question how someone else would be doing in their shoes, but those what-ifs have always been there and will always be there.', 'look at how the status of the 2018 F2 title challengers in during the mid season break in 2019\n\nF2 champion Russell: languishing in the back in a Williams\n\nF2 Runner up Norris: showing strong potential in a Mclaren against Carlos Sainz\n\nF2 3rd place Albon: Promoted to Red Bull Racing\n\nmaybe its still too early to know, all three drivers have done well but the pecking order between them is more clear now 5 years later', ""Watching f2 last year, it was so clear to me that Bortoleto was the best driver. Kimi might have more potential because tbh, I don't know how to judge that without access to data etc, but Bortoleto was definitely the stand out. \n\nI'm ready for that audi to be good next year"", ""Oh absolutely, I've been saying that the entire season as well, how well the previous F2 season reflects the rookies current form."", ""My biggest surprise is that Hadjar is nowhere near as hot-headed on the radio as he was in F2. I thought that was his biggest weakness but he seems to have matured very quickly.\n\nBortoleto flew under the radar at the beginning of the season because the car was bad and he had a natural learning curve for a rookie, similar to Leclerc in his first season. But I always expected him to do great sooner or later.\n\nKimi's performance drop off is not typical for a rookie but he is very young and rose very quickly through the ranks. I think he just needs time and maybe it would have been easier for him to develop in a second season in F2.\n\nI thought Bearman was very solid in F3 and F2 but not spectacular. His performance in the Ferrari made people raise their eyebrows and he can probably be a race winner in a top team but not a world champion.\n\nColapinto and Lawson have been disappointing compared to last year, they might just not be as adaptable to the cars they have been driving this year. Or maybe they don't get as much support from their teams as their teammates, hard to tell.\n\nOverall I'm not that surprised. F1 media always has a very short memory and hype levels ebb and flow constantly. Sometimes that's justified but most of the time they need to create stories that make people click on their articles and videos."", 'Antonelli sadly  is driving exactly like in F2, incredible inconsistent.', ""It's almost like consistently winning in the junior categories actually does predict future success in F1.""]",61,42,0.85,61,36,36,29,23,0.010000000000000009,29

But I loved the strategies based on fuel. Light, slower cars could challenge heavy, better cars. More pit stops. More possibilities of mistake, but also unexpected advantage.

There were some accidents in the past but I’m sure it can be made safer and with possible electric direction. It should be safer I assume?

What do you think?","[""The big argument against refuelling isn't safety - though that certainly is an argument - it's that it kills the racing.
