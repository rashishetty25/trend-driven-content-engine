I spent two great seasons with him and I thank him,' said Vasseur.

Even when we encountered difficulties in July, the team’s reaction was very good . We never blamed anyone or a department but we worked together to find solutions between the different groups and it certainly went well.” – Vasseur told the press present at the Christmas lunch in Maranello, including AutoRacer – “Of course, it would have been better not to have had problems, but I think the reaction was good and that is what we expect for the future if we want to fight for the championship.” \n\n\nAfter a period of great understanding, where Charles Leclerc was often sacrificed to collect useful data later in the factory in those analyses of unforeseen problems introduced with the package brought to Spain, the SF-24 is back competitive. ""I was very proud of the team\'s reaction this year, because a positive point of our season for me is when we struggled between the end of June and the beginning of July and we were able to react quickly, then showing good pace both in the race in Budapest and Spa."" Vasseur said. Let us remember that in Hungary what the French TP called \'evolved bottom\' had debuted, with the first artificial corrections made thanks to CFD analysis and without spending hours in the tunnel , to correct part of the problems encountered with the Montmelò package. ""This type of reaction will be fundamental for next year. It is true that now when you develop the car, sometimes you also take some risks by introducing updates, and it is something that has affected everyone, but it is the way you react in this situation that becomes fundamental, also for next year,” concluded Vasseur.\n\n\nFerrari Surprise: Vasseur Announces Less Than 1% of SF-24 Components Ported to 2025 Car\n\n\nThe Italian team has high expectations for the 2025 car because, as already underlined several times, it has invested a lot of technical resources , setting up a completely new project that sees changes in all the macro areas of the single-seater: from the chassis, therefore to the position of the driver and the engine, to the mechanics as well as the aerodynamic surfaces . “We are in the fourth year of application of this regulation and we know our previous project very well. For this reason the 2025 car will be completely new , ” announced Fred Vasseur during the Christmas lunch in Maranello .\n\n\nA calculated risk according to the team principal of the Italian team, even if with the current regulation “sometimes you have the feeling of not running any risks but then on the track you realize that there really were”. There will be important changes to the front , with the suspension that will become a pull-rod design, following the philosophy already used by McLaren and Red Bull. Linked to the important mechanical steps forward, the aerodynamic surfaces of the floor have also undergone a strong restyling since, as understood by AutoRacer , it will be quite different compared to the first spec 25 iteration seen on the track starting from Las Vegas s . Surprisingly, compared to the car that won 5 of the 24 races during the season just ended, 99% of the parts will change, given that Vasseur stated that the 2025 Ferrari will share “less than 1 percent of the current car”, for what is in effect a truly different project designed to try to win at least one of the two world championships available.', ""The rules from 2024 to 2025 are as stable as they get in F1, and literally everything will change for 2026, so redesigning the entire car for what will be the final year will either end up being an amazing hail mary to get Lewis or Charles a(nother) championship, or it'll fail spectacularly. There's almost no in-between."", 'Oh god no.']",1586,259,0.98,1586,9055,9055,23,4,-0.010000000000000009,23

Before like 2014-16 no one cared about throwing a rookie into a top car. Then Hamilton and Rosberg happened and Red Bull started this driver program epidemic and all of a sudden there was this barrier of “we want an experienced driver in the top car and can use our junior team or a team we have a connection with to foster talent” (George at Williams, Leclerc at Alfa). But now I think they just don’t care anymore or see less value in having an established 1 driver with a steady 2nd that won’t challenge them. Red Bull lost all their good assets while Perez and Ricciardo were there. They’re in the rebuild of their young driver program kind of. Yuki clearly has a glass ceiling. Max is max. So you have two seats to fill that were blocked by old slow guys. Throw the young kids in there and see what happens. Same thing with Antonelli at Mercedes.

Honda decided to quit F1 but popped up moments later to say they’re coming back with Aston Martin in ‘26 when new engine regulations come in. That for sure pissed off people at Redbull given how money and politically charged F1 decision making is. Yuki has been improving year after year for his 4 years on the grid but they say Liam came and did cumulatively a better job in a much shorter period of time (11 races?). We won’t ever know what other factors were considered but given the politics and money of F1 decision making, it certainly had to have played a non negligible factor. It’s also worth noting that Yuki is an alumni of Honda racing but he’s not managed by Honda anymore so he has the ability to look around- but also he doesn’t come with a ton of sponsor backing so he’s limited in his ability to buy into a seat so I’m sure Honda provides some form of financial support.', 'tsunoda is a honda backed driver, even a honda junior if i remember correctly.\n\nthere are many rumors around why it went like that. my subjective take on that is (and you will never read facts about that sadly) that red bull are pissed off by honda because of their recent in-and-out-of-f1-mentality which ended up for red bull to set up their own power train factory (humongus financial investment) just to watch honda a few months later announcing they rejoin f1 with aston martin.\nand since yuki was brought to RB by honda thats their way of payback.\nas i said thats my take on that by witnessing what happened over the recent years']",0,2,0.44,0,2,2,0,2,0.44,0

1hhqxz6,Why do people seem to think Yuki's Honda links matter in the RBR driver choice? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhqxz6/why_do_people_seem_to_think_yukis_honda_links/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"I have seen this argument countless times, and quite frankly it makes no sense. Yes, he is a Honda driver. So? Does anyone seriously think he would bail to Aston Martin at the first moment if he was given the chance while in a way more competitive seat? And that's besides the point anyway, as Stroll's long enduring protest of ""occupy the second AM seat"" means that Yuki would not even be considered before Alonso retires, at which point Stroll Sr. would simply shell out for someone like Sainz or Russell, who are simply better than Yuki anyway.

My point is that all these arguments about Honda links tying down Yuki are unfounded hogwash used to justify not hiring the better VCARB driver. And make no mistake, Yuki is better than Lawson, but whatever myopic bean counting faction in Red Bull management does not want him there, irrespective of any engine manufacturer. I believe it was Takuma Sato who said something very recently about only being able to hope now in respect to RBR's driver choice. This is a guy who has an executive advisor role at HRC; they do not give a fuck about tying Yuki down for no reason, in fact, they would be thrilled for him to get the opportunity at the main team.

So can we at least stop pretending, and recognize that Honda links have fuck all to do with the driver choice, but it's simply that management, for whatever reason, hates Yuki despite him outperforming every teammate since Gasly?","['So they just hate Yuki ""for some reason"" but the Honda scenario is complete gobblygook according to you? Thanks. That really clears things up.', 'I don\'t think anyone is insinuating that Yuki is ""tied down"", but instead they don\'t have interest in him outside of the Honda affiliation/obligations.', ""Yuki has BARELY outperformed Liam while having 8x the experience in F1. So yeah, let's not pretend that Yuki is clearly better than Liam. In my opinion Liam has showed much more potential in his 11 races so far than Yuki did in his rookie year. Also Liam showed this season that he is not afraid to get his hands dirty on the track and seems (at least so far) mentally resilient enough to handle the heat at RedBull. Maybe he isn't but i would pick him over Yuki in that regard.\n\nI don't get this Yuki hype currently. He just hasn't showed that much potential in his career so far. He is a fine driver and good enough for VCARB and maybe as a second driver at Aston (as long as Stroll retires) in the future but he is definitely not the next Max Verstappen. Of course Liam isn't either but he at least has that x-factor to be a good second RB driver. Yuki is going into his fifth season and hasnt really made a name for himself in regards to work ethic and resilience.

1hhpb3x,the Yuki bias?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhpb3x/the_yuki_bias/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"I don't get all the Yuki love. I mean sure he's lovable but is that enough to get the RB seat? Feels more like a train everyone had boarded, logic be darned. Not saying he's a bad driver or that he doesn't deserve the seat, as he did his time but Lawson just makes way more sense.

Trial by fire because the grid in 2025 is going to be tight. That's the RBR way, feels like a return to old ways. Lawson is going to have to be up to the task, swim or sink. If he swims they'll have a good partnership for 2026. If he sinks, they'll get another, more experienced driver off the market for 2026.

Also Yuki's contract has one more year on it, Honda and their weird decision (again) to leave F1 hurt Yuki more than anything. Getting Yuki, they'd have to get a fresh driver for 2026, an year of unknowns. Better to have someone next to Max that has had some lashes of the whip that is going to be 2025. If Honda had stayed and got on the RBRPT project, 100% Yuki would have gotten the seat.

Having said that and Honda going to Stroll. Yuki in an AM vs Lawson in RBR in 2026 is going to be spicy.","['I mean we’re saying ‘trial by fire’ but that didn’t work for Gasly or for Albon then they went with the experienced driver and that worked for multiple years before going downhill. Other than Max it’s just not worked and do we think Liam is another Max? Even Max had a full year at Toro Rosso with some mega performances which showed everyone that he was something special. \n\nI think the frustration is that Yuki has always shown he’s quick but he had to tone down his temper and become more consistent which he’s shown to have done. Other than the one incident at the beginning of the year he’s remained calm and consistent since. He’s also consistently outperformed every teammate he’s had. I think people are frustrated about this in the same way they were frustrated at Checo’s poor performance being allowed to go on so long.\n\nI hope Liam does well but I also hope Yuki can get out of the RB circus and get a chance to shine.', ""Truth is that no one 'deserves' a seat in f1. There will always be factors outside that play a role in who gets the seat. Tsunoda is a pretty good driver, but he isn't what RBR want"", 'I mean I think one of the biggest arguments is that because Yuki would be out 2026, there’s no harm in putting him in for 2025. If he sucks then they can drop him anyways. And having Liam in vcarb gives him more time and experience to develop as a driver without the harm of having max as your teammate. It was a win win.', 'There are much more nuisances in this situation than what Yuki deserves and what Lawson does not deserve.\n\nOn Lawson, is he a good drive with more potential? Yes. Is he an immediate WDC contender that can challenge Max? We can quite confidently say no. Not able to beat an experienced driver like Yuki does not mean he is bad, but it proves he doesn’t show his potential yet. For this type of driver, there is no rush to promote him, and giving him time to develop in the junior team is the best scenario to shape him into a reliable rear gunner. Why can’t he do that in RBR? To my opinion, RBR is not really a team for development. Their patience is thin, and they expect him to perform immediately, in a car that in 2024 even Max said sometimes it is not easy to drive. The constant pressure to a driver who only drove 11 races is a lot. Lawson could navigate it very well, and that means he will be with Max long term. If it doesn’t go well, RBR WCC position takes another hit with only one driver delivering for the team again. Fast tracking Lawson could setback his career development.\n\nDo I support RBR to promote Yuki because he deserves it? No. Do I expect he would be competitive against Max? No. Do I think he could contribute more than Lawson in the immediate term? To some extent, Yes. Yuki is objectively more ready to take the RBR seat within the RB stable, given his performance and also experience, and also let Lawson to develop more. If he is really really good, RBR can keep him until they see the next Max regardless of the Honda deal. Honda was clear thst they will support Yuki even he is not driving with their engines. If he is not good, RBR wants to sack him anyway, there are no harms.\n\nThe only reason for RBR to pick Lawson over Yuki now is if they think Lawson will perform better immediately in 2025 alongside Max which I am not convinced. I am more inclined to say RBR wants to burn through their Junior drivers until they have Linblad ready to drive for RBR. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.', 'Its not ""Yuki Bias""... \n\nI saw it the other way, It is more like Tsunoda ""hate"" are more strange because people stuck in the past...

Liam Lawson was the obvious choice surely? Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he’s probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026 following either Alonso’s retirement or then finally dropping Stroll. I know he’s had a large majority of his career with the RB family but he’s only there thanks to Honda supplying the engine.

Knowing this, Red Bull don’t want someone who’ll be there for a year then leave, they want someone young to potentially be Verstappen’s successor (Ricciardo to Vettel).

With Hadjar most likely getting the vacant VCARB spot, if Lawson pulls a Gasly, I can see RB going for Hadjar instead of Tsunoda too. 

No shade on Yuki, on his day he can be amazing. I just don’t think Red Bull will want to waste time and money on a driver they know won’t be there next year.","['Alonso has a contract 2026 and stroll has an infinite contract, there is no space for him at Aston?!', '> Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he’s probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026\n\nWell, no, because why would he do that if he has a race-winning car?', ""The biggest reason is experience.
