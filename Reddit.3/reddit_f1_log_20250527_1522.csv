1kwoziz,Barcelona is not a bad circuit.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kwoziz/barcelona_is_not_a_bad_circuit/,2025-05-27, Discussion,"I have seen a lot of people on here and elsewhere commenting that the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix will likely not be great for overtaking and that this track is one of the most boring on the calendar. 

And that was right. Before they got rid of the last chicane. Since then it has actually been one of the very best tracks for overtaking. 

And in 2022 there were 50, the tenth highest total of the season. 

In 2023 there were 65 overtakes, the fifth highest total of the season.

And in 2024 there were 55 overtakes, the second highest tally of the whole season! 

And it's not slam dunk DRS overtakes either. The battles usually go right into the braking zone and last year Russell vs Norris even went through the whole of sector 1 and most of sector 2! That battle lasted over half a lap! https://youtu.be/6OpfnQFgvkw?si=WWkd6bLYIzYiCvsr

You can also defend but still have fun battles. A perfect example of this is Russell vs Verstappen in 2022 
https://youtu.be/XtT9tNfdAlM?si=1gvNKihBynCRMDqX

Furthermore there is fairly high tyrewear at this track and both 2023 and 2024 were two stoppers. 2022 was a three stopper. 

So I think we should be optimistic about this race because since the removal of that last chicane it has been a great circuit for racing!

What do you think?

What are the chances that it gets dropped from the calendar after that? Low, Somewhere in the between or extremely high?', 'How good do you reckon was the 1986 Williams? Would they have dominated the season with a Prost-Senna lineup?', 'Another year, and another round of ""Monaco is no longer fit for purpose"" press comments and articles. I don\'t understand the obsession with trying to force Monaco to be an orthodox F1 race, unless you magically shrink the cars down to F3/FE size, it simply won\'t be. \n\nWhat makes Monaco hard to master is that, the more you push, the closer you are to clipping the wall and ending your session. It\'s why Friday and Saturday are the \'action\' days for F1. At the end of this race, Oscar was closest to stacking it because he was the only one pushing to try and catch Max/Lando/Charlie. \n\nRather than try to make it a traditional race, why not try to add something more radical that keeps the drivers on the edge? \n\n* Minimum laptimes in the race. This is a standard for oval racing, where you must maintain a minimum speed, and we have it in F1 for quali. Whether you do it as a set limit based on practice times, or a percentage of the current fastest lap, have it so if you lap below a set pace then you\'re black flagged on safety grounds. This would stop the sandbagging that dogs the race. \n* A hot lap competition with Indy 500 quali rules and points down to 20th. Set a three hour block, and you can put your name in to be next on track to set a flying lap. You either join the back of the queue and can keep your existing time, or if you want to jump to the front you lose it. If you hit the barrier and damage your car, you lose your time. It\'d keep drivers pushing, which is where Monaco comes alive. \n* Make it a NASCAR stage race, bringing out the safety car and doing a standing restart after 25 and 50 laps. Add in a mandated green flag pitstop (that has to be taken after X laps) to stop people just changing rubber under caution. Close the field back up. \n\nMonaco is not a normal grand prix track, and so I don\'t know why we want it to host a normal grand prix in the modern era. It\'s not going away, too much money comes into the sport at Monaco, and too much herritage is tied up in it.', 'Hey, did *the-race* remove all their podcasts from YouTube and move it behind their Patreon?', 'Fuck it, they should do a race in the snow.
