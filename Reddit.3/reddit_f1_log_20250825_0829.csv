1myxb5g,Surprises from rewatching 2010-2012,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1myxb5g/surprises_from_rewatching_20102012/,2025-08-24, Discussion,"Over the summer break I set out to re-watch the 2010-2012 seasons, and a bunch of things surprised me. In no particular order:

* Most drivers survived a race with Kobayashi, Petrov, Maldonado, and Grosjean on the grid
* The Michael still had it. That pole lap in Monaco was stunning. I don't remember him being that cursed; when the car wasn't committing seppuku he drove the wheels off it -- and, yes, occasionally into other people
* Nico in the fluoro yellow helmet and gloves in the Mercedes was bizarre. I kept thinking it was Lewis
* Bruno Senna was not terrible
* Kubica was legit fast in that ~~Sauber~~ Renault
* Perez was legit fast in that Sauber
* The 2010 championship was decided in the last race (I have NO IDEA how I forgot that)
* Alonso lost 2010 because of Ferrari strategy and didn't badmouth them afterwards
* Charles Pic existed
* Jenson Button was so, so good in 2011
* Baby Bono was skinny!
* Rob Smedley was a total stud
* Hamilton and Massa really did crash that often in 2011
* Ron Dennis looked happy several times
* Seb wasn't nearly as big a jerk (he was sassy, but this time it seemed in a fun way). Multi-21 was a bigger outlier than I remembered
* Jenson Button, Mark Webber, Jonathan Wheatley, Martin Whitmarsh, and Adrian Newey all look  the same today
* THAT podium of World Champions all engineered by Andrea Stella goes even harder
* The stewards handed out grid drops and drive-throughs like candy (although it did not deter Kobayashi, Petrov, Maldonado, or Grosjean)
* Engines exploded randomly all the time, not just the Renaults
* The engines really did sound better

When they race and dont wreck the racing is good and its actually nice to see. A big part of that here is when people got loose they didnt just turn the field they shuffled back in that last run.
