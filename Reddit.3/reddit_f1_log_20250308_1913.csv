A lot of talented drivers have shifted further back in the grid. I'd like to hear opinions on how you rank these teams going into the season. I have them like this..

6. Williams
7. Alpine
8. VCARB
9. Haas
10. Sauber

I think Williams takes a step forward on driver talent alone. Last year was a disappointment for them, but I really feel Sargeant dragged the whole team down. Alpine and VCARB had good momentum, their success will rely heavily on if their new drivers can perform at this level. Haas I just don't believe in and Sauber I see mailing it in as next year is the year.. but Hulk scoring some points and getting them to a few Q3s is entirely possible.

I wouldn't rule out challenging Aston for 5th to be honest (though I don't expect AMR to drop further than 6th unless they have a particular difficult season). \n\nBehind that... I'd expect Williams and Haas to be fighting for 7th, and I'd give the edge to Williams largely on the driver lineup. They maybe be able to challenge for 6th but I'm not totally sold at this stage. \n\nVCARB could surprise but I'd say they're comfortably 9th, with Sauber propping up the bottom of the table in a distant 10th, barring a lucky race where they can profit from chaos and walk away with a healthy points haul while their rivals fail to capitalize (which I would think is very unlikely)."", ""I think it's very likely that we will see Haas out preform vcarb and Alpine"", ""I think Aston are further back than they have been, no longer clear 5th.

Behind those for 5/6 I'd say Haas and AM probably compete for 7/8 and then Racing Bulls in 9th and Sauber ofc 10th"", ""I mean back of the grid is easy, it's Sauber. 6-9 is up in the air, I'd say 5-9 even cause Aston might be closer to 9th than to 4th if the end of last season is anything to go by.

But alongside the seven-time world champion, the Scuderia also secured the services of Lo√Øc Serra as technical director chassis and, more quietly, J√©r√¥me d‚ÄôAmbrosio.

While his arrival didn‚Äôt create the same media frenzy, d‚ÄôAmbrosio is already making a significant impact behind the scenes.

# The Perfect Fit for Ferrari

Described by team principal Fred Vasseur as having¬†**‚Äúthe perfect profile‚Äù**, d‚ÄôAmbrosio took on the role of deputy team principal and head of the Ferrari Driver Academy in October 2023.

His experience in both racing and team management makes him an ideal lieutenant for Vasseur as Ferrari undergoes a transformation ahead of Hamilton‚Äôs arrival in 2025.

1j6jwwi,Reasons for Red bull performance drop?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j6jwwi/reasons_for_red_bull_performance_drop/,2025-03-08, Discussion,"It's clear from the pre-season testing that red bull aren't where they expect to be. 
Whilst pre-season testing isn't a reliable indicator of a team's performance of the coming season, its undeniable that red bull's performance has fallen off since mid 2024. 

My question is how can a team that was so dominant, winning all but 1 race in 2023, be where they are right now, without a change in regulations?

Red bull's internal issues aside (power struggle, hornergate, newey departure) how much of the performance drop can be attributed to reduction of development time & money from finishing 1st for several consecutive seasons + cost cap breach penalty (-10% wind tunnel time) + late grasp of the current regulations by competitors?

Every team had trouble at some point, Red Bull just got a headstart and their problems (which were already there) seemed insignificant in comparison... until the other teams cleaned up their acts and suddenly Red Bull's weaknesses are now huge. \n\nAlso, Max. Hes amazing and gets the maximum points their cars can get, but his tendency to be able to drive around a cars problems can be problematic. It was already the case in 2019/2020, when they realized Max's skills were making them see things wrongly, and they course corrected in 2021 with a much more stable car. The same thing seems to have happened again last year.\n\nIm sure the chaos in the team doesnt help, but I dont think its the main factor."", ""Convergence. Red Bull hit their development ceiling before everyone else. If they can gain a tenth of a second on their rivals today, that is a big gain.

The smallest gap is 0.285s faster (Italian GP), ballooning to 1.09s faster (Mexico) and 2.7s faster (COTA) neither of which occasions he got pole!\n\nWhat actually happened was that the competition caught and passed Red Bull, which creates the impression of Red Bull falling away. To give you an idea, Sainz went 1.287s faster YoY in Mexico, compared to Max's 1.09s improvement."", 'It\'s actually quite similar to the Honda situation with Marquez in MotoGP, they built a bike that only he could ride with his Natural style, then he got injured and they found themselves in a crap situation with a bike that nobody could ride,they probably went even more in that direction ,then when he came back (although with and injured arm) he also struggled because the bike got to a point where It was too extreme to ride at the limit , or else you would risk crashing, honda\'s issues were also other stuff and they have carried over to now, redbull found a faster fix with different setups that gave at least max a familiar feeling.\nOf course the driver here does count, no doubt , but you cannot win with a 15th Place car/bike, or even with a 6th Place car if we look at It that way, so i think a lot of It Is down to confidence and how easy Is It to drive, teams and media Say the ""they drive over problems""stuff also because It makes the driver look Better, while It May be in part true, It\'s not as easy as that', 'There is a difference between a drop in performance and a lack of improvement.
