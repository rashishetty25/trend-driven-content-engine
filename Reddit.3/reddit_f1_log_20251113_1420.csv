This article gives the supposed break down on 2025 drivers salaries, not including bonuses.

The article also goes on to mention what the constructors receive at he end of the season for their performance, I quote:

""F1 prize money: How much do teams earn in the Constructors' Championship?

The team that secures the highest position in the Constructors' Championship receives the largest share of prize money, and the team in 10th place receives the least.

McLaren is estimated to have [received approximately $161 million](https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/f1-prize-money-how-much-do-gp-teams-and-drivers-really-make/) – an estimated 14 per cent of the prize pool – for securing victory in the 2024 Constructors' Championship. 

Last-placed Sauber, meanwhile, took home $69 million.

Prize money constitutes just one aspect of revenue generation for the teams as significant income streams also stem from sponsorships, merchandise sales, and commercial partnerships.""

  
I would have thought that running an F1 team would have cost a lot more, do the money they receive through sponsorship take care of all expenses during the year, and the constructor prize money is seen as their bonus?","[""Sponsorship will be worth more than the prize pot, there is of course the cost cap in place which means I think that Williams was the only team last year that was loss making but that is really because of longer term investments, servicing debt etc...\n\n\nNext year the cost cap will be $215m though this doesn't include the 3 highest salaries and some other things teams like Haas have been very good at keeping costs down"", 'Found in [this article](https://www.blackbookmotorsport.com/news/f1-mercedes-profit-revenue-financial-results-2024-june-2025/):\n\n> Overall, revenue jumped 16 per cent to UK£636 million (US$866.2 million).\n\n> According to Mercedes, revenue from sponsorship and licensing accounted for over 60 per cent of the team’s income in 2024.
