1h4fws0,[Precedent] 10s Stop-and-Go is the standard penalty for ignoring double yellows during a race session {Since at least 2014},https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4fws0/precedent_10s_stopandgo_is_the_standard_penalty/,2024-12-01, Discussion,"I see a lot of people calling foul for the severity of the penalty applied to Norris. However, as precedent shows, it appears to be the standard penalty for ignoring double yellows during a race. I went through the penalty-points system database which covers the past 10 years, and found all three instances of a breach **during a race**.

* 2021 Austrian GP, Mazepin & Latifi handed penalty post-race, **10s Stop & Go**, which was translated into 30s added to their race time due to the penalty being post race. ([Source](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/mazepin-and-latifi-handed-post-race-penalties-for-failing-to-slow-under.6f8SGWq4WlOkeAdh3ff1T))
* 2017 Belgian GP: Raikkonnen handed **10s Stop & Go** for ignoring double yellows.([Source](https://www.racefans.net/2017/08/27/raikkonen-given-penalty-points-yellow-flag-error/))

These are all examples I could find of drivers ignoring double yellow flags during the race in the last 10 years. All drivers got the same penalty.  If anyone could find examples from before 2014, that would be interesting too.

At least this time, the stewards seem to have been consistent for once.","['Maybe the confusion comes from that it has happened more often during qualifying in recent years and with different penalties for qualifying', ""It's confusing to fans because the broadcast makes no distinction between single and double yellow.  It's just a yellow flag notification and what sector."", 'I actually thought the FIA were right in issuing strict penalties. Their only failure was the wing mirror being let out on the track for so long.\xa0', ""Yup. We haven't seen it in a race in a few years, only really during quali & practices, where it's a 3 place grid drop. And during VSCs and SCs it's a 5 second penalty."", ""Penalty today was fair and consistent\n\nI think the issue actually is that drivethrough and stop and go penalties aren't given often enough. They should be utilised much more for collisions when one driver is clearly at fault instead of standard 5/10s penalties. The only reason the penalty today seemed harsh at first is we basically never see stop and go penalties."", 'There have been very rare instances of ignoring double yellows that not everyone remembers the rules. But what surprised me was that the commentators overreacted to the penalty. Even after the race where they had time to cool down and do a bit of research before the post race presentation, they kept repeating how both the penalties were harsh and FIA has to be blamed.', ""Most people don't care to look details and nuances, they just want to be angry!\n\nThe other talking point of today's race was Lewis's penalty. A drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane seems harsh because they usually give 5-second penalties. But the significant factor in this case is that Lewis was 12.5 km/h over the speed limit, not the usual 0.1 km/h. And a drive-through penalty is the recommended penalty in regulations when you are that much above the speed limit.\n\nFor Lando's case as you said 10-second stop-and-go penalty is standard for not respecting double yellows in the race. I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact it was **DOUBLE** yellows not single. Again 10-second stop-and-go penalty is the recommended penalty in the regulation (Bernie Collins confirmed that in post-race) and as you said it's the penalty that has been given in all recent instances.\n\nEdit: I think the broadcast also plays a part in the misunderstanding, firstly they showed the wrong replay in the live broadcast and they just said yellows in the race, didn't say double yellows until post-race."", ""It's a safety issue and a very fair penalty imo, same with the pitlane one"", ""> If anyone could find examples from before 2014, that would be interesting too.\n\nAlonso got a drive through penalty in the 2003 Brazilian GP for overtaking under yellows. I think it was double-waved yellows, but can't find a reference to that right now. Later on in the same race, he crashed after ignoring double-waved yellows, the race was red-flagged, and he did not receive a penalty for that.""]",1272,242,0.94,1272,3362,3362,9,0,0.0,9

I think we will discuss the history of the VSC for a long time before or not, but the plan was to last longer and the reason for Carlos‚Äôs drilling is only the debris, not the excessive degradation‚Äù.\n\nThe Ferrari team principal believes that even in these conditions the drivers performed everything at their best: ‚ÄúThe initial conduct was too conservative if you know you have a Safety Car on lap 25, but the plan was to go a little longer than that and I think it was the right approach because when we decided to push from lap 12/15 the pace was there and I think we expected to do a long stint. Honestly the initial plan was executed very well by the two drivers and they did a great job‚Äù.\n\n**THE FINAL FLIGHT WITH THE MCLAREN**\n\nThe Qatar GP on paper was the most difficult appointment for Ferrari in this final triptych of races, but the course of the race allowed the Maranello team to shorten on the McLaren on the Manufacturers‚Äô ranking and at the same time Leclerc to arrive at only 8 lengths from Lando Norris. Vasseur underlines the positive surprise of this weekend, promising battle in the final appointment of Abu Dhabi: ‚ÄúWe would have signed before the weekend to score more points than McLaren. We are still alive for the championship and Charles is not far from Norris now. I also think that second place in the overall Pilots‚Äô standings is a good result. I‚Äôd rather have 20 points of advantage than 20 of offset, but let‚Äôs see. On paper I think the next circuit will probably be a little better for us. We fight until the last curve of the last lap‚Äù.\n\nFerrari will show up at Yas Marina with less pressure than McLaren, which instead has everything to lose. Vasseur explained that the Maranello team must continue to focus only on itself, as it has done so far: ‚ÄúIt is not a matter of pressure. The important thing is to do a good job and be fast, then we‚Äôll see. First of all you have to focus on yourself. We managed to make 1-2 on weekends during the season, we have to try to do our best to achieve this goal. But it‚Äôs true that even if we do 1-2, they can be champions. The most important thing is to focus on yourself, don‚Äôt start thinking about what others do. This weekend the approach was very good, because we stayed focused on our strategy without thinking too much about what McLaren or Red Bull were doing. It‚Äôs not said that we‚Äôll be in good shape next week in Abu Dhabi, but we‚Äôll have to put everything together. It‚Äôs always a challenge, but we will enter Abu Dhabi with enormous motivation‚Äù.\n\n**FAR FROM CONTROVERSY**\n\nThe result of the Qatar GP was strongly conditioned by the decisions of the Race Management. Vasseur believes that the discussions on the decisions taken by the stewards are nothing new: ‚ÄúIn the last 35 years of my life we have all always complained about the decision of the stewards and the Race Director. Maybe a little less with Charlie (Whiting) for different reasons. But it‚Äôs always been like that‚Äù.\nThe Ferrari team principal did not want to give a judgment either on the relegation of a position imposed on Max Verstappen on Saturday or on the 10-second stop&go set on Norris on Sunday: ‚ÄúHonestly, I haven‚Äôt even seen Saturday‚Äôs video, but it‚Äôs in the range of penalties to give a penalty position. Same for today, for Lando. It is at their discretion and they can impose this type of penalty. It certainly depends on the severity of the violation, if it was faster than the previous land in that mini sector, but it‚Äôs to allow me to focus on Abu Dhabi that I don‚Äôt want to start making controversy now. I‚Äôve tried to stay away from every single controversy throughout the season, I won‚Äôt start again before the last grand prix‚Äù.\n\nThe French manager also pushed away criticism about the performance of his next driver Lewis Hamilton in the second part of this season: ‚ÄúHamilton? Take a look at the 50 laps he did in Las Vegas starting tenth and finishing in the trail at Russell. I‚Äôm not worried at all‚Äù. The issue of Guanyu Zhou, approached Ferrari as a test driver next season and the protagonist of an excellent performance in Lusail where he finished eighth, was also liquidated in a few words: ‚ÄúZhou had a good race. Congratulations. I didn‚Äôt argue with him, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm focused on my work. But let‚Äôs see, let‚Äôs see in the future‚Äù Vasseur concluded.', 'Ferrari always gets screwed over in WCC with no fault of their own. Last year the drain covers and now this', 'Ferrari WCC and Leclerc runner up in the wdc.', 'If Ferrari win this they own Verstappen an enormous Christmas present', 'Ferrari very unlucky. Two years in a row, first with Carlos and the manhole and this year with the debris puncture. Both highly avoidable']",591,48,0.99,591,45,45,159,8,0.010000000000000009,159

1h4dlj7,Both Sainz/Hamilton reported tire issues before passing broken mirror debris,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4dlj7/both_sainzhamilton_reported_tire_issues_before/,2024-12-01, Discussion,"If you watch the driver cams on F1TV, you'll hear Sainz reporting a  front-left tire pressure issue on the short straight between turns 15 and 16, roughly 10 seconds BEFORE Bottas hits the mirror. Hamilton can also be heard reporting a puncture while on the pit straight well before reaching the point where the mirror was hit by Bottas. (Please note that on driver cams, the radio is out of sync with the video, but you can tell when radio calls are made by watching the driver toggle the radio on their steering wheel.)

The debris appears to mostly fall on the RIGHT side of the track, off the racing line, and both Sainz and Hamilton report front-LEFT punctures. It's possible there was some other debris from when the mirror initially fell off the car, but it seems possible, if not likely, that these punctures were unrelated to the mirror debris.

The gap is 21 points, since McLaren has 640 and Ferrari 619. This is not all the scenarios, but a few to give you a picture of how well Ferrari has to do this weekend, and how bad McLaren has to be. Extra point for fastest lap is not taken into account here, but important not to forget. 

If Ferrari wins the race, a tie on points should also result in win for Ferrari in the constructors due to more wins than McLaren. They are currently tie with 5 wins each. If they end both on tie in points and in number of wins, the number of second places will count, and Mclaren will win constructors.

Now that the dust has settled in Qatar, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post-race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyze the results.

Low-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""I think the penalties drivers received during the race were appropriate.  We don't often see infractions for speeding in the pitlane as much as Lewis did (10+ kph over) or ignoring double yellows like Lando, so it can be easy to forget what the penalties for those infractions look like.\n\nWhat I don't think was appropriate was the race director's decision to just cover a piece of debris on track with a double yellow and seemingly no plan to clean it up until it was actually hit and started causing damage to cars.\n\nIf nobody hit that mirror, were we just going to go the rest of the race with a double yellow on that track's only real passing zone?  Was that actually the plan?"", 'I keep seeing misinformation about other drivers not lifting for the double yellows, especially the Ferraris, and people calling for them to get penalties. This is just not true and is easily viewable in the telemetry.\n\n[Leclerc](https://i.imgur.com/iUpv8Hs.png) and [Verstappen](https://i.imgur.com/7Fibh7F.png) both lifted significantly. [Piastri](https://i.imgur.com/YNmEtcm.png) did slightly less, but still clearly lifted. [Sainz](https://i.imgur.com/3kTn9yl.png) lifted the least, but critically, he still did so before he turned the corner. Out of the top five cars, [Norris](https://i.imgur.com/m7D5Ro4.png) is the only one who didn\'t react at all. His throttle usage in lap 30 is identical to lap 29. \n\nThere\'s also a post making waves on Twitter using the lap 31 telemetry as ""proof,"" but the lap that was penalized was lap 30.\n\nThe penalty Norris received is consistent with previous ones for ignoring double yellows in a race.\n\nThat being said... there needs to be a discussion about how terrible the debris was handled. First of all, why was the yellow flag removed six times before the double yellows were instated? Why were the double yellows instated then removed when the situation on track didn\'t change? Why didn\'t they even attempt to recover the debris? I understand that it wasn\'t on the racing line, but it was at the only overtaking corner on the entire track.

Entertaining, but a mess. \n\nFirst of all it's so interesting how big of a difference lifting parc ferme after the sprint has made to my enjoyment of sprint weekends. It solved one of my biggest issues last season, with the race basically being a foregone conclusion after knowing all of the teams racepace from the sprint. Now the setup changes can completely flip the top teams around again. In this case it meant that Red Bull went from slower than a Haas on Saturday, to winning on merit on the Sunday. Also a nice showcase just how important finding the right setup is. \n\nNow onto the race direction/stewards decisions. I still really do not understand what happend with the Max grid drop. I'm a bit afraid of the precedent that the stewards have set with it, and I'm not looking forward to people like Alonso and Max exploiting it in the future. \n\nThat mirror probably should've been a VSC a lot earlier. It was also a bit of a mess with the yellow flags. I'm not really sure I like the FIAs explanation but the top 3 during the presser said that it happens more often with debris off the racing line. As far as I know we haven't had confirmation from Ferrari and Mercedes that the debris caused there punctures, but if it did that really screwed over both Lewis and Carlos. \n\nI was a bit surprised at seeing the 10sSG and the DT penalties, but after reading some posts here yesterday apparently those were in line with earlier precedent so I can't actually complain too much about that."", 'Another great performance from Gasly. He had a  bit of a slow start to the season but he‚Äôs been really on it since ~Spain. His performance relative to Ocon this season has been every bit as good, if not better than what Alonso managed across 2021-2022. He might even sneak inside my top five drivers this season.', ""Spent a lot of time watching track maps and onboards today on the mirror saga. Here are my takes:\n\n* Unless there was already carbon fiber bits on the track, Sainz's puncture is unrelated to the mirror. Sainz was complaining on radio before he got on to the straight. \n* Lewis definitely hit debris from mirror. I think his front left wasn't in the best condition and as soon as it hit that part of track, Lewis felt the vibration and was on radio even before the 1st turn. \n\n* Bottas caused a lot of unintended mayhem, just because he was being lapped. When he hit the mirror, he wasn't racing. He was moving over for Charles. He didn't hit it with his tyre but rather his car's underbody scooped it up. Interestingly Bottas didn't feel anything like a hit. Nor did his pitwall say anything. He did the lap after hitting it, just like the one before with his engineer giving him basic updates. \n\n* Lando not noticing flags seems to be a combination of: his engineer started talking on the radio, just before the flags and the signalling post before the flags being a basic yellow. Max noticed it because he was in clear air and from his onboard, he has like a couple seconds more to notice it. \n\n* I didn't follow it very well but it seems like GP made Max aware of the ground Lando has made up on him with DRS (DRS he got I think by lapping Bottas). Max who did lift for double yellows immediately put 2 and 2 together. \n\n* In my opinion, there were 2 large enough gaps to VSC and get the mirror away. Front 3 had a decent gap to Kmag and there was a gap between Lewis and Gasly I think. The way I read the track map, in each case the front car was about to exit the straight and back car hadn't turned the final corner. The space was there for 2 full laps. Afterwards, I think people upped their speed expecting a safety car and the gap closed up. \n\n* Nobody actually responded to George about why he got put on hards. He yelled it on the radio and his engineer didn't acknowledge it. Just went on giving more diff and balance recommendations. George, to his credit, out his head down as soon as he realised the team wasn't gonna respond."", 'Still intrigued by the Gax incident\n\nFrom context clues (end of season, championship done and mood good, George and Max getting along), it was probably something unusual, given how Max emphasized that he\'s seen a lot in that room, but *this* is the one that was too much. Even GP was pissed. Horner called George ""hysterical"", and while one should never trust Horner, they all seemed baffled lol. Maybe the stewards were going for the usual reprimand but George really went the extra mile? Hard to tell, but as trigger happy as Red Bull can be, Idt Max would choose this situation out of everything to be so harsh. He seemed irate that it was implied that he did it on purpose. \n\nSo if George gave an Oscar-worthy performance about how ""dangerous"" Max was for being slow on a slow lap, I can see how to Max that would have a certain ""et tu, Brute?"" vibe rather than the typical fishing, because Max is already thought of as the spawn of Satan so it\'s an easier (if slimy) sell for something so minor.']",36,107,0.87,36,99,99,2,0,0.010000000000000009,2

1h550sx,Yuki vs Gasly: Unfair Narrative,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h550sx/yuki_vs_gasly_unfair_narrative/,2024-12-02, Discussion,"I originally posted some of this as a comment in a thread, but there‚Äôs a narrative in the F1 comments that Yuki had a dismal record against Gasly and therefore shouldn‚Äôt get a shot at RBR. I wanted to actually introduce a proper discussion on this using facts and comparing to the highly rated Piastri.

Context: 
Yuki: started as a rookie against Gasly (GP2 winner) in 2021 and 2022. Gasly was in his 5th year in F1 (actually 4.5 years)

Piastri: started as a a rookie against Norris (P2 in F2) in 2023 and 2024 after considerable testing with Alpine. Norris was also in his 5th year in F1.

Comparative head to head stats:

H2H: Gasly Tsunoda in 2 years Race: 30-13 Quali: 33-10

H2H Piastri Norris in 2 years Race: 32-13 Quali: 35-10

Any reasonable commentator would acknowledge that it‚Äôs difficult to say whether Norris or Gasly is stronger. 

It seems unreasonable that Piastri should be given a pass for being a rookie against Norris and underperforming, while Tsunoda carries his record against Gasly through his career.

P.S. The real issue here is lack of rookie testing that made Hamilton so successful in 2007. ","[""Simply posting a H2H without any further detail as to their quali delta and difference in race results is pretty meaningless imo. \n\nIf a driver is 10-0 with their teammate but the delta is only 0.050 on average it really isn't that bad. So this context is important (I have no clue as to what the delta would be in this scenario).\n\nI also think the discrepancy is mainly due to how highly rated norris and gasly are. In general norris was/is rated as a future world champion while gasly was still recovering from being destroyed by max and after that has never been rated any higher than being a solid midfield driver."", ""It may be time to throw Yuki in the RB.\n\nRBR have some serious thinking to do here (and really should have figured this out sooner) coming into the winter. \n\nIf they aren't going to give Yuki a shot, they should go after Bottas hard, at least for 2025.\n\n2026 many more options open up."", ""\\>Any reasonable commentator would acknowledge that it‚Äôs difficult to say whether Norris or Gasly is stronger.\n\nIt's not, just look how Gasly was demolishes against Max"", 'Once Red Bull gets the ick for a driver they‚Äôre not getting promoted. \n\nGasly was a race winner in 2020, and wasn‚Äôt promoted despite them not backing Albon at the time.

Now let‚Äôs get down to business‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# The Qatar Grand Prix



***Sprint Qualifying / Sprint Race:***

P1. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri

P2. George Russell / Lando Norris

P3. Oscar Piastri / George Russell



**Qualifying / Grand Prix:**

P1. George Russell / Max Verstappen

P2. Max Verstappen / Charles Leclerc

P3. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri



***Throttle & Tread‚Äôs Reaction:***

When you remove the order-jumbling facilitated by the FIA‚Äôs exceptionally poor handling of Albon‚Äôs discharged mirror into T1 (which could have been swiftly dealt with in a lap or two by a VSC) and the sudden resurgence of drive-through penalties, not much went on in this race. However, who doesn't love a little chaos, albeit controversial? Especially when the end result brings some stakes to Abu Dhabi.

***Personal highlights from Lusail include:***

* Zhou‚Äôs‚Äîand Sauberaudi‚Äôs‚Äîfirst points of the year!
* Valterri Bottas elevating himself from 23rd in the WDC
* Pierre Gasly continuing his strong run of form with a solid P5
* Ferrari keeping their WDC hopes alive (with a little help from Lando)
* Lewis‚Äôs absolute rollercoaster of a race: *He dropped 4 positions at the start, picked up a 5 second penalty, asked if the car was broken, got a puncture, pitted, received a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane, pitted, asked to retire, was told to stay out‚Äîthen told to retire, decided to stay out this time, then closed a 12 second gap, gained 3 positions, and finished in P12.*

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

*Welp, I can‚Äôt say I expected this heap of driver rumblings and rumours to hit the airwaves in Qatar:*

Desire for Young Gun Franco Colapinto has been cooled by his recent run of crashes‚Äîmeaning [his shot at a seat in the Red Bull stable is gooone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4plvs/thomas_maher_franco_colapinto_is_off_the_table/)¬†

So assuming there‚Äôs truth to the growing number of [reports that Checo will be let go and/or offered an ambassadorship role](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4uhiz/perez_red_bull_exit_likely_after_abu_dhabi_f1/) a la Danny Ric once the checkered flag waves in Abu Dhabi, Liam or Yuki will get the ride in 2025.

[Estie Besteban Ocon‚Äôs 2024 season came to an unexpected and premature end](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4raqi/alpine_goodbye_esteban_ocon/) in Qatar, [as a condition for him being able to test with his new team‚ÄîHaas‚Äîafter Abu Dhabi.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4bhsq/the_race_ocon_had_to_give_up_final_alpine_race_to/) In his place, [Jack Doohan will make his debut.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qvmd/alpine_team_statement_jack_doohan_will_race_at/)

And *maybe now* we‚Äôll get an end to the hopeful ‚ÄòMick Schumacher returns to the F1 grid‚Äô articles, [given he‚Äôs chosen to leave his Mercedes role at year's end.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uhjk/mercedes_amg_f1_we_can_confirm_that_mick/)

Speaking of reserve drivers, [Alpine has signed F2 rookie Paul Aron as their 2025 reserve](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h38p21/bwt_alpine_formula_one_team_paul_aron_signs_as/)‚Äîstepping in for Jack Doohan who is graduating to a race seat.

*However, Jacky D might be holding his breath,* [*as there have been rumours over the past couple weeks that Franco Colapinto could scoop that seat out from under him‚Ä¶*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3awow/thomas_maher_the_rumours_of_colapinto_switching/) *Which would be absolutely gut wrenching. We‚Äôll see!*

Departing Formula 1 for the second time, everyone‚Äôs favourite viking, [Kevin Magnussesn, seems set to join the BMW M Team WRT in WEC next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3algi/enduranceinfo_wec_kevin_magnussen_on_course_to/)

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

***The F1 grid‚Äôs most recent addition:***

As they‚Äôve asserted all along, ~~Andretti-~~Cadillac‚Äôs preparation for joining the grid in 2026 continues at pace, [with their latest hiring of former Renault engine tech chief, Rob White.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gznb3i/autosport_andretti_lands_former_renault_f1_engine/) But that‚Äôs not even close to all on the matter‚Ä¶

Thanks to some curious combination of Michael Andretti stepping back from the day-to-day operations, potential legal pressure applied by an American DOJ antitrust investigation, and ‚ÄúAndretti‚Äù¬† being dropped from the name‚Ä¶

The General Motors-supported [Cadillac F1 Team *will* join the grid in 2026.](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/gm-cadillac-2026-f1-team-andretti-absent/)

[So far we know that:](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0ajxt/mario_andretti_reveals_his_plans_for_americas_new/)¬†

1. Their ideal driver lineup consists of a ‚Äúyoung American talent‚Äù (with Colton Herta being the top candidate) and an F1 veteran ([Bottas?](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1yi0n/cadillac_f1_interest_2025_indycar_offer_bottas/)). 
2. The Andretti Global organization is building the chassis and running the race team, with GM being responsible for leading the engine side.  
3. Until said GM engine is ready for 2028, there‚Äôs an interim engine deal with Ferrari in the works for 2026 and 2027.

*Now roll up your sleeves for a few more dashes of drama‚Ä¶*

***Audi‚Äîa project in trouble before rubber meets tarmac:***

Thanks to being blue-balled for years and years‚Ä¶ The F1 fandom at large remains skeptical that Audi will follow through on joining F1, at least until they show up on the grid. And making moves like selling 1/3 of the team to the Qatar Investment Authority won‚Äôt help. However, arrangements like these aren‚Äôt unusual in Formula 1‚Äî*At the very least* Mercedes, Renault, McLaren, Aston Martin, and Cadillac don‚Äôt have full ownership of their teams either.

[More concerning than a partial sale are the rumours that their 2026 engine is behind schedule and they‚Äôre having trouble attracting skilled personnel‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h08try/audi_sells_a_third_of_its_formula_1_team/)

***Hot bananas, the FIA is a roaring dumpster fire right now:***

In yet *another* firing, Race Steward Tim Mayer [warns that the FIA is running out of people to fulfill their responsibilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1wax6/andrew_benson_fired_steward_warns_fia_is_running/)‚Äîalso sharing that he was fired because Doodyhead Sulayem was offended by a right of review document.

Further bringing shame upon the FIA and their frustrating leader, Janette Tan‚Äîpromoted to F2 Race Director just one week or so ago to take over for Rui Marques who was elevated to the F1 role‚Äî[has been let go before she could direct even a single race, with Marques now directing both series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uc7o/fresh_fia_upheaval_as_f2_race_director_janette/)

If you want all the details, my hopefully future friends at The Race penned [this article](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/fia-embarrassing-crisis-deepens-ahead-of-f1-qatar-gp/) catching up on ‚Äòthe FIA‚Äôs embarrassing internal crisis.‚Äô

Unfortunately, MBS‚Äôs shenanigans have continued by [removing two top level FIA bankers from office for questioning him on where money was going‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h2gnoo/top_duo_removed_from_office_after_querying_fia/)

More questions of the FIA‚Äôs competency piled up in Qatar after the poor handling of Albon‚Äôs dismembered mirror was left on track, hit and exploded into smithereens by Valterri Bottas, likely contributing to two punctures‚Ä¶

While there‚Äôs no argument about Lando, Lewis, etc deserving penalties for their infractions, the sudden doling out of stop-and-go and drive-through penalties has left teams and drivers frustrated at the lack of consistency.

*Plus* good ‚Äòol [Doodyhead Sulayem thinks that how he runs the FIA is none of the drivers‚Äô business‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h43xey/ben_sulayem_tells_f1_drivers_how_he_runs_fia_is/) Which seems an awfully silly take to this observer.

In closing, [Toto Wolff thinks the FIA could have its own reality show.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qtun/wolff_fia_could_have_its_own_reality_show_amid/)

# Technical Tidbits

In a classic Certified Alpine Moment, Pierre Gasly‚Äôs engine blew in Vegas due to a combo of DRS, slipstream, and dirty air from Yuki ahead‚Äî[his engine reached 12937 rpm in 8th gear, had enough, and went boom-bang-boom.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzpv8g/fdataanalysis_unbelievable_the_slipstream_made/)
