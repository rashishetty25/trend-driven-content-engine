2013-2014 - Gutierrez - During the 2014 British Grand Prix he had a collision with Maldonado at vale which damaged his suspension causing him to go straight on into the gravel and out of the race at abbey.

**Image 1: Constructor Dominance**

This first graphic shows which constructor was the fastest in each mini-sector of the Silverstone circuit.

* **Red Bull Racing:** Unsurprisingly, they were absolutely dominant on the straights. The dark blue lines show their top-speed advantage on the Hangar and Wellington straights.
* **McLaren:** The papaya orange shows up strong in the high-speed cornering sections, owning large chunks of the Maggotts, Becketts, and Chapel complex.

  
**Image 2: Track Dominance - Piastri vs. Verstappen**

This second graphic drills down into the individual performances of Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen, showing who was faster and where.

* It's a classic trade-off: Verstappen leverages the Red Bull's incredible straight-line speed, while Piastri's McLaren appears to have the edge in cornering performance.

1lsr6so,A Couple Questions From a New Viewer,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lsr6so/a_couple_questions_from_a_new_viewer/,2025-07-06, Discussion,"Recently got into watching F1 and had a few questions about the dynamic of the competition for a chance to learn about some implied truths I might be missing out on.

\-Is it just a given that some teams will have no chance at podium finish all year and that they're more focused on finishing as close as they can to top 10? What I'm picking up from the dialogue is that some cars just outclass others and no matter how good of a driver you are you're not beating the regular top finishers.

\-Leads me to my second question, is it just an known objective fact by everyone involved that McClaren has the best car right now? I don't know anything about the tech behind these cars. Is it normal to expect them to continue to be dominating or are the modifications teams make between races a big enough game changer for it to be back and forth.

\-Lastly, if the answers to the above are yes, question to you guys as fans but how do you stay engaged throughout the season if you're a fan of a backmarker team or driver? Not that that stops me from watching but it seems like it'd be disappointing to not get much coverage during a race of specific drivers if I'm a fan of drivers who are always finishing outside of top 10 or someone who might DNF early.

edit: forgot to say thank you for taking your time to read this at the end of post so doing it now. appreciate all the insightful comments!","[""* Yes. Other than the top 3-4 teams, others almost never make it onto the podium, barring external factors like rain or other yellow/red flags.\n* Yes, it is known. In any other seasons, other teams would still try to improve their cars to match or beat McLaren. However, since next year brings new regulations, most teams are shifting their focus there and are not spending more technical and financial resources on this year's car.\n* Not really. The truth is, more often than not, it's actually more fun following mid and lower-level teams from a championship perspective; they're usually fighting for a single point difference. And that can mean millions of dollars in price money."", 'Others will probably give you better answers but I‚Äôll try to answer all 3 of these:\n\n1. Pretty much yes, for an Alpine or Sauber or Haas to finish on the podium this season it would require a minor miracle (although Alpine got one in Brazil last year and managed to finish with a double podium, but that was about as hectic a race as you‚Äôll ever see in F1). Even if the slowest car on the grid was only 0.5 seconds per lap behind the fastest car, over the course of a 60 lap race that‚Äôs half a minute in time and literal miles behind. So small gaps in pace can become insurmountable over the course of a race distance.\n\n2. McLaren currently have the best car by a large margin, although there are some tracks that suit other cars better (such as Mercedes in Canada). They will probably continue dominating, but it is possible that other teams will upgrade their cars enough to close the gap or even surpass McLaren. We saw this last year when Red Bull dominated the first 8ish races then had the 3rd fastest car by the end of the season because McLaren and Ferrari made better upgrades.\n\n3. Like in many sports, if you‚Äôre a fan of a team/player that simply isn‚Äôt capable of competing for championships, you take the small wins. A double points finish for Haas is probably about as exciting for their fans as a double podium is for McLaren fans. What‚Äôs been nice about this season is that every team has been able to score points on several different occasions, as opposed to years past when teams like Sauber will go all year without even sniffing the top 10.', ""1) yes, mostly though last year alpine was probably the worst on average but did manage a 2nd and 3rd in a rain race with a lucky strategy and good wet pace\n\n2) on average McLaren does,  but there's been a few times they missed setup and legit may not have been faster. They can upgrade the cars throughout the season and the pecking order can change. Last season redbull was way ahead for 5 or 6 races then for the entire rest of the season McLaren was faster.\n\n\nFollow up q\n\nYou pick a driver or two to watch and see how they do how the strategy fall in place where they are. The entire show isn't who wins. F1 historically isn't very race exciting. It's the engineering and raw speed."", ""\\> Is it normal to expect them to continue to be dominating\n\nYes, but the summer break can be a huge turning point. it won't, but it can be.\n\n\\> how do you stay engaged throughout the season if you're a fan of a backmarker team or driver?\n\nDue to the nature of the sport, we basically have several races going on at the same time, so the midfield battles are as valid as top ones, and more often than not they are more fierce. Like multiclass in GT, but everyone is still a competitor. It also opens up a possibility to a genuine miracle (Alpine in Brazil 2024), and even if not, it's still very cool to see what really good drivers can do with the cards dealt to them."", ""First and foremost, it's an engineering competition."", 'Enough people have answered your first two so I don‚Äôt need to repeat. But for the enjoyment part, I‚Äôm an Oscar fan (being an Aussie) so it‚Äôs obviously easy following the pointy end of the drivers championship.\xa0\n\nIn saying that, what drew me to F1 recently was that I love following the storylines up and down the grid. Such as:\n\n-Watching with interest how Lewis does at Ferrari\n\n-The interactions between rookies & veterans this season has been really nice to watch\n\n-Antonelli‚Äôs first pole and podium\n\n-Bortoleto getting his first point last week & the on track battle with Alonso.\xa0\n\n-Following Williams‚Äô progress to see if they can get back to competing, it‚Äôs been a rollercoaster so far.\xa0\n\n-Watching the dumpster fire that is currently Alpine and seeing where they go from here etc.\n\nAs much as I want Oscar to win it all, I‚Äôm a fan of the sport and appreciating every race weekend for what it is and whatever storylines it throws up each week.', 'I guess what makes this interesting as a post is you‚Äôre trying to get at what makes F1 interesting during a race.\n\nWhen it comes to on track action the level of interest ranks from most to least as follows: crashes/spins, overtaking, retirements, pit stops, lone cars lapping.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that I want crashes to happen but they are the most sensational part of racing, and they usually have an impact on the outcome of a race. If you talk about races from the past, crashes are often key to them being memorable.\n\nYour issue is if the driver you support is lapping on their own and down the leaderboard, then you‚Äôre not going to see them much. But isn‚Äôt it somewhat similar to a team ball sport where your player isn‚Äôt the key player so they‚Äôre playing support and not really in the action most of the time?\n\nI guess you‚Äôre lamenting that once a driver is in a team for the season, your fate is sealed as to what you can expect due to the car‚Äôs performance?\n\nAnd then I stop and wonder that even if I‚Äôm a fan of a driver, do I delight in just watching them lapping. There is a way I do but that‚Äôs not usually in the context of a race, it‚Äôs more for analysis afterwards.\xa0\n\nThe hard part of F1 is being able to understand the athleticism and skill as it‚Äôs the opposite of showy, like a great dunk or a bicycle kick, drivers are usually trying to be as clean as possible, more like a train. So just seeing a driver lapping on their own doesn‚Äôt do much for me during a race as what I want to see during a race is things that impact the outcome.\n\nThis is when you get into tyre/pit strategies and following that for all the drivers. So I don‚Äôt support one driver and vary my hopes from race to race,\xa0caring about them achieving their own goals.\n\nProbably motorsport‚Äôs biggest problem is that most of the time the most exciting and outcome variable moment of a race is the start. It‚Äôs the time that a crash is most likely and the chance for the most overtakes. So it‚Äôs often downhill from there for excitement and you‚Äôre relying on a big crash to cause a red flag for a standing restart or two drivers that are tight at the lead on the last lap to exceed the race start for tension.', 'My take on it:\n\n1. Some teams do a better job than others. Driver can make a difference (see Verstappen vs his teammates), but the performance of the car has massive impact. Big regulation changes can sometimes change the order. And many teams, that have no chance to catch up, will switch to the next season and hope that they get the next car right.\n2. Pretty much yes. Not on every track, but in the grand scheme - Yes.\n3. On Sky for example, you can follow one driver, if you want. Overall, i think that it is reductive to focus only at the top 3. Other teams and drivers can still do a good job, relative to their ranking. And on occasion, luck can have a big impact.', ""I've watched F1 for some time now, not a vet from like 2000 but definitely not just watched DTS S7 and now getting into it so here are my takes, corrections greatly appreciated from other fans. \n\n1.) In older seasons/eras, especially with some very dominant teams the difference between positions can be as far as a second and more, but now that margin has closed up to mere milliseconds, with the latest Quali, sees Colapinto dead last, out in Q1 having a gap of \\~1.7 seconds from the leader Max Verstappen. Since F1 isn't a spec series (meaning cars will be unequal due to self-development based on regulations) some cars will be utter shit like the Alpine and Sauber cars. HOWEVER, F1 can be very unpredictable with mistakes, penalties, crashes, poor Ferrari strategies, poor pit stops being possible can still give the backmarker teams a chance at a podium. Nico Hulkenberg driving for Sauber managed P5 and could've been higher, due to many factors like Verstappen's crashout with Russell's Mercedes. Unless you're a top team like McLaren, RB, Merc or Ferrari, your best bet is pure dominant race pace, minimal mistakes and hope. \n\n  \n2.) It can go deeper into the technical side discussing the ups and downs of every car and where they're dominant at like how Red Bull crushes at the straights, but as of now, starting from around the 2024 season yes, McLaren is the best car right now, as you could tell with their regular podiums and wins, as well as Piastri being the championship title leader. Assuming their team engineers and staff can swiftly adapt to the new 2026 Regulations, there is a chance for them to continue domination, but the Mercedes car went from WCC winner and WDC contender in 2021, to close to a shitbox not having adapted to ground effect regulations, thus bringing the title fight/s to Leclerc and Verstappen of Ferrari and Red Bull respectively. \n\n  \n3.) I am unsure who you support in the backmarkers, but your best bet is to watch the sessions and sing praises/ jump for joy when they perform well like with Lawson outqualifying Verstappen in a VCARB, hope for the best when they get into an incident or DNF in a race. Also you could also peruse the team's social media for PR videos/memes like Fernando's quirky TikToks for some fun in the times AM delivers yet another tractor. Overall do not expect the best results from backmarkers because they're backmarkers. Have fun and be grateful when they deliver a masterclass at times.""]",59,55,0.82,59,51,51,2,0,0.009999999999999898,2
1lslt5e,I Created a List of Top 150 Essential Sports Racing Movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lslt5e/i_created_a_list_of_top_150_essential_sports/,2025-07-05, Featured,"This one‚Äôs for all the Formula racing fans and for anyone who recently watched that new F1 2025 film (the one starring Brad Pitt by Apple) that re-introduced Formula racing to a whole new audience around the world. If that movie left you craving for more high-speed drama, legendary rivalries, and behind-the-scenes stories, welcome to the community - you‚Äôre in the right place!

**Link to Megathread for F1 Movie here:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk8rn0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk8rn0/)

So now that you‚Äôve seen *F1*, you might be wondering: *What should I watch next?* To get inspired & motivated or just want to know more about Auto racing sports and what it is about, basically the history and all the reasons why it has the most amazing audience globally!

I started building this list with the idea of rounding up **all the movies directly related to Formula 1**. But then I thought, why stop there? So I added films and docs about Formula 2, Formula E, and other motorsport gems too. And, as it turns out, there actually aren‚Äôt *that* many dramatic feature films that focus solely on F1, most of the really good stuff is in incredible documentaries and behind-the-scenes specials - leaving with only 20 to 30 titles - which is also amazing, but mostly its interview, documentary films..

So, this collection isn‚Äôt just about flashy F1 cars. It‚Äôs a hand-picked mix of movies and docs that truly capture the spirit of **auto racing - the rivalries, the heartbreaks, and the rush of living life at 200 mph.** No filler, no random car cameos just for show, only films and stories that deserve to be here. I tried my best not to just add & fill up movies that just had scenes of luxury looking F1 cars that are mostly in the background.

Do people believe that racing should carry on unless conditions are exceptionally wet i.e torrential thunderstorm, monsoon like conditions?

Personally, I'd like to see racing continue in most circumstances because it allows the ""wet weather specialists"" to shine, giving them an opportunity to level the playing field against cars they may not be able to compete with in more ideal weather conditions.

I understand the safety aspect and the reasoning but surely you drive to the conditions and capabilities of your car. Exceed the cars abilities and that is just the same as doing so in the dry?
