It has been a very long time, almost 4 years, since our last round of moderator recruitment. Back then we were only at 1.5 million members. Since then not only has the subreddit tripled in size, but after the 2023 Reddit Blackout multiple members of the mod team had left and since then the rest of us had also come close to being burnt out. So with all that and with an exciting 2025 season on the horizon it's time for a new round of moderator recruitment.

The qualifications to become a moderator are very simple:

* be a motorsports fan
* use reddit

The expectations for the new moderators are to be transparent, to be communicative and to be reasonably active. We have a guideline of 300 mod actions per month, but don't let this stop you from applying. **Real life always comes before Reddit** and just let the rest of the team know if you need a break.

After the form is closed we will evaluate the applications, compile a shortlist and invite those candidates to an interview. The interview will be conducted as an audio or video call. After the interview we will make the final selection of moderators and we hope to be able to onboard them by the Japanese GP at the start of April.

The applications will close on the 22nd of February at 23:00 UTC

[**Link to the application form**](https://forms.gle/gHS5HKHDWNbpJzXs8)

If you have any questions or doubts feel free to ask in the comments.

# FAQ

* **What timezones are you looking for mods from?**
   * We're looking for mods from all timezones
* **What do you use for communication between the team?**
   * Slack
* **Should I apply if I applied in previous rounds?**
   * Yes. It has been 4 years!
* **Do you need to have moderation experience?**
   * No, it's not an issue if you don't have moderator experience yet.
* **What are the tasks of a moderator exactly?**
   * Obviously the primary task is going through the modqueue and removing comments and posts that go against the subreddit rules. But there are other aspects like configuring automoderator, working on graphics and flairs, maintaining source ratings, external relations (Teams & Journalists for AMAs, etc), social media and so on.
* **Is there any compensation for moderation?**
   * Absolutely none. This is a volunteer role","['I‚Äôd do it but any Seb Vettel hate would result in a permanent ban.

I\'ve never seen anything bad written or said about him. \n\nWhen I was a kid I had a Scalextric set with two F1 cars - a 1994 Williams FW16, and a 1995 McLaren MP4-10.\n\nAs many F1 buffs will know, the FW16 had a low nose with the wing bolted directly onto it, but the MP4-10 was on of the first ""shark nose"" cars with the wing suspended from two pillars, something that became standard in F1 until the recent move back to low-noses with directly attached wings.\n\nObviously, scaled down to Scalextric size, the front with of the McLaren, being held on by two tiny bits of plastic, would easily snap when the car crashed, which being Scalextric, it did, a lot.\n\nNothing would hold it in place, but I noticed that their cars were sponsored by Loctite, so I sat down and wrote Ron a nice letter, asking if he had any special glue he could provide me as it was my favourite car and I was a big supporter of McLaren, popped it in the post, and even at 9 years old assumed that would be the end of the story.\n\nThen a few weeks later, a letter came through from McLaren, on McLaren letterheaded paper, all very official, signed and written by Ron himself. He explained that they unfortunately couldn\'t provide any special glue (no surprises there!) but he was happy for my support and suggested that modelling glue used on model planes might work well. He also included a signed photo of David Coulthard and apologised that they\'d run out of Mika\'s. I grant a secretary or someone might have written it, but it was signed in ink by the man himself.\n\nThis was during the off season between 1998/1999, obviously a very busy time for the team, so to think he made the effort to write back to a child asking for carbon-fibre grade glue is quite wonderful.', 'It has to be called Fifty Shades of Grey.', ""I always question the validity of the claim that Toto is the best team principal.

1imyulw,Am I the only one actually optimistic for the F1 Movie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1imyulw/am_i_the_only_one_actually_optimistic_for_the_f1/,2025-02-11, Discussion,"Title. I feel like any post about the movie has half the comments being unneccessarily pessimistic. Calling it Driven on a higher budget. I feel like judging a movie from less than 3 minutes of promotional material is a bit odd, especially since just last year we had Transformers ONE which convinced everyone the movie would be terrible based on the marketing only for it to be a great film. Claiming a movie will be bad preemptively is just a little sad.

F1 fans in general seem to be under the impression this movie should only be for the extremely passionate fans who know every inch of the sport,otherwise it won't be good, when that's clearly not the case. Like any good fandom movie, it's designed to be something casual fans, experts, and people who vaguely know a guy named Lewis Hamilton can watch and enjoy. 

There's a lot of positives to take in my opinion. The Top Gun Maverick director is working on this one, so at the least the racing scenes should be fantastic and with Lewis helping out with production, they will try to maintain some degree of accuracy. They've also got the writer from the Transformers movies and Hans Zimmer working on it. I saw people whining about some of clips they've been recording, but we don't even know how those will look in post or if they'll even be in the movie, given they recorded clips of both Brad Pitt and Damson Idris winning in Abu Dhabi. They could always scrap or heavily edit them.

As for the plot, will it be like Rush or FordVFerrari? Absolutely not, because they aren't making a biopic, they're making a relvatively original plot that needs to not dumb it down too much to deter passionate fans nor make it so niche that casual viewers and the secondary audience aren't confused, which anybody would know is much more difficult than it sounds, especially with a fanbase as fickle as this one. Will there be some Hollywood cheesiness in it as a result? Of course there will be! But you can't disagree even some seasons in real life played perfectly straight with zero inaccuracies (something even Rush can't claim) would be accused of being ripped from Hollywood.

All I'm saying is, have a little faith. I will probably make a follow up to this with a review for the movie where I HOPE I'm not wrong.

The logo may have changed but our cars remained as successful as ever.  \n\n>1997-2006: The revamped logo that first appeared in 1997 featured a streamlined speedmark that bares similarities to the vortices created by our rear wing. It appeared on the top of our cars‚Äô side-pods. They evoke the aggressive markings found on predatory animals and insects.\n\nThough I guess the kiwi logo led directly to the simplification into the chevron logo which it still sorta resembled if you squinted, which later led to the stylization into the speedmark logo."", 'dude the season is starting soon just hold out a bit longer', '[Is this also a kiwi?](https://imgur.com/a/qcLedgY)', ""There's a kiwi in that logo? Can someone point it out for me, please?"", 'It‚Äôs nothing to do with a kiwi and everything to do with Marlboro.\n\nThe logo change was in the 70‚Äôs-80‚Äôs from a bird to a cigarette pack.\n\nAs things developed the a Marlboro Chevron became the Speedmark and the speedmark got more rounded and changed colours over the years.', ""bruh. It's the speed tick. The kiwi is the past."", 'It‚Äôs been mentioned many times before - although to the casual observer I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôd pick it up‚Ä¶British team based in UK forever & a Kiwi founder who died in 1970 doesn‚Äôt necessarily shout kiwi in logo.', 'Is it a Kiwi? It looks to me like a more streamlined chevron from their 1981-1998 logos. I can definitely see how it evokes a Kiwi, beak facing towards the McLaren logo.', 'It was a throwback to the old chevron design which was in itself effectively a Marlboro advertisement. They softened it, turned it orange and called it a ‚Äòspeedmark‚Äô. But if you look at it closely it does genuinely look like a kiwi leaning forwards. The two ends of the logo aren‚Äôt the same length or angle. It gives the impression of a beak and a pair of little kiwi legs. Whether the unknown kiwi in the logo is intentional or it‚Äôs just ended up like that is unclear.']",0,43,0.35,0,203,203,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
