I’d figure that both drivers would get the same car, same build, etc… but recently we’ve been hearing about Max getting a brand new engine, and I didn’t hear anything about if Tsunoda got one as well.

Obviously Max is much better, so if they’ve only got one engine to give, they should put it in his car, but it generally got me wondering if the cars have to match, or if weaker drivers fall even further behind by a team giving upgrades to the favored driver.","['Both cars are the same basic design.

Teams may not have enough parts to have both cars on the same spec, they may want to run two different specs of a part of test purposes, or they may have minor differences for driver preference, like McLaren this year. But they generally won't develop two different cars for their drivers.\n\nEngine components are restricted, so teams can only use a certain number per season, and the limit is per car. So each car has its own pool of restricted parts they can use. Exceeding the limit comes with a penalty. They took that penalty for max in Brazil because they already got the highest penalty for another matter, so it didnt make a difference. And they later did the same with Yuki in Vegas because again, the effective penalty was almost none."", ""Usually is the same car, but there's some priority who gets the upgraded parts."", ""first off, the spec of car being the same or different completely depends on the team, some teams will give different specs of car to each driver if they prefer different things (mclaren, for example, brought a suspension change early in the season that oscar doesn't like, so oscar doesn't use it and lando does)\n\nwith the max engine change, each driver has a max number of engine parts they can take, so you only change it when you need to. Changing yuki's engine just because they changed max's makes no sense"", ""The same car.\n\nYou can't see it, but at Red Bull Yuki actually sits on Max's lap and Max lets him drive on the straights."", ""Yuki's car is made of lead. As others have said, the team gives both drivers the same car, but each driver will have their team set theirs up differently. So in this case, yuki asked his team to add heaps of weight so it's slower and doesn't handle well by adding lead."", ""Only when the upgrades first hit will there be any major differences outside of it being setup related. That's just because when upgrades are first manufactured there might not be enough stock to outfit both cars, so it goes to whichever driver is seen as the number 1 with the team."", ""It's mostly the same car. Sometimes one driver might not have an upgrade if parts are limited. Very occasionally teams might allow drivers to have some different parts based on driver preference. Lando and Oscar have at least one difference by choice. Drivers can choose different wings week to week, and some teams are okay with that, like one picking lower downforce than the other. Sometimes the general public might not have all the details unless someone who knows talks to the media.\n\nI assume someone else has already explained engine and other parts allocation, that they are specific to the seat and each has their own allotment.""]",0,35,0.42,0,171,171,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
