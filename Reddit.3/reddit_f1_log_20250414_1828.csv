At turn 7, Norris hesitates slightly longer before going full throttle again — looks like a lift mid-corner or a traction issue?  
Meanwhile, Piastri commits earlier and cleaner, maintaining momentum through the high-speed section.

In Turns 4 and 14, it’s actually Piastri who lifts earlier than Norris. Feels like Piastri’s just piecing together a smarter lap overall — giving up a little entry to gain more on the exit.

Or just Piastri being on the absolute edge this weekend?","['I wrote it in the other post with the F1-tempo data, the lifts for Piastri in T4 and T14 are just wrong data, no other explanation.

Now that the dust has settled in Bahrain, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""George's drive yesterday should be the last slide in his powerpoint deck for contract renewal. Really brilliant race management considering the DRS problems. He was also showing race intelligence with lifting because he was aware of the DRS activation and it saved his P2. In the long term view of the season, if Mercedes brings good upgrades this save can be really important for his WDC bid"", 'It’s like all the action we missed in Japan just got postponed to Bahrain and we got double action. No wonder the TV directors couldn’t keep up. \n\nRegardless of any debates on drivers, direction, and championships, what a race!', ""On a more positive note considering it would be nice for levity, let me redirect my attention to Haas\n\nIn the aftermath of Ocon's unfortunate crash around that turn and Bearman qualifying dead last, it seems like it is a race to be left in the pits. The sheer grit and consistency pulled off, alongside with the strategy that got their drivers climbing up the pack to take away double points for the weekend is so rejuvenating to watch! I am so, so thrilled to see Haas in this form, and I'm so glad to see Komatsu and the crew leading the charge. I really am rooting for these guys, through and through!"", ""I know it just been 4 races but i feel like Max's starts have been less optimal this season, he lost positions in both China and Bahrain which i feel like has been the first time he is losing positions on the opening lap for a while"", 'The soft outperforming the hard over a 40% race distance stint is so crazy and makes so little sense. Fuck these tires.', ""Yesterday was a great example of why it's important for the Hard tyre to always be the slowest, or at least not be be the obvious 'best' race tyre. We need more of that."", 'Ferrari strategy was brilliant yesterday, they got screwed over by the SC. Should have ended Leclerc P2/P3 and Lewis P4/5.', ""McLaren - class of the field this race, especially Oscar. Hopefully just one of the stronger tracks for them. It missed a battle out at the front, but that's more down to Lando underperforming in qualifying and then having mistakes here and there in the race which meant he couldn't go on the attack.\xa0\n\n\nMercedes - strong car this weekend, with yet another brilliant drive from Russell. Too bad they decided to have a strategic blunder on Kimi's side. Loved to see all his overtakes though, even if he did get stuck in a DRS train in the final stretch of the race.\xa0\n\n\nFerrari - had a good strategy. Did something opposite their rivals and could have paid off had the SC not ruined it a bit. I think given the circumstances both cars maximised their result.\n\n\nRBR - they usually have one or two off races during the season where pretty much everything goes wrong (pitstops, strategy, no pace). Let's see if this was that outlier or a preview of more to come. Nice to see that despite all that Yuki managed to finish in the points too.\xa0\n\n\nAlpine - their strongest race to date. Well executed for Gasly. Didn't quite managed to hold on to P6, but P7 is also a very strong result. I'm not sure what happened to Doohan tbh. I guess the tyres fell off, but didn't pay too close attention to his race.\n\n\nHAAS - team of the day if you ask me. They managed to turn around a pretty poor quali into a double points finish. Also helps to have two quality drivers (they've come far since 2021).\xa0\n\n\nSauber - rather anonymous. I wouldn't be able to tell where they finished without looking at the results.\xa0\n\n\nAston Martin - also pretty anonymous. A better race for Alonso than the previous three, but that's all there's to say on my part.\n\n\nWilliams - quite disappointing, tbh. I don't know if the pressure to perform is getting to Sainz, but as someone else said in a comment, it felt like KMag was back on track. Albon didn't quite manage to impress either,\xa0 but at least he made up a few positions after being robbed of a Q2 appearance.\n\n\nRB - also quite disappointing. Just didn’t seem to have the pace. I'm not sure if all the penalties Lawson received were fair compared to some other incident going unpunished, but even without these, it didn't look like he was having a good weekend.\n\n\nOverall, the race was very enjoyable with lots of action up and down the field. It only lacked a fight for the win.\xa0"", ""Well that was certainly a whole lot more eventful than Japan. \n\nI want to start off with Russells transponder not working. Holy shit does one transponder not working cause a lot of issues. First of all obviously the timing pages/broadcasts. It probably didn't help the TV direction either, with them not being able to spot the distances between cars reliably. But Norris and Leclerc having to guess whether they are within DRS distance of Russell was downright hilarious. I'm kind of hoping that they install some sort of backup for the transponder in the future because this was a mess. \n\nPiastri had a great weekend. I just had a look at the race pace for the weekend and depending on who's data you're looking at he had around 4 tenths on the nearest non McLaren. If not for the safety car that gap would've been a lot more than the 15s we had at the end. \n\nMeanwhile Norris had a messy weekend. I don't think I can use a better word to describe it. His qualifying wasn't it. He had a great start, negated it by starting out of his pit box and getting a 5s penalty. Overtook Hamilton off track and had to give it back. Had difficulties getting past both Leclerc and Russell, although that is also partly due to those two defending very well. Just not his weekend. Let's see if he can turn it around in Jeddah this week. \n\nRed Bull really screwed up everything they possibly could. I'm actually amazed that they didn't have some mechanical DNF of a random tyre falling off or something like that to complete the mess. Three bad pitstops. Not a great strategy with the hards, although they probably didn't have enough data on the tyre to predict how bad it was. Props to both Max and Yuki for finishing in the points. At one point I really thought Max' points finishing streak would be broken this weekend. \n\nFerarri did seem to be on point with their strategy, but the safety car kind of messed it up. Overall not too bad? Hopefully they can improve the car some more and actually challenge the McLarens. \n\nAlpine and Haas both had great weekends. Special shout out to Bearman because his p20 to p10 drive would've deserved driver of the day for me. Good strategy call with Ocon, undercutting a lot of people. \n\nDidn't really see anything from Hadjar this weekend. Lawson was messy. Sainz was in the wars and ended up with a penalty. Doohan did quite well, and seemingly his seat will be safe for a bit longer."", 'When everything, I mean everything turns to chaos. Everything F1 related was broken this weekend. That gave us some really good racing.']",20,96,0.84,20,96,96,4,14,0.029999999999999916,4
1jz4tzl,The 2025 Bahrain Grand Prix: In data,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jz4tzl/the_2025_bahrain_grand_prix_in_data/,2025-04-14, Technical,"Thought, I could do one of those after a GP.  
I left out the comparisons of AMR and Sauber because... not really much going on over there.

RBR is in a *bad* spot right now. Being slower than Alpine isn't any good. Comparing VER and GAS makes it visible, that Max absolutely had to give it all to overtake his old team mate. When looking over to the VER-TSU comparison: VER's Hard stint was absolutely awful. Which begs the question: Why did they not have enough Mediums left to go for a S-M-M strat? Many things going wrong right now at RBR.  
  
Piastri controlled the pace well enough to never be in any danger, but on paper, the Ferraris should have been in podium contention. Gasly told his RE, that Leclerc told him on the drivers parade, that they are looking at a one-stop. And LEC did ask to think about Plan Delta, when called to the box. Hülkenberg did a 30-lap-stint on Mediums, but I doubt, that would have been an option for the front-runners. Plus, the rather strange choice to put on Mediums again, which forces you to swap to a compound in the last stint, that you  might don't even want to put on.  
  
 Haas did everything right, with Bearman capitalizing on the SC-discounted pitstops, and having overall strong pace. Bearman was struggling at first, but then got his footing, being at times faster than his team mate.  
  
Antonelli got rather screwed over by the strategy department, with ditching the Mediums after just 15 laps and then having to pit again after just 5 laps. Turning a P5 into a P11 is not exactly spectacular.  
Russell was in serious trouble and, looking at the pace comparison between him and Norris, benefitted mostly by Norris' mistakes.","['Regarding the one stop.

When the car enters the pit box, the pit crew have to wait for the penalty time to elapse before they can touch the car. So McLaren's crew just sat frozen for five seconds until the FIA official with the stopwatch said it was okay. Then they do the pit stop and the penalty is done.\n\nIf the driver has already completed their last pit stop before they get a penalty, then the time gets added onto their final time at the end of the race.
