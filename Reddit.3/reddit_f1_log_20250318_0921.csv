1jdbu2n,Speculation:  Did lack of institutional memory contribute to Haas' struggles in Melbourne?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jdbu2n/speculation_did_lack_of_institutional_memory/,2025-03-17, Discussion,"OK first of all, definition

Institutional memory is the collective experience of all the personnel in an organization to handle a given situation.  It's the biggest thing you lose when experienced personnel head for greener pastures and their replacements have to do their learning the hard way, with little in the way of mentorship.

Awkward and unsatisfactory outcomes in the short term are usually the consequence of losing your institutional memory.

With that said, here's what we know.

Haas is rolling around not just with 2 brand new drivers, but also 2 brand new race engineers.  Gary Gannon and Mark Slade are both gone, replaced by new voices that weren't on the F1 grid last year.

Furthermore, many of the technical people, including technical chief Andrea de Zordo, have only 1 year of experience as Komatsu purged the team of Steiner's people.

I suspect one of the big reasons that Haas came out so flat, and by ""flat"" I mean the lack of pace that was a problem for Haas even without the rain, is because they have very little actual F1 experience anywhere in their squad right now.  This culminated in delays and isses with putting the right adjustments into the car as everyone struggles to communicate with everyone else and a lot of people are just kinda trying to figure things out on the fly that an experienced person would simply know what to say, or what to do.  The result is chaos.

Last year you at least had longtime veterans dotting the roster, especially Slade, Nico and Kevin who all had many years of experience in the league.  And if, say, Gannon's side of the paddock had issues and he had to reach beyond his own experience to address a problem, Mark was right there to ask.  R

ight now the only experienced person anywhere in their front of house at Haas is Esteban, who was on a different team last year.  With everyone all figuring it out together, there's no one to really lean on when one side of the paddock or the other is struggling to crack a tough problem.

That strikes me as a situation where getting a reliable setup for their cars is going to be extra tricky because you just don't have that longstanding experience to fall back on if the first attempt doesn't work.

Like if a driver isn't happy with a given setup, you need engineers who can think 2-3 adjustments ahead in order to figure out what can be quickly tried to get them back on the track with a better setup than they had before, and I'm not sure the Haas team has that right now.

Throw in the fact that Bearman is a rookie and Ocon isn't a native English speaker, with the attending problems in providing reliable feedback in the first place, and you have a perfect storm of ""learning curve issues"" with communication, feedback and adjustments that could easily hold a team back.

The good news is that these may not be experienced people, but they are talented people who should climb the learning curve relatively quickly.  Unfortunately for many of them, ""relatively quickly"" in this sport can be measured in seasons, not races.  By throwing so many inexperienced personnel into the deep end at once I think Haas may be in a situation where they're forced to use this year as a pure shakedown and focus almost exclusively on 2026, which is a pity for those of us who hoped for bigger things..","[""It definitely can't have helped. Getting both two new drivers and two new race engineers is a lot. Especially when 3 out of the 4 are essentially rookies in their field.\n\nBut Haas are also just tied to Ferrari development. When Ferrari aren't strong, like they don't seem to be now, Haas are always down as well."", "">Furthermore, many of the technical people, including technical chief Andrea de Zordo, have only 1 year of experience as Komatsu purged the team of Steiner's people.\n\nI thought this was odd last year when people were praising Komatsu for the performance of a car designed & built by Gunther's people in the offseason. 2023's was already fast over one lap but terrible in the race, 2024 managed to build upon that and fix some of the race pace issues. \n\nOne race isn't season defining, but so far it feels like a step back."", ""I'm sure someone will compile the laptime comparison charts and show how much laptime improvements each team has gained after we have had a couple of dry races. But my initial impression is that Haas has simply missed the boat and especially VCARB and Williams have gained even more relatively vs the top 4 teams let alone vs Haas and Alpine. In quali there were 17 cars within 1 sec from each other at some point, and that's almost unheard of in F1 history...\n\nCan't really blame it on the drivers though. Ollie had 6 (FP) weekends/races with the team last year, so he knows exactly how the current car compares to the previous one, including setups quirks. Ocon is a veteran nowadays and is at least or even more fluent in English than the likes of Barichello, Kimi and Massa who were known to give good feed back and were credited by drivers/TPs of developing the car or making setups."", 'Listening to the pit wall conversation with Ocon on him pushing to go back to slicks was frustrating. The wall needed to take charge (because they have a weather radar in front of them) rather than Ocon in that situation.\n\nI‚Äôm sure it will work itself out in due time, but it‚Äôs better to find and identify the issues now than after 16 races', ""Great assessment. I wasn't aware that Ayao got rid of so many veterans in the team--didn't he actually say in an interview or something that he wanted to promote people in-house, especially those who stayed loyal with Haas for all these years? And he didn't want look outside the team?"", 'Very well thought out post and it‚Äôs a very good point.\xa0', 'All very good points, but Ocon should very much be counted as veteran and should be able to give good feedback. His language skills are as far as I can judge it on par with many of the other non-english on the grid.\n\nAlso the Ferrari parts on the Haas should be factored in. Your point makes this even stronger as they probably rely even stronger on Ferrari experience.', ""100% agree. Despite it still being only one weekend, I will also add that Komatsu may have underestimated the jump that other teams could make from last year to this year.\n\nAlpine went to 6th thanks only to that double podium, but their following races showed a pace that clearly justified it. Their car was always set to take off for this year.\n\nWilliams had just signed Sainz, not just a former Ferrari driver, but someone that has worked with many a different teams. I didnt expect the jump they did, but I dont think anyone could doubt that they were set to evolve for this year and the next.\n\nRacing Bulls decided to follow up with RBR's leftovers of the RB20, and Tsunoda did get the chance to drive the RB20, so his feedback may have helped avoid some of its pitfalls.\n\nSauber, post pre season testing, decided to fast forward their upgrades after seeing just how far behind everyone they were. If those were continuations from Bottas's feedback, and you combine that with Hulk's feedback, then that car managed to find the window to properly evolve\n\nMeanwhile, Haas decided to not follow up with Ferrari's suspension evolutions, and instead produce their own. A very risky bet that may be very hard to salvage themselves from right now."", ""Haas isn't really incentivized to do much this year. With so much change and a new rule book next year, they might as well throw it all into Next Year's Car^(TM).""]",38,37,0.72,38,190,190,4,0,0.020000000000000018,4
