I  think its often forgotten but there were some weekends where he was so untouchable it was like watching Michael in his prime agian. \n\nBut Seb just seemed to have a considerably narrower window in terms of car feel where he could actually fully unleash his abilities.

For starters, the race head to head is skewed as such because of Seb's insanely poor luck in races, both in terms of DNFs, contact from other drivers ramming into him, and Aston's horrible strategy gambles. \n\nLooking at 2021 alone which accounts for Seb's losing race h2h overall against Stroll, there are numerous incidents which highlight the misfortune Seb faced. We have him being taken out by Tsunoda in Jeddah, being hit by Raikkonen at Austria, being nearly put into the wall by Stroll in Zandvoort, *actually* being put into the wall by Stroll in Sochi, then being hit by Ocon, Mick and Stroll one after the other in Monza, and the hail mary strategy in Turkey, and to top it off he was shoved off the track to start the race in Qatar. With the exception of Zandvoort, Seb was running ahead of Stroll in *all* these scenarios I just detailed until rotten luck and/or shitty driving by the chumps I mentioned above wrecked his day. \n\nThen there's additional context regarding Stroll. For starters, he's been dealing with a number of nagging wrist injuries these past couple years. Has this been negatively affecting his performance, probably, it's more likely a question of how much his performance is being impacted. I think the performance gap growing versus Alonso is explained by both Stroll being a worse driver right now than he was a few years ago, and Alonso operating at a slightly higher level than Seb was in 21/22. When taking these nuances into account, I still think Alonso has been a better driver on balance than Seb these past few years compared to Seb in 21/22, but not by as much as stats like this allege.""]",894,328,0.85,894,301,301,8,8,0.0,8

Further, half of the drivers aren't having their sector times shown on the bottom of the screen. Even when all the slots for the times were empty. WTF?

There will be drivers on hotlaps, and ZERO sector timings being shown on the screen, while the camera is focused on a car doing an inlap or outlap.

If anyone from F1 production is somehow reading this: This is not difficult. You need to do two things.

1. Show the lap times for the entire session.
2. Show the sector times of the next 3 drivers to finish a hotlap.

Please for the love of god just do these two things. It doesn't even require interaction, it should all be automatic. I should not be required to pull up the timings on my phone just so I can see this BASIC information.

IF max wins all the remaining races he will end on 447 points.

This scenario would leave norris with a maximum of 422 points with all 3rd places.

In another scenario i wanted to see what would happen if piastri gets all 3rd places, and lando all 2nd places. This would make max the world champion with 447, Piastri with 444 and Lando with 443 - 4 points separating the top 3.   
In this scenario piastri would just need 1 2nd place finish to tie with max aswell with both on 447. This would still make max WDC with more race wins.

Ofcourse this will not happen, but the error margin for all drivers is so small at this point. One DSQ and the other 2 drivers are clear favorites. Piastri just needs to finish 3rd in every race except 2 where he needs to finish 2nd or better.

Since Miami he gap over one lap is -0.07% which is a very respectable gap. Over a race distance he‚Äôs struggled a bit more but has still done well. \n\nI think it just depends on what you expect. I think he‚Äôs past his prime and we will see flashes of brilliance. I also think in the grand scheme of things, he‚Äôs still a top driver on the grid but just not elite anymore like he was from 2007 to 2023.', 'Because Ferrari changed the whole rear suspension after realizing the one on the SF24 had reached the ceiling of performance, and instead of going as far forward as they would have desired, they went backwards in relation to other teams. If 2026 had been a continuation year of current regulations, the SF26 would probably have been a very strong performer, but with the whole new set of rules for next year, it is a complete unknown.', 'Hamilton has made decent progress since the summer break. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he‚Äôs quicker than Charles in the last three or four races of the season', 'Dude he is slowly matching / slightly behind Charles who is probably in his prime.\xa0 So I think Lewis is doing quite great for his age. His race pace is only probably slightly worse. His quali issues persist and gotten worse. But overall I think if Ferrari delivers a no 1 car, Charles will have a huge competition from Lewis in almost every track. Unfortunately Ferrari is lift and coasting all throughout 2025.', ""I think he's just not good at the ground effect cars. Look at the rule changes he went through, have we ever seen him perform at this level? He's still had good moments here and there but almost nothing like the Lewis we know pre-2022.""]",0,109,0.27,0,82,82,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
