We all know they were dominant, but it really hit me watching the race again how much of an edge they had.

If you watch *turns 3 and 4*, it's pretty clear how much faster Mercedes was than the rest of the field. Hamilton and Rosberg were already pulling away, and it wasn’t even close. The gap they built up, even early in the race, was impressive. It’s wild to think back to how much quicker they were compared to everyone else, even on a track like Bahrain.

It made me wonder – what other races do people remember where a team was just so much faster than everyone else? I feel like we sometimes forget how dominant Mercedes was in 2014 with how things have shifted in recent years.
