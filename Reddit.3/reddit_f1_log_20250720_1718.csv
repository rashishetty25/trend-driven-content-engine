Otherwise, here‚Äôs the full context of all his past races based on radios and post-race debriefs in the media\n\nSilverstone - Was having a very solid race and a very good pace. Maximized the car during quali and started P9. Was well into the points until Charles took them both out.\n\nAustria - Something was wrong with the brakes before quali even started. Didn‚Äôt even start the race because the car got on fire\n\nCanada - Got impeded during qualifying and was subsequently knocked out of Q1. Had to start the race from the back of the pack, but showed good pace with the car and managed to climb up to p10 even though he was doing a lot of LICO because the car had a lot of unresolved cooling issues\n\nBarcelona - Got held up in the pitlane because Alpine had issues during qualifying and had to do his final quali lap with a lot of traffic (for added context, the Williams car is not good in that circuit so everything had to be perfect). Last safety car in the race could have been an opportune moment to get in the points but there was a lot of delayed action coming from the pitwall.\n\nMonaco - Mostly on the driver during quali that got him knocked out at Q2. Couldn‚Äôt get the softs on this track.\n\nImola - Beautiful qualifying. Truly on top of the car now, but was extremely unlucky with the safety car in the race that turned his p6 start into a p8 finish\n\nMiami - Miami sprint mistakes were mostly on him‚Äî however he quickly bounced back for quali and started p6. However he had to start the race with old mediums because the team placed the wrong tyre on him during the sprint. In addition, he collected damage from his teammate and experienced time loss of about 3 tenths per lap. He was also unlucky with the safety car again\n\nSaudi - Incredible qualifying with a p6 start again. However the car couldn‚Äôt really compete with the top cars for this track and had to end the race with a p8. However, it was a really clean race. The only problem was the 6 seconds pitstop\n\nBahrain - Furst time he really got a hang of qualifying. P8 start. But then, him and Yuki had a racing incident when Yuki lost the car and he had to DNF\n\nJapan - Team didnt tell him about Hamilton so he got a penalty for impeding. If he started where he should have then points could have been in the table especially since he was one of the few who managed to put out multiple overtakes despite the track not being overtake friendly\n\nChina - Seat was unattached during quali and was told to LICO multiple times during the race (highly implied that they miscalculated the amount of fuel needed)\n\nAustralia - Lack of familiarity with the merc engine made him DNF. However he helped maximize team points by calling for the right strategy.', ""Sainz' performance is a bit of a shocker honestly. I expected both to be matched (especially as his 2018 year did not look particularly good against Hulk with 5 less DNFs) evenly and Albon having team advantage, but this is not good."", 'Go Weeyums!', ""I always remember a behind the scenes bit where sainz was moaning about having to do autograph signings or something and leclerc had to point out to him how lucky they were to be F1 drivers and it's always stuck with me about him.

1m4tpe0,What are the ideal F1 regulations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m4tpe0/what_are_the_ideal_f1_regulations/,2025-07-20, Discussion,"With all the buzz around the 2026 regulations, I‚Äôve been thinking ahead: what could - or should- the ideal F1 regulations be? 

Here's my own proposal to kick things off:

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Pure V12 powertrain**

**2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Minimum weight: 600 kg**

**3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Significantly smaller dimensions**

**4.¬†¬†¬†¬† X and Z mode**

**5.¬†¬†¬†¬† Downforce Increasing System (DIS)**

**6.¬†¬†¬†¬† Liquid Cooling System (LCS)**  


This post is a thought experiment meant to spark discussion, not an actual proposal to the FIA. I am aware that such drastic changes are unlikely to come in the next set of regulations, however I believe they would create more entertaining races. My arguments are as follows:

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Pure V12 powertrain**

A naturally aspirated V12 would drastically reduce weight and bring back the sound and soul of F1. The car could retain a small battery system if needed. The environmental impact could be addressed through a restructured race calendar.

**2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Minimum weight: 600 kg**

Modern F1 cars are approaching 800 kg ‚Äî nearly **200 kg heavier** than 20 years ago. Dropping the weight to 600 kg would improve agility, tire management, breaking distance and overtaking. The weight reduction would primarily come from downsizing and powertrain changes.

**3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Smaller dimensions**

Today‚Äôs cars are *enormous* (over 5.5 meters long). I'd propose something similar to the sizes 30 to 40 years ago:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Length**: 4.2 ‚Äì 4.6m

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Width**: 1.7m

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Wheelbase**: 2.8m

This would reduce dirty air and tighten racing lines, especially in street circuits.

**4.¬†¬†¬†¬† X and Z mode**

This is one thing i would like to keep from the 2026 regulations. Active aero improves perfomance and energy deployment. Yes, they reduce slipstreaming a bit, but they also open up new racing styles.

**5.¬†¬†¬†¬† DIS**

DRS helps on straights ‚Äî but it‚Äôs in corners where following cars truly struggle in dirty air. The Downforce Increasing System (DIS) would replace DRS and activate in selected corners when the gap is under 1 second, enhancing grip through increased ground effect. The floor is the ideal area to target, as it‚Äôs less sensitive to turbulent air. DIS could work by temporarily lowering the car‚Äôs ride height to boost ground effect, or by activating ducting that channels additional airflow into the venturi tunnels of the floor.

This could lead to *more overtakes in corners*, which are far more exciting and technically impressive than the typical DRS passes on the straights.

**6.¬†¬†¬†¬† LCS**

Following a car leads to heat buildup and faster tire degradation, which LCS would reduce. LCS would activate when within 3-5 seconds of a car ahead, and it will use water to maintain the temperature of the tires or the brake ducts.

This might be an overly complex solution, but it would incentivize closer racing and level the playing field in longer duels without giving an outright performance boost.

I am aware that such drastic changes are unlikely to come in the next cycle of regulations, however this is a thought experiment, not an actual proposal to the FIA. I would love to hear what rule changes you would like to see. This is my first post here so please be gentle
