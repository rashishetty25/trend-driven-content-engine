And if Christian survives that, it only boosts the chances of him getting to sign Max, the driver he’s dreamt of having for more than a decade. \n\nHe must be savouring watching Christian getting slowly stitched up like this with his help and knowing he’s choosing between a decent win and an enormous one.', '> In principle, the world champion would like to stay with the brand that paved his way into Formula 1 and for which he\'s now in his eleventh year. In the future, apparently, only under one condition: The team must reposition itself strategically. This is said to include the demand that team boss Christian Horner either be replaced or have his powers curtailed.\n\nMarko might yet win after all.\n\nMark Hughes wrote this a year+ ago that fundamentally the question posed to RBR\'s owners was: take short-term pain and lose Verstappen but keep Horner, or lose Horner, the fundamental architect of RBR as we know it. Verstappen could be gone from F1 in 5 years, or another generational talent comes along, whereas Horner could still be in F1 in 10 years, and without him RBR are truly...who? What? \n\nI think Wolff\'s slightly backed into a corner that okay Russell is doing absolutely sufficiently to be kept, but even the possibility of *not having Verstappen as a rival* is critical.\n\nI genuinely believe various rumours have been true in the past but changed with time, e.g. Jon Noble said a while ago the AM/Verstappen rumours *were* true, but they\'re just so down in the dumps that all of that cooled off. Similarly a month or two ago the story seemed to be that Verstappen was going to see how things looked mid 2026 and decide then - fine, sensible - but the Merc being ahead stories are *so* prevalent that he might as well get on with it. The engines are in the 3rd trimester at this point. \n\nVerstappen to Merc 2026 would be only halfway down the wild driver transfer stories, over the years.\n\nI liked the point someone made ages ago, like: if you subtract the Dutch/Verstappen, who here is a *Red Bull* fan per se?\n\n> Horner believes that Mercedes has long since reached an agreement with its drivers, but is holding back on an official announcement to lull Red Bull into uncertainty. ""Furthermore, George isn\'t researching the market intensively enough. If he was worried about his place, he would look for alternatives."" Russell confirms this: ""There have been inquiries from other teams, but I\'ve told everyone that Mercedes is my first choice.""\n\nI do personally think that the extent to which Horner has been happy to badmouth Russell in the last year or so, implies he\'s not expecting to phone him any time soon.\n\n> In principle, the world champion would like to stay with the brand that paved his way into Formula 1 \n\nInteresting line from the Dutch guy on The Race recently, that a) there was a sense going into 2025 that we\'d see if RBR could correct the slide from 2024, or rather that their fundamental level is now kind of 4th, and b) that Verstappen is worried that their slide is not merely speed, but operationally they\'re not what they were in 2023.', 'Nothing like a statement headline with a what if opening line.', 'Can we just ban these shitty clickbait articles', 'Mercedes could do the funniest thing by bringing back the man, the legend, Cyril Abiteboul.', ""I really hope Max joins Merc.

The Verstappen clan is reportedly demanding internal restructuring, which would primarily affect team boss Christian Horner.\n\nMichael Schmidt\n\nMax Verstappen is the most expensive and best driver in Formula 1. Even George Russell recently said that the Dutchman would be at the top of every team's list if he were available and there were still cockpits available. However, Verstappen is not actually available. He is still under contract with Red Bull for three years.\n\n***However, there is still a small window of opportunity to leave the team. To do so, Verstappen must be ranked lower than third in the drivers' standings by the end of July.*** That is not the case at the moment. But Russell is only nine championship points behind and the McLaren drivers are out of reach. This is stirring the imagination in the paddock. For weeks, there has been speculation about whether Verstappen might still end up at Mercedes.\n\nMax Verstappen is tired of hearing the Mercedes question. ‘I don't think we need to talk about that anymore. Shall I repeat what I said last year? It's the same answer. I'm concentrating on driving. Then at some point, the time will come to think about next year.’\n\nHe is just as unwilling to make a clear commitment to Red Bull as he is to confirm whether he is in talks with Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. Toto Wolff also has no desire to add fuel to the fire. ‘Everything is going according to plan. Contract negotiations are not held as public town hall meetings.’\n\n***According to Toto Wolff, negotiations with George Russell are still on schedule.***\n\n**Who would have to make way at Mercedes?**\n\nThe Austrian does not want to comment specifically on talks with Verstappen. Of course they are taking place. Wolff would be a poor team boss if he did not explore all options. But he also knows that he currently lacks the arguments to show George Russell the door.\n\nThe Englishman is driving in the form of his life. Verstappen and Russell in one team would be the best possible driver pairing and a strong counterweight to McLaren and Ferrari. But, as Alex Albon once put it, there would also be a great risk of fireworks.\n\nIf Russell had to leave, Mercedes could jeopardise Andrea Kimi Antonelli's career by signing Verstappen. ‘Everyone looks bad against Max. For Antonelli, Verstappen would come too early in his second year,’ says Red Bull sporting director Helmut Marko.""]",365,176,0.86,365,2916,2916,23,5,0.010000000000000009,23

1lo4vqd,Esteban Ocon – The Hidden Midfield Maestro of 2025?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lo4vqd/esteban_ocon_the_hidden_midfield_maestro_of_2025/,2025-06-30, Statistics,"If you’ve been casually checking the race results this season, you might think Esteban Ocon’s performances have been a bit erratic. Haas hasn’t been grabbing headlines, and Ocon’s final race positions often put him mid-pack at best.

But if you dig into the numbers – like his +7 gain at the Austrian GP yesterday – a very different story begins to unfold.

Ocon’s race day consistency has actually been one of the most impressive in the midfield this year – it’s just masked by Haas’s weaker qualifying pace. Across all races so far in 2025, Ocon has gained an average of +3 positions per race, with a median gain of +5. That means more often than not, he’s making solid progress through the field regardless of where he starts.

He’s only lost positions in two races this season (Miami and Emilia Romagna), and in all others, he’s finished higher than he qualified. That kind of consistency shows real race craft – smart decisions, clean overtakes, and the ability to manage tyre and pace well during the race. It also suggests Haas might be making the most of race-day strategies, capitalising on clean air, undercuts or well-timed stops to help their drivers gain ground.

It suggests that qualifying is where Haas – and Ocon – are struggling most. But come Sunday, he’s one of the sharpest tools on the grid in terms of navigating through traffic and maximising opportunities.

He's not in the spotlight much, but maybe he should be. There’s something quietly impressive about drivers who maximise what they’ve got, and Ocon is quietly becoming one of the most dependable racers this season.

Would love to hear what others think – has he been under the radar, or are the midfield margins just too tight to stand out?","['absolutely wild way to orient a chart.', 'SO happy he left Alpine. He seems much happier', 'You can\'t really assess his ""race finish"" position in Emilia-Romagna, mostly because he didn\'t finish.\n\nOcon seems to be struggling in qualifying, but that\'s possibly due to three major factors:\n\n* Midfield is really tight, last week in Q1 there was only 0.312s between 3rd Lawson and 16th Stroll (first driver dropping out in Q1), with P17 Ocon (+0.347) and P18 Tsunoda (+0.352) also being really close. For comparison, 3rd Lawson was +0.345 slower than fastest Norris. Sure, on longer tracks gap seems to be relatively bigger, but even on ""longer"" track like Jeddah, between 5th Sainz and 16th Stroll, there also was only 0.4s gap.\n* Haas doesn\'t look like a good qualifying car in general. During *Steiner Era*, they often shone in qualifying, but later struggled with tyre wear in the race. That started to change with last year\'s car, focusing more on keeping tyres within operating temperature range. That cost them with qualifying performance, as it makes more difficult firing up the tyres. \n* Ocon struggles to keep up his quali pace compared to Bearman. Ollie often looks great in qualifying, especially with performances like Japan. This could be related to their driving styles, because...\n\nOcon looks like better tyre preserver of two Haas drivers. After the race, he was pretty convinced that they could\'ve gone for 1 stopper, but they would have to make 1st stint longer. Ollie seems to be struggling in that area a bit more, which is understandable, as he still is a relatively unexperienced driver, at least compared to a driver that\'s hanging around for like 9 years, having completed 150+ races.\n\nAnd one more thing - obviously, you\'re more likely to gain positions when you\'re starting P18 rather than when you\'re starting P7, but that\'s not changing one simple fact. He\'s sitting P9, ahead of faster cars in inexperienced hands (Hadjar), or experienced hands having even more inconsistent car (Alonso). Question remains how long will he be able to stay on that P9, as Sauber\'s form is significantly improving (Hulkenberg scored in last 3 races, including a cracking race in Spain), and Sainz at one moment will definitely get more luck and start scoring bigger points.', 'He has been very impressive in races but not seen much by the camera. A bit of a more subdued version of what Sainz used to be in 2019.\xa0\n\nThe fact that Bearman often outqualifies him and sometimes by a lot of places is worrying for Esteban, but he’s usually better in races. \xa0Haas as a team seem much much better in races than qualifyings.\xa0\n\nOcon’s performances in both China and Monaco are two of the best of the season. In China he got P5 after the Ferraris were disqualified and he made one of the best overtakes of the season on Antonelli.\xa0\n\nAnd in Monaco I do not think the car was as good as he made it look. Ocon’s always been really REALLY good around Monte Carlo and he’s a specialist around those streets.\xa0\n\nOverall he’s for sure in the conversation for a top ten driver this year. For me he falls somewhere in the 6-12 region, probably towards the bottom half of that.\xa0\n\nI feel as though Gasly and Ocon are a bit like the Perez and Hulkeburg of the 2010’s.', 'This data visualization is absolutely diabolical 💀', '“Maestro” feels like a bit of an overstatement', 'The chart just seems like his results vary up and down each race.

Now that the dust (and smoke) has settled at the Red Bull Ring, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more **detailed and thoughtful discussion** than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Please avoid low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').","[""That was a decent race. First part of the race with Piastri actually being in the DRS of Norris was really fun. I just felt a bit disappointed after the race that Piastri never got back into DRS after the first round of pitstops. I really wanted a close drs battle till the end but we never got it.\n\nI've already mentioned it in another thread yesterday, but backmarkers are frustrating me this season. Watch your mirrors! Listen to your race engineer! Why do they have to almost take the race leaders out?\n\nAlso can I just say that the Red Bull Ring is one of the best tracks we currently have for racing? There isn't just one overtaking opportunity. There are only a few real corners, but the track gives the option for battles to go on for multiple corners and makes the drivers have to actually think about where they overtake another car. I'm happy that it got renewed until 2041. And if we need to have sprints, can we please have it in Austria again next year? It's one of the best places for it."", 'There were a lot of comments in the Race Thread and Post-Race Thread from people who were unhappy with Oscar\'s strategy and with the radios from McLaren about Oscar\'s flatspot. They thought that McLaren should have called Oscar in immediately after the flatspot. There also seems to be a bit of confusion about the sequence of events, so I went on the onboards to have a look and listen. \n\nLando and Will begin discussing their pit options on Lap 19. At the beginning of Lap 20, Will signals to Lando that he will pit soon. In the middle of Lap 20, Lando gets explicit instructions to box. \n\nImmediately after that, Oscar tries the (at best, ambitious) maneuver that gets him his flatspot. The McLarens continue on for the rest of the half lap. While Lando approaches the pit entry, Oscar gets told that Lando will pit and to see how he does in free air. \n\nSome might say that Oscar could have been told to pit immediately after he got the flatspot. That doesn\'t make sense though. His situation wasn\'t a dire one that necessitated an immediate pit. Furthermore, the mechanics were already in place with Lando\'s tires. Pitting Oscar first would increase chances of a mix-up.\n\nNow, Oscar doesn\'t respond until he gets to the end of the lap. As Tom reiterates that he wants best pace until target lap, Oscar tells him about the flat spot. Tom tells him to see how he does in clear air. \n\nIn the second sector, Tom tells him that the flatspot doesn\'t seem bad on the data and tells Oscar to ""let him know."" In the third sector, Oscar says that it\'s not pleasant but okay. They then do not pit at the end of Lap 21. \n\nThis is supported by the data that shows Oscar go faster than the previous laps and also faster than Lando\'s inlap. \n\nI assume that if Oscar had said or performed otherwise, they would have pitted on Lap 23. Remember that McLaren was also not ready to double-stack since they were presumably already in front of the box with Lando\'s tires when Oscar made his move. Thus, Lap 23 would have been the earliest (safest) time for them to pit.\n\nOn Lap 22, Oscar gets asked the 4 with delta vs. 1.5 behind question. He answers it at the end of Lap 22: 4 with delta.\n\nFor me, McLaren\'s actions seem very reasonable.', ""something is seriously wrong with the Alpine car. Last 2-3 races I think an argument could be made it's legitimatley the slowest car on the grid."", ""On a positive note, Racing Bulls are finding their footing in several places. It is fantastic to see Lawson get those points, and it bodes well for the sister team, knowing that not only Lawson does have his star moments for solid drives, but he and Hadjar can respectfully work on those collectively, whilst building up confidence and experience on their own as an individual driver. \n\nI don't normally agree with terms branded by the viewers of the sport, but in this instance, there is very little wonder why people are labelling a move to Red Bull from the sister team as a *demotion*. \n\nMore of this from VCARB, please! Sauber and VCARB picking up the pace is fun for the midfield battle in the standings, and I am excited to see them hop into the mix"", 'McLaren are handling it all ok so far, but if Oscar and Lando remain this close up to the last races, it will be all out war.', 'I know there have been some complaints about the message to Oscar about the move in turn 4 being too marginal, but I genuinely think/wonder if this is something they\'ve talked and agreed about as a team (either at the start of the season, or at the very least after Canada) that they will receive that kind of feedback in race if the situation warrants it. Andrea Stella has said in interviews that they have ""written our racing principles together with our drivers"", so it seems to me Lando and Oscar feel a strong sense of responsibility to be able to have such freedom to race and they take that responsibility seriously. I think Oscar and Lando know exactly how unique the situation they\'ve found themselves in with such freedom to race (without the need for the team to be too worried about other teams/drivers) and they don\'t take that lightly.', ""On a different topic I haven't really seen discussed too much, Williams had an absolutely terrible weekend. To multiple problems with Carlos's car starting in quali (I think he damaged it in a trip through the gravel), his car blowing up before the race, and Alex having a mechanical failure while he was P6, forcing him to retire. Hoping they rebound and have a good home race for Silverstone."", 'I’ve come to the realisation that a championship battle just between team mates is going to be a bit stale, unless they run each other off the road. \n\nThe drivers are so closely matched and cars the same that overtaking will be hard unless there is a tire offset. problem is the team will favour the lead driver strategy wise and the trailing driver will have to make a strategy work off the back of it. \n\nIt would have been a different race if Oscar could have pit first and undercut Lando which I’m sure they would have done if it was max that Oscar was chasing.', ""I may be mistaken, but at one point toward the end of the race, I thought there was a situation where Lando was lapping a group of three cars, and when he got by the final one, that car then looked to be trying to overtake Lando again and the commentary said that driver does have the right to try to unlap himself.\n\nAm I misremembering and/or misunderstanding something? It seems nonsensical that a car overtaken under a blue flag would be allowed to (immediately) pass the lead car again, since then you're right back into the blue flag where he has to let the leader by."", 'Very interested to see Bortoleto’s career. He might be the next great driver to come out of South America. I underestimated his quali pace, which is already quite decent compared to Hulk who is one of the top 1 lap guy. In junior career his race management was what stood out somewhat like Piastri. He very well might go to a top team in 3-4 years. Great rookie crop.

Baku, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi, Abu Dhabi (5 races)

China, Japan, Singapore, Australia (4 races)

Canada, Mexico, Brazil, US x3 (6 races)

[Rightly] lots of Europe (9 races)

These now look like 4 logical race series that make up the world championship. A European series, an American series, a Pacific Series, and a West Asian series. If the fixtures were shuffled so that these blocks were run consecutively, the logistics would get cheaper and the environmental impact would be lower - but I think it has more potential to generate interest in ""continental"" points/trophies. Winning all 4 series in a year would be a ""Grand Slam"" season for a driver/team - a more challenging thing to achieve than ""just"" taking the world title, especially for drivers in leading teams with a fairly evenly matched driver in the other car. 

There would be 4 end-of-series races that are much more likely to be a down-to-the-wire points shootout than the final race of the season is. Teams not in title contention could split their 2nd seat between drivers to hire a local and boost interest / sponsorship. There's another set of sponsorship opportunities for the series themselves too.

Could anyone see this happening? ","['There are other factors\nWet/rain season - Japan, Miami.

I like the idea about hyping up different things in a Grand Slam type way. But, like with golf and tennis, a grand slam doesn\'t mean they\'re together in the calendar, it generally means throughout the calendar, so I don\'t think it would need to be for this either. There could be regional leaderboards for driver and constructor. Note that Africa might be added, so that would have to be given a region. South Africa doesn\'t exactly fit geographically with anything else, but that doesn\'t mean it shouldn\'t be added to the calendar. If something was going to by hyped up with separate leaderboards, I think rather than location, street circuit vs road course could be it. There\'s a lot of middle ground honestly in F1, and some ""street"" circuits are actually more like traditional circuits, because some are purpose built, but they could assign them.\n\nScheduling alone is a difficult mathematic problem. Venues have other events. There\'s weather patterns to consider.\n\nThen there\'s the thing people here never talk about. Monza and Imola have been very far apart in the calendar for good reason. Because I\'m sure it\'s one of the more likely races for people to go to both of. If you had them on back to back weeks, don\'t you think more people would go to both? Spa and Zandvoort are on opposite sides of summer break as well.\n\nYou might say, yeah, that make sense, we can jump around Europe because everything in Europe is close enough together, so we can avoid putting races near each other next to each other to improve fan experience. But then, when you do that, you\'re admitting that you don\'t mind making it better for Europe, but not for the rest of the world.\n\nIf someone in Australia is going to go to two races, the second is probably Singapore, third is Japan. If you have them back to back weeks, people are much less likely to go to more than one.\n\nIf someone in North America goes to multiple races, it\'s probably two in North America for most of them. If all of them are back to back to back, that makes it much less likely. They are trying Miami and Canada together next year, so we\'ll see how that goes. Except, as always when there\'s a week or more between races, all the drivers and most of the staff will go back to Europe between races. People just don\'t want to be away from home that long when there are two weekends off.', ""Tell me you don't understand climate without telling me you don't understand climate""]",0,22,0.31,0,86,86,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
1lo20vs,Bit of a philosophy question: The next Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lo20vs/bit_of_a_philosophy_question_the_next_verstappen/,2025-06-30, Discussion,"From the surge of the new rookies, one thing we are hearing all the time: He could be the next Verstappen. Antonelli, Lintblad and most recently Dunne. Effect of Max is pretty obvious on F1. But his start of the career wasnt that much different to other recent champions. Few years getting established and then win several titles. Senna, Schumacher, Alonso, Vettel all did it. Hamilton came 2nd in his 1st season and won the next one (but had to wait from more championships few years afterwards).

The real difference is the age. Max came in as 16yo. Unheard of. 

He opened the door to teenage drivers in F1. Every teenager will now be compared to him.

So my question is: What will be required from the future driver to be hailed the next ""Supertalent""? What will it take to change to question from ""Is he the next Verstappen?"" to ""Is he the next Robin Raikonnen?"" (replace Robin with whoever will be the next big thing)

Toto Showed he is willing to give the top seat to a rookie. This might open the door for the opportunities. In my opinion it would have to be a driver that comes very young, under 20 years old and starts challenging the top driver the 1st/2nd season. Like Max did to Hamilton once he was in Red Bull. And he will need to beat Vettels record of youngest champion. 

  
Is this just my recency bias? Before Max, was this being done to everybody? Was Max hailed as next Vettel/Alonso? Was Hamilton hailed next Schumacher? Schumacher next Senna? Senna next Lauda?","['There\'s always the ""exciting rookie"" in F1, although it\'s more rare to have hype for a ""future GOAT rookie"" prospect.\n\nI probably will miss a few names in the time I watched, but Schumacher was definitely propped as ""GOAT rookie"" in 1992, while his few races in 1991 left more of a ""exciting rookie"" vibe.\n\nVilleneuve was ""exciting"", but never really viewed as GOAT stuff, even when winning the title in his 2nd year.\n\nThe next hyped ""GOAT"" rookie was probably Raikkonen. Alonso wasn\'t really hyped up much until his return after his rookie year in Minardi. We all knew he is good, but couldn\'t really be sure how good due to that car.\n\nMontoya was an interesting case where he wasn\'t exactly a rookie when he joined, but had a much greater career expected for him.\n\nHamilton was obviously a GOAT rookie expectation from the start.\n\nVettel actually was viewed more in the ""exciting"" category initially, but his results in his first season tipped the scales to ""could he be a GOAT prospect?"".\n\nNext was Verstappen in 2015 with all the hype.\n\nBelieve it or not, but Van Doorne was as close to GOAT rookie expectation as one can get, considering what followed for him.\n\nThen it\'s Leclerc that came closest to GOAT rookie prospect, although at that time Verstappen had kinda changed the curve and everyone was compared to him, which maybe affected how Leclerc is viewed. This is true for the like of Russell as well.', ""I don't know. Verstappen arrived long after people stopped asking about the next Schumacher, which is what he is"", 'Raikkonen and Alonso were known to be young when they started F1 as well, being 21 and 19 respectively. There were articles about how early they started, whether it’s the right choice to promote them so soon and if they would cause too many crashes \n\nhttps://time.com/archive/6951777/young-men-in-a-hurry/', 'Brother there wont ever be the next Verstappen, he won everything in one of the toughest karting eras and got fast tracked to a stacked F1 grid and came out on top. Enjoy every moment of his career while you can because the gap he leaves won’t get replaced.', 'I think saying ""*Person A* is the next *Person B*"" is a bit silly. People were saying Verstappen is the next Senna. Is he? Or is he just Max Verstappen?', ""Many drivers (including several of this year's rookies) have been hailed as future superstars at various points. The truth is that not everyone can make it to the top, and it's what they do once they're on the grid that really matters.\n\nFor every Verstappen, Hamilton, Vettel or Raikkonen who come into F1 touted as future world champions and actually achieve it, there's a Vandoorne, Magnussen, Hulkenberg or a Kvyat who either fall by the wayside or never come close to fighting for race wins/championships. Some, like Robin Frijns or Antonio Felix da Costa, never even make the grid.\n\nAntonelli, Hadjar, Bortoleto and Bearman are a notably impressive group of rookies. Are there likely future WDC/race winners among them? Yes, but history and logic tells you that all four of them are highly unlikely to end up anywhere near the GOAT conversation by the time they retire.\n\nAs for the next GOAT contender who hasn't made it yet, Lindblad looks very promising, as does Slater, but there was a time not too long ago when the same thing was being said about Theo Pourchaire."", 'Lots of drivers get the ""potential next Verstappen/Schumacher/Hamilton"" tag, but it rarely sticks. It\'s a shorthand for ""Given the right circumstances, this guy could be the real deal"". But in the 30 years I\'ve been watching, there have been a few drivers that have left little doubt from their first races that they were future greats - Alonso, Hamilton, Max, Seb. I can\'t think of any others that arrived with the same sense of certainty.', 'Laughed out loud at the mention of Dunne.', ""I think Freddie Slater will be the next generational talent. \n\nNo doubt he will have his own career path though. It won't run parallel to Verstappen's. \n\nin terms of showing he's a generational talent... I guess getting up to speed quickly and blowing his teammates out the water. Verstappen was actually a bit different in this regard as he entered f1 so young he did a lot of his growing as a driver under the spotlight. Someone like Hamilton came in much further along in his development and almost won the championship in his rookie year. Alonso was an outsider for the championship in the 4th best car in just his second season.""]",0,102,0.19,0,419,419,0,0,0.0,0
