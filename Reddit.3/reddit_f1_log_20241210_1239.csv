1ha8fay,"The ""Best of 11"" rule that changed the outcome of World Championships",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ha8fay/the_best_of_11_rule_that_changed_the_outcome_of/,2024-12-09, Throwback,"Watching the Senna documentary took me down a very interesting rabbit hole that I was completely oblivious about: the best of 11 rule, also known as the the ""dropped points"" era of F1.

This rule, which was in place for most of F1's history (1950-1991), means that to count points towards the World Championship, you only count points from your 11 best results, leaving the rest as 0s on your tally. This created interesting scenarios where a driver might be driving 4th, but because all his best results were podiums, he would not gain any points and he was incentivized to go risk it for 3rd place.

  
The most famous case of this rule was probably 1988, Senna's first WDC, where Prost outscored the Brazilian handsomely (105 vs 94) but lost the championship (87 vs 90) when applying the 'best of 11 rule'.

  
I was curious to see how this rule would have impacted the 2000s championships, so I went ahead and calculated the points tally with this new system. Here are the most interesting outcomes.

  
NOTE: ""Best of 11"" was adjusted from time to time in F1 and it was based, naturally, on the number of total races. For example, in the 60, 70s they used 'best of 8' and 'best of 9'. The number of races has increased exponentially since then, especially in the 2010s, but for simplicity's and entertainment's sake, we will maintain the 11 threshold.

Felipe's lawyers need to find out who was responsible for dropping the 'best of 11' rule.

Couldn’t find any evidence of them online. Photo 1 is Peter Gethin (BRM) alongside Emerson Fittipaldi (Lotus). The late Peter Gethin only drove one race that season which is how I was able to narrow the race down alongside the fact Emerson had the number one on his car. Peter retired from this race early due to an oil pump issue so I assume this is Emerson lapping the British driver.
Photo two was harder but it appears to be Ronnie Peterson’s number 2 lotus. He would also retire due to a suspension failure. I’m unsure of what corner this is but I saw it in some old race footage I found on YouTube, confirming that this was also taken at the same race.","[""The car in the second picture doesn't look like a Lotus at all (airbox, mirrors, front wing).

While watching this past race in Abu Dhabi, I noticed during both Verstappen's and Piastri's 10-second penalty, the overall time for the ""stopped"" time in the pit stop showed 13.4 and I think 13.5.  But there is no way they actually took 3+ seconds to do the actual 'stopped' work of swapping the tires.  If anything, the stopped work seemed as fast, if not faster than, a typical pit stop, so I was expecting to see 12.something on their overall stopped times.  Does anyone have any idea what is going on here? ","['Teams usually go slightly over the penalty time without touching the car, for safety.\n\nIf they fail to serve the penalty correctly that’s another time penalty on top. Sacrificing an extra half a second to ensure you don’t get another 10 second penalty is just good sense.', 'Two reasons:\n\nThe first is that there is no FIA-representative telling them when they can start working on the car, but it is judged afterward if they waited long enough. The teams have to monitor the time-penalty themselves. Is they go really tight on the 10 seconds, they run the risk of the FIA finding that they are too short, because maybe the guy who is timing started his stopwatch 0.2 or 0.3 seconds too early. In that case, they will get another penalty, so they take a little bit more to be safe.\n\nThe second is that while the work may seem very fast, it will always be slightly slower than with a normal pitstop. These guys work mostly on muscle-memory. They start when the car pulls in. But now they have to wait, and it kind of messes up their rhythm. In an ideal pitstop, the wheelguns are on just before the car fully stops.', 'I think just cause the car is worked on before it\'s ""still"".\n\n\nThe car drives in and even before being perfectly still the wheels are being undone and the mechanics getting hand on it.\n\n\nSo the 2.3 second time is not the total time someone was touching it. It\'s the total time the car was stopped.\xa0\n\n\nWhen you\'re doing a penalty you can\'t touch it when it\'s moving so naturally might be quicker in terms of touching but longer in terms of still', ""I was having a hard time understanding how/why the team would be inaccurately keeping track of the 10-second penalty, but I hadn't considered a 'safety' factor they may add in, so thanks for that.  \n\nThey must be adding more than a half second though I guess (?) (which seems like a lot?), because honestly the work was lighting fast once they finally did start.  Can't imagine it was still a 2.5+ second duration of time spent working. 🤷\u200d♂️\n\nSeems like a pretty large safety factor for a sport with such tight/accurate/important margins."", 'Yep, plus if you have to wait there will be slightly different reaction times with each member of the pit crew instead of working on the car coming into the pits.', 'Thanks for the input!', ""Hadn't considered this either.  Thanks!"", 'It’s because of how detrimental fucking it up is. A penalty can be recovered from, it’s highly unlikely you can recover from two though.\n\nThere’ll also be additional human factors involved as well. The pitcrew are used to one input for beginning their process - ie. car stopping. They’re going against this, having to watch another input (lollipop man oking them to start) and then starting the process, which is going to cause delays of split seconds on each of them.', 'One individual is responsible for doing the timing, you don\'t want individual crew mates doing their own internal timing. In the past you\'ve seen individuals reach for the tire before the the time keeper gives the signal, which creates a new penalty if they\'re judged to have touched the car before the elapsed time has gone by.\n\nMuch easier to simply have the time keeper run the lock \\~1/2 to 1 second longer and have a clean penalty free ""lower stress"" pit stop.']",0,16,0.42,0,135,135,0,0,0.019999999999999962,0

1ha8ben,It's past time to re-evaluate the narrative of the 2024 season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ha8ben/its_past_time_to_reevaluate_the_narrative_of_the/,2024-12-09, Discussion,"The prevailing narrative on social media this season has been ""McLaren are bottling the WDC/WCC"" or ""Lando is bottling the race/championship"" or - when they have won - ""McLaren should have won this earlier"".  Even now that they've completed their best season in literal decades with a championship win, the narrative still seems to be focused on the fact that McLaren are not perfect.  As if any team is.

It is my view that RBR has broadly escaped criticism on social media for their dramatic drop in form in 2024. with the exception of Checo Perez, who I think is often the scapegoat that takes all (or most) of the blame for the failings that belong to the team as a whole.

Both the WDC and the WCC were RBR's to lose this year.  The only team that *bottled* anything was RBR in falling so spectacularly hard after the season had started, especially after coming off of several years of complete dominance.  The WDC this year was won by Max Verstappen, but with one hand tied behind his back and an entire Formula One team strapped to his back as he pulled himself over the line by sheer force of will and unbelievable skill.

Maybe it's a reaction to British Media, which I'm largely unexposed to, but the narratives on social media to me seem completely out of touch with reality.

If you're wearing Papaya or ""Rosso Corsa"", you should have nothing but pride for how your season went - even if you have plenty of opportunities still to improve upon for next season.  But if you're with Red Bull (and your name isn't Verstappen), you need to be going into the off-season with some humility and some organizational soul-searching, because this was a bad, bad season for you and 2025 is fast approaching.","[""You have a team that has lost it's way in terms of car development with a car that is difficult to setup and drive (RBR).
