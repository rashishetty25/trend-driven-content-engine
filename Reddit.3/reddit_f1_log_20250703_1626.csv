We never got anything concrete but they went from gapping the field in Quali and the race to not doing so.\xa0\n\nYes McLaren brought upgrades but Ferrari did not, so why were Ferrari so close to pole in the sprint and the race? And why was Leclerc able to stay within a few seconds off Max for the whole sprint? And Max wasnt pulling his usual gaps in the race even before he hit the cone.\xa0\n\nNow the internal power struggle, it is almost certain that stuff went down here. Who leaked the WhatsApp messages? It had to be someone very involved to have access to them, possibly someone involved with the woman at the heart of it. There were rumours that she got on with Jos Verstappen who was seen having a shouting match with Horner during the Saudi weekend.\xa0\n\nAnd then the drivers, I have a little F1 conspiracy that Daniel Ricciardo was told that he was promoted to a Red Bull driver after the Belgian Grand Prix.\xa0\n\nWhy do I think this? Going into the race it was heavily rumoured that Perez was out, but he did finally have a good qulaifying in Belgium, the last race before the summer break.\xa0\n\nGoing into the race Perez was 7th in the championship and Russell a few points behind in 8th. This is importnat.\xa0\n\nOn the grid it was reported by credible content creator LawVS (he has no reason to lie and it would be out of character) that he had a source on the ground that said right before the race while the cars were being prepped before the formation lap, Helmut Marko strode away from Verstappen’s penalised Red Bull to the car directly behind, Daniel Ricciardo’s. He said something in Ricciardo and they nodded and Daniel got in the car.\xa0\n\nIn the race Perez had an awful time, dropping from 2nd down to 8th while George Russell had an amazing run to victory!\xa0\n\nThis demoted Perez to 8th place in the championship standings, perhaps invoking a contract clause…\xa0\n\nIn the post race interviews Ricciardo looked chirpy, very happy for a man who’d just had a normal race to 11th.\xa0\n\nThen the teams went back to their garages and the drivers left the venue with Verstappen and Ricciardo reported to have left the circuit together and helicoptering away from Spa together, under the assumption that they were team mates again….\xa0\n\nBut then George Russell’s car was found to be overweight, and then, he was disqualified from the race. This promoted Perez back to 7th in the standings amd meant the contract clause did not invoke!\xa0\n\nAnd so thus Perez kept his Red Bull seat and Ricciardo showed up in VCARB gear in Zandvoort seeming a bit perplexed. Perez then had strong form post summer break while Russell had a couple of unlucky races, so Perez stayed 7th for the time being.\n\nBut there was now another factor in play, Liam Lawson.\xa0\n\nOn the 22nd September 2023 a contract had been signed saying that Tsunoda and Ricciardo would race for Alpha Tauri/VCARB in 2024. On that day it was confirmed that Liam Lawson would not be a full time racer for 2024 following his impressive stand in for Ricciardo in 2023 when Daniel broke his hand and was injured by that.\xa0\n\nHorner/Marko HEAVILY suggested that Lawson would have a race seat at some point. But locking him down for 2025 during 2023 made little sense. So perhaps the contract stated that in one year from now, you will be in Formula 1 while it said in Ricciardo’s amd Tsunoda’s contract that if they was not ahead of their team mate in the standings by this day 2024 they would be the ones to be replaced. This way they could use the last races of 2024 to judge him. Perhaps this explains why Tsunoda was so incensed by the team orders as early as the first race.\xa0\n\nOf course if Perez been replaced at the summer break all of them could have survived but that ship had sailed.\n\nAnd going into the Singapore Grand Prix which coincidentally fell on the 22nd September 2024, exactly one year after the original Lawson contract was signed Ricciardo was on 12 points and Tsunoda on 22.\xa0\n\nThis is why it wasn’t publicly announced that it was Ricciardo’s last race. There was a tiny chance that if he pulled a P4 or a P5 he would stay. But alas he did not, and the honey badger bowed out of F1, and left the paddock as a driver for the last time, replaced by Liam Lawson and the rest is history.\xa0\n\nYes Perez dropped to 8th in the standings but of course they wouldnt replace him in the run up to the Mexican GP and there was no natural break like the summer break had been.\xa0\n\nThats probably all wrong though.', ""I have a lot of respect for Horner and his achievements with RBR, but it is clear that something has changed the past two years.

They'll then decide when to introduce this component."", ""Well, if it makes for a stable platform for 2026, I'm all for it."", 'niceee make sense , one of the most beautiful track along with imola, Austria..', ""That's a lot of development they are still doing for this year"", 'ChatGPT translation:\n\nIn Austria, Ferrari received official feedback on the first set of corrections for the SF‑25, which has been struggling with its aero‑mechanical platform. The development package—including a new floor designed to widen the set‑up window—proved successful, with the car responding well and emerging as the second‑strongest force, while Mercedes and Red\u202fBull fell further back. “It was important to see on track what we had studied in the Maranello wind tunnel,” Jerome\u202fD’Ambrosio confirmed, referring to what he called an “auxiliary” upgrade for the SF‑25—though it is more accurately a precursor to later evolutionary steps, among them the introduction of an updated rear suspension. “We shall see,” Jerome concluded, hinting at the forthcoming mechanical changes. In any case, Ferrari’s technical department already has a plan for fitting the new parts.\n\nJuly is likely to bring the team’s second filming day of the year, a savvy move that will allow them to test the revised rear suspension: 200\u202fkm of running to evaluate five months of work.\n\nThe true structural issue around which Ferrari has re‑oriented the SF‑25 project is the rear suspension, whose new configuration has been in development since the start of the season. Loïc\xa0Serra’s decision to devote resources to a flawed concept stems from his belief in the car’s “untapped potential”, which the new mechanical component is chiefly intended to unlock. It is no simple task and has required re‑examining several upstream design choices—never trivial when trying to straighten out a technical package. As we analyse in our dedicated YouTube video, it has demanded extensive deliberation and time, all while working within the constraints of the technical and financial regulations and persisting with a car that is nearing the end of its regulatory cycle. Validating the new suspension architecture is essential yet far from straightforward, which is why Ferrari has already scheduled a 200\u202fkm filming day at Mugello in July, running the SF‑25 fitted with the new rear hardware.\n\nThe test will call for a critical, in‑depth study of real‑world data gathered on track and will serve as a genuine validation examination of the new component. Only after this filming day will Ferrari decide definitively whether—and when—to introduce the new suspension. Choosing the other company‑owned circuit, Mugello, rather than Fiorano, is clearly strategic: the Tuscan track offers technical characteristics that more closely represent a race circuit, with high‑energy corners like the Arrabbiata 1 and 2 and altitude changes that stress the car’s platform more realistically. Such conditions will provide data that are far more useful for mechanically calibrating the new suspension layout—data that would be less meaningful at Fiorano. As team principal Frédéric Vasseur has hinted, if all goes to plan, the change should help the SF‑25 keep the rear under better control, ensuring a more stable aero‑mechanical platform and a broader operating window—one of the major weaknesses at the start of this season.\n\nThis strategy explains why Silverstone is not a suitable window for the race debut of the new rear suspension. Nor will the SF‑25 receive significant novelties in Britain; instead, the team will continue to study the new floor and aim to extract maximum potential from that package. Ferrari has chosen a measured approach to introducing the new component—particularly as, in Mercedes’s case, an updated rear suspension did not immediately yield an optimised upgrade. Moreover, being overly aggressive and relying solely on theory—if not blind faith—could do more harm than good.', ""I really don't know if it's worth it to spent so much money and time for a new suspension for max. eleven races. But who I am to judge."", 'Current suspension was supposed to be exactly that, but after the first few races they told that it didn’t work and was the major reason for their slow speed.', ""Next year's car will need a suspension too"", 'Set up for next year, the aero platform is rather similar. \n\nLooking at Mclaren and how stable their platform is, others need to develop something similar.

Though could it also just be some drivers are better at managing tyres than others which is why someone like Martins or Fornoroli is lower on Quali pace than race pace?\xa0\n\nAs for Formula 1, Lindblad and Dunne are the only guys on the current F2 grid that look like F1 quality drivers. I would go as far as saying Lindblad is 90% gonna have a race seat next season because he’s next in the wings to go to Racing Bulls and I cannot see Verstappen, Tsunoda and Lawson all being in the Red Bull camp next year.\xa0\n\nIf Max stays Yuki’s out as they’ll put Hadjar in Red Bull and I doubt Yuki is going back to the b team. And Lawson’s been the worst performer out of the four this year.\xa0\n\nIf Max goes then theres a spot available. If he replaces Russell it may be a straight swap. But if I was George I’d got to Aston over RB. If Max replaced Kimi then Toto could try and get Kimi into the Alpine or as a reserve driver. Theres question marks over whether Kimi and his camp would want to keep ties with Toto if he got replaced after 1 year.\n\nTLDR - Lindblad’s almost defo gonna have \xa0an F1 spot next year.\xa0\n\nNow for Dunne. Dunne has impressed me more than anyone in F2 this year. Yes he makes mistakes but F1 teams prefer a rookie who makes mistakes but is super fast than a rookie who is consistently solid but doesn’t have that pure pace like Zhou.\xa0\n\nBut Dunne has a few things out of his control that are going against him. He’s arrived in a season where nearly all the F1 teams seem nailed down for 2026 and those who aren’t have other options. It’s sort of the opposite of last season Im F2 where anyone who had a good year could get into F1. This season is a case of right place wrong time.\xa0\n\nAnother problem for Dunne is that I’ve read an interview with him where he’s said that he probably won’t have the funds to do another year of F2. This year might be his only shot. \xa0\n\nSo if he’s not in F2 next year (which could be a year of more change on the F1 grid) he might be forgotten, similarly to Pourchaire, though he did not do it in his first season (If Pourchaire was a year later he’d probably be in F1).\xa0\n\nI hope for Dunne’s sake, as an Irish fan who’s never seen someone from my country in F1, that he gets a shot. However let’s see if he’s able to keep up the good form.', 'Yeah it feels like Lindblad is 99% confirmed for a F1 seat next year. And Dunne has impressed me the most as a rookie when also considering that he has dealt with possible funding issues in previous years before joining McLaren’s academy last year. There is no place for Dunne on the grid next year but hopefully he can continue to make a strong challenge for the championship, and then get more opportunities next year as McLaren’s reserve driver with more FP1s. Then by 2027 potentially get a full time seat secured somewhere. Piastri himself won F2 as a rookie in 2021 and didn’t have a seat in 2022 but it seems to have worked out well for him. \n\nThose two definitely have the most potential to become credible F1 drivers, but the rest of the grid isn’t that bad imo. Martins is the most prominent one for me because I believe he has the raw pace to get into F1, but his funding hasn’t been that good which held him back a few years and he isn’t able to consistently convert that qualifying pace into good points whether it’s due to tire management, racecraft, or sheer back luck (taken out by Dunne when he took the lead at Monaco as one example). His opportunity has passed unfortunately but Martins is definitely talented enough to have a good career in another category even if it isn’t F1.', 'Lawson so far has been better than Yuki wtf are you talking about? 😂', 'Im not saying the rest of the grid is bad, just no one stands out as F1 worthy. It’s probably not the worst grid ever, how do you think it compares to 2020-2023?', 'No.\xa0\n\nWhen Yuki was team mates with Hadjar he was clearly the better driver.\xa0\n\nAustria is literally the first time Lawson has beaten Hadjar. He is 10-1 down to a rookie.\xa0\n\nYuki’s average gap to Max is smaller than Lawson’s.\xa0\n\nBut reactionary fans don’t seem to learn that drivers dont suddenly become worse versions of themselves when they’re at Red Bull. They just look worse because they’re next to Max Verstappen, not Isack Hadjar.\xa0\n\nYuki Tsunoda has beaten Max Verstappen the same amount of times Liam Lawson has beaten Isack Hadjar. That should say it all.', 'Oh that specific comment wasn’t directed at you, but I did see a few comments in previous F2 posts saying this year’s grid is the worst in a long time just cause Verschoor who is in his 5th year and is honestly an above average F2 driver is leading the championship. \n\nI only started following F2 in 2021. I would say 2021’s grid is definitely better, 2023’s grid is slightly better, and 2022 is comparable to this year’s grid. \n\nSo the grid overall might not have that many top end talents, but I think part of that is also determined by hindsight bias because we know that there are hardly any available seats for 2026. I do feel so far this year’s grid is rather aggressive and we’ve seen some crazy incidents already, some of which have also included Dunne.', ""Lawson has also had bad luck intervene in pretty much every race with RB this season\n\nJapan was a mulligan for Liam (and Yuki) given the circumstances\n\nThen there was the DRS issue in Bahrain - caused by Liam but an honest mistake, he still finished ahead of Isaak on track though\n\nJeddah was good, Isaak just got by amid the Gasly/Yuki collision.

1lqay34,Green Notebook From Pullman City [Alpine news - 5 groups interested in acquiring team since de Meo resigned],https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lqay34/green_notebook_from_pullman_city_alpine_news_5/,2025-07-02, News,"Quote from the blog post:

""The irony is that results do not appear to be that important at the moment as the value of F1 teams is skyrocketing because there is huge demand and a limited supply. The investment world seems to be convinced that live sport will flourish forever and that the value of teams will follow the same trend as NFL, NBA and MLB franchises that are now getting astonishing valuations.  I have heard of at least five groups that have expressed interest since de Meo departed in buying the team. It makes sense as it would rid Renault of a big headache – and put some money back into the balance sheet. However, I doubt that the Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard will do anything until there is a new CEO. So they are likely to keep Briatore for a while, as he is quite useful as someone to blame… There is talk that the de Meo job could go to Denis Le Vot, who runs Dacia, but a much more logical choice would seem to be Maxime Picat, who was in the running for the CEO role at Stellantis. He is nearly 10 years younger than Le Vot and has had bigger jobs. I have no idea who might win the auction for the team but I know that the price will be high. I hear that Red Bull recently turned down someone’s bid of $1.5 billion to buy Racing Bulls. My feeling is that while US private equity types will put in competitive bids, the whole thing might be bundled (Alpine car company included) and that is the sort of package would be appealing to a Chinese firm""","["">If Mercedes believes that there is a possibility of getting Max, one has to conclude that there is a way it can be done and that will no doubt depend on option clauses that we do not know about. **I have been asking around about this for some time and I have concluded that if Red Bull is not third in the Constructors’ Championship by the end of July, Max might be able to leave. If the team is third he is automatically locked in for another year.** \n\nMore interesting. Other reports were that it was if Max wasn't P3 in the championship but Saward says it's if the team isn't P3."", '>So they are likely to keep Briatore for a while, as he is quite useful as someone to blame\n\nMakes sense considering that Flavio has made a career out of dodging blame, or at least, dodging the consequences.', 'All this guy does is post rumors.
