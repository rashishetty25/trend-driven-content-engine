Alex? We'll see about that."", ""When Sainz left they had Verstappen paired with Ricciardo, I think it's fair to say those where two top drivers, probably more so than Verstappen + Sainz would be.\n\nAfter that they promoted from within, with little success.\n\nAfter that, they signed a top mid-field driver, who was at the time comfortably the strongest driver not already locked in with a team. Nobody really forsaw the total collapse he had.\n\nI don't think you can say Red Bull actively avoided having a strong driver next to Verstappen, they've not really had better options. Except maybe Sainz this year, but then is there really much reason to assume he'd do better than Perez? They tried getting a respected experienced driver from the outside and it didn't work out at all, why try the same thing again instead of promoting from within like they used to do?"", 'His statement will look a little bit weird in hindsight if Lawson is closer to Verstappen than Albon was.', ""What Sainz is conveniently not thinking of is that you get someone like Verstappen or MSC once in a lifetime in your team.

He is not that.', ""Basically as we observed last year: because if you won't win the WCC, you could well win the WDC.\n\nMarko himself observed similar a while ago, that if the top 4 teams are very close in 2025, then being clear #1 is a massive advantage for Verstappen."", ""RBR wants to keep Max happy so he doesn't leave.  And the way to do that is to continue to give him weak 2nd drivers.  To be mentioned among the all-time greats one needs to have very good 2nd teammates to challenge them -- to really show the world how great they are.  Otherwise, it will always be: It was the car.

1iwqacf,"Do we have a record lowest number of current drivers to have taken part in an earnest ""title battle""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iwqacf/do_we_have_a_record_lowest_number_of_current/,2025-02-24, Discussion,"Obviously, modern F1 fans are well aware of the level of net dominance we've seen in the past 15 years, with only 1 WDC winner since 2010 winning it fewer than 4 times. However, those 15 years have had very different outcomes, of some years seeing a straight cruise to the record books, versus others with a number of different drivers in contention right through the final race. 

Currently, our grid is not only very rookie-heavy, but the dominance over the most recent regulations cycle has dwindled the number of drivers to ever have taken part in an earnest title battle. 

At any point in any season, only Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, and Lando Norris have ever truly been in the running to win the WDC. Considering that 3 of them are champions themselves, that's a pretty surprising statistic. 

Considering that FOM themselves have hyped up long shots like Perez in 2023 or Bottas for a number of years, there are seasons in which a great deal of drivers have had more legitimate title shots than any of the other 15 drivers on this year's grid... but of course, with aspiring competitors in potentially top seats like Piastri, Lawson, Russell, and Antonelli, we may add to this list quickly! ","[""1994 post Senna's death and when Mansell wasn't present, there was zero drivers who had ever battled for a championship prior to 1994 let alone won one."", 'The first ever f1 season had no drivers to have previously been In a battle for an F1 Championship.', ""2004 only had Schumi, Kimi that challenged for a WDC for 1 year and a washed Villeneuve who was a 1 time WDC.\n\nThat's worse than 3 multi WDCs who battled for multiple WDCs each and Lando who had a title battle last year."", 'We just need to not have one car way faster than the rest to start the season. Now when we practically have no mechanical retirements or major issues anymore, being even ~ 0.2, 0.3 ish seconds quicker a lap consistently can pretty much end the season in a few races.', ""2007 maybe? Only Alonso and Raikkonen had really been in proper title fights before that season. So that's (x2).\n\n\nThis year Leclerc has never really been in the running for a title yet and Norris was barely in the running at all last season because the field got way more competitive in the second half so a bunch of teams and drivers, including his own teammate, took wins and points away from him when a dominant car like Verstappen had early season would have given him a much better chance of catching up Verstappen's gigantic lead. I'd honestly say only Alonso, Hamilton and Verstappen have been in proper title fights on the current grid. Including Norris is incorrect IMO. So (x3).\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Just had a look back from 1994-2006. Looks about right give or take depending on what you call a credible title contender. I don't really class Villeneuve as a credible challenge to Hill in their dominant 1996 Williams for example. Some might think it's harsh but to me he was no challenge to Hill in the championship the whole season.\xa0\n\n\n1994 Senna, Mansell (x2).\n\n\n1995 Mansell, Schumacher (x2).\n\n\n1996-1997 Schumacher, Hill (x2).\n\n\n1998 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve (x3).\n\n\n1999 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve, Hakkinen (x4).\n\n\n2000-2001 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Hakkinen, Irvine (x4).\n\n\n2002 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Irvine (x3).\n\n\n2003 Schumacher, Villeneuve (x2).\n\n\n2004-2005 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen (x3).\n\n\n2006 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen, Alonso (x4)\n\n\nSo quite a few seasons during this time have had 2 previous title contenders on the grid."", ""will this year be pog to watch as someone who's never watched before?"", ""If the field was closer it would not have been that different, maybe Sainz/Russel , other than that who's good enough to be in the mix?"", ""Alboreto was on the grid during that time wasn't he? He'd battled for the title in 1985, though his challenge fell apart in the closing rounds due to Ferrari shitting the bed (I'd compare it to Vettel's 2017, for a modern reference point).""]",0,27,0.38,0,163,163,0,0,0.030000000000000027,0
