Car has absolutely no rear end without aero load. Ferrari being Ferrari I hope it doesn't take away the current strong front end and braking. Only Ferrari could come up with a package where rears are sliding while fronts are struggling to get up to the temps. Smh"", 'Where’s that pasta gun meme 😐', 'Here\'s a translation of the article\n\nLike a fortnight ago in Florida, the SF-25s failed to take advantage of the new tyres and found themselves excluded in Q2, so they will start 11th and 12th. The team principal has apologised to the fans, but continues to believe that the potential is greater than seen and that there were also shortcomings in execution.\n\nDisaster. That is really the only word one can use to comment on Ferrari\'s qualifying at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. No one expected a miracle from the SF-25, as Lewis Hamilton had been asking for patience from the fans since Thursday. But probably no one would have expected to see both Reds eliminated at the end of Q2 either, with Charles Leclerc starting 11th just ahead of the seven-time world champion.\n\nThe problem was that, while everyone else improved on their last attempt, the two Ferraris, on the other hand, when they mounted the new soft tyres, were unable to improve on the time they had set on the used ones. A script already seen in Miami, which was also repeated on a very different track. And a problem that is therefore becoming quite an Achilles heel for the men from the Cavallino. But team principal Fred Vasseur is also well aware of this.\n\n""It\'s almost a copy-paste of what happened a fortnight ago in Miami, we couldn\'t improve the with the new set of tyres and we did the fastest lap with the first set in Q2. Why? If we knew, we would have solved it by now, but it\'s true that it\'s a strange situation, although I think it was a bit strange for everyone today with the tyres. The pace was decent, because if you look at the first stint we were fifth and sixth with the used tyres, but then with the new set we couldn\'t improve, while the others did it by three or four tenths and we paid the price,"" Vasseur told the Sky Sport F1 microphones.\n\nDuring the link-up, he was heard to hear Leclerc explain that in his opinion the problem is that there is simply no potential in the SF-25. A thought the French manager only partly shares: ""I think the problem today was 50-50 between execution and potential, because I think if we had done everything right we would have finished fourth and fifth. The execution was not right, because we have to make the car work for what it is worth and today that didn\'t happen, because with the new tyres we didn\'t confirm the positions we had with the used tyres. But the potential is not good either, because the goal is not to be fifth and sixth. But it\'s a balancing act between the two, both execution and potential are lacking"".\n\nToday several competitor cars, including Aston Martin, were presenting new packages, while at Ferrari they are still talking about understanding the current one. Vasseur was therefore asked whether this process is well advanced: \'If I say yes, then I am a fool if you see what we did today. But today I think the Aston Martins are the only ones who did all the qualifying on medium tyres and ended up finishing fifth, so there was something unusual.\n\nThe problem is that the upgrades will also have to be understood when they arrive, but according to Vasseur that does not seem to be the point: ""When we talk about upgrades we always talk about tenths or hundredths of a second, we are certainly not talking about half a second. What we can do with the tyres, on the other hand, can be worth even half a second. It\'s more there maybe that we have to try to understand and get something out of it.\n\nThe race pace yesterday was good, so you can try to attack, even if starting so far back at Imola is a big handicap: ""Everything is always open, because our race pace yesterday was good, but it is also true that it is very difficult to overtake here, so we will have to be very lucid and maybe even try some risks in terms of strategy.\n\nLeclerc publicly apologised to the fans, a sentiment also espoused by the team principal: ""We have nothing more to say or do. We have thousands of fans on the track and it was not what we expected for them, so we have to apologise, but we also have to focus on the future and tomorrow, trying to do our best for them and for us.""\n\nFred should make ""Potential"" his middle name.', 'I think he’s got to understand that the execution and extracting potential from the car is actually a deep rooted issue with the car. \n\nThere’s a reason why there’s been a pattern of Ferraris pace compared to others looking better on the used softs compared to new softs and that’s because the of car and the way it treats tires. \n\nThey’ve had issues with tires in qualifying since the start of the 2024 season, He can’t keep acting like it’s a small issue they’ll fix soon.\nI don’t have any hope for Ferrari this season', 'Wonder how many copy & paste of Miami we will have for the remaining races.

Ferrari is Ferrari, and Red Bull is a one-man team.', 'Translation:\n\n> **McLaren proved to be vastly superior on the first day of practice at Imola. Over one lap and over the entire race. The only question now is: Who will finish second? Ferrari has the best chances in the long run, but they\'re one lap behind.**\n\n> After McLaren\'s one-two victory at the Miami GP, everyone was wondering: Could it be even more dominant? It could be, if the first day of practice in Imola were to be the benchmark for the rest of the weekend. This time, the McLarens had the better of the competition, even on one lap, with a lead of almost three-tenths. In the long run, that\'s for sure. There\'s a world of difference between McLaren and the rest.\n\n> The race for victory will be between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Piastri beat his teammate by 0.025 seconds on one lap. In the race simulation, Norris had the edge by 0.045 seconds. However, Piastri completed two more laps on the medium tires. The close race between the Papaya Boys could be quite exciting for spectators. Perhaps less so for the McLaren command bridge. Will the first clash, which McLaren boss Zak Brown says is inevitable, take place in Imola?\n\n> Things remain exciting behind McLaren as well. On one lap, Mercedes has a minimal lead over Red Bull and Ferrari. Things are different in the long runs, where Ferrari excelled. Charles Leclerc\'s lap times averaged just two-tenths of a second better than McLaren\'s. ""But that only helps us if we\'re ahead of our opponents on the starting grid,"" team principal Frédéric Vasseur told his team. Imola is a track with a built-in overtaking ban.\n\n> In the midfield, Alpine shone on one lap with the new C6 tire. Williams was stronger on the medium C5 compound. As a whole, you have to trust Williams more. Carlos Sainz\'s long run was over half a second faster per lap than Pierre Gasly\'s.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n\n> **1) Is McLaren unbeatable again?**\nThe first practice session ended with a one-two finish for McLaren. Oscar Piastri finished ahead of Lando Norris. But the lead over third-placed Carlos Sainz was razor-thin at 52 thousandths of a second. All were on the new C6 compound. The second practice session, on the medium tires, presented a similar picture: Norris ahead of Sainz, separated by only 0.040 seconds. There was still hope that McLaren would at least have to fight for pole position.\n\n> But on the soft tires, McLaren then unleashed a blast. Piastri and Norris were within just 0.025 seconds of each other. Everyone else, including Pierre Gasly at the front, was almost three-tenths behind. With a time difference of 1.127 seconds for the entire field, that\'s a class difference. Things got even worse for the rivals in the long runs. Only Ferrari was able to keep up. All the other drivers were on average half a second slower per lap. While the McLarens maintained their lap times consistently, their rivals\' times improved after five laps.\n\n> **2) Has Red Bull solved its problems?**\n\nYes and no. Even the Imola upgrade only partially cured the RB21\'s weaknesses. Max Verstappen initially reported understeer at the apex and oversteer on corner exit. But by the second practice session, the understeer had disappeared. ""Nevertheless, we lost four-tenths to the McLarens. That\'s too much. And in the race, the McLarens seem to be in a class of their own again,"" lamented Sporting Director Helmut Marko. Compared to the other teams, the assessment is cautious. ""We ran our normal program, but we have the feeling that some of them were perhaps a bit lighter.""\n\n> The latest development stage hasn\'t entirely failed to achieve its intended effect, but it hasn\'t brought Red Bull significantly closer to McLaren or away from its fellow sufferers Mercedes and Ferrari. Furthermore, the car bounces over bumps and curbs—a long-standing problem that has plagued Red Bull for two years now. Yuki Tsunoda\'s eighth-place finish was surprising, but even more so was the small time difference of 0.092 seconds. ""No one has been this close to Max in a long time. Yuki doesn\'t mind the oversteer as much. He complains less,"" Marko noted. The small time difference could also tell a different story, however. Namely, that Verstappen wasn\'t yet at his best. The world champion usually strikes when things get serious.\n\n(1/2)', '""Most competitive season yet""', '***Reaaaalllly*** interesting and helpful article.

I had no answer 😂. It is completely nonsense if you look back to it.","[""Larger cars allow for more aerodynamic options. It's just faster.\n\n\nIn like 2018 the FIA loosened some of the size limitations on the cars, and the first thing many teams did was made the cars longer."", ""Increasing the width of the cars was a rule thing, largely restoring what had been used previously in the 80s and 90s, but the length was just driven by engineering wanting more aero surface area. Recently there's been rules to limit the length of the cars."", 'I mean the first half of 2022 was imo the best racing we have ever had in F1.\n\n[Edit] ok some people are wondering why I think this, here’s my explanation.\n\nPeople often glorify pre DRS F1, and while it was often great, and had more jeopardy, there were significantly less overtakes and battles. The jeopardy made up for that but in terms of Racimg it wasn’t that great.\xa0\n\nBut people have only seen highlights of the classic races, not the boring ones. I hate the way people call the likes of the 2005 season a classic because they’ve only watched Imola and Japan. Overall that season was usually pretty boring races.\n\nWhen we introduced DRS F1 did get better. Out standards have now gone up. But in 2011 and 2012 DRS was a bit too strong.\xa0\n\nBut in early 2022 F1 entered the best balance it has ever had and this resulted in imo the best Racimg we have ever had.\n\nWhen they got rid of porpoising in Belgium 2022 they also got rid of some of the cars ability to follow closely. Also in Hungary 2022 Aston Martin brought an update that increased the amount of dirty air coming out of the back of their car. This made them hard to overtake and everyone else copied them.\xa0\n\nHad the cars stayed like they were in the first half of 2022 this would have been the best regulations of all time.\xa0\n\nSeriously. Im not even just talkimg about Leclerc vs Max in Bahrain and Saudi. Im talking about having about three times the amount of overtakes there usually are in Australia.\xa0\n\nAnd Spain, even with the last chicane still there, had a great race with all the leaders having various plights and Russell and Verstappen having an amazing battle.\xa0\nIn Silverstone we had the best multi car wheel to wheel battle we’ve seen in the last decade that was with the top cars.\xa0\nIn Austria there were battles everywhere and a five way battle at one point in the midfield where in about half a lap they all swapped around.\xa0\n\nEven France gave us \xa0loads of action and battles.\n\nAnd Hungary was the peak of it. Everyone made their strategy assuming overtaking would be difficult at what is historically the second or third worst track for passing. But there was overtakes galore especially at the head of the field.\xa0\n\nOn top of this tyres were wearing much faster than everyone expected. Bahrain, Spain and Austia were three stoppers!\xa0\nMost races were two stoppers and only about a third of them were one stop races. And the cars all had such different designs and even their paint jobs were more colourful.\xa0\n\nAlso reliability was a big factor with only Mercedes amd their customer teams having a consistently reliable car. This made for mixed up and entertaining races.\n\nBtw Im not saying in the first half it was the best season ever. But in terms of racing I think it’s the best F1 has ever been.\xa0', 'Casual F1 fans mentality: car small race good.', 'The ""problem"" is the series is factoring in safety mandates to ensure the drivers are provided the best chance of surviving any an all crashes. The cars are bigger now, to provide crumple zones and energy-dissipation in the event of a driver having an accident. So we\'re at an impasse, I doubt there\'s ANY motorsport fan wants to go back to the days of a driver dying a season and three being seriously injured, but part of ensuring the drivers don\'t risk life and limb each event is making the cars bigger by metres, to allow that little bit more breakaway impact zone to help take some the energy out the impact they could end up in.\n\nEdit: Saw an example in Qualy just gone, big roll, lots of shit broke off, driver walked off unhurt as the impact zones took the impact and lessened the impact.', 'Front wings back in the day were much better, the ones now are two big, dont punch a hole big enough in the air and too much dirty air for car behind.
