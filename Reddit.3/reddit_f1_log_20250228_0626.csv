It was an okay video in itself, but it wasn't a testing highlights video at all.

I don't need to hear about Hamilton hype, or how Williams was a once great team that has struggled for years, but James Vowels hopes to bring them back. That doesn't have anything to do with testing day 1. There was only one tiny clip of actual footage from the testing with actual commentating. I watch highlights of each free practice every week, and I enjoy those. Those are just clips of actual coverage clipped together, and showing things that actually happened in the testing, in the order that they happened. I'd sure they are low effort to put together, but convey good information.\n\nThis video was better. It was vaguely in time order, morning drivers, drivers who did the whole day as a segue, and then afternoon drivers. It showed more coherent footage that Chris actually described as it was happening on the screen, kind of replacing live commentators, which is a fine choice. And there was some thematic order to it too, which I don't need, but I also don't mind, as long as it actually reflects information about the testing day, not just a season overview."", ""I get he's a little monotone...but this doesn't sound like AI at all.
