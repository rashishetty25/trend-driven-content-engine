The Monegasque, who spoke to the press in the conference held inside Ferrari hospitality, summed up the sensations he felt at the wheel of the SF-25 during the three days of testing. The unusual conditions of the three days in Sakhir complicated the collection of realistic data, although it is clear to the entire paddock that McLaren appears to be the most competitive team at the moment. From Leclerc\'s point of view, what has been seen is only a preliminary picture, since there are many issues still to be resolved in view of Melbourne.\n\n\nLeclerc: ‚ÄúWe struggled a bit with the balance, but we see the numbers we expected‚Äù\n\nOne of the aspects that makes it difficult to draw up analyses by the protagonists themselves is linked to the anomalous conditions that occurred in Bahrain , between temperatures and grip levels. ‚ÄúHonestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever experienced a Bahrain like this before,‚Äù commented Charles Leclerc in the press conference organised by Ferrari. ‚ÄúIt was very cold, there was also rain, the temperatures are not what we are used to, so the reference compared to other years is very difficult. Usually we have much warmer conditions.‚Äù On the work with the SF-25 he then added: ‚Äúwe see all the numbers we expected . Today we struggled a bit more with the balance , even yesterday afternoon it was a bit more difficult to manage, so there is still a bit of work to do.‚Äù\n\nFinding the right balance was, from Leclerc\'s point of view, the theme on which the work in the Maranello garage focused. Only in Australia will it be possible to draw concrete conclusions. ""I would prefer to wait before making any predictions,"" Leclerc underlined. ""For now we are working hard to try to improve this balance , which we have struggled a bit to put in the right place in the last two days. After that we will only see in Melbourne when we will have everything in the best conditions to try to extract the best from the car, but basically we struggled a bit more in the balance, and that is where we are concentrating now.""\n\n\nOn McLaren\'s level: ""We use their performance to understand what we lack""\n\nThe Ferrari driver also maintained a moderate line in terms of comparison with McLaren , which at the moment seems to be the benchmark of the group. ‚ÄúMcLaren seems like a very strong car for now,‚Äù said Leclerc . ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs very early to talk , so we have to focus on ourselves and not get caught up in the top ranks. There are still a lot of question marks, but we‚Äôve learned a lot during these first tests and that will certainly help us hit the right window for the first race.‚Äù The very solid race simulations put on the track by the Woking team have certainly captured the attention of protagonists and insiders, but Leclerc didn‚Äôt say he was too scared, explaining how they could instead be useful for obtaining a yardstick. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a first idea of what we can expect, but there are still a lot of unknowns, so we have to take these times with a pinch of salt. However, they have been very important for us to understand what we are missing compared to them . There is still a lot of work to do to prepare for Melbourne and that is what we are trying to do, also together with Lewis.‚Äù', 'Basically my conclusion after testing, McLaren look solid and the SF will need to refine its balance but beyond that I‚Äôm not concerned.

* **Jacques Villeneuve (1997, Luxembourg)** ‚Äì He won the title two races later, in Jerez.

* **Mike Hawthorn (1958, France)** ‚Äì The title was mathematically sealed at the final race (Morocco).
* **Phil Hill (1961, Italy)** ‚Äì He won the championship in that race, with the title being mathematically sealed due to the death of Von Trips, who then was just one point behind him.

* **Mario Andretti (1978 Zandvoort)** (thanks to u/TheRoboteer!) - The title was assigned one race later in Monza

It was another record breaking year for F1 with revenue of $3.4B (\^$189M), **Adjusted EBIT of $2.07B** (\^$169M) and declared income of $492M (\^100M).

Nobody publishes these breakdowns anymore, so here is the maths sourced from Liberty media earnings calls, reputable journalists and corroborated by checking against the financial records of F1 and the teams.

The team payments pool is [calculated from adjusted EBIT based on a scale that tips more towards Liberty as the profits increase](https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/formel-1/f1-aktie-hoehenflug-liberty-media-teams-kauften-nicht/#:~:text=The%20amount%20of,just%2030%20percent).  below is the scale of how much the teams get for each band of F1 earnings

|$0-$1B|         | 75% |      |$750M|

|next $500M|  | 60%|       |$300M|

|Next $300M|  |45%|      |$135M|

|Over $1.8B|    | 30%|       |$81 (in 2024)|

This makes the total prize pool [(team payments) $1,266M](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/557/liberty-media-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year#:~:text=(-,1%2C266,-)) up from $1,215M in 2023.

From this, [Ferrari still gets the Longest Standing Team Bonus](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ferrari-set-to-keep-bonus-payment-in-new-f1-concorde-agreement-but-now-capped/10613517/) which is said to be 5% up to a prize pool of 1.1B, then increases by 1% for every $100M extra in the prize pool (6% to 1.2B etc. like tax brackets). for 2024 this is $65.6M.

Then there is a Past Performance pool, awarded to teams based on a matrix of placing in the top 3 of the WCC over the past 10 seasons and a bonus for teams that have won single or multiple WCC in the sports history. This pool is [believed to be 20% of the total pool, over $650M](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/who-wins-from-f1s-new-concorde-deal-and-how-itll-work/#:~:text=Title%2Dwinning%20teams%20and%20teams%20that%20finished%20in%20the%20top%20three%20in%20the%20past%20decade%20are%20eligible%20for%20this%20pot%2C%20which%20is%20derived%20from%20a%20percentage%20of%20F1%20revenue%20above%20a%20certain%20threshold%20%E2%80%93%20reportedly%2020%25%20of%20what%20F1%20makes%20over%20%24650m). for 2024 this is $123.2M.

This leaves a WCC pool of $1,077M to be split between the teams based on their place in the 2023 WCC. 6% for last, then equal increments for each place up to 14% for the WCC.

So that gives the following table for what each team was paid (in $M).

|Team|Prize Money|PPM|Bonus|Total|% of total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Red Bull|150.8|31.6||182.4|14.4%|
|Mercedes|141.2|47.4||188.6|14.9%|

|Mclaren|122.1|6.3||128.4|10.1%|

|Sauber|74.2|||74.2|5.9%|
|Haas|64.6|||64.6|5.1%|

I think the best part was definitely the car designs, the were absolutely phenomenal. Great job on the design team for that one. The acting was quite good to, especially from Senna, Prost, and Lauda.

The race scenes were pretty decent. Most were nothing special, just your average high adrenaline camera shaking scene, but there were a couple of outliers, like 1984 Monaco, 1989 Japan, and 1994 Imola.

I think one thing they could've don't better was the Senna-Prost rivalry scenes. I know this is Senna's show, so obviously it's going to be more focused towards him, but I feel like it portrayed Prost as this big annoying villain when I'm sure in real life Senna was probably just as annoying too. I think Prost getting his own show would be nice.

I'd say an 8/10 is a fair rating. What do you think?

My guess is that if there is no bulge, the anti-roll bar of the car will rotate when the car turns, causing its rocker arm to contact the suspension cover. 

It seems that Mercedes started to replace a larger anti-roll bar rocker arm at the Austrian Grand Prix last year? How does this upgrade work? It seems that Mercedes kept the bulge design because it don't want to increase the height of the suspension elements?

1j0k5e9,Flexi Rear Wings - Was it legal when it happened last year? what changed in the regs this year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0k5e9/flexi_rear_wings_was_it_legal_when_it_happened/,2025-02-28, Discussion,"There seems to still be a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding regarding the infamous ""Baku Wing"" on the McLaren last year.

People keep throwing around phrases like ""the wing was illegal"" or ""it was illegal because the regs say the DRS has to stay closed"" 

The technical regulations in F1 are complicated and worded very specifically. I've formatted the specific regulations pertaining to changes made this year to make it much more difficult to achieve a ""Baku Wing"" effect. Simply the ""Baku Wing"" was legal. The FIA said it was legal, they just didn't appreciate it, said they would ban it and McLaren pulled it back because it was clearly going to become a problem if they continued to use it long term. 

(See strikethru bold vs. bold, Changes approved by WMSC on 11/12/24)

**3.10.1 Rear Wing Profiles** 

* Bodywork declared as ‚ÄúRear Wing Profiles‚Äù must: 
   * a. Lie within RV-RW-PROFILES. 
   * b. In any Y plane: 
      * i. Contain exactly two sections. 
      * ii. The rearmost section, which will be known as the ‚ÄúRW Flap‚Äù, must have a chord smaller than the chord of the adjacent section. 
      * iii. With the exception of minimal modifications to permit attachment of the actuator system described in 3.10.10 to the RW Flap, the sections may not contain any concave radius of curvature smaller than 100mm 
      * **~~iv. The distance between the two sections must lie between 10mm and 15mm at their closest position.~~** 
   * **Furthermore:** 
      * **c. At all points along the span, the rear wing profiles (as defined under Article 3.10.1) must have a minimum gap of between 9.4mm and 13mm. This will apply when the DRS is not in the state of deployment (as defined under Article 3.10.10) and will be measured with a spherical gauge.** 
      * **d. Outboard of Y100, the normal to any point of the profiles surface must not subtend an angle greater than 20¬∞ to a Y plane.** 
      * **e. Once the RW Flap is fully defined, a Gurney of up to 20mm may be fitted to the trailing edge. This Gurney is considered to be part of the Rear Wing Profiles and must satisfy the provisions of this Article with the exception of sections b (iii) and (c)(d).**

**3.15.15 Rear Wing Slot Gap Deflection**

* **With the hydraulic system active and the DRS deployed, a spherical gauge must not pass through the gap between the two elements within RV-RW-Profiles. The gauge will have a diameter of 85mm +0.00 / -0.05mm and a load of** **~~10N~~** **30N will be applied during the test.**

  
In simple terms: 

The language defining how the rear wing elements are allowed to move along planes angularly has been specified, as it was not before (310.1,b,iv being struck out and re-thought)

The test load of the Slot Gap Deflection has been tripled to more easily flesh out any kind of manipulation that could occur and be explained away as accidental or conditional.
