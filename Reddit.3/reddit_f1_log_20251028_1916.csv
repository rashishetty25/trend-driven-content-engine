Hamilton then continued to contest the position through to the second part of the chicane still literally side by side with Verstappen, returned the favour and forced Verstappen off, and again Verstappen at no point completed the overtake before gaining the position by skipping the corner.\xa0\n\n\nHow does this makes sense to anyone that the position was Verstappen's to keep so he didn't have to give the place back after going off?\xa0 Edging your nose slightly ahead at an apex but not getting your car fully ahead, or at least significantly ahead, is surely not defined completing the overtake.

The problem is everybody else involved getting away without a penalty', ""The whole thing was a mess, and I agree that Lewis shouldn't have been the only one penalised (or penalised at all, depending on how you spin it).\n\nHowever, the thing about Hamilton that I don't see acknowledged —and that I do have an issue with —is how much time he steals whenever he gets pushed off track. IMO, getting pushed wide and rejoining the track a couple of seconds ahead of the person you were battling into the corner is leaving the track and gaining an advantage. The same thing happened here: he was battling Verstappen into the corner, and rejoined the track comfortably ahead of him."", ""I see so many people who for some reason think just because Leclerc didn't get a penalty for turn 1 (he should've imo) that must mean Hamilton shouldn't get a penalty for the most blatant corner cutting in the entire race. \n\nIt didn't even happen on lap 1, there's no excuse, no mitigating circumstance. Lewis' best case he could make for himself was that there was low grip so he missed the escape road.

Bearman is getting more comfortable with the Haas and it's showing, I think in recent races he's done better than Ocon.
