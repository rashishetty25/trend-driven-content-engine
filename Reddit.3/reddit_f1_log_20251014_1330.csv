1o6a1ui,Most underrated F1 races?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o6a1ui/most_underrated_f1_races/,2025-10-14, Discussion,"As the title says, what do you guys think are the most underrated F1 races? Races that were quietly great but overshadowed by other races during the season?

For me, I would pick:

Brazil 2022: IMO, this is the best race of the season (even above Silverstone) but it gets a bit forgotten these days because it happened during the second half where Max started to dominate. Russell's first win, Merc 1-2, Charles getting tonked on the first lap by Lando but recovering to finish 4th, Red bull drama, Alonso recovery to finish 5th from 17th. The entire weekend was just great tbh starting with Magnussen's shock pole.

Italy 2023: Another race that gets forgotten because it happened during Max's dominance but it was quite fun, mainly because of Sainz fighting the red bulls and then the battle between Charles and himself. (No risk charles, no risk)

USA 2022: Another race overshadowed by Max's dominance but actually a really great race. Sainz getting tonked by Russell on lap 1, multiple safety cars, Alonso sent flying by Stroll but still recovering to finish in the points, Charles' majestic recovery drive and his (mini) battle with Max, RBR's botched pitstop which meant we briefly got to see Max and Lewis battli for the lead and, of course, Seb driving like an absolute madman to hold off Magnuessen on the line. (He even led the race briefly!)

Suzuka 2022: For a rain curtailed race, this was pretty good. Max and Charles tearing away from the rest of the pack in the first few laps was crazy (until Charles' tires fell off), Charles going off at the last few corners to let Perez through, Alonso and Seb's crazy battle to the line... a good race considering the circumstances. 

I am a newer F1 fan so I can't speak much for older races.

Furthermore, their lack of F1 experience could destabilize the junior team, but the hunger for a future champion often overrides short-term risk assessments in Milton Keynes.","[""I doubt Dunne will be in F1 in 2026 tbh. I think he stays in F2 and goes for the title next year with a view to take one of the Vcarb seats in 2027.\n\nAlso I'm not fully sure about his super license situation as there are some conflicting reports, but there is a chance Vcarb can't put him in next year even if they wanted to"", 'I believe Dunne has been linked to a second season in F2 with backing from Red Bull. I think the general expectation now is Max/Hadjar at Red Bull and Lindblad at Racing Bulls with either Lawson or Tsunoda.', 'Dunne doesnt even have enough SL points to move up next year', 'Current rumour suggest that Lindblad will get F1 seat next year.\n\nDunne would stay in F2 next year with possibility of F1 seat in 2027.', ""Idk about Lindblad. In the beginning of the season I was certain he would drive for vcarb in 2026, but now, he doesn't look ready. Sure, that never stopped Red Bull before, but I think they're more cautious now. Red Bull's wet dream, I think, would be Tsunoda evolve just enough to keep him there for 26, give more time to Hadjar to adjust to a new reg, and then promote either Lindblad or Dunne..or both for 27"", ""Tsunoda is out of the family as soon as Honda goes away at the end of the year, so that isn't crazy by any stretch.\xa0"", 'Dunne unlikely to get the superlicence. If he does, then maybe, but needs a marked change in results.', ""Certainly possible. Tsunoda is very likely gone, while Mekies seems to support him more and there is more of an acceptance that the Red Bull is just really hard to drive, his results still haven't been great, and with Honda leaving there's less incentive to keep him. Hadjar will likely get promoted and it feels a bit pointless to keep Tsunoda around.\n\nLawson maybe gets a bit more grace if they felt they rushed him into RB too quickly, but similarly it may feel a bit like he's had his chance. He has been solid in the latter half of the season though, likely they'd prefer to have one more experienced driver to compare a rookie too, so I feel like he'll stay another year.\n\nI feel like the lineup will be Verstappen and Hadjar in Red Bull, Lawson and Lindblad in VCARB. Then if Lindblad gets up to speed well enough, Dunne will replace Lawson in 2027, after another year in F2. I do feel like Dunne has probably been promised something at least, for him to have jumped ship from McLaren, but maybe it's just playing the probabilities that there's very little chance of him getting a seat from McLaren."", ""I wish redbull wouldn't just chew up and spit these young talents out when they aren't Max Verstappen. Give them some time to grow before putting them in F1 ffs. Accept that the success with Verstappen was a one-off and stop wasting good talent by trying to repeat it"", 'You need a benchmark.\n\nYou can compare Lindblad laptime to Yuki and know if it is fast enough.\n\nA laptime against Dunne will not say much. If both their laptimes are slow, the engineers will not know what happened: car slow, or both drivers slow?']",64,57,0.72,64,431,431,3,1,0.0,3
