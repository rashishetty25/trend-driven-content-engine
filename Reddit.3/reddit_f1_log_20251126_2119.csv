And it’s great to see Lando being such a role model inside Formula One, but also then especially outside Formula One.  
  
And I think that’s why also reason why he’s so popular, because he’s giving people that something else, not just, you know, racing. And okay, finishes 4th and finishes first. And you know, he’s popular because he wins and popular because of results and performances. But no, he’s giving people something else. And that’s what people appreciate. And if you ask people, they’re probably not able to phrase it perfectly. But I think that’s in essence why he is one of the most popular drivers on the grid. And I think it’s such a great thing happening.

1p6yhpg,Who wins Qatar 2025? A summary of some predictors,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6yhpg/who_wins_qatar_2025_a_summary_of_some_predictors/,2025-11-26, Discussion,"With the double DSQ and Verstappen win at Vegas, the last two race weekends of the season have become massively important—and with Qatar being a sprint weekend it seems it will be the most decisive of all. As a track:

* Qatar is high-speed with long, flowing corners, little demand for low-speed traction, and high sensitivity to brake balance and platform stability. Only one corner averages less than 100 km/h, with most well above 200 km/h.
* Overtaking is hard but not impossible with a big opportunity into T1 with DRS.
* Tire degradation is extremely high and tire deltas are essential to pass. Historically, it’s been a 2-stop race but this year Pirelli has gone further, mandating a 25-lap limit on each compound in the 57-lap race.
* Qualifying is key: in the 3 Qatar Grands Prix, whoever leads the race after T1 has won every time (twice pole sitters and Verstappen in 2024 starting P2).

2025 circuits similar to Qatar:

* Suzuka: Verstappen on pole, eking out a race win with Norris P2, Piastri P3
* Jeddah: Verstappen again on pole with Piastri +0.010. Piastri pressured Max into a lap-1 error and won with Max P2 +2.8s. Having crashed out in Q3, Lando recovered to P4.
* Spain: Piastri on pole with Lando +0.209 and Max +0.302. Piastri wins with Norris P2 +2.5s, while Max falls from P3 to P10 after a pitlane error (and more lol).
* Silverstone: Max takes pole gambling on low downforce with Piastri +0.103 and Lando +0.118. Race day is wet and he drops to P5. Leading, Piastri suffers a 10s penalty for unsafe braking and Lando claims P1.

**Max: 3 poles, 1 win. Oscar: 1 pole, 2 wins. Lando: 0 poles, 1 win (not on pace).**

History at Qatar (quickest on pace in bold)

* 2023 Sprint: **Piastri on pole** & Norris P2 in sprint shootout. **Piastri P1**, Max P2, Lando P3.
* 2023 Grand Prix: **Max on pole**\--Piastri P6, Norris P10 due to track limits, despite having the pace for P3+P2 respectively in Q2. Merc-on-Merc violence plus great race pace led them to the podium within 6s of **Max in P1**. (P4 was +34s.)
* 2024 Sprint: **Lando on pole**, Oscar P3 at +0.159s, Max P6 at +0.303. Lando led comfortably while Oscar in P2 needed DRS to hold off George, and the two swapped at the final corner. Oscar P1, **Lando P2,** Max P8.
* 2024 Grand Prix: **Max on pole**, Lando P3 at +0.252, Oscar P4 at +0.309. Lando in P2 drops to P15 due to a penalty and recovers to P10. **Max P1**, Leclerc P2, Piastri P3.

Impact of Pirelli’s 25-lap rule

* This surely helps Red Bull. With McLaren’s infamous tire wear advantage, this caps their ability to extend leads with low deg. over long stints or flip track position with it. Max is also right in his wheelhouse being able to attack flat-out when strategies are predictable.
* In McLaren’s favor, however, predictable strategies at this point in 2025 is perhaps a positive for Lando, who needs to avoid unexpected disaster more than he needs to dominate. And their tire advantage will still play a role over shorter stints.

Many are forecasting this race as a Piastri track on paper and a sure McLaren oasis among a bumpy last-half stint. I’m not sure how clear that really is. Thinking of Piastri’s performance at similar tracks earlier this year, it seems this ought to be a Piastri weekend. But those performances came long ago and before his dramatic fall from pace. His performances at Qatar also don’t even come out much better than Lando, and at Qatar in 2024 he complained of low grip, something he and Stella have made clear has been problematic this season.

For Lando on the other hand, who’s in the midst of a meteoric resurgence, he struggled at comparable tracks in 2025, and at Qatar has struggled with track limits, even compared to a grid full of drivers who have had brushes with it. And with McLaren’s DSQs in Vegas which they blamed on lack of data—and only one practice in Qatar—I can see them playing it safe with ride height and losing some performance.

Red Bull aren’t out in the clear with how unpredictable their performance has been, even at tracks historically dominated by them like Mexico. Max is very strong at Qatar (which seems a bit lost in the conversation so far), but he's struggled in the sprints. And he needs much more than a great showing, including help from Mercedes and Ferrari which this season is a crapshoot.

I lean Max but I don’t have a solid prediction. Just giving out info I looked up for myself. But to have a penultimate race weekend this important and this unpredictable is utterly fascinating.","[""Lando just has to stay close to Max and Oscar. That's all. The only chance Oscar and Max have is when Lando DNF's or drops out of the points because of a crash or technical failure. It should be a walk in the park for Lando."", 'Verstappen levels of technical writing acumen. This is great. Something that came to mind while reading this is whether teams will risk tweaking their car between the sprint and GP quali, despite the risks of messing up the car (i.e. Red Bull at Brazil), because there is so little racing left in the season.\n\nI have a quick question about the unique 25 lap limit. Do laps under a safety car count? Could we potentially have 7 laps of safety car that brings it back to a 1 stop race for teams that gamble for such a scenario?', ""This is so detailed!

Norris, Piastri, and Verstappen are currently all still in contention to win, however that can change in Qatar. No matter what, Norris cannot win in the sprint, but he can clinch in the GP if he:

* Outscores Piastri by 2 or more points (across the entire weekend) - unless Norris wins the GP, in which case he just needs to outscore Piastri by 1 point, and
* Outscores Verstappen by 1 or more points - unless Verstappen wins the GP, in which case Norris needs to outscore him by 2 points.

If Norris outscores only one of Piastri or Verstappen by the appropriate amount, that driver will be eliminated, even if Norris does not clinch the title.

**WCC:** Mercedes are getting close to clinching 2nd in the WCC, which they can do in Qatar if they:

* Outscore Red Bull by 4 or more points over the entire weekend, and
* Are not outscored by Ferrari by more than 10 points.

As with Norris, it will not be possible for them to clinch in the sprint.
