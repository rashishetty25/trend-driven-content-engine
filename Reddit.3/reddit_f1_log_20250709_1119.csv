In the past days we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating Hulkenberg's podium.

So in order to properly commemorate this historic event we decided to create a limited edition flair, featuring a limited edition emoji made by u/Blanchimont.   
  
This flair can only be claimed in the next 27 hours. So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance. If you change your flair back after the 27 hours you will not be able to recover the limited edition flair.  
  
To claim this flair all you have to do is to send a comment under this post including the words ""Hulkenpodium"" or ""Hulkengoat"" (and pray that AutoModerator doesn't crash and burn)

Given that he mentioned Canada and other sc laps, I think that should have been added.\n\nThe far more interesting (and due to the rule difference only relevant) comparison is to the other sc restart on lap 17, which was quite similar (just slightly earlier on the straight and therefore slightly different acceleration). Arguably, that caused more trouble for the mid-pack. Supposedly, that was already [seen ](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/the-data-that-doomed-oscar-piastri-and-why-his-defence-fails/)by race control as a potential problem, but they didn't ultimately refer it to the stewards that time."", 'Piastri got unlucky with the timing here but even if he didn’t get a penalty I do think this kind of driving shouldn’t be allowed in future races.

I can see how he would feel aggrieved at being penalised for doing something he’d done only a few laps earlier and not been noted for.', 'The most relevant point here is when the SC lights went out. If Piastri had already started to accelerate then he shouldn’t have been penalised.

Alonso was in points, so they decided to get Alonso on a more conservative strategy. The only bad thing about the inter-to-slick pit was that it was too soon, they should have pitted Alonso two or three laps later, but at the same time it was time to take some risks with Alonso as he could be out of the points.\n\nI see it more as a stroke of good luck for Stroll than Alonso being unlucky again. I can only wish he could get more of those strokes', 'The biggest problem was that when his inters were dead they pitted Lance instead of him gifting him track position over Alonso making him lose a huge amount of time\n\nNot just that the slick call was way too early', 'For not the first time this season, the lower qualifying positions use a gamble strat and wins big. Haas has done it a few times.\n\nUnfortunate for Alonso, but they’re always going to play it safer for the driver who’s starting in the top 10.', ""Stroll was just in the absolute perfect position to swap onto softs under the second VSC, since they knew he wouldn't lose too much track position (did he even lose any positions?) and would come out ahead of the existing slick runners. And then he was in the exact right place when the rain started to fall, to get off the slicks and onto new inters. I think frustration at how well that worked out led to the Alonso-onto-mediums gamble, which was just way too early at that point."", 'I love Fernando in F1 but he could be winning in other categories with teams that actually value him.', 'As much as I loved seeing a Hulk podium, I reckon Alonso could have held the P3 much more convincingly to have had the outside podium chance.\n\nWhilst I also get that Stroll\'s strategy was more of a ""fuck it, we\'ve got nothing to lose""; it\'s baffling that they wouldn\'t listen to their lead driver on strategy calls.\n\nIt reminds me of some of Vettel\'s final races; granted the circumstances were a bit different, but the Aston strategy calls when he was the lead car almost appeared to be in favour of getting Stroll a point, instead of consolidating the 8 / 10 / however many points that Seb was running in at the time', 'Got absolutely screwed. Same as when Gasly threw gravel on the track just ahead of him in Australia in low visibility conditions and when his engine expired in Monaco.\xa0', 'Stroll gets ""experimental"" strategies actually more often than people probably realize - he tends to qualify significantly behind Alonso / way too far away from points. It doesn\'t always work, in fact it doesn\'t most of the time but when it does it yields some very good results. \n\nFor Alonso, the big problem is, I noticed, is that the team is just very slow to react. Undercuts almost never happen, Alonso is often left out 2-3 laps longer than he should be, the tyre dropoff is also brutal on the aston which makes things much worse.', 'Alonso was basically given the same strategy as the frontrunners staying out and then pitting for fresh inters on lap 11 which most of the grid did. Hulkenberg was the first driver to pit for inters on lap 9, then Stroll and Hadjar both pit for inters on lap 10, before everyone else followed on lap 11. \n\nAt the time Alonso was up in P6 only behind both McLarens, Verstappen, Hamilton, and Gasly. I think Stroll had a lot less to lose being further back so he pit first for softs on lap 7 during the VSC, a very bold call that no one else on the grid did.\n\nSo I agree with you that Alonso was more so unlucky that he lost out because Aston Martin were playing it safe as he was already high up in P6, whereas they gambled with Stroll and actually benefited massively. \n\nBut they later also took a gamble with Alonso as he was the first car to pit from the second set of inters and switch to slicks on the mediums, which turned out to be several laps too early. \n\nOverall Alonso was just unlucky when it came to the strategy calls. So more bad luck for him which is kind of how most of his career has been.']",176,34,0.97,176,609,609,1,0,0.0,1

(Twelve because that's what the newest rookies have done so far.)

**Sprints are not included.**

**Race Head-to-Head:** Only includes races where both drivers finished. If a driver completed enough of the race to be classified but retired due to a crash or mechanical issue, that is treated as a DNF.

**Qualifying Head-to-Head:** Only includes qualifying sessions in which both drivers set a valid qualifying time. If a driver didn’t participate in qualifying at all, didn’t set a time, or their time was dropped for a violation of the technical regulations, that weekend wasn’t included and is listed as a DNQ in the table.

**Qualifying Time Differential:** Uses the time from the last qualifying session in which both drivers participated. For example, if one driver made it to Q2 and the other was knocked out in Q1, the Q1 time is used for both.

**Use of Average (Mean) for Qualifying Gap to Teammate:** Because the chart for qualifying gaps uses an average, some drivers were helped or hurt by a single bad qualifying session. The two most extreme examples in each direction are:

* Oscar Piastri crashed during Q3 of the 2023 Canadian GP due to weather, which meant that his lap for that session was 3.303 seconds slower than Lando Norris. If that qualifying session was dropped, he would only be 0.174 slower than Norris instead of 0.434.
*  Pierre Gasly’s teammate Brendon Hartley set a time that was 12.858 seconds slower during Q1 of the 2018 Azerbaijan GP.

1lvbg6m,Safety Car Restart Procedure,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvbg6m/safety_car_restart_procedure/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"The SC restart procedure has always been a bugbear of mine. I feel there are so many better ways to do it that don't involve slowing down significantly to allow the SC to 'escape' - possibly losing tyre temps and just causing general havoc.

Surely there are better ways to restart?

Option 1 - Send the SC into the pit a lap early - at which point, all vehicles are under a Virtual Safety Car. Paint a new line towards the end of the lap, at which point the VSC ends - and the front driver is now the SC and can restart at any point as they do now, with no overtaking until the SC line. They no longer need to completely slow down to allow the SC to 'escape' to a safe distance. Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap. (Maybe not VSC - maybe speed limited is the better wording)

Option 2 - Move the SC line further into the track rather than at the pit lane exit - meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap.

Probably many other ways to do it.","[""I think better communication would be enough. The problem at Silverstone was:\n\n* The call for the SC to come in was made late.\n* The teams didn't have any advanced knowledge the SC was going to be in that lap - the first the drivers knew was the lights going off.\n* Because they choose to bring the SC late they turned the lights off at a high speed part of the circuit, only Oscar could see the lights had gone out. Max didn't expect Oscar to slow to restart speeds (because he was unaware the SC was coming in).\n\nHad race control put the SC in notice out in the complex or - at worst- maggots and Becketts there would have been no issues. The SC would have had more time to escape, Oscar wouldn't have had to slow down to such a low speed to build a gap."", 'I like your options but I disagree that it solves the fundamental issue.\n\nThe problem is not that the SC has to “escape” because they really don’t have to. Under the current rules, once the SC light goes out the leader becomes the SC, so he can theoretically be chasing down the SC, so long he doesn’t overtake SC. \n\nThe problem is that the leader “feels the need” to get as much advantage as they can at restart, which means gaming the car(s) behind. I believe this is the thing to solve. At the moment, the way to do this (consistently) is to slow down and start at your own pace.\n\nThe problem this race is a combination of 2 things: safety car coming in message late (meaning leader cannot anticipate the SC light going out), plus Oscar continue accelerating and then slow down so abruptly AFTER SC lights go out. He could have coasted or follow SC closely, but that will diminish the advantage he could gain at restart.\n\nTLDR: there is no rule demanding the leader to “slow to restart speed” or let the SC escape. They do that to game the cars behind. That’s the real problem to solve.', ""Option 1. The point of the VSC is that cars are to maintain the time gaps. This is obviously impossible at the end of the SC period when everyone is bunched together. The problem is track layout dependent. Any track with a substantial front straight tends to benefit the cars following the leader if the front car doesn't game the situation somewhat. You'd end up with the situation that many race leaders going into a SC lose their lead when SC ends and this is what the SC shouldn't really do.\n\nOption 2 is just confusing."", ""> Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap.\n\nIt may? Mate, SC gets called in once it's safe to bring it in. Once that's happened, it'll almost always be safe to restart as well. You'd be delaying things by a lap in almost all cases of this.\n\n> meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap. \n\nAlso, this frankly hasn't been a valid concern since they disallowed overtaking before the start finish line. Before that, you need to create a gap to ensure cars wouldn't be racing past a safety car that's still out on track. Nowadays, creating gaps and whatnot is purely done for gamesmanship.\n\nIf that bites someone in the ass, it's genuinely their own fault."", 'I like it how it is. It’s fun.', ""I don't get all the fuss about the safety car procedure just because Piastri did some dumb shit.\n\nThe safety car turned off the lights at the start of sector 3 as it is normal.\n\nPiastri doesn't have to restart into the first corner of sector 3. He doesn't need such a big gap. Usually at Silverstone restarts were done into vale or even as late as the exit onto the straight, not before stow.\n\nBut an easy solution would be: don't allow high speeds before safety car line 1.\n\nPS: safety car lines have multiple purposes. You can't just move them."", 'The SC doesn’t need to escape. The slowing down is just something the leader does to but the rest of the field on the backfoot.\nPlenty of examples in the past where you see the SC pulling into the pitlane and the field just pulling away at the SC line. I think it was Schumacher who started the SC restart games.', 'Issues arise from the control being given to the leader, and they try to game the opposition. So take it out of their hands. Safety car controls the field until it pulls into the pits, and then they maintain the same speed until they get the green flag. Maybe even maintain double file formation on tracks where its possible. I think pretty much what Indycar does.', 'The safety car rules are meant to designed to create competitive racing scenariy, not ensure a calm and orderly restart.\n\n\n2021 in Abu Dhabi was a classic example of the FIA breaking their own procedure to try to make the race more exciting.']",11,122,0.57,11,117,117,1,13,-0.010000000000000009,1

Just watched an Open Wheel Opinion video on Red Bull and she basically said Max is balancing the car on a knife’s edge like Senna used to able to and that’s the only reason it’s placing so high. I agree but think it’s even worse, as in I think Max would have the same results he has now at Haas or Williams. At one point Red Bull development drivers were like almost half of the grid so what has caused this change in culture or ability for them to develop drivers? Did they just quit once they got their max Verstappen and not realize that time marches onward? was wondering on other people’s thoughts on this as even commentators are saying this and fans for years have been arguing. ","[""verstappen is good, the best on the grid I'd say, but he's not a magician\n\nred bull's car is not good and it has an incredibly narrow and hard to extract performance window, so narrow that even max falls out of it sometimes, but the performance IS there when max can find it\n\nnow, the question is, does a car like the alpine, haas or williams also have a supper narrow performance window that nobody has managed to extract yet?\n\nthis also puts a larger question around how we rate car performance (or more accurately how it's basically impossible to objectively rate car performance), because if you put a driver pair like isack and liam into every car you'd probably see the redbull be significantly worse than the visa cashapp buy 1 get 1 free car, but if you put max and lewis in every car you'll probably see the running order significantly change, maybe they unlock crazy performance out of some cars but some others are just as shit as they look"", 'Max is a superb driver. He can extract a lot from a good car. The Red Bull is a good car, just needs a lot to unlock it. \n\nThe McLaren is a great car.\n\nPut Max in the Haas or Alpine, he isn’t sticking it on pole around Silverstone I don’t think.', 'Perez, Albon, Gasly and Tsunoda are all solid drivers. Maybe not worldclass, but solid midfielders at least.\n\nThe car is the problem.', 'Its neither.\n\nThe Red Bull is a fast car, but a difficult to drive fast car. It has a strong front end and can be snappy.\n\nThat is different from a slow car, that is for example very draggy, or has a lot of understeer and has a low total performance potential.\n\nThe Red Bull is fast, but difficult.\n\nAND the second driver they promote are generally not top tier standout drivers. They promote solid, midfielders.', 'I think people tend to undersell the importance of time in the car. Max has been in the RB for almost 10 years, he’s driven it for every iteration as they’ve developed toward the car now. So it’s hard to drive for everyone, but Max hasn’t had to adapt so much. Whereas it must be jarring for other drivers joining the team.\n\nBut also idk 🤷\u200d♂️', ""Max is a racing freak but he is not god. You can't drive faster than the car will physically allow you, that is the ultimate pace or maximum potential of the car. The maximum potential of a car is no the same thing as how easy the car to drive or the car response to setup/ track/ weather changes. The car can be extremely fast but extremely sensitive or very easy to drive but lacking in maximum potential. \n\n  \nThat Red Bull car does have some speed to it, but its balance & operating window is so narrow that only Max Verstappen can adapt to it. Max Verstappen and the greatest drivers before him are very good at extracting the last potential of a car, but if the maximum potential of a car is lacking, i doubt he would be able to put it on pole and challenge for race win consistently at all. If you really think Max can drag a 2019 Williams car to challenge for wins then I have a bridge to sell you."", ""The car is notoriously difficult to drive but it is not a backmarker. Putting rookies in that car won't solve its issues. Perez performed well in it in the beginning, then it got worse. \n\nPut Leclerc/Hamilton/Alonso/Russell in the car an they'll perform. Put Hadjar/Antonelli there and you'll ruin another prospective rookie's career."", 'Redbull seems to have failed to develop the car consistently because for a long time it continued to provide good results in hands of Max. But comparing a car that has 2 wins to Haas or Williams is simply wrong, imo.', 'It’s a Stoner on a Ducati situation. \n\nPeople think of car performance as a smooth line but my theory is it’s more like a pyramid where it’s big steps so if you go a little bit forward you gain a lot of height. \n\nThe car is very fast but it’s also very tricky so if you’re not quite good enough to get into that next plateau of performance you’re a long way back. Easier cars to drive have much smaller steps so more representative of skill but the Red Bull has really big gains. Effectively the car development dropped Perez off a step and no one since has been out in the car who is good enough to get onto the same step as Max.']",1,188,0.5,1,1353,1353,-3,5,-0.010000000000000009,-3

1luxkb3,In equal machinery which driver do you think would win at each track?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1luxkb3/in_equal_machinery_which_driver_do_you_think/,2025-07-08, Discussion,"For some reason this thought popped into my mind while I was trying to get to sleep last night.

So I decided to go through each track this morning and who I thought would be most likely to win each race.

This is what I came up with,

Australia - Verstappen - tight with Norris. Albon and Alonso.

China - Russell - Prime Hamilton might win here, but Russell is quite underrated in China imo.

Japan - Verstappen - And it's not even close. 

Bahrain - Leclerc - He is spectacular in Bahrain. Shoutout to Gasly too.

Saudi Arabia - Piastri - This was a really hard one. Verstappen, Piastri, Leclerc and even Russell are all very good here. Piastri just beats Leclerc for me.

Miami - Verstappen - Very hard one to pick. Nobody seems to have always been clean in Miami. 

Imola - Verstappen - Verstappen has basically dropped a 10/10 performance every race he's driven in Imola. 

Monaco - Leclerc has been unlucky in the past  but is rapid around his streets. Shoutout to Ocon.

Spain - Verstappen did have a mad moment this year but it's not for a lack of pace. Prime Lewis might beat him but he was underwhelming this year so Max takes it.

Canada - Verstappen - Russell is good in Montreal, but this is a battle between he three world champions on the grid. Verstappen, Hamilton and Alonso. I'll give Max the edge because he's in his prime and he does not beat his team mates here, he destroys them.

Austria - Verstappen - I really wanted to give this one to Lando but Max's record here is incredible.

Britain - Hamilton - Verstappen and Norris are really good in Silverstone, but I have to pick Hamilton. 

Belgium - Verstappen - He seems to be driving on easy mode every time we come to Spa. Hamilton and Piastri are both very good here too.

Hungary - Hamilton - Lewis has been great here every race since 2017. Verstappen is very good too.

Netherlands - Verstappen - He's won here in 2021-2023 and then got a strong 2nd in 2024. Gasly is also very very good around Zandvoort. Lando and Fernando too.

Italy - Leclerc - Hamilton, Sainz, Leclerc, Russell. A good few very good drivers around Monza. I narrowed it down to Leclerc vs Hamilton. I guess we'll find out who's better this year. I'll go Leclerc (Shoutout to Ricciardo when he was in F1)

Azerbaijan - Leclerc - Perez not being on the grid makes this an easier choice. Leclerc is fabulous around Baku, especially in qualifying.

Singapore - Norris - Lando is fantastic around Singapore and every year he has raced in Singapore he's maximised his performance. 

USA - Verstappen has been incredible here ever since his rookie season. Norris and Hamilton (bar last year) are very good too.

Mexico - Verstappen - Another one of Max's great tracks. In fact Max has won by 12-20 seconds 5 seperate times in Mexico. (Shoutout to Ricciardo again when he was in F1, he was great around here)

Brazil - Verstappen - This is an interesting one. Hamilton used to be great here but he hasn't had a good race in Brazil since 2021. Verstappen is great in Interlagos, Russell is very good too, as are Norris and Sainz. 

Las Vegas - Leclerc - We've only had two races in Vegas so it's hard to choose. Gasly is great in Quali but had terrible race pace in 2023. I'll go with Leclerc as the best overall. His performance in 2023 was fabulous and he was still alright in 2024. 

Qatar - Verstappen - Verstappen and Russell are great around this circuit . Shoutout to Gasly again. Max just pips George for me courtesy of his race here last season.

Abu Dhabi - Verstappen - Leclerc, Hamilton, Verstappen, Sainz, Norris and even Tsunoda Quite a few drivers tend to impress in the final race of the year. Peak Hamilton might win here but as for right now it's between Verstappen and Norris. Max had an incident last year but it wasn't for lack of pace. He also won 4 races in a row from 2020-2023.
