Most changes on the sporting regulations are to largely bring them into line with the most recent updates (2025/04/30) of the 2025 regulations. Including the tyre regulations we had for Monaco this year.      
Some changes I did notice from a quick glance:       

* Grid drops at a driver's next race now have a 12 month period to serve them in. So Valtteri will be off the hook from his incident in the 2024 Abu Dhabi GP should he race next year.

* A document will be provided to all teams no later than the 30th June this year which details all the provisional information and limitations in regards to ERS-K usage and deployment for races, the following season. Any amendments will be confirmed by 15th September. Subsequent modifications may only be applied for new circuits or where this is a significant difference between vehicle fundamentals & FIA correlated values

* There is now a much easier to read list of Parc Ferme Permitted Works

I'm sure there are more. Same as well with the technical regulations.","[""\\>Grid drops at a driver's next race now have a 12 month period to serve them in.\n\nJenson Button return confirmed."", 'W for Bottas my fucking guy', 'Adding a couple of points:\n\nThere are some changes to the limited components. Gearboxes have been made unlimited this year, and that will now be carried over to next year\'s cars. And there will be a new limited component group, PU-ANC (ancillary components), with a limit of 5 of each Power Unit ancillary component. So those should be specific components that are part of, for example, the ICE, but can now be changed without changing the ICE itself.\n\nAnd regarding energy management, I noticed that in the last issue of the regulations, **for qualifying only**, they increased the limit to the total allowable reduction of driver maximum power demand from 450kW to 600kW and the limit to the resulting electrical DC power of the ERS-K from above −100kW to above -250kW.\n\nWith this newest issue, the ""for qualifying only"" part has been removed. So these limits should now apply at all times.', 'The total power reduction under full throttle is now allowed to be 600 kW instead of 450 kW at all times, not just for qualifying as in the recent rule change.

I'd change the stupid rule that you can't get points from two series in a year if the second one starts before the other one ends, but you can get points from two if they don't overlap like that. That seems completely arbitrary and pointless. Either get points from one series a year or two, but none of that nonsense. \n\nI'd make IndyCar worth some more points for places below 1st. I'd make F1 Academy match the other F4 series in points, rather than be lower than them, and I'd try to pressure them to use the same car as most other F4 series rather than a design based on asthetics- I know that's the FOM's fault, not the FIA, but I'd give it a try.\n\nBut the absolute main problem with the super license system is that the teams within the feeder series aren't remotely even.

Is there a reason why this would be more prevalent? Conditions looked dry, most drivers know the track well, I don’t think it has been re-profiled. Is there something about the current regs/cars which makes it more likely?

It's more common than you think."", ""It makes sense. Every event (even if same track) is different. Track isn't rubbered in, tire compounds change (year to year), changes in car suspension, different aero loads,  etc. This is exactly why there are practice sessions - so that drivers can explore the limits. FP1 is not about setting the fastest or cleanest laps. \n\nT1 has good run off w/o hazards (so very little risk going off) it is a heavy braking zone and pretty much every driver starts their run on the pit straight. Drivers don't have to play safe coming into it and tires are not always up to temp. This is where they would take risks as it gives a reference point for how much grip/braking the car handles for the rest of the lap."", 'Finding the limit, its a critical\xa0 corner aswell and technically hard', 'Ah!
