1hkvmr3,[Mercedes AMG F1] 23/12/2009: The day Michael Schumacher announced his return to F1 with Mercedes,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkvmr3/mercedes_amg_f1_23122009_the_day_michael/,2024-12-23, Social Media,,"['Damn, right after the Russell skiing post', '""Oh yeah 7 more titles incoming"" - some random fan in 2009', ""I wasn't watching back then, but it must have been such a crazy announcement to hear.

For people who had followed him in his first career knew he left too early, still capable of amazing drives. \n\nThe motorcycle accident definitely changed what he could do on a race track, there were some serious injuries, and one to the skull which generally results in a fatality. \n\nYet  the 40 year old improved every year till he retired again. In his final year he was faster than Rosberg in race pace and they were 10-10 in Quali. Rosberg in his prime against a 43 year old, who also got pole in Monaco.\n\nMichael in my opinion is in the top 3 of Grand Prix racing. Wish he could be in the paddock and part of the current formula 1 culture. #KeepFightingMichael', ""I had pretty much stopped watching F1 regularly once he retired in 2006. By 2009, my cable tv package no longer had the sports channel that broadcast F1. I remember being so excited hearing Schumi's come back, i switched to a more expensive cable package. His first test was in a GP2 car, he came within 4/10ths of the lap record sitting in a race car for the first time in over 3 yrs and in a machinery completely different to what he was used to. You could see he still had the pace between 2010 to 2012, but reliability issues, mid-grid positions prone to crashes and few unforced errors pretty much brought an end to his comeback. Ross Brawn would later credit Schumacher's feedback and work with the engineers are being the foundation for Mercedes championship success in 2014.\n\nWe now know both Williams and Mclaren tried signing Schumacher multiple times in the 90s and 2000s. It is anyones guess how many more titles he could have won had he jumped from one competitive team to another instead of toiling much of the 90s without titles at Ferrari. One of the greatest, if not the greatest driver ever to compete in the sport."", ""What people don't know is that Schumacher  had a life threatening motorcycle crash in early 2009.\n\nHis PR-team tried to down play it, but if you saw the leaked pictures with comments by his doctor at the time.\nThat crash was more than serious.\n\nThe fact he survived that one should have been a sign for him to stop. Mark Hughes some years ago  wrote in an article that a crash like this is 90%  fatal. \nMichael was insanely lucky. \n\nHe already had  permanent brain damage thanks to a shattered attery, he also had a broken neck and a fracture at the base of his skull."", 'Imagine if he stayed with Ferrari one more year, could’ve made 2007 very epic.', 'Myself as a youthful 18 year old was so excited to be able to play as Schumacher in the new F1 game that year.

And that window will keep changing as the car changes, which I assume is what Russell was alluding to, or if you stay too long without driving or driving in a different category.\n\nImo, Oscar is downplaying himself a lot, yes there is still a lot room for growth, but Baku had him matching pace and tyre managing with Charles, who is way more experienced than he is.', ""I mean, you can tell simply by how he manages his stints, which were markedly better than last year, when he'd get to a point and then just fall off a cliff and have to pit. I get that the opinion of Oscar's pretty low around here right now, but to just deny that he's improved in tire management is just wrong-- it's in his race pace and quali where the issues are, and while tires can be caught up in those, to say he hasn't improved at all in 2024 and this is all just PR is getting absurd.\n\nWhy do you bring Lando and the WDC into this at all? Why can't Lando and Oscar stand on their own instead of being used to drag the other's performance? This article is about Oscar 2023 vs Oscar 2024.\n\nThe Ferrari was a FAST car and Sainz and Leclerc are both a fantastic, experienced drivers. Of course Sainz finished on his tail. Leclerc finished on Lando's tail too. Lando is a great, experienced driver who had a phenomenal season in a FAST car after having eliminated many weaknesses his driving. Oscar is a great driver with signs of a lot of promise in a FAST car who struggled at times but improved on a few things from his rookie season. Of course he's behind Lando in tire management. Did we expect otherwise? Lando has four years of F1 tenure on him and is still improving. I don't think driver development is as linear or as clear cut as people here seem to think (e.g., you can't develop race pace, you have this many races to show your stuff, etc.).\n\nI think what we do know is that McLaren have two very talented drivers who seem to both push each other and like each other, and are both still learning their craft in excellent machinery, and that's REALLY fun to watch if you can block out the cynicism.""]",347,15,0.97,347,14,14,66,5,0.010000000000000009,66

Additionally, Marc Priestley said that Raikkonen was the fastest driver he ever worked with, even quicker than Alonso and Hamilton. Furthermore, Vettel mentioned in his beyond the grid that Raikkonen was the most naturally gifted team mate he ever worked with.\n\nHe's an interesting case for me, and the reason why he's an interesting case is because you can hear all these things about how good a driver Raikkonen was, with some extremely high (and over the top) praise of his skill level. But the problem is........that praise isn't really translated to his results on the track.\xa0 As good as he was, he doesn't really live up to the hype.\n\nI really struggle to believe that Raikkonen was this amazing top driver on Michelin tyres exclusively, and never recovered once Michelin quit F1. That doesn't logically follow for me, and seems like a convenient way to paint Raikkonen as better than he really was (of which, don't get me wrong, he was amazing, but what people say about him seems over the top). \n\nYet I can't deny that what insiders say about him tend to see it differently , that Raikkonen was actually **that** good.\n\nTl,Dr - simple question \nDo you think that Raikkonen was a driver, who early in his career,\xa0 was on par with Alonso & Schumacher?"", 'Isack Hadjar gave an interview to Canal+ a few days ago and when he was asked about things he must improve on, he replied ""basically everything outside of speed, as the speed is innate"".\n\nIs it impossible to ""teach"" speed ? Do F1 drivers already reach their maximum speed in their 1st season ?', 'Why do commentators keep pronouncing his name as ""Shaw LeClaire""?', 'Anybody have any info on a possible track in Rwanda/Africa?', ""Just having a think about the 2025 rookie FP sessions since the requirement is now four sessions over the season, two per car. My predictions:\n\n* McLaren - Alex Dunne will be in F2, but given that they didn't bother to hand Bortoleto an FP session this year, I imagine they'll stick with running Pato O'Ward and Ryo Hirakawa. Dunne might get one.\n\n* Ferrari - I'm hoping they run Dino Beganovic rather than Arthur Leclerc, since Beganovic might actually have a chance of getting to F1.\n\n* Red Bull/Racing Bulls - Hadjar will count for two sessions at Racing Bulls but that still leaves six to fill over both teams. They're clearly grooming Arvid Lindblad for a seat, possibly as soon as next year, so I expect him to get some sessions. Maybe they give Ayumu Iwasa one in Japan as well. I think it's unlikely that the other juniors (Marti, Goethe, Tramnitz) get any. They also still have Jake Dennis as a development driver and he did an FP session for RBR last year.\n\n* Mercedes - Antonelli's first two races will count. For the two sessions in Russell's car, they will probably go back to calling on Frederik Vesti since their other juniors are all 11 years old.\n\n* Aston Martin - Likely to be Felipe Drugovich and Jak Crawford sharing the sessions.\n\n* Alpine - Doohan counts for two, and they've just signed Paul Aron as a reserve so I assume he will get the others, although I hope they save one for Victor Martins.\n\n* Haas - Tough to call, since Bearman doesn't count anymore. They might run Beganovic if Ferrari don't, or they could run Hirakawa if McLaren don't; he tested with Haas in Abu Dhabi because of the new Toyota partnership. If neither are available, I guess they could dust off Pietro Fittipaldi who is still officially their reserve.\n\n* Williams - Likely to be Luke Browning for all four since Colapinto doesn't count anymore.\n\n* Sauber - Bortoleto will count for two, but as for the other two... I have absolutely no idea. They have basically nobody left in the academy after Pourchaire and Maloney left. Maybe they just give them to whichever unaffiliated F2 driver pays the most."", 'when do they start and stop the timer for the pitstop? when the car is completely stationary or when the tires are removed', 'Who is the biggest midwit in F1 media?

As the rest are trying too hard to be ""just a couple of lads having a chat"" even when they are great names like Autosport.\n\nThose who are not eligible are media people or ex racing people who happen to report on F1 like the ladies on the sky and F1tv broadcast. I\'m talking journalists.\n\nI don\'t want to mention his name as he might come across this but for me, it\'s Edd Straws closest confidant (not Glenn Freeman)\n\nHe just drones on and on when explaining simple concepts making them harder to understand. Until Straw comes in and says what needs to be said in a sentence or two.\n\nOr talks like some great authority and then back tracks and puts caveats when he realises that he\'s in deep waters. It really drags out the podcasts. I\'m always looking more forward to listening to the episodes when it\'s Edd, Mark and Glenn.', 'At his best years (2003-2007), Raikkonen was very good (dominating Coulthard and Montoya in 2004-2005 was especially good), but even in these seasons I don’t think he was at the level of Alonso and Schumacher, more the level of Button. He obviously had a stellar year in 2005, the best of his career, but in a weird sort of way, I think the 2005 McLaren’s unreliability helped the perception of him. If he won he was brilliant, and if it broke down he was so unlucky (but not lucky to be driving such a fast car!). \n\nHis career outside of the 2003-2007 period is pretty underwhelming. The only full time teammates he beat outside of that era were Grosjean in his first two years (who was starting to get on terms with him towards the end of 2013) and Giovinazzi. He was beaten by Massa in 2008-09 (during his prime) and was easily beaten by Alonso and Vettel across 2014-2018. I find it impossible to reconcile the general perception of him with his results on track, when you have to ignore 80% of a drivers career in order to rate them so high, there’s a problem. There are three possible explanations for his performances without Michelins. Either he declined abnormally early, he was horribly unadaptable, or was just never that good in the first place, none of which are particularly flattering for him. It’s probably a combination of all three. I remember Alan Permane said on Beyond the Grid he would sort of do the bare minimum, so maybe early in his career he could get by on pure talent, but later in his career being lazy caught up with him.\n\nIn conclusion, I think while Raikkonen was great at his best, even in these years he wasn’t as good as Schumacher or Alonso, and he certainly wasn’t as good as them across his whole career. He probably declined a bit after his title, (lack of motivation?) was very particular about car setup (which made him look really lost when the car didn’t suit him like in 2008, 2014, 2015, 2017), and was probably a bit overrated to begin with. Still the most recent Ferrari champion though.', ""Kimi knew instinctively the fastest way a car could go, unstable rear for extra rotation, just like Schumi and Verstappen also prefers. And if the car couldn't be set up like that, he didn't care.\n\nThere's also some other stuff about tires but that is too deep to get in to. He was the naturally fastest driver I ever saw in the sport."", 'I think a lot of Raikkonen\'s reputation and following came from his oftentimes blunt assessments like the ""leave me alone; I know what I\'m doing"" comment in Abu Dhabi. He never really cared for media commitments, but there were also times when his heart clearly wasn\'t in it anymore. I think he really only returned to Ferrari because Ferrari were very reluctant to promote Bianchi; not because Bianchi didn\'t deserve it, but because Ferrari were too conservative with their young driver program. When Raikkonen returned in 2012, he was very obviously doing it for the money, and when he moved to Alfa Romeo in 2019, it was clear that his best days were behind him. It was only a question of how long he was willing to trundle around in the minor points positions before he retired.\n\nSo in the end, he was a quick driver whose career is very much divided into two halves. In the first half he was highly rated and probably deserved more championships than he actually won, probably because of some mis-timed career moves. But in the second half he was struggling for motivation and his reputation was more down to his blunt interactions than his outright speed. He wasn\'t the same Raikkonen who had impressed in the first half of his career. He\'s in a bit of a funny spot for me -- both highly-rated and over-rated at the same time.']",6,35,0.71,6,31,31,-1,0,-0.06000000000000005,-1
