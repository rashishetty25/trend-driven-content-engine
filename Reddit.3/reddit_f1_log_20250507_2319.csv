1kgt8cf,Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess did he doing good anymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kgt8cf/yuki_tsunoda_is_currently_in_a_position_where_no/,2025-05-07, Discussion,"Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess whether he is fast or slow anymore.

Yuki began 2025 with excellent pace. In Australia, he steadily maintained P5 and even overtook Ferrari for P4 after the restart, but VCARB's wrong pit stop decision destroyed everything. In China, Yuki continued to maintain good speed and secured P6 in the sprint race, with abundant opportunities to claim P8 in the main race, but once again, VCARB made an incorrect pit stop decision, and then the front wing of his car exploded...

Clearly, Yuki with VCARB raced well and proved himself as the best of the rest, even holding off some cars from the BIG 4. RB also positively evaluated that performance and promoted him to the main team.

Continuing with Red Bull, after 6 consecutive years of struggling with their second driver, they and everyone else understood that their car is undrivable for anyone except Max. Their approach with Yuki has also changed. RB has agreed to let Yuki use a setup that is ""slower but more stable.""

This also leads to some questions: how much slower is this ""slower but more stable"" setup compared to Max's setup in an ideal lap? Can Yuki with this ""slower but more stable"" setup achieve better speed than Yuki with the fastest possible setup? Yuki himself lacks experience with RB's car, so setup issues may continue throughout the season.

Anyway, Yuki's speed was immediately better than Liam's. Yuki made a mistake in Japan quali Q2, but in subsequent races, he consistently made it to Q3. Interestingly, the race where he was closest to Max's pace (Bahrain) was when RB's car completely lacked pace, and even Max had to compete with Alpine and Haas. I've also noticed that Yuki's Q3 qualifying lap times typically don't improve compared to Q2 - perhaps he's playing it safe and avoiding crashes? Maybe Yuki doesn't know how to improve his speed further when he can't adopt Max's driving style? It's very difficult to assess.","['Yuki has been better than Lawson and miles off the mark from Max. At the end of the day that’s probably what RBR have come to terms with to accept. I reckon he’ll see the season out, because who else could they realistically throw in there at this stage? I don’t think they want to mess with Hadjar’s development.', 'at this point Yuki just exists', 'I love the stat Ricciardo mentioned when they were teammates, that all Red Bull winners have double letters in their name: Vettel, Webber, Ricciardo, Verstappen.

Probably applies to the majority of the grid', 'I think his biggest Problem is the Performance convergence of the Field. \n\nLets say the slower setup costs the car 2-3 tenths. Combine that with him not always performing perfectly and you run into the realistic problem that you arent fighting with the top dogs, but are firmly in the midfield. \n\nFrom that perspective i think that he performed adequat.', 'I think Red Bull are content with Tsunoda’s performance for now because they have bigger problems in the shape of the car itself. Marko said they don’t remember when they had both cars finishing in the top 10, so the bar had been well and truly lowered at Red Bull for the moment, and Tsunoda is clearing it at least.\n\nTsunoda’s promotion came with the realisation within Red Bull that the car was the problem. Red Bull know they have to fix that first and then assess him again. They also know there’s very little for them to compete for this year as long as the car stays as it is. The Miami upgrades didn’t work as much as they expected and Marko has said that Imola will be the last chance saloon for them. \n\nIf those upgrades work and they’re able to cut the deficit by a decent chunk, then Tsunoda’s performance will be back under the microscope.

As for the SF25 it might end up scrapped as it's simply not worth it to invest too much time trying to catch a soon to be 200 point deficit when you have a regulations shift next season. They should have done this switch for last  year and then this year the car would be right up there to try and steal a title before the reg switches.\n\nEither way, it's easy to talk shit now, gonna be a long one boys, strap in and hope for some miracles :D"", 'Translation \n\nAt the sixth race, Ferrari hit the lowest point of this start to the season with a performance far from the top. Just to give an example, in qualifying the SF-25 was only 2 tenths better than the problematic SF-23 . Better tyres (softer), better aero after two years of work in the tunnel, good efficiency in terms of top speed and DRS, no sign of porpoising. Yet the car practically never came to life except in Jeddah. A series of performances never in line with expectations while the operation on the tyres remains unknown. The Maranello team had a bad weekend where only the sprint, thanks to the weather that mixed the cards, once again rewarded Hamilton after a desperation move. Leclerc did not even start due to the accident with the intermediates, a questionable move in terms of evaluating the conditions.\n\n\nMcLaren was untouchable, even Verstappen had to destroy his first stint to resist in vain . The Miami heat made the MCL39 more unbeatable than ever. The spectre of a summer domination that would wipe out the competition\'s motivation looms. Everything depends on the drivers\' ability to avoid making mistakes.\n\n\nFerrari\'s potential unusable, the simulator says it exists but the track doesn\'t, here\'s why Vasseur talks about it\n\n\nIt\'s not purely aerodynamic, the car is simply running with mechanical settings that are inefficient for the race, this is compromising the qualifying. For some reason the engineers can\'t get the rear suspension to work as it should. It could be a problem with the anchors or the travel. From what we understand there is a new suspension in the works that could be combined with the latest big package but the timing is unknown.\n\n\nIt is a very delicate and totally unexpected change during the season , not rapid, if nothing else it clearly indicates where the problem is and that it is not strictly aerodynamic in nature. The hope is that the corrections work as they did a year ago , after the technical direction was suddenly vacant due to the departure of Cardile (who will take up a position at Aston Martin next July). At that time Vasseur took the interim but was certainly caught off guard as we entered a delicate phase. This could be a delayed backlash, perhaps the cause of some assessments deemed insufficient on the courageous changes of the 677 project.\n\n\nHowever, Ferrari cannot endure a long season that risks seeing it at times even in fifth place.\n\nCurrently in Maranello there are already two teams, one dedicated 100% to the 678 project in the works . A phase where normally dozens of different designs are tested, some extreme, to establish where the areas of greatest profit are. DT Loic Serra was in Jeddah where things worked less badly, at least for Leclerc, he was not in Miami . On his shoulders the responsibility of a triple and burdensome commitment: thinking of a good car for next year, curing the SF-25\'s illness, implementing (a lot) the quality of the technical choices on the track.\n\n\nEveryone asks the same question and it\'s legitimate: couldn\'t the Ferrari SF-24 have been further refined instead of changing it ""99%""?\n\n\nChanging the aerodynamic balance to focus more on the front end required a completely different overall geometry. Tweaking the gearbox and reducing the overall dimensions of the rear suspension did not pay off . The trap was just around the corner but could not have been foreseen in the simulations that only gave gains without any drawbacks. For better or for worse, the Venturi cars will remain among the most unpredictable and unreadable in the history of F1.\n\n\nAfter the stormy (in every sense) American weekend, it is worth underlining the words of the seven-time world champion reported by the BBC which now perhaps seem clearer: ""I think this car has really good performance. Something is holding us back at the moment, it\'s there, we just can\'t use it .

Further back Hulkenberg picks up his best result of the season with a third place, propelling him up the order from P18 to just outside the top 10 and settles in at P11.

Yuki still on the bottom end every weekend, seems like he is still very cautious in the pitlane, him and Alonso still failing to score a top 10 finish this season.

They are both very alike in that they will say how they really feel and can pair up to really get their points across. Neither of them are walking on eggshells like a rookie might be either. \n\nIf anything, Miami with Charles and Lewis being openly frustrated will help Ferrari go forward. Ferrari really needed to stop pretending things were fine. \n\nI am also of the camp that Lewis needs a new race engineer.

It must be frustrating year after year to make seemingly no progress, even when they do get faster others around just get even more faster (McLaren). Ferrari suffers from being Ferrari the same way Real Madrid suffers from being Real Madrid. If RM doesn't win the Champions its a failure cause they've won it so many times, Ferrari in F1 is the same thing even if the last time they won it was so long ago."", 'Hmm, I don\'t get the impression that this particular incident, which I wasn\'t aware of, is a biggie orso. In fact, I clearly remember that when they told him that they would try to switch the positions back when Lewis was ahead of him (and the first apparent try failed), Charles responded with a real cool (paraphrasing) ""No, no, it\'s good, it\'s good"" and then continued with asking about whether they were making any inroads on Kimi.

1kgykhm,I dont get it,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kgykhm/i_dont_get_it/,2025-05-07, Discussion,"I am watching Formula 1 since 1984. Some years really intensively and some years not at all. Currently I watch every bit of race of F1, F2, F3, NOT F1 Academy. 

I know that there are differences in talent, abilities and the car, of course and the technical part about a little wing here and there is too high for me, but I dont care that much. 

What I do not get is the ""driver style"".   
Max can drive the RB, no one else can.   
Lando could drive the last year McLaren, but not this years version

My question is: how come that a car can be so different from one year to another and why can a car be so difficult to drive for others and not Max?

I drove a lot of normal cars, not sport cars and no racing cars. I felt that some cars are different but I am a good driver and can adapt and can feel the difference and the measurements of a car. How come that professional drivers who sit in a Formula Car for years that they cannot adapt to changes? 

Additionally I am wondering how all cars are within 1 or 2 seconds during Q1, but there are always the same fast and same slow drivers/cars. I cant do anything at all with a difference of one or two seconds, how can they always be close, but yet so typical faster or slower? 

","[""You can adjust to different normal cars because you're nowhere near the limit. These guys have to squeeze every tenth possible."", '‘NOT F1 Academy’\n\nWhy? What has F1 Academy ever done to anyone?', ""I think you should reflect on how close to the limit all these drivers operate on a daily basis. Even the worst pay drivers, who are one second behind their teammates, are driving a Formula 1 car at 99% of its potential. And the elite drivers—like all the ones you mentioned—are competing among themselves with differences of mere thousandths of a second. You say Norris hasn’t gotten to grips with this year’s car, yet he's often just one or two tenths behind Piastri. We’re talking about minuscule differences that come down to feel—often from how the tires respond when pushed, the sensation of the track conditions, the behavior of the gear shifts… a lot of things.\n\nThink about something you’re really good at (let’s say baking cakes). There’s probably someone around you who’s also good at it, but one of you might be able to tell at a glance if the oven is overbaking the cake. And let’s not even mention Grandma Verstappen, who always manages to give it a taste none of us could ever match. Sorry for the silly analogy :D"", '>What I do not get is the ""driver style""\n\n>I am watching Formula 1 since 1984.\n\nI don\'t believe you', ""Why the ''NOT F1 Academy'', hmmmm?"", ""Interesting that you'd feel the need to clarify you DON'T watch girl racing, because that would make you less of a man."", '""NOT F1 Academy""\n\nWhy not? What\'s wrong with it?', ""They can't drive a certain car is a bit of a stretch, all 20 drivers can drive all cars blindingly fast. But we are talking about the extraction of the last milliseconds here, and at this level if a car's behavior collides with the driver's style, these milliseconds can add up and make a big difference."", ""They can all drive the cars, that isn't the issue.\n\nBut different drivers generate their speed in different ways, if a driver generates their speed by leaning on the front end on turn in, or by getting on the power early, or by getting additional rotation by slightly sliding the rear end.\n\nNow different cars have different strengths in terms of what the car will and won't allow you to do.\n\nIf a driver suddenly finds the car no longer has the front end to allow them to exploit their strengths for example then they will be comparably slower whereas if another driver generates their speed with a strong rear then they can exploit the car more.\n\n>how can they always be close, but yet so typical faster or slower?\n\nRace drivers can be incredibly consistent, even as nothing special, when I drive Go Karts my laps are generally sat within a 0.4 second window, F1 drivers are much more consistent than that.""]",0,113,0.15,0,105,105,0,0,0.0,0
