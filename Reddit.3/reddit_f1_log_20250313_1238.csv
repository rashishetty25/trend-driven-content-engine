People glommed onto the mathematical possibility in hopes of a run to the end, the reality is that but despite RBR's decline, they were still too consistent to overcome.\n\nWhen you're in the latter half of the season and still hoping for DNFs to swing the championship, you've already lost. Even if you win, it's going to be a freak fluke."", 'No. Too much went wrong for him to be able to get to a point where he had a realistic shot at winning it. \n\nFirstly McLaren didn‚Äôt have the car to compete until Miami and even then it was still sometimes hit and miss on pace. DTS I know illustrates it as if he had been underperforming until Miami. The truth was that there was no Miami car until Miami. Some days it was the fastest and it was dominant, others it was second fastest, other times it was muddling about in P5. The consistency wasn‚Äôt good enough on a technical level. When the Red Bull was dominant, it was *dominant*. When the McLaren was dominant it did so in bursts but could easily fall back behind Red Bull/Ferrari/Mercedes depending on the track and conditions. That‚Äôs where Max‚Äôs points comfort came from. \n\nSecondly, Norris‚Äô own shortcomings. Granted it was a massive learning curve for someone who started the year hanging around the bottom of the top 5 and ended it with 4 race wins and 8 pole positions. However he was not consistent enough when he needed to be. Would it have been enough to overhaul the points difference? Probably not. Even when he had perfect weekends, Max was right there behind him making it so no matter how far ahead he finished, if Max was P2 (as he often was) it didn‚Äôt make enough of a dent. Also when Max had off days, Norris also had off days (Spa, Baku, Hungary, Monza) so he was never really able to capitalise on those moments.\n\nThirdly, the McLaren pitwall. Sometimes the strategy was just so bad. How can you save a new medium for *a specific situation*, have that situation handed to you on a plate *and still* mess it up? There were times where the pitwall was static, as if they were unable to react to the situation in front of them and deviate from their pre-planned simulation. They were unable to decide what to do in Canada in particular which ended up costing him a win. But when it wasn‚Äôt the strategy it was that race engineer of his giving the wrong information or completely missing a double yellow flag that his driver didn‚Äôt know about because he was driving with tunnel vision. \n\nFinally, Max had nothing to lose if he crashed into Lando. He knew that. The points cushion was so significant that he could afford to play silly games knowing Lando needed the points more and had much more to lose with McLaren chasing the constructors title. \n\nCould he have been WC in 2024? No, there was too much against him including himself.', ""if you swap the drivers and their points since miami, sure max would've been champion\n\nBut it was landos first rodeo and its a bit unfair to expect that of him, but also winning in that car isnt a herculean task, nando, hamilton could've done it 100% and probably russel and leclerc etc"", ""Honestly? No. \n\nDTS highlights McLaren's mistakes for drama but all teams make them, they're not something you can 100% solve for. \n\nMy personal opinion is that McLaren knowingly went for the constructors and removing 'papaya rules' when they did was just a bonus round if anything. Even if they didn't make any mistakes a lot would have had to go right for them at that stage of the season for Lando to have overtaken Max and stay there.\n\nI'll be really interested to see if their approach changes this year should their performance hold.""]",0,42,0.16,0,296,296,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
