1hxssxl,"Jack Doohan’s experience at Abu Dhabi, and why Alpine are concerned ",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hxssxl/jack_doohans_experience_at_abu_dhabi_and_why/,2025-01-10, Statistics,"There’s a lot of talk about the expectations being piled on Jack Doohan by Alpine, and whether they’re justified or not. But after another comment made me look up some numbers, I decided to look into Jack’s testing at Abu Dhabi alone, and why the result he had at Abu Dhabi may have been the nail in the coffin.

In Abu Dhabi, Jack finished second last. Kevin Magnussen was the only person who finished behind him, but remember that Kevin pitted for fastest lap. Jack was last when compared to people on the same strategy throughout the entirety of the race. Flavio Briatore seemed less than enthused with this in his post Abu Dhabi video.

You can put this down to rookies being rookies, but it should be noticed that Jack has extensive testing in Abu Dhabi prior to this race. He has done the young driver tests in 2022 and 2023 for Alpine, and also has done FP1 at Abu Dhabi in 2022 and 2023. Based on the official timing…

2022 FP1 - 25 laps completed
2022 YDT - 111 laps completed
2023 FP1 - 23 laps completed
2023 YDT - 107 laps completed.

In total, this is 266 laps done by Jack in an Alpine F1 car at Abu Dhabi alone. Abu Dhabi is 5.3km long, so this totals to **over 1400km of experience at this track alone.** That’s 17.5% of the entire testing Lewis Hamilton did before his McLaren debut which is often touted as extensive - and he’s done that at one singular track.

Was Alpine really asking too much for him to do an better job at a track he has this much experience on? Particularly when he has experience with the A424 through FP1 sessions and testing days. Add in the extensive TPC program - this year he’s had Paul Ricard, Qatar for 2 days, Zandvoort for 2 days, and is it a shock that Alpine current have doubts?","['I don’t think people are mad about his performance: we still don’t know how he will perform, there’s no WDC hopes, he is not super highly ranked.\n\nWhat people find a bit odd is that all of this was known to Alpine. Hiring him and then immediately trying to fire him is just another example of that teams amazing leadership…\n\nAs for Doohan true performance, we will see. Rookies are even more rookies than in older times so they deserve a bit of time to adjust.', 'He also did extensive TPC in Abu Dhabi in 2024 before the race. That’s one of the locations Alpine uses along with Qatar. Which means it was the best race for him to debut. He even won Abu Dhabi in F2. Still, it’s just one race. Everything can go wrong in one race. Colapinto in Brazil is an example.', 'I chalk it up to him being conservative and not wanting to bin it on debut, which would have been worse case possible. I don’t think he’s a top talent, but let’s wait and give him a proper run in testing and at Bahrain. If he’s still proper shit well we get Colapinto back early', 'Big difference between testing/practice and an actual race. It was his first race at any level in 378 days - compare that to Colapinto who had 28 races in that same period', ""Wasn't he using Ocon's shit box of a car with half the upgrades that Gasly had?"", ""I firmly believe that there was something fucky going on with Ocon's car ( Which Doohan also drove).\n\nOcon went from being the faster Alpine driver to nearly 1sec off territory after he announced his Haas deal.\n\n Gasly is good but he's shouldn't be 1sec faster than Ocon on merit.\n\nThis Franco to Alpine talk has been going on behind the scene by the time AD rolled around. Alpine doesn't want Doohan to succeed. Franco is a decent driver too and he brings in a shed load of money and exposure to the team."", ""Feels like another Sargeant deal -- promote from within the academy to show that you can actually get an Alpine seat from within the academy, proving its worth, until a better replacement comes along. Except this time, the better option isn't from their academy it's ironically from Williams', being the same driver who replaced Sargeant."", 'Is it a big surprise that alpine is already toxic towards their new driver? \n\nThe most toxic team. Honestly at this point I think Renault should just get out of f1', '[“Theres no expectation”](https://youtu.be/c4uPjl9OXQc?si=oSJG0dL1C8sT3Tlh) All he had to do was finish the race and he did. Alpine should be concerned about their car not the rookie with one race under his belt. Well see what happens after round 1.']",2005,227,0.93,2005,6801,6801,44,4,0.0,44

1hxny6m,New F1 fan (existing NASCAR fan) with a few questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hxny6m/new_f1_fan_existing_nascar_fan_with_a_few/,2025-01-09, Discussion,"Hello everyone! I live in the southern part of the US and have been a pretty big NASCAR fan for almost two decades now. I just really got into Formula 1 about halfway (or maybe about two thirds) into the 2024 season. I just had a few questions for you all; I know I could likely find some of these answers through my own research, but I really wanted to correspond directly with some real Formula 1 fans, especially as there are not a whole lot of F1 fans near where I live. Like I said, I’m pretty new to this, so please forgive my ignorance if any of these questions seem pretty stupid! 

First of all, I really fell in love with F1 quickly. It is so much different than NASCAR, and so much more technical, that there is just so much to try to learn. Even though I became a fan in the middle of the 2024 season, I went back and watched all the races for the year (and yes, I did legally pay for this!), as well as other random races from years (and sometimes decades) prior. One thing I really love about F1 is how important qualifying is, especially compared to NASCAR. For a race like Monaco for example, I almost feel like qualifying is more important than the race itself (at least in terms of how well you are likely to finish). Anyway, here are a couple of real basic questions I have:

1. I noticed when watching races from previous years (and especially prior decades) that the engines all sound a little different. Is this mainly just due to regulations changing regarding the engines and their displacement, or is it perhaps from changes in the quality of the microphones picking up the sound? By contrast, NASCAR races from the 70s or 80s don’t sound a whole different than they do today, at least to me they don’t. To be honest, I actually think I like the sound of F1 cars from previous decades better than the current sound.
2. I admittedly don’t know a lot about all the drivers yet. However, I have noticed that a lot of the drivers seem to come from relativity affluent families, and oftentimes they are the children or some type of relative of previous F1 drivers. It seems like it would be pretty expensive to finance a kid’s career through the feeder series over the years, so it definitely makes sense that a lot of the drivers would come from families that are well off. This is true for NASCAR as well to an extant. Anyway, I was just wondering if there are any current drivers who grew up poor or maybe middle class and basically overcame the odds through talent alone. 

3. I notice that a lot of F1 drivers are quite slender, relatively short, and in general their fitness seems to be taken more seriously than in NASCAR. As a bigger guy myself, I was just curious if there have been any “big guys” who have had successful F1 careers in the past (let’s say over 6 feet tall and 200 lbs or more; for non-Americans, 6 feet is 1.8288 meters, and 200 pounds is 90.7185 kilograms)? 

4. Last question for now…I really want to go to an F1 race! However, it is quite an investment for my family and I, at least compared to NASCAR races. If you all had to choose between seeing a race in Miami, Las Vegas, or Austin Texas, which would you choose (assuming you are probably going to have to buy tickets on the cheaper end of the range)? I’m used to going to races at oval tracks where you are never really losing sight of the cars, so trying to determine sight lines for F1 courses is a little challenging for me.

Thanks so much everyone! I really love this sport and appreciate anyone who takes the time to reply…have a great weekend and stay safe!","['Welcome to the fandom! It’s quite addictive so be careful. Will try to answer to the the best of my ability. \n1. Yes, due to different engine regulations. In the last ~20 years F1 has gone from V10s to V8s and now V6 hybrids. In 2026 there will be another regulation change where 50% of the horsepower will be from the electrical side\n2. Yes, most drivers come from affluent backgrounds. The main exceptions in today’s grid are Hamilton, Ocon, Gasly to an extent\n3. Height isn’t as much of a challenge as weight, it’s just hard to keep the weight down. Most drivers are around 70-75 kilos so you can imagine it’s hard to be around that weight if you’re over 6 ft\n4. Of the American races I’d recommend Austin. Probably closest of the 3 to a NASCAR vibe, and is the better track as well. You’re never going to be able to see the whole track from anywhere, unfortunately, but turn 1 at COTA seems like a good place for the race start and a good amount of overtakes.\nHope that helps. Enjoy the journey!', "">I notice that a lot of F1 drivers are quite slender, relatively short, and in general their fitness seems to be taken more seriously than in NASCAR.

But generally not to this extent given racing drivers are usually not very long and neither big. Probably the most recent outlier in terms of height and weight and succesful has to be Nigel Mansell. He also drove for the most part in an era in which you would gain a lot of laptime for free by being light, therefore disadvantaging Nigel. But not even Nigel was 90 KG.\n\nBerger's height in 1996 was a problem when he switched from Ferrari to Benetton, given the car wasn't designed for a driver 10 cm taller than Schumacher.\n\nSo height and weight can sometimes be a struggle, height probably these days not anymore if you aren't 1.90m or something. Weight will always be a sensitive thing given nobody wants to be above the weight that is currently set for the drivers. Previously it was possible to just drive better but these days being above the weight limit would probably be a death sentence."", 'Part 1:\n\nHi and welcome! i can\'t answer all of your questions but I\'ll give some info.\n\n>especially as there are not a whole lot of F1 fans near where I live.\xa0\n\nJoin the club! There are a lot more F1 fans in the U.S. in the past few years, but still not a whole lot. I saw someone in my area wearing a team jersey recently and that\'s so rare, I had to go talk to them. We were both surprised and happy to meet another F1 fan!\n\n>For a race like Monaco for example, I almost feel like qualifying is more important than the race itself\xa0\n\nYes, in Monaco especially quali is super important. The cars are too wide and big for the track, the track is narrow, which makes overtaking difficult. It is typically the race each year that has the fewest overtakes.\n\n>Anyway, I was just wondering if there are any current drivers who grew up poor or maybe middle class and basically overcame the odds through talent alone.\n\nYes, it\'s expensive to go through the ladder to get to F1. Karting alone can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. A few current drivers were considered middle class: Lewis Hamilton, Esteban Ocon, Charles Leclerc (some will argue his family was semi-rich just because they lived in Monaco but they did not have a lot of money). Ocon\'s parents sold their house and the family traveled in a big van to his karting races. Talent does shine through, eventually, and then they can get sponsors to offset some or all of the costs.\n\n>I notice that a lot of F1 drivers are quite slender, relatively short, and in general their fitness seems to be taken more seriously than in NASCAR.\n\nYup they are all slender and not very tall. The two tallest are Ocon and Albon at 6\'1"". Most are around 5\'7-ish. They need a lot of core strength and not muscles (except their necks). Google ""Formula 1 driver\'s necks"" and compare them to other series\' drivers. The G forces in an F1 car are super high so they need strength to stay positioned in the car and for head stability. They have belts and other stuff, of course, but they\'d be moving a lot more if they didn\'t have core strength. There are a lot of videos out there about how they train their necks, it\'s very interesting.\n\nTheir athleticism is somewhat minimized by outsiders. It\'s January 9th and almost every driver has already started extensive training (multiple hours a day) to get ready for the season, which doesn\'t start for 2 months.\n\nMany years ago there were larger drivers, the tallest ever I think was 6\'4"", but in the past many years no one has been very large. Their weight effects the cars performance and their are regulations about it. You\'ll see drivers get weighed after every race', ""Re #3, since 2019 there's been a minimum weight for the driver+suit+helmet+HANS+seat, which was 80 kg (176 lb), and increasing to 82 kg this season. Prior to this weight limit being implemented, there was a sordid history of eating disorders amongst drivers.\n\nI remember seeing somewhere that the above gear (so everything excluding the driver) is ~5 kg. So once above ~160-170 lb, driver weight starts to become a factor that will ultimately result in time lost. It's something like .03 seconds per lap for every extra kg of weight.\n\nAs for conditioning, I think neck and leg strength are the main concerns, other than general endurance. F1 drivers notoriously have thick necks, given the unique strain F1 racing places on the neck."", 'Not a whole lot of drivers come from proper poverty or lower middle class. F1 is just generally not accessible to those that have absolutely nothing. Hamilton\'s dad quit his IT job to take a consulting position in same vein, that way he could flip burgers and wash dishes to have the money/flexibility he needed for Hamilton\'s karting career.\n\nOcon\'s family sold their house and lived out of a camper, again for that combo of money and flexibility.\n\nThere are even drivers that are ""richest kid you know"" level that still struggled financially en route to F1. F1 is just that expensive. Leclerc, Russell, Gasly, etc are all ""normal person rich"", and Leclerc is really closer to middle class, just Monaco middle class.', 'I’d say Austin.  Because it is cheaper, and you can spend more $’s to get better tickets.  Gets paddock or pit passes if you can.  Make sure you record the race at home to watch it after.  It’s way better on TV, but like NASCAR you HAVE to see, smell, taste, hear and feel one for yourself!\n\nF1 driver need to be in way better shape, the speeds and the G’s that the driver goes through is, am guessing but, 10 X that of a NASCAR driver.  5G corners, for 2-3 hrs a day for 3 days straight is why they all have strong necks.\n\nThere is A LOT to like about F1.', ""The best value ticket will be General Admission at Austin. Get there early and set up on the grass at turn one - you'll have a great view of the turn which has some overtakes, but also a view into the pits and be able to see the start.

I recommend COTA for a race in the US.  Great atmosphere and the races are generally very good.  Plus it’s a sprint weekend,  so more racing bang for your buck!\n\nI went to COTA in 2024 and had an amazing time!  Before you travel to a race, make sure you check out  \nr/GrandPrixTravel.  Subreddit is a great resource for travel tips to GPs! \n\n(I also used to be a NASCAR fan!)', ""Hi welcome to F1! Glad to have you! \n\n1) yes the engine regulations have changed several times which is why they sound different. There is quite a noticeable noise difference between the current V6 engines and the previous V8 and V10 with many people preferring the loudness of previous years so you're not alone in that opinion lol\n\n2) yes F1 is considered the billionaire boys club unfortunately it is extremely hard to get into without having money, family connections or both. The money involved is quite nauseating with karting costing hundreds of thousands of pounds and a season in the lower formulas (F2, F3, F4) costing £1-2 million. Drivers who are the exception to the rule are normally considered to be Lewis Hamilton and Esteban Ocon. There are others who might also fall into that category but these two are the ones who have talked about it at length for example it's well known that Ocon's parents sold their house and the garage attached (Ocon's dad was a mechanic) to fund his career and for several years the three of them lived in a caravan travelling to races across Europe. \n\n3) weirdly fitness didn't used to be such a focus of the sport and it's really only since the 90s to 2000s that drivers started really focusing on becoming as fit as possible so the further back you go the more likely you are to find drivers that are not the type you'd see today. Keke Rosberg is the one that immediately came to mind - he won the Championship in 1982 - but there might be others too\n\n4) Austin definitely. Everyone says it has such a good atmosphere and of course it's a proper circuit. Miami would probably be quite expensive considering celebrities seem to have taken it over and Las Vegas would be a night race so probably not the best for a family (assuming you have kids) also it's normally very cold so not the best to be sitting around the grandstands in."", 'Welcome!\n\n1. Just to add to what others have said, 20 years ago, they were running V10 engines that revved to 16,000 RPMs and the sound those things made was absolutely otherworldly and I will never forget hearing it in person. So yeah, it’s changed a lot!\n2. Lewis Hamilton might be the best example in the current field. His dad worked his ass off washing dishes as a second job and doing other things to finance Lewis’s racing career.\n4. Of the three American ones, it’s Austin and not even a particularly close decision. True race tracks are almost always going to be better for visibility and better racing then temporary/street tracks. However, you should also think about Montreal. It’s a fabulous track and Montreal is an incredible city, as close as you can get to being in Europe without crossing the ocean.']",88,58,0.83,88,305,305,10,2,0.010000000000000009,10
1hxki9x,F1 Airboxes,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hxki9x/f1_airboxes/,2025-01-09, Technical,"I have a question about the airbox/roll hoop. At first I thought it was the 2017 reg changes but now I'm convinced the Halo had something to do with this change. Before, most of the airboxes were circular but in 2018 they got wide and many still remain that way. What was the motive behind the change, were there any benefits, and why does Ferrari use a triangle airbox now if there are benefits to the oval airbox? The pictures are Ferrari's 2017 and 2018 challengers.","['The airbox has 2 main purposes, engine air intake and cooling. Ferrari run those smaller triangular airboxes because they prefer to use the sidepods for cooling. Other teams have more centreline cooling, so they need bigger airboxes.', 'I believe it was a shift to more centreline cooling, giving an opportunity to reduce the size of the sidepods to free up more floor area which was useful in the previous regulation set.\n\nI guess Ferrari went back because they can afford to have more cooling in the sidepods because of their increased size. In this ruleset the sidepods are larger to help control the tyre wake in place of the bargeboards.', 'Im pretty sure I‘ve seen this being discussed before and it’s been said that the halo disturbs airflow into the airbox to such a degree that they needed sized up to ensure the same functionality.', ""I don't think that the Halo is the main factor here. Ferrari switched to a bigger opening at the [end of 2017](https://images.motorsport-magazin.com/images/960/540/q_80/0855228.jpg) (added onto the original airbox because the crash structure can't be changed), and Mercedes ran a big airbox [since 2016.](https://www.speedsport-magazine.de/media/images/meldeliste/zoom/mercedes-gp-mercedes-f1-w07-hamilton-49764.jpg)"", 'There is absolutely no definitive answer to ""what\'s the best shape and size of an airbox intake in general"". As it **always** happens in the design of a car, the answer is: it depends.\n\nFor example, look at the size of the intake holes of the sidepods of each car. 2017: small airbox, large sidepods inlets. 2018: larger airbox, smaller sidepods inlets. The total amount of ingested air for cooling purposes is roughly the same (hypothetically), but this distribution was more optimal on the 2018 car. Why? They must\'ve seen that compromising the airflow to the rear wing was less detrimental than compromising the airflow under the sidepods to the diffuser (the famous undercut).\n\nOh and of course there\'s a whole lot of other considerations to be made. For instance, a larger airbox implies more detriment to the weight of the car and (more importantly) to the height of CG: it needs a stiffer roll hoop, that means more carbon fiber to reinforce that region, and the corresponding intercoolers are placed quite high. Instead, larger sidepods means lighter roll hoop and intercoolers being placed lower and closer to the ground, which is better for car handling. It all comes down to what is the best compromise for that particular car. It doesn\'t mean that 2017 had a worse configuration.', 'The RB19 had a relatively small and circular airbox', 'Look at how much smaller the side pods are in the second picture. The airbox is bigger because the cooling package was rearranged, there are many reasons for this that have nothing to do with the halo', ""I agree with this. Ferrari preferred to make a bigger airbox for 2018 to have smaller sidepods. Teams always have to weight in the pros and cons with both when designing the cars. \n\nAfter Zhou's 2022 Silverstone crash roll hoop regulations were revised to make them a bit stronger so that might have an effect on how cars are designed from 2023 onwards."", ""That's only partly the answer and seems to be more the case in the previous regulation cars (look at the much smaller airboxes on the current Ferraris). Nowadays, it's more that some teams are using it to supply air for some coolers mounted near the centerline (oil and gearbox coolers, intercoolers, etc.). Ferrari seems to be the exception to this with their, as previously mentioned, much smaller airboxes.""]",85,9,0.92,85,74,74,10,0,0.010000000000000009,10
