Having considered the matter extensively and having reviewed the new video evidence and heard from the drivers of both cars and their team representatives, the Stewards determine to rescind the Decision. The Stewards agree with Williams’ characterisation of the collision as a racing incident. \n\n29. The Stewards are satisfied that the collision was caused by a momentary loss of control by Car 30. However, in the Stewards’ assessment, no driver was wholly or predominantly to blame for that collision. Car 55 contributed to the incident by taking the risk to drive close to, and on the outside of, Car 30 when Car 55 had no right to room there and there was a real possibility that, if the collision had not occurred where it did, Car 55 would run out of track at the exit and/or a collision would have occurred at the exit for which the Driver of Car 55 would likely be predominantly if not wholly to blame. \n\n30. The time penalty imposed by the Decision was served by Car 55 during the race. The Stewards have no power to remedy that served time penalty by amending the Classifications but note that the gap between Car 55 to the car ahead in the Final Classification of the race (coincidently Car 30) was 17 seconds.

They clearly shouldn't have lost the knowledge or data on how the car exactly worked.

I absolutely love formula 1 and cars in general, and my dream is to one day become an F1 commentator.

My English is close to native level, and I’ve been told I have great diction. But due to the current gender conflict/polarizations in South Korea, I started questioning my dream. Would being a woman be a barrier if I try to pursue commentary in F1? Or are there any similar examples? I’d really appreciate your thoughts and advice.

EDIT : I realize being a commentator/becoming one is not an easy path AT ALL, and I’m posting this with that on my mind.
