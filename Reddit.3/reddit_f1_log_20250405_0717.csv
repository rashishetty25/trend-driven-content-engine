Their simulator and windtunnel don't correlate with what they are seeing on track. So the problems from last season are still the problems this season."", 'Translation and full article:\n\n> McLaren continued its upward trend on Friday\'s practice session at Suzuka. The papaya-shaped racers once again set the pace. Their biggest rival is Mercedes. Red Bull, on the other hand, continues to struggle with its car. We\'ve compiled the key findings in our analysis.\n\n> Four red flags in the second practice session cost the teams 38 minutes of track time. The long runs also fell victim to the interruptions. And on the fast laps between accidents and grass fires, much depended on how the drivers navigated traffic and completed their preparation laps.\n\n> The picture is somewhat distorted. The morning\'s long runs had to compensate for the missed race simulations in the afternoon. The picture is relatively clear here. McLaren is also setting the tone in Suzuka. Mercedes and Ferrari are following. Red Bull is still in deep trouble. The white-painted cars were completely out of balance.\n\n> Neither the base setup, for which the engineers had high hopes, nor the setup adjustments made in the afternoon worked. However, the sister cars from Toro Rosso once again showed strong early form. This is still impressive considering that Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson had increased their engine power for their fast laps.\n\n> Although Nico H√ºlkenberg had the best long run on paper on the medium tires, the Sauber driver was running on less fuel than the top teams and only completed four laps. ""The car felt decent, was better in the second practice session than in the first,"" H√ºlkenberg reflected. Both Sauber cars were equipped with the new underbody and rear wings in the afternoon.\n\n> **Is McLaren superior again?** Both fastest times on Friday went to a McLaren driver. In the first session, Lando Norris had the edge. His lead over George Russell was 0.163 seconds. In the afternoon, teammate Oscar Piastri set the pace. The Australian beat Norris by 0.049 seconds and Isack Hadjar by 0.404 seconds. The internal duel between the McLaren drivers was decided in the chicane. Whoever made the cleanest passage there had the fastest time.\n\n> The Papaya racers\' dominance continued in the long runs. Norris averaged a time of 1:33.361 minutes over seven laps, making him one and a half tenths faster than Russell, who, however, also completed three laps longer. The McLarens again showed remarkable performance in maintaining their lap times almost consistently, while their rivals began to experience noticeable tire degradation as the distance increased.\n\n> **Does Mercedes have a chance of winning?** Mercedes is the second-best team. George Russell felt comfortable right away and maintained his high level throughout the day. Even taking into account Mercedes\' usual early form on green tracks on Friday, Russell is the first challenger to McLaren. This is also underscored by the second-best long run in the first practice session.\n\n> The Englishman calls it a positive day and predicts: ""If everything goes well, we can finish on the front two rows."" Suzuka rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli is still lagging behind. The Italian lost more than a second to his team captain in both practice sessions. This shows that Suzuka is a track that\'s not easy to learn in a flash. Antonelli admitted: ""I didn\'t get the most out of the car in the first sector. George showed what\'s possible.""\n\n> Ferrari was just behind Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton beat his former teammate Russell by 23 thousandths of a second. In the endurance test, however, the Silver Arrows were faster. Russell averaged 1:33.489 minutes over ten laps. Charles Leclerc completed eight laps and achieved an average time of 1:33.566 minutes.\n\n> **How does Tsunoda fare against Verstappen?** In the first practice session, Yuki Tsunoda lost just 0.107 seconds to Max Verstappen. The world champion had to overtake six cars on his fastest lap, which reportedly cost him around three-tenths of a second. In the afternoon, the lap times were not comparable. Verstappen drove on soft tires, while Tsunoda stuck with the medium. Nevertheless, Tsunoda performed significantly better than Liam Lawson or even Sergio Perez last year.\n\n> What is worrying, however, is the overall shape of the Red Bull RB21. The car alternates between understeer and oversteer. Verstappen reported on the radio that it felt as if the car was bending. The Red Bull\'s severe sliding accelerated tire wear.\n\n(1/2)', '>Sporting director Helmut Marko was annoyed: ""Whenever the simulator cheers, the basic setup on the track isn\'t right.

I wanted to make this post because when I've mentioned Ryo in the past, many people have thought I was talking about Indonesian former F1 driver Rio Haryanto. 

Ryo had a really admirable FP1 today. I am not placing undue importance on finishing order in free practice, or making a big deal that he finished ahead of Gasly, but for how little time he's had in any F1 car, he did remarkably well. He wasn't afraid to push the car, and clearly Alpine had the faith in him to let him. Too often rookie FP1 sessions just have the rookies all at the back playing extremely safe.

Ryo starting racing at the quite late age of 13, after watching the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton won that day. Ryo saw those F1 cars, and he wanted to race. A year later, he won the 2008 all Japan junior kart championship.

Since then, he's had incredible success in Super GT, WEC, and Super Formula. But he's clearly always had interest in racing in the rest of the world and being part of F1. He stopped racing in Super GT when he got the opportunity to join WEC (and he won WEC hypercar that year, and the next year). When he got the oppotttunity to be an F1 test and reserve driver, he left Super Formula as well, so now he only does WEC amd F1 work. I‚Äôd love for him to get even just one F1 race. 

I‚Äôm not trying to take Doohan's seat from him. But I am saying that maybe he shouldn‚Äôt race this weekend. That was a massive crash. Also, the team has Ryo right there who knows the track really well and was proper quick in FP1. Maybe I‚Äôd just love to see a 31 year old man with an F1 dream who is super accomplished in other racing series to get than chance in front of his home crowd.","['I love the appreciation for Ryo, (our) member of Toyota #8.

Most strikingly F1 tempo does not indicate that Max lost all his time in the hairpin. I think the official one is probably more accurate and F1 Tempo is mostly being held back by the poor sampling rate that FastF1 provides (5 Hz).\n\nI also think it shows some care needs to be taken when interpreting the data from FastF1 and visualisations such as F1 Tempo. This can be important since some journalists/media outlets use this data to draw certain conclusions. \n\nExample: [video by The Race](https://youtu.be/q9UrEGSYfpo?si=PPt7u-lABglj_6ON&t=132) (time-stamp 2:12).', 'AFAIK they have access to 4 significant digits after the decimal. They only use 3 digits though. And polling rate is probably similar to those. 1000hz compared to 4-5hz is such a huge gap.\xa0', 'F1Tempo aligns some data points manually and they lose sector-by-sector delta accuracy. That\'s because publicly available data is sampled at a much less frequent rate compared to what F1 and the teams have available.\n\nOn my own app, I use resampling and interpolation + distance shifting to align the data as best as I can before calculating the delta. On top of that, I also align them by minisectors. Basically, I try to preserve the gaps at ""sector gates"" for the delta. It will never be 1:1 and depending on the quality of the data, there might be some error on braking zones, but I feel like the end result is usually more accurate than what F1Tempo provides, if you compare it across the entire lap.\n\n[You can have a look into mine here](https://i.imgur.com/a8CRtDg.jpeg)', 'Me dumb. Learn me numbers meaning please.', ""Definitely a very interesting topic. I've noticed that the accuracy of the delta from f1tempo varies from session to session. Sometimes I notice that the delta is off by as much as 0.3s-0.5s, while in other cases it seems to be spot on."", ""I'm not sure off the top of my head what a reasonable sample resolution would be here, but wow, 5Hz does feel low."", ""I think that it's not the sampling rate that's the main problem, but the accuracy of the data itself, incluing the gps positioning."", ""Is the y-axis reversed in the Official telemetry? What I mean is, Verstappen is in blue and he had the faster lap, yet the delta shows his line above Yuki's, whereas on F1tempo Yuki's line is above the blue line meaning that going up the y-axis indicates positive delta time."", ""Sampling cannot be an explanation for a bad delta, it can only be an explanation for missed inputs or inaccurate speed but only at most for 200ms. Their position on track and their relative time will simply be off for a bit but then update to accurate within 200ms at most because 5Hz is 5 times a second. This is plenty for an accurate enough delta. There's something else wrong here.\n\nIf anything, I wonder if the official one is wrong. Look at the speed graphs. How is it possible for Max to lose so much delta in that hairpin with those speed graphs? He enters the corner a bit slower, but has a higher minimum speed and exits it the same as Yuki. It doesn't make sense that he lost a tenth there.""]",113,24,0.93,113,123,123,4,0,0.0,4

No idea how they could realistically continue current regs with all the supplier changes next year.

They should had continued to develop the V10, pneumatic valves and semi-auto gearboxes.\n\nThe main problems with the V12s compared to V10s of that era, are that it had less torque while being a lot heavier and longer, thus shifting the weight balance further back. Also, when it was introduced it didn't even have a suitable and reliable gearbox and the drivers disliked it during initial testing.\n\nMcLaren only won that year because of Senna's talent and because Williams struggled early on the season with its new semi-auto gearbox that caused 3 or 4 retirements in a row.

And they achieved exactly what Mercedes wanted in handing them dominance, allowing their marketing department to talk about hybrid efficiency, and eliminating the chances of non-manufacturer F1 teams like Red Bull, McLaren, Lotus etc of being competitive like they were in the previous seasons due to the wild complexity of the new engines and the difficulty for a customer team in integrating them as efficiently as a works team.\n\nIt came to the massive detriment of the sport of course, with spiralling costs that put some teams out of business and cars that were slower than GP2 at some races, and vastly slower than the cars that preceded them. To save the embarassment of the incredibly slow cars they introduced wider tyres and bigger cars with much more aero in 2016 to cover up the inadequacies of the power unit. This clawed the laptime back but left us with the barges we have today that barely fit around tracks like Monaco.\n\nSo after a few years of zero competition, the engines did finally start to reach parity and all the teams were getting to grips with them, and we got new chassis rules in 2022 designed to improve the racing, which have worked reasonably well and given us the closest, most competitive racing we've had in years. This has led to upstarts like McLaren and Red Bull getting back in the mix again. So of course we've ended up with 2026 rules being announced shortly after this formula was introduced, designed to give engine manufacturers everything they want again with a complete disregard for the other teams.\n\nAll the data that people have been discussing has shown the plans for the new engines will result in much slower cars, and once again like 2016 they're looking for ways to enhance the aerodynamics to cover up the inadequacy of the power units, this time with moveable aero.\n\nI see the idea of switching back to V10s as a plan to ensure F1 remains a sport and not just a completely uncompetitive marketing exercise for car manufacturers, like it was from 2014 to 2020. It would result in cars that are cheaper to build, smaller, more nimble, more lightweight, and naturally faster.  \n  \nOf course the manufacturers are not going to support this. It's no surprise that the only manufacturers showing support for a return to more sensible engines are Ferrari, for whom racing is in their DNA, and Red Bull, who are only there to race and were effectively forced to become a manufacturer to survive the upcoming rules.\n\nMBS has faced a ton of criticism, a lot of it tinged with racism I find more than any real substantive criticism, but I do feel like he's consistently been doing his bit to push back against supremacy for car manufacturers and ensuring that F1 is a proper sport and not just a marketing exercise for car makers, from moves like this to his attempts to get Andretti on the grid."", ""I'm genuinely shocked by this tbh. All this talk about Road Relevancy in regards to other parts of the powertrain and then dumping a big ol' V10 in the back is very confusing. \n\nMaybe they're planning to up the electric output as well? 60% Electric and 40% ICE with the V10 kinda there for show? In that case wouldn't a V8 be fine? Hell even an NA 6 Cylinder would get the job done and fix the sound issue"", 'Won‚Äôt happen, but it would be cool if they went back to letting the teams decide again. Imagine V8, V10, & V12s competing against each other like the old days.', ""I hope they do V10's a little differently this time, it could mean allowing more addictive manufacturing or they can go full radical with oval/oblong pistons"", ""These pesky modern noise regulations don't play well with V10 's scream. So maybe a muffled via turbo small V10, under 3L, no EV systems, run on sustainable/carbon neutral fuel."", 'All this ""bring back V10s"" is just media noise.\n\nBS wants to make himself look more cool, while also make media not talk about his corruption.\n\nRealistically the timing of this could not be more stupid (considering new engine formula is coming next year) and it just shows how incompetent he is as the president of FIA.', 'this is just a distraction by MBS', '\n2017 regulations were horrible for racing', 'Great analysis of the whole situation, it was a good read !']",62,30,0.82,62,146,146,-2,0,-0.010000000000000009,-2

1jr6xff,Is it justified if Alpine get rid of Doohan early?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jr6xff/is_it_justified_if_alpine_get_rid_of_doohan_early/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"So going into the season there were a lot of rumours that Alpine would replace Doohan after about five races. And those rumours were fuelled by Alpine signing Colapinto and 3 other reserve drivers. They also never publicly said that Doohan would stay even if he performed well.

Many fans, understandably, were outraged and felt for Jack. He had barely driven an F1 car and there were already rumours that he would be out the door after the flyaway races that kickstart the season. 
His crash this morning have sparked more even discussions about this and I've seen people discussing weather Alpine should replace him. 

So let's go through his season so far and see what we make of it. 

In testing, Doohan performed well enough. He was close enough to Gasly and actually set a faster time on day 2. 

In Australia it actually got off to a decent start and thoigh he went out in Q2 there was a feeling he had the pace to go faster but was impeded by yellow flags after the Hamilton spin. 
So He would start P14, 5 places off Gasly. 

However come race day it was all over in 5 corners after he spun off as they left sector one on the opening lap. Many other drivers did crash that day so you have to give him some forgiveness but I feel as though this video https://youtu.be/d_6DFoHWBC0 shows the difference between a good talent and a great talent. 

In China Alpine seemed hardest hit by the new rear wing directive and Doohan was P16 in SQ1. But he was ahead of Gasly which went a little under the radar but was very impressive. 
 
The sprint itself though, was a bad one for Jack. While Gasly worked his way up to P12, Doohan spent the  whole race battling with the Sauber's before making a silly lunge down the inside on tub last lap and crashing into Bortoleto, spinning him around. For this Doohan got a penalty that didn't change his P20. 

In the main qualifying session he was out in Q1 in P18. To be fair, he was only a tenth off Gasly. 

And for the first time we got to see his comparison to Gasly over a race distance and... it was fairly impressive. On lap 33 he was only a few seconds off Gasly. From then on he was battling with the late stoppers Bearman and Stroll as well as the two stoppers of the Racing Bulls. 

They had much fresher tyres but Doohan fought hard, though he picked up a penalty for forcing Hadjar off. He still held Hadjar off for the remainder of the race but the penalty dropped him a couple of places. But finishing ten seconds off of am experienced midfield driver like Gasly in his first race distance is actually pretty commendable and why I think he should be given a bit longer. 

Yes his crash today was big, and the main argument for replacikg him is that crashes like the ones he's having will cost the team valuable momey they could use for development in this era of the cost cap. 

But if Doohan stops crashing so much and just cuts out the small errors I think he deserves to stay because he does have that raw speed in him. He has outqualified Gasly in one out of three quails and gotten close in the other two. Gasly is one of the stronger qualifiers on the grid and it's no mean feat to be that close. 

Admittedly Australia and China are two of Gasly's worst tracks but if we get to Bahrain and the gap is still small then Doohan deserves the time. Also Doohan isnt that familiar with these tracks either. When we get to more of the circuits he drove in F3 and F2 let's see what he can do. 

In F1 what often seperates rookies is their raw pace. A driver like a young Max Verstappen who is fast but crahses a lot is actually much more impressive than a rookie driver like Sergey Sirotkin, who doenst really crash, but also doenst show any speed. 

I think the reason Jack is crashing is all the pressure Alpine have put him under to perform or get fired. He's pushing the car too much amd crashing due to that. If he continues to have an incident per race yes he should be home by the summer but I think he has shown enough raw pace to be kept on until at least the summer break and if he is very good at the tracks he's more familiar with he should be kept on for 2026. 

TLDR - He's shown enough raw pace to deserve to keep his seat.

But I think he'll get it out of his system: he's a rookie.\n\nThat said, Alpine and Briatore could literally do anything and nobody would be surprised.
