1nwjocy,"2 minutes of Isack Hadjar speaking about his relationship with Lewis Hamilton.

Isack seems like a really chill, well-mannered young man.', 'It‚Äôs shocking to see how many Redditors think Lewis is dirty because of‚Ä¶ two instances? Let me introduce you to Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher and Max Verstappen.\n\nAnd it isn‚Äôt even a knock on them either, but let‚Äôs call a spade a spade.', ""I really like Hadjar. He's so open compared to how rookies usually are."", 'The silverstone crowd is back lol, lewis is a relatively clean driver. Isnt faultless but definitely better than most, especially some other wdcs. Just cause u know a couple incidents from freakin 2007-2025 doesnt make this valid. I think the only penalty points he has rn come from the speeding thing, he has incredibly low dnf-rate, and, while im also a max-fan, ur guy literally just drove into someone intentionally back in spain (im not mad at max, is part of who he is to go rogue once in a while and its not even that often)', ""Lewis , Fernando & Kimi - Very talented & fast drivers, World Champions and mainly considered some of the cleanest wheel-to-wheel racers. \n\nClean doesn't necessarily mean spotless , ofc they have had a couple instances during their career, but that doesn't mean they are 'dirty' drivers."", 'Hamilton\'s cleaner than most, but is pretty exclusively willing to get his elbows out if he\'s the car in the least compromising position, whereas other drivers give and take in more equal porportion. Hamilton is quick to avoid contact if he\'s the one that\'ll lose out.\n\nThink that makes his incidents particularly frustrating to the fanbase when it comes to comparing how ""dirty"" champions are. His incidents have a high ""success"" rate, and he rarely flies too close to the sun. It comes out as intentionally crashing people out, when in reality it\'s just knowing when to hold \'em and when to fold \'em.', 'let‚Äôs check with Nico now', 'Oh brother, all the hidden comments tells the tale. üòÇüòÇ\n\nLewis is such a trigger for many it boggles my mind at times.', ""I think it's fair to say that Lewis, like pretty much every multi-time world Champion, has dabbled in the dark arts of dirty driving from time to time. You do have to respect though that he's very good at (when he does dabble) of staying in enough of a grey area that he mostly got away with it whenever the stewards had a look. \n\nThat being said - when you actually watch the clip - it's pretty interesting that this is the 'headline' OP has gone for with a video where Hadjar is just talking about why Hamilton was an inspiration for his career.""]",3982,603,0.93,3982,12759,12759,33,10,0.0,33

We focus on stuff like ""you get"", but the bulk of the work is done behind the scenes. \n\nI\'m reminded of Riccardo Adami crying after Singapore 2023, and also Tom Stallard (now Oscar\'s engineer) saying that Carlos is the one driver he\'s stayed close to as a friend, and that just says something imo \U0001f979', 'Damn how can you not love Carlos after this if you weren‚Äôt a fan?
