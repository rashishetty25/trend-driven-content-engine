Generally if you demonstrated that you had the pace to get alongside a rival, they would simply let you go. It was just too risky to pull the kind of defensive moves we see today with the cars of the time, so this kind of situation developed naturally.\n\nThings began to change in the mid 1980s with the arrival of a new generation of drivers who hadn\'t been around in F1 when death was an ever-present like in the 70s and early 80s. The older drivers still stuck to the old rules of engagement, while newer guys were generally a lot more aggressive both on attack and in defence. Keke Rosberg for example gave a fairly lengthy criticism of Nigel Mansell\'s defensive driving after the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix, dismissing it as ""not Formula 1 tactics"" and giving an example of how earlier in the race he had let Alain Prost past because Prost had been able to put his nose alongside and was clearly quicker.

Nowadays you just do it and hope the other driver sees it coming and takes evasive action. Otherwise, you have a crash, you get out and then thump the other guy on the helmet.

The secret lies in the rpm.', ""Broadly speaking, there are a few factors that prevent it currently. From most to least important:\n\n- Turbocharger. Putting a turbocharger in the exhaust is great for power and efficiency, but has a significant effect on the noise output. Removing the turbo would significantly drop the power, so you'd need to compensate by increasing the engine displacement (the old V10's were 3.0 litres, and the V8's were 2.4 litres compared to the current 1.6 litre V6).\n\n- Fuel Flow Restrictions. The current PUs have restricted fuel flow that effectively limits their maximus revs to around 12-13k RPM. The V10s back in the day did not have this and revved all the way up to 19k RPM in qualifying.\n\n- Engine configuration. Because of the way the noise is created and the harmonics involved, a V6 does not scream in the same way as a V10 (which has a pretty distinct sound). You could make a larger, higher revving V6 that makes a better noise that's as loud as a V10, but you can't exactly recreate the sound of a V10 with a V6.\n\nFundamentally, if you want an engine that sounds like the older engines, you need a larger displacement, naturally aspirated design that revs higher than the current PUs. The more you move from that towards what we have now, the less noise you get.""]",6,13,0.72,6,13,13,-1,0,-0.050000000000000044,-1
