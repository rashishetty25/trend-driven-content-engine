Hope he does well.', 'I love how this massive project and ambition is another way for Max to relax. Dude just lives and breathes racing', 'Translation:\n\nAfter being launched in 2022 as an umbrella for the rally adventure of Jos Verstappen, the GT career of Thierry Vermeulen and the sim race activities of Team Redline, the next step will be taken in 2025 with Verstappen.com Racing by participating in the GT World Challenge Europe (GTWCE) through the support of existing teams. Chris Lulham, who comes from the sim race, will participate in the GTCE Endurance Cup with GTCE drivers Harry King and Thierry Vermeulen in an Aston Martin Vantage AMR GT3 EVO. Next weekend they have their first appointment at Paul Ricard in southern France, where a 6-hour race is scheduled.\n\nOne of Verstappen\'s ambitions is to help talented sim drivers make the step to the real circuit. He wants to prove that sim racing can be a great substitute for a career through karting, which not everyone has the money for. The 22-year-old Lulham is the first sim racer chosen by Verstappen for this. ""Chris has a long track record at Team Redline, Max\'s sim race team,"" Raymond Vermeulen told Motorsport.com. ""Max has a high hat on him, because he always comes with good feedback when adjusting the virtual car. Last year, he once invited Chris for a private test. He got in and had a good speed from the first lap, even though the conditions on the track were very difficult at that time. This made it clear to us that he has a lot of talent and can handle the transition from the sim to the real GT3s. Then we started testing with him more often.”\n\nThe 24-year-old King has walked a more traditional path. He started in karting before climbing the Ginetta ladder in England. After becoming champion in the Ginetta GT4 Supercup in 2019, titles in the British Porsche Carrera Cup and the Porsche Carrera Cup Benelux followed. Last year he finished second in both the Porsche Supercup and the extremely competitive German Porsche Carrera Cup. ""A fast, experienced boy, a real racer"", describes Vermeulen the Brit. ""After he happened to be available last year due to circumstances, we quickly recorded him for this year."" Vermeulen\'s son Thierry, who has been on the road in motorsport since 2020 and has been part of Verstappen.com Racing since the first hour, completes the driver cast.\n\nVerstappen.com Racing is working with an existing team for the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe: 2 Seas Motorsport. ""The relationship with 2 Seas Motorsport has been there for a long time"", Vermeulen explains. ""Nick Cristofaro, who after racing himself has set up his own race team with the Bahraini Isa Al Khalifa, is a good friend of Max."" Since the beginning of 2024, Verstappen has owned an Aston Martin Vantage, which he occasionally takes on the circuit. For these moments, he already called on the team from Silverstone for practical support. Vermeulen: ""It was therefore logical for us to also take this step with them to the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe.""\n\n**Despite his busy Formula 1 career, Verstappen is very closely involved in the GT3 project.** For example, he assists the drivers with advice and action during private tests and SIM sessions, but he also interferes with the livery, he has helped find a good basic adjustment for the car and gives his input to the engineers in preparation for the race weekend. ""Of course, he himself made enough meters with that car to be able to make a good contribution to the baseline set-up"", says Vermeulen. **""He also helped develop the sim models of the Aston Martin, so to convert what they tested on the circuit to the sim.""**\n\n**Ambitious goals**\n\nRegarding the goals for the first year of Verstappen.com Racing as a participant in the GT World Challenge Europe, Vermeulen says: ""We are ambitious. We don\'t participate to fill the field, we participate for the marbles. We want to drive at the front regularly."" Vermeulen acknowledges that this will not be an easy task in the extremely competitive GT World Challenge. ""There are big teams with a lot of experience. It will be powered. But we do expect to regularly fight at the front in our class.""\n\nLulham is also participating in the Sprint Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe this year. Together with Thierry Vermeulen, who is starting his third full season in the Sprint Cup, he will drive a Ferrari 296 GT3 from Emil Frey Racing. ""We expect to get podium places,"" said Vermeulen. According to Verstappen\'s agent, the fact that Lulham and Vermeulen are driving two different cars this year is \'only good\'. ""The Ferrari is of course a very different car than the Aston Martin, but that only benefits the development of the driving skills,"" he says. ""They have now tested enough with both cars, so we don\'t expect any problems if they switch from one car to another.""', 'I did enjoy the Redbull sim to real life mini series. https://youtu.be/Kdcjo7Ypdtw\n\nAlso I believe iRacing holds a competition for sim racers to drive real life F4 cars and receive lessons.
