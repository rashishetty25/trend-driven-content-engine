I am more than aware that races/seasons in past decades have been snooze fests and at times had very minimal overtakes - however back then it was for a different reason - performance disparity up & down the grid.

We are so damn lucky to have such tight laptimes right now... I can't help but imagine what sort of racing & storylines we would have in modern F1 if the cars were an appropriate size.

I have a theory that F1 drivers are continuously caught up in clumsy incidents, purely because they have no other option but to roll the dice. Racecraft has changed completely, focusing on getting to the apex first - then forcing the outside car off the track. It's dull. These are the best drivers in the world, yet their cars don't allow them to be creative.

Sure, here and there we get a glimpse of how it should be (e.g. Piastri around the outside of Norris in Monza, Max just being Max), but we could have sooo much more.

I just sat through the extended highlights of 2009 on the F1 youtube channel, and on multiple occasions Button made the same passing move as Piastri (lockup and all), yet he pulled them off because the cars were smaller, more nimble. The racecraft was impecable in the 2009 Brazil race, so many crossbacks, divebombs, setup moves. Almost every passing move, the car being overtaken had a genuine crack at passing them back... that is motorsport.

Sorry to rant, but it's upsetting to know we are leaving so much on the table right now.
