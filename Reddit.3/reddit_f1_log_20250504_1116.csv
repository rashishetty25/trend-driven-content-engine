I understand that this rule is one of very few possible ways of consistently stewarding and I also understand there is a difference in competitiveness between casual simracing and the pinnacle of motorsport , but I'd honestly rather have the inconsistencies from a few years ago back in exchange for giving the outside car more rights. **Ahead-at-the-apex should not give you 100% control of the corner**.","['Both drivers should give room.

“ However, following the Sprint it was confirmed that Albon, Lawson and Bearman had all dropped out of the points, with the Thai racer handed a five-second time penalty for not staying above the minimum time behind the Safety Car while Lawson received the same punishment for causing a collision with Alonso.

Bearman was also hit with a five-second penalty for an unsafe release from the pits, with these changes promoting Russell to fourth and Stroll to fifth while Yuki Tsunoda, Antonelli and Pierre Gasly moved up into sixth, seventh and eighth respectively.”

You can't force them off, but you have the line, so don't need to leave space.\n\nThe-Race video also shows the changes for this year when overtaking on the outside, and it was implemented on the Lawson penalty. last season, I don't think Lawson would have got a penalty.\n\nTo be entitled to be given room when overtaking on the OUTSIDE, the overtaking car must:\n\n*i) Have its front axle AHEAD OF THE FRONT AXEL of the other car AT THE APEX*\n\n*ii) Be driven in a controlled manner from entry, to apex, and to exit.*\n\n*iii) Be able to make the corner within track limits.*\n\nThese changes, combined with the dirty air increases this season, are likely really bad for racing, but this is what the drivers want and the FIA has listened.\n\nImportant to note that Verstappen was penalised for leaving the track and gaining an advantage, which is also covered in the video.

The best call for teams is to give up the position gained if there is an investigation by the stewards to not risk getting a penalty. In this way, they still have a chance to take it back.', ""Think about it front a traditional overtaking point of view.\n\nInside line:\n\nThe goal is to position your car such that the car in front can no longer make the apex. At which point you won the corner.\n\nThe responsibility is then on the other car to miss you.\n\nIn both cases piastri got on the inside enough to claim the corner. In both cases comfortably. \n\nIn one case Max went off and gained an advantage by not giving back the position he'd lost: Penelty\n\nIn kimis case he went off and ended up worse for it. No advantage gained:  No penalty.\n\nOutside line: same but you need to be much further alongside. Which is fair because outside passes are next to impossible, clean, with sinilar cars.\n\nThe ruling on how far alongside in both cases varies depending on the current guideline.\n\nIMO they are about right at the moment. Not so a few years ago when outside passes were awarded far too readily."", 'Your mistake is thinking Antonelli was run off the track.

F1 proposed a race in downtown Miami in 2018, just as the sport began to swell stateside. Residents in a majority-white neighborhood filed a cease-and-desist order citing traffic and noise concerns. The potential for an F1 grand prix down Biscayne Boulevard was quickly squashed by the city council. Organizers pivoted their sights to Miami Gardens.\n\nSilence for me but not for thee. And from another article I understand that the mayor disregarded the protest against the track in Miami Gardens and vetoed a law preventing the building of the track there. Unlike in Downtown and Biscayne, where he immediately backed down after the people there were against it. \n\nNo wonder the people living near the Stadium are not happy.', '“The F1 ruling body’s current environmental standards do not require circuits to think about a race’s impact on host communities, Orr said”\n\nI think this is something that could be improved. That said, with the things the article mentions, they seem to consider the host community quite well in Miami.', ""Lmao at the air quality actually being better during an F1 event.\n\nAnd the worst thing they could get a resident to say is that they don't mind the noise and it isn't that loud?\n\nBasically a nothingburger article."", ""It's a stadium. It hosts major events. Why is this even a story?\n\nThe fact that this one just happens to go around the car park instead of on the field is pretty much irrelevant."", 'All for critically looking at a GP’s local impact, but I’m not sure what real negatives to take away here? 18.000 jobs and the community programs they do sounds alright?\xa0', 'I have to say this seems so off base, \n\n“F1’s move to Miami Gardens followed a pattern: events that whiter and wealthier neighborhoods opposed – like the world’s largest hip-hop festival – ended up at Hard Rock Stadium.”\n\nWhat is the overlap between white wealthy (likely OLD) people and hip hop? It’s probably pretty low. I can see them opposing this, I get the sentiment there.\n\nWhat is the overlap between white wealthy people and formula one? Probably higher than the previous comparison. In fact I bet it’s probably one of the bigger demographics for F1 in US given that it’s been historically perceived as a European and elitist sport. Something those of wealth regardless of background or race are way more likely to watch I would assume. Why wouldn’t they want the race to be in nice places, they have them in Monaco and many other wealthy areas they’re likely familiar with.\n\nProbably because there’s truly a massive logistical difference between hosting a street course IN MIAMI vs. using a semi dedicated area that already exists for a purpose built track and already has procedures and infrastructure in place for large gatherings and mass exodus’ post-event. \n\nThere’s definitely a lot more to say here, but I don’t want to speak in generalities and I don’t want to provide an opportunity for any racist dog whistling so I’ll just say this: they’re making a lot of jumps that  don’t really line up to me as someone from south west Florida and with good general knowledge of this area.', ""well, they're black so who cares - america probably"", 'No worse than a football game and it brings wealth to the area.']",0,28,0.48,0,24,24,0,8,0.010000000000000009,0
