There‚Äôs no way all his past teammates are this bad. Gasly, Albon, Perez, Lawson all over 6 tenths or more slower than Max in the same car. Hell, Perez was closer in the 2020 RP than he was in 2021 RB, meaning RP was probably the 2nd quickest car in 2020, but Max is just an alien.

It‚Äôs very early; but Albon will probably be at least equal or very very close to Sainz. Obvs it his first quali session, but rarely did drivers close such a deficit over a season and then gain it on top. 

I‚Äôm genuinely starting to think Max might have spoken the truth when he said in 2020 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 2 tenths faster than anyone else‚Äù.  And that ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù included the likes of prime or at least very close to prime Hamilton.

I haven‚Äôt seen this level of domination since Schumacher in the 90‚Äôs. Just levels above everyone. That generation was also made to look bad by him, because great drivers like Barrichello or Irvine who beat almost all of their other teammates, including legends of the 80‚Äôs but also future talents(hell, old Rubens was matching a prime Jensen Button; who wasn‚Äôt that far off Lewis) were absolutely demolished by Schumacher. And the media couldn‚Äôt accept Schumacher was that much better than everyone else, so the entire generation was just deemed weak.

I think Max at this point has the same effect, however this generation is more proven because we‚Äôll have direct comparison between Leclerc-Vettel, Norris-Ricciardo, Russell-Lewis,  Leclerc-Lewis, Albon-Sainz etc.

","[""Probably a mix of both. Max is an all time great calibre of driver but also the car is very difficult to find a balance with that gives the driver confidence.

I was at Albert Park today, and before qualifying, Botas was going to take a V10 F1 out for a couple of laps. I was super excited to finally hear an F1 screaming again, but to my dismay, he barely opened it up, was just puttering around, a Honda civic with an exhaust would be louder. Also, we used to have an FA-18 Super Hornets do a flyover too, that's been gone for a number of years too. Is this just a nanny state Australian thing, or is this global? Not happy paying $900 aud for a grandstand ticket and getting everything watered down. ","['It wasn‚Äôt a V10, the owner put an F2 engine in it instead.', ""According to the track shedule notes, it now has a F2 engine and gearbox in it, not the original V10. \n\nThe announcers at the track said it was a V10, but they also mentioned they didn't even know it was going to be happening, so they may have just assumed it still had the V10 in it."", ""That was an outrage. They got us all excited for a v10 and then gave us a turbo 6. What was the point of that after we'd just watched an f2 race"", 'The organisers dont care and told the residents to wear earplugs this year lol.', "">Also, we used to have an FA-18 Super Hornets do a flyover too, that's been gone for a number of years too.

Also Hadjar was seven tenths quicker than Lawson in Q1 and Tsunoda was 8 tenths faster in Q1. Comsidering the gap between Lawson and Tsunoda was not that big last year when they were team mates it surely begs the question, at least in qualifying pace, is the Racing Bull faster than the Red Bull?! 
Comsidering Yuki was less than two tenths off Max you also have to wonder what time would Max out in in that machine? What he still be third? would he be lower? Could he even be better? 

Also imagine telling someone just one year ago that this is a genuine debate. What do you all think?

","['One quali session is way to early to call anything \n\nA sample of 3-4 races and then we can see the pecking order\n\nAlso it could be very possible that RB have a solid car over one lap pace but lacking Race pace \n\nSo way to early to call', ""Not the first time over the past years we see a Torro Rosso looking potentially as fast if not faster than Red bull over one lap producing similar lap times. Not the last I'm sure."", ""Definitely not. RB found the right setup overnight and, like last year, when it's in the right window, it's fast. \n\nThat also wasn't Max's potential fastest lap. He was down in one of the sectors on that last lap so the gap is actually a little bigger.\n\nThis shouldn't take anything away from Yuki though. Great performance."", 'No', 'Regardless, it would be insightful to see all 20 drivers drive that RBR at the end of the season before we completely scrap the car for new regulations.
