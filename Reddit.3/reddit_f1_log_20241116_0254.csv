1gru00i,[Tobi Gr√ºner] Formula 1 is working on a rule change for 2026 to make life harder for customer teams like RB or Haas. If a team finishes P5 or higher in the WCC it has to design all non-listed parts (TRC) on their own (after a period of 3 years),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gru00i/tobi_gr√ºner_formula_1_is_working_on_a_rule_change/,2024-11-15, News,,"['From the linked article: ""While Toro Rosso (Racing Bulls) is open to the proposal, Haas team boss Ayao Komatsu has already announced his opposition.
