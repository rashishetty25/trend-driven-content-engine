He is well known for talking shit.\xa0', ""Even if Bernie knew at the time, he was 'only' the promotor. The question is if Max Mosely (FIA president) and Charlie Whiting (Race director) knew about it / chose not to take action. As both have passed away, we will never know. I will be very surprised if Massa gets the compensation he is seeking."", 'Well...that is certainly a way to look at it. If I dropped 10 points on a mistake and then another 10 points on ""crashgate"" then lost the title by 7 points...I certainly would feel like crashgate cost me the title.\n\nYou can\'t just pick and choose which events could or could not have taken place to make up those 7 points. If crash gate doesn\'t happen, does Massa win? That is the only question that matters really.', 'Massa will not get a title. They won’t take it away from Hamilton. That is not the point. \n\nThe point is to get compensation on the lost bonuses and revenue of having been a world champion. \n\nI think it’s a fair claim. And I would take my chances on this lawsuit if I had the grounds for it.', 'Let’s be very honest about this: was anyone truly thinking Massa was gonna be crowned 2008 champion? Because I think anyone with half a brain saw that he was only doing this for compensation, which he might not even get. All Massa has accomplished in the last two years since he announced he was taking this to court was waste everyone’s time, including himself.\xa0\n\nYes, the crash was planned by Renault and Briatore, but it wasn’t Renault or Briatore who fucked up his pit stop that night. It wasn’t Renault or Briatore who spun 100 times at Silverstone. It wasn’t Renault or Briatore who spun out from a comfortable podium position in Malaysia. It wasn’t Renault or Briatore who spun out on the first lap in Australia.', ""Well, in theory both did\n\nTbf, massa and Ferrari aren't the only ones to have made made mistakes during the year, Hamilton also dropped points"", 'The comical thing about all this is Massa choosing to ignore the bullshit penalty that Hamilton got in Spa that year and also the drive through penalty he got away with for an unsafe release in Valencia.', ""Honestly, filing a claim that he wss stripped of the title because Piquet Jr crashed is so ridiculous. Has he even watched that race? After the pit boom failed, he was useless. Kimi was behind him during The Stop, and he made it up to 4th before crashing himself. Massa just plonked around at the back.\n\nIt honestly doesn't matter what Bernie said, this whole thing is absurd at minimum.\n\nWhy should the FIA void the race because of yet another Ferrari blunder?\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I would then question every team orders episode, as it's effectively the same thing."", 'Obviously yes. He drove off with his fuel hose still attached that race.\n\nMassa must be broke as it makes no sense to chase this so much', ""Exactly. The reason he lost the title was because his team didn't disconnect the fuel hose, not because of crashgate. If he'd had a normal pit stop in that race he'd have finished in the points and won the world championship. What caused the safety car that made him pit is irrelevant.\n\nAnd also, why would they cancel the results of the entire race because Renault cheated? Surely the correct action would be to disqualify Renault which wouldn't affect Massa's points at all, in fact that would give Hamilton 2 extra points.""]",1644,307,0.97,1644,5828,5828,14,5,0.0,14

Well for me the explanation is very clear, he's scared of flying! Here is some data to back up my nonsensical theory:

NED 25

BEL 32

AUT 18

ESP 25

EMI 15

Average: 15.91 per weekend.

  
As you can see, Piastri's points per weekend goes down by 4.2 points on average when at a ""flyaway"" Grand Prix. The **only** explanation for this is that Piastri is scared of flying! How else could anyone explain that dip in form? With the final four Grand Prix taking place far away from Piastri's home of Monaco, expect his performances to suffer as a result.

To remain in contention after Brazil, he will need to outscore Norris by 15 points and Piastri by 16. For him to win the championship, he would need to win every race from now on, and hope that Norris scores no more than 17 points, Piastri no more than 18, and Verstappen no more than 53 over all remaining races.

Despite Norris retaking the lead in WDC by one point, Piastri remains ahead in number of wins. This means that whichever McLaren scores the most points in Brazil will walk away with the lead, even if Piastri only outscores Norris by 1 point. The singular exception to this would be if Norris scores 0 in the sprint and wins the race, while Piastri wins the sprint and is 2nd in the race. In that case, both drivers would end the weekend on 382 points and tied on 7 wins. Norris would then be ahead on 2nd place countback, with 8 to Piastri's 4.

It is not currently possible for a driver to clinch before Abu Dhabi simply by winning everything. If Norris were to win everything and Piastri come 2nd in everything, they would go into Abu Dhabi separated by 24 points, making it technically possible for Piastri to win in the final race.

**WCC:** Ferrari outscored Mercedes just enough to retake 2nd by 1 point, and while Red Bull did outscore Mercedes, it was only by 1 point (I'm sensing a 1 point theme here...). This means that once again, 2nd place is on offer for all three teams:

* Ferrari needs to outscore (or score the same as) Mercedes and not be outscored by 10 or more points by Red Bull to retain 2nd
* Mercedes needs to outscore Ferrari by any amount and not be outscored by Red Bull by 9 or more points to retake 2nd
* Red Bull needs to outscore Ferrari by at least 10 points and Mercedes by at least 9 to move up to 2nd

Williams is also officially out of the fight for 2nd, and will now have to settle for a best possible finish of 5th.

^(Note: the best and worst finishing positions are rough calculations, and assume that multiple drivers can finish in the same position. Obviously this is not possible, but there are) *^(670 billion scoring possibilities in each GP)* ^(and) *^(5 billion in each sprint;)* ^(so it's not exactly practical to figure out the true best and worst positions.

Rather than BoP, everyone stays under the same regulations; if a manufacturer is clearly behind after early-season reviews, the FIA may allow **extra test-bench hours**, small **cost-cap allowances** and limited **re-homologation** paths to close reliability/performance gaps. Media reports suggest formal review points during the season, with details still being finalised with the PU suppliers.

The number of parts eligible for ADUO has also been expanded a lot and now includes most of MGU-K, ES and CE. Only drawback is that they now have to combine all changes into one package.\n\nThe threshold has also been changed, although I dont know exactly in what way. Instead of 3% down on average ICE power, it is now 2% down on the ICE performance index, but their methodology to calculate this isnt public, I think. So I dont know if it's ultimately lower than it was before. There are then further benefits for every additional 2% deficit up to >8%, which is quite a lot. I am kind of wondering who lobbied for some of these changes in the latest ruleset. The new reliability allowance in the cost cap also considers some extremely high numbers in terms of components used.\n\nI am not sure yet what to make of all of this. With the upgrade restrictions on the new PUs being the way they are, having a safety net appears necessary. They have certainly made that safety net much, much stronger over the past year, and I think it's clear that they want to keep the performance spread within a manageable window.
