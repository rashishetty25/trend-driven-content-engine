On paper Norris still has the strongest position with his points lead, but the situation is a lot more fragile than it looks.

McLaren’s DSQ in Vegas changed everything. Since the floor was ruled illegal they need to run the car more carefully. They cannot push the downforce window as far as before. That affects qualifying, tyre management, race pace and confidence. On top of that Max still runs a newer engine while McLaren are stretching an older unit. The risk of a technical issue sits more on the orange side of the garage.

Max can attack without fear. Norris has everything to lose. That changes how both drive in wheel to wheel fights. Max is proven under pressure. We have seen him in these situations many times. He keeps the car tidy. He delivers when it matters. Norris has made mistakes this season under stress. Same for Piastri. Both are fast. Both deserve to be here. But both lost points because they pushed a bit too hard when the pressure was high.

Piastri is the wild card. A few races ago he looked out of it. Now he is right back in the fight. He can afford to take risks because he is not the one with the lead. He can swing for a win. That brings chaos into play. If Norris and Piastri end up battling each other too hard it opens the door for Max to do exactly what he does best. Stay clean. Stay calm. Pick up the points. And grab a fifth title.

So the real question for the last two rounds is simple. Who handles pressure best. Norris with the target on his back. Piastri with nothing to hold back. Or Max with the chance to punish every mistake in front of him.","["">Max can drive without fear.\n\nWhile yeah. Max is always going to be driving like a madman now. But 1 DNF for him and it's over for him as well. All three can't risk a DNF now. If anything, Norris is the only one that *could* survive a DNF in this title fight."", ""Lando still has a huge advantage. All he has to do is not do anything too silly and not get involved in drama and he's got it in the bag. I know F1 media will try to make it look like WW2, but honestly it's not that close. If he managed 2 clean first laps then he's this year's WDC"", ""Meh, as much as I am enjoying the chaos and would love Max to get the fifth title, Lando just needs to mind to not make mistakes. Las Vegas has not been McLaren friendly circuit since it came back on the calendar. The last two circuits should be good for them.\n\nOf course, never discount the team fucking up but otherwise, this should be in Lando's hands by the end."", 'All Norris has to do is outscore both Piastri and Max by 2 points in Qatar and he’s done.', ""Norris doesn't need to win any races or do anything special. As long as he brings it home on the podium he's champion. He has a 24pt lead and if Max (or Oscar) win both races and the sprint he only loses 23pts by finishing third in all the events"", ""> Since the floor was ruled illegal they need to run the car more carefully\n\nThis has been mentioned a bunch since the DSQ, but has there been any quotes or evidence that McLaren were doing it intentionally or is it speculation?\n\nIt's not like McLaren had issues in Brazil or Mexico related to porpoising or the floor."", 'We all know that Max was a big winner from Vegas but I’d argue Piastri was a winner in that it keeps him within 25 points of Lando.\n\nWould be absolutely bonkers if Max wins Qatar, Piastri is second and Lando comes 10th (unlikely). Would have Max and Lando on equal points. Piastri 7 points behind. But all 3 would be equal on race wins.\n\nWinner takes all in the final race (if my understanding on the count back system is correct).\n\nEdit: forgot the sprint 🤦\u200d♂️. I’m sure there is some maths that would make the final race box office (hopefully doesn’t play out like the last box office finish though)!', "">McLarens DSQ in Vegas changed everything. Since the floor was ruled illegal they need to run the car more carefully.\n\nThis sounds great for hyping up the next 2 races but I think should be taken with a massive train of salt.\n\nThere'll be lots of articles about it this week for sure, but the likelihood is they fucked up their setup without enough dry running and that's that.\n\nI don't think there's any real indication that the floor or their desired setup window is fundamentally illegal as they haven't had issues with it otherwise this season and they were good in Brazil after the change to the planks."", "">Since the floor was ruled illegal they need to run the car more carefully.\n\nI think people need to calm down a little, this isn't what happened. \n\nThe ruling was excessive plank wear, this happens when teams don't get enough good running in the course of the weekend to set their ride height at the lowest safe level. It happens when there are interrupted practices, inconsistent conditions, and sprint races.\n\nI do agree that Lando is under pressure and things can go wrong for him, but short of anything catastrophic the odds have to be in his favour.""]",1356,342,0.93,1356,320,320,489,42,0.020000000000000018,489

Welcome to the Day after Debrief discussion thread!  
  
Now that the dust ^(and manhole covers) have settled at the Las Vegas Strip, it's time to **calmly** discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more **detailed and thoughtful discussion** than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

I've always been into F1 for the racing bit but a while ago I started being interested into the technical side of the sport as well.

I was wondering, is there some information or a video I can access about what exactly the driver and their team are changing on a car's setup during the weekend? I can think of the obvious things like ride height, engine maps/fuel plans and maybe the general aerodynamic stuff with the wings. However, I know there's probably a lot more than that.

It's just getting increasingly more interesting to me how teams are able to get so many things right in just a few hours of practice to achieve the perfect car balance. I would imagine they have some general ranges for settings they gather through the simulator and past races. Also the technology is obviously a lot better than previous years.

But still, getting plank wear down to millimeters, tyre wear so that your wheels are barely hanging on by the end of the race... Those things are incredibly impressive to me.

Would appreciate anyone that's more tech-savvy pointing me to the right direction to learn more about this part of racing!","['I would look here for your answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/', 'You have better answers here\n\nr/f1technical', ""The F1 youtube channel have a series of videos called Tech Talk, and there's a good podcast from The Athletic called The Tech Show.\n\n\nSam Collins on the youtube channel makes things very accessible for newer fan or people not as technically minded. On the podcast, Gary Anderson is a wealth of info and experience but there might be more of a level of assumed knowledge there."", 'Ride height, rake, cross weight, camber, toe, aero, springs, compression, rebound, etc', ""Watching f1 for the racing? Best joke I've heard in a while"", 'Stuff to make the car go faster or slower in corners. Faster or slower on the straights.', 'Just to expand on this answer since it’s about the only one that answers the question instead of linking to F1Technical…\n\nRide height = how high the car is off the ground. Lower means higher performance but we just saw the negative consequences of too low.\n\nRake = looking at a side view of the car, rake is the angle relative to the ground. Probably more variable in the last regulation set so maybe google “low rake Mercedes high rake Red Bull” and see what comes back\n\nCross weight = weight on opposite sides of the car (for example, front right and rear left) that affects how the car handles x also called “wedge.” I would also add to this ballast, which is a less specific term for when a car is under weight and the team can place the extra mass to get it up to minimum weight wherever it would like.\n\nCamber = looking at the tires from the front, camber is how much they are angled side to side. Lots of YouTube videos about how camber helps\n\nToe = looking at the tires from above, toe is how much the tire points in or out relative to the direction of travel. Probably YouTube videos about this, but also look up videos about “Mercedes DAS” to learn about a trick system they developed in 2020 to control toe\n\nAero = the various wings and sticky-uppy bits on the car. Wings create downforce, sticky-uppy bits usually control losses from air flowing over the car to reduce drag/make the car more slippery through the air\n\nSprings = coils that control how much the wheels travel up and down when going over bumps, making turns, etc.\n\nCompression and rebound = not super familiar but here’s a link - https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/s/zi8jyrJWnG\n\nI would add to this tire pressure, the design of the floor (even though this is that same as aero), and engine settings/mapping (turning performance of the power unit up and down)', 'And to add to this, adjusting just one of these options will affect all the other components as well.\n\nUsing the plank as an example; these things are calculated down to the mm obviously so say you want more camber for more lateral grip? Car will sit lower affecting the ride height, which will also depend on the fuel weight at X time. So you raise the car but now your driver is complaining about understeer.\n\nFine, we’ll just adjust the front wing, right? Now your fronts are overheating after the fast section.\n\nSo now you say, we’ll increase the tire pressure to compensate!

1p5ejcx,"The Evolution, Impact, and Legacy of Ground Effect in Formula One",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5ejcx/the_evolution_impact_and_legacy_of_ground_effect/,2025-11-24, Technical,"Ground effect stands for one of the most significant aerodynamic breakthroughs in the history of Formula One. Its emergence in the late 1970s, later ban in the early 1980s, and controlled reintroduction in the 2022 regulations collectively show the complex interplay between engineering innovation, competitive advantage, and regulatory oversight. This essay examines the historical development of ground effect, the technical principles behind its success, the challenges that led to its prohibition, and its influence on modern Formula One design.

Early Aerodynamic Approaches in Formula One and their Evolution led by Colin Chapman

During the 1950s and early 1960s, aerodynamic optimisation in Formula One was minimal. Cars were designed primarily for reduced drag, with narrow tyres, high ride heights, and front-mounted engines. While this configuration produced high straight-line speeds, it offered limited stability and poor cornering performance. As the decade progressed, technological shifts—such as wider tyres, rear-mounted engines, and lowered ride heights—enhanced mechanical grip and stability, but aerodynamic understanding remained rudimentary.
A change in design philosophy occurred in 1968 with the introduction of aerodynamic wings. These early devices were unstable and sometimes hazardous, yet they showed off the effect of downforce on cornering capability. By the 1970s, front and rear wings had become fundamental components of car design, although they were primarily “top-mounted” solutions that did not meaningfully exploit airflow beneath the car. Colin Chapman, founder of Lotus, played a pivotal role in the development of ground effect. By the mid-1970s, Lotus had fallen behind its rivals, prompting Chapman and his engineering team to explore more radical aerodynamic strategies. Inspired by the Venturi principles seen in aircraft design, they theorised that shaping the car’s underbody like an inverted aerofoil could drastically increase downforce. Wind-tunnel testing confirmed their theory. By integrating Venturi tunnels within the sidepods and sealing the airflow with sliding skirts, Lotus created a low-pressure zone beneath the car that effectively “sucked” it to the track without the drag penalty associated with large wings. This marked the birth of ground effect in Formula One.

The Emergence of a New Aerodynamic Era pioneered by Lotus

Introduced in 1977, the Lotus 78 became the first Formula One car engineered specifically around ground-effect principles. Its extended wheelbase and enlarged sidepods housed the Venturi structures responsible for the car’s unprecedented performance. Although the design suffered from uneven pressure distribution and mechanical reliability issues, it proved the enormous competitive potential of under-body aerodynamics which would be built upon in further seasons. 
The 1978 Lotus 79 was a more refined example of the ground-effect concept. Engineers extended the Venturi tunnels and redesigned the rear suspension to stabilise airflow across a wider range of conditions. The car achieved extraordinary dominance, securing six victories, near-total qualifying superiority, and the World Championship for Mario Andretti. The Lotus 79’s success compelled rival teams to develop their own ground-effect solutions, marking a rapid escalation in aerodynamic innovation.

Competing Interpretations and Engineering Experiments

Several teams tried alternative applications of ground-effect principles, with varying degrees of success. Among the most notable was the Brabham BT46B “fan car,” which used an engine-driven fan to extract air from beneath the chassis. This produced immense downforce irrespective of vehicle speed and resulted in a dominant victory in its sole race. Although technically legal, the car was withdrawn due to political pressure within the sport. Other experimental designs—including Arrows’ inclined-engine venturi system and Ligier’s high-downforce bodywork—showed promise but lacked the refinement necessary for consistent competitiveness. These efforts nevertheless highlighted the diversity of engineering approaches stimulated by the ground-effect revolution.

Porpoising and the Safety Crisis

Despite its performance advantages, ground effect introduced new safety concerns. To maintain an airtight under-floor seal, cars were fitted with extremely stiff suspension systems that severely compromised ride comfort and stability. This rigidity, combined with variations in airflow, led to “porpoising”—a violent vertical oscillation caused by cyclical loss and reattachment of downforce, an issue that also became clear during the 2022 Formula 1 season. By 1981, porpoising had become a major hazard, and regulatory interventions followed. Sliding skirts were banned on safety grounds, and minimum ride-height regulations were introduced. Teams initially circumvented these rules through hydropneumatic suspension systems, but the FIA ultimately mandated fully flat bottoms for the 1983 season, effectively ending the ground-effect era.

The Reintroduction of Ground Effect in 2022

Ground effect returned to Formula One in 2022 under a new regulatory framework designed to improve racing quality. Modern cars incorporate controlled Venturi tunnels but lack sliding skirts, making the aerodynamic load less extreme and more predictable. While these designs significantly reduce turbulent wake, they have also reintroduced porpoising to a lesser but still notable extent. Teams such as Mercedes experienced pronounced oscillations early in the season, highlighting the enduring complexities of managing under-floor aerodynamics.

Conclusion

Ground effect stands as a defining chapter in Formula One’s technological evolution. From its pioneering development by Lotus in the 1970s to its eventual ban and controlled revival decades later, it proves the tension between innovation and regulation in motorsport. Its legacy continues to shape modern car design, offering valuable lessons about aerodynamic optimisation, safety, and the pursuit of competitive advantage. As the 2022 regulations show, the foundational ideas of ground effect remain as relevant today as they were nearly half a century ago.

1p4t9cx,Lost in the fracas of last night is the continued suicidality of the FIA and F1 drivers with regards to their treatment of double waved yellows,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p4t9cx/lost_in_the_fracas_of_last_night_is_the_continued/,2025-11-23, Discussion,"Everyone is focused and angry at the race control for allowing marshals on track on lap 2, under non neutralised status. Which is fair and good! You should be mad at them for that, but lost in this is the continued non-treatment of double waved yellows.

  
Its fine and good to be mad at it for happening to begin with, but the truth of the matter is that race control is responsible for upwards of 7 KM of track and dozens of people, shit is going to happen from time to time. Corner marshals exist to be that last line of defence in situations like this, with their discretion to, at a moment's notice, wave double waved yellows to tell drivers to slow significantly and be prepared to stop. And it is EXTREMELY important to build respect for these, because even if race control is 99% effective, with over 100 sessions a year, that still means something is going to go wrong once or twice. And in those crucial moments, that's when you need to have respect for the corner marshals and their double waved yellows. Its ridiculous, and can easily get someone killed.

  
Now, how do you actually enforce it? To that, I say, I am a random online. Its really easy to recognise an issue, but harder to fix it. However, I must point out that F1 cars are very precisely tracked, with their inputs very precisely lined up to where they are. It shouldn't be too hard in 2025 with machine learning to figure out if a driver backed off by some % between the first marshal's post where they saw a double waved yellow, and the next marshal's post showing the track is clear. Its just utterly insane that double waved yellows almost mean nothing today.","['BTW it is very common for marshals to go on track in the early laps, without any flags, to clear debris. The entire field is bunched up at that point and poses no real risk given the time limit they are given to be on track, as well as radio communication of where the next car on track is.', 'Lack of enforcement of slowing for yellows and double waved yellows was a major contributor to Bianchis avoidable death. If it’s not enforced everyone will speed through because if you aren’t speeding through you are losing time to everyone else who is.\n\nWe’ve had a good few years of rules being heavily enforced which means cars have generally been slowing down to a safe speed. What we saw this weekend was ludicrous. In Q3 Hadjar not only went through a yellow without lifting in the slightest, but when he encountered a car in front who had lifted he had to step on the brakes so hard that he locked up, lost control and ran that car off the track.\n\nIt would have been a perfect opportunity for the stewards to make an example to ensure the rules are enforced, instead they chose to do nothing. That sends a message that it’s ok not to lift for yellow flags, and makes future near misses like this more likely.', 'Completely agree. Double yellow means ""Be ready to stop at any moment"", speed should be reduced A LOT. What we see is not nearly enough, but for the sake of making races ""smoother"" we let it go.\xa0', ""I had brought up that two drivers went off in Brazil in a zone under double waved yellows, and it didn't even get a mention on the broadcast, let alone an inquiry by the stewarts.\n\nThis year has been fraught with close calls of all kinds where track workers were put in dangerous situations.\n\nThe group of track workers (honestly they are all volunteers) at a high speed corner with the cars heading right at them last night was just the latest, and possibly most egregious of the year."", ""FIA don't care, and will continue to not care until someone is seriously injured or killed. The drivers aren't going to back off for yellows until they get penalised for failing to do so.\nThis isn't a new phenomenon nor limited to F1.\nIn order for FIA to do anything, they would have to acknowledge the risk, which I don't see them doing any time soon. The best way to convince the drivers would be to treat each marshalling sector with a double waved yellow as a slow zone with an appropriate penalty for exceeding the speed in that area (time penalty, reprimand or black/white flag)."", 'Drivers will always give up the least time possible, ie the amount the rules force them to. If they slow any more than that they give a competitive advantage to rivals who slow less than them. As it stands lifting to 95% throttle momentarily is deemed enough to ""acknowledge"" the flag and avoid a penalty. That needs to change.', 'I think FOM/FIA need to do an article on just how quickly an F1 driver reacts and how fast these cars can change line and also stop.  It is incredible.  And would stop a lot of these armchair analysis bashing the dumb volunteer monkeys who keep trying to kill themselves.  /rant.\n\nWe used to be able to go trackside, under double yellows (with or without the panels which are what trigger the tv warnings) and clear debris, under direction but this ability was taken away due to insurance and not trusting the dedicated, experienced marshals to do thier job.   There was respect from drivers and race control.', ""Lawson's incident is a perfect example of why that is unacceptable."", ""This isn't a new thing.\xa0\n\n\nHäkkinen was under investigation for not lifting during Monaco qualifying.\xa0\n\n\nHe was cleared, despite not lifting.

We’re seeing it right now as George has said multiple times he didn’t even know until recently he was technically still in the fight. 

Honestly, nobody seems to care about positions beyond first. But with how prestigious the Drivers’ Championship is, shouldn’t there be prizes for it too?
 
Sure, many drivers have performance bonuses in their contracts, but imagine if there was an actual cash prize for finishing in the top 10 or cash prize per race(my preference)! I’m sure the McLaren drivers wouldn’t easily agree to a position swap if there was money on the line.
 
It wouldn’t be anywhere near the scale of the Constructors’ prize.. Idk maybe something like the Grand Prix points system: $25m for first, $18m for second, and scaled down if it was done per race. Even a few hundred thousand for a strong finish would be massive for lower-paid drivers who’ve got podiums or top-5s this year (e.g. Hadjar, Bearman, etc.).

1p4rxel,I was curious so i did the maths and...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p4rxel/i_was_curious_so_i_did_the_maths_and/,2025-11-23, Discussion,"Okay so long story short, ever since Max came back into the mix I was ""envisioning"" a way where all 3 would be tied heading into Abu Dhabi, but I never tried to do the maths or anything, I was just thinking of it race by race, but now, with how Piastri and Max are tied, and there's just a sprint and GP in the way before the finale, I did it

Now obviously, there's a lot of ways to go with it, different combinations to try, but this is the one I ended up with (I'll just post the TL:DR end result version):

Sprint

Piastri P1

Norris P7

Max P8

GP

Max P1

Piastri P2

Norris DNF (or outside the top 10)

If this happens, they will all be tied on 392 points heading into Abu Dhabi

Highly improbable, I know, but anything can happen really, who thought Piastri would be tied with Max at this point, with the gap being as high as it was before...

And, honestly, I don't think the race result is that farfetched... I mean Max winning, sure, Piastri in 2nd, wouldn't be unlikely, and Norris crashing could very well happen

It's the sprint however, that needs some astronomical odds to turn out in this way... But we can only imagine...

And such a driving style, it's not just something you can change at 40, in a sport where mm and ms matter so much. Was he aware he wouldn't have been able to perform at his top? Did he not know they use different brakes in Ferrari? Was he overly optimistic in thinking he would adapt fast? Did he think (like Sainz thought, like we all thought) that Ferrari was going to be a title contender and the breaking issues would have been compensated by other strengths? Was it mostly a PR/money move, or the ability of saying ""I drove for Ferrari""?
