In Silverstone he only had the lead in the first place because Coulthard had brake problems, Schumacher had a driveshaft failure, and JV had a 35 second pitstop.

Hakkinen and Coulthard together also lost a 1-2 in Luxembourg with engine failures. Coulthard lost a probable race win in Canada with a clutch failure while leading. I also reversed the team orders in Jerez, giving the win to Coulthard.\n\nUndoing all the mechanical failures and returning the legitimate race order in Europe, Hakkinen would gain a net 37 points while Coulthard would gain a net 19 points. The revised championship standings would be 55 for Coulthard and 64 for Hakkinen. That‚Äôs of course just assuming the best case scenario for H√§kkinen in every race (for example it‚Äôs a huge extrapolation to say he would‚Äôve definitely won Austria). \n\nAt best you could say Hakkinen had a slight edge, definitely not a clear one. I would tend to agree with you, and say Coulthard had a slight edge.', 'I thought Hakkinen was better, but it‚Äôs definitely close either way. I listened to the podcast too and was surprised by their assessment. Anyone who thinks Hakkinen was significantly better is placing way too much emphasis on the second half of the season.\n\nWith Hakkinen there was obviously the Nurburgring. Austria is tough to give to Mika as you rightly point out, but given the circumstances of that day with the Stewarts holding up those behind for a good number of laps - unless he was two-stopping (which is highly doubtful) he would‚Äôve been in a very strong position indeed. People forget Hungary where he was ahead of both Williamses early on, again we don‚Äôt know the fuel loads but he certainly lost some points there. Monza is another forgotten race where he had a puncture. Before that, he made his stop two laps later than Coulthard but he was in his box for 1.4 seconds longer. Given he had also hit traffic before the stop, it‚Äôs possible Mika would‚Äôve been right in the fight for the win.\n\nObviously, Coulthard makes some of that back up with the Canadian GP win being taken away from him. He was also an innocent victim at the first corner in Argentina having qualified well ahead. There were just a good number of early races where Coulthard was better - Melbourne, Imola, Spain, Canada, was ahead in France when Mika retired. Mika improved exponentially from approx Silverstone onwards. His fanbase attributes this to him still recovering from his accident, which seems plausible to me.\n\nEdit: Should‚Äôve also added Coulthard‚Äôs lost points at the Nurburgring and possibly Jerez given that win may have been his if Mika had already gotten one. I had already factored these into my conclusion, just forgot to mention them.', 'Charles also prefers oversteer though, so Carlos should be used to coordinating with his teammate and adapting across driving styles.
