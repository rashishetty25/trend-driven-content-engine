1kwprc0,[AMuS] Will the front wing be a game changer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kwprc0/amus_will_the_front_wing_be_a_game_changer/,2025-05-27, News,,"['Lmao, the only part about the new front wing is only in the title. The article is 99.9% about Monaco', 'It will fuck Ferrari over the most, somehow', 'Ferrari turnaround in Barcelona \n\nTranslation: \n\n> **Ferrari was further up front in Monaco than they had expected. Now, the team at Maranello is hoping that the new front wing rule will bring about a change in Barcelona.**\n\n> McLaren team principal Andrea Stella already knew it on Friday before the first practice session in Monaco. ""Ferrari is a contender for victory here."" At that point, his Ferrari colleague Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur wouldn\'t have dared to make that statement. Especially not home driver Charles Leclerc: ""We thought Monte Carlo, with its slow corners, didn\'t suit us. Secretly, we hoped it would go like it did in 2021. We didn\'t have the best car then either, but we took pole position in Monte Carlo.""\n\n> After setting three fastest times in the free practice sessions, Ferrari\'s expectations increased. When Leclerc missed pole position by 0.111 seconds, Ferrari spoke of disappointment. ""When we came here, I thought a top-ten finish would be a challenge. Then we narrowly missed pole position and thus gave away the win. Compared to our original expectations, it was a good weekend. And yet, I\'m still annoyed not to have won.""\n\n> McLaren suddenly changed its tactics in Q3, setting two fast laps on its second attempt with a cool-down period in between. Ferrari opted not to, even though they\'ve recently performed better on used tires than on new ones.\n\n> Vasseur didn\'t see this as a decisive disadvantage in the battle for the fastest time: ""If you want to do something like that, you have to adjust your entire program from Friday onwards. We were considering the medium tire as an alternative. McLaren was simply very fast. They did 1:10.1 minutes on the first push lap. And that was with fuel for three laps on board.""\n\n> **Bumps and curbs help.**\nThe rule that the Ferrari SF-25 doesn\'t perform well in slow corners suddenly seemed to no longer apply. And Ferrari had nothing in its luggage other than a larger rear wing that would have explained the miraculous transformation.\n\n> Leclerc concluded: ""With one exception, Monte Carlo has only slow corners. This allowed us to focus entirely on that during the setup without having to accept many disadvantages in other areas.""\n\n> In fact, the Ferrari drivers only lost time between the Tabak curve and the Schwimmbad section. Last year\'s Monaco winner offered a second explanation: ""The track has a lot of bumps, and you have to go over the curbs a lot. Our car can handle that. Perhaps that compensated for our other weaknesses.""\n\n> **Other slow curves.**\nVasseur\'s statement on the supposed miracle was interesting: ""We don\'t fully understand it either. It could have something to do with the fact that the slow curves of Monte Carlo are different from the slow curves elsewhere. They are very slow.""\n\n> Even more crucially, due to the relatively low speed, Ferrari had little to worry about excessive wear on the crash barrier, allowing them to run at the ground clearance they considered ideal. ""We have less contact with the ground here. That also helps,"" admitted Vasseur.\n\n> The Frenchman admits that, despite the upturn in form in Monte Carlo, the team fell far short of expectations in the first third of the season. It looks as if Ferrari has fallen into the same trap it fell into in 2023. In an effort to address last year\'s weaknesses, the engineers overreacted and turned their old strengths into weaknesses. Now they\'re good in fast corners, but they gain less time there than in slow ones.\n\n> **McLaren with the ground clearance up.**\nMcLaren did better. The Papaya races lost their time in the slow sections in 2024. These are now the car\'s strengths, but without giving up much at the other end. While they\'re not as fast as Red Bull in the fast corners and not better than Ferrari, they\'re better overall. Stella offers a deeper insight: ""We can now run maximum downforce with a bit more ground clearance than last year."" With these cars, that translates to more mechanical grip.\n\n> The McLarens are generally better balanced than their rivals. The competition attributes this to the front wing, which flexes in such a way that the aero balance shifts from front to rear with increasing load. If stiffer front wings are now mandatory in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bMcLaren would lose the most, their rivals hope.\n\n> McLaren shrugs off the dreamers: ""We\'re not afraid of the new endurance tests. Nothing will change for us,"" promises Stella. His colleague Vasseur, on the other hand, believes: ""The new rule can be a game changer."" Vasseur\'s calculations are as follows: Ferrari was the most conservative in developing these flexible wings. Therefore, they also have the least to lose. Toto Wolff doesn\'t want to dismiss Vasseur\'s theory. ""Perhaps the Ferrari actually loses less than the other cars.""', ""Ok but what about an article about the Spain upgrade? Cause this article is *entirely* about Monaco. \n\nDon't bother clicking on it."", ""the change is from 15mm of flex to 10mm, and considering McLaren haven't bought any major updates yet, I imagine they're gonna bring big ones here to mitigate any problems the changes will cause, but I really don't think 5mm of difference will hurt McLaren at all"", 'No', 'Expect no change!', 'No', '[https://i.ibb.co/8D3ygPVG/me.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/8D3ygPVG/me.jpg)']",100,21,0.82,100,304,304,-3,0,0.0,-3

They uphold their impression of the smartest drivers pairing in my head."", 'I find this genuinely really interesting as it seems to be a complete blind spot for the sport/analysis. Have you had any look at all into where this time is lost? Is it how good drivers are at stopping on their marks etc?', ""Same reason I made it, always wondered if there was a difference there, I think after seeing Perez have faster stops consistently than Max, although I haven't actually looked at the '24 season yet, it will be interesting to see at some point if Perez was really good at his stops or if he was losing time in the pitlane to get those good stops.\n\nMade one for every weekend so far if you want to look bad, only Australia is a bit iffy because of the rain so it's not really representative you could argue."", ""Alonso has been pretty low all season long, Tsunoda especially has been lingering at the bottom and never even remotely close to a top 10 interestingly enough, until this weekend.\n\nIt's surprising to see Hadjar and Bearman up there consistently, so experience isn't really a factor either.\n\nNorris you could have argued benefits from the Mclaren box location, but Piastri does not necessarily appear to benefit from that so it's not that black and white either.\n\nWilliams is the outlier where both of them are really performing at the same level, and at the highest level, really showing to consistently be at the top winning 5 out of 8 weekends, really surprising.\n\nI was expecting perhaps a closer season with everyone just kinda being all over the place, but it's really showing some patterns with high and low performers."", ""My assumption is people just really hitting their marks with confidence, slowing down from pitlimiter speed 60-80km/h to zero in a short as run as possible, the entry and exit of the box are really the only place to significantly gain time consistently.\n\nCould help if the box is angled like they are for some teams, some more biased towards entry and others to exist.\n\nAnother aspect COULD be pit limiter speed, looking at the pit maximum speeds, not average speed as that's not available, so take that with a grain of salt, Bortoleto is 59.2km/h, as Monaco is 60km/h instead of 80km/h speed, but Nico is 59.7km/h max speed.\n\nI don't know the exact length of Monaco pitlane under limiter, but at 300 meters at 60km/h it's 18 seconds which seems close to the 21+ seconds they spend in the lane if you include the stop.\n\n300 meters at 59.2 is 18.243 and 300 meters at 59.7 is 18.090,  so it could be another tenth and a half, which will be a larger difference on most other tracks with a longer pitlane\n\nBut again this is the maximum speed listed and not the average speed so it's really just a guess at it.\n\nI don't have access to F1TV and such so maybe someone else can look at onboards and discover something."", ""Yes, it's incredibly fascinating, and I'm glad OP is tracking it.\n\nI can't remember which race anymore, but there was a race last season in which Lando was either comfortably in the lead or in P2 for a while.

1kxe5me,Grand Prix Plaza Las Vegas,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxe5me/grand_prix_plaza_las_vegas/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"Quick review of some components of the newly opened Grand Prix Plaza in Las Vegas, for those considering going.

Quickest background.  Netflix era F1 fan, watch every race, follow every social media account I can, etc.  I have a basic G29 steering wheel and pedal setup at home, and have played multiple seasons of all of the recent F1 games, although I have spent more time playing Gran Turismo 7 for the past two years.  Have never driven a proper racing sim setup with motion.

I arrived on a recent weekday morning around 1030am when the Plaza opened.  Talked to the Go Kart track employees for a few minutes about options for races, and decided to book a Mixed Race (~20mph or so) that is geared for all ages for $79.  Comes with two 15 minutes races, consisting of a qualifying session and then a grid start race.  Both sessions rankings are set by fastest lap only, to prevent the race session from being a block fest.  Blocking is easy to do as the track is pretty tight in most places, with a few decent opportunities to go 2 or maybe 3 wide and pass when needed.  Karts have functional DRS, which works by SLOWING the lead car, allowing the trailing car to pass.  Great concept in theory, but maddening when you're the lead car on a fast lap and you're artificially slowed down because someone is behind you.  Karts have functional ERS, which works great, is fun, but was not explained enough to the other drivers in my party who missed using it the entire first 15 minute session.  I used ERS to successfully get pole lap out of 10 drivers.   10 drivers on a grid made for 20 was pretty good, only a few bottlenecks during each session - the track workers are pretty good with telling people to move over, etc.   Overall, I enjoyed it for the price, my party members who are not F1 fans thought it was a blast, and I would do it again at the mixed race level or the nightly elite races which are 30 mph and I'm sure way more fun (I would have done the 30 mph race but did not have time in my schedule).

The arcade simulators was my most anticipated component of the event, as I'm an avid F1 game racer with a basic setup and hadn't ever used a Sim.  Cost is $40 for 9 time trial laps around the Vegas circuit.   The chair and wheel and pedal all seem to be pretty mid to high level in quality, but the game engine is a major fucking letdown.  All of the driver assists are on, and there is no way to turn them off.  The camera is halo, and can not be changed to cockpit for full immersion.  The game steers, brakes, and shifts for you around the circuit even if you try to override the shifts, or brake slightly earlier than the settings.  This setting is helpful for average tourists, but for anyone who has ever spent any time playing the F1 game or any other racing game, it is not worth the money.  If anyone from F1 or the GPP is reading this, theres got to be a way to change the settings for amateur or frequent players of racing games - your new F1 arcades across the world and this GPP will not bring in repeat customers otherwise.  As someone who loves F1 and racing games, I would not ever spend money on their Sim racing games again unless this was changed.  Just my $0.02.

There's a small store, restaurant, and museum on the second floor of the paddock.  I skipped the museum due to time, but walked into the empty restaurant at the northern end of the paddock  building at 11am just to see it and the menu.  Menu looked good and i would definitely try it once.  Restaurant decor was a bit sparse, but the views over T1 were very cool.  To get to the restaurant, you walk the entire length of the paddock and you can walk the exterior balcony and oversee the entire front stretch, which is very cool.  I had a drink at the bar near the store, which was high quality and around $21 (mid range price for Vegas cocktails).  Did not buy anything at the store, but they had a good selection and prices seemed cheaper than on race day (I'm not really a merch guy).

Overall, Go Karts were great, Sims were bad, restaurant incomplete but outlook positive, bar was good, atmosphere and access for a walk in patron were great.","['tbh sounds like a tourist trap and something to avoid as an F1 fan.\n\nKarting sounds very expensive and gimmicky and any local kart track would give a better experience.

The two don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.**\n\n> In the first few races of the year, the communication problems between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer, Riccardo Adami, could still be attributed to the duo needing to get used to each other. But after their eighth Grand Prix together, the two still don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.\n\n> Minor misunderstandings between drivers and engineers are nothing unusual in Formula 1. In the case of Hamilton and Adami, however, it\'s the tone that makes the difference. Normally, the partner at the pit stop should support the driver and provide clear instructions. At Ferrari, however, misunderstandings and questions arise again and again.\n\n> In the final part of the Monaco race, for example, Hamilton wanted to know if he was still a minute behind the leading four. The answer was no answer: ""Charles is on mediums, the McLarens are on hard tires. They\'re fighting very closely,"" Adami radioed to the driver.\n\n> **The sound makes the music.**\nHamilton reacted audibly annoyed to the useless information: ""You\'re not answering my question. Actually, it doesn\'t matter. I just asked if I was a minute behind."" Only then was Hamilton given the current gap, as requested.\n\n> After the race, a somewhat strange exchange also occurred. Hamilton radioed his engineer on the cool-down lap: ""It wasn\'t the easiest weekend. But we won\'t give up the fight."" He was met with silence, to which Hamilton followed up: ""Are you angry with me, or is something wrong?"" Again, there was no response.\n\n> During his press conference, team principal Frederic Vasseur once again had to answer questions about the somewhat confusing radio messages. The Frenchman attributed the communication problems to the special Monaco layout, where radio communication is only possible in certain sections of the track.\n\n> **Vasseur sees no tensions.**\nFurthermore, Hamilton\'s statements in the cockpit generally shouldn\'t be taken too seriously: ""There\'s no tension just because someone asks a question. He\'s under pressure, he\'s fighting, he\'s driving between the walls ‚Äì and he\'s doing that at 300 km/h. For me, that\'s all totally fine. I spoke to him after the race. He wasn\'t upset at all.""\n\n> But because this wasn\'t the first time Hamilton and Adami had talked past each other this season, frustration is growing among the record-breaking winner\'s fans. Their idol\'s poor results aren\'t helping to calm the situation, of course. The newcomer isn\'t looking for a chance against teammate Charles Leclerc.\n\n> Many fondly remember the times with Peter Bonnington at Mercedes. ""Bono"" and Hamilton formed a well-coordinated and close-knit team. While there were always a few questions about strategy, a certain respect was always expressed in their communication. The same couldn\'t always be said of Hamilton\'s radio messages in the first races of the year.\n\n> **Leclerc happy with new engineer.**\nEven his interactions with Sebastian Vettel and Carlos Sainz, whom Adami had previously coached at Ferrari, didn\'t always run smoothly. As a result, fans on social media are increasingly expressing their desire for Hamilton to be paired with a new man, preferably a British engineer, to avoid language barriers.\n\n> Ferrari demonstrated last year that it is willing to act in this position when necessary. Midway through the season, for the seventh race in Imola, Leclerc was given a new partner at the pit lane: Bryan Bozzi. The Italian replaced Spaniard Xavier Marcos. Since then, there have been clearer statements, something Leclerc repeatedly praises. Perhaps Ferrari should now try something new with Hamilton.', 'It‚Äôs a relationship I don‚Äôt foresee getting any better.

But it\'s like he\'s just a completely different driver. He doesn\'t push the car in qualifying at all and plays it incredibly safe; not to Lawson\'s level, but not much better. We get into a race, and he takes 0 chances at overtakes. He loses out on straights to Aston Martin and Haas in a car we at least know is faster than those two. Monaco wasn\'t his fault at all really within the race, it was just his Q2 times that needed to be better. Buta part from that, again I just feel I\'m watching a different driver. He\'s not even visibly trying to defend. The confidence in the car is NOT there, even though we\'ve seen moments where he HAS kept up, to some degree, with Max. FP in Monaco, Yuki and Max were pretty much matched on medium tyres.\n\nHe really feels like he\'s just cloned Checo from mid-late 2024.

But even if that turns out to be true by the time his career\'s over; it doesn\'t feel like we\'re seeing him drive how he has before at the moment. It\'s taking too long for him to get used to the car, and personally I\'m just hoping something clicks soon and he at least starts putting in some early-to-mid Checo era performances.

I'm a long time Formula 1 fan, however I've never been to a race in person.

I'm from Argentina and I know that Interlagos is a logistical nightmare to visit (both the circuit and Sao Pablo are famously uncomfortable places to visit).

Therefore, I was thinking in going to some Middle Eastern circuit. 
I know that the experience in person can vary significantly from watching the race on site from the TV. So, anyone has any recommendation on which of those gives you a more enjoyable experience?

Many thanks in advance.","['Bahrain is one of the best circuits on the Calendar in general and the best in Middle east.

Tickets are pretty cheap too. Qatar is weird, I\'ve certainly enjoyed going there and it\'s good from a food and ""cultural"". perspective but if you want something more touristy it\'s probably not for you. But for families it\'s great, especially around December. When the race was in October that year forget it though. The facilities have expanded quite a lot since the COVID race and it\'s more developed as an ""experience"". The downside is that tickets used to be super cheap and close but overall it\'s still not bad.\n\n\nBahrain is a little more awkward but not too much so, again there\'s shuttles from Manama Hotels to the track and although it can be a little awkward it\'s overall fine. The way the standards are set up it\'s a bit of a trek if you\'re not on the main straight and you have to go through a few extra security gates so if you want to ""pop down"" to the fan zone and you\'re not at the main GS it\'s a bit annoying.

If one place makes more sense logistically, go with that.\n\nIf you\'re talking about this year and just choosing between Qatar and Abu Dhabi, then, unless they do something weird at Qatar, I expect it to be one of the worst races of the year. It\'s very hard to pass there without weird things happening like the extremely hot race where tires died- but they moved it later last year so it wouldn\'t happen again. Even though I said that track quality doesn\'t matter nearly as much for in person, I\'d still pick Abu Dhabi of those two options. Abu Dhabi also has ""Ferrari World"" if you want to go there, though I\'m sure it\'s packed around the race.

1: Exact same cars for everyone. This way qualy would be more driver-oriented than it already is.

2: F3 cars. Small cars, more overtaking opportunities. No battery bullshit. Lightweight cars.

3: NO pit stops. They tried to fix it adding a pitstop. Well, lets turn it up a notch. No pitstop means no dirty play like williams, more skill involved for managing tires, no undercut/overcut opportunities meaning drivers have to overtake on pure pace. AND every overtake is done while racing. Puncture? you are out of the race. Rain? make your tire decision before the race starts.

4. Spread the points between qualy and race. Qualy in monaco is the most entertaining of the calendar, so why not reward it! Something like sprint race points on qualy (until 8th position) and half the points on race. Also these points should NOT count for the constructors championship.
