Hulkenberg completely lost the rear on seemingly normal acceleration on the exit of T3/4, having to save multiple severe oversteer moments that put him into the gravel, damaging his floor and effectively ending his race. Later on in the lap, Bortoleto was in a battle with Bearman, and turned in relatively normally into T8 and instantly lost the rear in a basically unsavable moment that put him into the gravel, taking him out of race contention as well.

Both of these moments can be viewed here:¬†[https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z\_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68](https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68)

If one of these drivers had experienced this alone, it would be easy to put it down to driver error. However, the appearance of a similar issue on both cars in the first lap in seemingly innocuous moments when the drivers weren't even trying to make a move, leads me to believe that there was potentially some sort of issue on the car, or more specifically, the tyre preparation plan that the team had in place during the formation lap (ie number of burnouts, target tyre temp).

I have read that Tsunodas driving style is sharp and quick preferring a pointy front end and loose rear. he is also very late and aggressive on breaking. The main difference is being that he lacks the smoothness and a robotic precision that Verstappen has but he has good reflexes. 

From what Ive seen, it seems like Yuki‚Äôs driving style is a more ""staccato"" version of of Verstappen. With that being said is Yuki not more well placed to develop into a better teammate? 

Because at least he follows the same philosophy, whereas other teammates would have had to change their whole way of thinking about a corner to adapt Tsunoda seemingly needs to """"just"""" smooth everything out. What were the driving styles of Verstappens failed teammates

There's a great interview with Albon about how the issue progresses. You set up your car less extreme than Max and you're slower a bit but then you want to compete with him, you push too hard and then you make mistakes and you lose confidence in the car and that's it for you\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ddEW\\_jHupA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ddEW_jHupA)"", 'A F1 car is designed to go as fast as they can design in around a track, without a driver in mind. \nThis car is ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù to the racing team that is going to set it up from circuit to circuit with automated and driver in the loop sims to find the fastest. Just at the last moment, a drivers preference is dailed in on track. \n\nThe difference between the tier of drivers get bigger when that car that is designed and setup by those 1000 people, has a small window of performance or is somewhat unpredictable. \n\nThis means that the RedBull car just isn‚Äôt a well balanced predictable car where anyone that‚Äôs not Verstappen, Hamilton or other top tier drivers can get that performance out. \n\nBut. The other way round, a driver maybe need a car to behave a certain way to get get his ‚Äúmojo‚Äù. And if that‚Äôs not there, well, most of the times it‚Äôs just.. that‚Äôs a lost season or lost career.', ""I think the whole driving style conversation is a bit played out. For example (looking at your last sentence), in one of the interviews where Albon talked about the pointiness of the Red Bull car, he mentioned that he prefers more oversteer even when compared to drivers like Leclerc. Does this mean Charles would perform worse alongside Max than Alex did? I seriously doubt it. \n\nIt likely just comes down to the Red Bull being unpredictable due to design flaws. That makes it difficult to wrangle into some good pace. Max has reported the car oversteers and understeers basically from corner to corner. Max has enough ability to catch these changes and adjust on the fly, maintaining a decent pace.

Some big names with great primes that come to mind for me are Ricciardo and Massa. Granted, I haven't been watching as far back as their primes so I wouldn't know, but it truly feels like we have another uncrowned Champion in the making. 

Charles might have had mistakes earlier in his career but it really feels like he ironed them out last season and performs every race week. It's only early in his career but its possible we'll never see him lift the WDC Trophy despite being apparently more deserving than other names like Russel, Norris, or Piastri.

1jkoyvo,"OPINION: The Red Bull RB21 Is Not a Bad Car, but a Top Car Struggling with Incapable Drivers",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jkoyvo/opinion_the_red_bull_rb21_is_not_a_bad_car_but_a/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"Recently, given Checo performances and the surprising Lawson results, I have seen a lot (like, A LOT) of comments on social networks and here, with the idea that the RBR RB21 is just ""a shit car"", that needs fixing or that Max is ""overdriving it"" so he, overachieving, just helped to hide the car problems.

IMO, this is just a not right conclusion or even realistic. Why?

* No driver can ""overdrive"" a car, only try to extract up to 100% of its possible performance. That's just as easy as that. When Max puts the car P2 in Australia, it's because the car allows for it and can be as fast as that or even more (who knows the ""physical limit"" in perfect conditions over a race length).
* Teams, in theory, prioritise their car design to be the fastest possible (yeah, shocking). Then, they try to make them more driveable or of their driver(s) liking, and start to get driver output to either help him extract more % of the available theorical performance, or find more speed. Sometimes, they have to concede and accept theorical slower setups/designs because the driver can work faster with it (better to ""extract"" 90% of performance of a top-2 car, than 60% performance of a top-1 car - just like when Checo asked to drive a older spec to be faster).
* The car has been able to end P2 in Australia (+0.895s), qualy P4 in China, P3 in Sprint, and end up P4 in the race.
* Meanwhile, Lawson ended up DNF, P20, P14 and P12.

What's clear, is that the 2¬∫ seat problem, isn't a car problem, but a driver skill issue. Yes, maybe Red Bull pressured a lot their drivers and 2 races are not the best number of sessions to value a development, but still, is not the car problem.

It's about how much % of performance available can the driver use and profit from.

And yeah, the car can be difficult to drive, but then, again, is a driver issue. If the driver can't extract at their current design the full potential of the car, and they need to change it, then it's on them to adapt the car to their driver capabilities and likings because the driver needs it, is not about the car being bad from the start.

Also, IMO, we can't be sure about ""how bad"" the situation is. The pool of drivers with experience in this iteration of RBR cars, in the current regs, is literally just composed of Checo and Lawson for 2 races (not accounting for the private 1-day practice sessions RBR hold with other drivers, of course). People overreacting like ""wow, nobody can do it, only Max, this is crazy"" are just blowing this problem out of proportions.

Not to speak about how Checo had brilliant times in his peak at RBR (considering he's not a ""once in a generation"" driver in the slightest), the nosedive came mainly after some iterations and changes to the development path of the car, making him to lose the touch of the car.

So, IDK what do you think, but I feel a big chunk of fans are just overblowing all this and coming to conclusions that are just not true or even nonsense.

Also, I hope Tsunoda can do a good job all things considered (lack of ""normal"" preparations, huge pressure, all eyes on him, yadda yadda yadda), but if he fails, people are going to be full crazy about this I feel lol.","[""If a car can only deliver in the hands of a Verstappen/Hamilton/Schumacher tier talent, then that car is a liability.

It's already cost RBR a constructor's championship last year - if Max leaves, they are in serious trouble."", 'that\'s a lot of text to pretty much say ""i think the last 2nd rb drivers were bad"" based on no evidence other than vibes.
