Hope you like it","[""I like your work, but I wanted to explain ideal laps for people who do not know. What an ideal lap time is is sticking all of their best sectors together across all their laps in a session.\n\nHowever, it very often isn't physically possible to do all these sectors at the same time. A large reason that's easy to understand is ERS (energy reserve system) deployment. They get a boost in speed when they want. In one lap in a session, they might have used the ERS on sector one and had their fastest sector one then. On another lap, they might have deployed more of it in sector two, on another lap in sector 3. The sectors through a total lap are also affected by tire management through the lap, or how a corner is taken. Practice is for trying out a lot of different things. Someone might take the last corner of a sector in a way that's fast for the first sector but slower for the next sector on one lap, and on another lap, they might try it the other way, which gets a better second sector time."", 'Keep in mind for a quali run you‚Äôre probably overcooking your tires if you push too hard throughout all sectors.

Please do it again :)', 'Very interesting! Might be a dumb question, but how is the Ideal Lap calculated?', 'The top five are ridiculously close, with less than a tenth between them.', 'So, I assume less disparity between ideal and best lap is better?', 'Looking at ideal laps is always an interesting thought exercise and I like this graphic. \n\nHowever, I don‚Äôt usually put a lot of stock in ideal laps. Pushing hard for a purple Sector can easily result in overcooked tires by the time you get to Sector 3. This weekend in particular, teams are having trouble (as of FP1) figuring out how to get the most of the new C6 over the full duration of a lap, so we‚Äôre seeing a lot drivers set purples in one sector with yellows in the next sector.

Ferrari is Ferrari, and Red Bull is a one-man team.', 'Translation:\n\n> **McLaren proved to be vastly superior on the first day of practice at Imola. Over one lap and over the entire race. The only question now is: Who will finish second? Ferrari has the best chances in the long run, but they\'re one lap behind.**\n\n> After McLaren\'s one-two victory at the Miami GP, everyone was wondering: Could it be even more dominant? It could be, if the first day of practice in Imola were to be the benchmark for the rest of the weekend. This time, the McLarens had the better of the competition, even on one lap, with a lead of almost three-tenths. In the long run, that\'s for sure. There\'s a world of difference between McLaren and the rest.\n\n> The race for victory will be between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Piastri beat his teammate by 0.025 seconds on one lap. In the race simulation, Norris had the edge by 0.045 seconds. However, Piastri completed two more laps on the medium tires. The close race between the Papaya Boys could be quite exciting for spectators. Perhaps less so for the McLaren command bridge. Will the first clash, which McLaren boss Zak Brown says is inevitable, take place in Imola?\n\n> Things remain exciting behind McLaren as well. On one lap, Mercedes has a minimal lead over Red Bull and Ferrari. Things are different in the long runs, where Ferrari excelled. Charles Leclerc\'s lap times averaged just two-tenths of a second better than McLaren\'s. ""But that only helps us if we\'re ahead of our opponents on the starting grid,"" team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur told his team. Imola is a track with a built-in overtaking ban.\n\n> In the midfield, Alpine shone on one lap with the new C6 tire. Williams was stronger on the medium C5 compound. As a whole, you have to trust Williams more. Carlos Sainz\'s long run was over half a second faster per lap than Pierre Gasly\'s.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n\n> **1) Is McLaren unbeatable again?**\nThe first practice session ended with a one-two finish for McLaren. Oscar Piastri finished ahead of Lando Norris. But the lead over third-placed Carlos Sainz was razor-thin at 52 thousandths of a second. All were on the new C6 compound. The second practice session, on the medium tires, presented a similar picture: Norris ahead of Sainz, separated by only 0.040 seconds. There was still hope that McLaren would at least have to fight for pole position.\n\n> But on the soft tires, McLaren then unleashed a blast. Piastri and Norris were within just 0.025 seconds of each other. Everyone else, including Pierre Gasly at the front, was almost three-tenths behind. With a time difference of 1.127 seconds for the entire field, that\'s a class difference. Things got even worse for the rivals in the long runs. Only Ferrari was able to keep up. All the other drivers were on average half a second slower per lap. While the McLarens maintained their lap times consistently, their rivals\' times improved after five laps.\n\n> **2) Has Red Bull solved its problems?**\n\nYes and no. Even the Imola upgrade only partially cured the RB21\'s weaknesses. Max Verstappen initially reported understeer at the apex and oversteer on corner exit. But by the second practice session, the understeer had disappeared. ""Nevertheless, we lost four-tenths to the McLarens. That\'s too much. And in the race, the McLarens seem to be in a class of their own again,"" lamented Sporting Director Helmut Marko. Compared to the other teams, the assessment is cautious. ""We ran our normal program, but we have the feeling that some of them were perhaps a bit lighter.""\n\n> The latest development stage hasn\'t entirely failed to achieve its intended effect, but it hasn\'t brought Red Bull significantly closer to McLaren or away from its fellow sufferers Mercedes and Ferrari. Furthermore, the car bounces over bumps and curbs‚Äîa long-standing problem that has plagued Red Bull for two years now. Yuki Tsunoda\'s eighth-place finish was surprising, but even more so was the small time difference of 0.092 seconds. ""No one has been this close to Max in a long time. Yuki doesn\'t mind the oversteer as much. He complains less,"" Marko noted. The small time difference could also tell a different story, however. Namely, that Verstappen wasn\'t yet at his best. The world champion usually strikes when things get serious.\n\n(1/2)', '""Most competitive season yet""', '***Reaaaalllly*** interesting and helpful article.

So someone at the FIA does know the exact shape/materials of the McLaren brake ducts, but they may not have been able to figure out why that shape works so well.', 'To the media they can lie as they want.\n\nTo the FIA, not really.

1kopmfl,Problem with f1 atm,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kopmfl/problem_with_f1_atm/,2025-05-17, Technical,"In my opinion this is the problem with F1 at the moment. My gf asked me:‚Äùwhy did they changes the rules with the dimensions they are racing now?‚Äù.

I had no answer üòÇ. It is completely nonsense if you look back to it.","['I mean the first half of 2022 was imo the best racing we have ever had in F1.\n\n[Edit] ok some people are wondering why I think this, here‚Äôs my explanation.\n\nPeople often glorify pre DRS F1, and while it was often great, and had more jeopardy, there were significantly less overtakes and battles. The jeopardy made up for that but in terms of Racimg it wasn‚Äôt that great.\xa0\n\nBut people have only seen highlights of the classic races, not the boring ones. I hate the way people call the likes of the 2005 season a classic because they‚Äôve only watched Imola and Japan. Overall that season was usually pretty boring races.\n\nWhen we introduced DRS F1 did get better. Out standards have now gone up. But in 2011 and 2012 DRS was a bit too strong.\xa0\n\nBut in early 2022 F1 entered the best balance it has ever had and this resulted in imo the best Racimg we have ever had.\n\nWhen they got rid of porpoising in Belgium 2022 they also got rid of some of the cars ability to follow closely. Also in Hungary 2022 Aston Martin brought an update that increased the amount of dirty air coming out of the back of their car. This made them hard to overtake and everyone else copied them.\xa0\n\nHad the cars stayed like they were in the first half of 2022 this would have been the best regulations of all time.\xa0\n\nSeriously. Im not even just talkimg about Leclerc vs Max in Bahrain and Saudi. Im talking about having about three times the amount of overtakes there usually are in Australia.\xa0\n\nAnd Spain, even with the last chicane still there, had a great race with all the leaders having various plights and Russell and Verstappen having an amazing battle.\xa0\nIn Silverstone we had the best multi car wheel to wheel battle we‚Äôve seen in the last decade that was with the top cars.\xa0\nIn Austria there were battles everywhere and a five way battle at one point in the midfield where in about half a lap they all swapped around.\xa0\n\nEven France gave us \xa0loads of action and battles.\n\nAnd Hungary was the peak of it. Everyone made their strategy assuming overtaking would be difficult at what is historically the second or third worst track for passing. But there was overtakes galore especially at the head of the field.\xa0\n\nOn top of this tyres were wearing much faster than everyone expected. Bahrain, Spain and Austia were three stoppers!\xa0\nMost races were two stoppers and only about a third of them were one stop races. And the cars all had such different designs and even their paint jobs were more colourful.\xa0\n\nAlso reliability was a big factor with only Mercedes amd their customer teams having a consistently reliable car. This made for mixed up and entertaining races.\n\nBtw Im not saying in the first half it was the best season ever. But in terms of racing I think it‚Äôs the best F1 has ever been.\xa0', 'Casual F1 fans mentality: car small race good.', ""Larger cars allow for more aerodynamic options. It's just faster.\n\n\nIn like 2018 the FIA loosened some of the size limitations on the cars, and the first thing many teams did was made the cars longer."", 'TBH the 2008 front wing is better looking than the 2022 front wing, IMO.', ""Increasing the width of the cars was a rule thing, largely restoring what had been used previously in the 80s and 90s, but the length was just driven by engineering wanting more aero surface area. Recently there's been rules to limit the length of the cars."", ""function dictates the form. Technology evolves, understanding of aerodynamics evolves, the sport's objective evolves and all the while trying to be at the forefront of engineering breakthroughs and still be the fastest single seater motorpsort.\n\nYou must also appreciate that you need willing participants as well and there are only so many organisation in the world capable of competing. \n\nThe constant complaints about size and weight have been noted, so too have the complaints about turbulent air and there have been attempts to address these. Ultimately you can never please everyone and there's always compromises."", 'Oh sure let‚Äôs blame ass to mouth.', 'Closer racing', 'There is logic to it. To put it very simply, much of the focus in the last 10 years was\n\n1) Cost control. In the 2010s, F1 was becoming far too expensive to race with many teams facing financial difficulties. The 2008 crisis meant that fewer manufacturers and private teams were willing to commit that much money to the sport. Big aspects of cost control is more standardization and far more reliability. (reducing the number of engines per year)\n\n2) Safety. Removing refueling, adding safety features to protect drivers etc. This added to the weight of the car without improving driving performance. \n\n3) Road relevance. To keep mfrs interested in the 2010s, F1 had to modify the rules. Adding hybrid and kinetic energy recovery and batteries to F1. They also reduced max engine RPM from >20,000 to 18,000 (?) to increase reliability. This further increased weight to power ratios.\n\nThe problem here is that with additional weight (about 200kg more), it became very hard to go fast. So they had to increase aerodynamics (bigger wings, barge boards) - this meant longer wheelbase cars to accommodate this. It culminates in today\'s ground effects (which generates more downforce for a given area).\n\nBroadly this was very successful - cars are faster and still cheap enough to keep teams interested. F1 has become financially viable post 2020. \n\nUnfortunately nearly 900kg of very large cars with aero (which disturbs airflow for cars behind) have become (a) very hard to pass (b) reached the limit of older, narrower race tracks. This has been a major source of complaint over the last 10 years. No F1 track is owned or run by the FIA. So tracks have to pay for their upgrades themselves (too expensive for just 1 race a year). And some tracks just cannot be widened (Monaco). \n\nHence the new rules. Smaller and lighter (slightly) cars from 2026. More finessing of aero and they\'re thinking of further limiting the number of engines used per year. Also sustainability is now a ""thing"" in F1 with mandated use of sustainable fuels and switch to more electric power. \n\nCould they make F1 faster? Yes, allow smaller, lighter vehicles, with twin turbo V8 or V10 screaming at 25,000 RPM. But it would become very very expensive. Engines would last maybe only 1 or 2 races.']",0,26,0.46,0,23,23,0,26,0.46,0
