1p6yhpg,Who wins Qatar 2025? A summary of some predictors,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6yhpg/who_wins_qatar_2025_a_summary_of_some_predictors/,2025-11-26, Discussion,"With the double DSQ and Verstappen win at Vegas, the last two race weekends of the season have become massively important—and with Qatar being a sprint weekend it seems it will be the most decisive of all. As a track:

* Qatar is high-speed with long, flowing corners, little demand for low-speed traction, and high sensitivity to brake balance and platform stability. Only one corner averages less than 100 km/h, with most well above 200 km/h.
* Overtaking is hard but not impossible with a big opportunity into T1 with DRS.
* Tire degradation is extremely high and tire deltas are essential to pass. Historically, it’s been a 2-stop race but this year Pirelli has gone further, mandating a 25-lap limit on each compound in the 57-lap race.
* Qualifying is key: in the 3 Qatar Grands Prix, whoever leads the race after T1 has won every time (twice pole sitters and Verstappen in 2024 starting P2).

2025 circuits similar to Qatar:

* Suzuka: Verstappen on pole, eking out a race win with Norris P2, Piastri P3
* Jeddah: Verstappen again on pole with Piastri +0.010. Piastri pressured Max into a lap-1 error and won with Max P2 +2.8s. Having crashed out in Q3, Lando recovered to P4.
* Spain: Piastri on pole with Lando +0.209 and Max +0.302. Piastri wins with Norris P2 +2.5s, while Max falls from P3 to P10 after a pitlane error (and more lol).
* Silverstone: Max takes pole gambling on low downforce with Piastri +0.103 and Lando +0.118. Race day is wet and he drops to P5. Leading, Piastri suffers a 10s penalty for unsafe braking and Lando claims P1.

**Max: 3 poles, 1 win. Oscar: 1 pole, 2 wins. Lando: 0 poles, 1 win (not on pace).**

History at Qatar (quickest on pace in bold)

* 2023 Sprint: **Piastri on pole** & Norris P2 in sprint shootout. **Piastri P1**, Max P2, Lando P3.
* 2023 Grand Prix: **Max on pole**\--Piastri P6, Norris P10 due to track limits, despite having the pace for P3+P2 respectively in Q2. Merc-on-Merc violence plus great race pace led them to the podium within 6s of **Max in P1**. (P4 was +34s.)
* 2024 Sprint: **Lando on pole**, Oscar P3 at +0.159s, Max P6 at +0.303. Lando led comfortably while Oscar in P2 needed DRS to hold off George, and the two swapped at the final corner. Oscar P1, **Lando P2,** Max P8.
* 2024 Grand Prix: **Max on pole**, Lando P3 at +0.252, Oscar P4 at +0.309. Lando in P2 drops to P15 due to a penalty and recovers to P10. **Max P1**, Leclerc P2, Piastri P3.

Impact of Pirelli’s 25-lap rule

* This surely helps Red Bull. With McLaren’s infamous tire wear advantage, this caps their ability to extend leads with low deg. over long stints or flip track position with it. Max is also right in his wheelhouse being able to attack flat-out when strategies are predictable.
* In McLaren’s favor, however, predictable strategies at this point in 2025 is perhaps a positive for Lando, who needs to avoid unexpected disaster more than he needs to dominate. And their tire advantage will still play a role over shorter stints.

Many are forecasting this race as a Piastri track on paper and a sure McLaren oasis among a bumpy last-half stint. I’m not sure how clear that really is. Thinking of Piastri’s performance at similar tracks earlier this year, it seems this ought to be a Piastri weekend. But those performances came long ago and before his dramatic fall from pace. His performances at Qatar also don’t even come out much better than Lando, and at Qatar in 2024 he complained of low grip, something he and Stella have made clear has been problematic this season.

For Lando on the other hand, who’s in the midst of a meteoric resurgence, he struggled at comparable tracks in 2025, and at Qatar has struggled with track limits, even compared to a grid full of drivers who have had brushes with it. And with McLaren’s DSQs in Vegas which they blamed on lack of data—and only one practice in Qatar—I can see them playing it safe with ride height and losing some performance.

Red Bull aren’t out in the clear with how unpredictable their performance has been, even at tracks historically dominated by them like Mexico. Max is very strong at Qatar (which seems a bit lost in the conversation so far), but he's struggled in the sprints. And he needs much more than a great showing, including help from Mercedes and Ferrari which this season is a crapshoot.

I lean Max but I don’t have a solid prediction. Just giving out info I looked up for myself. But to have a penultimate race weekend this important and this unpredictable is utterly fascinating.","[""This is so detailed! I loved reading through. I'll say it will be another Max win with Norris P2.

Do laps under a safety car count? Could we potentially have 7 laps of safety car that brings it back to a 1 stop race for teams that gamble for such a scenario?', ""Lando just has to stay close to Max and Oscar. That's all.

Only thing is atp Oscar has nothing to lose so he will full send it at any opportunity even if the risk is higher than normal.

1p6jhj2,Bearman's Performance where HTB is Allowed/Banned: A logistic regression model,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6jhj2/bearmans_performance_where_htb_is_allowedbanned_a/,2025-11-25, Statistics,"Welcome to unserious stats with me, Woakula! With 2 days before Thanksgiving, I’m alone in the office and have just enough time to entertain myself with mindless nonsense before I go to lunch. Anyways I was intrigued by the table about Bearman’s performance where Hormone Treated Beef (HTB) is/is not restricted originally created by u/_StarDust_0. I figured it’d be fun to run it through a logistical analysis to see if we can find anything interesting.

First off, I suppose I need to answer what is logistical analysis? Well, logistic regression/analysis is a method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a binary outcome. It predicts the probability of an outcome occurring which is represented as a 0/1 or a no/yes in this the case a top 10 finish.

Here is the data courtesy of u/_StarDust_0, if you find errors here take it up with them, I just copied it without verifying the accuracy, as any good data scientist should.

https://preview.redd.it/9l15n3ffxf3g1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9512a9aadbff9f8621856a5cd0629d245488f7e

  
Here are our variables:

1.      Outcome variable is the race result (which I divided into top 10 finishes (0/1 or no/yes))

2.      Independent variable is the approved status of Hormone Treated Beef (0/1 or banned/allowed)

**Our question is: Does the approval status of Hormone Treated Beef increase the probability of Bearman finishing top 10?**

My 5 lines of code in R:

>`model <- glm(race_top10 ~ HTB_numeric,`

>`data = f1_bearman,`

>`family = binomial(link = ""logit""))`

>`exp(coef(model))`

>`summary(model)`

The line starting with model is our logistic regression model

Exp(cof(model)) converts the logistic odds-coefficient created in the previous step into an odds ratio which is more interpretable.

Summary(model) is our output.

https://preview.redd.it/h9pgwp5oxf3g1.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=381e00544bc049cdd2588935852879333df1e57c

**Interpretation:**

Let’s take a look at our exp(coef(model)) line:

The intercept is 0.20. this is the odds of a top 10 finish when HTB is banned. We do need to convert this odds to a probability:

Probability = odds / (1+odds)

Probability = 0.2/(1+0.2) = 0.167 or 16.7%

So when HTB is banned, there is a 16.7% chance of Bearman finishing the race in a top 10 position.

HOWEVER, when HTB if allowed the odds are multiplied by 11.667

New odds = 0.2 x 11.667 = 2.33

Converting to probability: 2.33/(1+2.33) = .70 or 70%

Therefore, When HTB is allowed Bearman has a 70% chance of scoring a top 10 finish. A whopping 53.3% increase compared to regions where HTB is banned. Get our boy some HTB!

**What does the summary(model) line tell us?**

Well our coefficient of 2.4567 tells us that we have a positive direction (when HTB is allowed the log-odds increase) we converted these log odds to probability in the previous step.

The p value (Pr(>|z|)) tells us if the relationship is statistically significant. In this case we have a p-value of 0.0179. This tells us there is a 1.79% probability of observing a relationship this strong (or stronger) between HTB approval status and a top 10 race finish for Beaman. This means the relationship is unlikely to be due to random chance alone (technically lol) We have ""evidence"" that HTB is a genuine predictor of a top 10 race finish.

**But what about the confidence interval?** 

Let's run a 6th line of code:

`exp(confint(model))`

this line calculates the confidence interval for our odds ratio which was calculated in step 2.

Look at the HTB\_numeric line, the lower and upper bounds are massive. Way too big to actually be useful in the real world, but for the laughs let's convert them to a probability anyways

Probability lower bound: 1.77/(1+1.77) = .6389 or 63.89%

Probability upper bound: 115.82/(1+115.82) = .9914 or 99.14%

So we are 95% confident that the true probability of HTB affecting a top 10 finish from Bearman lies somewhere between 63.89% and 99.14%. With such a large window there is a lot of uncertainty in our model. 

Let’s conveniently forget that for this to be real we need to come up with a plausible reason this relationship exists. I hypothesize that HTB is actually a performance enhancing substance that only affects our GOAT Ollie Bearman. When he races in countries where HTB is allowed he eats a big steak allowing him to digest all the drugs (cause that’s how this works in my universe). He shows up on race day and bam! An increased chance at a top 10 finish! Why isn’t his team bringing HTB with them everywhere for the performance gainz? Well idk, maybe a freezer it too expensive…..

So as I walk out the door in search of a sandwich shop which will sell me performance enhancing HTB I leave you with one final question? What wacky casual effect mechanism do you think connects HTB to Bearman's top 10 performance?","['HTB being banned (and TiO2) correlates with Europe correlates with F2 tracks correlates with ""this driver\'s most recent experience with this track was the notoriously unpredictable & difficult to drive 2024 Prema""', 'This is what I pay Internet for.\nI sucked at statistics in college, but by understanding the basics, the post gets more hilarious with each conclusion.', 'A significant finding by logistic regression is kind of impressive lol (almost more so than the fact that you, a self-proclaimed statistician, did this work for free..). I am no data scientist but isn’t it kind of supposed to account for confounding variables?\xa0\n\n\nBut for real, all this means to me is that Ollie has a genuine issue with racing in Europe and should probably figure out why.\xa0', 'Reddit and running jokes into the ground, a love story', 'The wacky casual variable is that the trenbolone in the beef is a PED.\n\nThere is absolutely no good explanation (ignore europe)', 'Why use something binary like points/no points when you can build a model based on something cardinal like gap to leader?', 'HTB = Hormone Treated Bear.', ""I would urge caution with these results.\n\nFirstly, at 22 datapoints, the sample size is too small to draw any meaningful conclusions. If the model had used Alonso or Hamilton's data, it might have been a closer to having enough statistical power.\n\nSecondly, the model specification does not explictly account for Bearman starting in the top ten, despite the fact the data is there. One might argue that if any driver starts in the top ten, they are more *likely* to finish in the top ten. Thus, maybe interaction terms with qualy result, or with qualy\\_top10, could have been included, or even used as a random effect.\n\nThirdly, the model assumes that all tracks are equal. Track should have been included as a random effect to account for this.\n\nFourth, the model does not account for Bearman's exposure to being an F1 driver, and the car:  the model assumes he is no better at driving at race 22 as he was at race 1 (despite having done thsounds of km's in the car between the two datapoints).\n\nOf course, adding random effects and interaction terms probably wouldn't have producd any significance at all, due to the small sample size."", 'Finally a solid statistical analysis!', 'Fantastic analysis. Here is an abstract for when you want to publish:\n\nAbstract\n\nThis analysis applies logistic regression to evaluate whether the regulatory status of Hormone-Treated Beef (HTB) in a host country is associated with Ollie Bearman’s likelihood of achieving a top-10 race finish. Using binary indicators for both HTB approval and race outcome, the model estimates a 16.7% probability of a top-10 finish when HTB is banned and a 70% probability when HTB is allowed, corresponding to an 11.67-fold increase in odds. The HTB coefficient is statistically significant (p = 0.0179), indicating that the observed association is unlikely to be due to random variation alone. However, the wide 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio (1.77–115.82) reflects substantial uncertainty and limits the precision of the estimated effect. The findings illustrate a strong statistical association between HTB approval status and performance outcomes, though further investigation would be required to establish any underlying causal mechanism.']",133,20,0.83,133,236,236,5,0,0.0,5

1p6gw61,Could this year's title battle be compared to the 1986 season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6gw61/could_this_years_title_battle_be_compared_to_the/,2025-11-25, Discussion,"Of course, the early and mid-season phases were different between '86 and '25. In '86, it was a four-way fight between Alain, Nigel, Nelson and Ayrton, while in '25 it was seen more as an internal battle between the McLaren duo—almost like another Silver War.

However, with two Grands Prix left, I’ve found the two seasons to be quite similar.

In the ’86, Nigel led with 70 points, followed by Nelson on 60 and Alain on 59. Right now, Lando has 390 points, with Oscar and Max both on 366. Considering the points systems of each era, the trends look quite similar.

In the ’86, the title fight was between the two Williams drivers, who were competing with the constructors’ championship-winning team, and Alain, the defending champion driving a McLaren that was regarded as relatively uncompetitive. This year shows a similar pattern as well, with McLaren’s two drivers battling against the defending champion, Max.

In the end, Alain, sitting in third like Max currently, went on to successfully defend his title against Williams. Will Max be able to do what Alain did in ’86? What are your thoughts?

These engines are way past the point where teams would normally consider swapping them, but McLaren can’t do that anymore without taking massive grid penalties.

Isn’t this a serious reliability risk for the last two races?
