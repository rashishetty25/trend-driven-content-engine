1ns0906,Championship Standings and Eliminations - Azerbaijan GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ns0906/championship_standings_and_eliminations/,2025-09-27, Statistics,"**WDC:** Hamilton has been mathematically eliminated from contention - even if he wins every remaining race he cannot score more points than Piastri currently has.

* With his DNF in Baku, the soonest Piastri could clinch the title would be in the Brazil Sprint. This would require Norris score no more than 8 points and Verstappen score no more than 52 points between now and the end of the sprint.
* If Piastri wins every race (GP and Sprint), he would clinch in Vegas, even if Norris comes 2nd in everything.
* Verstappen winning every race is not sufficient to guarantee the title, as need to outscore Piastri by 9.86 pt/race and Norris by 6.29 pt/race. Consequently, if Verstappen wins every race and Piastri comes 2nd in all, then Piastri would win in Abu Dhabi by 18 points.

**WCC:** Despite Red Bull's 1-6 and McLaren's 7-DNF, Red Bull did not outscore McLaren enough to remain in contention, and they were mathematically eliminated. With the poor results in Baku, the maximum points McLaren can now score is 969, so they can not surpass the 1000 point line; however they can still break the record for most points in a season (860, set by Red Bull in 2023).

McLaren can clinch in Singapore, provided they are not outscored by Mercedes by more than 30 points or Ferrari by more than 34 points. With a maximum of 43 points on offer, this is guaranteed to happen provided they score at least 13 points. This could happen by:

* 1 driver finishing on the podium, even if the other does not score points
* A 4th place finish, provided the other is 10th or higher
* A 5th place finish, provided the other is 8th or higher
* Finishing 6th and 7th","[""So you're saying there's still a chance for Ferrari?"", 'Was there a race this weekend?', 'admittedly not looking great for Doohan', 'Damn, so Max is out of the constructor championship...', 'I only see Max taking WDC if the papayas keep fighting â€˜til the end no matter if Max is winning over them.

Max needs to win at red bulls worst track and the mclarens have a papaya meltdown at what is expected to be one of their best. I think it's joever for max, but i hope i'm wrong, we need a last race title showdown again""]",924,65,0.98,924,2034,2034,35,0,0.0,35

Iâ€™m volunteering at this yearâ€™s **F1 US Grand Prix at COTA** as part of the **Intervention Team**. Iâ€™ll be flying in from out of state, so packing space is limited. I know weâ€™ll get full training on-site, but Iâ€™d love advice from anyone whoâ€™s done this before:

* What personal gear do you always bring with you?
* What does COTA provide vs. what do I need to supply myself?
* Any packing tips for someone traveling by air (compact essentials)?
* Anything you wish youâ€™d brought your first time?

I want to show up prepared, safe, and ready to work. Any advice from past COTA marshals or intervention crew would be hugely appreciated.
