People in Indy NXT aim for Indy, and/or lack the budget for F2, but the only single-seater series an IndyCar driver would want to go to is F1, and that's not a given (I'm sure people in the F1 paddock have called Palou). There's also the factor of IndyCar giving too few SL points for its level; just ask Colton Herta.\n\nRealistically, the pipeline mostly goes the other way. Look at how many IndyCar drivers started their careers in the feeder series ladder over in Europe, and then there are the ex-F1 drivers."", ""Bringing in a driver from Indycar is difficult. Deliberately so. \n\nMcLaren Indycar driver Pato O'Ward would need 40 super licence points to drive in F1, but his last 3 seasons in Indycar were 5th (8pts), 4th (10pts), and 7th (4pts) giving him a total of just 22 of the 40 points required. Had he got the same results in F2 they would have been 5th (20pts), 4th (30pts), and 7th (8pts) for a total of 58 points and a super licence. Fuck, he'd have got more points getting those results in F3, 5th (12pts), 4th (15pts), and 7th (7pts) for a total of 34 points. \n\nThe FIAs crappy assessment of Indycar results is near mirrored by their view of Superformula.\n\nThe FIA wants drivers to come up through their ranks."", 'IndyCar on Roads is quite similar to F2 in speed. Indy has more HP, but little less down force currently. On Ovals IndyCar reach 240 MPH. \n\nCurrently a good chunk of drivers from F2 move to Indy. There is no movement from Indy to anything but potentially F1 and that is pretty dead due to a lot of factors. \n\nSF is a bit faster than F2. There is some movement from F2 to SF and one SF champion is currently driving F2, with not much to show for after 1 1/2 seasons. \n\nIndy NXT is plenty fast for a feeder series. It has 450 HP (+50HP for P2P) and decent down force for what it is. It has 70 HP more than F3 and I would say comparable downforce. IndyNXT should be as fast or faster than F3. \n\nF4 is miles away from F3 and Indy NXT.', ""There's multiple reasons why drivers from non F-eeder classes aren't getting the same amount of shots as ones that are in the system.\n\n1: Points. Drivers in the other classes don't get the same amount of points as say, being a top 4 driver in F3 and/or F2 for a few seasons. A recent example being Colton Herta who just missed out on a superlicense despite having very impressive Indycar results.\n\n1.5: To add to that, Indycar (and most series with Americanized point systems) are inherently harder to succeed in. With a much bigger part of the grid getting points, as well as the points differentials being lower between winners and the rest of the top 5, as well as racing being much less prone to success monopoly (rd. one team/driver winning a majority of races due to superior equipment), it's much harder to consistently finish the season in high enough positions to accrue good license points, further exasperated by the lower license points.\n\n2: Feeder bias. The paddock is a small world, and being at the same race weekends as F1 teams has a significant effect on in-paddock perception of drivers and their talent. They're more scouted, there's more attention for them simply by being around major teams all the time. More often than not, many feeder drivers are also part of a young driver programme for one of the F1 teams (As well as often sharing sports agents that are 'in' with F1 teams), so F1 teams have a greater incentive to focus on their own youth than look to drivers outside of their own programmes.\n\n2.5: Also politically speaking, Liberty and the FIA want to prefer the feeder series because they are literally built to feed into F1. Teams structurally ignoring drivers from feeder series would hurt the prestige of the series, make it less marketeable, make young drivers less likely to go through the feeder series, and generally be seen as not being THE way to get into F1. There's a lot of money and corporate stakes at play who want the feeder series to keep its advantages.\n\n3: Level of competition. I won't claim F2 is a superior racing class with superior drivers to Indycar and Super Formula. But generally speaking they have a broader field of international talent, and there's definitely an inherent bias from teams and media towards Feeder series drivers as being better. Localized series with a heavy contingent of local drivers (for example, Super Formula only has 4 non-Japanese drivers this year) feeds the idea that there's less true talent, and thus drivers who don't utterly dominate are seen as inferior than drivers who have reasonable success in F2/F3. It's kinda unfair, but it's a pervasive bias that has existed for a long time.\n\n4: Car/track experience. Whilst Indycar and Super Formula have comparable open-wheel cars, they are very much their own class of cars with their own quirks and limitations. F2 and F3 have specifically been designed around being a ladder towards F1, with rulesets and cars (where reasonable) built around F1 specs. They also race on the same tracks (see point 2) as the F1 teams, so drivers have more track know-how, even though simulator work has become more prevalent, teams appreciate practical experience. It also leans into some of the earlier biases, but a top 4 F2 driver is seen as more F1-Ready than someone coming in from Indycar (where there's also a lot more oval racing that isn't present in F1)\n\nHonestly I agree with you that I would love to see F1 pull in more talent from outside their usual feeder series bubble, but F1 is nothing if not a world of politics and looking inward. The FIA and Liberty would love to see an American driver, but they want 'their' American driver, one they can in some form or fashion can mold as an F1 star and not necessarily one that cut their teeth in Indycar or elsewhere."", 'It is not necessarily speed that you use to measure the differences between races.

Indy and FE I find tough to seperate. I think FE has more breadth of talent through the field as Indy has some weak pay drivers, but also Indy has brilliant guys in the top half. These two championships are clear 2nd options if you miss F1.\n\nI did think about putting SF ahead of F2 because it has more professional drivers but I do think it being so national lowers the level of talent in its field.

Though could it also just be some drivers are better at managing tyres than others which is why someone like Martins or Fornoroli is lower on Quali pace than race pace?\xa0\n\nAs for Formula 1, Lindblad and Dunne are the only guys on the current F2 grid that look like F1 quality drivers. I would go as far as saying Lindblad is 90% gonna have a race seat next season because he’s next in the wings to go to Racing Bulls and I cannot see Verstappen, Tsunoda and Lawson all being in the Red Bull camp next year.\xa0\n\nIf Max stays Yuki’s out as they’ll put Hadjar in Red Bull and I doubt Yuki is going back to the b team. And Lawson’s been the worst performer out of the four this year.\xa0\n\nIf Max goes then theres a spot available. If he replaces Russell it may be a straight swap. But if I was George I’d got to Aston over RB. If Max replaced Kimi then Toto could try and get Kimi into the Alpine or as a reserve driver. Theres question marks over whether Kimi and his camp would want to keep ties with Toto if he got replaced after 1 year.\n\nTLDR - Lindblad’s almost defo gonna have \xa0an F1 spot next year.\xa0\n\nNow for Dunne. Dunne has impressed me more than anyone in F2 this year. Yes he makes mistakes but F1 teams prefer a rookie who makes mistakes but is super fast than a rookie who is consistently solid but doesn’t have that pure pace like Zhou.\xa0\n\nBut Dunne has a few things out of his control that are going against him. He’s arrived in a season where nearly all the F1 teams seem nailed down for 2026 and those who aren’t have other options. It’s sort of the opposite of last season Im F2 where anyone who had a good year could get into F1. This season is a case of right place wrong time.\xa0\n\nAnother problem for Dunne is that I’ve read an interview with him where he’s said that he probably won’t have the funds to do another year of F2. This year might be his only shot. \xa0\n\nSo if he’s not in F2 next year (which could be a year of more change on the F1 grid) he might be forgotten, similarly to Pourchaire, though he did not do it in his first season (If Pourchaire was a year later he’d probably be in F1).\xa0\n\nI hope for Dunne’s sake, as an Irish fan who’s never seen someone from my country in F1, that he gets a shot. However let’s see if he’s able to keep up the good form.', 'Yeah it feels like Lindblad is 99% confirmed for a F1 seat next year. And Dunne has impressed me the most as a rookie when also considering that he has dealt with possible funding issues in previous years before joining McLaren’s academy last year. There is no place for Dunne on the grid next year but hopefully he can continue to make a strong challenge for the championship, and then get more opportunities next year as McLaren’s reserve driver with more FP1s. Then by 2027 potentially get a full time seat secured somewhere. Piastri himself won F2 as a rookie in 2021 and didn’t have a seat in 2022 but it seems to have worked out well for him. \n\nThose two definitely have the most potential to become credible F1 drivers, but the rest of the grid isn’t that bad imo. Martins is the most prominent one for me because I believe he has the raw pace to get into F1, but his funding hasn’t been that good which held him back a few years and he isn’t able to consistently convert that qualifying pace into good points whether it’s due to tire management, racecraft, or sheer back luck (taken out by Dunne when he took the lead at Monaco as one example). His opportunity has passed unfortunately but Martins is definitely talented enough to have a good career in another category even if it isn’t F1.', 'Im not saying the rest of the grid is bad, just no one stands out as F1 worthy. It’s probably not the worst grid ever, how do you think it compares to 2020-2023?', 'Oh that specific comment wasn’t directed at you, but I did see a few comments in previous F2 posts saying this year’s grid is the worst in a long time just cause Verschoor who is in his 5th year and is honestly an above average F2 driver is leading the championship. \n\nI only started following F2 in 2021. I would say 2021’s grid is definitely better, 2023’s grid is slightly better, and 2022 is comparable to this year’s grid. \n\nSo the grid overall might not have that many top end talents, but I think part of that is also determined by hindsight bias because we know that there are hardly any available seats for 2026. I do feel so far this year’s grid is rather aggressive and we’ve seen some crazy incidents already, some of which have also included Dunne.']",43,5,0.9,43,4,4,7,0,-0.010000000000000009,7

1lq9vk7,[Driver61] Explains what's been going on with Lando and why Mclaren is so good on tyres,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lq9vk7/driver61_explains_whats_been_going_on_with_lando/,2025-07-02, Video,"**Driver61** really gave an insightful analysis and the reasoning seems to make sense. Basically McLaren have done something clever with their front suspension geometry to get **maximum anti-dive**. under braking, the car barely pitches forward, so the floor stays level, ground effect stays consistent and means its easier on the tyres

the downside is it numbs front-end feel for the driver, making it hard to tell where the grip is, especially on corner entry. Lando found it un-natural, so McLaren tweaked his suspension geometry / wishbone angle to bring some of the feel back. Piastri stuck with the original setup since he understood it and made sense to stick with what you know and are comfortable with.

It explains a lot why Lando was so off form (and backs what Sainz was saying too). If it's been resolved then we should get an exciting Mclaren drivers championship. And its just a shame the other teams have an incredible amount of catching up to do, almost to the point they should all shift their attention to 2026 new regs and McLaren's especially to double down on their advantage.

","[""I wish this guy could just make normal titles and keep the videos more level headed. My man just explains what anti-dive is, which is perfect if you don't know anything about it. But it adds legit nothing to the conversation about why McLaren is so good on tyres. I still remember when everyone went crazy about Red Bull's anti-dive suspension, if only they had as much anti-dive as McLaren then they would be competitive this year!"", 'It\'s a great video and while I didn\'t understand all the physics stuff, it was very informative. The only quibble I have is that he says they changed the suspension for Lando. Not really true. Both Oscar and Lando reported the ""numbness"" or lack of feeling in the car. When the new suspension part(s) was introduced in Canada it made a difference for Lando but Oscar said it made no real difference for him. Here is what Oscar said a couple of months ago, from Stella:\n\n""Oscar made a comment, he said after the Q2 lap that he thought ‘wow, this corner 1 is so good I\'m not sure I\'m going to be able to repeat it because I\'m not sure exactly how I made it, because the car didn\'t give me great feeling as to how this was happening\'.""']",0,2,0.47,0,2,2,0,2,0.47,0

Piastri didn’t lead the session even though McLaren looked dominant in the race. Am I crazy or are people making way too much of Dunne’s performance?\n\nFWIW it’s not anti-Dunne. I’d say the same if he was P18 in his session. It’s just I don’t think FP1 times are all that informative because we don’t know what teams are working on.', 'The McLaren car is great and quite easy to drive.\xa0\n\nThe Red Bull is not. They are made to look good by having one of the best drivers of all time. His team mates are not as good.\xa0', 'I do think the McLaren is much more ""plug and play"" than the Red Bull.\n\nBut I also think part of the takeaway should be that Alex Dunne is worth looking at for an F1 seat. We\'ve seen a lot of rookie FP1s, and it\'s rare for one to stand out. I know he stepped into the best car on the grid, but that was still impressive. McLaren trusted him to test the limits, and he did it. I saw an interview with Dunne where he was basically wishing that he could have had a run on fresh softs at the end to really test the limits. He ran soft, medium, soft (used from earlier in the hour).', 'Do wonder why Norris keeps pretending the car is that difficult to drive when in 20 minutes in F1 total a rookie is able to take that car and practically beat a driver like Yuki who is in his fifth year.', ""Tldr: it doesn't."", ""I agree. In fact, I would go further and say even judging a rookie on an actual grand Prix isn't that good of an idea. In recent years we've seen many rookies have a debut that's better than many of their subsequent races. de Vries clearly wasn't very fast based on his career up to that in point but he scored a point in a Williams on his debut. Lawson had a good debut race, finishing 13th at Zandvoort in tricky conditions with little notice. Bearman did decently on his Ferrari debut. Colapinto looked better in his first few races than he has since. Even Sergeant finished 12th on his debut. None of these were considered generational talents.\n\n\nI think people overestimate the jump from F2 or whatever other series to F1.
