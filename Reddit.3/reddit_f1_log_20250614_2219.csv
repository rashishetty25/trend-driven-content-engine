From what I understand the past few months, their straight line speed deficit is due to their supreme cooling?"", 'Translation:\n\n> **McLaren had to wait in line on the first day of practice. George Russell and Max Verstappen stole the show from the Papaya racers. And they can also keep up with the seven-time season winner in the long run.**\n\n> First fastest time for Max Verstappen, second for George Russell: Where are the McLarens? In the first practice session, the championship leaders were hiding in the midfield. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri provided data for a new aero package. Their attack in the second practice session brought them closer to the front, but still not quite to the front. Piastri\'s conclusion: ""The day ended better than it started. But it still has to get better.""\n\n> Russell set the fastest time of the day, which was all the more impressive because it was achieved on the harder medium tires. The drivers in the top spots were almost all on soft tires. This raises the question of whether the C5 rubber (medium), as in Imola, might not actually be the better tire in qualifying. Red Bull, Mercedes, and Aston Martin would answer in the affirmative.\n\n> The long runs are as close as the fastest laps. Russell, on the medium tires, had only a razor-thin lead over Norris, Piastri, and Verstappen. Mercedes, McLaren, and Red Bull all spoke of the need for fine-tuning the car setup. Red Bull even wants to return to the state of the first practice session, when the car felt more stable. The majority of the field completed the long run on the medium tires. Alonso was swimming against the tide on soft tires, while the Sauber drivers were on the hard tires. Nico Hülkenberg commented after a busy day of practice: ""We may have to rethink our tire choice. The soft tire is lasting longer than expected.""\n\n *Six things you need to know:*\n\n> **1) What\'s going on with McLaren?**\nMcLaren took a long time to break into the top six. Half the morning was spent on aerodynamic measurements. Oscar Piastri drove with aerodynamic measurement grids, Lando Norris with lots of flow viz. There were reasons for this. McLaren fielded a new front wing concept and a more efficient rear wing, which should also work at Spa, Baku, and Las Vegas. They also introduced a new front axle geometry that should give Norris more feel when turning. But does it help Piastri? The Australian was further behind Norris than he had been in a long time. Between three and five tenths.\n\n> Only when the McLaren drivers were allowed to use soft tires in the second practice session did they get a little closer to their usual positions, but not close enough. Norris finished second, 28 thousandths of a second behind George Russell. However, the Englishman was using the harder tires for his best time. Piastri improved to sixth place. His deficit to Friday\'s pole position was a whopping 0.439 seconds, however. The championship leader apologized: ""I was looking for the best window for the tires, but I haven\'t made enough progress yet.""\n\n> Piastri believes McLaren will have to fight harder for victory in Montreal than anywhere else. ""You can see that in the tight gaps."" Montreal is certainly not McLaren\'s best track. In terms of top speed, the Papaya racers are in the bottom third, which is significant with three long straights. The difference to Red Bull was up to seven km/h, compared to five km/h to Mercedes.\n\n> **2) Who is the favorite: Verstappen or Russell?**\nMax Verstappen won the first practice session, George Russell the second. While Verstappen\'s best time on soft tires could be described as the Max factor, Mercedes showed its strength as a team. Russell set the fastest time of the day with a 1:12.123 minutes on medium tires. Andrea Kimi Antonelli was just under three-tenths behind in third on soft tires. New tracks are inspiring the Italian. Antonelli had already shone in Miami.\n\n> The Mercedes drivers were generally satisfied with the balance of their W16s. A modification to the underbody resulted in a bit more downforce. After a comparison test between the old and new rear axles in the first practice session, both cars were equipped with the new design in the afternoon. Whether the tires remained balanced during the long runs due to the moderate track temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or due to the modified rear mechanicals was unclear. Probably a combination of both.\n\n> Verstappen wore a satisfied face after the first practice session. Finally, his Red Bull was back in form from the first lap. Two minimal setup changes for the second session had negative consequences, according to motorsport director Helmut Marko. The car bounced over the curbs again and was unstable. ""That shows how narrow the window of opportunity for our car is."" Red Bull will return to the initial specification for Saturday. Therefore, Marko remained optimistic: ""If the car is as good as it was at the beginning, we\'ll be in the game. Strangely, the changes didn\'t have as much of an impact in the long run as they did on one lap. In that respect, we\'re on a par with Piastri."" What\'s new: Mercedes is another competitor.\n\n> **3) How strong is Ferrari?**\nAfter 14 laps, Ferrari was a one-man team. Charles Leclerc\'s car clipped the wall completely unnecessarily in FP1, chipping both of his left-hand wheels. The left front wheel damaged the chassis. That spelled doom for Leclerc. It was little consolation that he was leading at the time.\nLewis Hamilton finished the two practice sessions in fifth and eighth place, and didn\'t necessarily look like a likely winner. The long run, the Ferrari\'s real strength, was also disappointing. Hamilton was even slower than the Williams drivers and Pierre Gasly.\n\n(1/2)', 'Congrats on coming out Mclaren!!!!!', 'So their engine was turned way more down than the others.\n\nOr its just a usual Mcl thing.', ""Ferrari's being slower than the Williams this weekend?

People who are fans of a specific team sometimes talk about themselves as if they are part of that team, much like soccer fans do for their favourite club.

""We look really strong this weekend""

""I have faith we'll be faster in race trim""

""Ugh. Bad strategy calls cost us every weekend""

I find this quite jarring. I totally get that McLaren or Ferrari can be your absolutely favourite team in all of sport and you feel a passionate connection with those teams, but unlike soccer clubs or baseball teams or NFL teams or other team based sports, which are often named after a specific location where they play, F1 teams are ultimately just private businesses.

Is that something you can talk about yourself in the first person if you aren't actually a member of that team?

Or am I just massively overthinking this lol","['You are massively overthinking this.', 'Bruh, that is all sports fans.
