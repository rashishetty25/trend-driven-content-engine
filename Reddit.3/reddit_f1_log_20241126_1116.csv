However, in terms of points, Rosberg outscored Schumacher 93-49.

However, his mechanical DNFs almost always occurred when he was running behind Rosberg (only exception being Australia), so ironically the timing of his mechanical bad luck actually ended up helping his race head-to-head.\n\nLuck-corrections are inherently subjective and require quite a lot of extrapolation, but any competent attempt to do so will come out as Schumacher and Rosberg being very evenly matched in races as well in 2012.\n\nMy conclusion: Rosberg and Schumacher were as good as equal in 2012, in both qualifying and races.

1gzqsgt,How Colton Herta is personally linked to Cadillac/General Motors' F1 entry and how he can obtain a FIA Super License to race in F1 as early as next week.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzqsgt/how_colton_herta_is_personally_linked_to/,2024-11-25, Discussion,"**The first question may be ""*why Colton Herta specifically for Cadillac F1?*"".**

Colton Herta is a current Andretti driver, he is American, he's fast and he's a fan favorite in IndyCar. But this is not all.

Colton is personally sponsored by a big insurance group called Group 1001 and he is one of their biggest ambassadors. His IndyCar is infact sponsored by Group 1001 and Gainbridge (a Group 1001 company)

Colton got this sponsorship via Dan Towriss, the CEO of Group 1001. Dan is a big personal supporter of Colton.

This circles back to Cadillac F1 as Dan Towriss has also recently become Andretti Global's CEO after the sidelining of Michael Andretti, and he's now the lead figure behind the General Motors entry in F1.

American driver on american car would be pretty big for marketing reasons, and Colton also combines this with natural speed (never fully exploited in IndyCar) and a personal connection to a soon-to-be F1 ""team owner"".

**How close is Colton Herta to obtaining a FIA Super License?**

Colton currently has 39 points, 1 short of the 40 points needed to obtain a Super License, thanks to the special COVID-19 exception that allows drivers to count their best 3 championship placements of the last 4 years, as long as 2021 is one of those years.

* 2021 - 8 pt (5th in IndyCar)

* 2022 or 2023 - 1pt (10th in IndyCar)

* 2024 - 30 pt (2nd in IndyCar)

**How can Colton get the necessary points for a super license ahead of the 2026 season?**

There are actually a lot of ways, I will list a few:

- Taking part in a single FP1 session in the next 2 F1 weekend, he would gain precisely 1 point.

This is unlikely. With only 2 races to go and a Sprint Race in Qatar, the only chance would be Abu Dhabi, but with such short notice it's hard to imagine this being possible.

If Colton does not get it this year, then a problem arises: entering the 2025 season the COVID-19 exception would expire and he would find himself with 31 points (1 pt from 2023, 30 pt from 2024). He would lack 9 points that can obtained in the following ways:

- Finishing 4th in IndyCar he would get 10 points. IndyCar is hard and extremely unpredictable. A bunch of unfortunate crashes can make the difference between finishing 3rd or 9th in the final standings, so this is risky.

- Completing 9 F1 FP1 sessions regardless of IndyCar placement would also guarantee him enough points. A driver can collect up to 10 points by doing 10 different FP1 sessions. IndyCar and F1 however often clash, getting all this seat time is very expensive and it's doubtful there are even this many FP1 sessions available to buy from other teams.

- The most realistic scenario then becomes a mix of the above. For example finishing 7th in IndyCar and doing 5 FP1 sessions would be enough and logistically easier to coordinate.

- There is also the possibility of competing in more a series in a single year: a driver can also get points for multiple (2) championship in a single calendar year, and the FIA ladder has multiple ""farmable"" championship in the off-season. The *Asian Le Mans Series* for example is a 3 events endurance championship held between December/February that gives 10/8/6/4/2 points. All seats are filled in LMP1 for the first weekend, but maybe they can be bought out.

Overall there are many ways, some more convoluted than others and some riskier than others, but it's not unrealistic for Herta to be in the 2026 Cadillac F1 team.","['The FIA could also just grant Herta the same exemption they gave Colapinto, who was also on 39 points, and give him a super license tomorrow.', ""He just needs to have a good season in 2025 then it sorts itself out. As long as he finishes at least 6th it shouldn't be a problem."", 'Which F1 team is going to let a rival driver do 5 x FP1 sessions?', 'cadillac is just andretti renamed right? or is it a completely new entity?', 'If Colton Herta really wanted a super licence he‚Äôd just run the Toyota series in NZ, that would give him the points (and extra buffer points) for under 200k in the space of a month in the off season for all the other series.

Instead, Michael Andretti is out, Mario Andretti is relegated to a non-executive board position, and GM have agreed to pay more than double the original anti-dilution feed. Formula 1 got practically everything they wanted, which doesn't make much sense if they were running scared from the Department of Justice.\n\n*Autosport* have put forward [this piece](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/why-general-motors-has-got-the-green-light-that-andretti-did-not/10676534/) explaining why the team got in, and this part stood out to me:\n\n>Autosport understands that key to getting F1 interested was in Towriss working with General Motors to change the nature of the deal. So where originally it was an Andretti car that would eventually hope to run a General Motors engine, but would have customer Renaults to begin with, the project being put on the table now is nothing like that.

It sounds like Andretti wanted to enter his team and GM had the option of developing an engine to supply them with from 2028, but they weren't obligated to provide it. So if the Andretti team wasn't doing as well as expected or if they could get a better deal from an existing supplier, then GM would be able to write off or repurpose whatever engine development they had done. If I'm being charitable, then I have to say that that feels a bit misleading because Andretti's complaint was that they were being frozen out, but giving GM the option of engaging means that they weren't being completely honest. At worst, it sounds like a bit of a Trojan horse where Andretti uses the promise of an GM engine to enter the sport in 2028, but they never have the intention of using a GM engine -- and they get to keep their entry even when the GM engine never materialises.\n\nThat might sound like splitting hairs, but it would go a long way towards explaining why Formula 1 never really responded to the investigation and how they were able to broker a new deal with GM directly instead of capitulating and letting Andretti in on his terms."", ""That's what the article says, yes"", 'Fom always stated that a entry of GM would maybe be successful.

Even if Liberty (and the teams) were found guilty of anti-trust violations, it's fines and sanctions, they couldn't force them to take the new entry. What it does is force them back to the negotiating table and while Andretti, Towriss and GM had leverage it doesn't mean that they get whatever they want. It just means that you force the other side to come to an arrangement that they can live with.\n\n>\xa0So where originally it was an Andretti car that would eventually hope to run a General Motors engine\n\nYou could maybe claim that was the case in January of 2023, despite what GM said and followed through on, but not after they announced they would be a PU supplier in 2028 in November. This was a full works outfit with massive financial backing and support from GM engineers in Charlotte and Warren by the time FOM rejected them in Jan of 2024.\n\nThe deal they've done now, wasn't just done with GM. Dan Towriss is front and centre as CEO of Andretti Global. The spiteful part of removing Andretti, especially saying that this is a partnership with TWG doesn't mean that the company isn't involved. I'm sure certain sources are telling reporters like Autosport that this is a different bid so they can save face, but it seems that most actual journalists are reporting that the investigations had a massive impact on the reversal and especially the timing.\n\nThe fact that Mario is involved tells me that Michael agreed to step aside in order to make this happen.

The tarmac, heat and many other things do their own part as well.

We don't have a whole lot of data for F1 cars on this circuit, especially not since ground effect came back. I've always likened it a bit to the Bahrain GP in my head except there are pretty much no low speed corners in Qatar wherears there are quite a few at Bahrain. Last year McLaren and Red Bull were much better than anyone else here but the competitive order in similar circuits has somewhat shifted and the top cars all have different strengths and weaknesses now. For example the SF23 probably had to manage like crazy last year with it's tyre gobbling tendency, but this year's car has an opposite problem which could yet be an advantage if they get the set up right.

I for one don't expect McLaren to just outright dominate uncontested, I feel like we could get a similar scenario to what happened at the US GP where McLaren were expected to dominate effortlessly only to end up losing to Ferrari of all the cars. Even the Mercedes credentials looked better than Ferrari before that race. 

If Ferrari outscores McLaren by 15 or more pts, that would surely spice up the WCC and make us Ferrari fans very happy.

If Leclerc and Sainz don't prioritize getting at each other's throats over winning that is :D","['Not Mercedes as they are suited to cooler temperatures. Not Perez because need I go on?

1gzqpr6,Is it time for a  new points system ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzqpr6/is_it_time_for_a_new_points_system/,2024-11-25, Discussion,"A few months a there were  rumours that the  FIA was considering changes to the points by expanding it to 12 positions by reducing the gaps from 7th--12th to one point, though nothing came out of ir

Now that Cadillac has been confirmed for 2026 , I think it's a good time for the FIA to consider changing the points system . Especially since there was a result just a few weeks back ( Alpine double podium) that exposed the flaws of the current system. Its rewards freak results from weaker teams and punishes their consistency.


I have had a system in mind that would expand points to the top 14. I think that would enough to reward consistency and protect the standings against freak results.  It goes like this

1. 40
2. 30
3. 25
4. 20
5. 17
6. 14
7. 12
8. 10
9. 8
10. 6
11. 4
12. 3
13. 2
14. 1

This points progressively increase the gap for every milestone ( top 10, top5 , podium, win). This system also more else maintains the ratios between two places, atleast within the top 5.

I would also a like a point for pole. I think it's disappointing to see efforts like Magnussen in Brazil 2024 go completely unrewarded and the fact the pole means absolutely nothing at tracks like COTA. Its far fairer than the Fastest lap point and won't matter that much when the winner gets 40 points. The only disadvantage I can think of is that it leaves for the championship to be decided on a Saturday, but let's be real in that scenario the championship was already over before qualifying

1gzinwd,Hot take: Why a slow Perez benefits Red Bull,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzinwd/hot_take_why_a_slow_perez_benefits_red_bull/,2024-11-25, Discussion,"Let's be honest: In the general public the WDC is much more prestigious than the WCC, for example in 2021 nobody really cared that Mercedes won the WCC since Max won the WDC

With Perez massively underperforming this season the WCC likely won't be achieved, it looks like they'll finish 3rd despite having a very dominant car for the beginning of the season. Max won 7/10 races, with the other placement being P2, P6 and a DNF; Checo had decent placements with 6 Top 5 finishes (4 Podiums) despite 2 DNFs in the first 10 races. Although the placements were ok, the gap to Max was huge even in the beginning of the season. Nevertheless RB didn't replace Checo despite having a history of booting underperfoming drivers - so I wondered what might've icentivized them to not do that this year.

My obvious conlusion are the aero regulations, more precisely the [restricions on wind tunnel and CFD-time](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/how-f1s-new-sliding-scale-aero-testing-rules-work-and-what-impact-they-will.pn0sG8N4A0cjbNRbdYx8a). Assuming RB finishes 3rd, McLaren and Ferrari will have 70% / 75% of the base level wind tunnel / CFD time, whereas RB will have 80%

This gives RB an advantage in development for/during next season. They have a higher chance of being able to field a strong enough car for Max to win the WDC, yet  finish lower than Mclaren/Ferrari/Mercedes in the WCC. 

They're obviously not doing this on purpose but I think they are willing to take that risk.

For other teams this is not a viable strategy but Red Bull isn't a car manufacturer that lays importance on the WCC. RB is in F1 solely for marketing purposes, a WDC is by far the biggest marketing asset in their mind.

RB loses some price money in the process, but Checo also brings in sponsorship money and is a marketing asset in Latin America which might offset their monetary loss.

tldr: RB might be willing to lose the WCC in order to have more development time and therefore a bigger chance of winning the WDC which is their biggest priority.","['Biggest problem is that the bonuses of the employees depend on the constructor standings, so unless they compensate it will hurt Red Bull. The employees make, fix and maintain the car.

I used to work at Red Bull for a few years, and I can certainly say that a lot of people who actually build the car wouldn\'t be too keen to stick around if their annual bonuses were slashed in half (or even nulled if they place below 3rd in the WCC).

Do you go to many motorsport events local to you? Irrespective of what the public may or may not think, the constructors' championship is the more important championship for the people that make the sport happen. Motorsport is more about the team than it is about the drivers; [the sheer amount of work that goes into fielding a car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rqf5bZSjWk) rests solely on the mechanics and engineering teams that work late hours to get a package that can be put on track. No team will voluntarily compromise this so that they can get more development time next year - the employees deserve to be rewarded for their labour, any notion that upper management would sacrifice them in favour of more wind tunnel time is naive on its face. \n\nThe best development strategy for the next set of regulations is success in the current regulations. It doesn't guarantee that your package will be the best, but there is more to winning races than a strong car. You need the team to be capable of making the difference when all other things are equal, you do not get that edge when you're complacent. RBR is and will be successful despite their underperformance, not because of it."", 'How many of these posts are we going to get?', ""Employee bonuses are dependant on the WCC result of the team.\n\nFor every employee that isn't Max, Perez, or C Suite this is a pay cut.
