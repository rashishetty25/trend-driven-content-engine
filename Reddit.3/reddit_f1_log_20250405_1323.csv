Later I watched the ‚Äúinternational‚Äù feed aka Sky and they actively said DRS was not open replay after replay. How‚Äôs that possible when it‚Äôs so obvious on the steering wheel? ,"['An then there is German Sky with Ralf Schumacher who thought it was a bump in the track or a engine braking malfuntion until his son David wrote him a quick message telling him its the DRS lol', 'I‚Äôm pretty sure Ant mentioned it almost immediately? But then they heard he dipped a tire so they all kinda just dropped it?', 'Ant said he probably left the DRS open, he kept requesting they show the camera shot so he could confirm it.', 'Ant mentioned it right away', 'I think which broadcast you watch depends on what you want out of it.  I watched Sky for 3 years before switching to F1TV for the last 3.  Sky felt more traditional with sportscaster personalities and typical storylines being the emphasis.  \n\nWith F1TV, I enjoy the more technical discussions they emphasize with Sam, Jolyon, and David‚Ä¶ then the addition of the strategist with Ruth.  For FP1 this week, they had a long time former Red Bull crew member and it was fascinating to hear his take on what was going on.  Plus they have all the reserve drivers drop by occasionally.  It just feels much more interesting for my viewing preference. \n\nNeither are the ‚Äúright one‚Äù - just whichever one you enjoy listening to based on how you consume sporting events.  I like to know how the sausage is made, so F1TV is better at scratching that itch.\n\nEdit: corrected a comment about FP1 being this week‚Ä¶ not year.', 'How did you go the entire time not acknowledging Ant had his theories about this?', 'So you\'ve got the Sky booth with Crofty in it and a producer. Expert commentator Villeneuve is not there - he is out traipsing around the circuit, which is a good thing; it\'s what they normally do with Brundle during FP2, it\'s a great part of Sky\'s coverage. Davidson is the second expert commentator but he\'s also not in the booth - to save some money he\'s back in the UK, so he\'s not actually there with Crofty.  \n\nWhen they show the onboard replays it\'s clear to me that Doohan doesn\'t switch off DRS by pressing a steering wheel button. I\'m watching wondering why they don\'t acknowledge that, I think ""maybe that\'s not how it works"", so I wait for the replay looking down the straight so we can see whether the DRS was open or not. \n\nF1 shows this replay once during the session, and it\'s while they are crossing to Villeneuve out on the track - so the replay is shown in a little thumbnail on the Sky feed; it\'s not seen by Villeneuve, and it\'s missed by Crofty. Kind of a perfect storm. \n\nThe weird part of this is that the producers or Davidson don\'t take another look at that replay to see what we all see. Particularly during all the red flag periods that come during the session. Davidson is awesome, but he and the producers definitely missed this.', 'Pretty sure Ant Davidson mentioned it multiple times', 'It‚Äôs weird because Davidson suggested it was the cause at 51:50 and almost prophetically spoke of it toward the end of FP1']",2628,210,0.93,2628,6417,6417,35,0,0.0,35

I wanted to make this post because when I've mentioned Ryo in the past, many people have thought I was talking about Indonesian former F1 driver Rio Haryanto. 

Ryo had a really admirable FP1 today. I am not placing undue importance on finishing order in free practice, or making a big deal that he finished ahead of Gasly, but for how little time he's had in any F1 car, he did remarkably well. He wasn't afraid to push the car, and clearly Alpine had the faith in him to let him. Too often rookie FP1 sessions just have the rookies all at the back playing extremely safe.

Ryo starting racing at the quite late age of 13, after watching the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton won that day. Ryo saw those F1 cars, and he wanted to race. A year later, he won the 2008 all Japan junior kart championship.

Since then, he's had incredible success in Super GT, WEC, and Super Formula. But he's clearly always had interest in racing in the rest of the world and being part of F1. He stopped racing in Super GT when he got the opportunity to join WEC (and he won WEC hypercar that year, and the next year). When he got the oppotttunity to be an F1 test and reserve driver, he left Super Formula as well, so now he only does WEC amd F1 work. I‚Äôd love for him to get even just one F1 race. 

I‚Äôm not trying to take Doohan's seat from him. But I am saying that maybe he shouldn‚Äôt race this weekend. That was a massive crash. Also, the team has Ryo right there who knows the track really well and was proper quick in FP1. Maybe I‚Äôd just love to see a 31 year old man with an F1 dream who is super accomplished in other racing series to get than chance in front of his home crowd.","['I love the appreciation for Ryo, (our) member of Toyota #8.

Most strikingly F1 tempo does not indicate that Max lost all his time in the hairpin. I think the official one is probably more accurate and F1 Tempo is mostly being held back by the poor sampling rate that FastF1 provides (5 Hz).\n\nI also think it shows some care needs to be taken when interpreting the data from FastF1 and visualisations such as F1 Tempo. This can be important since some journalists/media outlets use this data to draw certain conclusions. \n\nExample: [video by The Race](https://youtu.be/q9UrEGSYfpo?si=PPt7u-lABglj_6ON&t=132) (time-stamp 2:12).', 'AFAIK they have access to 4 significant digits after the decimal. They only use 3 digits though. And polling rate is probably similar to those. 1000hz compared to 4-5hz is such a huge gap.\xa0', 'F1Tempo aligns some data points manually and they lose sector-by-sector delta accuracy. That\'s because publicly available data is sampled at a much less frequent rate compared to what F1 and the teams have available.\n\nOn my own app, I use resampling and interpolation + distance shifting to align the data as best as I can before calculating the delta. On top of that, I also align them by minisectors. Basically, I try to preserve the gaps at ""sector gates"" for the delta. It will never be 1:1 and depending on the quality of the data, there might be some error on braking zones, but I feel like the end result is usually more accurate than what F1Tempo provides, if you compare it across the entire lap.\n\n[You can have a look into mine here](https://i.imgur.com/a8CRtDg.jpeg)', 'Me dumb. Learn me numbers meaning please.', ""Definitely a very interesting topic. I've noticed that the accuracy of the delta from f1tempo varies from session to session. Sometimes I notice that the delta is off by as much as 0.3s-0.5s, while in other cases it seems to be spot on."", ""I'm not sure off the top of my head what a reasonable sample resolution would be here, but wow, 5Hz does feel low."", ""I think that it's not the sampling rate that's the main problem, but the accuracy of the data itself, incluing the gps positioning."", ""Is the y-axis reversed in the Official telemetry? What I mean is, Verstappen is in blue and he had the faster lap, yet the delta shows his line above Yuki's, whereas on F1tempo Yuki's line is above the blue line meaning that going up the y-axis indicates positive delta time."", ""Sampling cannot be an explanation for a bad delta, it can only be an explanation for missed inputs or inaccurate speed but only at most for 200ms. Their position on track and their relative time will simply be off for a bit but then update to accurate within 200ms at most because 5Hz is 5 times a second. This is plenty for an accurate enough delta. There's something else wrong here.\n\nIf anything, I wonder if the official one is wrong. Look at the speed graphs. How is it possible for Max to lose so much delta in that hairpin with those speed graphs? He enters the corner a bit slower, but has a higher minimum speed and exits it the same as Yuki. It doesn't make sense that he lost a tenth there.""]",114,24,0.92,114,132,132,6,0,0.0,6

Interesting to see are their two different approaches: Lando lifts straight off the throttle and stomps then back on it, whereas Max has a more ""rounded"" approach to this. Lando gets the better exit and goes flat through T3, where Max has to lift slightly. Max gains time by being on the throttle longer inbetween T4 and T5, yet has a worse exit out of T6. In the Dunlop (T7), Lando has to lift slightly, which brings Max back to his tail. The Degners paint a clear picture: Max is longer on the throttle, lifts more gradual, yet steps on back on it just as quick, lifts more gradual, brakes 10 metres later and hops back onto the throttle as quick as Lando does. Nonetheless, has a worse exit out of the Degners and loses time approaching the Hairpin. Max has a slightly better exit out of it and begins clawing back speed to Lando. Spoon is the masterpiece of this lap: Braking about 40 metres later than Lando, he carries more speed into T14, where he doesn't bother with feathering like Lando, but steps once onto the accelerator. Yet, a significantly worse exits loses him quite some speed until T15. At the Casino Triangle, the strategy should be clear to everyone by now: Max brakes 30 metres later and and steps more onto the throttle inbetween T16 and T17, but has, yet again, a worse exit out of this tricky last corners. Lando gains much speed approaching T18, but is momentarily stationary on the throttle pedal. Max comes closer again and this was maybe the difference inbetween P1 and P2 today.

My conclusion: Despite his many complaints, Max has complete trust into the cars braking characteristics and is able to compensate much this way, despite not being able to step onto the the accelerator as soon as Lando (as seen inbetween the Degners and T16/17).  
(the eagle-eyed may have spotted, that Lando's throttle graph is slightly beneath Max's in the high-speed factions. In fact, he drives at 99%, a few spikes exclued, where Max is at 100%. Two theories of mine: Either the data is faulty OR McLaren has built in a mechanical resistor into the gas pedal, which the pilots have to overpower to get the pedal to the metal. Not to conceal massive power, but to slightly improve reliability) ","['I would love to see a ghost car lap comparison like the one for China', ""Margin so fine my blind ass without glasses couldn't see after staring for 3 minutes straight"", ""30M into the final chicane sounds way off.

Almost all external body pieces destroyed, along with suspension.  What‚Äôs left?  Maybe some electronics,  parts of the brakes?
