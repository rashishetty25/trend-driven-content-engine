so I buy both apple TV and F1TV app $29.99 per year subscription, try watch in apple TV nothing there it seems till 2026

open F1 TV app, says I need a “pro” subscription (after paying $30) and it seems I need to go to the site to get that

then I go to F1 site, click watch sprint there, and then it says upgrade sub, click that, when I get to the next page it just says manage subscription on Apple F1 app and there is nothing to upgrade here

1ors8jt,im starting to think that F1 is trying everything in their power to be as ANTI-Racing as possible.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ors8jt/im_starting_to_think_that_f1_is_trying_everything/,2025-11-08, Discussion,"At this point its getting a bit ridiculous and its draining the love i once had for the sport. Every race is just terribly executed. Im watching the 8 hours of bahrain as we speak. and its so refreshing to see a motorsport BE a motorsport. we dont have that in F1 anymore. It likes to brand itself as the pinnacle. But its not, it really isnt.

  
The broadcasting is just bad. Theyre trying everything to miss as much as possible. As someone who likes to simrace, im racing in a gt3 league currently. where there is better broadcasting to be found. by 2 dudes and 5 viewers. Im not even kidding. almost constant picture in picture. to constantly switching at the right times. Its much better than f1 and i stand by it. they should be ashamed, that 2 amateurs can broadcast a 40 person race and miss less than probably a dozen professionals with half the cars. 



The calls they make are just beyond ridiculous. i get it, sometimes you cant always get it right. but with the VSC last race and the call here to do a rolling start. its so obvious you dont do any of those things. it kills the action and its not even for safety because there is no risk to be had. Its an entertainment industry and they cant figure out how to get more people hooked. 

Maybe not killing the action as it happens help boosts the number. 

  
i am writing this out of frustration and im sure theres much more instances to name. but my brain is just cluttered because im honestly baffled by how bad f1 is compared to other series. 



All that oil money. and still no good racing...

1orxtng,F1 needs better yellow flag/full course yellow systems,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1orxtng/f1_needs_better_yellow_flagfull_course_yellow/,2025-11-08, Discussion,"I’m constantly amazed at how slow f1 is sometimes at throwing full yellow flags for big incidents, and Bortoletto’s crash today was a perfect example. 

A driver has had a huge, high speed accident which triggers the medical car, and yet they allow everyone else to continue racing at full speed up until the final straight. What happens if there is a second incident that requires the medical car? (Im hoping they have a second medical car on standby, but I’m unsure on this, so correct me if you know please)

Looking at Indycar, full course yellows are thrown as soon as there is an incident. I do think they are sometimes too quick to throw these, and sometimes put them out for no reason, which can be frustrating. However, during obviously big incidents, Indycar are so much quicker at neutralising the race and ensuring safety. They also have the fantastic AMR safety team who are positioned all over the circuits, and are on the scene of accidents in far shorter times than f1. Just look at Max’s Baku crash in 2021 for example. Max gets out of the car by himself, and is stood on the track with cars passing him at high speeds (which is my next point) before the medical car gets to him. The AMR team in Indycar are almost always on the scene immediately to help a driver out of the car.

And as I said, my next point is just how fast drivers are still able to travel under yellow flag conditions. All a driver has to to to comply with a single yellow flag is to lift off the throttle, which does next to nothing in terms of reducing speed, although granted it does slightly reduce the chance of a driver losing control. Drivers are able to travel at well over 200kph through yellow flags without breaking the rules, which is frankly insane.

I think it’s about time f1/fia take a leaf from Indycara book, and look at improving their yellow flag and safety car procedures
 ","[""> Looking at Indycar, full course yellows are thrown as soon as there is an incident.\n\nI think Marcus Ericsson disagrees with that one.\n\nF1 distinguishes between single and double waved yellow flags. Double waved yellow flags mandate a ''significant'' reduction in speed and preparation to stop if necessary. A single waved yellow doesn't specify the significant reduction and only demands a driver be prepared to change direction, not stop.\n\nThere is a distinction and the system works perfectly fine. It certainly works a lot better than leaving a race completely green with a car stranded on the entry into a blind corner so the leaders can make their pit stops."", ""meh, realistically it's  acrash after the finish at the end of a race where they can just finisht he race and everyone will naturally be slow after the line because they aren't racing.\n\nUltimately safety is key, but if the race is ending before they even get there again there is very little risk. They also have more than one medical car, the actual risk of multiple medical car needing crashes is beyond minimal and ruining the final lap of a race for fundamentally not much reason just isn't really worth it."", 'The fact you seemingly don’t understand the difference between single and double yellows, or that they even exist, kinda invalidates your whole post.', 'Well, Indycar is raced on ovals with significantly shorter tracks.... also the speed difference makes running into a dangerous sector a higher risk endeavor.', 'How do I not understand single and double yellows?', 'The Indycar safety team is the same on both ovals and traditional race circuits', 'Because you talk about “all they have to do with a single yellow” acting as if that’s the only option or is at all relevant to a crash like you then go on to describe. A single yellow is for things like a car going wide, it’s appropriate for that and unrelated to anything we saw today. \n\nDouble yellows mean “slow down and prepare to stop”, what more do you need? Why shut down the whole circuit for an inside 2 miles away?', 'I’m aware that this crash was a double waved yellow. What I’m saying is that when there is a single waved yellow, I don’t think requiring drivers to briefly lift off the throttle is safe enough when it means you can still be doing well in excess of 200kph past a stationary car']",0,9,0.27,0,8,8,0,9,0.27,0
