Alpine and Renault were more or less the same given they are both the Enstone team.', 'I\'m very grateful for putting the 2 ""Lotus"" wins as other. Too many of these things include them with Team Lotus.', 'Hi everyone!\n\nThis is an updated version of a post I did some years ago ([here](https://reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/gnce67/race_wins_colored_by_team_improved_version/)). All data comes from [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/) (thanks!).\n\n### Constructor Race Wins I\n\nTo start: constructors/teams [1] race winners (with at least 20 wins). Dots inside of the squares are used instead of similar colours to more easily identify the teams. I tried to choose the most famous historical colours of the team, but sometimes I had to pick other colours to make the image more readable - for instance, McLaren got the more recent orange rather than the traditional red/white/silver. Indianapolis 500 winners are marked separately because, despite being part of the F1 WDC, most F1 teams did not participate in it and vice-versa.\n\nMercedes dominance between 2014-2020 creates a very visible teal mark, but we can also see other teams with strong year(s): Mclaren in the end of the 80s, Ferrari in the 50s and 00s, Red Bull last years (2021-2024). The legacies of Ferrari, and McLaren are clear: the largest interval between wins was 4 years (!) for Ferrari (1990 - 1994) and 9 years for McLaren (2012 - 2021). Williams was also very impressive in the 80s and 90s, but since then they\'ve had only a few wins in the early 2000s and their last win in 2012 (by Maldonado).\n\n### Constructor Race Wins II\n\nWe can expand this plot to all race winners, and also add columns with the WCC winner and the team with the most wins. There are some years where multiple teams have the same number of wins, and in those cases the WCC, if one of them, is selected (otherwise it\'s random).\n\nThere are some solitary wins from many teams, usually a mixture of brilliant racing and a great share of luck, more recently Toro Rosso (2008), Alpha Tauri (2020), Racing Point (2020) and Alpine (2021). And there are also some ""one-season wonder"" teams with amazing (but short) performances like Brawn (2009) and Renault (2005/6). It\'s also interesting to see that, alongside the periods of the stronger teams (Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes in the last decade), we have legendary teams popping up, having some good seasons, and disappearing again: Alfa Romeo (the first champions), Vanwall, Lotus, Tyrrell, Brabham and even Maserati.\n\nThere are some seasons where the WCC is not the team with most wins (e.g. just a couple of years ago, in 2021), usually because the second driver falls short of the competition. Amazingly, in 1982, the WCC was Ferrari with 3 wins, despite both McLaren and Renault having 4 wins each! Reliability is important!\n\n### Driver Race Wins\n\nWe can also look at which drivers won races. Added all drivers over 20 wins and 2 others: Sir Stirling Moss, the driver with the most wins without a WDC and Sir Jack Brabham, the legendary driver/team owner that won a WDC and WCC driving his own car (1966). The years in the legend are for the first and last wins.\n\nThe sheer number of Schumacher and Hamilton wins is just breath-taking. Every year from 1992 to 2021, one of them won at least one race, together winning around 36% of all races in those years. The fact that Schumacher\'s last win was in 2006 and Hamilton\'s first was in 2007 makes it look like a passing of the flame. Schumacher\'s 2004 is probably the most impressive start of any driver with 12 wins out of the first 13 races.\n\nThere are many other impressive drivers: Vettel, with his third most wins and the current record for consecutive wins (9! in 2013); Clark, the driver with most wins for 4 years, despite only 2 WDCs; Lauda, with wins across more than a decade. The rivalry between Prost and Senna is also notorious, with both drivers trading wins most years, and fighting for WDCs.\n\nAs with teams, it is not always the case that the driver with most wins is the WDC winner. The most recent example is 2016, where Rosberg won the WDC with a win less, due to better consistency (aka more 2nd places). Reliability was incredibly important also: in 1958, Moss had 4 wins (and a 2nd place) to Hawthorn\'s 1 win (and 5 2nd places), but every other race was a DNF. There are also cases where the WDC was decided by the best N results and not total number of points, e.g., in 1964, both Surtees and G. Hill had 2 wins, Surtees won the WDC with 40 points, despite Hill having scored a total of 41 points, since only 39 counted for the WDC.\n\n### The Complete Mess - Driver & Team Wins\n\nNow for a completely incomprehensible graphic, we can join both the teams and the drivers. I tried to pick colours and shapes that allowed to distinguish both the teams and drivers, but it\'s still quite confusing.\n\nThere isn\'t much new here. We can see Brabham\'s glory year (1966), where he won WDC and WCC as driver and team owner. We can also see Fangio\'s WDCs with 4 teams: Alfa Romeo (1951), Mercedes (1954/55), Ferrari (1956) and Maserati (1957). The different teams Prost won in while Senna mostly won at McLaren. The winning combos of Ferrari+Schumacher and Mercedes+Hamilton.\n\n1: The difference between ""team"" and ""constructor"" is a bit fuzzy, so I\'ll use them interchangeably, despite not being the same thing, for simpleness.\n\n### Extra Plots\n\nI also did a bunch of other, not as interesting, plots that you can find [here](https://imgur.com/a/X1iwA93). It includes similar plots for team with the most points, pole positions, fastest lap. It also includes more general plots like number of unique winning teams in a year (2012 with the record of 7 different teams!) and how consistent are the top teams.\n\nPlease feel free to ask for any plots you would like to see!', 'I think you dont understand tetris!', 'Damn. The Lewis/Merc era was something else‚Ä¶', ""I know, online, many folks say that the teams constructors doesn't matter much, especially for team like Red Bull, but man losing last year's constructors to McLaren must really sting them."", 'Others!

I watched the season a couple of months ago and noticed McLaren could easily have won all of the first seven races, while after that they beat Ferrari in straight fights at Hockenheim, Spa and Monza. The only races where Ferrari looked clearly quicker were Silverstone, Estoril and Jerez.\n\nIf you look at it on a race by race basis, Senna won Phoenix while Ferrari were nowhere. Senna should have won Brazil comfortably but hit Nakajima, handing victory to Prost. Senna broke down while leading very early on at Imola, Berger later took the lead after Boutsen broke down but had no pace and faded away. Senna won Monaco, leading Prost until the Ferrari broke down just before half distance. In Canada, the McLaren was unusually dominant, to the extent that Berger almost made up the entirety of a one-minute penalty on everyone except Senna. Mexico was a race thrown away by race mismanagement on behalf of both Senna and the team; they‚Äôd have probably won with ease if they scheduled a tyre stop, and even if they merely reacted to Prost closing in on them, they‚Äôd have been in the fight. In France, McLaren ran 1-2 but both had slow pit stops, they may have lost out to Prost‚Äôs undercut anyway but they would at worst have been snipping at Prost‚Äôs heels without their pit woes.\n\nThe races not mentioned above are Hungary, Japan and Adelaide. Hungary is tough to assess due to Williams backing up the field. Japan cannot be assessed as three of the four cars were out by lap two, while in Adelaide Senna was miles ahead but crashed seemingly due to mechanical failure. \n\nIf we look at Senna and Prost specifically, there are only three occasions Prost clearly beat or would have beaten Senna in a straight fight, and we could maybe include Mexico and France to make it five if we‚Äôre generous. That seems fairly one-sided in Senna‚Äôs favour and is enough for me to conclude the McLaren was just a little bit better over the course of the season. Bear in mind I haven‚Äôt seen 89, where Senna was apparently frequently quicker than Prost, but depending on what you believe, even that occurred with Senna having an engine advantage.', '1990 - McLaren by a very slim margin, mainly because Ferrari had more mechanical failures. However, Prost was able to fight Senna, because although Ferrari were more unreliable, the failures were unevenly distributed (7 mechanical failures for Mansell vs 3 for Prost). On that basis, I would say Prost‚Äôs Ferrari was slightly better than Senna‚Äôs McLaren, although it‚Äôs probable some of Prost‚Äôs better reliability was down to him being kind on his machinery.\n\n2008 - Ferrari by a medium sized margin.\n\n2010 - Very evenly matched. McLaren were slightly quicker but Ferrari slightly more reliable. If I had to pick one car I would choose the McLaren by a slim margin.\n\n2011 - McLaren pretty comfortably.\n\n2012 - McLaren were obviously far, far quicker, but less reliable and were really poor operationally, especially on Hamilton‚Äôs side of the garage. Hamilton also had bad luck with some things unrelated to the car/team (being taken out in Spa and Brazil). Overall though I would still say McLaren were the better car.']",5,19,0.86,5,19,19,2,4,0.14,2

1j94mlf,What are the chances all the pilots are planning to swear in 2 consecutive races to send a message and try to get banned for a month all together? Who would have more to lose?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j94mlf/what_are_the_chances_all_the_pilots_are_planning/,2025-03-11, Discussion,"I was thinking about it, and given that at stake there's pretty much the freedom of speech in stressful situations, and potentially even more than that, it might be worth it? What would FIA's loss be in case multiple races are canceled for lack of pilots? they would gain for every pilot 120k euros (2 swears), for a total of 2,4m euros for all of them combined

With that though i reckon reserve pilots will just jump on the car so the event will not be canceled, but that won't have the same appeal and thus venues risk of selling less tickets, also i have no idea if all the teams are able to call in 2 pilots
