The PUs get criticised because they are energy starved by design, and there is concern about what that means for the racing. There were and are concerns about cars running out of energy (with many over-the-top scare stories), having unnatural behaviour and energy management being too much of a factor. There are a lot of things that are regulated regarding energy consumption, and drivers will have to pay more attention to energy spending and recovery. Not everyone likes the idea.\n\nThe chassis regulations have to compensate for the lack of energy as one of their main targets, which leads to the active aero implementation. There are theories on how that could be bad for racing (because less drag = less slipstream on the straights, but normal dirty air in the corners) and how it would have been better to have a more solid engine design that allows the chassis side to fully focus on being a good race car.\n\nBecause current ground-effect cars were marketed with the promise of improving racing, some automatically assume that the fact that next year's cars go in a different aero direction again means the FIA gave up on that target, even if the opposite is true. That may further add to it. The size and weight go down, but not nearly enough for some.\n\nI think it the end of the day, every ruleset will have its tricky points and challenges. It doesn't mean it will be bad. There has certainly been a lot of fear mongering based on what might happen, or what some simulation from 3 years ago says might happen.
