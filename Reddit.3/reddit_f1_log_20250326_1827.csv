Hulkenberg completely lost the rear on seemingly normal acceleration on the exit of T3/4, having to save multiple severe oversteer moments that put him into the gravel, damaging his floor and effectively ending his race. Later on in the lap, Bortoleto was in a battle with Bearman, and turned in relatively normally into T8 and instantly lost the rear in a basically unsavable moment that put him into the gravel, taking him out of race contention as well.

If one of these drivers had experienced this alone, it would be easy to put it down to driver error.

From what Ive seen, it seems like Yuki’s driving style is a more ""staccato"" version of of Verstappen. With that being said is Yuki not more well placed to develop into a better teammate?

He’s not retiring early without at least one win. The real question is at what point would he decide to leave Ferrari for a better chance?\n\nBut if Ferrari never delivers and he never does win it, he’ll definitely be one of the best to miss out. And I agree that Ricciardo is on that list as well.', ""after 2024 i dont believe this. he seems like a smart guy, if he went through the pain of 2022, 2023 and still chose to sign again for ferrari (despite knowing hamilton is coming!) im willing to wait and see how it goes for him atleast till the end of 2026. maybe im reading too much into this but his career moves after 2022 have seemed very clearheaded to me.  \n  \nhe has a good manager, and if he leaves the horse house he'll find a new home at a top team. on average he has 7ish years. a fair bit of time i think.""]",0,184,0.44,0,1332,1332,0,1,0.0,0
1jjzjy2,Can someone explain the Lawson Tsunoda drama? Outside of Yuki potentially taking Liams seat. Is there bad blood?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjzjy2/can_someone_explain_the_lawson_tsunoda_drama/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"I've seen all the recent posts about Yuki potentially replacing him in Japan but is there bad blood between them? I've read comments that they have both been talking shit at one point or another?

I know they raced each other in the junior series but I wasn't really following that level too closely.","['They were actually good friends a while back. Red Bull puts their juniors up in the same block of flats in Milton Keynes, so you’d see them on stream together (same with Vips before his gamer moment). \n\nI think a lot of the shit talk is media saying half of a quote to them mixed in with the obvious conflict over both wanting that seat. \n\nTsunoda was asked whether he’s ready to take the seat. He said 100%. Reasonable question, reasonable answer. He was asked if he’d do better than Lawson in the RB21 in China, he said he didn’t drive in it in China so he doesn’t know but he didn’t feel he was too far off Max in his Abu Dhabi test.\n\nLawson was told ‘Yuki is saying he’s ready to take your seat’ and Lawson has hit back saying ‘Well actually I beat him in juniors and F1 so he can say what I want’. Lawson was probably a bit sensitive considering everyone was talking about him coming P20 twice and clearly struggling and the reporters have used the exact thing that would provoke him.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how they go. Gasly and Albon made up after the media played them off against each other in 2019 and 2020 and they weren’t friends before it.', 'From Yuki about 2 weeks ago: \n\n“I wouldn’t say I’m happy for him. Like, that’s kind of a lie. He has done definitely what he should do and, he gave his best. He gave definitely a 100% performance, and, also, I gave 100%. It was in the end up to Red Bull how they’re going to do it.”\n\n“We’re still friends for sure, and we still chat each other, and I like to talk to him. And, yes, since 2020, before that, actually, we had a lot of time that we are teammates, driving in the same categories.”\n\n(via: GPblog)\n\nThey are used to competing with each other and have been rivals for many years. Lawson’s been more defensive in his recent comments about deserving the seat “he’s had his time, now it’s my time” and saying he beat Yuki in the junior series, he has no sympathy for Yuki getting passed over but I think that’s just due to the pressure and him trying to be all like i’m not here to feel bad for others/make friends i’m here to win etc.', ""Both competing for the same competitive seat and a little bit of history from their junior days. No real 'bad blood' per se - also Yuki hasn't really said anything asides from the fact he deserves a crack at the Red Bull seat."", 'Yuki has never talked negatively about Lawson. Lawson recently claimed he was better than Yuki in the junior categories, without looking at the context of the car they had under them.', ""There is no real drama between then. It's all media-manufactured BS like the Norris/Verstappen stuff last year."", 'Nobody’s come to Liam’s defense in the paddock, so he’s made some relatively harmless statements of confidence pointing back to how he’s bested Yuki in the past.\xa0\n\nIt’s a mountain out of a molehill, IMO.\xa0\n\nRB screwed up and put both guys in a bad situation. Hopefully Yuki makes the most of this opportunity.\xa0', 'Doubt theres any bad blood. Just weird fans being weird.', 'Yuki doing his own thing. Got asked if he was ready for redbull, he said 100%. \n\nLawson felt a type of way after he was announced to RB. Nobody texted him congrats besides Ricciardo. After poor performances,  gets bombarded with questions: including what Yuki said and his response to that- he beat Yuki before. I would say the same, you need to be confident in yourself to drive an F1 car. \n\nThere’s no bad blood, just question and answers. The media is just blowing it up as usual.', 'They used to be teammates in the junior categories and I’m sure Redbull gmbh is stirring up drama for the media, because who doesn’t like a bit of drama? I’m sure it’ll look great on the next season of DTS']",0,100,0.39,0,1470,1470,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
