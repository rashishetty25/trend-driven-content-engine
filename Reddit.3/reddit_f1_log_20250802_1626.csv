1mfmqcq,Ferrari: Hamilton reverts and chooses more load compared to Leclerc,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mfmqcq/ferrari_hamilton_reverts_and_chooses_more_load/,2025-08-02, News,,"['""Lewis Hamilton loves big loads"" - The Race', 'Translation\n\n\nYesterday Ferrari dedicated FP1 to a collection of data and analysis of two different setups. Lewis Hamilton took to the track with the SF-25 set with the maximum downforce, then with the rear wing and the beam wing used in Monte Carlo. His teammate instead chose a minor step, focusing on the mid-high-load rear wing of Barcelona and a beam wing with the second unloading element. Charles Leclerc immediately found a good balance and feeling with the car, although the track is not one of his favorites, having to fight only with a bit of oversteer. The increasing grip of the track will certainly help, in addition to the refinements of setup between Friday and Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe choice was also confirmed in the second free practice session, with Lewis Hamilton converting to that of choice. Waxing and beam wing therefore for the seven-time world champion, who, however, did not find the same answers as the Monegasque. In the fast lap he paid a not indifferent gap. On the long run, carried out with the Soft (Leclerc with the average) he had a good pace and even a fair amount of consistency, but via radio he complained a lot about “the balance is dangerous”, he told his track engineer, Riccardo Adami. Looking at the onboards, beyond the times, we saw an SF-25 more nervous for him and that from understeer to center-curved – mainly the wide-ranging slow curves – turned into violent snaps of the outgoing rear. “We’re a long way from being on the tracks,” Hamilton said at the end of the day. “Charles is fast, but I’m not and I don’t have a good balance yet.”\n\n\n\nAfter and during the FP1 the Englishman complained of lack of front load, with the car felt by the Englishman too understeer. For the second session of Friday, therefore, he had tried to align the choices between the two drivers with the grade 4 wing, a little more discharge, but which did not greatly improve the driving feeling of the Englishman. From the images collected by the pit-lane this morning the car number 44 is inside the garages with the maximum load configuration, which would suggest that the evening briefing has led the Ferrari technicians to take a step back and go back to a more loaded setup the number 44. So, except for last-minute trim changes, Hamilton will return to the track with the most loaded setup in the FP3, which could also help him in case of rain on Sunday.

In 2023, I recall how McLaren had a significant jump in performance mid-season, going from a midfield team to a consistent podium contender.

I’m curious if Ferrari, Mercedes, or Red Bull seem to have that in the cards this year, as it appeared that even McLaren in 2023 was not expecting the significant jump, which has also evolved into their dominance this year. I’m also cognizant that the regulation changes may mean that there is just less performance to get out of the car in 2025, than there was in ‘22 or ‘23.

Wondering if anyone else can point to other instances of this in F1 history, and share their own predictions for the rest of the season…","['Brawn went from completely dominant and untouchable to 3rd quickest by the end\n\nJordan in 98 went from a point less slow team to one of the quickest mid season', 'mclaren is certainly one of the biggest ones in modern history, if not the biggest.

1) Volunteer race stewards vs. full season paid stewards, plus conflict of interest rules

2) Driver and TP verbal conduct during events (AKA Swearing rules)

3) Driving standards and penalties

4) The Superlicense system

5) Guidance for Race Directors - Safety, TV timeslot structure, etc

I'd change the stupid rule that you can't get points from two series in a year if the second one starts before the other one ends, but you can get points from two if they don't overlap like that. That seems completely arbitrary and pointless. Either get points from one series a year or two, but none of that nonsense. \n\nI'd make IndyCar worth some more points for places below 1st. I'd make F1 Academy match the other F4 series in points, rather than be lower than them, and I'd try to pressure them to use the same car as most other F4 series rather than a design based on asthetics- I know that's the FOM's fault, not the FIA, but I'd give it a try.\n\nBut the absolute main problem with the super license system is that the teams within the feeder series aren't remotely even. They are much less even than IndyCar, for reference. It's very clear that the best F3 team is Trident, and the best F2 team is Invicta.

It's more common than you think."", ""It makes sense. Every event (even if same track) is different. Track isn't rubbered in, tire compounds change (year to year), changes in car suspension, different aero loads,  etc. This is exactly why there are practice sessions - so that drivers can explore the limits. FP1 is not about setting the fastest or cleanest laps. \n\nT1 has good run off w/o hazards (so very little risk going off) it is a heavy braking zone and pretty much every driver starts their run on the pit straight.
