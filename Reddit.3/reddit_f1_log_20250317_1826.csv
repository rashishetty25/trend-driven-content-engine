I know it’s busy, pls don’t crucify me. I think that time interval and tire strategy are two parts of the same story, so I added a tire progress bar lol. I also added number of laps on the current tire, and changed the time to green if within 1 second of the driver ahead (as suggested in the comments of my last post). 


Pic 2:

For the “it’s too cluttered imo” folks, I removed the progress bar and just added each driver’s previous tires as little dots :) Tbh I prefer it to pic 1. 

Would love any other suggestions of ways to depict both past tires and tire life (ideally without cluttering it all up). 


Pic 3: 

Bonus update to my sector times post. Changed the sectors to vertical bars which pop out like the pit square. I muuuch prefer this to my original one, so thanks for all the suggestions and discussion. 

I also switched back to the original purple color. Long live purple, down with usurple. #fuckusurple #allmyhomieshateusurple



Loved all the comments and feedback in the last post, so would welcome more of the same. Haha even if it’s just to say you bloody hate it.  

I’m also finding the process of jamming a bunch of information into the timing tower somehow cathartic, so if you have other suggestions for stuff you wanna see on the fly (e.g. DRS activation, battery level), please comment.

Now that the dust has settled in Melbourne, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post-race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyze the results.

Low-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks","['The most curious thing for me was how similar to the end of the past season everything was, in terms of performance. McLaren being the much faster car when the tires drop, Max being able to hang in there at the beginning until that point, Ferrari apparently compromising their setup, Mercedes being a sort of unremarkable good team... it seems like things only shook up a little at the back of the grid (mostly Haas...).\n\nObviously this is the first race and we should see teams making leaps as they adjust to new packages and all that, but it was weirdly underwhelming despite a very eventful race.', 'Felt bad for Yuki. He did everything right and was going to score good points then the team completely screwed up the strategy and pit stops.  Same with Ferrari. I get what they were trying to do, but it was the complete wrong call. \n\nFrom the looks of it with all the rookies and veterans, we might be seeing a lot of solo teams in the points. Last year it was always two RB, two Mercedes, two Ferrari, two McLaren in some order. Now, two McLaren, two Ferrari and a bunch of one offs.  Should be pretty fun.', 'Saturday evening we were told Ferrari intentionally went for a wet weather set up which impacted quali performance. That doesn’t explain why Charles done basically the same lap time on 7 lap old softs in Q2 and new softs in Q3… same issues as last season? \n\nOn race day with both cars in clean air Leclerc was 1-1.5 seconds a lap slower than Norris. It’s been years now and Ferrari don’t seem to know why they suck so bad when it rains. Wet or dry set up it doesn’t matter.\n\nThe strategy blunder took me back to 2022 and making wrong decisions when a race gets chaotic. Poor communication over the radio, especially to Lewis and he got a ‘Welcome to Ferrari’ experience. \n\nI do think Ferrari have more performance to unlock. Will it be in China? Very unlikely considering turns 1-4 sequence were a big weakness last season. Weather forecast looks stable. I think McLaren will be 30 seconds down the road with Max, George and the two Ferrari’s behind. \n\n\nOn a side note I was so disappointed with the F1 timing app on race day. Huge lag spikes causing it to run out of sequence with the race, ruined my usual set up of watching and tracking sector times.', 'I keep being amazed how McLaren is able be very fast while keeping their tyres cool enough. On the other side they seem to have the ability to warmup their tyres faster than any other team. Would love to know their trick and why no other team seem to be able to do so this far in the current regulations.', 'That race was like a crucible for Norris. Every weakness he had displayed in previous seasons was thrown at him and he overcame every single one. \n\n* Held P1 at the start\n* learned to shut the door on Max\n* managed conditions changing\n* made the right calls\n* pitted for inters (!!) \n* had a proper dialogue with his race engineer, asked questions and asked A LOT\n* managed restarts without losing positions\n* recovered from a mistake\n* managed pressure from behind\n\nI was impressed. \n\nThe speed of the McLaren is something else though, it was already decent in the rain but then the period of slick running was ominous. Norris pulled away from both Piastri and Verstappen on a drier track which suggests the gap would have been much bigger in a dry race.\n\nPiastri had a good race until he had to chase down Norris. At that point he pushed far too hard and the mistakes started to come. He put a tyre in the gravel and could have ended up in the same situation as Alonso. Being too eager to get back out in front of Max meant he took far too much speed back into the track and ended up in the grass. It was a bad day for him. \n\nMax will always be a menace even though he himself didn’t have the best of races making rare mistakes in the rain. Sliding around on slicks after making the call to stay out and gamble was quite the move. He nearly ended up binning it in the pit lane. \n\nFerrari…what can be said about Ferrari that hasn’t already been said. The communication is dire and they seem incapable of learning from their mistakes. Rain strategy is a Ferrari weak point but this time they had Hamilton there for advice and they didn’t want it. The car did not look good and the pace that had been seen on Friday never materialised. Shanghai is next and they weren’t very good there either last year. Ferrari have problems and I don’t think Lewis Hamilton will be able to fix it. \n\nShout out to Albon and Tsunoda, one of which had the perfect strategy and the other whose race was wrecked by bad strategy. Yuki did everything correctly this weekend but his team screwed him. \n\nAntonelli was also very impressive. Coming back from P16 to P4 in his first race although granted he was massively out of position for the car he had. But he did an excellent job at managing his race pace.', ""Haas probably would have had a double points finish if they didn't second guess themselves when the commentators were roasting them for putting new inters on during the safety car when everyone else went on slicks.\n\nThe part that bothered me is that no matter what the conditions were, Haas would be the slowest car no matter what when doing the same thing as everyone else. They should have had the mentality to live and die by the sword.\n\nI dont think it's fair to hold it against the 4 teams who didn't make the quick decision to pit right away like Lando, the Mercs, Albon, Stroll, and Hulkenberg did because *that* decision was not super obvious, but I think Haas second guessing their initial decision before was particularly egregious. If you're last, you're last. I'd rather finish last by taking a swing at something that can *maybe* work even if rather unlikely, than getting there through self-fulfilling prophecy."", 'I don’t know very much about race direction or how to run a track or what it’s like to be a marshal, and I definitely don’t mean any disrespect toward any of these roles, but I can’t help but feel that the overall management of the weekend was average. It wasn’t just in F1, either. I noticed that the response time for incidents, getting recovery vehicles out, clearing the track, etc. was slow during the other Formula series and the Supercars events as well. Marshals seemed almost lackadaisical at times, standing around or moving slowly, like they weren’t sure what they were supposed to be doing. I can only assume this is some sort of leadership issue since it was happening across the whole weekend. Maybe the people calling the shots didn’t know what they were doing, or communication between areas wasn’t great, or it was particularly difficult to manage getting recovery vehicles onto the circuit due to its layout. I have no idea, so I’m just speculating. It would be great to hear some insight if anyone has any experience working Albert Park.\n\nOverall, I’m appreciative as we all should be to the people who work up to and over the course of the weekend to make the GP happen, but it feels like at times slow decision making delayed us from being able to get back to racing as early as we should have, and that’s never a good thing.', ""A couple of Fun Facts I thought I'd share.\n\n- This is now the fifth consecutive Australian GP to have a different winner than the prior edition. All five winners also recorded their Maiden Australian GP victory.\n\n- As of yesterday, Lewis Hamilton has not won an Australian GP in 10 years.\n\n- This is McLaren's first Australian GP victory since 2012, and once again gives them the record for most Australian Grands Prix victories at 12 (Previously tied with Scuderia Ferrari at 11 each)"", 'Racing bulls made an  unfortunate gamble for Yuki he was driving very well', ""Interesting to hear James Vowles' comment about Sainz sitting on the pit wall saying there is no way the Ferraris are going to stay on track with the hard tyres and telling the pitwall the exact lap to pit Albon.\n\nIt shows just how much the drivers are (usually) the experts in knowing when to change tyres if they are given the right info about the weather.  It's not often we have a driver actually on the pitwall calling out the exact lap to change.  Maybe engineers generally should concede to drivers when there is doubt about going from dry to wet and vice versa: unless of course Sainz is an outlier in being more expert than most drivers in that knowledge...""]",32,216,0.89,32,212,212,3,11,0.010000000000000009,3

1jdbu2n,Speculation:  Did lack of institutional memory contribute to Haas' struggles in Melbourne?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jdbu2n/speculation_did_lack_of_institutional_memory/,2025-03-17, Discussion,"OK first of all, definition

Institutional memory is the collective experience of all the personnel in an organization to handle a given situation.  It's the biggest thing you lose when experienced personnel head for greener pastures and their replacements have to do their learning the hard way, with little in the way of mentorship.

Awkward and unsatisfactory outcomes in the short term are usually the consequence of losing your institutional memory.

With that said, here's what we know.

Haas is rolling around not just with 2 brand new drivers, but also 2 brand new race engineers.  Gary Gannon and Mark Slade are both gone, replaced by new voices that weren't on the F1 grid last year.

Furthermore, many of the technical people, including technical chief Andrea de Zordo, have only 1 year of experience as Komatsu purged the team of Steiner's people.

I suspect one of the big reasons that Haas came out so flat, and by ""flat"" I mean the lack of pace that was a problem for Haas even without the rain, is because they have very little actual F1 experience anywhere in their squad right now.  This culminated in delays and isses with putting the right adjustments into the car as everyone struggles to communicate with everyone else and a lot of people are just kinda trying to figure things out on the fly that an experienced person would simply know what to say, or what to do.  The result is chaos.

Last year you at least had longtime veterans dotting the roster, especially Slade, Nico and Kevin who all had many years of experience in the league.  And if, say, Gannon's side of the paddock had issues and he had to reach beyond his own experience to address a problem, Mark was right there to ask.  R

ight now the only experienced person anywhere in their front of house at Haas is Esteban, who was on a different team last year.  With everyone all figuring it out together, there's no one to really lean on when one side of the paddock or the other is struggling to crack a tough problem.

That strikes me as a situation where getting a reliable setup for their cars is going to be extra tricky because you just don't have that longstanding experience to fall back on if the first attempt doesn't work.

Like if a driver isn't happy with a given setup, you need engineers who can think 2-3 adjustments ahead in order to figure out what can be quickly tried to get them back on the track with a better setup than they had before, and I'm not sure the Haas team has that right now.

Throw in the fact that Bearman is a rookie and Ocon isn't a native English speaker, with the attending problems in providing reliable feedback in the first place, and you have a perfect storm of ""learning curve issues"" with communication, feedback and adjustments that could easily hold a team back.

The good news is that these may not be experienced people, but they are talented people who should climb the learning curve relatively quickly.  Unfortunately for many of them, ""relatively quickly"" in this sport can be measured in seasons, not races.  By throwing so many inexperienced personnel into the deep end at once I think Haas may be in a situation where they're forced to use this year as a pure shakedown and focus almost exclusively on 2026, which is a pity for those of us who hoped for bigger things..","[""It definitely can't have helped. Getting both two new drivers and two new race engineers is a lot. Especially when 3 out of the 4 are essentially rookies in their field.\n\nBut Haas are also just tied to Ferrari development. When Ferrari aren't strong, like they don't seem to be now, Haas are always down as well."", 'Listening to the pit wall conversation with Ocon on him pushing to go back to slicks was frustrating. The wall needed to take charge (because they have a weather radar in front of them) rather than Ocon in that situation.\n\nI’m sure it will work itself out in due time, but it’s better to find and identify the issues now than after 16 races', ""I'm sure someone will compile the laptime comparison charts and show how much laptime improvements each team has gained after we have had a couple of dry races. But my initial impression is that Haas has simply missed the boat and especially VCARB and Williams have gained even more relatively vs the top 4 teams let alone vs Haas and Alpine. In quali there were 17 cars within 1 sec from each other at some point, and that's almost unheard of in F1 history...\n\nCan't really blame it on the drivers though. Ollie had 6 (FP) weekends/races with the team last year, so he knows exactly how the current car compares to the previous one, including setups quirks. Ocon is a veteran nowadays and is at least or even more fluent in English than the likes of Barichello, Kimi and Massa who were known to give good feed back and were credited by drivers/TPs of developing the car or making setups."", "">Furthermore, many of the technical people, including technical chief Andrea de Zordo, have only 1 year of experience as Komatsu purged the team of Steiner's people.\n\nI thought this was odd last year when people were praising Komatsu for the performance of a car designed & built by Gunther's people in the offseason. 2023's was already fast over one lap but terrible in the race, 2024 managed to build upon that and fix some of the race pace issues. \n\nOne race isn't season defining, but so far it feels like a step back."", ""Great assessment. I wasn't aware that Ayao got rid of so many veterans in the team--didn't he actually say in an interview or something that he wanted to promote people in-house, especially those who stayed loyal with Haas for all these years? And he didn't want look outside the team?"", 'Very well thought out post and it’s a very good point.\xa0', ""Haas isn't really incentivized to do much this year. With so much change and a new rule book next year, they might as well throw it all into Next Year's Car^(TM)."", 'All very good points, but Ocon should very much be counted as veteran and should be able to give good feedback. His language skills are as far as I can judge it on par with many of the other non-english on the grid.\n\nAlso the Ferrari parts on the Haas should be factored in. Your point makes this even stronger as they probably rely even stronger on Ferrari experience.', ""They're hanging on just waiting for the Toyota buyout.""]",24,31,0.67,24,28,28,2,3,-0.010000000000000009,2

1jcut88,Why was it that Piastri had to be in the reverse gear for the car to get going.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jcut88/why_was_it_that_piastri_had_to_be_in_the_reverse/,2025-03-16, Technical,"Under normal circumstances where it’s not raining, I suppose it’d be easier to get the car back on track after running into the grass ? 

I also noticed that he tried the forward gear multiple times but to no avail, before switching to the reverse gear. Only then was he able to get the car moving. What’s the reasoning behind this? 

Thanks! :) 


","[""Everyone else here is bringing up some OK points, but missing something really obvious that is probably the biggest factor in why reverse worked best.\n\nThe front of the floor is closer to the ground than the rear.
