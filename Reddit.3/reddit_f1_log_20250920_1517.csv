Is there a reason why they couldn't put a decent size RGB led indicator into the halo, so the driver you see it in their line of sight? TV showed the indicator on the steering wheel and it is tiny. Some of the track indicators seem to be in run off areas, while the driver would be looking at the corner, i.e. where they want to aim.

Race control would control the indicator and track position could be used to determine if it applies to that sector. Could also be used for blue flags etc. in the race.

Is this a stupid idea? ","['Steering wheel might be tiny from onboard camera but it is literally in front of driver’s eyes.

Which makes it easier to process, filter out, etc. You can use a dynamic mic or just any mic with lower sensitivity to ensure it picks up less of the outside noise, then all you have to do is just put it closer to your mic.\n\nWith a good mic, you should be able to literally touch it with your lips without it making the sound worse. If anything, it should be making it better. There's a reason a lot of podcasters almost eat the microphone.\n\nYou've correctly identified there's a problem, but not what that problem is.
