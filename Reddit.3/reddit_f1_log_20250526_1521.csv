1kv5ujm,Something’s off between Hamilton and Adami – how long can this go on?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kv5ujm/somethings_off_between_hamilton_and_adami_how/,2025-05-25, Discussion,"There has been tension between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer Riccardo Adami since he joined Ferrari, and the Monaco GP seems to have brought it to the surface again.

**Let’s rewind.**  
In qualifying, Adami told Hamilton that Verstappen was *“on a push lap,”* then immediately said he was *“slowing down.”* In reality, Verstappen *was* pushing. Hamilton ended up impeding him and received a three-place grid drop.

**During the race (Lap 76 of 78):**  
Hamilton asked:

>“Are they still ahead by a minute?”  
Adami replied:  
“Charles on medium, McLaren on hard. Lapping ‘16 very close to each other fighting.”  
Hamilton responded:  
“You’re not answering the question. It doesn’t really matter I guess. I’m just asking if I’m a minute behind or?”  
Adami then clarified:  
“It’s 48 seconds.”

**Post-race:**  
Hamilton asked quietly:

>“Are you upset with me or something?”   
No response.

**Context matters.**  
This isn’t the first awkward moment between the two. In Melbourne, Hamilton told Adami *“leave it to me”* when he received repeated reminders about engine modes. In Miami, he criticised the team for delayed team orders with the sarcastic, *“Have a tea break while you’re at it.”*

Hamilton has said publicly that there’s no issue and that these are normal race situations. But with repeated miscommunications and visible frustration, questions are beginning to surface.

Is this a case of two people still learning to work together, or is there a deeper mismatch in communication styles? Could Ferrari’s overall decision-making be contributing to the problem? Is it time for a change, or does this just need more time?

Curious to hear what others think.","[""Lewis's radio was painful all day long. Idk what was wrong with Adami today but he was even more awkward than usual. It was like listening to the Vettel days with him."", 'Look at vettel and Adami(he ordered Ricky sometimes instead of other way around), Carlos and Adami(las Vegas 2024) the miscommunication has been eternal at that position.\n\nEDIT:  \n""Wake up guys, come on!""  \n""Tell it to him in Spanish""  \n""What are these two guys doing?

Sainz: ""Make up your mind, guys!"" (silverstone 22)  \n\xa0""No, not inters! I told you, straight to slicks!""

His response was pretty telling:\n\n> “The information wasn’t exactly that clear. I didn’t really understand ‘this is our race.’ I didn’t know what I was fighting for… I used up my tires a lot in that moment, but I was so far away from \\[the cars ahead\\] anyway.”\n\nThis lines up with the broader pattern from Monaco and earlier races; unclear communication, vague timing, and a lack of shared understanding on what the actual goal is.\n\nIt’s not just about tone or chemistry between driver and engineer. If Hamilton is burning through tyres without knowing who he’s racing, that suggests something deeper: a breakdown in how strategy is communicated and understood in real-time. Especially when it’s happening race after race."", ""They might replace Adami at some point but for me this is all a symptom of something bigger, Ferrari has been utterly dysfunctional for so long that they don't even look at themselves and question what they're doing here.

The draw is always qualifying."", 'The one thing I did like about the race was the Birds Eye view drone shot. That was actually really cool and I hope they do that type of shot in more races. That’s how they should use drones if they do plan on using it more\n\nBut I still think they should either scrap or rotate Monaco with Spa since they’ve already confirmed that’s a thing. Fundamentally cars can’t overtake here and mandating more pit stops won’t fix it. The only stakeholders who like are the sponsors, winner of the race, organisers of the race and the VIPs who attend\n\nEveryone knows it’s garbage for racing. Don’t forget this is a race with a significantly shorter total distance than that’s required as well.

This was because of the pit stop rule and how there was always someone trying to undercut, overcut or hold up someone.\xa0 Speaking of, unlike many I wanst offended by all the shenanigans of cars holding each other up. On the contrary it was a fun aspect of the race that you never usually see.\xa0\n\nThere was also a smidgen of collision drama and on a few ocassions I was sure that we were getting a safety car.\xa0\n\nAnd I loved Verstappen’s holding up of Norris and the top three all closing up beside each other in the last 15-20 laps. Yes Leclerc didnt make a move but the fact he was close enough to capitalise on any mistakes was super tense and exciting in my eyes.\xa0\n\nI also loved how some of the usual front runners like Mercedes were nowhere and instead we had the likes of Hadjar having the best F1 result of his life.\xa0\n\nIve said it before, do I want to see 24 races like this a year? No defo not. Do I like seeing it once a year? Absolutely.\xa0\n\nIm not saying you had to enjoy it. I understand why you didn’t.

I do think more experimentation is required to actually produce an exciting race, and I hope the sport's management is willing to keep trying new things. There has to be a way to make Monaco worthwhile in the modern age"", 'Listening to the F1 nation podcast they mentioned there were 4 proposals by the SAC last December (I could have the exact month wrong) on changes for Monaco. Teams voted and picked the mandatory 2-stop option. So, teams only have themselves to blame if they are unhappy with how it turned out. Also, I’m curious if there is any way to read what the other 3 proposals were. \n\nAnd for all the criticism of how things turned out I’m not sure the regular 1-stop would have altered the results much at all. It’s clear drivers can create any kind of gap they want at any point and aren’t at risk of getting passed. Doesn’t seem like the number of stops will change any of that. \n\nThere is a universe where with a safety car or red flag this regulation makes a big difference but red flags and safety cars can be just as gimmicky and random at any race. \n\nEveryone just needs to accept Monaco is about Saturday. And it’s clear the vast majority of people around F1 have no desire to eliminate it from the calendar.

The top 8 then enter a knockout style qualifying tournament: 1st from Q2 against 8th, 2nd v 7th etc. One lap each, winner progresses to semi final. We‘ll have semi finals, a final and 3rd place playoff to determine the top 4 and equally with the losers from the quarter finals we‘ll have that for P5-8.

The ""typical"" greats are often drivers from different areas so it is really hard to compare them equally and not only did the quality of cars in general improved massively but also technical differences like stick-shift to automatic, engines etc. 

Without mentioning any names, what are the attributes a driver needs to have to be your number one or top 5 etc.? 

  
For me it is the circumstances a driver gets and what he makes out of it. There are drivers who have multiple championships with multiple cars and there are drivers who sit in one nearly perfect car and win, but mostly very close of their teammate. 

And currently my view on another driver shifts, because I thought he has the best car, but it seems that either he is an unbelievable driver or no one can use the car, but him. ","['Mostly vibes, and when someone comes with good arguments for another driver, I use my emotional arguments to justify my personal bests.', 'I don’t.

It wasn't interesting to watch and somehow made Monaco even more boring to watch.

But what if drivers had to keep to a minimum lap time throughout each lap? Governed by some metric, which I'm sure wouldn't be too difficult to work out and enforce (drivers would have a delta to follow), which would eradicate this backing up nonsense. Monaco isn't going anywhere. It's too steeped in history and has far too much significance with Formula 1, so I do think it's a good idea to mandate some interesting rules to help improve the racing, even though on-track overtaking is at a minimum/non-existent.

Would there be a reason this couldn't realistically work?

1kvon1d,Is Antonelli performing beneath expectations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvon1d/is_antonelli_performing_beneath_expectations/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"This post might bring controversy, but I think young Kimi is performing slightly worse than expected, further overshadowed by all the praise about Hadjar recently. So far he has less than half the points of GR, 0-10 vs GR in race/sprint h2h, and 2-8 in qualifying h2h.

GR is great, and honestly I don’t think race pace, mistakes, (like losing the lead at the sprint) or even crashes are worrying, but it’s the raw pace that he has yet to show. In my understanding, speed is mostly not taught, and most great drivers become competitive in qualifying just about immediately. I think it is slightly concerning that Kimi has mostly struggled with qualifying thus far other than in Miami.

Can anyone who has followed him through his junior career give some input on how we should view his performance thus far?

Edit: after reading some responses, I admit it’s my expectations of him being a generational talent that are too high and not fair. Hopefully he will get plenty of lease at Merc to develop!","[""He's doing fine. 1 crash at Monaco Q1 and a spin in terrible conditions at Melbourne \n\nA pole and top 3 qualifying at miami.
