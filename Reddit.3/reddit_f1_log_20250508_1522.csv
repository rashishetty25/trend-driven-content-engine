They've all dominated in feeder series like F2/F3 or even Formula E, but stepping into an F1 car is a whole different beast. Everything is on another level. They're suddenly racing against seasoned pros who've been honing their craft for years.

And the problem is, these rookies often aren't given much breathing room to actually learn and develop. If they don't deliver stellar results almost immediately, the knives start coming out. Teams are under immense pressure to perform, and unfortunately, young drivers can be seen as the easiest variable to change if things aren't going to plan.

It's a pretty cutthroat environment. One bad race, or even a couple of slightly off performances, and suddenly their seat is under threat. Where's the time for them to really understand the nuances of the car, figure out their driving style in this new machinery, and build confidence? It feels like they're constantly under the microscope, judged on every single lap.

You see flashes of brilliance, for sure. A stunning qualifying lap here, a gutsy overtake there. But consistency, the hallmark of a top F1 driver, takes time and experience. Maybe we need to rethink how we integrate these young talents, give them a longer leash, and acknowledge that becoming an F1 star isn't an overnight thing. It's a tough gig, and expecting instant perfection might just be setting them up for failure.","['Except not all rookies straight up dominate f3 or f2\n\nIf you are talking about Doohan, he didnt win neither f3 or f2, despite having multiple shots.\n\nAnd if he is unlucky, then what can Pourchaire, Drugo say? They did actually win f2 beating Doohan himself, yet they never drove one race in f1. Isnt that even worse?\n\nAlso Doohan is the first rookie that didnt get the time in the last couple years. Mazepin got a full year, Mick got two, Logan got one year and a half, Zhou got 3 seasons. Lawson himself with all the shitfest around him is still in f1 and will have quite a solid amount of races in his palmares at the end of the year\n\nThe grid being this close at the tail end means you cant afford having a Logan Sargeant that is miles off his teammate, cause even a couple points might be one or two wcc positions at the end of the year.

He actually had more hours in F1 cars than guys like Hadjar, who are already way faster than he is. Doohan had one overtake this year (over Bortoleto on a last lap). Bearman had nearly 10 overtakes in one race, in a similar performing car. \n\nEveryone is saying how unfair it is that Alpine doesn't sacrifice their season and finish near-last in order to give Doohan more time to develop. But no one is saying that their team should go out and sign Doohan now. Because everyone knows that he isn't that good. They just want to bash Alpine because the team is a mess and they think its unfair that an F1 team doesn't stick with a rookie that has one overtake and three crashes in six races."", 'The main problem I see is that the teams with the worst track record, are the teams taking on the rookies.\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine if Piastri, a potential world champion, had ended up at Alpine.

The Silver Arrows have been significantly more competitive in the first six races of the season than last year. With four podium finishes for George Russell, the haul is impressive. Only the significant gap to market leader McLaren somewhat dampens the record.\n\n> But that\'s about to change. At the first six overseas Grands Prix, the engineers held back on upgrades. At the European season opener in Imola, Mercedes also wants to fully launch the development race. But that doesn\'t mean nothing has happened at the first races of the year.\n\n> ""We\'ve already made a few upgrades. They weren\'t particularly big or sexy, but there were always new things coming in,"" reveals technical director James Allison. The fact that Mercedes hasn\'t been mentioned much in the FIA\'s upgrade lists so far is also due to the calendar. ""We\'re already a quarter of the way through the season. The teams have been faced with many races in a row. It\'s quite difficult to make upgrades to the car when the races are flying around you like that.""\n\n> **Improvement with Imola upgrade?**\nBut that\'s about to change. After Miami, the engineers will have a two-week break to catch their breath. The European season opener traditionally also marks the start of the major development race. It\'s expected that most teams have something bigger planned for Imola. According to Allison, that\'s also the case with Mercedes.\n\n> ""In the next races, we\'ll be bringing new parts that are more visible from the outside. With a bit of luck, they should be able to improve our results."" The AMG W16 showed its strengths in the first few races, especially in qualifying. Over the race distance, however, the drivers struggled to maintain their good starting positions. McLaren, Red Bull, and Ferrari seem to be taking better care of their tires.\n\n> Allison is confident that Mercedes can improve in this area with the new parts: ""Hopefully, the upgrades we bring in the next two or three races will swing the pendulum a bit in our direction. We\'ll continue to try to work on tire temperatures in the race. That should help with the results as well.""\n\n> **New parts for Imola, Barcelona and Montreal.**\nThe second triple-header of the season, Imola, Monaco, and Barcelona, \u200b\u200bis now on the schedule. Allison doesn\'t believe the picture will change much compared to the first few races: ""We\'ve always been strong in qualifying so far, so we can expect to continue putting the car near the front of the grid. With a bit of luck, we\'ll even be a bit stronger here with the upgrades.""\n\n> However, the engineers\' focus is on improving race pace: ""We have to make sure that we can deliver on Sunday what we promise on Saturday. The most important thing is to control the temperatures in the tires and ensure that the car can show the pace it is capable of.""\n\n> However, further development is far from halted after the triple-header. Team boss Toto Wolff reveals: ""We have something planned for Imola, Barcelona, \u200b\u200band even Montreal."" Whether they can still catch up with McLaren is questionable, however.

I know at some stage there was a rule about using Q2 tyres for the race (can‚Äôt remember if it was the actual used quali tyres or just the same compound.) Would it make for better racing if they had to use the softer tyres during the race not just for quali?

Max is meaningfully alongside for entry, mid-corner and exit, but because Piastri ""won"" it by being on the inside, he can just shepherd Max off. If Max was truly carrying too much speed, and was given a car\'s space, we\'d have found that out anyway because he would have missed the corner anyway. However, we don\'t even really get that - ""no more track for you"" is legal. I feel like a lot of fans feel that it\'s cathartic that it happened to Max and are happy that a new driver is beating him and... well, I get it. He also did straight-line a corner, and that\'s what the penalty was really for. However, it doesn\'t mean we should just forget what we\'re seeing here.\n\nLet\'s get even more spicy. Liam Lawson and Alonso in the Sprint. Alonso is *entitled* to go so wide that Liam is run all the way off the road. The rules *make* that the case. How is it fair racing, though? And look how it ends? Is every single corner a competition of efficiently working out that you\'re allowed to run someone off and doing it now?\n\nWell, Max did it to Lando *again* at Miami - he\'s just allowed to tell Lando ""no more track for you"" even though he\'s meaningfully alongside. This one doesn\'t end in disaster, but how is *any of this* normal? How is any of this the racing this sport has been known for? Did ""all of the time you have to leave a space"" not become a viral meme for over a decade? Where did this sentiment go?\n\nI think it\'s awful racing no matter who\'s guilty. Max is by far the most guilty, but Oscar has learned hard and is just going to do it as much over and over all season now because he\'s being rewarded for it. Racing will continue to be about how you can legally push someone off. And looking at fan sentiment nowadays - it seems like we\'re all okay with this now? This is just the new normal?\n\nGet me off this train. I\'ve been watching for 20 years and no other series in the world allows what we\'re seeing now. The stewards are quite consistent - consistent with a ruleset that seems incompatible with basic racing courtesy. Is there a defense for this that doesn\'t appeal to the rules?']",5,75,0.65,5,71,71,-1,4,-0.039999999999999925,-1
