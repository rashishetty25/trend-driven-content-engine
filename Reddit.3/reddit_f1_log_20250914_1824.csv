1ng8aln,[OC] F1 Media Driver Ratings for the 2025 Italian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ng8aln/oc_f1_media_driver_ratings_for_the_2025_italian/,2025-09-13, Discussion,"Here’s how major F1 media outlets have rated drivers throughout the season so far, up to the 2025 Italian Grand Prix, vs their current championship standings. Do you think these ratings reflect true performance on track, or is there bias creeping in? 

A couple notes:

•⁠ ⁠Cumulative season ratings are calculated by averaging each outlet’s scores across all races.

•⁠ The last column compares the average rating position vs the championship standing (or the race result in the second table).

•⁠ ⁠Average finishing position excludes DNF, DNS, and DSQs.

•⁠ ⁠For ""P1 w/ Matt & Tommy"", the values are the average of Matt & Tommy’s individual scores.

They have track cameras, CCTV, telemetry.\n\nI have a hard time believing that the camera angles introduced by Williams actually showed a new aspect. My understanding of the right of review process was that there is a very high bar to a new and significant element, and that it is not supposed to be about changing the judgment of existing facts. it seems like they took it as an opportunity here to change their judgment of existing facts.\n\nIf they are of the opinion that their decision now is the correct way of judging it, i see no reason why they didn't come to this conclusion at the time.
