There was a two-week enforced holiday, as required by Formula 1 regulations. The premier class of motorsport returns to Zandvoort this weekend, which is why operations in Milton Keynes have resumed in recent days.\n\nNew team boss Laurent Mekies in particular has had a busy few days, as the Frenchman wanted to make the most of the time. ‘He has familiarised himself with the team, looked at the structures and staff,’ reveals motorsport boss Helmut Marko. Hardly a stone was left unturned after Christian Horner's dismissal. ‘In the medium term, we are working on a kind of decentralisation. The individual departments will have their own boss, who will then report to Laurent on the whole.’\n\nThe focus of the RB team boss will be on racing, although he will continue to have overall responsibility. Nevertheless, the individual roles of the department heads at Red Bull changed after Horner's dismissal. ‘The RB17 project is headed by Rob Gray, for example, and the engine department by Ben Hodgkinson. They were given a little more responsibility for their areas. This allows Mekies to concentrate more on the racing team. There has already been progress because he is simply an excellent engineer.’\n\nRejection of Alex Palou\nThere has been no progress on the driver market yet. By the end of October, those responsible want to make a decision on who will sit alongside Max Verstappen in the number one team and what the Racing Bulls duo will be called next year.

The world championships are out of reach, so the goal for the rest of the season is clear: ‘We want to finish as far ahead as possible, but it's hard to say whether victories are possible.’ Cadillac is likely to take a similar approach for its entry next year. According to Marko, the US manufacturer has ‘chosen the conservative route’ with Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez. ‘You know what you've got.’ The Graz native has praise for his former driver from Mexico. ‘I spoke to him on the phone and he's motivated. If he's motivated and the car is right, then he'll certainly be back to the level he once was.’\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)"", 'Saying there are no negotiations with Palou is so funny because the original article suggested nothing of the sort.', ""I'm not sure why anyone thought this was a serious possibility"", 'Palou is Spanish not American', 'Obligatory Fuck Helmut Marko, all my homies hate Helmut Marko', 'Hear me out...

1n2eblr,[OC] A visualisation of driver turnover for every team since their last major ownership change,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n2eblr/oc_a_visualisation_of_driver_turnover_for_every/,2025-08-28, Discussion,"Even though this year’s silly season may be very quiet, I wanted to see the movement of drivers between teams and how true certain stereotypes are (looking at Red Bull and RB changing drivers like they are trading cards). Which team do you think has handled driver changes the best (or worst) in recent years?  


A few quick notes and takeaways:

* The decision for the cutoff point being each team’s last major ownership change was because (at least in theory) the ownership would have some decision making power and thus the results would represent the most recent team policy. Let me know if you want to see the all-time results but that will probably take a while.
* The common perception that Red Bull has a systematic, ruthless policy of “perform immediately or be replaced”, seems to hold some truth, but much of it stems from their junior team, which is used as the testing ground for executing the strategy. 
* It looks like Red Bull, at least for their 2nd driver, follow patterns similar to other teams.
* Alpine’s 2nd seat looks increasingly unstable recently. Doohan has already been replaced by Colapinto, whose seat is now under pressure.
* 2025 was one of the biggest shuffles in recent history. After a completely static grid in 2024, half the grid in 2025 is drivers in new seats.

I thought I would share the fantasy league that myself and five friends have been playing, and how it’s working out so far.

A little back story, there are six of us that work together at a fire station, and we are huge fans of F1, but everyone’s knowledge of the details varies. I wanted to come up with a fantasy game that gave everyone a good chance of points each weekend. So here it is.

First I made a board along with everyone’s names attached to some Velcro. In order to determine picking order, each week we race the PS4 game at the designated track. This also helps when watching the race because you feel like you really know the track. None of us are huge gamers so it’s sort of the great equalizer. Occasionally we have people gone on vacation or we were too busy at work to accomplish practice and qualifying sessions. In those cases we draw names from a hat and do a running pick either via text or FaceTime.

Once quali has determined picking order, everyone gets to choose ONE team and TWO drivers. The number one pick chooses EITHER one team, or one driver. Then the second person goes and so on. Once the 6th person picks their first pick, they pick again, then picking goes in reverse order, and back down again. (Ex: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2…6)

Picking first is obviously a big advantage, but it does not necessarily mean you will have the best combined score for the weekend. Everyone’s points for the weekend are added up at the end and we get to look forward to the next race on the calendar. 

The game has been a big success. It’s relatively still close at the summer break. We also added a race on the calendar where you’ll see Andretti on the calendar. This is a karting facility nearby where we physically went together and raced for points. Each weekend you end up cheering for new drivers and teams which keeps it exciting. This format has worked out so much better than I planned, and it’s really given us a whole new level of enjoyment this season. Hope you enjoy our shenanigans. Glad break is over. Lights out and away we go!

1n2rcye,Schumacher & Hill 1994,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n2rcye/schumacher_hill_1994/,2025-08-28, Discussion,"I want to do this post as a way of proving something rather unpopular (to my own amusement). The general consensus in here seems to be that Schumacher did not deserve the championship, when in reality it was Hill who, even with the clear faster car, the FIA and the media on his side, couldn’t battle with Schumacher with 4 races less.

I’m going to go race by race proving how this general idea is just wrong:

Races 1-4: Senna and the early Season

Upon the start of the 1994 season, Senna (past his prime already) although struggling was outpacing Hill by an alarming margin, the first 3 races saw how Hill got severely outpaced by more than 0.7% (even reaching 2% at the first qualy in Brazil), the race pace was no different, we saw that in Brazil were before Senna's DNF, Hill already got lapped by lap 50. Without Senna nothing changed in Monaco where he got outqualified by an inferior Ferrari and Mclaren, and crashed into Hakkinen on turn one retiring on the spot.

Races 5-8: First win and first ""real"" controversy

In Spain Hill gets his first victory, a race where he won due to Schumacher's problem with the gearbox, where he had to do almost 2/3 of the race stuck in 5th gear.

Canada and France came and with that 2 appalling qualifying sessions, being just 0.1% infront of a rookie and a 41 year old driver that came out of retirement, although in favor of him, he clearly outpaced them in the race, but this was not enough to beat a Schumacher at his best and even though he had the faster car in both cases, he came behind.

Great Britain came and with that the first ""real"" controversy, Schumacher overtook Hill on the formation laps, something done also by other drivers but ignored (eg: Hakkinen clearly overtook Alesi), that was not allowed and that 5 second stop/go penalty was deserved, what clearly was not was the DSQ which only ocurred due to FIA not communicating correctly with Benetton (the penalty was first believed to be for a non existant false start and later rectified), that and the 2 race ban was just a farce needed to keep the interest in F1 alive because of Schumacher's domination of the season and the lack of champions in the grid (which was one of the reasons Williams called Mansell to race again).

Races 9-13: Hill's ""Golden"" Run

In Germany he crashed into Katayama and had to pit and fall to the back of the grid not getting any points in a crucial race where Schumacher had to retire due to an engine failure.

In Hungary he could only achieved second against a mighty Schumacher (although to be fair he had slightly the worse car).

Fast forward to Belgium, Italy and Portugal, the latter 2 without Schumacher, this 3 races (and the others I've pointed out) were very important in the point I am stressing, in them, Hill was outpaced by a rookie teammate and only ended up ahead due to team orders prioritizing him, 3 race wins in a row where team orders and heavy luck came in handy since he also won due to Ferrari's mechanical DNF's in both Italy and Portugal were even without Schumacher he was unable to win fair and square.

Race 14-16: Title Deciders

At Jerez, Schumacher came back and Hill went back to the same old not being able to take the battle to him even though he had the faster car.

In Suzuka he was benefited with the SC and subsequent red flag due to Schumacher's low fuel strategy that was characteristic of the Benetton team, this allowed Hill to run on free air which ultimately gave him the victory (more luck for Hill).

In came Australia, again Hill, unable to deliver saw how (again with the faster car) his teammate got pole and his (artificially fabricated) title contender qualified in front of him. Here is where I have to say that although I firmly think the crash was not deliberate it was totally Schumacher's fault.

Now with this context in mind let's get some data (team performance table and championship points):

To not be accused of being biased I've excluded the team orders and included Belgium DSQ (although the two tables are available)

If we correct the bad luck and remove the team orders, Schumacher could’ve sealed the championship as early as Belgium, five races before the end. In that context, the 2 race ban wouldn’t have mattered.

So in conclusion, all this data (which is just a miniscule of all that there is) proves just the opposite of the general idea. 1994 should be hailed as one of Schumacher's greatest seasons. Hill, even while having the car, the FIA, and the media on his side, he still couldn’t deliver.","[""I think some journalists summarised perfectly at the time as 'the right champion, the wrong way'."", ""I've never seen a single person try to argue that Damon Hill was better than Michael Schumacher.\n\nWhen people say Michael didn't deserve the title, it's the allegations of cheating against both him and the team.
