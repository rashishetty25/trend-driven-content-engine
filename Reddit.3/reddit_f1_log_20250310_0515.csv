The battle is on.\n\nMeanwhile at McLaren, Oscar's ceiling gets realized it's truly 50/50 on Quali/Race H2H. However the strategies are still an issue as well as Zak no longer being able to reign in Oscar. Lando doesn't allow another Hungary 2.0 and they begin exchanging between P1-P5 with Lewis/Charles/Max/Lando.\n\nMercedes once again get the concept wrong compared to everyone else, George makes the best of it but overdrives the car on a few occasions and falls out of the WDC hunt. Kimi shows us he is the real deal, and repeats Max's history / rise. This involves insanely good raw pace, but also crash prone aptitude. This causes lots of drama with many worried Toto face cam's on F1TV (and future DTS).\n\nMax wins WDC in the end only winning a few races, but keeps smashing it with his consistency. Liam plays second gunner role perfectly knowing he's playing the long game before Max either rides off into sunset or goes to Mercedes (Replacing Kimi when Ferrari inevitably lures him).\n\nWCC goes to Ferrari and Fred brings glory to Italy."", 'Max and Ferrari', 'Norris WDC  \nMcLaren WCC']",85,207,0.8,85,186,186,15,24,-0.010000000000000009,15

Now, with two years of experience and a couple of wins under his belt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j74spl/can_piastri_challenge_norris_for_the_championship/,2025-03-09, Discussion,"I think there is a chance we could see either a McLaren fight similar to 2007, where both drivers lose the championship to a Ferrari driver by one point, or a Rosberg vs. Hamilton-style battle from 2016—if the car is miles ahead of everyone else.

Piastri has the talent, but he couldn't deliver every weekend last year. But when he did, he was sometimes even faster than Lando.

However, when Norris had his Singapore-level pace… nobody could catch him—except himself, almost crashing into the wall.

Can Norris handle the pressure if the car is the fastest and he has bad luck or poor performances? Or maybe we'll see Norris 2.0 with no mistakes, crushing everybody. Or maybe Piastri will get as comfortable as he was in the lower categories, where he won almost every race…

All in all, I'm very excited for the new season! Hopefully, it will be a tight season with more teams fighting for wins than just one.

","['He needs to be consistently faster than Norris, not just challenge him every now and again as he did last year.', 'As a fan of Oscar, I still think there are too many questions that need to be answered. I do believe he’ll improve from last year, but the gap to Lando does feel quite big. \n\nHe can improve tire management but one lap speed is gonna be difficult to improve and the fact that he got zero gp poles last year compared to Lando’s 8 (!!!) was disappointing. I think it’s safe to say Lando is all around a faster driver and Oscar will need to give it his all (and pull something out of nowhere) for the entire season to beat him this year.', 'If anything I think last year showed that he simply isn\'t fast enough. I was impressed with his rookie season especially how cold and calculated he is, but it seems he just lacks speed.\n\nAll the ""killer-instinct"" in the world doesn\'t help you if your teammate is consistently 10s ahead of you in the race.', ""I don't think there was any point last year where Piastri was quicker than Norris across the whole race. Maybe 1 or 2 off-weekends..? Exception makes the rule though."", ""I just don't think he has the pace. Too many races where's he's pottering about a pit stop behind Norris.\n\nLook at Baku. He made a great move on Leclerc and won the race so you can't be too critical. But then look at the pace Norris had. Norris would have dominated that race and won it much easier than Piastri did. Good, but not top tier. That sums it up."", 'No', '2007 had two evenly matched drivers, and Rosberg was not that far off Lewis.

Yes, i think Abu dhabi last year should have killed all speculation', 'I can only see him winning WDC if no other team can challenge and Norris faces some monumental bad luck.

1j7limp,Where did the “Piastri doesn’t crack under pressure” claim come from?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j7limp/where_did_the_piastri_doesnt_crack_under_pressure/,2025-03-10, Discussion,"I have been seeing a lot of people saying Piastri has this “killer instinct” that makes him a WC contender more than any other driver on the grid, but why? As other comments have pointed out, in Abu Dhabi he almost entirely cracked under pressure after a poor start and had a frankly awful race. It just seems like people think he’s calm when he just doesn’t say much on the radio and doesn’t really reflect in his drives.","['He got crashed into turn 1 and his race was completely ruined.\n\nThat then ends your day and you play catch up all race. Every driver no matter how good they are have those days. \n\nOscar has a calm demeanor 95% of the time win or lose. That’s what’s earned his reputation.', 'Oh nice we\'re hitting the ""Reddit starts to hate"" era after last year was the year of constant praise and overhype. \n\nThe inevitable life cycle.', ""Because we've never heard him even remotely agitated, if he's annoyed you'll just get a sarcastic remark 😅"", 'because he talks to his race engineer in a monotonous tone\n\nthats pretty much it', 'Because we compare him to Lando, who cracks under pressure', ""It was less about Oscar and more about Lando.  Lando is becoming a threat and people like Christian Horner will stir the pot by planting stories into the media via interviews and off-hand comments to play mind games with the drivers.\n\nOscar is great, don't get me wrong - he's got *huge* potential - but most of this discourse was just mind games against Lando."", 'Can you please elaborate how being hit from behind equals cracking under pressure?', ""You're ignoring the fact that Max made contact with him in Abu Dhabi which caused his race to happen the way it did.\xa0\n\n\nThere's races that supports the argument that he can handle pressure like Baku where he defended Charles for pretty much the whole race but sometimes there's been instances where the pressure got to him like his quali performances in the latter half of last season (Brazil Q3 felt like the worst imo)."", ""I think Oscar cracked in Hungary. He had a big enough lead, and then he made a major mistake that put him close enough to Lando so that when McLaren pitted Lando first, Lando undercut Oscar. If Oscar hadn't made that major mistake, Lando wouldn't have been in undercut range. Then, when Oscar was supposed to speed up and get close to Lando, Oscar made another major mistake instead. Like he said on the radio at the end, he made switching the drivers back a lot more complicated than it needed to be.\n\nBut, Oscar's only had two years of F1. Third and fourth years are really the time where they need to be showing their skill as they begin to enter their early prime. I don't think we know enough to evaluate Oscar yet as an F1 driver. But, he's shown a lot of potential both in F1 and in his junior career before that.\n\nOscar is calm on the radio and calm in interviews, and that's why he has that reputation.""]",0,49,0.31,0,44,44,0,2,-0.020000000000000018,0

Yeah, Piastri could stick it on pole and drive away, but if he got stuck in the midfield he tended to stay there. \n\nI think if Norris can do what Max did last year and bag 6-7 of the opening 10, then he will stand an excellent chance of winning the title. \n\nPiastri won't want to play second fiddle (and nor should he) so Norris will have to demolish him on track to ensure his support later on in the season."", ""What are these posts lol.\n\nSeason hasn't started yet. Maybe wait and let's all see if that's truly the case. How about that? \n\nThere are other drivers that could definetly pose a challenge to Norris. This championship isn't a given to him lol.

I expect 5+ wins from Lando this year"", 'Blessed,  are you new?', ""McLaren are favorites no doubt but this season will be anything but straightforward. They don't have the sort of advantage over the field that Red Bull did in recent years and the front flex rules change dramatically after 9 races which could upend the pecking order at the front. Add to that a very strong teammate in Oscar who made a big jump from year 1 to 2 and Max not having to worry about a teammate taking points off him and I very much doubt Lando will dominate.
