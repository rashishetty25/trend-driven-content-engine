1jrn4wb,How did Sky go the entire session not acknowledging Doohan had his DRS open?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jrn4wb/how_did_sky_go_the_entire_session_not/,2025-04-04, Discussion,I watched F1TVs presentation of FP2 and before any replay Palmer speculated Doohan left his DRS open and confirmed with the first reply noting the 5 blue lights on the steering wheel. Later I watched the “international” feed aka Sky and they actively said DRS was not open replay after replay. How’s that possible when it’s so obvious on the steering wheel? ,"['An then there is German Sky with Ralf Schumacher who thought it was a bump in the track or a engine braking malfuntion until his son David wrote him a quick message telling him its the DRS lol', 'I’m pretty sure Ant mentioned it almost immediately? But then they heard he dipped a tire so they all kinda just dropped it?', 'Ant said he probably left the DRS open, he kept requesting they show the camera shot so he could confirm it.', 'Ant mentioned it right away', 'I think which broadcast you watch depends on what you want out of it.  I watched Sky for 3 years before switching to F1TV for the last 3.  Sky felt more traditional with sportscaster personalities and typical storylines being the emphasis.  \n\nWith F1TV, I enjoy the more technical discussions they emphasize with Sam, Jolyon, and David… then the addition of the strategist with Ruth.  For FP1 this week, they had a long time former Red Bull crew member and it was fascinating to hear his take on what was going on.  Plus they have all the reserve drivers drop by occasionally.  It just feels much more interesting for my viewing preference. \n\nNeither are the “right one” - just whichever one you enjoy listening to based on how you consume sporting events.  I like to know how the sausage is made, so F1TV is better at scratching that itch.\n\nEdit: corrected a comment about FP1 being this week… not year.', 'How did you go the entire time not acknowledging Ant had his theories about this?', 'So you\'ve got the Sky booth with Crofty in it and a producer. Expert commentator Villeneuve is not there - he is out traipsing around the circuit, which is a good thing; it\'s what they normally do with Brundle during FP2, it\'s a great part of Sky\'s coverage. Davidson is the second expert commentator but he\'s also not in the booth - to save some money he\'s back in the UK, so he\'s not actually there with Crofty.  \n\nWhen they show the onboard replays it\'s clear to me that Doohan doesn\'t switch off DRS by pressing a steering wheel button. I\'m watching wondering why they don\'t acknowledge that, I think ""maybe that\'s not how it works"", so I wait for the replay looking down the straight so we can see whether the DRS was open or not. \n\nF1 shows this replay once during the session, and it\'s while they are crossing to Villeneuve out on the track - so the replay is shown in a little thumbnail on the Sky feed; it\'s not seen by Villeneuve, and it\'s missed by Crofty. Kind of a perfect storm. \n\nThe weird part of this is that the producers or Davidson don\'t take another look at that replay to see what we all see. Particularly during all the red flag periods that come during the session. Davidson is awesome, but he and the producers definitely missed this.', 'Pretty sure Ant Davidson mentioned it multiple times', 'It’s weird because Davidson suggested it was the cause at 51:50 and almost prophetically spoke of it toward the end of FP1']",2593,210,0.93,2593,5979,5979,76,4,0.0,76

Their simulator and windtunnel don't correlate with what they are seeing on track. So the problems from last season are still the problems this season."", 'Translation and full article:\n\n> McLaren continued its upward trend on Friday\'s practice session at Suzuka. The papaya-shaped racers once again set the pace. Their biggest rival is Mercedes. Red Bull, on the other hand, continues to struggle with its car. We\'ve compiled the key findings in our analysis.\n\n> Four red flags in the second practice session cost the teams 38 minutes of track time. The long runs also fell victim to the interruptions. And on the fast laps between accidents and grass fires, much depended on how the drivers navigated traffic and completed their preparation laps.\n\n> The picture is somewhat distorted. The morning\'s long runs had to compensate for the missed race simulations in the afternoon. The picture is relatively clear here. McLaren is also setting the tone in Suzuka. Mercedes and Ferrari are following. Red Bull is still in deep trouble. The white-painted cars were completely out of balance.\n\n> Neither the base setup, for which the engineers had high hopes, nor the setup adjustments made in the afternoon worked. However, the sister cars from Toro Rosso once again showed strong early form. This is still impressive considering that Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson had increased their engine power for their fast laps.\n\n> Although Nico Hülkenberg had the best long run on paper on the medium tires, the Sauber driver was running on less fuel than the top teams and only completed four laps. ""The car felt decent, was better in the second practice session than in the first,"" Hülkenberg reflected. Both Sauber cars were equipped with the new underbody and rear wings in the afternoon.\n\n> **Is McLaren superior again?** Both fastest times on Friday went to a McLaren driver. In the first session, Lando Norris had the edge. His lead over George Russell was 0.163 seconds. In the afternoon, teammate Oscar Piastri set the pace. The Australian beat Norris by 0.049 seconds and Isack Hadjar by 0.404 seconds. The internal duel between the McLaren drivers was decided in the chicane. Whoever made the cleanest passage there had the fastest time.\n\n> The Papaya racers\' dominance continued in the long runs. Norris averaged a time of 1:33.361 minutes over seven laps, making him one and a half tenths faster than Russell, who, however, also completed three laps longer. The McLarens again showed remarkable performance in maintaining their lap times almost consistently, while their rivals began to experience noticeable tire degradation as the distance increased.\n\n> **Does Mercedes have a chance of winning?** Mercedes is the second-best team. George Russell felt comfortable right away and maintained his high level throughout the day. Even taking into account Mercedes\' usual early form on green tracks on Friday, Russell is the first challenger to McLaren. This is also underscored by the second-best long run in the first practice session.\n\n> The Englishman calls it a positive day and predicts: ""If everything goes well, we can finish on the front two rows."" Suzuka rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli is still lagging behind. The Italian lost more than a second to his team captain in both practice sessions. This shows that Suzuka is a track that\'s not easy to learn in a flash. Antonelli admitted: ""I didn\'t get the most out of the car in the first sector. George showed what\'s possible.""\n\n> Ferrari was just behind Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton beat his former teammate Russell by 23 thousandths of a second. In the endurance test, however, the Silver Arrows were faster. Russell averaged 1:33.489 minutes over ten laps. Charles Leclerc completed eight laps and achieved an average time of 1:33.566 minutes.\n\n> **How does Tsunoda fare against Verstappen?** In the first practice session, Yuki Tsunoda lost just 0.107 seconds to Max Verstappen. The world champion had to overtake six cars on his fastest lap, which reportedly cost him around three-tenths of a second. In the afternoon, the lap times were not comparable. Verstappen drove on soft tires, while Tsunoda stuck with the medium. Nevertheless, Tsunoda performed significantly better than Liam Lawson or even Sergio Perez last year.\n\n> What is worrying, however, is the overall shape of the Red Bull RB21. The car alternates between understeer and oversteer. Verstappen reported on the radio that it felt as if the car was bending. The Red Bull\'s severe sliding accelerated tire wear.\n\n(1/2)', '>Sporting director Helmut Marko was annoyed: ""Whenever the simulator cheers, the basic setup on the track isn\'t right.

1jrihmw,Ryo Hirakawa,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jrihmw/ryo_hirakawa/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"Alpine reserve driver. Two time WEC champion. I wanted to make this post because when I've mentioned Ryo in the past, many people have thought I was talking about Indonesian former F1 driver Rio Haryanto. 

Ryo had a really admirable FP1 today. I am not placing undue importance on finishing order in free practice, or making a big deal that he finished ahead of Gasly, but for how little time he's had in any F1 car, he did remarkably well. He wasn't afraid to push the car, and clearly Alpine had the faith in him to let him. Too often rookie FP1 sessions just have the rookies all at the back playing extremely safe.

Ryo starting racing at the quite late age of 13, after watching the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton won that day. Ryo saw those F1 cars, and he wanted to race. A year later, he won the 2008 all Japan junior kart championship.

Since then, he's had incredible success in Super GT, WEC, and Super Formula. But he's clearly always had interest in racing in the rest of the world and being part of F1. He stopped racing in Super GT when he got the opportunity to join WEC (and he won WEC hypercar that year, and the next year). When he got the oppotttunity to be an F1 test and reserve driver, he left Super Formula as well, so now he only does WEC amd F1 work. I’d love for him to get even just one F1 race. 

I’m not trying to take Doohan's seat from him. But I am saying that maybe he shouldn’t race this weekend. That was a massive crash. Also, the team has Ryo right there who knows the track really well and was proper quick in FP1. Maybe I’d just love to see a 31 year old man with an F1 dream who is super accomplished in other racing series to get than chance in front of his home crowd.","['I love the appreciation for Ryo, (our) member of Toyota #8.

As to his attitude? “He is a kind-natured person,” Malvern says. “But extremely competitive.”\n\nAnd this part about honesty has always been my opinion on Lando:\n\n>Norris seems to have a strong sense of justice. “He is a very honest person, and works best when people are honest and frank with him too,” his race engineer says. “If he feels strongly about something, he will say it.”\n\nI still think that\'s why he and Max get along. Same perspective. \n\nI also liked this:\n\n>Even your fiercest rivals. “As soon as the helmet’s on, you forget about all of these things,” he says. “It’s a different world, you’re in a different mental state. You don’t give the guy one more metre because you’re friends with him or do a sport with him, right? In my view it’s the opposite. It makes you give them one less metre because you’re able to trust them more. But then you also know how they act, when to maybe not trust them. It is a complicated balance but it’s not a bad one in my eyes.” He cites his older brother: “He’s always the biggest competitor I’ve had. That’s the same as with your friends. You always want to beat them and prove that you’re better. So those guys are my biggest competitors but my friends off the track — and when I’m on track I want to beat them more than anything.”\n\nIt reminded me of how he and Daniel did so well in giving each other the space when Lando overtook Danny in Mexico 2023.', 'That’s why I could never be a F1 driver.

Most strikingly F1 tempo does not indicate that Max lost all his time in the hairpin. I think the official one is probably more accurate and F1 Tempo is mostly being held back by the poor sampling rate that FastF1 provides (5 Hz).\n\nI also think it shows some care needs to be taken when interpreting the data from FastF1 and visualisations such as F1 Tempo. This can be important since some journalists/media outlets use this data to draw certain conclusions. \n\nExample: [video by The Race](https://youtu.be/q9UrEGSYfpo?si=PPt7u-lABglj_6ON&t=132) (time-stamp 2:12).', 'AFAIK they have access to 4 significant digits after the decimal. They only use 3 digits though. And polling rate is probably similar to those. 1000hz compared to 4-5hz is such a huge gap.\xa0', 'F1Tempo aligns some data points manually and they lose sector-by-sector delta accuracy. That\'s because publicly available data is sampled at a much less frequent rate compared to what F1 and the teams have available.\n\nOn my own app, I use resampling and interpolation + distance shifting to align the data as best as I can before calculating the delta. On top of that, I also align them by minisectors. Basically, I try to preserve the gaps at ""sector gates"" for the delta. It will never be 1:1 and depending on the quality of the data, there might be some error on braking zones, but I feel like the end result is usually more accurate than what F1Tempo provides, if you compare it across the entire lap.\n\n[You can have a look into mine here](https://i.imgur.com/a8CRtDg.jpeg)', 'Me dumb. Learn me numbers meaning please.', ""Definitely a very interesting topic. I've noticed that the accuracy of the delta from f1tempo varies from session to session. Sometimes I notice that the delta is off by as much as 0.3s-0.5s, while in other cases it seems to be spot on."", ""I'm not sure off the top of my head what a reasonable sample resolution would be here, but wow, 5Hz does feel low."", ""I think that it's not the sampling rate that's the main problem, but the accuracy of the data itself, incluing the gps positioning."", ""Is the y-axis reversed in the Official telemetry? What I mean is, Verstappen is in blue and he had the faster lap, yet the delta shows his line above Yuki's, whereas on F1tempo Yuki's line is above the blue line meaning that going up the y-axis indicates positive delta time."", ""Sampling cannot be an explanation for a bad delta, it can only be an explanation for missed inputs or inaccurate speed but only at most for 200ms. Their position on track and their relative time will simply be off for a bit but then update to accurate within 200ms at most because 5Hz is 5 times a second. This is plenty for an accurate enough delta. There's something else wrong here.\n\nIf anything, I wonder if the official one is wrong. Look at the speed graphs. How is it possible for Max to lose so much delta in that hairpin with those speed graphs? He enters the corner a bit slower, but has a higher minimum speed and exits it the same as Yuki. It doesn't make sense that he lost a tenth there.""]",108,24,0.92,108,133,133,-4,0,0.0,-4

Interesting to see are their two different approaches: Lando lifts straight off the throttle and stomps then back on it, whereas Max has a more ""rounded"" approach to this. Lando gets the better exit and goes flat through T3, where Max has to lift slightly. Max gains time by being on the throttle longer inbetween T4 and T5, yet has a worse exit out of T6. In the Dunlop (T7), Lando has to lift slightly, which brings Max back to his tail. The Degners paint a clear picture: Max is longer on the throttle, lifts more gradual, yet steps on back on it just as quick, lifts more gradual, brakes 10 metres later and hops back onto the throttle as quick as Lando does. Nonetheless, has a worse exit out of the Degners and loses time approaching the Hairpin. Max has a slightly better exit out of it and begins clawing back speed to Lando. Spoon is the masterpiece of this lap: Braking about 40 metres later than Lando, he carries more speed into T14, where he doesn't bother with feathering like Lando, but steps once onto the accelerator. Yet, a significantly worse exits loses him quite some speed until T15. At the Casino Triangle, the strategy should be clear to everyone by now: Max brakes 30 metres later and and steps more onto the throttle inbetween T16 and T17, but has, yet again, a worse exit out of this tricky last corners. Lando gains much speed approaching T18, but is momentarily stationary on the throttle pedal. Max comes closer again and this was maybe the difference inbetween P1 and P2 today.

My conclusion: Despite his many complaints, Max has complete trust into the cars braking characteristics and is able to compensate much this way, despite not being able to step onto the the accelerator as soon as Lando (as seen inbetween the Degners and T16/17).  
(the eagle-eyed may have spotted, that Lando's throttle graph is slightly beneath Max's in the high-speed factions. In fact, he drives at 99%, a few spikes exclued, where Max is at 100%.
