There are only so many champion-level drivers, and it’s not like other teams’ programs are constantly bringing in top tier talents.\n\nI dislike Marko as a person but he is extremely talented at what he does. And to your point about Max- Marko was the one who convinced him to sign with Red Bull, by convincing Christian to give him a seat in F1 for 2015. That’s a crazy gutsy move that obviously paid off.

Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were able to easily control the pace of the pursuers, no one had the pace to create great concerns. The degradation was under control on each compound, Andrea Stella confirmed that by monitoring the Stroll pace (departed with the hard) “we realized that a stop was the option to perform”. Haas also benefited from a winning strategy, diversifying and adapting to the conditions.\n\nVerstappen had an ineffective start but at least he was able to return to the distance, the RB21 seems a distant relative of the previous cars. Russell tried to stay around the cars of Woking with a good texture.\n\nThe Ferraris went close to disaster at the first corner, Leclerc fought well with a broken wing, despite a balance damage quantified in 2/3 tenths. For a long phase he could have been better than the seven-time English champion, which shows how well Hamilton’s settings had gone out of the window with high load.\n\nYet the worst was yet to come. The SF-25 remains a car with unknown reactions in terms of long run. From the sprint stars to the stables of the Fia sentence an hour and a half after the race. The inspectors of the Federation measured the cars and found them non-compliant. Leclerc’s SF-25 was disqualified for less than one net weight, Lewis Hamilton’s number 44 for excessive shoe wear that protects the bottom. As well as the Alpine of Gasly the riders have been removed from the standings. The rules in terms of compliance are not questionable and it has already happened that an auto-Venturi was found with excessive consumption of the underbody however suffering a double disqualification is an unacceptable episode for any team. In both cases, Ferrari cannot have benefited in terms of performance, they are both serious but venial errors, the adjustments are simply not working in the long race, unlike the sprint. This could not go unnoticed on a smooth track as the Chinese one is currently.\n\nTHE TECHNICIANS HAVE DISCOVERED THE ENIGMA THAT FOR THE OBSERVERS STARTED BY THE BAHRAIN TESTS.\nAS FAR AS I LEARNED, THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW DESIGN OF THE FRONT PULL ROD SUSPENSION, MUCH LESS WITH THE AERODYNAMICS IN THE STRICT SENSE SINCE IT IS COMPLYING WITH THE STABILITY REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe extra consumption of the plank is not a cause but a consequence. The structure of the rear air does not allow the expected stiffness, which obliges you to increase the height in a closed park to protect yourself with 100kg on board. The main clue is the rear suspension, approved in July last year, together with the new gearbox.\nThe Haas shares the mechanical parts and worked well after the Australian disaster, however it does not have the performance loading platform or the sophisticated Ferrari aerodynamics. In other words, the SF-25 struggles with the excessive softness that is compromising its operation. It looks like something already seen, for example, on the old Mercedes last year. The Red in the right conditions can generate much more load than the previous car, the sprint showed what the car could do with 35 kg of gasoline. The qualification after three hours canceled expectations again, less downforce in the curve and greater instability of the rear.\n\nLoic Serra arrived in October so relatively late on project 677. The French DT has returned to Maranello and is intervening to correct its effectiveness and reliability but clearly it is premature to formulate a solution or its timing. The problem is not easy to solve, the engineers are also working on some update areas that should be introduced new parts from Bahrain.', ""Season is cooked.

Given the massive financial stakes involved—tens of millions for teams and potentially billions in sponsorships and branding—it’s hard not to wonder just how rigorous the FIA’s anti-doping protocols truly are. Are they genuinely strict, or is there a level of willful ignorance when it comes to substances that boost cognitive endurance and reaction times?

Also, a physiological observation: post-race footage often shows drivers with injected, bloodshot sclerae and facial flushing—classic signs of heightened sympathetic nervous system activity, catecholamine surges, or even potential stimulant use.

This year there is a chasm between them.\xa0\n\nOn top of that the general consensus Ive seen on here is that Lawson might perform better in the Racing Bulls car, but yet they still say Red Bull is faster.\xa0\n\nSo take a fast driver that is not Max. Let’s\xa0\xa0say Leclerc. Put Leclerc in the Red Bull and then the Racing Bull, which does he perform better in? I actually think it would be the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nI think the only argument that Red Bull is better is that it is set up for Max and that if he were in a Racing Bulls he would not be as fast. Unfortunately it is hard to tell weather this is true or not as Max has spent practically his whole career in Red Bull. Personally I think that Max’s set up is a factor but perhaps not to the same degree that some people argue.\xa0\nI also think for example that Verstappen would have likely put more than two tenths on Hadjar Im China qualifying if both were in Racing Bulls. Thus Max would have set a faster time in the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nThere is also the argument to consider that Verstappen could also make set up changes to suit him on the Racing Bull which would make it faster for him. \xa0\nSo overall I would say that in qualifying pace Max would set faster times were he in the Racing Bull.

In fact race pace has been Red Bull’s big strength since the new ground effect era began in 2022.\xa0\nEither way it would be so interesting to see and it would be very telling about the performance of the two cars and Max himself’s talents (Were he to jump into the Racing Bull and put a huge gap on Yuki and Hadjar, people could no longer argue Max is only good because he sets up his car so his team mate can’t drive it.\xa0']",259,229,0.86,259,2215,2215,16,3,0.0,16

Despite all the well-deserved criticism the F1TV app gets, I love watching old race recaps. The archive is a real treasure trove of long-forgotten F1 moments. I started with the 1989 season and, after many, many hours of watching, I’ve just begun the 2010 season.

There’s something so charming about those old recaps. They’re like a mini race documentary series. They featured insights about the circuit, weekend events so far, interviews, commentary on current rumors, the starting grid, and sometimes even more. They also provide important historical context.

Today’s race recaps, by comparison, feel so dull and cheaply made with the spliced up OG commentary. It genuinely hurts. Especially thinking ahead a few years, rewatching a season will give you just the race, instead of a holistic view of everything happening at the time: the drama, the fashion, the old tech, and so on.

Anybody else feel the same?","['I\'m wondering: Is it because we get SO MUCH information during the broadcast already, what is there to add in the post-race? \n\nMy family are new to F1, and the kids have been watching some world broadcasts out of curiosity, and we\'re like, ""What\'s going on?

1jjft0v,"Hot take: the 2nd Red Bull seat isn't cursed, the car is terrible, swap Max and Yuki for 1 weekend",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjft0v/hot_take_the_2nd_red_bull_seat_isnt_cursed_the/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"I've seen lots and lots of news articles, opinion pieces, comments and discussions about how Liam Lawson is now performing next to Max and how Red Bull *again* is failing to deliver a good 2nd driver next to Max. However, to me the conclusion is simple and there is even a simple option to prove this.

Well, what is my conclusion? Based on the fact that for years now Max has been having not that many problems with the car but all his teammates bar Ricciardo have: Gasly, Albon, Perez, Lawson. All of them have had problems with the car, some more, some less. To me Perez initially did quite well, Albon wasn't too bad either.

Now, we can all continue arguing about the driver choices, but in my opinion that's completely irrelevant by now.

Apart from that, I've seen some journalists from both Britain and Germany stating that they think the Red Bull car is actually worse than the Racing Bulls car this year and that Max purely with his capabilities is putting the car in places where it doesn't belong.

Again, you can argue about those kinds of things, but why don't Red Bull as a whole simply put Max into the Racing Bulls for a weekend and Tsunoda into the Red Bull for a weekend together with Lawson. Simply put:

* Just like with any multiple world champion, you know what Max is capable of, if he is placed into the Racing Bulls and puts it on pole or close to it, then yes: that car is better than the RBR. If he outscores Hadjar by just a few tenths like you can expect with any great driver, then no the car isn't better.
* Tsunoda and Lawson at Red Bull for a weekend would put them up against each other like they did last year at Racing Bulls, you have a like-for-like comparison and you'll know both whether they are equally capable to drive the RB21 or whether one struggles much more than the other.
* At the same time if both struggle in the RB21, you know that swapping them for the rest of the year is not of any use.

The only downside to all this is that Max potentially loses points in the championship fight if he isn't able to put the Racing Bulls car on the grid where the RB21 would be. But let's be real: with McLaren clearly the fastest and already having no 2nd driver at Red Bull scoring any points, let alone significant points, at best you can expect Max to be 3rd. If he becomes like 6/7th in the Racing Bulls car, which is very much likely if they don't screw up their strategy every race, he'd lose just 7-9 points. Points are points and could be costly at the end of the year, but only if Red Bull will get a grip on their car and are able to become faster than McLaren during the 2nd half of the year (basically a reverse from last year). But that's not a given and I feel swapping the drivers around for a weekend is worth it by now.

Yuki knows Suzuki very well of course so for him there would be no excuses apart from getting to know the RB21, but he has quite some experience by now. And if Max is capable of putting the RB21 where he puts it, he should have no issues putting the Racing Bulls into the top 8 at the very least.

Because imho the conclusion is that the Red Bull car is actually terrible to drive and putting both Yuki and Liam in the RB21 for a weekend puts them head-to-head AND gives Max the ability to assess the Racing Bulls car and also where that is better than the RB21 because it is definitely better in some aspects when Yuki or even Hadjar is putting the car at times just 2-3 tenths behind Max in the RB21. Also: Max has not been in a different team/car ever since 2016, that's 9 years by now, so he knows nothing else and just like your own car that you have for a long time, eventually minor issues are taken for granted until you drive a better car and you suddenly notice what the heck is wrong with your own car. That same might apply when Max gets his taste of the Racing Bulls, because one thing seems for sure: that car is balanced very very well. Both drivers have no issue getting everything out of the car and they're fast. At the very least directly behind the top 4 teams but at times even faster. Yuki was P7/P8 in front of Antonelli until they pitted him a 2nd time, something Hamilton was screwed over by as well.

TL;DR: Don't swap Liam away, that won't solve anything. Instead swap Max and Yuki for one weekend and assess the issues and then have Red Bull come to the conclusion that it isn't their driver that's the issue, it's their car.","[""I'm tired, boss"", ""Even if this was the case which isn't, Swapping Max to the VCARB is going to be an PR disaster because sponsors like Oracle are not paying multi million dollars per year to have the RBR driven by Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson\n\nthey are paying them to have their name associated with the Likes of Max verstappen"", 'Max isnt going faster in the junior teams car.\n\nThe Red Bull car is faster if max is behind the wheel.\n\nIf you think differently you are just wrong', ""The car isn't terrible, nor is there a curse. The quote below is Horner from an article posted earlier. We know what the issue is, and it's not exactly  the driver, but it kind of is the driver. But also it's the car. \n\n> “If I think back to the beginning of '22, we had quite a stable car with quite a bit of understeer in it, which obviously Max hates.

1jj06c5,Debut Down Under: Liam Lawson's First Drive | Behind the Charge,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj06c5/debut_down_under_liam_lawsons_first_drive_behind/,2025-03-24, Video,"In 2023: Liam Lawson says his dad was never able to take him to Singapore GP so he will be taking him to the race instead

""My dad actually used to promise me every year that he would take me to the Singapore Grand Prix, and in the end, we never went, but he's going to be coming to the Grand Prix this weekend, so actually I'm taking him!""

https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/liam-lawsons-rocky-road-to-f1-my-parents-sold-their-house-so-i-could-keep-racing/10658101/

But to get there in the first place, Lawson revealed his parents made a huge sacrifice. ""My parents and my whole family really gave a lot, especially in the early years through go-karts,"" Lawson told Red Bull's Talking Bull podcast. *""My parents sold their house so that I could keep racing. It's massive. They gave absolutely everything for me to be able to race, even just go-karts because it's so expensive.""*

Like McLaren's Oscar Piastri, who lived in boarding school in the UK as a teenager while trying to forge a racing career, Lawson's perseverance was severely tested while 11,000 miles from home. But that early sacrifice often proves a formative experience for the Australian and Kiwi drivers that do make it across and provides them with the steel and grit to survive in F1's often difficult environment.

""I didn't finish high school or anything,"" Lawson shared. ""Honestly, I was just excited to be able to go and chase my dream. And there are always hard parts about it, but there was never a question of whether it was too difficult and I wanted to go home.""

But while he showed promise by finishing second in his first season in Europe, Lawson didn't get picked up by an F1 junior academy right away, and he headed back home to New Zealand's famed Toyota Winter Series without a plan after that, and with his F1 dream on the verge of already being shattered at the age of 17.

""Being from New Zealand, trying to get the money to compete overseas is really, really hard,"" Lawson recalled. ""So, between a group of amazing people that have been behind me, sponsors and investors, we set up the structure to get enough money to go to Europe and do a season and try and get recognised by a junior team, because without it, there was no chance to get a Formula 1.

""I had a good season, but I didn't have any call-ups from any teams. And then I just did this championship in New Zealand's over the off-season, with no plan of what I was doing in 2019.""As a kid being into Formula 1, I would watch this series every single year and I dreamed of driving it. And to me, it was like the Formula 1 of racing at the time.""

Fortunately for Lawson, talent scouts were watching the opening round of the 2019 Toyota Racing Series. And not just any scout, but Red Bull's Helmut Marko, who was keeping tabs on Lawson's older team-mate Lucas Auer, who was part of the Red Bull junior programme at the time.

And even before he would go on to beat Auer, and fellow Kiwi Marcus Armstrong to the title, Lawson would get the news he dreamed of for so long.

""I guess Helmut was watching because of Lucas and I had a really good first weekend,"" he said. ""When I raced in F4 in Europe, Jack Doohan was a Red Bull junior at the time and we tested together somewhere. I remember seeing him walking around in his Red Bull suit and I remember thinking how cool it would be to be a Red Bull junior.

""And I got the call-up after that first weekend in New Zealand, I found out one or two days after the weekend. I was sitting in a cafe - I remember exactly where I was sitting. I got told and it was obviously pretty emotional. I basically got picked up at the perfect time and it saved my career. I had those four weeks left of that championship, and then I had no plan after that...""

Lawson then plied his trade in FIA F3 and F2, going head-to-head with Piastri, dovetailing his single-seater activities with a Red Bull-backed stint aboard a Ferrari GT3 car in the German DTM sportscar championship, that yielded him a runner-up spot.

Finishing third in the 2022 F2 championship landed him a Red Bull reserve role alongside a Japanese Super Formula campaign for 2023, and when Ricciardo broke his wrist in Dutch Grand Prix practice Lawson got the nod to deputise for the Australian for the next five rounds.

In typical Red Bull fashion, it was sink or swim for Lawson, but he kept his head cool and scored points in the extremely challenging Singapore Grand Prix.

Lawson's cameo performances complicated matters for Red Bull in the short term, with Yuki Tsunoda and Ricciardo still getting the nod over Lawson to start the 2024 season while Lawson returned to a reserve role.

But what Red Bull was really looking for in a driver for the renamed RB team is someone who could be a future Red Bull driver. And with it becoming clear Ricciardo isn't ticking all those boxes any more, it has handed Lawson the opportunity to battle Tsunoda for a Red Bull berth.

Following his family's sacrifice to give him a fighting chance, and Red Bull noticing him just when he was approaching a dead-end street, claiming a Red Bull seat would be the third miracle on Lawson's rocky road to the top.

1jjcr23,New Netflix show suggestion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjcr23/new_netflix_show_suggestion/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"# The Problem:

With the support of the FIA, I think there should be a new show to complement *Drive to Survive*.

I don’t mind *Drive to Survive*, but it has become more of a drama series than an in-depth coverage of the sport. While it’s great for bringing in new fans, it has also led to a wave of social media discourse from people who don’t fully understand the complexities of F1.

Formula 1 is an incredibly intricate sport, with countless elements that make it fascinating—car design, engines, racecraft, team strategies, and so much more. Yet, a lot of new fans miss these aspects, leading to takes like this one from the past few days:

>

This kind of misunderstanding happens all the time, and it’s frustrating because these are fundamental parts of the sport that have existed for decades.

# The Idea:

A new show that dives into the technical and strategic side of F1—covering the rules, mechanics, racecraft, and innovations that define the sport.

Each episode could focus on a different aspect:

* **Engines** – The different suppliers, why some teams build their own while others rely on manufacturers, how engines are managed across a season, cooling systems, and FIA regulations.
* **Car Regulations & Innovation** – How teams design their cars within the rules, how they push boundaries, and the technical loopholes they exploit.
* **Racecraft & Strategy** – The tactical decisions made during a race, pit stop strategies, driver-team communications, and how they impact performance.
* **Behind the Scenes** – A day in the life of a pit crew member, engineers, and mechanics, showcasing their roles and contributions.

With engaging visuals, expert commentary, and perhaps even actors or F1-loving celebrities acting as the audience, asking the questions casual fans might have, this show could bridge the gap between hardcore fans and newcomers.

1jj1bnm,Lawson's speed compared to Tsunoda,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj1bnm/lawsons_speed_compared_to_tsunoda/,2025-03-24, Statistics,"As yet another driver is struggling in the second Red Bull seat, narratives seem to be running wild that take some liberties with the nuances of formula 1. Particularly the ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"" narrative.


USA sprint - Lawson 0,029s faster  
USA - Lawson 0,456s faster  
Mexico - Tsunoda 0,033s faster  
Brazil sprint - Lawson 0,545s faster  
Brazil - Tsunoda 0,373s faster  
Las Vegas - Tsunoda 1,438s faster  
Qatar sprint - Lawson 0,017s faster  
Qatar - Tsunoda 0,047s faster  
Abu Dhabi - Tsunoda 0,053s faster

That means that although Tsunoda beat Lawson in qualifying last year, he was on average only 0,099s faster. Translate that to this year's Australian Grand Prix, and that difference still results in p19. Translate that to China, and you're still only looking at p18 in sprint/p19 in gp instead of p20.


Now don't get me wrong, the point of this post isn't to say Yuki Tsunoda didn't deserve that second Red Bull seat, or that he wouldn't have done (slightly) better. I think there's good reason to believe Yuki's experience could have made a difference. However, let's make that point based on good arguments and wipe bad arguments off the table; bad arguments such as ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"".","[""This implies that performance stays the same regardless of car or environment, which it doesn't. Sometimes a different car can unlock a drivers potential. The elite drivers will always maximize the car, but the not so elite drivers will find different results and at times not do good with a different car, both Lawson and Tsunoda are in the second group.

Lawson in the second Red Bull seat could end his career if he doesn't improve dramatically. Red Bull is essentially done with Tsunoda.

It looked nailed on around Spa that Ricciardo would be jumping into the Red Bull, numerous reports that the Verstappen camp fully expected it and were surprised when it didn’t materialise for whatever reason. Once that decision was made the writing was really on the wall, but I don’t think anyone really expected them to pull the trigger mid season like they did. In my opinion, they should’ve given him to the end of the year and if they’d made the decision to get rid of Checo, could’ve lined up like this in 2025:

RBR: Verstappen/Ricciardo
RB: Tsunoda/Lawson

Hadjar as reserve wouldn’t have been the worst move for his career, and if Ricciardo struggled they then had the option of swapping one of Lawson or Tsunoda into the seat. A year or two would’ve been Daniel’s max stint anyway and that time to develop would’ve benefitted Lawson and allowed Hadjar his route into the sport.

The advantage Ricciardo offered was his years of experience on what by all accounts is a difficult car, and the fact he likes a pointy front end similar to Max and so set up wise they’d be more aligned. It would also give us an insight into just how far Max’s set up has taken the car, and also once and for all answered the Ricciardo question.
