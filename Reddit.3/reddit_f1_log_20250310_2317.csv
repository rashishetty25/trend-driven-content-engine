1j7w9un,[AMuS] Silver Arrow loses test race clearly,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j7w9un/amus_silver_arrow_loses_test_race_clearly/,2025-03-10, News,Translation in comments. ,"['I never trust Mercedes in pre-season', ""Last season, weather conditions influenced the cars' behaviour a lot. We'll see this year, but I wouldn't take the Bahrain testing results as a gospel of truth"", '> Mercedes analyzed the data from the test drives in Bahrain. The engineers found that the McLaren was significantly faster. But not all questions have been answered yet.\n\n> The Groundeffect era has not gone according to plan for Mercedes so far. With the introduction of the current regulations in 2022, the great series of successes ended after eight constructors\' cups in a row. For three years, the factory team searched in vain for a way back to success. George Russell and Lewis Hamilton did manage four victories last season. In the team standings, however, they were defeated by McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull by a relatively clear margin.\n\n> With the new AMG W16, they finally want to attack at the front again. The car has some aggressive changes - for example, the sidepods have ultra-narrow air intakes. On the front suspension, the track rod has been placed behind the wishbone, as was the case with McLaren last year. To do this, the engineers tested two new noses in Bahrain, which were used alternately. However, the team kept a secret how the two variants affect the handling and which nose will be used in Melbourne.\n\n> In general, the technicians drew a positive conclusion after the three days of testing. There were no concerns about reliability. The new W16 rolled around the desert circuit like clockwork. Only in the last morning session did the Silver Arrow suffer a small hiccup. A battery change meant that almost an hour was lost in the pits. Afterwards, it turned out that the change had not been necessary at all. A small electrical gremlin had led to an error message.\n\n> Otherwise, the engineers carried out the planned program almost completely. Because Mercedes did not hold the usual shakedown in Silverstone this year, it was not necessarily expected that the W16 would even secure the weekly best in the distance classification with 458 laps - just ahead of Haas (457) and Toro Rosso (456).\n\n> Expectations were also basically met in terms of performance. The data collected on the track corresponded to the values \u200b\u200bpreviously calculated in the simulations. The feedback from both drivers was accordingly positive. The engineers also expressed cautious optimism that the new W16 would no longer show the major fluctuations in form of its predecessor, which, depending on the conditions, sometimes drove all opponents into the ground and then lagged hopelessly behind again.\n\n> ""The team worked hard over the winter to improve the weaknesses of the W15. Judging by the first signs, we seem to have made good progress in these areas,"" said chief engineer Andrew Shovlin with satisfaction. In Bahrain, the drivers could not see any major outliers either up or down. The working window seems to have become larger, and the handling a little more stable. However, the temperature fluctuations on the three days in Bahrain were more moderate. It was never as cold as it was in Las Vegas last year or as hot as it was in Budapest. So it is still too early to give the all-clear.\n\n> But even if the internal performance targets have been achieved, that doesn\'t automatically mean that the new Silver Arrow is a World Championship candidate again. Formula 1 is a relative business. If the others develop even better, your own progress is of little use. In this case, McLaren seems to have pulled well ahead of its direct competitors. The Mercedes engineers were shocked to discover that the gap on the long runs was between half a second and a whole second.\n\n> In a direct comparison of the race simulations, George Russell would have finished 20 seconds behind Oscar Piastri, who was driving parallel on the final day. Andrea Kimi Antonelli shared the track with Lando Norris in his test race on the second day. In the end, he was half a minute behind. These are worlds of difference in Formula 1 that are not easy to make up.\n\n> It is only a small consolation that Mercedes was able to keep up with Ferrari and Red Bull in the chasing pack. All three teams hope that the changeable and sometimes very windy conditions in Bahrain were not representative and that the gap will automatically be reduced somewhat.\n\n> Ferrari also used the excuse that the SF-25 was carrying a lot of excess weight because of the many sensors. At Red Bull, the setup was not yet right. In addition, Max Verstappen did not use a comparable racing simulation. So there is still some room for improvement here.\n\n> Mercedes also did not appear to have a perfect set-up during its long runs. The engineers\' aim during the test drives was not to adapt the car to the Bahrain track as best as possible, but to try out as many settings as possible with a view to the rest of the season. In order to gain experience, they also went in extreme setup directions, which did not always lead to a positive result. The question is how close McLaren was to the ideal performance. The pursuers should not assume that the papaya racer has already reached its best form.', 'The only certainty is that McLaren are the quickest. My how much? Not certain. Who’s behind them? Even less certain. \n\nCan’t help feel the cool temperatures flatter Merc. When that was in play last season they were outright quickest. Otherwise they were 4th at best.', "">The data collected on the track corresponded to the values \u200b\u200bpreviously calculated in the simulations\n\nReal world data finally correlating to the simulations is Mercedes' version of Next Year"", 'His big a lead do we think Lando could build by the time the flexi regulation changes hit?\n\nCould be like last season but with max and co chasing Lando’s early lead down?', ""Didn't everybody think McLaren was doomed after testing last year?"", ""It was never realistic to expect them to fight the top 3 even with alot of positive changes. It's been a recurring theme now over the last 3 seasons that Merc don't know why their car isn't up there, and when it is up there, they don't know why it is up there. Like they know the 2024. car liked cold weather, but why exactly did it like cold weather so much it was useless without it remains a mystery and it seems like it's still the case for this year's car.\n\nThough it would be idiotic to take testing times for granted, or even other team's statements. Everyone likes to play underdog, everyone kind of writing off Ferrari already and saying it's McLaren's championship to lose, but Ferrari haven't really commented on the matter, just said it's all going in the right direction on all fronts. I'd wait until after Suzuka to make some educated predictions for the season.

I wanna ask you, who do you think is/was the best team to never win the world constructors championship?

Was it BAR who came 2nd in 2004 and to this day hold the record for the most podiums without a win as a constructor?

Or was it BMW Sauber who looked genuinely competitive at the beginning of 2008 but really dropped the ball in 2009 and then pulled out?

Was it Jordan who had a shot at the 1999 title despite their funding being far off the one from Ferrari and McLaren?

Was it Ligier who came home in 3rd and 2nd in 1979 and 1980 respectively?

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY “NEW”.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.
