That's usually where things go wrong for him."", 'My top picks would be Lando and Max. Max because ""the boy just goes and finds grip everywhere."" He somehow gets much better grip than anyone else. I think Turkey 2020 he had a bad start, but other than that he gets crazy wet starts. Just now in Australia you saw his start, Imola 2021 also comes to mind. \n\nFor Lando, the F1 youtube channel even made a video on his talent. Where Max is great in wet races, Lando is great at wet qualifying. The F1 youtube video shows how he takes unique lines and takes crazy amounts of kerb but somehow gains time while others avoid the kerb. Memorable moments are China last year where he qualified over a second faster than Lewis in second. Also Spa 2021 where he was dominating that qualifying session. In that race George even noticed Lando takes a very sharp line in turn 1 and he tried the same, getting a purple first sector and qualifying 2nd in a Williams.\n\nObviously there are other drivers good in the wet, for Lewis you could find lots of examples. It\'s just these 2 are very fast and consistent in their wet ability.', 'Gasly and Ocon were pretty incredible last year.', 'Lando Is actually pretty good , and I think this weekend proved It, a lot of people said he sucks but probably they were only looking at least 30 Laps in Brazil \nCarlos Is hit and miss, probably more miss (in terms of Walls more hit, he becomes carlost sainz)\nGeorge Is pretty decent as well', 'On the flip side, I\'m not sure that there\'s a known ""bad"" in the wets driver in F1 right now, other than the rookies who just don\'t have experience handling it.', 'Generally the British tend to do well, as do other drivers from similar climates.

Personally in my opinion the current grid is the best it has ever been in terms of talent but I'd definitely be open to the idea of being corrected.

You have absolute top tier talents in Verstappen, Leclerc, Hamilton, Russell, Norris, Piastri, Alonso, Sainz etc..the level below them as well is still extremely strong.

I don't recall an era where we had such a strong driver lineup.","['I‚Äôd say 2012 was a pretty amazing grid too.

Many other drivers on the grid in that season won races and had stable careers.\nOf course the number of seats was higher so it's partly to do with just a large crop of drivers and teams, and there's the benefit of all those careers having played out now fully, whereas we don't know where Hadjar or others might be in three years."", '1991\n\n***Ayrton Senna | Alain Prost | Nelson Piquet |*** *Nigel Mansell* *| Riccardo Patrese | Jean Alesi | Gerhard Berger | Roberto Moreno | Michael Schumacher | Andrea de Cesaris | Stefano Moden | Satoru Nakajima | Thierry Boutsen | Mark Blundell | Emanuele Pirro | Martin Brundle | Mika H√§kkinen | Bertrand Gachot | Johnny Herbert | Erik Comas | JJ Lehto | Pierluigi Martini | Gianni Morbidelli | Nicola Larini | Alex Caffi | Olivier Grouillard |  Mauricio Gugelmin | Ivan Capelli | Eric van de Poel | Gabriele Tarquini. | Aguri Suzuki | Karl Wendlinger*', 'I have a [model](https://f1mathematicalmodel.com/) to rate drivers, and to assess grid quality, I take the average of the top 4 drivers in a season and the average of the ""middle"" (9th-12th).
