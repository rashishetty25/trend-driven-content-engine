The F1 season currently has 24 races and while most circuits are locked in with multi-year contracts, there appears to be at least one available slot in 2027, with the Dutch Grand Prix to no longer be held after 2026 and the Belgian Grand Prix shifting to a bi-annual rotation.  Italy may also lose one of its current Grand Prix races, with the Imola expiring at the end of this season.

Thailand is not the only contender in the bidding race though, with rival submissions expected from organisers in South Africa and Rwanda. Authorities in South Korea and Argentina have also previously expressed interest.

It also hosts an annual MotoGP motorcycle race in Buriram in the east of the country, which generated US$140 million in economic circulation in 2024 and created close to 7,000 job positions at the circuit, according to the tourism authority.

A race in Bangkok would mean two annual races in the region, alongside the Singapore GP, which has been on the calendar in its Marina Bay circuit form since 2008. It was the first night race in the sport’s history and the first street race in Asia.

Helping make things harder to assess is the big variance in how they compared to each other from the beginning to the end of their time together.\n\nHe appeared to have a very good 2001 against Button, better than Ralf in 2000 against the same benchmark, but this is widely attributed to Button’s struggles in adapting to the woeful Benetton, as well as the team environment hurting Button mentally.\n\nFisi’s next two years were alongside rookies, then his 2004 was against a second-year Massa before he got the drive alongside Alonso.\n\nThere seem to have been several points prior to 2005 at which Fisichella’s stock was very high, and maybe one or two occasions (mainly 98) where it was somewhat lower. From 2005, his stock crumbled. But do we think that reflects how well he actually performed? \n\nWas his performance alongside Alonso a reflection of what he always was, or did his level vary? Did Ralf surpass him after 97? Is his indirect comparison to Heidfeld (via Massa) or a more refined Button (via Sato) a reliable basis for assessing him?', 'Can we swear this year?', 'Do you think Liam will help Red Bull get back it its winning ways?

Taking everything into account, I’d probably rate Fisichella slightly higher than Coulthard, or about on par with Ralf.', ""His performance against Kovalainen when he was expected to lead the charge of the post Alonso Renault also doesn't look good on him, before going back to the midfield and finding his mojo again at Force India.\n\nHis is a confusing case, you have to be pretty good under pressure to even make it to F1 but when handed a winning car he never found the pace he could exhibit in lesser cars. Is he a classic case of faltering under the pressure of winning? Or maybe Flavio's pressure never gave him the environment he needed to thrive, all this could've been answered if he had another team boss and a fast car."", ""I think Fisi was brilliant when giant killing in midfield car.

He crashed out of the lead of the 1999 European GP. \n\nWhen he got into a team expecting to win every race he mentally couldn't hack both that and not being as quick as his teammate.

1imyulw,Am I the only one actually optimistic for the F1 Movie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1imyulw/am_i_the_only_one_actually_optimistic_for_the_f1/,2025-02-11, Discussion,"Title. I feel like any post about the movie has half the comments being unneccessarily pessimistic. Calling it Driven on a higher budget. I feel like judging a movie from less than 3 minutes of promotional material is a bit odd, especially since just last year we had Transformers ONE which convinced everyone the movie would be terrible based on the marketing only for it to be a great film. Claiming a movie will be bad preemptively is just a little sad.

F1 fans in general seem to be under the impression this movie should only be for the extremely passionate fans who know every inch of the sport,otherwise it won't be good, when that's clearly not the case. Like any good fandom movie, it's designed to be something casual fans, experts, and people who vaguely know a guy named Lewis Hamilton can watch and enjoy. 

There's a lot of positives to take in my opinion. The Top Gun Maverick director is working on this one, so at the least the racing scenes should be fantastic and with Lewis helping out with production, they will try to maintain some degree of accuracy. They've also got the writer from the Transformers movies and Hans Zimmer working on it. I saw people whining about some of clips they've been recording, but we don't even know how those will look in post or if they'll even be in the movie, given they recorded clips of both Brad Pitt and Damson Idris winning in Abu Dhabi. They could always scrap or heavily edit them.

As for the plot, will it be like Rush or FordVFerrari? Absolutely not, because they aren't making a biopic, they're making a relvatively original plot that needs to not dumb it down too much to deter passionate fans nor make it so niche that casual viewers and the secondary audience aren't confused, which anybody would know is much more difficult than it sounds, especially with a fanbase as fickle as this one. Will there be some Hollywood cheesiness in it as a result? Of course there will be! But you can't disagree even some seasons in real life played perfectly straight with zero inaccuracies (something even Rush can't claim) would be accused of being ripped from Hollywood.

All I'm saying is, have a little faith. I will probably make a follow up to this with a review for the movie where I HOPE I'm not wrong.

TL;DR: A little more optimism would go a long way regarding the F1 Movie.","[""I'm looking forward to my movie debut, I'm sure if I get my magnifying glass out I'll be able to see my cameo in the silverstone crowd."", ""The estimated population of the world is over 8 billion.

what's to gain?

I remember rich energy that sponsored haas in drive to survive, but that thing isnt even in dollar stores. [Whatever that was really](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Energy#Brand_legitimacy), but at least they got their little spot in drive to survive.

but what about the rest?

edit: I think I got my answer , thanks everyone ( it's exposure, small, but still exposure. access to private events around and in the paddock for networking)

Some people believe Lando still doesn’t belong in that group despite taking 8 poles in 2024, which is laughable.

I also believe Bottas, Hulkenberg and Sainz are underrated over one lap. Probably the three drivers just behind the upper echelon. 

Hamilton and Alonso are also in that category, and I feel you could make an argument for Gasly and Ocon too.","['Verstappen and Leclerc. If Verstappen managed to finish his Saudi lap in...2021? 2022?
