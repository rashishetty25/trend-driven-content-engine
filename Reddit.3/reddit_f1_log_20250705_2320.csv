However, we do know that there was some contact between him and Horner in the past (but he turned Horner down).\n\nSince around April, we've repeatedly heard about Toto's intention to re-sign him which has led to some interesting quotes. In an interview around a month ago, George said that 2026 would be his 5th season with Mercedes only to be reminded by the interviewer of the lack of contract. In Austria, Toto said that the talks with Max had no impact on the talks with George, and this weekend, George has repeatedly suggested being teammates with Max and said that Toto never lied to him."", 'Horner uses his power of persuasion to sign both Lando and Oscar to RB leaving Zak dumbfounded and furious.', ""I cannot see GR to RBR happening for the simple reasoning being that you don't replace your outgoing driver with the driver he's replacing. In the eyes of global marketing, that's being the submissive dog picking up the scraps and it's precisely why no big team wanted to sign Carlos even though he was probably in the top 3 of available drivers that year."", 'Stroll seems to be pretty done himself.', 'Max to Merc\nGeorge to RB\nHadjar to RB\n\n\nHorner to Ferrari.\xa0\n\n\nMeaning\xa0\nToto will be TP to Max\nHorner will be TP to Lewis\xa0\n\n\nAnyone remember Abu Dhabi 21?
