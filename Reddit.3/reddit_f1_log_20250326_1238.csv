1jk29q7,How bad was 2019 Gasly compared to Lawson now?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jk29q7/how_bad_was_2019_gasly_compared_to_lawson_now/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"2019 Gasly scored just 63 points in his 12 races at Red Bull, with a highest finish of 4th. It is also possible that he complained about the car and that annoyed people within Red Bull. Lawson on the other hand has been out in Q1 twice in two races, 0 points and is constantly getting stuck behind backmarkers. So I'd say 2019 Gasly was significantly better than Liam Lawson and Liam was put up too soon, meaning he has performed like this.","[""Looking at points is misleadimg because the field spread was so much higher in 2019.\n\n\nAs an example:\xa0\n\n\nIn China in 2019, Gasly qualified 1.4s off Bottas's pole time. This still got him P6.\n\n\nThat same gap to pole in 2025 would get you scraping in to P17.\n\n\nIn 2019 the slowest Quali time in China (set by Kubica in that godawful Williams) was over 3.7s off the pole time.\n\n\nLawson's P20 in China was only 1.533s off pole. Yes, the car is different, but you get the idea. 1.5s from P1 to P20 is incredibly low."", 'The more interesting question is what happened to Albon who started relatively strong, especially if you compare him to Liam.\xa0He scored 76 points during his nine races in 2019 at Red Bull, compared to 97 for Verstappen and won the Rookie of the Year award. In 2020 he was doing ok but got in too many accidents(?), lost confidence and things went to pot.', 'Gasly argued with Newey his car was wrong of course he was fired', ""He was consistently in the points and in hindsight he wasn't as bad, but the benchmark at that point was Ricciardo and the expectation was to match Verstappen.\n\nNow years later Max isn't just a feisty young driver with a few wings anymore but a veteran 4 time world champion, and after him, Albon, Perez and Lawson the expectation has changed, and Gasly would those performances today would be more acceptable I think."", ""2025 and there's not more than a second between all 10 teams (maybe 9 sorry Sauber)\n\nWhat was the average spread between teams in 2019? \n\nYup, he's failed in that seat, big time. But he's actually been setup to fail in my opinion. \n\nHe's had F-All chance to practice or test and the car looks like it's the hardest to drive yet. \n\nWill be interesting to see how Yuki goes in the RB and how Liam goes back in the VCARB"", 'Gasly got points but he was miles away from the front. The field was a lot more spread out and Gasly was nowhere near his team mate. In his 12 races he had 2 DNFs, finished a lap down 5 times, was almost a lap down 2 times. Performances like that in the 2025 field would be on a par with Lawson', ""People forget that in 2018 and 2019 (probably 2017, can't remember) there was a huge gap between Top 3 Teams (Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull) and rest of the field. It was pretty much impossible for a non Top 3 car to finish inside the Top 6 without a Top 3 car having a DNF or problem.\n\nLook at Austria 2019: Top 5 is within 22 seconds but P6 is already a lap down down, but gasly finished P7 in a Top car.\n\nLook at China 2019: Top 5 is within 31 seconds, then there is Gasly in P6 another minute down.\n\nTHIS is why Gasly got replaced, not the absolute number of points, you can't compare it. The field is much much much closer today.\n\nAnother stat: in 2019 before Gasly got replaced all other 5 people in the Top 3 cars combined had **3** finishes outside the Top 5. Hamilton had a 1+ minute pitstop in Germany, Vettel had a collision and penalty in Silverstone, and Bottas had a collision and damage in Hungary. Gasly alone finished 6(!) times outside the Top 6 in 12 races."", 'Lawson had limited testing, limited practice at Australia and hadn’t driven the track before. He then went off in the wet on dry tires.\n\nHe hasn’t driven china either and had an hour’s practice before going straight into a qualifying session. It shouldn’t be surprising that a driver is struggling under those conditions and it’s a bit weird they didn’t at least give him this next race where he is very familiar with the track', 'What is the point of this comparison when there is a six year and one major regulation change between the two cars.']",537,179,0.86,537,165,165,111,23,0.010000000000000009,111

To be reintroduced today, the V10 must be detuned compared to back then, to fit inside the cost cap and the engine allocation limit. This reduces the power, and also the RPM, which was exactly what made the V10 sound good.\n\nAnother concern is the fuel tank. If it's naturally aspirated, it'll be far less efficient than the V6T + hybrid, so less power with more fuel consumption. If it's turbocharged, it probably needs more complex manifolds and bigger radiators than the V6T, so it'll be heavier, and due to the lack of hybrid it's probably still behind the current power unit in efficiency. Either case, the car will be carrying more fuel.\n\nSo I doubt the V10 will help make the cars smaller and lighter, or have higher power/weight ratio."", 'There is a lot of talks about regulation changes in 2026.

You have guys like Marko who cant shut his mouth and have one of the best, if not the best driver of all time as your teammate.\n\nTsunoda can only win if he gets that seat now i think.

At least his career would not be over instantly if it doesnt work out for him.', ""Yes they are, even if it seems cut throat and cruel.  \n\nIt seems clear the RB is a dog to drive. If Liam is kept there and is constantly getting knocked out Q1 and Q2 it will destroy him. Better to get him out now and get him in a less pressure seat if they do rate him. That way he can re-build his confidence. \n\nYuki is in a win-win situation to me. IF the car is as bad it seems and he drives badly. It is the cars fault, no one but a generational talent like VER can get anything out of it. IF Yuki gets results and gets to Q3 and Top 6 finishes in the RB then he is showing the grid he can drive and he may get a shot at a seat next year. The only way this is bad for him is if he drives worse than Perez was and Liam is now, and if he does... well he doesn't deserve the seat. \n\nFor RBR, If Liam cannot handle the car currently they need someone else in there quick who can. They cannot afford to be cut adrift from the WCC this early and Yuki is the safest option for handling the car. \n\nIt is 100% a risk, but it is the right choice for all concerned in my opinion."", ""It's kinda cruel that they're not gonna at least let him get a shot at a track he's raced at before.

Vips didn't work out which meant Liam was the next best option from that batch. Liam didn't have a great F2 so they sent him to DTM/SF where he did pretty well. Horner wanted Checo to work out or Daniel as Plan B. After things didn't work out and after Yuki had some rough/unlucky races in Austin/Mexico it went to Liam. Also Horner was not big on Yuki in general for ages probably because of the Honda pull out drama\n\nIf we really want to believe they are objective and stuff, Liam was pretty impressive in 2023 standing in for Daniel without a lot of notice especially coming from strong adaptability in SF/DTM.

Last year there were few reports on how Lawson was supposed to be in Racing Bulls seat in 2024 by the second half or else he was going to leave the academy. That's why Ricciardo went out so unceremoniously from the team, as the team didn't want to lose Lawson and they couldn't kick Perez or Tsunoda for x number of reasons.\n\nAs for push into the main team, I personally believe it's not they wanted Lawson, but rather didn't want Tsunoda in. Going on from reports again, how Tsunoda was given the last year end testing time at Red Bull thanks to Honda and Red Bull by that time had no interest in him and were just catering Honda's last request of sorts.""]",0,128,0.47,0,1263,1263,0,0,0.0,0

Some big names with great primes that come to mind for me are Ricciardo and Massa. Granted, I haven't been watching as far back as their primes so I wouldn't know, but it truly feels like we have another uncrowned Champion in the making. 

Charles might have had mistakes earlier in his career but it really feels like he ironed them out last season and performs every race week. It's only early in his career but its possible we'll never see him lift the WDC Trophy despite being apparently more deserving than other names like Russel, Norris, or Piastri.
