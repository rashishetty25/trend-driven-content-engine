1mek52g,Hungarian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mek52g/hungarian_grand_prix/,2025-08-01, News,"Weather forecast for the weekend. This event in 2006 saw Button get his first F1 race win. 


The Hungarian Grand Prix in 2006 marked the last occasion the event was held in wet conditions. The track was already wet at the beginning of the race, making it a historic first for a wet Hungarian Grand Prix. 
All competitors started on intermediate tires, except for Barrichello, who opted for full wets. 

Early on, polesitter Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen quickly established his lead. Both Alonso and Schumacher delivered impressive climbs through the field. Schumacher advanced from 11th to 6th by the first corner, while Alonso moved up from 15th with a notably aggressive and hard-fought opening lap. Alonso then engaged in a straight fight with Schumacher for several laps before executing a pass on the outside of Turn 5, securing 3rd place. He further progressed to take the lead after the McLaren drivers, Pedro de la Rosa and R√§ikk√∂nen, made their pit stops. 

Traditionally, Bridgestone wet-weather tires were dominant in non-dry conditions, but in this race, the Japanese compound appeared to be an exception. All drivers using Bridgestone tires, including those from Ferrari, struggled with significantly reduced pace compared to their rivals. Schumacher found himself battling Giancarlo Fisichella for 5th place, ultimately losing his front wing in a mid-corner incident while fending off snap-oversteer, resulting in a forced pit stop that put him a lap down. Soon after, Jenson Button showcased remarkable overtaking prowess, passing Massa, Fisichella, and Schumacher in under two laps. R√§ikk√∂nen, facing difficulties on his second set of tires, crashed into the rear of Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso, launching the car and necessitating a safety car period. This incident allowed Alonso to pit, enabling Schumacher to regain the lead lap. 
Another beneficiary of the safety car was Jenson Button, who chose not to pit and climbed to 2nd position behind Alonso. Following the safety car restart, Button challenged Alonso, but eventually had to pit for fuel. Alonso maintained the lead, but a subsequent pit stop for dry tires proved disastrous as his right-rear wheel nut detached, causing him to lose control and crash. 

Button inherited the lead and held it unchallenged for the remainder of the race. Schumacher made his way up to 2nd by remaining on intermediate tires as other drivers made further stops.

And not having the time and resources to updating their cars to narrow the gap to McLaren. 

Or is their advantage something that the other teams still don‚Äôt know yet and could well be an advantage in 26, especially tyre management. ","[""They built a car that can spend an entire race in dirty air, has better tyre management than everyone else and is good in all weather conditions and unlocks new insane speed in the rain. \n\nIn short, it's voodoo."", 'I think teams have probably figured out what McLaren‚Äôs advantage is at this point and how to emulate it to some extent, but given that this is the final year for these regs (and the cost cap) they‚Äôre probably opting to focus on 2026 instead', 'Even if it is something McLaren have figured out that the others teams dont is highly unlikely it‚Äôll remain an advantage into the new regs, the cars are changing so much and even a small change can alter the performance massively', 'Didnt McLaren basically get a shiny state of the art wind tunnel around the same time they finished fourth in the constructors (giving them more time) and have been on an upwards swing since \n\nRed Bull also hit a ceiling with the RB19 and have struggled with the RB20 design \n\nI suspect many others are diverting more and more resources now though, Ferrari and Merc are probably close to writing off the year (if not already) to focus on 26', ""No, the advantage was there from the very beginning of the year.\n\nRegarding 2026, given the speculation about the Mercedes PU lead and based on the McLaren's ability to best figure out aerodynamical and mechanical side of the car, they're supposed to have advantage over the other teams again."", 'I think it‚Äôs a mix of different factors. Yes the new regulations in 26 are playing a part, but not to the point where it explains everything.\n\nLast year McLaren won the constructors title by 14 points over Ferrari.

Meanwhile Mercedes may have finally gotten a car relatively stable enough to not porpoise the entire race, and Red Bull has made a car that‚Äôs quick but outside of Max Verstappen (and sometimes with him) it‚Äôs a fight to handle on its good days. The directions the teams took with the concepts are another important key in what‚Äôs happened this year.', ""Think it's just normal at the end of a regs package, whoever was best in 24 was likely to be best this year.

It won't be an issue. Their current advantage is that they have insane tyre management with consistent pace and downforce no matter the track or ride height.
