1l88cjh,"Opinion: For as important as tire life and tire temperatures are for the sport, they do a horrible job presenting these numbers on TV.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l88cjh/opinion_for_as_important_as_tire_life_and_tire/,2025-06-10, Discussion,"Every race, especially during the Pirelli era, has been about tire management. In every race, the big discussion is about temperatures, how much life is left in them, their pressures, and so on. Since they got rid of refueling, it’s the only tactical component left in the race.

It’s the most important factor in how the race will play out. How come F1 hasn’t made an effort to present those figures like temperatures and pressures on the feed?

I know they had a brief period with thermal cams, but as cool as they looked, they didn’t really convey anything other than that tires get hot in corners or cold during a Safety Car period.

I’m convinced that if the information were publicly available, it would a) be super cool to know more about components of the car, and b) add an intriguing instrument to race tactics.

I know teams will hate it, but F1 management has the power to spice things up and give (hardcore) fans something interesting to study during the race.

What are your opinions?","['Assuming this requires team to share information (as tire wear effects each team differently) and they definitely don’t want to give that away.', ""They need to abstract it so much to make it digestible for anyone other than very, *very* hardcore viewers that it becomes meaningless in itself. It'll misinform casual viewers and piss off hardcore ones because it's just not really correct. They tried to make an abstract depiction of tyre performance in the 2019-2020 seasons and it was very poorly received, and including figures that are meaningless to 99% of the viewing public (with the remaining 1% likely not actually understanding them, either, even if they tell themselves they do) isn't the solution."", ""I agree but tire life is such a nuanced thing that it would be hard to actually display any information consistently across all 20 cars. You can't display a percentage of life remaining like the F1 games, because it would be speculation. You could put some little symbol for when graining started, or a hot/cold symbol for that, but beyond those things how would you recommend they really display it any more than they already do with the data page?"", 'They tried to with AWS data but it was typically very wrong and made AWS look very useless as a platform.', ""Because it's in the interest of each team to keep that information confidential during a race.

F1 used to have thermal camers and the teams didnt like that, so they removed it\n\nBut also F1 is extremely technical i think that is also one of the main reason why the journalists are just posting rubbish.
