And why should they, they don’t need to. There’s no other seats open for their drivers to leave for. \n\nI still think it should be Max and Isack at RBR next year though, the new reg cycle is the best chance for him to learn the new car alongside Max and with his data, instead of coming in in 2027 when Max already has experience with it.', 'Lawson is just 9 points behind Hadjar.', ""This team eats drivers and the fan base just lets them keep getting away with it.

1ojz8x5,Championship Standings and Eliminations - Mexico GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ojz8x5/championship_standings_and_eliminations_mexico_gp/,2025-10-30, Statistics,"**WDC:** There were no eliminations in the WDC this race, with Russell remaining in contention. To remain in contention after Brazil, he will need to outscore Norris by 15 points and Piastri by 16. For him to win the championship, he would need to win every race from now on, and hope that Norris scores no more than 17 points, Piastri no more than 18, and Verstappen no more than 53 over all remaining races.

Despite Norris retaking the lead in WDC by one point, Piastri remains ahead in number of wins. This means that whichever McLaren scores the most points in Brazil will walk away with the lead, even if Piastri only outscores Norris by 1 point. The singular exception to this would be if Norris scores 0 in the sprint and wins the race, while Piastri wins the sprint and is 2nd in the race. In that case, both drivers would end the weekend on 382 points and tied on 7 wins. Norris would then be ahead on 2nd place countback, with 8 to Piastri's 4.

It is not currently possible for a driver to clinch before Abu Dhabi simply by winning everything. If Norris were to win everything and Piastri come 2nd in everything, they would go into Abu Dhabi separated by 24 points, making it technically possible for Piastri to win in the final race.

**WCC:** Ferrari outscored Mercedes just enough to retake 2nd by 1 point, and while Red Bull did outscore Mercedes, it was only by 1 point (I'm sensing a 1 point theme here...). This means that once again, 2nd place is on offer for all three teams:

* Ferrari needs to outscore (or score the same as) Mercedes and not be outscored by 10 or more points by Red Bull to retain 2nd
* Mercedes needs to outscore Ferrari by any amount and not be outscored by Red Bull by 9 or more points to retake 2nd
* Red Bull needs to outscore Ferrari by at least 10 points and Mercedes by at least 9 to move up to 2nd

Williams is also officially out of the fight for 2nd, and will now have to settle for a best possible finish of 5th.

^(Note: the best and worst finishing positions are rough calculations, and assume that multiple drivers can finish in the same position. Obviously this is not possible, but there are) *^(670 billion scoring possibilities in each GP)* ^(and) *^(5 billion in each sprint;)* ^(so it's not exactly practical to figure out the true best and worst positions. (If you're interested, there are 2 billion billion, or 2 quintillion finishing possibilities per race...)^)","[""Something that gets overlooked a little is that the battle for P6 is super close with the 4 teams VCARB, Aston, Haas and Sauber all within 12 points of each other.

We really lost him to the mothership of red flags.', ""Some excerpts that I thought were of note from the interview:\n\n\n**Ferrari Magazine: How did it feel, that first moment you sat in the Ferrari SF-25?**\n\n\n>**Lewis Hamilton:** *Well, I’m in a different place in my life. I’m 40 now and I was 21 the first time I sat in an F1 car. To come from where I’ve come from, from watching F1 on TV, aspiring to race at the top level, to getting into an F1 car with the people around you, the mechanics and all the machinery… And then to be dropping myself into a red car 20 years later, **it was a lot more emotional**. **When I was 21 it wasn’t an emotional thing, it was ‘exciting’**, because everything was firing inside me. **When you get in the Ferrari, it’s love**. You make a different connection.*\n\n\n**FM: Surely anyone who knows anything about how Formula One works knows that it takes time…**\n\n>**LH:** *…And that’s not many people.

What influence did he have on you?**\n\n>**LH:** ***When I got to F1, Niki was part of a world that couldn’t adapt to me being different, and I heard negative things, though I’d always had an admiration for him as a three-time world champion. He’s one of the true icons of our sport. Then he’s on the phone telling me why I should come to the team [Mercedes], and then when we finally met we had a really good conversation. He said, “You’re just like me, you’re a racer to the core.” It wasn’t until we had that meeting that those barriers came down, that the stereotyped view he may have had was dealt with. After that we would travel to races together and he’d fly us places all the time.***\n\n\n**FM: Did you educate him?**\n\n>**LH:** ***I think we educated each other. He had the best stories, and we used to laugh so much together. And he was a fighter, literally until his last breath. It was unbelievable for me to see how hard he fought. We’d send video messages to each other, and right to the end he was fighting, saying “I’m coming back…” I loved him for that.***\n\n\n**FM: What do you say to those who suggest that this extra-curricular stuff is a distraction? (referring to his off track passions like music and fashion)**\n\n>**LH:** *It’s not a question of distraction. Everyone can get distracted, one way or another. It’s about how you decide to deploy your energy and create a sense of balance. **You’ve got to have a creative balance, you can’t just work every hour of your life because you’ll be miserable. How do you find things that inspire you and keep you uplifted? Tapping into your creativity is one way.***\n\n\n**FM: Your Mission 44 Foundation is continuing to promote diversity and improve education and opportunities in schools. Are you happy with the progress that’s being made?**\n\n>**LH:** *The work never stops. (He pauses). I was fortunate to meet Nelson Mandela. He was pushing and fighting for others until his last day. **Lead with intention. Don’t lower yourself to some of the levels that some people like to stoop to. Like Michelle Obama said, “They go low, we go high”.** Every meeting I have with a potential partner, I ask what they’re doing about impact. It will be a challenge as long as I live and there will be other fights along the way, too.*\n\n\n**FM: Do you have a full slate of upcoming projects? (About his film production company, Dawn Apollo)**\n\n>**LH:** *We have some ideas. I’m in the process of figuring it out but storytelling is something I’m really passionate about. **More than ever, we need inspirational stories out there, given the dark times we live in. I love comedy and I’ve got a particular idea for a television show. I’m working on a couple of animation movie ideas**, and we’re getting sent so much stuff since the F1 movie happened it’s crazy. **But it’s not about doing lots and lots of projects, it’s more like Quentin Tarantino does it, quality rather than quantity.***\n\n^(Please note that I've only included questions and answers that I personally thought were of importance.
