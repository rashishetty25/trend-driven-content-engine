It makes me wonder: do we as fans (and maybe even F1 itself) treat sprint race wins as if they don‚Äôt count? They show up in the stats, but when people talk about ""race wins,"" they clearly mean only Grand Prix wins.

So are sprint victories basically meaningless in the grand scheme of things, or should they be recognized as real wins just like a GP? And if they are meaningless, then why is F1 so hellbent on adding more sprint races every season?

Curious to hear what others think.","[""Do they show up in the stats? The FIA don't count Sprints as race sessions. Same for Sprint Q I believe."", 'drivers openly say that getting a sprint podium is ""not a real podium"" and getting a sprint win is ""not a real win""\n\noscar piastri said it when he started with mclaren and got sprint podiums and sprint wins before real race podiums and wins, and hamilton also said it when he got his china sprint win', 'They are a motor race, but in the context of F1 i would always assume ""wins"" to refer to grand prix wins.\n\nSprints are not considered as very meaningful and i think even drivers dont generally care much about them. The point structure also supports that.', 'They do count for points. (Albeit partially)', 'Regardless of spectator opinion, the FIA sporting regs use the term ""sprint session"" never ""sprint race,"" and the term ""race"" is always referring to the GP.\n\nExample from article 3.2:\n> \n> Competitors must ensure that their cars comply with the conditions of eligibility and safety throughout each free practice session, qualifying session, sprint qualifying session, sprint session and the race.\n\nAnd article 5.4 (emphasis mine):\n> \n> **The distance of all races**, from the start signal referred to in Article 44.10 to the end-of-session signal referred to in Article 59.1, **shall be equal to the least number of complete laps which exceed a distance of 305km**, with the exception of the two following circumstances:\n> \n> a) The distance of the race in Monaco shall be equal to the least number of complete laps which exceed a distance of 260km.\n> \n> b) If the formation lap is started behind the safety car (see Article 49) the number of race laps will be reduced by the number of laps carried out by the safety car minus one.', 'Yes.
