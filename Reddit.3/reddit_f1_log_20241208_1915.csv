Valtteri Bottas will race his last F1 race on Sunday, at least for now.\n\nHeikki Kulta\n\n7.12. 14:33\n\nOn 15 November 2011, Valtteri Bottas drove an F1 car on a race track for the first time. The stage was the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi. On Sunday, the 35-year-old Finnish driver will drive his last F1 race on the same track.\n\nThirteen years ago, then GP3 champion Bottas had only gained F1 experience in advance from two straight tests at the Kemble circuit in England. Sunday marks the 246th race of his F1 career.\n\nBut Bottas, who has been the last Finnish driver on the grid for the last three seasons, refuses to think that after the final race he will say goodbye to the F1 pace he loves.\n\n**- I have a feeling that I\'m not finished with this sport. I still have a lot to give, so I\'m going to see this through to the end of this card,"" Bottas asserted in a telephone interview on Saturday morning ahead of the day\'s challenges.**\n\nAfter five years with Mercedes as Lewis Hamilton\'s teammate, Bottas moved to the Sauber team, which operated under the Alfa Romeo banner, in 2022 for virtually nothing more than top positions.\n\nFrederic Vasseur, who had led the Finn to success in the minor leagues, was team principal in 2022, but after he moved to Ferrari for 2023, Sauber has since gone without a team boss.\n\nSo Bottas\' first three-year F1 contract did not turn out to be the best of his career?\n\n**- Certainly not. If I could go back three years, I would have switched to somewhere else. Unfortunately, that\'s the way it is. It was a big mistake, but it\'s hard to predict these things in advance,"" Bottas sighed.**\n\n*Valtteri Bottas was spraying bubbly in his mouth after winning the Russian GP in spring 2017, when he was a Mercedes man.*\n\n**- That first year with Vasseur was a good one. The team spirit was good and the results were pretty good. The last two seasons since then have been a bit downhill all the way. Of course, that also affects my image as a driver. If you can\'t show results, you kind of forget your name.**\n\nUnder Vasseur in 2022, Bottas finished in the top 10 in the drivers\' championship with 49 points - his best result was fifth place at Imola. The team finished sixth in the Manufacturers\' World Championship. In 2023, the standings started to collapse, and in this record-breaking season Bottas is still at zero on the eve of the final race.\n\n**- This season has been undeniably awful. In 2022, when Vasseur and I set the targets and how to achieve them, we had a clear plan. But when he left, all the goals and plans were really scrapped. Since then it has been much more challenging.**\n\nIn Qatar, Bottas scored his best finish of the season in 11th place, which lifted him out of the drivers\' championship, past Logan Sargeant.\n\nBottas says it was that race that was his biggest disappointment of the season.\n\n**- The team sacrificed me quite rudely there, and offered Guanyu Zhou the better tactics that got us the points. It was just a case of seeing which car was ahead, got the priority, and that\'s why they stopped me earlier to help my teammate. There went my chances of finishing in the top ten. I\'ve learnt a lot of things this season and my skin has tanned from it.**\n\nValtteri Bottas feels that the team sacrificed him for another driver.', 'He god fucked when Fred left. He was Vasseur driver and while Fred rated him high Seidl was exact opposite. Will be interesting to see how it goes to Hulk since he was Seidl signing and not a Binotto one.

He's helped me to improve in so many areas, his work ethic, his talent, just everything he brings. The discipline he has, he's been just such an incredible team-mate. And I think if today, I will repeat myself, but if today we have done such a step forward in a year and in these four years, it's a big thanks to Carlos. He's just been extremely quick.\xa0\n\n\nAnd in Formula 1, as Lando said, some things you don't really have explanations for. There's also luck that is involved to be at the right place at the right time and Carlos definitely deserves to be in a top team. But I'm sure that it's just a matter of time before he comes back and joins us to fight for wins. He will give so much to Williams, the way he's so sensitive to every small change and every small feeling there is in the car. I'm pretty sure that already tomorrow they will have a lot of valuable feedback that will help them for next year.\xa0\n\n\nBut yeah, I'll definitely miss the fights. We've had our moments on track, but that's only because we were fighting so close together and because he's been pushing me all the way. And it's been an absolute pleasure. And of course, in some moments, in the actual moment, in the present moment, there's frustration. But I'm sure that, and actually already now, I'm looking back at those moments. with a lot of positive memories. And I wouldn't be the driver I am today without him as my team-mate in the last four years.\xa0\n\n\nSo yeah, it's been a really big pleasure and four years that I will be looking back in the most positive way. And I wish him the best. But as I said, I have no doubts that he will be back at the top of the grid, whether it's with Williams by his input or with someone else. But he deserves that.

Which drivers have you changed your opinion on after this season? Good, bad or otherwise?

For me

The Mclaren drivers- I expected Oscar to be closer to Lando this year but Lando has proven to be quicker than I thought and Oscar has not made the overall improvement I expected.

Yuki- I expected Yuki and Daniel to be close but Yuki has proven to be a much more rounded driver than I previously thought.

Colapinto- Never really seen or heard much of him,but despite some late crashes he showed some good pace out there this season



","[""Oscar is my second favorite driver but hes been very disappointing this season. Outqualified 20-4 with one of those winnings being in Baku where Lando had to lift. 0 poles to Lando's 8 and made a lot of mistakes in both races and qualifying.

He hasn't had a horrible season but after 2 long seasons he hasnt really improved his baseline pace compared to lando which is notoriously something you either have or don't. I think next year will be defining for him and if he's still consistently slower, teams won't be looking at him as a potential driver to lead a WDC charge.\n\nLeclerc impressed me a lot with his mentality and cutting out the occasional mistakes from his previous seasons. Also how much he seemed to care about winning the WCC. I don't think many drivers would show such passion or be so devastated to not win it for the team. The combination of speed + a true team player is extremely rare in F1 and very impressive."", ""I thought Piastri would be better.

1h95kr0,The lazy narrative of ‚Äúno team makes one of their drivers slower‚Äù (Lewis & George),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h95kr0/the_lazy_narrative_of_no_team_makes_one_of_their/,2024-12-07, Discussion,"In another thread, someone quoted from Harris‚Äôs podcast that no team EVER wants to slow down a driver in relation to the ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù that Lewis is being sabotaged. This is such a lazy narrative. 

Taking the conspiracies aside, what most people are suggesting isn‚Äôt that Mercedes have purposely slowed Lewis down, but they have favoured George, which has, by default, given him an advantage.

It is clear that all teams, on many weekends, have two unequal cars due to upgrades being given to only one of their drivers. It is therefore absolutely feasible that George got every upgrade first. And it would be understandable that they chose George given Lewis is leaving. That‚Äôs not making Lewis directly slower, but it is likely making George faster. 

On several occasions this season, it has been acknowledged Lewis is running the experimental setup, including Toto saying that today. That‚Äôs not necessarily making Lewis slower, but it is probably making him slower than George. 

Some people seek every reason to put Lewis down (as many do to max and every other driver). Others will be wilfully blind to their favourite drivers flaws.

It could be that Lewis has just drifted off motivation wise. It could be that he has genuinely dropped in form, be it permanently or temporarily.

But the drop off from a clear outperformance of George last year is quite substantial. And I cannot believe that it‚Äôs 100% of Lewis. 

There is a difference between sabotage and favouritism. 

There is also absolutely the motivation to show your investors that your new number 1 is better than the driver who decided to leave. That‚Äôs the CEO 101, not a conspiracy. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, I think Mercedes has been poorly led for a few years now, and I think they really let Lewis down this year. ","[""It's the opposite with Mercedes. They had a full upgrade they gave to both drivers in Austin, but it didn't work as they thought. George crashed his car and damaged the upgrades, so he was given the old floor and spec. \n\nLewis was stuck racing the upgrade because the team needed more data and feedback on the upgrades.

Lewis has almost 20 years of experience, which could be a hinderance when trying to get the most out of these cars.\n\nSo yeah, some of it might be down to the car moving away from Lewis, some of it could be aging, some of it could be motivation but I think consideration should also be given to Russell just getting better.

1h9j4kj,Penalties,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h9j4kj/penalties/,2024-12-08, Discussion,"Hey everyone. I'm just curious to see if I'm the only person who thinks F1 penalties have gotten ridiculous. I get that sometimes they are warranted but when there is a racing incident in the 1st corner on the opening lap of the race and absolutely nothing flagrant, there's no need for a penalty. Contact happens, it is racing after all. I guess being a Nascar fan I expect drivers to always race hard and not have to ""be careful"" around others competing for a manufacturer championship...that kind of careful driving, in my opinion, should only apply when one is being lapped. If they're racing for position...well...they should be allowed to actually race! I guess that aligns nicely with F1's extreme pretentiousness....","['Crofty and Brundle said that the penalties have been harsher recently because the drivers asked for it, specifically when it comes to running into other cars', '5 second penalties were largely irrelevant last season so they discouraged nothing.  10 second penalties are appropriate IMO.', ""> Contact happens, it is racing after all.\n\nCorrect, which is why racing incidents are not penalized.\n\nPenalties exist to *encourage* people to race and not endanger lives and bomb into people like it's a Forza lobby"", '""Rubbing is racing"" is a closed wheel thing, not open wheel, and especially not F1. You don\'t see the indycars touch on ovals like the stock cars do, people could die.', '>""being a NASCAR fan""\n\nSo, I do mean this respectfully, but NASCAR is far more about the entertainment aspect than F1 is. And by ""entertainment"" I mean ""people watch NASCAR because of the wrecks, so NASCAR looks the other way on wrecking.""\n\nAs much as we all love Days of Thunder, rubbing *ain\'t* racing in this world. Open wheel cars are a lot more sensitive to contact than cars with fenders are. Most of the time, wheel to wheel contact means someone is going airborne, so stewards penalize dangerous driving a lot more harshly than series with closed wheels. \n\nImo, if drivers don\'t want a penalty, don\'t do moves that require a wreck to happen for the move to be completed. The move that Max did in the first turn *is* considered a flagrant move in bad taste in this world, and it *absolutely* needed a penalty.
