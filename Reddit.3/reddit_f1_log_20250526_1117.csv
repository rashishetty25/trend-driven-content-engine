1kv5ujm,Something‚Äôs off between Hamilton and Adami ‚Äì how long can this go on?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kv5ujm/somethings_off_between_hamilton_and_adami_how/,2025-05-25, Discussion,"There has been tension between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer Riccardo Adami since he joined Ferrari, and the Monaco GP seems to have brought it to the surface again.

**Let‚Äôs rewind.**  
In qualifying, Adami told Hamilton that Verstappen was *‚Äúon a push lap,‚Äù* then immediately said he was *‚Äúslowing down.‚Äù* In reality, Verstappen *was* pushing. Hamilton ended up impeding him and received a three-place grid drop.

**During the race (Lap 76 of 78):**  
Hamilton asked:

>‚ÄúAre they still ahead by a minute?‚Äù  
Adami replied:  
‚ÄúCharles on medium, McLaren on hard. Lapping ‚Äò16 very close to each other fighting.‚Äù  
Hamilton responded:  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not answering the question. It doesn‚Äôt really matter I guess. I‚Äôm just asking if I‚Äôm a minute behind or?‚Äù  
Adami then clarified:  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 48 seconds.‚Äù

**Post-race:**  
Hamilton asked quietly:

>‚ÄúAre you upset with me or something?‚Äù   
No response.

**Context matters.**  
This isn‚Äôt the first awkward moment between the two. In Melbourne, Hamilton told Adami *‚Äúleave it to me‚Äù* when he received repeated reminders about engine modes. In Miami, he criticised the team for delayed team orders with the sarcastic, *‚ÄúHave a tea break while you‚Äôre at it.‚Äù*

Hamilton has said publicly that there‚Äôs no issue and that these are normal race situations. But with repeated miscommunications and visible frustration, questions are beginning to surface.

Is this a case of two people still learning to work together, or is there a deeper mismatch in communication styles? Could Ferrari‚Äôs overall decision-making be contributing to the problem? Is it time for a change, or does this just need more time?

Curious to hear what others think.","[""Lewis's radio was painful all day long. Idk what was wrong with Adami today but he was even more awkward than usual. It was like listening to the Vettel days with him."", 'Look at vettel and Adami(he ordered Ricky sometimes instead of other way around), Carlos and Adami(las Vegas 2024) the miscommunication has been eternal at that position.\n\nEDIT:  \n""Wake up guys, come on!""  \n""Tell it to him in Spanish""  \n""What are these two guys doing? They are not unlapping themselves, they need togo.  \nAdami: ""They restart like this. Treat them as lapped cars.""  \n""Stay out, stay out. No, box, box, box, box!"" Sainz: ""Make up your mind, guys!"" (silverstone 22)  \n\xa0""No, not inters! I told you, straight to slicks!""

His response was pretty telling:\n\n> ‚ÄúThe information wasn‚Äôt exactly that clear. I didn‚Äôt really understand ‚Äòthis is our race.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt know what I was fighting for‚Ä¶ I used up my tires a lot in that moment, but I was so far away from \\[the cars ahead\\] anyway.‚Äù\n\nThis lines up with the broader pattern from Monaco and earlier races; unclear communication, vague timing, and a lack of shared understanding on what the actual goal is.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just about tone or chemistry between driver and engineer. If Hamilton is burning through tyres without knowing who he‚Äôs racing, that suggests something deeper: a breakdown in how strategy is communicated and understood in real-time. Especially when it‚Äôs happening race after race."", ""As bad and awkward as all of this sounds, i wonder if Adami himself is getting Ferrari'd over the comms by his team. all we hear is LH<-->Adami, but Adami has to contend with everything Ferrari throw at him."", ""They might replace Adami at some point but for me this is all a symptom of something bigger, Ferrari has been utterly dysfunctional for so long that they don't even look at themselves and question what they're doing here.

There seemed to be a fair few misunderstandings over the course of the race.

The most glaring example was them not understanding what the Racing Bulls were doing with their strategy. Crofty thought Lawson was simply incapable of driving faster, whereas Brundle believed it was a strategic decision but for some reason thought it was intended to benefit Verstappen. It wasn't until Lap 20 when Ted commented how Hadjar had both pits stops out of the way that they seemed to get it.

In comparison, the F1TV guys not only predicted the Racing Bull strategy when the gap began forming early on in the race, but they also predicted RB would repeat the process. I find their ability to call the team/driver intentions adds meaningfully to the viewing experience.

It wasn't interesting to watch and somehow made Monaco even more boring to watch.

1kvon1d,Is Antonelli performing beneath expectations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvon1d/is_antonelli_performing_beneath_expectations/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"This post might bring controversy, but I think young Kimi is performing slightly worse than expected, further overshadowed by all the praise about Hadjar recently. So far he has less than half the points of GR, 0-10 vs GR in race/sprint h2h, and 2-8 in qualifying h2h.

GR is great, and honestly I don‚Äôt think race pace, mistakes, (like losing the lead at the sprint) or even crashes are worrying, but it‚Äôs the raw pace that he has yet to show. In my understanding, speed is mostly not taught, and most great drivers become competitive in qualifying just about immediately. I think it is slightly concerning that Kimi has mostly struggled with qualifying thus far other than in Miami.

Can anyone who has followed him through his junior career give some input on how we should view his performance thus far?

Edit: after reading some responses, I admit it‚Äôs my expectations of him being a generational talent that are too high and not fair. Hopefully he will get plenty of lease at Merc to develop!","['We‚Äôve seen with most rookies they burn bright and then start to wreck hard.\n\nIt‚Äôs important Kimi has a lowkey year to get used to the car, the team and how to race in F1.\n\nOnce you start crashing you‚Äôre putting a massive target on your back so as long as he can avoid that he will have had a successful rookie year imo.\n\nLet‚Äôs not forget the Mercedes isn‚Äôt particularly competitive this year and also GR is constantly underrated as a driver. His nickname is/was Mr Saturday for a reason.', ""He's doing fine. 1 crash at Monaco Q1 and a spin in terrible conditions at Melbourne \n\nA pole and top 3 qualifying at miami. Has been unfortunate with SC and strategy \n\nI hope he gets a new deal official by Monza"", ""Hadjar wouldn't be doing any better. It should be obvious that Russell is a far more difficult team mate to match/beat than Lawson."", ""He's exceeding my expectations. Russell is a top driver, so for Antonelli to be close to competitive against him as an 18 year old rookie is better than I expected."", 'He literally got pole 2 races ago, some people can only remember what happened last race lol', ""No.\n\nSince the beginning of the season this is his first crash/incident  (obviously Imola being out of his hands), he is a fast driver and performing as expected in Mercedes.  He also lost the lead to drivers like Piastri, Verstappen, Norris - so not fair to judge on that.\n\nComparing Hadjar & Antonelli's H2H is also not fair, Lawson doesn't even have a full season yet and not on the level of GR who is on his 4th season in Mercedes."", '> is the 18 year old rookie underperforming against a seasoned no1 at mercedes who just beat lewis hamilton in the season before?\n\njust give it time. he really is looking strong enough for an 18 year old rookie.', ""He performs as expected. \n\nIf you expected the next Verstappen, then it's underwhelming.\n\nIf you expected a rookie who had top showings in F4 and F3.5 but neither in F3 (skipped) nor in F2 being put in a Mercedes against an established top driver going head to head, you were mistaken. \n\nHe had lots of testing in 2 year old cars, but he skipped at least 2 career stations (F3 and backmarker F1 teams) and it's showing. He wasn't ready and now needs at least 2-3 years to get there. \n\nSimilar to Piastri, who was coming in as a back2back2back champion (in strong fields in my opinion) and at least 3500km of testing in Alpine. Piastri was not great in his first season, worked on his tyre management for the 2nd season and worked on qualifying on his third season. It took over 50 races to get there. \n\nGive Kimi time. He is a bit too over hyped and too rushed, but if Toto doesn't throw him under a bus as fast as he promoted him, he can develop. \n\nHe performs as experts reasonable expected."", ""There is literally no rookie, no matter how good they are, that'll consistenly match a driver like George Russell in their first year. Piastri also lacked raw speed in his first year and look at him now""]",0,73,0.18,0,69,69,0,12,0.0,0
