This article gives the supposed break down on 2025 drivers salaries, not including bonuses.

The article also goes on to mention what the constructors receive at he end of the season for their performance, I quote:

""F1 prize money: How much do teams earn in the Constructors' Championship?

The team that secures the highest position in the Constructors' Championship receives the largest share of prize money, and the team in 10th place receives the least.

McLaren is estimated to have [received approximately $161 million](https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/f1-prize-money-how-much-do-gp-teams-and-drivers-really-make/) – an estimated 14 per cent of the prize pool – for securing victory in the 2024 Constructors' Championship. 

Last-placed Sauber, meanwhile, took home $69 million.

Prize money constitutes just one aspect of revenue generation for the teams as significant income streams also stem from sponsorships, merchandise sales, and commercial partnerships.""

Compare his pace to Lawson’s long stint on mediums. Lawson’s car is slower and manages tyres differently, but he was only 1 of 2 drivers to go for the 1 stop and was running in free air in the last part of the race. Let's go with it. This plot shows lap times for Lawson (in yellow) and Verstappen (in dark blue). Green and purple are explained below.

https://preview.redd.it/lwk8sxlb911g1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bf8b20ea84a29bdf2f02ffc177d96512266af6

Verstappen lost \~21.3 seconds in the pits with 17 laps remaining, equivalent to 1.25 s/lap. The purple line shows his lap times for the final stint + 1.25. It's what his laps would've needed to be to break even without pitting.

In the middle part of the race, Verstappen averaged 1.26 s/lap faster than Lawson. Assume this delta would have continued in the last part of the race (though perhaps the delta would have increased because Lawson appears to hit “the cliff” at the end as the tyres approached 50 laps, whereas Verstappen only needed to run 36 laps on the mediums to the end). The green line shows Lawson’s laps minus 1.26, which is a proxy for Verstappen’s projected pace if he had stayed out.

The stay out scenario (green) ends up 2.4 seconds faster in total. Small, but in addition he wouldn’t have needed to clear Russell on track (although that cost was minimal), and he finished right behind Kimi, so perhaps the 2.4 secs would've been enough for P2.

**Verdict: he should have stayed out.**","[""> In the middle part of the race, Verstappen averaged 1.26 s/lap faster than Lawson.

How does that pan out?  It's likely he'd get a cheap stop, but might have been jumped with those on newly fresh tires."", ""Exactly. Plus, Lawson's cliff was at 50 because he was managing from lap 1. Max was on full push, non stop. In addition to this, the mediums had a huge drop off after 28-31 laps for the 2 stoppers, which means Max would've experienced the same."", ""I can't believe how little this is talked about. Max tore up every set of tyres he was on because his strategy was 2 pit stops, presumably after he got the puncture this was settled on. Everyone else was trying for a 1 stop. So Max was flooring it knowing he was gonna get new tyres, but it becomes clear that 1 stop will not work. So the reason Max has had such a great race is, he extracted every second from his tyres very quickly, the rest of the field tried to eek them out and it didn't work. \n\nIt was this indecision that cost the field so badly as Max breezed past them while they nursed tyres, thinking they'll be back up front from only doing a 1 stop, then needing to 2 stop and being screwed. \n\nIronically the puncture seems to have saved his race, as his initial tyre choice was hard, so presumably he was aiming for a 1 stopper."", 'This and also chasing someone with less than -0.3s delta makes it harder to overtake.
