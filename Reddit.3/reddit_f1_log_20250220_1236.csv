What are the technical innovations and what are they for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1it4pal/what_changes_on_the_new_ferrari_sf25_suspension/,2025-02-19, News,,"['Translation \n\n\nThe technical secrets of Leclerc and Hamilton\'s new Red: the revolution is in the front area, but the bottom has also been completely revised\n\nOn the track at Fiorano, the new rear wing stands out\n\nThe new Ferrari SF-25 has already gone on track for its baptism with Charles Leclerc in a Fiorano surrounded by fans. Focus on the knowledge of the new mechanical parts and optimization of the new medium-downforce rear wing with a V-shape profile, a trend introduced by Alpine and then also used by McLaren, but on lower downforce levels. The real car has presented itself on the home circuit and apparently it is not so different from the renderings, even if it will change a lot.\n\nThe front suspension, why it is the most important innovation\n\nThe immediately visible novelty is the front suspension which now adopts an inverted tie rod (pull rod) compared to the previous ones. The modification had given positive results in a short time after its adoption in the tunnel, and is mainly aerodynamic in nature to lower the arm and free up space between the wing and the sidepods. Consequently, the upper triangles were also lowered. The designers were able to evolve the design of the sidepod inlet and the conveyors of the Venturi tunnels that carry the air under the bottom.\nAn anti-dive geometry was confirmed but the impression is that the choice was not to reduce the driving sensitivity on the front axle too much, thinking about the kerbs, but rather they pushed into the tunnel to\n\nThey change shape and size to better exploit aerodynamics\n\nThe measurements have all been revised, the cockpit has been slightly moved while the side pod inlet has been moved back with an increased volume in the lower part. The ""P"" design of the radiator inlets has been maintained but is more rounded, this should have allowed greater efficiency downstream of the single-seater by better tapering the volumes of the tail, which now has mini-slits on the fin for breathing. The upper lip of the side pod inlets has now become a wing profile in all respects. Above the sides you can see a hint of what were called goldfish tanks on the F1-75 , obviously we are completely far from that function, however it is an idea that we wanted to try again in the tunnel to adapt it to the new concept. The dress is refined, muscular but dry, the great work in the tunnel is visible.\n\nEvolved DRS and a completely revised floor\n\nThe SF-25 has not given up the dry triangle of the air box of the past cars, this is a positive fact to maintain a good efficiency towards the rear wing. Ferrari is probably abandoning that ""all-purpose"" wing seen in the first part of last season, sometimes too loaded, the one shown currently is a clear step forward in terms of efficiency of the Drsanche through the design of the V-shaped main plane.\nThe triangle, the front wing and the short nose are the parts that have remained most faithful to the latest specifications that worked well in the last season finale, everything else has been gradually evolved and we must not forget the decisive part of these ground effect cars which remains the floor. The visible part is the edge that now takes on a greater linearity from the slide to the diffuser. The measures of the ""lips"" on the sides have been thinned and the final part of the floor edge has been further stiffened. The rear suspension has been redone to interact better with the rear wing. The design of the tunnels under the floor cannot be seen but it appears to be a very massive evolution of the experimental version used in late 2024.\n\n\nThe engine, interventions on power and reliability\n\n\nThe new 066/15 power unit cannot have been modified in terms of architecture due to the regulated freeze, however DT Gualtieri admitted that continuous optimization work always guarantees greater performance. ""We have worked intensely on all the control strategies and procedures to ensure that every single component can express its best on every circuit"".

There is only one team on track and all running must be done on specific tyres that are different from the tyres the teams will normally use at testing and the races. This is primarily used to capture marketing material and to check the car and it\'s systems are working.\n\nTesting this year is three days in Bahrain where the track is open for 8 hours each day. All 10 teams run at the same time and each will run 1 car (so up to 10 on track) for as many kilometres as they want. They also get to use the ""correct"" tyres, the same as they will during the races.

You can basically test if it works so that you don't spend the actual testing days in the garage fixing a bug.\n\nBasically performance vs function testing"", ""Note, preseason testing won't have all 20 cars on track at once, it will have 10, one from each team on track at once.
