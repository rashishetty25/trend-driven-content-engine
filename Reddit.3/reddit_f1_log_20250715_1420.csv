Interesting podcast with Tim Mayer whose standing for the presidency of the FIA. Really interesting to hear his opinions on so many elements of our sport as he sets out his pitch for president. ","['>he sets out his pitch for president\n\nAnd that is really what this is all about: marketing. This is all about Mayer making a pitch to the public about his candidacy, and the interviewer does not challenge on anything or ask any follow-up questions. For instance, Mayer says ""there was the World Councils, World Motorsport Council, the World Mobility Council and those two have been seriously impacted by the current administration"" -- but he does not explain *how* those councils have been affected or what he will do to address that problem. He just says that they have been, and then immediately contradicts himself by talking about how ben Sulayem has been supporting smaller federations and how he himself agrees with this policy.\n\nThen Mayer goes on to talk about the non-disclosure agreements. He says that anyone who breaks it can be fined 50,000 Euros and the FIA do not need to prove that you broke the agreement to issue the fine. So how do they know how to fine? It seems that the implication here is that the FIA will go around fining people left, right and centre, but there has been no evidence of that and the interviewer does not ask him to explain this statement. The only way they could fine you is if you made public statements about the thing you agreed not to discuss, which would make it a slam dunk.\n\nFinally, the interviewer does not challenge Mayer over his actions in Austin where he was advising the event organisers on how to appeal their penalty for the track invasion. Since he was in a senior role in the FIA at the time, this was a massive conflict of interests -- and worse, his actions put the FIA in legal jeopardy. If civil or criminal action was brought in the aftermath of the invasion, and Mayer successfully got the penalty reworded to exonerate the organisers for their failings in a key area of responsibility, then it would effectively say that the FIA allowed the invasion to happen.\n\nThis is not an interview, This is propaganda. Mayer screwed up and lost his job, and is pissed about it so he is running for FIA President. And because ben Sulayem is unpopular, he has found a platform where he is allowed to make broad, sweeping statements that are completely shallow, and he allowed to make them without any critical questioning of his policies.', ""F1's dedicated down-under fact checker is back on the case!"", ""I am not sure if you are being sarcastic. I will choose to believe that you are not.\n\nMy objection to this stems from the way everyone is so dissatisfied at ben Sulayem's leadership that they are taking any opportunity to convince themselves that his days are numbered -- but there are so many problems with Mayer as a candidate that those same people are just setting themselves up for disappointment.""]",82,5,0.9,82,3,3,4,0,0.0,4

Also what key incidents could  there be involved in the season.,.","[""Just 2021. I don't think there is a reason to change the story of the season and mix years. 2021 was incredible."", '2021.', 'Opening race is in Bahrain. Bottas is out with COVID. Rosberg steps in and wins, returns to Monaco and elaborates.\n\nVettel wins races 2 and 3 in Australia and China, and never wins another one for the whole season.\n\nIn Baku, chaos ensues among the top teams. Surprise podium with Leclerc, Stroll and Ocon. Hamilton wins in Spain, and on consistency leads the WDC.\n\nLeclerc takes pole in Monaco but Ferrari screws him over, Ricciardo wins.\n\nMercedes continues to be the fastest car for the remaining part of the first half of the season, winning in Canada, France, Silverstone and Hungary. Sprinkle in one Bottas win among them, probably Canada.\nHamilton wins in Silverstone on 3 wheels. Verstappen dominates in Austria. Grosjean has a Massa moment in Hungary and is out for the rest of the season.\n\nDaddy Stroll buys Force India and changes the name to Aston Martin. He drops Perez and signs Alonso to partner his son, hoping that a geriatric 2-time WDC would embarrass Lance less (it doesn\'t work). At the same time, Ricciardo is fed up with Red Bull favouring Verstappen and moves to Alpine, displacing Hulkenberg. Hulk steps in for Grosjean at Haas. Red Bull signs Perez as permanent 2nd driver to Max.\n\nPiastri understands that without his agreement, Briatore has put out a press release that he would be driving for Alpine the following year. This is wrong and he has not signed a contract with Alpine for 2022. He would be driving for Mclaren the following year, replacing Sainz who is heading to Ferrari in place of the retiring Vettel.\n\nAfter the summer break, Mercedes brings the ""zero-pods"" upgrade package to Spa. Mclaren suddenly starts challenging for podiums and wins. Newey works his magic and the Red Bull becomes the fastest car on the grid, now with a more reliable engine.\n\nVerstappen takes 65 grid places\' worth of engine penalties and laps the entire field at Spa. Zandvoort is a changeable weather classic, but Max still wins by 40 seconds ahead of Alonso and Russell.\n\nAt Monza, Verstappen vaults Hamilton. The Mclarens lead for much of the race, but Norris bottles it. Leclerc takes advantage of the Safety Car to overtake Sainz. Gasly comes 3rd.\n\nRaikkonen takes a shocking P2 start in Singapore, but comes together with Vettel and Verstappen in the 1st corner, taking out Alonso in the process. Sainz wins with Norris and Hamilton close behind; Russell bins it in the last lap from what could have been an incredible second P3 in the Williams.\n\nDown the grid, Magnussen continuously accumulates penalty points to help Grosjean and Hulkenberg throughout the season. With 13 points on his license, he is banned for the following race.\n\nThe Russian GP is unsuspiciously cancelled. The circus hurries down to Istanbul instead, and Perez wards off Verstappen and Bottas.\n\nVerstappen wins comfortably in Japan and comes within 25 points of Hamilton. Mercedes abandons the ""zero-pods"" concept.\n\nRussell goes bowling up the hill in Austin, taking out both Mclarens and Verstappen. Vettel retires with a suspension failure, and Leclerc is screwed over by Ferrari strategy. Raikkonen comes home to take an incredible win ahead of an impotent Perez, and Bottas.\n\nLeclerc receives death threats for coming together with Perez in Mexico; the FIA takes 4 working days to respond with a condemnation. Verstappen wins again, now only 14 points away from Hamilton.\n\nMercedes installs a nuclear power plant to the back of Hamilton\'s car for the last 3 races. He promptly wins in Brazil with fastest lap. Max tries to run him off the track on no fewer than 4 occasions, and gets demoted to 3rd behind Ocon. The gap expands to 25 points.\n\nHamilton is out with COVID just before the Qatar GP and Russell steps into the rocketship, while Williams promotes Latifi to the seat. The heat creates a strategic mess. Russell\'s tyres blow out twice, once from an internal puncture and once from running over debris on the pit straight. Verstappen wins, and ties Hamilton on points.\n\nPiastri steps in for Sainz, who would rather spend his time to pack up and find a place in Maranello.

I mean, you couldn't write a better story from a standpoint that it literally came down to the final race with the top two drivers tied, and how they got to that point.
