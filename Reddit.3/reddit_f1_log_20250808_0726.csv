McLaren have been dominant with little chance of anyone else getting involved in the fight. However, 2025 offers some interesting new teammate pairings. The mathematical model seeks to eliminate the factor car by only measuring drivers against their teammates.","[""In defense of the model, it makes itself quite clear that the lack of data for rookies makes it quite hard to give them or their teammates a fair score. And in a season with 6 rookies, that's bound to be a problem."", ""A note with regards to data visualization, don't use smoothed lines for line graphs. Instead use straight connections or stepped connections.  \nSmoothed lines introduce implied datapoints that aren't actually in the data. In your graphs you can particularly see that in the peaks and valleys that happen in-between races.\n\nHere's an example using the Lawson graph with some rough vertical gridlines added. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/bQ6b8SR\nThe second image is an attempt to show how the straight line graph would look.\nIn-between race 11 and 12 the rating drops, but because the smoothed graph has to smooth out the curve, there is an actual peak in-between those two races that implies the actual rating is higher than it is. Inversely, the rating stays approximately the same in-between race 12 and 13, but the graph has a significant drop in-between those two races.\n\nThe lack of vertical gridlines amplify that issue because you can't exactly tell where the individual measurements are, so viewers won't see that the peaks and valleys aren't actual data.\nWith a straight line plot you don't need to have vertical gridlines as the changes in the line show where the data points are, but with smoothed lines you absolutely need them.\n\nOn another note, as you have a scale that goes from 0 to 100, set the y-axis range to 0 to 100. \nThat way you show the data with regards to the full range.\nLawson's graph is another good example for this because he seems to have hit a rating of 10 for races 3 and 4, so the graph implies that he has hit the lowest possible rating.\nAnd because of the smoothed lines it actually looks like the graph goes below 10, making it look like his rating goes into the negative and gets clipped."", 'I clicked on the link first, thought ""this list is pretty decent when you consider the factors, maybe I\'d change one or two things"" then clicked into this thread and was shocked to see the vitriol lol.\n\nIsn\'t it obvious a mathematical model will become more accurate the more data it gets? The bottom half of the ranking is weird, but the top half seems fine. Sure, I\'d probably bump Russell ahead of Albon, but it\'s not like it put Albon at number one or anything truly ridiculous. \n\nA few questions:\n\n1. Have you ever considered doing this for IndyCar? Drivers there have very long tenures, so it might be cool to see how the model rates them over time. I understand if you aren\'t interested in the series though.\n2. What would Leclerc need to do to beat one of Verstappen\'s last five seasons? Would he need to beat his teammates as decisively as Verstappen?\n3. Why does the model project Piastri to improve so much? How do we know he isn\'t near his ceiling? \n\nThanks for the time you put into this. Even if it\'s not 100% reflective of RL, it\'s fun to see how the stats are interpreted by the model.', 'LOL at the meltdowns', ""Sees Albon ranked 3rd, I don't know what you guys are talking about, this model is clearly perfect!"", 'Holy this list is awful, Borteleto and Hadjar below Franco is crazy, Piastri 5th and Norris 6th is hilarious, agree that Albon has been top 5 or close though', ""why are people so mad at this? I don't get it really."", 'a very nice season from Leclerc !', ""Nice work as always, sorry for all the angry and unfair comments you're getting.\n\nI think one area the methodology could improve is the time it assumes it takes for a driver to reach their ceiling. From what I've seen, a driver reaches their peak pace in their second or third season (based on teammate pace comparisons etc) , and after that it is just about maximising it. Piastri for example I don't think is going to get any quicker, you refer to a pace gap between himself and Norris which quite frankly does not exist this season. So I think he's already capable of performing at his ceiling.\n\nThe other area (but not too sure if there's a fix) is that I think it's easier for someone to be 'consistent' (according to the model) when they have a less competitive teammate or have a car that's in no mans land, because then you aren't punished for mistakes or a lack of pace. E.g Lewis was sometimes qualifying like half a second behind Charles at the start of the year, but since Ferrari were the clear fourth fastest car, he would finish quite close to Charles anyway. Meanwhile in Hungary, he 'only' qualified two and half tenths behind Charles, but since the field was much more competitive he was out in Q2 while Charles proceeded to put it on pole. The model has the latter as the much worse weekend, which makes sense and again not sure how you correct for that.\n\nSimilarly with Verstappen, he's botched quite a few qualifying laps this year but I assume he was not punished for them given he still beat his teammate comprehensively. I don't think it's a coincidence that he's been by far the most consistent driver according to the model since 2019 given that's where Red Bulls second driver issue started, but yeah difficult to incorporate that into your methodology."", ""I'm just here to support you because you're going to get a bunch of hateful comments just for trying something different.\n\n\nI agree that one of the main issues with models like this one is that the model clearly assigns most of the weight to the car and then gets the deviations for each driver. This is a proper way of modelling, but it may not be as accurate. Having said that, in F1 the data is limited and models will always be limited by the amount of data that you can provide to them. You're not doing an experiment, but working with observational data, which is way harder to analyze (much harder than most people will ever understand).\xa0\n\n\nKeep it up.\xa0""]",234,485,0.77,234,3331,3331,-1,0,0.0,-1

My argument is that RB haven't been actively building the car around Max's driving style. 

Instead it's my impression that they built a barely driveable monstrosity which Max is uniquely suited to being able to handle better than any other driver, which was fine until the past few months where even Max started to fall off. 

The key differentiator is that the intention hasn't been 'Build what Max wants/needs in order to be the best', instead it's been 'Max has proven this concept is viable so stay on this build path'.

And he’s said multiple times that he doesn’t have a set driving style, he just adapts to how the car needs to be driven.

1mkbvk7,What are your thoughts on having multiple consecutive races on a single track?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mkbvk7/what_are_your_thoughts_on_having_multiple/,2025-08-07, Discussion,"With the F1 calendar getting increasingly packed with street circuits and Middle Eastern races, I’ve been wondering, wouldn’t it be better to have consecutive race weekends at iconic circuits like Silverstone, Spa, Suzuka, Monza, or Albert Park?

Think of it like a “double-header” at tracks that consistently deliver great racing. 
Some pros in my opinion-

1. Iconic tracks like Spa or Silverstone are fan favorites for a reason. They usually deliver more overtaking, higher speeds, and more thrilling action than many street circuits.


2. Teams and drivers could benefit from reduced travel stress, allowing more time for rest and recovery.


3. Running two races at the same track could encourage teams to experiment with car setups, tyre choices, and strategies, especially if the weather changes between weekends.


4. If the FIA is truly pushing for sustainability, keeping races in the same region (or at the same venue) for multiple weeks cuts down massively on carbon emissions from freight and travel.


5. Tracks evolve between weekends, rubber builds up, conditions change. so the second race might play out very differently despite being at the same circuit.



Some cons are obviously from revenue and fans perspective -

Repeating venues may hurt the global expansion of F1’s fanbase.

Local fan demand might not justify two full weekends.


But personally, I’d rather see two weekends of epic racing at Spa than a single procession at a soulless street circuit.
","['>I’d rather see two weekends of epic racing at Spa than a single procession at a soulless street circuit.\n\nYou were watching the race at Spa this year, right? Everyone complained how boring it was. Likewise Suzuka.', 'Those ""iconic"" tracks dont guarantee ""iconic"" races. You can race 10 times and get 9 boring races. Nostalgia makes it so you only remember the good stuff. \n\nLook at suzuka this year. Spa in dry hasn\'t been good either the last years, same with Imola and Monza. When the weather plays a role or there\'s a SC it can change, but if it\'s a by the book 1 stop race it doesn\'t matter what track it is you won\'t get much excitement on any track', ""So like COVID, basically? If we can get the Sakhir outer track again, I'm down."", 'They did this during Covid at the Red Bull Ring. I liked it', ""An entire season at Interlagos? I'm in!"", 'We have done that in 2020 / 2021 but i think i prefer as many different locations as we can have.\n\nIts also not as easy as fan favourites have epic racing and other tracks dont. You picked spa as an example and Spa is a fan and driver favourite without a doubt, but it isnt exactly known to produce consistent epic f1 racing. Suzuka? amazing track. Was that a race this year where you would go ""same again please""?\n\nI would say Austria is generally a nice track. Was that double header in 2021 a season Highlight? Not really.', ""Would be fine if it's on a different configuration."", ""it's already hard enough to keep ONE race at a historic track, 2 consecutive ones would be impossible"", 'First race normal, second race backwards, THIRD RACE LEGO CARS']",0,53,0.23,0,50,50,0,1,-0.01999999999999999,0
