Rough start but that's how it goes in a shuffle. Great end pace and was going to pass Charles with how quickly he was approaching. That Merc is a weird car. Oddly in 50 deg race track temperatures it was performing better than the ferraris later into the race and wasn't too bad to the mclarens.\n\nJust an odd car."", ""Hopefully it won’t be necessary, but if the PU issues persist, it might be worth pushing the debriefs back by a day or two—provided it’s not a back-to-back weekend—so there’s actually something substantial to share (or even consider inviting someone from HPP).\n\n\nWednesday just feels like too quick a turnaround given the volume of PU issues recently. The latest video sounded more like, “Yeah, the PU came back late Monday,” with no real update—information that was already known much earlier. If it’s a back-to-back week, fair enough—Wednesday’s the only option. But if not, holding off slightly could make the debriefs more insightful.\n\n\nOf course, there’s no obligation for the team to share these at all. But when they do, it's just more valuable to hear actual new insight. Compared to a year or two ago, the highlights now feel much more pre-scripted and PR-filtered (with the sponsor branded title it's understandable). Without meaningful updates, it risks becoming just another generic recap—and that’s when fewer people tune in.""]",35,5,0.81,35,26,26,2,0,0.020000000000000018,2
