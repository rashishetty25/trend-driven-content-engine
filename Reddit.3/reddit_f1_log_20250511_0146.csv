1kj5t2q,McLaren's Brake (phase changing) Context,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kj5t2q/mclarens_brake_phase_changing_context/,2025-05-10, Discussion,"The videos on phase changing materials are complex and I see many people disregarding it because it seems far-fetched as the discussion has an air of ""ground breaking technology"" which attracts valid scepticism. But there is a more ""simple"" side to it which relates to Red Bull's rumoured ""water in the tyres"" claim. It might not be as unlikely as you think. 

Whether they are using a solid or not in F1, phase changing cooling has been a staple in mobile/small devices for decades as it is basically the only way to efficiently cool such a small device without a pump. If youre using a phone or laptop right now, you are using a phase changing coolant system. Heat pipes or vapor chambers in your device transition water into gas, then back into water when the temp drops. If you've ever had a hot laptop on your lap, its fighting for life to keep the temperature below 100 degrees by constantly changing state. Similar to how an engine circulates coolant to a radiator, except this is pumped so there is no need to rely on a state change to circulate the coolant. 

If a team suspects brakes have heat pipes to regulate brake and tyre temp, a state change and liquid is involved for circulation, hence the water rumour. The high temperatures involved mean they could be using a solid to liquid change as the videos discuss, or it could be a high temp liquid.

The point is that while it is an innovative motorsport idea, its not a scientific breakthrough. Which imo makes it more believable.","['Liquid cooling is strictly prehibited in any form for the brakes though, and the FIA wouldn’t have cleared it if that was the case.\n\nSSPCMs (shape stabilized phase changing materials), are a more likely candidate, but they are not as effective for this use case.\n\nThere’s also a lot of regulatory constrains in the form of legality boxes around the drums, which make the implementation really difficult.\n\nIt’s s cool idea definitely, and could end up being what they’re doing, but its far from being conclusively proven.', 'A ton of people are misunderstanding what phase change materials are \n\nThey’re not anything like moveable materials based off its heat, they’re as their name says, materials that absorb or expel heat using the properties of a phase change\n\nFor example, boiling water cannot exceed 100c at ambient pressures, meaning if you keep adding heat it will stay at a 100 until it all boils off completely', 'All these innovations really impress me.', 'This post has a no yapping by just the glamour part of f1 fans.

The purpose of the phase change in heat pipes is so that convection can be used to transfer heat more efficiently. The PCMs rumored* have been the solid to liquid type, not the liquid the gas type. The applications of this type are more in line with the constant temperature thermal battery idea, though it’s still unclear to me how that results in the behavior that we see with the McLaren.\n\n* rumor is a strong word here, it’s a hypothesis from a former f1 engineer. It isn’t alleged to come from within the paddock so it’s basically meaningless.', ""It's a good theory, but I'm apprehensive about it. You generally want to minimise unsprung mass.

Its seems everyone keeps forgetting that McLaren haven’t even touched the car yet. one update and you can forget about qualifying ahead of them', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Max Verstappen has been complaining regularly about his car\'s handling this year. The understeer is particularly annoying. But the engineers fear the problem won\'t be completely resolved, even with upgrades.**\n\n> In Bahrain, the first warning sign had already been given. And in Miami, Max Verstappen was unable to compensate for his car\'s deficiencies. In the end, the world champion crossed the finish line just 40 seconds behind winner Oscar Piastri. ""Max was able to pull off a magic trick on one lap in qualifying. In the race, we saw that we were losing an average of seven-tenths to a second per lap to the McLaren,"" calculated Motorsport Director Helmut Marko.\n\n> Verstappen had already complained about his car\'s steering behavior in free practice. As has often been the case this season, the rear end initially feels light when braking and turning. Towards the apex, the balance shifts increasingly toward understeer. It\'s difficult for the drivers to adjust to this shift in balance. The lack of confidence leads to frustration and lost time on the clock.\n\n> To alleviate the problem, the engineers brought a new underbody to Miami. The upgrade was originally planned for Imola, but a sample was finally ready in time for the Florida trip. Naturally, it was installed on the number 1 race car. It\'s rare for such a major change to be used on a sprint weekend, where there\'s only one free practice session for testing and data collection.\n\n> **Underbody alleviates problem.**\nAccording to chief engineer Paul Monaghan, however, the risk was limited. ""We saw in the wind tunnel that the stability of the airflow was unchanged compared to the old underbody. Therefore, we weren\'t worried about it suddenly becoming aerodynamically unstable. The new underbody simply produces a little more downforce,"" the Briton explained.\n\n> The car\'s sensors then spit out the expected values. But it wasn\'t a cure for the problems: ""We know the areas where we need to improve. They\'re the same after Miami as they were before Miami,"" explained team principal Christian Horner. ""The new underbody delivered what we wanted. It\'s part of a series of upgrades that will come over the next few races.""\n\n> Helmut Marko also hopes that the engineers have something more up their sleeve: ""The understeer problem isn\'t solved yet. It improved somewhat with the new underbody, but we still have work to do. I hope that a solution will be ready by Imola so that the car can finally find balance.""\n\n> **No one-stop solution.**\nChief Engineer Monaghan tries to temper expectations somewhat in this regard: ""There\'s no one-size-fits-all solution. It\'s only possible with small advances in many areas. We know what\'s happening to the car, but finding a cure isn\'t so simple. It may never even go away completely. But we should at least be able to mitigate the extent of it. We have a lot of clever people in Milton Keynes working hard on it. I\'m sure it will get better.""\n\n> The question is whether it won\'t be too late for Verstappen\'s title dreams until the engineers finally cure the RB21\'s mood swings. With a current 32-point deficit, Horner sees the situation as already tense: ""The World Championship is over 24 races. The road is long. But McLaren looks very impressive in Miami. Things can change, of course. But we should start reducing the points deficit in the next few races.""\n\n> **Hope for Barcelona turnaround.**\nRed Bull\'s own upgrades aren\'t the only thing intended to bring them closer to McLaren. Hopes are also pinned on the new front wing regulations being introduced for the Spanish Grand Prix. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200bthe front end of the car is no longer allowed to flex as much under load. All top teams need to make improvements here to pass the more stringent FIA tests. This could potentially hit McLaren harder.\n\n> ""It\'s difficult to predict at this point what the impact will be,"" Horner pondered. ""But it\'s not just a small adjustment; it\'s a fundamental change. It will definitely affect all cars, in many areas. It\'s just a question of the extent.""', 'Im actually really excited for the Barcelona “reg” change.

1kjn12p,Did F1’s Fastest Lap Point Rule Really Affect Strategy? Here's What I Found,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kjn12p/did_f1s_fastest_lap_point_rule_really_affect/,2025-05-10, Discussion,"So, F1 recently got rid of the fastest lap point, claiming it was all about strategy, not pure pace. They said drivers outside the top 10 were ""stealing"" the point, with some even affecting the championship. But is that really true? I decided to dive into the stats and find out if the rule actually made a difference.  
For context, the fastest lap point was introduced in the 2019 season till the 2024 season. When I say before 2019, I mean from 2011 to 2018.  
  
Here's what I found -  

**Before 2019**: The fastest laps were mostly set in the middle of the race. Only about **3% of races** (6 races) saw a driver in the top 10 pit late and grab the fastest lap. The **average laps remaining** when the fastest lap was set? **17.22**.

**After 2019**: Things changed. Fastest laps were set much closer to the end of the race, and it wasn’t just about pace anymore. **23% of races** (27 races) saw top 10 drivers pit late for that point. The **mean laps remaining** when the fastest lap was set dropped to **5.94**.

Here's a slide showing all the instances of drivers outside the top 10 pitting towards the end and setting the fastest lap - 

[Comparison of instances where drivers outside the top 10 secured the fastest lap, before and after the introduction of the fastest lap point in 2019.](https://preview.redd.it/o83j28mtd10f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e83b3163b3addc51b4f3ee9a2fb91ae52061d57e)

  
So, what else did F1 management expect? In close championship battles, teams would always take every advantage they could, whether that meant pitting late for the fastest lap or making strategic moves to “steal” the point. It was clear that the rule wasn’t just about pure pace, and in many cases, it became a tactical tool for those outside the top 10.

F1 scrapping the rule makes sense, but only time will tell if, from this year onward, teams return to the pre-2019 pattern where the fastest lap becomes more of an honorary achievement rather than a strategic goal.

What do you think? Did this rule give too much power to drivers outside the top 10?","[""The straw that broke it was a sister team tactically 'stealing' a point from a driver who was in direct competition with the parent team, wasn't it?\n\n  \nWithout that one Ricciardo fastest lap, I doubt they'd even have changed the rule."", ""The problem wasn't drivers outside the top 10, it was that getting fastest lap was more to do with how fast the driver behind you was (and therefore how close). It generally just boiled down to which driver in the top 10 had a pit stop gap behind them in the last 5 laps."", ""Still think they should've switched to a pole position bonus point for GPs. It would serve as effectively the same thing but without the gimmick of some teams stopping for tires to steal it when others don't."", '>\xa0What do you think? Did this rule give too much power to drivers outside the top 10?\n\n\nI don\'t know about too much power...\n\n\nIt certainly gave teams the ability to tank one drivers race to influence it... Which is a little silly out than straight swap the cars and I feel is bad.\n\n\nIt gave the appearance of red bull exerting undue influence to get Toro Rosso to steal a point. Which is bad. We\'ve all seen allegations suggestions about how RB tells TR to let their drivers through easier etc.\xa0\n\n\nIt\'s also a ridiculous thing when the only driver that goes for FL is P5 with a 30 second gap. It often felt like FL points were a matter of circumstances and not a genuine ""wow he tried hard and got it"". Which I\'d use for a good argument at removing it.\xa0', 'Only race it genuinely affected the result, in my opinion, was Silverstone (70th anniversary?) race. Max pitted for fastest lap then Lewis’ tyre exploded and won on three wheels. \n\nIt’s pretty easy to assume Max would have won if not for that.', ""Fastest lap point was pointless to measure real pace order.\xa0As you noted, in quite a few cases it just resulted in a late pitstop for a semi-quali lap. The way it is now still doesn't reflect genuine pure pace given it's all about who has the better tyre management, but at least it gives other insides into it, rather than just showing driver X pitted onto the soft tyres near the end."", 'For chaos: a point for the fastest lap every lap.', 'The coolest fastest lap will always be Max in Austria 2023.\n\nThe way he went through heating up his tyres and letting Charles get close to 1.5s will never not be cool.', 'The argument has no weight while they still use the current generation of tyres, which have a far greater effect in making the races ""tactical"" rather than about pure pace.\n\nI say award \\*more\\* points for fastest lap, open it to everyone, and give drivers near the back more to race for. Maybe that means we\'ll get lots of stops from backmarkers near the end, switching to softs and trying to throw in some quali-pace laps. But that sounds fun to watch.']",366,136,0.93,366,131,131,366,136,0.93,366
