What is it I don‚Äôt get about McLaren culture that makes you stand so much from almost every other competitor in the history of the championship? \n\n*Oscar*: I mean, I think we‚Äôve said many, many times now that we don‚Äôt just want a chance of this success just for this year. You know, there‚Äôs a big regulations change next year. We don‚Äôt know how competitive we‚Äôre going to be, we don‚Äôt know how competitive anyone‚Äôs going to be. **But you know, ultimately, we want the best chance of winning championships for as long as we‚Äôre Formula 1 drivers, and we‚Äôre both at McLaren for a very long time.

You know, it‚Äôs not a very nice feeling, I would imagine. **So it‚Äôs important to protect all the people that we have because that‚Äôs what gives us a championship hope for years to come.** \n\n*Lando*: That was beautiful.

And you see that with plenty of other teams whether it‚Äôs been Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes. And we want to try and be in this position for a longer period of time than what they have been at the top. So it‚Äôs still early days. It‚Äôs only our second year of fighting for wins.
