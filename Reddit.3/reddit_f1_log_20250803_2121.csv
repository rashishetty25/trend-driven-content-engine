The leaders doing their pace, trying to create a gap to the midfield to slot in after the first stop. In this case, one Mclaren will try to undercut Leclerc and the other will opt to go longer creating a tyre delta for later. In this scenario it will be very hard for Leclerc to keep the lead. The undercut here is extremly powerful and if they are within 2 seconds before the first stop, one Mclaren will pass him, so Ferrari themselves have to try and be the first to pit.\n\n2. Do a monaco train and keep the field close together, aka driving 1-2 seconds slower than what they normally could do. Therefore the chance of an undercut is reduced a lot since the Mclarens cant slot into some free air. \nWith Leclercs slightly lower downforce setup, the 5 kph top speed adventage could be enough to keep the lead on the two straights but its risky cause with one bad exit of the final corner and mclarens superior traction and grip there he could still be vulnerable and then once he is passed mclaren will drive away and the rest of the race will be hard to recover.

I am a first-year science teacher in a rural district in the US, and I plan on using racecars as a means of teaching physics. NASCAR is popular there and a lot of people do small-scale hobby racing, but as F1 is the pinnacle of automotive engineering I want to use it instead, to inspire the ones that are going to go on into mechanical engineering etc. 

I have found some good videos on the F1 YouTube channel that I plan on using. I also found the means to construct a miniature wind tunnel, although mine may be rather rudimentary compared to the ones I saw. (I'll have students build their own racecars and we'll test them in the wind tunnel). 

Do you have any other ideas? Any other resources?","['What about using NASCAR to introduce the basics of racing cars then F1 to show the effect of advanced aero? Feels like this could get more people interested initially then also show what makes F1 so much faster.', ""Since you're planning on building a wind tunnel, I'm assuming you want to focus on the aerodynamics of the cars.\n\nI think it would be a good idea to make a few models of some airfoils and maybe a venturi tunnel, to show how the modern ground effect cars work.\n\nJust to help them understand why the cars are built the way they are."", 'This is a solid idea', 'It depends on the exact concepts you\'re trying to get across, but I love the idea of having the students create their own models.

Plus, I\'m betting that if your rural school is much like the one I went to, there\'s probably students who either drive some barely-held-together, no-muffler, souped up Civic or their older sibling does lol. So, being able to draw the line between those more close to home vehicles and F1 cars, which look so much different, may be helpful! \n\nIf you\'re looking to get into things like suspension, etc., there\'s also the fact that F1 cars have incredibly intricate, beautiful suspension set ups for what they do - but it would never work on, say, a WRC car, or vice versa. I can see a fun discussion there about utility-based design, too - so you don\'t necessarily put down Nascar, but focus more on the fact that every series of motorsport has its goals and a great deal of engineering and physics involved with reaching those goals.', ""I don't feel like you can for sure show this difference in small models, and I would want to make sure you didn't insult nascar. I hate various motorsports fighting amongst themselves.
