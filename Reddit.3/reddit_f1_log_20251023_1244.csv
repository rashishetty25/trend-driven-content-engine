1odel9t,Norris is a particular bad starter: the numbers,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odel9t/norris_is_a_particular_bad_starter_the_numbers/,2025-10-22, Discussion,"https://preview.redd.it/67gqcyy45pwf1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=19074f8c188fdf5639e61217cb9199d328c08e0c

When Norris starts from the front two rows he loses an average of 0.65 positions, the worst among top drivers in recent memory. He‚Äôs also the most likely to lose positions (40% of races vs Max at 16%) and the least likely to gain (10% of races, vs Max at 28%).

Note that this analysis only considers starts from the front two rows, which naturally biases the results toward losses (since there‚Äôs more room to move backward than forward). Even so Max still manages to gain positions on average. Alonso And Leclerc also perform strongly across these metrics.

**Methodology:**

* \~15 years of data analyzed
* Only races where the driver started in the front two rows
* Lap-1 position changes capped at ¬±4 to limit the impact of outliers

Edit: [updated](https://ibb.co/DP8RwjWZ) with data back to '96. Mark Webber hahahaha! Also, per /u/[Ger\_Oktoberfe](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ger_Oktoberfest/)st's  [suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odel9t/comment/nkubqpp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I added a position delta relative to the average, which broadly tells a similar story.

Instead Lando did Lando things and it blew up in George\'s face.\n\n*""I made a good start. Max covered Lando.

Let\'s borrow from golf and call this ""par"". So for pole is probably like 1.5 or so, while for 10th it\'s probably very close to 10. Then just compare each driver\'s start with what is par, and get your average from that.\n\nWould allow you to do all drivers and all starting positions, and probably give a more accurate result.', 'He‚Äôs also quite poor at safety car restarts.

1ody9ve,"Red Bull, Horner wanted to give up on the RB21: the spark over goodbye",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ody9ve/red_bull_horner_wanted_to_give_up_on_the_rb21_the/,2025-10-23, News,"Partial translation by [ThisIsFormu1a1](https://x.com/ThisIsFormu1a1/status/1980918573959877054) on Twitter:

Red Bull's resurgence in the F1 championship with Max Verstappen has been marked by a strategic focus on taking each race weekend as it comes. The RB21's competitiveness has been confirmed progressively, with significant performances in Singapore and Texas.

Initial victories in Monza and Baku were met with skepticism due to track layouts, but subsequent races proved the RB21's capability on diverse circuits. Updates introduced at the Italian Grand Prix brought the car closer to the formidable McLaren MCL39.

Christian Horner's departure from Red Bull was influenced by friction with the team's Austrian leadership and the 'Verstappen clan.' Horner believed resources should be diverted to future projects, doubting the RB21's potential to close the gap with McLaren.

The decision to relieve Horner of his duties was not sudden, as developments for the RB21 were planned well before the summer break. The technical sector, led by Pierre Wach√©, faced implicit criticism from Horner, who saw no sense in further investment.

Despite Horner's skepticism, Red Bull's technical updates have revitalized the RB21, making it competitive across various circuits. The team's commitment to the current season has paid off, challenging the dominance of McLaren's MCL39.

The renewed competitiveness of the RB21 offers new interpretations of Red Bull's strategy, highlighting the importance of continuous development and adaptation in F1. The team's decision to persist with the RB21 has proven fruitful, defying initial doubts.","['This is very interesting given the praise Mekkies has received for his technical inputs with car developments and having a more open discussions with all the parties involved.\n\nHowever that doesn‚Äôt take away from Horner given these updates were planned when he was TP and I can understand him wanting to focus on 2026 given the huge investments needed by RB.\n\nLet‚Äôs see how this year goes and where Red Bull are next year to really make any judgement.', ""So the technical team's reasoning is probably that they need to understand the car because they have been struggling for over a year, and therefore putting out updates is the best way to verify whether what you are doing in Milton Keynes is correct?\n\nBecause any betting man would just give up on the championship after being so far behind with a car that has been struggling for over a year. And even with the car doing quite well now, who would have expect McLaren dropping the ball like they have done lately?"", ""Except if Max doesn't win the title and Red Bull start next year off the pace... he's been proven right lol"", ""Quite a few interesting lines of thought here.\n\nFor one thing, Horner still might not have been wrong, as the price RB paid for continuing with RB21's development will only become apparent next year. Then again, a reason why they wanted to keep pushing with the current car was reportedly to fully understand where they went wrong so they avoid the same mistakes again, which makes a lot of sense.\n\nAlso, let's just take a note here that out of Newey and Rob Marshall, it was Marshall who able to develop the ideas of the '22/'23 Red Bull into other mighty cars after moving to McLaren. And now Wache seems to have found a way out of the mess at Red Bull.

Horner was still TP when these updates were being implemented, so he clearly didn't throw everything away and still kept his eye on the next season.\xa0"", ""> The team's commitment to the current season has paid off\n\nIt's too early to say that.

Here‚Äôs the actual background to each:



1.Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‚Äòtake a monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.‚Äô - April 27, 2001 (not ‚Äú30 years ago‚Äù)

Original German:[ ‚ÄúJeder Affe kann jetzt, was die Bedienung des Autos betrifft, in der Formel 1 fahren.‚Äù ](https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article447943/Jeder-Affe-kann-jetzt-Formel-1-fahren.html)(‚ÄúEvery monkey can now drive in Formula 1 as far as the operation of the car is concerned.‚Äù)

Lauda repeated the sentiment at Jaguar‚Äôs launch (Jan 4, 2002): ‚Äú[I've said that any monkey could drive a modern F1 car so I think monkey say, monkey do](https://atlasf1.autosport.com/news/2002/jan/report.php/id/6162/.html)‚Äù and after a Valencia test (Jan 13, 2002), where he spun twice, clarified [he meant compared to his day](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/lauda-spins-twice-in-jaguar-test-font-faceverdana-size1iupdated-i-font-5058698/5058698/).



2. Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‚ÄòI had to start my car like a computer, it‚Äôs very complicated.‚Äô - Mar 28, 2014 (Malaysia FP)

After the Friday running at 2014 Malaysian GP, where Vettel faced technical problems, he [explained in German](https://www.formel1.de/news/interviews/2014-03-28/vettel-gott-sei-dank-macht-das-auto-keine-probleme) that with so much technology and software on board, sometimes the fix is to switch the car off and on again, like a home computer.



3. And Nico Rosberg said, he pressed, during the race - I don‚Äôt remember what race - the wrong button on the wheel. - Nov 2, 2014 (US GP)

[Rosberg said](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-usgp-ers-error-cost-nico-rosberg-in-battle-with-lewis-hamilton-5046033/5046033/) that when Hamilton attacked on lap 24 (Turn 12) he‚Äôd requested extra ERS power using a switch instead of the correct button, so the boost didn‚Äôt arrive in time, leaving him vulnerable to the pass.



Fun fact

Six years after that presser, in 2020, only two drivers from that Abu Dhabi panel were still on the F1 grid. By 2025, it‚Äôs three, and there‚Äôs only one driver who‚Äôs common to the 2020 and 2025 grids.","['So thirteen was misspronounced as thirty or missheared by people?', 'Gentleman', 'Can you repeat the question?', 'It‚Äôs not the offseason yet man', 'Kosters english is pretty rough, and mixing up thirty and thirteen is a fairly common mistake for people not entirely fluent in the language.
