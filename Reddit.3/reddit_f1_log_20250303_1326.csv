Like in previous years, drop your takes on what is almost certain to happen (90% chance), what has a fair shot (50%) and what is unlikely but dare to dream (10% chance).

Mine are as follows:

- 90% McLaren wins the championship
- 50% Hamilton wins the driver's championship
- 10% All drivers for the top 4 teams win a race.","['90% - More different GP winners than in 2023\n\n50% - McLaren to win both championships\n\n10% - 3+ rookies will outscore their teammates', '90% MBS gets something thrown at him from the crowd\n50% the swearing fines get dropped\n10% Yuki has a good enough year to actually deserve a RB seat', '90% Ferrari takes the WCC\n\n50% its a four way battle btw Max, Leclerc, Hamilton and Lando for WDC\n\n10% Haas is the 5th team', ""There is no chance in hell Hamilton wins the WDC without Ferrari also winning the WCC. He has the strongest and most experienced team mate of all top teams, no way he drops the ball so badly.\n\nAnd since you have McLaren WCC as 90%, Hamilton winning the championship can't be more than 10%, since you realistically can't have both."", '90% McLaren to have 8 or more wins this season \n\n50% George and Max have an inchident which further heats up their rivalry \n\n10% Lindblad replaces Yuki before the season ends.', '* 90% Max wins the drivers championship\n* 50% Ferrari wins the constructors championship\n* 10% Lawson or Antonelli win a race\n\nI don‚Äôt see Lewis outperforming Charles in year one.
