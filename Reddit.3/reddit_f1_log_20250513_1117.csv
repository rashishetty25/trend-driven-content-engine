1kkr2e5,Court documents appear to confirm Peter de Putron is Williams' real owner,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kkr2e5/court_documents_appear_to_confirm_peter_de_putron/,2025-05-12, Discussion,"A few years ago, the F1 journalist Joe Saward wrote [an article](https://joesaward.wordpress.com/2022/05/31/green-notebook-from-solarium-beach/) in which he identified Peter de Putron, an extremely reclusive financier and investor, as the ultimate owner of the Williams F1 team. Saward wrote:

>Back in the summer of 2020, when the Williams team was sold to Dorilton Capital, there was much interest and speculation about who was behind the mysterious investment firm. It was based in New York, but was clearly not an American firm. It was identified only as being a private investment office for an unidentified high worth family.

>I got a tip that the buyer was a Jersey-based entrepreneur called Peter de Putron, but no-one in the team would talk about whether these stories were true. De Putron is so reclusive that there does not seem to be a single photograph of him on the Internet, which makes it quite hard to identify him. ‚Ä¶

>Anyway, to cut a long story short I am certain that de Putron is the man behind Dorilton ‚Äì and I‚Äôll not post any pictures of him because he does not want to be famous.

Saward is a divisive character and it seems some people were suspicious as the source of his 'tip', but I recently came across a [court transcript](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2025/2025-ny-slip-op-30605-u.html) which does appear to prove him right. These court documents relate to an [ongoing lawsuit](https://archive.is/97mXe) brought by Williams' former marketing director, Claudia Schwartz, against [James Matthews](https://www.williamsf1.com/team/james-matthews), another financier and Williams board member (and Pippa Middleton's husband, if you're interested in that sort of thing).

Schwartz's lawyers (based on, among things, testimony from Jost Capito, Williams' former team principal), reveal that:

* de Putron approves (or at least approved) all budgets for Williams Grand Prix Engineering
* Capito was told never to use de Putron's name in discussions about Williams, being informed by the board that ""Peter De Putron is in the background and doesn‚Äôt want to be known or seen that he‚Äôs the owner of Williams""
* Despite this, de Putron is referred to as ""ODL"" (Our Dear Leader) internally
* de Putron is publicly the owner of another Williams-related company, Williams IP Holdings LLC
* The plaintiffs (Dorilton and Williams) tried to prevent de Putron's name being revealed by arguing he is merely ‚Äúan outside investor‚Äù and not the owner

They further conclude that de Putron makes ""all significant decisions‚Äù for both Dorilton Capital Management and Williams Grand Prix Engineering.

The court documents are [freely available](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2025/2025-ny-slip-op-30605-u.html) if you want to dive in further.

De Putron himself seems like an interesting and well-connected character with all kinds of links to politicians and various high-flyers. He is the brother in law of Andrea Leadsom, the former UK health minister, and was at Wharton business school with Matthew Savage, the founder of Dorilton.

It should be noted that Dorilton denies de Putron being involved with Williams in any way, despite Jost Capito's testimony.","[""It's been a minute since we've had a genuine mystery man in F1 at such a high level.

1klhhks,Ferrari: There's an important test in Imola that could be worth a package.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1klhhks/ferrari_theres_an_important_test_in_imola_that/,2025-05-13, News,,"['p5-p7 instead of p6-p8 ü•∂', ""Translation \n\n\nFerrari is facing the almost dramatic technical balance of this first part of the season. The SF-25 was unable to live up to the great expectations of the beginning of the year. The car proved to be semi-unknown in the first laps of testing, which made Maranello realize that it had to fight important, totally unexpected limits. Disqualification aside, Miami was the low point for Fred Vassuer's team, with the car that - on a difficult track anyway - competed in the role of fifth force behind the Williams, reaching the finish line almost a minute behind the McLarens. A scenario that was not even imaginable in the most negative expectations of the beginning of the year. The post-GP debrief had many points for reflection and Lewis Hamilton in particular discussed the implementation of some choices on the track. There was not much positive to bring from Florida. Looking at the data, numerically it is as if Ferrari had been a year behind in development ,seeing the average gap suffered by the MCL39. The race for updates is something that might not be enough, which is why, as we already told you exclusively last week , Loic Serra has apparently made the decision to push for changes to the mechanical platform with interventions to the rear suspension.\n\n\nThe mistakes made on the SF-25 originate in the idea behind the concept. The puzzle is ‚Äúsolved‚Äù and the development plan has changed\n\n\nImola is one of the two big home events of the Prancing Horse team, which is why, regardless of the problems, there is great expectation around the team. Ferrari arrives in Imola with simulator work still in progress that sees both Prancing Horse drivers busy in arriving with the best setup, an aspect in which there were several difficulties in Miami. The information we have on the evolution front of the SF-25 allows us to say that the development program has changed substantially . All this since the critical issues of the SF-25 emerged, limited by a rear end that mechanically does not allow it to fully exploit the aerodynamic needs of the surface . The potential that Frederic Vassuer refers to is hidden behind a single-seater that cannot express the real aerodynamic load available, seen only in very few glimpses of this first part of the season.\n\n\nProject 677 changed the entire mechanical platform compared to the SF-24, with a change of layout at the front and a completely updated and extreme rear suspension in concept despite remaining a tie rod.  Someone in the corridors of Ges believes that a mistake was made in the operation of the car . in other words they failed to interpret the aeromechanical platform correctly, remaining faithful to some concepts of the old car despite the radical changes.\n\n\nIn Emilia-Romagna no big package: in 2024 the evolved SF-24 arrived in Imola, today we wait to see (also) what happens with the directive from Spain. The corrections of 2025 will be profound if it is worth it.\n\n\nThe wind tunnel simulation data has always given very positive feedback in terms of the amount of load generated, however this cannot be fully exploited. With the problems revealed in Australia, Loic Serra has carried out an ‚Äúinterim‚Äù job to unravel the SF-25 enigma , up to considering a possible and almost concrete ‚Äúin-season‚Äù intervention on the rear mechanics. All this has led to a reorganisation of the developments planned for the SF-25, with the exception of the Bahrain package, already decided before Australia.\n\n\nLast year, the Imola race was one of the most important stages of the year in terms of development, while this year on the banks of the Santerno river it is worth noting that the possibility of introducing an updated SF-25 in the floor or body has never been examined . Everything has been postponed until after the Spanish GP , and is currently in the pipeline both in terms of decision-making and timing. Barcelona represents a watershed on the technical front to understand how the balance of cars with stiffer wings will change, especially for those teams that have based much of their firepower on the deformation of the front. The attitude on the technical directive front from Ferrari has returned a fair neutrality on the possible advantages and disadvantages of tightening the static controls of the front wings, but it is no coincidence that for many teams large evolutionary packages for the floor and body are planned for after Spain.\n\n\nAt Imola there will be Serra who is working quietly. While Ferrari will test an experimental rear brake grip, it is no coincidence\n\n\nTechnical director Loic Serra is expected to return to the track, inside the Scuderia garages to closely monitor operations. AutoRacer has information that suggests Imola will be a round with no significant new features on the SF-25. At the circuit named after Enzo and Dino Ferrari, the red car is scheduled to carry out a one-off test involving the use of a new rear brake duct , updated in the internal ducts, both for aerodynamic reasons and for different cooling management.\n\n\nIt is clear that both Ferrari and other teams, as we have already told you , are trying to replicate the ‚ÄúMcLaren effect‚Äù to avoid overheating the rear tires through the internal fluid dynamics of the baskets. The test will be a real experiment on the track to see the effect on the tires, to verify any advantages and disadvantages in conditions that are difficult to faithfully replicate in simulation. In Bahrain, as we have told you , the rear brake intake had been updated in the internal ducts, even if this type of modification may not be ‚Äúlisted‚Äù in the lists of technical innovations that the FIA releases every race weekend, which is why it is likely that this one may also be omitted. The modifications will also affect the wheel corner where the fins located in the internal area of the brake intake will be updated."", 'So no upgrades in Imola but we get a test for the rear brake duct to see if Ferrari can see an improvement on tire management', 'A new dosage of hopium has dropped but Fred my man, the stuff is getting weaker and weaker.', ""We'll always have next update and next year"", 'https://preview.redd.it/4imsvlmkqi0f1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69a0e86ea9f0cdbbb852197385caf1077f4337b', 'So hopelessness is the key?']",30,8,0.97,30,7,7,19,3,0.04999999999999993,19
