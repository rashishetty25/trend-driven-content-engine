Charles should have listened to those words of wisdom.', '(By Par Alexandre)\n\nScuderia Ferrari, struggling at the start of the season, suffered a particularly dramatic setback at the Chinese Grand Prix. After finishing in 5th place, Charles Leclerc was disqualified from the final standings due to a weight problem, a costly penalty for Ferrari in the championship race. But while the official reason was linked to a lack of weight under the regulation 800 kg, a new revelation from Fred Vasseur, Ferrari\'s main team, brings to light an additional and rather unusual cause for this disqualification.\n\nLeclerc had done everything right during the race, but once on the scales, Ferrari\'s SF-25 turned out to be slightly under the minimum required weight of 799.4 kg, after removing the two liters of fuel needed for post-race analysis. This missing kilo was enough to disqualify the Monegasque driver. At first glance, this might appear to be a purely mechanical infringement, but it seems there was more to it than that.\n\nRemember the exchange between Leclerc and his race engineer at the Australian Grand Prix? It should already have aroused suspicion: ""Is there a leakage? ... I have a full seat of water, like, full of water!"" What appeared to be an amusing exchange at the time of the race turned out to be the same reason why the single-seater lost weight at the Chinese Grand Prix. Indeed, according to Fred Vasseur, it wasn\'t just tire wear that contributed to the disqualification, but also the loss of a liter of water due to a failure in Charles Leclerc\'s drink supply.\n\n**In an interview with L\'Équipe newspaper, Fred Vasseur revealed that the situation was far more complex than a simple question of worn tires: ""Charles Leclerc\'s downgrading on Sunday is similar to what happened to Russell last year in Belgium,"" he explained. ""The tires are only part of the explanation... We also lost a liter of water when Charles\' drink supply leaked. Downgrading for weight is always an addition of small factors.""**\n\nFerrari being the limit of all parameters at the Chinese Grand Prix, it was this missing liter of water that played a key role in Leclerc\'s disqualification. A cause which might seem anecdotal, but which, combined with tire wear, cost Ferrari dearly. Frédéric Vasseur adds: ""The aim of the game in F1 is to get to the limit of all parameters, everywhere. To get to the last gram of weight, to get to the last tenth of a millimetre of skid, to get to the last millimetre of aileron deformation"". Let\'s hope that this water leak will be definitively repaired for the Japanese Grand Prix.', 'TL;DR: Must be the water.', 'Gotta say, lads\n\nI called it: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/r2hB5SK7Ha', 'Must be the water.', ""Leclerc really is Raikkonen's successor.
