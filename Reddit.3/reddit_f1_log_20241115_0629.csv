1gr9dhs,Pitlane next to the Startingstraight,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gr9dhs/pitlane_next_to_the_startingstraight/,2024-11-14, Discussion,"Hello F1 Peeps,

There is something that recently came into my Head about the Pitlane and it being next to the Start Straight

Is it allowed to have it somewhere else on the track then directly next to eachother? Or maybe it could be arranged that the Pitlane is shortly before the Star finish Line

To my knowledge, it is that way because they wanna save space, but let's say we don't care about space 


Is there any Rule that Dosen't allow you to build a track where the Pitlane and Start Finish Line aren't next to eachother?

I am genuinely curious and want to hear what you have to say/want to tell me","[""You could absolutly put it elsewhere. There's support paddocks in different places in certain tracks like Abu Dhabi. \n\nMain issue would be moving equipment to and from the starting grid before each (support) race. Tyres, laptops, employees on the grid before start, fixing issues before lights out. It would easily become an issue for teams."", ""i feel like its a part of the fia's guidelines and compliance esp when it comes to grade a circuits. plus i think its just majorly convenient for the teams since they dont have to push the car and bring their equipments so far from the paddock"", 'There is no real rules which state it has to be there.        \nThe only thing is that the finish/control line pretty much in all cases tends to be directly opposite race control.        \n\nSo you could have your startline on a different straight but the Finish/control would be by the pitlane.       \nA number of Formula E circuit have operated like this in the past due to the nature of trying to squeeze circuits into tight areas. \n\n[Diriyah as an example](https://i.imgur.com/b1kVWIe.png) has the start point on the longest straight but the finish line is opposite the pitlane.', ""It's just functionality.

If they are far from each other, the teams should walk a long way to the pitbox (and might not be in time for the first pitstop in case of  first lap damage, for example).  \nIn Zandvoort the starting grid is a bit further away from the pitlane, to give the cars a decent run upto turn 1. Because the top team has de first garages in de pitlane, they don't have to walk too far if they qualify at the front.
