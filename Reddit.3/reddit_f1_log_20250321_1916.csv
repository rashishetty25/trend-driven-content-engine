1jg233o,TIL about how Chris Amon was possibly one of the greatest and most underrated drivers in F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jg233o/til_about_how_chris_amon_was_possibly_one_of_the/,2025-03-20, Throwback,"When we talk about underrated drivers we always come up with more modern era drivers, but when we think about the older era drivers, I think the biggest name that pops to my mind is that of Chris Amon.

In my humble opinion, Chris Amon was a great and versatile driver who just never had the luck or reliability to win a Grand Prix, and if I may say, if he got to drive with Ferrari in their early 60 era, he may have been a contender for a championship. Ferrari in the late 60s were just struggling to keep up with Lotus, Brabham and Matra International (future Tyrrell) so getting podiums quite consistently was an amazing feat by Amon.

He was also very capable of doing great with a newcomer such as March in 1970, being able to finish at the podium a three times (2 second places and one third) that season (although the 701 was quite a competitive chassis overall). Even at his brief stint at Matra in 1971 and 1972 he was able to get two poles (1971 Italian GP and 1972 French GP) with a car that was just not as good as before.

To sum it up, Chris Amon is not talked about much due to how long it has been since he last competed in F1, but his record shows how much of a wasted talent he was, maybe if he got a seat at Lotus in 68' he could have won a race ir maybe a few more, we will never know how good this man truly could have been.

And to quote Mario Andretti on how unlucky Amon was: ""if he became an undertaker, people would stop dying"", or even legendary Ferrari engineer Mauro Forghieri: ""by far the best test driver I have ever worked with. He had all the qualities to be a World Champion but bad luck just wouldn't let him be"".","['If you were a Kiwi, your dad would have been telling you this ever since you were old enough to remember. \n\nFun fact: Brendon Hartley is the second unluckiest driver.', ""My favourite quote regarding Amon has to be that Andretti one (edit: I initially repeated the quote because I can't read). \n\nAmon himself always said later in life that he was lucky to just have survived the era of formula 1 he raced in (unlike Clark, Rindt, Cevert, and so many others).\n\nIn my totally unbiased kiwi opinion I reckon he was the best driver to never win a race."", 'Really was the best part of that late 60s Ferrari team.

\#6: Turkey 2020. One of the most legendary drives from one of the most legendary seasons of all time. You could have made an entire episode just about Lewis for that 2020 season. Netflix, how do you miss Silverstone AND Turkey, AND give him a shitty BLM bit at the end? Such an epic and noteworthy season from LH was done dirty.

\#7: Silverstone 2024. Lewis again! This win is an all-timer F1 race, momentous for Lewis and bittersweet for Mercedes given they parted ways. They're gonna regret not giving this more attention, though I do get Russell being the focus of their Merc episode.

\#8: Qatar 2024. Underrated pick, but Stake/Kick/Sauber/Alfa Romeo get no attention on DTS, so Zhou miraculously getting points to avoid a 0-point season for the team warranted some attention. (I doubt they would have touched on the mirror/puncture/safety drama, or the FIA might've had their heads.) You could maybe squeak the Max-George drama in there, too, but I'm sure they'll cook with that later.

\#9: Azerbaijan 2024, specifically Williams' double points finish. I'm sure they had their hands tied with that race covering the frontrunner drama, but a DOUBLE POINTS FINISH for the team that finished 9th AND had a young driver in his 2nd ever F1 race should have been mentioned. (I get them not covering Bearman in Saudi because his race seat was all but guaranteed, so I bet they played it safe and figured they could give him more depth in Season 8, like they did with George Russell the year after Sakhir 2020.)

\#10: Brazil 2023. Aston Martin making a late push to hang on to 4th in the championship, with some Fernando magic sprinkled on top. C'mon it was a photo finish!! Netflix should eat that shit up
