I'll only put the relevant part because the full context might make this more complicated and I am very bad with words.

- Say it's a 50 lap race.
- P1-P7 have lapped P8 down and are on the final lap.
- P1 suffers some failure/crashes/whatever and won't cross the chequered flag.

What we agree on:    
- P1 still classifies because they finished more than 90% of the race.

What we disagree on:    
- I say P1 becomes P7 because they already finished Lap 49 ahead of the other cars and so is ahead of P8.    
- He says P1 becomes last of the Lap 49 finishers because it's a DNF. *(In our scenario, P8-P11 are one lap down, so P1 becomes P11 according to him.)*

I still don't understand his reasoning for the DNF part but I am pretty sure I'm right on this one. However, I don't know how to properly put it into words so maybe someone better at explaining things can help me out.

# The Formation Lap

This week, we’re forgoing the typical *Last Week in Formula 1* preamble in favour of sharing a spot of news, dear reader and fellow racing fan.

There’s changes coming over the next week to *Last Week in Formula 1*, which include a new name and livery, along with the launch of a new weekly feature.

As this humble racing newsletter expands in scope, *Last Week in Formula 1* isn’t broad enough to capture all that will be published, hence the change.

Mums the word for now, but **the announcement will be landing in your inbox on Wednesday November 13th, bright and early at 6:30am PST.**

*(*[*Which is all the more reason to subscribe on Substack if you haven’t already.*](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/)*)*

Until then, you have the latest edition of *Last Week in Formula 1’s* mutterings and musings, twistings and turnings, tidbits and playtime to enjoy below.

*(If you missed last week’s issue,* [*you can find that one here.*](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-october-28-november-3-2024)*)*

**Now, for the uninitiated:** 

If you’re a rookie ‘round these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly feature compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world into one easy, breezy, beautiful read.

Every fun fact, story, and piece of news has been sourced from posts in r/formula1 (AKA: Formula 1’s publicly accessible online paddock).

Given this is The Internet, I suggest taking everything you read with a grain of salt. However, over many years of following the subreddit, there’s far more truth than lies posted—and much of the news comes from reputable sources.

Lastly, like the cars we enjoy watching so much, *Last Week in Formula 1* and   *nope, not this time either!* are in a constant state of development. Any feedback you have on what’s covered, the format, or anything I may have missed is welcome in the comments.

Now let’s hit the track…

\~\~\~

# Trackside Stats

***Behold:***

* [The laps lead leaderboard in 2024.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjex8o/f1_laps_led_in_2024/)
* [The WDC state of play with 3 rounds remaining.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjk67a/f1_team_standings_after_2124_rounds/)
* [The WCC state of play with 3 rounds left](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1go45o8/f1_2023_vs_2024_constructor_standings_after_21/) (and compared to last year).

Proving that Maxi’s 4th WDC title has never *really* been in doubt or danger, despite Red Bull’s travails and McLaren’s rise, [Max has *still* scored more points than Lando since Miami](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gla8v2/max_vs_lando/), when McLaren’s season began gaining steam.

A whopping [*nine* of Max’s laps around Interlagos were good enough to claim Fastest Lap honours…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjk9iv/f1_nine_of_max33verstappens_lap_times_in_brazil/) His best being over a second quicker than Lando’s best.

Owing to… I’m not sure what, a mixed bag of causes I’m sure… [Pierre Gasly has achieved 3 out 5 of his F1 podiums when starting from 10th or worse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjv0tv/fun_fact_pierre_gasly_has_achieved_3_out_of_his_5/)

For those following the riveting Black vs. Yellow T-Cam 2024 Championship, [here are the updated standings after Round 21](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl4hjc/black_vs_yellow_tcam_2024_championship_standings/) went down in São Paulo.

Courtesy of my future friends at The Race, check out this breakdown of [winners after 21 rounds last year vs. this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glugnk/the_race_winners_after_21_races_in_2023_vs/)… And hold on to your butt!

Alas… [Only 184 laps remain in this season for the ages.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gne0sw/f1_the_racing_has_been_fantastic_this_year_and_we/) Enjoy them all!

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

Is this news if hardly anyone is surprised? In an officially official statement, [Sauberaudi have confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkth3f/stake_f1_team_kick_sauber_team_statement/) that [Valtteri Bottas](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkyowb/valtteri_bottas_after_three_years_at_stakef1team/) and Zhou [Guanyu](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gktmna/zhou_guanyu_personal_statement/) will be leaving the team after this season, [paving the way for Nico Hulkenberg and… ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkuhzn/f1_the_2025_sauber_driver_lineup/)

[Gabriel Bortoleto, who has been *confirmed* as a Sauberaudi driver for 2025. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkuhzn/f1_the_2025_sauber_driver_lineup/)

*(I’m pleased as punch about this development, as I’ve been super impressed with Young Gabriel over his last two feeder series seasons, and am eager to see what he can do in Formula 1—even if he is driving a tractor initially).*

As for Sauberaudi’s departing drivers, Zhou’s future is an uncertain mystery, while [Valtteri seems headed for a reserve/development role at Mercedes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl6o1y/mercedes_hinting_a_bottas_return_probably_as_a/)

In a poignant marking of this ending era at Sauberaudi, [former team strategist (under their Alfa Romeo guise) Ruth Buscombe Divey penned this *adorable* goodbye post honouring her time with Valtteri and Zhou.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gli4f3/thank_you_for_every_undercut_every_overcut_every/)

Meanwhile, [folks around the paddock seem rather confident that the Argentine surprise, Franco Colapinto, will be on the grid next year](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl3o1t/campeonesnet_mar%C3%ADa_catarineu_when_asked_to_rate/), somehow.

And if The Race is reporting that Franco is firmly [“In Red Bull Frame As Perez Replacement Option”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glmqc0/colapinto_in_red_bull_frame_as_perez_replacement/) for 2025 there’s *definitely* fire amongst all the smoke.

I don’t want to put too much stock in this, because Flavio Briatore mostly, but *apparently* Flavio has changed his mind on Jack Doohan sitting in their car next year and [he’s giving Franco the “I want you” stare from across the room.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glzwer/la_gazzetta_dello_sport_flavio_briatore_has/)

In other driver news… [Shots have been fired from the portside cannons at FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem, courtesy of the Grand Prix Drivers Association (GDPA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glni62/grandprixdriversassociation_on_instagram_gpda/). Rightfully so, they’re fed up with the FIA’s nitpicking of silly things like underwear, jewelry, [and their very expensive swear jar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnj2dg/formula_1s_drivers_are_fighting_for_their_right/)

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

To the collective pain of Williams fans the world round, the team that’s been showing much promise and signs of growth this season, are having to accept that all may be for naught, at least in terms of rising in the WCC standings. 

Team Principal [James Vowles gave his honest assessment](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjkcdg/f1_im_hurting_right_now_james_vowles_gives_his/) of a torrid Brazilian Grand Prix weekend that began with so much promise, and was undone by big crashes and Alpine’s shock double podium rubbing salt in their wounds.

Speaking of Williams and their travails, in addition to likely losing $30 million in prize money, their recent spate of damages has them in a spot of bother, [leaving them uncertain of what car spec they can bring to Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glunax/unsustainable_run_of_damage_leaves_williams/)

The Middle East Oil Barons’ gradual takeover of Formula 1 continues, with [Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund set to buy a minority stake in what is becoming the Audi F1 team.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gmnca2/tobi_gruner_according_to_our_information_qatars/) Audi will retain full control, but gain a cash infusion for investments into their Hinwil factory and such.

*NOW BRACE YOURSELF:* [Rotational European races are coming.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glw38h/domenicali_rotational_f1_races_in_europe_coming/)

# Technical Tidbits

Mercedes have published a book! [And yes… Toto printed out a copy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glvgij/mercedesamgf1_toto_have_you_got_our_new_book_yet/)

If you, like me, are a sucker for film photos… I must insist you check out u/jameypricephoto’s [sweet, filmy snaps from the Brazilian Grand Prix.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/new/)

In case you missed this last week, here are some more shots of [*stupid sexy Charles* *and his stupid sexy new Ferrari SF90 XX Stradle.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gmw3uh/charles_leclercs_new_custom_ferrari_sf90_xx/) \#6 is my fave.

Alex Albon also joined the ranks of F1 drivers receiving fancy new wheels this week, [whose Porsche 911 GT3 RS has me yearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnjwzd/alex_albons_new_porsche_911_gt3_rs/)… *Do you ever yearn?*

Meme Lord Max Verstappen [pulled out *all* the stops on his livery for the 23 Hour Race for Mental Health](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnfm4u/max_verstappens_livery_for_the_23h_race_for/) he competed in over the weekend.

Most teams would rather tough out a 1 stop than eat a 20-30sec loss traversing the pits a second time. You more often see 2 stop gambles being made in the midfield. \n\nMandatory 3 compounds would introduce the possibility of greater tyre differential among the field, which I think is the angle he's going for. But it doesn't eliminate the problem of these tyres needing to be nursed. Slap on some softs against hard runner, and you still only get a handful of laps before they're cooked. \n\nAlso I'm not really in favour of regulating sport to manufacture outcomes. If anything F1 needs less regulation to open up innovation. Let the cost cap control the arms race.

One of the better strategy discussions at races is if a team will one stop or two stop. Forcing two stops will eliminate that part of the strategy.\n\nI can't remember which one it was, but there was a race in the last couple of years where Pirelli forced it to be two-stop because of a last minute weakness they'd identified in the tyres.\n\nTeams basically had a choice of 5 laps each time to choose when to pit, so there was _some_ strategy.\n\nThe really distinctive feature however is with two stops, the fastest way to win a race was to treat it as three all-out sprints with no tyre management at quali-pace. It was the closest to late 90s racing I'd seen in a while. The drivers were gassed after it.\n\nI'd go one further myself: give teams a free choice of all five compounds per race, but mandate two stops minimum.
