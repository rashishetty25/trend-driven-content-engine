Everyone is acting like this is the first regulation change. \n\nYes the cars will suck at first. Yes they'll be slow. Yes there'll be problems. Yes it's gonna get better. Yes they're gonna change it again just when it starts getting good."", '>“Obviously when you have a much bigger proportion of electrical power and a smaller proportion of ICE power, and you don\'t have batteries that are discharging over the entire race distance, then energy management becomes a bit more of a challenge,"" said Tombazis.\n\n>“Now the opportunity of these new cars for the participating manufacturers is to develop the batteries, the electrical systems, and so on. I think we will see some innovation on the electrical side of the engine next year, which I think will be good. But clearly there are some challenges with the energy management, and the noises that we hear are usually related to that.”\n\nI feel like Formula E should be this.\n\n>Tombazis is expecting, however, that things won’t be as dramatic as portrayed by some of the drivers. “We haven\'t finished the rules yet in that respect,"" he added. ""The rules are evolving and we knew of these issues from day one. The moment you reduce one power, and you increase the other one, we knew that there were issues to address.”\n\nI feel like its a bit late to jig things too much\n\n> “We have to go through an approval process with the PU manufacturers, so we can\'t just unilaterally make a change tomorrow,"" said Tombazis. ""But by and large, when we address specific problems, teams and PU manufacturers tend to be relatively helpful. I think what we have now and what we\'ll have at the beginning of next year is not exactly the same thing. I\'m not saying it will be completely different, but there will definitely be a lot of evolution between now and the start.”\n\n> It\'s important to note that this evolution does not apply to engine hardware. Nothing will change in the engine formula, and with work already underway, it would also be too late for that. Moreover, any proposals in that direction would descend into a political battle between manufacturers confident in their 2026 projects and those who prefer adjustments.\n\nMore interesting sections', 'They’re trying to stop the 2026 Hulkenberg WDC', 'Stop doing unnatural things to the rules FIA. \n\nSo far there has been 5 different bandaid solutions of what seems more and more like poorly thought out limitations on power split and delivery for purely marketing reasons', 'High nose “zombie spike” cars confirmed.', 'Yes, because a jet engine strapped to a wing was fairly natural already…']",532,125,0.98,532,118,118,532,125,0.98,532

This is one of the cars from the Bernie Ecclestone Collection. Red Bull purchased the entire collection and plans to build a museum at the Red Bull Ring to display them. if you do not know, Bernie had put together a collection of some of the most important cars in the history of F1. In addition to this 158, he has early Ferraris and Vanwalls. He has the Brabhams from his years of owning the team including the only known surviving fan car. While Bernie owned the collection few of the cars were seen. It is nice to see that Red Bull are dusting them off for people to see.","[""Imagine.

I contacted them to see if they would make those histories available. Sadly they said they are the property of whoever buys the cars. Hopefully Red Bull makes he information available.

Knowing this, he\'s reported to have walked back to the pitlane, told the team it was a stall and the car wouldn\'t restart, and left before they got the car back in...well.. the state it is at the end of this video.
