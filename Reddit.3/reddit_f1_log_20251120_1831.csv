Probably not in the first year, considering it's also the first year of the new regulations and they're building their own power unit for the first time, that's bound to come with a lot of challenges. But they've been making all the right decisions so far: selecting experienced (and good) key people, moving facilities in order to attract young prospects, always walking step by step. I could see them becoming a very solid team from 2027 onward.\n\nAlso that's a really nice article, Wheatley complementing the Sauber team on how they improved this year and were almost able to rebuild Gabi's car in Brazil, something he says wouldn't be possible the year before is a very important point. \n\nWinning teams aren't only about having the best car, but the whole team of mechanics and engineers need to be on the same page, I like to point out to the race where Red Bull was able to rebuild Max's suspension on the grid in record time, I love to follow the comms during that whole ordeal. \n\nAt the end of the day the whole team needs to believe on themselves and Sauber/Audi seems to believe on their own potential and goals.""]",31,3,0.93,31,3,3,7,0,0.050000000000000044,7
