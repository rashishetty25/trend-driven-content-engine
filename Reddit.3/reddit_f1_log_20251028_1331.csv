There's a maximum of 43 points available each weekend (25 for the fastest stop, 18 for the second fastest stop), which means that McLaren can only earn 4x43=172 points at most, which isn't enough to close the 204-point gap, even if Ferrari failed to score a single point at the next four races.

1ohfsft,Made a 2025 championship points calculator...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohfsft/made_a_2025_championship_points_calculator/,2025-10-27, Statistics,"Made a little Oscar/Lando/Max points calculator to simulate the last 4 circuits of the year.

Pick their finishing orders, see how the points pan out and visualize it on the graph. You can also expand each driver’s row to see their previous results at each track.

Made it for myself to play with different outcomes, but curious how you lot think the points will land...
