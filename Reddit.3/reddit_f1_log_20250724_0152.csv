1m7gfbg,"I Drove a Real F1 Car at Magny-Cours — Full Experience, Cost, Driving Impressions (w/ Video)",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m7gfbg/i_drove_a_real_f1_car_at_magnycours_full/,2025-07-23, Discussion,"So today I got to live out a lifelong dream and drove a real F1 car around the Magny-Cours Grand Prix circuit. This is an unapologetically long post for anyone curious about what it actually entails—cost, experience, driving impressions, and more. There’s a video link down below, and I’ll do my best to answer any questions you’ve got!

Big thanks to my incredible wife and family for making this dream a reality for my 40th birthday. 🥹

**TL;DR:**

Yes, it’s every bit as awesome as you imagine—and totally worth it.

# Cost:

Let’s get this part out of the way: it’s not cheap.

* Formula Renault: 2x 15-minute sessions
* F1 Car: 1 out lap + 3 flying laps
* Price: \~€2800 total
* Insurance: €8000 excess if you crash the F1 car
   * Optional insurance available for €350 to reduce excess to €4000
   * I skipped it. My strategy was simple: don’t crash.

# Briefing & Organisation:

As a non-French speaker, I was a bit nervous about language barriers—but the staff were amazing. They went out of their way to make sure I was fully included, even doing dual-language briefings just for me.

They also gave me a personal track guide with an instructor, while the French attendees were grouped 8 to a minibus. I got to ask loads of questions!

The briefings were solid, with useful instruction on things like weight transfer and the grip circle—a helpful way of visualizing how lateral loads impact traction.

# The Track – Magny-Cours:

One of the main reasons I picked this experience was the track. Not many F1 driving experiences let you drive on a real Grand Prix circuit—but Magny-Cours absolutely is one.

* Long straights where you can go flat out
* Proper heavy braking zones
* Wide range of corners
* Cones marked braking, turn-in, apex, and exit points
* No restrictions on pace—coaching was designed to help you go faster, not just stay safe

After this, Magny-Cours is now one of my favorite tracks.

# The Cars:

**Formula Renault**

These are not slow.  
Acceleration was wild, but the car was approachable enough to build confidence. Still had more than enough power to bite—multiple people spun during the morning.

By the end of my sessions, I felt like I was really starting to explore the car’s limits.

**F1 Car – Benetton B198**

* 1998 Benetton B198 chassis
* Original V10 replaced with a 3.5L Cosworth HB V8 (same spec Schumacher used to win the 1994 title)
* Still over 600hp
* No joke.

# The Driving Experience:

Their starter was broken, so I got a push start—old school!

* Launch: 2nd gear, clutch in, exactly 5% throttle (displayed on the wheel), then clutch drop on command… and you’re driving a freaking F1 car.
* Gearbox: Paddle shifts are violent—instant upshifts, jarring downshifts. Get it done in a straight line if you can.
* Braking: After being told to “stop braking like a grandma” in the Renault, I overcooked it and locked up on my first fast lap (big smokey lock up...). Backed it off slightly after that. Still, incredible stopping power.
* Steering: Heavy. After 4 laps, my arms were toast. These big tyres don’t turn themselves.
* Power: It’s not the original V10, but it’s still ferocious. I applied the same throttle I had in the Renault… then found another couple of centimetres of pedal travel and entered warp speed. You’ll hear in the video when I hit the “party zone” of the throttle—it just goes.
* Cornering felt solid, but I was cautious with throttle application—€8000 reasons not to spin...

# Post-Lap Emotions:

When I got out, I was literally shaking from adrenaline. Genuinely got emotional—tears and all. It was one of those rare life moments where the dream actually lives up to the hype.

# The Video:

I wasn’t going for lap records—I pushed as much as my wallet would let me. Please be kind, but critique away:

He's one of my favorite drivers, but I'm curious to hear from those who followed the sport back when he was promoted—how was it received at the time? Was he seen as an obvious choice, or did it come as a surprise?","[""Naturally I think. The thing is Rosberg's retirement came out of nowhere. He literally won the title and retired. Everyone expected him to be at Mercedes for the next few years. So when it happen, Toto had to work fast. Bottas was, and still his, managed by him and he was seen back them as potential world champion by some, and if not, a really fast driver by others. So it was the natural choice."", 'He was the obvious choice. He was a massively exciting prospect, handpicked by Frank Williams and lived up to the hype in his rookie season of 2013 (especially in Canada/USA) in a terrible car. Then he was consistently fighting for podiums in 2014-2016 and was managed by Toto Wolf so everyone knew he was the next in line. Nobody expected it to come so soon with Rosberg retiring, but it was an obvious move.', 'It was a bit of a no brainer given the timing. It was really clear that Bottas was fast, he was performing well in the williams at a time when williams were performing ok. They needed a driver fast, there was already the strong relationship between Merc and williams, who else would they go for?', ""So Rosberg's exit was a massive shock to everyone including Mercedes\n\nThey had no backup plan\n\nPretty much everyone at that point was tied down, locked in a contract. Though Toto said pretty much every F1 driver bar 2 phoned him about the seat (Kimi Raikkonen & Danil Kyvat).\n\nThere was some memes and jokes from Max and Mercedes twitter account about Max replacing Nico. But obviously this was not that serious, Max was not leaving Red Bull and Red Bull would not let Max break his contract anyway, and some people were hopeful Alonso would get the seat, but again in a contract (and also spygate).\n\nThe only feasible option was Pascal Werhlein the Mercedes junior driver who was in Manor. Manor was a Mercedes customer team and Mercedes got to choose one of the drivers for a manor seat as part of the deal.\n\nThe problem with Pascal is he was a rookie in 2016 and only had 1 years experience. So Mercedes were concerned he did not have enough experience, so they were also exploring the option of paying Williams to release Bottas from his contract. Bottas was chosen as an alternate option because Williams were a team that financially would probably accept a monetary offer to break a driver contract (Ferrari and Red Bull wouldn't) and Bottas was seen as a good driver, future top team material.\n\nBottas was THE BEST driver Mercedes had a reasonable chance of breaking the contract on\n\nHowever it was obviously still a very expensive option, because you have to pay Williams as well as Bottas.\n\nWhen it became clear these were the 2 options Mercedes were exploring. People were very much hoping Mercedes would go for Bottas, fearing Werhlein would mean a boring F1 Season with Hamilton having no challenge, But people were skeptical Mercedes would spend the money to break Bottas contract\n\nWhen they did go for Bottas i think some people were pleasantly surprised, and very happy about it. Despite dominating Mercedes had garnered a lot of good faith (particularly after Bahrain 2014) from the fans for allowing their 2 drivers to race and allowing 2 strong drivers .

Damn, it's so hard to see the past and then analyze how did the sport evolved in terms of corporate interests, money flow, and drivers statements for the media.

What would drivers say today if we would be still in some sort of 2010 environment, in where we had these gigachads statements only saying truth about their feelings of the tracks

We now see today 2025 that Spa-Francorchamps wont be in 2028 nor in 2030, and we are having more urban GPS than ever in some countries where racing is not a culture but only a way to show how can you interfere in a sport with money

And im not saying that this is wrong, imola for example is in terms of capital, non-viable, but all these new gps are necesary?

Dont you miss less censorship from drivers? Have media gone too far in terms of needing drivers to be ""friendly"" in their statements towards FIA decisions?","['>What would drivers say today if we would be still in some sort of 2010 environment, in where we had these gigachads statements only saying truth about their feelings of the tracks\n\nJust for the benefit of giving both sides here from that same weekend:         \n\n>But Petrov raised concerns about the circuit: “I’m not sure the track is right for today’s F1 cars,” he said yesterday. “You get very close to the walls and it’s maybe a bit small for the cars now, but it’s still a good challenge putting together a quick lap.”       \n>He told Autosport today: “I don’t think we should have come here.
