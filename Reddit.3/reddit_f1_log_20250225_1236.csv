Then again, if you look at Prost in qualifying, his record against Hill seems fairly consistent with his record against Alesi in 91. Am I right in thinking Hill’s best year was 93? Or am I simply underrating Hill in general?', 'Rumor has it, they have gone for a radical redesign of their floor, which is, unfortunately, not visible in any pics.', ""I'm going to just have it on in the background as a podcast.

1ix1lcv,Carlos Sainz’s ‘two top drivers’ dig after Red Bull snub,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ix1lcv/carlos_sainzs_two_top_drivers_dig_after_red_bull/,2025-02-24, News,,"[""Ahh we're back with the clickbait titles.\nHe didn't say this randomly and was referring to Williams and their line up when talking about this and what he would do if he was the team principal."", "">“Lando and I, Charles and I or Alex and I – two top drivers,” Sainz told\xa0\n\nLando and Charles yes. Alex? We'll see about that."", ""What Sainz is conveniently not thinking of is that you get someone like Verstappen or MSC once in a lifetime in your team. So it's best to do build everything around them. But no active driver would want to acknowledge this."", ""When Sainz left they had Verstappen paired with Ricciardo, I think it's fair to say those where two top drivers, probably more so than Verstappen + Sainz would be.\n\nAfter that they promoted from within, with little success.\n\nAfter that, they signed a top mid-field driver, who was at the time comfortably the strongest driver not already locked in with a team. Nobody really forsaw the total collapse he had.\n\nI don't think you can say Red Bull actively avoided having a strong driver next to Verstappen, they've not really had better options. Except maybe Sainz this year, but then is there really much reason to assume he'd do better than Perez? They tried getting a respected experienced driver from the outside and it didn't work out at all, why try the same thing again instead of promoting from within like they used to do?"", 'His statement will look a little bit weird in hindsight if Lawson is closer to Verstappen than Albon was.', 'I mean,  Marko (I know that old wind bag is full of shit) said about driver #2.  \n\n“He should become a consistent points scorer and help Max when he needs to, not try to,” he told”\n\nThat’s why they didn’t sign Carlos.  He is not that.', 'If Albon is deemed to be a top driver like Sainz claims, surely Lawson would be in the same category as a top driver?', ""Basically as we observed last year: because if you won't win the WCC, you could well win the WDC.\n\nMarko himself observed similar a while ago, that if the top 4 teams are very close in 2025, then being clear #1 is a massive advantage for Verstappen."", ""RBR wants to keep Max happy so he doesn't leave.  And the way to do that is to continue to give him weak 2nd drivers.  To be mentioned among the all-time greats one needs to have very good 2nd teammates to challenge them -- to really show the world how great they are.  Otherwise, it will always be: It was the car.  In this case: it was always Newey.""]",0,105,0.49,0,638,638,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0
