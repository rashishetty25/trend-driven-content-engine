1lvuyy0,No situations for wet tyres.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvuyy0/no_situations_for_wet_tyres/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"I must say I find it pretty annoying that there seems to be an overlap between intermediate tyres and SC/VSC/🚩. At Silverstone it seemed like Race Control had a perfect opportunity to let the teams squabble with tyre choices, as the forecast said there would be around ten minutes of rain, and no more to follow.

The obvious quandary is about safety, and as Martin Brundle said on commentary, he agreed with the decision of the safety car, because the standing water started to endanger the cars of aquaplaning. Personally I think a VSC would be sufficient in that instance, if anything, particularly for letting Piastri keep his advantage.

I remember that less than a decade ago, half of the pack used wet and the other half intermediate tyres in conditions like that, and I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution. I'm also wondering what other people's thoughts and opinions are, hence this post.

I clearly don't want drivers in danger, but like we often say, they are professionals and we need to trust that they will take precaution too. I think I lean towards letting them drive and enjoying the peril as a spectator, not of damage or injury, but of race-changing incidents due to the challenging conditions.","[""> I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution\n\nIt is the aero design of this regulation. It wasn't as bad in the beginning when teams were figuring it out still and having to raise ride height, but they've all dialed in so much now that the cars all produce more spray. So the increased spray combined with conditions that would warrant wet tires mean that visibility is not good enough to race safely where it would have been in past years, plus I think the sport is just more safety-minded in general now. That's my understanding at least. Happy to hear if others think there are other factors."", 'What changed is that the current generation of cars generate so much spray that when the conditions are bad enough for wets, visibility is dangerously bad. No amount of trusting drivers to “take precautions” matters when they can’t see anything more than 20 yards in front of them.', ""I feel it's a very mixed situation. \n\nThe wet tires are to no use at this moment. The spray that they, in combination with this era of ground effect cars, cause limits visibility so much that you cannot safely drive, let alone race. So by the time the weather becomes bad enough, it's time for a Safety car or a Red flag even. The Dutch GP of 2023 showed that really well. \n\nAlso it doesn't help that the crossover between Inters and Wets is at that same point where racing just becomes impossible. So teams tend to just stick to Inters, because chance is more likely that race is gonna get neutralized at that point anyway. \n\nAnd the reason to get a Full Safety car over a VSC, wasn't to ruin Piastri's advantage. It was for the safety of all drivers. Remember that Bernd Mayländer has all the information on track conditions, if there is a really wet part of the track he can limit the pace of all cars and have them evade especially risky puddles. while the movement of the cars, especially in closer proximity of each other, works really well to dry the track out. That's why sometimes after a heavy rain before a race start, they have 2-3 or even 4 formation laps, just to dry the track out. \n\nBut we'll see, Pirelli said that the usability window for wets should be better. And i hope the design of the 2026 cars limit spray somewhat more so we can actually have racing in the wet."", 'As a related issue, do safety cars actually make wet situations less safe? \n\nBy bunching cars up and then releasing them with cold tyres in wet conditions aren’t you just increasing the likelihood of a crash. Wouldn’t it be better to try and keep some distance between cars when they are released, like the VSC?', 'They can’t use the full wet because the amount of spray generated by an amount of water necessitating the full wet + the spray generated by the floor is extreme and visibility goes to zero.', 'Forecast was rain in ten minutes, initially light then heavier before tailing off. Not ‘dry in ten minutes’ \n\nIn Brazil they originally let them squabble. It brought out the red flag as certain teams stuck certain drivers on inters for speed and those drivers couldn’t do it. We got a red flag.\n\nRed flags are what race control are trying to avoid. SC for a few laps avoided the a red flag.', ""it's not just about aquaplaning, it's that they literally cant see because of the spray"", 'Beside the spray issues, Pirelli has stated that the wet tyres are overwhelmed by water in really heavy rain, because they cannot get proper data on using these car in the wet due to the races being stopped in bad conditions.', 'but if the wet tires are generating a lot of spray (plus the rest of the car), why they bother to manufacture and bring them to the races?']",153,95,0.81,153,863,863,1,1,0.0,1

At what point has the flow of time changed cars to the point that comparing drivers becomes foolish? For instance our original conversation started with the question: 
“can Jim Clark be called the goat of F1 when he drove a version of F1 cars that didn’t even have downforce”

But one could pose the question saying the same thing about Senna, because his car didn’t have the technology requiring the level of multitasking today’s drivers have to deal with.

So my full question boils down to, were Clark, Senna, Schumacher, and Hamilton even champions of the same sport? Why even compare them in the first place? Because realistically, with a few exceptions of maybe some of the similar era cars. Most of them wouldn’t be able to drive each other’s cars with the same degree of proficiency.
","[""Congratulations! You've successfully achieved the higher level of F1 fandom where you realise trying to compare drivers across vastly different eras is inherently meaningless.\n\nAll you can really do is compare drivers to their peers of the time. In that way, Clark really was on a very special level."", 'even comparing drivers across 2 different regulation cycles is hard, doing it across different eras is literally impossible', 'Absolutely agreed. Hamilton and Verstappen are virtually driving a completely different sport to Fangio and Clark. Murray Walker’s [take](https://youtu.be/CGKsKU0P3oo) at the start of this video has been my view broadly ever since I saw it as a kid. He later says for him Schumacher is his greatest of all time, narrowly ahead of Fangio, but stresses it’s just an opinion and of course that’s a perfectly fine opinion to have (backed up by a long career in F1 journalism). For me, the top tier is Fangio, Clark, Senna, Prost, Schumacher, Hamilton, Verstappen in no particular order. I do not know who I would pick if forced, it would probably change every time.', ""You're right, F1 is unique in that different eras are essentially completely different sports. Generally speaking, apart from tactics and the weight of the ball, football/soccer has been the same for decades. Senna wouldn't be as good as Hamilton in today's machinery, and Clark wouldn't have been as good as Senna in 80s machinery. They're all completely different skillsets."", ""It's totally pointless comparing drivers even in the same era who weren't teammates, and even then the driver who's superior in one car might not be in another with different characteristics. There are so many external factors and circumstances that it's really quite pointless to try and come up with any slightly objective ranking. The driver who was fastest at old Spa in the wet in a 60s deathtrap might not be the driver who is fastest at Miami in modern cars. Traction control vs no traction control. Power steering, sequential gears etc. Which combination of conditions, driver aids, tracks are you comparing across.

So yep.\xa0"", 'There\'s no ""at what point"". \n\nIt\'s foolish to compare drivers from across different regulations and eras in the first place. Only people that are clueless in F1 do that.', ""Frankly it's impossible.  It's entirely possible that Senna would dominate today but because he never had to contend with the driving load of today's cars we simply will never know.   We can't just assume that because something didn't exist the old drivers are incapable of mastering it.   It's simply unknowable."", 'Nicely put, but on the flip, are todays drivers as good as the previous drivers due to the technological advantages.

Take just the idea of power steering  or steer by wire.  Used to be a mechanical linkage.\n\nThe arguments work both ways.  The truly great drivers would adapt to current times.

 Origins & Formation (2019–2020)

In mid-2019, whispers began circulating that Kaspar Molinski, Ferrari’s former technical mastermind behind their dominant 2000–2004 era, was plotting a return to F1. He was spotted in discussions with Ruben Cervantes—a millionaire tech entrepreneur, as well as a former Renault F1 driver in the 1990’s.
By late 2020, the rumors crystalized into reality as financial software giant Expensify announced a surprise multi-year title sponsorship for an 11th F1 team. The newly christened Expensify APXGP would be headquartered at a refurbished section of the former McLaren campus in Silverstone.

The team secured a Mercedes power unit deal, becoming the fifth team to run Mercedes-AMG HPP engines in 2021.

⸻

Key Personnel:
	•	Team Principal: Kaspar Molinski
	•	Technical Director: Kate McKenna (Cambridge-educated in aerospace/aerothermal engineering)

2021 Season

	Chassis: APX01
	Drivers:
	•	Kevin Magnussen (returning shock inclusion)
	•	Dan Ticktum (controversial F2 graduate, ex-Williams academy)

Season Summary:

To fast-track development, the team utilized components from the 2020 Racing Point and Williams FW43, coupled with technical support from Mercedes. The APX01 was reliable but underdeveloped, with weak aero balance and minimal downforce.
	•	Best Result: P14 (Magnussen, Baku)
	•	Notable Moments: Grid penalty at Austria GP for unhomologated front wing
	•	Final Standing: 11th in Constructors’ Championship, 0 points
	•	Driver Swap: Ticktum dropped for behavioral issues, replaced by Callum Ilott for final 4 races.

⸻

 2022 Season

    Chassis: APX02
     Drivers:
	•	Callum Ilott (retained)
	•	Logan Sargeant (rookie; replaced Magnussen who returned to Haas)
