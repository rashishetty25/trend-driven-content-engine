1kelew7,[AMuS] McLaren calls on Red Bull to protest,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kelew7/amus_mclaren_calls_on_red_bull_to_protest/,2025-05-04, News,,"['Translation:\n\n\n> **Red Bull can\'t get to the bottom of McLaren\'s secret. Now a Netflix scene featuring team boss Christian Horner is further escalating the dispute between the title contenders.**\n\n> The Miami sprint has further heightened Red Bull\'s concerns that McLaren holds a potentially decisive championship-deciding trump card. The one-two finish by Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri and the simultaneous zero lap by Max Verstappen are one thing. But what happened in the first ten laps is much more worrying.\n\n> Verstappen was still able to keep a reasonable distance from the two McLaren drivers until lap six. Then, as if by magic, the two Papaya racing cars disappeared over the horizon. This happened precisely at the moment the track began to dry out and the intermediate tires became increasingly hot.\n\n> Who had the best control over tire temperatures? McLaren, of course. And that makes the mystery surrounding the MCL39 even greater. Red Bull has been trying to get to the bottom of the mystery since the start of the season, bombarding the FIA \u200b\u200bwith questions about what is and isn\'t allowed. This is a desperate attempt to draw conclusions from the association\'s answers.\n\n> **Netflix scene causes trouble.**\nBased on thermal imaging camera images, Red Bull has virtually black on white that the McLaren\'s brake linings stay cooler on the outside than on any other car. And that naturally affects tire temperatures. McLaren clearly has absolute control over this. And that could be the match winner, both for a single lap and for the entire race. Because the tires don\'t overheat and therefore don\'t lose grip.\n\n> Red Bull is convinced that it\'s impossible to cool its tires with air alone. Last year, suspicions arose that McLaren was filling its tires with small amounts of water. And this is precisely what\'s now causing McLaren CEO Zak Brown\'s displeasure.\n\n> The American was annoyed by a scene in a Netflix documentary series in which his Red Bull colleague Christian Horner mentioned in a conversation that they had evidence of water in the McLaren\'s tires. Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\n> **Protest fee must hurt.**\nThe McLaren boss is now calling on Red Bull to file an official protest. If, as claimed, they have evidence, it must be brought to light. So that the matter is settled once and for all. Brown suggests that the FIA \u200b\u200bshould set a precedent. ""The protest fee should be high enough that a team will carefully consider whether to actually file an appeal.""\n\n> Depending on the severity of the allegation, the fee should be between ¬£25,000 and ¬£50,000, and this amount should be part of the capped budget. The plaintiff then thinks twice about whether to denounce another team without sufficient evidence or develop a new front wing with the money. Brown considers the allegation untenable from a technical perspective: ""Water in the tires would mean additional weight, and tire pressures would skyrocket during warm-up.""\n\n> The FIA \u200b\u200balso considers the activism against McLaren to be excessive. Since the first rumors of the water theory circulated at the 2024 Brazilian GP, \u200b\u200bFIA technicians have double- and triple-checked the McLaren in the areas in question. There have never been any complaints. Of course, the brake linings and what\'s hidden inside are also in focus.\n\n> The regulations set clear limits on the exterior design. Under the hood, there\'s freedom with the airflow and materials. Cooling elements or heat exchangers in the wheel carrier area are prohibited. In the gallery, we show you the different solutions on the cars of the top teams.\n\n> Apparently, McLaren has somehow managed to separate the air so that the brakes (hot) and tires (cold) remain within the desired temperature range. The fact that McLaren is doing something different from the competition is also evident in the behavior of the mechanics. During certain work on the car, they form a wall in front of the car, thus forming a screen against curious photographers.', 'There is something insane with the Mclaren once the track is drying, same last year and they suddenly just pull a 20s gap after being on the same pace as other cars prior, both cases, Australia this year, it got negated by a safety car.', '> Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\nIts cool to see a traditional team like McLaren back on top in F1 but holy fucking shit the team would be so much easier to root for if Brown would talk less. I want Horner vs Toto back that was way more fun.', '>Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\nDidn\'t McLaren spend years protesting RBR and Merc? Protesting and shit throwing is nothing new in F1, Brown should know that better than anyone.\n\n>\n\n>\xa0""The protest fee should be high enough that a team will carefully consider whether to actually file an appeal.""\n\nAnd this is so backwards thinking, McLaren should be investigated just for saying this. That will just allow teams to cheat, and others would be too scared to protest. His orange friend from the visit last year holds the same beliefs.', ""I don't get why teams take it so personally when other teams think they might be doing something. \n\nAt the end of the day every team has a right to question other teams and maybe protest if they want. \n\nIf you've nothing to hide then who cares about a protest"", 'If its not true, why care so much to respond almost angry like this and wanting to raise prices of protests? Why wanting to create a situation where smaller teams can not afford to protest while hoping bigger teams get pushed off from doing it to save money? \n\nAt the same time, if you have nothing to hide, why get angry? Just let them try and waste their time and effort right? It kinda creates the idea you have something to hide. \n\nThey did find something, that is clear. Could be they are nervous that a protest could expose the legal thing they found for everyone to copy?', 'I‚Äôm not going to lie, I want to see what a full on fight between Zak and Horny would look like across a full season lmao \n\nI liked the Toto v Horner, but we can‚Äôt wait forever for Merc to finally catch up and actually challenge CONSISTENTLY (I said this for the people that are going to come and talk about good results) for championships and wins, so this is the best alternative', 'Interesting topic, but I have a gut feeling moisture inside the tyres isn‚Äôt the trick making McLaren that much easier on the tyres.\n\nIf it was, the FIA would‚Äôve caught it by now, with the extra inspections done late last year and perhaps also this year.\n\nI do think the idea McLaren is much better at cooling the brakes or brake lining has merit, but they might be able to do it differently than what‚Äôs assumed (by Red Bull).\n\nI don‚Äôt know if its possible to use the brake fluid itself as an ‚Äòaccidental‚Äô coolant or heat absorbant.

You can't force them off, but you have the line, so don't need to leave space.\n\nThe-Race video also shows the changes for this year when overtaking on the outside, and it was implemented on the Lawson penalty. last season, I don't think Lawson would have got a penalty.\n\nTo be entitled to be given room when overtaking on the OUTSIDE, the overtaking car must:\n\n*i) Have its front axle AHEAD OF THE FRONT AXEL of the other car AT THE APEX*\n\n*ii) Be driven in a controlled manner from entry, to apex, and to exit.*\n\n*iii) Be able to make the corner within track limits.*\n\nThese changes, combined with the dirty air increases this season, are likely really bad for racing, but this is what the drivers want and the FIA has listened.\n\nImportant to note that Verstappen was penalised for leaving the track and gaining an advantage, which is also covered in the video.

In both cases comfortably. \n\nIn one case Max went off and gained an advantage by not giving back the position he'd lost: Penelty\n\nIn kimis case he went off and ended up worse for it. No advantage gained:  No penalty.\n\nOutside line: same but you need to be much further alongside. Which is fair because outside passes are next to impossible, clean, with sinilar cars.\n\nThe ruling on how far alongside in both cases varies depending on the current guideline.\n\nIMO they are about right at the moment.

1kenwnb,[AMuS] The great Pirelli puzzle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kenwnb/amus_the_great_pirelli_puzzle/,2025-05-04, News,,"['Translation:\n\n\n> **Max Verstappen beats both McLarens. Andrea Kimi Antonelli misses pole position by 67 thousandths of a second, leaving teammate George Russell in the dust. Ferrari is nowhere to be seen. Even experts struggled to explain the qualifying result in Miami.**\n\n> McLaren is dreading a fast qualifying lap. The slightest mistake is enough to lose pole position. For the third time after Suzuka and Jeddah, Max Verstappen is taking advantage of this. In the first two cases, it could have been attributed to the track layout. Suzuka and Jeddah feature mainly fast, flowing corners.\n\n> The Miami Autodrome is different. Only the first sector is Red Bull territory. The rest is almost exclusively made up of tight corners that require a lot of maneuvering. Not exactly Red Bull\'s specialty. Until Q2, things were fine. Verstappen pulled away from everyone in the first sector. The McLarens made up the deficit in the other two sections.\n\n> Only in Q3 was everything different. For the first time, Verstappen lost less time in the second half of the track than he gained at the beginning of the lap. There were three reasons for this. Verstappen managed a nearly perfect lap, apart from a small wobble in Turn 1. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri made too many mistakes.\n\n> **Unusual result.**\nFinal fine-tuning of Red Bull\'s setup minimized the damage in the slow corners. But the most important factor was the track temperature, which had dropped from 44 to 38 degrees Celsius by the end of the session. McLaren couldn\'t exploit its strength of keeping the tires in the window throughout the entire lap as much as it had in Q2. The opposition suffered less, however.\n\n> With the minimal gaps in the field, the condition of the tires determines the lap time. Small things have a big impact. If the tire is too cold or too hot, it provokes mistakes. Verstappen, Piastri, and Antonelli in the first corner. Russell, Norris, and Hamilton in the hairpin at the end of the straight. When, like Andrea Kimi Antonelli, they\'re only 0.067 seconds behind the fastest time, it\'s doubly frustrating. ""I was too greedy in the first corner.""\n\n> At least it was enough for the rookie to once again win the team battle at Mercedes. George Russell only started from P5: ""Qualifying has actually been my strength this season. But whatever has worked so well so far isn\'t working here in Miami. Kimi did a great job. He drives a little differently than I do. This obviously puts the tires in a better window. I didn\'t find confidence. It went from one extreme to the other. It was the worst qualifying of the year. In the end, fifth place ‚Äì it could have been even worse.""\n\n> **Are used tires faster than fresh ones?**\nSometimes things get really complicated, as in the case of Ferrari. ""We were faster on used tires than on new ones,"" puzzled team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur. Lewis Hamilton saw things somewhat differently. He would have liked to have had two new Pirellis in the Q2 session instead of just on the second run. ""If we\'re already having trouble getting into Q3, it would probably be better to try it twice with fresh tires. We\'ll have to discuss that again.""\n\n> Charles Leclerc couldn\'t pull himself out of the fire in eighth place either: ""Something was strange today. We need to analyze it. I was completely outside the window of the car. From Q1 to Q3, we had to make a lot of changes. That\'s unusual. But it never felt good. It hurts when you\'re doing your best and your best in a Ferrari is only P8.""\n\n> The Monegasque lost four of the seven tenths to the opposition in the first corner alone. The Monegasque set the fastest time in the final sector. This isn\'t the first time Ferrari has struggled with this problem. ""We also gave away three tenths in the first corner in Jeddah,"" Vasseur reveals.\n\n> This clearly indicates that the tires are heating up too slowly. In qualifying, this is a killer. In the race, it can be a wildcard because it reduces tire wear over the distance. Then a Ferrari is almost as good as a McLaren. The difference is that the Papaya races can do both: fire up the tires quickly and keep them alive over the distance.', 'Why don‚Äôt they have a tire that‚Äôs somewhere between the intermediate and wet, or even a hard/soft intermediate. I feel the full wet is worthless, unless it‚Äôs quasi-undriveable conditions.', 'What was Lewis talking about two set of new tyres for Q2 for him to get through? He took two new sets in Q1, and you need to keep one set of new soft for Q3 or if you don‚Äôt get to Q3 it will be for the race, so he only has one new set for Q2. He doesn‚Äôt have two new sets for Q2. Or he is implying the team should only use 1 set of new in Q1 but it risks him not getting through Q1‚Ä¶', ""The inter is just an incredible tyre. There's no need for a tyre in-between the wet and inter because the inter can cope with a wide variety of conditions already. \n\nThe wet is just super slow. The inter is multiple seconds a lap faster."", 'They should have only 1 wet weather tyre. WEC for example only has a ""full wet"" equivalent and it works perfectly fine.\n\nSave money, avoid wastes, make it really hard to simply race a wet tyre into a dry track so that strategy and driver\'s abilities are even more important.', 'BRING BACK THE GROOVES!\n\nBut only as a special inter-intermediate compound!', ""I think he meant that if you're unsure if you're going through to q3, it's better to use two new sets in q2 to make it through, instead of saving one set but then not making it through. If you need to, you can do q3 on the used sets"", 'Exactly, the irony us that Pirelli designed a very great tyre with the inters meanwhile the full wets having such a narrow window between too dry to use and too wet to race for the cars that it only works on a flat track and when the race has been started.', ""Yeah.

From the team's point of view, the penalty was inevitable and that exact penalty was expected. Now obviously it is/was in Red Bull's interest to get the penalty sooner so that they could serve it sooner (say if the SC at the end doesn't happen). However that applies to every team in any situation involving penalties. Also, from a racing point of view, getting penalties sorted out sooner rather than later is generally considered to be a good thing. This particular thing resulted in a penalty being announced when they were finishing under a SC but the fact that nothing could be done about it makes it pretty much equivalent to a post-race penalty or a penalty handed out in the final few racing laps.
