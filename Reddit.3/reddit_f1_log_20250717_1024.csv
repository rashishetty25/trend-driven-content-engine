1m1hrtk,Why McLaren wants Piastri to try suspension he's rejected so far,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m1hrtk/why_mclaren_wants_piastri_to_try_suspension_hes/,2025-07-16, News,,"['""The McLaren Formula 1 team is evaluating whether or not Oscar Piastri should start using some of the new suspension components that Lando Norris has adopted.""\n\nTL;DR: Oscar doesn\'t seem interested (he wants to keep the car consistent). It\'s causing McLaren to bring more parts because of the two specifications. Stella says ""it may stay this way through the end of the season."" Lando credits his recent form to hard work off-track.\n\nMy takeaway: It may be annoying to bring more parts to the track but McLaren will keep doing it so that they aren\'t favouring one driver over the other (while hoping Oscar will decide to take the new suspension and save them some aggravation).\n\nI suspect that if Macca weren\'t so committed to ""two #1 drivers"" that there would only be one suspension package.

And remember the people who wrote this want you to over react based on which side you support ...don\'t feed the hate.', 'There’s a few threads here missing the basic difference in their suspension and assuming all upgrades are performance-driven. Oscar is on the original suspension with the extreme anti-dive, ie the front doesn’t drop under braking at all, providing better (more consistent) low-medium speed downforce. Lando’s suspension geometry is less extreme, with the Instant Center (where the upper/lower arm lines meet) somewhat above the Center of Gravity.\n\nStella thinks it’s a pain having separate setups, requiring more spares etc, and he knows that Oscar will be quick on Lando’s setup. Oscar will also know this but won’t want to cede any advantage his setup has - or allow the team to develop towards his rival’s preferences.
