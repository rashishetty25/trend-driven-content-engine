For me there are two I'd bring in immediately.

1. IndyCar's offset timing line in qualifying. Without the need for full in/out laps, teams would be able to get more laps in during quali at tracks like Spa, and at tracks like Monza where traffic is an issue, there could potentially be fewer cars on track.

2. MotoGP's Long Lap penalty. Take Max's penalty at Jeddah for example. If rather than waiting until his stop to serve a 5 second penalty, why not make him take a long lap within 3 laps? It would have likely put him back behind Piastri and maybe we'd have seen a fight for the lead? It would also be fairer on drivers who get a 5 second penalty after their last stop only for the race to end behind the safety car.

What other rules are out there that you'd like to see in F1?","[""Lap time deletion for causing yellow/red flags in qualifying.\n\nLLPs are good on paper but MotoGP's had a bit of controversy because it's a FAR bigger penalty on some tracks than others, and it's harder to implement on four wheels. I think having a position drop penalty like IndyCar has would be better."", '1) Throw out the apex rule. If the front axle of car 1 is at least at the point of the rear axle of car 2 then car 1 must be given at least a cars width of space.\n\n2) If a driver over takes illegally,  race control tells them to give the place back in x-laps or be given a drive through.

Like last weekend, Verstappen could have just skipped the whole braking what so ever, and took a long lap with and stayed first. \n\nPlus, the current rule, just give back the advantage or place and you’re off the hook works well.

Is he out of his prime? Yes, simply because prime Alonso is one of the greatest drivers of all time and he makes a few more mistakes now than he used to. However I keep seeing people omitting him from what they consider the top 5 or 7 on the grid. 

What I don't understand is his gap to Stroll has  remained the same throughout his years together with him and 2023 he was generally considered 2nd or 3rd best that year. If you look at his pace gaps, he has actually got even bigger gaps to Stroll now than he did for large parts of 2023. I just don't understand why people think that now he is in the 2nd slowest car, he is suddenly washed. The 2 races Stroll genuinely had more pace than him in 24? Stroll getting 10 points and Alonso 0 because of 2 DNFs this year? (one was a a crash yes but he was well ahead of Stroll on pace regardless) 

Some of this is probably projecting the problems of other drivers like Hamilton (although I don't think Hamilton is washed per se, moreso his driving style doesn't suit these regulations as well) but his race head to head is absolutely dominant and drivers like Max still praise his driving and he has been the leading Aston driver for every one of his racing laps this year. 

","['Because the unsatisfying truth is we really don\'t have a good way of telling if one driver is ""better"" and even then, there are multiple areas of driver skill (inside the race AND outside the race) that different teams will weigh differently such that its frankly impossible to quantify outside of talents that are so obviously better than their peers it becomes undeniable.', 'Alonso is in the bad situation of being against Stroll.\n\nBeat Stroll? Nobody cares, regardless of the gap, it’s Stroll anyway\n\nGet matched by Stroll? It’s the end of his career(despite Lance always having his random ass good weekends every year)\n\nPeople cant comprehend that on his day Lance Stroll can be quite quick.

As it is, it\'s impossible to judge drivers, and car, apart from maybe teammates. And even then it might be just that car suits one teammate better, other one might be better if they raced in a different car.\n\nHowever, one thing we can say is that there were no ""lucky"" world champions, at least not recently. Whoever managed to be #1 is a great driver and has earned it. Alonso and Hamilton might not be in their prime, but their skill is not really disputable. They have both earned their reputation. If Lawson bins car everybody will be ""he\'s a bad driver"", but if Hamilton or Alonso do it, ""must have been a bad car"".\n\nBut comparing drivers is a folly, who are we to say ""Albon is better than Hulkenberg."" (or vice versa). It\'s just impossible. We have no data to compare them with.', 'Because the car is key.', ""Why don't people dunk on Nico like they do to Stroll?"", 'Very few people think he’s washed, more so people are picking fun at Alonso because he’d being beaten by stroll, just to be funny, I doubt people think Stroll is genuinely better or Alonso is washed, similar to Stroll vs Vettel', ""As someone who follows Aston Martin closely, Alonso is definitely much worse now than he was in 2023.\n\nIt's no shame in admitting that Alonso is nowhere near as good as he once was- the same can be said for Hamilton.

Their FP1 and FP2 race pace simulations looked incredibly strong — often outpacing rivals by 3 to 6 tenths over race distance runs. On paper, that should translate to dominance... but when it comes to actual Qualifying and Race Day performance, the story seems different.

We’ve seen in the past how Max and Lewis used to win races with 20+ second margins. With the hype surrounding McLaren this season, I expected something similar. But that hasn’t really been the case. In fact, it feels like the opposite.

Yes, their car struggles in dirty air — we’ve all noticed how poor it is at following other cars. But even in clean air during Quali (FP3, Q2, Q3), their single-lap pace hasn’t looked unbeatable. George Russell, for example, is often right there with them in terms of one-lap performance.

So, is McLaren truly dominant this season, or are we just caught up in the hype? They might be the fastest team overall, but they don’t seem to have the kind of crushing dominance we saw from Red Bull or Mercedes in their prime.

Is it fair to think this way, or am I just expecting too much?","['The sport went from having the Mercedes-Hamilton combination to the Red Bull-Verstappen combination.

If you are not a generational talent then most of your achievements are down to the car per some people online. The question is how much do you care about a random person\'s opinion.

I fully discount practice as a datapoint because Red Bull has clearly run lower engine modes since 21 at least and recently also tries experimental setups before (more often than not) getting it all together by Qualifying.

That isn't a guaranteed edge every weekend which is why you see can Red Bull nail their narrow setup window and be on the pace or a close battle at a low deg track like Suzuka or Jeddah that negates the McLaren's tire advantage.

Now that makes me wonder, how would Sainz handle the SF-25? The car's balance seems to be pretty similar to the early-form F1-75, a car that Sainz had difficulties extracting performance from.

The pace isn’t there but he’s very comfortable in the set up and driving it and has found a way to extract everything out of it.\n\nEvery-time Charles is comfortable in the car, the gap between him and Carlos grew. Considering Charles usually can comfortably out-qualify Carlos in Bahrain and Saudi, my guess is the qualifying gap in Bahrain would’ve been around two tenths but bigger again in Saudi     \n\nAnd then I think Charles would have the clear advantage in race pace, I think that’s where he actually had more of an advantage over Carlos.\n\nOn tracks Charles likes, when he’s comfortable with the car and not making small mistakes in qualifying, it’s very unlikely Carlos would be a real threat to him. Yeah he might be doing a bit better than Lewis but I still don’t think Ferrari have any reason to regret their decision.\n\nTheir fastest driver is still their fastest driver so they haven’t lost any footing in the drivers championship.

No, not developing the car in Lewis’s direction but input from drivers is necessary to make it faster. \n\nCharles and Carlos were incredibly competitive which meant they learned a lot from each other, and to have new teammates means they now have different drivers to learn different strengths, like tracks that neither Charles or Carlos were particularly strong at.', ""On average in qualifying Hamilton is actually slightly closer to Leclerc than Sainz was beginning of 2021 when he joined Ferrari.
