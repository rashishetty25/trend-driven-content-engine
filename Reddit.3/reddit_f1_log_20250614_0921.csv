‚ÄúWhen we throw names out there or invent recruitments that never existed or say that Charles is going to leave for Mercedes next year, I think the only reason is either journalists who hope to make a click and who hope to exist with that or to disrupt the team, or maybe both.

We changed the team principal, we changed the drivers, we changed almost everything except one thing. My position is fragile by definition. It's like a football coach. We know that when you do this job at Ferrari or elsewhere, you are exposed. I think there are three team principals who change per season so I didn't come here thinking I'm doing this for life.
