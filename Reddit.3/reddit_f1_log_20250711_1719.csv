No two corners are ever taken exactly the same. The track conditions change, the air temp changes, the tires change, the car changes, it's a constantly variable and dynamic situation. The very, very best drivers are able to maximize what they have every single corner every single time. This extends to their racing. Lots of guys can run the race line at 99.9% but when there's a car beside them they can't maximize. The very best can.\n\nBut one thing to understand is that the margins are RAZOR thin.
