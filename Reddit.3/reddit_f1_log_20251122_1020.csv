First time getting to experience F1 in person, and what an overwhelming first day it’s been! 

I’d love to hear all your first time experiences seeing F1 up close. Did you expect it to be so loud, the smell of rubber and exhaust to be so strong, and get that electrifying feeling when that rush of air comes towards you and growling engine to whiz past you? 

I never thought I’d be lucky enough to see some top tier engineering and skill up close like that, and I hope more people get to access things like this in life. Remember to say “yes” when experiences come knocking at your door, whether big or small 😄 

Thanks all ","['I hate that the broadcasts completely neuter the sense of speed in favor of sponsor closeups.

Greatest day of my life at that point.', 'I was in Austria a few years back (the year Sainz\'s engine decide to blow up and catch fire). The first day me and my dad tried to get as near to the track as possible, but we saw basically nothign but a second of the cars, kind of like in your video clip.\n\nDuring raceday we took a more ""off-aproach"", a bit back, about 1/3 down of the straight after corner 3. It was the most surreal experience I\'ve ever had, seeing cars far away in corner 1, seeing the cars race past after corner 3, and also having full view of corner 6-7. It was amazing.\n\nWhat I remember best was looking at Sainz\'s car as he raced past, and seeing that initial ""poof"" from the engine. I immediately recognised that the engine had failed. Yet it took pretty much everyone else around me 5-10 seconds more to realise it, until they saw it on the big screen. At that point it felt truly special to have been there at the track, knowing it before everyone around me, and knowing it probably four times that before everyone on television and in the more expensive stands knew it.', 'Wow!', 'My first time was the USGP at Indy in 2004.  I’ll never forget that sound.

The way those cars changed direction, accelerated, slowed, then zipped away again was incredible.  The only time I’ve seen something accelerate faster was Top Fuel and Funny Cars in NHRA.\n\nI was able to see them the next two years, including the infamous 2005 race with only 6 cars making the start.  I work in the automotive repair industry and have been lucky to get access that most don’t.

V12's have more cylinders, but V10's go higher in rpm's. They all have different characteristics in how they sound. 

Plus, just an additional question: which is louder, the big 3.5 liter 15,000 rpm V12 or Ferrari's 3 liter 17,000 rpm V12, that is the last V12 in F1 ever and is still the highest revving V12 ever made?","['Found this on YouTube. \n\nMy opinion is that they’re roughly the same but the v10 hits a note higher than the v12 which pierces the ears.', 'I’d say the V12 definitely has a more hammering sound in which you can almost hear every single piston rev, with the straight cut gears of that era coming into play to create a very metallic and almost “gruesome” tone if it makes sense.\n\nThe V10 creates a much smoother high-pitched scream in which everything nicely blends together to create a well coordinated orchestra that almost resembles a jet engine rather than a combustion powered car.\n\nIt might be completely subjective, but the V12 **screams** a lot louder and forces you to cover your ears no matter what.

There's an Excel and Numbers version. I've never used Limewire so I hope it works.

At the bottom, you can **toggle the results** of Max's, Lando's, and Oscar's final races to check all the permutations of finishes to see who becomes WC.

I hardcoded a few (unlikely) scenarios where:

* Max finishes P1 in all the remaining GPs and the Sprint, Oscar finishes all P2, and Lando finishes all P3. That one doesn't change the current standings.
* Max finishes P2 in all the remaining GPs and the Sprint. Oscar and Lando score 0 points. Max wins by 12 points.
* Max finishes P3 in all the remaining GPs and the Sprint. Oscar and Lando score 0 points. Max wins by 2 points.
* Max finishes P2 in one GP and P1 in the remaining races. Lando finishes in P2/P3/P7/P6. Lando still wins.
