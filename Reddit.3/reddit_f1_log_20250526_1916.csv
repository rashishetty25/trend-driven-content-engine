This initiative marks a significant step in the brand\'s ambitious expansion into Formula 1, aiming to field a team in the 2026 season.\n\nA Bold New Direction for Cadillac\n\nCadillac\'s entry into Formula 1 has been a topic of intense speculation and excitement. Officially approved by the FIA in March 2025, the team is set to become the 11th on the F1 grid, joining the ranks of global automotive giants. With a base in Indiana and a technical center in Silverstone, UK, Cadillac is committed to building a ""truly American"" team, with a focus on innovation, engineering excellence, and, notably, American talent. \n\nTo identify potential drivers, Cadillac has turned to the heart of American motorsport: the Indianapolis 500. This iconic race not only attracts the best drivers but also a passionate fanbase, many of whom have aspirations of racing at the highest levels. By engaging with visitors at the Indy 500, Cadillac aims to discover raw talent and untapped potential among the next generation of drivers.\n\nScouting the Speedway\n\nDuring the 109th Indianapolis 500, Cadillac set up interactive booths and hosted talent identification events, inviting fans to showcase their driving skills and racing knowledge. The initiative was designed to be inclusive, offering opportunities for individuals from various backgrounds to participate. Attendees were encouraged to demonstrate their passion for racing, with the hope that some might possess the skills and determination required for a future in Formula 1.\n\n""We\'re looking for individuals who have the drive, both literally and figuratively,"" said Graeme Lowdon, team principal of Cadillac F1. ""The Indy 500 is a celebration of speed and skill, and we believe there are hidden gems among its spectators who could thrive in the world of Formula 1.""\n\nThe Road to Formula 1\n\nWhile the search at the Indy 500 is a novel approach, Cadillac\'s commitment to American drivers is longstanding. IndyCar star Colton Herta has been prominently featured in discussions about potential F1 drivers. Having secured a seat with Andretti Autosport for the 2025 IndyCar season, Herta is on track to meet the FIA\'s superlicence requirements, making him a strong candidate for a seat in the 2026 season.\n\nHowever, Cadillac is not solely focused on established names. The initiative at the Indy 500 underscores the team\'s dedication to discovering new talent. By engaging directly with fans and visitors, Cadillac hopes to identify individuals who may not have had the opportunity to compete at the professional level but possess the innate skills and passion for racing.\n\nA Vision for the Future\n\nCadillac\'s strategy reflects a broader trend in motorsport, where teams are increasingly looking beyond traditional scouting methods to find talent. By tapping into the enthusiasm and passion of racing fans, Cadillac is fostering a more inclusive and diverse pathway into Formula 1.\n\nAs the 2025 Indy 500 concludes, the excitement surrounding Cadillac\'s driver search is palpable. For many fans, the dream of racing at the highest level is no longer confined to the realm of fantasy.

The top 8 then enter a knockout style qualifying tournament: 1st from Q2 against 8th, 2nd v 7th etc. One lap each, winner progresses to semi final. We‘ll have semi finals, a final and 3rd place playoff to determine the top 4 and equally with the losers from the quarter finals we‘ll have that for P5-8.

1kvtxkz,How do you decide YOUR best driver?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvtxkz/how_do_you_decide_your_best_driver/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"I know, discussions about who is best and who didnt deserve it are old and kind of boring, but no inner discussion keeps me thinking so long and having so different views and I am just talking about the things happening in my own head. 

The ""typical"" greats are often drivers from different areas so it is really hard to compare them equally and not only did the quality of cars in general improved massively but also technical differences like stick-shift to automatic, engines etc. 

Without mentioning any names, what are the attributes a driver needs to have to be your number one or top 5 etc.? 

  
For me it is the circumstances a driver gets and what he makes out of it. There are drivers who have multiple championships with multiple cars and there are drivers who sit in one nearly perfect car and win, but mostly very close of their teammate. 

And currently my view on another driver shifts, because I thought he has the best car, but it seems that either he is an unbelievable driver or no one can use the car, but him. ","['Mostly vibes, and when someone comes with good arguments for another driver, I use my emotional arguments to justify my personal bests.', 'I don’t. Everyone can tell the group of drivers that are clearly a level above, and most people can create a group that are a level below that. At that point the main difference at any one time is the respective quality of their cars, so I just pick the one I like the most', ""For me, outside of the more obvious qualifyers such as pace, racecraft and adaptabiliy, it's a combination of\n\n* occasional exceptional, perhaps against the odds, performances (so not just the one time)\n* record breaking success\n* not just performing at a high level, but doing it consistenly over a considerable period of time (at least a couple of years/seasons)\n* wet weather skills\n* showings of things that are arguably unmatched (e.g. no/very few other drivers have shown such feats before/can pull it off)\n\nI think most drivers considerd to be the best/greatest will tick all these boxes."", 'Consistency, speed, out matching your teammate(s). And one that I think separates the good from the greats is being able, and having time, to read the race while driving the car.', 'First race I ever watched was Imola 2021. That day I picked Max because he was the young gun looking to take down the titan in Lewis. Also Lando was on the podium and had a sick race so I also took to liking him.

In 2021 and 2024 he won against stronger cars and in 2025 again he's showing just how good he is when he's in a clearly inferior car to the competition. This is one of my biggest criticisms with someone like Hamilton where he looks good in the fastest car and then when it comes time for the driver to make the difference when the car isn't there he doesn't do it."", 'Who gets the most out of the package they have been given.

1kvh5qj,Monaco and Minimum Lap Times - Would it Work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvh5qj/monaco_and_minimum_lap_times_would_it_work/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"I think the mandatory two-stop rule could have worked to some degree in Monaco, if it wasn't for teams/drivers, backing up the grid to create advantageous pit stop gaps.

It wasn't interesting to watch and somehow made Monaco even more boring to watch.

But what if drivers had to keep to a minimum lap time throughout each lap? Governed by some metric, which I'm sure wouldn't be too difficult to work out and enforce (drivers would have a delta to follow), which would eradicate this backing up nonsense. Monaco isn't going anywhere. It's too steeped in history and has far too much significance with Formula 1, so I do think it's a good idea to mandate some interesting rules to help improve the racing, even though on-track overtaking is at a minimum/non-existent.

Would there be a reason this couldn't realistically work?

Maybe eliminating the chicane and letting them use drs through the tunnel down to a more 90 degree tabac. But that would take a major road project to alter the streets.

1kvon1d,Is Antonelli performing beneath expectations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvon1d/is_antonelli_performing_beneath_expectations/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"This post might bring controversy, but I think young Kimi is performing slightly worse than expected, further overshadowed by all the praise about Hadjar recently. So far he has less than half the points of GR, 0-10 vs GR in race/sprint h2h, and 2-8 in qualifying h2h.

GR is great, and honestly I don’t think race pace, mistakes, (like losing the lead at the sprint) or even crashes are worrying, but it’s the raw pace that he has yet to show. In my understanding, speed is mostly not taught, and most great drivers become competitive in qualifying just about immediately. I think it is slightly concerning that Kimi has mostly struggled with qualifying thus far other than in Miami.

Can anyone who has followed him through his junior career give some input on how we should view his performance thus far?

Edit: after reading some responses, I admit it’s my expectations of him being a generational talent that are too high and not fair.
