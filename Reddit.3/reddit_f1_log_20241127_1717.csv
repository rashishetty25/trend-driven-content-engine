It has now been officially confirmed that General Motors, under the Cadillac brand, will join as the 11th team starting in 2026. This aligns with the technical revolution year, which has already attracted Audi (having acquired Sauber). ‚ÄúThis is proof of the growth of our sport,‚Äù commented Stefano Domenicali, CEO of F1, welcoming GM.

McLaren faces its first match point this weekend in Qatar: between Saturday‚Äôs Sprint and Sunday‚Äôs GP, they must score 20 points more than Ferrari (-24) and lose no more than 8 points to Red Bull. That said, Red Bull‚Äôs chances are mostly mathematical, with a -53 deficit and Verstappen being the only driver capable of scoring points in a car that is clearly inferior to its papaya and red rivals.\n\n**F1: The Historic McLaren-Ferrari Rivalry**\n\nThe rivalry between the Woking-based McLaren team and the Maranello-based Ferrari is one of Formula 1‚Äôs most storied duels. McLaren hasn‚Äôt won a Constructors‚Äô Championship since 1998, the year Mika Hakkinen secured the Drivers‚Äô title with David Coulthard as his teammate. Ferrari‚Äôs last Constructors‚Äô title came in 2008, during Kimi Raikkonen‚Äôs era, with Felipe Massa narrowly missing out on the Drivers‚Äô Championship in the final moments of the Brazilian Grand Prix, edged out by Lewis Hamilton, who clinched his first title with McLaren.\n\nThis season, the rivalry is particularly intense as Ferrari shows more consistent improvement compared to McLaren. Both teams boast strong driver lineups: Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz for Ferrari, and Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri for McLaren. However, both teams also face internal challenges, with frustrations brewing among their theoretical leaders. Both Leclerc and Norris (particularly Norris) have been overshadowed this season by Max Verstappen, who, in celebrating what he called ‚Äúthe most challenging championship without the best car,‚Äù provocatively remarked: ‚ÄúYes, I would have won with either McLaren or Ferrari as well.‚Äù\n\n**Ferrari in Chaos**\n\nFerrari continues to struggle with managing internal rivalries, and the situation is exacerbated by Carlos Sainz‚Äôs impending departure, which gives him a sense of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù to act more independently. Adding to the tension are Charles Leclerc‚Äôs increasingly vocal (and, let‚Äôs face it, borderline hysterical) complaints over the radio, often directed at Sainz‚Äôs behavior and the team‚Äôs strategies. These public outbursts hardly contribute to a calm and constructive atmosphere‚Äîsomething essential for the final two (or three, counting Saturday‚Äôs Sprint) races in Qatar and Abu Dhabi.\n\nTo his credit, Leclerc admitted after Sunday‚Äôs race, once he had cooled down and reviewed the data (and likely after receiving a stern talk from team boss Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur), that he had overreacted. He acknowledged that the Mercedes was out of reach and that his own mistake‚Äîdestroying his tires early by pushing too hard against George Russell‚Äîwas the real culprit. In short, more signs of impatience, both behind the wheel and over the radio, which are not what it takes to become a champion.\n\nThis weakness is bound to be exploited, and next year you can bet that Lewis Hamilton will seize the opportunity‚Äîlikely from within, as Mercedes ups the pressure. One thing is certain: Ferrari‚Äôs team radio will continue to provide plenty of drama.']",0,108,0.27,0,93,93,0,6,-0.019999999999999962,0

1h0kk2y,Simple analysis - How much does Max owe 2024 WDC to RBR Dominant Start?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0kk2y/simple_analysis_how_much_does_max_owe_2024_wdc_to/,2024-11-26, Statistics,"There's been lots of statements flying around such as ""Max won WDC24 without the fastest car"".

With recency bias it feels that way, however its eye opening to look back at the beginning of the season and how dominant the RedBull was (first 7 races). So much so that we had Perez finishing 2nd / Podium. This level of dominance had no close challengers over this period. Effectively free points for RedBull + Max.

With this in mind I wondered what the championship table would look like based on two different scenarios:

1. If Mercedes were the ones to have a 7-race dominant car at the beginning of the season - For this I swapped the RedBull drivers finishing positions with the RedBull drivers for the first 7 races as follows; where Lewis finished ahead of George I would put him as the first Redbull and George as the second RedBull, and vice versa. However when populating the Mercedes cars I always put Max as the higher finisher.
2. Same as point 1 but for Ferrari.

The output:

**Scenario 1**

||
||
|Lando Norris|340|
|Charles Leclerc|319|
|Lewis Hamilton|304|
|Max Verstappen|302|
|George Russell|280|
|Oscar Piastri|268|
|Carlos Sainz|259|

**Scenario 2**

||
||
|Charles Leclerc|365|
|Max Verstappen|359|
|Lando Norris|340|
|Oscar Piastri|268|
|Carlos Sainz|267|
|George Russell|217|
|Lewis Hamilton|208|

There's no point in doing a McLaren swap for the first 7 races because this would clearly just result in a Lando P1 by a decent stretch.

So all scenarios point to the fact that - while Max didn't have the fastest car **all** season - He ultimately does owe his WDC24 to having a vastly dominant car earlier in the season.

Put another way, Max essentially had a 50pt (to Charles) and 60pt (to Norris) starting advantage heading into a 17 race season. You take that away and give the corresponding advantage to each of those drivers and they both take the WDC win.","[""Or just start counting championship from Monaco (8th race) and you can see the results, instead of your weird calculating, so since Monaco:  \n- Verstappen got 242 points.  \n- Lando got 239 points.  \n- Leclerc got 206 points.   \nSo I wouldn't call it just the car.
