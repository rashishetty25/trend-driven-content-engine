Says he could've kept Seidl if he wanted but he wasn't happy with the 2022 car, but more *the response* to it and the poor upgrade at France.\n\nFine and understandable, but slightly uncharacteristic of his at least public-facing persona which doesn't tend to name names."", ""Maybe ask why Tsunoda hasn't been promoted to Red Bull Racing, I think that's a unique topic that hasn't been covered yet\xa0"", ""I enjoyed that podcasts by the end of the 23 and 24 seasons are like: there's fuck all to talk about by this stage, we know it all."", ""I'm speculating, and I'm not saying this is definitely the case here, but often people are more willing to come out publicly with negative comments if the personal and professional relationships between two parties have broken down.\n\nIf somebody leaves for purely performance reasons, there's usually not much of a fuss. When there are negative comments and sniping it can be an indicator (but is not always an indicator) that the departure had some personal and/or political elements to it as well."", "">I heard some Brown quotes recently where he\xa0*surprisingly briskly*\xa0throws Seidl and Key under the bus.\n\nHow James Key has managed to stay in a job is a mystery that I will never be able to solve. He started with Jordan and stayed in every iteration of the team until it became Force India. In 2010 he went to Sauber, then in 2012 he went to Toro Rosso. He stayed there until 2018 when he moved to McLaren, and went back to Sauber in 2023. He's designed a string of very unsuccessful racing cars at this point."", 'DAE everyone should get points?? ü§îü§î', ""Yeah he alluded, I thought, to Stella coming in and going 'right, out with that lot, clean slate'. \n\nIt's been interesting to me that, having never met any of them, Seidl got the sack from Audi having been seen as a major coup signing."", ""Edd Straw did a good analysis of this once that over 20+ years, it has surprisingly little difference. Sometimes a team that came 9th comes 8th, but *really* in the scheme of things it's less difference than you'd expect."", ""Seidl was involved in a bit of a power struggle at Audi, right?
