The deal will bring one of the world’s biggest motor-racing brands and MotoGP — often described as the two-wheeled equivalent of Formula 1 — under a single roof.\n\n>In-depth EU probes typically add about 90 working days to deal reviews — but can drag on, for example if regulators stop the clock to demand further data. The EU’s antitrust arm usually demands remedies to solve competition concerns but sometimes also decide to give their unconditional approval if initial concerns are shown to be unfounded.\n\n>Heightened scrutiny can also lead to firms walking away from planned acquisitions. Under the terms of the deal, Liberty would have to pay Dorna €126 million if it ends up withdrawing from the takeover.\n\n>Regulators have previously raised concerns over drawing both sporting brands together. CVC Capital Partners Ltd. was forced to put MotoGP up for sale nearly two decades ago to gain antitrust approval from European regulators for its takeover of Formula 1 in 2005.\n\n>MotoGP is just the latest asset to be taken over by billionaire John Malone’s sprawling Liberty Media empire that already includes a wide range of media, communications and entertainment businesses such as concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment Inc.\n\n>Since buying F1 in 2016, Liberty Media has targeted key markets including the US, attempted to grow the sport’s popularity through digital streaming and struck gold with the show Drive to Survive."", 'I predicted this would happen lol, not the first time F1 tried to buy MotoGP.', ""Can't read.

This made me wonder: how many wins did the other champions have before their first championship winning season? The results shocked me a bit: despite Max being considered quite young and inexperienced before 2021, historically speaking he was one of the most experienced winners before starting his championship winning season. In my mind this shows how good he was in inferior machinery during the Merc domination.\n\nLastly, an important note: even if a driver only did 1 race in a season, that is still counted as a season. I can’t be arsed to judge where the limit for a partaking in a season goes, especially with all of the drivers who did like 2 races a season back in the 50’s and 60’s.\n\nNow for the fun facts:\n\nMax Verstappen is the only driver to have more than 7 victories before starting his first championship winning season who hadn't finished runners up or been in a proper championship fight.\xa0\n\nMansell's 21 wins would put him 16th on the all-time win list, tied with Kimi Räikkönen's all time wins. Meanwhile, Prost had the same amount of wins as Stirling Moss, the driver with the most race wins without a championship.\xa0\n\n14 out of 34 drivers had one or no race wins when they started their championship winning season. 20 out 34 WDC had only had either 1 or no race winning seasons before their first championship winning season. In other words, it is fairly common that new F1 champions have a rather limited experience winning races.\n\nHäkkinen and especially Button stand out as drivers with lots of overall experience, Button had 9 seasons before his WDC season, but with very limited race winning experience, only winning one race each. For Mika, it was the 97 season finale, the very race before his first WDC season, and he only won it because of the Schumacher-Villeneuve crash.\xa0\n\nKeke Rosberg is another driver who really stands out. Unlike most drivers without a victory before their first season, who generally won their debut quite early on in the season, Keke’s first victory came in round 14/16 in 1982. Even crazier, had he finished second, he still would have won the championship, and became the only driver to win the championship while never winning a Grand Prix.\xa0\n\nDespite all the talk about Norris being inexperienced in a winning position, should he win the championship next season he would be pretty average on this list. Russell would also be pretty average, while Leclerc would be on the high end. Perez would also be quite high, but if he is even on the grid next year, I’ll eat my cat’s food.

Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run. Sulayem’s approach as president has been… combative, to say the least. A lot of his decisions seem more about ego than actually serving the role. He’s alienated key stakeholders and made governance changes that look like attempts to shield himself from accountability, which hasn’t done much for his reputation—or the FIA’s, for that matter.

Honestly, his position feels shaky. The next FIA elections are still a year away, and maybe he won’t face serious opposition, but the level of discontent right now suggests bigger problems within the organization. What we’re seeing play out publicly is probably just the surface.

At the end of the day, his authority isn’t limitless. The drivers and teams are the ones who really hold the power in F1, and history shows they aren’t afraid to push back when they’re unhappy—even to the point of threatening to leave the sport entirely. Sulayem seems to be gambling a lot by antagonizing them, and I’m not sure he fully understands just how strong their influence is.

This whole power struggle seems like it will rumble on over the off season. The longer it drags on, the more damage it could do—not just to his presidency, but to F1 itself.

I’m interested to hear others thoughts on the topic. How do you see this playing out, and could the FIA find itself in real trouble if things don’t change?","[""> Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run.\n\nThat's just sorta politics though, it always looks like something has to give, but the reality is Formula 1 is only a part of the FIA, and only relevant to a few of its wealthiest member nations/constituent clubs of which there are some 250 from 147 countries. Things look to be at a breaking point, then a few things elsewhere get shuffled around in the background and suddenly everyone's happy.\n\nIs F1 important? Is it the single most important FIA activity? Yeah, probably, but as F1 fans we're still only seeing a fraction of the FIA's overall purview. If the Ugandan Karting scene doesn't have the same beef with Sulayem that Formula One does, he's not going to have much problem being reelected."", ""The teams and commercial side breaking away is a popular Reddit power fantasy. The unfortunate reality of it is that the FIA owns F1 both as a series and a brand, and Indycar's shown us that *everyone* is worse off for a split - but especially the commercial side.\n\nThis is why the teams and FOM do not hold the power some people think they do. They can threaten to break away, haggle and negotiate, sure, but a breakaway involves far too much money lost for them to ever really make good on it. The FIA technically isn't a for-profit organisation. That's why the FIA president can get away with just about everything short of murder, and MBS simply hasn't done anything stupid enough to make his position truly untenable."", 'I think a lot of folks here want to believe the FIA and MBS is the problem. The issue is likely far more complicated. A lot of the issues are more the problem with the FOM than the FIA. Paying for full time FIA stewards is something that the FIA should address with the FOM. The FIA is a non-profit, it cannot simply ""get revenue and add costs"" from nowhere. The FOM should pay for the full time stewards for F1 and that is a project that the FIA rightly addresses. \n\nThe ENTIRETY of the FIA (including all motorsports not only F1) has about 300 full time employees. Their annual budget runs into the 150-200m Euro range. The annual income after taxes is less than 10m Euro (2023). For comparison this is smaller than a single F1 team\'s annual budget.\n\nIf the FIA has to hire 3-4 full time stewards, fly time to every F1 venue, this would very likely cost them several million Euro a year. It isn\'t hard to see why the FIA needs the FOM to pony up this kind of expense.', ""A very important point is that the FIA president first and foremost serves the FIA members and not F1. F1 doesn't have much of a say, the member clubs elect the president and their leadership team. And so far it does in fact not look like Ben Sulayem is in danger of losing reelection next year. I would recommend reading this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5xbgv/jeppe_olesen_on_the_back_of_all_the_mbs/)regarding the FIA presidential elections."", ""Hasn't the FIA always been shady? I vaguely remember the whole group B debacle where the FIA was pretty much ignoring spectator and driver deaths since the sport was so popular. And then there was a whole slew of F1 controversies that people were mad about but almost every casual F1 fan has never even heard about those or has forgotten about it. I recon as long as the sport keeps growing he will be kept in the position he is in."", ""it's time we got back to ecclestone and mosley."", 'As much as MBS is unpopular to fans. Neither was Blatter or Infantino right now for FIFA. David Stern of NBA also was not popular.

Though I feel MBS is a bit different in that a lot of his unpopular moves seems to be about him specifically rather than necessarily large scale FIA decisions.', 'I’m not sure why he’s being blamed for this when they have *never* had permanent stewards and he is at least starting the conversation around fixing that, albeit with the caveat that the funds have to come from somewhere. Surely this is a reasonable starting point, rather than letting the problem endlessly fester like previous presidents did?\n\nAs for all the resignations and other changes, I still remain open minded as it’s not been very transparent, but the FIA never has been since long before he came in. And any media coverage of him always has a bit of a stink of racism that makes me take it with a pinch of salt. Part of me wonders if he’s just breaking up the old boys club that has been running things without consequence for so long.', 'He only has the please the FIA, and they are happy with him.

1hctnit,Sergio Perez brings an estimated $30-40 million USD in merchandise and sponsorships alone whilst Verstappen lost sponsorships for Red Bull in 2024. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hctnit/sergio_perez_brings_an_estimated_3040_million_usd/,2024-12-12, Statistics,"Dutch supermarket Jumbo [withdrew](https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1043062/1/verstappen-s-longtime-sponsors-explain-why-deal-ended) its financial support this year and while Verstappen still has personal sponsorhips, they're not directly tied to Red Bull. 

As for the Perez-specific Red Bull sponsors, they reportedly cover Perez's approximately $10 million annual salary and still leave $30m extra for the team and according to the Spanish sports newspaper [Marca](https://www.marca.com/en/f1/2024/11/10/673136f822601d8e4a8b4574.html), multiple new sponsors for 2025 have now signed up with Red Bull. Horner is said to have just given the green light to start production of 2025-spec team clothing and merchandise featuring the new sponsors' names, and one of them is a big, major sponsor that will join the likes of Grupo Carso (Carlos Slim's group). 

Basically, Checo is bringing enough sponsorship money to pay for half of Max's salary -- perhaps more! 

That's why Checo's group is asking around £15.7m (some sources have them at $75m USD!) to leave the team because they would definitely need to pay up all those sponsors who have already signed on for 2025. That's a lot of money just to have the privilege to put Lawson in that seat. 

Can Red Bull sustain the loss of Checo's backing? Perhaps but if they really wanted Lawson or even Ricciardo in that seat, they could've already cut Checo and their sponsors loose (incluing Disney and Ford). Something tells me it's not an easy task for Horner.

1hcaaf6,Question for older fans about Vettel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hcaaf6/question_for_older_fans_about_vettel/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"I'm a new fan this year, so I don't have a ton of context about Vettel's career or previous eras of F1.

With Verstappen's 4th WDC, there's been a lot of conversations online about how important/rare that number of (+ run of consecutive) championships are and discourse about whether or not Verstappen should be added to the list of ""GOATs"" yet. I generally think the GOAT discourse is nonsense, but it made me curious this time because: Why is Vettel not generally included when people talk about the greatest drivers?

To the best of my understanding, his stats are pretty good (like, consecutive championships are rare, he held the consecutive win record before Verstappen, 4 titles is *very* rare). Is there some context I'm missing? Is it just nostalgia bias where people are reluctant to induct a ""new"" guy into the ""good old days"" club? Are his titles less impressive than other champions' titles for some reason?

Thanks! Always looking to learn more about F1 :)","['I saw Vettel race in 2004 in Formel BMW and he was already a class of his own there. In 2008 he jumped into the limelight with his superb win in Monza and he build from there. Now specifically in 2011 and 2013 there wasn’t much competition (like Max had last year), with Vettel in the best car and his teammate just not at his level. His 2010 and 2012 titles were fantastic. His ‘GOAT status’ however got a hit in the seasons after, a bit like Lewis the last couple of years. In all, a fantastic driver, and he matured into a very likable guy the last years.', ""Getting matched by Ricciardo in 14 and then beaten by Leclerc in 19-20 really did a number on Vettel's legacy. Plus, his incapability in mounting a full challenge to Hamilton in 17-18. Add to that the perception of being a one trick pony (i.e. master of Newey's blown diffuser design) and you get the picture."", ""Other things that impacted Vettel career:\n\n2014 Vettel became a father (same year Bianchi died), and becoming a father tends to make you risk averse. \n\nJoined Ferrari which was not as stable as under the Montezemolo, Todt, Brawn years. Remember Alonso was there previously and couldn't make it work. Nobody doubts Alonso driving skills. \n\nVettel did not have a manager, and while that works in certain situations, it can backfire in others. If he had a good manager during his time at Ferrari, it would have ended differently. Someone like Briatore or Willi Weber would have never allowed Vettel to be treated the way Ferrari publicly did. Teams like Ferrari have a lot of internal politics, and a driver in this case needs a manager to navigate the politics and do the dirty work."", ""I did not go look up stats, nor did I fact check anything I'm about to say, and I haven't watched replays of his career so this is entirely my subjective perception, ripened in my mind all by itself.\n\nVettel was annoyingly good in the RB. I was really annoyed with it at least, and I think he suffered from Schumacher-backlash as well. Together these things made that people would grudgingly admit he was the best than openly admire and extoll his virtues. Vettel only really became well liked outside of Germany after his RB years. Maybe this is one way in which his legacy is subdued, the people who saw him at his best might have been emotionally invested in seeing him fail.\n\nBut he was winning so much because he had some really undeniable strengths. He was a great qualifier, great starter and generally executed brilliant first laps, in laps and out laps. Especially the latter, his ability to feel out a car that's not yet in its performance window, is a champion's skill. At the time, he also had an iron mind, always thinking and unwavering determination. I remember him being spun round in the first lap in one of the final races of the season (or possible THE final) and cheering massively because I was hoping Webber would win the championship as a result, but then seeing Vettel coasting backwards, constantly making steering adjustments to avoid further contact and gather it up on the tarmac. Mid-crash, he was already working on the recovery drive. Seeing Max vs. Norris this season has only cemented my memory of how unimpeachable Vettel was back then; no one was consistent enough to snatch it away from him even at times when RB wasn't on top, true back then and true this season.\n\nWhat Vettel could not do post-RB however, was consistently outdrive the car. Drag a shitbox into big points. And that is in my opinion the sole reason why a driver like Alonso is rated higher than Vettel, despite similarly only having undisputed supremacy in one particular car with kind of a niche setup. Vettel's Ferrari career was a spiral of overdriving, frustration and costly mistakes. Come to think of it, Vettel's Toro Rosso career (also a shitbox) was probably similar in this regard, he could be brilliant but also represented a Grosjean-level liability at times. I think a lot of it is probably psychological, he lost that sense of infallibility and became a (very well liked) human again, but this meant he could not find the last 1% and might spin out chasing it in vain.\n\nI wonder how Hamilton will do in the ferrari. He's a bit of an enigma: he definitely does not have that iron mind, but when the carrot is dangled, he does still find the 1%. He might be a Vettel or an Alonso at Ferrari. I can't wait!"", ""It didn't help that when he was at his most successful, he was also at his least likeable."", 'He was simply much more error prone than Max. He was a fantastic driver otherwise but if you’re comparing him to the GOATs it’s a pretty fatal flaw. I would recommend an F1TV subscription where you can watch the entirety of Seb’s career in full. \n\nYou’ll see critical errors like how he took himself out in Turkey 2010 trying to pass his team-mate, throwing away an easy victory in Hungary by flouting the safety car rules and his absolute mare at Spa. \n\n2017 it was a big ask to win the championship but he let Lewis off the hook massively with his start line move in Singapore, a track where Mercedes were known to be weak. He had a great year otherwise but that was a basic, unforgivable error that wiped out any title hopes he had in an instant.\n\nIn 2018 his crash in Germany was huge and it felt like he unravelled mentally after that with the pressure Lewis put on him. Ferrari made huge gains with the PU from Spa onwards but he made an error at Monza understeering into the side of Lewis on the first lap, with Lewis going onto beat Kimi to the win. Lewis then had arguably the weekend of his life in Singapore and the mistakes kept flowing from Seb through 2019, which is arguably the main reason Leclerc beat him that year.\n\nSome people will point to Danny Ric beating him in 2014 as a reason why Seb isn’t one of the best but I think that was simply a down year for Seb. In his championship years he had this hyper aggressive counter intuitive driving style that the blown diffusers really helped him hone. When the 2014 reg changes took that away, he needed the time to adapt. He went on to (at times at least) thump Raikkonen almost as convincingly as Alonso had done and that tells me Seb had all the ability in the world, I just don’t see at all that Ricciardo was fundamentally better. It’s a shame we never got to see a rematch to prove this theory.', ""There was a time when Vettel and Hamilton were about equal, success-wise, and Seb kinda flatlined from that point, while Lewis pulled away, amassing many more great wins & three more championships. \n\nI'm sorry to say that Vettel got a touch of the checos towards the end, which damaged his reputation somewhat. \n\nI don't really get the thing about 'consecutive championships'. I'd've thought non-consecutive championships would be harder and more rare (and therefore considered the greater achievement?)"", 'He was regarded as a highly talented though flawed driver back in 2009-2010. Vettel\'s first title could have been a lot easier for him had the RB6 been reliable, but his own errors in Turkey, Hungary and Belgium showed there was room for improvement.\n\nThen, in 2011, his dominant streak still featured talk of weaknesses. Canada\'s slip-up (something that can happen to anyone, really) was often characterized as him cracking under pressure. Such chatter remained, although he silenced many critics through races like Abu Dhabi and Brazil 2012.\n\nThe ""Vettel era"" is something that you only really felt at times in 2011 and in the back half of 2013. It was never as much of a constant as Hamilton\'s dominance in 2015 and 2019-2020 displayed, irrespective of the points totals and such. Max\'s era is also different to Vettel\'s, as the ultra-dominance of 2023 and his many wins either side of that season have cemented it as an unprecedented walkover.\n\nVettel never got the legend status of Senna/Prost or what Hamilton/Verstappen will end up as. The reason ultimately is found in what happened after his titles. Beaten by Ricciardo in 2014 and exiting RBR, never getting his Ferrari WDC and being dropped in 2020 at a relatively early age.', ""I think he is one of the greats in the sport, but he won't be be in the conversation for being one of the greatest of all time.\n\nThere were doubts by many whether he was the best driver on the grid when he was winning titles and many claimed that anyone would win in his car, which I thought was unfair. His loss against Ricciardo, Leclerc and his 2018 season reinforced that view and unfortunately hit his legacy hard. \n\nHowever, people underrate what he achieved in the sport and he fully deserved his multiple World championships. Below are some examples of why I think that:\n\n- Monza 2008: Winning in a midfield car on pure pace is unheard of and we rarely see that (Maldonado is the only other recent example I can think of!). Yes, he may have had the fastest car that day but he made it count as soon as the opportunity came and people forget he was in his first full season. You can see this year how it's not straight forward to win even if you have the fastest car.\n\n- 2011/2013 - He utterly dominated during these two seasons. He was the best driver in 2013 even before his car became dominant. You may say Vettel had an easy teammate in Webber, but if you look at Perez and Bottas performance in dominant cars, they weren't even able to consistently score 2nd places behind their WDC teammate let alone take several victories.\n\n- 2015 - Vettel was superb during this season and he was in contention for P2 against a hugely dominant Mercedes. People forget that when Hamilton won the title, it was Vettel who was in P2 and not Rosberg.\n\n- 2017 - This was actually a good year for Vettel despite not winning the title. Vettel and Hamilton were neck and neck all year long, and many journalists rated Vettel above Hamilton in the mid season rankings. It just came crashing down after Singapore (a racing incident), a DNF in Japan and having to start from last in Malaysia"", ""Vettel's not seen as a GOAT tier driver because he wasn't great when Ferrari had the car to challenge Mercedes in the hybrid era and then at Aston he was a shadow of his former self.\n\nHe was good in the V8 era with a good car, but he didn't show enough long term. He's like Ricciardo where he was fast when it suited him and then faded when it didn't. Drivers like Senna and Verstappen were always fast and that's why they're GOAT tier drivers.""]",17,127,0.7,17,114,114,2,7,0.010000000000000009,2

1hclu70,Somethings to know about the 2026 cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hclu70/somethings_to_know_about_the_2026_cars/,2024-12-12, Technical,"Keep in mind i'm talking about the pre-redesign car here, things may have changed.

**1: There won't be as much downforce as with the 2024 cars.**

This will likely make handling more difficult, many drivers will likely spend more time fighting the cars than fighting for position. And also a lot more MazeSpins(TM).

**2: 2026 cars will be slower and smaller compared to 2024 ones.**

With one part of ERS removed, 2026 cars will have less energy. And the design is more narrower. Combined with DRS being replaced with Override Mode, this would make 2026 cars slower when OM is not active. This was likely done to favor racing in tighter circuits like Monaco.

**3: 2026 cars are allowed less fuel flow, and this fuel likely has lower performance.**

In order to foster sustainability, fuel flow has been reduced from 100 kilos per hour, to just 70. This is a one-third reduction in fuel input. Further, fuel efficiency and autonomy will likely be reduced as biofuels tend to burn faster than fossil fuels, leading to lower MPG. Anyone who drives a flex car will know this.

**4: To compensate for lower combustion engine performance, the hybrid engine will have quadruple horsepower.**

The plan is for the 2026 electric hybrid engine to have its power increased from 160hp to 470hp, almost four times higher. As a result, output from both engines would be on par with each other, at least when OM is active.

**Further considerations:**

* With lower efficiency fuel and a hybrid engine that puts more strain on its battery, and with MGU-H being banned, it is likely that the FIA will either shorten the races, or allow mid-race refueling and recharging.
* It is likely that, to improve stability, teams will try to find ways to increase downforce without sacrificing speed. Similar to what Brawn GP once did, if i remember correctly.
* If stability cannot be improved, the likelihood of yellow and red flags will increase due to a possible rise in crashes, cars going off-track, and spin-outs.
* It is likely that the teams will make the fuel tanks and batteries as large as possible so as to not risk finishing the race with a dead battery and without the FIA-mandated fuel sample.
* All 2026 gearboxes will have 6 gears instead of 8. That's it.

Tell me what you think about this.","['""it is likely FIA will allow mid race refueling"" absolutely not lol. \n\nAlso what do you mean about your point of Brawn? Finding loopholes? Of course? All teams do that, all the time. It is part of the sport. Nothing special about the new regs though.\n\nAnd you can\'t say anything about them fighting the car more than fighting for positions. A person fighting his car will allow another to try to gain a position. It could actually improve driving battles.', 'Not sure 470 is nearly four times 160.', ""> Tell me what you think about this.\n\nA lot of speculation, not a ton of substance.\n\n> it is likely that the FIA will either shorten the races, or allow mid-race refueling and recharging\n\nNeither will happen, this is the engineering challenge that the teams must solve. This type of constraint is fundamental to formula racing and challenges like this have been solved in previous regulation sets, 2014 as an example.\n\n> It is likely that, to improve stability, teams will try to find ways to increase downforce without sacrificing speed. Similar to what Brawn GP once did, if i remember correctly\n\nThis is, and has been, a central problem in formula 1 since it became an aero-dominant series. Teams will always try to find downforce without a drag penalty. They're doing it right now. \n\n> If stability cannot be improved, the likelihood of yellow and red flags will increase due to a possible rise in crashes, cars going off-track, and spin-outs.\n\nWhat makes you think that stability will be lacking? Lower downforce does not inherently mean an unstable car. \n\n> It is likely that the teams will make the fuel tanks and batteries as large as possible so as to not risk finishing the race with a dead battery and without the FIA-mandated fuel sample\n\nAbsolutely not, they will not want the weight penalty. The single biggest performance indicator in a race car is its power:weight, so all the teams will be working overtime to make their fuel tanks and batteries will be as small as possible. If anything, the regulations will impose a minimum weight for both to try to curtail the endless pursuit of cutting weight which becomes both expensive and time-consuming."", 'Per the FIA 2026 regulations document: “The number of forward gear ratios must be 8”\xa0\n\nAll gearboxes will have 8 gears.\xa0', ""I'm not against the cars being slower tbh.

That will make everyone forget that mclaren raced half the season with a constant DRS :)"", ""Max was dirty on occasions, but they act as if a title fight wouldn't go this way. And if they expect that a driver will just bend over and let them pass just because they are fast, they don't deserve the title in the first place."", 'Not sure how that is ignore but Lando wasnt exactly clean in Austria either, multiple you yield or we crash moves from him where Max had to take avoiding action, but somehow people dont have a problem with that. \n\nAlso he was moving under braking in Austin quiet aggressively', 'Norris vs verstappen is so fake 😭, im sry but Norris never felt like a thread this year, next year is gonna be spicy tho!', ""Title should be: I know who'd be WC"", 'Yank', ""FIA-assisted cheating \n\nThat's how"", 'Very interesting interview. Going on what Zac says, it seems they know Norris bottled it to a certain extent, and that they expect Oscar to surpass him next year.', 'The wing was raced at spa, monza and baku before they were forced to change it.\n\nHalf a season is a tad bit of a stretch mate.']",0,24,0.26,0,54,54,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0
1hc3fcy,Why didn't Mercedes hire Sainz and place Kimi in Williams,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hc3fcy/why_didnt_mercedes_hire_sainz_and_place_kimi_in/,2024-12-11, Discussion,"Now that some rumours are coming out it makes a lot of sense to me. They just wanted to not lose Kimi like they did Max earlier. Placing him in Williams would have ensured that, also giving him time to grow with relatively less pressure. Plus they get a solid driver driving the Mercedes in Sainz. ","[""Because Williams don't want Mercedes juniors anymore - because they're making their own money, don't need engine discounts, and signing their own drivers (such as Sainz)..."", '1. Williams have said publicly that they do not want to be hosts for someone else’s juniors again. They take the pain of the early struggles of these young drivers, then when they get good they leave for the big team. Instead they want their own drivers and to reap the benefits.\n\n2. Toto did not want Sainz enough to pass over Kimi.', 'Sainz wanted a long term option, plus his role at Mercedes would’ve been that of Antonelli’s seat warmer.\n\nSainz would’ve needed to either destroy Russell (or Russell leaving) or Antonelli not living up to expectations to secure a long term contract. Way too many factors outside his control that could have left him without a seat for 2026.\xa0\n\nAt least in the Williams he can still stay relevant, and there is the off chance they become competitive in 2026 (or another top team offers him a drive and he breaks away from his contract)', 'Because it’s generally felt and implied williams wouldn’t be their junior team test bench anymore.', 'Because Sainz wanted a multi year contract and Mercedes wanted to sign him for just one year\xa0', ""Perhaps Williams didn't want to be a holding place for a Merc driver now that they are on a better financial footing"", 'Mercedes doesn’t have the pull at Williams like they did with Russell. They aren’t hurting for cash as much as they once were and Vowles has made it clear he wants Williams to be independent and fighting for wins, you can’t do that if you’re handing away half your garage to be a training camp for another team', ""Williams would have nothing to gain. They don't need another rookie, they need 2 experienced drivers to give solid feedback and develop the car. \n\nimo that's why Vowles focused so much on Sainz. He could have gotten Ocon or Bottas etc, good drivers, but Sainz has the reputation of giving detailed feedback and contributing on the sim on a very high level. A rookie can be fast, but they can't do that."", 'Because among other reasons, Williams is not a Mercedes junior team for them to just place their juniors in at their own whim. And James Vowles was clear that he wasn’t interested in cutting any deals to develop another team’s junior driver.', 'Sainz would also have to accept, and not a clear cut yes from him with Kimi in the wings - If I recall correctly, he had a 1+1 contract offer, but you also have to consider that he wants a secure seat and not to be a stop gap']",0,44,0.27,0,652,652,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
