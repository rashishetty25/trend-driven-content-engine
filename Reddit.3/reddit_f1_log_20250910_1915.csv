**Fernando Alonso:** I remember once South Korea in 2010. It was a red flag in the middle of the race. It was very wet, aquaplaning everywhere. We stopped on the grid and it was Mark Webber first. I was second. I came to the, um, to the grid and I spoke with him. You know, the track is really bad. You know, his aquaplaning, it will be a disaster if we restart the race now. And I knew that the race was about to restart soon. He(Webber) said that I entered in his mind that the track was worse than what actually it was. And and he crashed after the restart.

  
**Interviewer:** You wily old devil. 

**Fernando Alonso:** I was trying to use every single thing that was in my pocket. You know, in that day to to really win the race or keep the championship alive a little bit longer.","['If there was one guy who knew how to play Mark Webbers mind that is obviously his good friend Fernando.

Anyone have the link to the full video? \n\nAlonso-train for 2026 starting early!\n\nFrom an article posted an hour ago! \n\n**Formula 1 News: Newey believes his new car ‘will be the best’ – Alonso**\n\n>In comments leaked from a sponsor interview with Maaden and distributed by Spanish outlets, two-time champion Alonso described Newey – who is leading Aston’s 2026 design – as “the best designer in the history of the sport.”\n\n>“Newey makes me feel very safe,” said the 44-year-old.\n\n>“Probably no one will ever match his numbers. His way of working explains some of the results he’s achieved.\n\n>“He has an incredible way of seeing the car as a single piece that works together, not as individual devices that provide performance,” the Spaniard continued. “He’s able to anticipate the entire car as if it were a single piece. He seems to have everything under control at all times.\n\n>“He has a self-confidence I’ve probably never seen before. He’s not worried about other teams, other philosophies, or other designs. He believes his will be the best.”\n\n>Alonso said Aston Martin’s recent struggles were turned around by leadership moves such as Newey’s signing. “Arrivals like Newey have allowed us to reset our expectations and our motivation,” he said.\n\n>“If you don’t see any change when the situation isn’t good, then it becomes a problem. Then you lose confidence. But I think what I’ve found at Aston Martin is a team and a leadership that will never be happy until we win.”\n\n>Alonso recalled Newey’s visit to Monaco earlier this year. “He doesn’t talk to many people, but at the same time he’s always thinking and tinkering with things. The front wing here, the suspension there – I think he’s more of an artist than an engineer.”\n\n>Finally, the 32-time grand prix winner said he and Newey share a similar mindset. “When we’re motivated, we become obsessed,” he smiled.\n\nInterview basically confirms that Newey has been tinkering with the 2025 car, as a side-quest.  Like we didn't know.... with how drastically the car has went from back of the grid to now."", ""Always liked the line about Spa 2011, like\n\n> you can only race that hard with someone you trust\n\nNot to make this controversial in comparing it with now, but I always liked about say Alonso, Button, Webber etc. - you could tell they very genuinely knew this guy won't bonk you off intentionally, and they have the skill to manage wild maneuvers and really *dance*. Little things, like Monza 2010, Alonso saying he knew he needed to win on strategy because Button doesn't make errors, or waving off Canada 2011 because it's not Button's style to whack people, and he has a lot of benefit of the doubt.\n\nAs some observed at the time, it's perhaps informative about the relative pace of the cars that Alonso's fought Webber way more than Vettel."", 'Webber never recovered from Korea 2010,it was a before and after moment that you can look back.\n\nAll the remaining years he still raced he was a shell of the driver he once was.', ""Fernando: Bet you can't do a flip in the car"", 'Webbonso.

This my first post here y'all so please be gentle lol

1. Both the Aston and the Ferrari are beasts, so I can potentially see one last head-to-head dog fight between Lewis and Fernando. The two drivers that turned me from a casual fan to an F1 diehard, getting the chance at a truly storybook send-off at the top of the sport would be dope
2. Two and Three are connected, but I actually do hope Hadjar gets the ""promotion"" and absolutely kills it. It would be so much fun to watch someone go at it with Max in equal machinery. Max is genuinely one of the most fun and exciting drivers I have seen, and I always felt cheated that Daniel kinda ran from the challenge against him. I think Hadjar is a dog and ROTY, it would be cinema.
3. Because this is a new regulation cycle and all the PUs are brand new, technically, this would be the first year VCARB might actually live up to its ""sister team"" moniker and be on equal footing. If Yuki and Lawson are their drivers, there is a real fun thought experiment that Red Bull can do, the main car can be an aggressive, unhinged monster, while the VCARB can be a more balanced affair on equal PU with no hand-me-downs. Watching them this year has made me excited for the two teams to actually duke it out next year.
4. This is where it goes off the deep end. Both Bottas and/or Checo get podiums at COTA. I think it's cool to have an American works team in the biggest motorsport in the world, and call it bias, but I do think it would be a wonder for the sport for casual American fans to feel they might have a competitive team. I know Haas is also American, but they are, without a doubt, the poorest team in F1, and having Cadillac build an aura similar to the Tifosi would be cool.
5. In my hypothetical 99.99% won't happen dream season, Ferrari and Aston would be fighting out for the WCC. And I pray Williams just comes out of nowhere to beat both McLaren and Mercedes. We have had the same four teams at the top of the pecking order for so long. It would be so refreshing to see a true customer team (I say this just because Williams doesn't make a road car) in the mix. Also, their colors, kits, and drivers just scream Formula 1 to me; they feel Nostalgic!
6. This is a tiny one, but an Ollie/Gabi Podium or win would be dope just coz these two have been so refreshing this season. Ollie has been so impressive; I feel like Ferrari has their driver of the future, and Gabi just has this aggression and feel for the sport that is cool. (This one is definitely just for the vibes)
7. I did the worst math on earth, and the 2026 cars look like they'll be the smallest they have been since 2016/2017, so I'm on my hands and knees begging the universe for more fights. This season has made me feel like all the drivers have been in handcuffs, and I get the feeling they just want to let out. Zandvoort was a pretty good race because a lot of the drivers came back from the break with elbows out

That's it that's the wishlist. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts. I don't think any of these will happen but new season, new regs if this isn't the time for wishful thinking when is.

P.S.: Yes, I am a Ferrari fan, Williams is my midfield team of choice, and watching the king Hulkenberg bring a podium to my favorite backmarker team (I hate kick, Stake and the pickle rick green btw I liled them as Alfa Romeo and Charles is my guy of the current era) brought a tear to my eye.","['I need an Albon win or several, more Williams podiums, a true McLaren/Ferrari Battle (with Mercedes and Red Bull comfortably beneath, scrapping for third), and in a perverse sense of sadism I want Cadillac to be a total shitshow.

He scored a point in a Manor, a car that should've been pointless in every season. He convincingly defeated Haryanto, and was mostly ahead of Ocon too (though it was much closer).

Yet it was Ocon who got the seat in the far superior Force India car, whilst Wehrlein was booted to Sauber. In 2016, the Sauber was no better than the Manor. According to the points chart, Wehrlein's head to head racing record against Ericsson wasn't overly convincing, but he still scored two points finishes in a car that was effectively no better than a Manor.

But then he was booted out of the team in favour of Charles Leclerc, and we never heard from him again. What happened to him? How did he go from a driver people were hyping up as the next Lewis Hamilton to this?","['He went to Formula E, won a championship and came third in the most recent one.', ""Motorsports isn't just F1... he's had success in Formula E and stints in DTM and endurance series since then."", 'He had a really bad crash in race of champions which resulted in a compression fracture in a vertebrae in his neck,  so he couldnt get his neck in shape and missed the start of the 2017 season.  Combined with his previous piss-poor attitude the team (and the paddock) moved on and he has a fine career in lesser series.', ""He was a driver that was in F1 at the wrong time really as money played more of a role. Should've stayed over Ericsson but Ericsson's sponsors had majority share in the team. Williams was also an other option but they preferred the money from Stroll and Sirotkin. Everywhere else had no openings for him so he found himself out of the sport \n\nHe was apparently considered for the Force India team for the 17 season but they preferred working with Ocon from the testing they did with both drivers. So he missed that opportunity as well.\n\nHe's doing well for himself though. Races for Porsche in Formula E where he has been a champion and could very well win more titles."", 'IIRC they said he was a bit of a diva in the pits with the mechanics and engineers back then, and in the race they ended up 3-3 (not counting DNFs) with Ocon arriving halfway through the season.', ""The Sauber part is simple, Marcus Ericsson was favored by Sauber. There was some big Swedish money behind Sauber for some years that favored Marcus, and Marcus brought other funding as well.\n\nIt's not uncommon for drivers to be displaced from a seat for a year especially early in their careers. It happened to Esteban, it happened to Alex, to KMag, to Hulk, it is a thing that happens for one reason or another. Alex did DTM in his off year, just like Pascal did the year after leaving F1. Pascal was even on the Mercedes team, so clearly they hadn't abandoned him yet. I wouldn't have been surprised at all if Pascal got another F1 shot after a year off... except for Charles Leclerc. \n\nCharles Leclerc demolished Ericsson as a rookie, which a rookie outscoring a non-rookie teammate hasn't even happened since. (George could be mentioned, but Kubica did score that one time, and also, let's be real, Kubica wasn't a normal veteran.) Suddenly, it didn't matter that Pascal was better than Ericsson, because Ericsson was out of a seat himself.\n\nThe earlier parts I don't know much about. I didn't watch then and haven't looked into it. Both of them were Mercedes juniors. I'm not sure if Pascal was managed by Toto or not like Ocon is. Maybe Ocon was favored from that. Maybe it was because like you said, Ocon was immediately nearly on pace with Pascal, even though Pascal received preseason testing and 12 races before Esteban got there."", 'Like some people have said, at Sauber Ericsson was favoured due to a majority of the team being owned by swedish sponsors, which put pressure on him being made priority by the team. He still beat Ericsson if I remember right, but not by enough a margin to make a name for himself. It was the same thing with Nasr in 2016, you can assume that it was the same inner scenario with Charles in 2018, but Leclerc intubated Ericsson anyways.\n\nAlso, as someone else pointed out, Wehrlein had a bad relationship with his team, and that always creates a stain thats hard to wash. I dont think he changed much either, last I heard he was also having some petty spats with his teammate in Formula E.', 'Hype is a fickle thing. It comes and goes easily.', 'This post could have been a Google search.']",0,38,0.37,0,33,33,0,1,0.02999999999999997,0
