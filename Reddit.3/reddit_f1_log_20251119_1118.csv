The level of English doesn't seem too complicated, and the mini-essay text pieces aren't that long, and accompanied by plenty of easy picture captions.\n\nThey're written by former F1 journalists including Maurice Hamilton (previously a motor racing correspondent for The Observer newspaper, and now a BBC Radio 5 commentator, according to his bioblurb), Tony Dodgins (previously with Autosport, now an occasional BBC TV commentator), and Frank Hopkinson (former deputy editor of F1 Racing magazine), and come with introductions by figures like Sir Jackie Stewart, Damon Hill, Mark Webber, etc., and include anecdotes as well as facts. There's something like 7 total so far on different topics such as circuits, controversies, and pivotal events. _Formula 1: The Pursuit of Speed_ which seems to be kind of an overview of the sport, but is from 2017 so it may be out of print in paper.\n\nI have the ones for _The Champions: 75 Years of Legendary F1 Drivers_ (also with quotes and vintage interviews; goes from Farina up to Verstappen) from 2025 and _The Rivals: F1's Greatest Duels_ from 2023 (16 chapters going from Fangio vs. Ascari up to Hamilton vs. Verstappen). I got them as ebooks bought during discount sales so I can't comment on the print quality of the paper editions, sorry, but they're pretty nice. You can see samples of the interior text/pictures over at the publisher's website catalogue at Quarto.com via the Google Play previews for the more recently published books.\n\nAlso, _Formula One Racing For Dummies_ by Jonathan Noble (journalist for Motorsport.com and The Race) is available in French translation as _La Formule 1 Pour Les Nuls_ and is reasonably up to date, informative, and easy to read.

1p12wxg,Top 10: Most controversial penalty calls during a Formula 1 title fight,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p12wxg/top_10_most_controversial_penalty_calls_during_a/,2025-11-19, News,,"[""Back in the day the only penalties available were drive through, 10 second stop-go, and DSQ, so any penalty applied would've had massive consequences. Like Senna 1989 and Villeneuve 1997. And Montoya 2003 and Hamilton 2008."", ""This list could've been entirely 2021 penalties. That year's stewarding was horrific and that's before we get to AD21."", ""There's actually quite a bit more to the Schumacher 1994 incident. Like the penalty being given after the deadline, making the penalty and all of the follow up illegal.\n\nThe funniest part however is from 4 years later when at the same track, the exact same stewards tried to do the exact same thing to Schumacher. Penalty being given once again after the deadline, etc. That time however FIA revoked the stewards' licenses for incompetence."", 'That Valencia safety car was so fucking stupid.', ""The Senna 89 decision gets looked over a fair bit but it was extremely egregious and obvious, and honestly it's kinda forutnate for the FIA that Senna essentially got revenge on it a year later in far more explosive fashion (and that it didn't practically matter due to the vents of AUS). If Jean-Marie Balestre was stil around I can only imagine how ridiculous Abu Dhabi 21 would have been."", 'Enjoyed that 👍', 'Explains why Mansell decided to just crash into Senna when he saw he is given black flags for several laps.', 'In terms of penalty calls not really, maybe Max deserved more for Saudi and Brazil but thats about it', ""No, that was different. It happened in 1989 when Mansell wasn't even a title contender that year.\n\nMansell's crash with Senna wasn't intentional either, just a clumsy error when attempting an overtake. He most likely saw the black flag but ignored it (probably hoping he and the team can fight it post-race), and continued to race.\n\nThat crash did have a major impact on the championship though, since Senna was running ahead of Prost and looked set to gain points on the latter, instead he ended up losing points thanks to the DNF. Which played a role in setting up the stage for Suzuka 1989."", '""maybe"" lol\n\nGo and rewatch the Brazil battle, how far off track he goes trying to block Hamilton is hilarious. If that\'s not a penalty I don\'t know what is.\n\nAnd in Saudi the stewards essentially admit he brake tested Hamilton (which should really be a black flag) yet they only give the same penalty you get for making contact normally, and conveniently wait until it was clear that the penalty would not affect the result and title fight.\n\nThe whole climax of the season was characterised by stewards and race direction being so scared of ""interfering"" in the title fight that they let it cloud their judgement.']",17,13,0.75,17,11,11,7,4,-0.06000000000000005,7
1p0bd87,What's a good race to watch from someones POV?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p0bd87/whats_a_good_race_to_watch_from_someones_pov/,2025-11-18, Discussion,"I want to watch good perspectives of overtakes and in general, a good and consistent racing line. Like you can usually view really good overtakes and turns only from replays in the broadcast, but I think watching how a single racer performs in a proper uninterrupted lap can really compare them to other racers. Or see how they try to continuously attack or defend against an opponent. I saw Max's POV of Brazil '25 and that was very interesting, in terms of his pits and overtakes.","[""Perhaps Brazil 2021 - that's back when qualifying set the sprint grid, and the sprint finish set the grand prix grid. Well, there were freight delays, and Hamilton's car failed scrutineering at the end of qualifying so he had to start from the back. He took a new engine (triggering a five-place grand prix grid drop), went from 20th to 5th in the sprint, and went from 10th to 1st in the grand prix.\n\nMaybe Spain 2021 (which copied the strategy from Hungary a few years prior) where Hamilton had a tire advantage but the team still had him do a surprise two-stop strategy and made up massive time to pass Max several laps earlier than anyone predicted.\n\n1996 Monaco was hilarious to watch as only three cars finished and the lead changed multiple times in the last lap."", 'Stroll Brasil 24, especially during the formation lap you can see him take an interesting line', 'Sergio in Shakir 2020', 'Probably Hamilton Brazil 2021', 'Sebastian Vettel - Brazil 2012. There used to a version on Youtube that was raw footage, no commentary, no radio and it was INTENSE.', 'Any race that has someone coming from the back. Like max in Brazil this year and last year.\n\nWatching from a driver that is defending for position higher than the car should allow all race like hadjar in zandvoort this year could also be good.', 'Maybe watch alonso in Brazil 2023 to see the different lines he was taking to defend against perez', '[Verstappen Brazil 2016 final laps onboard + team radio](https://youtu.be/IBnixyOK8uQ)', 'Jenson in Canada?', '2021 COTA from Max’s POV. At the end Gio tells him something to the effect of “go hard” I think he said “full lift” or something like that.\n\nAnyway, Lewis is breathing down his neck and max steps it up. You can see him driving deeper into the corner, making more micro corrections charging the esses harder. It was cool to watch it unfold in the moment.']",9,28,0.7,9,188,188,0,0,0.019999999999999907,0
