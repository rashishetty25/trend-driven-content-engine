1otk0p0,2025 Antonelli v. 2007 Hamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otk0p0/2025_antonelli_v_2007_hamilton/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"With everyone on TV (Sky and F1TV) making a big deal that Antonelli has now scored the most points in a rookie season (122) surpassing Hamilton (109), I thought it would be interesting to compare and contrast what this actually means.

2025 - Antonelli has scored 122 points in 22 Grand Prix races and 4 Sprint races - 110 points from GPs and 12 from Sprints. This is in a season where championship points are awarded from 25 to 1 for the top 10 finishers in GPs, and  8 to 1 for the top 8 finishers in Sprints. In GP races alone, he is averaging 6.47 points per race.

2007 - Hamilton scored 109 points in 17 Grand Prix races; there were no Sprint races. In 2007 points were awarded 10 to 1 for the top 8 finishers. In those races Hamilton averaged 6.41 points per race. If the 2025 points system were in place for 2007, Hamilton would have totaled 263 points that year, averaging 15.47 points per race.

I think it's fair to say Kimi's rookie season has been very good, but isn't anywhere near as good as Lewis' rookie season in 2007. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.","[""It's a nonsense to compare different point system without conversion, so yeah, their points are really far apart."", 'Adjusting 2007 to the current system Lewis would have had 265 points or 62.4% of the maximum possible total (425), Kimi only has 21.6% (out of 565).\n\nAnd BTW that 62.4% is the highest someone who would have finished 3rd (Alonso gets one more point in the current system) has ever gotten.', ""I really wish they'd stop using the points scored stat unless they're comparing Kimi to another rookie 2010 or later."", 'More races and a whole different points system. 5th now gets the points that the winner got back then.\n\nSo I don’t think their rookie seasons are in the same league. Hamilton was fighting for the championship that season and by countback beat his 2x reigning champion team-mate Alonso.\n\nIt’s not like Antonelli has the machinery to fight for the championship unlike Hamilton did but Antonelli also has less than half the points of Russell.\n\nAntonelli is not bad by any means and drives like his debut, Canada and Brazil proves there really is promise in this guy. But Hamilton had the best rookie season in the history of F1 (unless we’re counting 1950).\n\nSo in this particular matter for Antonelli it is not a shame to be beaten by the best.', 'Lewis’ debut was sensational. It’s probably the one F1 record that might never get beaten.', 'People who think that Kimi did a better rookie season than Lewis : \n""My friend got 9/10 at his test, but I’m a better student because I got 11/20, and 11 is greater than 9 !""', 'No point paying much mind to points records as the system has not been the same over the years. Sergio Perez is 8th in all time points scored. Bottas is 6th.', 'This post is helpful for misguided newbies.', 'Not the biggest fan of Hamilton, but his rookie season was cartoonishly spectacular. I don’t think we have seen anything as good in the modern era of F1, nor are we likely to see something like that till the end of F1. 6 podiums in his first six races, scoring like 65% of the maximum possible points, being the bookie favourite for the WDC, mentally disintegrating the man who unseated Michael Friggin Schumacher. I mean obvious maths apart, that debut was so unrealistically unbelievable, they would have to fictionally nerf him when the biopic gets made just to make it seem realistic for the viewers. \n\nKimi’s debut season has been crazy good, but cm’on, Hamilton’s was a few light years ahead.

ROME — Proud of the double title won in endurance racing, but disappointed with the Formula 1 team — and especially with the drivers, Leclerc and Hamilton.
These are strong words from John Elkann, spoken in the Hall of Honour at CONI during the presentation of the partnership between Stellantis and the Milano-Cortina Foundation:

“Ferrari wins when it is united — that’s what the WEC result teaches us. In Formula 1 we have mechanics who are always the best in pit-stop execution, and engineers who work tirelessly to improve the car. We need drivers who think more about Ferrari and less about themselves.”

Kimi has taken a lot of flak this season, but performances like his at Interlagos proves that this kid is really going to be something in F1.', ""Lando is getting a lot of well-deserved credit for his run of form, but I want to specifically point out the improvements he's made on his starts from pole. He's now converted every single standing start from pole position (7) to victory in the last 365 days and has done so without losing the lead at the start for any of them, something that seemed unthinkable for him last season: Abu Dhabi, Australia, Monaco, Austria, Mexico, and Brazil (gp and sprint). The one pole he has failed to convert to victory in the last year was Spa, which had a rolling start.\n\n*(Yes, he made a mistake in turn 1 and Oscar capitalized, but considering the unique circumstances \\[rolling start, wet\\] and the factors working against him \\[pole being notoriously difficult to hold onto at Spa, plus whatever role his battery issues played\\], I don't think it's unreasonable to look at that one as an outlier and not fully representative for his current form).*\n\nHis starts and SC restarts were perfect this weekend including in the damp conditions of the sprint, and last race out in Mexico he held onto pole at a track where leading into turn 1 from pole is notoriously difficult. His starts are still not perfect and he has plenty of room for improvement, as we've seen this season in races where he's starting P2/P3 etc, but it's clear he's absolutely worked on this achilles heel that plagued him for much of last season and it's nice as a fan to see the tangible improvements he's made and the results that come with it. I think the same could be said for Oscar, as much as his current slump is the topic right now, it's clear he knew qualifying was a weakness of his last year and took huge strides to improve going into this year, and it paid off for him for much of the season."", 'It honestly baffles me that if Oscar didn\'t break even harder when he saw Antonelli turning it, and would have instead kept going and therefore been first to the apex, absolutely punting Antonelli into Leclerc ruining 3 driver\'s cars, he\'d have probably been fine as he was ""ahead at the apex"".\n\nThe current rules, or at least the interpretation of them, is antithetical to good racing.\n\nOscar\'s move yesterday was a bold one that at worst should have gone down as a 5s each for him and Antonelli, because ultimately Antonelli had a full car width to his right so could have avoided it, or ideally just a racing incident. \n\nIt honestly makes me lose some interest in the sport, as it basically means the only way to pass is a pit strategy, a flyby from a much faster car, or a dirty dive bomb up the inside, we rarely get wheel-to-wheel racing.', 'A few thoughts about the race:\n\n* First off... the TV direction! Finally, they actually showed all the battles at the end instead of just zooming in on the winner. Loved the little split screens showing the other fights happening around the track.\n* McLaren Boys. Lando had an awesome race. You could tell he managed his tyres really well most of the way through. Shame Max started so far back, because we could’ve had a proper showdown. Lando’s clearly been working on his mindset this year, and it’s paying off. Perfect timing for him to hit form like this. Oscar’s still going through a rough patch, though. I might be wrong, but at this point it feels more likely that Max takes P2 in the championship than Oscar wins it. And yeah, McLaren’s strategy for him was a bit weird... they kept him out forever in the first stint only to go for a two-stop anyway.\n* Those final laps between Max and Kimi were amazing. Gotta give credit to the rookie, he held his own.\n* And Max… wow. P3 from the pit lane, in a dry race, no big Safety Cars or red flags and with a puncture? Unreal.\n\nInterlagos once again proving why it’s one of the best tracks on the calendar.', ""Aston Martin had so much of potential after coming off the backs of a very promising sprint qualifying. Alonso fortunately managed his race well, even after conceding the position in a *(never seen ever)* tussle with Leclerc. Stroll had a decent one as well. But Christ, them going on the hards in the main race definitely killed some of the momentum that they have had. With Stroll, the contact with Tsunoda spells compromise on his end but I don't know what they were doing for Alonso here. It sucks to see them flip-flopping this way\n\nConversely, VCARB can leave Interlagos, feeling proud of the double points finish! Started the sprints relatively meh for both drivers with nothing egregious of note *(I think Lawson had an incident, or maybe my memory is playing games with me)* but their main qualifying and races were the highlights! Outqualifying the main outfit, optimal starting strategies, pace management, a bit of flip-flopping across the board but each of them managed to claw their way back into the fold, Lawson creating a DRS train *(ha!)* and giving them the room to race each other, and other drivers. Nothing but my kudos to them"", 'We went from expecting a 3 way showdown for the WDC in Abu Dhabi to Norris most likely wrapping it up in Qatar, also the way things are going for Oscar lately I wouldn’t be surprised if max takes P2 in the WDC.', 'This was great TV direction. But also, on F1TV, you could literally hear when JP left the office, F1 without 2 or 3 commentators really does not feel natural.', 'I must say I am aghast that for an organisation who prides themselves on excellent marketing and public relations with the media and the consumer, John Elkann\'s comments that were reported on Sky Italia is the **exact opposite** of what you should be saying to the press about Ferrari\'s performance\n\nNo, Elkann. In what world are your two high-profile drivers nursing LiCo issues every lap a vast improvement to the car? In what universe has this race been sufficient for your drivers to extract maximum potential out of this machinery that has set your trajectory back by a long mile since 2024? When your long-staying employee was taken out through no fault of his own during a race, and your decorated 7-time world champion has a car that is looking like it\'ll break under the weight of its grip and stability issues, how are they able to work with those? Funny that the comparison to the WEC team came about, because the latter *(that is under AF CORSE by the way)* actually had everyone working in sync to ensure maximum potential was extracted DESPITE the BoP issues plaguing them. It is the effort of both team and driver that got them there, not this *""we must stay united and i demand maximum results""* malarkey\n\nFrankly, it seems that everytime I talk about Ferrari\'s lows, I keep circling back to the same fundamental issue. When would it get to a point where Elkann, Vigna and the rest of the higher echelons will even realise that a lot of Ferrari\'s current stinkers is coming from *them* and their whacky integrated politics that barely gives any of their personnel a chance to move the needle forward?', 'The fun drivers have with silly parade cars makes me wish they were somehow thrown into a promotional kart race.']",34,145,0.91,34,1061,1061,-1,0,-0.020000000000000018,-1

1otgqka,A visual analysis of Piastris Penalty,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otgqka/a_visual_analysis_of_piastris_penalty/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"The basis for any analysis has to be the Driving Standard Guidelines obviously, which say:

>A. Overtaking on the INSIDE of a corner:

>To be entitled to be given room when overtaking on the INSIDE, the overtaking car must:

>i) Have its front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE THE MIRROR of the other car PRIOR TO AND AT THE

>APEX

>ii) Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex, and not have “dived in”.

>iii) In the Stewards’ estimation, have taken a reasonable racing line and been able to complete the

>move whilst remaining within track limits.

As well as:

>Chicanes and S-Bends:

>i) The above guides for INSIDE and OUTSIDE may apply for each element of the combination.

>Generally, priority will be given to the first corner element.

That being said, the FIA does not further clarify what overlap the overtaking car has to have inbetween the not further specified ""prior to the apex"" and the apex on it self.  
The interesting question is how they deal with cases were the overtaking car has an overlap of the frontaxle with the other cars mirrors.   
Because when you have to brake for the inside line, you have to brake earlier than for the outside line. Oscar Piastri braking earlier than Kimi Antonelli can be ovserved on his onboard.

What I did was look up at what point Piastri initiated his braking from the onboard and then cross-referenced it to the camera shot from above. I then drew some parallel lines through the front axle of Leclercs and Piastris car as well as Piastris and Antonellis rear wing.   
[The resulting picture is this](https://imgur.com/a/GYAkbFq).  
They all matched up pretty precisely, so unless all three of them had the same deviation from going straight, they should be a pretty precise 90° angle to the direction of the straight.

So from the line going through piastris front axle, it looks like Piastris front axle, at the point of braking, where you have to decide if you go for the move or not, is in fact overlapping Antonellis mirrors. Although of course the image is tilted, so the different height of the axle and the mirrors shift the perspective a bit. but even then, the picture shows a bit of safety margin.

So what the FIA is basically claryfying with their decision is:  
Even if you have an overlap on the straight and at the start of the braking zone, you are NOT entitled to a line if you have to brake harder and therefore do not have the overlap anymore.

From here on I'll quickly talk about why the other points of the sporting section do not (fully) apply.

1. ""Overlap at the Apex"" - pretty easy. They did not reach the Apex before coliding, so this can not apply. 
2. ""Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex"" - While many argued that his lock up shows that he is not in full control, I refuse this proposition. The front left tyre which he locks up is unloaded in the first corner and has a far lower friction coefficient than the right front which he does not lock up. Which means, that even though the front left locks up, he still is very close to the braking optimum (albeit flatspotting his front left). Behind him, Russell locks up in exactly the same way and is still able to turn in normally despite the lock up.
3. ""and not have “dived in”."" - A divebomb is when a car brakes later than the car in front to reach an overlap. It might include not being able to take the inside line with the resulting speed. Piastri did in fact brake earlier than Antonelli.

So the only thing left to penalize Piastri for is losing the required overlap inbetween the braking zone and the apex.  
Which should sound wrong to anybody, as it means that braking later to have that overlap and force the other driver into a wider line is fine. While braking earlier means you are left with no way out, if the outside driver does not give you room.","['Good in depth analysis.\n\nWorth noting that there is historic precedent (several incidents last year) for the idea that the overtaking car needs to have the overlap and maintain the overlap all the way to the corner, so it is not unreasonable that they applied that same logic here.\n\nWhether or not that logic is sensible to be encoded into the guidelines in the first place is another thing.', 'It says right there that the overtaking car must have its front axle at least alongside the mirror of the defending car prior to the apex. It says the exact same thing in the decision document. \n\n>""PIA did not establish the required overlap prior to and at the apex, as his front axle was not alongside the mirror of Car 12"".\n\nThat\'s the required overlap. \n\nWhether he managed to get alongside on the straight well before is pretty irrelevant. \n\n>So the only thing left to penalize Piastri for is losing the required overlap inbetween the braking zone and the apex.\n\nHe didn\'t manage to safely arrive at the apex. Therefore collision is on him since they didn\'t even reach the point (apex) where it could be assessed if he is entitled to the corner.', ""Honestly, I hate the rules and I also complained on reddit earlier about his penalty. Not because I didn't think he deserved it based on the rules, but because I think the rules are stupid. (And because Oscar is one of my husband's favorite drivers, and his recent problems have been really really not fun around my house.)\n\nBut, after more consideration with the lockup... I still think the rules are stupid, but I do think the lockup pushed it towards being clear that it was Oscar's fault.\n\nI still don't like the rules."", ""\\>So from the line going through piastris front axle, it looks like Piastris front axle, at the point of braking, where you have to decide if you go for the move or not, is in fact overlapping Antonellis mirrors.\xa0\n\nThat's why I was saying firstly that it is perfectly legal by current guidelines move, but they clearly judged next moments after braking began and Piastri started a little earlier because being inside.

1otchep,Proposed Regulation Overhaul for Overtaking and Racing Room,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otchep/proposed_regulation_overhaul_for_overtaking_and/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"Hello dead F1 fans! Following the Piastri penalty I see a lot of chatter on the overtaking rules once again and how people think they are, simply put, not that good. It's too easy for the defending driver to be entitled to space and too hard for the attacking driver to get alongside to be eligible for a move (especially from the outside). 

  
This is simply a problem because I for one, enjoy a lot overtaking attempts on the outside and two these rules some times seem to be opposite of what we call the racing spirit. For these reason and many more I want to share with you a rule concept I thought of that could make side to side racing easier to exist and judge for fans and stewards alike.

**Determination of Racing Rights at Corner Entry**

1. **Establishing Overlap** A driver attempting to overtake is entitled to racing room if, at the moment the defending driver commits to turn-in, the front axle of the attacking car is at least alongside the rear axle of the defending car.
2. **Definition of Turn-In** “Turn-in” occurs when the defending car begins a sustained steering input that causes the car to start cornering. Brief or minimal steering movements that do not result in the car turning are **not** considered turn-in.
3. **Responsibilities**
   * When overlap exists at turn-in, both drivers must leave at least one car’s width of track for each other through the corner.
   * When no overlap exists at turn-in, the defending driver may take the normal racing line.
   * The attacking driver must remain under control and keep within track limits; loss of control cancels their right to space.
4. **Applicability to All Corners** For long or multi-apex corners, the overlap status at the initial committed turn-in applies for the duration of the corner.



# Key points

* **One clear moment of judgment:** the committed turn-in.
* **No numeric thresholds in the text:** FIA can set technical detection criteria (like steering-angle % and minimum lateral-G) in a separate appendix.
* **Works everywhere:** from Monaco’s hairpin to Monza’s Parabolica.

\---

  
So pretty much the idea is simple. When the defending driver actually commits to the corner that's when we judge whether the attacker should be allowed space or not. I think this is the easiest way for everyone to intuitively know where that moment is as the drivers and viewers alike pretty much understand which moment the defender starts cornering and if the stewards have to be involved they have to look at simple 3 data parameters and then check if the attacking car was alongside the defender the moment the defender committed to the corner. 



Thank you for reading and if you have any ideas please leave them below!

\*Bonus info\*

In this segment I want to simply clarify more when the moment of commitment actually happens;

# 1. Conceptual meaning

In racing terms, *turn-in* is the **moment a driver stops braking in a straight line and begins steering the car into the corner.**  
It’s the commitment point where the car transitions from longitudinal control (braking/acceleration) to lateral control (cornering).

At that moment:

* The driver has chosen a line and braking point.
* The car’s direction begins to change measurably.
* The defending driver’s ability to react or adjust line drastically reduces — which is why this instant is critical for judging overtaking rights.

# 2. Why this matters for rules

All overtaking rules depend on when both drivers have *committed* to their lines.  
The attacker must be alongside **before** that commitment — otherwise, the defender can’t be expected to leave space safely.

# 3. Technical definition (as used by telemetry or stewards)

>

# a. “Transition from neutral to sustained steering input”

* **Neutral** steering means the car is still moving roughly straight (minor corrections only).
* **Sustained input** means the driver holds a steady steering direction rather than quick flicks or wheel twitches.
* This prevents drivers from artificially triggering “turn-in” early with a fake steering blip.

# b. “Sufficient steering angle”

* The steering angle must reach a *meaningful percentage* of the typical angle required for that specific corner (about **30–50%**, depending on geometry).
* This ensures the car is genuinely beginning the turn, not just being adjusted in the braking zone.

# c. “Initiate lateral acceleration consistent with the corner”

* Lateral acceleration (side G-force) is the physical proof that the car has actually started turning.
* For an F1 car, anything above **0.4–0.6 g** indicates real cornering has begun.
* Combining this with steering data ensures turn-in is *objective*, not opinion-based.

# d. “Consistent with the corner being approached”

* Each corner has a characteristic radius and therefore a normal expected steering load.
* The telemetry comparison is relative to that corner’s geometry (so Parabolica and Monaco hairpin are judged differently).

# How it prevents abuse

* **Fake early steering:** doesn’t generate enough G or sustain → ignored.
* **Late divebomb:** attacker not alongside before turn-in → no right to space.
* **Fair inside move:** attacker has overlap before or exactly at turn-in → entitled to room.
* **Outside pass:** same logic — if overlap exists when the defender commits, the defender must leave room.","['The problem with any attempt to make a hard and fast rule about overtaking is that there are simply too many variables, it is always destined to fail. The idea of turn in point falls apart because every driver has a slightly different turn in point and way of doing it, the idea of the apex collapses because there are so many corners with multiple apexes or can be early or late etc.\n\nThe solution is simple, get a consistent group of permanent stewards made up of 3 drivers permanently so it’s not just 1 persons opinion carrying weight. If 2 of the 3 agree it’s a penalty, if all 3 agree then it’s the larger penalty (ie the difference between a 5 or 10 second as a slam dunk) and also allow them to issue a penalty for dangerous or unsporting defending without needing to prove moving in the braking zone.\n\nMost of all, cut out the “it’s been referred to the stewards” rubbish, they can intervene and issue a penalty without needing the race director to give them permission to look at it first, and hopefully will be much faster to get a decision.', ""Not interested in chatGPT's 'ideas'."", ""Part of the reason for the existing rules is because it's simply not possible to be looking in the mirrors at predefined points to figure out if there's a car alongside while also trying to navigate the turn. \n\nThe current rules put an emphasis on the attacking car to ensure they're sufficiently alongside so the defending driver can see him from his cockpit whilst making the turn. \n\nThe thinking is, that the attacking driver can see the defending driver in his peripheral vision, but the defending driver can't have eyes in the back of their head, so the onus is put on the attacking driver to fairly make themselves visible to the defending driver's cockpit, so that safe racing can occur.\n\nYour suggestion is puts the onus on the defending driver to check where the car is \\_behind\\_ them, whilst also trying to spot their turn in and handle all the car control, which is exactly what the current rules are designed to avoid."", 'I could really do without these “regulation proposals” each week.', 'Front axle at rear axle at the turn in point was never and should never be enough to claim space, thats just insufficient overlap. \n\nAnd those technical definitions are just way overcomplicated to apply to every single, unique scenario in such a dynamic sport.

1st: Lando Norris (390 points)
2nd: Oscar Piastri (24 points behind Lando)
3rd: Max Verstappen (49 points behind Lando)
With  3 races left (Las Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi), with a total of 83 points still available.

Norris must be 26 or more points ahead of his closest rival after the Qatar Grand Prix to be crowned champion.

Remaining Races & Maximum Points (Total: 83)
 * Las Vegas GP: 25 points
 * Qatar GP (Sprint Weekend): 33 points (8 from Sprint + 25 from GP)
 * Abu Dhabi GP: 25 points

Lando Norris can  mathematically eliminate Max Verstappen, and second, he must secure the title against his teammate.

A: Eliminating Max Verstappen ( las vegas )
 After Las Vegas, 58 points will remain (33 in Qatar + 25 in Abu Dhabi). If Norris's lead over Verstappen is 59 points or more, Verstappen is mathematically eliminated.
 Norris must outscore Verstappen by 10 points in Las Vegas to be 59+ points clear.

 * Norris finishes P1 (25 pts), Verstappen finishes P3 (15 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P2 (18 pts), Verstappen finishes P6 (8 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P3 (15 pts), Verstappen finishes P8 (4 pts) or lower. (Gap = 60+)
 * Norris finishes P4 (12 pts), Verstappen finishes P9 (2 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P5 (10 pts), Verstappen finishes P10 (1 pt) or lower. (Gap = 58+, but Verstappen would lose on countback).
 * Norris finishes P6 (8 pts) or lower, he cannot eliminate Verstappen in Las Vegas, regardless of Verstappen's result.


 B: Winning the Championship vs. Piastri (Qatar)
Norris needs to gain just 2 net points over Piastri across the next two events (Las Vegas GP and Qatar Sprint/GP).


Scenario 1: Norris gains in Las Vegas
Norris wins (25 pts), Piastri finishes 2nd (18 pts).
Norris gains 7 points.
Norris's lead grows from 24 to 31 points.
Norris could afford to be outscored by Piastri by 5 points and still win the championship (31 - 5 = 26).

Scenario 2: Piastri gain in Las Vegas
Piastri wins (25 pts), Norris finishes 2nd (18 pts).
Piastri gains 7 points.
 
Norris's lead shrinks from 24 to 17 points.
The fight would go to Qatar, where Norris would need to outscore Piastri by 9 points (17 + 9 = 26) over the Sprint and GP to clinch the title there.

Scenario 3: DNF for Norris
 Piastri wins (25 pts), Norris has a DNF (0 pts).
 Piastri gains 25 points.
Piastri takes a 1-point lead in the championship.

C: Abu Dhabi
Any scenario where Norris leaves Qatar with a lead of 25 points or less will take the championship to the final race.
If the gap is 25 points, Piastri would have to win the race with Norris scoring zero points

Yes, he finished dead last, but keep in mind that he had *two* penalties, the second of which was caused by the team.
 
Without those extra 20 seconds he would have finished P8, having started P19. That's pretty solid.

I know it's popular to bash whoever happens to be in the second RB seat, but it seems that Tsunoda is improving, and is working better with the team. I am not sure whether that is down to Mekies.

For next year, the rules change completely so everyone starts from zero.

Would it not be more beneficial to continue with a driver that is known to the team and that right now is talking and working with the same people who are designing and will be developing next season's car?

The other option is of course Hadjar. He has been an amazing rookie. But is he mature and experienced enough to help develop next year's Red Bull, especially when he has no established rapport with Red Bull engineers and, as a rising star, will be under tremendous pressure next to Max in a car that is expected to win?

As much as I like Yuki, I have to admit that it's a tough decision. Laurent Mekies has worked with both drivers, so I suppose that he already has an opinion on the matter, and a well-educated one at that.

Personally, I'd err on the side of caution and keep Yuki for '26, and let Hadjar mature in the lower pressure environment of the second team.
