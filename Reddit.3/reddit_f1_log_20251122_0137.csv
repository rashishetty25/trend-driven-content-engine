1p2ur11,Engine too weak in 2026? According to Red Bull nothing is proven,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p2ur11/engine_too_weak_in_2026_according_to_red_bull/,2025-11-21, News,"Translation:

Most recently, it was rumored that Mercedes had developed an engine that would make the competition look old. At the same time, it leaked out that Red Bull Racing is probably lagging behind.

The once-dominant F1 racing team is no longer supplied by Honda for the first time since 2019, but relies on a drive system developed in collaboration with Ford. But are there any problems with the new engine?

Asked by ""oe24.at"" about this, Red Bull motorsport consultant Helmut Marko weighed in. ""There is nothing proven about this just because Mercedes declares itself the favourite,"" the 82-year-old told the Austrian portal.

At the same time, he admitted that ""of course it is unlikely that we will come with our own engine and be the fastest."" Red Bull will unveil the new power unit and the upcoming car at Ford in Detroit on January 15, 2026 in the United States.

Marko, meanwhile, piled deep before the start of the upcoming season. ""As long as we don't have a complete chance, as we did with Renault (engine/editor), that's fine,"" he alluded to 2017 and 2018, when the French carmaker's engine at the time dropped significantly compared to the competition.


Marko: Red Bull aims to win Formula 1 races in late 2026

""In addition, there is the FIA's regulation that you can readjust after six months,"" Marko pointed to new opportunities at the middle of the year.

The title is therefore not the ultimate goal for Red Bull in the first year of the new technical regulations. ""As long as we see that the new car is moving forward, we are satisfied,"" Marko said, adding: ""The ability to win is the end goal. In other words, we want to win races again in the second half of the year.""","[""not relevant to the topic but reading *82 year old* is wild lol, the fact that he's still travelling to every race is mindboggling, at his big age? crazy love for the game, but i think he'll finally retire once he puts a decent driver in RBR 2nd alongwith a promising lineup in the second team."", 'Regardless of its accuracy and honesty is it smart to signal to your ultra competitive driver who’s also the hottest property on the drivers market that he shouldn’t be expecting to win races until late 2026. \n\nIf Max has internally accepted this he’s clearly just sitting back in 2026 to see who has the fastest car unless Red Bull comes up with some magic.', ""God this winter's speculation is going to be so silly.\xa0"", 'Toto: Maxie, I emailed you the contract for 2027.

They know their own performance but have no idea how the others are doing. \n\nThis is just politics to downplay any failures. Mercedes was supposed to have a rocket for 22 and nothing. Meanwhile mclaren failed to have a new car by season start and then had a rocket. \n\nThe only thing Marko was right is that RBR starts on the back foot being their first engine.

1p2t55s,First Time Watching the 2021 Season Round 1: Bahrain,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p2t55s/first_time_watching_the_2021_season_round_1/,2025-11-21, Discussion,"FIRST TIME WATCHING THE 2021 SEASON ROUND 1: BAHRAIN

Hi everyone! Don’t know if this is allowed here but I thought it might interest a few people.

I started getting into F1 in the offseason after 2022 thanks to YouTube constantly pushing FormulaBone videos at me until I finally caved. My first season actually watching every race was 2023. Even though that season was an inadvertent way to memorize the Dutch national anthem, I really enjoyed watching week after week, following the storylines online, and I became hooked, I’ve been watching ever since.
As I dove deeper into the world of F1, I discovered that apparently, the 2021 season is worth watching and some even consider it the best season of F1 of all time (I’m sure that’s debatable). Since this season is almost at its end and I’ve grown impatient waiting for Las Vegas this weekend, I decided I would finally start watching the 2021 season from start to finish. On top of that, I figured I’d document my thoughts while watching every race, maybe it’ll amuse a lot of you on here. So, I’m just gonna write down my thoughts as I watch this race. I don’t really have a schedule of when I’ll watch all the races, but the holidays are upon us as well, that gives me a chance to watch a lot more too.

ROUND 1: BAHRAIN

-Wow, baby Max

-Huge expectations on Lewis to win the 8th, but from the beginning the commentators are making it clear that this season is Lewis vs. Max

-Oh, hi Christian Horner! (Rip)

-Weird seeing Russell in a Williams, I didn’t realize that’s where he was before Mercedes

-There are so many drivers I haven’t seen before: Bottas in a Mercedes (I’m excited for him and Checo in Cadillac next year), Vettel, Danny Ric in a McLaren, Kimi (how worth it is it to watch the 2008 season?), Giovinazzi (who?), Lattiffi (I’ve heard him called 🐐-tiffi), Mick Schumacher, and Mazepin

-Crazy to think that face masks were a thing in F1, I hadn’t thought about that

-Formation lap, dammit Checo…you just got to Red Bull. Anyone know if his move to Red Bull was largely attributed to his win in Sahkir from 2020? He’s starting from the pit lane right now.

-Oh, now I know why they called him Maze-spin…

-VSC must have been new this season, Martin Brundle clearly doesn’t like them in the broadcast

-These graphics are so cool, I kinda wish they’d use them today.

-So was Mercedes on a high of building good cars? This Mercedes looks amazing compared to what I’ve seen.

-Oh shoot, Checo out here trying to prove himself, he’s up to 5th!

-I’m learning that this is the season where Alonso returned after his two year hiatus.

-Hamilton back in 1st, weird seeing him there but then I realize he’s the 7-time champion, I missed the Hamilton era.

-I wonder why Mick’s abbreviation is “MSC” instead of “SCH”? Maybe he didn’t want to use the abbreviation his dad used?

-Why isn’t Lewis using the #1? I thought the champion used #1 in the livery? Max in a #33 feels weird lol

-Yuki with a spiky haircut makes him look like a high schooler

-Stroll is beating Vettel…odd.

-I want to explain that I know how this season ends, I know that the last race was very controversial. But I feel like watching the whole season will provide all the context as to why this season was so divisive. I’m excited to see the progression.

-Checo is not doing bad for debuting with Red Bull. Checo is my favorite driver #Mexico and I’m excited for him to return but this being his first season in Red Bull will be cool to see. I’m also aware that this is the season where he earned the nickname “The Mexican Minister of Defense”, let’s see why. Not a bad drive thus far being at lap 27/56.

-Checo used to be teammates with Lance???

-What’s up with these new regulations that they keep talking about? That’s something about F1 that I still struggle to understand.

-Hamilton has been hanging on to the lead for a while here.

-Fascinating, Mercedes pitted Lewis in lap 29, now he’s down in 3rd

-Norris holding steady in 4th, I can see how he was eventually going to lead the championship like he’s doing right now.

-OH SHIT THEY FUCKED UP BOTTAS’S PIT STOP 10.9 SECOND PIT STOP

-Damn that sucked, Bottas down in 5th

-Verstappen with a 20 second lead? What is this, 2023??? /s

-Toto with a face mask is somehow very menacing

-Ferrari finished 6th in 2020? Wth???

-Alonso retiring in a race…so this is where it started? Lap 34/56

-Hamilton is quite vocal on the radio, looks like that’s just always how he’s been. Probably a good quality to have from a driver, communicative and always giving feedback. I’m happy to see he continues to do this in Ferrari.

-CHECO IN 4TH WOOT WOOT

-At the beginning of the race during the grid lineup Crofty pointed out that Yuki was lining up next to Kimi, youngest driver next to the oldest driver. Weird to think that at some point there was a driver older than Alonso on the grid.

-They’re talking about a 3 pit strategy…3? Was that common back then? Or is it a Bahrain thing? Nowadays I don’t think that’s common, right? Or maybe I’m just blind?

-I’m sure I can Google this but Carlos used to be teammates with Lando, right? Why did Ferrari pick up Sainz? 

-For the botched pit stop from earlier, Bottas is back up in 3rd.

-Lap 40/56, Hamilton back in the lead with a an 8.6 second gap for now.

-5111 laps…that was Michael Schumacher’s record of laps lead in a career and apparently Lewis just broke that record in this race. They also alluded to 2020 being a record-breaking season for Lewis. It’s kinda cool seeing and hearing all that after being so used to just hearing about Max and Red Bull dominance in the last three years.

-You can see the good chemistry between GP and Max…how long have those two been working together?

-Lap 43/56, there it is 5112 laps led by Lewis Hamilton…but Max is now 5.4 seconds behind.

-Oof, Checo catching up to Riccardo in 6th

-Is this Checo just being good? Or Checo driving a rocket ship?

-For this being Perez’s first season at Red Bull, he brought the sponsors! Telcel and Claro to name a few stand out to me. Red Bull wasted no time putting that stuff on the livery.

-Perez passes Danny Ric and he seems to be gaining on Charles, damn.

-Vettel hits Ocon in lap 45/56, damn 

-A graphic just came up saying Hamilton is at 95 career wins so far…I remember last year that Lewis won Silverstone that was win 104 or 114, right? Excited to see some Hamilton wins as I go through this season.

-Max cutting the gap to 3.3 seconds with ten laps to go, geez.

-Perez is 4.3 seconds from Leclerc

-It’s looking like this race is coming down to the wire, Max 2.5 seconds from Lewis lap 48/56

-Checo is just flying! 3.2 seconds from Leclerc!

-“Leave me to it Bono” Lewis has a trend of not liking it when they update him mid race. Just leave him to it dude lol

-Lap 50/56 Max 1.4 seconds from Lewis omg

-Commentators just mentioned Honda, is 2021 the first year Honda partnered with RB?

-Hamilton goes wide in turn 10! Max 1.054 seconds behind!

-Wtf happened to the car? Is it really the tires? Lewis’s tired are apparently 10 laps older than Max’s.

-Damn, first race of the season and it’s a nail biter.

-Perez 0.8 from Charles LFG

-Checo goes through to 5th!

-Max is 23 this season? Damn

-Max goes through! Lap 53/56 but Max went off track limits!

-Wait Max giving back a position??? What???

-Vettel with a 10 second time penalty, seems fair

-Check starting from the pit and ending in 5th is a great drive

-Hamilton is hanging on by a thread wow

-Lap 55/56 Max is 0.9 seconds behind Lewis

-FINAL LAP Max uses DRS and he’s 0.5 behind Hamilton 

-Bloody hell Lewis wins it by 0.7 seconds what a race

-If this is how 2021 starts I can’t wait for the rest of the season wow

-Looking back at the replay, probably a good decision to give Lewis the position back rather than waiting for the stewards to say something

-Amazing win from Lewis but that Mercedes doesn’t look all that strong…foreshadowing???

Alright, that concludes this first round of the 2021 season. Thanks for following along.

There's an Excel and Numbers version. I've never used Limewire so I hope it works.

At the bottom, you can **toggle the results** of Max's, Lando's, and Oscar's final races to check all the permutations of finishes to see who becomes WC.

I hardcoded a few (unlikely) scenarios where:

* Max finishes P1 in all the remaining GPs and the Sprint, Oscar finishes all P2, and Lando finishes all P3. That one doesn't change the current standings.
* Max finishes P2 in all the remaining GPs and the Sprint. Oscar and Lando score 0 points. Max wins by 12 points.
* Max finishes P3 in all the remaining GPs and the Sprint. Oscar and Lando score 0 points. Max wins by 2 points.
* Max finishes P2 in one GP and P1 in the remaining races. Lando finishes in P2/P3/P7/P6. Lando still wins.
