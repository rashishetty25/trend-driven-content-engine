The reality? Bigger batteries, more weight, and slower cars.\n\n# Heavier cars, slower racing (just like the SUVs nowadays, a modern BMW SUV is over 2 tonnes...)\n\nTripling the electrical power means you need more energy storage. More storage = heavier batteries.  \nThe FIA says the cars will be “lighter overall,” but that’s mostly wishful thinking. Energy recovery will play a much bigger role, so drivers will be juggling deployment and regen instead of just driving flat out.\n\n**If people want to watch battery management and energy strategy, there’s already Formula E for that.**\n\n# The CO₂ comparison is kind of a joke...\n\nHere’s the thing: an F1 car over an entire race weekend burns roughly **220–250 kg of fuel**, or about **300 liters**.  \nThat’s roughly **700 kg of CO₂** for the whole weekend.\n\nNow compare that to Max Verstappen’s private jet — a Dassault Falcon 8X.  \nOne flight from Europe to Austin for the US GP burns around **12,000 kg of jet fuel** (about **15,000 liters**).  \nThat’s around **36 tons of CO₂** — about **50 times more** than his race car produces in a weekend.\n\n**And that’s one flight. Add up all the private jets, freight planes, and trucks that move the paddock around, and it’s obvious where the real emissions come from. The race fuel itself is barely a rounding error.**\n\n# The “green fuel” part isn’t what it sounds like\n\nSynthetic e-fuels can technically be carbon-neutral, but they take an insane amount of energy to make, and they still release CO₂ when burned.  \nThe only thing that makes them “green” is if the production process uses renewable energy and captured carbon — which is nice in theory but doesn’t make the cars any cleaner in practice.\n\n# So what’s the point?\n\n**The 2026 regs make the cars more complicated, more expensive, and likely slower — all for a “green” headline.**  \n**It doesn’t fix the real environmental footprint of F1, which comes from freight and travel, not what’s burned in the cars.**\n\n  \nAnd more boring races...', ""Why did they strike out Max's eyes?"", 'My thinking as well.

Time to lico for 50 laps."", '****\n**Hamilton confident Ferrari can take ‘step forward’ in Austin as he sets out expectation for final races of 2025**\n\nLewis Hamilton has set out his hopes for what Ferrari can achieve at the United States Grand Prix, a race in which team mate Charles Leclerc took victory in 2024.\n\nLewis Hamilton is hopeful that Ferrari can take a “step forward” by extracting more from their car during the United States Grand Prix weekend, with the seven-time World Champion admitting that the final six races of the campaign could play a key role in preparations for 2026.\n\nHamilton arrives into Round 19 of the season off the back of a P8 finish last time out in Singapore, having originally crossed the line in seventh before being handed a five-second time penalty post-race for exceeding track limits whilst managing a brake issue on his car.\n\nLooking ahead to what might be possible at the Circuit of The Americas – a track where he has previously been victorious on five occasions – Hamilton voiced an optimistic note about Ferrari’s prospects in terms of continuing to make improvements to the SF-25.\n\n“I never have expectations except for that we give it our all and we continue to improve,” the Briton said. “I think there are lots and lots of positives to take from every weekend, and there are lots of areas we can improve.\n\n“We spent time after the last race going through areas that we can improve on, and I really think that this weekend we can take a step forward and extract more from the car that we have.\n\n“We’ve not moved the car forward in terms of performance, but there is more performance in the car that, if we execute a little bit better, I think we can extract more, so that’s the goal.”\n\nWith the 2025 season now entering into its last six rounds – featuring three Sprints along the way, including this weekend at COTA – Hamilton was quizzed on what the approach will be and how the squad will find the answers they are seeking ahead of 2026, a year in which new technical regulations will be introduced into the sport.\n\n“These are ultimately test weekends, really, in terms of just continuing to learn, to improve on our processes,” he explained. “In the last races there have been a couple of gems through the weekend that we couldn’t capitalise on, and so it’s taking those good bits from there and continuing to work on them, to take what works and then change what isn’t [working].\n\n“So that’s what we’re trying to do moving forwards. I think it’s continuing to build on the relationships, continuing to build on communication.\n\n“Ultimately, everyone back at the factory really deserves a good result and that’s the sole focus – to get good results, try to maximise, squeeze every point we can out of our performances on the weekends, and I really, really believe that we can do that, so we just stay focused.”\n****', 'I know the prancing horse on that car just wants to gallop right off it out of shame.', 'Meanwhile Russell has two wins and a shipload of podiums.', 'Everyone has long shifted focus to 2026. I can’t see any teams taking a step forward at this point. Hamilton can be hopeful but I’m sure he knows they are in for a poor remainder of the season.', 'Ferrari should set out their expectations for Lewis more like. \n\nA podiumless season is unacceptable.', 'angry upvote', ""Only 50 laps?

1o8jsg0,Do you think Automotodrom Grobnik would be a good F1 track for a Croatian GP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o8jsg0/do_you_think_automotodrom_grobnik_would_be_a_good/,2025-10-16, Discussion,"Automotodrom Grobnik was once considered for F1, F1 governing body wanted to host races and have a Croatian GP, but the owner was greedy, first demanding more money, then demanding more percentage of the revenue so F1 gave up on trying. 

The track hosted Yugoslavian MotoGP from 1978 to 1990, more recently it was used by Formula 3, hosted NASCAR races from 2019 to 2022 and it still holds Motorcycle races for Alpe Adria International Motorcycle Championship.

It has full facilities, a wide enough pit lane, is really close to a highway and an airport and is regularly maintained. 

Lap record is 1:16.388 by an Austrian formula driver Josef Neuhauser who set the record in 2000 in a Minardi M190 Formula 1 car during the 2000 Rijeka interserie round.

What definitely needs to change for it to be fully viable are runoff areas and barriers, but since F1 already tried to invest into the track and wanted to use it for a Croatian GP I have no doubt that would be sorted if a deal was made.

Unfortunately, I think we'll never see a Croatian GP, but I want to see what you guys think about the track that is 10 minutes by car from my home.","[""not gonna lie, it looks leagues better than the new Street circuits that keep getting added to the calendar.

1o8wcgy,[OC] How media perception differs from on-track reality for McLaren’s drivers for the 2025 season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o8wcgy/oc_how_media_perception_differs_from_ontrack/,2025-10-17, Discussion,"This visual compares the average media ratings (representing perceived driver performance) with the actual race results for McLaren’s drivers, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, across the 2025 season so far.

Do you think McLaren’s perceived favoritism toward Norris is influencing how the media, and by extension the fans, rate him?","['The choice to show averages is weird. That just makes a few extreme results have effect on ""negative media perception"" for the whole year. You can see where the big drops were. So analyze those specifics weekends...', '> if media rating below race position = negative media reception\n\nNo, absolutely not. It just means other drivers mada fewer mistakes in worse cars', 'how do you even read this?', ""Lando's harsh rating at the start of the season was down to the fact he was driving poorly, he had a dominant car and was well below it.\n\nThe ratings are pretty fair and will be well below finishing positions as his car was still incredible.\n\nThat has set the tone for where his average media rating is sitting I'd suspect.\n\nBoth drivers media rating being lower than actual comes down to havig a dominant car, people always say it is more the car than the driver in that instance."", 'Unless Max wins it this season we will get the new weakest champion of 21st century\xa0', ""For me, it's more about how he's fumbling his chances in a dominant car after the way he talked about lewis and max in their dominant cars."", 'Lando’s dad irritates me…I might be allergic to him. When Hulk won and the crowd was happily cheering him on “Hulk, Hulk, Hulk”, Daddy got annoyed and starting chanting “Lando, Lando, Lando” in retort to them. Plus he’s one of England’s most wealthy men. \n\nMaybe some media people feel similar dislike to Lando’s family/privilege and unconsciously form a bias against him in their reporting', ""If the data don't show what you want them to, you fudge the stats like we always do.\xa0"", 'Took me a while, top chart is Oscar, bottom is Lando.\n\nGreen line is their average race finishing position at each stage of the season, red line is average media ranking over the season to each point.\n\nBigger gap means bigger distance between media perception and actual performance.', '""Driving poorly"" and ""well below it"" but somehow still super close to his teammate, who is doing well by all measures, in points, race pace, and qualifying pace\n\nPeople put too much weight on the dominant car thing. Sure McLaren is the best on average. That doesn\'t mean that they are untouchable. Just because Red Bull and Verstappen pulled together a near perfect qualifying lap on a track where overtaking is difficult doesn\'t mean that Lando is bad.']",0,24,0.42,0,20,20,0,24,0.42,0
