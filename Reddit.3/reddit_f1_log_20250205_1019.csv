1ihmjvm,Why the FIA's F1 flexi wing U-turn might backfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ihmjvm/why_the_fias_f1_flexi_wing_uturn_might_backfire/,2025-02-04, News,,"['> Motorsport.com understands the stricter tests were initially planned for the start of the season, but there has been significant lobbying from some teams who had already developed flexi-wings to delay the introduction of the new test, initially until Imola and then until Barcelona.\n\n> Reports that teams, like Red Bull, are surprised or even furious about the changes are believed to be wide of the mark, as these tweaks were the subject of discussion for some time, so teams knew they were coming and had enough time to react.\n\n> But in certain corners, there is still unease over their staggered introduction, with the comprehensive front wing clampdown coming nine races into a 24-race campaign. On the one hand, it allows teams to integrate the FIA\'s intervention into their early season development cycle, with a circuit like Barcelona often the scene of big upgrade packages in the past.\n\n> On the other hand, some smaller teams who haven\'t fully caught on with flexing front wings feel like the delayed change bakes in the advantage of those who are at the forefront of a practice the FIA clearly sees the need to clamp down on. And while not forcing teams to make changes from race one can be seen as a way to help teams by not having them throw away carryover designs, some of those midfielders will actually have fewer changes to make than the likes of McLaren and\xa0[Mercedes](https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/), and therefore would have benefitted more from a clampdown right from the start.\n\n> How much will this affect the teams, and the 2025 title race?\n\n> That depends on who you ask, but one senior team source called the change ""proper"" and was adamant the teams involved - which along with McLaren and Mercedes is also believed to include the likes of Aston Martin and\xa0[Alpine](https://www.motorsport.com/team/alpine/24858/)\xa0\\- will have to make significant changes in order to comply, not just to the front wing but also to the all-important floor as the front wing design impacts anything downstream.\n\nSome interesting bits here from the article that claims Red Bull wasn\'t surprised about the change, while the senior team source they heard from suggests that McLaren, Mercedes, Aston Martin, and Alpine will be the most affected by this. \n\nI do worry that this midseason change could affect the championship, and I just hope if there is any effect caused by this it ends up making the championship closer for multiple teams rather than widening the gap like the midseason TD did in 2022.', 'Honestly they should‚Äôve just either decided on this since mid season (that it won‚Äôt be allowed for ‚Äò25) or if they decided not to, then they should‚Äôve stuck to their decision.
