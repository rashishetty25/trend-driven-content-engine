1kjn12p,Did F1’s Fastest Lap Point Rule Really Affect Strategy? Here's What I Found,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kjn12p/did_f1s_fastest_lap_point_rule_really_affect/,2025-05-10, Discussion,"So, F1 recently got rid of the fastest lap point, claiming it was all about strategy, not pure pace. They said drivers outside the top 10 were ""stealing"" the point, with some even affecting the championship. But is that really true? I decided to dive into the stats and find out if the rule actually made a difference.  
For context, the fastest lap point was introduced in the 2019 season till the 2024 season. When I say before 2019, I mean from 2011 to 2018.  
  
Here's what I found -  

**Before 2019**: The fastest laps were mostly set in the middle of the race. Only about **3% of races** (6 races) saw a driver in the top 10 pit late and grab the fastest lap. The **average laps remaining** when the fastest lap was set? **17.22**.

**After 2019**: Things changed. Fastest laps were set much closer to the end of the race, and it wasn’t just about pace anymore. **23% of races** (27 races) saw top 10 drivers pit late for that point. The **mean laps remaining** when the fastest lap was set dropped to **5.94**.

Here's a slide showing all the instances of drivers outside the top 10 pitting towards the end and setting the fastest lap - 

[Comparison of instances where drivers outside the top 10 secured the fastest lap, before and after the introduction of the fastest lap point in 2019.](https://preview.redd.it/o83j28mtd10f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e83b3163b3addc51b4f3ee9a2fb91ae52061d57e)

  
So, what else did F1 management expect? In close championship battles, teams would always take every advantage they could, whether that meant pitting late for the fastest lap or making strategic moves to “steal” the point. It was clear that the rule wasn’t just about pure pace, and in many cases, it became a tactical tool for those outside the top 10.

F1 scrapping the rule makes sense, but only time will tell if, from this year onward, teams return to the pre-2019 pattern where the fastest lap becomes more of an honorary achievement rather than a strategic goal.

What do you think? Did this rule give too much power to drivers outside the top 10?","[""The problem wasn't drivers outside the top 10, it was that getting fastest lap was more to do with how fast the driver behind you was (and therefore how close). It generally just boiled down to which driver in the top 10 had a pit stop gap behind them in the last 5 laps."", ""What I really like about Zhou's fastest lap at Bahrain 2023 is that it was done to take the point away from Gasly, which means that Sauber thought that they would be competing with Alpine for positions in the WCC. By the end of the year, Alpine had beaten them by 120 to 16..."", 'For chaos: a point for the fastest lap every lap.', ""The straw that broke it was a sister team tactically 'stealing' a point from a driver who was in direct competition with the parent team, wasn't it?\n\n  \nWithout that one Ricciardo fastest lap, I doubt they'd even have changed the rule."", ""Still think they should've switched to a pole position bonus point for GPs. It would serve as effectively the same thing but without the gimmick of some teams stopping for tires to steal it when others don't."", 'One point I would like is extra point for pole', 'Only race it genuinely affected the result, in my opinion, was Silverstone (70th anniversary?) race. Max pitted for fastest lap then Lewis’ tyre exploded and won on three wheels. \n\nIt’s pretty easy to assume Max would have won if not for that.', '>\xa0What do you think? Did this rule give too much power to drivers outside the top 10?\n\n\nI don\'t know about too much power...\n\n\nIt certainly gave teams the ability to tank one drivers race to influence it... Which is a little silly out than straight swap the cars and I feel is bad.\n\n\nIt gave the appearance of red bull exerting undue influence to get Toro Rosso to steal a point. Which is bad. We\'ve all seen allegations suggestions about how RB tells TR to let their drivers through easier etc.\xa0\n\n\nIt\'s also a ridiculous thing when the only driver that goes for FL is P5 with a 30 second gap. It often felt like FL points were a matter of circumstances and not a genuine ""wow he tried hard and got it"". Which I\'d use for a good argument at removing it.\xa0', ""Fastest lap point was pointless to measure real pace order.\xa0As you noted, in quite a few cases it just resulted in a late pitstop for a semi-quali lap. The way it is now still doesn't reflect genuine pure pace given it's all about who has the better tyre management, but at least it gives other insides into it, rather than just showing driver X pitted onto the soft tyres near the end.""]",1508,293,0.96,1508,6312,6312,41,5,0.0,41
