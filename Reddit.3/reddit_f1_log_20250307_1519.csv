The Chinese driver has taken part in 3 seasons in F1 with Sauber, the last of which was completed last year: for the Rossa it represents a good solution to have a driver with some experience behind the scenes on the ground effect cars, while for Zhou it is a chance to remain linked to the paddock of the top series, which he did not want to leave despite offers from other categories.\n\nAlong with Zhou, Antonio Fuoco has also been running, with the Italian driver remaining active on the Cavallino simulator on the F1 front as well because of his qualities and experience, complementing his activities behind the wheel of the 499P Hypercar in the WEC, where he recently scored a splendid victory in the season's opening round in Qatar."", 'Zhou finally driving the real Ferrari.
