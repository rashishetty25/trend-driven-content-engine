This exception will not count as one of the 4 permitted exceptions.          
* There is now a greater clarification to the meaning of yellow flags which is in accordance with and supplementary to Appendix H of the ISC:            
   * Single Waved Yellow Flag: Any driver passing through a waved yellow flag marshalling sector must reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction. In order for the stewards to be satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements they are expected to have braked earlier and/or discernibly reduced speed in the relevant marshalling sector.             
   * Double Waved Yellow Flag: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector must reduce speed significantly and be prepared to change direction or stop. In order for the stewards to be satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements it must be clear that the driver has not attempted to set a meaningful lap time on the relevant lap. Furthermore, during a sprint qualifying or qualifying session, any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector will have that lap time deleted.        
   * Double Waved Yellow Flag during a Safety Car or Virtual Safety Car Period: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector during a safety car or virtual safety car period, in addition to the requirements of b), must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU in each marshalling sector concerned.

1kbhryv,[AMuS] That is why the wind tunnel is so important,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kbhryv/amus_that_is_why_the_wind_tunnel_is_so_important/,2025-04-30, News,,"['Translation and full article:\n\n\n> **Despite computer assistance, the good old wind tunnel is enjoying a renaissance. In the current phase of Formula 1, it is especially important that engineers can rely on the data.**\n\n> Wind tunnels should have disappeared from Formula 1 long ago. On the desired path to carbon neutrality, these massive facilities leave a significant footprint on the energy balance. Just a few years ago, there was discussion in the paddock about a complete ban on this traditional development tool. The proposal found some prominent supporters, including aerodynamics guru Adrian Newey. CFD computer simulations were intended to replace test runs with real models.\n\n> But after taking over the old Force India racing team, Aston Martin suddenly expressed interest in investing heavily in the Silverstone facility. New owner Lawrence Stroll hoped to buy a competitive advantage with a modern wind tunnel. His lobbying efforts with the FIA \u200b\u200bwere successful. Since then, there has been no more talk of a possible ban.\n\n> The groundbreaking ceremony for the new factory in Silverstone took place in September 2021. After several construction delays, the new wind tunnel has been online since mid-March. ""We\'re using it for both the 2025 car and for development for 2026. We should see the first parts from the new facility on the track soon,"" reveals team principal Andy Cowell.\n\n> **Moving with obstacles.**\nPreviously, the racing team had rented space at the Mercedes wind tunnel in Brackley for many years. The engineers can now save themselves the half-hour drive. However, according to Cowell, the transition wasn\'t entirely smooth: ""I like to compare it to two watches that show different times. How do you know which wind tunnel is producing the right results? Unfortunately, if you test the same parts in both facilities, you never get exactly the same results.""\n\n> In the future, you\'ll have to be able to rely entirely on your own tools. The team boss is convinced of the benefits of the investment: ""Our eyes have already been opened to certain characteristics of the car. We now have a clearer view. But we\'re still in the learning process.""\n\n> The two Red Bull teams, however, are still eagerly awaiting the completion of their new wind tunnel. The facility should have been completed long ago. But there were delays even during the planning phase. Newey waited until the last moment to see if the aforementioned ban campaign would be successful. Financing the new building within the company also took time. In 2023, the construction site near the factory in Milton Keynes was also changed.\n\n> Recently, however, completion has progressed rapidly. Team principal Christian Horner proudly reported that they are three months ahead of the original schedule. Those in charge hope to be able to move in during the 2026 season. However, the results on the car won\'t be seen until the 2027 season.\n\n> **Relic from the Cold War.**\nUntil then, Max Verstappen\'s team will have to make do with the old facility in Bedford. The building complex at the former Thurleigh military airfield was built in 1947, initially for aircraft aerodynamic testing. Over the years, the technology has undergone repeated modifications and upgrades to meet the specific requirements of motorsport.\n\n> Jaguar originally purchased the facility from Arrows. With the team\'s takeover, the wind tunnel became Red Bull\'s property in 2004. Horner likes to disparagingly refer to it as a ""relic of the Cold War."" While the technology inside is state-of-the-art, the exterior concrete walls unfortunately couldn\'t be modernized so easily. This has caught the engineers off guard several times.\n\n> The problem lies in the poor insulation against external temperature influences. This is especially noticeable at the end of a regulatory cycle when only minor details are at stake and reliable results are required. The Red Bull wind tunnel has too much tolerance in this regard.\n\n> ""We\'re very dependent on the weather. Depending on whether it\'s hot or cold outside, there are huge fluctuations,"" complains Chief Technology Officer Pierre Wach√©. When developing entirely new concepts, the disadvantage isn\'t quite as great. ""But when the development curve flattens out at some point, we have problems with the precision and reproducibility of the data.""\n\n> According to Horner, the system in its current form is no longer competitive: ""It was good enough to produce some fantastic cars over the years. But we can no longer conduct tests at temperatures below five degrees Celsius. And when it gets above 25 degrees Celsius, the results are unstable. Upgrade parts today rarely add more than three points of downforce. Unfortunately, half of that remains hidden in the measurement inaccuracy of our wind tunnel.""\n\n> **McLaren\'s wind tunnel helps with high-altitude flight.**\nMcLaren is already reaping the benefits of its own investments. The current upward trend is certainly also a result of the wind tunnel conversion in Woking, which will be completed in autumn 2023. Previously, technicians had to fly to Cologne for 13 years to conduct aerodynamic test runs at the Toyota development center. The decision was made under former team boss Andreas Seidl to expand the facility to accommodate models in the maximum permitted 60 percent format. A wealth of modern measuring technology was installed for this purpose.\n\n> After a year and a half with the renovated wind tunnel, it\'s safe to say the investment was worth it. The development curve was steeper than any other team. The correlation with reality is good. No team has a better success rate. ""A new facility and a lot of time in the wind tunnel alone aren\'t enough to be successful. You also need the right ideas to test. Fortunately, we chose a development direction from the beginning that had a lot of potential,"" says team principal Andrea Stella, praising his aerodynamicists.\n\n> Toyota, incidentally, was able to quickly find a new tenant for its own wind tunnel. Cadillac engineers have been regular guests in Cologne since 2024. As long as the eleventh Formula 1 team wasn\'t officially registered, the technicians were still allowed to test without the restrictions applicable to all other teams. For a long time, however, the tests were like groping in the dark. The first version of the technical regulations for 2026 was not published until mid-2024. In the months that followed, there were repeated adjustments. To this day, not all details have been clarified.\n\n> Team principal Graeme Lowdon explains the biggest problem for the aerodynamicists: ""We\'ve been in the wind tunnel with the 2026 model the longest, but we can\'t verify how well the data correlates. We don\'t have a car on the racetrack with which we can repeatedly compare our results."" The Briton dismisses rival claims that Cadillac has a huge advantage with the jump start: ""I\'m offering all other teams the opportunity to swap their current development status with our data. I\'m sure no one would accept that deal.""', 'Because the wind goes through a tunnel.\n\n  \n\\-Bill Wuxton', '> , there was discussion in the paddock about a complete ban on this traditional development tool. The proposal found some prominent supporters, including aerodynamics guru Adrian Newey. \n\nJust because he has his own wind tunnel in his head.', 'Because it is.', ""I wonder if it wouldn't be cheaper and better for everybody to have a large straight line testing allowance, with electric power only or whatever, instead of those huge investments in wind tunnels."", 'Thanks for the translation.', 'Dude really kept red bull from investing into a new wind tunnel before the cap just to join a team that built one ready 2 years ealier than red bull‚Äòs', ""[He's the last airbender after all](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fu9U4hfWYAAD4Sb.jpg). That's why they can't ban wind tunnels, too much of an advantage."", ""They will be cheaper but they won't give you continuous real time flow visualizations like in a windtunnel and there is also changing ambient conditions and also you can't collect all the data points like you would in a windtunnel as you be limited to the no of rakes you put on the car""]",40,11,0.88,40,10,10,7,0,0.040000000000000036,7
