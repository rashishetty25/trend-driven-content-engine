So instead the GPDA should issue a statement that says ‘If anyone is punished based on these ridiculous rules this year, we guarantee that NONE of us will race in 2026’. 

What, they’re going to risk the first season of their new regulations being made up of reserve drivers and F2 drivers? No one would buy tickets to next years’ races, and We all know F1 is about the bottom line. 

Realistically, I know there are contracts in place that make this difficult, but I’ve got to imagine that the teams stand behind the drivers more than the FIA. 

Even just say Max and Lewis doing it could be enough. Nevermind if Charles/Lando/George join in.

The drivers hold more power in F1 than FIA because people pay to see the drivers race, to hear their thoughts, see their personalities etc… not see what ridiculous rules the FIA can come up with next. The drivers can shut this whole thing down. 

I hope they flex the power they have. 

Edit: this isn’t about the swearing itself. It’s about how the FIA under MBS is overreaching and being controlling in a way that can only be detrimental to the sport over completely ridiculous things. 

They haven’t said that this only applies to press conferences. They are mic’d up and surrounded by people all the time, and their sport is subject to a ton of adrenaline. Are they going to get penalized if someone crashes into them at 350 kph and they go into the barriers and end their race and they say ‘shit’ over the radio? No guidance. Is it possible that the difference between someone being WDC and not will be the fact that they ‘took a knee’ to protest over something important to them? 

MBS decided to freak out over one swearing incident, they punished Max, ALL of the drivers (whether they swear or not) recognized this was too much, disagreed and submitted a statement about this. This is just the FIA trying to scare them into subservience over this and any future issues.

1iads2c,With redbull losing Honda and Newey does that open the door to Ferrari and McLaren?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iads2c/with_redbull_losing_honda_and_newey_does_that/,2025-01-26, Discussion,"I think redbuls dominance as much as Max is hood, it was due to Honda. Yes they take over the Honda power train and become a constructor, but they lost the expertise of newey. As a new constructor I just think they are at a loss losing newey to aston.

With Aston in early 2024 showing they are up there, with newetu it may make Alondo thst much more competitive  as the car takes leaps and bounds to be a winning car that's to jewery.

Am im giving too much credit newey? Is he not actually that good?

Anyway I think redbull is on the decline. Max maybe a tops driver, but I think the 2025 car will struggle against McLaren and Ferrari due to the inexperience of being a new constructor and the lise of newery. Max's work is cut out for him, tho Liam will be a good now driver so might help Max  dive some, take out threats? As Liam knows his place and would want to keep his RB seat?

The 2025 season maybe epic... teams seem to be on equal footing as they lose and gain expertise.

The lol will be id Newey designs a car that puts Lance on the podium more often than not.

He’s an amazing engineer and no doubt contributed massively to Red Bulls success but it’s not like he’s been successful during every stint at a manufacturer or major rule change. He had the foresight that not many others had in terms of the ground effect but let’s not forget Ferrari also produced a car that whilst porpoised managed to perform well in that initial rule change.\n\nHe also started to take a backseat at Red Bull in a more consultant type role.\n\nAston Martin haven’t looked good since 2023, he’s got a massive job getting them up the field. \n\nMax extracted everything and more from last years red bull, so much so that his teammate often failed to make Q3 which shows how bad the car was.', ""Honda wasn't the reason, it was that ground effect cars have been used since 2022, for which Newey just happened to have written the textbooks.\n\nPredictions are of course difficult, but if you believe internal sources at Red Bull, Newey's role was actually no longer so big, which Horner also emphasized, but the main work actually lies with Pierre Wache.\nThe car has had a very small working window since 2022 with a high weakness in slow corners (see Singapore 2023). As soon as other teams put pressure on the car, it increasingly slips out of the working window and has to make difficult compromises. It will depend on all three teams how this season goes.
