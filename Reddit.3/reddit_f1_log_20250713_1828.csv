1lyb8mf,An unexpected upgrade has transformed F1's midfield fight,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lyb8mf/an_unexpected_upgrade_has_transformed_f1s/,2025-07-12, Technical,,"['For me, as well as stabilising the car it looks as though they have some of the best tyre management on the grid now', 'Sorry for having to repost this. \n\nI broke the rule that did not allow editorializing the title when posting an article, and the original post was duly removed. I also got a 10 second penalty.', 'A car built for combat!', 'Well their strategy team still has to learn a lot. Even in last race they screwed Nico’s strategy multiple times if it wasn’t for Nico standing strong and making right calls the story would’ve been quite different especially since Gabi was out.', 'Is this the real APX GP 😱😱', 'Now what Sauber need is improve their strategy department. See what happened to Bortoleto in Silverstone.', 'Plan C for Combat', '> Sauber sporting director Inaki Rueda\n\nAnyone know if he is related to Fran Rueda, the LMGT3 Mercedes #60 driver?', ""They've got that Combat upgrade"", ""I think we may be SLIGHTLY overreacting to the Hulk P3.\n\nSauber has improved over the season, absolutely. That's proven by Gabi's improved qualifying and overall performance. But Hulk's P3 doesn't suddenly mean this car is top of the midfield like I've seen some people try to claim (perhaps not this article). It was a wet race where certain teams made dumbass strategy choices (Ferrari/Leclerc, Red Bull, Mercedes) and Hulkenberg is excellent enough of a driver to have capitalised on that. This race didn't necessarily need the fastest car.\n\nThat said, I don't want to come off like I'm downplaying Hulkenberg. He drove amazing, and when I say the race didn't need the fastest car; that doesn't mean P3 in a Sauber ISN'T impressive. This would not have happened in the Sauber of years before. My stance is that they're finally competitive with the midfielders, which can not be said about the Bottas+Zhou era sadly (they deserved better). But they'll still need a bit of luck to get the car into the points on any consistent basis, wherein I feel Williams/VCARB can get there on the car's merit.\n\nMy opinion remains that Williams is probably the fastest car on raw pace (but clearly unreliable as hell at the moment), but VCARB is perhaps not quite as fast, but while having very few technical issues. The only one I remember was Hadjar's balls being strangled. But the fact they've got two rookie drivers and are doing as well as they are means their car has gotta be somewhat solid. After that, it's kinda hard. Aston Martin have flashes of pace especially with Alonso in qualifying, but the car drops like a rock in so many of the actual races. Hulkenberg is able to pull off excellence in his car,  but I think Gabi's performance tells a bit of a different story over the season considering how amazing he was in F2. Alpine is dead last - Gasly can pull magic out of nowhere, but that car is horrific. It's like Red Bull if Red Bull was never actually good.""]",917,80,0.97,917,2620,2620,20,1,0.0,20

The article said something along the lines that Red Bull chased theoretical numbers thinking Max could drive it and in doing so created a car that can\'t be driven to it\'s potential by anyone. It\'s why everyone keeps saying the ""window of operation"" is so incredibly small. No one can live in that small window 100% of the time like a computer running a simulation.', 'What does he mean that things were different for him than they were for Alex and Checo?', ""I dunno; I think Alex and Pierre were not (then) nearly as good as Max was. The car was decent, but in Max's hands it was great, in theirs in was ok, but that difference was large. \n\nLately, the car is terrible, and Max is able to make it work sometimes (due to his skill and his long experience with he development of the car).
