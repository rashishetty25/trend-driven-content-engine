1lje4ws,Ferrari: The first update to react to problems,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lje4ws/ferrari_the_first_update_to_react_to_problems/,2025-06-24, News,,"['Remove slow add fast', ""Translation \n\nFerrari is in a climate of media attention both on a technical and sporting level. The environment in Maranello is underpressure on the upper floors, with the post Canada that has put in the eye of the media attention Fred Vasseur of which it is not yet his near future within the walls of Via Abetone Inferiore. The Austrian Grand Prix next Sunday marks the return to Europe that leads to the summer break in a series of crucial events to be able to give a second part of the season growing after a dramatic first half, sportingly and technically.\n\n\nFirst block of updates in Styria: at the Red Bull Ring the new floor designed after the inconsistencies revealed in Australia. That‚Äôs why calling it ‚Äúminor upgrade‚Äù is an error, a fundamental macrocomponent with all the limits of the mechanics from which it is difficult to extract further load at the end of the regulatory cycle.\n\nSince the pre-season tests, the SF-25 has shown its limits, that is, those of a single-seater unable to operate in an operating window in which it can take advantage of the aerodynamic load. An unexpected, serious handicap, of which has now been talked about and re-discussed since the first race in Australia. Precisely the difficulties that emerged in Melbourne forced the engineers led by Diego Tondi and Loic Serra to review the initial development plans from virtually zero. The upcoming update at the Red Bull Ring is thus the first, true, attempt to complete the deep correction of the SF-25 project after months of work within the walls of Maranello, between technical meetings and choices on the budget to be allocated.\n\nIn Austria, however, a floor will debut, however, not definable as a simple ‚Äúrefinement‚Äù. Sudden miracles are difficult to expect them but in Austria, a short track, where a very compact group is expected, even a minimum gain will be fundamental especially on Saturdays. The new floor was deliberated some time ago after its natural tunnel development. Bringing the ‚Äúhealing parts‚Äù to the track was in fact possible before June: in Canada, for logistical and tuning issues, it was not concretely possible to bring new parts, so much so that, the new component was initially designed for Silverstone, a track that will be a bit ‚Äòfor all the grid of important news. His early arrival of a race represents ‚Äúan effort‚Äù of the technical department to speed up the recovery process.\n\n\nThe reason why the upgrade comes so late is tied to the time it took to understand and correct the conceptual errors highlighted in the first races. Serra and Tondi had to work behind the scenes to set up a new technical direction, more ‚Äúconservative‚Äù but functional to the initial ambitions. The delay in bringing developments was also an obligatory choice: children of past mistakes, these cars require you to stop, understand, and intervene with criteria.\n\n\nHamilton gave his support to Vasseur but wanted to abandon 2025 to give everything to 2026. A drastic change of course is not in the Ferrari style with the head of the GeS who reiterates an unexpressed potential. The numbers wouldn't blame him. Realistically, who will be right?\n\nIn this complicated context, Lewis Hamilton also has had doubts about the solidity of the SF-25 project, so much so that he considered himself to distance himself from a project with which difficulties have emerged for adaptation, as well as for technical limits. The seven-time world champion, who arrived in Maranello with high expectations, was faced with an unpredictable and difficult to interpret car. However, it was precisely the belief ‚Äî Vasseur reiterated several times ‚Äî that the potential of the machine was real, even if unexpressed.\n\n\nThe main limits have been identified in the rear suspension, unable to offer consistency to downforce and stability, limiting Lewis‚Äô style above all. Only in rare conditions, the SF-25 managed to express itself at its best. Despite everything, Ferrari, by his own philosophy, rejects the idea of throwing the entire season at the nettles: after the Monaco GP, the realistic goal has become the second place in the constructors‚Äô championship and some victories to be won with determination, to close 2025 with dignity. Hamilton gave his support to Fred but it is clear that the Englishman aims at 2026 to return to express himself at the levels he expected with a car that also follows his needs.\nIn Fiorano the SF-25 adapted to the 2026 tyres was with the front wing that will be at Monza in September.\n\nIt is not emblematic that the SF-25 has not been in the wind tunnel since mid-June: its space has been officially sold to the 678 project, the 2026 car that will have to be born under the new technical regulations. This signal highlights that in Ferrari, as mentioned, there has been no change of programming on the timing compared to that established in January, with the knowledge that the current season will still be long, even if compromised in substance. 2025, except for sensational surprises, will be remembered as a year of transition (yet another) and, perhaps, of reconstruction.\n\nMeanwhile, Ferrari also returned to the track in Fiorano for a Pirelli test session dedicated to the wet tyres of 2026. The SF-25 has turned in mule car configuration, but with the interesting unloading configuration to simulate the lower load of the next cars: Zhou and Leclerc have turned the front wing version, characterized by extremely exhausted profiles, designed for the low load that, from the confirmed collections, will be present Monza. The exhaust profiles were combined with the updated structure and the updated drifts after Spain."", ""This translation doesn't sound great but I hope this upgrade package works. Seems like this is the make it or break it point for the year. I don't think we're winning a championship at this point but it would be nice to see Lewis and Charles fighting for wins occasionally. All teams should be focusing on next year's car soon so this seems like the last shot at getting back in the mix."", ""So new floor in Austria... what about suspension? Wasn't that rumoured for Silverstone or is that no longer the case."", 'Ahhh Yes perfect time to also test out a rookie driver. \n\nRookie will be in Charles‚Äô car - money is on they bolt the floor to his and a minor accident either ruins or offers them no real feedback until fp2 which will probably red flag earlier on and Charles will get no long runs in. \n\nThis is the Ferrari way - I‚Äôm tired.', 'Next race‚Ñ¢', 'I fear Ferrari is going to be reason Lewis‚Äô Silverstone podium streak ends, unfortunately.', 'This weekend: \nCharles-my suspension feels bad\nFerrari engineer-must be the suspension', 'The updates before were developed in order to create problems']",281,35,0.95,281,602,602,2,1,0.0,2

1lk6l2q,[AMuS] How Cadillac is preparing for entry,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk6l2q/amus_how_cadillac_is_preparing_for_entry/,2025-06-25, News,,"['Audi and Cadillac occupying 19-22 grid spots at Melbourne 2026', 'Are they building their car for combat?', 'Translation and full article: \n\n> **The clock is ticking for Cadillac. The new Formula 1 racing team is mobilizing on all fronts. The US team is growing. The engineers are developing the 2026 car, and the race crew is preparing for front-line action in the tactics room. We\'ll keep you updated on the latest developments.**\n\n> Cadillac has to face one question again and again: Why so early? Why is the American automaker launching its car in 2026 and not a year later? Why is General Motors launching its own engine in 2029 when it could wait until 2031, when the regulations might stipulate less complex drive systems?\n\n> The answer to the question is simple. Formula 1 wanted it that way. It\'s clearly a bit of a dig at the Americans, after the approval process cost so much energy. It\'s based on the motto: If they really want to be there, they should do it as soon as possible with the start of the new Concorde agreement.\n\n> Time pressure is the biggest problem for the newcomer. Cadillac only received the final approval from the FIA \u200b\u200bon March 7. Now, in almost exactly twelve months, a team must be built, the necessary infrastructure created, the processes synchronized, and a car developed and produced. That\'s an extremely tight deadline.\n\n> **First car is built in England.**\nAs of May, the Silverstone branch had 300 employees on the payroll. By the end of the year, that number is expected to rise to 500 to 600. It doesn\'t help that Audi is seeking the same specialists from the same catchment area for its Bicester branch. It\'s also a problem that poachers from other teams have work bans and won\'t be available until the fall.\n\n> General Motors currently employs around 100 people at its engine factory in Charlotte. This number will also have to expand rapidly, as three years of development time for such a complex powertrain passes in the blink of an eye. Russ O\'Blenes\' team can\'t build on past experience. Therefore, Cadillac engineers stepped on the gas with the prototype of the V6 turbo. The first example was already tested on the test bench the week after the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\n\n> The Cadillac F1 Team\'s new headquarters in Fishers near Indianapolis is scheduled to be operational by the second quarter of 2026 at the latest. To align the tight schedule with the factory\'s completion, the following master plan was established: The 2026 car will be built entirely in England, the 2027 car half in England and half in the USA, and from 2028 onwards, production will take place entirely at the headquarters in Fishers.\n\n> **Weight as a joker for Cadillac?**\nFor Cadillac, the 2026 Formula 1 season has already begun. All stress and crash tests have already been conducted on a test monocoque. The findings will then be incorporated into the carbon fiber tube that will form the basis of the 2026 car. Technical advisor Pat Symonds reveals that they plan to have most components ready two months earlier than usual to avoid taking any risks. Participation in the first test in January 2026 is mandatory for the newcomer. Every kilometer of experience counts.\n\n> The easiest way to gain ground against the established teams would be weight. Lowering the minimum weight to 770 kilograms opens up a third area, alongside aerodynamics and engine power, where you can differentiate yourself from your opponents. Hardly anyone will make the weight limit in the first year. Every kilogram less guarantees a better lap time.\n\n> The Ferrari engine is a constant. Compared to aerodynamics, weight seems like a more manageable area. But Symonds warns against underestimating it. ""As a newcomer, we have no reference point when it comes to weight. The established teams know how far they can go with every component because they\'ve done it hundreds of times before.""\n\n> **Problem with short-term rule changes.**\nAs with all other teams, the aerodynamic development is expected to be a precision landing. They\'re taking enough time to ensure the components are just ready for the first test and the season opener on March 8. Last-minute rule changes hit a new team harder than the well-established technical teams.\n\n> For example, this spring, the FIA \u200b\u200breduced the size of a fin in the lower section of the rear brake vents. A small change with a big impact. The fin helped seal the underbody between the rear wheel and the floorboard. To compensate, the ground clearance must be lowered again.\n\n> This means new wind tunnel test runs and new computational models for CFD simulation. Small teams with limited simulation tools are more severely affected by such short-term changes in direction than teams with 400 engineers and a fully equipped infrastructure. The lack of experience continues in other areas. The greatest need for improvement lies in aerodynamic elasticity ‚Äì the keyword being flexi-wings ‚Äì and the issue of how to control tire temperature via brake ventilation.\n\n> **Cadillac drives along in the factory.**\nIn parallel with the car\'s construction, Cadillac is working on its processes. Since the Spanish Grand Prix, a team of strategists has been based at the Silverstone factory, virtually driving through each race as if they were actually there. This is designed to refine the strategy programs and prepare the people at the control center for their tasks.\n\n> This fall, Cadillac plans to borrow a 2023 car from Ferrari and simulate races as part of TPC testing. This will allow the racing team to prepare for the future task and the mechanics to practice tire changes in real-life conditions.\n\n> The driver question is expected to be resolved this summer. Two experienced drivers are on the wish list. Nationality is not important for now. An American driver is no longer a requirement. General Motors has decided that performance is the priority. Only then will the goal of being a truly American team come into play.', '‚ÄúSince the Spanish Grand Prix, a team of strategists has been based at the Silverstone factory, virtually driving through each race as if they were actually there.‚Äù\xa0\n\nThats really cool.\n\n‚ÄúThe driver question is expected to be resolved this summer.

And the main thing they need is experience on how to set up a car and getting two drivers who are not just experienced but have won every constructors championship from 2017-2023 between them is great for Cadillac.', ""Does anyone know what kind of relationship they'll have with Ferrari for those first few years? Is it just the PU or will it be closer to a HAAS type of thing?

We explain what it\'s all about and why it could help Norris in his World Championship battle.**\n\n> It was time to find a distraction. Just one day after the Canadian Grand Prix (June 15), Lando Norris, like many of his Formula 1 colleagues, traveled to New York for the premiere of the blockbuster ""F1."" There, the Englishman quickly regained his smile. On race day, things were different. On lap 66, the McLaren driver launched an attack on his teammate Oscar Piastri. The two drivers battled through several corners before Norris decided to overtake Piastri on the inside straight. There was no room, however, and Norris crashed into the rear of his teammate, slammed into the concrete wall, and was out.\n\n> With his head bowed, the 25-year-old trudged back to the pits. Norris took full responsibility for the crash and immediately apologized to his team and to Piastri. Piastri was fortunate in his misfortune and was able to finish the race unscathed in fourth place. Thanks to the twelve points for fourth place and Norris\'s zero, the gap in the World Championship standings has grown to 22 points. A bitter setback for Norris\'s ambitions.\n\n> Last year\'s runner-up in the world championship had entered the 2025 Formula 1 season as one of the top favorites for the title. His opening victory in Melbourne in mid-March seemed to confirm the experts\' assumptions. However, the Briton subsequently lost his rhythm. Piastri raced from success to success. The reasons for this lay partly in Norris\'s inconsistency and partly in his complaints about the handling of his McLaren. Since the start of the season, the Briton has justified himself by saying that he needed to adapt to the new car. The MCL39, he said, did not suit his natural driving style. The car was difficult to drive and did not give him the desired feedback. Such statements were not heard from Piastri.\n\n> **New front axle = new hope.**\nThe engineers at the storied Woking team listened to their driver. In Canada, they introduced a new front axle for the tenth race of the year. Team principal Andrea Stella explained: ""The new front suspension is designed to give our drivers more feel. We\'ve made minor changes to the geometry ‚Äì nothing dramatic."" Only Norris used the new design. Piastri opted for the older version. ""The changes are so minimal, it\'s difficult for the drivers to determine their effect. That\'s only possible once we\'ve done a back-to-back comparison,"" Stella explained the next steps.\n\n> This is now scheduled for Spielberg (June 29). Norris, in particular, is hoping for a positive effect. However, he will have to hand over his MCL39 to junior driver Alex Dunne in the first practice session. Oscar Piastri will likely also evaluate the new front axle there and then decide whether to use it as well. ""There were no negative surprises with Lando; he felt comfortable with it,"" Stella said happily.\n\n> **Norris pace convincing.**\nHis prot√©g√© showed the first positive signs in the Montreal practice sessions. Norris was fast from the start and handled the race better than his teammate ‚Äì right up until qualifying. In the third segment, the man from Bristol made two mistakes that dropped him to seventh place. But his pace was right: ""Compared to Oscar, Lando was competitive from the start. For us, that means the experiment with the front suspension was a success for him.""\n\n> Piastri remained flawless and secured third place on the grid in qualifying. In the race, Norris was again the faster driver. With good pace, he was able to close the gap to Piastri towards the end of the race. Despite the crash, this should give him a boost for the upcoming races. But what\'s next for McLaren? ""Both could continue to use different suspensions. It\'s up to the drivers to decide which specification they feel more comfortable with,"" said Stella in Canada.\n\n> This may be a small advantage for Norris in the World Championship battle. The new front axle could boost his confidence, which has been dented after the crash and the season\'s mixed fortunes. Furthermore, the knowledge of a supposed technical advantage over Piastri would give him a mental boost. The trick is just translating that into results on the track. That\'s been a problem recently, not just in Canada. The next chance to turn things around in the World Championship battle awaits in Spielberg.', ""World cup you say ?\n\n*It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, F1's coming home*\n\n\\- Lando, probably"", ""It seemed like the first time this year that Norris had a race pace advantage over Piastri, but it also showed that the car isn't the problem but the driver as he was not able to use that to it's full potential in quali nor in the race and left with nothing."", 'so why is a general mclaren update norris‚Äòs great hope but not piastris who is even in the lead. could it be biased?', 'Ive also heard people say their non dominant weekend at canada was because of the flexi wings td so quite contradictory media articles', ""I mean, Lando's only 26?
