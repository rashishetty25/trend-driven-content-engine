So the problems from last season are still the problems this season."", 'Translation and full article:\n\n> McLaren continued its upward trend on Friday\'s practice session at Suzuka. The papaya-shaped racers once again set the pace. Their biggest rival is Mercedes. Red Bull, on the other hand, continues to struggle with its car. We\'ve compiled the key findings in our analysis.\n\n> Four red flags in the second practice session cost the teams 38 minutes of track time. The long runs also fell victim to the interruptions. And on the fast laps between accidents and grass fires, much depended on how the drivers navigated traffic and completed their preparation laps.\n\n> The picture is somewhat distorted. The morning\'s long runs had to compensate for the missed race simulations in the afternoon. The picture is relatively clear here. McLaren is also setting the tone in Suzuka. Mercedes and Ferrari are following. Red Bull is still in deep trouble. The white-painted cars were completely out of balance.\n\n> Neither the base setup, for which the engineers had high hopes, nor the setup adjustments made in the afternoon worked. However, the sister cars from Toro Rosso once again showed strong early form. This is still impressive considering that Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson had increased their engine power for their fast laps.\n\n> Although Nico H√ºlkenberg had the best long run on paper on the medium tires, the Sauber driver was running on less fuel than the top teams and only completed four laps. ""The car felt decent, was better in the second practice session than in the first,"" H√ºlkenberg reflected. Both Sauber cars were equipped with the new underbody and rear wings in the afternoon.\n\n> **Is McLaren superior again?** Both fastest times on Friday went to a McLaren driver. In the first session, Lando Norris had the edge. His lead over George Russell was 0.163 seconds. In the afternoon, teammate Oscar Piastri set the pace. The Australian beat Norris by 0.049 seconds and Isack Hadjar by 0.404 seconds. The internal duel between the McLaren drivers was decided in the chicane. Whoever made the cleanest passage there had the fastest time.\n\n> The Papaya racers\' dominance continued in the long runs. Norris averaged a time of 1:33.361 minutes over seven laps, making him one and a half tenths faster than Russell, who, however, also completed three laps longer. The McLarens again showed remarkable performance in maintaining their lap times almost consistently, while their rivals began to experience noticeable tire degradation as the distance increased.\n\n> **Does Mercedes have a chance of winning?** Mercedes is the second-best team. George Russell felt comfortable right away and maintained his high level throughout the day. Even taking into account Mercedes\' usual early form on green tracks on Friday, Russell is the first challenger to McLaren. This is also underscored by the second-best long run in the first practice session.\n\n> The Englishman calls it a positive day and predicts: ""If everything goes well, we can finish on the front two rows."" Suzuka rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli is still lagging behind. The Italian lost more than a second to his team captain in both practice sessions. This shows that Suzuka is a track that\'s not easy to learn in a flash. Antonelli admitted: ""I didn\'t get the most out of the car in the first sector. George showed what\'s possible.""\n\n> Ferrari was just behind Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton beat his former teammate Russell by 23 thousandths of a second. In the endurance test, however, the Silver Arrows were faster. Russell averaged 1:33.489 minutes over ten laps. Charles Leclerc completed eight laps and achieved an average time of 1:33.566 minutes.\n\n> **How does Tsunoda fare against Verstappen?** In the first practice session, Yuki Tsunoda lost just 0.107 seconds to Max Verstappen. The world champion had to overtake six cars on his fastest lap, which reportedly cost him around three-tenths of a second. In the afternoon, the lap times were not comparable. Verstappen drove on soft tires, while Tsunoda stuck with the medium. Nevertheless, Tsunoda performed significantly better than Liam Lawson or even Sergio Perez last year.\n\n> What is worrying, however, is the overall shape of the Red Bull RB21. The car alternates between understeer and oversteer. Verstappen reported on the radio that it felt as if the car was bending. The Red Bull\'s severe sliding accelerated tire wear.\n\n(1/2)', '>Sporting director Helmut Marko was annoyed: ""Whenever the simulator cheers, the basic setup on the track isn\'t right. We should review our processes in the simulator.\n\n2019 and 2020 again for Red Bull Racing, lmao.', 'If Max‚Äôs manager is not in Japan, I can put my tinfoil hat on and come up with a theory.', 'In before Max P3', ""Verstappen ain't winning the championship this year.

1jr6xff,Is it justified if Alpine get rid of Doohan early?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jr6xff/is_it_justified_if_alpine_get_rid_of_doohan_early/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"So going into the season there were a lot of rumours that Alpine would replace Doohan after about five races. And those rumours were fuelled by Alpine signing Colapinto and 3 other reserve drivers. They also never publicly said that Doohan would stay even if he performed well.

Many fans, understandably, were outraged and felt for Jack. He had barely driven an F1 car and there were already rumours that he would be out the door after the flyaway races that kickstart the season. 
His crash this morning have sparked more even discussions about this and I've seen people discussing weather Alpine should replace him. 

So let's go through his season so far and see what we make of it. 

In testing, Doohan performed well enough. He was close enough to Gasly and actually set a faster time on day 2. 

In Australia it actually got off to a decent start and thoigh he went out in Q2 there was a feeling he had the pace to go faster but was impeded by yellow flags after the Hamilton spin. 
So He would start P14, 5 places off Gasly. 

However come race day it was all over in 5 corners after he spun off as they left sector one on the opening lap. Many other drivers did crash that day so you have to give him some forgiveness but I feel as though this video https://youtu.be/d_6DFoHWBC0 shows the difference between a good talent and a great talent. 

In China Alpine seemed hardest hit by the new rear wing directive and Doohan was P16 in SQ1. But he was ahead of Gasly which went a little under the radar but was very impressive. 
 
The sprint itself though, was a bad one for Jack. While Gasly worked his way up to P12, Doohan spent the  whole race battling with the Sauber's before making a silly lunge down the inside on tub last lap and crashing into Bortoleto, spinning him around. For this Doohan got a penalty that didn't change his P20. 

In the main qualifying session he was out in Q1 in P18. To be fair, he was only a tenth off Gasly. 

And for the first time we got to see his comparison to Gasly over a race distance and... it was fairly impressive. On lap 33 he was only a few seconds off Gasly. From then on he was battling with the late stoppers Bearman and Stroll as well as the two stoppers of the Racing Bulls. 

They had much fresher tyres but Doohan fought hard, though he picked up a penalty for forcing Hadjar off. He still held Hadjar off for the remainder of the race but the penalty dropped him a couple of places. But finishing ten seconds off of am experienced midfield driver like Gasly in his first race distance is actually pretty commendable and why I think he should be given a bit longer. 

Yes his crash today was big, and the main argument for replacikg him is that crashes like the ones he's having will cost the team valuable momey they could use for development in this era of the cost cap. 

But if Doohan stops crashing so much and just cuts out the small errors I think he deserves to stay because he does have that raw speed in him. He has outqualified Gasly in one out of three quails and gotten close in the other two. Gasly is one of the stronger qualifiers on the grid and it's no mean feat to be that close. 

Admittedly Australia and China are two of Gasly's worst tracks but if we get to Bahrain and the gap is still small then Doohan deserves the time. Also Doohan isnt that familiar with these tracks either. When we get to more of the circuits he drove in F3 and F2 let's see what he can do. 

In F1 what often seperates rookies is their raw pace. A driver like a young Max Verstappen who is fast but crahses a lot is actually much more impressive than a rookie driver like Sergey Sirotkin, who doenst really crash, but also doenst show any speed. 

I think the reason Jack is crashing is all the pressure Alpine have put him under to perform or get fired. He's pushing the car too much amd crashing due to that. If he continues to have an incident per race yes he should be home by the summer but I think he has shown enough raw pace to be kept on until at least the summer break and if he is very good at the tracks he's more familiar with he should be kept on for 2026. 

TLDR - He's shown enough raw pace to deserve to keep his seat.

But I think he'll get it out of his system: he's a rookie.\n\nThat said, Alpine and Briatore could literally do anything and nobody would be surprised.

There's been a lot of talk about what is expected of Yuki as to how close he needs to get to Max, but how much would be upset if he beats him by a couple of tenths or destroys him by half a second or more? Liam's career would be over. Perez apologists would have to quieten down. Horner pressure dies down. Max loses negotiation power and ends up retiring. And so on, this is the little domino from the meme could end with something strange like Ferrari doing a great strategy or Alonso WDC in the Red Bull.

Edit: I have no preferences for either scenario, just think there are (somewhat unlikely) things that haven't been talked about and wondered what people's thought were.
