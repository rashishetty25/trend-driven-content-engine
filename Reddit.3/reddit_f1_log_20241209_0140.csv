He's helped me to improve in so many areas, his work ethic, his talent, just everything he brings. The discipline he has, he's been just such an incredible team-mate.

But I'm sure that it's just a matter of time before he comes back and joins us to fight for wins. He will give so much to Williams, the way he's so sensitive to every small change and every small feeling there is in the car. I'm pretty sure that already tomorrow they will have a lot of valuable feedback that will help them for next year. But yeah, I'll definitely miss the fights.\xa0\n\n\nWe've had our moments on track, but that's only because we were fighting so close together and because he's been pushing me all the way. And it's been an absolute pleasure. And of course, in some moments, in the actual moment, in the present moment, there's frustration. But I'm sure that, and actually already now, I'm looking back at those moments. with a lot of positive memories.

Valtteri Bottas will race his last F1 race on Sunday, at least for now.\n\nHeikki Kulta\n\n7.12. 14:33\n\nOn 15 November 2011, Valtteri Bottas drove an F1 car on a race track for the first time. The stage was the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi. On Sunday, the 35-year-old Finnish driver will drive his last F1 race on the same track.\n\nThirteen years ago, then GP3 champion Bottas had only gained F1 experience in advance from two straight tests at the Kemble circuit in England. Sunday marks the 246th race of his F1 career.\n\nBut Bottas, who has been the last Finnish driver on the grid for the last three seasons, refuses to think that after the final race he will say goodbye to the F1 pace he loves.\n\n**- I have a feeling that I\'m not finished with this sport. I still have a lot to give, so I\'m going to see this through to the end of this card,"" Bottas asserted in a telephone interview on Saturday morning ahead of the day\'s challenges.**\n\nAfter five years with Mercedes as Lewis Hamilton\'s teammate, Bottas moved to the Sauber team, which operated under the Alfa Romeo banner, in 2022 for virtually nothing more than top positions.\n\nFrederic Vasseur, who had led the Finn to success in the minor leagues, was team principal in 2022, but after he moved to Ferrari for 2023, Sauber has since gone without a team boss.\n\nSo Bottas\' first three-year F1 contract did not turn out to be the best of his career?\n\n**- Certainly not. If I could go back three years, I would have switched to somewhere else. Unfortunately, that\'s the way it is. It was a big mistake, but it\'s hard to predict these things in advance,"" Bottas sighed.**\n\n*Valtteri Bottas was spraying bubbly in his mouth after winning the Russian GP in spring 2017, when he was a Mercedes man.*\n\n**- That first year with Vasseur was a good one. The team spirit was good and the results were pretty good. The last two seasons since then have been a bit downhill all the way. Of course, that also affects my image as a driver. If you can\'t show results, you kind of forget your name.**\n\nUnder Vasseur in 2022, Bottas finished in the top 10 in the drivers\' championship with 49 points - his best result was fifth place at Imola. The team finished sixth in the Manufacturers\' World Championship. In 2023, the standings started to collapse, and in this record-breaking season Bottas is still at zero on the eve of the final race.\n\n**- This season has been undeniably awful. In 2022, when Vasseur and I set the targets and how to achieve them, we had a clear plan. But when he left, all the goals and plans were really scrapped. Since then it has been much more challenging.**\n\nIn Qatar, Bottas scored his best finish of the season in 11th place, which lifted him out of the drivers\' championship, past Logan Sargeant.\n\nBottas says it was that race that was his biggest disappointment of the season.\n\n**- The team sacrificed me quite rudely there, and offered Guanyu Zhou the better tactics that got us the points. It was just a case of seeing which car was ahead, got the priority, and that\'s why they stopped me earlier to help my teammate. There went my chances of finishing in the top ten. I\'ve learnt a lot of things this season and my skin has tanned from it.**\n\nValtteri Bottas feels that the team sacrificed him for another driver.', 'He god fucked when Fred left. He was Vasseur driver and while Fred rated him high Seidl was exact opposite. Will be interesting to see how it goes to Hulk since he was Seidl signing and not a Binotto one. Felt like Binotto wanted both Bottas and Bortoleto to the team but there just was one spot left.', 'These are strong words from someone often as balanced as Bottas is', 'Interesting that he says next years plans will be finalised next week. Merc reserve incoming.\n\nThat said, I don‚Äôt think Bottas and his team played this silly season well. He was publicly talking throughout the early part of it about how he only wanted long contracts, that‚Äôs just not a game you can play when your car‚Äôs too shit to put results on the board. Alpine IMO was his best shot, since they‚Äôre not overly attached to the rookie they chose, but no way was Flavio going to give him more than a year at a time.\n\n*So Bottas‚Äô first three-year F1 contract didn‚Äôt turn out to be the best of his career?\n\n‚Äì Absolutely not. If I could go back three years, I would have changed somewhere else. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs how it is. This was a big mistake, but it‚Äôs hard to predict these things in advance, Bottas sighed.*\n\nThis is interesting to me too. What if he had gone to Williams, or to Haas?', 'He had the choice of moving to Williams at the time, in hindsight it would have been the better move.', 'As time goes on, it shows what a turd Seidl is/was on the upper management end. \n\nMcLaren instantly changed their trajectory after he left.

Which drivers have you changed your opinion on after this season? Good, bad or otherwise?

For me

The Mclaren drivers- I expected Oscar to be closer to Lando this year but Lando has proven to be quicker than I thought and Oscar has not made the overall improvement I expected.

Yuki- I expected Yuki and Daniel to be close but Yuki has proven to be a much more rounded driver than I previously thought.

Colapinto- Never really seen or heard much of him,but despite some late crashes he showed some good pace out there this season



","['Hulk and really all of Haas.  Now that Guenther is gone,  they have really improved so much as a team.  I didn‚Äôt expect that at all.  And without Alpine master class in Brazil,  they had 6th!  \n\nI hope they can keep the momentum with Ocon and Ollie.', ""Leclerc - I did believe he was a very fast driver, but he stepped up quite a bit, especially with his race management. The engineer change seems to have helped him out a lot too. Now I believe he's a champion in waiting.\n\nPiastri - Peaked during the European leg but was disapponting after that. His qualifying is rough to watch compared to Norris. \n\nBottas - Thought he was washed last year when Zhou was close, but he did a better job this year regardless of the standings."", ""Yuki really impressed me with his growth on and off the track. Red Bull not giving him the second seat beside Max is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI think I've become a bigger fan of Hulk and KMag after this season. They were both so solid for Haas all season. Hopefully Nico gets a great car with Audi and Kevin carves out a successful career in whatever discipline he chooses next."", ""Oscar is my second favorite driver but hes been very disappointing this season. Outqualified 20-4 with one of those winnings being in Baku where Lando had to lift. 0 poles to Lando's 8 and made a lot of mistakes in both races and qualifying. He still has time to turn into a championship contender but you would think with the discourse surrounding Lando, Oscar wouldve been closer to Lando"", 'Charles Leclerc - he was the ‚Äúfast but inconsistent‚Äù one for me, but this season he‚Äôs proven that he‚Äôs matured to a more rounded driver.', 'Gasly.

He hasn't had a horrible season but after 2 long seasons he hasnt really improved his baseline pace compared to lando which is notoriously something you either have or don't. I think next year will be defining for him and if he's still consistently slower, teams won't be looking at him as a potential driver to lead a WDC charge.\n\nLeclerc impressed me a lot with his mentality and cutting out the occasional mistakes from his previous seasons.

and as you see all of the rookies coming next year (including this year‚Äôs f2 champion), besides kimi, are getting a bottom/midfield team. to be fair ive only really watched kimi in f2 this year bc im pretty sure he skipped f3, but can anyone give any insight into how good kimi is? additionally, i do remember a lot of people being upset that drivers like paul aron, zane maloney, and other reserve drivers weren‚Äôt being considered for seats given their driving experience or current form as an f2 rookie. so my question is, do all the teams see kimi as being on par with max‚Äôs junior career considering he‚Äôs getting a similar treatment or it toto just anxious about possibly losing out on generational talent again? in that same regard, was max only really seen as a ‚Äúmust get‚Äù talent to redbull? if anyone has any insight i would love to hear! 

**side note: but even max started in toro rosso which makes me even more interested in kimi‚Äôs positioning at mercedes so early in his career**","['There‚Äôs no one reason, but rather a combination of several factors:\n\nIf Mercedes could have placed Kimi in a second team (like Max at Toro Rosso or like they did with George at Williams) they probably would have. But Williams is more financially stable these days and sees more value in an established second driver than in getting some cash from Mercedes to fill a seat. \n \nThough Mercedes won‚Äôt admit it publicly, they‚Äôre far enough off the top teams right now that they‚Äôre unlikely to be fighting for anything next year. As that is the case, they have a ‚Äúfree‚Äù year to put Kimi in before the reg changes. \n\nThere is the Max comparison too. Toto wants his own Max. How close Max really was to joining Mercedes we‚Äôll probably never know, but it was close enough for Toto to not want to miss out again. \n\nThere are very few, if any, options for an established driver to fill that seat on a one year or a 1+1 deal. Sainz probably wouldn‚Äôt have signed on for that. Guys like Bottas/KMag probably would. But those guys probably aren‚Äôt moving the needle enough next  year, so you might as well just give Kimi the year.\n\nETA: Re: Max. The ability of Red Bull to put Max in an F1 car immediately was reportedly critical in getting him to the team. Red Bull has the luxury of 4 seats and an entire extra team to mess around with. This is one of the criticisms of allowing RB to have two teams, which is its own discussion.\n\nAnd Mercedes clearly rates him as a generational  talent. As they have little to lose, they roll the dice.', '>""but can someone genuinely explain kimi getting a top seat as a rookie?""\n\nToto wants his very own Max Verstappen. And he wants him now not latter.', ""Mercedes doesn't have a junior team. They've paid teams like Manor, Sauber, and Williams to take their juniors before, but there wasn't a team interested in being their training grounds for Kimi for a year or two. Mercedes wasn't thrilled that they had to leave George in Williams the full three years when they wanted to retrieve him sooner, but Williams only accepted a three year contract, and forced them to see it to the end. So, their options were to not put Antonelli in a seat, or to put them in their seat. We don't know if they had any extra pressure to put Kimi in a seat or lose him to another team, because we don't know contract details.\n\nOther teams wanted Max, but none of the other teams were going to offer a 17 year old an F1 seat, so Max signed with Red Bull."", ""Mercedes happened to have a seat available in the main team at the same time that Antonelli was available. Mercedes are currently in a similar position to where McLaren were when they hired Piastri\n\nHis junior career has been very strong. He won two F4 series as a rookie, followed by winning FRECA the following year also as a rookie, all before turning 18. Then in F2 his team haven't been good but he still convincingly beat his teammate Bearman who was also highly rated and proved capable in F1 on multiple occasions."", ""He's a Mercedes junior. They need someone to replace Lewis and feel it's better to put him right in than try to get him a Williams seat, especially since Vowles seems unwilling to do that. He is a hot commodity and leaving him on the sidelines for too long risks him pulling a Piastri. \n\nPaul Aron probably could've got a seat if he had connections, but he doesn't. By finishing 3rd he's not exactly made himself undeniable to the point teams are knocking down his door.\n\nBortoleto had to leave McLaren for a seat since they've got no openings. Bearman obviously isn't going to Ferrari yet, so he goes to their customer team. Doohan is at the senior Alpine team, they just happen to suck."", 'i\'m sure the current kimi situation wasn\'t toto\'s first preference and he would\'ve much rather had max drive for him while kimi developed in williams for at least a year.\n\nbut james vowles did not want to incubate merc juniors and pursued carlos instead and max simply didn\'t want to join mercedes leading to this snowballing effect. in toto\'s head it\'s probably better to give kimi a shot nonetheless instead of storing him away as a reserve.\n\nof course all of this seems to be heavily hinging on kimi being ""the next verstappen"" which is an insanely tall order.', ""McLaren hasn't been shy to put rookies in. Lewis, KMag, Stoffel, Lando, Oscar. Sometimes the car has been great, sometimes not so much. Sometimes the rookie has worked out amazingly, sometimes not so much.

Other teams like Ferrari and Mercedes- and even some others have tried- have sometimes used other teams as proving grounds via a loan, and sometimes they can't get a contract like that."", 'Kimi has great potential.

1h9j4kj,Penalties,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h9j4kj/penalties/,2024-12-08, Discussion,"Hey everyone. I'm just curious to see if I'm the only person who thinks F1 penalties have gotten ridiculous. I get that sometimes they are warranted but when there is a racing incident in the 1st corner on the opening lap of the race and absolutely nothing flagrant, there's no need for a penalty. Contact happens, it is racing after all. I guess being a Nascar fan I expect drivers to always race hard and not have to ""be careful"" around others competing for a manufacturer championship...that kind of careful driving, in my opinion, should only apply when one is being lapped. If they're racing for position...well...they should be allowed to actually race! I guess that aligns nicely with F1's extreme pretentiousness....","['Crofty and Brundle said that the penalties have been harsher recently because the drivers asked for it, specifically when it comes to running into other cars', '5 second penalties were largely irrelevant last season so they discouraged nothing.  10 second penalties are appropriate IMO.', ""> Contact happens, it is racing after all.\n\nCorrect, which is why racing incidents are not penalized.\n\nPenalties exist to *encourage* people to race and not endanger lives and bomb into people like it's a Forza lobby"", '""Rubbing is racing"" is a closed wheel thing, not open wheel, and especially not F1. You don\'t see the indycars touch on ovals like the stock cars do, people could die.', '>""being a NASCAR fan""\n\nSo, I do mean this respectfully, but NASCAR is far more about the entertainment aspect than F1 is. And by ""entertainment"" I mean ""people watch NASCAR because of the wrecks, so NASCAR looks the other way on wrecking.""\n\nAs much as we all love Days of Thunder, rubbing *ain\'t* racing in this world. Open wheel cars are a lot more sensitive to contact than cars with fenders are. Most of the time, wheel to wheel contact means someone is going airborne, so stewards penalize dangerous driving a lot more harshly than series with closed wheels. \n\nImo, if drivers don\'t want a penalty, don\'t do moves that require a wreck to happen for the move to be completed. The move that Max did in the first turn *is* considered a flagrant move in bad taste in this world, and it *absolutely* needed a penalty. F1 may either just not be for you, or you may need to adjust what you consider racing to be. Contact ain\'t acceptable in this series, though.', ""There's a racing incident but then there's that move."", 'You make a mistake = you get penalised. Max made a mistake, so it‚Äôs a penalty. I just think there should be more variety. There is no way Max should get the same penalty as Oscar', 'It‚Äôs fun to see the drivers actually race, it‚Äôs not fun to watch divebombs where either both cars are out or one has ti back out every time to avoid it. Look at Leclerc vs Verstappen, theres been a lot of great racing within the rules. Or Leclerc and Sainz the last few races.\n\nVerstappen is a great driver, and has a lot of great racing against others, but at times he makes the sport less entertaining when he goes over the line, when other drivers can‚Äôt pass him because he will just take them out', 'Sounds like F1 isn‚Äôt for you sadly‚Ä¶', ""1st lap incidents are usually ignored because there is so much traffic that avoiding contact is really difficult, not really the case here. Max sent it into a gap that didn't exist and went into the side of another car, it's a slam dunk penalty. Max is used to dive bombing people and them getting out the way for him, serves him right IMO.""]",0,49,0.18,0,42,42,0,0,0.0,0
