Here is how they fared against each other:","['Sometimes stats are kinda useless, but in this case it really shows the differences between them. Senna (more aggressive) with many more poles and more wins, but Prost (more disciplined and calmer) with more points and less DNFs (assuming his more ""conservative"" driving style would lead to less DNFs)', ""I guess the points are including drop scores. If you include all the points it would be a more decisive 186-154 for Prost.\n\nThese stats are flattering Senna. He was much quicker in qualifying, no doubt about that, but in the races they were pretty closely matched. However, Senna tended to finish ahead more often in 2-car finishes, simply because he started ahead more often. Prost would take full advantage in the comparatively abnormal races, and limit the damage in the normal races, to get ahead of Senna in both seasons. \n\nI would say Prost was the better driver in 1988 and Senna was the better driver in 1989. In a perfect world they'd have swapped those two WDCs."", 'IMO the best F1 rivalry and love they became bros after the fact.', 'Two legendary all time greats. Easily the highest level teammate pairing of all time', 'How is race head to head calculated when there were more than 20 races?\xa0', ""It's funny if you listen to Niki Lauda talk about being Prost's team mate in 84 he says he couldn't match Prost's qually pace because he took so many risks, Alain seems to have calmed down a bit by 88. Some say Peroni's 82 crash and seeing the aftermath played on his mind, Alain certainly made a conscious decision to not take risks in bad wet races in the latter part of his career."", ""Alain Prost should be more of a role model that he's thought of. Guy outbrained Ayrton Senna and Niki Lauda."", 'Did sennas death count as another dnf?', ""For People that don't know, Prost beat Senna in 1988 by quite a margin actually (Prost 105 : Senna 94), but thanks to the god awful rule that only the best 11 finishes count, he lost the championship (Prost 87:Senna 90).\n\nThey scrapped the rule the following year.\n\nIn my opinion Prost is criminally underrated.""]",35,21,0.87,35,20,20,35,21,0.87,35
