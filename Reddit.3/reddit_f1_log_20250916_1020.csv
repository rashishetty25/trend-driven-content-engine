What is it I don’t get about McLaren culture that makes you stand so much from almost every other competitor in the history of the championship? \n\n*Oscar*: I mean, I think we’ve said many, many times now that we don’t just want a chance of this success just for this year. You know, there’s a big regulations change next year. We don’t know how competitive we’re going to be, we don’t know how competitive anyone’s going to be. **But you know, ultimately, we want the best chance of winning championships for as long as we’re Formula 1 drivers, and we’re both at McLaren for a very long time. And protecting the people around us that give us this opportunity is a very important thing. So I think it’s easy enough to put yourself second at times like that.** Especially, if we were fighting very closely the whole race, then you know, it’s slightly different. But Lando was ahead by a few seconds the whole race. So there’s no concern for me with that. And ultimately, again, we don’t just want this year to fight for a championship. We want it for as long as possible. And protecting the people—that includes the people doing the pit stops. You know, it’s not a very nice feeling, I would imagine. **So it’s important to protect all the people that we have because that’s what gives us a championship hope for years to come.** \n\n*Lando*: That was beautiful. He said it well, I don’t need to add anymore. **The team is priority. Team is number one, then drivers are second. That’s how it works.** Normally when you see teams who don’t have some sort of, enough respect for the team and the opportunities that the team give, it normally doesn’t last long. And you see that with plenty of other teams whether it’s been Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes. And we want to try and be in this position for a longer period of time than what they have been at the top.

Their lines were straight but not parallel, so their lines inevitably intersected.  The problem was that Carlos started slowly drifting towards Checo (I don’t think Carlos was trying to be aggressive, his confusion on the radio makes me think he just had a lapse of judgement and was too focused on following Charles’s slipstream), and Checo had more than enough time to react but didn’t.  Carlos started the incident, and Checo finished it.\n\nI wish Carlos was more patient and didn’t try to overtake Charles at the moment because it jeopardized his exit out of the turn, making him end up ahead of Checo but not fully in front where he could defend better.  With how much Charles’s tyres were degraded it would actually have been good for Carlos to pass Charles, but that was not the right moment to do so.  At the same time, I do think there was a brief opportunity for Carlos to pass Charles but Charles ended up veering to the right to complete the turn and squeezed Carlos a bit (not Charles’s fault, just purely circumstantial).\n\nAnd ngl, the sun on that straight looked horrible for visibility.
