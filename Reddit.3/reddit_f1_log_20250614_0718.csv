In any case, if they want to be supporters or close to the team, it's a failure. We have to ask ourselves the right questions if Ferrari hasn't won for a few years. We changed the team principal, we changed the drivers, we changed almost everything except one thing. My position is fragile by definition. It's like a football coach. We know that when you do this job at Ferrari or elsewhere, you are exposed. I think there are three team principals who change per season so I didn't come here thinking I'm doing this for life.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.
