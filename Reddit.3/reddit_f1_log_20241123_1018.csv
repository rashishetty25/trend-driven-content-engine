The championship team feared McLaren might lodge a surprise complaint that could see all cars with protective skids disqualified. McLaren, having avoided this solution from the start, had no intention of protesting, as they were unaware of the ambiguity in the rules.\n\n> Ferrari was not appeased. “Six days’ notice was extremely short,” lamented Vasseur. The primary issue wasn’t raising the car slightly, which Ferrari’s SF-24 could handle due to its wide aerodynamic tolerance. The bigger concern was excessive wear on the unprotected mounting screws if the car bottomed out on the track, potentially violating the millimeter-rule. Gaining reliable data and performing tests under Free Practice conditions left little room for adjustments.\n\n> Ferrari briefly considered ignoring the directive. With written FIA approval in hand, the stewards would have little grounds to disqualify them if a protest occurred. However, Vasseur ultimately decided against it, unwilling to fan the flames in the Constructors’ Championship battle. “We’re better off focusing on ourselves. The FIA already has enough problems,” he concluded.\n\nThis is backed up by F1.uno, who reported that Ferrari had received explicit permission for this previously and that's why they were the most upset.\n\nThe ~~seven~~ eight teams that had to change their skid blocks were: Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes, Aston Martin, Haas, Sauber, Alpine, and VCARB.\n\nAll in all, it's a very messy situation, but probably not that impactful on car performance."", 'So to summarise, Red Bull were so paranoid that McLaren might protest something they had done (probably paranoid about revenge after they tried to get McLaren in trouble for the tyre thing) that they blew the whistle on themselves.

1gx8ffr,Who will be the next American (USA) F1 Driver?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gx8ffr/who_will_be_the_next_american_usa_f1_driver/,2024-11-22, Discussion,"This is a question I asked on this Reddit around 2.5 years ago (just after it was announced Andretti had a good chance of getting on the grid!) - (https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/sw8s2i/who\_will\_be\_the\_next\_american\_usa\_f1\_driver/)

Although at the time Sergeant was the only American driver in F2, the comments make it seem like none of us had much confidence he'd make it. 

With Logan now out and the US still a massive and expanding market for F1; I thought it would be interesting to ask again. Frankly, this time it seems even less obvious who it might be.

I see the options as:

* Jak Crawford - The best placed American in F2 (currently 5th), with links to Aston Martin. However, frankly, I think its unlikely Aston would put him in their car.
* Juan Manuel Correa - Sadly will perhaps always be best know for being part of Hubert's tragic crash.
* Max Esterson - Stepping up to F2 next weekend, but does not have great results over the last few years.
* Ugo Ugochukwu - Unlike the last time I asked when there were 5 Americans in F3, there is only Esterson this year and so far only Ugochukwu confirmed for next year. He is perhaps the most exciting US prospect having won Macau last weekend and being a long-term part of the McLaren junior programme. But like Bortoleto would he need to go elsewhere to get an F1 drive?
* Colton Herta - Still fairly young Andretti driver who could come across with them?

Again, an honourable mention to Pato O'Ward who grew up in Texas but was born in Mexico - who drives for McLaren in Indy but has expressed an interest in coming to F1 before. Nowadays, I'd see him more as a possible stand in for a F1 race in the Americas if Lando or Oscar were injured. ","[""If Colton wants the drive.

The Andretti ties work in his favour obviously but curious what Michael’s involvement is these days. \n\nI agree that Correa and Esterson are not realistic. I’d probably give Ugo the best chance after Crawford but outside of Macau, he wasn’t great this year either.
