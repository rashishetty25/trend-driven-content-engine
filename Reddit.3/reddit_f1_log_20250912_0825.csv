1ne57q8,What Undercuts and Overcuts Are,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ne57q8/what_undercuts_and_overcuts_are/,2025-09-11, Discussion,"It's become apparent in recent discourse that people use the terms Undercut and Overcut to mean any change in position which happens around a pitstop phase.

This isn't really what these terms mean when discussed in terms of ""Driver X was given an undercut by the team"". etc.

Undercut or Overcut is all about changes in position happening around pitstops precisely because of the timing of the stop giving you a pace advantage on track.

# Undercut -

The Undercut is the idea that pitting earlier gives you the opportunity to gain time on the driver you are battling by being able to exploit fresh tyres. This increased pace over the car out on track on worn tyres might allow you to gain multiple seconds per lap.

**Risks of Undercut  -** The Undercut only works if you can get upto speed quickly and exploit the pace of the fresh tyres. Traffic is usually a big risk for an Undercut strategy as if you have to pass cars you can't exploit the pace of your fresh tyres. The other potential issue is tyre warm up which in F1 usually isn't much of an issue due to tyre warmers, but with hard tyres on cool tracks it can still be a significant issue. Also pitting first means you will have to go longer on your tyres, potentially leaving you vulnerable later in the race.

Safety cars are a huge risk for a driver attempting an Undercut, if you pit first under green flag conditions and then a safety car or VSC comes out your advantage is demolished.

**How to Negate an Undercut -** Having a big enough lead over the car behind can protect you from an undercut, or having the pace to match (or nearly match) the driver on fresh tyres. Otherwise the strategy to defend from an UnderCut is to pit as soon after your rival as you can to negate their advantage. Then the ultimate way to defend from an Undercut is to pit first!

Or, you run much much longer and allow them to undercut you with the intention of passing them later on much fresher tyres.

# Overcut -

The Overcut is the idea of staying out longer than your rival and using the pace of your car and tyres to gain time on them on their outlaps. This also defends from potential safety cars benefitting your opponent over yourself.

**Risks of Overcut -** This only really works if either you have an inherently faster car, tyre wear is next to non-existent or the tyres cars are pitting onto have a signficant warm up phase or are just inherently slower. In F1 it is fairly rare where the Overcut is the preferred strategy as tyres come out the blankets nearly ready to race, but traffic can make the overcut viable. This is something you see more in series without tyre warmers such as indycar.

**How to Negate an Overcut -** Negating an OverCut is all about not pitting too early and ensuring you have good pace on your fresh tyres. If you have a quicker car behind you and fresh tyres are gonna take a while to be upto speed then pitting first is very dangerous and you are going to want to try and outlast your opponent. In these situations sometimes you get a game of ""pit stop chicken"" where they try to goad each other into pitting first.

# Exceptions -

If a driver suffers a slow pit stop for whatever reason and gets passed either by a car pitting earlier or later, that isn't an Under or Over cut. The timing of the cars pitting is not the reason that the positions changed, it was the issues in the pitlane.

Saying a car Overcut or Undercut in such situations is missing the reason for the overtake happening which is entirely the time spent on pitlane, not the timing of the stop.

What exactly does he mean by this? In an ideal universe he, Will Joseph (and the rest of the McLaren pitwall), and us are all using the exact same definition of under/overcut (and I think the OP provides a very clear one here), but it seems to get a little murky in what Lando means by this request.

1ne4yhl,"Are there really almost no hype for this season’s title battle or my algorithm tricks me into believing that, what are your opinions ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ne4yhl/are_there_really_almost_no_hype_for_this_seasons/,2025-09-11, Discussion,"As title says what do you think ? I’m believing that this championship battle has almost no hype. McLaren is obviously a rocket ship no one can deny that. After 16 races both McLaren drivers individually have more points than any other constructors. Lando is currently 13 points ahead of Ferrari and Piastri is 44 points ahead of them. And they both have same car so they’re equal on that.
In terms of skill etc. I’m believing that Oscar is slightly more talented than Lando but Lando’s experience balances it, so they’re almost equal on that too.
Basically there’s no significant difference for me that effects the battle significantly.

Situation looks like it’s screaming 2016 all over again but nobody is hyped about it. In summer break the gap was 8 points if I remember correctly, it’s basically nothing but why nobody is excited about it ?

For me a big factor is this 

-McLaren intervenes their battle quite a lot than it should be which kills the excitement quite a lot for me. They’re acting like a parent whose twins are competing over something (let’s say exam scores) , they create some boundaries etc. If the situation is indeed like twins competing over exam scores I’d say they’re good parents. Since they don’t let the tension rise etc. but the situation isn’t like that at all. 
In title battles I’ve watched and heard things weren’t that calm, they’d go all out do whatever they can to win which creates a big excitement.

Another thing is we don’t see on track battles between McLaren drivers. Usually for me on track battles creates a lot of excitement they lack that too. Do they ever really had an on track battle for a win this season ? I’d say no they were usually close but not a significant battle they kinda accept their position and move on. It feels like there’s some sort of de facto Multi-21 team order.

Finally I think they lack aggressiveness. If you followed interviews etc. they aren’t aggressive their statements doesn’t feel like they’re fighting for championship instead it feels like they’re in an upper-midfield team that fight for podiums. And you can see that lack of aggressiveness in team radios too. In Monza Lando had a bad pit stop and got undercutted by Oscar because of this, McLaren intervened asked Oscar to return position and Oscar just accepted it. He didn’t resist at all. I get it in radio they said to him it’s payback for Hungary last year but still I don’t get it at all. 

Oscar and Lando are fighting for title this year, situation is completely different than 2024. It’s just so stupid.

Anyways that’s what I think about that.
Do you think that this title race is boring if so why ? 


It’d be nice to read some opinions beside the ones that my algorithm shows me.

Thanks.


","['I think this is one of those seasons where the WDC fight is *interesting* rather than *exciting*. It happens sometimes - to me, it\'s the same principle as a race being won on strategy instead of wheel-to-wheel racing. It\'s less popular and not as flashy, but still a perfectly valid method of doing it.\n\nThe main reason I say it\'s interesting is because of the very reason a lot of people don\'t like it: McLaren are managing this in a way I don\'t know if any team in a similar position has before. There\'s a tendency to believe that the only valid personality for an F1 World Champion is to have a huge ego, blow off anyone who thinks they can control them, and be a complete ruthless bastard on track. What we\'re seeing is an inverse of the driver-team relationship someone like that usually provokes; the team are the ones pulling rank on the drivers, they\'re the ones steering the championship instead of the ego of one or both drivers, and for the novelty of that approach alone I think it\'s interesting to see.\n\nI think it\'s kind of a perfect storm for them to even be able to try this, and the reason I think that is also where I think the difference is between this season and something like 2016. What I think is key to McLaren\'s driver management this season is that neither Piastri nor Norris have won or seriously challenged for a title before. That means neither of them have effectively earned the right to be considered the ""default"" driver. While Norris is the more experienced and was a McLaren junior before F1, it\'s not really his team because Piastri has the arguably higher pedigree, with the F3/F2 back to back titles and the public coup that was his signing in the first place. At the start of last year, neither had won a race at all, and now they\'re battling for the championship. When you look at other teammate WDC fights, they\'re not so evenly matched (from the team\'s perspective), and that changes the driver\'s mentality too. 2016 was exciting because we\'d seen Rosberg beaten twice in a row - including very convincingly in 2015 - while Hamilton\'s stock grew as he racked up the championships. There was a very obvious underdog story going on that year that doesn\'t really apply this year because both drivers have pretty much equal stock. Incidentally, that\'s also part of why I think there\'s so much belief that McLaren are institutionally against Piastri - people like to root for the underdog, so when there\'s someone doing better you have to find some reason for it to be a heartwarming story too.\n\nSee what I mean - I have a lot of thoughts about how this is going, so compared to a season where one driver cruises to the title with no competition, I can never say this is a boring season. I think it\'s fascinating to see whether they can hold it together with this unusual management style, it\'ll be interesting to see whether those driver egos we expect are actually present and what the breaking point might be, and I\'m still as invested as ever in seeing every race because the gap is close enough that everything still matters.', 'I find it boring because the battles between Lando and Oscar are mild and uniteresting personalities. Lewis/Nico, Lewis/Max, Max/Charles were better to watch imo. \n\nSeems the interesting battles are between McLaren and Max/Charles/George, but the title decider is inside the team. \n\nI hope they start the real fight soon.\n\nThis is just me.', 'Mostly, there’s no inter-team battle, and there’s no drama between the two Mclaren contenders. What we’ve had feeding the fight in the past was stuff like RB v. Ferrari (with all the hype that Ferrari itself brings), Max v Lewis (one of the biggest showdowns ever), Lewis v. Rosberg (friends turned enemies story), Alonso/Ferrari v. Vettel/RB, etc. \n\nNow we have the chillest guy against a guy that puts himself down at the first opportunity, and they let each other go through when requested. Hardly feisty narrative lol', 'I think it’s boring because the only possible intrigue is being neutered by McLaren trying to hyper manage driver/team relations out of fear. It’s not a team that looks strong and dominating, it’s a team that looks out of their element and scared to make mistakes. The car is doing extremely heavy lifting. The WCC is locked up and the WDC is being filtered through McLaren’s PR op. \n\nNot that the races aren’t worth watching anyway, but I honestly couldn’t give a crap about the title fight. Which is really odd, because it’s a resurgent team with two non-champions in the fight. It should be amazing, but it’s not. The only intrigue I have left for the title is if/when the reins come off this hand holding adventure.', 'Maybe on an individual level within McLaren, some might lean toward one driver or the other, but not the team as a whole. My biggest issue is that only Max can race them consistently; otherwise, the drivers end up fighting among themselves. When the team interferes with results, it doesn’t look good from the outside.\nAs for the racing being boring, I don’t think it is. Most events have delivered good competition and drama, and the upcoming tracks should provide more excitement, unless you only care about who finishes first.', 'I\'ve been thinking on this lately, particularly after some heavier, conflict-first (honestly, myself included) discussions after Monza. And, just in general. There seems to be a real disconnect between what we have on paper, and what us fans are experiencing. \n\nFor me personally, I find that I\'m able to get invested in the championship battle - though I have also never experienced this much ambiguity in the WDC standings. My first race that I watched live was literally Miami 2023, and it\'s been Max all the way down since then lol. Since I have no other battles to compare to, so I\'m able to get invested just in the ""ooh, what\'s going to happen?"" vibe. \n\nBut, I do have to ***work*** to get invested. It\'s intentional. Realistically, regardless of the media trying to hype up the battle, it just doesn\'t feel like there\'s blood on the line. I don\'t need to see Lando and Oscar truly hate each other, but I can\'t really think of any time we\'ve seen them emotional or pissed off, or that they truly *care* to beat the other. The intensity that as fans we\'re told to expect from the media hype, just isn\'t there. And that\'s the disconnect I think that folks are struggling to engage with as fans. We need to see more from the two of them that shows that this WDC *really matters*. \n\nThere\'s a real ""corporate identity above all"" vibe with McLaren that feels...off. It doesn\'t scream ""we\'re a racing team!"" it screams ""we are here to represent our sponsors."" Miscues and mistakes like Monza, and their response to those issues, compound this by giving us an *inkling* that they *might* choreograph their driver\'s on track positions. \n\nIt\'s odd. There\'s still something there, if you try to see it, but I don\'t blame anyone for not feeling like they really want to try.', 'I think we just lack a proper w2w Lando Oscar battle', ""It's because we're not watching a battle — we're watching employees of the month.\nThey simply aren't hungry.\nI'm not even talking about the so-called 'killer instinct', but at least a sense of wanting to win the title.\nIf they don't care, it's hard to make the fans care"", 'You guys need to realize that not every championship battle will go down the wire like 2021']",123,235,0.72,123,2482,2482,5,6,0.0,5
