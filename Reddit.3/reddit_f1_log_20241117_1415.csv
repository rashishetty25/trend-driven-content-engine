Season start 2025? No bud. 1% chance. No more.\n\nThe only chance Hadjar has in racing in F1 in 2025 is if Alpine boots Doohan in favor of Colapinto, which i doubt is going to happen, but not entirely inconceivable. Yes, that would be a shame for Doohan, but, let's not act like F1 isn't F1 and results matter, and let's not call Doohan a F1 marvel and it would be a crime if he wouldn't have a seat. \n\nONLY in that case, would Hadjar have a chance at a 2025 season start racing seat, and then that would only happen IF Perez would be replaced by Lawson. And even that is up for debate, because not only would Lawson have to be a guaranteed outperformance of Perez ( we're not talking about holding his position in a race where Perez never was supposed to be anyway ). W√©re talking about him actually doing good enough in order to get RBR that P1 (or p2) in the WCC standings, be a proper Nr2 driver to Verstappen, **AND** bring in more funding than they would lose by releasing Perez from his contract.\n\nAnd that's where the whole 'ordeal' is. Checo is the perfect Nr2 driver for Verstappen. He however is not performing on the level enough for RBR to be a P1 - or even P2 - WCC result. However, as long as Perez' and his backers bring in enough merchandising, RB sales, and sponsorship money from his personal sponsor 'wallet', that would 'compensate' for not making P1 in the WCC ( or P2, for that matter), then there is no benefit for RBR to sign Lawson.\n\nBecause Lawson does not have the financial (sponsor) and marketing weight behind him that Checo has. Not even close. So Lawson should be so absolutely prodigal in his F1 craft that would overcome that 'difference', and lets be honest, he doesn't. He hardly is doing better than Yuki, he hardly is doing better than Ricciardo. Even IF he is doing better in 1 or 2 races, he has to show and keep doing that for (more than) an entire season - guaranteed.\n\nOn top of that, though i don't believe RBR would ever take Yuki to the RBR team at all, there is still that question: would RBR pick Lawson over Yuki, and what would that do to Yuki @ VCarb. That means the question would be: could Yuki do better than Checo @ RBR? The obvious answer there is **no.** Does yuki bring financial power more than Checo? the obvious answer there is **no.** \n\nSo none of the two have a real shot in replacing Perez. And with that in mind, there is no room for Hadjar @ VCARB because what has Isack shown that would mean he would be a better choice for Vcarb than Lawson - and, if they'd ditch Lawson for Isack, then i suspect that would also come at the complete cost of Lawson's contract and thus a RBR reserve driver, which is what Hadjar right now exactly is, and they have nobody to replace him with.\n\nSo season start in 2025? Hell no. Especially since it's increasingly likely that Colapinto is going to replace Perez, because not only would Franco likely have the speed, mentality, and craft to outperform Checo, he also has huge financial power and potential. Which again means that not only is Hadjar dealing with Lawson, he also is dealing with Franco. \n\nSo Hadjar's only chance on a 2025 F1 seat is if Max, Perez/Colapinto, Yuki, or Liam has a situation ( sick, injury ) where they need him to fill in for, **or**, if Lawson pulls a Alguersuari move ( which he seems capable of ) or if they aren't satisfied with his performances sportively or financially, and mid-season will replace him with Isack.\n\nSo before the summer break 2025, there is virtually no chance for Isack, but because of the ever always tiny chance, i'm giving him 1 %."", ""If hadjar isn't in that RB next season he better be praying on Arvids downfall"", ""Yup, I'll repeat it again. \n\n2025 RB: Max, Yuki \n2025 vcarb: Hadjar, Lawson""]",644,64,0.96,644,57,57,154,9,0.0,154

1gt403f,Was Schumacher Really Pushed Out At Ferrari?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gt403f/was_schumacher_really_pushed_out_at_ferrari/,2024-11-17, Discussion,"Alright. I'm sure the vast amount of readers here knows the story. As reported by a BusinessF1 article, that [Schumacher was prematurely pushed out at Ferrari](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/51sn70/interesting_read_on_how_schumis_first_retirement/?rdt=33460) because good ol' Montezemolo got power hungry.

There appears to be but one problem. BusinessF1 is the one and only (AFAIK) source of the story, and we know that rag is as good as [diarrhea soaked toilet paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/18cxbwy/i_think_we_should_all_be_aware_that_buisnessf1/). 

To my knowledge, this story has **never** been corroborated by *any* reputable media outlets, nor have there been any actual insider statements. 

This is not one of those paddock open secrets where there has been enough confirmation with sources that a reputable outlet like the BBC would report on it with qualifying statements such as ""...understands that..."", ""...reportedly..."" ala Alonso's 2009 Ferrari move.

On the contrary, [Ross Brawn himself states that Michael didn't have it in him at the end of 2006 for the commitment required to gun for another WDC](https://youtu.be/t15tKnsUJrk?t=2335), and additionally Todt said had the rest of the dream team stayed on, [Todt would have quit himself](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/todt-reveals-he-planned-to-quit-ferrari-4406126/4406126/).

So, in the interest of getting to the bottom of this as a lifelong Schumacher fan, I was wondering if anyone has ever managed to track down a reputable source/report that was remotely contemporaneous to the events? Or is this story complete bullshit as is typical from BusinessF1?

Key takeaways found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gt403f/was_schumacher_really_pushed_out_at_ferrari/lxkkshm/).

MS was collateral damage.', 'In ‚ÄúMichael Schumacher: The Edge of Greatness‚Äù, James Allen very much describes the power struggle within Ferrari and that Schumacher‚Äôs retirement announcement was practically forced by Ferrari. \n\nIt‚Äôs always hard to say if that was true or not, a lot of stuff happens behind the scenes of F1 that we‚Äôre not privy to, but James Allen makes a pretty convincing case for it in his book.  Assuming he has much better direct sources than I have, I have no reason to doubt that what he wrote is true.', 'Mercedes is doing what Ferrari did back then', 'The number one thing that throws cold water over the ""he was pushed out"" was he stayed in the Ferrari universe years after the fact despite being able to sign for other teams if he wanted to. The reason he left was that he got bit by the racing bug again after prepping to be a potential replacement for Massa in 2009 (while Massa was in a coma from being hit by debris), but given that Ferrari already had 3 drivers contracted for 2010, there was simply no room for a return. \n\nAlso its an open secret that he lobbied for Ferrari to sign Kimi. Not the kind of thing you do if you were expecting to keep driving.', ""It's a complicated situation. Ferrari's choice of 2007-2009 lineup was a good one. Massa won 11 races between 2006-2008, an extremely impressive feat, and of course he fought for the title in 2008. Raikkonen remains the last champion for the Scuderia.\n\nI believe that Michael didn't really want to retire, but he had a great relationship with Felipe, so he decided to leave so as not to leave his friend without a seat for 2007. And of course, if Schumacher had stayed until the end of 2009, he would have had the potential to fight for title in 2007 and 2008."", ""I remember that kind of being the thinking at the time. They had just signed the highest-rated young talent (Raikkonen) and already had their young star that they'd developed in-house (Massa). Something had to give.\n\nThere's two lines of thinking around the whole thing:\n\nThe first is that Ferrari planned to have Schumacher team up with Raikkonen, with a view to the future and Raikkonen eventually replacing Schumacher as 'the man' at Ferrari. But Schumacher chose to back away, seemingly not wanting to race alongside an equal. Thus Massa ‚Äì who was probably going to be the reserve in 2007 ‚Äì got a reprieve.\n\nThe second is that Ferrari signed Raikkonen as a direct replacement for Schumacher, with Schumacher ageing and out of contract at the end of 2006.\n\nBoth theories are credible, and there was plenty of material around both ideas at the time (and since), but we'll never know the exact truth.\n\nPersonally I don't think he was explicitly forced out, but I do believe he jumped before Ferrari had a chance to sort of push him."", 'The body language of Michael as Luca tries to celebrate with him at Monza 2006 is pretty damning imo.', 'Wasn‚Äôt BusinessF1 the ‚Äújournalist‚Äù that said Suzie Wolff was feeding info to Toto?
