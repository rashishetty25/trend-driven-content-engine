If memory serves Haas also replaced its one this year. It‚Äôs got me thinking about the purpose of the motorhomes and their future. I love the variety of the motorhomes when we see them on Teds Notebook but can‚Äôt help but feel they are a complexity and expense which will soon be lost to time when the sport is becoming less European and supposedly more eco friendly.

At the turn of the millennium when the calendar was 16 / 17 races of which only 5 or so were outside Europe, the motorhomes would seem to be in use for a majority of the season. In 2025 and beyond, the number of European races makes up barely a third of the calendar and with rotation of races coming soon this is likely to decrease even more. At flyaway races, the circuits provide all the teams with a base and I think the paddock buildings at places like Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and China are far more beautiful than the caravan in a car park aesthetic we see in the European races.

Is it time for the European circuits to build some permanent team paddock buildings just like the Middle East / Asian / US / Aus circuits so each of the teams can retire their own motorhomes, save several million each and take 4 or 5 trucks for each team off the roads.

Would anyone be sad to see them go?","[""Permanent buildings would be a waste of the space for these circuits. You have to remember that most F1 tracks like Silverstone, Monza, Suzuka and Austin are used year-round for other series' from big events to local club races. All of these require the extra paddock space to be an expanse of tarmac that they can set up whatever trucks or transporters are there. The floor space that F1 motorhomes take up can be used to house 5 different series' cars at a proper club event, or can be used for something at a bigger event like GT World Challenge.\n\nThe temporary motorhomes are better for the circuits because there's no point building them for 1 event when it compromises the rest of the year and brings much more expense and maintenance."", ""I think in the grand scheme of 'the cost of doing business' for F1 teams its way too worth it. Having a space you fully control and bring with you, virtually flatpacked, where you can house your personell and equipment as well as entertain important guests and seal off from the general public is well worth a few extra trucks. \n\nNot to mention the structures themselves are practically giant billboards on race weekends."", '""more eco friendly""\n\nThere is nothing that will ever be ""eco friendly"" about flying 22 cars around the world to drive at 200mph in front of half a million people. Anyone telling you otherwise is lying to you. Stop listening to those people.', 'Sorry but there is nothing worse than a row of bland identical buildings at an F1 event, no individuality no creativity just blandness', 'If there‚Äôs one city willing to do this, it‚Äôd be Vegas. Not used throughout the rest of the year, and the city is dumb enough to approve a building used one weekend of 52', 'You must think that circuits are busy, and things needs to move away ASAP, removing motorhomes and having double the people that builds and destroys temporary houses is more expensive, also you will need a truck.\n\nI live near a ""famous circuit"" and motorhomes are there also for ""minor events"" (compared to F1)', 'But my point is Suzuka and Austin circuits provide the team buildings as the teams can‚Äôt truck their own ones there. If the buildings they provide are permanent or a temporary structure the circuit / promoter builds (like the ones they build on the field in Hard Rock Stadium at Miami), why do the teams when in Europe need to provide their own?\n\nGenuine question but if a new team arrived and didn‚Äôt have a motorhome at Silverstone, Spa, Monza etc, would the circuit provide one or would they just have to do without; presumably the ones they get at Bahrain etc are given to all teams by default so would have them at those races?', 'I think that‚Äôs the big thing which is advertising / branding for VIPs, \n\nPerhaps my other line of thinking is they have 1 for 7/8 European races per year, would a team think a second one they could base in the US and move between the 5 North American races, or one in the Middle East to go between the 4 races there would be good value instead of using the circuit provided one?', ""It is really striking if you go to Silverstone outside of Grand Prix weekend.\n\nThe Paddock where these motorhomes are is literally a car park, totally empty.\n\nThere aren't any buildings to give them, the team would have to hire somethign and bring it themselves.\n\nExpectig European circuits to build these is unrealistic as the circuits are old and have existed for a long time, they need to support all the racing they have been supporting for decades. And spending tens of millions making F1 level hospitality which will take space away from lwoere level motorsport and not be used 90% of the year would be financially disatrous for the old circuits.""]",0,16,0.24,0,15,15,0,0,0.04999999999999999,0

1n7osio,Is Oscar well on his way to become the next Generational talent?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n7osio/is_oscar_well_on_his_way_to_become_the_next/,2025-09-03, Discussion,"Oscar‚Äôs improvement this season have been phenomenal. The consistency he‚Äôs found compared to last year is something I don't think a lot of people expected. He‚Äôs gone from occasionally matching Lando to often looking like the stronger driver, and the first half of his season was proof of just how quickly he‚Äôs developed.

I see a lot of people dismissing him and Lando because of the good the car has been and their missed opportunities to fully maximise the car 100% of the time compared to drivers like Max or Russell. But Oscar is still so early in his career, and his rate of improvement has been remarkable. By next year, I can see him being at Charles and Russell‚Äôs level. He‚Äôs behind them for now, but the gap is closing fast. More faster than many think I'm willing to bet. 

Lando, meanwhile, feels like he‚Äôs hit a ceiling. In his seventh season, he‚Äôs already lost one title and may lose another to his younger teammate. Oscar‚Äôs former weaknesses like tyre management, qualifying, consistency are now looking ike strengths in some cases even stronger than Lando‚Äôs on a consistent basis.

If Mercedes are strong next year, I don‚Äôt think Russell will run away with the title like many think.  Oscar could already be on his level, maybe even above. And if McLaren have the fastest car, I actually see Aston Martin as the bigger threat. Depending on Alonso(who knows where he truly stands), McLaren could dominate and if they do Oscar looks like the driver who will prevail. He can maybe even go on to have a run like like Vettel, which would be ironic because his manager is webber, lol. 

It also makes me wonder: is Oscar right now ahead of where Verstappen was in his third year back in 2017? On a glance it feels like yes. But then you begin to look at performances like Spain and Brazil in '16 and Mexico in '17, where he beat already established top level drivers in a showcase of pure skill. I feel like Oscar hasn't had a a defining moment like that just yet. What he has better at, though, has been consistency. Curious to see what you guys think on this. ","['Imo this is recency bias. If you look at early races of people like Senna or Schumacher or Kubica or Alonso or Hamilton or Vettel or the early races of Verstappen you can see that spark which stands out. Not all of them actually realize that potential but the raw special IT factor is already there from the beginning.\n\nAlso Piastri is  Verstappen‚Äôs generation. Definitely zero doubt left that Verstappen is the driver of his generation. That story is pretty much done even if he doesn‚Äôt win another race ever', ""I will probably anger some people here, but I don't see Oscar as a generational talent tier. At least not even close to the talent Verstappen showed in his first years. You don't become a generational talent with time. You are either one and prove it to everyone from your first year or you are not.\n\nVerstappen in that Toro Rosso went on to give even Rosberg trouble during races and brought the car to some impressively high finishes. Then next year in the Red Bull he immediately hounded Ricciardo and almost matched him in results and performance. At the time Ricciardo was easily a top 5 driver on the grid, arguably even top 3, depending whom you ask. And Verstappen did all that while having way less single seater experience than Piastri had when he entered F1.\n\nOscar's first season was, well, it was ok. A few flashes through it, but can't say he did something amazing with the car or stood out as a talent. His 2nd season was kinda disappointing actually. McLaren had the best car, but Oscar rarely put a serious challenge to his teammate. Especially since Lando also had a poor 2024 and has rarely been considered to be viewed as one of the top 5 on the grid, let alone top 3.\n\nCurrently I think Hadjar has a better case for being considered a generational talent than Oscar does."", 'dude has done 2.5 years in f1. lets all chill with this and see where we are in another 5', 'He reminds me of Button - Great pace but not at the absolute top combined with outstanding consistency. He is still early in his career so he can still get even better. These tyres are just so hard to learn it takes ages for rookies to really master them. I don‚Äôt think doing a Hamilton-esque first season is really possible anymore.', ""I don't think people appreciate what generational means, Max and Lewis are the bar for that(in their peaks). Leclerc and Russell are the closest on the grid, but they're never going to be that level."", ""his only competition right now is lando given how much better the mclarens are compared to the other cars and before the DNF he wasn't exactly running away with it. IMO he's a tier below leclerc/russell but that could change depending on how he performs next year."", ""You don't become a generational talent. You either are one, or you're not imo.\n\nHe's definitely someone who could win multiple championships but idk if he's not had the highs of someone like Verstappen or Hamilton imo."", 'No.', 'I think people severely overestimate his progress, he is in his 3rd year after all\n\nDo you guys think he could have even come close to winning a title in his first year, like some others were able to do, given the right car?\n\nAlso, saying Lando LOST the title last year that was always nothing more than an outside chance is wild  \nYes on a technicality he ""lost"", but that was always going to be very unlikely seeing the gap he had to Max']",0,41,0.23,0,38,38,0,3,-0.009999999999999981,0
