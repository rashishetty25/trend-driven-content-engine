From the Formula 1 Miami Sprint Report:

‚Äú However, following the Sprint it was confirmed that Albon, Lawson and Bearman had all dropped out of the points, with the Thai racer handed a five-second time penalty for not staying above the minimum time behind the Safety Car while Lawson received the same punishment for causing a collision with Alonso.

Bearman was also hit with a five-second penalty for an unsafe release from the pits, with these changes promoting Russell to fourth and Stroll to fifth while Yuki Tsunoda, Antonelli and Pierre Gasly moved up into sixth, seventh and eighth respectively.‚Äù

They also made a\xa0[youtube video on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbTAHyzkrY&t=379s)\n\nBoth T1 incidents are cases of a driver overtaking on the inside of a corner, so these are the NON-BINDING guidelines that the stewards use\n\nThe overtaking car must:\n\n*i) Have its front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE THE MIRROR of the other car PRIOR TO AND AT THE APEX*\n\n*ii) Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex, and not have ‚Äòdived in‚Äô.*\n\n*iii) In the stewards‚Äô estimation, have taken a reasonable racing line and been able to complete the move whilst remaining within track limits.*\n\nSo provided the car on the inside is under control and takes (in the stewards opinion) a reasonable racing line, there is no requirement to leave space for the other car. You can't force them off, but you have the line, so don't need to leave space.\n\nThe-Race video also shows the changes for this year when overtaking on the outside, and it was implemented on the Lawson penalty. last season, I don't think Lawson would have got a penalty.\n\nTo be entitled to be given room when overtaking on the OUTSIDE, the overtaking car must:\n\n*i) Have its front axle AHEAD OF THE FRONT AXEL of the other car AT THE APEX*\n\n*ii) Be driven in a controlled manner from entry, to apex, and to exit.*\n\n*iii) Be able to make the corner within track limits.*\n\nThese changes, combined with the dirty air increases this season, are likely really bad for racing, but this is what the drivers want and the FIA has listened.\n\nImportant to note that Verstappen was penalised for leaving the track and gaining an advantage, which is also covered in the video. If he had given the place back it would have been fine."", 'In my view, Antonelli went wide so early in the corner that it\'s hard to justify that Antonelli was ""forced off track"" by Piastri.', ""Watch Jolyon Palmer's analysis.

At which point you won the corner.\n\nThe responsibility is then on the other car to miss you.\n\nIn both cases piastri got on the inside enough to claim the corner. In both cases comfortably. \n\nIn one case Max went off and gained an advantage by not giving back the position he'd lost: Penelty\n\nIn kimis case he went off and ended up worse for it. No advantage gained:  No penalty.\n\nOutside line: same but you need to be much further alongside. Which is fair because outside passes are next to impossible, clean, with sinilar cars.\n\nThe ruling on how far alongside in both cases varies depending on the current guideline.\n\nIMO they are about right at the moment. Not so a few years ago when outside passes were awarded far too readily."", 'i actually want to know as well, driver allow to shove other driver off track if its their corner is a bit weird for me tbh', 'Antonelli bailed out of that corner way too early to call it Piastri running him off. You have to attempt to make the corner to argue that. Plus honestly there was space for him to keep a wheel on the white line.', 'Your mistake is thinking Antonelli was run off the track. Anthony Davidson did a great breakdown shortly after the incident. \n\nWhen Piastri was turning right at the corner, Antonelli had plenty of track to stick to but fighting too hard meant he had to widen up and leave the track.', 'Honestly speaking what is frequently said on the radio is if you have the front of your car ahead of the other car before the corner, you should have that position. Theoretically that is the answer. But the call depends on the stewards and the race director and different people decide things in different way. The best call for teams is to give up the position gained if there is an investigation by the stewards to not risk getting a penalty. In this way, they still have a chance to take it back.', 'Actual rule is underdogs are always right.']",34,54,0.69,34,52,52,2,2,0.009999999999999898,2
