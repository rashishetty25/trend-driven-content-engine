Shame that Albon lost the P4 in the end, but that he even managed to hold onto that in the first place was amazing. Very nice start of the season for him and the team.\n* **Toro Rosso/Alpha Tauri** or whatever should just overhaul their whole strategy team. What a disgrace. And it has been a disgrace for quite a while now. It was the same last season as well, Yuki or Daniel in a good point scoring position? Nooooooo, watch us strategize them into the back of the field.

Really have no idea where they are in terms of pace.\n* **Aston Martin**, hats off to Stroll. Somehow in a wet race with so many people crashing, he manages to get into the points. The duality of Stroll. Beach yourself on the formation lap in Brazil, somehow survive this race. I just don't understand it lmao very happy for him though. Hopefully this is the start of a better season for him.\n* **Sauber** starting this season a lot better than last year. It seems like at the very least they are free from being the last place team in terms of their pace. Hulk rewarded their trust in him right away with some nice points on his Sauber debut. \n* **Ferrari**. Well Ferrari is doing Ferrari things. First of all I really expected more from them. Especially after Friday. It thought they'd have had the pace to take the fight to McLaren. Maybe they just went wrong in their setup. I hope that them having to raise their ride height isn't going to be a recurring problem this season... Also they really should've followed Max into the pits. \n* **Mercedes** had the driver that impressed me the most yesterday in Antonelli. Yes, he had his spin, yes George was P3 in front of him. Still for his very first race in F1, that was mighty impressive. I'm looking forward to seeing what more he can do in F1. It looks like Mercedes have a bright future with a very talented young driver. George an anonymous in P3 in the end, I don't mean that in a bad way btw. I just don't remember the tv direction showing him at all. He just drove a clean race in no mans land between the McLarens and Max on the one hand and the pack behind Alex behind him. \n* **Red Bull** really should've pitted Lawson a lap earlier. Why do you leave the inexperienced guy out on the mediums that long when McLarens have already skated off track? On the other hand they tried to gamble with Max. It didn't pay off, but it also didn't cost them. The right choice to make at the time. Max got mighty close to Lando in the end due to Lando making an error in turn 6. Like Max said, I don't think he could've gone for an overtake because there really was only one dry line. But it was fun to look at. \n* **McLaren** really are the class of the field. Although I really hope that Australia is an outlier in terms of pace for McLaren. If they are as far up the road in terms of pace and tyre management as it seems, we're in for 2023 part 2 Orange edition. They almost lost the win when both cars went off, but Lando managed to hold on. Oscar also did great to keep his head down and salvaged some points in the end. You never know how close it will be at the end of the season, so maybe those few points will come in clutch in the end.""]",43,249,0.92,43,1422,1422,5,2,0.010000000000000009,5

1jdbu2n,Speculation:  Did lack of institutional memory contribute to Haas' struggles in Melbourne?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jdbu2n/speculation_did_lack_of_institutional_memory/,2025-03-17, Discussion,"OK first of all, definition

Institutional memory is the collective experience of all the personnel in an organization to handle a given situation.  It's the biggest thing you lose when experienced personnel head for greener pastures and their replacements have to do their learning the hard way, with little in the way of mentorship.

Awkward and unsatisfactory outcomes in the short term are usually the consequence of losing your institutional memory.

With that said, here's what we know.

Haas is rolling around not just with 2 brand new drivers, but also 2 brand new race engineers.  Gary Gannon and Mark Slade are both gone, replaced by new voices that weren't on the F1 grid last year.

Furthermore, many of the technical people, including technical chief Andrea de Zordo, have only 1 year of experience as Komatsu purged the team of Steiner's people.

I suspect one of the big reasons that Haas came out so flat, and by ""flat"" I mean the lack of pace that was a problem for Haas even without the rain, is because they have very little actual F1 experience anywhere in their squad right now.  This culminated in delays and isses with putting the right adjustments into the car as everyone struggles to communicate with everyone else and a lot of people are just kinda trying to figure things out on the fly that an experienced person would simply know what to say, or what to do.  The result is chaos.

Last year you at least had longtime veterans dotting the roster, especially Slade, Nico and Kevin who all had many years of experience in the league.  And if, say, Gannon's side of the paddock had issues and he had to reach beyond his own experience to address a problem, Mark was right there to ask.  R

ight now the only experienced person anywhere in their front of house at Haas is Esteban, who was on a different team last year.  With everyone all figuring it out together, there's no one to really lean on when one side of the paddock or the other is struggling to crack a tough problem.

That strikes me as a situation where getting a reliable setup for their cars is going to be extra tricky because you just don't have that longstanding experience to fall back on if the first attempt doesn't work.

Like if a driver isn't happy with a given setup, you need engineers who can think 2-3 adjustments ahead in order to figure out what can be quickly tried to get them back on the track with a better setup than they had before, and I'm not sure the Haas team has that right now.

Throw in the fact that Bearman is a rookie and Ocon isn't a native English speaker, with the attending problems in providing reliable feedback in the first place, and you have a perfect storm of ""learning curve issues"" with communication, feedback and adjustments that could easily hold a team back.

The good news is that these may not be experienced people, but they are talented people who should climb the learning curve relatively quickly.  Unfortunately for many of them, ""relatively quickly"" in this sport can be measured in seasons, not races.  By throwing so many inexperienced personnel into the deep end at once I think Haas may be in a situation where they're forced to use this year as a pure shakedown and focus almost exclusively on 2026, which is a pity for those of us who hoped for bigger things..","[""It definitely can't have helped. Getting both two new drivers and two new race engineers is a lot. Especially when 3 out of the 4 are essentially rookies in their field.\n\nBut Haas are also just tied to Ferrari development. When Ferrari aren't strong, like they don't seem to be now, Haas are always down as well."", ""I'm sure someone will compile the laptime comparison charts and show how much laptime improvements each team has gained after we have had a couple of dry races. But my initial impression is that Haas has simply missed the boat and especially VCARB and Williams have gained even more relatively vs the top 4 teams let alone vs Haas and Alpine. In quali there were 17 cars within 1 sec from each other at some point, and that's almost unheard of in F1 history...\n\nCan't really blame it on the drivers though. Ollie had 6 (FP) weekends/races with the team last year, so he knows exactly how the current car compares to the previous one, including setups quirks. Ocon is a veteran nowadays and is at least or even more fluent in English than the likes of Barichello, Kimi and Massa who were known to give good feed back and were credited by drivers/TPs of developing the car or making setups."", "">Furthermore, many of the technical people, including technical chief Andrea de Zordo, have only 1 year of experience as Komatsu purged the team of Steiner's people.\n\nI thought this was odd last year when people were praising Komatsu for the performance of a car designed & built by Gunther's people in the offseason. 2023's was already fast over one lap but terrible in the race, 2024 managed to build upon that and fix some of the race pace issues. \n\nOne race isn't season defining, but so far it feels like a step back."", 'Listening to the pit wall conversation with Ocon on him pushing to go back to slicks was frustrating. The wall needed to take charge (because they have a weather radar in front of them) rather than Ocon in that situation.\n\nI’m sure it will work itself out in due time, but it’s better to find and identify the issues now than after 16 races', ""Great assessment. I wasn't aware that Ayao got rid of so many veterans in the team--didn't he actually say in an interview or something that he wanted to promote people in-house, especially those who stayed loyal with Haas for all these years? And he didn't want look outside the team?"", 'Very well thought out post and it’s a very good point.\xa0', ""Haas isn't really incentivized to do much this year. With so much change and a new rule book next year, they might as well throw it all into Next Year's Car^(TM)."", 'All very good points, but Ocon should very much be counted as veteran and should be able to give good feedback. His language skills are as far as I can judge it on par with many of the other non-english on the grid.\n\nAlso the Ferrari parts on the Haas should be factored in. Your point makes this even stronger as they probably rely even stronger on Ferrari experience.', ""They're hanging on just waiting for the Toyota buyout.""]",37,35,0.71,37,113,113,3,0,0.010000000000000009,3

I would have assumed they’d go through several simulated races with various scenarios—letting the race progress, reacting to changes, making all the calls they normally would—before the season starts.
