1gzqsgt,How Colton Herta is personally linked to Cadillac/General Motors' F1 entry and how he can obtain a FIA Super License to race in F1 as early as next week.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzqsgt/how_colton_herta_is_personally_linked_to/,2024-11-25, Discussion,"**The first question may be ""*why Colton Herta specifically for Cadillac F1?*"".**

Colton Herta is a current Andretti driver, he is American, he's fast and he's a fan favorite in IndyCar. But this is not all.

Colton is personally sponsored by a big insurance group called Group 1001 and he is one of their biggest ambassadors. His IndyCar is infact sponsored by Group 1001 and Gainbridge (a Group 1001 company)

Colton got this sponsorship via Dan Towriss, the CEO of Group 1001. Dan is a big personal supporter of Colton.

This circles back to Cadillac F1 as Dan Towriss has also recently become Andretti Global's CEO after the sidelining of Michael Andretti, and he's now the lead figure behind the General Motors entry in F1.

American driver on american car would be pretty big for marketing reasons, and Colton also combines this with natural speed (never fully exploited in IndyCar) and a personal connection to a soon-to-be F1 ""team owner"".

**How close is Colton Herta to obtaining a FIA Super License?**

Colton currently has 39 points, 1 short of the 40 points needed to obtain a Super License, thanks to the special COVID-19 exception that allows drivers to count their best 3 championship placements of the last 4 years, as long as 2021 is one of those years.

* 2021 - 8 pt (5th in IndyCar)

* 2022 or 2023 - 1pt (10th in IndyCar)

* 2024 - 30 pt (2nd in IndyCar)

**How can Colton get the necessary points for a super license ahead of the 2026 season?**

There are actually a lot of ways, I will list a few:

- Taking part in a single FP1 session in the next 2 F1 weekend, he would gain precisely 1 point.

This is unlikely. With only 2 races to go and a Sprint Race in Qatar, the only chance would be Abu Dhabi, but with such short notice it's hard to imagine this being possible.

If Colton does not get it this year, then a problem arises: entering the 2025 season the COVID-19 exception would expire and he would find himself with 31 points (1 pt from 2023, 30 pt from 2024). He would lack 9 points that can obtained in the following ways:

- Finishing 4th in IndyCar he would get 10 points. IndyCar is hard and extremely unpredictable. A bunch of unfortunate crashes can make the difference between finishing 3rd or 9th in the final standings, so this is risky.

- Completing 9 F1 FP1 sessions regardless of IndyCar placement would also guarantee him enough points. A driver can collect up to 10 points by doing 10 different FP1 sessions. IndyCar and F1 however often clash, getting all this seat time is very expensive and it's doubtful there are even this many FP1 sessions available to buy from other teams.

- The most realistic scenario then becomes a mix of the above. For example finishing 7th in IndyCar and doing 5 FP1 sessions would be enough and logistically easier to coordinate.

- There is also the possibility of competing in more a series in a single year: a driver can also get points for multiple (2) championship in a single calendar year, and the FIA ladder has multiple ""farmable"" championship in the off-season. The *Asian Le Mans Series* for example is a 3 events endurance championship held between December/February that gives 10/8/6/4/2 points. All seats are filled in LMP1 for the first weekend, but maybe they can be bought out.

Overall there are many ways, some more convoluted than others and some riskier than others, but it's not unrealistic for Herta to be in the 2026 Cadillac F1 team.","['The FIA could also just grant Herta the same exemption they gave Colapinto, who was also on 39 points, and give him a super license tomorrow.', ""He just needs to have a good season in 2025 then it sorts itself out. As long as he finishes at least 6th it shouldn't be a problem."", 'Which F1 team is going to let a rival driver do 5 x FP1 sessions?', 'cadillac is just andretti renamed right? or is it a completely new entity?', 'If Colton Herta really wanted a super licence he’d just run the Toyota series in NZ, that would give him the points (and extra buffer points) for under 200k in the space of a month in the off season for all the other series.

Instead, Michael Andretti is out, Mario Andretti is relegated to a non-executive board position, and GM have agreed to pay more than double the original anti-dilution feed.

So where originally it was an Andretti car that would eventually hope to run a General Motors engine, but would have customer Renaults to begin with, the project being put on the table now is nothing like that.

It sounds like Andretti wanted to enter his team and GM had the option of developing an engine to supply them with from 2028, but they weren't obligated to provide it. So if the Andretti team wasn't doing as well as expected or if they could get a better deal from an existing supplier, then GM would be able to write off or repurpose whatever engine development they had done. If I'm being charitable, then I have to say that that feels a bit misleading because Andretti's complaint was that they were being frozen out, but giving GM the option of engaging means that they weren't being completely honest. At worst, it sounds like a bit of a Trojan horse where Andretti uses the promise of an GM engine to enter the sport in 2028, but they never have the intention of using a GM engine -- and they get to keep their entry even when the GM engine never materialises.\n\nThat might sound like splitting hairs, but it would go a long way towards explaining why Formula 1 never really responded to the investigation and how they were able to broker a new deal with GM directly instead of capitulating and letting Andretti in on his terms."", 'Fom always stated that a entry of GM would maybe be successful.

The merits of Max’s commentary aside, I feel like Leclerc is undervalued in his championship potential. IMO he has the most going for him for a viable title challenge to Max under the right circumstances, which may be where we find ourselves in 2025. He had more top 5 finishes than Lando this year (Lando just had more P1 or P2 to gain a points advantage) which demonstrates more consistency, he’s had moments of pure brilliance that I haven’t seen with Lando, and many of his poorer finishes were due to team strategy and other factors.

1gzqpr6,Is it time for a  new points system ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzqpr6/is_it_time_for_a_new_points_system/,2024-11-25, Discussion,"A few months a there were  rumours that the  FIA was considering changes to the points by expanding it to 12 positions by reducing the gaps from 7th--12th to one point, though nothing came out of ir

Now that Cadillac has been confirmed for 2026 , I think it's a good time for the FIA to consider changing the points system . Especially since there was a result just a few weeks back ( Alpine double podium) that exposed the flaws of the current system. Its rewards freak results from weaker teams and punishes their consistency.


I have had a system in mind that would expand points to the top 14. I think that would enough to reward consistency and protect the standings against freak results.  It goes like this

1. 40
2. 30
3. 25
4. 20
5. 17
6. 14
7. 12
8. 10
9. 8
10. 6
11. 4
12. 3
13. 2
14. 1

This points progressively increase the gap for every milestone ( top 10, top5 , podium, win). This system also more else maintains the ratios between two places, atleast within the top 5.

I would also a like a point for pole. I think it's disappointing to see efforts like Magnussen in Brazil 2024 go completely unrewarded and the fact the pole means absolutely nothing at tracks like COTA. Its far fairer than the Fastest lap point and won't matter that much when the winner gets 40 points. The only disadvantage I can think of is that it leaves for the championship to be decided on a Saturday, but let's be real in that scenario the championship was already over before qualifying

Now I know full well that development has already started on the new cars so this is probably just a pipe dream but good God would I kill to see what teams could come to winning ways with an extra year of these regulations 

And obviously with the recent announcement of GM joining this is guaranteed not going to happen (not that the odds were high to begin lol)


Would love you to hear everyone else's opinion on this

EDIT: id like to start by saying some of you on here need to settle down and read the post first

Now of course I know that teams like McLaren and Ferrari may be able to rival red bull ( if they are still dominating by then) in 2026 with the new regs and I am excited to see what Aston Martin can cook up with the genius mind of Adrian newey and that brand new wind tunnel and factory
