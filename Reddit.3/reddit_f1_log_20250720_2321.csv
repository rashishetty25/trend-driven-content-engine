1m4slu1,Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps 1994 photos,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m4slu1/belgian_grand_prix_at_spafrancorchamps_1994_photos/,2025-07-20, Throwback,"These photos I took during the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps 1994, during a rainy free practice or qualification day, I'm not sure anymore.

In the Benneton there was Michael Schumacher and Jos Verstappen.

In the Williams you can see Damon Hill (whom I was a fan of at the time, not anymore). His teammate was David Coulthard.

Ferrari drove with Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi.



Some of the photos were made during the pit walkabout.

The photos from the cars on track were made from the inside of the track at Eau Rouge/Raidillon from the top of a building.

Notice that year, the Eau Rouge/Raidillon was rather 'tamed', meaning a sort of chicane was put in place to reduce speeds, following Senna's and Ratzenberger's deadly accidents earlier in the season. On the latest photo it is clearly visible.","['What does it say after ‚ÄúI miss you Aryton‚Äù', 'Fantastic time capsule', 'Amazing! I was there in 1995 as a 10 year old.
