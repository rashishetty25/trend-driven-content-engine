1j2t5n9,A brief history of the rumours of Lewis to Ferrari‚Ä¶,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j2t5n9/a_brief_history_of_the_rumours_of_lewis_to_ferrari/,2025-03-03, Discussion,"In a new article with Autohebdo (sadly paywalled, I will post a link in the comments) Fred Vasseur says the following:

 *""We both started talking about it at the Monaco GP 2023, on May 28, my birthday to be precise. I quickly realized that it could happen. I knew that the desire was there on his side, that it had always been there in fact. It wasn't possible on our side for 2024, because we had both our drivers under contract. Lewis had always had Ferrari in the back of his mind, and I thought the planets were aligning. For me, having Lewis associated with Charles was one more stone in the edifice.""*

I remembered vaguely that there were some rumours about this at the time, and looking back there were indeed rumours - but crucially, these were *before* the May 28th date that Vasseur gives.

Daily Mail‚Äôs Jonathan McEvoy initially reported this on the 22nd -

*‚ÄúEXCLUSIVE: Ferrari are set to offer Lewis Hamilton ¬£40MILLION deal to race in red next season and the chance to eclipse hero Michael Schumacher - with chief John Elkann already in close contact with the British driver‚Äù*

With plenty of subsequent discussion on this by various outlets - opinion pieces as to whether Lewis should consider ditching Mercedes, whether he would be right to move to Ferrari, 

Lewis denied the rumours on the 25th, in the press cons before Monaco:

*Hamilton answered with a blunt and unhesitant ‚Äúno‚Äù when asked if he had been approached by Ferrari.*

And Fred also denied this on the 25th:

*Asked if he had talked with Hamilton, or would he, Vasseur answered: ""We didn't have discussions. I think every single team on the grid would like to have Hamilton at one stage, it would be bull**** to not say something like this.*

On the 28th, Toto suggested the story was planted to influence negotiations that were then ongoing around the renewal of Lewis‚Äô Mercedes contract:

*""We've had a pact - and we've had that since many, many years - that we wouldn't talk to any other driver before we have taken a decision to stay together or not, so I was never a millimetre in doubt that there were any discussions,"" Wolff said. ""Someone just placed that (story), maybe to, in a way, to play a role in what seemed to be negotiation, but it is not negotiation, it is sitting at a table and saying, 'what is it we need to adapt to in the contract?' So there's nothing to it.‚Äù*

However, now Fred says this is the day they began talking!

I wonder if the discussion about it made them decide to pursue ;)","['Lewis to Ferrari confirmed', 'I love this investigative journalism', 'AutoHebdo paywalled article the first quote stems from - [‚ÄúI do what I love with the two drivers I dreamed of having!‚Äù](https://www.autohebdof1.com/news/other-races/carpooling/frederic-vasseur-i-do-what-i-love-with-the-two-pilots-i-dreamed-of-having.html)', 'this is the kind of insightful content that i love about this community. thanks op!', 'Sainz really stood no chance lol', 'Gentlemen, a short view back to the past.', 'It took 5 races as a TP for Vasseur to look to replace Sainz.
