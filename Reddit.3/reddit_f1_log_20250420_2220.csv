Here‚Äôs the breakdown (Stroll‚Äôs Q1 exits listed first each year compared to teammate):

	‚Ä¢	2017 ‚Äì Massa: 11 - 3
	‚Ä¢	2018 ‚Äì Sirotkin: 15 - 16
	‚Ä¢	2019 ‚Äì Perez: 14 - 7

	‚Ä¢	2022 ‚Äì Vettel: 11 - 10

	‚Ä¢	2024 ‚Äì Alonso: 5 - 3
	‚Ä¢	2025 ‚Äì Alonso: 3 - 0

Total: Stroll ‚Äì 74 | Teammates ‚Äì 46

My count gets to 74 instead of 75 so there‚Äôs a qualifying elimination that I‚Äôve missed out but it‚Äôs largely accurate. 

Vettel in 2022 was a bit of a surprise with nearly as many Q1 exits as Stroll. But overall, his record relative to teammates hasn‚Äôt looked quite as dire since 2020.

It shows how hard it might be for the McLarens to overtake here, as they have a below average speed in most sectors, except Oscar in Intermediate 1 and Lando at the finish line. Their overall maximum speed is below average for both drivers.

The second image is the same data and shows speed differential to the driver above them on the grid (Driver Ahead) for each sector and the speed trap, as well as where they sit within the field (Ave).

Oscar has no sectors in the green, which means his speeds are average or below average. Lando is solidly 14th in all sectors and the speed trap, apart from the finish line, where he is first.

Max and Yuki have all sectors in the green.

George only has one sector in the green, Intermediate  2 and Kimi is the same.

Charles has all sectors in the green, apart from the finish line. Lewis is green in all sectors, so it shows he is losing time in corners.

At no point on the track is Oscar faster than Max, though if he has DRS, it might change things.

For Lando, his maximum speed is slower than 7 of the 9 drivers ahead of him, with only Oscar and Kimi slower. As above, he is fastest at the finish line. In Intermediate 1, only Kimi is slower of those ahead of him, and in Intermediate 2, only Oscar is slower.

Hope you like this. Will be interesting to see if cornering speed and tyre management will be enough for McLaren to overcome their speed deficit.

Why and how Verstappen won the penalty both ways when he takes the exact opposite role?"", 'Fantastic launch by Piastri', '""He\'s won the corner"". Why? The moment Karun paused at the apex, Max is right alongside. Yes, max has more speed, but he\'s also coming from all the way on the outside of the corner where the racing line is, allowing him to carry more speed. I think it\'s really not as slam dunk as people make it out to be.', 'Imo, Oscar had that corner and Verstappen absolutely gained an advantage leaving the track \n\nIgnore my flair, but I might be a little bias', 'While I agree max was never making that corner, I fins the way you can muscle people off the road if you ahead at the apex frustrating. It just leads to bad and unsporting racing. This is not how other series do it.', ""There are a few problems with how these situations are being judged.\n\nSo the idea behind any ruling of this kind these days is that the car ahead at the apex is entitled to the corner.\n\nFine, now here are the problems with this. Corners have multiple apexes, depending on the line you're taking. In a situation such as this, where a car is on the inside, while the other is on the outside, the apexes will differ. So this is not a good benchmark to begin with. \n\nNot only that, but chicanes are actually a nightmare in this situation. Same scenario - two cars alongside each other. The one on the inside has ths entry. Fine. The problem is that the car on the outside upon entry has the better line for the exit out of the chicane. And that's what I hate the most about this situation. Everybody, from the fans to the stewards act like this ain't actually a thing. \n\nThe rulings they always dish out in these scenarios clearly indicate that they expect the car that has the worse line upon entry to yield the whole chicane. But nobody has the guts to actually lay it out in writing. To actually turn it into a rule. Because how the hell would you tell racing drivers to yield two corners based on a relative benchmark?\n\nNow with regards to the Verstappen-Piastri situation.  Please don't come at me with the 'Max would've never made the corner' nomsense. That's the single dumbest take I've seen within the F1 community since 2021.\n\nHe obviously did make the corner. He didn't go out because he had too much speed. He went out because Oscar took the optimal line throughout the whole chicane. Now, yet again, if the standard for chicanes is indeed that the car with the optimal line upon entry is entitled to the whole thing, then fine. I don't agree with it, but turn it into a rule. We don't even have this. We only have rulings that act as if this is what the regulations say, but they don't.\n\nI think Max was a bit too ambitious, however I really dislike how Oscar acts as if the chicane was entirely his. The fact is that he wasn't actually ahead at the apex, which is why people keep spreading around the whole 'Max wouldn't have made the corner nonsense'. They are aware of it, they just pretend that Max was alongside/ahead simply because he bombed into the corner. It's clearly not the case. \n\nIf you don't like Max's behavior in t1, which I can see why, then you shouldn't like Oscar's behavior in t2 either. He clearly had not attention to leave any space and acted as if he was a full car length ahead.\n\nIf they didn't take any action against Hamilton in Abu Dhabi 2021, then they shouldn't have taken any here as well. \n\nThe truth is that Max has a solid case in claiming that he was pushed out. Because he clearly was, midway through the chicane.

All this ""ahead at the apex"" stuff is utter BS. In every other motorsport in the world, the rule is that if 2 cars are side by side going into a corner, both cars must leave a cars width of space for the other car throughout the duration of the corner. It doesn't matter who got to the corner first, if they are side by side under breaking, they must leave space. Piastri didn't do that.

The way the rules are currently makes F1's racecraft look like a joke despite being the pinicle of motorsport. And I should know, the driving standards in Nascar right now leave a lot to be desired, but this is ridiculous. What Piastri did today would have been penalized in Imsa, Wec, Indycar, etc... or at the very least, no penalty and let Verstappen keep the place. Not only are the current rules stupid, but they actively hurt the racing product because drivers can't race side by side for an extended time because one of them will be forced off track. This isn't even the only incident of this manner. Look at Verstappen and Norris at Cota last year, or Verstappen and Lewis at Abu Dhabi in 2021. This has been a problem for a long time.

Its not filming a rock take off. The amount of data traveling during a race is monumental. We have to glad about the quality we are getting now compared to the static mess from 20-30 years ago. Also inside helmet cams are incredible tech and will only get better.', '""The outside shots looks ok, but the onboard shots look awful.""\n\nThat expectation is exactly the problem. You cannot expect tiny, lightweight onboard cameras subject to wind, vibration, G forces, etc. that also need to transmit live wirelessly at 200 mph with no direct line of sight to the receiver at times with the signal distorted by all manner of obstacles (other cars, bridges, metal structures, concrete structures, etc.) to have the same quality as expensive, heavy, professional cameras mounted on expensive rigs and connected to stationary\xa0broadcast equipment.\n\nLet me guess: you probably complain that the front-facing camera on your phone is not as good as your rear-facing camera(s).', ""It's normal. Better imagine quality required better optics. Better optics required more space AND weight. The cars are sensitive to weight so the lenses in the cars are small and the quality is lower than dedicated TV cameras.\n\nP.S and not to mention the image sensor""]",0,52,0.2,0,476,476,0,0,0.0,0
