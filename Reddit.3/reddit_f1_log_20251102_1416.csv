1oltpi0,"What's your ""Formula 1 Mandela Effect""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oltpi0/whats_your_formula_1_mandela_effect/,2025-11-01, Discussion,"For those not familiar with the term - something you *definitely* remember happening but didn't actually happen, or has only come to light after the fact, or is misattributed.

EDIT - to make clear, a simple explanation of what the Mandela effect is, here - [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/False\_memory](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory)

Two that I was just thinking of as they came up in other threads -

1. The famous video of the ""headbutting mechanic"" - after Massa's family mistakenly celebrated him winning the championship, a mechanic in the garage (presumably on a radio loop) told them he hadn't, and their faces were shown in utter horror. As we know, the mechanic [then headbutted a partition wall in the garage, shattering a glass Ferrari logo](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/p1e3nx/ferrari_mechanic_headbutts_a_wall_brazil_08/). The thing is - this was never shown on the original feed and the video only came to light later on. In the thread about F1 putting the final laps of that race on Youtube yesterday, a few people swear they remember it being shown live and assume it has been cut out.
2. No one can find the source of ""riding around Monaco is like riding a tricycle around your living room"" quote, which is repeated seemingly every year around the time of the Monaco Grand Prix. It's normally attributed to Nelson Piquet, though I've seen it attributed to Keke Rosberg, Nigel Mansell, and even Schumacher. ""Tricycle"" is often changed to ""bicycle"" too. Yet no one seems to know who said it first, and there's no record of anyone ever saying it in an interview.","['Fernando didn’t say “I knew he would brake because he has a wife and kids at home”.

1omcv1n,I made a website to compare quali and race H2H between any teammates,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1omcv1n/i_made_a_website_to_compare_quali_and_race_h2h/,2025-11-02, Statistics,"I made a simple web app to compare a driver’s results with his teammate which I wanted to share with the community. It started as a way to view qualifying H2H and getting stats such as mean/median (hence it being called f1teammatequali), but recently I added the option of comparing race data too.



You can see how well a driver did against their teammate: 

* over a season
* over all qualifying sessions/races they took part in as teammates
* against all his teammates over the years at a particular circuit



For qualifying, I compared times from sessions both drivers participated in. I.e. if driver A made it to Q3 and driver B got out in Q1, then their Q1 times were used.



There is also a fourth feature where you can see how far off a driver's best time is from the fastest driver for every quali session in a season, or how far away from P1 a driver finished in the race. I thought it would be interesting to see how the gap to the fastest changes over a year (like how Verstappen closed in on Mercedes in 2020).



For sessions marred by outliers or anomalies, you can deselect that entry, and the H2H, stats, and charts will update instantly.



I hope you like it! If you have ideas for any new features you think would be interesting to see, then lmk.



[https://www.f1teammatequali.com/](https://www.f1teammatequali.com/) 



Note:

The web app is reliant on data fetched from the Jolpica (formerly Ergast) API. Only data from the 1994 season onwards is available for qualifying. There is also a lot of qualifying data from the late 90s and early 2000s missing. There are no such problems with race results data. 



If a driver doesn't set a time in a qualifying session, the API often nulls the entry for that session. This means results like Norris v Piastri in Saudi 2025 was recorded as a Norris win because the program compared their Q2 times instead of Q3 (in which Norris crashed) where he was faster than Piastri. The result should’ve gone to Piastri as he kept his car in one piece and qualified ahead, but as far as the data is concerned, Norris didn't take part in Q3 as his Q3 entry was empty, which is why the script defaulted to comparing Q2 times. If you find other results that you know are incorrect, keep this reason in mind as for why. ","['OP how much does it cost you each month to run this website?\n\nGood work btw love it.', ""Hey, that's really awesome! I have one suggestion, instead of comparing between the drivers of the same team, why not just provide the option to select drivers from any team.\n\nBecause in the current design, if we are selecting a team, there's no need to select drivers, it could be shown directly.\n\nHope it helps!"", 'Very cool but it gets fucky after you play around with it for a little bit and you have to reload the site.', 'This is an excellent resource that I have been using for the last while.\xa0\n\nHowever, only yesterday I was discussing Ricciardo vs Norris in 2021 with somebody and it seems some of your figures are incorrect?\n\nAnd taking another look through it now, there does seem to be the odd inconsistency. ~~For example Miami 2023 is given in Verstappen’s favour rather than Perez when that is straight up incorrect~~\xa0\n\n[edit] thanks for clearing that one up.\n\nI hope this doesn’t sound too critical because this is still a really good web app and the vast majority of figures are hopefully correct.', 'Love it.

4. What were the \*real bottlenecks\*? (e.g., slow approvals, unclear ownership, data duplication)
5. How were test results (CFD/tunnel/telemetry) linked back to design versions? Was this manual or automated?
6. Did your team have standardized release gates or was the process person-dependent?
7. How did priority change when upgrades needed to be rushed for a race week?

1om82ax,Massa's court case can potentially be the best thing to happen to F1 -- Hear me out.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1om82ax/massas_court_case_can_potentially_be_the_best/,2025-11-02, Discussion,"The F1 fanbase is currently in a community-wide argument over whether Massa has a *sporting right to be declared the champion of 2008.* And while there are unquestionably good arguments either way that can form an interesting discussion, I think people are somewhat missing the boat on what could be, by far, the most important aspect of this investigation for anyone not named ""Felipe Massa"" and/or ""Lewis Hamilton"".

  
What is crucial to understand about this case is that it is **not** about ""fairness"" and which of the title contenders deserved the trophy in their hands. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Massa himself sees motivation for the case in the belief that he should've been the righteous winner of that year's championship. ***But crucially, it's not what the case is based upon. Not quite.***

  
And that really should be quite obvious, I mean, it has been often brought up how long it took Massa to file a legal case for his championship, but no one seems to ask why that is? Do people think he just woke up one morning feeling like he deserved the championship? Of course not. For 15 years Massa kept his mouth shut in either the belief or the acknowledgement that there was no way to show that he was wronged by the FIA themselves. It might be, for the sake of clarity, worth bringing up Mercedes' protest for the end of the 2021 season here - Their conclusion is that what happened was a ""human error"" and thus not liable to being changed, a controversial claim that I myself disagree with.

  
But the thing is, it's precisely that idea that kept Massa quiet for years, and that he's trying to fight now, based on evidence that suggests a completely different reason for appeal. His case isn't about deserving-ness, it's about **corruption**.

  
If it turns out that Ecclestone's declarations form a solid ground for a serious investigation, it will be one that moves way past beyond what one may consider fair or not, but rather dive deep into the legitimacy of the FIA as a fair governing body for the biggest sport in racing. In a way that either solidifies the legitimacy of F1 as a sport, or exposes it's corruption to everyone, forcing their hands into reforming themselves into a differently-ran organization.

  
Beyond mere sporting discussion about whether it is fair to change the championship's results 17 years later (they probably won't either way) I find it legitimately impossible to balance a view that a governing body should be in constant observation to deny it the opportunity for corurption, with a condemnation against what Massa is doing right now.

  
Of course, for Massa himself it probably is about the championship and I have no intention of trying to deny this affirmation. But for the rest of us this is a geniune opportunity of forcing the FIA to face it's potential corruption directly.","[""It's not corruption. It's not about corruption. It's about whether the FIA knew about the cheating before the end of the season, and whether the FIA sporting code would have called for the nullification of the Singapore GP results.
