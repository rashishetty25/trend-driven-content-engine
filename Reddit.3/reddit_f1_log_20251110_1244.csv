I'm just giving my opinion on ‘Do I think it's going to be as easy?’ I won last weekend by 30 seconds, very, very easy. I won today by pushing a lot more, only 10 seconds, and Max was probably the quickest out on track today.

Do I think that at a track that we've never been good at, we were very good here two years ago, we almost challenged Max for the win, we've never been good in Vegas. So why am I going to think, ‘Yeah, it's going to be fine, whatever?’ I'm giving my opinion, I'm giving my honest opinion on how I think we're going to be. We've never been good there, so I'm not the most confident about going into this race.

Maybe I'll win, then we'll see. But I'm not going to lie and say ‘Yeah, I'm very confident and I think it's going to be an easy weekend’ because I don't think that's how it's going to be.

This year hasn't been great, but it's not the absolute worst season of Ferrari. They had worse ones. For example, 2020, when they had the worst result since 40 years. They had worse one in 2014, when alonso had to drive the most unstable car in f1 that had unique ability to understeer and oversteer at the same time. 

I just watched brazilian GP after another double DNF, but it's not like Ferrari is fighting for anything. Their real last chance is gonna be in Las Vegas. 

But there have definitely been a lot more painful moments for Ferrari team than today's race or double dsq in China. 

Like the image from Singapore 2017 or Vettel's crash in Germany 2018 or Leclerc's engine failures in 2022 alongside his crash in France that destroyed his chances for title.

I have no idea as to if this is against the rules or not (as this is more of a rant instead of a technical writeup), but I'd assume it does due to this being a writeup about how the Brazilian GP is like to the locals - as whiny as it might sound like.

For some ungodly reason, [ENEM (acronym translates to National High School Exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_M%C3%A9dio), basically an SAT-type exam with 90 + 90 questions and an essay over two Sundays that students take in order to either get into federal/public college, or get a scholarship/free ride into private college) also takes place this Sunday and the next. An issue that has been true since the Brawn GP days [(there's literally a news article from 2010 about students from Zona Sul (the region near Interlagos) having a hard time getting to the exams due to the increased traffic from F1)](https://g1.globo.com/educacao/noticia/2010/11/formula-1-prejudica-estudantes-do-enem-na-zona-sul-de-sp.html)
For very obvious reasons, traffic jams are extremely common near the school/college buildings the exam takes place at all over the country, and due to São Paulo being a gigantic city this issue compounds even further there. If the roads and the subway system are already crowded enough in a regular day, then it gets absolutely bizarre during F1 week, even more so with ENEM and this is compounded even further when we factor in other events/shows that normally take place nearby (like the Morumbis stadium or Allianz Parque).

However, ENEM can't take place in January because that'd be too close a deadline for the grades to be up and ready to be released by February (when colleges and universities start taking new students), and by December all schools/colleges are on summer break, which leaves us with November. Specifically, the one Sunday in where the F1 circus shows up with almost 300k fans in tow (because logistical issues regarding the calendar and weather mean the Brazil GP has to happen in early November). Not even considering other events like Linkin Park's show because those are far and between, only ENEM that takes place literally every year since 1998.

Of course foreigners can take a plane to São Paulo and back (as such only dealing with the local and foreigner traffic inside the city), but locals will most likely be going to the GP by car, which means dealing with both F1 and Linkin Park traffic.

Seriously... this has been an issue for almost 20 years, it would've been way more manageable both for the locals driving to their jobs, the locals taking ENEM, the foreigners and the locals going to the GP if both events didn't take place in the exact same weekend. Specially because the city of São Paulo are the ones funding the GP, meaning they absolutely have incentive to make sure the dates don't clash.","[""An exam taking place on Sunday, especially in a Christian country, is wild to me.\n\nSaturday it's ok, but placing a school event on Sunday in Italy would mean riot as here it's meant as a no school day."", 'As much as I love to watch the race, having high school students suffer with traffic etc to get to their exams is painful to see.

1osip54,Red Bull's tyre strategy in Qualifying,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osip54/red_bulls_tyre_strategy_in_qualifying/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"TLDR: Max failed to reach Q2 because Red Bull put him on high fuel and made him do 2 quali laps while everyone else did 1. 

I watched the Quali yesterday and saw all the discussions and memes till now. But I didn't see anyone criticising Red Bull for their horrendous management of Max in Q1. Feel free to correct me.

Q1 started with Max going out very early and being one of the first drivers to do a hot lap. He does one and puts the car outside Top 5 but still in a decent position. He then pits early. 

While he is in pits, everyone else goes out and put their respective times on board as the track ramps up. This includes Tsunoda who benefits from the same. Then everyone pits after their first lap, including Yuki. 

After everyone pits except Lewis, Max goes out again and does a hot lap. His car slides in Turn 9 which costs him 0.5 second. He improves but only to P16. 

Now this is the critical part. He does a cooldown lap while everyone else is still in the pits. Then he does another cooldown lap. Then he goes for his second hot lap while everyone comes out of pits, including Yuki. 

So he had more fuel than others, enough to do 2 cooldown laps and a hot lap. And his tyres were also worn down compared to everyone else using brand new set of tyres for only one lap. 

Despite this, Max only misses out by half a tenth in his second and final hot lap. He misses out Q2 by just one position. Even Yuki with a fresh set of tyres is slower by 2 or 3 tenths. 

If Red Bull had put him on low fuel and allowed him to do a single hot lap and then pitted him for a second time, he could've put a better time easily. Granted that Max made a mistake in first hot lap but there was 5 minutes left. It was enough to pit and go out again for another hot lap. 

Red Bull clearly ran a different strategy for Max. They wanted him to either save a third set of softs or believed that the soft tyre could last that long, which doesn't make sense because everyone else, including Yuki, only did one lap on softs in the end. 

This is also not the first time that they have fumbled the qualifying strategy. Max wasn't able to do a second hot lap in Austin because he went out too late. Yuki has also been a victim recently. ","['well, >99% of the time, Verstappen will be good enough to make it through with those used softs. Yesterday not. Shit happens', ""He's not made it out because the car is difficult to drive and he's made mistakes because of it. His first lap of his final run would have probably got him through to Q2 without the slide at T9.\n\nIf they'd sent him out with only 1 lap of fuel and he'd had the same T9 slide he would have been P18 instead of P16, so the slide is the issue (which will have also damaged his tyres more and hurt his second lap), not the plan itself.\n\nThe other side of this is that the driver usually has input into the plan for Qualifying, and Max has a lot of power at Red Bull, so I very much doubt they sent him out early with extra fuel without getting him to agree to it."", ""Was he slow because of the strategy or because they completely fumbled the car's setup? I'd say it seems to be more the latter."", 'The driver also has input in the qualifying strategy. They took a risk to change the setup from FP and the sprint, after Max complained, and Max probably wanted two laps to feel the new car setup.', 'So you mean he did almost or exactly the same run plan that Norris did yesterday in q3 that resultet in two times fast enough for pole?\n\nSounds not like the run plan was the biggest issue here. 🤷\u200d♂️', ""Red Bull also didn't use slipstreaming tactics in Mexico quali, which I can't understand if you still try to fight for the title.\n\nThey also used weird stragetys for Verstappen in the Zandvoort race, and were saved by safety cars.\n\nAnd the call to pit for hards in spain... yeah, no need to talk about it."", ""He had to go early to get a feel for the car that **Yucky Tooslowda** said was an improvement (they experimented with his car during the sprint race and he said: yeah, this is great!...smh). Max immediately knew that new setup was crap as well. The mistake RBR made was asking Tooslowda to test a setup for Max. Yucky has never been able to give decent feedback during his whole career, so why they would think anything he says about a car should be even close to what's really the case is beyond me."", ""Hadn't really paid attention to this (thanks for pointing it out), but I was definitely shocked to see that Q1 exit...because his first lap was around 0.2/0.3ish off the top before the track evo on USED softs. That definitely did not seem like a P16 final quali result at the time😅"", 'It was a fumble for sure but now they have a chance to work on the car and give him a new PU.']",12,21,0.59,12,115,115,-2,1,-0.020000000000000018,-2

I'm thrilled to introduce [metrikdelta.com](http://metrikdelta.com) a comprehensive F1 data analysis platform that I've developed with one core mission: making high level telemetry and race analytics accessible to every F1 enthusiast and complete features for new fans.

The platform is free to use I believe F1 data should be accessible to the community that makes this sport so special. There's an optional premium tier (€4.99/month) for Studio Pro content creation tools, but all analysis features remain completely free.

The site is fully mobile-responsive but I recommend desktop experience, and covers all recent seasons. Data is sourced through FastF1, And Jolpica F1

This is a passion project, I would genuinely appreciate your feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism. What features would make this more useful for you? What analyses would you like to see? How can I improve the experience? I know the site is not perfect I have a lot to do but I will do my best

I hope metrikdelta can add value to your F1 experience.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Enjoy the rest of season (max max max), and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

However I found it hard to merge the car data and position data from fastf1 as each appears to have a bit of error, and simply merging doesn\'t work well. I tried a few interpolation methods and what I\'ve got now seems to be decent. I\'ve been comparing the results to the ""ghost"" animations that they sometimes show on the pre/post shows on F1 TV, but I\'m starting to suspect their animation suffers from the same interpolation issues, and where they show a driver gained time is not quite the right spots. This weekend they showed NOR and PIA side-by-side (instead of ghost) in their Q3 laps, and it matched my current method decently well. Here\'s the gap between the two, NOR gained time primarily at the end of sector 2 and start of sector 3. [https://ibb.co/TxTR5NMZ](https://ibb.co/TxTR5NMZ).

1oss6ag,Genuine question about midfielders vs top drivers battles...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss6ag/genuine_question_about_midfielders_vs_top_drivers/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I may not know much about racing, but this always baffles me every time I hear about ""generational drive"" from anyone (and today from Max).

Why oh why don't any midfielders even atempt to take on a fight with the top drivers? In my vision they lose nothing, and may gain A LOT. This was shown in Mexico by Bearman, in Brasil by Kimi. Often they are more than capable of standing their ground and defend, or at least slow down the car behind. The legendary Alonso wall, where he was able to keep WDC behind him for the whole race. 

Now it just looks like they've been waved a blue flag, the second they see Max, Lando, Oscar or Charles in the mirror, they instantly move out the way, abandon racing line, don't even try to keep their position.

This in my opinion undermines today's Max achievement of reaching P3 from pitlane. I mean if only 6 of 19 cars is even atempting to race you, and 2 of them crash before you even warm your tires... In these conditions Logan Sergeant could have a shot at WDC. Basically every race this season feels like watching two races happening at the same time - McLaren vs Mercedes vs Leclerc vs Verstappen, and the other race is all of the other cars just getting out of the way of the ""big boys"".

And again, before MV fans tear me apart - I'm not saying his drive wasn't impressive (although Kimi's defence was even more impressive), but to he completly honest with you... If he doesn't need to race 90% of the cars, it's not THAT impressive. And we shouldn't talk about ""generational drive"" when 3 of the cars are out and the rest just lets you pass by. It's just catching up to the top and then starting to race for real. I mean if somebody starts from the pitlane, then 15 cars crash, your only opponents are Saubers and Alpines, and you are in the 3rd fastest car on the grid, you can easly achieve P1 and on paper be the best driver in history. But are you really?

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  
I'm giving MV as an EXAMPLE here, I'm not saying it's exclusive to him. I also didn't like how Lawson just jumped out the way from Piastri instead of even attempting to defend. MV's example is just the most apparent, since there's all this talk about ""generational drive"".

What do you think? Cheers and please keep it civil. I don't want to start a fight, I just want to know your opinion.","['The drivers want the fastest way possible to the finish line. Fighting for 2 laps against a car that is always going to overtake you eventually only makes you lose time. Its just that', 'A car can lose seconds a lap defending.

Just finished watching the São Paulo Grand Prix, and I think a lot of people have noticed this too. McLaren’s driver dynamic looks completely different from how it started this season.

Oscar Piastri seemed to have the upper hand earlier in the year. He was adapting quickly to upgrades, putting together strong qualifying runs, and consistently finishing near the front. Lately though, he’s still in the top five but hasn’t really been in the fight for podiums. Lando Norris, on the other hand, looks like he’s hit another level. His race weekends are a lot cleaner, his strategies have been spot on, and all those early-season reliability issues are basically gone.

At one point, I honestly thought Piastri could be a dark horse for the title based on how well-rounded his performances were. But that form feels like a distant memory now. You don’t just lose the pace and confidence you’ve shown all season in five races. And it’s not like Norris suddenly learned something completely new overnight either.

So what’s changed? Has McLaren shifted development away from this year’s car and Piastri’s struggling to find the right setup window? If that’s the case, how is Norris unaffected, especially when early in the season the talk was that Piastri had adapted more naturally to the MCL38?

Curious what people think. Is this about setup direction, confidence, or something within McLaren’s current development path and race strategy choices?

","[""It is not unheard of - look at 2023 Perez. \n\nLando has clicked with the car and Oscar still hasn't got the later tracks nailed down."", 'It’s not like they’re equal drivers. Landos been in F1 far longer than Oscar, he’s basically a veteran. He’s used to the long seasons and especially last year prepared him for this one.\xa0\n\nBest thing that ever happened to Lando was facing that adversity last year with Max\xa0', 'The anomaly was Norris’s performance in the first part of the season.

But those 2 tenths means he can't beat Norris on his own, so he tries other things, tries to be more aggressive and that leads to mistakes that cost him even more.\xa0\n\n\nImo Norris used the pressure of the championship to become stronger, while piastri is being held back by it"", 'Lando is simply more experienced at these tracks in the second half.

1oss8yc,Booing at Brazil podium towards Norris,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss8yc/booing_at_brazil_podium_towards_norris/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"This is my first time posting and I think this is an important discussion to have as a standalone instead of in the daily threads.

Lando is a hated driver and obviously people have their favourites but booing especially when it’s podium time is a stretch. I am a Ferrari fan and think Lando is talented but I don’t like his attitude so it’s not like I am looking for reasons that he is “mistreated”. Max has received booing in the past as well and I disagree when that happens too but this time I thought I’d like to hear others opinions on this as well because i haven’t seen discourse around it.

Socials: I went on the f1 instagram page to see if there was any mention of it but instead the comments under posts where anti lando and pro everyone else - fine, people have their opinions, I am not too fond of him either BUT no mention of booing.

Disrespect: I come from a culture where sports and national anthems are sacred. Even if you hate a person or nation, when they are on a podium and ESPECIALLY when a national anthem is playing you sit quiet but as protest you can turn your back or walk away. During the podium I was watching F1 TV and Alex did his best to speak over the boos but it was overwhelming and obviously he had to stay quiet during the English national anthem. 

Another think to note is that I think it’s also disrespectful to the other drivers on the podium because it takes away from their experience. The biggest giveaway of this for me was poor Kimi. I was watching his reactions to the podium as it was only his second time and it’s obvious he is not as experienced on how to handle difficult situations like this one. You could see on his face when Lando was receiving the trophy and the boos were loud that he was deeply uncomfortable and tried to laugh it off when he received the trophy himself. I just thing it’s an awful situation for everyone involved.

I only became a fan post Covid  and generally there has been a shift in how crowds act nowadays in events. So my two questions for you are 1) does anyone know if booing in motorsport during podiums and anthems have always been a thing 2) what is your opinion on it","['Both Hamilton and Max were disliked in Brazil in a certain point of their careers, things change, it’s not something personal.', 'To quote Lando\n\n""Just ignore all the people talking crap about you""\n\nI don\'t think he cares if anyone boos and throws hissy fit anymore', ""I watched Lewis serenely tell booing crowds that they were the best fans in the world. Max was booed a whole lot, even back in his podium days but also in 2021 and 2022.\n\nHonestly, Brazil actually likes Lando a lot. They've cheered him on since his rookie year and loved him for defending that one Brazillian reporter a couple years ago. If you look at the fan stages, he had pretty good reception there.  \n  \nPeople just have their own horses in a championship fight. And some Brazillians probably like Max a lot more  - probably consider him one of their own now because of the in-laws."", 'If they care enough to boo you, you must be doing something right. Wear it like a badge of honor', ""I think it's ridiculous he's being booed but....\n\nVerstappen, Hamilton, Vettel all got booed. If Norris does what he's on course to do, he's just another Champion whose domination is pissing off people\n\nBelieve me, he won't give a shit if he wins"", '""I  come from a culture where sports and national anthems are sacred.""\n\n  \nSo you\'re not from Brasil?', 'Were those boos really for him? The trophy was presented to Lando by the governor of the state of São Paulo. He is a far-right extremist, extremely unpopular. So that’s questionable.', 'Booing has happened to many drivers: Max, Hamilton, Vettel', ""Even as a Lando fan, this conversation is sooo overdone. If anything, I welcome it considering this is the second weekend in a row he's won while facing the boos; it clearly motivates him to some extent lmao.\xa0"", 'Dude. People boo. Who cares, no need to white knight for your favorite millionaire.\xa0']",0,127,0.31,0,1488,1488,0,0,0.0,0
