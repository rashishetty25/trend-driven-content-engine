1o2i8jx,Alex Palou: 'I was upset and angry' when McLaren signed Piastri,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o2i8jx/alex_palou_i_was_upset_and_angry_when_mclaren/,2025-10-09, High Court witness statement,,"['What people forget about Oscar signing with McLaren was that Andreas Seidl really really wanted him. Even Palou just stated it was Seidl who ultimately wanted Oscar. Seidl was basically Oscar’s biggest supporter at McLaren.\n\nAlso thought it was bizarre at the time to have all of Palou, Herta and O’Ward at one point in the books. 3 don’t fit into 1 and that’s not accounting for Oscar.', ""It's amazing that the echos of Vettel's retirement are still ringing. Truly the silliest season."", 'The whole situation is so bizarre', 'Some interesting tidbits:\n\n> “I went for dinner with Zak at Beaverbook near MTC,” Palou’s witness statement reads. “Zak told me **it was not his decision to hire Oscar. He said it was the decision of the team manager Andreas Seidl.**\n\nPersonally, I don’t consider this particularly damning of Piastri or Brown. Seidl was the data-driven TP; he was the one able to assess Piastri‘s reserve driver work and potential ceiling. It’s understandable that marketing-focused Brown would be interested in at least exploring the possibility of an Indycar crossover sure to generate interest…Piastri was not a well-known figure at the time, and if marketing in Australia were McLaren’s priority they might as well have stuck with Ricciardo despite his performance. \n\nIt is a little funny, though, that 2 out of 3 2023 rookies were former teammates from outside Europe. both came up in the British karting and single-seater scene. both chosen for F1 seats by German TPs who wouldn’t be in f1 much longer and have BMW, VAG, Sauber, and McLaren on their CVs.\n\n\n> There had been some rumours in the media about AlphaTauri looking for a F1 driver and my name was in the mix…**[Helmut Marko] \nwas open to me driving for them, and asked for the conditions of my McLaren release** … I don’t know what happened in that conversation [between Marko and Brown], but for sure it didn’t help because suddenly Helmut was not interested anymore.\n\nI hope someone someday writes a longform piece detailing all of the options Marko explored for what eventually was de Vries’ AT seat. and how far each one went.', ""Imagine if Zak has to go to court and say he wasn't interested in Piastri."", '""Me too, Alex"" -Otmar, probably', ""I wonder how O'Ward felt, given he was already their driver and probably had similar talks."", ""I'm not going to pretend to know who was more at fault here.
