STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

1iwqacf,"Do we have a record lowest number of current drivers to have taken part in an earnest ""title battle""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iwqacf/do_we_have_a_record_lowest_number_of_current/,2025-02-24, Discussion,"Obviously, modern F1 fans are well aware of the level of net dominance we've seen in the past 15 years, with only 1 WDC winner since 2010 winning it fewer than 4 times. However, those 15 years have had very different outcomes, of some years seeing a straight cruise to the record books, versus others with a number of different drivers in contention right through the final race. 

Currently, our grid is not only very rookie-heavy, but the dominance over the most recent regulations cycle has dwindled the number of drivers to ever have taken part in an earnest title battle. 

At any point in any season, only Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, and Lando Norris have ever truly been in the running to win the WDC. Considering that 3 of them are champions themselves, that's a pretty surprising statistic. 

Considering that FOM themselves have hyped up long shots like Perez in 2023 or Bottas for a number of years, there are seasons in which a great deal of drivers have had more legitimate title shots than any of the other 15 drivers on this year's grid... but of course, with aspiring competitors in potentially top seats like Piastri, Lawson, Russell, and Antonelli, we may add to this list quickly! ","[""1994 post Senna's death and when Mansell wasn't present, there was zero drivers who had ever battled for a championship prior to 1994 let alone won one."", 'The first ever f1 season had no drivers to have previously been In a battle for an F1 Championship.', ""I think you would have to meaningfully define 'title battle' cause Leclerc challenged Verstappen in the start but faded. As did Norris."", 'We just need to not have one car way faster than the rest to start the season. Now when we practically have no mechanical retirements or major issues anymore, being even ~ 0.2, 0.3 ish seconds quicker a lap consistently can pretty much end the season in a few races.', ""2004 only had Schumi, Kimi that challenged for a WDC for 1 year and a washed Villeneuve who was a 1 time WDC.\n\nThat's worse than 3 multi WDCs who battled for multiple WDCs each and Lando who had a title battle last year."", ""2007 maybe? Only Alonso and Raikkonen had really been in proper title fights before that season. So that's (x2).\n\n\nThis year Leclerc has never really been in the running for a title yet and Norris was barely in the running at all last season because the field got way more competitive in the second half so a bunch of teams and drivers, including his own teammate, took wins and points away from him when a dominant car like Verstappen had early season would have given him a much better chance of catching up Verstappen's gigantic lead. I'd honestly say only Alonso, Hamilton and Verstappen have been in proper title fights on the current grid. Including Norris is incorrect IMO. So (x3).\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Just had a look back from 1994-2006. Looks about right give or take depending on what you call a credible title contender. I don't really class Villeneuve as a credible challenge to Hill in their dominant 1996 Williams for example. Some might think it's harsh but to me he was no challenge to Hill in the championship the whole season.\xa0\n\n\n1994 Senna, Mansell (x2).\n\n\n1995 Mansell, Schumacher (x2).\n\n\n1996-1997 Schumacher, Hill (x2).\n\n\n1998 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve (x3).\n\n\n1999 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve, Hakkinen (x4).\n\n\n2000-2001 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Hakkinen, Irvine (x4).\n\n\n2002 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Irvine (x3).\n\n\n2003 Schumacher, Villeneuve (x2).\n\n\n2004-2005 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen (x3).\n\n\n2006 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen, Alonso (x4)\n\n\nSo quite a few seasons during this time have had 2 previous title contenders on the grid."", ""will this year be pog to watch as someone who's never watched before?"", ""If the field was closer it would not have been that different, maybe Sainz/Russel , other than that who's good enough to be in the mix?"", ""Alboreto was on the grid during that time wasn't he? He'd battled for the title in 1985, though his challenge fell apart in the closing rounds due to Ferrari shitting the bed (I'd compare it to Vettel's 2017, for a modern reference point).""]",0,28,0.34,0,165,165,0,0,-0.019999999999999962,0
