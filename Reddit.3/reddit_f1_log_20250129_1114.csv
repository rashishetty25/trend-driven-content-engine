Behind Antonelli and George Russell will be Bottas, who has returned to Mercedes as a test and reserve driver.\n\nThe Finnish driver, who was at Sauber, was unable to find a place for himself in the next campaign, forcing him to take up a reserve role at his former team.\n\nIn an interview with [CasasDeApuestas.bet](http://CasasDeApuestas.bet), Montoya gave his opinion on the situation of the Mercedes drivers. ‘We have Kimi Antonelli on the other side of the coin, in the spotlight of one of the best teams, with a team-mate who is doing a great job’.\n\n‘He's being sold as the next Max Verstappen.

He's the safety net to have someone in case it doesn't work out with Antonelli and he knows that.’\n\nMercedes team boss Toto Wolff chose Antonelli over Carlos Sainz, who went to Williams. Wolff's decision, as he has stated several times, stems from the fact that he lost Max Verstappen when the Dutchman entered F1.\n\nVerstappen decided not to join Mercedes at the time because they couldn't offer him a place on the grid. Red Bull, however, was ready to bring Verstappen into F1 immediately after he joined Toro Rosso in 2015, and then transferred him to Red Bull at the start of 2016.\n\nWolff wasn't willing to risk Antonelli being poached by another team if he chose a veteran option like Sainz.\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'Bottas is about as good a backup as you could get, but there’s no way Antonelli doesn’t get at least a second season, regardless of how his first one turns out.', ""It is good for rookies to be given time, but Mercedes clearly want Kimi to be prepared, and to do that, they've given him about 10,000km on track, so like 38 Monaco GPs or 32 Monzas.

Antonelli is very young, he’s inexperienced and he didn’t exactly cover himself in glory in F2 last season. Mercedes have taken a massive gamble on an unproven kid who is very far from the finished article and there are no guarantees that he will succeed.']",1047,133,0.98,1047,1958,1958,18,0,0.0,18

It's not just a random rumour, that's why we decided to approve this post."", ""Genuinely, if this happens, it would out-silly every other silly season that I've seen.\n\nThis just can't be real."", ""It'd be typical Fernando luck to leave Aston right before they produce a championship-calibre rocketship, just to toddle around the midfield in a mediocre Red Bull car. El Plan indeed 😄"", ""Tbh I don't take this for just another story, given as Mark Hughes said; it would make a lot of sense. I do find 2026 a strange year to go to AM. If there aren't any external factors playing a big part, a switch after 2026 would make more sense given Max can then make a choice based on performance on track rather than a educative guess.\n\nAnd I don't see why from AM's side they wouldn't want to do this as well - as long as they get Max. Fernando's contract apparently runs out after '26, so they could just have Fernando and Lance for '26."", 'I hope if Alonso comes to rebull, lawson is still here....', 'Slow week huh', ""Max to Aston makes a world of sense - Newey is there, Honda is there, and they have established GT/LMH programme for Max to play in. He clearly cares more about balance in his life, and achieving a wide range of goals, than simply trying to be in the best car to chase titles. \n\nBut to happen this way? Man, I don't know what deal with the devil monkey paw shit Fernando did to get those first two titles, but I bet he didn't think it'd still haunting him 20 years later. Or 10 years later he'd again be at the mercy of an untested F1 engine. \n\nBecause, if we take Newey at face value and the 2026 pecking order will be dictated by engines rather than car design, that's a lot of faith in a Ford/RBPT unit that I haven't even heard dynamo chatter about yet."", 'Out of all possibilities, this one has to be the most out there.\n\nAlonso would be 46 or something by the time Max could be let go (‘26, ‘27) so I doubt Red Bull wants that. They would want to get younger, not older.\n\nAlso there is the fact that once again Red Bull would be going outside their own program to get someone when they already have plenty of young talent in the waiting.', 'Fernando and Liam as teammates?\xa0\n\n\nYes please lol', 'Yea zero chance this happens...']",6,161,0.51,6,1323,1323,6,3,0.010000000000000009,6
