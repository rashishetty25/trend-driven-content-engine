1lfk2bl,The Vettel effect theory.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lfk2bl/the_vettel_effect_theory/,2025-06-19, Discussion,"  
Before downvoting, note this is just a speculative discussion not a claim of absolute truth.

  
**TLDR:** Vettel‚Äôs peak was surprisingly short, his driving style was only perfectly suited to the V8 era. When the turbo-hybrid regulations arrived in 2014, he declined massively and this accidentally inflated the reputations of drivers like Ricciardo, Norris, and Leclerc.

**Vettel** had no wins in 2014, the car was not the best but still fast. His performance at Ferrari was inconsistent, and against Stroll he was very similar to Perez (both scored around 65% of team points).

When **Ricciardo** joined Red Bull in 2014 (beginning of turbo-hybrid) Vettel was a 4x WDC but not a top driver anymore, still Daniel's stock grew exponentially . Ricciardo did well in RB, but was outperformed by a teenage Verstappen (for context Max entered F1 at 17 Hamilton at 22).

  Ricciardo‚Äôs reputation stayed very high, so naturally when **Norris** destoroyed him, Norris became one of the hot shots of F1.

  With **Leclerc** I will be careful, he is undeniably fast, and he does look stronger than 40-year-old Hamilton now. But was his early reputation also boosted by beating a fading Vettel?

*Bonus Conspiracy Angle:* Lawrence Stroll knew about  the Vettel effect and signed him to Aston Martin to make Lance look better.



Q: Without Vettel would we rate Ricciardo, Norris, and Leclerc differently?","[""2015 is one of Vettel's strongest seasons and ruins your argument from the get go.\n\nVettel was also really good in 2017 and ultimately lost the title on a series of 4 coinflips those being the Silverstone tire failure, Singapore start calamity, Japan spark plug failure and Malaysia engine failure\n\nAs for Leclerc. No his reputation was high because he was one of the best young tallents to graze the junior ladder in a while. He also backed up that tallent in F1 straight away and more than proved himself already."", ""One thing I don't understand about many F1 fans is that they simultaneously understand that F1 success is primarily about machinery while also believing that when a driver no longer has the success he used to have it's because they weren't as good as they used to be."", ""Norris catching strays here.\nEveryone was shocked at how bad RIC performed in McLaren, but it was more about him being very poor in that team.\n\nNorris showed good pace from his first season, before being teamed up with RIC, and still does. There's people overestimating him, due to a very good car since last season, but it has nothing to do with RIC and much less so with VET.\n\nLEC proved he's fast in junior formulas, in Alfa, and in Ferrari, independent of VET.\n\nAs a certain driver would say, stop inventing."", ""I think you're massively downplaying his time at Ferrari to create your narrative\n\nHe was the only consistent challenger to Mercedes from 2015 - 2018\n\nNot to mention he had some brilliant drives at Aston, which proved he wasn't as washed as we believed he was"", ""Damn. No.\n\nVettel was good in the blown diffuser era. He figured it out better than anyone else. That's it. \n\nThe rest is just nonsense, also :)"", 'Someone had said on another thread, ""Vettel is one of the most disrespected World Champions""\n\n""He was driving a Newey rocket ship""\n\nAs if Michael, Lewis and Max drove bullock carts', 'He didn‚Äôt decline massively.
