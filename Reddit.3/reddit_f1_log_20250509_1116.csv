The spectacular Nordschleife test was actually supposed to remain secret. Nevertheless, we were able to take a few exclusive pictures of the drive. And we reveal what the Formula 1 star's future plans are.\n\nAs we all know, Max Verstappen can't get enough of racing. In addition to his Grand Prix appointments, the Formula 1 world champion trains every minute in his home simulator. The Dutchman also runs his own GT3 team, which competes in the GT World Challenge (GTWC). The racing team owner regularly gets behind the wheel himself during private test drives to tinker with the set-up.\n\nThese test drives normally take place behind closed doors on privately rented racetracks, mainly in southern Europe. But now Verstappen has surprisingly dared to come out of hiding. As part of the official test and set-up runs ahead of the third NLS race, the Formula 1 star completed a few laps of the Nordschleife in his 600 hp Ferrari 296 GT3 on Friday (9 May).\n\nThe Italian racing flounder was looked after by Emil Frey Racing during the Eifel event. The Swiss racing team is entering the 296 GT3 in the DTM and GTWC this season. Thierry Vermeulen, the son of Verstappen manager Raymond Vermeulen, normally sits in the cockpit for the experienced GT3 team.\n\n**Verstappen drives under a pseudonym**  \nVerstappen's trip to the Eifel was actually supposed to remain a secret. That is why the driver did not drive under his own name, but under a pseudonym. The most successful racing driver of recent years competed as ‚ÄòFranz Hermann‚Äô. This name was also stuck on the outside of the Ferrari - next to the Dutch flag. However, because his real name was printed on his helmet and racing overall, it quickly became clear who was really in the car.\n\nVerstappen probably just wanted to enjoy a few laps of the world's most spectacular racetrack in peace and quiet. To avoid being harassed, the new father of a family had his own security staff shield him during his test drive. External photographers were not allowed into the garage.\n\n**Further Nordschleife appearances planned**  \nIt was already known that Verstappen is a big fan of the Nordschleife. The four-time F1 champion had already successfully participated in virtual racing events in the digital NLS (DNLS) on several occasions. However, the simulator events are apparently no longer enough for the Red Bull driver. In future, he will probably be travelling to the Eifel in person more often.\n\nAccording to information from auto motor und sport, Verstappen is reportedly planning to obtain the so-called Nordschleife permit this year. This special racing licence is required to take part in official NLS events and the legendary 24-hour race at the N√ºrburgring.\n\nDuring a winner's interview at a DNLS event last year, the racing driver had already expressed his interest in real racing: ‚ÄòThe N√ºrburgring Nordschleife is one of my absolute favourite race tracks and I hope that in a few years I will also be able to compete here in a real GT3.‚Äô"", 'What a Max thing to do, just do a Nordschleife GT3 test under a pseudonym during a week off from F1.

Hill, known as 'Mr. Monaco', began and ended his Formula 1 career in the principality, having made his debut there in a small front-engined Lotus 12, in the last year where front-engined cars dominated the field, and the year Juan Manuel Fangio ended his career.\n\nAt the time of his retirement, Hill had started in 176 Grand Prix ‚Äì a record standing more than a decade until being equalled by Jacques Laffite in 1986 ‚Äì and had competed in 18 consecutive seasons, a number which would not be equalled until 35 years (!) later by Rubens Barrichello, who now still holds the record with 19 consecutive seasons. He was also the, to this day, last driver to have competed in Formula 1 at more than 45 years of age, a timespan which could be ended by Fernando Alonso if he competed in the latter races of the 2026 season.\n\nHill had been in the sport so long that he was the last active driver of his championship-winning 1962 season, the next most seasoned driver on the grid being Chris Amon, who began in 1963.\n\nHill's career in Formula 1 had been on a downturn since breaking both of his legs during the 1969 United States Grand Prix, not achieving anything more than a select few points finishes since then. Having established Embassy Racing with Graham Hill in 1973, he was gradually winding down his racing career, and with the arrival of promising young rookie Tony Brise to his team, his heart was not in it anymore. After starting in the two opening races of the season in Argentina and Brazil, Hill failed to qualify in South African, and then failed to qualify again in Monaco, a track on which he had won a then-record five Grand Prix on.\n\nSadly, Hill's career as a team boss would only last a further six months, as he, Tony Brise, and several other crew members were killed in a plane crash in November 1975, with Hill himself at the controls. Due to this grievous loss, Embassy Hill was no more ‚Äì and Damon Hill's way to Formula 1 become one hell of a lot harder and longer, as his family was saddled with the remaining debts."", ""One of the greats.

I think Max has definitely been the best driver this year. Just look at the team mate gaps in Quali and race pace down the grid. Furthermore Verstappen has literally outqualified Piastri in half the races this year amd outraced him in a third of them. And that Red Bull is nowhere near McLaren.\nAnd I would also rate George and probably Leclerc over Piastri. But tbf the three of them are very tight imo.\n\nHere‚Äôs my ‚Äújustification‚Äù for this.\n\nPiastri is on 131 points.\xa0\n\nIf Russell was in Piastri‚Äôs seat at McLaren these are the results I‚Äôd say he would‚Äôve got.\n\nAustralia - P2, Lando was on it that race but George had solid pace throughout and didn‚Äôt spin off like Oscar did so easy P2.\n\nChina sprint - P2, Made a great opportunistic move on Leclerc irl. His Quali lap was decent enough it would‚Äôve had him top three on the grid and then he probably would‚Äôve just done what Oscar did irl.\n\nChina - P1, Yeah George was absolutely on it this race and would have beaten Lando similarly to Oscar.\xa0\n\nJapan - P3, His small mistake in Quali left him P5 irl. In the McLaren he‚Äôd have been ahead of Leclerc but wouldnt have been able to pass Max or Norris.\n\nBahrain - P1, He was on fire this race and I‚Äôd assume Lando still messes up Q3 so it‚Äôs pole and win for George.\n\nSaudi Arabia - P2, His Quali lap was actually really strong so it‚Äôs touch and go weather he would‚Äôve beaten Max to pole. Either way he‚Äôd have taken the lead at the start but he was really bad on his tyres so he wound‚Äônt have been able to do what Oscar did and even though overtaking was hard I‚Äôd guess he would have ended P2.\n\nMiami sprint - P2, he was decent in the sprint but not spectacular. All the other top cars ran into difficulties though and I doubt he was that bad that Hamilton would‚Äôve beaten him.\xa0\n\nMiami - P1, Overall Norris would still get pushed off by Max on lap 1 and George would have found his way through after probably qualifying fourth or fifth. And he would‚Äôve been the lead McLaren after lap 1 and thus won the race. Also his race pace was really strong so I don‚Äôt think Norris could‚Äôve caught up.\n\nObviously it‚Äôs subjective but if that were what happened it would leave him on 140 points. Nine more than what Piastri has.', 'The title would better match Ferrari', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Mercedes has so far been reluctant to further develop the current Silver Arrow. However, the factory team has now announced a major upgrade offensive for the upcoming races.**\n\n> Mercedes is currently on track with second place in the team standings. The Silver Arrows have been significantly more competitive in the first six races of the season than last year. With four podium finishes for George Russell, the haul is impressive. Only the significant gap to market leader McLaren somewhat dampens the record.\n\n> But that\'s about to change. At the first six overseas Grands Prix, the engineers held back on upgrades. At the European season opener in Imola, Mercedes also wants to fully launch the development race. But that doesn\'t mean nothing has happened at the first races of the year.\n\n> ""We\'ve already made a few upgrades. They weren\'t particularly big or sexy, but there were always new things coming in,"" reveals technical director James Allison. The fact that Mercedes hasn\'t been mentioned much in the FIA\'s upgrade lists so far is also due to the calendar. ""We\'re already a quarter of the way through the season. The teams have been faced with many races in a row. It\'s quite difficult to make upgrades to the car when the races are flying around you like that.""\n\n> **Improvement with Imola upgrade?**\nBut that\'s about to change. After Miami, the engineers will have a two-week break to catch their breath. The European season opener traditionally also marks the start of the major development race. It\'s expected that most teams have something bigger planned for Imola. According to Allison, that\'s also the case with Mercedes.\n\n> ""In the next races, we\'ll be bringing new parts that are more visible from the outside. With a bit of luck, they should be able to improve our results."" The AMG W16 showed its strengths in the first few races, especially in qualifying. Over the race distance, however, the drivers struggled to maintain their good starting positions. McLaren, Red Bull, and Ferrari seem to be taking better care of their tires.\n\n> Allison is confident that Mercedes can improve in this area with the new parts: ""Hopefully, the upgrades we bring in the next two or three races will swing the pendulum a bit in our direction. We\'ll continue to try to work on tire temperatures in the race. That should help with the results as well.""\n\n> **New parts for Imola, Barcelona and Montreal.**\nThe second triple-header of the season, Imola, Monaco, and Barcelona, \u200b\u200bis now on the schedule. Allison doesn\'t believe the picture will change much compared to the first few races: ""We\'ve always been strong in qualifying so far, so we can expect to continue putting the car near the front of the grid. With a bit of luck, we\'ll even be a bit stronger here with the upgrades.""\n\n> However, the engineers\' focus is on improving race pace: ""We have to make sure that we can deliver on Sunday what we promise on Saturday. The most important thing is to control the temperatures in the tires and ensure that the car can show the pace it is capable of.""\n\n> However, further development is far from halted after the triple-header. Team boss Toto Wolff reveals: ""We have something planned for Imola, Barcelona, \u200b\u200band even Montreal."" Whether they can still catch up with McLaren is questionable, however. If the gap continues to grow, Mercedes will likely also discontinue development of the current model at some point.

No idea if she had her lights on or not, but see next example, as driver 2 ahead is Ciconte who doesn't appear to have her lights on.

13:00 - 13:20 After Felbermayr spins you can see who I believe is Ciconte continue down the road wihtout lights flashing.

Hard to believe that this wasn't reported right away. I could verify that the 3 frontrunners Pin, Palmowski, and Chambers turned on their lights later. But it shouldn't have happened in the first place. The team should have ensure the lights were turned on before they started the formation lap.

1kie8fo,[AutoRacer.it] McLaren: Other teams are trying to copy a secret of the MCL39,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kie8fo/autoracerit_mclaren_other_teams_are_trying_to/,2025-05-09, News,,"['Yeah no shit Sherlock', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> When a team wins, it ends up under the scrutiny of the teams and consequently of the FIA. The doubts about how someone can create a considerable advantage over the competition also lead to thinking about solutions that are within the famous grey areas and that perhaps even go beyond in some cases, even more so if that advantage is found in the last year of regulations. \n\n> In this sense,\xa0the McLaren MCL39 is surprising everyone with its dominant performances and rivals are wondering about the nature of this advantage\xa0. Toto Wolff takes his hat off and applauds his customer team.\xa0‚ÄúPointing the finger at something illegal is not right. I know the integrity of Stella, Brown, Marshall and those who work in Woking. \n\n> They are just doing a better job than us‚Äù\xa0said the Mercedes CEO & Team Principal. Compliments that also come, at least publicly, from Christian Horner (Red Bull) who however behind the scenes has tried to\xa0uncover more than any other team the or even worse the secrets\xa0of the papaya team.\n\n> **Tyre management is McLaren\'s winning ace: the \'secret\' also lies in the brake drums.**\nAnalyzing this start to the season, it has been seen that the peak performance of McLaren is superior but not unattainable for the other teams.\xa0On certain circuits\xa0, the fastest,\xa0and/or in certain conditions\xa0, think of when it is colder,\xa0the MCL39 can be beatable\xa0or in any case the gap is significantly reduced. \n\n> Furthermore,\xa0the Papaya single-seater\xa0encounters the greatest \'difficulties\' in qualifying, which leads Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to make too many mistakes on Saturday.\xa0""Now we have enough data to confirm that\xa0our car is easier to drive in race trim than in qualifying\xa0. So far we have not done a perfect qualifying lap, even if Oscar\'s lap in Bahrain came very close,""\xa0said Andrea Stella. It turns out that above all Mercedes and Red Bull have managed to get closer and even beat the times of the two Papaya standard-bearers in the fastest lap.\n\n>\xa0What makes a significant difference with all the other teams is the MCL39\'s ability to manage the tyres in the most difficult conditions.\xa0In the rain of Melbourne and Miami we saw the difference they can make with the Intermediates, tyres that tend to overheat a lot as the track dries and the tread becomes smooth. This allowed the orange duo to have a pace that was clearly better than everyone else, zero overheating and therefore zero degradation with unmatched consistency in performance. \n\n> The same thing happens, unfortunately for the others, even in dry asphalt conditions.\xa0""When it\'s cold they win with a 10 second advantage, when it\'s hot with 30, today even 37""\xa0said George Russell in the post-race in Miami\xa0. The MCL39 in fact excels on those circuits where a perfect balance between slow and fast is important and above all where it is necessary to know how to manage the tyres very well, that is when the thermal degradation of the rear axle (overheating) is crucial as in Bahrain but also in Miami.\n\n> Since last season, suspicions have been raised at Red Bull about the use of possible \'tricks\' in the wheel corner area. The Milton Keynes technicians have asked the FIA \u200b\u200bfor information regarding\xa0a possible use of infinitesimal quantities of water to manage temperatures\xa0, a technique that they know well in Milton Keynes, and that Rob Marshall believes could have brought to Woking. \n\n> However, both Pirelli and the FIA \u200b\u200bhave never found any evidence to support the thesis of Horner\'s men. Until the study of that macro area of \u200b\u200bthe MCL39 with special thermal cameras, as anticipated by AMuS, which showed\xa0""a strange temperature profile, certainly very different from ours and also from those of our other competitors""\xa0a top technician from the Milton Keynes team told us. It is therefore not surprising that, on both orange-coloured cars, the tyres are practically always in the perfect range of use, above all they do not overheat when environmental and track factors require it.\xa0\n\n> The suspicion, now become certainty for all direct competitors, is that the team led by Andrea Stella has found the perfect way through the cooling system to let air in to cool the brakes but also to not overheat the tires too much, thus trying to have the right temperature to trigger them and guarantee peak grip in a larger window of \'external\' temperatures.\xa0A very delicate balance obtained through what Andrea Stella calls the\xa0dark art\xa0of this F1.\xa0""It is clear that in the race, when we have to deal with tire wear in hot conditions, our car behaves very well. I would like to underline that this is the result of very specific engineering work by our team,\xa0"" said the engineer from Abruzzo.\n\n> In short, not only in terms of aeroelasticity but also in the area of \u200b\u200bthe wheel corners, more precisely inside the baskets, that\xa0McLaren makes an important difference to all the other teams\xa0, thanks to some very advanced technical solutions designed by the team led by Rob Marshall, a former leading engineer at Red Bull. \n\n> The brake baskets that we usually see covering the entire braking system have a standard design on the outside, but underneath it the teams have a lot of freedom in the design and often look for significant aerodynamic gains and above all cooling, even if for this season McLaren has significantly raised the technical bar also in that macro area.\xa0\n\n> It is therefore no coincidence that all three top teams are working hard in that area to bring developments in the very short and short term.\xa0Right in Milton Keynes,\xa0as we have already had the opportunity to report\xa0, they are working on trying to replicate what McLaren believe they can do, with sensitive parts that could already see the track in one of the next races even if Verstappen was very vague in Miami about it.\xa0‚ÄúWe are doing our best to solve this problem. But some things take more time,\xa0even to understand them thoroughly\xa0. Then producing them is a whole other story‚Äù.\n\n>\xa0The same goes for Mercedes and Ferrari, although the latter has more of a problem with lighting the tyres and less with not overheating them. In Brackley they clearly admitted with the words of James Allison, who spoke about the purpose of the updates that will arrive in the first part of the summer season.\xa0‚ÄúThe main aspect on which we have concentrated is keeping the temperature of the tyres under control, a crucial aspect to allow the car to exploit the pace it has available‚Äù\xa0said the former Ferrari, now in charge of the technical office of the Brackley team.', ""Best place for a secret innovation as it's hidden away and not easy to copy like most aero.

If a driver has to avoid a collision in a braking zone, they‚Äôre at the mercy of the other driver or they have to let off the brakes for rotation, which may increase the chance of a collision further. Also consider how short braking zones are and how quickly speed is reduced.\n\nThe general rule is you‚Äôre allowed one defensive move and it has to be done before you commit to a line in a corner. That said, there is a built in ‚Äúfree move‚Äù that‚Äôs usually overlooked where a driver will make a defensive move then move again to return to the racing line in the braking zone. I assume this is ignored because the driver returning to the racing line has probably secured the position and the attacking driver has chosen not to try an overtake.', 'Generally, as a defending driver, you should always make your moves in anticipation of what an attacking driver will do. If you defend in reaction, it significantly reduces the time an attacking driver has to back out and puts them in a position where it is almost impossible to avoid a collision, as they‚Äôre most likely committed to a line they cannot realistically deviate from. It‚Äôs effectively the racing equivalent of someone pulling into your lane on the road without indicating first.\n\nIn some instances this applies to scenarios outside of pure racing. The prime example of this is Montoya and Monteiro at the 2005 Turkish GP; Montoya looked to move back onto the racing line after lapping Monteiro, who had virtually no space or time to react to Montoya changing line, nor any reason to believe that Montoya would change his line in the first place. Despite being a backmarker, and despite Montoya being the driver that lost out in the incident, Monteiro was blameless as he had left space for Montoya to pass and had taken a predictable line in doing so, which is exactly what a backmarker should do.', 'I rate Sainz a fair bit higher in general but I think Perez was a little better in 2022 and had his best year by a fair distance with the possible exception of 2020, but the circumstances in 2022 were much more unfriendly than those of 2020, where he was arguably flattered by the pink Mercedes and a weak team-mate in Stroll.\n\nScoring two-thirds of prime Max‚Äôs points is no joke, and it‚Äôs not like Max lost a significantly greater number of points to bad luck than Checo did. I genuinely believe only the top shelf drivers (Leclerc, Russell, Piastri, Norris, Lewis) could have done better than that. \n\nSainz‚Äôs 2022 was his weakest Ferrari season, at least relative to Leclerc. Charles had his fair share of bad luck and got shafted by the pit wall on god knows how many occasions.

1ki7w0t,Should F1 Teams Face Higher Fees for Technical Protests?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ki7w0t/should_f1_teams_face_higher_fees_for_technical/,2025-05-09, Discussion,"After some recent discussions I've been reflecting on the current state of technical protests in Formula 1 and believe there's room for improvement in the system to ensure it's used judiciously.  
  
Recently we have seen Red Bull (surprise surprise) make complaints official and publicly regard McLaren specifically. It has been rear wings, front wings, tires and brakes.   
  
Being a fan for years I am actually getting quite tired of Red Bull's approach over the last couple of decades where any team is competitive.

**Current Structure:**  
Under the FIA's International Sporting Code, teams can lodge formal protests during race weekends by paying a fee, typically around ‚Ç¨1,000 from what I could find. If the protest is upheld, this fee is refunded. However, this fee is really a small amount and doesn't seem to deter teams from filing frequent complaints, some of which often seem to lack substantial grounds.  
  
Red Bull as I mentioned, actively lodges both official protests as well as public complaints (often to the media)  raising concerns about rival teams' car components. Basically any time any other team has been competitive or has brought real innovations to their team and the sport. While my focus is on this side of things, in general Red Bull have lodged a variety of complaints consistently.  
  
For instance:

* **Miami Grand Prix 2025**: Red Bull protested George Russell's third-place finish, alleging he didn't slow adequately under yellow flags. The FIA reviewed the evidence and dismissed the protest, allowing Russell to retain his position. 
* **Tyre Cooling Allegations**: Red Bull accused McLaren of employing illegal tyre-cooling methods. The FIA investigated and found no irregularities
* **Brake System Scrutiny**: Red Bull questioned the legality of McLaren's rear brake systems, leading to further investigations that found no wrongdoing.

The flexi wing complaints is another example. Here you can argue that some have been legitimate complaints, the mini DRS while clever I think warranted a revisit.

I think it is important to note though that unlike years gone by teams have to submit their technically specifications and updates to the FIA and the FIA approve all current car updates. There are many cases where there are loop holes and grey areas which teams exploit and that is part and parcel of the sport. I personally love how teams read through these detailed regulations and manage to still come up with clever and innovative evolutions to the cars.

While it's essential to uphold the sport's integrity, the frequency and timing of such complaints, specifically from one team seams to more to do with attempts to stifle competition rather than genuine attempts to uphold that integrity. 

**I believe there should be a change made here:**

To ensure that protests are made with genuine intent and substantial evidence, I believe the following should really be changed.

1. **Increased Protest Fee**: Raise the fee for lodging a protest to a more substantial amount, say ‚Ç¨50,000.
2. **Refund Conditions**:
   * **Full Refund**: If the protest is upheld and leads to a rule clarification, future change or penalty.
   * **Partial Refund**: If the protest is found to be legitimate but doesn't result in any action.
   * **No Refund**: If the protest is deemed frivolous or without merit.
3. **Support Requirement**: Depending maybe regarding the size of complaint it may require backing from at least one other team to lodge a protest, ensuring that concerns are shared and not solely strategic.
4. If there is no significant evidence but a team has publicly made claims to the media and if the protest is deemed without merit or frivolous fines will be issued.

I believe these changes would discourage teams more from filing protests without substantial grounds and encourage a focus on innovation and performance.

In my view, Red Bull has taken advantage of the current protest system as a way to suppress competition. Especially during Christian Horner‚Äôs two-decade leadership, it seems like part of their strategy hasn‚Äôt just been to observe rival teams as all teams do but to actively complain often when they have struggled on innovating and evolving their own car. There‚Äôs also a noticeable pattern of Red Bull making public accusations through the media, even when there‚Äôs little or no evidence to support their claims.

While they‚Äôve occasionally hit on genuine issues like the Ferrari fuel flow controversy, which itself was quietly buried, the sheer volume of protests and accusations doesn't justify it. In my opinion, this kind of tactic is unhealthy for the sport and undermines fair competition.","[""I appreciate that you took the time to write all of this, but I can't agree with you.\n\nTechnical protests exist for a reason. While the FIA has the duty to police technical legality of the cars, the FIA can't do it alone, so this would also rely on the teams policing each other as well, which technical protests is achieving. Hence teams should find technical protests accessible to encourage the usage of such a system, while ensuring that there is cost to a F1 team such that teams won't abuse the system.\n\nSure most of them are probably false, but when some of these protests turned out to be true, it does help prevent cheating.
