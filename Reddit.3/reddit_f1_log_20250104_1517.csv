I was ""homeless"" for a while after that and with the 2010 grid expansion, felt an affinity for Team Lotus as I've always liked their road cars. That persisted through the Caterham name too before they folded in 2014.

1htcxty,[Motorsport IT] F1 | Ferrari: Fiorano and Barcelona to prepare Hamilton in red,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1htcxty/motorsport_it_f1_ferrari_fiorano_and_barcelona_to/,2025-01-04, News,,"['Finally the photoshops will stop.', ""**Translation:**\n\n  \n*The Scuderia has defined an ‘elastic’ test programme for Lewis's preparation after the FIA introduced stricter limits: from this year, the full-time drivers will be able to do a thousand kilometres in four days with the Previous Cars. Hamilton will be busy at Fiorano and then Barcelona. The dates are still up in the air depending on the weather.*\n\n  \nOne thousand kilometres in four days. That's how long Lewis Hamilton will have to get acclimatised with Ferrari's working system before the launch of the 2025 single-seater (19 February) and the tour de force that will follow, namely a filming day and the three days of collective testing in Bahrain.\n\nAt Maranello they have planned an ‘elastic’ test programme to ensure the best possible weather conditions considering the limitations of January. The aim is to secure test days in acceptable track conditions to complete the work that has been planned for some time.\n\nThe eagerly awaited debut of the seven-time world champion behind the wheel of a Ferrari (the choice is between the 2022 or 2023 single-seater) is scheduled to take place at the Fiorano circuit, a day that could vary (depending on weather conditions) from 20 to 21 January.\n\nAccording to information gathered by [Motorsport.com](http://Motorsport.com), the test programme will continue in the final days of January at the Barcelona circuit, with the hope of finding milder temperatures. In this case too, Ferrari has guaranteed themselves a window of several days (at least four) in order to postpone the test in the event of bad weather. A measure that has also become necessary because of the new regulations regarding TPC (Testing of Previous Cars) tests, i.e. tests with single-seaters used at least two seasons before the current one.\n\nLast 11 December, the FIA published a new version of the sporting regulations with several new features, including the paragraph regulating TPC tests. Paragraph ‘g’ of Article 10.2 introduces new limits: if a TPC test is carried out by a driver participating in the F1 World Championship, it will be subject to distance and duration constraints. A maximum mileage (in the calendar year) of 1,000 km has been introduced, which can be completed in a maximum of four different test days. For drivers not registred in the F1 world championship, the days are increased to twenty, with no mileage limit.\n\nIn Hamilton's case every lap will be precious, especially now that the kilometres have been capped. A tightening, the one introduced by the FIA, which came after the controversy raised last year by some teams following tests conducted within the rules but outside the spirit of the regulations.\n\nOne of the most commented cases was the test day organised in June last year by Red Bull at the Imola circuit, when Max Verstappen took to the track with the 2022 single-seater for some technical checks, going against the reasons for which the TPC tests were originally conceived, namely to offer an opportunity for drivers who need to familiarise themselves with driving a F1 car and with working methods.\n\nThe 1,000 kilometres allowed by the regulations give a driver the chance to acclimatise and familiarise himself with the working system, which is the case for Hamilton as it is for all drivers making their debut in a new team.\n\nLewis will have four days in which the team will try to make it as easy as possible for him to settle in, and then, from the first day of testing in Bahrain with the 2025 single-seater, we will start talking about performance.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'This is going to be so good.', 'How many laps around Barcelona roughly is 1000km?', ' Cold conditions, SF-23 is perfect for that', 'This is going to be the best thing and nothing can convince me otherwise.', '1000km in 4 days is, more or less, the same distance than 1 GP Race every day.\n\nSeems though, but hope everything goes OK for everyone', 'I really hope at some point in his Ferrari stint Lewis gets to drive the SF70H and SF71H.', 'Sike !

If I were new to F1, I’d think qualifying worked in the way it did circa 2004 with the single lap format rather than the way it actually has worked for almost 20 years now.\n\nThat said, DTS is not designed to be an accurate documentation of things that happened, it is supposed to tell stories in a very human-focused way and in my opinion it does an absolutely terrific job of that. The way it covered Pierre Gasly in 2019, for example, was terrific, they gave him an entire character arc with a good ending that very much reflected reality and it went a long way to show just how narrative-driven F1 can be. \n\nBack when I first started watching F1 in 2004 you always used to hear the ITV team talk about how much of a soap opera F1 was and what I see DTS doing is tapping into that potential in order to expand the sport’s audience.

It provides some footage and behind-the-scenes insight that the average viewer might not have a succinct idea about. It also showcases some of the drivers and team principals in slightly greater detail so that you are able to resonate and root for them\n\n2) Very very negative. Some people have said that the show is not an accurate reflection and representation of the sport because it exaggerates certain narratives on a technical and presentation basis, conjures up some narratives which are simply not true, or contains more nuance than that and displays sanitised narratives while leaving out the unsavoury bits which actually played a larger role in reality"", 'Not a good reflection at all, kiiinda informative but also misleading in a lot of cases.\n\nIt\'s not a documentary. It\'s like one of those ""based on real events"" movies like Catch Me If You Can, Sully, Wolf of Wall Street, etc. It is indeed based on real life events and you can get a general idea of the real thing, but some things are changed, some things are added, some things are left out, so basically it\'s all seasoned with a whole lot of creativity in order to make it more entertaining to the general public, including people who aren\'t actually interested in F1.']",8,27,0.8,8,22,22,0,7,-0.039999999999999925,0

Just pointless speculation about fans who know nothing about how Ferrari operates (and never will).\n\nCrash tests are just a standard safety procedure. Teams know how to pass it and can do it quite easily. Sometimes they don't quite make it the first time, because of how strict the test is. That has nothing to do with how fast the car might be. Maybe they just need to add a tiny bit of material in one place.\n\nThe teams always make it in the end, without much trouble (unless the team is incompetent and struggling to even build a functioning car).

This is now going into the 4th year of this regulation, also this year's cars even though the may be a new design they're basically going to be evolutions of last years cars with the completely new regs coming next season.  Think more along the line of hundreds of small changes to last years cars  instead of new complete clean sheet of paper designs."", 'To answer your question, the idea is that if you pass your crash test too easily your car is unnecessarily safe.. typically what you want is to be just on the wrong side of the limit and then add material to the failed site.\n\nHaving said that no one knows what Ferrari have done and what their procedure is.

1htfc55,The same car for qualifying.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1htfc55/the_same_car_for_qualifying/,2025-01-04, Discussion,"So laying in bed this morning I was thinking, what if all drivers had the same car for qualifying.
As some drivers are great on one lap pace but don't have the car to convert there place in the race. Do you think this would mix the grid up making for a better race with faster cars coming though the field in the race?
I know this would never happen in this age of cost caps, as you would need another 20 cars to be shipped all over the wrold and crews to look after them. It was just a thought.","[""That's just gonna be F2 or Indycar, removes one of the main elements that makes F1 stand out"", ""F1 isn't a spec series."", ""Why don't they just do a race on foot? It would definitely mix things up. Especially if they keep the 305 km distance."", 'Not because drivers still adjust their car depending on their driving style', ""There are plenty of racing series you can watch if you prefer all drivers having the same car. F1 isn't one of them."", 'Yes and I nominate Fiat Multipla with the side seats removed in order to be as close to single seaters as physically possible.', ""No because they'll just end up being back markers to the faster cars in the official race the outcome will always end up being the same"", 'There are plenty of spec series for you to watch', ""Nothing would change much except for the midfield. I was thinking replace the sprint with identical F2 cars for the buildup with all the teams liveries as per normal. Would encourage risky moves as the cars are cheaper, could loosen the racing rules to see who's the baddest mf""]",0,24,0.09,0,22,22,0,24,0.09,0
