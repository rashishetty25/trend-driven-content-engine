Without cutting a hair . Aston Martin will no longer return to Formula 1 as a mere supporting actor, something that seemed disappointing at the end of  2024. The factory took off in 2023 and Fernando Alonso came close to winning (Monaco, perhaps, was the great opportunity). But in 2024 it hit rock bottom, only the miracles of the Asturian were the lifeline  of a stricken ship. It is not acceptable. Neither for the driver who has shown the best hands in the Grand Circus nor for an ambitious factory in every corner. For this reason, its revolution has taken shape. Melbourne, at the beginning of 2025, is the first test. And in 2026, the dream and the objective arrive. ""To be a team that wins the World Championship,"" repeat its main names. \n\n\n\nThe ambition is full. Something logical from the vision of the multimillionaire Lawrence Stroll as director. His obsession is for his son Lance to be champion, and before that comes being able to give Fernando Alonso the best results with the green. To do this, the Silverstone team reinforced the weakest positions, seeking progression and a dream that no one hides with the 2026 regulations to be exploited. ""Expectations will be high,"" said Alonso himself on Dazn. It should be remembered that in the new reality of the premier category, more freedom will be allowed in aerodynamics, there is a lot of difference in the wings compared to the current ones and it has a more powerful MGU-K.\n\n\n\nFirst and last names\n\nNo change at Aston Martin is as important as the arrival of Adrian Newey. The most prestigious engineer of all time arrives as a great technical guru, capable of revolutionising any team, as he demonstrated in his last stage at Red Bull. Although he will not start working in a real way until March, more or less, his vision will be key to understanding the evolutions of the 2025 car, the work with the wind tunnel that is already in an advanced calibration phase and the search for success in 2026. There he will try to design a winning car, exploiting the new regulations to the limit and working with the modifications that will mark the new cars. In addition, his word is law. Without his support, few things (or nothing) are done.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewey is the backbone from which the other new features are born. One is Enrico Cardile, who has arrived from Ferrari as the new technical director. He comes after leaving the Italian factory in clear progression during 2024 and will be in charge of creating the car of the future. ""He will oversee the architecture, design and construction,"" they said in their official statement. The mission is, with the addition of Honda as a supplier of the power unit, to quickly adapt to the new regulations. Without neglecting 2025.\n\n\n\nThere is more. The visible heads of the last project (Mike Krack, Dan Fallows or Tom McCullogh) disappear from the front line. And they add another expert, inside and out, on how to make a winning team, the British engineer Andy Cowell. He will be the team boss after his success with Mercedes. There he was the great leader of the success of the team with the star in the hybrid era, as he was fundamental in the creation and development of their engines. On the track, there was dominance with Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg. ""Building a team that wins the World Championship is our only objective,"" he says. There is no limit.', ""If that's true, why Lance is still there...."", ""I see we're still pretending Alonso is in his prime and hasn't aged a day.

1i5gljq,Why are certain drivers better at race pace and other better over one lap?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i5gljq/why_are_certain_drivers_better_at_race_pace_and/,2025-01-20, Discussion,"So I've always seen that almost every generation has a driver that's considered the best over one lap, and another that's considered the best over a race distance or most complete on race day. 

I am only picking two drivers per decade for the sake of simplicity, I know there are more.
70s 
One Lap: Hunt
Race Distance: Lauda
80s: 
One Lap: Senna
Race Distance: Prost
90s:
One Lap: Hakkinen
Race Distance: Schumacher
2000s and 2010s: 
One Lap: Hamilton
Race Distance: Alonso
2020s:
One Lap: Leclerc
Race Distance: Verstappen

My question is, does a certain driving style reward one lap pace at the cost of a race distance? Why was Prost for example consistently worse than Senna in qualifying but over a season would usually be considered better on race day. Same goes for Alonso, as good as he is in qualifying, it's his race pace that made him almost unstoppable on a Sunday. 

For the current generation I would suppose it's commonly considered that Leclerc is one of the best over one lap but Verstappen would be slightly better on race day. What makes a race distance any different than qualifying and wouldn't the fastest qualifier also be the best during a race, as end of the day, it's still a display of who has more pace, and in theory they will finish ahead more often.

And additionally, why are some select drivers so much better at qualifying than anything else. E.g Trulli?

What is the core difference between a race distance and a qualifying from a driving perspective and why do some drivers performance vary drastically between the two formats?
","[""Consistency, wheel to wheel skills and tyre management. That's it."", 'Don‚Äôt really need to manage tires during qualifying, can just go balls to the wall.\n\nThe problem is, even ignoring the tires, it‚Äôs impossible to run 40+ laps on the knife‚Äôs edge without blowing it. Better to have a guy who can consistently turn in 90-95% of the perfect lap time all day than the dude who can go perfect lap, perfect lap, lost 30 seconds in the gravel trap, perfect lap‚Ä¶', ""Was Lewis known for one lap pace? I feel like when I've been watching him he's been more known for race pace than one lap pace."", 'Your qualifying laps are generally going to be on softer compounds, low fuel, blast it for one lap. Maybe different compounds track to track but they will be fresh. Fairly consistent.\n\nRace pace you are managing wearing tires, fuel going down, maybe temps of different parts of the car, different temps on track, dirty air. Everything changes a little every lap. And you need to anticipate/feel it and go as fast as possible (without eating tires).\n\nIf you think about wet races we consider those to determine the best drivers because they are thrown into unexpected conditions. We can also think about how teams evaluate drivers. A guy who busts out a 1:10:00 somewhere after 5 laps in the car looks better than a guy doing 1:09:58 after 1000 laps.\n\nA great driver is obviously a fast driver, but how are they fast? They quickly absorb sensory input and data and use it to drive as close to the limit as possible. The quicker you can absorb and act, the better. A quali lap has less moving parts essentially.', ""It's a complicated thing. \n\nA qualifying setup can make the car more on a knife edge, which makes it slightly harder to control consistently over a race distance, but may make the car quicker over a single lap.\n\nAlso, a setup or even the the driver's own driving style can take more out of the tyres over a single lap, but may not be the optimal strategy during a race because the tyre performance may drop off over time with that setup or driving style.\n\nIn older generations when reliability was much more of an issue, some drivers may be more conservative over a race to not stress the car as much as other drivers.\n\nPlus, in previous regulations, there were more than one tyre supplier, so differences in the tyres construction and compound would be different between teams in the same era.\n\nSo, for a driver like Jarno Trulli, who was considered a qualifying specialist. His setup or natural driving style may have been more suited to extracting more of a lap time over a single lap, but unable to maintain that pace over a race because of tyre, setup differences or even the sheer level of concentration it takes to pull out a qualifying lap, which is hard to maintain over a race distance.\n\nNot sure if any of this helps, and if people think I'm talking out of my arse, just delete this comment or whatever lol."", 'For Leclerc vs Verstappen, it was the car whose tires could barely last a lap. When Ferrari started making cars that can perform over an entire race, Leclerc had much better results in the race than in qualifying.', ""Qualifying is often about putting exactly the right amount of energy in the tires over a lap and having them at right temp at beginning, and absolutely nailing every braking zone and turn in point.  Race pace is about putting as little energy into the tires and brakes as possible and still being fast while driving nowhere near the limit. It's understanding where both lap time and tire wear/temp/slip comes from and using it where it matters most"", 'They are 2 different things. Certain cars are also better at qualifying than a full race.', ""In very oversimplified terms (this is all opinion). And it is easy to over exaggerate - all the top F1 drivers have both excellent lap time and race management. The differences are very small.\n\nOne lap relies a lot on feel and a lot of courage. The driver is willing to push the car just a little bit harder, a little bit faster into corners and have the confidence to control that car. \n\nRace has a bit more about vehicle management. Managing fuel, temperatures, brakes/tires. Having the mental discipline to be patient and take fewer risks when the occasion doesn't demand it. Reading the condition of the opponent and taking advantage of their mistakes. \n\nThis balance of aggression and patience is what makes the truly great drivers.""]",165,96,0.85,165,1160,1160,7,0,0.0,7

Red Bull was first to market with the concept, which started in Viry-Chatillon as Renault had to first validate some quite extreme exhaust valve material strategies. The EBD objective was to increase mass flow as much as physically possible whilst generating non-positive torque under braking. To achieve the desired mass flow, the engine would continue being controlled above 85% throttle, whilst the throttle pedal rested at 0%. Timing strategies were capable of producing a non-positive torque at >80% throttle and the excessive mass flow would energize the diffuser, thus generating a step change in downforce (relative to non-EBDs), particularly on corner entry and part throttle conditions. For everything to work, the exhaust valve had to survive a plasma curtain that would toast them like the plasma filament on your 3000 watt microwave on 230V...teetering on the edge of catastrophic meltdown. The credit goes to Viry for pioneering the materials science approach and Adrian's team for having the foresight to spot such an opportunity.""]",59,10,0.93,59,10,10,10,0,0.020000000000000018,10

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.
