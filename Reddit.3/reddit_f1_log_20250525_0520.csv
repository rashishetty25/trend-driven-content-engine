1kultn2,F1 ghost car video is completely inaccurate.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kultn2/f1_ghost_car_video_is_completely_inaccurate/,2025-05-24, Technical,"I really like the new ghost car videos but it seems the data is inaccurate. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUcbbUKWpxA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUcbbUKWpxA)

F1 Tempo shows Leclerc ahead in the tunnel by 1.5-2 tenths. Yet the ghost video shows Norris ahead at this point. It seems they either sync up the second ghost to always be ahead or just make the whole thing up. 

Idk how F1 tempo gets their data but i heard they are very accurate most of the time. ","['I always wondered if the ghosts were actually accurate.', ""Honestly its pretty tricky to calculate. First of all you are converting a gps position to relative position. Then you have to project it onto the camera using the correct FOV.\n\nI also don't believe they update GPS position very frequently (maybe every 100ms?) so you are essentially getting a linear interpolation between all of the GPS points\n\nDon't forget that when the source car updates GPS and when the ghost car updates GPS is also out of sync, so you are inevitably going to have interpolation warping.\n\nIt's cool tech, but it's also implicitly inaccurate.\n\nEDIT: Oh also, the live view of the source car is not when they are calculating the relative position from the source. So even from that perspective it is out of sync.  \nThat is, what you are seeing from the onboard, is not the data they are using to calculate the position of the ghost. It's from the GPS data of the source car. If they were to project the source car GPS onto the onboard, you would see pretty large desyncs.\n\nYou know what. If I wanted to save myself a lot of work with the 3D projection, I would probably just import the relative data into a 3D box engine like Gadot/Unreal/Unity, match the FOV in engine, and render out the movement of the entity with a transparent background.  \nThen you could easily just overlay the recording on top of the onboard and you don't have to do jack shit."", ""It just looks shit with how much it lags and slides. They have literally all the data they need, I don't know why they can't just overlay it better."", ""Unfortunately, neither F1 Tempo or any other site that uses the Fast-F1 api will be correct. The data isn't granular enough since you only get a data point every 0.2-0.3 seconds. Last time I checked, F1 Tempo was using the interpolation provided by default by the Fast-F1 api, which isn't accurate enough for millisecond precision."", 'Is F1 Tempo 100% accurate?', 'I hope all you realize that Norris‚Äôs car is 3D here.\xa0\n\nAs a vfx artist, i can day it is not easy to make it better.', 'it has always been, from day 1 when 1 guy did a video on silverstone 2021, then the official F1 channel started doing them\n\nThe first guy admitted the lines were interpretation, and nobody ever questioned the F1 overlayed ghost cars', ""Honestly, I can't get by the fact that you used a decimal to measure a decimal."", ""Sorry OP, I would really love it if F1-tempo was that accurate, but it's not. I think the 3d video has slightly better data, but they're both wrong. I'm just comparing the sector times here.\n\nOn the end of the first sector (after Casino square), per F1-tempo, Leclerc is 0.05-0.1 s ahead, but we actually know that the 1st sector was 18.216 for Norris and 18.290 for Leclerc, so .074 better for Norris, which matches the video.\n\nOn the end of the second sector (after Tabac) the 3d video shows Norris quite a bit ahead, maybe 0.15s (which means Norris had the better 2rd sector), while F1-tempo shows the gap still in the 0.05-0.08s range in favour or Leclerc (so an equal second sector). The actual times show that Charles had a better sector by 0.074s (33.180 vs 33.254) and, incredibly, Norris and Leclerc were level by the 2nd sector line, 51.470s. \n\nThe third sector, per the 3d video Norris might have even been slower, given how far ahead he was entering the swimming pool section, and on F1-tempo, Norris had a 0.185s better sector. In real life, Norris was .109 faster (18.484 vs 18.593).\n\nSo yeah, none of those are very good.\n\nEDIT: TL;DR, it was more or less like this:\n\n1st sector - F1-tempo off by 0.15 for LEC, 3D pretty much right.\n\n2nd sector - F1-tempo off by 0.075 for NOR, 3D off by 0.15 for NOR\n\n3rd sector - F1-tempo off by 0.075 for NOR, 3D off by 0.15 for LEC""]",150,39,0.9,150,37,37,4,0,0.0,4

1kufezu,Analyzing the Stroll-Gasly Incident,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kufezu/analyzing_the_strollgasly_incident/,2025-05-24, Discussion,"Note: Reviewed this with F1TV, I cannot ensure the radios are correctly synced

9:42 to go in Q1, 0:13:25 in F1TV. I'll use F1TV's timestamps for practicality.

Our protagonists:

- **Stroll** is on a prep lap, going into the tunnel. He's about to let Tsunoda by.

- **Hamilton** (not Charles, sorry Lance) is behind him, also on a prep lap, he just let Tsunoda by.

- **Gasly** is on a fast lap.

13:28 - Hamilton: ""*Down on my delta cuz... traffic's crazy.*"" Engineer acknowledges and warns him of Gasly. **Hamilton speeds up**. 

13:37 - Stroll exits the tunnel. **Stroll's Engineer**: ""***Gasly coming now***, *watch for Gasly in the tunnel, Gasly 3, Gasly 2...*"". No warning is given about Hamilton.

13:38 - Hamilton exits the tunnel. At ""Gasly 2"", Hamilton overtakes Stroll, and Stroll moves back into the racing line.

13:40 - Gasly arrives at the scene and the debacle unfolds.

--- 

So IMO, this was a right old mess. Hamilton's worried about his delta, so he's passing cars on a slow lap. Stroll gets no warning about him. ""Gasly coming now"" is misleading. And all of this happens right when exiting the tunnel, when visibility is lowest, and on a braking zone.

Atrociously unlucky situation. Nonetheless, a penalty could be justified, Gasly was unquestionably impeded and better comms could have prevented this.","[""I don't understand F1 teams here. Same with the Hamilton/Max incident. \n\nLike I get that race engineers are busy doing tons of stuff. But then why does the team do not have someone whose job is just to check for incoming traffic.

1kufek8,Monaco pace gaps + current season averages,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kufek8/monaco_pace_gaps_current_season_averages/,2025-05-24, Statistics,"Pace gaps are based on the highest qualifying round both drivers reached (eg. If Driver A reaches Q3 but Driver B did not get out of Q1, the Q1 times are used to calculate the gap).

If a driver is unable to complete a lap in the final session both drivers reached, the session is discarded (Haas Australia, McLaren Saudi, Miami Sprint Mercedes+Williams, Imola Red Bull are affected by this).

The exception to this is Mercedes Monaco - both drivers did not set a lap in Q2, so Q1 times were used (as they effectively ended qualifying at the same point).

Obviously datasets for Ver/Law and Gas/Col are very small, so are less reliable.

Interesting insights:

Norris wins on median but Piastri on mean. Piastri‚Äôs gaps when he‚Äôs won out are generally a lot bigger vs narrow ones when Norris has won out. McLaren is the smallest gap of all.

1kurhku,What's the best strategy for 2025 Monaco GP. Box after Formation lap for pitstop????,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kurhku/whats_the_best_strategy_for_2025_monaco_gp_box/,2025-05-25, Discussion,"For anyone starting outside of the points, I think the best bet is to throw a hail mary since you need such a massive delta to even attempt an overtake anyway.

That means anyone starting from p11 down should be trying crazy things to get into the points.

The forced 2 stop strategy also presents strategic opportunities. With boxing at the end of formation lap seemingly very appealing:

1)Avoid first lap field spread where you automatically lose tons of time¬†

2)Possibly box ahead of a first lap safety car gaining a massive advantage

In the event of no safety car, you push flat out on your tires till you catch up with the second last car. And just before you get impeded by it, or by dirty air. you box for your final set of hard tires to go to the end of the race.

With ever car ahead still needing at least 1 or 2 more stops. and you hold up every single car behind you.

The ONLY time Monaco is exciting is when it rains.

Thus I would propose the following:

- Make Monaco a Sprint weekend

- Reduce the number of support races, as more prep time will be required between sessions. 

- Have Pirelli bring significantly more sets of inters to the track.

- Prior to every session including the race, and assuming it‚Äôs not raining, send a bunch of water trucks out to wet down the track, to make it suitable for inters but not to the point of needing full wets.  

- Do not wet the run-off areas, the chicane cutting areas, the inside of the tunnel, and the pit lane - for safety purposes. Perhaps avoid wetting the curbs on the racing line at Sainte Devote, Nouvelle Chicane, and the swimming pool. 

- If there are any red flags in the race, re-wet the track once it is safe, unless it is actually raining. This might be just wetting the standard racing line and not the full track width for time reasons.

- Make Beau Rivage a second DRS zone. This may not be applicable if the 2026 rules eliminate DRS.
