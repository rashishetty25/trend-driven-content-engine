But others don't seem to have a direct connection – so what’s the real reason behind this sudden Miami hype? Is it just because it's a flashy US race, or are teams seeing it as a big opportunity for sponsors and brand exposure? Or maybe something more corporate-driven?

Then again, this is F1. And they’re already doing it in Formula E, so why wouldn’t it work in F1?\n\nAnd also to drive the front wheels, or only to harvest energy?', ""Canada '24, Las Vegas '23, Singapore '23, Silverstone '22, Abu Dhabi '21"", '> Then again, this is F1. And they’re already doing it in Formula E, so why wouldn’t it work in F1?  \n  \nThere are no real reasons besides ideology on why it wouldn\'t work, weight and safety regulations can be adapted to work with a front electric engine.  \n  \nOne question also is the electric engine exclusivity contract of Formula E, which goes until ~2039 (can\'t remember if it\'s 25 years from inception or 25 years from the first season). [And how they define their exclusivity](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-would-need-permission-to-go-fully-electric-formula-es-agag-5293944/5293944/).  \n  \n> But FE CEO and founder Agag said such a move would not be possible due to his championship\'s agreement with the FIA.  \n> ""Ross said that Formula 1 could go electric in 10 years - and basically, they can\'t,"" Agag told Autosport.  \n  \nThe question is how if their (all) electric exclusivity defined - i.e. electric drivetrain currently used is attached to the drive shaft before gears, so it acts as a booster to the ICE, similarly to MGU-H is between the turbo and can recover energy and deploy energy to act as an anti lag for boost. So it\'s all an enhancement of the ICE and not directly connected with the drivetrain.  \n\nSo does the Formula E exclusivity apply for direct deployment & recovery? Which would limit the options that Formula 1 has for electric deployment/recovery?  \n  \n[Even using alternative storage technologies is apparently part of their contract to propel an electric engine](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/agag-aiming-to-coordinate-f1s-electric-future-with-formula-e/), so it isn\'t just BEV & recovery:  \n  \n> “Because we have, in Formula E, an exclusive licence for the [electric] championship. We will have an exclusive licence for hydrogen, it’s in our licence too.', ""Front MGU-K was discussed within the engine group for the 2026 engines. Generally rumor is that all but Audi and Porsche were against it, majorly because of Audis experience with high performance front axle MGU-K. The discussions were limited to only front axle harvesting, but using it for some kind of all wheel drive would be trivial once a front axle MGU-K exists. Currently F1 is not wishing to have any front wheel drive, so it was only discussed for harvesting. \n\nThey wouldn't discuss it if it wasn't possible. It also has nothing to do with a simpler ICE, from a inline 4 (the most powerful F1 engine ever made) to a V10/V12, the front axle MGU-K could always be used, if wanted. \n\nCurrently it's just an issue of each manufacturer fearing of advantages and disadvantages for their own engines and business. That's why Red Bull would love a V10 starting tomorrow, while Audi would love a TDI with two MGU-K. And why Mercedes build the AMG1, so they get experience with front axle MGU-Ks."", 'Abu Dhabi 21 was really boring outside of the last 5 laps. \n\nJeddah just prior was so much more entertaining and intense.', 'I find it interesting, also because you hear so many different opinions about it.
