The same thing can be seen in the new Quadrant video where Max Fosh and Zac Alsop drive an F4 car.

Why is it so difficult to start one of these cars? What makes them any different from a normal road car in this regard?","['Hilariously all this talk of clutches and nobody mentions the lack of a flywheel.  Road cars are easy to drive b/c they have a big heavy flywheels which make slipping the clutch and keeping the engine running very easy (regardless of the number of plates).  Race engines use ultra light flywheels (if they even have them at all) which when combined with a clutch that has a a very on/off setup makes it incredibly difficult to modulate and not stall the engine.', ""The clutch on racing cars is very temperamental. You cannot slip the clutches. They only work for launch within a small rev window. If you know what it is, no problem. But if you're driving a car for the first time it can be tricky to get the feel for it."", 'Tiny grippy clutches. Need more rpm to leave and go on/off like a light switch. Coupled with the fact they\'re hand actuated instead of foot actuated like people driving road cars are used to.\n\nIf you\'ve ever driven a car with a 7.25"" twin disk, it\'s that but worse, and with your hand instead of foot.', 'I mean, stalling a manual transmission road car is easy enough (especially if you aren\'t used to that particular car\'s clutch bite point). That\'s with a car that is optimized to be friendly to the driver, with a reasonably wide band where the clutch with comfortably engage.\n\nNow increase the torque of the engine massively, and reduce the travel and ""forgiveness"" of the clutch just as much. Oh, and you\'re using your hand for the clutch instead of your foot (in most cases).', 'Many people are mentioning that very high torque makes these cars difficult to set off. This completely wrong. First of all, high torque makes the engine more difficult to stall. Second, the V10 Renault in the Top Gear clip has a torque of \\~440 Nm at 16.000rpms. That is the same amount of torque as any German 2l diesel sedan, such a BMW 320d at 2000rpms.\n\nThis engine is powerful because it can operate at up to 19.000rpms, but it has a tiny amount of torque at low-rpms.\n\nYou really need very high rpms when releasing the cluch not to stall. Now image that you are sitting in a 900hp monster, which an engine that makes crazy sound, and that crashing it would cost millions of dollars in damage. And the engineer tells you ""Rev it to 9000rpms, and release the clutch"". Would yo do it? No, you would be scared of doing that because you know that the car will start accelerating too fast. So you would first try to use lower rpms and release the clutch slowly, which would make the engine stall.', 'I think the Top Gear one they over egged it for TV', 'People will talk about the small clutch bite points but the real reason people tend to stall is because they’re just not used to operating a hand clutch and often don’t give it enough revs to navigate that unfamiliarity', 'Those V10s and V8s actually had very limited torque.\n\nAnd a tiny hand clutch with zero feel.', ""it's just counter intuitive to anyone who doesn't race F1 how the car takes off.\n\ntbh it's pretty normal when you step into any new car if you're not familiar with where the bite point is that you'll stall a couple times. especially when it's as unforgiving in an F1 car""]",216,101,0.9,216,1034,1034,-1,0,0.0,-1
