1ouzdb2,Has the testing ban/limits stunted Ferrari performance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ouzdb2/has_the_testing_banlimits_stunted_ferrari/,2025-11-12, Technical,"I recently listened to the High Performance Podcast where they spoke with Miki Hakkinen.

And one of the things Miki spoke about was his frustration that Ferrari were able to test so much more than McLaren (or any other team).

He basically said that after a bad race he knew Monday morning, Ferrari would be out on their test track. That as soon as a season was over, they'd be on their test track. And there was no limit to how long they could test for each day.

In contrast, McLaren had to go to Silverstone, where they could only run between 10:00 and 17:00 and it would be raining.

This got me thinking, that a lot of Ferrari's woes have come since the testing ban. Was their test track and near unlimited testing their golden goose?

Do you think Ferrari failed and still struggle with the limited testing? Unable to properly utilise simulation and wind tunnel and much perfered real world running to teat upgrade parts?","['I mean yeah. Thats a given.\n\nA track on the doorstep of your factory that you own will always be a massive benefit to you when you can test on it whenever you want and for how long you want.\n\nFerrari had cars running at Fiorano non stop back in the day.

Ferrari and Lotus were once the only teams with their own race tracks. Lotus had Hethel and of course Ferrari had Fiorano. \n\nOf the two, only Fiorano became a world class facility, and Ferrari used it a LOT. Elio de Angelis famously said he would never drive for Ferrari because he didn't want to live at Fiorano, he may have been exaggerating a little during the 80's but by the time Michael Schumacher arrived at Ferrari in 1997 that's exactly what Michael did - lived in an apartment (Enzo's old apartment actually) right on the circuit. Testing everyday and sometimes into the evening when it was practically dark.\n\nThis was of course a huge advantage for Ferrari and something that by this stage no other team could do."", 'No, i’ve heard somewhere they have the best mechanics and engineers.

However, it impacts all the other teams too. \n\nOther teams have seemingly adapted to the switch and having to use the digital world and simulation.

When the loopholes close they are kind of screwed. I think they used the flexiwing as an example but again I forget.

With the new regulations coming in in 2026 there will probably be some shuffling in performance between the teams. What I wonder specifically, is how this will affect McLaren.

As we all know, one of the advantages of making your own engine is that the architecture and general construction can be adapted to the kind of car your team wants to build. Now, I assume (maybe wrongly), that the engine freeze from 2022-2025 also more or less locked in the architecture of the Mercedes engine, allowing McLaren to eventually overtake them in performance.

So I wonder (and I hope there is someone more technically versed than me), if there is a chance that the new Mercedes car goes into a different direction than the McLaren and that the McLarens will struggle (at least in the first season) to come to terms with the new engine.","[""As likely as it is for any team.

I used google colab for this if there is some error don't grill me for it. I just wanted to see what would be the possible combinations for Norris to win the title. If someone finds an error I'll delete the post.  
  
Norris would win the title with just one podium and 3 minimum P5's with Max winning all and Oscar in P2 always. This is the most lazely way Norris could win the title.

I am a Verstappen fan so this is the closest fight we can get for Max to win the title I believe because by the season end Max would have more wins than Lando and that would give the title to Max.

I agree that Oscar's penalty was not right as he got squeezed with nothing else he could have done. If anything it should just be a racing incident.

This happens way too often where the driver looks to simply not be checking their mirrors. 

  
Nearly every racing sim I play have proximity indicators (red arrow/circle that tells me theres a car alongside). I use these all the time when I am too focused on the corner, and unable to check my mirror/radar. It has saved me countless times.
