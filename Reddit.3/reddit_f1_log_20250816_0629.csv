1mqs6kw,Lawson blames set-up gamble for Red Bull demotion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mqs6kw/lawson_blames_setup_gamble_for_red_bull_demotion/,2025-08-15, News,,"[""The demotion actually has given him a chance to save his career.

Liam’s merch was mysteriously delayed for half a year and was set to “release” in June. \n\nBut then you also look at the optics of a Japanese driver in Yuki, sponsored by a major Japanese company, and right before the Japanese Grand Prix.

The demotion for Lawson was actually a promotion and Lawson is on good form now, which he wouldn’t have shown in that second seat. Yuki’s career is now hanging on by a thread as a result of performing so well in the opening two rounds. \n\nI do think that second seat situation will improve in the next ten races. For one, it can’t really get any worse, but mainly because the team principal has NO choice but to get performance out of that second car before the end of the season to prove that he is actually worth keeping around.', 'Not a great headline.

It might be an unpopular opinion, but I think the original Hockenheim was overrated. It was great in the 1980s when engines were varied, but the modern regulations meant that it soon became pretty dull. The redesign kept the spirit of the original while improving overtaking opportunities and I do not think it deserves the criticism it gets. The same applies to Fuji. I know the switchback maybe is not terribly interesting, but I can see what Tilke was going for -- it is easy to get off-line when attacking or defending, and since that leads into a gargantuan straight, any mistake is really going to be felt going down to the first corner.
