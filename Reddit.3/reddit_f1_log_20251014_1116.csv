For me, I would pick:

Brazil 2022: IMO, this is the best race of the season (even above Silverstone) but it gets a bit forgotten these days because it happened during the second half where Max started to dominate. Russell's first win, Merc 1-2, Charles getting tonked on the first lap by Lando but recovering to finish 4th, Red bull drama, Alonso recovery to finish 5th from 17th. The entire weekend was just great tbh starting with Magnussen's shock pole.

Italy 2023: Another race that gets forgotten because it happened during Max's dominance but it was quite fun, mainly because of Sainz fighting the red bulls and then the battle between Charles and himself. (No risk charles, no risk)

USA 2022: Another race overshadowed by Max's dominance but actually a really great race. Sainz getting tonked by Russell on lap 1, multiple safety cars, Alonso sent flying by Stroll but still recovering to finish in the points, Charles' majestic recovery drive and his (mini) battle with Max, RBR's botched pitstop which meant we briefly got to see Max and Lewis battli for the lead and, of course, Seb driving like an absolute madman to hold off Magnuessen on the line. (He even led the race briefly!)

Suzuka 2022: For a rain curtailed race, this was pretty good. Max and Charles tearing away from the rest of the pack in the first few laps was crazy (until Charles' tires fell off), Charles going off at the last few corners to let Perez through, Alonso and Seb's crazy battle to the line... a good race considering the circumstances. 

I am a newer F1 fan so I can't speak much for older races.

Neither of us can find the size limitations anywhere (we tried to find exact measurements but then realised they’re not public). It would preferable to have the 2025 limitations, as this is the car they’ve chosen to do but if that’s not a thing then any *recent* car will do, even 2026, as that is probably the next option.","['The technical regulations for F1 are public: https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_formula_1_technical_regulations_issue_8_-_2024-06-24.pdf\n\nFront Wing is 3.10, starting on page 25', ""You can find the 2025 f1 technical regulations on the FIA [website](https://www.fia.com/regulation/category/110).

Here is an overview of the historical context of their victory.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o5ygh5/oc_mclarens_clinching_of_the_2025_constructors/,2025-10-13, Statistics,,"[""I think one thing contributing to this is the lack of a clear second team.\n\nMcLaren clearly aren't as dominant as the early Mercedes run was, but  the fact that RBR, Ferrari and Mercedes are scrapping behind them means that they're able to seal the title earlier."", 'Shows how good their drivers have been despite what many try to say on here. \n\nThe car has not had as huge of an advantage as the other dominant ones that jump of the page in that graph - most weekends they have been less than 2 tenths ahead of the rest. \n\nThe second graph suggests this aswell.', ""What's more crazy about these graphs is how few distinct teams there are in the list. But also it's fun to see both Benetton and Renault in the list considering that the former became the latter in 2002, and Brawn becoming Mercedes in 2010 too.\n\nBasically that list, if you count only distinct teams rather than teams that became other teams, only has 6 teams in it: Williams, McLaren, Ferrari, Renault (Who you'd now know today as Alpine), Mercedes and Red Bull.\n\nMaybe Cadillac can win a season or two and we finally can add a distinct team to the list..."", ""No way this McLaren won it earlier than any of the Schumacher era Ferrari or Hamilton era Merc teams did.\n\nIt's dominant but still a fair bit off cars like the F2002, F2004, W05, W06 and W07. Those cars were pretty much impossible to beat on pace outside of perhaps 1 or 2 exceptions per year (and even that's pushing it).\n\nThink it's the lack of a proper second team - Red Bull has only one driver, Merc have a rookie who is still learning and their car only works under specific circumstances, and Ferrari despite producing their worst car in a decade outside of the 2020 tractor were 2nd in the standings for a long while (despite never looking like winning a race)."", 'I thought 1958 was the first WCC not 1979?', 'No idea what is in those charts', ""Further to that point - Both Red Bull and Mercedes haven't consistently had 2 drivers in the points as well, which allows a few more of the midfielders to snag points here and there, which obviously cuts into the points that any of Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull score"", 'They beat every season of the Ros-Ham combination. They deserve some respect.', ""It's the final year of a set of regulations and every other team has pretty much maximised their package, and on most race weekends the McLaren still can't be touched and that covers a broad variety of circuit types and surfaces. If that doesn't say dominant I don't know else can. The drivers are above average but nothing special. There are better drivers on the grid that wouldn't have fumbled away any races this year; the McLaren should have won every race this year barring a double mechanical DNF."", ""Its hard to say. If Max had been in that mclaren, i am inclined to believe this would have been a repeat of his 2023 dominance. Heck, with how consistent the mclaren car has been, he could have won all races (compared to 2023 singapore for example). Ofcourse thats assuming yuki being his teammate, with Oscar or Lando as his teammate, they would surely have taken a few wins from him atleast.\n\nAll those earlier dominant seasons had a well proven driver (top 5 of all time imo) at the absolute peak of their powers. Is Oscars or Lando's performance even close to theirs? I think not.""]",30,19,0.9,30,19,19,10,6,-0.04999999999999993,10
