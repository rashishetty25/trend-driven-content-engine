**Let‚Äôs rewind.**  
In qualifying, Adami told Hamilton that Verstappen was *‚Äúon a push lap,‚Äù* then immediately said he was *‚Äúslowing down.‚Äù* In reality, Verstappen *was* pushing. Hamilton ended up impeding him and received a three-place grid drop.

**During the race (Lap 76 of 78):**  
Hamilton asked:

>‚ÄúAre they still ahead by a minute?‚Äù  
Adami replied:  
‚ÄúCharles on medium, McLaren on hard. Lapping ‚Äò16 very close to each other fighting.‚Äù  
Hamilton responded:  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not answering the question. It doesn‚Äôt really matter I guess. I‚Äôm just asking if I‚Äôm a minute behind or?‚Äù  
Adami then clarified:  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 48 seconds.‚Äù

**Post-race:**  
Hamilton asked quietly:

>‚ÄúAre you upset with me or something?‚Äù   
No response.

**Context matters.**  
This isn‚Äôt the first awkward moment between the two. In Melbourne, Hamilton told Adami *‚Äúleave it to me‚Äù* when he received repeated reminders about engine modes. In Miami, he criticised the team for delayed team orders with the sarcastic, *‚ÄúHave a tea break while you‚Äôre at it.‚Äù*

Hamilton has said publicly that there‚Äôs no issue and that these are normal race situations. But with repeated miscommunications and visible frustration, questions are beginning to surface.

Is this a case of two people still learning to work together, or is there a deeper mismatch in communication styles? Could Ferrari‚Äôs overall decision-making be contributing to the problem? Is it time for a change, or does this just need more time?

Curious to hear what others think.","['Look at vettel and Adami(he ordered Ricky sometimes instead of other way around), Carlos and Adami(las Vegas 2024) the miscommunication has been eternal at that position.', ""As bad and awkward as all of this sounds, i wonder if Adami himself is getting Ferrari'd over the comms by his team. all we hear is LH<-->Adami, but Adami has to contend with everything Ferrari throw at him."", 'Adami should have been canned years ago.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUcbbUKWpxA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUcbbUKWpxA)

F1 Tempo shows Leclerc ahead in the tunnel by 1.5-2 tenths. Yet the ghost video shows Norris ahead at this point. It seems they either sync up the second ghost to always be ahead or just make the whole thing up. 

Idk how F1 tempo gets their data but i heard they are very accurate most of the time. ","['I always wondered if the ghosts were actually accurate.', ""Honestly its pretty tricky to calculate. First of all you are converting a gps position to relative position. Then you have to project it onto the camera using the correct FOV.\n\nI also don't believe they update GPS position very frequently (maybe every 100ms?) so you are essentially getting a linear interpolation between all of the GPS points\n\nDon't forget that when the source car updates GPS and when the ghost car updates GPS is also out of sync, so you are inevitably going to have interpolation warping.\n\nIt's cool tech, but it's also implicitly inaccurate.\n\nEDIT: Oh also, the live view of the source car is not when they are calculating the relative position from the source. So even from that perspective it is out of sync.  \nThat is, what you are seeing from the onboard, is not the data they are using to calculate the position of the ghost. It's from the GPS data of the source car. If they were to project the source car GPS onto the onboard, you would see pretty large desyncs.\n\nYou know what. If I wanted to save myself a lot of work with the 3D projection, I would probably just import the relative data into a 3D box engine like Gadot/Unreal/Unity, match the FOV in engine, and render out the movement of the entity with a transparent background.  \nThen you could easily just overlay the recording on top of the onboard and you don't have to do jack shit."", ""Sorry OP, I would really love it if F1-tempo was that accurate, but it's not. I think the 3d video has slightly better data, but they're both wrong. I'm just comparing the sector times here.\n\nOn the end of the first sector (after Casino square), per F1-tempo, Leclerc is 0.05-0.1 s ahead, but we actually know that the 1st sector was 18.216 for Norris and 18.290 for Leclerc, so .074 better for Norris, which matches the video.\n\nOn the end of the second sector (after Tabac) the 3d video shows Norris quite a bit ahead, maybe 0.15s (which means Norris had the better 2rd sector), while F1-tempo shows the gap still in the 0.05-0.08s range in favour or Leclerc (so an equal second sector). The actual times show that Charles had a better sector by 0.074s (33.180 vs 33.254) and, incredibly, Norris and Leclerc were level by the 2nd sector line, 51.470s. \n\nThe third sector, per the 3d video Norris might have even been slower, given how far ahead he was entering the swimming pool section, and on F1-tempo, Norris had a 0.185s better sector. In real life, Norris was .109 faster (18.484 vs 18.593).\n\nSo yeah, none of those are very good.\n\nEDIT: TL;DR, it was more or less like this:\n\n1st sector - F1-tempo off by 0.15 for LEC, 3D pretty much right.\n\n2nd sector - F1-tempo off by 0.075 for NOR, 3D off by 0.15 for NOR\n\n3rd sector - F1-tempo off by 0.075 for NOR, 3D off by 0.15 for LEC"", 'Is F1 Tempo 100% accurate?', ""It just looks shit with how much it lags and slides. They have literally all the data they need, I don't know why they can't just overlay it better."", ""Hey there, I'm the creator of F1 Tempo and thought I would chime in. I can't speak for how F1 calculates relative position in their videos, but I can of course comment on how it's done in F1 Tempo. \n\nThe comment by u/f1bythenumbers pretty much nails it in terms of how the deltas calculations work. The core problem that causes inaccuracy is the low frequency data. As distance is calculated by integrating speed, the error in the distance accrues quickly and by the end of the lap there can be large discrepancies. Additionally, laps are taken with difference racing lines, so aligning the data to perform a direct and accurate comparison is difficult.\n\nIn F1 Tempo, I do a drift adjustment using the known total lap time delta to produce a cleaner result. This is crude, because it's only using a single correction to adjust the entire lap, so data within the lap is prone contain drift. \n\nI've been aware of this problem for some time, and have been hard at work on a brand new version of a site that does a better job of delta calculations. I now use the known sector times and distances to perform drift adjustments at the sector markings as well. This certainly doesn't solve the problem completely, but it does help. \n\nThe name of the new site is called GP Tempo, and you can check out the same telemetry [by clicking here](https://gp-tempo.com/app?year=2025&roundnumber=8&session=4&drivers=%5B%22NOR%22%2C%22LEC%22%5D&laps=%5B%7B%22y%22%3A2025%2C%22r%22%3A8%2C%22s%22%3A4%2C%22d%22%3A%22NOR%22%2C%22l%22%3A26%2C%22c%22%3A%22%23F47600%22%7D%2C%7B%22y%22%3A2025%2C%22r%22%3A8%2C%22s%22%3A4%2C%22d%22%3A%22LEC%22%2C%22l%22%3A26%2C%22c%22%3A%22%23ED1131%22%7D%5D&tab=telemetry).\n\nTL:DR, deltas are an approximation, GP Tempo has an improved approach, but the results should still be taken with grain of salt."", 'The data is the same, but gp-tempo.com has a much improved interface that you should use (made by the same guy)', 'I hope all you realize that Norris‚Äôs car is 3D here.\xa0\n\nAs a vfx artist, i can day it is not easy to make it better.', ""Unfortunately, neither F1 Tempo or any other site that uses the Fast-F1 api will be correct.

The ONLY time Monaco is exciting is when it rains.

Thus I would propose the following:

- Make Monaco a Sprint weekend

- Reduce the number of support races, as more prep time will be required between sessions. 

- Have Pirelli bring significantly more sets of inters to the track.

- Prior to every session including the race, and assuming it‚Äôs not raining, send a bunch of water trucks out to wet down the track, to make it suitable for inters but not to the point of needing full wets.  

- Do not wet the run-off areas, the chicane cutting areas, the inside of the tunnel, and the pit lane - for safety purposes. Perhaps avoid wetting the curbs on the racing line at Sainte Devote, Nouvelle Chicane, and the swimming pool. 

- If there are any red flags in the race, re-wet the track once it is safe, unless it is actually raining. This might be just wetting the standard racing line and not the full track width for time reasons.

- Make Beau Rivage a second DRS zone. This may not be applicable if the 2026 rules eliminate DRS.

It infuriates me to no end to see the same comments week after week. ""There's no overtakes, like at all""

Even if that week there were 40 overtakes.

I swear it's just the reality TV brainrot that has corrupted people's attention spans along with tiktok or whatever.

I'm not tuning in to F1 to see 159 overtakes, I'm tuning in to see this amazing engineering marvels dish it out - if someone overtakes - it's fucking amazing. But most of the time, it doesn't happen.
