Norris- towards season's end, he seemed to learn from his mistakes and drove quite a few great races

Gasly- Regardless of whether or not he actually caused damage, a season that clean in the midfield is astounding, and he looked great at the end of the year

Tsunoda- looked calm, consistent, and fast, making 2021 a distant memory, and ensured he's kept in the Red Bull seat conversation, even if the top brass don't want him there

1hdkfcc,How F1 employee bonuses work in the budget cap era,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdkfcc/how_f1_employee_bonuses_work_in_the_budget_cap_era/,2024-12-13, Discussion,"McLaren can give 12mil to employees in bonuses and have it not count against the budget cap.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.



Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""



I did not understand how any of this worked until looking up the regulations, and I don't think many people understand how it works either. I did this digging to comment on another post that the poster deleted, but I thought it was interesting and other people might not know, so I wanted to post it anyway.

1hcveez,Is one of the reason RB wants to drop Checo team morale ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hcveez/is_one_of_the_reason_rb_wants_to_drop_checo_team/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"People talk. The entire team and paddock knows why Checo is there : money.

Would you like to end of third in the WCC because one of the drivers is bringing in enough money that the higher ups are still happy ? You've worked your whole life to end up here, but money talks more than performance. So you're not happy.

This must be bring down the morale of the whole team, and that means people leaving for greener pastures. The majority of people working at Red Bull want to _win_, not to make more money for the stakeholders and Checo's presence is working against that goal.

This might be a significant enough reason to drop him despite the money, especially since Red Bull has been losing engineers left and right since the new regs. It just took some time to percolate up the ranks with enough pressure.","[""F1 is a performance sport. Checo is simply not performing.
