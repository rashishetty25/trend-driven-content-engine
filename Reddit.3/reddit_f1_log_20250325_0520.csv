Because he is driving this car both under and over the limit, the tyres are not in the right window, add an extra 3 tenths to that.

Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were able to easily control the pace of the pursuers, no one had the pace to create great concerns. The degradation was under control on each compound, Andrea Stella confirmed that by monitoring the Stroll pace (departed with the hard) “we realized that a stop was the option to perform”. Haas also benefited from a winning strategy, diversifying and adapting to the conditions.\n\nVerstappen had an ineffective start but at least he was able to return to the distance, the RB21 seems a distant relative of the previous cars. Russell tried to stay around the cars of Woking with a good texture.\n\nThe Ferraris went close to disaster at the first corner, Leclerc fought well with a broken wing, despite a balance damage quantified in 2/3 tenths. For a long phase he could have been better than the seven-time English champion, which shows how well Hamilton’s settings had gone out of the window with high load.\n\nYet the worst was yet to come. The SF-25 remains a car with unknown reactions in terms of long run. From the sprint stars to the stables of the Fia sentence an hour and a half after the race. The inspectors of the Federation measured the cars and found them non-compliant. Leclerc’s SF-25 was disqualified for less than one net weight, Lewis Hamilton’s number 44 for excessive shoe wear that protects the bottom. As well as the Alpine of Gasly the riders have been removed from the standings. The rules in terms of compliance are not questionable and it has already happened that an auto-Venturi was found with excessive consumption of the underbody however suffering a double disqualification is an unacceptable episode for any team. In both cases, Ferrari cannot have benefited in terms of performance, they are both serious but venial errors, the adjustments are simply not working in the long race, unlike the sprint. This could not go unnoticed on a smooth track as the Chinese one is currently.\n\nTHE TECHNICIANS HAVE DISCOVERED THE ENIGMA THAT FOR THE OBSERVERS STARTED BY THE BAHRAIN TESTS.\nAS FAR AS I LEARNED, THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW DESIGN OF THE FRONT PULL ROD SUSPENSION, MUCH LESS WITH THE AERODYNAMICS IN THE STRICT SENSE SINCE IT IS COMPLYING WITH THE STABILITY REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe extra consumption of the plank is not a cause but a consequence. The structure of the rear air does not allow the expected stiffness, which obliges you to increase the height in a closed park to protect yourself with 100kg on board. The main clue is the rear suspension, approved in July last year, together with the new gearbox.\nThe Haas shares the mechanical parts and worked well after the Australian disaster, however it does not have the performance loading platform or the sophisticated Ferrari aerodynamics. In other words, the SF-25 struggles with the excessive softness that is compromising its operation. It looks like something already seen, for example, on the old Mercedes last year. The Red in the right conditions can generate much more load than the previous car, the sprint showed what the car could do with 35 kg of gasoline. The qualification after three hours canceled expectations again, less downforce in the curve and greater instability of the rear.\n\nLoic Serra arrived in October so relatively late on project 677. The French DT has returned to Maranello and is intervening to correct its effectiveness and reliability but clearly it is premature to formulate a solution or its timing. The problem is not easy to solve, the engineers are also working on some update areas that should be introduced new parts from Bahrain.', ""Season is cooked.

Are they genuinely strict, or is there a level of willful ignorance when it comes to substances that boost cognitive endurance and reaction times?

Most people would say that in an equal car Max would be a lot more than two tenths ahead of Hadjar.\xa0\nAlso last season, for the six races Yuki and Liam were team mates Yuki was better but it was close. This year there is a chasm between them.\xa0\n\nOn top of that the general consensus Ive seen on here is that Lawson might perform better in the Racing Bulls car, but yet they still say Red Bull is faster.\xa0\n\nSo take a fast driver that is not Max. Let’s\xa0\xa0say Leclerc. Put Leclerc in the Red Bull and then the Racing Bull, which does he perform better in?

Unfortunately it is hard to tell weather this is true or not as Max has spent practically his whole career in Red Bull. Personally I think that Max’s set up is a factor but perhaps not to the same degree that some people argue.\xa0\nI also think for example that Verstappen would have likely put more than two tenths on Hadjar Im China qualifying if both were in Racing Bulls. Thus Max would have set a faster time in the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nThere is also the argument to consider that Verstappen could also make set up changes to suit him on the Racing Bull which would make it faster for him. \xa0\nSo overall I would say that in qualifying pace Max would set faster times were he in the Racing Bull.

In fact race pace has been Red Bull’s big strength since the new ground effect era began in 2022.\xa0\nEither way it would be so interesting to see and it would be very telling about the performance of the two cars and Max himself’s talents (Were he to jump into the Racing Bull and put a huge gap on Yuki and Hadjar, people could no longer argue Max is only good because he sets up his car so his team mate can’t drive it.\xa0', 'Grill the Grid: Commentator Edition when?']",184,192,0.85,184,182,182,16,1,0.010000000000000009,16

Despite all the well-deserved criticism the F1TV app gets, I love watching old race recaps. The archive is a real treasure trove of long-forgotten F1 moments. I started with the 1989 season and, after many, many hours of watching, I’ve just begun the 2010 season.

There’s something so charming about those old recaps. They’re like a mini race documentary series. They featured insights about the circuit, weekend events so far, interviews, commentary on current rumors, the starting grid, and sometimes even more. They also provide important historical context.

Today’s race recaps, by comparison, feel so dull and cheaply made with the spliced up OG commentary. It genuinely hurts. Especially thinking ahead a few years, rewatching a season will give you just the race, instead of a holistic view of everything happening at the time: the drama, the fashion, the old tech, and so on.

Anybody else feel the same?","['I\'m wondering: Is it because we get SO MUCH information during the broadcast already, what is there to add in the post-race? \n\nMy family are new to F1, and the kids have been watching some world broadcasts out of curiosity, and we\'re like, ""What\'s going on?

""My dad actually used to promise me every year that he would take me to the Singapore Grand Prix, and in the end, we never went, but he's going to be coming to the Grand Prix this weekend, so actually I'm taking him!""

https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/liam-lawsons-rocky-road-to-f1-my-parents-sold-their-house-so-i-could-keep-racing/10658101/

But to get there in the first place, Lawson revealed his parents made a huge sacrifice. ""My parents and my whole family really gave a lot, especially in the early years through go-karts,"" Lawson told Red Bull's Talking Bull podcast. *""My parents sold their house so that I could keep racing. It's massive. They gave absolutely everything for me to be able to race, even just go-karts because it's so expensive.""*

Like McLaren's Oscar Piastri, who lived in boarding school in the UK as a teenager while trying to forge a racing career, Lawson's perseverance was severely tested while 11,000 miles from home. But that early sacrifice often proves a formative experience for the Australian and Kiwi drivers that do make it across and provides them with the steel and grit to survive in F1's often difficult environment.

""I didn't finish high school or anything,"" Lawson shared. ""Honestly, I was just excited to be able to go and chase my dream. And there are always hard parts about it, but there was never a question of whether it was too difficult and I wanted to go home.""

But while he showed promise by finishing second in his first season in Europe, Lawson didn't get picked up by an F1 junior academy right away, and he headed back home to New Zealand's famed Toyota Winter Series without a plan after that, and with his F1 dream on the verge of already being shattered at the age of 17.

""Being from New Zealand, trying to get the money to compete overseas is really, really hard,"" Lawson recalled. ""So, between a group of amazing people that have been behind me, sponsors and investors, we set up the structure to get enough money to go to Europe and do a season and try and get recognised by a junior team, because without it, there was no chance to get a Formula 1.

""I had a good season, but I didn't have any call-ups from any teams. And then I just did this championship in New Zealand's over the off-season, with no plan of what I was doing in 2019.""As a kid being into Formula 1, I would watch this series every single year and I dreamed of driving it. And to me, it was like the Formula 1 of racing at the time.""

Fortunately for Lawson, talent scouts were watching the opening round of the 2019 Toyota Racing Series. And not just any scout, but Red Bull's Helmut Marko, who was keeping tabs on Lawson's older team-mate Lucas Auer, who was part of the Red Bull junior programme at the time.

And even before he would go on to beat Auer, and fellow Kiwi Marcus Armstrong to the title, Lawson would get the news he dreamed of for so long.

""I guess Helmut was watching because of Lucas and I had a really good first weekend,"" he said. ""When I raced in F4 in Europe, Jack Doohan was a Red Bull junior at the time and we tested together somewhere. I remember seeing him walking around in his Red Bull suit and I remember thinking how cool it would be to be a Red Bull junior.

""And I got the call-up after that first weekend in New Zealand, I found out one or two days after the weekend. I was sitting in a cafe - I remember exactly where I was sitting. I got told and it was obviously pretty emotional. I basically got picked up at the perfect time and it saved my career. I had those four weeks left of that championship, and then I had no plan after that...""

Lawson then plied his trade in FIA F3 and F2, going head-to-head with Piastri, dovetailing his single-seater activities with a Red Bull-backed stint aboard a Ferrari GT3 car in the German DTM sportscar championship, that yielded him a runner-up spot.

Finishing third in the 2022 F2 championship landed him a Red Bull reserve role alongside a Japanese Super Formula campaign for 2023, and when Ricciardo broke his wrist in Dutch Grand Prix practice Lawson got the nod to deputise for the Australian for the next five rounds.

In typical Red Bull fashion, it was sink or swim for Lawson, but he kept his head cool and scored points in the extremely challenging Singapore Grand Prix.

Lawson's cameo performances complicated matters for Red Bull in the short term, with Yuki Tsunoda and Ricciardo still getting the nod over Lawson to start the 2024 season while Lawson returned to a reserve role.

But what Red Bull was really looking for in a driver for the renamed RB team is someone who could be a future Red Bull driver. And with it becoming clear Ricciardo isn't ticking all those boxes any more, it has handed Lawson the opportunity to battle Tsunoda for a Red Bull berth.

Following his family's sacrifice to give him a fighting chance, and Red Bull noticing him just when he was approaching a dead-end street, claiming a Red Bull seat would be the third miracle on Lawson's rocky road to the top.

1jj5w9x,Should Red Bull have been more active in trying to keep Ricciardo in the driver pool?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj5w9x/should_red_bull_have_been_more_active_in_trying/,2025-03-24, Discussion,"I know what you’re thinking, but hear me out.

It looked nailed on around Spa that Ricciardo would be jumping into the Red Bull, numerous reports that the Verstappen camp fully expected it and were surprised when it didn’t materialise for whatever reason. Once that decision was made the writing was really on the wall, but I don’t think anyone really expected them to pull the trigger mid season like they did. In my opinion, they should’ve given him to the end of the year and if they’d made the decision to get rid of Checo, could’ve lined up like this in 2025:

RBR: Verstappen/Ricciardo
RB: Tsunoda/Lawson

Hadjar as reserve wouldn’t have been the worst move for his career, and if Ricciardo struggled they then had the option of swapping one of Lawson or Tsunoda into the seat. A year or two would’ve been Daniel’s max stint anyway and that time to develop would’ve benefitted Lawson and allowed Hadjar his route into the sport.

The advantage Ricciardo offered was his years of experience on what by all accounts is a difficult car, and the fact he likes a pointy front end similar to Max and so set up wise they’d be more aligned. It would also give us an insight into just how far Max’s set up has taken the car, and also once and for all answered the Ricciardo question. It doesn’t massively delay any of the RBR talent pool, and they keep a veteran who’s well liked around?","['Hate to quote marko but this is not netflix, bro fell off', 'Just let him go.', 'The great tragedy is he never got back into the Red Bull car for an extended run to see what was there in the tank.\xa0\n\nHe did the test, they were impressed, they wanted him back so they sent him to prove his red bull pace in a car that is absolutely nothing like the red bull???\xa0\n\nCan’t say age when there is older drivers, consistency was a factor but when you don’t mesh with the car that will be a problem.

1jj1bnm,Lawson's speed compared to Tsunoda,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj1bnm/lawsons_speed_compared_to_tsunoda/,2025-03-24, Statistics,"As yet another driver is struggling in the second Red Bull seat, narratives seem to be running wild that take some liberties with the nuances of formula 1. Particularly the ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"" narrative.


USA sprint - Lawson 0,029s faster  
USA - Lawson 0,456s faster  
Mexico - Tsunoda 0,033s faster  
Brazil sprint - Lawson 0,545s faster  
Brazil - Tsunoda 0,373s faster  
Las Vegas - Tsunoda 1,438s faster  
Qatar sprint - Lawson 0,017s faster  
Qatar - Tsunoda 0,047s faster  
Abu Dhabi - Tsunoda 0,053s faster

That means that although Tsunoda beat Lawson in qualifying last year, he was on average only 0,099s faster. Translate that to this year's Australian Grand Prix, and that difference still results in p19. Translate that to China, and you're still only looking at p18 in sprint/p19 in gp instead of p20.


Now don't get me wrong, the point of this post isn't to say Yuki Tsunoda didn't deserve that second Red Bull seat, or that he wouldn't have done (slightly) better. I think there's good reason to believe Yuki's experience could have made a difference. However, let's make that point based on good arguments and wipe bad arguments off the table; bad arguments such as ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"".","[""This implies that performance stays the same regardless of car or environment, which it doesn't. Sometimes a different car can unlock a drivers potential. The elite drivers will always maximize the car, but the not so elite drivers will find different results and at times not do good with a different car, both Lawson and Tsunoda are in the second group. They might do exactly the same but you never know until you see it, and Lawson is doing so bad rn that there's not many arguments against trying the car with Tsunoda."", ""I don't think you can simply take their results from a different car and apply them to the current car, even though we're still in the same broad regulations. Also, comparing this time difference between the two of them also presents it's own issues because no two circuits are exactly the same.\n\nYou'd have better luck if you compared their results as a percentage, in my opinion (though, it still doesn't present an apples to apples comparison)."", ""Clearly the RB is not a good litmus test, it's too different to the Red Bull. It's about finding someone who likes similar things to what Max likes. Daniel was right there."", 'The only logical way to resolve this is promote tsunoda but keep Lawson and compare them both in the red bull while demoting max to racing bulls and see if he can lap the entire field in it.', ""I don't think it's super relevant, as long as the numbers are close. Lawson in the second Red Bull seat could end his career if he doesn't improve dramatically. Red Bull is essentially done with Tsunoda. If the Red Bull seat destroys drivers, let it destroy a driver that they don't need next year. If they're investing in Lawson, they need him to survive the season and he is probably better equipped to do that in the junior team. Let the junior team do its job and develop the less experienced driver. Let Yuki rise or fall on his own merits. The Lawson question is answered: He can't drive the Red Bull to any satisfactory result. Now answer the Tsunoda question."", 'Lol\n\n\nNarratives are going wild!\n\nPosts a narrative in a wild manner', 'none of this matters. no one is going to succeed in the second car at red bull this season. it’s toxic.', ""Speed doesn't matter, in Checos case even experience doesn't really matter. Its just a matter of finding a driver who can drive the car that RedBull tailored towards Max Verstappen. If you can do that it's gold."", ""They were definitely closer than people think. People bring up the qualifying being 6-0.\n\nBut when you realise he only did 1 sessions in America properly because of an engine penalty where he got it to p9 and include the sprints, the qualifying between them was 5-4.\n\nSprints are more volatile and noisy but still I think it's context that gets left out. \n\nMaybe Yuki would handle that Red Bull better, but it wasn't that egregious he didn't get the seat compared to the guy with less experience who was already close to him and who had a perceived higher upside as well as perceived better temperament.\n\nI didn't hate promoting Lawson early so he's doing his learning in the car you ultimately want him to be able to drive. Obviously that's gone horribly so far, but it's still possible with more time he gets to grips with it and the adaptability he's shown previously shines through. It's also possible he never does.\n\nProbably the egregious decision was hiring Lawson over Sainz not over Yuki in my opinion.""]",0,57,0.37,0,54,54,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0

And it's not just due to being continuously beaten on a technical level but the team has been run rather unprofessionally for quite a long time now. Just look at the kind of mistakes they do again and again. 

Memes are all fun and games but ultimately Ferrari's lack of competitiveness hurts the sport overall. This year it was clear that only Ferrari can challenge McLaren for the WCC but just 2 races in it already feels like game over for the WCC. 

In other sports like Football, teams who were once considered very prestigious like Man United lose interest from top players after not winning for an extended period of time and as a result the brand loses its value.

1jj9xcf,If Max or Charles acted like Lando the F1 Media would up in arms.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj9xcf/if_max_or_charles_acted_like_lando_the_f1_media/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"During the closing stages of the Chinese GP Lando’s car had a serious issue with the brake pedal. To ensure he could finish the race in 2nd and the car would make it to the end he was instructed to slow down, avoid hard breaking and just bring it home.

But he refused.

He decided he wanted to chase down Oscar and attempt to win. He proceeded to close the gap to Oscar and put in a fastest lap of the race.

Meanwhile his team were pleading with him constantly to slow down and not use maximum breaking. Eventually after many messages his engineer came on to have one last go at convincing him to slow down by reminding him that finishing in 2nd is better than not finishing at all.

This also didn’t help. It wasn’t until Lando was not able to actually mitigate the issue and it was so critical it was costing him lap time that he started to slow. And in the end it almost caught him out, as he said another lap and George would’ve overtaken him.

As the title suggests, if it was another non British driver in the car refusing to take his teams advice and bring the car home safely in 2nd we would be hearing all about it. About a petulant Max and not being a team player and risking throwing away a 2nd place so he can try and steal the win from his team mate.

But because it’s Lando, nothing. Hell Ted didn’t even mention it in his notebook. None of the Sky team did. They all just ignored it and moved on.
