He has 0 interest in seeing V8s comeback. One he wins re-election that will be the last time he brings it up.  Count on it.', ""I don't care about V8's or V10's if the RPM is still capped at 13K and we're still running hybrid engines with too much focus on electrical energy harvesting. There's nothing inherently bad about V6t engines, the MP4/4 is one of the most iconic and celebrated F1 car ever made and it was running a V6t. It's all the fluff around it that's bad."", 'Go W16 and just have the whole grid set a billion dollars on fire.', 'It just MBS talking bollocks, as usual', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Mohammed bin Sulayem is once again pushing for new engine regulations. A few months ago, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident wanted to bring the naturally aspirated V10 back into Formula 1. Now there\'s a new idea. Furthermore, a twelfth F1 team could emerge.**\n\n> It was one of the most controversial political issues of the current Formula 1 season: the engine regulations for the upcoming season. Next year, there will be new power units. The electric component will increase to almost 50 percent, while the rest of the power will continue to be generated by the conventional 1.6-liter V6 turbo.\n\n> Since the start of the season, several teams and engine manufacturers in the paddock have been pursuing a policy against the new rules. Ferrari and Red Bull in particular are leading the way. Both top teams are apparently concerned about falling behind Mercedes on the powertrain side. Ferrari team principal Frédéric Vasseur and his Red Bull counterpart Christian Horner have advocated for a V10 comeback.\n\n> Both the Frenchman and the Englishman walked through a door opened by the current FIA President, Mohammed bin Sulayem. In February of this year, he announced that the team would be using synthetic fuel starting in 2026 anyway. This would have addressed the sustainability aspect. A return to the loud, screeching V10 naturally aspirated engines, so popular with fans, would be an option.\n\n> Bin Sulayem likely hoped to increase his popularity in Europe with this move. His first term ends in December 2025. He is seeking re-election as FIA President. He doesn\'t have many fans on the Old Continent.\xa0Since the Silverstone weekend, he has had a rival candidate\xa0in the race for the position: Tim Mayer.\n\n> **Engine meeting in Bahrain fizzles out.**\nThe V10 issue escalated so quickly that an engine meeting was called for the fourth Bahrain Grand Prix in mid-April. Bin Sulayem, F1 boss Stefano Domenicali, and the power unit manufacturers were present, as were the power unit manufacturers, who presented their positions. Mercedes and newcomer Audi declared that they would have no engines for next year if the regulations were changed to naturally aspirated V10s at short notice. The proposal was rejected.\n\n> A few months later, Mohammed bin Sulayem is now upping the ante. He told the news agency Reuters: ""The current engines are so complicated and very expensive. The research and development costs reach $200 million (around €170 million), and the engine costs about $1.8 million to $2.1 million.""\n\n> The 63-year-old is therefore emphasizing the advantages of the simpler naturally aspirated engines. Unlike in Winter, however, he is now offering a naturally aspirated V8 as an option. According to the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident, this should be half the price of the current and future engines.\n\n> The new engine regulations are actually designed to run for five years. However, there\'s the possibility of shortening the interval. Naturally aspirated engines could return in 2029 at the earliest. ""We have to do it quickly. It takes three years, so hopefully we\'ll have something by 2029,"" Bin Sulayem insists.\n\n> **Will a twelfth team come from China?**\nIn addition to the engine issue, Mohammed bin Sulayem also commented on a possible twelfth racing team in the premier class. After Cadillac fought its way into the championship against the wishes of the established F1 teams and will enter the race with a Ferrari engine in 2026, another newcomer is expected to join, according to the former rally driver.\n\n> ""The time will come when we believe it is right to reopen a bidding round,"" said Bin Sulayem. The twelfth team should come from China, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident explained.\n\n> Would the existing racing teams welcome this? Hardly. The team\'s payout fee would be reduced because more parties would get a piece of the pie. This was already a major contentious issue in the Cadillac case. Only after the US Congress launched an investigation into Formula 1, because the Americans considered the reasoning for its rejection to be unlawful, was Cadillac granted entry into the premier class.', ""Ben Sulayem did make a good point about the environment. He said that electric and sustainable fuels are two ways towards the same end goal - meaning we need to reduce carbon emissions, and that how we do it doesn't matter as long as we hit the target"", ""It's all likely just nonsense and smoke, but I'd take just about anything pure ICE over the current lame duck PU formula."", ""I don't see either a V8 or V10 happening any time soon. Engine manufacturers have basically no interest in developing big engines, so doing this would cause most of them to leave instantly.\n\nI could see it maybe in enough years that EV tech is far enough along that engine makers are willing to have some pet projects, but for now I just don't see anyone being willing to do it.""]",289,163,0.86,289,2207,2207,0,3,0.0,0

Please keep in mind the table above only covers the actual runs up the Goodwood Hill, and there's much more to see around the event itself around the paddock, as well as several so called Balcony Moments - dedicated mini-celebrations for the legends of motorsports or entire automotive brands - with this year's FOS holding one for F1 veterans like **Alain Prost and Derek Bell** throughout the weekend.

For more info about the complete ""75 Years of Formula One"" celebration programme, you can visit the following link [here](https://www.goodwood.com/motorsport/festival-of-speed/explore/f1-75-celebrations/)

I see a lot of posts about what drivers are better or rank higher, but due to my limited and new interest in motorsports, I'm not sure what to look for in a race that is a sign that a driver is ""better"" than others?

Any help would be appreciated!","['As an informed Redditor, it comes down to whether I like them or not.', 'One key trait that doesn’t get mentioned enough is spare mental capacity.\n\nRookies often need to focus 100% just to keep the car on track, especially in tough conditions. Top drivers like Alonso, Hamilton, and Verstappen can handle the basics almost on autopilot, which frees up brainpower to think strategically, where rivals are on the track, pit windows, tire status, and so on.

Do they overheat or wear their tyres quickly?\n\nQuali - how fast are they over one lap?\n\nRacecraft - how good are they wheel-to-wheel? Are they tactical with their maneuvers? \n\nLevel-headedness/mentality - how easily to they get riled up? Do they wind others up?

Each of these areas can go so in depth that it'd be tough to single out one area that makes a driver better."", 'One of my biggest gripes with F1 discussion particularly on reddit is that people only see two things: the car and the teammate. If x beats y in same car and z beats x therefore z is better than y, the same flawed logic people use to compare athletes in combat sport. It just does not work like that.\n\nThere are so many more factors like one lap pace and being able to deliver it under pressure during a disrupted session.\n\nTyre management and pace across a stint.\n\nConsistency and avoiding little mistakes.\n\nAdaptability in changeable conditions\n\nWheel to wheel racing. Both attacking and finding overtakes as well as car placement in defence.\n\nAbility to produce outstanding results when the opportunity is there.\n\nThere are so many things you can pick up from watching the onboards with intent rather than zoning out and only thinking about the race results', ""There are two main components...\n\nPace...  How fast can they get the car around the track.\n\nAbility to race others... How good are they at passing other drivers...  Which includes ability to analyze where your competitor is slower or faster than you, how to change your on-track behavior to take advantage of that, and both pressuring the other driver into making mistakes you can take advantage of, and getting past them without causing a collision...\n\nSome drivers can set an amazing pace on their own and qualify well...\n\nSome drivers qualify less well, but can get past others in the race...\n\nObviously, if you can do both, you will be a frequent winner...\n\nThere's more, but that's a start..."", ""It comes down to one thing at the end of the day. It's the ability of a driver to adapt to and 100% maximize the grip available to them at a particular moment in time, corner by corner, lap by lap. It's as simple as that. No two corners are ever taken exactly the same. The track conditions change, the air temp changes, the tires change, the car changes, it's a constantly variable and dynamic situation. The very, very best drivers are able to maximize what they have every single corner every single time. This extends to their racing. Lots of guys can run the race line at 99.9% but when there's a car beside them they can't maximize. The very best can.\n\nBut one thing to understand is that the margins are RAZOR thin. On a typical 3 mile lap the difference between first and tenth can be as little as 0.5 seconds a lap. That means the 10th place guy is racing at 99.5% the pace of the leader.
