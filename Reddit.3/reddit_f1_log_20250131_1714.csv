1iecrvx,Exclusive: new FIA technical directive on wing flexing ready,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iecrvx/exclusive_new_fia_technical_directive_on_wing/,2025-01-31, News,"Translation of the article in comments, as required for articles not in English ","[""#Translation \n\nIn the last season the topic of wing flexing has come back into fashion and how some teams manage to 'bypass' the FIA static checks by making the first macroelement hit by the flow flex dynamically. The technical office of the Federation has always declared all the als legal, however, under the continuous complaints and requests for clarification by the various teams, there has been no lack of tightening up regarding the elasticity checks of the ailerons with the usual technical directives that have also arrived during the season.\n\nNew Technical Directive: The FIA had announced that it would not add further tests \n\nLast year, during the Belgian GP weekend , the Federation introduced dedicated cameras to monitor the flex of the front wings through the now classic adhesive dots placed in some strategic positions. Nikolas Tombazis, in an interview with Motorsport, had declared that the tests to measure the flex of the front wings will not undergo changes in 2025. The head of single-seaters for the FIA had in fact underlined the difficulty of developing standardized tests due to the variability of aerodynamic loads between the different cars, making it difficult to replicate real race conditions in the laboratory. However, the issue of controlling excessive flex is still the subject of attention . Not so much in terms of new tests, but rather in terms of updating the current ones, which according to Tombazis have not been changed since 2022.\n\nIt is widely believed that the progress made by Mercedes , Ferrari and especially McLaren is also due to the new specifications of more flexible front wings. One of the most important problems that engineers have to face with these new generation ground effect cars is finding the right balance, because they tend to understeer in slow corners and oversteer in fast ones. According to some important insiders, one way to do this is to think of a 'flexible' front wing that varies its load significantly at various speeds , so as to have flaps that generate more load in slow corners, to counteract understeer, but which then lose angle of attack at high speeds, so as not to make the car too oversteer. This is seen as a good way to control the aerodynamic balance.\n\nFIA wants to approve a new technical directive: will it arrive around May?\nAll the teams are currently involved in preparing for the 2025 season and in the development of the related projects, before concentrating ever more resources in view of the important regulatory change of the next calendar year. The development of the wings, especially the front ones, is always intense and that element, together with the floor, is one of the components in which the teams continue to spend key resources in development. The top teams are those that concentrate the most resources in the development of materials and their elasticity, to the full advantage of aerodynamic efficiency. Not least Ferrari, which at the Grand Prix of the Americas (Austin) had introduced a new front wing updated only in the composition of the materials , maintaining the same aerodynamic shape so much so as to appear visually the same specification.\n\nAs AutoRacer has learned , the Federation has already sent a draft of an update to the technical checks regarding the flex of the front wing . A technical directive that would further revise how much the front wing flap will have to flex during static tests, the only truly real tool that the Federation believes it can use to control flex. It is curious that even McLaren, the most talked about team on the subject, agrees and is one of the supporters of this new possible technical directive, since the Woking team has paid a lot of attention to the Ferrari and Mercedes wings in the second part of last season.\n\nFrom the latest draft delivered to the teams, it would emerge that the FIA has further reduced the maximum allowable flex. According to several insiders, it normally takes 3 to even 6 months of development to adapt and be able to reduce the negative effects of a technical directive linked to the carbon structure of the front wings. Something that would obviously hit the small teams the most, which are already oriented to move large resources to 2026 already in the first part of this 2025 while, in doing so, they would have to review their plans by allocating resources to review wings that they had already defined. From what we have learned, if everything goes in the agreed direction, the technical directive could be officially valid from May . A ping-pong that the FIA is still managing also to evaluate whether to extend the update to the checks also to the rear wings."", ""The FIA as usual are unserious. Didn't do shit last year and then decide deep into the off season that they actually want to do something. Must be a headache for the teams to deal with before a regulation change."", 'Seriously Ferrari and RBR waited six months and FIA did nothing. Now they are doing it FIA comes with this and cause lot of wastage of resources.', 'A mid season TD for non safety reasons in a cost cap era is not cool.\xa0', ""Another TD mid season for no reason when this could have been changed for the regs for 2025. Classic FIA, can't wait for this to ruin my team's season again .üëåüëåüëå"", 'I thought when they decided not to change anything for 2025 that it was the most sensible decision. If they wanted they could have decided differently.\n\nBut saying one thing, then change your mind a month later and introduce mid season not-rule changes is just stupid. Even more so in the context of 2026, and this can be a very impactful change.', 'All my homies hate the fia', 'Omg just let them flex, it‚Äôs amazing what they can do with carbon fiber and it feels archaic to not let them push this further', 'why now?? after multiple times saying they won‚Äôt for ‚Äò25?. they‚Äôre just fucking over the teams especially the smaller ones and probably ferrari and red bull as well']",330,55,0.97,330,54,54,48,3,-0.010000000000000009,48

1iefeke,My experience at a Formula 1 factory,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iefeke/my_experience_at_a_formula_1_factory/,2025-01-31, Throwback,"Hey folks, as the title would suggest, I've had the absolute pleasure to be invited to a formula 1 factory. Not just once, but twice. The first time for a full factory tour, and the 2nd to watch the abu Dhabi final race in 2019. The F1 team in question was Renault (now Alpine) for anyone new to F1. 

I've never seen a more innovative space in my life, so I cannot even imagine what the tier 1 teams like Ferrari/Red Bull and Mercedes are doing in their factories. 

The speed that they operate is, quite frankly, obscene. And it's not like you're watching people run from building to building, from desk to desk in order to be the first and fastest person to complete a CAD drawing. It's very calm, very quiet. But what is fast, is the underlying process. We were told that by the time a CAD drawing had been approved for a physical build (mere hours between the two), that by the time the drawing had made it down to the CAD machine, the next and even better version of that drawing was already in pre approval, and the drawing from 10am was already out of date because the 1pm drawing was coming through, by the time the 1pm drawing made it, the 4pm drawing was the best. The rate of development is not done in days, its done in minutes and hours and I don't think people quite understand just how fast the teams operate. 

Couple of other things I saw. The full chassis, including components such as bare carbon front wings. The wing alone was incredible, not just to look at, but they had us gently feel underneath the wing to see if we would feel the aero holes for data collection. Honestly without looking AND feeling you don't even know they're there, but they're all over the underside of the front wing. I can't remember exactly the distance of separation, but there were hundreds of these holes all designed to send aero data back to whoever needs it. I'm not surprised they cost multiple hundreds of thousands. 

Another section of the factory had, I don't even know what they were called, but machine that were making flow systems for the oil pipes. Now, in my brain, I just figured it would be a beautifully custom pipe made out of carbon/rubber. What I actually learned was that the pipes were clear, and nearly as hard as carbon, so that they could not only check the oil flow rate laterally, but actually see it with their own eyes, and shine a lizard through the oil from straight down to get a three dimensional flow rate to see if all sections of the pipe had equal flow. Imagine looking into a pipe made of glass that has oil flowing through it, and a Lazer measuring the flow rate from both inside the pipe, but from the outside looking in. Maybe this is used in other industries, but it actually blew my mind to see this.

The most secretive part was the gearbox. We couldn't even go in the room, but we could peer through the various windows to see what they were working on. The room was like a 'clean room', everyone was wearing full biohazard suits, and absolutely every gearbox was covered from view, even the other factory guys. One of the Renault folks asked if we could see a fully and half built gearbox, they did a quick look around to see who could see in, checked hands and clothes for cameras and they unsheathed this thing like pulling the mask off Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. Fundamentally it's shaped like a wishbone, and it's like nothing you ever imagined a gearbox to look like. You feel like you could snap the thing in two like at Christmas dinner, but as with everything F1 related, it was full carbon. It just took me by surprise that it wasn't this circular or box shaped mechanical unit covered in oil, but something more aquatic, beautifully milled, shiny and built in a way I'd never seen. 

If anyone has seen that short clip in drive to survive from Williams where they have a wheel and tyre on a jig that comes towards the mechanics so they can practice pit stops, it's seeing stuff like that that truly puts into perspective how these teams operate. Things you've never seen but make sense in the context of Formula 1.

Was an incredible experience, and they're probably 10 fold more advanced than they were.

How I got the invite. It's a ""who you know not what you know"" scenario.

I am planning to attend my first-ever F1 race with my group this year, considering that with the changed grid this year, it might get spicy somewhere in the later half.  
I am looking for some great recommendations in terms of:

* Best track scenery in terms of photography
* Thrilling racing experiences in terms of overtakes, safety cars, viewing angle etc
* off-race events like pre race activities etc
* good track location and accessibility through transport.

I am currently a bit inclined towards **Baku**. However, would love to hear everyone out here! :p","['Search r/GrandPrixTravel', 'Admittedly on the other side of the world from it, but the GP in Austria always looks stunning on the broadcast.

Is the mathematical model dumb?"", 'Wow they are doing Lewis so dirty expecting Lawson to be closer to Verstappen than he will be to Leclerc.', ""I'm excited to see how the rookies do. I liked your Antonelli graph. A rookie hasn't outscored a non-rookie teammate since Charles. Now, if someone does it this year, I very, very much don't expect it to be Antonelli, but I'm interested to see them all try."", 'Without issuing any armchair pundit verdicts about how right or wrong I think these predictions will be, kudos to you OP for creating this. Super interesting and I love your discussion of the model methodology and implications.', ""I am loving this underrating of Lewis here just makes it all the more sweeter when most of these predictions go wrong. It is like most people have completely forgotten why this guy was threat before. Qualifying will not be an issue if you actually analyse the situation here. His pace was always there just couldn't execute as well due the nature of the Mercedes having such a lazy front for such a late braker Lewis was as a result he was prone to not maximising his potential lap times at all. Lewis is already much happier with Brembo brakes on the Ferrari during the first day of the test and that says a lot to me already."", ""I mean, it apparently correctly predicted Alonso 72, Stroll 28. If Verstappen Lawson ends up being something like 61/39, that feels a lot more likely, but it's just a few percentage points off.\n\nI think it largely depends on how good the Red Bull is. If the Red Bull is really really good, I think Lawson will get plenty of podiums, and then his points will be a fair percentage of Max's. But, if the car is not that good, I think Max will still manage some podiums and a win or two, and Lawson might not get a podium, and there would more likely be more people finishing between them, so he'd be a smaller percentage of Max's points. Even if his talent gap was the same in these two scenarios."", 'Lewis obviously isn‚Äôt at his peak form but he‚Äôs still got it.  I expect him to have a similar gap to Charles as Carlos did with him, maybe more tight, potentially more wide.

On the other hand, Lewis, 7-time world champion, is further away from Leclerc. Lewis might be a little passed his prime but still held up against Russell quite well. I think Leclerc might edge Lewis but it will be close.', ""IMO you're overhyping Lawson a lot. Verstappen is better than Alonso and memes aside, Lawson is probably Stroll's match. So the ratio should be even bigger than 72/28.\n\nAlso, \n\n> If the Red Bull is really really good, I think Lawson will get plenty of podiums, and then his points will be a fair percentage of Max's.\n\nWe saw in 2023 why this isn't a given.""]",0,13,0.44,0,13,13,0,9,-0.02999999999999997,0
