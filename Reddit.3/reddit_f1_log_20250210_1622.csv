A lot of teams have rookies this year, or at least drivers changing team, and Aston doesn't. McLaren also doesn't, and I heard about them doing testing, but I think it was an assigned tyre test? Though I wouldn't be surprised if they did some TPC just because. \n\nI don't recall either Red Bull team doing TPC except with Yuki involved. I heard that Honda charges a lot fr those engines. Lawson's only half a rookie, and they are sometimes sink or swim anyway.\n\nI don't think Haas has ever done TPC before this year, but Toyota is covering it now. Antonelli's got about 10,000km in the Mercedes now- obviously almost all of it last year, since current drivers are limited to 1000km a year."", 'AM: You can‚Äôt improve perfection', ""> is it me or is Red bull and aston martin are the only teams who have not been involved in any kind of pre season TPC or tyre test of some sort  \n  \nThe FIA asks teams regarding the Pirelli test and it involves effort to create a mule car, with additional cost associated (outside of F1 cost cap).  \nAs the teams aren't allowed to do any data gathering there (only Pirelli does it, with teams having no idea which tires or compounds are used). So the added benefit is primarily for drivers to vet familiar with the car (i.e. Lewis).  \n  \nFor TPC - it's limited how many days they can do per year, so for Red Bull the primary beneficiary would be Lawson for RBR and Hadjar for CashGrab, but both already ran and tested the cars last year."", 'Hmm.

1im970l,[The Race] FIA finalises new F1 race director plan for 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1im970l/the_race_fia_finalises_new_f1_race_director_plan/,2025-02-10, News,,"['>Looking to the future, the FIA wants to have enough strength in depth that it can rotate race directors and avoid the risks of series being left struggling if a senior figure is suddenly unavailable to work.\n\nI get the idea behind this, but in practice it would be horrible for the sport. The one thing F1 has been sorely lacking recently is consistency, and different race directors are all going to have different quirks, tolerances, and just general mannerisms which could have a major impact on how races unfold.', ""I get why having multiple points of failure is a thing, but I don't think they should rotate race directors or even stewards. Being consistent and the teams/drivers being able to have some kind of baseline into the thinking is more important than the off chance of a race director missing a race or leaving midseason(the last one only left because the FIA fired them). \n\nAs long as there is a good deputy that should be enough for future proofing."", '‚ÄúIf  a senior figure is suddenly unable to work‚Äù.

Red Bull for example used to rotate between Will and Hannah as for who would be on the pitwall calling the final shots in terms of strategy. And well, they didn't have any abnormalities.\n\nBut for that to work the next race director in line and the actual race director have to do quite some races together to get in the same mindset.""]",11,6,0.92,11,4,4,11,6,0.92,11
1ilie5l,Pit Lane Walk ‚Äî Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ilie5l/pit_lane_walk_question/,2025-02-09, Discussion,"So I bought two 3-day-passes (Fri, Sat, Sun) to COTA for roughly 800 dollars and I was just wondering if there was a way to get Thursday Pit Walk tickets seperately? Whether that's resellers or if they go on sale alone when it gets closer to the race? I've never gone to a race before and wasn't in the position to just drop like 4k on two tickets with the Pit Walk included. I've heard they're resold on craigslist but I'm not sure how much I trust that..

Also, if I was to buy Pit Walk tickets seperately for Thuraday (?) would I even be able to get in since my original tickets are only for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday?","['IIRC You either have to buy it as part of the experience packages or receive one from a vendor/team.', 'r/GrandPrixTravel', ""I've done the Thursday pit walk about 8 times now.
