1k3zqmf,Has the ground effect era been a success?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k3zqmf/has_the_ground_effect_era_been_a_success/,2025-04-20, Discussion,"Given this is the last season before another shift in regulations, the question is simple, but also rather complicated at the same time. Most ‘casual’ F1 fans would look at the question at face value, and probably come to the conclusion that no, it has not. The simple reason being Red Bull’s dominance since the introduction of the regulation changes. 

However, there is also the argument to be made that Max’s dominance could mislead opinions. It was only in 2023 that the Red Bull managed a 1-2 in championship standings, 2022 saw Perez finishing 3rd on a similar points tally to Charles, with George not miles behind. 2024 seeing Perez all the way down in 8th. Which suggest as everyone understands, the Red Bull certainly has had its struggles in terms of drivability. 

F1 isn’t just about championships though, so what about the rest of the field? I think the best measure for this is to look at average overtakes per season, given the whole reasoning behind the reg changes was to promote better racing, with cars being able to follow closer to the car in front, and for longer without their tyres being cooked. So, let’s look at the numbers:

2022: 45.2
2023: 50
2024: 38.8

It’s actually interesting to see that bar 2023, numbers were somewhat similar, with similar fluctuations to preceding seasons. 

For me it comes down to two questions:

1) Did it break a one team dominance?
2) Did it promote competitive racing throughout the grid?

For the first I’d say again, a complicated answer. Yes, Red Bull were dominant. However, the overwhelming reason behind this was Max’s pure dominance. With the second seat looking more in line with the other top teams. So, I would argue that whilst on the face of things the answer would be a no, if you take the Max factor into consideration it’s actually a yes. 

For the second, I think as the numbers support, we didn’t see a suddenly more competitive mid to lower pack, with it seemingly staying around the same in terms of competitive performance.

I also think we’re now seeing with multiple years of development of cars under the regs it’s becoming less competitive. The joke of this season being more of a qualifying championship than a racing one, popping up far too frequently than we’d like.

Interested to see other people’s perspective on this topic.
","['Mixed bag really. At the start it was a 2 horse race, then 1 horse collapsed.\n\nIt then had the most one sided championship in F1 history. \n\nBut then, a year later, 7 drivers had multiple race wins, a new record, and a new WCC after 15 years. \n\nNow it looks like a tight WDC between 2 drivers, but Max is always there, and George is 1-2 upgrades away from becoming a shadow contender himself.', 'At first it looked like it, but then overtaking became much more difficult.\n\nFor me the size of the cars is the real problem, on some circuits there is not even space for two cars next to each other. They need to make them smaller and more agile again.', ""Following is significantly easier compared to before but the FiA's refusal to police teams for adding more and more over body down force has led to similar issues with being able to actually pass.\n\nSo in some cases its a success and in others its a failure."", 'I would say no. From memory the idea of ground effect was to allow cars to race more closely and be less troubled by dirty air. It’s pretty obvious that dirty air is still a huge issue. \n\nI feel like the regulations change a lot rather than evolve. Maybe if they evolved then they could find ways to mitigate dirty air etc and have closer racing. Every time regulations reset we seem to end up with the one team dominance you mentioned.', 'It’s a disaster for me personally. They completely ruined it half way through 2022. Now, there is a somewhat close grid but no racing going on. There is a speed order for every track, overtakes are DRS breeze by an say good bye. Either it’s impossible to overtake or easy, never on the edge.', 'DRS, 18"" rims, massive cars, overly complex hybrid powertrains, letting teams outwash the front wing again...ground effect is just one facet of the current formula\'s disappointment.', 'People often get confused about the purpose of the massive regulation changes coming from the 2021 Concorde Agreement.\n\nThe aero regulations were designed purely to improve the racing, to limit the amount of dirty air created by the lead car and the following car\'s sensitivity to that dirty air. They did that. It wasn\'t perfect, with the bouncing and requirement to run so stiff, but they were successful in achieving this goal. Cars were able to get much closer and race for far longer than any recent regulation allowed. F1 stated that the rules worked better than expected for 2022, but these gains were lost more than expected in \'23 & \'24. Some believe that the FIA did a very poor job of policing the developments and allowed certain things that were clearly against the regulations like not having the front and rear wings be continuous pieces. To be clear, dirty air is still nowhere near as big a problem as it was in 2021, but it\'s worse than it needs to be. With how close the field now is, overtaking is much more difficult, so it\'s not an apples to apples comparison when looking at overtakes in \'21 & \'24.\n\nThe other changes - cost cap, sliding scale ATR and restructured prize money were implemented to aid convergence and level the playing field. This was NEVER intended to have an immediate effect. The advantages of the big 3 teams was so ingrained that it was believed it would take 5-10 years to take effect. By that measure, those changes have been incredibly successful, but nothing to do with the ground effect regulations. We have the closest F1 grid in history and 7 teams that have the capability to ""win"" the next regulation reset in 2026. \n\nSo, I don\'t think your 2 criteria for judging the success of the ground effects regulations are good way to assess it. Overtakes weren\'t the goal; better, closer racing and longer battles was, and that was achieved. The overall vision for these regulations from Ross Brawn, Pat Symonds and Rob Smedley was for this be the first step and a proof of concept for the next regulation change to improve upon. Unfortunately, this was handed off to Stefano Domenicali, Nikolas Tombazis and then had to be scraped to accommodate the \'26 PU regulations. We\'ll see if the smaller cars, push to pass and active aero can produce good racing, but that isn\'t the focus of these regulation changes. Improving the racing was the sole purpose of the ground effect regulations and they were successful in achieving that goal.', 'was only one good season during it', 'For a brief moment yes but the loopholes allow outwashing to return and we are back to square one.\n\nI think formula 1 needs to take a step back and think about what it wants to be as a racing series.']",10,67,0.6,10,380,380,-1,0,-0.010000000000000009,-1
1k4h5c6,What rules would you steal from other series?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k4h5c6/what_rules_would_you_steal_from_other_series/,2025-04-21, Discussion,"Are there any rules in other series that you think would be an improvement if F1 was to implement them?

For me there are two I'd bring in immediately.

1. IndyCar's offset timing line in qualifying. Without the need for full in/out laps, teams would be able to get more laps in during quali at tracks like Spa, and at tracks like Monza where traffic is an issue, there could potentially be fewer cars on track.

2. MotoGP's Long Lap penalty. Take Max's penalty at Jeddah for example. If rather than waiting until his stop to serve a 5 second penalty, why not make him take a long lap within 3 laps? It would have likely put him back behind Piastri and maybe we'd have seen a fight for the lead? It would also be fairer on drivers who get a 5 second penalty after their last stop only for the race to end behind the safety car.

What other rules are out there that you'd like to see in F1?","['1) Throw out the apex rule. If the front axle of car 1 is at least at the point of the rear axle of car 2 then car 1 must be given at least a cars width of space.\n\n2) If a driver over takes illegally,  race control tells them to give the place back in x-laps or be given a drive through. Letting highly competitive people/teams decide that in the heat of the moment will only ever create controversy and a time penalty is just weak.\n\nI would love to see those 2', ""Lap time deletion for causing yellow/red flags in qualifying.\n\nLLPs are good on paper but MotoGP's had a bit of controversy because it's a FAR bigger penalty on some tracks than others, and it's harder to implement on four wheels. I think having a position drop penalty like IndyCar has would be better."", ""Not really rules per se but copying from the Formula E Driver notes:\n\n> **It is recommended that Drivers stay in the car in an incident until Marshals are present or communication has been received from Race Control unless there is imminent danger.** A Driver who abandons a car must leave it in neutral with the steering wheel in place & with the DRIVER MASTER SWITCH in the OFF position.\n\nDon't like seeing drivers get out of the car before marshals get to them and things are neutralised on track.\n\nAnd in that same vein, I'd like Race Control to be able to speak over the radios to drivers, whether that is to all when counting in and out of VSC or to specific drivers when there are incidents.      \nNot the stupidness we saw in 2021 but how it is handled in WEC/ELMS & FE."", 'Long lap penalty is nice, until someone gains an advantage again. Like last weekend, Verstappen could have just skipped the whole braking what so ever, and took a long lap with and stayed first. \n\nPlus, the current rule, just give back the advantage or place and you’re off the hook works well. Unless.. you have a driver that doesn’t believe he’s doing anything wrong and the team hasn’t got the balls to say he’s mistaken. \n\nThe long lap works nice in MotoGP because it’s less dependable on track position like in F1.', 'I would 100% steal the ""no work on the cars during Red Flags""  from NASCAR.

Their FP1 and FP2 race pace simulations looked incredibly strong — often outpacing rivals by 3 to 6 tenths over race distance runs. On paper, that should translate to dominance... but when it comes to actual Qualifying and Race Day performance, the story seems different.

We’ve seen in the past how Max and Lewis used to win races with 20+ second margins. With the hype surrounding McLaren this season, I expected something similar. But that hasn’t really been the case. In fact, it feels like the opposite.

Yes, their car struggles in dirty air — we’ve all noticed how poor it is at following other cars. But even in clean air during Quali (FP3, Q2, Q3), their single-lap pace hasn’t looked unbeatable. George Russell, for example, is often right there with them in terms of one-lap performance.

So, is McLaren truly dominant this season, or are we just caught up in the hype? They might be the fastest team overall, but they don’t seem to have the kind of crushing dominance we saw from Red Bull or Mercedes in their prime.

Is it fair to think this way, or am I just expecting too much?","['The sport went from having the Mercedes-Hamilton combination to the Red Bull-Verstappen combination.

If you are not a generational talent then most of your achievements are down to the car per some people online. The question is how much do you care about a random person\'s opinion.

Through 5 races this is tougher to see but I think by the mid-way point it will start to become apparent.', ""It's the clear fastest car but not dominant in any sense imho. I fully discount practice as a datapoint because Red Bull has clearly run lower engine modes since 21 at least and recently also tries experimental setups before (more often than not) getting it all together by Qualifying. The McLaren's main advantage is its wide setup window which lets them hit the ground running anywhere and its ability to look after the rears which only really helps in places with high deg like Bahrain and China. That isn't a guaranteed edge every weekend which is why you see can Red Bull nail their narrow setup window and be on the pace or a close battle at a low deg track like Suzuka or Jeddah that negates the McLaren's tire advantage. In terms of peak car performance when everything is dialed in, the RB21 is close enough that Max can make up the difference."", ""I think they are dominant but we've maybe not seen the ideal conditions in which they can really dominate. In Australia they pulled a HUGE gap on Max in the dry stint before he caught back up to them on inters. In Bahrain, Oscar's gap over the rest of the field was pretty sizable."", ""It's consistently the best car by a comfortable margin.""]",0,48,0.34,0,45,45,0,3,0.010000000000000009,0
1k43o1m,What’s your finishing positions prediction for Mercedes for the Miami GP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k43o1m/whats_your_finishing_positions_prediction_for/,2025-04-21, Discussion,"I did some research to see when Mercedes’s upgrades will begin and didn’t see word of any until imola. I wanted to know based on todays race, the free practices and qualifying for this race how well do you expect Mercedes to do during the Miami GP and what do you think Russel and Kimi could’ve done today for kimi to have ended their races in higher positions today? 

I watched an hour of the Grand Prix but I had to work so I missed the rest of it so I don’t know any apparent things after the one hour mark of the race that the two of them could’ve done to get their self a higher finishing position besides George maintaining his tires to a higher degree.

Better qualifying and race performance (P4/P5 with a potential for podium depending on what others do).', 'Between 1st and 20th', 'I think they’ll finish, where who knows', 'I think the higher track temps may give Charles the advantage over them tbh.

1k4aoyv,What if Sainz is driving the SF-25?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k4aoyv/what_if_sainz_is_driving_the_sf25/,2025-04-21, Discussion,"Now we know Lewis is having trouble extracting performance from the Ferrari and he's further from Leclerc than Sainz normally was, but I was watching Leclerc's interviews and he said that he hasn't been this comfortable with a car in a very long time. He pointed out that the car is less predictable now but he likes it that way. Lewis also said that the car fits Leclerc's overseer-heavy driving style really well. 

Now that makes me wonder, how would Sainz handle the SF-25? The car's balance seems to be pretty similar to the early-form F1-75, a car that Sainz had difficulties extracting performance from. Personally I think Sainz would struggle in similar way to how he did in 2022, maybe to a slightly lesser extent. ","[""Charles has also said the car is very difficult to drive & he kept making a lot of corrections through out the race.I don't think this car is that similar to f1-75.\n\nThe level of comfort that Charles had in f1-75 for first half of the season was something else.He was literally flying in Aus 2022.\n\nAnd about Sainz I think he will do better than Hamilton bc he is inherently more familiar with the car but he will trail slightly behind Charles just like he always did apart from 4-5 weekends."", 'This car is nothing like f1-75. An unstable rear doesn’t necessarily means the car is oversteer, actually it has a lot of understeer, the front end isn’t responsive in the corners. It doesn’t suit Charles driving style, he just coped with it better.', ""Who knows? Carlos' first year with Ferrari was very similar to where Hamilton is - a mixture of P5-P8 etc, with Charles ending up P4-P7 alot, which is a current trend so far this year. \n\nSo, I would guess - probably about the same?"", 'He would do better than Hamilton, but be slightly behind Leclerc, as he always was', 'I actually do think the gap would be bigger than the average gap between Charles and Carlos but yes, less than the one with Lewis.\n\nThe SF-25 is slow, that’s the big issue, but Charles actually seems to love to drive it. The pace isn’t there but he’s very comfortable in the set up and driving it and has found a way to extract everything out of it.\n\nEvery-time Charles is comfortable in the car, the gap between him and Carlos grew. Considering Charles usually can comfortably out-qualify Carlos in Bahrain and Saudi, my guess is the qualifying gap in Bahrain would’ve been around two tenths but bigger again in Saudi     \n\nAnd then I think Charles would have the clear advantage in race pace, I think that’s where he actually had more of an advantage over Carlos.\n\nOn tracks Charles likes, when he’s comfortable with the car and not making small mistakes in qualifying, it’s very unlikely Carlos would be a real threat to him. Yeah he might be doing a bit better than Lewis but I still don’t think Ferrari have any reason to regret their decision.\n\nTheir fastest driver is still their fastest driver so they haven’t lost any footing in the drivers championship. Might hurt their WCC but any money they lose by a place lost in that they gain by the profitability of Lewis Hamilton on their team. \n\nFerrari have also had the same two drivers since 2021. It’s good to get a fresh perspective on the car from a different driver. No, not developing the car in Lewis’s direction but input from drivers is necessary to make it faster. \n\nCharles and Carlos were incredibly competitive which meant they learned a lot from each other, and to have new teammates means they now have different drivers to learn different strengths, like tracks that neither Charles or Carlos were particularly strong at.', ""On average in qualifying Hamilton is actually slightly closer to Leclerc than Sainz was beginning of 2021 when he joined Ferrari. So maybe Sainz would've performed better this year had they kept him given his familiarity with the team and their cars, but it's not a sure thing. It's only been 5 races"", ""Hard to judge after 5 races. Good to see Sainz getting to grips with the Williams but he only has 5 points in the standings Vs Albon at 20. The same with Lewis. He made the below expectation start with Ferrari but Carlos was judged over 3-4 years at Ferrari. We're only 5 races in we still have 19 races and 5 sprints left. Let's at least give it a season.\n\n Hamilton doesn't look like he has the answers now but who knows maybe Ferrari adds more downforce or rear grip to the car which can help improve his performance"", 'He’s not.
