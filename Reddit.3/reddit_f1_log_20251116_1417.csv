The Alpine is fucking awful, how can you shine in that tractor compare to Antonelli and  Hadjar  who have very good cars ?', '2007 exists. \n\nBortoleto, Hadjar, Bearman and Antonelli are gonna have great careers though like the 2019 rookies', '2001, 2007, 2019', 'This year is insane in terms of the amount of good rookies. We’ve had seasons with rookies who performed than this year’s bunch but never this many. So I guess it comes down to quality vs quantity.  \n\n2019 was a great rookie class with George who dominated Kubica, Norris who immediately won the quali h2h against Sainz but had a solid distance to him in the races, and Albon who finished every race in the top 6 when he was thrown into the Redbull.  \n\n2007 was also great. Hamilton had the greatest rookie season ever and almost won the title. Kubica was not too far behind Heidfeld who was a solid upper-midfield driver (similar to Norris v Sainz in 2019). And Kovalainen often gets overlooked but he beat Fisichella more and more comfortably throughout the season and outscored him in the points. Vettel the second half of the season, did some rookie mistakes but showed glimpses of what was to come (Japan is the best representation of what I mean).  \n\n2001 had Montoya, Räikkönen and Alonso. Montoya obviously was feisty, already got his first win and performed close to Ralf Schumacher but generally was behind. Räikkönen was very well-matched with Heidfeld from the beginning (though Heidfeld was only in his second season himself). Alonso was in a Minardi and is therefore difficult to judge. He won the quali h2h with 16-1 and the race h2h with 3-0 (Minardi had DNFs in the rest of the races lol).  \n\nAll of these rookie classes I’d rate slightly better in quality but slightly worse in quantity. The unique thing about this year’s rookie class is that there are so many and not a single one is bad. The ones I mention all have great talent but I glanced over people like Bernoldi, Davidson and Giovinazzi. For the first time in F1 history, we’re at a point where every driver on the grid is good enough to be in F1.', '2007 had Lewis Hamilton.']",0,22,0.18,0,21,21,0,22,0.18,0
