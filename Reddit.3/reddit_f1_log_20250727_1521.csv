Racing is rarely done in the rain anymore primarily due to extremely poor visibility, not because drivers can't control the cars. Modern tires and diffusers create a massive amount of spray, making it impossible for drivers to see other cars, even at close distances and high speeds. This lack of visibility significantly increases the risk of severe accidents. While drivers like Carlos Sainz enjoy the challenge of driving in the rain, the safety concerns related to visibility with multiple cars on the track are the main reason for the reduced frequency of rain races.

why don‚Äôt they just put on a safety lap for q1 and q2 and then safe tires for q3?

1ma0s2k,How much risk is involved with upgrading anything now compared to just focusing on next season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ma0s2k/how_much_risk_is_involved_with_upgrading_anything/,2025-07-26, Technical,"I genuinely thought that after a few races in we would not be seeing any more upgrades at all and only tweaks to previous components as well as the upgrades from the first few races. The only explanation I can think of related to the longevity of a teams perfomance is that these are upgrades that  let teams collect info for next year's car already and therefore act as testing for development, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if any components from this year's car can be reused/repurposed for next year to such a degree that it's worth it. It feels like it should be new concepts and cars like with the last regs but I'm not sure. 

It seems crazy to me to invest into this year's car unless you're red bull trying to get verstappen a title(since the constructors is decided anyway), and we have teams still slapping on new parts and spending budget on parts that won't even get to see a whole season instead of preparing for a whole new set of regulations. 

Is the squeeze of one extra constructors worth it perhaps? Since it's a few millions difference between constructors points maybe it's just worth it to spend a million or two in trying to secure another placement no matter what (or many if you're sauber squeezing out a few extra positions)? Is it to appease drivers or sponsors to not make them feel 'abandoned' for the season? 

It just feels like every dollar spent on the new reg is exponentially more valuable than the current one to me, and I'd love to see some discussion on what could make this strategy actually seem reasonable and effective rather than desperate which is how I feel about most of these upgrades right now.

Williams could just as easily finish P9 as P6 given how close everything is.

I'm not sure how other people feel about this as seasoned viewers, but as a new viewer who doesn't know which driver/team I want to root for, it seems like the broadcast wants me to root for either McLaren, Redbull, or Ferrari. 

I understand these are the more popular teams, and their drivers are usually leading races, but the broadcast and camera seem to be split 90% those teams, 10% the other seven teams. 

There have been countless times that the broadcast focuses on someone like Piastri or Max cruising in 1st with no one behind them for 10 seconds, and in the meantime, there are 3 overtakes happening in the range of 12-20th place. 

I feel like they should be showcase the lower tier driver's more often, trying their best to capture all the overtakes and intense moments happening in that range, instead of only the top 5. That way, those drivers' skills and personalities get to be shown to more people. 

Additionally, it seems like the camera crew/operator often cuts to important moments right after they happen, causing the need for many replays throughout the match. This isn't detrimental, but is still very annoying, because I can see on the on-board cams that something is happening, but the camera crew doesn't show it. 

Just thought I would share my experience as a new F1 fan, would be interested to know if anyone else has had similar thoughts!","['I agree the midfield is very exciting this year and would love to see more of that action.', 'TV direction hasnt been great, thats definitely a common and shared complaint. They do focus on front runners, as you say even when nothing is going on and theres a real battle further back. Missing key moments by cutting away too soon or too late happens every race.\n\nAll that being said, its a mixed bag. We have had plenty of races over the last few years where the leader (often Max) is often invisible because he checked out ahead, so with no hope of action then the focus is elsewhere.\n\nIn short, there is lots of room for improvement, but TV direction will never be perfect, if for no other reason than different people want different things.

This is easy enough to implement during the race, but if everyone sets off from the grid at the same time it doesn't make any difference from starting under the Safety Car.

My proposal is to send the cars off at 3 or 4 second intervals (longer would be ideal, but the limit will be informed by the lap time under VSC divided by the number of cars, then reduced further to create a margin for error). I'm not sure what the exact procedure would look like, but as an example, the starting lights could alternate extinguishing two lights on each side to indicate the next car on each side can proceed.

Once underway, the cars can circulate to clear the standing water, with enough of a gap between them to avoid the worst of the spray. The current rules already allow for multiple formation laps, so there wouldn't need to be any change there. Once the decision is made to start the race, the Safety Car can be sent out for one lap to gather the field before either a standing or rolling start.","['F1 should use all the hot takes on Reddit to dry the track.', 'They already have trucks drying the track.', 'So basically have a track where every part is driven over by a car at a regular interval to help dry the track?

Today they decided to put an update on Tsunodas car that was meant to only be on Verstappen's car this weekend (likely at the expense of not really having spares for it), so that's a topic.\n\nThis sometimes happens to teams, mostly due to accidents or because updates are introduced as soon as there are enough parts to support one car.\n\nTeams don't develop two different cars, though"", ""Every driver sets up the car according to their preferences. Some cars are harder to set up in a way that makes them fast. Some cars are only able to go fast on really sensitive setups. In cases like red bull one driver can handle those extreme setups better than the other. And because Max was winning, they didn't try to change the car in a way that makes it fast even with a less extreme setup until it was too late. \n\nI feel like people don't really understand the difference between car and setup. The car is developed mainly by the engineers and not the drivers. The setup is to make the car more comfortable for the driver, so it's gonna change according to the driver.

This does mean Verstappen will essentially always have priority for updates.\n\nIn addition to this Yuki crashed which damaged update parts, due to the limited number of spares he was reverted to the older spec so both drivers would have spares available if required until more spares of the new spec could be manufactured. \n\n>Does the car change that much from its counterpart based on driver preferences?\n\nIn terms of actual component spec this isn't super common but it can happen sometimes. Piastri has been running some older spec parts than Norris because he, and his side of the garage prefer them for example.\n\nDrivers will however often differ on their setup according to their preferences. This can have quite a significant effect on how the car handles. Verstappen likes a relatively pointy sharp car, which a lot of drivers can't deal with.
