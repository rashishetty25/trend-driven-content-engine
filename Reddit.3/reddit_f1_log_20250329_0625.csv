Williams car was superior in every way to Senna's McLaren and Williams  locked out the front row in a year they dominated with one of F1's greatest car. Prost and Hill were 1.5 seconds clear in qualifying.  

This race saw a number of incidents. A giant airborne crash involving Mario Andretti took out four at the start.

Senna was given a stop-go penalty for lapping a backmarker under yellow flags. 

Then there was a heavy rain shower and leader Prost spun at turn 1 and hit Fittipaldi's stationary car and both were out of the race. 

Hill took over the lead from Senna who had recovered after his penalty and benefited from Schumachers car talkimg off the jack during his pit stop. 

On lap 42 Senna passed Hill for the lead and built up a 16 second gap and won his home race for the second and final time. 

After the race the Brazilian fans invaded the track in celebration of Senna's victory. 

Fangio celebrated with Senna on the podium, the last time they were seen together in public. Even Pelé joined in the celebrations after.

1jmewlx,What would you have done if you were in charge at Red Bull?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jmewlx/what_would_you_have_done_if_you_were_in_charge_at/,2025-03-29, Discussion,"I was thinking about the situation RB has put themselves in and just wondering what I would do differently starting from 2023. 

I always thought it started by the signing of Nyck De Vries. I was against it then because I realized that his one performance (on Williams’ best track) was a fluke. We had four retirements in that race, Monza is probably one of the easier tracks on the calendar, and De Vries had been doing practice sessions all year long for half the teams on the grid. 

If I was RB, I would’ve signed Lawson instead of De Vries in 2023. Danny Ric was the reserve driver and you can keep him on while doing private tests in case Lawson does not impress. Give Lawson all of 2023 and then evaluate your options for 2024 given all that data. 

Even after they signed De Vries, they kept mishandling the situation. In mid 2023, they did that private test in Silverstone with Danny and found out his timings were close to Verstappen’s. Great! Put him in the Red Bull as he has demonstrated good signs and has a similar driving style to Verstappen, AND place Lawson in the B-Team next to Yuki for the remainder of 2023. 

They chose to only test one of them at a time and keep Checo on for almost two years too long because of the financial backing he brought and now it has led them fully astray into chaos. What would you have done?

Bernie Collins put it perfectly in the post-race debrief from Shanghai: Ferrari and Mercedes put Bearman and Antonelli through a rigorous testing program that included simulator work, time in previous cars and working with the team. Why didn't Red Bull do this for Lawson, or for any of their junior drivers? I have heard -- and I stress this is an anecdote -- that Helmut Marko picks drivers by watching them race and if they have a good day when he's watching, he'll sign them up. And then they'll cut the funding off at the first sign of rough waters; look at Kacper Sztuka, who was a Red Bull driver for just a few weeks before they dumped him.

Even when they have had a longer lasting driver like Checo, he was always surrounded by horrible media which they very much fed into and contributed to. Do they just refuse to get behind a driver in any sort of way resembling loyalty (other than Max).

Did this start with Max and the struggle to find someone to compare to him, or has being a RedBull academy driver always been this kind of savage wild card? ","['Yes.
