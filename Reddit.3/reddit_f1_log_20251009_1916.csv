1o1qhvu,2025 Singapore GP H2H Pace/Team Pace by DeltaData_ on X,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o1qhvu/2025_singapore_gp_h2h_paceteam_pace_by_deltadata/,2025-10-08, Discussion,"Sample used:

 What is clean air pace in Formula 1?  
  
When we talk about clean air pace, we‚Äôre referring to a driver‚Äôs true performance when not affected by the ‚Äúdirty air‚Äù coming off the car ahead.  
  
 Dirty air is the turbulent airflow generated by a Formula 1 car, which reduces downforce for the car behind, making cornering more difficult and increasing tyre wear.  
  
That‚Äôs why clean air pace gives us the clearest view of a driver‚Äôs pure and consistent speed, without external disturbances such as traffic.  
  
 For fair and accurate comparisons, we standardise several factors:  
  
\- Only laps on the same tyre compound (soft, medium, or hard) are compared.  
  
\- We apply a typical degradation per lap rate for each compound.  
  
\- A fuel correction is also included, adjusting lap times to remove the effect of fuel load ‚Äî essentially equalising every lap to simulate running at zero fuel weight.  
  
Obviously, there may be many external factors that we are unaware of that can influence a driver's performance, such as strategy or not needing to push to the maximum in a stint. Therefore, we try to carefully evaluate each driver in order to avoid including laps that are not representative.

1o25y3g,Flashback: Cinematic Showcase of Vettel's 2017 Championship Challenge [OC],https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o25y3g/flashback_cinematic_showcase_of_vettels_2017/,2025-10-09, Video,"the recent event of the Singapore Grand Prix took me back to 2017 and made me realise how my favourite race kickstarted the unravelling of my favourite driver's championship challenge, Seb almost didn't put a foot wrong the entire season and was ever precise and ever consistent, but it just wasn't meant to be as sheer luck was the deciding factor that season, not skill in my opinion, this is a commemoration to a season that should have arguably gone Vettel's way and given him that elusive Ferrari Championship.","['That Asian leg was cursed.\n\nSingapore into the engine issue in qualifying at Malaysia into a spark plug caused retirement at Japan.\n\nThats at best 65 points lost assuming Vettel wins Singapore, Malaysia and comes 3rd at Suzuka.\n\nEven with a conservative win at Singapore and 3rd in both the other races its still 55 points dropped which more than makes up for the final gap.', ""There's just something about the SF70H that I find quite beautiful."", ""Vettel's prime season. He was the best driver in 2017, no dout."", 'That‚Äôs such underrated season, up until Singapore it was super exciting, Seb and Lewis were exchanging wins.\n\nBut yes after Singapore things derailed quickly for Sebastian.', ""If the Ferrari car in 2015 and 2017 was on par with the Merc, Seb would've won both seasons. Those years will still remain as his best driving seasons in my book as a Seb fan."", 'What could have been without this atrocious set of asian races.', ""If Vettel had half of Alonso's luck in 2012, this was a sealed deal. The engine issue screwed him big time at a crucial moment in the championship"", ""There was no challenge. He won 5 races to Hamilton's 9. There was no beating the Merc rocketship over the course of a season until Max achieved God-like synchronicity with his car.\xa0"", ""for real though, what hurts even more was the fact that these three circuits are some of Seb's strongest ones and it's a real shame of what could have been."", 'Would Ferrari switch positions in Singapore? Because Kimi was definitely getting first at turn 1. And Max probably 2nd, Vettel start was bad.']",60,40,0.91,60,35,35,5,1,0.010000000000000009,5
1o1zcnn,Sainz has driven for almost every major historical team without ever being the No. 1 driver,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o1zcnn/sainz_has_driven_for_almost_every_major/,2025-10-09, Discussion,"I was just thinking about it and I don't know of any other driver like Sainz who has been signed by every major historical team without ever being signed on as the ""No. 1""  driver

- Renault when they were putting all their weight behind Hulkenberg
- McLaren with their new wunderkind Norris
- Ferrari with Leclerc
- Williams with no true #1 and #2 driver but with Albon who has been there for several years already

Edit: the point of the post was more of a curiosity about drivers in the past who were also seen as fast and consistent enough to move through all the big teams without ever being expected to challenge for the WDC","['Except when he was at  McLaren?', 'McLaren he was clearly number 1.\n\n2019 scored basically double Norris\'s points and 2020 edging him out by 8 points. But he was definitely not there as number 2. He was never disadvantaged in any way to favour Norris.\n\nHe left McLaren to go join a top team challenging for wins and titles at Ferrari which McLaren weren\'t able to at the time.\n\nNorris wasn\'t really bought in as a ""wunderkind"", he was just a rookie driver being given a shot at a time when the team weren\'t challenging at the top, they didn\'t treat him like a Lewis Hamilton. He came in off the back of an F2 campaign where he won a solitary race and was soundly beaten by George Russell.\n\nSainz did so well as Mclaren\'s lead driver he got a chance to win races at ferrari.', 'I think the point you‚Äôre trying to make is that Sainz has driven for every major historical team without being *an established* driver, and more importantly, he‚Äôs always improved team‚Äôs position in the standings after joining, which looks set to continue with Williams (also thanks in major part to Albon).', ""He was de facto number one at McLaren (at least in Lando's rookie year) but no top team is going to recruit him specifically to be their number one driver - he's a solid 2nd driver."", 'Midfield cars dont really have nr1 or nr2 drivers, they just have two drivers trying to score points and depending on race situation one might end up helping the other( see Albon backing up the field in Singapore so Sainz has less of a gap to claw back to the slow group)\n\nEven at Ferrari i‚Äôd say nr1 driver for Charles didnt mean much, even when Charles was on a title charge Sainz sometimes got the better strategy ( silverstone 22 for example)', '> Williams with no true #1 and #2 driver \n\nAlrighty then', ""I believe Ferrari would have been in a slightly better position with Sainz still in the team.\n\nStill, I think getting Hamilton was the right choice. \n\nI also think that a large part of the issues are within the team, on the organizational side, and if Ferrari is willing to hear, Lewis can have a big impact. If they're not, they're doomed with either Lewis or Carlos.\n\nI absolutely love Carlos, he's been great everywhere he went. But I feel he's a tad below the likes of Max, Charles, Russell in terms of consistency and raw speed. \n\nAs Ferrari needs to constantly aim to the WC, and given that every result different than that is seen as a failure, it doesn't really matter if they end up second, third or fourth. Lewis can have a role in getting a WC, helping addressing issues outside the car. Carlos would have been better than Lewis in the car, but I don't see him having a role in solving the inherent issues at Maranello."", ""It's not exactly your case, but a point could be made for Nigel Mansell not being the no.1 at every major historical team at his time:\n\n- Lotus: joined as a rookie, clear #2. \n- Williams: joined in his first stint with them alongside (at the time) 2x WDC Piquet, treated equally at best\n- Ferrari: perhaps he joined as a #1 driver, but that status definitely wasn't there anymore when Prost became his teammate. \n- McLaren: joined for his comeback alongside Hakkinen who had lead the team in the previous year. I guess you could call it equal status."", 'Gerhard Berger did Benetton, Ferrari, McLaren, Ferrari, Benetton (after MSC had won 2xWDC)\n\n\nTwo 3rd place WDCs\n\n\nHe may have been a number one sometimes though']",0,33,0.34,0,32,32,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
