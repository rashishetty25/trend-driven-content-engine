1l0swi3,First To The Apex,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l0swi3/first_to_the_apex/,2025-06-01, Discussion,"I want to know what people‚Äôs thoughts and feelings are with the rule about owning the corner if you reach the apex first. For me, today‚Äôs race highlighted the issues, but it‚Äôs been like this for a while, I think it discourages racing. What I want, and what I think of, when cars are racing is a show of skill, talent and bravery. A recent example being Max around the outside of Oscar at Imola T1. Space should be left ALWAYS, inside or out, the person making the overtake should have to work for it and use their talent to pull off the move. What is becoming a real issue, and ruining racing in general, is the idea that because you get to the apex first, you have rights to the corner and can force another driver off. That kills all racing. You practically act as if the other car doesn‚Äôt exist, continue on your line and push them into the grass, gravel, or a wall. Racing can‚Äôt exist. You dive late on the brakes, get to the apex first, push the driver off. If anything, the guy being pushed off will get a penalty, damage, or told to give the position back. It‚Äôs formula 1‚Äôs equivalent of diving in football. I wish they‚Äôd change it so it would encourage better racing between all drivers. 

There have been plenty of moves where the drivers have raced fairly, Alonso around the outside of many drivers at T3 in Spain. Lando and Oscar fighting occasionally (yes they‚Äôre teammates but sportsmanship should shown throughout the grid, and encouraged). Moves where just enough room is given. 

Idk, it‚Äôs getting annoying seeing cars dive and others taking avoiding action off the road just for it to turn into an argument over the radio, rather than an on track scrap ü§∑","[""I think it's insanely dumb that you can divebomb, be pixel ahead at the apex, push the other driver off and happily continue on while the pushed guy has to concede because if he doesn't, he gets penalty.\n\nBut drivers themselves decided on this rule, so what I or anyone here think doesn't matter."", ""There shouldn't be such thing as owning a corner. It's motor racing, you should know when to back out and when not to without caring about some divine right to a corner"", 'You could say Max made the apex with George. There has to be a rule somewhere, the problem is where', 'Don‚Äôt force someone off the track, whatever the relative positions are', 'Everything about ""first to..."" is wrong in my mind.\n\n\nIf two cars alongside each other, they both have right to the corner. If the onside car tries to pinch, the outside car can jist hold their lane. If they come together, let the drivers settle it. To me, the only two definitive racing line are the white lines - you cannot race outside of them, so hold your line when getting pinched. If one of the drivers are really sawing at the wheel, then you better get around them quickly, as it is hurting their lap doing it', 'Drivers themselves decided so on this, so who are we to argue?', 'The rule was created with discussion from the drivers.

Is it just me or is the Renault engine impressively more unreliable this year?
