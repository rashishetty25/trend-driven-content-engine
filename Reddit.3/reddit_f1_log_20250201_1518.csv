1iekch6,Another Way to View the 2024 WDC & WCC Trends: 5-Race Rolling Sums,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iekch6/another_way_to_view_the_2024_wdc_wcc_trends_5race/,2025-01-31, Statistics,"We saw many times during and after the 2024 season how the season was split into 2 or even 3 to show the fluctuating form and performance of the top 4 teams. I've instead used rolling sums as a metric to see the changes on a more granular level and most of the trends throughout the season become quite apparent this way.

[5-Race Rolling Sums of the Drivers' Points from the Top 4 Teams in 2024 ](https://preview.redd.it/h4baoovb0dge1.png?width=6792&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9681cd8991ffa13e417226805b0620ce75052d2)

Each point in the graph shows the total points scored by a in the last 5 races, including that GP. So, for example, the value for the 15th race of the season (Dutch GP) shows the total number of points that driver scored from the 11th race (Austrian GP) up to, and including, the Dutch GP.

Some of the trends that stand out are Verstappen's struggles, especially just before and after the summer break, Hamilton's rise and fall in form, and conversely, Leclerc's late season resurgence.

[Drivers who Had the Highest 5-Race Rolling Sums at a Point](https://preview.redd.it/io2cczkx2dge1.png?width=6792&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b053b2cb94b7beccf38eed3dcd34547e0736a30)

At different points in the season there are 5 different drivers who have scored the most points in the last 5 races before that point: Verstappen, Hamilton, Piastri, Norris and Leclerc.

[Perez's Ranking Based on Points Scored in the Last 5 Races](https://preview.redd.it/s95kxlov3dge1.png?width=4519&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4781184a60ddf524e3b09f97f8115ec756f2a8)

Perez's sharp decline is also impossible to miss here. After remaining 8th in this respect for most of the season, the he dropped to 15th place with 2 (two) points collected in the last 5 races of the season.

**On the teams' side of things:**

The fluctuations between the front 4 teams that marked the 2024 season are also clearly evident here, including:

* Red Bull's dominant start to the season, 
* McLaren seemingly having the strongest car for most of the middle part of the season,
* Ferrari's strong finish to the season, and
* The brief period of races where even Mercedes looked the fastest. 

All 4 teams had a point in the season where they were at the top according to this metric.

**Best of the Rest:**

The teams in the middle of the pack have also had a season of ups and downs. Some trends that are reflected in this graph:

* Aston Martin's very strong start to the season leading to a comfortable 5th place with points gained in the first half of the season. 
* RB being the first team to challenge Aston Martin for the title of ‚Äòbest of the rest‚Äô,
* Haas to take over 6th place from RB, having accumulated points more consistently throughout the season, and
* Alpine pulling a rabbit out of the hat at the closing stages of the season.","['Thx for the data, as you said this season was really changeable and you made these‚Äôd changers visual.\nRip Perez and Alpine Renaissance', 'This is nice job.

If the FOM hadn\'t dicked around for months deciding if they wanted them to be part of their good old boy\'s club, maybe 2028 would have been feasible. However, GM/Cadillac is building their F1 team from the ground up. They aren\'t using the business model of absorbing another team like Audi did to make their path to F1 easier. GM just announced recently that they are adding on to their motorsports division in Charlotte, NC to include a facility dedicated to their F1 engine program. So, these things take time and by the end of decade is not the big deal that some are making it out to be. 2028-2030 is near the end of the decade regardless. No new revelations presented here. Just nitpicking by some folks who hope the Americans fail.']",0,7,0.24,0,7,7,0,1,0.01999999999999999,0
