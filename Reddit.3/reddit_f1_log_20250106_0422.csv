1huk9hn,Jacky Ickx 1970,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1huk9hn/jacky_ickx_1970/,2025-01-05, Discussion,"Many agree Jacky Ickx was an outstanding talent and absolute top liner in the early 70s, but he unfortunately never won a championship. After some thinking I realised how his 1970 season was actually spectacular and he was arguably the best driver that year.

That year was marked by Jochen Rindt death, despite him eventually winning the WDC posthumously. Rindt is another outstanding talent and perhaps one of the most underrated drivers ever, back to Ickx, I think the important thing to consider is that year Lotus had the 72, which you can't even begin to describe how much more technically advanced and efficient it was compared to Ickxs 312B. It's an entirely new platform of car and a generation ahead, torsion bar suspension massively improved grip and ride, not to mention the inboard brakes which reduced unsprung mass, and importantly, the amount of downforce the car produced compared to the rest. Yes it was finicky and fragile but there's no doubt is was in a class of its own, yet Ickx was still blazingly fast. In France he led the early stages and set the pace likely in contention for a win before mechanical trouble, and in Britain was absolutely rapid leading Branhan and Rindt before differential failure, Rindt was quite slow that day and only lucky to win because of Brabhams last lap misfortune. Ickx had already lost more points at that point in one during the year retiring from Monaco with mechanical troubled and getting torpedoed by Jackie Oliver in Jarama. Ickx and Rindt then put on a stunning display in Hockenheim changing the lead 7-10 times race long and we're always separated by a car length or two, with Rindt eventually taking the win and Ickx second,  however it's just important to note what Ickx was doing in a car that was so much less capable than the Lotus. Ickx then took a dominating win in Austria then Monza is where the tragedy occurred with Rindt on the Saturday. Nevertheless Ickx put the car on pole and led the early stages befote more mechanical trouble and another win lost. He then won the Canadian Grand Prix, but needed to win the U.S Grand Prix to win the title, but a fuel line issue dropped him to 4th hindering his closing up to the front and eliminating him from contention, Jochen Rindt winning the title posthumously. Ickx ended the season with a dominant win in Mexico. Ultimately looking back it's a tragic year and Ickx is glad he didn't win the title against a dead man who couldn't defend it. There are rumours his mechanic purposely sabotaged his fuel line on Ickxs own will so that he wouldn't win the title, with this theory stemming from an old clip that resufaced on a Belgian TV special on Ickx, although that's a story for another time. 


I just think it's important to consider Ickx was possibly the best driver of the 1970 season and absolutely had the talent to have won a world championship in his career but unfortunately that never turned out to be the case. Still arguably the most complete racing driver of all time!

","['His le mans record tells you how good he was', 'Meh, Ickx was all right. He did perform decently with some great drivers, but overall, his advantage over his teammates was moderate. Rindt, on the other hand, was incredible, and unfortunately, his career was cut short because of his death. Rindt is in good contention of being the greatest one-time champion of F1 (Along with N.Rosberg/Button/Raikkonen). Ickx was beaten quite easily by Laffite and Peterson (Although with Laffite, it happened in the late 70s, when I think he was past his prime). And beat 43-year-old Jack Brabham, who was quite possibly the worst multiple-world champion of F1.', 'He was not much better than Regazonni and got destoyed by Peterson.

There\'s no room for nuance on either end of the scale, is there.\n\nSecond of all, this is why the phrase ""future world champion"" is the most stupid and pointless phrase in all of sports. How can people be so eager to jump the gun and apply a fairly loaded label to a sportsperson, just because they like their personality or mindset or  are showing promise as a youngster.\n\nThe bottom line is that you are either a champion, or you\'re not. That\'s it. Trying to apply prophecies to young athletes with potential, and then those athletes not living up to the hype, leads to a kneejerk reaction in the opposite direction. Just let these guys do their thing, and if they underperform, well, if they have the money, they will keep their seat for a bit longer, but if they don\'t, they will be out.', 'You telling me someone( Scott Mitchell-Malm) rated Max and Liam 5th line-up on the grid. Lmfao stop smoking dude', 'Surely the correct order is Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Red Bull, Mercedes, Aston, Haas, Sauber, Alpine, RB\n\nOr at least somewhat like that, no rookie is going to match their teammate in the first year, I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll happen. They‚Äôll make a few high profile mistakes each and struggle more whenever there‚Äôs changeable conditions or heavier rain, even if they‚Äôre on pace for the dry sessions.']",0,132,0.46,0,797,797,0,0,0.0,0
