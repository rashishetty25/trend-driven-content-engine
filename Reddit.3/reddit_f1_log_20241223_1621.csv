1hk8x55,Why did Mika Hakkinen take a sabbatical from Formula 1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hk8x55/why_did_mika_hakkinen_take_a_sabbatical_from/,2024-12-22, Discussion,"I know for a fact that he took a sabbatical, but a sabbatical is considered a sabbatical given that he/she returns. But Mika did not, instead he went to DTM. Was Mika too old for F1 or did other teams did not want Mika in their car? I dont recall Ron & Mika having a fallout which lead to his sabbatical. Also, how good or bad was his DTM career? I saw some stats on Wiki it said 5th 8th and 11th, but I dont know if Hakkinen's cars were top tier or just mediocre which was unable to deliver good results, or that he was bad in DTM.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the awesome responses.","[""My understanding was that he didn't feel he could commit anymore since the birth of his child, effectively putting his family before the sport. This came to the fore when he stalled on the grid at Brazil in 2001 and was terrified of being hit unsighted. Remember he had a number of big accidents in his career owing to car failures, infamously at Adelaide 1995 for example which nearly killed him."", ""He's transparent about it.\n\nThree title fights in a row took a lot out of him. Melbourne 2001 reminded him a lot of Adelaide and a trackside tracheotomy with a pen. Then Brazil 2001 put the fear of God in him when he was vulnerable anyway. Watch his incar video to see pure, pure fear in his body language then total mute shock as he walks away. \n\nHe didn't want to get into a car at all after Brazil. Dennis convinced him to continue. Then he decided to retire, and again Dennis convinced him to pitch it as a sabbatical, but it never was as far as MH was concerned.\n\nThese aren't my opinion - they're what he's said.\n\nHe's been asked if Spain 2001 was the final straw and he said no, that just sucked. He'd have retired whatever. He didn't have another title fight in him regardless.\n\nHakkinen was my *man* at the time.\n\nReally he had a point re start line fear as the McLaren conked out on the grid a few times that year subsequently."", 'In DTM Hakkinen drove for HWA which at the time was the top mercedes factory team, so the cars were not an issue.

Most people forget that.', 'Curiously enough, I think the late Aki Hintsa told in one of his books that Häkkinen seriously considered a comeback with Williams but after re-evaluating things with him, he decided not to pursue it anymore. The initial decision of sabbatical was highly affected by his crash in Australian GP 2001. Understandably, his 1995 crash was a close call that almost cost him his life and another concussion was a terrifying experience. After having won everything he wanted, the fire just wasnt there anymore.', 'Man, he was my favourite driver back then, always wanted him to beat Schumacher but they always gave a great race, I definitely missed him from the grid when he left.\n\nBut to answer your question, he got older and wised up.', 'He did actually quit 1 year later, so the sabbatical actually ended.', 'I remember reading an interview where he stated his mind wasnt there anymore, and it all started after his near fatal accident in 95. All he wanted was being world champion and he did it, twice. Personally I think loosing the 2000 campaign where he drove so well (his best season) was so exhausting that was kinda the last nail in his decision to retire. 2001 massive unluckyness just confirmed it.']",1254,153,0.96,1254,5467,5467,30,4,0.0,30

Briatore explains its Alpine revival plan",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hk3vwh/after_ocon_end_of_virychatillon_constructor/,2024-12-22, News,,"['New 100 race plan just dropped', ""> We'll start the year with Pierre and Jack, I can guarantee that. After that, we'll see as the season progresses\n\nAka if he doesn't impress quickly, he's out"", ""DeepL translation:\n\nF1: post-Ocon, the end of Viry-Chatillon, the title in 2027... Briatore explains his plan to revive Alpine\n\nEXCLUSIVE. Newly appointed executive advisor to the French team for the past six months, the sulphurous Italian manager agreed to draw up an initial assessment of his return. Esteban Ocon's departure on bad terms, the Viry-Chatillon factory being put on the back burner, his activity in the transfer market... Flavio Briatore did not shy away from any hot topic.\n\nHe is the new man behind Alpine's ambitions in Formula 1. Having struggled with its 100% French project, the French team turned the tables last summer with the return of Flavio Briatore. A successful (Benetton, Renault) but sulphurous manager - banned for life from F1 after the 2008 ‘crashgate’ (Nelson Piquet Jr's deliberate accident in Singapore) - the 74-year-old has changed everything in six months. At the cost of a fair amount of controversy.\n\nWhy did you choose to come back after fifteen years away from F 1?\n\nFLAVIO BRIATORE. Why not? I was already in the paddock as an F1 ambassador and I wanted to get more involved. I had the energy and the time since my son went off to college. At the start of the season, Alpine wasn't up to scratch. I called Luca de Meo (Renault Group Managing Director). I said to him: ‘It hurts me to see my core team in such a state. We started talking to see what we could do. Formula 1 has given me so much. I wanted to offer my services to restore the team's image and put it back where it belongs. I want Alpine to become a real player in F1 again.\n\nYour comeback after the ‘crashgate’ of 2008 came as something of a surprise. How do you respond to your critics?\n\nWhat always counts in F1 is results. I want to be judged on my results. I came back to Formula 1 to win. I didn't come here to be a tourist. I've already been around the world 20 times. That's not what amuses me. What excites me is to see my team win the championship or fight for it.\n\nWhat do you intend to do? And what have you done since you arrived?\n\nI arrived in June. We had two points in the championship. I started to implement the same thing I did at Benetton thirty years ago, that's all. F1 has improved in the meantime, we go to different countries and the market has grown. But the competition between the teams remains the same. Nothing has changed. We've refocused on team spirit. We've changed our main team with Oliver Oakes. We've also signed a charter with Mercedes so that we can use their engine. That's what will enable us to get back to the highest level.\n\nMercedes instead of an Alpine engine... Your arrival coincided with the team's departure from its historic factory in Viry-Chatillon. What are we to make of that?\n\nFirst of all, it's not quite over yet. Next year, we'll still have an engine from Viry-Chatillon (Essonne). We're still married to them (smiles). Now, this marriage comes with a divorce already planned. We've had a great relationship with them. We have a lot of respect for their work. As for Viry, I won several titles and 6 World Championships with them. I'll never forget that. At the time, I was at Viry every other day. The history of Viry is a history of success and championships won. But we had to change!\n\nYou've also been criticised for having made several hundred employees leave the group...\n\nIn F1, I don't think quantity equals quality. I've tried to change that. I don't enjoy reducing the workforce by snapping my fingers. Viry is not the only plant affected. We've also reduced the workforce at Enstone, on the British side. In return, we have signed people with a lot of F1 experience, and more will be arriving shortly. My mandate is to build a competitive team. I'm in the process of doing that.\n\nDo you have any targets in mind?\n\nToday, our objectives are clear: always do better. In 2024, we finished 6th. That's excellent news because it earns us a lot more money than a 9th place finish. Next season, we need to finish 5th in the constructors' standings, ahead of Aston Martin. In 2026, we should be aiming for podiums and victories. And in 2027, the title.\n\nShould we really believe it?\n\nFor the moment, we're on the right track. We haven't just corrected the mistakes for 2024, we've already developed the single-seater for 2025. We've improved the car by almost half a second per lap. For the future, we have a working group entirely dedicated to the 2026 single-seater with the future changes in regulations. Our employees are finally starting to believe in our project: to be in the World Championship in three years' time.\n\nThis quest for the constructors' championship title will be without Esteban Ocon. Why was he dropped before the last Grand Prix of the season?\n\nI have a different view of Esteban Ocon than the general public. We really have to thank him for what he did in Brazil with that podium. But after that race, his head was in his new Haas team. And we were playing for 6th place in the constructors' standings against them. I saw him completely demotivated in the last few races, with too big a gap to Pierre (Gasly). At the same time, I wanted to try out what I had in the pipeline as a driver for the future. It's not that I had a problem with Esteban or that I preferred Jack (Doohan). I don't look at nationality, whether he's Turkish, French, Japanese... I just have to find out who the best driver is.\n\nThere have been rumours in the paddock that Alpine is interested in Franco Colapinto. Can we be sure that Pierre Gasly and Jack Doohan will start the first Grand Prix of the 2025 season?\n\nThe only thing we can be sure of is death (laughs). We'll start the year with Pierre and Jack, I can guarantee that. After that, we'll see as the season progresses. I have to get the team in the right condition to get results. And the driver is the one who has to conclude the work of nearly 1,000 people behind him. Everyone works for just two people. If there's a driver who isn't making progress, who isn't bringing me results, I change him. You can't be emotional in F1.\n\nA quick word about Pierre Gasly?\n\nPierre has done an extraordinary job. He's surprised me enormously this year. He really is OUR driver. I really want to thank him. His attitude has changed completely this season. He's never had an accident. If we've managed to finish sixth, it's thanks to him. I'm sure that Pierre will continue his great work. And that Jack Doohan will be up to the challenge.\n\nAlpine also has another French driver in its Academy, Victor Martins. Will he one day get his chance under your orders?\n\nOf course it's possible! That's what the Alpine Academy is for. We've made a selection. We have the good drivers of the future in our hands. We look at everyone's performances. Victor is one of them. When someone is part of our academy, it's because he has a future with us. It's all a question of results.\n\nDoes this also apply to you? Will you still be here at the end of next season if the results aren't there?\n\nI have no doubt that we'll get results. Zero doubt. We have everything we need to succeed. The support of the Renault group, the engine, motivated employees... I know enough about F 1 to recognise a team that is going to work."", 'It\'s hilarious how Briatore has the title "" Executive Advisor"" , when in reality he acts more like the CEO of the racing team.\nHis past shenanigans is probably the only reason he doesn\'t has that title officially to keep the bad PR in check.', 'Zombie Benetton back from the dead.', '2027. Sounds like a 100 race plan to me...', ""He's gonna cheat, isn't he?"", ""In some ways one could argue that Flavio Briatore's original decision in 2007 to heavily nerf Viry-Chatillon and fire dozens of employees was the biggest stepping stone towards the downfall of Renault. Of course he was the one hired back to deal the final blow to the second oldest engine factory in F1 behind Maranello.   \n\nHowever, it seems like Renault was ultimately not interested in investing in the team and factory at times when it was needed, and for some reason they never really seemed interested to work with Red Bull as a full factory team even though you'd think that's what an engine manufacturer who won 4 back-to-back constructor titles would do, because they had aspirations of their own brand succeeding. If Honda could turn around their situation at the end of 2017, there's no reason Renault couldn't. Maybe it's best they sit out the new engine rules rather than be shite once again."", 'This is the beginning of renault resurgence. You heard it here.\n\nBriatore is a PR nightmare for Renault.
