1n106se,The worst rookie in every F1 season I’ve watched,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n106se/the_worst_rookie_in_every_f1_season_ive_watched/,2025-08-26, Discussion,"For reference, I will not be counting one off drivers like Lotterer, Aitkin or Fittipaldi

**2012:** Ricciardo, Vergne, Grosjean, **Pic**: Bit unfair to give this one to Pic as he was stuck driving a Manor all year, but the other three were consistently good to great (albeit Ricciardo and Vergne’s Toro Rossi was awful for most of the season).

**2013:** Bottas, **Gutierrez**, Bianchi, Chilton, Van Der Garde: An undertalked about driver in my opinion when it comes to discussing the 2010’s worst drivers. Gutierrez was in point scoring cars for two of his three seasons in F1, and he finished in the points a grand total of once.

**2014:** Magnussen, Kvyat, **Ericsson**: I don’t want to be too mean on Marcus, because he is a reasonable driver in F1, and has had more convincing performances than he gets credit for, especially in his last season. Having said that, him being overtaken by Bianchi in Monaco of all places costed his team dearly.

**2015:** Sainz, Verstappen, Nasr, **Stevens**, Mehri: For some reason every time I look up driver ranking lists, Stevens is always ranked over Mehri, despite Mehri finishing higher than him in the standings. Granted, Stevens beat him in more races, but it was hardly Verstappen team mate dominance.

**2016:** Palmer, Ocon, **Haryanto**, Wherlein: I feel for this lineup, because all of them were driving terrible cars. To Haryanto’s credit, he did occasionally beat Wherlein in qualifying, but he never beat him in the races.

**2017: Vandoorne**, Stroll: As much as people like to hate on Lance Stroll, even in this season alone, his accomplishments were a lot higher than Vandoorne’s.

**2018:** Gasly, Leclerc, Sirotkin, **Hartley**: Always looked out of his depth, despite driving a points scoring capable car. Whenever he qualified well, he would tumble terribly in the race. Only scored four points, all of which came down to crazy races or shocking disqualifications.

**2019:** Russell, **Giovinazzi**, Norris, Albon: By far the worst interesting of the three. Had no standout moments all year and was easily beaten by an aging Raikonnen.

**2020: Latifi:** He’s the only rookie in this particular year, but considering the quality of his performances, I think calling him the worst rookie of the year suits him far more than being the best.

**2021:** Tsunoda, **Mazepin**, Schumacher: No words are required here.

**2022: Zhou:** Unlike Latifi, Zhou’s rookie year was alright. Nothing spectacular, but I would say his rookie year was the best rookie year of all the worst rookies on this list.

**2023: Sargeant**, De Vries, Lawson, Piastri: Close between Sargeant and De Vries, but ultimately went with Logan due to De Vries having occasionally out qualified Tsunoda.

**2024: Colapinto**: Really the only driver who can be called a full time rookie in 2024, but he still did alright. Shame he didn’t show the promise from this year currently at Alpine.

Even Sargeant was better (although not by much)', ""Will Stevens, there's a name I forgot existed until right now"", 'Vandoorne’s rookie season was much, much better than Stroll’s. He was about as close to Alonso as Stroll is now, despite the fact he was a rookie and facing a much younger version of Alonso. \n\nStroll’s rookie season was unbelievably poor. He averaged almost a second a lap slower in qualifying against Massa, and the only reason it was close in points was due to Massa suffering a cartoonish amount of bad luck. Massa had 2 random punctures in Russia and Mexico (the latter of which was under safety car conditions), a random suspension failure in Azerbaijan (which cost him a likely podium) and was wiped out by Sainz in Canada.', ""2015: It's been a while but I remember Merhi being way out of his league not to mention he went back to F2(?) and caused a horrendous and quite amateur crash. Not than Stevens was much better.\n\n2017: Stroll over Vandoorne seems so wrong but I do recall alonso absolutely shut this man down. Vandoorne had a really good junior career even if he was a bit older by today's standards. Begrudgingly concede this one.\n\n2018: I remember Hartley being the unluckiest driver on the grid since Rubens at a Brazilian GP which doesn't really reflect in the final results. He was cursed with mechanical issues and people crashing into him at no fault of his own. He underperformed for sure for a 2x WEC champion but I want to cut him some slack. Sirotkin is my pick."", ""The only thing I remember about Esteban Gutierrez was how shitty he was to the Haas team that whole first year.  Grosjean was putting the car into the points and Gutierrez wasn't, and his reaction to that was screaming at the team, telling them they were making him look bad."", ""Hartley did well given he hadn't touched an open wheeler in years.

1n10tny,A valid hypothetical question - would these 3 changes have altered the course of the 2005 season entirely?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n10tny/a_valid_hypothetical_question_would_these_3/,2025-08-26, Discussion,"Hello hello Formula 1 fans. 

I recently found my 2005 season review DVD (""Fantastic Fernando"") and inspired by the season review + some Bring Back V10s discussions, it occurred to me that there a bunch of very likely to have happened ""What if"" scenarios in this year which are not totally far-fetched, abstract nonsense - you know, nothing like ""what if Lewis and Max raced in 2005"" but things that were plausibly likely in the 2005 season. 

I have excluded a compromise outcome on the USGP because that GP is a bit like Fukushima's reactor. Not healthy to touch! 

The question I have for you all is - do they make a material difference to the outcome, which is the first WDC crown for Fernando Alonso. Fernando takes home 133 points vs Kimi Raikkonen in P2 on 112. 

These are the three hypotheticals:

\- In his biography and on some podcasts, **Mark Webber** has revealed that his manager Flavio Briatore wanted him to sign for Renault and drive alongside Fernado Alonso for '05. Mark instead went to Williams, because of the nostalgia pull of it being the team where Alan Jones won his title. Mark had a decent season with the car in 2005, but history would show him a better driver than the actual team-mate of Fernando, Giancarlo Fisichella (who finished P5 in the standings with less than half of Fernando's points). What changes would this have had to the season? (Notwithstanding the obvious; that Mark wins his first race before 2009). 

\- **McLaren-Mercedes** pairing of Kimi Raikkonen and Juan-Pablo Montoya (plus Alex Wurz and Pedro de la Rosa, who did 2 races for an injured Montoya) finished 2nd and 4th in the title. Reliability hampered the McLaren, it provided an impediment to the team that the Renault of Fernando didn't suffer (Fernando retired once due to a broken suspension; Fisi, by contrast, had mechanical gremlins more often). Assuming the reliability had been comparable between Alonso and Raikkonen, does this change the season outcome?

\- **Ferrari,** as the lead **Bridgestone** customer, were caught flat footed when the rules banned tyre changes for 2005. Tyres now had to last the whole race unless there was safety risks involved with keeping boots on. Kimi's crash at Germany that year was an example of the risks associated with 50/50 calls on tyres, for example. Bridgestone had been integral to Ferrari's dominance of the prior seasons, with bespoke tyres just for the Scuderia. Their ability to construct competitive, durable rubber that could meet or exceed the Michelin rubber was not comparable. Hence, the only Bridgestone win is USA 2005. This rule only lasted for 2005, which was longer than the stupid aggregate qualifying. In 2006, Michelin withdraw from F1 and it's only Bridgestone left, with Fernando taking title #2. If the 2005 tyre rule isn't there - either, allowing tyre changes or going straight to the 2006 Michelin withdrawal, does the season look different as a result? ","['1. Webber was of similar calibre to Fisichella, so this wouldn’t change much from reality. Alonso would have destroyed him.\n\n2. The McLaren when it was working was much faster than the Renault. So with equal reliability, Raikkonen would have strolled to the title.\n\n3.  Ferrari would certainly have been much more competitive. I think they would’ve challenged for the title, but they wouldn’t have been as dominant in 2004. It’s worth noting that in the one race where the Bridgestones worked properly at Imola, Schumacher would have won without his mistake in qualifying.', 'Almost a race weekend\n\nAlmost a race weekend\n\nAlmost a race weekend\n\nAlmost a race weekend', 'Michelin was still around for 2006, they won the championship with Alonso/Renault\n\n1) Probably nothing changes with Webber, maybe less points for Kimi/MSC/whoever but Renault won WCC even with Fisico\n\n2) Renault had good reliability also because they were managing their PUs. Alonso started the year very well and because of that points lead Renault could afford to not go all out for every single victory, consistent podiums being good enough. Same thing happened in 06, where Renault ran quite detuned untill a late upgrade in the season\n\n3) rules were made to nerf Ferrari and it worked. Hard to say how good Ferrari would look on a different rubber or in a different rule set, but in the end the points gap was huge even with the indy farce. Is that huge gap only on the tyres or the car was also not great? Very hard to say', '1. It is hard to say whether Webber at Renault would had changed anything. I can\'t actually properly rate him, as while he was a great driver, he spent most of his years at midfield/backmarker teams. Even at Williams, he spent a lot of time into adapting to the car (more time than his teammate Heidfeld) and would had very well been outscored by Nick, hadn\'t the latter had a season ending injury.\n\nWebber was quick, but he wasn\'t ever ""Alonso quick"". Or if he was, we only saw that in 2010, which is just a fraction of his career. I\'d say in 2005 he probably does about the same as Fisichella, then outscores Fisichella in 2006 (with Alonso still winning the championship) and then getting kicked out after 2007 for returning Alonso and rookie Piquet Jr. That said, I think Webber would had won Suzuka 2005 so we wouldn\'t have Kimi\'s iconic win.\n\n2. While McLaren was still unreliable, you have to keep in mind that both Kimi and JPM did a lot of mistakes that year. While the tire blowout at Nürburgring is already minus 10 points from Kimi\'s tally, he is also the one who refused to pitstop for new tyres. So while Alonso gained a lot from McLaren\'s unfortune, he was also more consistent of the 2. In an universe where no driver has bad luck, Kimi would win. But in an universe with better reliability, I think Alonso would still win. Although as a Kimi fan, I\'d love to be corrected on this one.\n\n3. This is a common misconception people have. The tyre rule was done in order to stop Ferrari\'s dominance. But they also produced a car that didn\'t go well with new aero rules. So even without the rule, I doubt that Ferrari would had competed for the championship, but Schumacher would surely have more wins than 1. Which could had impacted championship results in a long run. But it is impossible to say how.', ""1) Renault would probably get the Constructors' in a more convincing way but otherwise I don't see that much of a change. Webber would be lucky to win a race given his history of bad starts from the front (back then in mid-2000s), maybe it would come later in 2006.\n\n\n2) If the reliability wasn't an issue, Kimi would take the championship down to the last race. He'd win at Imola and Hockenheim and grid penalties wouldn't hamper him the way they did. I'm not counting Nürburgring in, that was a mechanical issue and a team decision.\nMcLaren would still have a hard time getting Constructors' since Montoya was quite appalling. In reality, he singlehandledly cost them that title.\n\n\n3) Hard to say regarding this one. It would change the dynamics of the season but the rule change wasn't only associated with the tyre rule - the front wings were lifted, the design of the cars changed quite a lot compared to previous few years. The Ferrari could be a lot closer but still not close enought to challenge for the championships."", ""Alonso would've destroyed Webber\n\nRaikkonen would've won\n\nFerrari would've won"", 'Kimi in the Mclaren was the faster driver in 2005. The trouble is the Mclaren broke if you sneezed at it. Give both Mclarens the reliability of Alonso and they’d take points off him, and Kimi gets the title.', 'Renault often raced with their engines on a lower power mode, prioritising consistent high-scoring finishes over wins. Pat Symonds claimed the only time it was fully turned up was China, when Alonso comfortably had the edge over Raikkonen.', 'I think Webber had an edge on Fisi, but the question is more does he so better in the 2nd car than does he beat Fernando. My assumption is he should have beaten JPM (because of the two missed races), if he goes to Renault over Williams. Certainly, if things play out similarly with AU quali and the timing.']",18,12,0.67,18,11,11,4,0,0.020000000000000018,4

Now buddy is late for everything, racquet feel unbalanced, and his swing is all f-up.\n\n\nCheco will do fine at Cadillac, and I\'m pumped to see him back, but back to the first part of my post.

1n1bykb,Which tracks would you like to see back on the F1 calendar?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n1bykb/which_tracks_would_you_like_to_see_back_on_the_f1/,2025-08-27, Discussion,"Hey everyone,

I was wondering what you guys think about the current F1 calendar. Personally, I feel like we could use a bit more variety. Don’t get me wrong, some of the newer venues are exciting, but I really miss some of the classics that had a lot of character.

For example, I’d love to see **Malaysia (Sepang)** make a comeback the track always gave us great races and unpredictable weather. **Istanbul Park** is another one I think many fans miss, especially with that legendary Turn 8.

Are you happy with the way the calendar looks right now, or would you also prefer a bit more rotation and diversity? Which tracks would be on your wishlist to return?","['Hockenheim.\n\nNurburgring \n\nMugello\n\nIstanbul', 'Spa', '* Kyalami\n* Istanbul Park\n* Sepang\n* Indianapolis (sack off Miami)\n* Portimao\n* Magny Cours\n* Hockenheim', 'Estoril', 'Spa full time. \n\nHockenheim\n\nMugello', 'Adelaide!! \n\n(Yes ok, it’ll never happen, but one can dream)', 'Sepang or Aintree', 'Sepang, Hockenheim is better than the nurburgring GP circuit, istanbul and then an improved Kyalami', ""Agree with Sepang and Turkey, I'd also add Mugello, Hockenheim, India because I don't think 3 races there were enough of an audition and maybe Fuji.""]",12,60,0.88,12,59,59,12,60,0.88,12

1n0pmsv,What’s the future for Yuki Tsunoda?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n0pmsv/whats_the_future_for_yuki_tsunoda/,2025-08-26, Discussion,"What’s the outcome for him after this year? I heard many rumours from not so reliable sources, is he staying in Red Bull for 2026? Many people are saying that he is being dropped after this season or possibly replaced sometime before. I honestly don’t think they’ve given him long enough to get used to the car or team and to already debate his departure when he only debuted in Red Bull in April doesn’t seem fair at all and that they’re expecting him to be on the same level as Max. I hope they keep him so he can show his potential.","[""They're not going to change him out this year, if they swap another driver in at this point they're now stuck with either using Lawson or Yuki or not racing a car in the event that max or <insert driver here> can't drive for some reason, you're only allowed 4 total drivers in competitive sessions during the course of the season (so you don't start selling race seats on a race by race basis...)\n\nAs for the future, it's pretty undeniable that Yuki has deep ties with Honda and he's at red bull/VCARB at least in part because of the Honda engine deal. I don't think Horner wanted to promote him at all, ever, until he was forced to by what he was seeing with Lawson.\n\nI guess where he goes next year will depend a lot on what the rest of his season looks like. Red Bull doesn't have an awful lot of promising young driver talent in the hopper at the moment so that's a point in Yuki's favor for staying as a known quantity. But without Honda greasing the skids, who knows?"", ""We'll see when it happens. \n\nRed-Bull isn't uncommon to change their driver lineup on a whim, and the only driver that is certain of his seat is Verstappen. \n\nIt could very well turn into tsunoda going back to VCARB, going out of Red-bull, becoming a 2nd driver for Red-Bull like Albon did for a year. With red-bull you can never know until it happens."", 'Get ready to learn WEC buddy', ""Until we know just how big the management changes at red bull have truly gone,  we can't really be sure.  If they continue  as they previously did,  Yuki is out for sure.  But Menkes rates Yuki pretty highly,  and there is a good argument that with both regulation changes and management overhauls,  the last thing the team needs is big changes in their driver line up too.  Hadjar has been pretty vocal in saying he doesn't think he's ready for the step up yet.  \nPersonally,  I think they should keep him for a year. There aren't a ton of great drivers looking for a seat right now. Worst case, they can dump him after they've seen how everyone reacts to the new regs, and pick up or promote a driver who is doing great, given how many contacts are expiring next year."", 'Nobody who knows for sure is going to comment online. That said, we have a good idea of what the options are:\n\n1. He stays with Red Bull\n\n2. He stays with the Red Bull family, and drives for VCARB\n\n3. Colapinto gets the axe, and Tsunoda goes to Alpine \n\n4. He becomes a reserve driver for any number of teams\n\n5.

Lawson couldn\'t find his feet in Red Bull and Red Bull didn\'t want to have him completely cooked by the end of the season. They are betting on his future. If the seat is a career killer, they didn\'t want it to kill His career and so they shuffled him down into a familiar team and moved Yuki up expecting about what they\'re getting from him and that car. \n\nI don\'t think Yuki has much of a future in F1, which is a shame because I like him and he was doing ok in VCARB. \n\nThe wild card at this point is Laurent Mekies who has a positive history with Yuki. If Mekies says ""Give him a better car next season and a few races to prove himself"" then he\'ll get the opportunity.
