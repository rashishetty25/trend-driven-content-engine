This is one of the cars from the Bernie Ecclestone Collection. Red Bull purchased the entire collection and plans to build a museum at the Red Bull Ring to display them. if you do not know, Bernie had put together a collection of some of the most important cars in the history of F1. In addition to this 158, he has early Ferraris and Vanwalls. He has the Brabhams from his years of owning the team including the only known surviving fan car. While Bernie owned the collection few of the cars were seen. It is nice to see that Red Bull are dusting them off for people to see.","[""Imagine.

I contacted them to see if they would make those histories available. Sadly they said they are the property of whoever buys the cars. Hopefully Red Bull makes he information available.
