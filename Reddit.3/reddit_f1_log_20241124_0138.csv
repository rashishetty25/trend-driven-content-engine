Compromises had to be found to make it possible for the US team to join in 2026. One of these is that the racing team will sail under the Cadillac flag.***\n\nMichael Schmidt\n\n23.11.2024\n\nIt will be official next week. Formula 1 wants to expand the field in the 2026 season. Eleven instead of ten teams will be on the grid. The newcomer is Cadillac. Behind the General Motors Group's works entry is Andretti's application, which was accepted by the FIA at the beginning of 2023 but postponed to 2028 by the rights holders amid much turbulence.\n\nBut a lot has happened since then. Andretti complained to the US Congress that the rejection was in breach of antitrust law. As a result, the US Department of Justice launched an investigation that could end with serious consequences for Formula 1 if good reasons are not presented against the authorisation. At worst, the US authorities could impose a fine totalling billions. A rumoured ban on Formula 1 appearances in the USA is rather unlikely. That would cost jobs.\n\n***Michael Andretti did not make any friends in Formula 1 with his brash behaviour.***\n\n**How high will the compensation be?**\n\nUnder the threat of politics, all parties involved have now come to several compromises. One condition was that Andretti's name would disappear. It had become a red rag for many in the scene after Michael Andretti's rumbling appearance. And GM feared that the plan to enter Formula 1 would ultimately fail because of Andretti's personnel.\n\nThe project's financial backers, Dan Towriss and Mark Walter, then took Andretti junior out of the firing line, put him off with an advisory role and reached an agreement with Formula 1 that the racing team would sail under the GM brand Cadillac from 2026. So everyone saves face.\n\nA few obstacles still need to be cleared out of the way to make the expansion possible. Here, too, compromises are being worked on. In the current Concorde Agreement, new entrants have to pay a so-called dilution fee totalling 200 million dollars in equal shares to the established teams.\n\nIn the new Formula 1 agreement, which is still being finalised, this sum is to be increased and adjusted to the current market situation. It will then be calculated what the new racing team could earn in the following five years. The sum corresponds to the new compensation payment. The existing teams were hoping for an amount of 600 million dollars to compensate for the smaller share of the cake and the loss in value of the team.\n\nCadillac will probably not have to pay that much. It is expected to be somewhere in the middle of 200 and 600 million dollars. The new method of distributing the prize money has also not yet been clarified. At the moment, the world champion receives 14.5 per cent of the prize money cake after deduction of all bonus payments. For tenth place it is seven per cent. With eleven teams, the key must change.\n\n***Until GM has built its own engine, the team could race with Honda power units.***\n\n**Will the engine come from Honda or Ferrari?**\n\nThe newcomer is not starting with a blank sheet of paper. For over a year now, 200 employees have been working on the chassis and aerodynamics for 2026 in a factory in Silverstone. As Cadillac is not yet part of the Concorde Agreement, the technical team, led by Nick Chester, Pat Symonds and Jon Tomlinson, is allowed to test around the clock in the wind tunnel. The time is also used eagerly. The Toyota wind tunnel in Cologne is largely occupied by the Americans.\n\nThe biggest problem is the engine. General Motors will not be ready with its own engine until 2028 at the earliest. A customer engine must be found for the time in between. Originally, the rule was that the manufacturer with the fewest customers had to step in. Newcomers such as Audi, RB Powertrains and newcomer Honda therefore have a one-year grace period.\n\nIn reality, this rule only applies to ten teams. If an eleventh is added, there are no more concessions. Honda originally did not see itself in a position to supply two teams in the first year of the comeback. Now the Japanese and partner Aston Martin have realised that they may not be able to resist a request from GM. The word in the paddock is: ‘Honda is waiting for a call from Detroit.’\n\n***Toyota has returned to Formula 1 as a technical partner of Haas. A works entry could follow.***\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'time to fire up the news for the 12th team from now on', 'Close enough, welcome back Alfa Romeo', 'Damn these crazy fuckers did it', '1.

It's not just for reducing drag but it is a major reason and for the low downforce rear wing most teams build there rear wing to be as efficient as possible not target huge downforce number and that's why the benefit of trailing edges isn't something that's neccasrily a lot while on high-med downforce rear wing the downforce is the key objective and having trailing edges makes it more efficient and ratio increase as we go up the downforce load on the rear wing. Although teams could still in theory use this concept on low downforce wings but the benefit isn't worth all the wind tunnel they will need to spend on the wings. Remember teams now don't usually advance there rear wings unless there fundamentals and overall car performance is balanced only this year has McLaren started having an arsenal of special rear wings thanks to them being focused more on overall track performance than just performance upgrades.\nRegarding the part you mentioned about attachment I disagree that's never a reason for them to have this especially on the trailing edges of the rear wing it serves no purpose in that regard since it's the trailing of edge of the wing.\nSo to summarize teams can use this on there low downforce rear wings but the benefit is very minimal due to the ratio mattering more on the downforce of the rear wing due to the ratio of downforce to drag as well as the costs especially in terms of wind tunnel due to the limited allowance of it ( also CFD is limited)""]",67,10,0.81,67,81,81,-2,0,-0.009999999999999898,-2

1gxytx4,Why is it worth it for RB to keep Checo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gxytx4/why_is_it_worth_it_for_rb_to_keep_checo/,2024-11-23, Discussion,"I don’t understand. I mean, I know that Checo basically pays for his salary and maybe even Max’s too with his sponsors, but the budget cap means that team doesn’t spend that much anyways (before the budget cap, they spent 250-350 million a year).

The fact that the Red Bull company is a multi billion dollar company too makes it even less justifiable to keep Checo just to keep a few good sponsors.

So why is it worh it to them to keep a now-mediocre driver in the seat and lose the constructors if they have money and the budget cap anyways?","[""Nobod¥ know$. ¥our gu€$$ i$ a$ good a$ our$.\nI'm afraid it wi££ r€main a m¥$t€r¥."", ""Millionaires like to make themselves richer. \n\nCheco isn't paying his own salary.

AFAIK teams aren't able to start on the '26 cars until 1st Jan '25 and WT time is determined by constructors' positioning. Simply put, why not keep Checo until the 1st July next year (when the WT time changes based on the WCC at that point)? Any money loss from finishing lower in the WCC is offset by SP's sponsors, he'll provide a good level of feedback for the '26 car, and the WCC is nowhere near as prestigious as the WDC (especially when you trade it off for the potential of more success in the future)"", 'Red Bull are paid by reddit for every post talking about Perez.

They probably also know what Checo can do as a driver. Firing Checo has a fairly well understood ""cost"".\n\nHiring someone else has another set of risks. The point will be when the potential benefit discounted by the risk exceeds this cost. And all of this has to be decided on a multi-year basis not just for what happens in 2024. The decision isn\'t about ""punishing"" someone, it is about the long term benefit to the team.\n\nOn top of that, RBR would be reluctant to explore outside the RB ""stable"" for young drivers. RBR has reasonable options but none of them scream ""slam dunk"". Tsunoda is average to above average but isn\'t consistent. Liam Lawson looks competent but isn\'t tested in F1. Danny Ric is pretty much out. Hadjar/Iwasu might be better off starting with the junior team. \n\nOutside the RB stable but current drivers would be options like Sainz (apparently they passed on), Gasly (comeback unlikely?) or Ocon. Quite a bit less likely would be to try to secure Leclerc, Piastri, Lando or Russell. I don\'t think Alonso, Magnussen or Hulkenberg are in any consideration. Stroll is out, Bottas is likely out, Zhou is out. \n\nIf thing don\'t work out for McLaren next year Lando or Piastri would be interesting but, given this year\'s car performance and their individual performance this year, it is likely difficult for RB to promise what looks like a wingman seat to either of them in 2025. (Piastri is maybe?) \n\nAnother interesting but probably controversial would be someone like Colapinto - perhaps into the RB team but who to promote into RB? Lawson or Tsunoda again?\n\nIMHO, Sainz would have been interesting and perhaps a missed opportunity.', 'Mick is unavailable for the 2nd seat so they have no valid option other than retaining Checo.']",0,55,0.42,0,375,375,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
