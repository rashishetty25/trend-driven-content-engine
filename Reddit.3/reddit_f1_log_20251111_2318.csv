I am more than aware that races/seasons in past decades have been snooze fests and at times had very minimal overtakes - however back then it was for a different reason - performance disparity up & down the grid.

We are so damn lucky to have such tight laptimes right now... I can't help but imagine what sort of racing & storylines we would have in modern F1 if the cars were an appropriate size.

I have a theory that F1 drivers are continuously caught up in clumsy incidents, purely because they have no other option but to roll the dice. Racecraft has changed completely, focusing on getting to the apex first - then forcing the outside car off the track. It's dull. These are the best drivers in the world, yet their cars don't allow them to be creative.

Sure, here and there we get a glimpse of how it should be (e.g. Piastri around the outside of Norris in Monza, Max just being Max), but we could have sooo much more.

I just sat through the extended highlights of 2009 on the F1 youtube channel, and on multiple occasions Button made the same passing move as Piastri (lockup and all), yet he pulled them off because the cars were smaller, more nimble. The racecraft was impecable in the 2009 Brazil race, so many crossbacks, divebombs, setup moves. Almost every passing move, the car being overtaken had a genuine crack at passing them back... that is motorsport.

Sorry to rant, but it's upsetting to know we are leaving so much on the table right now.

1st: Lando Norris (390 points)
2nd: Oscar Piastri (24 points behind Lando)
3rd: Max Verstappen (49 points behind Lando)
With  3 races left (Las Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi), with a total of 83 points still available.

Norris must be 26 or more points ahead of his closest rival after the Qatar Grand Prix to be crowned champion.

Remaining Races & Maximum Points (Total: 83)
 * Las Vegas GP: 25 points
 * Qatar GP (Sprint Weekend): 33 points (8 from Sprint + 25 from GP)
 * Abu Dhabi GP: 25 points

Lando Norris can  mathematically eliminate Max Verstappen, and second, he must secure the title against his teammate.

A: Eliminating Max Verstappen ( las vegas )
 After Las Vegas, 58 points will remain (33 in Qatar + 25 in Abu Dhabi). If Norris's lead over Verstappen is 59 points or more, Verstappen is mathematically eliminated.
 Norris must outscore Verstappen by 10 points in Las Vegas to be 59+ points clear.

 * Norris finishes P1 (25 pts), Verstappen finishes P3 (15 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P2 (18 pts), Verstappen finishes P6 (8 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P3 (15 pts), Verstappen finishes P8 (4 pts) or lower. (Gap = 60+)
 * Norris finishes P4 (12 pts), Verstappen finishes P9 (2 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P5 (10 pts), Verstappen finishes P10 (1 pt) or lower. (Gap = 58+, but Verstappen would lose on countback).
 * Norris finishes P6 (8 pts) or lower, he cannot eliminate Verstappen in Las Vegas, regardless of Verstappen's result.


 B: Winning the Championship vs. Piastri (Qatar)
Norris needs to gain just 2 net points over Piastri across the next two events (Las Vegas GP and Qatar Sprint/GP).


Scenario 1: Norris gains in Las Vegas
Norris wins (25 pts), Piastri finishes 2nd (18 pts).
Norris gains 7 points.
Norris's lead grows from 24 to 31 points.
Norris could afford to be outscored by Piastri by 5 points and still win the championship (31 - 5 = 26).

Scenario 2: Piastri gain in Las Vegas
Piastri wins (25 pts), Norris finishes 2nd (18 pts).
Piastri gains 7 points.
 
Norris's lead shrinks from 24 to 17 points.
The fight would go to Qatar, where Norris would need to outscore Piastri by 9 points (17 + 9 = 26) over the Sprint and GP to clinch the title there.

Scenario 3: DNF for Norris
 Piastri wins (25 pts), Norris has a DNF (0 pts).
 Piastri gains 25 points.
Piastri takes a 1-point lead in the championship.

C: Abu Dhabi
Any scenario where Norris leaves Qatar with a lead of 25 points or less will take the championship to the final race.
If the gap is 25 points, Piastri would have to win the race with Norris scoring zero points
