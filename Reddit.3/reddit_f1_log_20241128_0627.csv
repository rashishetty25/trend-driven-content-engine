-Red Bull can still theoretically beat their own record for maximum points in a season (569 points set in 2021).

-However they can't break their own record for average points per race (32.6pts/race set in 2020).

Calling 11th team on the grid a sacrifice is funny. Oh noes, more sponsorship money magnets, how bad for business.', ""# Audi, Cadillac and a two billion dollars fine: Formula 1 under pressure\n\n*Behind the scenes of the premier class, things are currently hotting up. At the centre of it all: Cadillac and Audi.*\n\nSomething is happening in the premier league of motor racing that could plunge Formula One into a crisis. Malicious tongues are wagging: Audi is leaving before they arrive. And GM is coming, even though the 'kingmakers' were initially reluctant to let the US company and its partner Andretti into their autocratically run 'golden cage'.\n\nSpeaking of the four rings: just in time for this weekend's Qatar GP, F1 insiders have learned that there will be official confirmation that Audi will sell parts of the team it bought from Sauber in March for 650 million euros. The buyer is rumored to be Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.\n\n**Is Audi selling shares to Qatar?**\n\nThis is fitting: Qatar is already a major investor in Audi's troubled parent company VW. Qatar Holding LLC owns 17% of the shares in Wolfsburg, making it the third-largest shareholder after Porsche (53.3%) and Lower Saxony (20%).\n\nAudi bosses are expected to sell the deal as a profitable investment in the future. Behind the scenes, however, there is talk of window-dressing. Instead of investing the money in keeping jobs in Germany, the oil dollars will be used to finance the company's own engine, which is due to be launched in 2026.\n\nBackground: Audi's parent company Volkswagen has been in a deep crisis for weeks. Three out of ten German plants are to be closed, tens of thousands of employees made redundant and wages cut by up to 18%.\n\nThe F1 project has not escaped unscathed. It is questionable whether Audi will continue to run the team, which is bottom of the Constructors' Championship with zero points this season. F1 Insider understands: “The supervisory board in Wolfsburg is still considering pulling out of F1 altogether.”\n\nAs far as GM is concerned, it was a foregone conclusion that the F1 organizers would relent and allow an eleventh team to compete in the premier class. But the U-turn was not voluntary. The threats of the US judicial authorities to punish Liberty Media for serious violations of US antitrust law have finally borne fruit.\n\n**2 billion dollars fine on the cards**\n\nF1 insiders know how much was on the table as a fine: two billion dollars. To avoid this financial disaster, Liberty boss John Malone has now pulled the trigger. But he had to make sacrifices.\n\nOne of those sacrifices was to allow the entry that his managers and some team principals had arbitrarily and illegally prevented. For months the Andretti motorsport dynasty, led by Michael Andretti, fought for entry to the premier league. In vain. Although the FIA gave the green light, Liberty and some other teams refused. Until the US Congress took up the matter and investigated.\n\nThe ominous press release from the marketer shows that the announcement was made under pressure from the F1 organizers. Formula One is pleased to announce that an agreement in principle has been reached with General Motors to integrate Cadillac as the eleventh team in the series from the 2026 season. No further details were given.\n\nBut the GM approval compromise was not the only one Malone had to make. US investigators also wanted to see heads roll. Liberty CEO Greg Maffei announced his resignation at the end of the year. His successor will be Renée Wilm - currently promoter of the Las Vegas GP and chief legal officer of Malone's media group. The American with Dutch roots is expected to make Formula One more transparent and put an end to unfair cronyism.\n\nRumors have been circulating for some time that F1 chief Stefano Domenicali may also be on his way out. Although F1 denies this, McLaren CEO Zak Brown has been touted as his successor in the Las Vegas paddock. He is close friends with the Andretti clan and is said to have been a key source in the US Department of Justice investigation."", 'The F1 winter season will sure be exciting!', 'Based on all the comments, this news sounds basically like a bunch of bs.

1h19nim,Butterfly effect - How a pastor helped make Cadillac's F1 entry a reality,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h19nim/butterfly_effect_how_a_pastor_helped_make/,2024-11-27, Throwback,"This is a chain of events that started back in 2017 and have contributed in helping Cadillac, reach F1, through Andretti, Gainbridge, Zach Veach and a pastor.

In 2017, after a three-season stint in Indy Lights yielding him four wins and a best of third in the standings, Zach Veach was looking for an IndyCar ride, but several chances were missed, mainly thanks to a lack of funding. That issue was resolved though, when he visited a church in April of that year. Veach asked his pastor, Aaron Brockett, if he had any contacts that could help him fund an IndyCar ride. The pastor new such a person, namely Dan Towriss. Towriss, the head of financial services firm Guggenheim Partners at the time, helped Veach find a ride at AJ Foyt Racing for the 2017 Indianapolis 500, backed by Group One Thousand One, an insurance group.

[More on how the deal between Veach and Towriss took place.](https://eu.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/2017/09/19/how-pastor-played-part-zach-veachs-indycar-deal-andretti-autosport/672681001/)

Veach retired at that race after a mechanical issue, but that performance, along with his junior formula results and his new backer, helped him sign a three-year deal at one of the championship's top teams, Andretti Autosport, driving the No. 26 car, sponsored by Group 1001, as well as Gainbridge, a subsidiary of the former. 

Despite the promise shown though, Veach was unable to consistently show up at the front, scoring three top five finishes over the course of those three seasons. The partnership ended prematurely, three races before the conclusion of the third year of the partnership. Interestingly though, Gainbridge and Group 1001 stayed at the team, fielding James Hinchcliffe for the rest of the season and announcing a new driver for 2021. That new driver was an exciting young prospect by the name of Colton Herta.

Herta already belonged in the Andretti family, through Harding Steinbrenner Racing, which collaborated with Andretti in 2020 and helped Herta finish third in the championship that season. 

With Herta in the No. 26 Gainbridge Andretti car, the partnership between the team and the sponsor blossomed. Herta was performing impressibly, albeit a little bit inconsistently, and was even heavily rumored to make the switch to Formula 1 with Alpha Tauri. This season marked the best one for Herta, who was able to finish second in the standings, only behind Alex Palou. Gainbridge has become the primary backer of the team, especially since it lost its long-standing partnership with DHL last year. Group 1001 has a second company sponsoring another car, the No. 28 Delaware Life of Marcus Ericsson.

With that, Andretti and Group 1001 expanded their partnership, first with Spire Motorsports in NASCAR. Gainbridge would help sponsor both Cup entries for Spire, while Group 1001 would sponsor the team's Truck Series entry in select races, where it would be driven by Marco Andretti, the son of Michael. They have also entered a partnership with Wayne Taylor Racing in IMSA.

Andretti started its efforts to join Formula 1 back in 2023 and in November of that year, announced its partnership with General Motors in order to achieve that goal. In October of 2024, Michael Andretti stepped back from daily operations of Andretti. The man who took over the reigns was none other than Dan Towriss, who owns a large ownership stake in the team and has invested heavily in its facilities.

After lots of ups-and-downs, the deal was finally secured, with the announcement that Cadillac will join F1 in 2026 in collaboration between General Motors and TWG Group, which owns Andretti, along with Spire and Wayne Taylor Racing, all backed by Towriss, a man who entered the sport through the suggestion of a pastor who wanted to help Zach Veach.","['Real bummer.\n\nI really thought that would be a story about Maldonado lol.', 'Long story short\n\nGuy wanted to race but had no money\n\nGuy asked pastor if he knew someone with money\n\nPastor knew someone with insurance money to back him\n\nThat someone said yes\n\nThe company stayed with the team the Guy signed with after the Guy left\n\nThe team got a new Guy who showed promised and expanded company involvement \n\nPeople behind the team expanded because of the company so much that they wanted to go to f1', 'So.. it is more likely that Colton will be the chosen one to drive for Cadillac...', 'Pastor...Maldonado?', 'ChatGP has entered the chat. s/', 'Just happy to see Mario in F1 ....', 'Damn I totally thought it was Maldonado, too.', ""Hi, I'm writing from Paramount.

The next couple of years are going to be very spicy on and off the track.

**2025:**  
  
\- **McLaren** should be right out of the gate fighting for both championships  
  
\- **Ferrari** are coming good, if they do not do their between season mess up of car changes they should also be right there. Here is hoping they fix their core ""Ferrari"" problem which always seems to cost them during the season. Just seeing Lewis in Red is going to get a lot of headlines and those merch sales are going to crazy. Will he be competitive and how is Leclerc going to handle that mentally?  
  
\- **Red Bull:** Who will be driver 2. I honestly can not see Perez fixing his issues. It has been 2 years and the only reason to keep him would be the money being pumped in to Red Bull to keep him. Red Bull also continues is self implosion progress with the in fighting and issues so I expect we see more from that.  


\- **Mercedes**: New young driver, how will he get on and are they finally on the path to also be right up there? With 4 genuinely competitive teams on the cards next season this is going to be amazing for us fans.

\- **FIA:**  I can not see anything but them continue to be a mess. I do not see any possibility of real improvement unless they again have a new CEO and do real effective changes like paying for permanent consistent stewards using the same technology every single race.  


**2026:**  
The new new regulations for me kind of say ""Yeah the big change we said would be amazing, did not really work so we trying again"".  
As many would agree I am happy to see the cars ARE getting smaller, it is not much but for me its been one of the bigger issues with the racing with just the sheer size of the modern cars.  
I am not confident on the new aerodynamic concepts for 2026 and I am a little worried we continue down a path of F1 cars all looking to much the same and I hope that will not be the case.  
In the efforts to track more manufactures though it does look like it may be another era of engine dependance so it may be down to who nails the new engines. Mercedes have indicated they are quietly confident along with Ferrari. Red Bull do not seem to be so with all the complaints they have around it.

2026 should also bring 2 more cars on the track with a new team and it will be interesting to see how that all pans out.  
It does mean 2 more drivers on the track and with it being a very US focused team I am sure at least 1 of these would be an American driver. Who would that be, who has the super license to be able to drive?","['One season is not predictive of the next one.
