Historically, obviously he'd be high. But I have no idea how to rate him right now and how much of an impact age/motivation are having on his performance right now. Is he as good as before? Probably not. Lewis isn't, I doubt Alonso is either, as much as they'll claim they feel better than ever, age catches up to everyone, even them. They just have more performance to lose than most others, so it takes longer. But nobody reasonable can claim either of them are in their prime anymore."", ""Norris is a liability at Mclaren. Hamilton is a liability at Ferrari. Tsunoda is a liability at Red Bull.  Antonelli is just too young and inexperienced to have higher expectations.

WCC would have been over already, lmao."", 'Let‚Äôs not forget the gap Sainz has in the beginning of 2022 when the car suited Leclerc‚Äôs style. He was slow, and loved gravel.

He does have more experience with the Ferrari engine so the issue with not knowing what setup to trigger would be less though.']",81,66,0.88,81,60,60,23,4,0.030000000000000027,23

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

STEP FOUR:

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".
