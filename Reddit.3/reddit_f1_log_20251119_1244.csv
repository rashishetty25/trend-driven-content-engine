The level of English doesn't seem too complicated, and the mini-essay text pieces aren't that long, and accompanied by plenty of easy picture captions.\n\nThey're written by former F1 journalists including Maurice Hamilton (previously a motor racing correspondent for The Observer newspaper, and now a BBC Radio 5 commentator, according to his bioblurb), Tony Dodgins (previously with Autosport, now an occasional BBC TV commentator), and Frank Hopkinson (former deputy editor of F1 Racing magazine), and come with introductions by figures like Sir Jackie Stewart, Damon Hill, Mark Webber, etc., and include anecdotes as well as facts.

Like you can usually view really good overtakes and turns only from replays in the broadcast, but I think watching how a single racer performs in a proper uninterrupted lap can really compare them to other racers. Or see how they try to continuously attack or defend against an opponent. I saw Max's POV of Brazil '25 and that was very interesting, in terms of his pits and overtakes.","['Stroll Brasil 24, especially during the formation lap you can see him take an interesting line', 'Sergio in Shakir 2020', 'Probably Hamilton Brazil 2021', ""Perhaps Brazil 2021 - that's back when qualifying set the sprint grid, and the sprint finish set the grand prix grid. Well, there were freight delays, and Hamilton's car failed scrutineering at the end of qualifying so he had to start from the back. He took a new engine (triggering a five-place grand prix grid drop), went from 20th to 5th in the sprint, and went from 10th to 1st in the grand prix.\n\nMaybe Spain 2021 (which copied the strategy from Hungary a few years prior) where Hamilton had a tire advantage but the team still had him do a surprise two-stop strategy and made up massive time to pass Max several laps earlier than anyone predicted.\n\n1996 Monaco was hilarious to watch as only three cars finished and the lead changed multiple times in the last lap."", 'Sebastian Vettel - Brazil 2012.
