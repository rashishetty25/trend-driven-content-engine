1i5gljq,Why are certain drivers better at race pace and other better over one lap?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i5gljq/why_are_certain_drivers_better_at_race_pace_and/,2025-01-20, Discussion,"So I've always seen that almost every generation has a driver that's considered the best over one lap, and another that's considered the best over a race distance or most complete on race day. 

I am only picking two drivers per decade for the sake of simplicity, I know there are more.
70s 
One Lap: Hunt
Race Distance: Lauda
80s: 
One Lap: Senna
Race Distance: Prost
90s:
One Lap: Hakkinen
Race Distance: Schumacher
2000s and 2010s: 
One Lap: Hamilton
Race Distance: Alonso
2020s:
One Lap: Leclerc
Race Distance: Verstappen

My question is, does a certain driving style reward one lap pace at the cost of a race distance? Why was Prost for example consistently worse than Senna in qualifying but over a season would usually be considered better on race day. Same goes for Alonso, as good as he is in qualifying, it's his race pace that made him almost unstoppable on a Sunday. 

For the current generation I would suppose it's commonly considered that Leclerc is one of the best over one lap but Verstappen would be slightly better on race day. What makes a race distance any different than qualifying and wouldn't the fastest qualifier also be the best during a race, as end of the day, it's still a display of who has more pace, and in theory they will finish ahead more often.

And additionally, why are some select drivers so much better at qualifying than anything else. E.g Trulli?

What is the core difference between a race distance and a qualifying from a driving perspective and why do some drivers performance vary drastically between the two formats?
","[""Consistency, wheel to wheel skills and tyre management. That's it."", 'Don‚Äôt really need to manage tires during qualifying, can just go balls to the wall.\n\nThe problem is, even ignoring the tires, it‚Äôs impossible to run 40+ laps on the knife‚Äôs edge without blowing it. Better to have a guy who can consistently turn in 90-95% of the perfect lap time all day than the dude who can go perfect lap, perfect lap, lost 30 seconds in the gravel trap, perfect lap‚Ä¶', 'Your qualifying laps are generally going to be on softer compounds, low fuel, blast it for one lap. Maybe different compounds track to track but they will be fresh. Fairly consistent.\n\nRace pace you are managing wearing tires, fuel going down, maybe temps of different parts of the car, different temps on track, dirty air. Everything changes a little every lap. And you need to anticipate/feel it and go as fast as possible (without eating tires).\n\nIf you think about wet races we consider those to determine the best drivers because they are thrown into unexpected conditions. We can also think about how teams evaluate drivers. A guy who busts out a 1:10:00 somewhere after 5 laps in the car looks better than a guy doing 1:09:58 after 1000 laps.\n\nA great driver is obviously a fast driver, but how are they fast? They quickly absorb sensory input and data and use it to drive as close to the limit as possible. The quicker you can absorb and act, the better. A quali lap has less moving parts essentially.', ""Was Lewis known for one lap pace? I feel like when I've been watching him he's been more known for race pace than one lap pace."", ""It's a complicated thing. \n\nA qualifying setup can make the car more on a knife edge, which makes it slightly harder to control consistently over a race distance, but may make the car quicker over a single lap.\n\nAlso, a setup or even the the driver's own driving style can take more out of the tyres over a single lap, but may not be the optimal strategy during a race because the tyre performance may drop off over time with that setup or driving style.\n\nIn older generations when reliability was much more of an issue, some drivers may be more conservative over a race to not stress the car as much as other drivers.\n\nPlus, in previous regulations, there were more than one tyre supplier, so differences in the tyres construction and compound would be different between teams in the same era.\n\nSo, for a driver like Jarno Trulli, who was considered a qualifying specialist. His setup or natural driving style may have been more suited to extracting more of a lap time over a single lap, but unable to maintain that pace over a race because of tyre, setup differences or even the sheer level of concentration it takes to pull out a qualifying lap, which is hard to maintain over a race distance.\n\nNot sure if any of this helps, and if people think I'm talking out of my arse, just delete this comment or whatever lol."", 'For Leclerc vs Verstappen, it was the car whose tires could barely last a lap. When Ferrari started making cars that can perform over an entire race, Leclerc had much better results in the race than in qualifying.', ""Qualifying is often about putting exactly the right amount of energy in the tires over a lap and having them at right temp at beginning, and absolutely nailing every braking zone and turn in point.  Race pace is about putting as little energy into the tires and brakes as possible and still being fast while driving nowhere near the limit. It's understanding where both lap time and tire wear/temp/slip comes from and using it where it matters most"", 'They are 2 different things. Certain cars are also better at qualifying than a full race.', ""In very oversimplified terms (this is all opinion). And it is easy to over exaggerate - all the top F1 drivers have both excellent lap time and race management. The differences are very small.\n\nOne lap relies a lot on feel and a lot of courage. The driver is willing to push the car just a little bit harder, a little bit faster into corners and have the confidence to control that car. \n\nRace has a bit more about vehicle management. Managing fuel, temperatures, brakes/tires. Having the mental discipline to be patient and take fewer risks when the occasion doesn't demand it. Reading the condition of the opponent and taking advantage of their mistakes. \n\nThis balance of aggression and patience is what makes the truly great drivers.""]",141,78,0.85,141,75,75,5,4,0.010000000000000009,5

That excuse wore off last year, it was fine to make errors and be a bit off overall, he was new. But by the mid season, let alone nearing mid season of his second season he should know what he was doing yet he got worse and worse.\n\nThen Colapinto comes in, not exactly the highest rated junior driver (he was considered good bit probably not making it to F1) and yeah, he made errors too but he was far quicker than Sargeant, despite having far less experience both in F1, Testing, *and* having done half an F2 season.
