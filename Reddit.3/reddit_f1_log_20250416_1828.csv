1k0ds0q,How F-ducts worked - and an aero detail not discussed previously,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k0ds0q/how_fducts_worked_and_an_aero_detail_not/,2025-04-16, Technical,"As has been well covered in the past - the F-duct system was introduced in 2010 by McLaren (and later adopted in varying forms by other teams). It was a clever way of achieving drag reduction without movable aerodynamic devices - skirting the regulations by using driver input to trigger a ""fluidic"" switch hidden away inside the engine cover.

I thought I'd write up a post explaining how this system worked aerodynamically, having seen it's development, testing, and eventual deployment firsthand.

**Fluidics: a quick background**

Fluidics is a whole discipline of its own, similar to the fields of mechanics and electronics. Fluidic systems use the properties of fluids (i.e. liquids and gases) to create logical systems free from electronic or mechanical influence. Within the fluidic world we have devices like logic gates, amplifiers, oscillators, etc - the same things you'd find in the mechanical and electronic counterpart worlds. You can therefore build different systems and solve for many different use cases using these fluidic devices. Great little intro paper [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19730002533/downloads/19730002533.pdf) from NASA talks about many different use cases that fluidics have seen in the world of aerospace.

Now that we know that fluidics are essentially the aero counterpart to mechanical and/or electrical systems, it's easy to then connect the dots and see what sort of clever loopholes a fluidic system could open up in a set of rules and regulations that were written with mechanical and/or electrical devices in mind. It is also worth noting that it was exactly this sort of ""what is the X analogue of Y"" logic that led to the inerter (""J-damper""), another famous F1 innovation which is the mechanical equivalent of an electronic capacitor. No surprise to note that it was also McLaren that brought this innovation to F1 first, shortly after it's invention.

**Coming back to F-Ducts**

If moveable aero regulations banned *mechanical* switches to change the aero behaviour of the car, they didn't (initially) ban *aerodynamic* switches. And the lowest hanging fruit seem to be in shedding drag in straight line conditions - something where an on/off switch would be a perfect use case for fluidics.

At its core, the F-duct worked by stalling the rear wing - similar in outcome to the DRS. However, the F-Duct did this purely aerodynamically (no rotating flaps) by injecting ducted flow perpendicular to the normal airflow on the rear wing flap (and later at the mainplane, to have a larger stall effect) to trigger separation of the boundary layer, creating a stall and dump downforce and therefore the induced drag that comes with it.

**Basic function**

The system used internal ducting to channel air from an inlet (usually at the nose or via a slot at the top of the airbox) to the rear wing. When the system was activated - typically by the driver blocking or unblocking a duct with their hand or leg - the airflow would be directed to a slot in the rear wing's surface, triggering the stall.

Most F-duct systems had two possible outlet paths:

1. A default, low-energy path that always exited the ducted flow harmlessly out of what RBR called the ""donkey d\*ck"" - a long horizontal outlet at the back of the engine cover.
2. A stall path that redirected flow up through the rear wing and out the slot perpendicular to the rear wing surface when the duct was activated

https://preview.redd.it/5dmiy3gq45ve1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=398d21a33d2676999f8aab72551978aae3446610

**The need for a reliable switch**

Early testing showed that the system did not initially have a fully binary switching behaviour: even when a majority of the flow was going into the default outlet, some flow would end up in the stall outlet, negatively impacting rear wing performance when the wing should be operating at 'normal' load (e.g. in cornering). Similarly, switching the system on and off and back on again showed signs of aerodynamic hysteresis - a phenomenon that basically means that a sort of aerodynamic lag. If blocking the driver control duct caused a rear wing stall, simply unblocking the duct wouldn't be enough to cause the rear wing to recover. Not good.

**The vortex trap**

The solution to this, aside from a lot of fine-tuning, was the introduction of a small but crucial aerodynamic feature that was added to the switch, and was intentionally hidden via a vanity panel - though I'm sure others figured this out quickly too since this detail is present in a lot of fluidic research literature. This feature was the semi-circular vortex trap at the junction of the two outlet paths. Here sat a trapped vortex that would help stabilise the flow going to the default outlet when the stall switch was deactivated. It would reverse it's rotation when the stall switch was activated, thereby helping stabilise flow going to the stall path.

What this did was quite elegant:

* When the system wasn’t activated, the donkey d\*ck was the low-resistance path, and the vortex acted as a sort of buffer that prevented any significant bleed to the stall slot, keeping it aerodynamically “quiet"". The counter-clockwise rotation of the vortex encouraged all flow from the inlet duct to head down the non-stall pathway.

https://preview.redd.it/b8s7e46t45ve1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5115a0bfc409d03669048b05c3e60a7f1e2dfe6

* When the control duct was activated by the driver, there was upwards flow at the switch that caused the vortex to reverse its rotation, encouraging all the flow to head to the stall duct. The vortex would now stabilise this new flow path, again insulating it from the now dormant donkey d\*ck path.

https://preview.redd.it/qnl4uvtt45ve1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcdb094f9032f9d4aeab758689526e8206887819

This meant the system behaved like a bistable switch - very stable in both modes (stall on or stall off). There was very little dynamic pressure or cross-talk in the non-active duct, which was key for predictable and stable rear wing stall/unstall transitions.

It was a small detail - but a good example of how in F1, even a small change in duct geometry can make or break the whole system.","[""Wow, I didn't know how much I didn't know about F-ducts.\xa0 Thanks for this detailed and fascinating post!"", 'I love the way it got it\'s name.

In Japan, he qualified P14 against Hadjar’s P7, and in the race finished 50 seconds behind Hadjar, P8 vs P17. This weekend, he qualified 0.5 seconds behind Hadjar and caused two crashes.

So who do you think will be on top of the field in 2026 and why?

My money would be on Aston if Honda hadn't lost so many staff due to the brief f1 exit, due to the engine strength and Newey for aero etc. But they did.

Merc probably the safest bet now.

Alpine have showed they can build a fast car, but they have a very slow engine. Next year they're a Merc customer, dark horse maybe?

Edit. I totally forgot about Audi, I could see them absolutely nailing the engine and the fuel, big question marks about the rest of it though.","['Ferrari, because next year is our year and I know it!', ""I'm going to make a bold prediction and say that one of eleven teams will build a car that goes on to win the championship.

Andy Cowell being the team principal/group CEO I think will have a greater impact than the signing of Newey, not to dimi He played a massive part in the Mercedes V6 dominance from 2014 onwards and will no doubt be in collaboration with Honda in regards to the engine. The increased power of the battery component will be a fascinating watch too, especially with Honda having come along way from what happened in 2015.\n\nSomething that also is quietly going under the radar is the fact that Aston Martin will be able to build around the engine as to how they want. They've been restricted in regards to what they can do around the Mercedes engine they have currently. \n\nSo, from 2026 onwards they will have way more flexibility in how they want the car built. That alone for me is huge. \n\nMercedes you'd think are a good shot at nailing though."", 'Next Year is our year obviously', 'These are the toughest regulations to guess at ever. You have a new PU and new aero regulations, both being developed under strict financial and testing restrictions for the first time ever.\n\nOn the PU side, it would be very surprising if Mercedes, Ferrari and Honda aren\'t the initial leaders in that regard, but don\'t expect a massive advantage like last time. Mercedes threw far more money and time at developing the 2014 hybrid than anybody else and reapedd the rewards. Experience will count for a lot, but it won\'t be OP like last time.\n\nOn the aero side, there\'s likely seven teams that could produce the best team out of the gate. They have the facilities, funds, systems, headcount and personnel capable of ""winning"" the rule change. Smart money would be on Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull or Mclaren, but Alpine, Aston Martin and Williams have everything they need as well.\n\nI hope we end up with different winners on the aero and PU sides, would make it really interesting if say Merc has the best PU, but Ferrari and Aston have built a better car, would provide the most variety from race to race.', ""Whichever one of Mercedes or McLaren builds the better car around the Mercedes PU...for which Merc is the works team and McLaren has an agreement that gives them the access to the PU that a works team would have while designing their car.\n\nI trust Rob Marshall/McLaren's aero team a bit more so slight edge McLaren, but you never know when regulations change this drastically.""]",0,111,0.22,0,499,499,0,0,-0.01999999999999999,0
