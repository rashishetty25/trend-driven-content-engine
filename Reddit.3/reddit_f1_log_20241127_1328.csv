1h0kk2y,Simple analysis - How much does Max owe 2024 WDC to RBR Dominant Start?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0kk2y/simple_analysis_how_much_does_max_owe_2024_wdc_to/,2024-11-26, Statistics,"There's been lots of statements flying around such as ""Max won WDC24 without the fastest car"".

With recency bias it feels that way, however its eye opening to look back at the beginning of the season and how dominant the RedBull was (first 7 races). So much so that we had Perez finishing 2nd / Podium. This level of dominance had no close challengers over this period. Effectively free points for RedBull + Max.

With this in mind I wondered what the championship table would look like based on two different scenarios:

1. If Mercedes were the ones to have a 7-race dominant car at the beginning of the season - For this I swapped the RedBull drivers finishing positions with the RedBull drivers for the first 7 races as follows; where Lewis finished ahead of George I would put him as the first Redbull and George as the second RedBull, and vice versa. However when populating the Mercedes cars I always put Max as the higher finisher.
2. Same as point 1 but for Ferrari.

The output:

**Scenario 1**

||
||
|Lando Norris|340|
|Charles Leclerc|319|
|Lewis Hamilton|304|
|Max Verstappen|302|
|George Russell|280|
|Oscar Piastri|268|
|Carlos Sainz|259|

**Scenario 2**

||
||
|Charles Leclerc|365|
|Max Verstappen|359|
|Lando Norris|340|
|Oscar Piastri|268|
|Carlos Sainz|267|
|George Russell|217|
|Lewis Hamilton|208|

There's no point in doing a McLaren swap for the first 7 races because this would clearly just result in a Lando P1 by a decent stretch.

So all scenarios point to the fact that - while Max didn't have the fastest car **all** season - He ultimately does owe his WDC24 to having a vastly dominant car earlier in the season.

Put another way, Max essentially had a 50pt (to Charles) and 60pt (to Norris) starting advantage heading into a 17 race season. You take that away and give the corresponding advantage to each of those drivers and they both take the WDC win.","[""Or just start counting championship from Monaco (8th race) and you can see the results, instead of your weird calculating, so since Monaco:  \n- Verstappen got 242 points.  \n- Lando got 239 points.  \n- Leclerc got 206 points.   \nSo I wouldn't call it just the car.
