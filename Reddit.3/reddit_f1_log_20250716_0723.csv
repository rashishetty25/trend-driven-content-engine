1m0da20,pronouncing rawe ceek?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m0da20/pronouncing_rawe_ceek/,2025-07-15, Discussion,"I looked at my calendar this morning and thought ""still not a rawe ceek"". Then I started wondering how other people pronounce it.

How do **you** pronounce rawe ceek? Is ""rawe""

* raw (silent e)
* RAH-we / rah-WE (long e)
* RAH-way / rah-WAY (italian e)
* RAW-eh (thanks u/WussssPoppinJimbo )
* RAW-uh (thanks u/AintNoUniqueUsername )
* rave (thanks u/Witchdemigoddess )
* reyw (thanks u/ln4thegreat and u/abraxasnl )
* RAY-weh (thanks u/achterkant )

Is ""ceek""

* seek (soft c)
* keek (hard c)
* cheek (italian ce)
* creek (thanks u/TheKennyAlmighty )
* chick (thanks u/PaddyTheMedic )
* sheek (thanks u/uucchhiihhaa )

As a native English speaker I've always only said ""raw seek"" but now that I think about it ""RAH-way cheek"" sounds more authentic.

And I am inclined to believe that timeline.\n\nedit: after checking with the original [source ](https://archive.is/y2gKs)(Bild in german), they did not mean the Tuesday before the British gp, they meant the Tuesday after. So they fucked up the copy paste.\n\n>It was reported that Horner’s previously stellar relationship with Yoovidhya had soured after Horner had shown a lack of interest in overseeing additional areas of the organisation, including its marketing and technical operations departments, as well as its powertrains department.\n\nNot sure exactly how to read that, if anything, Horners' interest in concentrating power on himself may have been a factor. But maybe that is what they mean.\n\nEdit: similar here, original source says Yoovidhya had to pressure Horner into conceding at least some of the power, not that Horner showed a lack of interest in overseeing these things."", 'zero details revealed', 'Well I want my five minutes back.
