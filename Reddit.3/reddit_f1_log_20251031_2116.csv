I got into F1 this year, courtesy of my friend, who has been a fan for longer. I got in right after Imola, so I didn't get to watch it (not yet anyway), but she caught me up on the basics. Monaco was the first race I'd ever watched, and my friend sincerely apologized (lol) because she said that the race wasn't a great introduction at all. Looking back after a few months of getting to know the sport more, I do agree that she was right. I've been watching every race since then, and I honestly think all the races so far have been entertaining. But yeah, other than a few clips from races from earlier in the year and past years, I haven't watched any full races from before Monaco 2025.

This now brings me to my question: Could you maybe suggest races (starting from 2015 preferably, I've grown to like Max and want to start from there haha) that are actually worth watching in full and/or maybe have significance of some sort? Like staple races that you just *have* to see unfold. I'm still open to races before 2015 though, especially if it's very monumental for F1.

I’m going back through the Archives on f1tv and I’ve noticed they have old quali sessions and obviously sometimes they’re better than the actual race. I was just wondering if anyone can point me in the direction of some quali sessions worth watching. Off the top of my head I can think of spa 2021 as a decent one and Russia from same year but if anyone could help me with others that’ll be ideal.
