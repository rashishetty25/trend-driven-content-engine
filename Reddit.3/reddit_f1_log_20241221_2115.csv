I’m not sure how you measure that.', 'Rain', 'safety cars for sure. also number of accidents/pileups in the opening corner/lap\n\npunctures/engine failures/bad pitstops', 'as FOM are now noticing, ""excitement"" isn\'t something that can be just measured with quantifiable factors.

Nowadays Teams can calculate very precisely how fast the car will Go and so on, but it gets chaotic when unexpected Events Happen.

Max driving 45 seconds off into the distance is of course an absolute driving clinic but it does not make for exciting races.\n\nGood battles over 5th are fine imo, but really the win needs to be contested, whether that's on track or through strategy calls"", ""when a driver who's usually in q3 is out in q1 and has a chance to show their overtaking skills"", 'Last minute strategy', 'Another variable I\'d add is some way of measuring the ""upset"". I.e if different people win, it\'s automatically more interesting.\n\nAlso an easy one to statistically generate I\'d assume, is one I\'d recommend adding: total time the difference on track between 1st and 2nd is under 2s.\n\nId also add something like ""is 1st currently not the fastest on track"", as that ""hunt"" from someone behind is often exciting.\n\nAlso, I did a project very similar to this (just a different sport and obiective) back when I was at uni, so if you want any help feel free to DM me. Was a lot of fun tbh, but the major issue I can see you have is that you don\'t have ""true values"" for how interesting the races objectively were, so build models around.
