1k5gu1b,Is Oscar Piastri's decision to snub Alpine for McLaren in 2022 one of the smartest career moves in F1 history?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k5gu1b/is_oscar_piastris_decision_to_snub_alpine_for/,2025-04-22, Discussion,"Aside from the obvious example of Hamilton’s gamble to join Mercedes, are there many career decisions in F1 that have worked out better than Piastri’s choice to ditch Alpine for McLaren?

Back in early July 2022, while still an Alpine reserve driver, it was already speculated that Piastri had signed a deal with McLaren — even though at the time, McLaren were behind Alpine in terms of car performance.

When Alonso made his shock move to Aston Martin, many expected Piastri to step up and partner Ocon at Alpine. Instead, he stuck with his McLaren move — a decision that completely altered his career path for the better. Rather than scrapping for the odd points finish at Alpine, Piastri now finds himself a championship contender in just his third F1 season.

For some perspective:

Points since Piastri joined F1:

Oscar Piastri — 488

Alpine F1 Team — 190

And just for fun: if Piastri had gone to Alpine as originally planned, who do you reckon would be Lando Norris’s teammate right now? I’d guess Gasly.","['Certainly, although Hamilton joining Mercedes in a shock move is probably better.', ""Piastri obviously made the right call but he definitely didn't snub Alpine. It seems Alpine's propaganda is hard to fight.\n\nHe never had a seat at Alpine. By the time they came calling, he was already committed to McLaren.\n\nAlpine ran a smear campaign and Piastri couldn't fight back because his deal with McLaren wasn't public yet, but Alpine certainly knew about it."", 'Lewis to Mercedes netted him 6 WDC. \n\nSchumacher to Ferrari netted him 5 WDC. \n\nNeither team on top when they moved. \n\nKimi to Lotus on a £50k per point contract is worth a mention too, if for different reasons.', 'I think the only better move I can think of to date was Hamilton to Mercedes in 2013, possibly Schumacher to Ferrari in 1996 but that took a few years to show championship level results', ""Also, Mark Webber's biggest achievement in F1."", ""Not really, it was a common sense move because at the time the deal was made it was a guaranteed seat vs a potential seat at one of either Alpine or Williams.\n\nIt's similar to the Verstappen situation where he was being courted by everyone, but only Red Bull had an F1 drive to give him immediately.

I still dont understand the ruling\n\nI do understand the argument that Piastri was alongside on the inside by the apex and deserved the entirety of the corner, so Max gained a lasting advantage by going off track. I guess it makes sense and is consistent as a rule, but I dont think it's fair.\n\nImagine you're actually Max Verstappen, you brake into the corner alongside another car, you try to turn left but there's a car in the way so you can't turn left, you have to keep going straight. So you try and try to turn left but the other car keeps blocking you, and a few moments later you've reached the end of the corner and now you're offtrack. Could you have braked extra hard, so instead of staying alongside and getting run offtrack you stay ontrack by letting the other car overtake you? No. Because you're already stepping on your brakes on the maximal limit, you can't brake more than the maximum. Even if you could, by braking so much you're exposing yourself to P3.\n\nIn this sense, there was nothing Max could've done to avoid the penalty. Maybe he could've gone for a switchback? but that corner isnt good for switchbacks and he'll definitely lose P1 anyway. If it was not possible for someone to take action to avoid something, then i don't think it's that someone's fault and that someone shouldn't deserve a penalty. I think that Piastri shouldn't have understeered and should instead leave a space on the outside.\n\nCan anyone explain why Max did deserve the penalty?"", ""I'm not opposed to a ban on swearing in the media.

JV has gone out of his way to hype Carlos, encourage him thru transition and deservedly so but many making fun of it as if scrubbing Alex from website. Has gotten a lot better lately but noticed Carlos is getting most praise for single handedly providing double points. Then he pulls away during last lap for what he even calls “cheeky” lap. Alex radio stated “what is he…” like holding tongue and then he walked by Carlos’ car in parc ferma. His take on race vs Carlos’ left some fans with impression Carlos was the only one doing heavy lifting. Seems on any post specifically about Albon, albeit they aren’t numerous, the passionate Carlos fans come out. Just wonder if there’s tension to come. Realize there’s a newer fan base overall in F1, may not have the historical or driving knowledge and simply now fanatics for a particular driver. But see an issue for long term fans that remember Alex single handedly providing points, being loyal when had other suitors, and getting defensive as not equally appreciated by Carlos’ enormous and passionate fan base. Can see coming tension especially as truly believe we have a superior driver duo but cautious when remembering Carlos’ Silverstone, Vegas, and Spanish questionable team player clashes with Charles. Think Albons personality will be overly submissive. Hope JV remembers who helped to get them here and keeps in check. ","['They have a common goal in bringing Williams back to the front. I don’t think they’ll be that much tension', 'Hmm interesting question and well put together post.\xa0\n\nI think that Albon is closer to Sainz than Williams expected (as in he’s beating him). \xa0It is quite similar to Ricciardo and Norris as McLaren. Norris was immediately faster than Ricciardo and had a great start to the year in 2021. But over the season Ricciardo did come back and was even the better driver in a lot of races toward seasons end. Then there was a reg change in 2022 and Ricciardo’s form spiralled ginormously. Could the 2026 regs prove similar for Carlos?\xa0\n\nThere has been some worrying language coming from Sainz that he doesn’t know where he’s losing time, which is one of the most worrying that things to hear from an F1 driver. However he has been faster than Albon in the last two rounds.\xa0\n\nAnd there is also the question of what if Williams build a great car next year? It’s not out of the question and Vowles has been targeting 2026 ever since he took over in 2023. They have already shifted their development to it. If podiums and even wins are on the cards that relationship could become a lot less harmonious.\xa0\n\nHowever Vowles did make the mistake of hyping Carlos up too much. He’s a great driver but the way Vowles was talking youd think he’d signed Leclerc, not Sainz.\xa0\n\nBut in the end I think that the drivers themselves will not fall out. Why? Because they seem like the two most level headed guys on the grid. They both seem very intelligent and calm. Two chill guys that are experienced enough to know life is what it is and they’re lucky to be in the position they’re in.', 'Will there be tension between fanbases? Yes. Will it be necessary or earned? Doubtful.\n\nBetween drivers? Not unless their perspectives shift out of the blue.

He also always says he doesn't understand where he's losing time, and then he goes into the data and figures it out. Common pattern with him, dating back to at least his Ferrari days. \n\nI do agree that I don't think there will be a falling out, they're too focused on the team's success.

Another weapon in Senna's armory was his utter ruthlessness.

""Senna's having a load, and Senna's hiding into the pit wall. Schumacher trying to take it and Senna. Now let's see if the Brazilian moved across. Indeed, he did."" (Murray Walker commentating on a battle between Ayrton and Michael)

""He often used to put us in a position where you were gonna have an accident, and he would leave it up to you to decide whether to have that accident or not."" (MB)

Martin experienced this psychological warfare, first of all, when racing against Senna in F3.  
""Well, look, I've got a great big lead here, and he launches in from nowhere and then parks his role on my shoulder. I couldn't get out of the car until they lifted his car off the top of mine."" (MB)

""So when he wants to overtake, he'd he'd go on the inside and put the car in a place. If you try to take the corner, you're going to hit him."" (JC)

""Yes. He would put you in a compromising position and then leave you to make the decision. And if you didn't run into him, then psychologically you were buried and finished.  
He would then know that every time after that he showed you a wheel, you jumped out of the way."" (MB)

Is it just me, or did Max update this approach to modern times?","[""Absolutely! Max knows exactly what he is doing and where the limits of the rules are. So he keeps going there because he can. And by driving as aggressive as he does, others know what to expect and can ask themselves if it's worth the risk."", ""Yes, and I think Schumacher also had a similar approach as well. \n\nI rewatched that segment recently (I'd highly recommend it, one of the best things Top Gear made imo) and was definitely reminded of Max in that moment"", 'This is peak Formula 1 racing for me.\n\nIt needs to retain that jousting match factor in on track battles, where a driver can scare a competitor into submission.', ""I always enjoy watching this episode and I actually asked myself the same question.

1k58k12,Used to be a Ferrari fan - now just a Verstappen fan. How did y’all fan journeys develop?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k58k12/used_to_be_a_ferrari_fan_now_just_a_verstappen/,2025-04-22, Discussion,"I was a Ferrari fan pre-Michael Schumacher and of course loved his winning years with the team. But over the last ten years or so I found out more and more - through people like Chris Harris - about how Ferrari acts toward customers (and “aspiring” customers) of their road cars and I fell out of love with the brand and because of that, the racing team. 

Nowadays I watch Verstappen in awe of his obvious talent and the fact that he just lives for racing - even excelling at sim-racing which he does in his down-time. And I follow the sport to see the rise of talent like Antonelli and, as a New Zealander, to see if Lawson can rise to a great career.

But I don’t really follow manufacturers as a fan any longer.

Interested to know if people here always followed one team and whoever drives for them - or just drivers - or whatever combination?

**edit:** Plus, I’m following Newey a bit especially to see if he can bring the Midas touch to another team - and to see if Verstappen will drive his designs again.","['Alonso\n\n.......still Alonso with a developed immunity to disappointment', 'Galaxy brain is to be an F1 fan.\n\n  \nUniverse brain was to be a fan of rain (until Spa 2021)', 'I just hope for strong fair racing and im always rooting for the underdogs.', ""Started as a Schumacher fan, then followed over to Kimi.
