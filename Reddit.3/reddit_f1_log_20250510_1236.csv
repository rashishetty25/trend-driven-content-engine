1kj5t2q,McLaren's Brake (phase changing) Context,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kj5t2q/mclarens_brake_phase_changing_context/,2025-05-10, Discussion,"The videos on phase changing materials are complex and I see many people disregarding it because it seems far-fetched as the discussion has an air of ""ground breaking technology"" which attracts valid scepticism. But there is a more ""simple"" side to it which relates to Red Bull's rumoured ""water in the tyres"" claim. It might not be as unlikely as you think. 

Whether they are using a solid or not in F1, phase changing cooling has been a staple in mobile/small devices for decades as it is basically the only way to efficiently cool such a small device without a pump. If youre using a phone or laptop right now, you are using a phase changing coolant system. Heat pipes or vapor chambers in your device transition water into gas, then back into water when the temp drops. If you've ever had a hot laptop on your lap, its fighting for life to keep the temperature below 100 degrees by constantly changing state. Similar to how an engine circulates coolant to a radiator, except this is pumped so there is no need to rely on a state change to circulate the coolant. 

If a team suspects brakes have heat pipes to regulate brake and tyre temp, a state change and liquid is involved for circulation, hence the water rumour. The high temperatures involved mean they could be using a solid to liquid change as the videos discuss, or it could be a high temp liquid.

The point is that while it is an innovative motorsport idea, its not a scientific breakthrough. Which imo makes it more believable.","['Liquid cooling is strictly prehibited in any form for the brakes though, and the FIA wouldn’t have cleared it if that was the case.\n\nSSPCMs (shape stabilized phase changing materials), are a more likely candidate, but they are not as effective for this use case.\n\nThere’s also a lot of regulatory constrains in the form of legality boxes around the drums, which make the implementation really difficult.\n\nIt’s s cool idea definitely, and could end up being what they’re doing, but its far from being conclusively proven.', 'This post has a no yapping by just the glamour part of f1 fans. Feels like a breath of fresh air seeing people actually talk about tech and not just the drivers.', 'A ton of people are misunderstanding what phase change materials are \n\nThey’re not anything like moveable materials based off its heat, they’re as their name says, materials that absorb or expel heat using the properties of a phase change\n\nFor example, boiling water cannot exceed 100c at ambient pressures, meaning if you keep adding heat it will stay at a 100 until it all boils off completely', ""It's a good theory, but I'm apprehensive about it. You generally want to minimise unsprung mass. How much of this material would you actually need?

When the pad is cold the foil closes the ducts and heat is retained. \n\nWhen heat builds up the foils warp and open the cooling ducts.\n\nIMHO these should be considered illegal moving surfaces, but I see how this could be validated just as they approved bending wings with some limitations.', ""The materials will only absorb so much heat before it essentially become deadweight. If your car is underweight then sure you can use a lot of it, but still theres a limit to the heat sink capacity. I imagine those F1 brakes are putting out enormous about of energy. Shouldn't be that hard to calculate, but somebody else do it pls."", 'All these innovations really impress me.', 'There was an engineer on here that said its more likely that they use memory metals (Shape Memory Alloys) in their brakes. \n\nAfter researching it, it seems more likely the case since its already used in other car applications and there is research being done on potential applications in car brakes.', 'Pretty sure no one is saying that they are running water and return likes to each corner.\n\nI thought the theory was they were adding a small amount to the wheel or tyre?']",272,66,0.92,272,61,61,125,23,0.040000000000000036,125

When would you say could be a good point in time for this?

If you could change the outcome of a WDC, which one(s) would you change?

For background - F1 fan since the 90s, never really been a fan of one driver or team. I'm British so there's always a bit of bias there, but not always - I was gunning for Hakkinen over Coulthard in the late 90s for example. But I mention this to say the purpose should try to stay away from ""I like this driver and cannot have my view changed, and I treat F1 like I'm a football fan""

  
So -

2008 - Massa instead of Hamilton. 

Massa drove brilliantly all season, as did Lewis. Again, as a Brit I was somewhat gunning for Lewis, but in hindsight Massa would have made for a better story. If it wasn't for that pit-stop disaster in Singapore he'd have won it anyway. Hamilton only just won by sheer luck of Glock not having pitted. Massa won the race in style in front of his home crowd, and had the championship snatched away at the last second. Even Lewis has since said he didn't feel mature or ready enough for his first title and he felt like he'd gone too far too soon. Massa had that dreadful accident the following year in Hungary and was never the same again. Lewis would still have six titles, Massa could have retired with a championship to his name.

1986 - Mansell instead of Prost.

Mansell's one and only F1 championship seemed way too easy for him. That 1992 Williams was basically unbeatable. Still the most ""advanced"" car in F1 history. Even Patrese was consistently putting it home in second or third place, and even won in Japan. Mansell walked the entire season to win in an almost fittingly boring and dull style. But he fought like a madman through his entire motorsport career, his determination and hardship was unbelievable at times. I felt he was so cruelly robbed in 1986 when his tyre blew. Prost won other championships, I'm sure he'd have called it fair and deserved if Mansell hadn't retired from the race and took the title. 

1982 - Pironi instead of Rosberg

1982 was a pretty awful season all in, full of tragedy, some bizarre races, and political fallout. Rosberg managed to crawl into winning the championship despite winning just one race, retiring from three, and never really looking that exciting or championship-worthy. Pironi could easily have won had he not had such a terrible accident at Hockenheim. He still managed to finish second in the championship despite missing the last five races of a 16 round season, and not racing in Belgium because Gilles died in practice. Keke is a cool guy, and nothing against him personally, but he was never really championship material and lucked into that one in awful circumstances I'm sure he'd change if he could.

1956 - Moss instead of Fangio

Reaching a little bit as Juan-Manuel was such a fine driver who dominated his era, a record five titles that wouldn't be matched until 2002. Moss however is often described as ""the greatest driver never to win a championship"" and 1956 was his closest shot. A couple of very cruel retirements due to mechanical failure, including one at his home race at Silverstone where him and Fangio did identical qualifying times (only down to a tenth in those days, but Moss got the pole), he was just a couple of points behind Fangio at the end of the season.

Nor was Glock the only reason Hamilton won the 2008 title.\n\nTo answer your question though, I would change 1981, though who I would want to win is a complex one.
