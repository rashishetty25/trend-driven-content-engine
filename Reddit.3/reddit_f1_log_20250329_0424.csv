Williams car was superior in every way to Senna's McLaren and Williams  locked out the front row in a year they dominated with one of F1's greatest car. Prost and Hill were 1.5 seconds clear in qualifying.  

This race saw a number of incidents. A giant airborne crash involving Mario Andretti took out four at the start.

Senna was given a stop-go penalty for lapping a backmarker under yellow flags. 

Then there was a heavy rain shower and leader Prost spun at turn 1 and hit Fittipaldi's stationary car and both were out of the race. 

Hill took over the lead from Senna who had recovered after his penalty and benefited from Schumachers car talkimg off the jack during his pit stop. 

On lap 42 Senna passed Hill for the lead and built up a 16 second gap and won his home race for the second and final time. 

After the race the Brazilian fans invaded the track in celebration of Senna's victory. 

Fangio celebrated with Senna on the podium, the last time they were seen together in public. Even Pelé joined in the celebrations after. 

Overall 16 World Championships were up on that podium between Semna, Hill, Schumacher and Fangio in what was truly a race to remember that showed the greatness of a driver we'll always remember.

I\'m not defending Red Bull and I think they should have stuck with Lawson, but I think they get way too much flak for their treatment of drivers. They were loyal to Ricciardo and gave his career some shelf life in the end. Albon struggled and they kept him on the team as a simulator driver [then helped get him on to Willaims](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/alex-albon-on-his-year-on-the-sidelines-how-red-bull-helped-him-get-back-on.52fTxzftrNFBlEJuk0wE1c). When you look at other teams, Force India/Alpine were never really great with their drivers. McLaren treated Ricciardo the same, if not worse, then Checo was treated at Red Bull. You could argue Mercedes didn\'t handle the split from Lewis well, especially with the ""shelf life"" comments. Renualt, McLaren, and Ferrari all dropped Sainz when they felt there was a better option even though he performed well. \n\nAnd again, while I don\'t agree with Lawson only getting 2 races, he\'s not out of the sport. He\'s being moved back to Racing Bulls.', 'Gasly keeps banging on about feeling supported at Alpine.\n\n*ALPINE*.\n\nHis only comparison is as a young driver for Red Bull.
