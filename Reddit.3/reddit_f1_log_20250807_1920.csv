It shouldn\'t happen that an upgrade can mess everything up like that. With all the smart people on the team, all the simulations, and the infrastructure we have, you don\'t expect a car architecture to confuse you like that. We tried to solve one problem, and it made something else significantly worse. That\'s now been fixed.""*', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **As soon as the old rear axle was returned, Mercedes drivers regained confidence in their cars. The new rear axle will likely never be seen again.**\n\n> This result sounds familiar. At the Miami GP, McLaren celebrated a one-two finish. George Russell took third place on the podium. Back then, he was 33 seconds behind the winners. This time, it was only 22 seconds. Between those two races, there were eight races and three upgrades. Or one win and six disappointments.\n\n> At Imola, Mercedes aimed to solve a long-standing problem with its first major development step. A new rear axle with more anti-lift was intended to keep the rear of the car more stable during load changes, within the window where aerodynamics work best. But the debut turned out to be a failure. The drivers complained about an unstable rear end, which promptly led to increased tire wear.\n\n> In the subsequent races, the Mercedes engineers tried to find the problem, sometimes relying on the old rear suspension, sometimes on the new one. In retrospect, it must be considered unfortunate that the new rear axle was in the car for the victory in Montreal. It wasn\'t the new rear axle that led to the brilliant moment, but rather the special track layout.\n\n> **The unsuspecting front wing.**\nAfter Mercedes drifted into the midfield at Spielberg, Silverstone, and Spa, the engineers decided on the most radical solution possible: back to the starting grid. In Budapest, the old rear axle was back in service with a few new details that had been introduced in the meantime, but weren\'t suspicious.\n\n> Take the front wing, for example. Chief engineer Andrew Shovlin explains why the front wing was ruled out as the cause of the problems, despite its reduced flexibility. ""The data shows that the stiffness of the wing has an impact on the car\'s handling and balance, but not as dramatically as the drivers felt. We were able to correct this with the setup and, at most, we\'ve experienced a bit more understeer.""\n\n> George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli had barely completed their first laps at the Hungaroring when they thought they were driving a different car. ""The rear end is stable again when turning,"" Russell praised. His young teammate rejoiced: ""The confidence in the car is back.""\n\n> **Progress through regression.**\nTeam principal Toto Wolff summarized: ""We\'ve given our drivers a more stable platform. Their increased confidence has been reflected in their lap times."" Russell missed pole position by 0.053 seconds. Antonelli completed 50 laps on one set of tires, defending his tenth place.\n\n> But Wolff also had some critical words: ""We rebuilt the car to its pre-Imola state and made it better. It shouldn\'t happen that an upgrade can mess everything up like that. With all the smart people on the team, all the simulations, and the infrastructure we have, you don\'t expect a car architecture to confuse you like that. We tried to solve one problem, and it made something else significantly worse. That\'s now been fixed.""\n\n> Anti-lift suspensions aren\'t a bad idea per se, but for Mercedes, the concept didn\'t deliver the desired result because too many compromises were required to install them. ""It wasn\'t planned for us. Retrofitting is never ideal in such cases. If this type of suspension works better for Ferrari or McLaren, it\'s perhaps because they weren\'t as restricted in their installation as we were,"" Shovlin laments.\n\n> **Is Mercedes still celebrating victories?**\nAfter the result at the Hungarian GP, the Mercedes drivers are looking more positively toward the ten races following the summer break. ""It\'s not just the World Championship point that feels good after so many disappointments,"" Antonelli said with a sigh of relief. ""As long as I was able to drive in clean air, my speed was good. I now know that I can fight for points in every race again.""\n\n> Russell nevertheless cautions drivers to keep their feet on the ground and not assume that Mercedes will finish on the podium every time from now on. ""Apart from the McLarens, there were a lot of surprises in Hungary. The Astons were better than expected, and Max was further back. But in terms of speed, with the exception of Canada, it was our best Grand Prix in a long time. And that was on a track type that doesn\'t suit us that well. We can now look ahead to the remaining races with a little more confidence.""\n\n> At a time when Mercedes has regained a solid starting position, it\'s almost frustrating that everyone in the field has stopped their arms race. ""We don\'t have any major upgrades planned, but we can still make small adjustments and optimize the car\'s setup,"" Wolff hopes. At certain racetracks, this could even make the W16 a contender for victory again.

Inversely, the rating stays approximately the same in-between race 12 and 13, but the graph has a significant drop in-between those two races.\n\nThe lack of vertical gridlines amplify that issue because you can't exactly tell where the individual measurements are, so viewers won't see that the peaks and valleys aren't actual data.\nWith a straight line plot you don't need to have vertical gridlines as the changes in the line show where the data points are, but with smoothed lines you absolutely need them.\n\nOn another note, as you have a scale that goes from 0 to 100, set the y-axis range to 0 to 100. \nThat way you show the data with regards to the full range.\nLawson's graph is another good example for this because he seems to have hit a rating of 10 for races 3 and 4, so the graph implies that he has hit the lowest possible rating.\nAnd because of the smoothed lines it actually looks like the graph goes below 10, making it look like his rating goes into the negative and gets clipped."", 'LOL at the meltdowns', 'Holy this list is awful, Borteleto and Hadjar below Franco is crazy, Piastri 5th and Norris 6th is hilarious, agree that Albon has been top 5 or close though', ""Sees Albon ranked 3rd, I don't know what you guys are talking about, this model is clearly perfect!"", ""I'm just here to support you because you're going to get a bunch of hateful comments just for trying something different.\n\n\nI agree that one of the main issues with models like this one is that the model clearly assigns most of the weight to the car and then gets the deviations for each driver.

1mk12l0,People who's favourite driver retired/lost his seat did you stopped watching it or started supporting someone else or just what happened ? Can you tell what happened afterwards,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mk12l0/people_whos_favourite_driver_retiredlost_his_seat/,2025-08-07, Discussion,"I haven't get this feeling yet since Max is still racing and will continue to race in 2026. So I'm gonna tell my friends experience to give some more context.  A friend of mine is a very big Seb fan and while Seb was still racing if he had a free time he used to watch every practice session spending some time in F1 related communities in social media etc. He was die-hard fan. 

Anyways when he retired my friend was obviously sad, also he gradually quit F1 like first he just started to watch Quali and Race also stopped spending time in f1 communities afterwards he only started to watch races and nowadays he usually just looks up to race results and watches some races if they're promising to be exciting (Silverstone this year for example) 

So what happend to you it'd be nice to hear other people's experience too 

Thanks ","[""I still watch.\n\n\nI don't watch the practice sessions as religiously and I just sort of cry in my free time.\xa0\n\n\nNo big deal."", 'I\'m afraid there is not a ""one fits all"" answer to this. I did something similiar to what your friend did when Roger Federer retired, but I wasn\'t a fan of tennis, I was a fan of Roger\n\nI think the only way to know the answer is by asking yourself ""am I watching this because I love racing and this category or am I just watching because of Max""? Your favorite driver quitting doesn\'t necessarily mean you\'ll lose interest in the sport.\n\nedit: typos', ""I suggest trying to get attached to some other drivers now. Does one of the promising rookies catch your attention? My husband's favorite has been George since we started watching in 2021, but as time has gone on, he's added Oscar and now Bortoleto (picked up when watching F2 last year) to his list.\n\nIf your fandom is tied pretty exclusively to one driver, you might lose interest when Max retires. But, if your enjoyment is tied to the larger sport, you'll probably keep enjoying the sport. Also, you can move from being one type of fan to the other."", ""Being such a fan of one driver that you'd consider stopping watching when they retire is quite a weird concept for me. I'm a racing fan rather than a fan of any specific driver and I watch for the racing much more than personalities."", 'Seb diehard here, yeah i kinda stopped really following until any new drivers caught my interest in the same way. I follow Albon now, guy just seems like a great dude and we love a redemption arc. But even now I dont follow as closely as I did from 2007 onwards. A big part is finally having enough with awful race direction though. But damn i miss my guy.\n\nWhy did i get insta downvoted lmao', ""As a Mexican, I've had it both ways. I used to follow F1 since the early 2000s (as in read about it and watch some highlights on TV), and started watching some races around 2008-09 I think. Then Checo joined F1 in 2011 and that made me incredibly excited, so I started following it much more and watching qualys and races more often (sometimes it was too early in Mexico so after a night out I missed those). A turning point was Liberty Media taking over and making it much, much easier to watch F1, so by that point I very rarely missed a race. Checo then joined Red Bull and of course the excitement went through the roof. The last two years were rough though, I didn't want to watch the qualy anymore and just focus on the races, as it was honestly very hard to ignore his downfall. This year has been different, I still watch every race but much more stress-free. I support Charles (always have) but now I enjoy the season differently. I'm 100% sure I'll keep watching for many, many years."", ""I've always had a number of favourite drivers and I have a favourite team.\xa0\nI was very sad when Jenson retired, but you move on.
