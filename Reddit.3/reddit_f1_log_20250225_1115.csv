Think they are doing a filming day', ""Interesting discussion on Hakkinen v Raikkonen in yesterday's DD. I agree that Raikkonen probably had a better peak. My question is, who had lower lows? Raikkonen had more longevity so we've seen him go from the sharp to the back end, whereas Hakkinen retired closer to his prime.\n\nAs a hypothetical, how long would Ron Dennis have kept DC and Hakkinen as his pair if Hakkinen decided to stay? Surely Raikkonen was too good to pass up? Maybe Raikkonen eventually makes Hakkinen his no.2 like Alonso and Vettel did to him."", 'We are less than 24 hours from the start of preseason testing. Who else is going to be watching tomorrow?', ""What was Nigel Mansell's greatest year in F1? The obvious candidates are 1986, 1987 and 1992. But this question could obviously extend to his other seasons as well."", 'Rumor has it, they have gone for a radical redesign of their floor, which is, unfortunately, not visible in any pics.', 'For who had lower lows, I‚Äôd still say Hakkinen, even though he didn‚Äôt carry on as long. If Hakkinen had drivers like Alonso or Vettel alongside him in 1995, 1997, 2001 instead of Blundell or Coulthard he would have looked just as bad if not worse than Raikkonen did in 2014, 2015 or 2017.\n\nFor the second point, I‚Äôm not really sure. If Hakkinen performed in 2002 like he did in 2001 it would‚Äôve been difficult to justify keeping him over Coulthard but he was always Ron Dennis‚Äô favourite so maybe that would‚Äôve tilted things in his favour. If Hakkinen and Raikkonen ever were teammates I would expect Raikkonen to be clearly in front, especially at that stage of their respective careers.', 'It‚Äôs harder to compare their lows because Kimi‚Äôs weaknesses didn‚Äôt begin to become apparent until 2008, after which pretty much all reference points to Hakkinen (sans Barrichello maybe) had declined or retired. I think it‚Äôs just easier to conclude that Kimi‚Äôs base level - with all weaknesses considered - was a bit higher in general. \n\nI think a good number of drivers who came into the sport during the 2000s were operating on a higher base level than those in the prior era. If Hakkinen was weaker than Kimi then he is quite obviously weaker than Alonso, Lewis, Vettel, Rosberg, maybe Button too.', ""I'm going to just have it on in the background as a podcast. It's not very interesting to watch but I enjoy the pundits  just talking about anything and everything."", ""It's testing - so 6 hours of dead air with pundits grabbing at everything possible to kill the time and 2 hours of speculation from pundits and posts declaring who ever set the fastest lap time that hour as the season winner and everyone else as a failure.  \n  \nI'll join once we get to a race."", ""I've clearly got to go for 1995""]",1,14,0.57,1,13,13,1,4,0.06999999999999995,1

Alex? We'll see about that."", ""What Sainz is conveniently not thinking of is that you get someone like Verstappen or MSC once in a lifetime in your team. So it's best to do build everything around them. But no active driver would want to acknowledge this."", ""When Sainz left they had Verstappen paired with Ricciardo, I think it's fair to say those where two top drivers, probably more so than Verstappen + Sainz would be.\n\nAfter that they promoted from within, with little success.\n\nAfter that, they signed a top mid-field driver, who was at the time comfortably the strongest driver not already locked in with a team. Nobody really forsaw the total collapse he had.\n\nI don't think you can say Red Bull actively avoided having a strong driver next to Verstappen, they've not really had better options. Except maybe Sainz this year, but then is there really much reason to assume he'd do better than Perez? They tried getting a respected experienced driver from the outside and it didn't work out at all, why try the same thing again instead of promoting from within like they used to do?"", 'His statement will look a little bit weird in hindsight if Lawson is closer to Verstappen than Albon was.', 'I mean,  Marko (I know that old wind bag is full of shit) said about driver #2.  \n\n‚ÄúHe should become a consistent points scorer and help Max when he needs to, not try to,‚Äù he told‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt sign Carlos.  He is not that.', 'If Albon is deemed to be a top driver like Sainz claims, surely Lawson would be in the same category as a top driver?', ""Basically as we observed last year: because if you won't win the WCC, you could well win the WDC.\n\nMarko himself observed similar a while ago, that if the top 4 teams are very close in 2025, then being clear #1 is a massive advantage for Verstappen."", ""RBR wants to keep Max happy so he doesn't leave.  And the way to do that is to continue to give him weak 2nd drivers.  To be mentioned among the all-time greats one needs to have very good 2nd teammates to challenge them -- to really show the world how great they are.  Otherwise, it will always be: It was the car.  In this case: it was always Newey.""]",0,105,0.47,0,599,599,0,1,-0.020000000000000018,0
