1j4aai5,"Motorsport UK Chair, David Richards CBE, expresses Motorsport UK’s position in regard to the global governance of the sport",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j4aai5/motorsport_uk_chair_david_richards_cbe_expresses/,2025-03-05, News,,"['Dear Licence Holders, Clubs, Officials and Volunteers,\n\nAs your Chair, I’ve always believed, along with the Board and\nemployees of Motorsport UK, that we are answerable to you\nin respect of all our actions. After all, our task is to serve the\nbest interests of motorsport in this country and represent\nyou, our members. In my role as a member of the World Motor\nSport Council I’m also accountable to the full FIA membership\nworldwide and this letter has equal relevance to them.\nFor some time now I’ve had concerns about the erosion of\naccountability and good governance within the FIA. As you\nmay have seen in the press, an issue has recently emerged\nthat has compelled me to take a stand and needs an\nexplanation.\n\nFirst of all, let me turn the clock back to a little over three\nyears ago when we, alongside the Royal Automobile Club,\nsupported Mohammed Ben Sulayem in his bid to become\nthe next President of the FIA. Many of you were possibly\nsurprised that we didn’t support the British candidate, Graham\nStoker, but the Board met with both candidate teams and was\nconvinced by the well thought out plans that Mohammed’s\ncampaign team presented, which very much aligned with our\nown views of the way the FIA should transform itself.\n\nThe key messages in their presentation were:\n\n* A hands-off President who would be non-executive and\ndelegate the day-to-day running of the FIA to a professional\nexecutive team\n* The appointment of an empowered and capable CEO to run\nthe FIA to professional standards\n* Full transparency of actions and the highest standards of\nsporting governance\n\nI’m afraid that over the last three years there has been a\ndistinct failure to meet these promises. In fact, the situation\nhas progressively worsened with media reports confirming\nthat numerous senior members of the FIA and volunteer\nofficials have either been fired or have resigned under an\nopaque cloud. Furthermore, the scope of the Audit and\nEthics Committees has been severely limited and now\nlacks autonomy from the authority of the President, while\nour UK representative, who challenged certain matters,\nwas summarily removed along with the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee. Various techniques have also been deployed with\nthe effect of limiting the proper function of the World Motor\nSport Council, primarily the use of e-voting which removes the opportunity for much needed discussion and debate on key\nsubjects.\n\nThis has become increasingly worrying and the final straw\nfor me, three weeks ago, was being asked to sign a new\nconfidentiality agreement that I regarded as a ‘gagging order’.\nAt the time of my appointment to the World Motor Sport\nCouncil in 2021 I signed a confidentiality agreement and in\nfact was already bound by Article 4 of the FIA Code of Ethics.\nI remain committed to my confidentiality obligations under\nthis existing agreement and Article 4, which remain in effect.\nHowever, the new confidentiality agreement went far further\nthan this and, at a week’s notice, I was told that if I didn’t sign\nit, I would be barred from the next World Motor Sport Council\nmeeting.\n\nThe key clauses I objected to were:\n\n* Everything was now considered confidential, without any\nqualification, preventing me from necessarily sharing what I considered to be relevant information\n* The FIA, at its own discretion, could decide if anyone\nbreached the terms of the new confidentiality agreement\nwith no process or frame of reference\n* There was an immediate fine of €50,000 for any breach and\na threat of undisclosed damages\n\nThe construction of this new confidentiality agreement does\nnot comply with the Statutes of the FIA and contradicts\nthe promise of transparent governance we had voted for.\nI therefore asked that we debate the matter at the World\nMotor Sport Council, which was just days away, rather than\nhaving it forced upon us as a condition of attendance.\n\nMy request, along with those of a few other Members who\nshared our views, was denied and we were barred from\nattending the meeting. This was in total breach of the FIA\nstatutes that require all elected members be given full access\nto meetings. I should point out that I kept the Board of\nMotorsport UK fully informed throughout to ensure that I had\ntheir complete support.\n\nOur Motorsport UK lawyers, along with our French Legal\nCounsel, have challenged the FIA on their actions by setting\nout a clear set of questions that the FIA leadership needs to\nanswer. It is very disappointing to report that we have still\nnot received an answer to these or the fundamental question\nI raised: where in the FIA Statutes does it provide for an\nelected member to be barred from a meeting? (1/2)', ""For those who didn't read, this is an open letter by David Richards (one of those kicked out of the FIA meeting), publicly calling out MBS and the lack of transparency from the FIA lately.\n\nTL; Dr David Richards, Chairman of Motorsport UK, has expressed serious concerns about the governance of the FIA under President Mohammed Ben Sulayem. Despite initial support for Ben Sulayem's reform agenda, David notes a failure to deliver on promises of transparency and accountability. He criticises the dismissal of senior officials, compromised committee autonomy, and the imposition of a restrictive confidentiality agreement. Motorsport UK has legally challenged these actions, emphasizing the need for integrity and transparency. Richards warns of further legal action if issues remain unaddressed, stressing the importance of upholding governance standards ahead of the FIA's presidential election."", ""If this is true (not saying I doubt it), then it's laughable and downright egregious that MBS has not adhered to any of it, especially the first point. Wow.\n\n>The key messages in their presentation were:\n\n* A hands-off President who would be non-executive and delegate the day-to-day running of the FIA to a professional executive team\n* The appointment of an empowered and capable CEO to run the FIA to professional standards *(note: they did appoint a CEO but she resigned and the position has not been filled)*\n* Full transparency of actions and the highest standards of sporting governance"", 'That sure sounds like David Richards potentially paving the way to put his name forward as the new FIA head.', 'Heavenly article.\n\nNo fucking about. \n\nArticulate, clear and damning. Love it.', 'Richards for President', 'FUCK MBS.', ""Before even reading the statement, I thought: So this is an update, because you supported the guy.\n\nWe told you, we said that it was a bad idea, but oh no, being against him because of his background would be racist. Well I don't work in motorsports so I don't care for how long you're going to be stuck with him now. Enjoy..."", 'I remain open to signing an appropriately revised\nconfidentiality agreement, if that’s thought necessary, but only\nwhen we’ve addressed the key question of what constitutes\nconfidential information and, importantly, who decides on\nbreaches and the implementation of penalties and under\nwhat procedure. I believe I have a fundamental duty to keep\nyou, our members, fully informed and the way the proposed\nnew confidentiality agreement is structured would prevent me\nfrom doing this.\n\nI acknowledge that over the past three years the media does\nseem to have gained sensitive information from within the\nFIA, including matters that the President should reasonably\nhave expected to be kept confidential. However, these were\nin respect of reports to both the Audit and Ethics Committees\nand notably not the World Motor Sport Council, where we\nrarely discuss matters that should not be openly shared\nwith our own Members and Clubs as well as the broader FIA\ncommunity. After all, that’s the very nature of transparent\ngovernance that we voted for. No-one, least of all myself,\nwould dispute the fact that certain matters must be treated\nas confidential and sensitive for external release. However, we\nshould not allow that basic truth to be misused in order to\ncreate a blanket gagging order on volunteer representatives\non the various crucial Councils and Committees, this is not\nhow a member-owned and driven organisation should behave.\n\nI should also make mention of Robert Reid, who was elected\nas the FIA Deputy President for Sport, and the promise that\nhe would be empowered to work with the FIA Executive team \ndrive the sport forward. I think he has done an excellent\njob in this regard and made a positive impact worldwide.\nIncreasingly, actions have been taken which have undermined\nthe proper functioning of Robert’s elected role; this includes\nbeing denied access to materials, banned from meetings and\neven attending World Championship events. Again, this is not\nwhat we voted for.\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nIntegrity is a core value of Motorsport UK and one that is\ncentral to who we are. Our Board and Executive Team will\nalways operate in an open and transparent manner so that\nour members trust and respect our voice. We are fully aligned\nwith Sport England and UK Sport’s Code for Governance\nwhich sets out gold-standard levels of transparency,\naccountability and integrity in sports governance. It’s therefore\nbeholden on us to demand the same values of our governing\nbody, the FIA. These actions by the FIA are in breach of\ntheir own Statutes. As a result, we have informed the FIA\nthat unless they address the issues we’ve raised, we will be\nengaging in further legal action.\n\nIn a year when the President will either be re-elected or a\nnew one appointed, it is more important than ever to remind\nthe FIA of their responsibilities and continue to hold them to\naccount on behalf of the sport and their members worldwide,\nand that’s what I intend to do.\n\nKind regards\nDavid Richards, and the Board of Motorsport UK (2/2)']",431,53,0.98,431,43,43,9,0,0.0,9

What this means in terms of performance has yet to be seen, but i'm cautiously optimistic."", ""\nTranslation\n\n\nThe countdown has begun, in less than two weeks Ferrari's world championship will begin in Australia.\n\nThe new Rossa has not unveiled its cards clearly, no one really knows what to expect in terms of the fight against McLaren. Leclerc has already been burned and was extremely cautious in his predictions, Hamilton did not complete his final race simulation.  At the conclusion of the three-day test in Bahrain, it would be wrong to say that the SF-25 has completely convinced spectators and insiders.\n\nPut on the track, the new car showed a base with potential but yet to be fully settled. In Maranello there is talk of settings “to be calibrated.” Beyond the pure performance, of which any judgment is postponed until March 16, Bahrain therefore left with it some perplexities about the SF-25's firepower.\n\n\n“Before I go out on a limb about whether the car is fast, I would prefer to wait“-the words of an always very eloquent Charles Leclerc in externalizing his feeling for the prancing horse's single-seater-”It will only be seen in Melbourne where we are at, when we will have everything in the best condition to try to extract the best from the car. At the tests we struggled a bit more in the balance.” Red Bull is a bit disappointed with its own testing and sees Ferrari as the closest force to McLaren, a sign -- according to its French technical director -- that the SF-25 still played hide-and-seek a bit more than the others. The constructors' title holders took a risk with the MCL39 design to try to make the world championship boring, however they say “we don't trust Ferrari at all”\n\n\n\nNo anomaly from Bahrain: Reports analyzed in Maranello showed no lack of correlation\n\nThe engineers are devoting themselves to analyzing the data produced during the work of the three-day Sakhir test session. At no time did the program carried out in Bahrain have the goal of seeking true performance, except for small, focused flashes. The tendency not to uncover all one's cards in terms of pure performance is confirmed by the data and a work program focused on getting to know the car from the aspect of the behavior of the new mechanical platform, and how it reacts to changes in setup and tire management. The car showed itself as it was to be expected, with a “more powerful” front end even if still to be optimized due to an overturned pull-rod suspension that requires more knowledge at the mechanical level. This aspect, moreover, also affected the braking behavior, which more or less indirectly, changes.\n\nHowever, Ferrari came out of Bahrain with certain questions, and it will be necessary to see the car further on the track to draw more definitive conclusions. Problems that one might venture to call “youthful,” of which the team prefers to approach with caution for now. Analyses of the aerodynamic data, which arrived from the Bahrain reports, show no lack of correlation, however, and from the information in AutoRacer's possession nothing anomalous was found with the work done in the winter in the tunnel. An analysis if you will, that confirms the statements of Team Principal Vassuer right in Bahain: “The numbers we detected are the same as we expected.”\n\nHamilton and Leclerc engaged in three days of simulator testing to arrive with fewer unknowns in Australia. The rear end was limited by a mechanical setup yet to be centered.\n\n\nHamilton and Leclerc provided two sides of the same coin. The SF-25 “is not slow,” but it still needs to be put on the right tracks, that was the first verdict that came from Sakhir.  The rear that does not follow the front is a problem that for now in Maranello they are addressing solely on the mechanical front. The Italian single-seater was born having undergone a major axle re-destruction work, passed through the shortening of the gearbox. This was a non-trivial work aimed at widening the setup and having the weight placement shifted more forward. It is clear that such a radical change by necessity was going to shift the balance and references that the engineers of the cavallino had the previous year.\n\n\n\nBahrain in testing also offered a far from ideal track, unrepresentative especially for what we will then see on the official weekend when F1 will stop there at the third round of the season: “It is quite unlikely that similar weather will be found when the F1 world championship stops here again.”\n\n\nLeclerc and Hamilton are currently in Maranello for work on the simulator that will last for three days and marked by a program aimed at taking stock of the situation ahead of Australia.The two Ferrari drivers will have a rather busy week since in addition to the work in the factory, they will be joined by 'extra-track' work. Last night Leclerc and Hamilton's presence, together with Vasseur, at the PUMA event and tomorrow the presentation in the team square where, for the occasion, as we told you, the two drivers will also take to the track with two 'dated' Formula 1 cars, which should be the SF90 and the SF-21.\n\n\n\nThe SF-25 in fact we will see in two weeks at a track quite different from Bahrain, less limiting on the rear with the 2022 layout changes, which on the one hand may meet the redhead's needs in this first taste of the season. The focus will be to put the rear in the window without weakening the front, at a track that will also offer technical cues under the aspect of tires and possible front graining. The aerodynamic set-up, moreover, will see no upheaval; the new-generation rear wing with its more prominent spoon is firmly at the center of a macro-configuration that will see it often employed on medium-load tracks.\n\n\nLevels of vertical thrust at the rear end will be mostly set by the use of beam wings that are more or less wide and dependent above all on the grip that the semi-permanent Albert Park track will offer. McLaren has seen itself strong and starts as the big favorite in this start of the season, at the same time in Maranello the first three races will serve as a benchmark to definitively direct the development of the platform:“ we have opened a new door for development”-as Vasseur himself had made clear during testing. Will it be enough?"", ""If Hamilton has another frustrating car to setup, I think he's going to let Zhou drive lol."", 'All the teams are going to be doing the same, trying to maximise their respective cars based off what testing told them.

If Nico Hulkenberg ends up at the bottom of the standings this year because the Sauber isn’t competitive, it doesn’t really mean he isn’t a great driver (He’s consistently been a strong midfield driver). 

At the same time Hamilton, Max, Seb and other WDC winners have benefited from having a strong car. That shouldn’t take anything away from their achievements either because you could have the best car but being unable to extract what the car provides could hurt you.

But using data (or otherwise), is there a good way of estimating the impact of someone’s skills as a driver and how that eventually impacts their standings on the grid?

I’m big into statistics within Formula One, but lap times and other metrics also have the factor of the car’s strengths/weaknesses baked into it so it’s hard to quantify how someone is really performing. It would be easy if everyone had the same machinery (Like Alonso once suggested ha!).

The drivers on the grid are so competitive, that the difference between them might be smaller than what we perceive. The simplest comparison for me so how you fare against your teammate, but then again it’s in a limited sphere of a single team.

We can see the teammate comparisons and when driver moves team, you can correlate them.\n\nBut that is not precise science at all, there are probably another hundreds of variables to take into consideration: driver\'s familiarity with their car, how much does their car suit the driver\'s default driving style, how much does a certain track suit the car and how much does the track suit the driver, how good the setup works are from their team, driver\'s own growth over the years, as well as normal fluctuation in their form...\n\nSo if you were to quantify this, a certain driver\'s ""power score"" might be ""91.2 +/- 1.5"" and another driver\'s might be ""89.7 +/- 3.6"" (numbers don\'t mean anything -- I\'m just using it to make the point). That errorbar depends on all those factors mentioned above. The 89.7 driver may very well seem to be better than the 91.2 driver because he\'s driving a car more suited to him. So in many cases, we might think the driver is  worse (better) than he really is because he never get to drive a car that suit (doesn\'t suit) his style.\n\nIf you\'re an engineer from a team, you have way more data and probably could break this down into much much more details, you\'d probably have insights like ""driver A is generally X% better than driver B in this type of corners, when the car is setup in this way"", and then you can probably do a weighted average to get the whole picture between driver A and driver B if you\'d like to\n\nWith the amount of lap time data we (as outsiders) have, you can probably do this analysis as well, but it probably will be so inaccurate that it really doesn\'t mean anything', 'It’s only really possible to compare drivers who drive the same car i.e teammates, and even then you might find some inconsistencies due to one driver being better with a car that a particular characteristic.

If you have, could you detail if it was worth it and what the working hours are like? Are there reasonable breaks or chairs to sit down on or do you stand up all day? All that is written for the job description is that it is a zero hour contract with morning and evening shifts available, so I just want to see if I can get some more info from previous employees!",[],8,2,0.83,8,0,0,0,0,-0.06000000000000005,0
1j47fmv,2025 Predictions,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j47fmv/2025_predictions/,2025-03-05, Discussion,"Testing is done. Early observations are being made and 2025 seems like it could be the most competitive ever. With that in mind how do you see the season going?

Which team wins the WCC?

Ferrari. I think both Lewis and Charles finish in the top 4 of the drivers standings 

Who wins the WDC?

Max Verstappen in the closest Championship since 2021. I think 3 drivers will still have a chance at the Championship with 2 races left.

Which rookie finishes the highest in the standings? 

Kimi Antonelli (6th)

Biggest surprise this season?

Kimi Antonelli. I think he beats his teammate George Russell at Mercedes and finishes no lower than 6th in the World Drivers Championship. It may take him a few races but George will be the #1 driver at Mercedes very long.

One wild prediction? 

Max Verstappen retires from Formula One at the end of the 2025 season.



What are your predictions?","['Cars go vroom vroom around circles, maybe the red car goes vroom vroom faster,maybe the orange car does or maybe even the orange driver.', 'People underestimate George. If Kimi beats him that is an all time rookie season especially considering his age and experience in the car.  If he’s in the ballpark that is an all time type season too. Way younger than Lewis for example in his rookie year.', 'Kimi Antonelli struggles and Bottas comes back as 2nd driver..Which will then lead to Sainz joining Mercedes next year with Anotonelli going to Williams.', 'Ferrari WCC.\n\nNorris WDC.\n\nAntonelli highest rookie.\n\nGasly podium.', 'Ferrari WCC unless they royally screw it up\n\nWDC depends on the car, Norris, Verstappen, Lewis or Charles can all be WDC', ""I think the season won't be finished due to WW3. That or Vettel WDC with Jordan WCC (in yellow livery)"", ""It will be tight between McLaren and Ferrari for the WCC, that's for sure. I can't pick a winner between those two, I can see both teams doing a great job. If Norris can reduce the number of errors it will be super close, otherwise I can see the Ferrari team having the edge. \n\n  \nFor the driver title I honestly can't pick anything. Testing is too little to go by, and there are often other factors that come into the play later in the season. I think the fight will be between the McLaren drivers, Ferrari Drivers, Max and Perhaps George if the car is competitive enough."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, i predict\n\nA HAAS FUCKING PODIUM', ""WDC- Lando WCC- McLaren, best rookie- hadjar, surprise- Antonelli to pull a 24 Perez like season and swapped with sainz at the end of the season. Wildcard- Max to Aston for 26 and its Alonso who's getting replaced(I hope not)""]",0,31,0.41,0,28,28,0,1,0.019999999999999962,0
