So we need to solve this situation and start overtaking on the straight with the DRS like everyone [else] does.”\n\n>“We need to improve a little bit our straightline speed and also the [tyre] degradation. As I said, Saturdays are quite competitive and Sundays we seem to take a step back.\n\n>“So happy for today for sure, first points, good Safety Car at the end, good timing and things.

1l2efu0,2026 regs probably won’t affect McLaren domination  much,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l2efu0/2026_regs_probably_wont_affect_mclaren_domination/,2025-06-03, Discussion,"Im starting to feel like 2026 might shake the order from P2 to P10, but with McLaren still at the top even after the regulation change. 

The reason: How much revolutionary their brakes are. Tire conservation and the capability of keeping them on the right temperature window will still be key and this is not changing with the new regs. 

We have seen that when the temps are cooler they don’t dominate as much, but in so many circuits the temps are hard to control and they do it so much better than the rest. If other teams don’t find out how to replicate that technology, it’s going to take a much, much faster car to offset that advantage. 

I get that 2009 double-diffuser feeling, but in this case, much harder to copy. 

Thoughts? ","[""People will eventually figure out how McLaren's handling the brakes, and will get it copied sufficiently.  The hidden nature of the brake ducking system makes it harder than the double diffuser, but it'll happen eventually, even if it means that Mercedes hires away McLaren engineers that bring that information with them."", ""As Andy Cowell said in a press conference a few weeks ago (with Toto and James Vowles, who all agreed); McLaren's success is almost certainly not down to one silver bullet, they're just doing every little thing a tiny bit better than the other teams, and that all adds up to a relatively large performance difference.\n\nThe idea that their entire success is down to some brake ducts is just an easy narrative for the press and the fans to jump on."", 'Nobody really knows what’s going on there, it could be nothing to do with the wheels at all and everything to do with their suspension platform being “just right”\n\nThey’ll be strong again but only because they’ve attracted a lot of talent and funding, and have probably the most modern equipment like their wind tunnel', 'I hear this but every time a new regs cycle are introduced the tyres tend to b very conservative from Pirelli so in theory that advantage could be wiped away. But let’s face it, anything could happen in 26', 'I dunno, new regs do shake up the field. Maybe some advantages carry over, but teams have 9 months to figure out where that advantage comes from and create their own version.\n\nI imagine they will be in the mix at the front, but too early to say if they will dominate again.', 'Arent there new and smaller tyres next year? How are you possibly going to account for that?', ""Issue is, we don't really know what makes the McLaren's so fast. 2026 might not touch them, or for some odd reason may inadvertently nerf."", ""It's going to be like 2014, probably. If an engine manufacturer nails the regulations, they're going to cruise for a few years while everyone catches up.\n\nHopefully it's Mercedes again since half the grid will be running their engines."", ""Yeah I kinda had the same thought. \n\nPeople are talking like Merc is for sure on top next season. The big advantage they have is obviously access to engine manufacturing. \n\nBut if they can't catch up on tire temperatures or aerodynamic advantages.
