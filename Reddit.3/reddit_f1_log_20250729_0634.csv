1mbaarm,Tyres continues to destroy the possibility of good races.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mbaarm/tyres_continues_to_destroy_the_possibility_of/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"I have posted previously that I find it incredibly frustrating that the (S) tyre is basically a qualifying tyre now and almost never gets any use in races.


But once again the race yesterday saw basically no variance in tyre strategy 


Most cars put the (M) tyre on around lap 13. 


By lap 20 
- Piastri 1:46:7
- max 1:46:8
- Leclerc 1:47:1 
- Russell 1:47:4


On lap 43 
- Piastri 1:45:7
- max 1:46:5
- Leclerc 1:46:5
- Russell 1:56:6


Now obviously the cars are carrying much less fuel at this stage, but how is the medium still performing this well after 30+ laps! 


There is no point in risking a tyre change when the delta doesn’t exist and overtaking is difficult 


","[""I actually thought Lando putting on the hards was a masterstroke because I didn't expect a medium to last 3 quarters of a race"", ""big factor is the low track and air temp that put way less stress on the tyres.\n\nProbably, in a 100% dry race with 25-26°C air temp and 40+°C track temp, Medium tyres wouldn't last 30+ laps."", 'Yeah, the mediums lasted longer than expected, I think the cold weather helped.', 'Pirelli skipping a compound theoretically meant that the Hard should have been too slow, and so would push everyone to a 2-stop race on the significantly faster Mediums paired with either a Soft or Hard. There should have been variety in strategy. \n\nThe problem was the wet start and shortened race (not just that we went racing on Lap 4, but that the slick tyre race started on Lap 11-13).\n\nThis resulted in a 32 lap dry race, which made the two-stop too slow and so all strategy pointed to managing the Medium to the end. That’s what ruined it. \n\nIn essence a super slow paced Medium was faster than a pushed Hard which was faster than a pushed Medium-Medium.', 'cold weather helped pilots keep those tyres usable last so long, only cars with excessive load were chewing through them.', 'The issue is more complex.\n\n\nPirelli has to provide three compounds but they need to cover a ton of scenarios based on the weather and in general during the year you have such different conditions in terms of temp, heat, surface that they just cannot have that many specific tires and they need to guarantee safety across all of these possible conditions.\xa0\n\n\nIf the tires are too different in performance then you force the same strategy ultimately.\xa0\n\n\nThe bigger issue at play here is that tires have become the only strategic tool and this makes races way more predictable. Refueling added so much dynamics to races as you could undercut heavily since less fuel also meant shorter pit stops.\n\n\nNow the difference between the slowest pit and the fastest is what, 1s? This makes it just so hard to use pits and number of stops as a viable strategy', 'Track resurfacing also had an impact. Similar to Suzuka', ""Tyre management.

A shame they didn't/couldn't double stack, since he easily lost net time to Oscar by having to do another lap on inters and lost net time to Charles behind as well, but I also have a feeling that if they had double stacked they would've both ended up on the mediums since the call for the hard seemed to be a super last minute call from his engineer as he was coming in. The extra lap on inters + the slow stop + a much slower tire meant he was climbing a mountain just to put Oscar under pressure. I think his own mistakes cost him the chance to get into DRS range, but I'm not sure even if he had had 5-6 laps of DRS behind Oscar that he would've been able to make the pass, given what we saw in the sprint and with Max/Charles throughout the whole race.\n\nOverall, I think both Lando and Oscar can take away plenty of positives from this weekend.

The sweet spot of where there's just enough of a light drizzle to cause wet conditions that are deemed acceptable seems incredibly narrow."", ""Because they are incredibly scared of the rain now, they actually went to the other side of the spectrum. \n\nRemember Silverstone? They started the formation lap behind the SC when it was almost dry, it looked so sad they let the SC go before Copse. In Belgium they did way too many laps behind the SC even if the rolling start was always gonna be the decision, I cant understand why they did so many laps behind the SC on a track where it hadn't rained for 20-30 (?) Mins at that point. \n\nI get that the sport safety procedures have changed but they have also killed an aspect of the sport that I dont think goes against the safety of the sport."", ""First attempt: planned to start on time, SC start was standard procedure. Overwhelming driver feedback was that visibility was too bad, so red flag. No fast second attempt due to the following rain shower.\n\nSecond attempt: Medical car was out a bit after the rain stopped, and recommended a further 10 min delay to clear standing water. They planned for two SC laps, the third SC lap was for spray on Kemmel straight after Raidillon, fourth lap to decide on starting procedure in light of the grid conditions.\n\nI still don't quite get their argument for the 3h clock, but it looks like with a suspended start, nothing else matters, for some reason. Either way, it was a good decision."", 'F1 is heading the way of NASCAR - rain, park them\n\nIf cars are not hydroplaning then race', 'Today’s cars, with the ground effects, pull a tremendous amount of water off the ground and throw it up as spray.
