Lance Stroll represents a wasted talent and an undeserved seat in Formula 1, especially when there are younger, highly skilled F2 drivers waiting for their opportunity to shine. Every time I watch Stroll drive, it appears as though he is doing so out of obligation rather than genuine passion. His performances lack the drive and determination expected at this level of F1. When Carlos Sainz was replaced by Lewis Hamilton at Ferrari and subsequently moved to Williams, I couldn’t help but wonder how different things could have been if Aston Martin had prioritized merit over nepotism. The prevalence of favoritism in the sport is truly disappointing and continues to hinder the careers of promising young drivers.
