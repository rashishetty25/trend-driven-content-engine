Leaving the safety issue of refueling aside, which other series have addressed, refueling adds the variable of fuel distance to the equation. 

Adding a second mandatory pit stop for tires would, for some races, could bring some different tire strategies into play. For example instead of a one pit strategy of Med to Hard, a two pit strategy of Soft, Soft, Hard. 

What other options would introduce more variables into race strategies and potentially reduce the likelihood of some races just being a procession?

MARCA wanted to know if Fernando agrees that he uses this two-faced attitude, since he had a run-in in Australia and was sanctioned for the Mercedes driver\'s statement.\n\n‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so. I think George is a great driver, a great person and I‚Äôm good friends with George as well, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs just showing different faces here and there. I think it‚Äôs more about what I think Max probably agrees with me in that I said many times that some of the penalties are a bit not consistent, like if you have that episode in Qatar and then you go to the next event and you replicate exactly the same episode, you can induce that episode by driving, then you don‚Äôt get the same result in terms of penalties, so that‚Äôs the frustration that we sometimes have,‚Äù he says about penalties that are applied once and then they don‚Äôt come back again.\n\n""They\'ve recently changed the race director and also some of the people in the stewards\' room, so I hope all those changes are for the better and to improve this consistency that we\'re asking for . We have to give them a bit of time as well and hopefully, yes, here and next year we\'ll have a more consistent and better result,"" he added about the episode.\n\nStaying motivated throughout 2024\n\n‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt difficult to stay motivated because every two weeks you have the opportunity to do a little bit better than the weekend before. This calendar doesn‚Äôt allow you to rest or have time to think. You are racing continuously so, yes, it wasn‚Äôt easy, it wasn‚Äôt difficult to get motivation, but, yes, in a way I am used to not having the best car, so I think I once had the best Toyota car in the WEC in 25 years of racing, so I am always motivated.‚Äù\n\nMelbourne, the 25th anniversary of the first race with Minardi\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really care, you know, it‚Äôs not a big deal, I‚Äôm just enjoying this part of my career and I still feel fast and motivated and I‚Äôm enjoying with the team, the progress, the good things, but also the bad things, where we try to learn from them. We‚Äôll soon start working with great people that I admire, like Adrian Newey, Enrico (Cardile) will join the team also soon, like Andy Cowell recently. They‚Äôre people that I competed against and now I have the possibility to work alongside them and learn from them and, you know, I think it‚Äôs a good moment of my life and my career, so I‚Äôm enjoying every day.\n\nGround Effect Cars \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, obviously these ground effect cars are a bit different. I think this year we also showed everyone that it‚Äôs difficult to improve the car, because the cars have become very sensitive to changes and very critical in some areas where even improvements are no longer a guarantee that they will make the car faster. Running so low and so close to the ground and some of the kerbs are also a bit difficult for the car, we can lose even parts of the car when we go over the kerbs, so this kind of fragile aspect of the cars is not very good in terms of having fun driving or attacking in qualifying laps or in the race. But yeah, I think it was no different than last year or 2022 when we introduced this ground effect, so this year was just another one of these.‚Äù\n\nHappy to be done or would you rather continue?\n\n‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs over, I think it‚Äôs a very long season for everyone, for the mechanics, for everyone in the team, 24 races is ultra demanding, especially the last triple we did. I think for Max it ended when he won in Las Vegas and for us probably after the summer. We were already fifth in the championship, with no threats from behind and the remaining seven or eight races have been a bit long. We try to learn about the car for next year‚Äôs project but apart from that there‚Äôs not much to do, so yeah, I‚Äôm happy to take the winter break now and start from scratch next year and hopefully be more competitive. The motivation is different when you finish Abu Dhabi and start next year‚Äôs car and next year‚Äôs simulator work and everything than just coming in, knowing that we‚Äôll be ninth to twelfth here and maybe we can correct the starting positions on Sunday. And we‚Äôll only get one or two wrong, so this is what we‚Äôre missing in terms of emotions on Formula 1 weekends.‚Äù\n\nHis best performances in 2024\n\n""The best performance was Monza for the race and China for qualifying.""\n\nWhat is this track like for the AMR24?\n\n""It will be the same, I don\'t think it will be a good track, so, yes, fighting for Q3 if possible and fighting for points on Sunday, that will be the goal, but nothing really exciting.\n\nHe does not appear in the top-10 in the F1 Power Ranking\n\n""Yeah, I see it in the media sometimes, you know, but it\'s pointless. When I see that I\'m not on the list, I think, I don\'t know what position I am in, I just see the top 10 and then I\'m not there and I\'m ninth in the Drivers\' Championship with the seventh or eighth fastest car...

So, Verstappen is equal with Norris with no change in position. Should Verstappen not have either been 2nd (so change is +1) or if he was equal with Norris, should Norris not fall to 2nd?

Even if we look at the best possible Qatar-score for Norris (6.9) that is a difference with Verstappen his score of 2.3. Divide that by 23 races and you get exactly 0.1.

I think this opinion comes about based on the fact that he is amazing on Sundays given his race pace but when looking at Alonso's qualifying stats, they are actually quite impressive to be honest. I think the reputation that he isn't as good over one lap comes from the time he spent in cars which were terrible at heating up the tyres over one lap (the Ferraris for example) and obviously his years spent in midfield cars.

But if we look at some of his qualifying head to head it's quite remarkable.

12 - 1 in his rookie season

15 - 4 over his teammate both of his championship years. The most poles both of these years as well.

8 - 9 To Lewis but 7 poles if fuel corrected (obviously an estimate and not purely accurate) 

27 - 1 to Piquet Jr. In his second renault stint

15-4 (2010)

15 - 4 (2011) 

17 - 3 (2012)

11 -8 (2013) 

Outqualified Massa every year. Only year where it was close was oddly 2013.

16 - 3 Raikkonen 

8 - 8 Button in his first year at Mclaren, not his usual performance

15 - 4 Made up for it in 2016 though.

32 - 2 to Vandoorne in both of their years together.

Out of all of these years he's been matched by Hamilton one year and Trulli another, Hamiltons one lap pace is obviously recognised  and Trulli was fast as well although  I think Alonso was at his weakest in terms of qualifying during their time together.
 
However, the level of domination imposed over drivers who were believed to be quick like Massa or Raikkonen is insane. He also then beats them by a greater extent in race head to head. Post return I would agree he has lost a slight edge or atleast took some time to get it back, but was still something like 20 - 3 up on Stroll last year and something like 16 - 5 this year. ","['I don‚Äôt think anyone has underrated Fernando ever', ""Yeah. Same thing for Schumacher. His head to head record is 217-35 in career part 1.

* 2022: 240 points
* 2023: 234 points
* 2024: 211 points
* Total: 685 points

So both of them have scored same amount of points across those three seasons!

What about number of wins between these two? Russell has scored three victories (Brazil 2021, Austria 2024 and Las Vegas 2024), whereas Hamilton has scored two (British 2024 and Belgium 2024).

In case Hamilton scores more points in Abu Dhabi, he will technically become third teammate to Russell who has outscored him over their time as teammates (Kubica did outscore him 1-0 in 2019 and if you want to count 2020, Bottas technically did outscore him 4-3 when they happened to be teammates for that one race).

And, if Russell scores more points, he will become the second teammate to Hamilton who has outscored him over their time as teammates (Button did outscore him 672-657 during 2010-2012 seasons)

So, who do you think will end up having more points in total across these three seasons?

Or do they both end up on same amount of points? This is only possible if either of these two scenarios occur:

1. Both of them end up outside the points (0 points for both) or
2. One of them finishes 9th in the race and the other one finishes 10th. And the one who finishes 10th in the race also drives fastest lap of the race. Both would end up getting 2 points from the race.

More races will be cancelled in Europe in the coming years.\n\n\n""Of course we see that happening,"" says Van Overdijk. ""The world of Formula 1 has changed.

It was a premature end to the relationship between the Enstone team and the Frenchman, who contested his final Grand Prix at Losail on Sunday. Although he had only just retired, the rumour was circulating before it was confirmed and then made official: Jack Doohan will take his place from next weekend at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the 2024 season.\n\nAccording to sources close to the team, everything happened very quickly, just a few hours before the start of the Qatar Grand Prix, when Flavio Briatore called Esteban Ocon into his office. The Alpine chief advisor told him that he would not release him for the season-ending test with Haas unless he gave up his seat early.\n\nHowever, the director of the Frenchman's future team, Ayao Komatsu, had already indicated at Interlagos that an agreement had been reached. However, Alpine never officially confirmed the news, postponing it until Esteban Ocon was presented with the conditions, he would have to accept to ratify it.\n\nWith preparations already underway for those tests, which will take place at Yas Marina next week following the final Grand Prix of the season, the Frenchman decided not to give up, even if it meant missing out on a proper farewell to Alpine, as was a priori planned for the final race of the championship.\n\nEsteban Ocon, for example, had planned to wear a special helmet at this final Grand Prix in honour of the team whose colours he has defended for the past five years. In the end, however, his relationship with the team ended abruptly in Losail on Sunday, in the very first corner, after a collision with Franco Colapinto that he could do nothing about.\n\nEsteban Ocon's early departure means that Alpine will be able to give Jack Doohan his racing debut before next season, against a backdrop of speculation that Flavio Briatore is genuinely interested in Franco Colapinto.\n\nWe know that the Australian rookie was evaluated in more detail a few weeks ago during a test session to which Pierre Gasly was invited to establish a benchmark. Sources in the paddock suggest that he was close to the times set by the Frenchman, who will be the natural leader of the Alpine in 2025.\n\n**‚ÄúThis is not the way I wanted it to end.‚Äù**\n\nThis evening, Esteban Ocon gave his first reaction to the issue, writing on social networks:\n\n>*First of all, I would like to thank the mechanics and engineers working on all the functions at the circuit, at Enstone and at Viry-Ch√¢tillon who have raced alongside me over the last five seasons. We have shared so much together, and I am proud to call many of you, my friends.*\n\n>*I leave Alpine/Renault with great memories and the pride of having been the driver with the team's best results since returning to the sport, taking the top two podium places in Bahrain, Hungary, and Brazil. It was also an honour to contribute to fourth place in the constructors' championship in 2022. I know how much all those moments meant to everyone and it is that sense of achievement and joy alongside the team that I take with me.*\n\n>*It has not been an easy year for the team and the second half of the season was particularly difficult. For various reasons. I have absolutely no regrets, because I gave 100% in every session. As I have always done.*\n\n>*To the hundreds of hard-working men and women at Enstone and Viry, I apologise for not being able to come and see you in person and bid you a proper farewell. As you know, the plan has always been to race one last time this weekend and to say goodbye to you personally next week. I was looking forward to both. It is not the way I wanted things to end. That said, it is a small world in F1 and I am sure I will see many of you again soon.*\n\n>*I'd also like to wish my friend Jack every success as he takes the next step in his career at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this week.*\n\n  \nPD: Thanks u/RumBlaze to share it in the comments in the previous post about Ocon IG post."", 'If I were Doohan at this point of time, I would be both excited for the opportunity but also scared of the future with this team', 'Just heartbreaking.

He never lit up the field and he wasn't likely going to be the next Verstappen no matter what car he was in. But let's not pretend in his first season he didn't go toe to toe with Bottas, who is *far* better than the goldfish memory that dominates F1 fandom seems to give him credit for. He dipped following a massive, serious crash, which is a pattern other drivers have exhibited before, and even then didn't become crash happy.

He raced clean, in a complete junker of a car, and while he lost consistently to his much more experienced teammate let's not pretend Bottas wasn't hanging out at the back of the grid in that tractor, as well.

Zhou's consistency, as well as his ability to shove that Sauber where it shouldn't be on (an inconsistent) occasion honestly makes it seem like we potentially let a good midfielder slip through F1 without a fair shot. Consistency and lack of crashing is what got us Hulk on the grid so long, and it's hard to imagine that in *literally* any other car we wouldn't be rating him a bit differently.

According to Pierre Wache, however, it is not right to point the finger at the team with regard to the difficult season.\n\n>*The winter is coming and so it is time to look back with several prominent figures in Formula 1. During the Qatari Grand Prix we spoke with Pierre Wache, the technical director behind the car of Max Verstappen. Last year the Frenchman was praised, this year he received a lot of criticism because Red Bull Racing suddenly had a dominant car during the 2024. How was it for Wache to suddenly rarely win and did the totally dominant season of 2023 actually work as a ‚Äònithi for‚Äô in 2024?*\n\n>‚ÄúWe are here to do our job as best we can and it‚Äôs very annoying if we don‚Äôt win a race. Everyone in the paddock, I think, I have this vision in mind. We\'re all here to win. The last, successful season does not help us, since it is extremely difficult to win. Also internally it does not help that you win so much, since there are also many young people who also come into the team and they are actually only used to winning.""\n\n>‚ÄúThis will eliminate the sense of those people of how exceptional it is to win one race at all, let alone a championship. People forget that after such a season when we had in 2023 it is terribly difficult to continue to win races. Just ask Max Verstappen, he also knows how difficult it is to win in all those years. He won a number of races in 2016, but in 2021 came the title until 2021, which shows how difficult it is,‚Äù said Wache, who would like to clarify that after all these years in Formula 1 he still realizes how unique it is to win in the premier class of motorsport.\n\n>‚ÄúEvery good thing has to be right to win in Formula 1, everything has to be well tuned to make it possible. You also have to be a bit lucky and you also have to have a good police performance, haha (Wache refers to the stewards as being police, ed.). The problem of winning so much is that the police will pay even more attention to you, especially in relation to how much you look at the rest. That\'s how it works. It is like with brothers in a family, the smallest brother can do more because he is less followed"", laughs the always sympathetic Wache, but at the same time an important point seems to have been touched upon in his opinion. \n\n>Limit\n\n>*This year there was a lot of fuss about, shall we say, \'the gray area\' of the regulations. Do you think that will be the case again next year?*\n\n>""These cars are difficult to develop further. There are always gray areas, but that also appeals to you as an engineer. But if you look at McLaren\'s rear wing, sorry, but that is more than operating in a gray area. They have ""We also use that wing for several races, right? Without that rear wing earlier this season, they wouldn\'t win in Baku, for example, and if you put that together, the constructors\' championship would now look very different.""\n\n>*Is that just frustrating or also interesting, since you are also an engineer and are looking to improve the car?*\n\n>""I cannot deny the interestingness of it, but as an engineer you also have to respect the rules. The difference between the technical regulations and the sporting regulations is that with the technical regulations you have to prove that you are doing it according to the rules. With the sporting regulations it is the other way around. It is the reverse of, for example, a speed measurement by the police, where they can only estimate your speed at one point, but do not see the rest. With the technical regulations you have to show that you are fits well, because everything visible.""\n\n>*However, isn\'t the gray area also part of the game?*\n\n>""Yes, of course it\'s part of the game, but at the same time there are limits. If the police don\'t see it, it doesn\'t mean it\'s legal. Look at what happened in the past at Ferrari, for example, that\'s more than pushing the limits. It is therefore frustrating for us when the police do not do their work.""\n\n>*So you clearly have the feeling that other teams went over the limit too often this year?*\n\n>""Yes, quite a bit over the limit indeed. However, at a certain point it is what it is and that is the playing field on which it is played.

1h5khol,Liam Lawson - Yes or No?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5khol/liam_lawson_yes_or_no/,2024-12-03, Discussion,"After the saga of getting Ricciardo replaced by Liam Lawson, I have got to say I have not been that impressed with him since being back on the grid. 

When he first came on the scene, replacing Ricciardo after breaking his hand last year, he looked great. But we have seen through De Vries, after a great debut with Williams, that what looked good initially doesn't always transpire. The most recent example is Colapinto. Came in, looked great, but with some recent errors and crashes, Red Bull aren't interested anymore

- I'm interested to hear your thoughts on Liam's performances 


 - and Yuki / Lawson aside, who would be your outside pick for the Red Bull seat?


Edit: we saw on Drive to Survive that Ricciardo got the nod to replace De Vries based on his testing for Red Bull. If Ricciardo did indeed do enough to score a front row seat in that testing, then he absolutely should have been given the chance to see what he could do for Red Bull just to close any doubts and questions left. ","[""The question is a different one imo - if Red Bull decide Perez is a busted flush, Ricciardo didn't do enough, Lawson's too raw and Tsunoda isn't somebody they deem worthy of the senior team, then what?"", 'No for Liam. Not impressed by him and even if he turns out to be a descent driver in the future, that second RBR seat against Max, is a recipe for disaster for a rookie. He should stay at VCARB and get more experience. The question is though , who would RBR choose? It seems that Yuki is not a candidate , for whatever reason, which only leaves Liam as the only option (assuming they go down the Red Bull drivers program). I wish Hulk was available to be a candidate for (the next year or two) for that seat.', 'Max Verstappen has decided not to be in action during the final test in Abu Dhabi after the season. In addition to the Young Driver Test - for which Verstappen is obviously not eligible - there is also a Pirelli test, but the Dutchman has expressed no interest in that. On behalf of Red Bull Racing, Yuki Tsunoda will be in action.\n\nDuring the test, as mentioned, Yuki Tsunoda will get a chance to show himself to the leadership of the Austrian racing stable. Christian Horner and Helmut Marko are undoubtedly attentive spectators during the test, which could just be an audition for the seat next to Verstappen in 2025.', 'Not really anything conclusive yet. But his substitution races last year flattered him. Happened with De Vries, Colapinto, and Lawson. This year we are seeing his true level against Tsunoda.

Lawson hasn‚Äôt done a single drive that‚Äôs made me think he has raw pace, unfortunately that‚Äôs just the truth. Lacklustre races, nothing special. \n\nCommon theme with these rookies who step in, perform above average first races and then are so overhyped, you start to see that they are mid-tier at best. \n\nYuki should get that seat.', ""Yuki has more experience, try him for one year. Swap if he doesn't deliver."", 'Agreed. It‚Äôs not Lawsons fault but anyone who thought he‚Äôd be ready to go up against Verstappen next year is out of their mind. There‚Äôs also the feedback issue- if as many say Max is so good he ‚Äúdrives through‚Äù problems, then surely RBR want someone who can provide them with good feedback to ensure they‚Äôre hitting targets and avoid another slump like we‚Äôve seen this year, which a rookie just simply couldn‚Äôt give you.\n\nThey either should‚Äôve gone outside of the stable, or put Ricciardo in there after summer. In the end they went for the worst option of all, and now have backed themselves into putting someone that if they were honest with themselves they‚Äôd not really want to in the seat.', ""Good enough for VCARB? Yes.\n\nGood enough for RedBull? More research needed.\n\nPut Yuki in the RedBull for a year and see how he does. Give Liam more time in VCARB to learn the prove himself. Stick or switch as needed.

Red bull, and by red bull I mean horner and helmut are thinking of pulling off another max with the second seat at red bull. In the current grid, they don't see anyone who is both capable like Max and is willing to move to red bull. And they don't want someone good, they want someone like Max, a one in a thousand f1 driver. Until they find such a driver, they are thinking that let's wait for a couple of more seasons and let max be winning and let Perez be doing checo things, which they don't mind much. And when the time is right and a better driver is around, they can pitch him to be the successor for max. I think even if that one in thousand talent do appear right now, they would be reluctant to have him compete against prime max as 2 prime drivers in one team is rarely good.

RBR still win WDC with an amazing car thanks to Max but they don‚Äôt suffer performance deficits and the cycle of other teams catching up to them due to the wind tunnel time loss with the WCC win .Plus checo brings in a lot of money marketing wise so that might balance out the loss of prize money.

1h5b012,Sergio Perez should not be remembered for the past two years. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5b012/sergio_perez_should_not_be_remembered_for_the/,2024-12-03, Discussion,"
Yes, I know it‚Äôs extremely more easy to dunk on Sergio Perez right now, I‚Äôve been extremely guilty of that. The last two seasons (2023 and 2024) have been quite honestly, beyond awful.  But I think people are forgetting just how good Perez was in the midfield for almost a decade before joining Red Bull.

From his debut in 2011 with Sauber, it was clear Checo had talent beyond the normal pay driver. Who can forget his incredible drive to 2nd place in Malaysia 2012, almost beating Fernando Alonso in a vastly inferior car? Or his podiums that season in Canada and Monza? That year put him on the radar of the entire paddock and got him a seat at McLaren in 2013‚Äîa team that, unfortunately, was on the decline.

But after McLaren, he rebuilt his career at Force India/Racing Point, becoming the king of tire management. Perez consistently punched above his weight, dragging those midfield cars to results they had no business achieving. Baku 2016 was absolutely brilliant in my opinion. 

But his victory in Sakhir 2020 was a masterclass in perseverance‚Äîfalling to the back of the grid after an early collision and still winning the race. That win alone cemented his place as one of the most reliable and clever midfield drivers of the 21st century so far.

It‚Äôs sad to see how his time at Red Bull has overshadowed all of that.. But let‚Äôs not forget the Sergio Perez who kept the likes of Force India alive, paid the team members salaries when they went into administration, was renowned for saving tires that not many others could do (Portugal 2021) , and who delivered consistent results year after year when it mattered most.

It feels like people only remember the bad moments and have erased the years of brilliance he brought to F1‚Äôs midfield. Checo deserved his chances in a top team, even if in the end, it hasn‚Äôt worked out the way anyone hoped.

Whatever happens from here, I‚Äôll always respect Sergio Perez for what he achieved before Red Bull. He was the midfield driver of the 2010s, and that‚Äôs a legacy worth remembering.","['Checo and Hulk will always be the two absolute best midfield drivers of the past decade.

His time at Sauber and Force India were brilliant. He was good enough for McLaren at one point. When they were still expected to be good. \n\nBut the theatrics of this year has just soured his legacy so bad.', ""That's why his decline is so egregiously disappointing to me, really - I remember watching those early seasons at Sauber and thinking he had serious potential, definite race winner and maybe even a WDC. I thought the McLaren move was a season too soon though, he needed another year in the midfield before stepping into the pressure of a major team, and unfortunately not only was that true (in my view at least) but he joined them at the absolute worst possible time.\n\nIf you'd told me back then he'd end up at Red Bull I would've expected it to mean he was fighting for the title, and indeed early '22 it looked like he might have been, even in these recent years he kept a bit of a reputation for his brilliance around street circuits, it just makes it all the more dismal how far he's fallen, and how fast.

I wanted to actually introduce a proper discussion on this using facts and comparing to the highly rated Piastri.

Context: 
Yuki: started as a rookie against Gasly (GP2 winner) in 2021 and 2022. Gasly was in his 5th year in F1 (actually 4.5 years)

Piastri: started as a a rookie against Norris (P2 in F2) in 2023 and 2024 after considerable testing with Alpine. Norris was also in his 5th year in F1.

Comparative head to head stats:

H2H: Gasly Tsunoda in 2 years Race: 30-13 Quali: 33-10

H2H Piastri Norris in 2 years Race: 32-13 Quali: 35-10

Any reasonable commentator would acknowledge that it‚Äôs difficult to say whether Norris or Gasly is stronger. 

It seems unreasonable that Piastri should be given a pass for being a rookie against Norris and underperforming, while Tsunoda carries his record against Gasly through his career.

P.S. The real issue here is lack of rookie testing that made Hamilton so successful in 2007.

# The Formation Lap

Now let‚Äôs get down to business‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# The Qatar Grand Prix



***Sprint Qualifying / Sprint Race:***

P1. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri

P2. George Russell / Lando Norris

P3. Oscar Piastri / George Russell



**Qualifying / Grand Prix:**

P1. George Russell / Max Verstappen

P2. Max Verstappen / Charles Leclerc

P3. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri



***Throttle & Tread‚Äôs Reaction:***

When you remove the order-jumbling facilitated by the FIA‚Äôs exceptionally poor handling of Albon‚Äôs discharged mirror into T1 (which could have been swiftly dealt with in a lap or two by a VSC) and the sudden resurgence of drive-through penalties, not much went on in this race. However, who doesn't love a little chaos, albeit controversial? Especially when the end result brings some stakes to Abu Dhabi.

***Personal highlights from Lusail include:***

* Zhou‚Äôs‚Äîand Sauberaudi‚Äôs‚Äîfirst points of the year!
* Valterri Bottas elevating himself from 23rd in the WDC
* Pierre Gasly continuing his strong run of form with a solid P5
* Ferrari keeping their WDC hopes alive (with a little help from Lando)
* Lewis‚Äôs absolute rollercoaster of a race: *He dropped 4 positions at the start, picked up a 5 second penalty, asked if the car was broken, got a puncture, pitted, received a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane, pitted, asked to retire, was told to stay out‚Äîthen told to retire, decided to stay out this time, then closed a 12 second gap, gained 3 positions, and finished in P12.*

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

*Welp, I can‚Äôt say I expected this heap of driver rumblings and rumours to hit the airwaves in Qatar:*

Desire for Young Gun Franco Colapinto has been cooled by his recent run of crashes‚Äîmeaning [his shot at a seat in the Red Bull stable is gooone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4plvs/thomas_maher_franco_colapinto_is_off_the_table/)¬†

So assuming there‚Äôs truth to the growing number of [reports that Checo will be let go and/or offered an ambassadorship role](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4uhiz/perez_red_bull_exit_likely_after_abu_dhabi_f1/) a la Danny Ric once the checkered flag waves in Abu Dhabi, Liam or Yuki will get the ride in 2025.

[Estie Besteban Ocon‚Äôs 2024 season came to an unexpected and premature end](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4raqi/alpine_goodbye_esteban_ocon/) in Qatar, [as a condition for him being able to test with his new team‚ÄîHaas‚Äîafter Abu Dhabi.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4bhsq/the_race_ocon_had_to_give_up_final_alpine_race_to/) In his place, [Jack Doohan will make his debut.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qvmd/alpine_team_statement_jack_doohan_will_race_at/)

And *maybe now* we‚Äôll get an end to the hopeful ‚ÄòMick Schumacher returns to the F1 grid‚Äô articles, [given he‚Äôs chosen to leave his Mercedes role at year's end.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uhjk/mercedes_amg_f1_we_can_confirm_that_mick/)

Speaking of reserve drivers, [Alpine has signed F2 rookie Paul Aron as their 2025 reserve](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h38p21/bwt_alpine_formula_one_team_paul_aron_signs_as/)‚Äîstepping in for Jack Doohan who is graduating to a race seat.

*However, Jacky D might be holding his breath,* [*as there have been rumours over the past couple weeks that Franco Colapinto could scoop that seat out from under him‚Ä¶*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3awow/thomas_maher_the_rumours_of_colapinto_switching/) *Which would be absolutely gut wrenching. We‚Äôll see!*

Departing Formula 1 for the second time, everyone‚Äôs favourite viking, [Kevin Magnussesn, seems set to join the BMW M Team WRT in WEC next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3algi/enduranceinfo_wec_kevin_magnussen_on_course_to/)

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

***The F1 grid‚Äôs most recent addition:***

As they‚Äôve asserted all along, ~~Andretti-~~Cadillac‚Äôs preparation for joining the grid in 2026 continues at pace, [with their latest hiring of former Renault engine tech chief, Rob White.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gznb3i/autosport_andretti_lands_former_renault_f1_engine/) But that‚Äôs not even close to all on the matter‚Ä¶

Thanks to some curious combination of Michael Andretti stepping back from the day-to-day operations, potential legal pressure applied by an American DOJ antitrust investigation, and ‚ÄúAndretti‚Äù¬† being dropped from the name‚Ä¶

The General Motors-supported [Cadillac F1 Team *will* join the grid in 2026.](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/gm-cadillac-2026-f1-team-andretti-absent/)

[So far we know that:](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0ajxt/mario_andretti_reveals_his_plans_for_americas_new/)¬†

1. Their ideal driver lineup consists of a ‚Äúyoung American talent‚Äù (with Colton Herta being the top candidate) and an F1 veteran ([Bottas?](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1yi0n/cadillac_f1_interest_2025_indycar_offer_bottas/)). 
2. The Andretti Global organization is building the chassis and running the race team, with GM being responsible for leading the engine side.  
3. Until said GM engine is ready for 2028, there‚Äôs an interim engine deal with Ferrari in the works for 2026 and 2027.

*Now roll up your sleeves for a few more dashes of drama‚Ä¶*

***Audi‚Äîa project in trouble before rubber meets tarmac:***

Thanks to being blue-balled for years and years‚Ä¶ The F1 fandom at large remains skeptical that Audi will follow through on joining F1, at least until they show up on the grid. And making moves like selling 1/3 of the team to the Qatar Investment Authority won‚Äôt help. However, arrangements like these aren‚Äôt unusual in Formula 1‚Äî*At the very least* Mercedes, Renault, McLaren, Aston Martin, and Cadillac don‚Äôt have full ownership of their teams either.

[More concerning than a partial sale are the rumours that their 2026 engine is behind schedule and they‚Äôre having trouble attracting skilled personnel‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h08try/audi_sells_a_third_of_its_formula_1_team/)

***Hot bananas, the FIA is a roaring dumpster fire right now:***

In yet *another* firing, Race Steward Tim Mayer [warns that the FIA is running out of people to fulfill their responsibilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1wax6/andrew_benson_fired_steward_warns_fia_is_running/)‚Äîalso sharing that he was fired because Doodyhead Sulayem was offended by a right of review document.

Further bringing shame upon the FIA and their frustrating leader, Janette Tan‚Äîpromoted to F2 Race Director just one week or so ago to take over for Rui Marques who was elevated to the F1 role‚Äî[has been let go before she could direct even a single race, with Marques now directing both series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uc7o/fresh_fia_upheaval_as_f2_race_director_janette/)

If you want all the details, my hopefully future friends at The Race penned [this article](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/fia-embarrassing-crisis-deepens-ahead-of-f1-qatar-gp/) catching up on ‚Äòthe FIA‚Äôs embarrassing internal crisis.‚Äô

Unfortunately, MBS‚Äôs shenanigans have continued by [removing two top level FIA bankers from office for questioning him on where money was going‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h2gnoo/top_duo_removed_from_office_after_querying_fia/)

More questions of the FIA‚Äôs competency piled up in Qatar after the poor handling of Albon‚Äôs dismembered mirror was left on track, hit and exploded into smithereens by Valterri Bottas, likely contributing to two punctures‚Ä¶

While there‚Äôs no argument about Lando, Lewis, etc deserving penalties for their infractions, the sudden doling out of stop-and-go and drive-through penalties has left teams and drivers frustrated at the lack of consistency.

*Plus* good ‚Äòol [Doodyhead Sulayem thinks that how he runs the FIA is none of the drivers‚Äô business‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h43xey/ben_sulayem_tells_f1_drivers_how_he_runs_fia_is/) Which seems an awfully silly take to this observer.

In closing, [Toto Wolff thinks the FIA could have its own reality show.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qtun/wolff_fia_could_have_its_own_reality_show_amid/)

# Technical Tidbits

In a classic Certified Alpine Moment, Pierre Gasly‚Äôs engine blew in Vegas due to a combo of DRS, slipstream, and dirty air from Yuki ahead‚Äî[his engine reached 12937 rpm in 8th gear, had enough, and went boom-bang-boom.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzpv8g/fdataanalysis_unbelievable_the_slipstream_made/)

Vasseur rejects the accusations, explaining that the puncture of Carlos Sainz and the subsequent Safety Car changed what were the initial expectations: ‚ÄúThe plan was to return even later, since on one car we did the pit-stop because it had a flat, while on the other because the Safety Car had entered the track. But the initial plan was to return even later. I think we will discuss the history of the VSC for a long time before or not, but the plan was to last longer and the reason for Carlos‚Äôs drilling is only the debris, not the excessive degradation‚Äù.\n\nThe Ferrari team principal believes that even in these conditions the drivers performed everything at their best: ‚ÄúThe initial conduct was too conservative if you know you have a Safety Car on lap 25, but the plan was to go a little longer than that and I think it was the right approach because when we decided to push from lap 12/15 the pace was there and I think we expected to do a long stint. Honestly the initial plan was executed very well by the two drivers and they did a great job‚Äù.\n\n**THE FINAL FLIGHT WITH THE MCLAREN**\n\nThe Qatar GP on paper was the most difficult appointment for Ferrari in this final triptych of races, but the course of the race allowed the Maranello team to shorten on the McLaren on the Manufacturers‚Äô ranking and at the same time Leclerc to arrive at only 8 lengths from Lando Norris. Vasseur underlines the positive surprise of this weekend, promising battle in the final appointment of Abu Dhabi: ‚ÄúWe would have signed before the weekend to score more points than McLaren. We are still alive for the championship and Charles is not far from Norris now. I also think that second place in the overall Pilots‚Äô standings is a good result. I‚Äôd rather have 20 points of advantage than 20 of offset, but let‚Äôs see. On paper I think the next circuit will probably be a little better for us. We fight until the last curve of the last lap‚Äù.\n\nFerrari will show up at Yas Marina with less pressure than McLaren, which instead has everything to lose. Vasseur explained that the Maranello team must continue to focus only on itself, as it has done so far: ‚ÄúIt is not a matter of pressure. The important thing is to do a good job and be fast, then we‚Äôll see. First of all you have to focus on yourself. We managed to make 1-2 on weekends during the season, we have to try to do our best to achieve this goal. But it‚Äôs true that even if we do 1-2, they can be champions. The most important thing is to focus on yourself, don‚Äôt start thinking about what others do. This weekend the approach was very good, because we stayed focused on our strategy without thinking too much about what McLaren or Red Bull were doing. It‚Äôs not said that we‚Äôll be in good shape next week in Abu Dhabi, but we‚Äôll have to put everything together. It‚Äôs always a challenge, but we will enter Abu Dhabi with enormous motivation‚Äù.\n\n**FAR FROM CONTROVERSY**\n\nThe result of the Qatar GP was strongly conditioned by the decisions of the Race Management. Vasseur believes that the discussions on the decisions taken by the stewards are nothing new: ‚ÄúIn the last 35 years of my life we have all always complained about the decision of the stewards and the Race Director. Maybe a little less with Charlie (Whiting) for different reasons. But it‚Äôs always been like that‚Äù.\nThe Ferrari team principal did not want to give a judgment either on the relegation of a position imposed on Max Verstappen on Saturday or on the 10-second stop&go set on Norris on Sunday: ‚ÄúHonestly, I haven‚Äôt even seen Saturday‚Äôs video, but it‚Äôs in the range of penalties to give a penalty position. Same for today, for Lando. It is at their discretion and they can impose this type of penalty. It certainly depends on the severity of the violation, if it was faster than the previous land in that mini sector, but it‚Äôs to allow me to focus on Abu Dhabi that I don‚Äôt want to start making controversy now. I‚Äôve tried to stay away from every single controversy throughout the season, I won‚Äôt start again before the last grand prix‚Äù.\n\nThe French manager also pushed away criticism about the performance of his next driver Lewis Hamilton in the second part of this season: ‚ÄúHamilton? Take a look at the 50 laps he did in Las Vegas starting tenth and finishing in the trail at Russell. I‚Äôm not worried at all‚Äù. The issue of Guanyu Zhou, approached Ferrari as a test driver next season and the protagonist of an excellent performance in Lusail where he finished eighth, was also liquidated in a few words: ‚ÄúZhou had a good race. Congratulations. I didn‚Äôt argue with him, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm focused on my work. But let‚Äôs see, let‚Äôs see in the future‚Äù Vasseur concluded.', 'I am in two minds, I don‚Äôt know if I want Ferrari to win the WCC , or if I want McLaren to lose the WCC.', ""If they'd collected the mirror earlier, Carlos wouldn't have got the puncture.....but Norris wouldn't have had a 10 sec stop/go"", 'Ferrari WCC and Leclerc runner up in the wdc.', 'I did thought that was the plan when Leclerc\'s gap to the front increased fairly quickly and he had Sainz behind on drs for various laps without him saying ""I\'m faster, guys"", it looked a lot like conservative laps.', 'Ferrari always gets screwed over in WCC with no fault of their own. Last year the drain covers and now this', 'Zak Brown reminds me of a sleazy used car salesman. Probably because he‚Äôs American. So, I relate to your dilemma in a big way.', ""For me it's the latter because it would annoy them to no end and will relight the flame to what i hope is an epic restart of the McLaren vs Ferrari rivalry in F1.""]",132,17,0.97,132,15,15,132,17,0.97,132

The gap is 21 points, since McLaren has 640 and Ferrari 619. This is not all the scenarios, but a few to give you a picture of how well Ferrari has to do this weekend, and how bad McLaren has to be. Extra point for fastest lap is not taken into account here, but important not to forget. 

If Ferrari wins the race, a tie on points should also result in win for Ferrari in the constructors due to more wins than McLaren. They are currently tie with 5 wins each. If they end both on tie in points and in number of wins, the number of second places will count, and Mclaren will win constructors.

With regard to Norris' penalty, the FIA has noted that:

¬∑ The penalty was in accordance with the penalty guidelines circulated to the teams on 19 February 2024.

¬∑ A double yellow flag infringement is considered a serious compromise of safety, which is why such offences carry such a severe penalty.

With regard to the wing mirror incident:
¬∑ Normal practice is for the safety car not to be deployed if there is a small amount of debris, ¬†and off the racing line.

¬∑ The extensive debris after a car hit the mirror and the punctures that occurred shortly after forced the decision on a safety car.

¬∑ A VSC would not have been a solution, as the cars remain spread out and there is not sufficient time for a marshal to clear the debris.

¬∑ The FIA constantly reviews its methods and processes and will analyse further the specific scenario, and discuss it with the teams, in order to see whether in the future a different course of action needs to be taken.

Additionally, the FIA has also revealed what happened when the lights on the safety car malfunctioned during the race.

¬∑ During the 2nd safety car period, the lights malfunctioned.

¬∑ All teams were verbally advised that the SC would be coming in, so the re-start took place in the normal fashion.

¬∑ While the reason for the malfunction was identified and fixed, out of caution, the safety car was swapped in time for its 3rd deployment","['> With regard to the wing mirror incident: ¬∑ Normal practice is for the safety car not to be deployed if there is a small amount of debris,  and off the racing line.\n\nFair enough, but it was literally sitting in the ONLY FUCKING OVERTAKING SPOT ON THE TRACK.

However there a number of issues that need to be addressed here. Despite the FIA overseeing all, there are way too many fuck ups. I guarantee there were marshals looking at that mirror thinking ""I could run out there pick it up in a long enough gap in the cars and run back, 20 seconds done"". And this has happened before, hell I've done it.

For those that don't know, you have your standard marshal's in a small team at multiple points around the track and they're lead by a post chief. A group of post chiefs is then lead by an incident chief. The post chief could make a decision to ask a marshal (if they deem it safe) to run out and collect that mirror. Mostly you'll err on the side of caution and not bother, but watching that race there were at least two occasions within 2 laps of that thing being there when a marshal could have easily ran out, picked it up ran clear across the track and would have had 10 seconds or more to spare.

This one wasn't on the marshal though. The main problem is that despite every single race being overseen by the FIA each track seems to have its own rules and it's own way of doing things. And it can be confusing, there is no standard operating proceedure. I would imagine the post chief would have called the incident chief who in turn would have asked the senior race marshal to ask someone at the FIA what to do about the mirror and I can almost guarantee they couldn't get through to anyone. Too many channels to go through to get a decision. Sometimes as marshals we just make the decision ourselves.

What should have happened is if the FIA said for no marshal to go trackside and collect the mirror. They should have called a VSC and then for a marshal to pick it up. It's not hard.

Edit: just to clarify I'm not advocating for a human being to run Infront of 700kgs of carbon death it's just an option that sometimes marshals have made of their own choosing because of a lack of decision making by the powers that be.","['With cameras and screens around the track, why does this need to be \'bottom up\' from the marshal to the FIA rather than \'top down\' with the race director seeing it, directing a VSC/Safety Car and then directing the marshal to go get it?  \n\nSurely F1 has abandoned the idea of \'I\'ll just run out on the track in full race conditions"" years/decades ago.', 'The FIA explanation is that there were no sufficient gaps for a VSC (wich i probably agree with) and that it is ""standart practise"" to not deploy a safety car for a small amount of debris ""off the racing line"".

¬∑ The penalty was in accordance with the penalty guidelines circulated to the teams on 19 February 2024.

¬∑ A double yellow flag infringement is considered a serious compromise of safety, which is why such offences carry such a severe penalty.

With regard to the wing mirror incident:
¬∑ Normal practice is for the safety car not to be deployed if there is a small amount of debris, ¬†and off the racing line.

¬∑ The extensive debris after a car hit the mirror and the punctures that occurred shortly after forced the decision on a safety car.

¬∑ A VSC would not have been a solution, as the cars remain spread out and there is not sufficient time for a marshal to clear the debris.

¬∑ The FIA constantly reviews its methods and processes and will analyse further the specific scenario, and discuss it with the teams, in order to see whether in the future a different course of action needs to be taken.

Additionally, the FIA has also revealed what happened when the lights on the safety car malfunctioned during the race.

¬∑ During the 2nd safety car period, the lights malfunctioned.

¬∑ All teams were verbally advised that the SC would be coming in, so the re-start took place in the normal fashion.

¬∑ While the reason for the malfunction was identified and fixed, out of caution, the safety car was swapped in time for its 3rd deployment.","['I think Palmer said it in f1tv coverage: debris off the racing line but in the only real overtaking zone on the track would always be hit at some point.

Hamilton can also be heard reporting a puncture while on the pit straight well before reaching the point where the mirror was hit by Bottas. (Please note that on driver cams, the radio is out of sync with the video, but you can tell when radio calls are made by watching the driver toggle the radio on their steering wheel.)

The debris appears to mostly fall on the RIGHT side of the track, off the racing line, and both Sainz and Hamilton report front-LEFT punctures. It's possible there was some other debris from when the mirror initially fell off the car, but it seems possible, if not likely, that these punctures were unrelated to the mirror debris.

It's also McLaren's first time winning it (and the first time a team other than Ferrari, Red Bull or Mercedes has won it since its introduction in 2007). 
 
**How did Norris win?**

Going into the race, Norris was leading the contest with 5 fastest laps (FL) to his name, followed by Verstappen and Leclerc tied in second place with 3 FLs each. Leclerc was already out of contention because of tiebreakers (second most fastest laps, then third fastest laps if needed and so on). With Norris setting the FL in Lusail, it's now mathematically impossible for Verstappen to match Norris' tally and hope to win on countback.

**Previous Fastest Lap Award Winners**

- 2022: Max Verstappen
- 2021: Lewis Hamilton
- 2020: Lewis Hamilton
- 2019: Lewis Hamilton

**Random facts and stats about the Fastest Lap Award**

- The FLA was won on countback 4 times: R√§ikk√∂nen over Massa in 2007, Vettel over Webber in 2009, Alonso over Hamilton in 2010 and Hamilton over Verstappen in 2021.

- 2010 was the only season in which the team with the most fastest laps didn't win the FLA (Alonso won it on countback over Hamilton, but McLaren had 6 fastest laps in total to Ferrari's 5). 

- Mercedes holds the records for most FLA wins (8), most consecutive FLA wins (8) and most consecutive fastest laps in a single season (7, set in 2014 between the British GP and the Japanese GP).

- 88% of the teams fielding the FLA winner have also won the Constructors' Championship the same season (exceptions being Brawn in 2009 and Red Bull in 2010). 

- 61% of the drivers who have won the FLA also won the Drivers' Championship the same season (exception being 2008, 2009,2010,2011,2018,2021 and 2024). 

- In 2008, Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen and Ferrari set the following FLA records:

Most fastest laps by a driver in a single season (10)

Highest % of fastest laps by a driver in a single season (55%, 10/18 races)

Most consecutive races with the fastest lap by a single driver (6) 

Most fastest laps by a team in single season (13)

Highest % of fastest laps by a team in a single season (72%,13/18 races)

Everyone always gets an reprimand for this. Even Checo got one yesterday. 1 place grid penalty is practically unheard of. Half of the grid violating starting procedures and endagering marshals and Stroll did not give out penalty points/grid drops but this incident does?  

Even the document clearly says GR wasn't on push lap and he could see Verstappen and it's on him to overtake safely if he wants to start his lap ahead of him.  

People get noted for this all the time. As long as they had another car in front (which Verstappen did), this doesn't even go to reprimand. In Brazil, 17 cars were noted for driving slowly in prep laps, ffs.  

What sort of precedent is this? You can just taillight to the car in front and saying ""Crikey. That's dangerous"" and the driver who is just driving and prepping for his push lap is now gonna get penalised no matter what?

""I did look into the whole thing and it appears that the steward (Garry Connelly) met Paddy Lowe of Mercedes in the Paddock a couple of hours after the race was finished. Lowe seems to have expressed some frustration that Verstappen had not been penalised. Verstappen was spoken to by the stewards after the race, but in an unofficial manner. He then departed the track.

And even if there is a clear guideline, stewards can do anything to bend the rules to their liking, such as in this case.\n\nI know it's difficult to reassess the entire stewarding system, but I think a start would be to have a restriction for stewards with the same nationality as any of the drivers on the grid.

Obviously, Pulling and Pin would probably survive in a higher series or an open one in general, given that pulling does have some experience in British F4 and Pin even managed a podium in WEC which is quite impressive, but what about the rest of the grid? I'm assuming the ones with no points would probably also flounder in F4 regional, but do the top 5 or top 10 have a good shot at podiums in weaker f4 regionals, or even F3/F2 for drivers such as pulling and pin.

Furthermore, how do they stack up to actual F1/F2 drivers. Does someone like Bianca Bustamante actually have the skill to backup mocking actual f1 drivers like Lance Stroll, or would Lance Stroll in a wig lap every single f1 academy driver comfortably without breaking a sweat in equivalent machinery over a full grand prix length. Would a talented F3 rookie, like Piastri in his F3 years be able to smoke the girls even?

there is now a proposal for the President and Deputy-Presidents to be paid salaries. While I think it is a good idea in principle ... the problem is that getting a salary is actually against the ... Association Loi of 1901 which exists for non-profit entities in France.

This is a problem that Max Mosley ran into years ago when he tried to move the FIA to Switzerland and subsequently received a tax demand from the French government  ... Today the FIA remains under French law because it does not want to settle a tax bill and leave. However, there is a Swiss version of the federation as well. The two FIAs have consolidated accounts, but they are run under different sets of laws.

This .. worked fine until the President tried to claim expenses for his own private jet from the French FIA. He does not need the money (he comes from a mega-wealthy family) but he wanted to use the money to establish a fund that would be distributed to small FIA clubs around the world which struggle to pay their bills. ... it was pointed out that this scheme might be misinterpreted when there was an election ... as a way to buy votes ... 

...the audit committee questioned the idea and since then several of them, including the president Bertrand Badre and Britain‚Äôs Tom Purves, are no longer involved. This may also be why there have been changes on the ethics committee as well, and the reason that the compliance officer has just departed.

so many FIA people have left during Ben Sulayem‚Äôs presidency that they could all get together and organise conferences to discuss their stories. The latest to go, I am told, are two stewards: Tim Mayer of the US and Singapore‚Äôs Janette Tan. They follow the recently despatched F1 Race Director Niels Wittich and a lot of others, some of which have been reported upon and others who have not.","['I was under the impression that the President was entitled to remuneration:\n\n7.4 The President of the Senate, the Deputy President for Automobile Mobility and Tourism and the Deputy President for Sport may be entitled to remuneration within the framework of the performance of their elected mandate.

I honestly think if you could put Bottas in for a one year contract until Red Bull decide on a younger driver, that might be the best option. 

As others have said, Bottas is a very capable driver, but with minimal ego.  He would probably be a great support for Verstappen without getting in his way.  

The fact that Bottas could keep in sight of Hamilton (and sometimes outqualifying him) when Hamilton was at the peek of his performance speaks volumes at what an underrated driver Bottas is.  

Just wondering what others think.

F1 doesn‚Äôt have promotion or relegation, so that‚Äôs one point in favor of introducing drafts.

Here‚Äôs how I think it could work: Instead of F1 teams having their own academies, we‚Äôd put the financial strain on F2 teams. Their whole goal would be to get their top talent drafted by an F1 team. The F1 teams would have to pay the F2 teams for their drivers, so the F2 teams could fund academies and support drivers early in their careers‚Äîor just employ a pay driver to keep the bills paid when talent is low.

Also, no clue whether the worst teams should get the first pick or the last. What do you guys think would be most fair for the sport and the drivers?

Again, this was just a random idea to theorize about.","['Oh brother', 'What if there aren‚Äôt open seats?', ""My favourite part of Formula 1 is when there is no formula. Adding structure and rules like this solving a problem by adding hurdles and schemes and eventually more problems.\n\n\nTeams from F2 on down should not be strained and trying to make constant elevators for a volume of drivers that will not make it. Especially in years when there is no change at the top level of the sport. F1 is not notoriously a turnover industry. Alonso has danced with a number of trams for nearly 20 years. Add into the mix of Hulk, Perez, Bottas, Magnussen, Ocon, Sainz, and Ricciardo that have all been about for nearly a decade. It's not that they exited the sport, but rather rewoven into new teams many times. Sure, eventually all drivers are cut or retire for good, but it's not like all 20 drivers turnover in 3 years. We are going to have Max, Lando, Leclerc, Piastri, Russell for a while. Stroll is going to cling. Albon is present. Hamilton is present. Yuki is present.\n\n\nWe probably get a strong rotation of drivers within two years, but it will go back to regular faces holding seats for a decade.\n\n\nAnd it is still very enjoyable. They are amazing."", ""What happens when there aren't f1 seats open, and you do realize f2 is already 90% billionaire kids and 10% f1 driver academy kids, yours would make it 100% billionaire kids, and less f2 teams because there's less money being piped in."", ""Why?

Now every driver is free to agree with any team."", ""See, these things work in most American sports largely because the college system pays for itself either by tickets, donors, and even government money. So professional leagues get to draft from the very healthy college systems. \n\nF2 doesn't make a lot of money. Probably more now than it used to. A few name sponsors like Lucas Oil have come in. But mostly it's funded by the drivers. And some of those drivers are funded by F1 teams.\n\nIn every draft I'm familiar with, worst team picks first, or there's a lottery among the worst half of teams, with the worst teams getting more of a chance, if they don't want teams tanking to get a good pick."", 'The left over drivers go back to the driver processor plant to be refurbished', '2014 Ferrari was certainly a tram!', 'so you‚Äôre saying we need relegation?']",0,16,0.16,0,15,15,0,16,0.16,0

We still have two races to go, we are going to push until the chequered flag in Abu Dhabi and try to maximise what we have. Of course, it wasn‚Äôt ideal in the last two races.

‚ÄúThere were five great races, the ones before, and two that we struggled. In Vegas I was feeling very good, very confident with the car, I was doing good laps in qualifying and unfortunately that last run in Q2 was very messy.

‚ÄúIn Vegas I was very cautious in FP1/2/3 and then in qualifying you have to push the limits and you have to get close to the walls. This is what we do, and you have to take the risks. Unfortunately it went a little bit too much, but it‚Äôs part of motorsport and it happens.

‚ÄúThere are always these things happening and they are around your head when there are not enough spares and the team is doing a very big effort to arrive with the parts for the two cars.

1h1y0bh,How bad is Perez doing right now? Comparisons with Gasly and Albon‚Äôs final 10 results for Red Bull.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1y0bh/how_bad_is_perez_doing_right_now_comparisons_with/,2024-11-28, Statistics,"10 races was the number used as Gasly has 10 race finishes in Red Bull - in order to minimise swings in his relatively small dataset, the most recent 10 results from each driver were used (so most recent 10 finished races, with DNFs - both classified and not - excluded, along with exclusion of Gasly‚Äôs DSQ in China 2019 Qualy). Where a result is excluded the next most recent race is added to the dataset (so in exchange for excluding Perez‚Äôs COTA DNF, we count back and include Silverstone as our 10th)

Qualifying results are the top table, as you can see Albon has the highest average qualifying results with Gasly not far behind. Perez lags behind significantly.

In terms of race results, Gasly has the best average placement and scored the most consistently, though crucially Albon got two podiums in this period. Again, Perez lags behind.

 Race start numbers for each driver being assessed are:

* Gasly - 27-39 (Australia - Hungary 2019)
* Albon - 28 - 39 (Belgium - Abu Dhabi 2020)
* Perez - 271-283 (Silverstone - Las Vegas 2024)

As you see, Gasly and Albon‚Äôs level of F1 experience is well matched during these periods. Perez is significantly more experienced than both.

Points totals in these periods (excluding sprints as these didn‚Äôt exist in Gasly or Albon‚Äôs tenure) are -

* Gasly - 63 (2x FL)
* Albon - 65
* Perez - 33 (1x FL)

So again, Perez is lagging behind both Gasly and Albon.

All 3 stints were done in cars which were clear of the midfield cars behind them. The Red Bull was 3rd best in the grid at the time Gasly drove it, 2nd best at the time Albon drove it, and has swung a little while Perez has but we can be conservative and say 3rd best. All three cars were certainly good enough to make it to Q3.

During the assessed periods Max scored:

* With Gasly - 4 podiums (2x P1, 2x P3)
* With Albon - 5 podiums (1x P1, 3x P2, 1xP3)
* With Perez - 5 podiums (1x P1, 3x P2, 1x P3)

So all cars were at points capable of a win, and certainly capable of podiums.

Based on this I would say that Perez‚Äôs recent form is the worst of the three stints. ","['Babe wake up, Daily Checo thread has been posted!', ""I think a better comparison would be P√©rez's performances against Verstappen since the cars' relative performance against their contemporary grid differs.

1h1i3r4,VERY interesting couple of years coming up,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1i3r4/very_interesting_couple_of_years_coming_up/,2024-11-27, Discussion,"Honestly,  
The next couple of years are going to be very spicy on and off the track.

**2025:**  
  
\- **McLaren** should be right out of the gate fighting for both championships  
  
\- **Ferrari** are coming good, if they do not do their between season mess up of car changes they should also be right there. Here is hoping they fix their core ""Ferrari"" problem which always seems to cost them during the season. Just seeing Lewis in Red is going to get a lot of headlines and those merch sales are going to crazy. Will he be competitive and how is Leclerc going to handle that mentally?  
  
\- **Red Bull:** Who will be driver 2. I honestly can not see Perez fixing his issues. It has been 2 years and the only reason to keep him would be the money being pumped in to Red Bull to keep him. Red Bull also continues is self implosion progress with the in fighting and issues so I expect we see more from that.  


\- **Mercedes**: New young driver, how will he get on and are they finally on the path to also be right up there? With 4 genuinely competitive teams on the cards next season this is going to be amazing for us fans.

\- **FIA:**  I can not see anything but them continue to be a mess. I do not see any possibility of real improvement unless they again have a new CEO and do real effective changes like paying for permanent consistent stewards using the same technology every single race.  


**2026:**  
The new new regulations for me kind of say ""Yeah the big change we said would be amazing, did not really work so we trying again"".  
As many would agree I am happy to see the cars ARE getting smaller, it is not much but for me its been one of the bigger issues with the racing with just the sheer size of the modern cars.  
I am not confident on the new aerodynamic concepts for 2026 and I am a little worried we continue down a path of F1 cars all looking to much the same and I hope that will not be the case.  
In the efforts to track more manufactures though it does look like it may be another era of engine dependance so it may be down to who nails the new engines. Mercedes have indicated they are quietly confident along with Ferrari. Red Bull do not seem to be so with all the complaints they have around it.

2026 should also bring 2 more cars on the track with a new team and it will be interesting to see how that all pans out.  
It does mean 2 more drivers on the track and with it being a very US focused team I am sure at least 1 of these would be an American driver. Who would that be, who has the super license to be able to drive?","['One season is not predictive of the next one.

Not a perfect predictor, but it's something.

From the top 3 teams, I swapped driver pairings for the season so far. So each driver beats their team mates for each given race, but their results are that of their corresponding finisher in the other team

This does not account for a driver making the differences. What it does is assume that 2 team cars will finish where they did, butplugs drivers beating or losing to the teammate into those 2 cars in those same races. I used Bearmans Ferrari points in calculations and pretended Sainz didn't lose his appendix for my situations.

So, with all of these what it's, and making a lot of assumptions and guesses, bad luck inheriting someone else's dnfs or Perez finishes (sorry Checo), I have 2 conclusions I came to

Max is probably your WDC favorite in a McLaren or Ferrari this year as well, with the caviet he has the same teammate disparity

Scenario 4, with Max at Ferrari, Norris at Red Bull, and Leclerc at McLaren is our best timeline from a sporting entertainment value. WDC not yet clinched, and an even closer fight for P2!

At the centre of it all: Cadillac and Audi.*\n\nSomething is happening in the premier league of motor racing that could plunge Formula One into a crisis. Malicious tongues are wagging: Audi is leaving before they arrive. And GM is coming, even though the 'kingmakers' were initially reluctant to let the US company and its partner Andretti into their autocratically run 'golden cage'.\n\nSpeaking of the four rings: just in time for this weekend's Qatar GP, F1 insiders have learned that there will be official confirmation that Audi will sell parts of the team it bought from Sauber in March for 650 million euros. The buyer is rumored to be Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.\n\n**Is Audi selling shares to Qatar?**\n\nThis is fitting: Qatar is already a major investor in Audi's troubled parent company VW. Qatar Holding LLC owns 17% of the shares in Wolfsburg, making it the third-largest shareholder after Porsche (53.3%) and Lower Saxony (20%).\n\nAudi bosses are expected to sell the deal as a profitable investment in the future. Behind the scenes, however, there is talk of window-dressing. Instead of investing the money in keeping jobs in Germany, the oil dollars will be used to finance the company's own engine, which is due to be launched in 2026.\n\nBackground: Audi's parent company Volkswagen has been in a deep crisis for weeks. Three out of ten German plants are to be closed, tens of thousands of employees made redundant and wages cut by up to 18%.\n\nThe F1 project has not escaped unscathed. It is questionable whether Audi will continue to run the team, which is bottom of the Constructors' Championship with zero points this season. F1 Insider understands: ‚ÄúThe supervisory board in Wolfsburg is still considering pulling out of F1 altogether.‚Äù\n\nAs far as GM is concerned, it was a foregone conclusion that the F1 organizers would relent and allow an eleventh team to compete in the premier class. But the U-turn was not voluntary. The threats of the US judicial authorities to punish Liberty Media for serious violations of US antitrust law have finally borne fruit.\n\n**2 billion dollars fine on the cards**\n\nF1 insiders know how much was on the table as a fine: two billion dollars. To avoid this financial disaster, Liberty boss John Malone has now pulled the trigger. But he had to make sacrifices.\n\nOne of those sacrifices was to allow the entry that his managers and some team principals had arbitrarily and illegally prevented. For months the Andretti motorsport dynasty, led by Michael Andretti, fought for entry to the premier league. In vain. Although the FIA gave the green light, Liberty and some other teams refused. Until the US Congress took up the matter and investigated.\n\nThe ominous press release from the marketer shows that the announcement was made under pressure from the F1 organizers. Formula One is pleased to announce that an agreement in principle has been reached with General Motors to integrate Cadillac as the eleventh team in the series from the 2026 season. No further details were given.\n\nBut the GM approval compromise was not the only one Malone had to make. US investigators also wanted to see heads roll. Liberty CEO Greg Maffei announced his resignation at the end of the year. His successor will be Ren√©e Wilm - currently promoter of the Las Vegas GP and chief legal officer of Malone's media group. The American with Dutch roots is expected to make Formula One more transparent and put an end to unfair cronyism.\n\nRumors have been circulating for some time that F1 chief Stefano Domenicali may also be on his way out. Although F1 denies this, McLaren CEO Zak Brown has been touted as his successor in the Las Vegas paddock. He is close friends with the Andretti clan and is said to have been a key source in the US Department of Justice investigation."", 'I almost wish they punished them with that fine.

-However they can't break their own record for average points per race (32.6pts/race set in 2020).

In 2017, after a three-season stint in Indy Lights yielding him four wins and a best of third in the standings, Zach Veach was looking for an IndyCar ride, but several chances were missed, mainly thanks to a lack of funding. That issue was resolved though, when he visited a church in April of that year. Veach asked his pastor, Aaron Brockett, if he had any contacts that could help him fund an IndyCar ride. The pastor new such a person, namely Dan Towriss. Towriss, the head of financial services firm Guggenheim Partners at the time, helped Veach find a ride at AJ Foyt Racing for the 2017 Indianapolis 500, backed by Group One Thousand One, an insurance group.

[More on how the deal between Veach and Towriss took place.](https://eu.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/2017/09/19/how-pastor-played-part-zach-veachs-indycar-deal-andretti-autosport/672681001/)

Veach retired at that race after a mechanical issue, but that performance, along with his junior formula results and his new backer, helped him sign a three-year deal at one of the championship's top teams, Andretti Autosport, driving the No. 26 car, sponsored by Group 1001, as well as Gainbridge, a subsidiary of the former. 

Despite the promise shown though, Veach was unable to consistently show up at the front, scoring three top five finishes over the course of those three seasons. The partnership ended prematurely, three races before the conclusion of the third year of the partnership. Interestingly though, Gainbridge and Group 1001 stayed at the team, fielding James Hinchcliffe for the rest of the season and announcing a new driver for 2021. That new driver was an exciting young prospect by the name of Colton Herta.

Herta already belonged in the Andretti family, through Harding Steinbrenner Racing, which collaborated with Andretti in 2020 and helped Herta finish third in the championship that season. 

With Herta in the No. 26 Gainbridge Andretti car, the partnership between the team and the sponsor blossomed. Herta was performing impressibly, albeit a little bit inconsistently, and was even heavily rumored to make the switch to Formula 1 with Alpha Tauri. This season marked the best one for Herta, who was able to finish second in the standings, only behind Alex Palou. Gainbridge has become the primary backer of the team, especially since it lost its long-standing partnership with DHL last year. Group 1001 has a second company sponsoring another car, the No. 28 Delaware Life of Marcus Ericsson.

With that, Andretti and Group 1001 expanded their partnership, first with Spire Motorsports in NASCAR. Gainbridge would help sponsor both Cup entries for Spire, while Group 1001 would sponsor the team's Truck Series entry in select races, where it would be driven by Marco Andretti, the son of Michael. They have also entered a partnership with Wayne Taylor Racing in IMSA.

Andretti started its efforts to join Formula 1 back in 2023 and in November of that year, announced its partnership with General Motors in order to achieve that goal. In October of 2024, Michael Andretti stepped back from daily operations of Andretti. The man who took over the reigns was none other than Dan Towriss, who owns a large ownership stake in the team and has invested heavily in its facilities.

1h0kk2y,Simple analysis - How much does Max owe 2024 WDC to RBR Dominant Start?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0kk2y/simple_analysis_how_much_does_max_owe_2024_wdc_to/,2024-11-26, Statistics,"There's been lots of statements flying around such as ""Max won WDC24 without the fastest car"".

With recency bias it feels that way, however its eye opening to look back at the beginning of the season and how dominant the RedBull was (first 7 races). So much so that we had Perez finishing 2nd / Podium. This level of dominance had no close challengers over this period. Effectively free points for RedBull + Max.

With this in mind I wondered what the championship table would look like based on two different scenarios:

1. If Mercedes were the ones to have a 7-race dominant car at the beginning of the season - For this I swapped the RedBull drivers finishing positions with the RedBull drivers for the first 7 races as follows; where Lewis finished ahead of George I would put him as the first Redbull and George as the second RedBull, and vice versa. However when populating the Mercedes cars I always put Max as the higher finisher.
2. Same as point 1 but for Ferrari.

The output:

**Scenario 1**

||
||
|Lando Norris|340|
|Charles Leclerc|319|
|Lewis Hamilton|304|
|Max Verstappen|302|
|George Russell|280|
|Oscar Piastri|268|
|Carlos Sainz|259|

**Scenario 2**

||
||
|Charles Leclerc|365|
|Max Verstappen|359|
|Lando Norris|340|
|Oscar Piastri|268|
|Carlos Sainz|267|
|George Russell|217|
|Lewis Hamilton|208|

There's no point in doing a McLaren swap for the first 7 races because this would clearly just result in a Lando P1 by a decent stretch.

So all scenarios point to the fact that - while Max didn't have the fastest car **all** season - He ultimately does owe his WDC24 to having a vastly dominant car earlier in the season.

Put another way, Max essentially had a 50pt (to Charles) and 60pt (to Norris) starting advantage heading into a 17 race season. You take that away and give the corresponding advantage to each of those drivers and they both take the WDC win.","['by your own definition of dominance which is ""Perez finishing 2nd / Podium"" its not 7 races\n\ndo tell me about dominant red bull in Miami and Imola \n\nso dominant in Miami that Max couldnt shake off Piastri with half upgrades while Lando had no problem gapping Max\n\nso dominant in Imola that Max needed a tow from Hulk otherwise it would have quite possibly been a MCL front row (bar Oscars penalty) and in the race was fighting for his life when Lando was on his ass for like 15 laps in the end \n\nby your own definition of dominance which is ""Perez finishing 2nd / Podium"" red bull was dominant for exactly 4 races', ""Or just start counting championship from Monaco (8th race) and you can see the results, instead of your weird calculating, so since Monaco:  \n- Verstappen got 242 points.  \n- Lando got 239 points.  \n- Leclerc got 206 points.   \nSo I wouldn't call it just the car.

I don't dispute his ability or achievements and that he was one of the greats, but something about the continued use of the Senna logo and references to him seem to be unbalanced in my own opinion.

By unbalanced, I barely hear any reference to Michael Schumacher these days. A seven-time world champion who suffered a life-altering accident, who is arguably one of the best drivers of all time.

What I find (rather opinionated I know) is that Senna's legacy is abused somewhat.

Will it take a similar form when Schumacher passes?","['He died on track.', 'Cause he died while racing and media has been pushing this ""idolization"" every year.

This inspired me to analyze which races each of the top teams were competitive in, which races they dominated, and which races they were far off the pace.

Please note that this list is far from perfect. My analysis is based solely on timings. I have defined a team dominating a race as achieving a margin in the high teens or greater. And a competitive race as one where the nearest rival finishes within 10 seconds. 


Additionally, this analysis focuses only on the gaps between the top four teams. Winning margins by other teams, such as in races like S√£o Paulo, have been excluded.

Of course, there are many factors beyond just timings that influence performance. I would greatly appreciate any additional insights or details that might have been overlooked.

Let's get started:

**1/3 Races dominated**

Redbull

*  3 races: Bahrain (won by 25s) Saudi Arabia (won by 18s) Japan (won by 20s) 

McLaren

* 3 races: Hungary (won by 14s) Dutch (won by 22s) Singapore (won by 20s)

Ferrari

* 1 race: USA (won by 19s)

**2/3 Competitive races (a close win or close to winning)**


McLaren:

* 10 races: Australia (lost by +5s) Miami (won +7s) Emilia (lost +0.7s) Canada (lost +3s) Spanish (lost +2s) Austria (won 1s) British (lost +7s) Belgium (lost +0.6s) Italian (lost +2s) Mexican (lost +4s)

RedBull 

* 6 races: Miami (lost by +7s) Emilia (won 0.7s)  Canada (won 3s) Spanish (won 2s) Austria (lost +37s - but was leading and got involved in a collision) British (lost +1s) Belgian (+8s)

Ferrari:

* 5 races: Miami (lost by +9s) Emilia (lost +7s) Belgian (lost +8s) Italian (won 2s) Mexican (won +4s)

**3/3 Uncompetitive races (team is far off the race pace)**

Ferrari

* 10 races: Bahrain (lost by +25s) Saudi Arabia (lost +18s) Japan (lost +20s) China (lost +23s) Canada (double retirement) Spain (lost +22s) Britain (lost +47s) Hungary (lost +19s) Dutch (lost +25s) Singapore (lost >1 min)

Redbull

* 8 races: Hungary (lost by +21s) Dutch (lost +22s) Italian (lost +37s) Azerbaijan (lost >1 min) Singapore (lost +20s) USA (lost +19s) Mexican (lost +59s) Las Vegas (lost 16s)

McLaren:

* 5 races: Bahrain (lost by +48s) Saudi Arabia (lost +32s) Japanese (lost +29s) Brazil (lost +31s) USA (lost +20s) Las Vegas (lost +43s)


Note: I haven't included Austria as Lando and Max were leading by over 15s before their collision on lap 65. And I haven't included Sao Paulo as it was wet and there was a lot of chaos


**Conclusion**

* McLaren were competitive in 10 races and dominated in 3 races. **Total of 13/22 races**


* RedBull were competitive in 6 races and dominated in 3 races. **Total 9/22 races**

* Ferrari were competitive in 5 races and dominated in 1 race: **Total 6/22 races**

He had more top 5 finishes than Lando this year (Lando just had more P1 or P2 to gain a points advantage) which demonstrates more consistency, he‚Äôs had moments of pure brilliance that I haven‚Äôt seen with Lando, and many of his poorer finishes were due to team strategy and other factors.

1gzqsgt,How Colton Herta is personally linked to Cadillac/General Motors' F1 entry and how he can obtain a FIA Super License to race in F1 as early as next week.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzqsgt/how_colton_herta_is_personally_linked_to/,2024-11-25, Discussion,"**The first question may be ""*why Colton Herta specifically for Cadillac F1?*"".**

Colton Herta is a current Andretti driver, he is American, he's fast and he's a fan favorite in IndyCar. But this is not all.

Colton is personally sponsored by a big insurance group called Group 1001 and he is one of their biggest ambassadors. His IndyCar is infact sponsored by Group 1001 and Gainbridge (a Group 1001 company)

Colton got this sponsorship via Dan Towriss, the CEO of Group 1001. Dan is a big personal supporter of Colton.

This circles back to Cadillac F1 as Dan Towriss has also recently become Andretti Global's CEO after the sidelining of Michael Andretti, and he's now the lead figure behind the General Motors entry in F1.

American driver on american car would be pretty big for marketing reasons, and Colton also combines this with natural speed (never fully exploited in IndyCar) and a personal connection to a soon-to-be F1 ""team owner"".

**How close is Colton Herta to obtaining a FIA Super License?**

Colton currently has 39 points, 1 short of the 40 points needed to obtain a Super License, thanks to the special COVID-19 exception that allows drivers to count their best 3 championship placements of the last 4 years, as long as 2021 is one of those years.

* 2021 - 8 pt (5th in IndyCar)

* 2022 or 2023 - 1pt (10th in IndyCar)

* 2024 - 30 pt (2nd in IndyCar)

**How can Colton get the necessary points for a super license ahead of the 2026 season?**

There are actually a lot of ways, I will list a few:

- Taking part in a single FP1 session in the next 2 F1 weekend, he would gain precisely 1 point.

This is unlikely. With only 2 races to go and a Sprint Race in Qatar, the only chance would be Abu Dhabi, but with such short notice it's hard to imagine this being possible.

If Colton does not get it this year, then a problem arises: entering the 2025 season the COVID-19 exception would expire and he would find himself with 31 points (1 pt from 2023, 30 pt from 2024). He would lack 9 points that can obtained in the following ways:

- Finishing 4th in IndyCar he would get 10 points. IndyCar is hard and extremely unpredictable. A bunch of unfortunate crashes can make the difference between finishing 3rd or 9th in the final standings, so this is risky.

- Completing 9 F1 FP1 sessions regardless of IndyCar placement would also guarantee him enough points. A driver can collect up to 10 points by doing 10 different FP1 sessions. IndyCar and F1 however often clash, getting all this seat time is very expensive and it's doubtful there are even this many FP1 sessions available to buy from other teams.

- The most realistic scenario then becomes a mix of the above. For example finishing 7th in IndyCar and doing 5 FP1 sessions would be enough and logistically easier to coordinate.

- There is also the possibility of competing in more a series in a single year: a driver can also get points for multiple (2) championship in a single calendar year, and the FIA ladder has multiple ""farmable"" championship in the off-season. The *Asian Le Mans Series* for example is a 3 events endurance championship held between December/February that gives 10/8/6/4/2 points. All seats are filled in LMP1 for the first weekend, but maybe they can be bought out.

Overall there are many ways, some more convoluted than others and some riskier than others, but it's not unrealistic for Herta to be in the 2026 Cadillac F1 team.","['The FIA could also just grant Herta the same exemption they gave Colapinto, who was also on 39 points, and give him a super license tomorrow.', 'Which F1 team is going to let a rival driver do 5 x FP1 sessions?', ""He just needs to have a good season in 2025 then it sorts itself out. As long as he finishes at least 6th it shouldn't be a problem."", 'This is just a rumour but I‚Äôve read that Williams - Cadillac F1 might get into a deal to let Colton do FP1 in Abu Dhabi on Alex‚Äôs car (since Franco already did FP1 in Silverstone on Logan‚Äôs car). If not Colton then Zak (another American driver part of the academy). This came after someone mentioned Cadiliac/GM was the 4th mysterious team that asked for Colapinto‚Äôs situation long ago.

1gzqpr6,Is it time for a  new points system ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzqpr6/is_it_time_for_a_new_points_system/,2024-11-25, Discussion,"A few months a there were  rumours that the  FIA was considering changes to the points by expanding it to 12 positions by reducing the gaps from 7th--12th to one point, though nothing came out of ir

Now that Cadillac has been confirmed for 2026 , I think it's a good time for the FIA to consider changing the points system . Especially since there was a result just a few weeks back ( Alpine double podium) that exposed the flaws of the current system. Its rewards freak results from weaker teams and punishes their consistency.


I have had a system in mind that would expand points to the top 14. I think that would enough to reward consistency and protect the standings against freak results.  It goes like this

1. 40
2. 30
3. 25
4. 20
5. 17
6. 14
7. 12
8. 10
9. 8
10. 6
11. 4
12. 3
13. 2
14. 1

This points progressively increase the gap for every milestone ( top 10, top5 , podium, win). This system also more else maintains the ratios between two places, atleast within the top 5.

I would also a like a point for pole. I think it's disappointing to see efforts like Magnussen in Brazil 2024 go completely unrewarded and the fact the pole means absolutely nothing at tracks like COTA. Its far fairer than the Fastest lap point and won't matter that much when the winner gets 40 points. The only disadvantage I can think of is that it leaves for the championship to be decided on a Saturday, but let's be real in that scenario the championship was already over before qualifying

The tarmac, heat and many other things do their own part as well.

We don't have a whole lot of data for F1 cars on this circuit, especially not since ground effect came back. I've always likened it a bit to the Bahrain GP in my head except there are pretty much no low speed corners in Qatar wherears there are quite a few at Bahrain. Last year McLaren and Red Bull were much better than anyone else here but the competitive order in similar circuits has somewhat shifted and the top cars all have different strengths and weaknesses now. For example the SF23 probably had to manage like crazy last year with it's tyre gobbling tendency, but this year's car has an opposite problem which could yet be an advantage if they get the set up right.

I for one don't expect McLaren to just outright dominate uncontested, I feel like we could get a similar scenario to what happened at the US GP where McLaren were expected to dominate effortlessly only to end up losing to Ferrari of all the cars. Even the Mercedes credentials looked better than Ferrari before that race. 

If Ferrari outscores McLaren by 15 or more pts, that would surely spice up the WCC and make us Ferrari fans very happy.

With Perez massively underperforming this season the WCC likely won't be achieved, it looks like they'll finish 3rd despite having a very dominant car for the beginning of the season. Max won 7/10 races, with the other placement being P2, P6 and a DNF; Checo had decent placements with 6 Top 5 finishes (4 Podiums) despite 2 DNFs in the first 10 races. Although the placements were ok, the gap to Max was huge even in the beginning of the season. Nevertheless RB didn't replace Checo despite having a history of booting underperfoming drivers - so I wondered what might've icentivized them to not do that this year.

My obvious conlusion are the aero regulations, more precisely the [restricions on wind tunnel and CFD-time](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/how-f1s-new-sliding-scale-aero-testing-rules-work-and-what-impact-they-will.pn0sG8N4A0cjbNRbdYx8a). Assuming RB finishes 3rd, McLaren and Ferrari will have 70% / 75% of the base level wind tunnel / CFD time, whereas RB will have 80%

This gives RB an advantage in development for/during next season. They have a higher chance of being able to field a strong enough car for Max to win the WDC, yet  finish lower than Mclaren/Ferrari/Mercedes in the WCC. 

They're obviously not doing this on purpose but I think they are willing to take that risk.

For other teams this is not a viable strategy but Red Bull isn't a car manufacturer that lays importance on the WCC. RB is in F1 solely for marketing purposes, a WDC is by far the biggest marketing asset in their mind.

RB loses some price money in the process, but Checo also brings in sponsorship money and is a marketing asset in Latin America which might offset their monetary loss.

tldr: RB might be willing to lose the WCC in order to have more development time and therefore a bigger chance of winning the WDC which is their biggest priority.","['The bizarre amount of sponsor money is the only reason he is still in the car', ""I don't know about a couple or multiple things but the one thing that works against them is the bonus which they won't be able to play their employees which makes employees retention much tougher"", 'Because his presences increases sales of red bull cans and his sponsors pay money.

Alain Prost really likes Max Verstappen and has never been reluctant to speak highly of the Dutch driver for L'√âquipe. The French world champion finally agreed to give us his analysis of his 27-year-old counterpart last Sunday. Thirty minutes of Zoom interview that demonstrate the esteem, even admiration, of the 69-year-old former driver for Verstappen.\n\n**Having Verstappen as a neighbor on the prize list. Does that mean anything to you?**\n\n>Yes, sincerely. I am pleased to be in such good company. Because there are only three of us with four titles, but I remember when Michael joined me and when Lewis came through. I will not forget that Fangio was the first driver to win four crowns (the Argentinian champion was crowned a fifth time). All the same, we're among a handful of names who, without sounding presumptuous (he reflects), are out of the ordinary. We're part of history. To be a four-time world champion is a kind of pride. And Max, looking back on his career, can be proud of it. He hasn't stolen any of his crowns. You can have a bit of luck, like me in 1986, but you have to know how to provoke it and then seize it. Max is not missing anything. I remember that in 2016 during his first victory I was commentating for Canal and I promised him a bright future. He didn't disappoint me. What he's already achieved is really impressive. Verstappen is clearly unique. He is not just anyone, whether it's his personality, his character or his commitment. You can love him or hate him, but he certainly doesn't leave you indifferent. Like many great champions, he's atypical.\n\n**This crown, do you think it was the hardest for him to win?**\n\n>Only he can say. I don't know what his car was really worth. (He reflects.) And then we mustn't forget that highly controversial title in 2021. It's still very difficult to have an objective analysis. Frankly, both of them (Hamilton and Verstappen) deserved the title for the whole season. It was Max who won it in the conditions we all know. It was his first crown, and once again he went out and won it. It's always difficult to win your first crown. In fact, I remember very well what I said that evening in Abu Dhabi: from now on we'll see the real Verstappen. And we've seen him since then (he smiles). He's freed himself. He's erased his little mistakes and his impatience. He's become very, very strong. Coming back to this year, he's had to fight hard and I think he's shown some very fine things. A lot of confidence, a lot of serenity. Even when he complains, but he has always done it, he did it with less annoyance. That's the mark of a more accomplished champion.\n\n**You describe an extraordinary champion. Does he have any weaknesses?**\n\n>At the moment, it's hard to find any. I don't know what he'll do in the future, but even in terms of communication, with all the rumours with Mercedes and the worries with Red Bull, I've found him to be very solid‚Ä¶ He's good on all terrains. He's a very tough driver on the track, but you can't see that as a weakness."", 'Thank you for posting the transcript!', 'Prost is simply lovely.', 'Very good insights from a 4x champ to another', ""**So he'll be unbeatable next year?**\n\n>Well, next year is another debate. It will be a rather special year, the last with the current ground-effect car. We've already seen a tightening of performance between different teams. Max's strength is that, in certain races, he can make the difference all by himself. And that's a big advantage for a team, and of course for the Championship. So I'd still put him as favourite next year, but now the other teams know that Red Bull is beatable.\n\n**When Vettel won his fourth crown, you were delighted because you felt he was very close to you in terms of personality. Do you think Verstappen is more on the side of Ayrton Senna?**\n\n>Max has a lot in common with Ayrton, especially at the start of their careers. Today, a little less so. He has his own way of being. He's always followed his own idea, in his own way. That's why, when you get to know him a little, I think he's close to Seb or me. These are things I like about him. On the track, I find him very respectful.\n\n**Very respectful?**\n\n>Yes, in his own way. He's not a cheater. You're going to talk to me about track limits. But it's the way he drives; it's an education. For him, it's the norm. The best proof is that when he's penalized, he accepts it. As always, he goes as far as he can.\n\n**Hamilton fought against Alonso or Nico Rosberg, you against Senna. Do you think he lacks high-level opponents to climb even higher in the collective imagination?**\n\n>Nowadays, it's the rule not to have two drivers of the same level in a team. But Max has had to deal with Ricciardo, Gasly and Perez. After all, they're not just heats! We're talking about Grand Prix winners. You're talking about his popularity. The good thing about Max is that he's free. He doesn't cheat: he's just the way he is, following his thing. Tomorrow, he could tell you that in a month's time he's quitting, and nobody would be surprised! That's him and that's his thing. He certainly cares much less about the image he may have than many other drivers. But I think he'll be remembered as an incredibly talented driver. Very tough, of course, but his four titles are totally deserved and he's right up there at the top.\n\nTranslated via DeepL and Google Translator""]",44,6,1.0,44,5,5,44,6,1.0,44

","['Most of the recent rookies have been decent. Colapinto, Piastri, and Lawson all seem to be doing fine.\n\nThe issue seems to be that there‚Äôs not as much funding for juniors under the academy structure. Red Bull used to fully fund a lot of their juniors so cutting them when they did poorly made sense because they were an expenditure. Raising up Leclerc was a cost to Ferrari as well, same with Russell with Mercedes.\n\n\nBut now sponsorship and finances are huge even in junior categories, so we get a lot of these sponsors driven guys being able to fund 3+ mediocre seasons. Teams have huge junior academies where the drivers are paying them to be associated, not the academy funding the driver. The weeding out of the less talented yet wealthy ones is lessened.', 'Money? The gap F3 F2 to F1 is mega, Moto not so much so everything is more relative and connected. I would think that‚Äôs the only reason', 'F3 is the really beginning in formula motorsport. F2 is more difficult because is the one-way ticket to f1', 'Jesus Christ folks - why do you need to downvote someone who asks a legitimate question without adding a comment?\n\nSo my opinion on your question - the F4 to F3 to F2 to F1 ladder is pretty well designed to increase driver skills in reasonable jumps of car performance (horsepower, aero, things that can be controlled via the steering wheel) and other aspects of racing (tire compounds, pit stops, DRS). \n\nMoney is always a factor, so the junior series‚Äô tend to be Europe heavy for tracks to reduce travel costs. A season in F3 costs about $1M and F2 is about $2.5M. \n\nIt sounds like you don‚Äôt watch much single seater racing. I suggest you check out F3 and F2.

Checo fails to get into Q2. Is his bad performance worth cutting if he brings in 8 digit income through sponsors? Maybe his cash single handedly funds the next RB that Max will use to win another WDC. Maybe Checo finds balance and gets a great race like Baku.

* Pre-race withdrawal is not included (eg. Albon in Brazil) as it‚Äôd make it a pain to distinguish from those who also crashed out in qualy but whose garage managed to repair this in time (eg.

But, I personally wouldn't count it against him if it was a track defect or a clearly very not his fault accident. I don't think teams hold those things against their drivers, so I wouldn't hold it against them, even though the team has to pay for damages. Of course, the team has to pay for mechanical issues too.

With Vettel's 9 win streak to cap off his 2013 win, was he widely considered to continue to win like Max is considered to today?

Then he rejoins the festivities. First, he says: ‚ÄúCould anyone else become champion in this car? I would say: I wish them good luck.‚Äù\n\nThere are emotions, there is relief and, above all, Max Verstappen is happy that it's over. At least, that with two races to go he has secured his fourth championship in a row. An incredible achievement. Especially when you consider that the Red Bull driver did not have the best material for months. He himself estimates that he has not had the fastest car for seventy percent of this season. Still, things are now decided. ‚ÄúI had thought we would have to fight until the last moment, but then luckily the rain came in Brazil. That worked out pretty well,‚Äù Verstappen said, referring to his fabulous victory at Interlagos, which indirectly meant the knockout for rival Lando Norris.\n\n**Proving them wrong**\n\nThe intermediate score, more than three and a half hours after he crossed the finish line in Las Vegas? ‚ÄúI've had four beers now and two gin tonics,‚Äù said Verstappen, now holding a can of Red Bull. ‚ÄúMost of all, I'm pretty relieved. The race wasn't great, but actually a little better than expected. It's nice that it's done now and we can go into the final races in Qatar and Abu Dhabi reasonably relaxed. There I still want to get some nice results.‚Äù By then he has already wittily taken revenge on McLaren boss Zak Brown, by rubbing his nose in his face that he can also become world champion in a non-dominant car. Referring to earlier statements by the American about Verstappen's titles in 2022 and 2023. ‚ÄúSuch things only motivate me. **If people are critical and think that I can only win in the best car, I prove them wrong. If I don't get credit for this now, I don't know what else I can do. Whether I would have become champion in the McLaren? Yes! And much sooner too. In 2021 in another car (the Mercedes, ed.) I would have taken the title as well. In 2022 it would have become more difficult, because Ferrari was perhaps a little too fragile then. And last year? Well, that would have been a bit trickier.‚Äù**\n\n**Not just shouting around**\n\nA roar of laughter followed, as Verstappen and Red Bull gave the concept of dominance a whole new dimension last season. At the beginning of this year, that's where things seemed to be heading as far as 2024 is concerned, too. But since early May, the panels have shifted considerably. The question is legitimate whether anyone else could have become champion in the RB20. Especially if you compare Verstappen's performance to that of teammate Sergio P√©rez. ‚ÄúWhether it could have been? We're in Vegas, so you can maybe bet on that. I would say I wish them good luck.‚Äù Verstappen acknowledges that he is happy with how he has handled disappointments this year. Intrigues were plentiful at Red Bull, both on and off the track. As recently as early September in Monza, he said that a world title was no longer realistic. ‚ÄúWe had quite a difficult time after a very good start. I am quite proud of how we got through that as a team. As a person it's important to stay calm and not just shout around that it all sucks. I wouldn't have been as good at that a few years ago. You learn that over the years, too. And a few championships help put it into perspective more easily.‚Äù\n\n**Never been desperate**\n\nIn Las Vegas, Verstappen stayed ahead of both McLaren drivers quite easily. Mercedes (George Russell won) and Ferrari had it better than Red Bull, though. It will be interesting next week in Qatar to see how the proportions are then. At that circuit, McLaren should normally come out well, as should Red Bull. ‚ÄúAnd we have to keep a close eye on everything...,‚Äù Verstappen is referring to the possible gimmicks McLaren might have used, at least according to Red Bull. ‚ÄúI'm very proud of this season, though. I never despaired, but we had a lot of conversations - including at the factory in Milton Keynes - about what we could do better. A lot has happened and it has been a tough year.‚Äù Now he stands at four world titles, as many as Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel. And one more than, among others, his ‚Äúfather-in-law‚Äù Nelson Piquet. ‚ÄúBut the first time I met him I had nothing at all... Now, fortunately, that's a different story.

I have no problem with Jenson Button, he is great, but whatever misfit was alongside him he did not ask a single good question. (can anyone educate me where he raced in?).

Before this the drivers where moved by cars to the podium, why didnt the cars just park at the strip, or was this a problem with the track invasion? It just took way to long to get the drivers back to the Strip, it was boring.

  
Also the podium looked like it was on top Aarav's Shed (the Shed) there seemed to be no atmosphere at all, also there was no cooldown room, at least the trophee looked nice. The gimmic of the drivers being lifted up onto the podium was not impressive at all.

  
The race itself also has a lot of problems, from it being way to extravagant to the fact that the track looks like a pig upside down.

Compromises had to be found to make it possible for the US team to join in 2026. One of these is that the racing team will sail under the Cadillac flag.***\n\nMichael Schmidt\n\n23.11.2024\n\nIt will be official next week. Formula 1 wants to expand the field in the 2026 season. Eleven instead of ten teams will be on the grid. The newcomer is Cadillac. Behind the General Motors Group's works entry is Andretti's application, which was accepted by the FIA at the beginning of 2023 but postponed to 2028 by the rights holders amid much turbulence.\n\nBut a lot has happened since then. Andretti complained to the US Congress that the rejection was in breach of antitrust law. As a result, the US Department of Justice launched an investigation that could end with serious consequences for Formula 1 if good reasons are not presented against the authorisation. At worst, the US authorities could impose a fine totalling billions. A rumoured ban on Formula 1 appearances in the USA is rather unlikely. That would cost jobs.\n\n***Michael Andretti did not make any friends in Formula 1 with his brash behaviour.***\n\n**How high will the compensation be?**\n\nUnder the threat of politics, all parties involved have now come to several compromises. One condition was that Andretti's name would disappear. It had become a red rag for many in the scene after Michael Andretti's rumbling appearance. And GM feared that the plan to enter Formula 1 would ultimately fail because of Andretti's personnel.\n\nThe project's financial backers, Dan Towriss and Mark Walter, then took Andretti junior out of the firing line, put him off with an advisory role and reached an agreement with Formula 1 that the racing team would sail under the GM brand Cadillac from 2026. So everyone saves face.\n\nA few obstacles still need to be cleared out of the way to make the expansion possible. Here, too, compromises are being worked on. In the current Concorde Agreement, new entrants have to pay a so-called dilution fee totalling 200 million dollars in equal shares to the established teams.\n\nIn the new Formula 1 agreement, which is still being finalised, this sum is to be increased and adjusted to the current market situation. It will then be calculated what the new racing team could earn in the following five years. The sum corresponds to the new compensation payment. The existing teams were hoping for an amount of 600 million dollars to compensate for the smaller share of the cake and the loss in value of the team.\n\nCadillac will probably not have to pay that much. It is expected to be somewhere in the middle of 200 and 600 million dollars. The new method of distributing the prize money has also not yet been clarified. At the moment, the world champion receives 14.5 per cent of the prize money cake after deduction of all bonus payments. For tenth place it is seven per cent. With eleven teams, the key must change.\n\n***Until GM has built its own engine, the team could race with Honda power units.***\n\n**Will the engine come from Honda or Ferrari?**\n\nThe newcomer is not starting with a blank sheet of paper. For over a year now, 200 employees have been working on the chassis and aerodynamics for 2026 in a factory in Silverstone. As Cadillac is not yet part of the Concorde Agreement, the technical team, led by Nick Chester, Pat Symonds and Jon Tomlinson, is allowed to test around the clock in the wind tunnel. The time is also used eagerly. The Toyota wind tunnel in Cologne is largely occupied by the Americans.\n\nThe biggest problem is the engine. General Motors will not be ready with its own engine until 2028 at the earliest. A customer engine must be found for the time in between. Originally, the rule was that the manufacturer with the fewest customers had to step in. Newcomers such as Audi, RB Powertrains and newcomer Honda therefore have a one-year grace period.\n\nIn reality, this rule only applies to ten teams. If an eleventh is added, there are no more concessions. Honda originally did not see itself in a position to supply two teams in the first year of the comeback. Now the Japanese and partner Aston Martin have realised that they may not be able to resist a request from GM. The word in the paddock is: ‚ÄòHonda is waiting for a call from Detroit.‚Äô\n\n***Toyota has returned to Formula 1 as a technical partner of Haas.

With Logan now out and the US still a massive and expanding market for F1; I thought it would be interesting to ask again. Frankly, this time it seems even less obvious who it might be.

I see the options as:

* Jak Crawford - The best placed American in F2 (currently 5th), with links to Aston Martin. However, frankly, I think its unlikely Aston would put him in their car.
* Juan Manuel Correa - Sadly will perhaps always be best know for being part of Hubert's tragic crash.
* Max Esterson - Stepping up to F2 next weekend, but does not have great results over the last few years.
* Ugo Ugochukwu - Unlike the last time I asked when there were 5 Americans in F3, there is only Esterson this year and so far only Ugochukwu confirmed for next year. He is perhaps the most exciting US prospect having won Macau last weekend and being a long-term part of the McLaren junior programme. But like Bortoleto would he need to go elsewhere to get an F1 drive?
* Colton Herta - Still fairly young Andretti driver who could come across with them?

Again, an honourable mention to Pato O'Ward who grew up in Texas but was born in Mexico - who drives for McLaren in Indy but has expressed an interest in coming to F1 before. Nowadays, I'd see him more as a possible stand in for a F1 race in the Americas if Lando or Oscar were injured. ","[""If Colton wants the drive.

It's impossible until someone goes and does it, and it was definitely doable.\n\nAlso, the 80 point gap was at Silverstone, when Lando had already lost a lot of points at Spain, Austria and Silverstone. The gap was 54 points after Miami, arguably where McLaren started equalling and later beating Red Bull's pace. Closing 54 points in 18 races (with 4 sprints) was definitely doable especially when Red Bull became the 3rd fastest car at most of the races post summer break. Verstappen won 4 of the first 5 races, while Lando has managed 3 in 16 since Miami, in a car capable of much more"", '***The Telegraph reports***:\n\nAsked to sum up his season in three words, Lando Norris thinks for a long time before settling on an answer. ‚ÄúPretty damn good,‚Äù he says eventually. Then he has another think and downgrades the ‚Äògood‚Äô to ‚Äòdecent‚Äô. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to come up with a word that‚Äôs good but not quite good enough,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúLike, not perfect, but OK.‚Äù\n\nIt has clearly been tough for Norris\xa0[since his title challenge disintegrated](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/11/04/lando-norris-mclaren-title-failure-lessons-2025-season/)\xa0in spectacular fashion\xa0[in a soggy Brazil earlier this month](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/11/03/brazil-grand-prix-2024-qualifying-race-interlagos-weather/). A ‚Äúpretty s----- week‚Äù at home in Monaco, one in which he found it ‚Äúimpossible to sleep for the first two days‚Äù as he tried to process what had just happened, was followed by a more restful one in which he managed to ‚Äúbuild himself back up‚Äù with the help of friends and colleagues.\n\nThe 25-year-old insists he is heading into\xa0[this weekend‚Äôs race in Las Vegas](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/0/f1-schedule-race-2024-calendar-drivers-cars-sprints/)\xa0in a positive frame of mind. He says he has now come to terms with the fact that the drivers‚Äô championship is gone (albeit technically, with a deficit of 62 points to Max Verstappen and 60 points still available after Saturday‚Äôs race, it is still just about possible). Instead he is ‚Äúall-in‚Äù for the constructors‚Äô championship, which McLaren lead by 36pts from Ferrari and which they can win this season for the first time since 1998.\n\n# ‚ÄòRed Bull had advantage at the start‚Äô\n\nNorris presents a fascinating character study at this stage of his career. Introspective, vulnerable ‚Äì some would say too vulnerable ‚Äì undoubtedly quick, it is difficult to know how to judge him.\n\nHe clearly senses this. Sitting in McLaren‚Äôs paddock home in Sin City, at close to midnight local time, just as the casinos on the nearby Strip are really starting to gear up for action, Norris is is acutely aware of the narrative which has developed in some quarters, which says he threw away his chance to win this championship with a litany of errors, and he wants to nip it in the bud.\n\nNorris is adamant that no one, not even Verstappen, the driver he rates as ‚Äúthe benchmark‚Äù for his generation and ‚Äúone of the best of all time‚Äù, would have managed to do what he could not. ‚ÄúNo, definitely not,‚Äù he replies quickly when asked whether he thinks Verstappen would have won this title had he been driving the McLaren.\n\nSome may think Norris is being a bit too generous to himself. While the Briton was not wholly to blame for all of his dropped points this season, with McLaren also culpable for various strategic errors, there is no doubt he frittered away a fair few. Norris cost himself potential wins in Spain and Hungary thanks to poor starts, was outmanoeuvred by team-mate Oscar Piastri in Italy, and lost out to Verstappen again at the start in Austin. And that‚Äôs before you get to Brazil where Norris made two poor starts, the second after a red flag period, as well as a potential mistake in pitting just before a red flag.\n\nNorris accepts these errors, but he also insists the margins were always much tighter than people imagine and the odds were always stacked against him.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, no one ever in the history of Formula One has come back from the size of deficit I had,‚Äù he notes of a gap which stood at 84 points after Silverstone in July. ‚ÄúNo one. Ever. And there have been much bigger swings of performance of cars in the past than there has been now. The advantage they \\[Red Bull\\] had in the beginning of the season over everyone was way more than we‚Äôve had.‚Äù\n\nHe has a point. McLaren have generally had the quickest car from Miami onwards, but not everywhere. It would have needed everything to go perfectly from then onwards for Norris to overhaul Verstappen ‚Äì and possibly a DNF or two on the Dutch driver‚Äôs part. They never came. ‚ÄúI think if it was any other driver, well not any other driver, but if it wasn‚Äôt Max and Red Bull, I think the chances \\[of winning the title\\] would have been much higher,‚Äù he says.\n\n**Full interview:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/11/22/lando-norris-interview-max-verstappen-red-bull-mclaren/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/11/22/lando-norris-interview-max-verstappen-red-bull-mclaren/)']",0,49,0.29,0,43,43,0,49,0.29,0

- The three champions on the grid - Hamilton, Raikkonen & Alonso - absolute non-entities for most of the season.

- Double diffuser controversy.

With immediate effect, the FIA is banning special protective plates that around 50 percent of the teams had fitted over the skid blocks. Red Bull pointed out to the association that this practice is illegal.\n\n>It's the big issue with the ground effect cars. How deep can I drive without the skid blocks in the underbody wearing out too much due to contact with the road surface? The critical value for the screws that fix the floor panel to the car is one millimeter. Anyone who exceeds this will be disqualified, as Mercedes and Ferrari did at the 2023 US GP.\n\n>Because the downforce of the cars is heavily dependent on the height of the vehicle, the teams have come up with every conceivable trick over the last three years to protect the fastening screws as well as possible. They have experimented with insulating material between the base plate or with bolts that have a certain amount of play to cushion the impact from the track.\n\n>Red Bull discovered the trick first\n\n>The latest trick was to provide the sid-blocks, which are used for measurement by the FIA inspectors, with special protection. This applies above all to the fastening screw in the rear area of the base plate. Everyone wants to drive as low as possible in order to gain downforce.\n\n>Around 50 percent of the field believed they had found a loophole in the regulations. Red Bull was the first to discover the so-called protection skids among the competition. These are said to include Ferrari, Mercedes and Haas. World Championship opponents McLaren, on the other hand, like Red Bull, did without this practice.\n\n>What are the consequences of the ban?\n\n>Red Bull pointed out to the FIA that the trick was illegal if the rules were applied precisely and that a protest would have to be expected if there was no clarification on this issue. And this came promptly. A week before the Las Vegas GP, all teams received a letter. In a technical directive, the FIA announced that the protective skids in question were not permitted. This assessment applies with immediate effect. Ferrari would have liked to move the date to the Qatar GP, but were unable to get their way.\n\n>The teams affected now have a problem that is all the greater when the aerodynamics are specifically designed for extremely low ground clearance. Because no one can risk the skid blocks rubbing off too much, the relevant teams have to raise their vehicle height to a safe level.

1gvx4ox,Penalty point distribution analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gvx4ox/penalty_point_distribution_analysis/,2024-11-20, Statistics,"**Intro**  
After seeing a picture of the top 10 most penalized drivers circulating online, I was curious about the probability of the current penalty point distribution among nationalities. So, I did a small analysis of the current distribution. And found some interesting results I would like to share, mostly to ask for help in improving the analysis from the community. Please don't take this as an excuse to express gut feelings over bias. Some of the results may be highly unlikely but none of the results are beyond possible. I'm also no journalist, just an F1 nerd!

**Summary**  
I collected all data I could find about penalty points given per driver and the races they participated in per year. To this, I added the nationality they race under (Albon is Thai in the analysis). I then assumed penalty points to be normally distributed. I analyzed the result per nationality and took the variance from the mean as a measure. When you only take into consideration nationalities from which driver partook in at least 100 races you get the following results.

||
||
|Nationality|Variance from mean|
|United Kingdom|\-36%|
|Russia|27%|
|Monaco|\-26%|
|Netherlands|24%|
|Canada|23%|
|Mexico|21%|
|Australia|\-21%|
|Finland|\-20%|
|Brazil|\-12%|
|Spain|\-11%|
|Thailand|\-9%|
|France|8%|
|Japan|5%|
|Denmark|\-3%|
|Germany|\-2% |

As many noted in the original post given the amount of races driven by British drivers they are quite absent in the top 10. The likelihood of this given this analysis would be around 14% (50% for the mean - 36%). Although highly unlikely not improbable. It could however be a signal of potential bias, yet I wouldn't go as far based on the current analysis. 

Another interesting result is that both Russia and the Netherlands, have quite the variance from the mean. However drivers such as Kyvat, Mazepin, and Verstappen, who are more generally deemed aggressive drivers the results are more understandable. 

**Discussion**  
I feel the analysis could be quite a lot better, and for that, I'm hoping some of the kind souls of r/Formula1  would be willing to assist. I'm yet to find a good index or database with all penalty points per race. I have found this up until 2021, but after that, I'm reliant on articles that don't specify where the points were given. 

The results would also mean more if it would take into consideration all infringements investigated by the stewards. That would further improve the reliability of the analysis.

Beyond that assuming the results would be normally distributed is a stretch, even though the dataset is large, it fails to take into consideration all nuances of motorsport. This however is the best method I could come up with to check the results for potential bias.

I‚Äôm not even going to talk about him winning the F3 and F2 championship, but more so his last year in F1, in arguably one of the worst cars of the decade. 
I don‚Äôt think his season next to Mazepin needs to be mentioned, due to how bad Nikki was. 

But in his last year in F1, while he did have a very poor start, and a lot of expensive crashes, he had brillant 2nd half of the season. He beat Magnussen 6-4 in races, 12-10 in points, on his own merit. 
He also took the Haas to Q3 in his second year in F1, something that took 3 seasons for Russell (still a better driver, don‚Äôt get me wrong) in a still bad but somewhat better Williams. 

These stats are not incredible, I get that. But considering the fact that his rookie season in F1 was in Haas‚Äô worst year in terms of performance and inner-politics, many times many seconds of the pace of the next team, it‚Äôs hard to fault him for having a hard time to adjust to F1. I think many drivers that we consider to be the best, would have had a horrid time in those two seasons at Haas as well, trying to maximize capacity from the terrible car, while juggling with the politics and bad relationships inside the F1 team.

He beat his team mate consistently (outside of a pitstop issue not fault of his own in Zandvoort) in the last 10 races of 2022. 
Half the grid can‚Äôt beat their better team mate with that much consistency after a slow start of the season, or have that clear of a progression in performance. There‚Äôs usually always a main contender, a number 1 driver, across an entire season, with the 2nd driver usually struggling all year to catch the level of the 1st one, only to sometimes match it. 

And for that reason, I believe he deserves a spot in F1 more so than many drivers on this grid. (Some are already leaving us next year, though.)

Hulk has been consistently faster and better in the last two years while himself not being in the same league as the top drivers. The grid today is arguably the most talented in history.\n\nBut the final nail in the coffin for Mick's F1 career is that both Mercedes and Williams have his data and he isn't being considered by either Toto or Vowels and they can see his level better than us.

Not to mention the fact that he literally won a race with the second redbull team, that hasn't happened since the early days of Vettel..

And he didn't stop there, and had an amazing 2021 season, racking podiums after podiums.

And then he went to alpine..

Which at first looked like a bad move, but he actually got podiums in that thing multiple times on 2023, and this year when the car is probably at its worst..

He still has consistent top10 finishes and another podium...

Now I know that all of this is maybe not enough for a top4 team to consider him, but all I am saying is that I wouldn't mind him grabbing either that McLaren seat if either one of Norris or Piastri fails in the next few years..

Infact he probably should've been taken by Mclaren in 2022.. but oh well...

He's clearly learned from that but if you compare that to the job Alex Albon did as a rookie in the same car against the same teammate, I struggle to put him ahead of any non Perez driver in the top 4 teams. Sainz certainly deserves a top 4 team spot, I even think he deserves the Ferrari seat ahead of 40 year old Lewis. I'd also say Albon was very unlucky - if he hadn't been punted off track by Lewis at Austria in 2020, he'd have won the race and would probably still be at Red Bull as Max's teammate. Gasly lost his top team spot for genuine performance reasons."", ""Gasly's a great driver. The problem is that there aren't enough top team seats to go around. And occasionally- though not often- they are occupied by someone not worth it. Gasly is a great driver for a midfield team. He's not the most consistent, but he has some great performance and capitalizes when the opportunity arises, which is great for midfield. I don't see McLaren as that likely, but I could see him at Ferrari in a couple years when Lewis retires if Ollie doesn't look brilliant and ready. He also left Alpha Tauri on good terms by all appearances, so I wouldn't be shocked if he went to Red Bull again in the future if things go that way.\n\nRight now, I think he's comfortable at Apline. Popular French driver on the French team. And, they're looking to have Mercedes engines in the future. Honestly, they might become good. Last year, I thought their aero was probably actually pretty good, because all the teams agreed that they had a significantly less powerful engine, and yet regularly competed for points, and got a couple podiums without them even being major flukes. And this year hasn't looked too bad either after they finally got at least one chassis under the weight limit. So, the team might actually make a good car if they have what might be the best engine instead of the one that is undeniably the worst."", ""He's probably in my head the 6-10th fastest driver in F1 atm.

A very minor collision can have catastrophic consequences, or very minor ones. A deliberate lunge at a hairpin can miss another car or skewer it. Moving several times under braking might have no impact but might cause another car to slide off into the barriers. 

Sometimes actions are premeditated e.g. ""I'll knock him off at the first corner to win the championship"" but the punishment is only for the collision, not the loss of a championship.

If you have a driving offence on the road, the actions and the consequences are considered. Drinking and driving crimes and sentences are different if you just wobble in your lane or if you kill 3 people. Murder is different if premeditated or in the heat of the moment or even in self defence.

It's not enough that they punish for the simple action and nothing else, intent and outcome should be considered too.","[""The intent of penalties is to dissuade driving in a way that the sport (thru the rules) has agreed is unwanted/unsafe. Whether or not the action kills someone, causes minor damage, or has literally no impact at all doesn't change the fact that the sport wants to discourage those actions, because they COULD cause injury/damage in other instances. If there are niche stipulations for each rule you'd never have consistency in stewarding (I know I know, we already don't) and you'd make penalties become perceived as more personal than procedural. \n\nI get the intent of your question but I think we're better off with cut-and-dry flat penalties based on the actions, not the consequences. The flip side is something like the penalty on Bearman in Brazil when he tapped the back of Colapinto, Colapinto was fine and had no (evident) damage but Bearman spun and went to the back, then still got a penalty for causing a collision. But no solution will ever be perfect."", 'Because penalties are supposed to be quick. If we start evaluating intent and outcome you need a whole court case every time. \n\nOutcome should not be considered. It‚Äôs the right way.

Yet people act like he‚Äôs merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about ‚Äúexperimental setups‚Äù or ‚ÄúLewis is just unmotivated‚Äù, but, I‚Äôm sorry, that‚Äôs just a cop-out. Then we can just argue endlessly that basically no driver is worse than another driver, since there could always be intangibles like that, ‚Äúoh, he just doesn‚Äôt care about driving in midfield cars‚Äù. really? 


I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it‚Äôs just that people overlook George because they don‚Äôt like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance.

A lot of the times they are not necessarily next to each other, what I mean is. Look at Brazil, one qualifies Top 5~6 the other P12 or something, and Lewis is not a P10+ driver, I believe whenever the car is this apart, it is because Lewis has a very shitty setup that makes the car undrivable. \n\nIt reminds me a bit of Alonso first year in Alpine when he came back, Ocon was beating him clearly, until it was released that the car had some limitations that did not adapt to his driving style (Imagine what type of thing was been Alonso one of if not the drivers the best adapt to any type of car), when the issue was fixed, the roles were reversed.\n\nI don't think George is bad, I also don't think he is better than Lewis, I just feel he gets better outcome with his setups (That could be because he is better adapting to different setup), and Lewis just gets terrible setup that makes the car undriveable."", 'Mercedes are so incredibly inconsistent and incompetent that it‚Äôs basically impossible to judge what the car is actually capable for on any given weekend or if both drivers get given that same car. \n\n2022 was just a horrifically unlucky year for Lewis. I think he wins Hungary if his DRS doesn‚Äôt fail in Q3 and leaves him P7 (he ended up beating George who took pole). He wins Mexico if Merc don‚Äôt fuck up the tyre choices. He gets very close at the very least in Silverstone and Zandvoort without badly timed SCs and strategy errors. Brazil was a guaranteed win but Max crashed into him and as a result he lost places and 3 tenths worth of floor performance. And he took the brunt of the ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù that Merc ran to try and dig themselves out of their own mess and as a result lost even more ground. \n\n2023 was a less unlucky season and the balance immediately reverted. And Lewis still misses out on Hungary (brake issues that wore off with less fuel) and Singapore (he gets Lando and Carlos). \n\nWon‚Äôt even get started on how badly he‚Äôs been shafted this season.

Though personally, I think he\'s had the second-best season out of any driver this year, with only the obvious exceptional talent of Max Verstappen having outperformed him. \n\nBut whether it is quali performances, making the most out of shite set-ups or capitalising in races, George has spent the entire season making the most out of what he has in a way no other driver really has.

[The first historic group presentation is already set for 18 February](https://autoracer.it/it/f1-a-londra-un-grande-evento-di-lancio-della-stagione-2025/) even if it will only be the liveries and the great manoeuvres for the new set-ups of the various racing teams have already begun. Among the racing teams, **Ferrari** has [already made it clear](https://x.com/MuseiFerrari/status/1857455148869587089) that [the 2025 single-seater will be unveiled at a separate event](https://autoracer.it/it/ferrari-non-presentera-la-monoposto-2025-a-londra-non-sara-lunica/), and so will the other top teams.

Very willingly, **Ferrari has given the go-ahead for Carlos Sainz** to test the Williams in Abu Dhabi after the last round of the championship. It will thus be the beginning of a new partnership with Alexander Albon, a pair that in the announcement Williams described as one of the most formidable on the grid. **Lewis Hamilton, on the other hand, will not be present with Ferrari**, being unable to leave before 31 December. A question of opportunity after a great history and very complex contractual agreements. Nevertheless, Lewis Hamilton awaits the red car, like the most beautiful Christmas present, and **Ferrari has already planned what will be his ‚Äòentrance** ‚Äô to Maranello (we will analyse the plan). One will also have to wait to see **Kimi Antonelli** with Mercedes, the 18-year-old Italian called to Toto Wolff's court. The wait is also growing for **Gabriel Bortoleto**, Brazilian, F3 champion and F2 leader who will debut with Sauber (Audi), as well as **Liam Lawson**, with a future still to be decided between Red Bull and Racing Bulls.\n\n**Esteban Ocon** will be at Haas as early as testing, leaving Jack Doohan free to get into the Alpine for his first kilometres as a Formula 1 driver, while waiting to find out if the positive rumours about him are true, given how well he is spoken of by those who have seen him grow in the junior categories. Everyone is also waiting to see who will win the constructors‚Äò championship, given that the drivers‚Äô one is certain. **Ferrari, still in the fight, is not worried about rushing Lewis** and is meanwhile thinking about what set-up to give the team in the future. Antonio Giovinazzi is currently confirmed as a reserve driver. With him will also be **Arthur Leclerc**, who will spend more time on the track, forming a pair of reserve drivers as happened this year. It is understood that it will be the young Monegasque who will take part in FP1 in Abu Dhabi, for a special session with his brother Charles. In the rookie tests, on the other hand, which will also take place in Abu Dhabi, Arthur and Antonio Fuoco are both the main candidates to run kilometres on track. Fuoco, moreover, has recently driven the F1-75 and is the other driver who remains in the Cavallino's F1 orbit as a specialist in the Maranello simulator.\n\n**Ollie Bearman**, formerly a Haas driver, running three races this year, one with Ferrari and two with the American team, has lost his rookie status and will not be able to be employed in this role.

According to reports, the Chinese driver is not on the Scuderia's shortlist of names for the F1 project. It is not ruled out that the Scuderia will consider a third name as a reserve driver, should non-F1 commitments prevent Arthur Leclerc and Antonio Giovinazzi from being available, with appropriate evaluations underway. After a year in which no driver has moved, we are about to experience almost a revolution, between a legend joining the legend and the many young people who will create one of the greatest generational replacements in recent years.

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‚Äòround racing friend, for the latest batch of team updates, driver buzz, technical adventures and trackside stats is ready and waiting for you‚Ä¶

[*Throttle & Tread‚Äôs*](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/) thirteenth edition of *Last Week in Formula 1* has arrived.

Before leaving the garage, [you can catch up on last week‚Äôs issue here.](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-november-4-2024)

If you‚Äôre a rookie ‚Äòround these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly feature courtesy of *Throttle & Tread* recapping the most recent interesting and important goings-on in the Formula 1 world.

In the perfection-seeking spirit of F1, *Last Week in Formula 1* and *Throttle & Tread* are in a constant state of development. So any feedback you have on what‚Äôs covered, the format, or anything I missed is welcome in the comments.¬†

And if you, like me, enjoy pretty things‚Ä¶

You can have the pretty-with-pictures version of *Last Week in Formula 1*, along with *Throttle & Tread‚Äôs* *Briefings* and *Race Track Rundowns,* delivered safely into your inbox [by subscribing to *Throttle & Tread* on Substack.](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/)

Now let‚Äôs get down to business‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# Trackside Stats

Lol, shit‚Äîcourtesy of u/F1GuyDan, we now know that if Red Bull used Max Verstappen as a one-driver team, [they would have finished in the same place in the WCC standings every season of Max‚Äôs career, except for 2017 and 2022.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goz9xv/f1guydan_if_red_bull_used_max_verstappen_as_a/)

u/F1GuyDan also served up a Reddit specialty‚Äîfinding new ways to express how disappointing Sergio P√©rez has been this year: [We‚Äôve learned he‚Äôs closer to Zhou in the standings (who has 0 points) than Max, Charles, and Lando.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqx3zh/f1guydan_guanyu_zhou_is_closer_to_sergio_perez_in/)

**More on Max‚Äôs dominance:** [Here‚Äôs how he can win his 4th WDC title in Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1go8419/how_max_can_become_champion_in_las_vegas/)

And speaking of fast drivers, [here‚Äôs 2024‚Äôs Fastest Lap standings as of Brazil‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gorxqs/fastest_laps_2024/)

Along with [2024‚Äôs ‚Äòpodium‚Äô (so far) for top 5 finishes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpq39z/rn365_top_5_finishes_2024/)

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

Welp, this *should* put to bed any further rumours of where Checo will be next year. [Apparently Sith Lord Christian Horner has given the okay to Perez‚Äôs sponsors that he‚Äôll be driving for the main team next year, as per his contract.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gopmsh/marca_checo_p%C3%A9rez_is_not_moving_and_will_start/)¬†

Unrelated to anything of consequence, but a driver musing nonetheless, [Guenther Steiner had some blunt, choice words on the subject of Lance Stroll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goesf1/guenther_steiner_on_lance_stroll/)

Carlos Sainz was honoured by the Scuderia Ferrari Club in Maranello, [given a plaque that reads, *‚ÄúWherever you go, we will continue rooting for you. You‚Äôve entered our hearts, and you‚Äôll stay there.‚Äù*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplue3/motorsport_last_night_carlos_sainz_was_honored_by/) Hey I‚Äôm not crying‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre crying!

In a twist that caught me off guard but makes sense when you consider historical ties, [Zhou Guanyu‚Äîa former Ferrari Driver Academy padawan‚Äîis expected to become Scuderia Ferrari‚Äôs Reserve Driver for 2025.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gskr71/zhou_guanyu_is_expected_to_be_scuderia_ferraris/) Bravo Zhou!

On the subject of reserve drivers, while there‚Äôs no media confirming Mick Schumacher‚Äôs recent bit of vague-gramming, [I‚Äôd hazard a guess *this* means his time as Mercedes‚Äô reserve is over](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gtcojc/mick_sumachers_instagram_post/), paving the way for King Valtteri‚Äôs return.

For those interested in the goings-on of recently departed F1 drivers, [Logan Sargeant has done a seat fitting with IndyCar team Meyer Shank Racing,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp3hj7/otmeyer_shank_racing_step_1_seat_fit_logan/) ahead of what I assume will be a test with the team. As an IndyCar fan who watches all the races, Logie Bear better start sharpening his elbows‚Ä¶

While we‚Äôre on the subject of IndyCar, [Romain Grosjean is scrambling to stay on the grid next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gp7c4a/grosjean_scrambling_to_stay_on_indycar_grid_in/) Alas, his classic form of oscillating abruptly between high peaks and low lows while collecting a trophy case of crashes won‚Äôt help.

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

In a surprising turn of juicy events‚Äîthat will affect all teams in one way or another‚Äî[F1‚Äôs Race Director Niels Wittich has been fired](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gppllt/panning_photo_of_charles_in_the_rain_during_q3/) ([rather than stepping down, as the FIA have claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplmhc/jennie_gow_breaking_niels_wittich_to_step_down_as/)). With only three race weekends remaining in 2024, the timing seems rather odd. I daresay we can add another name to the list of those butting heads with FIA head Mohammed Ben Sulayem.

*But ‚Äòol Rotten Eggs Benny Boy didn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶* [FIA Compliance Officer Paolo Basarri was also fired last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gr8pxe/bbc_sport_paolo_basarri_leaves_role_as_fia/) Which is *curious,* as Basarri happens to be the official who compiled a report into allegations that Sulayem interfered with operations during two races in 2023. [I think I smell a rat dictator?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ALZTuyM7lg)

In a similar vein, Greg Maffei, president and CEO of F1‚Äôs commercial rights holder, Liberty Media, [will leave his role at the end of the year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqd2ir/racefans_on_bluesky_greg_maffei_president_and_ceo/) I daresay we‚Äôre starting to see some effects of the FIA-FOM power struggle that‚Äôs been quietly reaching a boil since Mohammed took over the FIA leadership.

*The firings will continue until morale improves:* Aston Martin Technical [Director Dan Fallows, who was poached from Red Bull with great fanfare and high expectation, has been let go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpjono/dan_fallows_will_no_longer_serve_as_technical/) Current Aston Martin Executive Director [Bob Bell, a highly regarded design engineer who I‚Äôve never heard of, will fill in as TD on a temporary basis](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpkypa/bbc_executive_director_bob_bell_a_highly_regarded/) (I presume until Lord Newey is able to start drawing in British Racing Green). Daddy Stroll must be losing patience‚Ä¶

Well folks, in case you had any lingering doubts or were clinging to shreds of hope, Renault‚Äôs F1 engine program is officially *done.* [Alpine have confirmed their switch to Mercedes‚Äô engine and gearbox from 2026.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpioxc/f1_breaking_alpine_announce_they_will_switch_to_a/) In celebration of their storied success, [here‚Äôs a collage of all the championships they powered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gpm4t9/so_long_renault_engines_heres_the_wccs_wdcs_they/)

*I was surprised when this one appeared in my timeline‚Ä¶* F1 is working on a proposed 2026 rule change that‚Äôll make life harder for customer teams like Toro Tauri VCARB or Haas: [If a team finishes P5 or higher in the WCC, they have to design all non-listed parts on their own after a period of three years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gru00i/tobi_gr%C3%BCner_formula_1_is_working_on_a_rule_change/) I can‚Äôt imagine this idea will go down well or smoothly‚Ä¶

In a related-and-exciting bit of news for Haas, while insisting have no plans to build an F1 engine, [Toyota wants to give Haas independence from Ferrari](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gsioi5/toyota_wants_to_give_haas_independence_from/) as they settle into supporting the project on the aerodynamics side.

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

The fine folks at [Ferrari appear to believe that F1‚Äôs wind tunnel time allocation rules (the worse you‚Äôre doing, the more time you get) will be a game changer for the 2026 regulation overhaul.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goofx4/why_ferrari_thinks_f1s_wind_tunnel_rules_could_be/) Their notion of course being that teams not fighting for the championship will self-sabotage/withhold resources in the first half of 2025 in order to get maximum wind tunnel time ahead of 2026.

There was an F1 Commission meeting last Wednesday, [in which they seem to have settled on a few items, courtesy of trusty F1 insider Chris Medland:](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqiv4p/chrismedlandf1_the_f1_commission_meeting_today/)

* A spec driver cooling kit for when a heat hazard is declared has been approved from next season onwards.  
* Yet-to-be-known tweaks for how the starting grid will close up when a team withdraws a car have been agreed upon.  
* And the post-Abu Dhabi rookie sprint race is slated for a 2026 debut.

1gu4rbi,Exclusive: Ferrari in Las Vegas with a new wing and an experimental floor,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gu4rbi/exclusive_ferrari_in_las_vegas_with_a_new_wing/,2024-11-18, News,,"['Experimental‚Ä¶. Is it armoured against man hole covers?', ""Translation \n\n\nWith three races to go, McLaren must defend a 36-point lead over Ferrari and 49 over Red Bull , Mercedes had recovered many points in the summer but the threat has quickly deflated. It can be a lot or a few, depending on your perspective. After the start of the season, it was unpredictable to see a Red Bull suffering for 10 races. However, the internal war between Horner and the Austro-Dutch faction had undermined its stability and perhaps its technical clarity . Huge figures such as Newey and Wheatly have left or will gradually leave the team. Some experienced designers and specialist engineers have moved to Ferrari , the recruitment campaign for the 2026 engine was good but did not take away big figures from the competition. Verstappen, Marko and Horner have signed an indefinite truce to at least secure the drivers' title.\n\n\nMcLaren found itself stronger than observers (and even itself) had predicted . Despite several errors of maturity (but it was not the only one this year) it can return to success after 27 years. After Interlagos the team could see the pressure on Lando Norris eased, now with very low chances of bothering Verstappen, which on the one hand cannot be considered positive but on the other it could prove useful to better express its important speed. Red Bull has shown signs of improvement but the Woking car starts as a contender for victory in two out of three races. The task of Ferrari, who finds itself the first pursuer, is not easy and it is not impossible . Not to mention variables out of control such as temperatures and complex conditions, competitiveness in races such as Abu Dhabi and Lusail will fundamentally depend on the position in qualifying. The SF-24 overall was not able to do well on a single lap or at low track temperatures . The situation has improved a lot with the changes in Monza, but it could not be resolved in every condition.\n\n\nExclusive: In Las Vegas, Ferrari will test an experimental chassis useful for the 677 project.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIf we find something (in the tunnel) we will try it,‚Äù Vasseur had said. In fact, the most important updates have been completed, however Ferrari will have a specific experimental underlay available for Friday‚Äôs free practice, useful for correlating the new 2025 car . For budget cap reasons, being a component useful only for testing, in America there will be only one underlay that, according to the plans, both drivers will have the opportunity to try for a run. It is certainly a way to verify some steps forward in the implementation of the basic underlay of the 677 model , which will also have a much more advanced design than the current one. Nonetheless, no one is confident that they have definitively stifled the hopping, the engineers want to make sure they continue development with a good anti-porpoising metric (thanks to the Monza spec) in the most sensitive areas.\n\n\nThe real novelty in Las Vegas will be the availability of a front wing that is lighter than the Monza specification (which will be present) that can be used if the track offers satisfactory levels of grip. On the rear, however, the technicians will choose the best option between the SPA and Monza specifications. Ferrari does not have a PU change in its starting program on Leclerc's no. 16. In Brazil, qualifying and the wet race, exceptionally performed on the same day, allowed the Monegasque's freshest unit to be saved stress and km of degradation. The technicians plan to continue the rotations within the elements of the available pool.  This year there will not be a full white and red livery as happened on the SF-23, we will see a small distinctive note. The drivers' and mechanics' uniforms will also feature a logo to commemorate the launch of 'Gladiator II' . The Maranello team knows that the very fast Las Vegas track represents the best opportunity of the three remaining to close the gap on McLaren."", 'If the wing is lighter than the upgrade brought in Monza, I can only hope it works for a track like Las Vegas, which I am still trying to discern whether it could *(and probably, so does the team, given that it will be tested for a bit to assess their chances)*. \n\nStill, I am optimistic for their chances! They were relatively good in Las Vegas, so I hope to see a repeat of that this time around', 'I‚Äôm not sure about the experimental floor. We have seen these years with ground effect how critical it could be.', 'The manhole covers of Vegas yearn for the experimental floor', 'Oh boy', 'Lettin Sainz doin some test drive for Sir Lewis is a clever move üòòü§å', 'It‚Äôs a giant magnet üß≤ pulls the cover for the car behind', 'Yo let‚Äôs let Fred cook, it‚Äôs been pretty obvious for a while that the Italian cuisine has needed a touch of French technique!']",50,11,0.95,50,10,10,50,11,0.95,50

The entire procedure was used exactly two times, there was an infringement both times and one time it was nothing, the other time it was a fine. So in that sense it wasnt lower than usual.\n\nIn general, correlating the severity of the penalty to the severity of the infringement doesnt work, in particular across different types of infringements or even across different rulebooks. The rules dont work like that.\n\nIn terms of fuel, everyone was instructed to do the extra lap.

It's not ideal, but the procedural similarities between the Aborted Start and Extra Formation Lap procedure are fairly needlesley similar, and it's not the first time we've seen a mistake like that. In this school, the drivers and teams should know better, but they're not in racing conditions and they're driving knowing that there could be danger on track, so there was no really no reason to enforce a harsh sporting penalty.\n\nThere are clearly some very strong opinions each way, all depending on your view of how unsafe it was."", 'I agree the penalty was too light, for as far as I know there were still marshalls and equipment on or near the track, but except for Sainz, everybody made an extra formationlap.']",0,71,0.38,0,69,69,0,71,0.38,0

I'm sure the vast amount of readers here knows the story. As reported by a BusinessF1 article, that [Schumacher was prematurely pushed out at Ferrari](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/51sn70/interesting_read_on_how_schumis_first_retirement/?rdt=33460) because good ol' Montezemolo got power hungry.

There appears to be but one problem. BusinessF1 is the one and only (AFAIK) source of the story, and we know that rag is as good as [diarrhea soaked toilet paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/18cxbwy/i_think_we_should_all_be_aware_that_buisnessf1/). 

To my knowledge, this story has **never** been corroborated by *any* reputable media outlets, nor have there been any actual insider statements. 

This is not one of those paddock open secrets where there has been enough confirmation with sources that a reputable outlet like the BBC would report on it with qualifying statements such as ""...understands that..."", ""...reportedly..."" ala Alonso's 2009 Ferrari move.

On the contrary, [Ross Brawn himself states that Michael didn't have it in him at the end of 2006 for the commitment required to gun for another WDC](https://youtu.be/t15tKnsUJrk?t=2335), and additionally Todt said had the rest of the dream team stayed on, [Todt would have quit himself](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/todt-reveals-he-planned-to-quit-ferrari-4406126/4406126/).

Opponents want a racing team to have to produce more parts in-house. If a team is too successful, they will be forced to do so in the future.***\n\n> *The dispute is as old as the Haas model in Formula 1. In 2016, the US racing team used a loophole in the rules to enter the premier class. All parts that the regulations did not require the team to build themselves were ordered from engine partner Ferrari. This saved costs and reduced the risk. The team boss at the time, Guenther Steiner, had thus made the premier class attractive to CNC machine king Gene Haas.*\n\n> *The concept was controversial from the start. Force India, Williams, McLaren and Sauber felt betrayed. They took the view that you had to work hard to get your place in the formula. In their opinion, that was not the case with Haas. 60 percent of the car came from Ferrari. Steiner countered the critics at the time by saying that the Haas team would not have existed without this special path.*\n\n> ***Toro Rosso is also planning the Haas model***\n\n> *After Haas fell ever further down the table in 2019, the criticism died down. That changed abruptly this year. The US racing team currently has the fifth fastest car in the field and is battling with Alpine and Toro Rosso for sixth place in the constructors\' championship. To make matters worse, the last-placed team from the previous season has now also joined forces with Toyota.*\n\n> *At the same time, Toro Rosso is also moving closer to the Haas solution. The synergies with its sister team Red Bull are increasing year by year. From 2026, external production will be fully exploited. The engine, transmission, suspension, hydraulics and steering will then come from a single source. From next year, the engineers will also work in their own building on the Red Bull campus in Milton Keynes. This fuels mistrust.*\n\n> *For the teams that produce everything themselves, these joint ventures are suddenly a thorn in their side. Aston Martin, Alpine and Williams in particular are taking a stand against this rule and demanding a higher percentage of in-house production. The problem is that Haas would not be able to design and manufacture everything itself overnight. To do that, they would need a new factory, more people and more tools.*\n\n> ***Three years of preparation for DIY***\n\n> *In the dispute over customer teams, a compromise has recently emerged that will be included in the regulations for 2026 if it finds the necessary majority. According to this, a so-called customer team that finishes fifth or better in the constructors\' championship once must then build everything itself with a lead time of three years. Success is thus punished.*\n\n> *While Toro Rosso is open to the proposal, Haas team boss Ayao Komatsu has already announced his opposition. ""It would be a killer for the small teams. If Formula 1 wants as many teams as possible to be competitive, then it will reject this rule. What better thing could happen to the sport than David winning against Goliath?""*\n\n> *Komatsu also believes that the in-house production of certain parts is overrated: ""What fan cares whether the gearbox or the suspension comes from Ferrari or from us?"" The accusation that Haas has a competitive advantage by purchasing certain parts is dismissed by Komatsu: ""We are credited with a nominal equivalent value in the budget cap for the components we buy. It is so high that we have no advantage."" In fact, Sauber returned to producing its own gearbox two years ago because it was cheaper than buying the transmission from Ferrari.*', 'out of all the things to try and fix, this was not on my bingo card', 'So if you finish 5th once, you then need to build your own parts within 3 years?

Managing Director Peter Bayer reveals that the pilot was not entirely innocent at the hanging part.*\n\n\n*That a driver has to leave a team in the middle of the season is not everyday history in Formula 1. If it is also a driver who has 257 Grands Prix under his belt and was able to celebrate eight victories, then the excitement is especially great. And so, of course, those responsible for Toro Rosso had to answer a lot of questions when the first rumors about an imminent expulsion of Daniel Ricciardo surfaced in Singapore.*\n\n\n*But no one from the leadership officially wanted to confirm the farewell. Even the driver himself did not want to know that it could be his last appearance in the premier class. Instead, an attempt was made to make the race weekend quite normal. But the longer the hanging part dragged on with the evasive statements of the participants, the clearer it became to everyone in the paddock that a great career is coming to an end here.*\n\n\n*When the separation was finally made official with a week‚Äôs delay, a lot of criticism hit the team. Ricciardo had been denied the chance to celebrate a proper farewell to Formula 1 and the fans, was the accusation. The secrecy was not worthy of a pilot like Ricciardo.*\n\n\n*Team boss Laurent Mekies admitted at the next race in Austin that they were not happy with how the weekend went: ‚ÄúWe could have handled it differently, or maybe even should have done it.‚Äù In the meantime, it was known that everyone involved knew about the impending separation before the Singapore weekend. But Mekies did not want to go into more detail about why they did not play with open cards.*\n\n\n\n*Only Peter Bayer brings some light into the dark. When asked by auto motor and sport, the managing director revealed that it was not the team‚Äôs idea to delay the announcement for so long: ‚ÄúWe had agreed with Daniel that we would not communicate it. We knew we‚Äôd look a bit old as a team. But we also did this to protect the driver. It was his wish.‚Äù*\n\n\n*According to Bayer, Ricciardo had hoped until the end that another miracle would happen. ‚ÄúHe believed until the end that he would drive in the front of the qualifying and show it to everyone. I have never seen such a mental strength that this person has in an athlete. And I‚Äôve been to many sports.‚Äù*\n\n\n*But the miracle unfortunately did not take place. Ricciardo could no longer pull the rudder. His fate was sealed. ‚ÄúThat was a terrible moment, as he was eliminated in Q1. You already heard on the radio that a world has collapsed for him,‚Äù Bayer recalls. ‚ÄúWe then talked to him again on Saturday. We sat together in our office at two o‚Äôclock in the morning and asked him how we were supposed to do it now. He then told us to just let him do the race. He just didn‚Äôt want a fuss.‚Äù*\n\n\n*In the end, Ricciardo was allowed to finish the Formula 1 chapter with the fastest race lap. But there were no world championship points. And also not a solemn farewell. Bayer regrets this, but also sees no alternative way: ‚ÄúWe have stood in front of him as a team. If Daniel had driven to Abu Dhabi, then of course the farewell would have been celebrated with fireworks and photo on the grid, just like with R√§ikk√∂nen back then. That‚Äôs what everyone would have liked.‚Äù*\n\n\n*According to Bayer, however, one should not forget that Ricciardo‚Äôs career would have ended before without Red Bull. ‚ÄúWe gave him another chance that no one thought possible.‚Äù The relationship between the ex-driver and the team is still good. According to Bayer, there is still regular contact between Ricciardo and team boss Mekies. ‚ÄúIt was important for us that at the end of the day we could look in the mirror and say that we did it right. Even if the whole world and its nine million Instagram fans are beating us up.‚Äù*', 'A lot more respect for the team with this information now, that he chose this and they took the heat to honor his choice.

I realise there are obviously both pros and cons. The pros seems huge to me, and they include forced clean racing, since a very large deviation from the track limits would very likely result in a dnf, thus increasing the discipline of drivers. It would also eliminate qualifying instances of a pole holder heaving actually exceeded track limits, which I understand isn't a deliberate thing, but a natural mistake stewards can overlook. It would also seemingly increase safety, since the vastly larger friction would slow down a car that's headed for the barriers. Cons include increased workload for track Marshalls, who would more frequently have to sweep the track, as well as increased number of yellow flags when a car gets beached in the gravel. 

To my eyes, increased safety and sport integrity outweigh the potential reduced runtime of a race, thus is the decreased revenue of F1 due to less race runtime the sole reason this isn't happening?","[""One of the issues is that F1 shares tracks with other race series and motor bikes. For example MotoGP drivers don't like gravel that much. It hurts more than runoff areas, although they have airbags in their suits."", ""F1 isn't the only racing series. Amateurs don't want to have to have their limited time ruined by gravel traps"", 'Mostly because they are reserved as safe\\* way to stop a car but can also beach them. ""Forcing"" drivers to stay on the track does not mean they will. You can be very disciplined and someone could squish or bump you out and if you are suggesting a track so tight they won\'t go out of it during qualy because exceeding its limits would put them in the gravel, then any racing incident would end in it as well. So it\'s not all pros. They are better suited to slow down cars in places where you need to slow them. Otherwise everyone would end up beached after every minor mistake and a race with only half the grid on track is not as interesting.\n\n\\*They also aren\'t completely safe. Sometimes cars can either roll from going into the gravel sideways or even glide above it.

They were very explicit about anyone going into the gravel absolutely had to be recovered and should not return to the track even if they didn't become beached as the clean up and potential damage from gravel is too risky. \n\nThe safest form of run-off is paved run-off, a paved surface gives cars the most friction with less risk of sudden direction changes.

Saturday:-

\- Race qualifying. Q1: standard format, free-for-all. Ten cars eliminated

Q2: one-lap shootout. Track order decided by Q1 times, priority goes to slowest car to encourage competition and risk-taking in Q1 (teams can pick their slot based on track evolution/weather forecast). Five cars eliminated

Q3: same as Q2, track priority based on Q2 times

  


Sunday:-

\-Race as usual



  
Points:- 

\-Race: positions 20-11 receive between 0 and 9 points (one point increments)

Positions 10-1 as follows: 10th (11 pts), 9th (14 pts), 8th (18 pts), 7th (23 pts), 6th (29 pts), 5th (36 pts), 4th (44pts), 3rd (53 pts), 2nd (63 pts), 1st (74 pts)

Back in 2022 we had that mess of a tractor on track under heavy conditions, which let to Neils picking up from Freitas. A massive lapse in judgement over safety given how horrible Gaslys onboard felt at the time, barely being able to see it even as he's going past. In Gaslys own words if he was two metres to the left he would have been dead. 

And then you have Jules Bianchi's tragic death, where he lost control and crashed into a recovery vehicle, on the very same track in 2014.

I'm not sure exactly what the rules are regarding recovery vehicles,  but I personally think that if you need to grab a recovery crane to remove a car from the track, it should be red flagged. The corner Carlos spun out on sure was slower, but you don't have to hit a tractor that fast for it to be lethal. 

It can't be a coincidence the last two times we have had a change in Race Director have been races where there is a live racetrack while a recovery vehicle is within the bounds of the overall circuit enclosure. idk. Maybe it's something entirely different or maybe it's down to some kind of misapplied judgement when it comes to the use of recovery vehicles. 

What do you think?","['We had delays in red flags to let people complete laps but they didn‚Äôt actually let the people complete the laps in the end meaning neither safety nor entertainment got prioritised and everyone was unhappy.\n\nWe had marshals pushing a car back onto the track and nobody realising for a while.

I keep hearing about 2026 being the year in which new regulations will apply, and this appears to mean fundamentally redesigned cars? 

My question is: Given that, this year, it‚Äôs been quite competitive between a few teams in terms of car performance, will next year‚Äôs 2025 season be likely to be similar? That is, if next year‚Äôs regulations are similar, then presumably the teams (focussing on 2026), will be applying moderate improvements to the existing cars for 2025, rather than entirely new designs?

Additionally, does anyone know yet how different the cars might have to be under the new, upcoming regulations?

1gplc79,Just finished a passion project - watching every race from 1992 to 2003. Here's what I learned...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplc79/just_finished_a_passion_project_watching_every/,2024-11-12, Discussion,"I started watching F1 in 2004 and really wanted to find out a little more about the recent history of the sport, mainly about drivers. This took me a couple of years overall; I really like having background noise while working, so I would have old races on and take little notes on things that stood out. Safe to say there was a lot that made me think, I wanted to share it, and I could think of nowhere else to do so, so here it is. Hopefully this is appreciated - feel free to agree/disagree with any of this or ask anything I may not have covered etc...

* The level of driving talent throughout the field was so much worse in those days. It always made me laugh when I‚Äôd see people claim Latifi was a candidate for worst driver in F1 history. He was probably on par with someone like Aguri Suzuki, who was massively accident prone but had a noteworthy performance maybe once a year. Martin Brundle may be similar; very good for the era, but someone who struggled in qualifying like he did would probably have a much shorter shelf life in today's F1.
* The era immediately after Senna‚Äôs death is unquestionably the weakest since at least the early 80s, and most likely the weakest ever. Only Schumacher was the finished product. Hill was too error prone, Alesi too inconsistent, Villeneuve was both and the likes of Berger, Barrichello and Coulthard were lacking that last tenth or two. I don‚Äôt think you could say that for Lando, Charles or Piastri, nor for Ricciardo, Rosberg and Button in their primes.
* Michael Schumacher‚Äôs 1995 has to be the greatest single-season performance I can think of from a driver. After crashing at Imola, he went on a 13 race run where he won eight times, finished second once (Portugal), suffered a gearbox problem when leading by miles (Canada), got taken out while defending the lead (Britain), suffered mechanical failure while running second (Hungary) and got taken out while running second (Italy). This run included three of the best wins of his career at Spa, the Nurburgring and Aida, the latter one that really deserves more fanfare given I knew nothing about it before watching. If we consider Williams took 12 pole positions that year, Schumacher arguably wasn‚Äôt even driving the fastest car!
* Jacques Villeneuve is the most overrated driver I have ever seen. He was way off Hill in terms of pure pace in 96 but took advantage of Hill being awful at damage limitation. In ‚Äò97 he was even worse at damage limitation than Damon the year prior. ‚Äò98 saw some amazing individual drives, but there were eight occasions where he was either beaten by Frentzen, behind when one of them retired, or threw his car off the road. I would argue 2000 was his best, but even then it was hard to truly assess how good he was because his benchmark in the sister car was so bad. As soon as BAR put a competent driver in the second car, Villeneuve started to get shown up. He arguably looked weaker than Jarno Trulli compared to Panis.
* I couldn‚Äôt fathom how Montoya was so highly rated when he got walloped by Raikkonen in the same car. The Williams had to have been a rocketship. I now realise he probably was that good, but going to McLaren was awful for him. He was the antithesis of a Ron Dennis driver and just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong, though most of it was his own fault.
* Coulthard and Carlos Sainz Jr are basically the same driver, albeit Coulthard had better cars. They‚Äôd have phenomenal individual performances and somewhat lengthy purple patches where they looked like world beaters, and it was enough evidence to make you believe that Coulthard could really win the title, or Sainz could really become Ferrari‚Äôs #1 - then Leclerc/Hakkinen would remind everyone who‚Äôs boss.
* 2012 is still the greatest season ever, but 1999 and 2003 have to be right in the mix for sheer drama. There were so many flashpoints, narratives, underdog successes and what-ifs. 2000 also comes highly recommended for the sheer brilliance of the main protagonists.
* 1997 also comes highly recommended as one of the most competitive seasons of all time. There were no real classics, but there also wasn‚Äôt a single boring race. Williams had a rocketship for most of the year but Ferrari, McLaren and Benetton could win on any given weekend. Jordan and Sauber were also superb at tracks that suited their cars, while several midfield-or-lower teams were seriously boosted by Bridgestone being miles better than Goodyear. It couldn't possibly be understood by someone that hasn't seen it.
* The era puts into perspective how much MBS absolutely sucks. I couldn't stand Max in his latter years as FIA president but you could at least see he was fighting for the type of small team he himself used to be involved in. MBS is nothing more than a hyper-moralistic whinger.

I'll only put the relevant part because the full context might make this more complicated and I am very bad with words.

- Say it's a 50 lap race.
- P1-P7 have lapped P8 down and are on the final lap.
- P1 suffers some failure/crashes/whatever and won't cross the chequered flag.

What we agree on:    
- P1 still classifies because they finished more than 90% of the race.

What we disagree on:    
- I say P1 becomes P7 because they already finished Lap 49 ahead of the other cars and so is ahead of P8.    
- He says P1 becomes last of the Lap 49 finishers because it's a DNF. *(In our scenario, P8-P11 are one lap down, so P1 becomes P11 according to him.)*

I still don't understand his reasoning for the DNF part but I am pretty sure I'm right on this one. However, I don't know how to properly put it into words so maybe someone better at explaining things can help me out.

Unless I am wrong about this and would also like to know why.

Thank you.","['> I say P1 becomes P7 because they already finished Lap 49 ahead of the other cars.\n\nThis is correct. #8 is unable to complete lap 50 and #1 completed lap 49 before #8, so he is classified ahead of #8.', 'Yes, it happened a couple years ago in Spa. Lando had an engine failure on the last lap, barely getting over the line.

This week, we‚Äôre forgoing the typical *Last Week in Formula 1* preamble in favour of sharing a spot of news, dear reader and fellow racing fan.

There‚Äôs changes coming over the next week to *Last Week in Formula 1*, which include a new name and livery, along with the launch of a new weekly feature.

As this humble racing newsletter expands in scope, *Last Week in Formula 1* isn‚Äôt broad enough to capture all that will be published, hence the change.

Mums the word for now, but **the announcement will be landing in your inbox on Wednesday November 13th, bright and early at 6:30am PST.**

*(*[*Which is all the more reason to subscribe on Substack if you haven‚Äôt already.*](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/)*)*

Until then, you have the latest edition of *Last Week in Formula 1‚Äôs* mutterings and musings, twistings and turnings, tidbits and playtime to enjoy below.

*(If you missed last week‚Äôs issue,* [*you can find that one here.*](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-october-28-november-3-2024)*)*

**Now, for the uninitiated:**¬†

If you‚Äôre a rookie ‚Äòround these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly feature compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world into one easy, breezy, beautiful read.

Every fun fact, story, and piece of news has been sourced from posts in r/formula1 (AKA: Formula 1‚Äôs publicly accessible online paddock).

Given this is The Internet, I suggest taking everything you read with a grain of salt. However, over many years of following the subreddit, there‚Äôs far more truth than lies posted‚Äîand much of the news comes from reputable sources.

Lastly, like the cars we enjoy watching so much, *Last Week in Formula 1* and ¬† *nope, not this time either!* are in a constant state of development. Any feedback you have on what‚Äôs covered, the format, or anything I may have missed is welcome in the comments.

Now let‚Äôs hit the track‚Ä¶

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

To the collective pain of Williams fans the world round, the team that‚Äôs been showing much promise and signs of growth this season, are having to accept that all may be for naught, at least in terms of rising in the WCC standings.¬†

Speaking of Williams and their travails, in addition to likely losing $30 million in prize money, their recent spate of damages has them in a spot of bother, [leaving them uncertain of what car spec they can bring to Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glunax/unsustainable_run_of_damage_leaves_williams/)

In both the episodes it was called out that both the drivers came from working-class backgrounds and made sacrifices to become and stay an F1 driver and achieve what they had.

I wondered which of the 24 or so drivers this year come from humble backgrounds.  I know Lewis had a working-class family.  I think in Drive to Survive they mentioned that Ocon also was working-class.  I know Sargeant, Stroll and Norris come from wealth.  

Can anyone share info about the remaining drivers? ","[""Alonso's parents are firmly working class and didn't have any surplus wealth or anything.

His mother is still a hairdresser, his father died when Charles was in F2 after a long illness, but he worked for some business when he was healthy. I couldn't find evidence if it was the family business or not.\n\nThe granfather would only gave a certain budget to the kids for racing. The much older brother (Jules Bianci's best friend) stopped karting when Charles was young, so that Charles could have the whole budget, and their little brother Arthur barely got to do any competitive racing. Charles was so promising right away, it just kind of made sense for karting to be his thing, even though all the kids liked it. In 2010, Charles was going to have to stop karting anyway- seemingly the budget from the grandparents from it was going away for one reason or another.

Ocon‚Äôs family were small business owners (though not well-off, they owned a garage), and apparently sold the business and other assets to pay for Ocon‚Äôs karting and early junior career. \n\nLewis doesn‚Äôt come from a working class family, they‚Äôre solidly middle class.

For me, Michael is the best of all time, but even he couldn't match his earlier performance when he was over 40."", 'Some might say his genius is almost frightening', 'There is no question that Max is one of the all time greats. For all the complaints about 2021, or saying Newey made a rocket ship so it was easy, Max has shown this year that his racecraft is on a different level. He also just pulled off something that only 5 people could ever pull off.\n\nAs for Lewis, I have hope. He‚Äôs been stuck in a team that completely botched the car for 4 years now. He‚Äôs always delivered at Silverstone. He‚Äôs had two wins this year, which is just one less than Lando. Who knows what might happen at Ferrari. I‚Äôd love to see him in a competitive car again.', 'I only ever hear this argument made about Lewis when his performances are still consistently good especially in race trim in a compromised car, but others like Alonso get praised for ‚Äúlongevity‚Äù when their performance has visibly diminished in the last while. \n\nHe‚Äôs been getting as much out of these nightmarish cars than anyone would, even Max. He‚Äôs been used as a guinea pig, stitched up on strategy, the victim of horrifically bad luck, you name it. If George was carrying these burdens since 2022 he‚Äôd have taken even more of a performance hit. \n\nHe carried Mercedes to P2 last season and most people didn‚Äôt even have him in their top 4', 'As always, people confuse ""being past his prime"" with ""being washed"". \n\nHamilton is 40. Since 2020 he\'s made a number of silly mistakes that he wouldn\'t have in prior seasons. Not a lot, but it\'s a pattern. A few times per year. And it\'s a major reason for why he lost the championship in 2021 (brake magic ‚ú®). \n\nHe can still be one of the best drivers on the grid and also past his prime. Schumacher was already clearly past his prime in 2006, but I have no doubt that he would\'ve won 2007 and 2008.', 'Hopefully Lewis can silence some people next season (wishful thinking I know üò≠)', ""Lewis ain't bad  tbh  it's just the  car that's messing around, he's performing way better than some drivers out there in the WDC rankings and managed to get 2 race wins."", 'I mean clarkson has long also been past his prime and is still out there being opinionated.', 'Wow what a surprise lol\n\n\\#captainobvious']",315,72,0.95,315,59,59,315,72,0.95,315

The Mexican has a contract until 2025 and has every chance of finishing this season and starting the next one.\n\nFirst it was said that he would not continue beyond Spa, with an ultimatum or three-race test. When he got over the barrier, it was said that he would announce his retirement when he arrived at the Mexican GP, \u200b\u200bwhich did not happen and now he is considered eliminated in most predictions, with his seat occupied by Lawson, Colapinto, Tsunoda or even Carlos Sainz. But it will not be for any of them next season, but for the current '11' on the grid.\n\n**According to MARCA's information, P√©rez will even get new sponsors for 2025, some very powerful, in addition to those he already has, and Red Bull has recently given him the go-ahead to start making clothing and merchandising products  - a type of agreement that requires production in advance and that has received all the approval of the team's economic team, after going through Horner, of course.**\n\nThe name of the new sponsor is not yet known, but the old ones would include Claro, Telcel and Infinitum, all of them from the Carlos Slim group, as well as Interprotecci√≥n  a global insurance broker that has accompanied the pilot for years. These are sponsorships of the pilot, linked solely and exclusively to him continuing in his position , because otherwise they would abandon the investment in the team and go to the new destination that Checo had. The list is endless, and you can add Banorte, Kit-Kat, Jalisco, ESPN and even Uber.\n\nHorner is in charge of the sporting direction and Marko is in charge of the youth team and the RB and Red Bull drivers, but the top boss, since the death of Dieter Mateschitz, is none other than the president and majority shareholder of the company, Chaleo Yoovidhya .\n\nAnd in this sense the accounts are more than clear. **The brands that Checo is associated with pay his salary of more than 10 million dollars and leave an amount in the Red Bull suitcases that could be around double that, something similar to 30 million dollars in total.** In addition, the Jalisco native contributes decisively to filling four circuits on the current calendar, Miami, Austin, Mexico and Las Vegas, in addition to having behind him a dedicated country with 128 million people and a very vast potential market.\n\n\nAnd betting on Liam Lawson is betting on someone from a small country, like New Zealand, without significant sponsors, who has to be paid, even if it's little. And sportingly, he may be as far or further away than Checo from Verstappen with this RB20. In fact, the Kiwi has tested in the simulator with that car, like Tsunoda or Ricciardo and none of the three surpassed the Mexican's lap times on board a car difficult to control. That was leaked this summer and was decisive for Checo to continue in his seat."", 'El Toro Rojo', 'Shame that marketing decides the driver in one of the top 3 teams.', ""Checo, P1 in ball cap sales.\n\nTeam takes third, more wind tunnel time.

There is the fear that the most aggressive oilman could give the manufacturer a performance advantage of between 30 and 50 horsepower. And restrictions are being studied...","['Translation:\n\nF1 has understood that the theme of ‚Äúclean‚Äù fuels can be a huge opportunity to introduce non-polluting gasolines that can give another chance to combustion engines, given that the manufacturers are discovering how the expansion of pure electric on the series product market is terribly more complicated than expected, triggering corporate crises that are deeply shaking some very important brands.\n\nThe FIA had wanted fuel regulations that left the field open to research, in the knowledge that F1 would contribute to the rapid evolution of synthetic and non-fossil-derived petrol, without considering too much that it opened the doors to a possible ‚Äúoil war‚Äù.\n\nManufacturers, in developing new power units, are realizing that having the best engine may not be enough, given that the differences between a more advanced fuel than another could have a performance impact that some estimate to be between 3 and 5%. We are talking about a chemical power that could be worth between 30 and 50 horsepower.\n\nAn enormity if we consider that Renault will leave the Circus because it pays a power deficit on the current unit of about thirty horsepower, that is to say the lowest value of the range. The teams are discovering that the oil companies (Aramco, Petronas, Shell, ExxonMobil, BP) are proceeding with a ‚Äúrearmament‚Äù with dedicated budgets that for some are astronomical and others more limited. The effect is that important differences could be generated, moving what should return to being a championship of power units, a F1 of gasoline.\n\nThe search for chemical additives that can act as effective anti-knock agents, allowing for higher compression ratios in combustion engines, is leading some groups to seek partnerships with small, ultra-specialized centers capable of coming up with novel solutions.\n\nIt should not be surprising that in the budget cap of engines the cost of a liter of e-fuel was calculated at 200 euros. This figure is to be drastically reduced (150 euros?), introducing important bans on additive substances. Those who are more advanced in the development of new fuels will try not to get to the point of imposing stringent constraints, but it is becoming increasingly clear that without restrictions we could find ourselves as in 2014, at the start of the hybrid era, with an unchallenged and unchallenged domination of Mercedes.', 'There\'s just no such thing as zero emission fuels.

1gnnzfy,"Into the Buxtonverse: following up on Will's predictions of the 2025 grid, four years later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnnzfy/into_the_buxtonverse_following_up_on_wills/,2024-11-10, Discussion,"During the 2021 summer break, Formula One published [a prediction](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/buxton-my-just-for-fun-prediction-of-what-the-2025-f1-grid-will-look-like.5ngS2W3xboKjYqmOubDVhM) by u/willbuxton of which drivers would form the 2025 F1 grid and where they would drive. Will assured the reader that it was just for fun and implored them not to take it too seriously, so I've decided to create an in-depth analysis.

First up, what he got right: 9 of the 20 drivers, with correct teams for 3 of them.

|Driver + Team correctly predicted|Driver correctly predicted to be on grid (predicted team)|
|:-|:-|
|Max Verstappen - Red Bull|Lando Norris (Red Bull)|
|Charles Leclerc - Ferrari|Carlos Sainz (Ferrari)|
|George Russell - Mercedes|Pierre Gasly (McLaren)|
||Liam Lawson (Aston Martin)|
||Esteban Ocon (Alpine)|
||Andrea Kimi Antonelli (Williams)|

The prediction of Ferrari keeping their LEC-SAI lineup for a 5th straight season deserves praise. That was a bold call given that Sainz had only completed half a season with Ferrari and had never spent even 3 full seasons with a team in his career, and it took a black swan event to keep it from coming true.

I also respect the predictions of Antonelli and Lindblad being on the grid, keeping in mind that both of them were still karting at the time. Antonelli will be on the grid in '25 while the Lindblad prediction may end up being off by only 1 year if Lindblad performs in F2 next year like he did in F3 this year. Also, by predicting Lindblad to be on the grid in '25, Will implicitly predicted that the 18-year-old age restriction would be relaxed or lifted, which did indeed happen in our timeline.

Finally, I think Seb's retirement took quite a few people by surprise in our timeline, while Will seemed to have seen it coming and was only off by 1 year in predicting it.

Okay, nice job with those predictions Will. Now let's take a look at some that didn't pan out:

|Drivers whose career ends were incorrectly predicted|Drivers predicted to be on the grid whose F1 careers ended prior to 2025|Predicted drivers who never entered Formula 1 as of 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fernando Alonso|Mick Schumacher|Pato O'Ward|
|Lewis Hamilton|Nyck De Vries|Theo Pourchaire|
|Lance Stroll||Dennis Hauger|
|Oscar Piastri||Jamie Chadwick|
|Alex Albon||Arthur Leclerc|
|Sergio Perez||Kyle Kirkwood|
|Yuki Tsunoda||Zane Maloney|
|Nico Hulkenberg||Arvid Lindblad|

As you can see, there are quite a few drivers whose careers ended by 2025 in the Buxtonverse but not here. While there was a brief ""rookie winter"" in our timeline where teams heavily valued experience, teams in the Buxtonverse were eager to give new talent a shot.

Another interesting note: Oscar Piastri's and Theo Pourchaire's fortunes are almost mirror images of each other's in the Buxtonverse. There, Alonso (still driving for Alpine) retires mid-season 2023 and is replaced by Piastri for the rest of the year, who also keeps the seat for '24. Meanwhile, Pourchaire drives for Alfa/Sauber in '23 and '24 and replaces Piastri at Alpine in '25 (it's implied that his French nationality plays a part), with Piastri failing to find a '25 seat. The two of them had finished 1-2 in F3, separated by 4 points, the year before the prediction was published and it seems Will put a lot of stock in Theo's youth and inferior machinery.

# Championship Predictions

|Year|WDC|WCC|WCC-P2|WCC-P3|WCC-P4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024|Lando Norris (Red Bull)|Red Bull|McLaren|Mercedes|Ferrari|
|2023|Max Verstappen (Red Bull)|Ferrari|Red Bull|?|Mercedes|
|2022|Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)|Mercedes|Ferrari|?|?|

Will was correct in predicting that the top teams of '21 would still be the top teams going into '25. But he didn't foresee Red Bull's utter dominance of the middle third of the new regulations or Mercedes' struggles with them.

# Miscellaneous Predictions

> Williams have regained momentum and form under the new regulations, picking up podiums and pride.

Not exactly.



>Aston Martin have had a rollercoaster few years. The change in regulation wasn‚Äôt kind to the team, dropping them to ninth in 2022, but steady progress in 2023 and 2024 has brought them back up to a competitive space for 2025.  
...  
In 2024 (...) fifth in the constructors‚Äô championship

This is kind of accurate?



>¬†Schumacher moved to Alfa Romeo in 2023 after a second season with Haas in 2022 failed to live up to expectations.

In a way, that 2nd part came true.



>AlphaTauri remained unchanged in 2022 and rocketed to 5th in the constructors‚Äô championship. At season‚Äôs end Yuki Tsunoda made way for Liam Lawson and another solid season brought the team home in sixth.

>But Gasly‚Äôs defection to McLaren for 2024 left an open door and into it stepped the impressive Dennis Hauger, fresh from the F3 title in 2021 and the F2 crown in 2023 to race alongside Lawson into 2024.

‚ë¥ The aftermath of Azerbaijan is where the ‚Äúfraud alert‚Äù insults against Albon began to circulate because Colapinto, on paper, out qualified him in just his second race. Completely ignoring the fact that both drivers made it into Q3 but the only reason Albon wasn't able to complete an additional lap is because his mechanics left a cooling fan atop his car. Despite this, Colapinto still finished the race behind Albon and has yet to still out-qualify him sans extenuating circumstances.

‚ëµ Albon was forced to retire after lap 5 due to cooling/PU issue.

‚ë∂ Bottas collided with Albon, damaging Albon's front wing and diffuser. They were able to fix his wing at a premature pitstop but could do nothing about diffuser that cost him the race.

‚ë∑ Albon was caught in a lap 1 racing incident with Gasly and Tsunoda. Colapinto would receive a 10 second time penalty and 2 penalty points for his incident with Liam Lawson.

‚ë∏ Albon had a crash due in qualifying due to an engine failure that yes, James Vowles later confirmed was true. The damage being extensive enough that he was unable to start the race at all. Colapinto would crash in qualifying and later in the race behind a safety car.

**COMMENTARY**



Many have said that Alex is ‚Äúfeeling the pressure‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing outperformed‚Äù by Franco which is why I thought it importent to outline the outcome of all races involving them because neither of these things are true and I feel as if Alex Albon is being unfairly maligned by those who seemingly begin watching the sport last night. Colopinto: 

‚Ä¢ has yet to out-qualify ALB by his own merit. 

‚Ä¢ has been unable to get into Q3 in three of his six races while his teammate has, and in each of these occasions he couldn't manage a Q2 entry either. 

‚Ä¢ has only managed to capitalize on **one** P10 point finish out of **four** of his teammates compromised races.

‚Ä¢ has racked up 2 penalty points, of which Albon & Sargeant managed to steer clear of all season.


And while we didn't include Sprints here, I want to further note that Logan Sargeant managed a higher Sprint finish this season in Miami (P10) compared to Franco's P12 finish in Austin, which is notable because the former managed to do so in a significantly overweight car.

What all of this ùò•ùò∞ùò¶ùò¥ùòØ'ùòµ mean is that Franco is a poor driver by any stretch. What it ùò•ùò∞ùò¶ùò¥ mean, however, is that the idea that Franco is a second coming of Senna who's even close to beating his teammate in all metrics is categorically false and I'll no longer be gaslit about it.

It was Albon who gave Williams their highest race & sprint finish of the season, both of which occurred ùò¢ùòßùòµùò¶ùò≥ Colopinto joined the team.

Franco came in just as Williams delivered another upgrade and so far has shown himself to be standard rookie making standard mistakes and standard bouts of promise, but by all this accounts this means that he ùò©ùò¢ùò¥ùòØ'ùòµ exceeded expectations as the metric for that would be beating his teammate, which I feel I've sufficiently shown isn't true.

I open this up for discussion but want to reiterate that the topic is not about Alex Albon's season as a whole nor an opinion on whether or not Colapinto deserves a seat. This is strictly about the rather baseless claim that's in the title.


‚Äî Points finish stats were taken from [here](https://www.formula1.com/en/results/2024/races)

‚Äî I will update this post at the end of the season and if comments are fruitful ai will then make another post to discuss all 9 of Franco's races with this post as a reference. ","[""I think we can agree that Colapinto has exceeded our expectations of him by far no? I mean he's close to Albon or at least closer than Sargeant has been."", 'For a rookie with his experience against Albon who was/is considered to be one of the more promising drivers on the grid, Colapinto is performing very very well.', ""I don't disagree and I think the pace difference between the two is bigger than some people think. However Colapinto looks talented enough for F1 and clearly outperformed Logan and Albon has also had a few mistakes since Colapinto joined. Although some of the mistakes weren't entirely Albons fault. Bearman was potentially to blame for their crash and it's possible the brakes gave up in Brazil. But he also had just done 2 purple sectors in Brazil.\n\n\nBut I don't think using terms like gaslighting and obscene really help the discourse rather than just presenting the facts\n\n\nF1 fans in general and on Reddit both suffer from recency bias and overeating the under dog. We saw this with Piastri and Norris. And like Norris and Piastri they're both good drivers still, but people tend to put one guy down to pull the other guy up. Cola is just outperfing expectations and I can understand people getting excited about it. He looks a real talent.\n\nEven though Sargent and Latifi were both bad, Alex's consistent battering of them I think is still incredibly impressive. And he only lost his qualifying streak because of the team putting a fan on the car. He'd probably like to be further ahead of Cola than he is but he also might have just had a few weekends not as his best and could bounce back again. It'll definitely be interesting between him and Sainz. I think it might be closer than some people think."", ""I think they're somewhat evenly matched but I do think it's important to note that Colapinto, with no confirmed seat next year, has absolutely nothing to lose and everything to prove meanwhile Alex may be more likely to be mindful of cost cap issues and car development going forward."", 'I think that COL has shown he is good, in 6 races he finished extremely close to ALB, and THATS the important part....nobody expects a rookie to do anything but not crash and to finish races, he has exceeded that in a way that people that dont watch too much of the sport need to put Titles for click bait.   \nTo further aggravate the situation, COL is charismatic and has won a lot of people with his attitude.   \nAll in all i think ALB should be destroying a young rookie with 0 experience, and he is not, and that makes Franco reputation go further up than maybe it would be to the eyes of so many, therefore making this phrases like out-preformed ....which i personally kind of agree in a way. Albono should be winning easy to a rookie. EASY.   \nHe is not, thats why i say ""in a way""...', 'Hi Alex üëãüèª', 'Franco Colapinto has exceeded expectations, that‚Äôs the difference.', 'I think they have been fairly evenly matched. Given that Colapinto has come in mid season with very little private testing I think you can make a reasonable judgement that equates to Colapinto outperforming Albon.', ""I read the title and I correctly guessed the username lol. But let's get into it. Very few people are claiming Franco is outperforming Alex. The main discourse is that Alex hasn't had a good benchmark since leaving Red Bull, as he raced along arguably two of the worst drivers on the grid in recent years. Then a rookie gets called up out of nowhere, and he showed he could be \\*close\\* to Alex very quickly. People are focusing on that mostly, but you've been incredibly defensive about the issue.""]",0,94,0.43,0,84,84,0,94,0.43,0

1gmnca2,[Tobi Gruner] According to our information Qatars souvereign wealth fund is set to buy a minority stake in the Audi F1 team. Talks have been ongoing for months. Audi won't give up control of the team but get fresh money for investments in Hinwil.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gmnca2/tobi_gruner_according_to_our_information_qatars/,2024-11-08, Social Media,,"['This are good News tbh. Lets Not forget that mercs stake on their Team is only 33%.', 'i‚Äôve seen this path before.', '> Formula 1 is booming worldwide. Thanks to cost caps, growing interest from sponsors and increasing income from the sale of rights, the first teams are now operating profitably. Whereas it used to be necessary to invest millions in racing, it will soon be possible to earn real money with Formula 1.\n\n> One consequence of this is that the racing teams are increasing in value. Even small teams such as Haas or Toro Rosso are now valued at over a billion euros. And because this is an illustrious circle of teams that is not so easy to get into from the outside, the trend is even increasing.\n\n> Some racing teams have started to literally capitalize on the development and sell shares. In June 2023, for example, Alpine announced that it had sold 24% of the team to a group of investors including actor Ryan Reynolds, golfer Rory McIlroy, boxer Anthony Joshua and football stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.\n\n> In mid-September, the British website ‚ÄúSky‚Äù reported that the US investment companies HPS and Accel were planning to invest in the Aston Martin Formula 1 team. Between 20 and 25 percent of the shares are to change hands. The deal is expected to increase the valuation of the racing team to at least 1.8 billion euros.\n\n> And according to information from auto motor und sport, Audi is also on the verge of concluding a deal with an investor. The purchase of the Sauber racing team was only completed at the beginning of the year. However, because the value of the racing team has already risen considerably since the deal was concluded, Audi can now really cash in.\n\n> Rumor has it that a suitable partner has already been found. The Qatar sovereign wealth fund wants to acquire a minority stake in the new works team. The emirate already owns shares in Volkswagen and Porsche. Now the billionaire investor from the Middle East is investing its money in the premier class for the first time.\n\n> The fresh money is likely to be used by Audi to further expand the Hinwil site. Here, the increase in personnel and infrastructure has not yet been completed. The car manufacturer would therefore not have to draw on its own reserves as a result of the Qatar deal.\n\n> Audi itself did not want to confirm the sale of shares in its F1 racing team. When asked by auto motor und sport, the company merely stated: ‚ÄúWe are not involved in speculation. The team is not for sale.‚Äù However, the sale of a minority share would not be ruled out.\n\n> Even if it is not clear how high the sold share is, Audi will certainly retain control and not allow itself to be talked into decisions. According to our information, the negotiations began some time ago and are not a reaction to the current economic situation.\n\n> Managing Director Gernot D√∂llner said back in September at the race in Monza that the team‚Äôs involvement was not in question and was a long-term decision: ‚ÄúThe decision was well prepared two and a half years ago and reassessed last year. We are firmly convinced that Formula 1 and Audi are a perfect match. It is in line with our strategy.‚Äù\n\n> The deal with Qatar could also be lucrative for Audi beyond the pure investment. The direct connection naturally opens up numerous opportunities at sponsor level. Qatar Airways is already active as a series partner in Formula 1. It is quite possible that the airline‚Äôs logos will soon be seen on the racing cars from Hinwil.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)', 'Why do so many teams like selling minority stakes ? their value rises every year, it seems so shortsighted.', 'You put in the oil money and then it becomes green, you see?', 'gonna post every article from every reporter out there about something already posted?']",3,6,0.67,3,6,6,3,6,0.67,3

He didn't put a foot wrong in Hungary 2021 when Vettel was in his DRS for 60+ laps. Later that year in Jeddah, he again made no mistakes while at the front and only lost the podium because he [lost a piece of his floor with 2 laps to go](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ocon-floor-damage-cost-me-in-saudi-f1-podium-battle-with-bottas/6856759/), before that he was almost matching Bottas' times.

For some reason Ocon gets too aggressive with his teammates a few times which simply feels self destructive imo. \n\nOcon and Gasly are easily the 5th best lineup on the grid and both are highly credible midfield drivers that can take advantage of chaos and score a podium or even a win when the rare opportunity arises for them both. \n\nIt is a pity for most of the season they haven‚Äôt had a better car to showcase their talents, but I‚Äôm glad they both capitalized on it beautifully at Brazil.', 'He‚Äôs not one of the only ones, but he‚Äôs definitely good at it.\n\nNo chance he was going to win though.

The cameras zoom in excessively and are constantly moving. This makes it nearly impossible to distinguish the car from the background. It's really difficult to understand what the car is doing‚Äîwhether it's sliding or running wide. Sometimes it's even dizzying because all I can see is a fragment of a moving car.

You can better understand what I mean by watching older F1 videos. Here's an example:

Prior to that stopping made sense as Norris also stopped and George would have still come out on fresh tyres ahead of all the cars behind.\xa0 Shovlin says normally they try not to assume that it\'ll get red flagged because if you stay out and don\'t get a red flag, you\'re in trouble. Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you get it wrong and this time the cars that gambled got what they wanted.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What were the issues with the brakes that both drivers complained about?\xa0\n\n\nA: George said the brake disc felt like they had ""warped"" but they didn\'t. There can be higher friction in some areas that can create vibrations that the drivers can feel through the pedals. They are still investigating but think it could be due to the very cold temperatures, as the brakes were fine in the dry and other drivers also complained about brake vibrations during the race. George thinks it was costing 2 or 3 tenths a lap.\n\n\n- Q: Lewis was particularly struggling with the car. In general how challenging is it to make sure the setup suits both drivers\' demands?\xa0\n\n\nA: Normally you\'re able to do it, they let the drivers deviate with the setup, evolve their own setup and when one of them appears to be going well you often take some elements or even the whole lot and put it on the other car.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0Lewis was mainly struggling with rear grip, in the sprint for example he had snaps of oversteer, which overheats the tyres and prolongs the issue. The difference between the sprint (hot and dry) and the race (cold and wet) made it difficult to get the car where he wanted.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What about adjusting the tyres pressure on the grid and the subsequent penalty?\n\n\nA: When they got the message for the restart, there was only 10 minutes to go, and the tyres must be on the car with 5 to go (serious penalty if you break that rule says Shovlin). The pitlane layout in Brazil is unsual and makes more difficult for teams to get the car. The tyres they selected hadn\'t been ""bled down"" to race pressures and the penalty was because there wasn\'t time for the FIA checks.\n\n\n$5,000 fine per car, no rules around tyre pressures were broken and no sporting advantage was gained, mitigating factor of not having enough time to bring the tyres and get the checks done.\n\n\n- Q: Did the COTA upgrades perform as expected?\n\n\nA: In terms of loads measured, they\'re seeing what they expect and where they expect in terms of ride height range. In the wet the car worked well in quali (front row) and in the race, particularly the first stint with George. However in the dry they have issues in slow speed, particularly when one corner follows another and a lot of turning is required.\xa0\n\n\nThe aim of those upgrades wasn\'t to fix that but to lift the base performance of the car, which is what they\'re doing. They know they still have some fundamentals to tackle in order to fix them on the W16, which they\'re very busy with at the moment.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What learnings for the W16 and how will the team prepare for the rest to the season?\xa0\n\n\nA: The main weakness has been the same, the interconnected slow corners like sector 2 in Brazil. They\'ll keep working on that in the next races. The final three races will be useful to assess performance, determine who is the benchmark between Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren and establish the gap that needs to be closed down over the winter.\xa0', 'Thank you for the write-up']",4,2,0.75,4,2,2,4,2,0.75,4
1gl947i,Drivers at Risk - F1 2025 Edition,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl947i/drivers_at_risk_f1_2025_edition/,2024-11-06, Discussion,"With five new rookies coming in, it means we're losing a wealth of experience on the Grid... KMag - Bottas - Ricciardo - Sargeant - Zhou started the season in Bahrain, whilst none of them will be in Australia next year (Perez could of course join those names) - Quite ironic really, we didnt get a single change to the Grid at the start of this season, whilst next year feels a proper changing of the guard.

The question now... Which Drivers are next to be at risk of losing their seats, and could potentially depart F1 - As lets be honest, there are probably just a few (Verstappen - Alonso - Leclerc - Hamilton - Norris - Piastri - Stroll) which are guaranteed to be safe.

Think the obvious names that need to be concerned are: Ocon - Hulkenberg - Albon - Tsunoda, maybe even Gasly

The two unexpected are: Russell and Sainz

The Rookies: Lawson - Doohan - Colapinto (if he joins Racing Bulls)

\-------------------

**Ocon** and **Hulkenberg** are obviously with new teams, with the former going backwards, whilst Hulkenberg could be safer what with being a German in a German team; **Albon** needs to prove he can beat his teammate, given he's struggled against Colapinto at times, so Sainz will be a stern test... **Tsunoda** it feels he's only with Racing Bulls because of the Honda links, and will need to rely on weak feeder campaigns from Lindblad and Hadjar.

Gasly on the other hand, feels like he'll slowly enter Ocon / Albon territory but be surprised if he left.

\-------------------

Then you've got the unexpected; I've mentioned **Russell** because of the endless Verstappen > Mercedes links, I'd be surprised if Russell left F1 and didnt find another seat at least - Same with **Sainz**, he's gone backwards on the Grid, and if he struggles to perform (which I cant see happening), he wont fall upwards... Would be very surprised if that happened.

\-------------------

Then we've got the rookies; **Lawson** and / or **Colapinto** (if he joins Racing Bulls), simply because they're in the Red Bull family, we know how cut-throat they are if performances aren't up to their standard, plus again there is the prospect of Lindblad and / or Hadjar entering F1 - **Doohan**, I'll be interested to see how he does, was solid in F2 but doesnt feel like teams have rushed to give him an opportunity, might also be at risk if Mini impresses in F2 next season; **Antonelli** \- **Bearman** \- **Bortoleto** I suspect will be fine; Bearman might be at risk, but think his Ferrari backing will help him for a second year, worst case scenario.

So thoughts, all a bit of fun of course - But who come next season do you think we might be waving Goodbye to?

Naturally depends as well, if there is another option to replace said Driver who isn't performing to expected standard.","[""George Russell went head to head with arguably the greatest to ever do it and is going to come out relatively even.  If merc let Russell go he'd be in the Red Bull 2nd seat tomorrow."", 'Apart from the incomprehensible clusterfuck that are the RB line-ups these days, I think Doohan seems the obvious pick. He doesn‚Äôt have the hype of the other rookies behind him so if he doesn‚Äôt impress he could be replaced by a more promising prospect. The rest I think are pretty safe. Maybe Albon if he gets really dominated by Sainz and Williams think Colapinto is a better choice.\xa0', 'Why Gasly ? He has a multiple years contact and is Alpine main guy', 'How would Russell be at more risk than Alonso? (jokes about his longevity aside)', ""I think Albon will be fine. \n\nSometimes I think people forget the praise for his performance isn't always in comparison to his teammate. Everyone knew he was better than the likes of Latifi and Sargeant, his driving has still be great when going wheel to wheel with other people. He also seems to have a really good relationship with Vowles and the team. I can see him being there for a few more years"", 'Not sure why you put Alonso as safe. His performance last year was truly impressive, but this year not so much. I know it can be a motivation problem, but I can also imagine he is getting slower with age and if Aston gets more competitive and becomes more attractive of a destination, Alonso could be replaced. \n\nAnd if Aston really makes a top 3 car, maybe, just maybe, it will be time for Lance to move on as well. He is clearly not good enough to make a difference when competing with top teams, so if Stroll senior has to choose between potentially winning WCC/WDC and having his son in the team, maybe he hires someone better?', 'I think with Albon this is make or break. Either he looks good next to Sainz, or it‚Äôs his last contract. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll go before the end of his contract though.\n\nOcon I think is fairly safe. Haas will want that dependable consistency, and having a rookie teammate will help keep his head cool. He‚Äôs a hard worker and it‚Äôll serve him well. I also think the move will motivate him.\n\nI suspect Gasly is far safer than you think. He‚Äôs solid, has good relationships with the people who matter in Alpine (De Meo and Flavio), and he‚Äôs also the last french thing in the french national team. He also doesn‚Äôt really crash, which is important in the cost cap.\n\nHulk signed for a long time, because Audi needs that experience to build off. Again, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll go unless he wants to.\n\nBearman I think Haas (or the FDA) really want to develop. He‚Äôll be safe as long as he shows some speed and keeps the crash damage down, they‚Äôll trust Ocon to do the heavy lifting.\n\nDoohan I think is at risk. They only have a one year deal with him. They seem to have mainly signed him because they couldn‚Äôt get Sainz. He‚Äôs also not really shown the kind of qualifying pace we‚Äôve got from Gasly. \n\nTsunoda I unfortunately agree is at risk. Red Bull don‚Äôt want to promote him, they have juniors they want to get in (Hadjar now, Lindblad is a Marko fav) and the Honda deal is ending. Unless he can negotiate a move in the place of a kicked junior (not as easy as you think - why would Alpine have him when they know Gasly had him beat heavily last time?), he‚Äôs going to struggle.\n\nLawson is at risk for the same reason as Tsunoda. If he‚Äôs not beating Tsunoda, Helmut has juniors waiting in the wings. Also I suspect his contract will have whatever break clauses allowed Ricciardo to be booted in Singapore. There‚Äôs provisions there.', 'I think Colapinto is at risk sadly. I hope Perez will be out of the RB next season.\n\nAnd Tsunoda is a possible out but might just hang on.', 'I think it will be quite a safe year for drivers as teams want stability going into the 2026 regulation change. Most drivers Hulk, Ocon, Gasly, Albon have multi year contracts and other than Hadjar, maybe Lindblad (Mini + Browning too if they win) there aren‚Äôt really any drivers in F2 that I think the F1 academies feel particularly sentimental about. The F3 champion didn‚Äôt win any races so I don‚Äôt think the teams think of him.']",0,37,0.33,0,36,36,0,37,0.33,0

Take the timings from the last active racing lap and remove the average pit time from anyone that decides to change tyres under a red flag. This is then your new grid for a restart.

  
I think it'd be the fairest solution as it also takes into account drivers who had built up large gaps to the car behind. There'd also be some strategy to it as you wouldn't just automatically change tyres.



The only downside i can think is teams trying to play mind games by changing tyres at the last possible second before a restart, but that could be avoided by mandating tyre changes within a certain time frame when the race has stopped.","[""The red flag tyre change rule is fine as is. It is the way it is for safety reasons. You don't want cars driving through debris after a red flag worthy incident and then send them out on dodgy tyres."", 'Teams are allowed to change tyres under a red flag because teams are allowed to work on cars in general under red. It\'s allowed because teams may need to repair damage like changing wings or like after Bottas went bowling in Hungary 2021 Red Bull mechanics did their best to patch up Verstappen\'s floor and sidepod. Are you going to account for that too or only tyres? It takes a lot longer to swap a front wing out in a pit stop. And how do you account for VSC, SC, differing pitlane lengths and who knows what other factors I\'m not even thinking of right now. Should drivers be forced to stop longer when they pit under SC or VSC? Because that\'s an ""unfair"" advantage as well.\n\nOr you just don\'t make up a lot of complicated new rules that are going to introduce new scenarios that are unfair anyway and just accept that sometimes things aren\'t perfectly fair and it\'s just part of racing.', 'I honestly don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any unfairness to getting a free tyre change during a red flag. It‚Äôs all part of the strategy. Sometimes the red flag helps and sometimes it hurts. I think this rule is fine as it is.', 'Why only for Red Flag ? Pitting under SC/VSC should also give a time penalty to equalize pitstop times then. But then you basically punish a driver who managed his tyres well and could go on longer waiting for SC opportunity.', 'I think the red flag situation is fine as it is. If we want to get rid of people having advantage because of red flags, will we also reinstate gaps after we go racing? If P3 is 20s behind P2, P3 also gets an unfair advantage during red flag because the 20s is reset to 0.  \nIt\'s all part of the game and strategy. The more ""fair"" we will try it to make, the more rules we need to create. The more rules, the more grey areas, the more complicated and the more inconsistent steward decisions.\n\nAlso, changing anything on the car during red flag is also for safety reasons.', 'Ah Verstappen gained from a Red Flag, we must discuss it and change it. \n\nWhen anyone else gains from a Red Flag, it is all part of the game. \n\n\nIt is getting a bit predictable.', ""We had a rule that you couldn't change tyres under a red flag (outside of safety issues). That was dumb, and was changed.

You don't want people restarting on potentially damaged tyres or on the wrong kind of tyres. \n\nIt's also part of strategy. If there's a high likelihood of a safety car/red flag, teams try to stay out as long as they can to profit from it.

Up and down staircases, walking for kilometres along the circuits. Van Egmond has had surgery on both knees. He used to work for McLaren but has long since been employed by Red Bull, not having missed a race for twelve seasons. Until he got the bad news last winter: an eight centimetre tumour on his left kidney. Surgery followed, but the bad news kept on coming. The cancer had spread. Immunotherapy and heavy prednisone medications followed. Despite that, Van Egmond travelled to Brazil on Wednesday to show his face in the paddock and, for just a little bit, get back to his work for Red Bull.\n\n**Emotional**  \n‚ÄúIt might sound soft, but on the way to Schiphol \\[airport\\] I got pretty emotional. I missed this, being part of this world. If I were a normal photographer, I might feel less strongly about my absence. But I feel appreciated and part of the team‚Äù, says Van Egmond, one of the most beloved photographers in the paddock.\n\n‚ÄúIt feels like I have two families, at home and here‚Äù\n\nThe appreciation he feels comes from Red Bull. Financial, but on a different level too. ‚ÄúDuring the summer break, I got sent a shirt with autographs from everyone on the race team. And at Zandvoort I quickly visited and got surprised with a watch by Max. It feels like I have two families, at home and here. I have always loved going to races, but also to return homeward on Sunday afternoon. But I have never felt reluctant to go. Formula 1 has been such a big part of my life. I‚Äôm just not done yet.

I‚Äôve been at home a lot more all of a sudden. That turned out to not be as hard as I expected. Although my wife did start to work more‚Ä¶‚Äù, says van Egmond, smiling. And then he continues, in a serious manner: ‚ÄúI will not be declared clean \\[from the cancer\\]. There are three options: it could become worse, stay stable, or turn out a little bit better. If this goes well, I hope to attend roughly eight races next year. But I have to be honest with myself and see this weekend as a trial run. Maybe I‚Äôll fail miserably.

McLaren adapted better to the Interlagos circuit and had greater potential than Ferrari, with an SF-24 that struggled more in the long corners, as Carlos Sainz explained, but above all in the wet. Having lost a few points, even finishing ahead of the two MCL38s in the race, was important, even though Carlos Sainz\'s accident resulted in a zero. Frederic Vasseur does not budge from his position: ""We don\'t look at the standings. Honestly, I don\'t even know what the points gap is. We have to keep our approach of looking at it race by race, without doing calculations . ""\n\n\n\nVasseur: ‚ÄúMade a mistake with Charles‚Äô pit stop. These are difficult weekends even for those who are at the pitwall‚Äù\n\n\nAfter Qatar, Interlagos was the track where Ferrari expected to have the most problems against McLaren, and so it was. The Prancing Horse men did not hit the right window for the SF-24 both in the dry and especially in the wet, where Frederic Vasseur spoke several times of a difficulty in managing the tyre pressures , which then penalised the drivers a lot, both in Qualifying and in the race. ‚ÄúThese weekends are difficult to manage both on the track, for the drivers, and from the pit wall. It is a matter of making choices that then anticipate the conditions that you will find in Qualifying and the race. It was a difficult Sunday, but all in all not dramatic for us ,‚Äù declared the Ferrari Team Principal. A lot happened during the race, between changes in conditions, rain showers and yellow flags (and one red) and this also caused strong variations in performance: ‚ÄúWe were 6-7 tenths slower than Norris at the beginning of the stint, but then we were quicker at the end‚Äù .\n\n\nThe accident and subsequent departure from the pitlane by Carlos Sainz left Ferrari with only one car in the top of the standings, in a situation that was not easy to manage. In particular, Charles Leclerc paid for a pit stop that, in hindsight, turned out to be too hasty. ‚ÄúIt\'s easy to talk about it afterwards. It would certainly have been right to stay out waiting for the red flag, but if you crash in the meantime, you still become the stupid one,‚Äù said the French manager. After the race, Charles Leclerc immediately took some responsibility for the non-ideal car setup, but Vasseur intervened, also talking about the strategy adopted on the Monegasque : ‚Äú He is not responsible for the setup . He is always the first to take the blame, but that is not the case here. For the pit stop, we underestimated the threat of Bearman and Hamilton , who overtook us, because we lost precious tenths when exiting the pitlane which is very slippery . But this aspect would not have changed our race much . ‚Äù\n\n\nVasseur: ‚ÄúFerrari will come back strong in Las Vegas and we will have to take advantage of the opportunity‚Äù\n\n\nThe wet weekend certainly affected the performance of the SF-24, which has never managed to be as competitive as Red Bull and McLaren (or even Alpine), even though it finished ahead of Norris and Piastri, but it is impossible to know how it would have gone on dry surfaces. ‚ÄúI think we would have been closer, but it is difficult to say, there are so many variables such as setup and tyre management. We would still be talking about differences of 1-2 tenths,‚Äù said the Team Principal of the Prancing Horse. It is time to turn the page and wait for Las Vegas, the next GP on the calendar, which will open another, the last, hat-trick, after a 2-week break in which the teams will work and prepare for the end of the season as best as possible, even if, as Vasseru says, ‚ÄúWe are already focused on next year\'s project. New parts? Yes, spare parts after this weekend ,‚Äù he said, letting out a laugh.\n\n\nExpectations for the American GP are important, especially since the SF-24 is in good form, excels in slow corners and has improved efficiency with the latest developments. ‚ÄúLast year we were very strong and I expect we can do well again this year.‚Äù In Maranello they were aware that Interlagos would put them in greater difficulty against McLaren and all in all they managed to minimize the damage over the weekend. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to lose as few points as possible, I want to fight to get more. Las Vegas will be a place where we will have to try to make a splash ourselves,‚Äù said Vasseur in the post-race. In all this, a lively Carlos Sainz is also expected to return, after his victory in Mexico and a weekend to forget in Brazil, with accidents in qualifying and the race. ‚Äú There is time to do a complete reset now. Last year he had that accident in FP1 in Vegas and I was worried about how he could face the weekend and instead he went very well, so I am not worried about Carlos, he will come back strong! ‚Äù.', ""We all expect McLaren to dominate Qatar because of the highspeed nature of the track and we've all been assuming that Ferrari will do well in Vegas because of their performance this year in Monza (won by strategy but they had great pace), Baku, and COTA."", ""Yeah, the wet race helped Ferrari in a way - not pace wise since they were nowhere in the wet either, but with upsetting McLaren's momentum. McLaren were clearly the fastest car in the dry and probably would've finished 1-2 had the race been dry, essentially sealing the constructors.\n\nInstead, all McLaren have got from Interlagos is a minimal gain to Ferrari.\n\nIf Ferrari can take another win at Vegas, then it's all to play for in the WCC. Especially with McLaren's tendency to bottle and choke this year."", 'I\'m really appreciative of Leclerc\'s performance in Brazil, as it\'s the only reason Ferrari are still in the WCC. A double DNF would have been disastrous and not out of the question; Leclerc sounded really stressed at the end of the race, talking about how difficult the car was to drive. Vasseur said point black ""we chose the completely wrong setup because we expected different weather conditions.""\n\nSainz has been so inconsistent since the summer break. Either one of the absolute best drivers on the grid that weekend, or nowhere. Track trying to kill him aside, he was great at Vegas last year and I think the WCC is still on if him and Leclerc can string together a series of respectable performances and get at least one win. Qatar is not an option for that, so they need to focus on how they can make themselves competitive in Vegas and AD.', 'Ferrari lost 7 points this weekend to McLaren when expecting Ferrari to be much weaker than to McLaren is not too bad.

While I undertand Max' career isn't over or 'complete' yet, who do you think has the bigger legacy? Who of these two is the greater driver, and will go down in history a such? And why?

Statiscally, Max has more wins than Seb, whereas Seb has more poles than Max. Max holds a lot of the 'youngest' records, but Vettel stil holds the youngest WDC record. Both hold a decent amount of other records as well or at least are close (Max' ten win streak vs Seb's nine win streak) etc. Both have had iconic drives, wins against the odds and utter domination.

I just want to clear up a apparent misunderstanding of how the red flag actually benefited Verstappen in today's win. 

It all starts in lap 27 when Hulkenberg got stuck somewhere on turn 1, after the rain got increasingly more intense. Norris already asked a few times to be pit, since the intermediates from the start are getting more worn for most of the grid, which means less grip and a harder time for all of them to keep the car on track. 

# Lap 28/29 

Both of the leaders dive into the pit to try and get a cheap pit stop under the VSC conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/itpieu32bryd1.png?width=2472&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0a709e49f502ae77a817621aa7253fc60bc945

Gap back to Verstappen is about 19 seconds under the VSC conditions. Gap in racing conditions before the VSC was called was about 13 seconds. As seen in the photo, the VSC was ending when both of them came into the pit. 

# Lap 30 

Both of them have pitted, but notably they have both pitted on new intermediates instead of wet weather tires. The gap is now 13 seconds in favor of Verstappen. During all of this the rain intensity is at the peak of the race, and the conditions would call for wet tires, as shown by Tsunoda. He was about 17 seconds back from the lead pair at the point of pitting. He did however pit himself and at lap 30 he was already only 7 seconds back. 

https://preview.redd.it/4npm87owcryd1.png?width=2438&format=png&auto=webp&s=a445efc8f6f9dedb410d3ddcf976266c4ba36dc6

About 10 seconds after the above screenshot a safety car is called, since the conditions are about to be undrivable. Tsunoda in a timespan of about 10 seconds made up 4 whole seconds on his wet tires.

# Lap 32 

After a few laps behind the safety car, Colapinto find the wall and the Red Flag is called. The order under the red flag does not change.

# So how did the red flag benefit Verstappen? 

(This is the opinionated part, so please discuss if you think different) 

  
The real benefit of the red flag to Verstappen and a lot of the grid behind is obviously the free pit stop. However, the positions from Norris and Russell are arguably already won when they decided to pit under the VSC for new intermediate tires. 

If the red flag, or safety car had not been called they would have lost time to anyone that pitted for wet tires. Its in my opinion very likely that they would have had to pit again under the conditions we have seen, and with the wet tire runners so much faster. 

If there was only the safety car called, Verstappen would be in front of them anyway. In this case I think a few different things could have happened depending on the rain intensity. Whats most likely is that Verstappen would have tried to stay out as long as possible on his old intermediates, unsure if they can make the whole race, but it would have been interesting to see, especially since it would have taken a long time to clear enough standing water for a rolling restart, so I think the remaining laps under speed would have been about \~30 laps, but probably less, since it was raining a lot. 

In any case, I think the red flag was not the deciding factor for Verstappen today, but Red Bulls and Verstappens choice to stay out and not switch tires. 

Norris and Russell got new intermediates, so that was a gamble from them on a safety car as well, since there was no way to drive on anything other than wets at that point, and they would be dropped behind Ocon, Gasly and Verstappen. Really unsure what that strategy call was.

# The Brazilian Grand Prix



**Sprint Qualifying / Sprint Race:**

P1. Oscar Piastri / Lando Norris

P2. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri

P3. Charles Leclerc / Charles Leclerc



**Qualifying / Grand Prix:**

P1. Lando Norris / Max Verstappen

P2. George Russell / Esteban Ocon

P3. Yuki Tsunoda / Pierre Gasly



***LWIF1‚Äôs Reaction:***

Thanks to checking my fantasy results before tucking into the race, I had the ‚Äòpleasure‚Äô of waiting for all the moments that would result in my losing nine million in team value‚ÄîCarlos, Franco, and Williams‚Ä¶ Thank you very much.

Personal entanglement with the Brazilian GP‚Äôs results aside, *what a day* in S√£o Paulo that was. Watching a chaotic qualy feed directly into an even more chaotic race was a lovely way to close out the Americas triple-header.

While the WDC isn‚Äôt clinched yet, I daresay this race was more or less the icing on the cake‚ÄîI don‚Äôt see Lando gaining 21 points on Max in each of the remaining rounds. And after a performance like we saw this weekend, I need no further proof that Max has earned what will surely be his 4th title.

***Personal highlights from Brazil include:***

* Yuki-san locking down a top 10 finish‚Ä¶
* A much-deserved double podium for Alpine‚Ä¶
* And witnessing a wet weather Maxterclass for the ages.

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

***The driving standards and racing rules conversation rolls on‚Ä¶***

*Master Shit-Stirrer* [*Toto Wolff fairly stated that Max‚Äôs previous on-the-edge duelling tactics going unpunished has legitimised his racing*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ge8a29/toto_wolff_past_max_verstappen_f1_clashes_going/)*‚Äîwhich we‚Äôre now seeing the long-term effects of‚Ä¶ And that* [*his penalties \[or lack thereof\] will change how drivers race in F1.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geqmvn/motorsport_wolff_verstappen_penalties_will_change/)

*In case there was any doubt, questionable and inconsistent stewarding is DEFINITELY part of the problem: According to whom in Mexico, Liam defended aggressively against Franco while leaving enough room for him to remain on track.* [*This photo begs to differ‚Ä¶*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ge30is/according_to_the_officials_lawson_defended/)

*According to Mr. George ‚ÄòHead of the GDPA‚Äô Russell,* [*‚Äú19/20 drivers are aligned on F1 racing guideline changes.‚Äù*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdyvba/russell_19_out_of_20_drivers_aligned_on_f1_racing/) *Pray tell! Who could the outlier possibly be?!*

**As for the latest in this never-ending silly season‚Ä¶**

I won‚Äôt post links because there‚Äôs nothing concrete, but the rumour mill has been busy churning out ‚ÄúPerez is out after Brazil‚Äù think-pieces once again, largely based on Christian Horner‚Äôs inability to confirm that Checo will finish the season in his post-Mexico interview. Do with this info what you will.

*(Semi-relatedly,* [*Darth Helmut Mark blames Liam Lawson for his ‚Äúunnecessary collision‚Äù with Perez, and Sith Lord Christian Horner is piling the pressure on Checo*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gesbgh/marko_blames_lawson_for_unnecessary_collision_as/) *to do‚Ä¶ Something, please, anything!)*

Meanwhile, [Perez is defiant that he‚Äôs safe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ggslmb/perez_brazil_gp_interview_about_his_future_you/)

Continuing the Red Bull driver conversation, [paddock rumblings indicate that Red Bull would *love* to swoop in and sign Franco Colapinto for 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gfg301/red_bull_could_reportedly_pay_up_to_20_million_to/) (which would make for an even crazier story for the Argentine). However, Red Bull isn‚Äôt onboard with taking him on ‚Äòloan‚Äô, allegedly wanting him all or nothing‚Äîwhich could result in them shelling out $20 million to Williams.

In the same vein, more ‚ÄòFranco to RBR‚Äô smoke appeared during the Brazilian Grand Prix weekend. Here‚Äôs Exhibits [A](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ghbtfk/argentinian_journalist_that_broke_the_news_of/), [B](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ghc78j/bybit_argentina_under_the_post_of_the_rumorer/), [C](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ghcsez/ummmm/), [D](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gh9qd1/lukesmithf1_on_franco_colapinto_james_vowles_says/) and [E](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gh7vrj/christian_horner_was_seen_leaving_the_williams/). Just imagine the scenes if these smoke signals are coming from a bonfire of truth‚Ä¶ What cinema!

Meanwhile, [Mulletman Valtteri Bottas is still considering Sauberaudi alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gge5ly/f1_ive_got_to_look_at_all_the_alternatives_bottas/) (namely a Mercedes reserve role) should the chips not fall his way.

Which is a move Mr. Bottas might have to make, as [the rumblings of F2 hotshot Gabriel Bortoleto claiming Sauberaudi‚Äôs remaining seat are reaching a fever pitch.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gibgdw/according_to_motorsport_brazil_sauber_signs/) A *lot* of smoke appeared during the Brazilian GP weekend‚Äîand in F1 where there‚Äôs smoke, there‚Äôs usually fire.

Adding fuel to this particular fire, [McLaren Team Principle Andrea Stella stated that McLaren won‚Äôt stop Bortoleto from driving in F1 for another team and that conversations are ongoing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ghan3p/phillip_horton_andrea_stella_says_mclaren_would/) Relatedly and meaningfully, [Bortoleto has apparently resigned from McLaren](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gh00mj/grandepremiocombr_bortoleto_resigns_from_mclaren/) (which *would* partially explain why he wasn‚Äôt given any of McLaren‚Äôs rookie FP1 slots in Austin or Mexico).

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

Ahoy there! [There‚Äôs another Ferrari flag gracing the entrance in Maranello.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdwo8u/yet_another_flag_has_been_added_in_maranello/)

In an interview that‚Äôll warm you deep into the marrow of your bones, Haas‚Äôs rookie team principle [Ayao Komatsu said that securing P6 in his first season as the bossman would mean everything‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gfl3xn/f1_we_never_expected_it_komatsu_says_securing_p6/) And fair enough! Haas has been through the wringer in recent years, and I think they‚Äôve been incredibly resilient in the face of a mountain of ‚Äòcrazy ex‚Äô level problems.

[Sauberaudi has announced that former Ferrari strategist tragedist I√±aki Rueda will join the team as Sporting Director next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gfj9lb/jon_noble_sauber_has_announced_that_former/) Their current SD, Beat Zehnder will shift roles to Director of Signature Programs and Operations. *I will be blunt:* I cannot fathom the decision to hire someone so deeply involved with the absolute clown show that was Ferrari strategy before Freddie V came in and began cleaning house. Have fun with that one, Sauberaudi.

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

For the technically inclined amongst us, here‚Äôs [the FIA‚Äôs official breakdown of all the upgrades brought to the Brazilian Grand Prix.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gh43ju/car_updates_for_the_2024_brazil_grand_prix/)

Wise and kind Redditor u/Worried-Pick4848 [penned this lovely shoutout for Haas‚Äôs Technical Director, Andrea de Zordo.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ge155g/shoutout_to_andrea_de_zordo_haas_technical/) Haas‚Äôs turn in form this year has been nothing short of remarkable, with their *finally* bringing subsequent successful upgrade packages playing a big role. Hats off, Andrea!

[Mercedes have found themselves in a spot of bother thanks to their spate of recent crashes](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gerrmp/f1_wolff_admits_mercedes_w15_is_on_a_knifes_edge/)‚Äîthe bills for which are taking swathes out of their budget.

There seems to be multiple people and sources saying there was ""long time"" between crash and Verstappen dropping out of top 10. Rewatched to confirm. First picture is moment yellow flags are thrown out (graphic isn't even fully shown yet), second one (1 second later) shows Leclerc making into top 10. Only thing Max lost here was p11 to p12 and he already has +5 grid penalty. Biggest loser here was Bottas who was robbed since Albon and Lawson got their times done (Albon when time left 1:09, Lawson when time left 1:03).

Tldr: no, there was less than 1 second for stewards to react for red flag which is basically impossible. Red Bulls dropped because they left themself last.

I'm also on the side that it took them too long to react (50 seconds).","['It doesn‚Äôt matter that Max didn‚Äôt get through, that is bad luck they all experience.

This accusation is, after the end of the 2021 season, potentially justified. However, the discussion has been doing an incredible disservice to the fact that the past few seasons have been an ongoing showcase of a potentially dangerous slowness to deploy Safety Cars, Virtual Safety Cars, or red flags. To educate myself and (hopefully) the rest of the subreddit, I went back and reviewed very SC/VSC intervention so far this season and made note of how long it took the race director to make the decision and neutralize the race. 

  
TL;DR up front, because this is going to be long; the average time this season between an incident occurring and a VSC or SC being deployed is a whopping \*48 seconds.\* 

  
Quick methodology notes up front: I used the very helpful [list of safety car interventions this season](https://www.lightsoutblog.com/every-safety-car-f1-2024/) by Nick Haldenby at Lights Out Blog, and went back to each race with the F1TV feed, the live timing, and a stopwatch. For cars that stopped alongside or on the track, I started the clock at the point when the car stopped moving (assuming that they wouldn't want to intervene in a race if a driver can quickly get moving again). Twice this season we've had VSC's deployed due to debris on the track, at Miami and Austria -- I've chosen not to include these as they would skew the average time calculation. So, here's the list:

  
Saudi Arabia, Lap 6: Stroll into the barriers, 50 seconds

Australia, lap 17: Hamilton stops on track, 20 seconds (from the moment of stoppage -- he did spend a long time trying to limp the car back)

Australia, lap 58: Russell into the barriers, 12 seconds

Japan, lap 1: Albon and Ricciardo collide, 23 seconds (race red-flagged)

China, lap 22: Bottas stops in the runoff, 1 minute 37 seconds (this was the incident reposted today of him exiting his car while standing at the end of the braking zone, under only yellow flags)

China, lap 27: Tsunoda and Magnussen collide, 15 seconds

Miami (sprint), lap 1: Norris and Stroll collide, 58 seconds

Miami, lap 29: Sargeant and Magnussen collide, 24 seconds

Monaco, lap 2: Perez/Hulk/Magnussen collide, 39 seconds (race red-flagged -- had to open Perez' onboard for this to even figure out when the crash occurred)

Canada, lap 25: Sargeant into the barriers, 40 seconds

Canada, lap 54: Sainz and Albon collide, 27 seconds

Azerbaijan, lap 50: Perez and Sainz collide, 1 minute 35 seconds

Austin, lap 2: Hamilton into the gravel, 53 seconds

Mexico, lap 1: Tsunoda into the barrier, 41 seconds

Brazil (sprint), lap 22: Hulkenberg stops on track, 2 minutes 2 seconds

  
The fastest reaction was a mere 12 seconds in Australia, while the longest came yesterday at 2 minutes and 2 seconds. However, that does still leave our average time at 48 seconds for this season. I did not take notes on every incident's on-track battles, but did notice that they didn't seem to favor one team consistently throughout the season. Without inside information that I doubt we'll ever see, it's impossible to know whether the delays are coming from a communications issue, a lack of confidence, or a desire to leave it as late as possible so the racing can continue (a la the old ""Racing back to the caution"" rule that NASCAR rightly did away with in the 2000's). Regardless, this is very clearly an ongoing issue, going back years, Taking longer than 60 seconds to make the decision for intervention should be a rare occasion, and yet we've had 3 such incidents this season.

  
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do the same analysis for the 2023 season yet, but I would like to. Without a convenient pre-made list of SC and VSC interventions, it's a bit more work, but if people would like me to I'll happily keep working on it (I might do anyway, just for my own curiosity). 

  
In parting, this specifically came out of my frustration at seeing people saying things like, ""any other race and they'd have sent the VSC out right away,"" when I clearly remembered this being a pattern of behavior from the officials. It's good to be aware of the potential for issues like that, but in situations like this where driver safety is being potentially placed at risk, it detracts \*HEAVILY\* from a very real, very concerning pattern. ","['Quality post and effort OP. This also reminds me of how long race control took before deploying a safety car back at Baku 2021 for either Stroll or Verstappen‚Äôs retirement when their tires randomly blew up. I remember after the race it was found that multiple drivers ignored the double waved yellows in that section by going significantly faster, yet in the end no one got a penalty for it. This has consistently been an issue like you said.\n\nEdit: [This article goes into further detail about how long it took for the Safety Car to be deployed for their crashes, and mentions how Masi wasn‚Äôt satisfied with how some drivers failed to slow sufficiently for double waved yellows](https://www.racefans.net/2021/06/09/eight-safety-questions-raised-by-azerbaijan-grand-prix-crashes-and-f1s-reaction/)', 'I saw that hulkenberg was moving (in neutral presumably) after the start of the double yellows. \n\nWhen did he stop moving? Was it a huge gap between him stopping completely and him getting out of the car?', ""I'm a marshall at Monza and I will try to explain why there's usually a long delay from the incident to the actual decision\n\nFirst of all a marshall has to report the incident to the race director to asses the conditions of the track and the driver, it's not so easy to do from the camera feed but a marshall that is right there at like 10m or less can easily evaluate the situation better.\n\nThen the circuit race director has to translate what is being said (because for us we communicate in Italian but the FIA race director understands English) and the FIA race director has to make a decision\n\nKeep in mind that usually as long as the car it's still limping around and the driver is not out they won't ever give out a VSC or a SC because it's always better to just wave a double yellow and let the driver bring the car to safety\n\nIn cases like Australia I highly doubt that there was even some sort of communication between the track marshall and the race director, they gave the VSC too quickly so I suppose the fia race director decided without hearing the marshalls (and rightfully so, I'm not blaming the decision it was the right thing to do)\n\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of communication between the track marshalls and the race director then again between the two of them. Then the decision is given out which in turn takes another few seconds\n\nIt's never as easy as on TV you might think it is, and also trust me a race director does not want to use a SC or a VSC (while on the FCY they are more favorable because it's a lot better)\n\n\nAlso it's worth noting that if an accident happens like at turn 1 but all the cars are already past that point they will tend to wait for the sc/vsc, because marshalls might be able to remove the car in like 20/30 seconds without having the need to deploy a safety measure. In case the sc/vsc is deployed they will let them race up until almost the end of the lap so they get a bit more action before having the race neutralized"", 'The worst thing is if I‚Äôm remembering correctly even there fastest of 12 seconds was to slow considering the scenario, Russel was upside down in a high speed section with debris up in the air blocking vision of Russel, so within that 12 seconds  a car almost drove directly into the underfloor of russels car, a red flag should of immediately been thrown out in this situation, it‚Äôs just not good enough and unfortunately seems like it is going to take another fatal accident before they tighten up these calls.', 'Agree this is a quality post! What I don‚Äôt get is why the VSC cannot be deployed right away, even for just a few seconds, when something is clearly happening at the track. Almost as a swift replacement for double-waved yellows in most situation. Then full SC can be deployed within 30-60 seconds if deemed crucial. That was the whole point of introducing the VSC: not to have all the issues and instances OP rightfully brought up!', ""I watch a lot of feeder series as well, and the thing I note in both places is that sometimes flags or safety cars or other things aren't called until they imminently need to be called for safety. What I mean is that if the accident happens at turn one, and in two seconds all the cars are past turn one before anything could possibly be called... well, the cars won't be back around to turn one for more than a minute, sometimes much more depending on the track. So, often I think officials let it go for a bit so that we can get some more active racing while they aren't actually near a hazard. In several feeder series, they are much more likely than F1 to not call a safety car of any kind if some yellows or double yellows around one area are sufficient, and then they are active racing around the rest of the lap."", 'Do you also know the average time without the 2 minutes and 2 seconds from yesterday? I would expect that the average would be way down then and even shows more what of an outlier yesterday was.', 'Just a note - WEC/GT3 series (SRO based) have a mandated decision time of 45 seconds to call a VSC/SC or leave it under local yellows.', ""You have to consider, that safety car deployment will take longer / is delayed on purpose, if all cars are are close to each other with no back trackers and the fiele has already patheted the yellow sector.\n\nFor example first lap accidents or accidents after safety car restarts.\n\nThere is no risk in waiting to deploy the SC until sector 3, if the crash happens in sector 1 and that's what is done every time.\n\nFor red flag incidents it is different and they tend to call it faster to avoid a mess regarding restarting positions and to allow cars to cool down before returning to box.""]",363,103,0.94,363,888,888,-3,0,0.0,-3

1gjgh9o,Regarding complaints about the full wet tires.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjgh9o/regarding_complaints_about_the_full_wet_tires/,2024-11-04, Discussion,"So it seems like this comes up whenever we have a particularly wet weekend, where everyone from drivers to fans complain that the wet tires are useless and why don't Pirelli just make a good full-wet tire? But I feel like, wouldn't they have done so if it was possible by now? I think it comes down to spray. By the time the conditions are wet enough that the intermediate doesn't work anymore, there is too much spray for the drivers to see. That's why the FIA have done some experimenting with wheel covers today reduce spray enough for the drivers to see, because until that problem is solved, it's kind of a moot point. Thoughts? 

Edit: to be clear, it's not like I think this is some new revelation. I just wanted to make sure I'm not missing something.","['Problem is that wet tires are made for conditions that are red flagged anyways. Drivers want a tire that is in between intermediates and full wets.', ""This gen in general is unable to race in really harsh conditions. The ground effect is the main reason. it creates awful amounts of spray by sucking up water and chucking it out behind it. Remember. Those cars can suck up heavy manhole covers with ease. Then on top of that they run incredibly low which can cause the entire floor plank to aquaplan at high speeds. Both of these factors would make the wildest rain tyre useless. The current rain tyre probably is fine enough for displacing a shit ton of rain. 80 litres per second I think. Which is a crazy amount. Drivers really hate it because they offer so much less grip (duh) than the inters. So even if Pirelly would come up with a magic tyre that offers awesome grip, life and water displacement, You'd still have cars floating up and a fuckton of spray. Which both mean that there is absolutely no shot of them racing in harsher conditions.\n\nEdit: simply raising the car would cause them to have even less grip due to absolutely castrating your main downforce source. The floor."", ""The spray and conditions being two much for the cars when the wets are needed is one thing, but the fact of the matter is that they are incredibly slow. Even in utterly horrendous conditions like the middle of the race yesterday, russel and lando were switching onto new inters because the wets are just not good. Their useable window right now is not when they are faster than the inters, it's when the inters may as well be slicks. Which as you mention, is a tiny window.\n\nPirelli themselves know this, they've done and are doing tests with Ferrari to improve this. Overheating seems the primary problem in regards with them being so bad, and its definetly fixable. Michelin and Bridgestone's extreme wets back in their day were way more comparable in speed next to the inters."", ""This much has been obvious for decades.\n\nThere is no revelation in what you have put, wet tyres need to move water, the only place to move water to is up, this makes spray.\n\nI don't think you have really moved the conversation on any with this."", ""Wider tyres + ground effect = too much spray \n\nand the inters are near the limit for these cars, they eprhaos could make a 50-60 ltr tyre iso an 80 ltr, (inters are 35 if im not mistaken) but I doubt it'll be used much anyway. \n\nMaybe 26 when we get new regs and cars it'll be different again ü§∑"", 'What happened to [the super-intermediate tyres](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/FoqSgOQqwf) Pirelli suggested a year ago?', 'This is for the ""wet weather tyres are useless"" gang:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dfE3kvt.png', ""tire isn't the entire problem it's also the ride height.

1gi5jfq,"So, what's actually in the rules if there is no qualifying session?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gi5jfq/so_whats_actually_in_the_rules_if_there_is_no/,2024-11-02, Discussion,"We've all heard different things from different commentators, so I went and checked the text of the [Sporting Regulations for 2024](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_1_-_2023-09-26.pdf) and, surprisingly, I couldn't find anything that deals directly with a qualifying session being cancelled.

The closest thing I could find is the rule about drivers that are not classified at the end of a qualifying session (39.4.b):

>Drivers will be considered to be ‚Äúunclassified‚Äù in the following circumstances:

>i) If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race Director.

>ii) If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted

>iii) If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint shootout

Unless this is covered by some other rule that I didn't see (if so, apologies for wasting your time), if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:

>The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows:

>\- Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 **(or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)**

If I understand correctly, then it has to be Free Practice 1 classification order and the commentators that mentioned the possibility of Stewards using a different order are incorrect. I wonder if the rest of Rule 39.4.b is the cause of this misunderstanding:

>The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters such as:

>\- A suitable lap time being set in another practice session  
\- The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the Championship  
\- The gravity of the offence which caused the driver‚Äôs disqualification

which is about allowing drivers that did not classify at the end of the qualifying session to start the race and not about their position in the grid if allowed. Usually drivers are allowed to start the race unless there are serious driver / car performance or safety concerns.

Did I miss something?

Final note: the Rule on moving the qualifying session is quite straightforward, basically the Race Director and Stewards can do whatever they want (inside FIA rules) based on Rule 15.3.a:

>The clerk of the course shall work in permanent consultation with the Race Director. The Race Director shall have overriding authority in the following matters and the clerk of the course may give orders in respect of them only with his express agreement:

>a) The control of free practice, qualifying session, sprint shootout, sprint session and the race, adherence to the timetable and, if he deems it necessary, the making of any proposal to the stewards to modify the timetable in accordance with the Code or Sporting Regulations.","['Fuck knows', ""the truth is there is no precedent. race director will make the final call if the qualifying doesn't go through.\n\nalthough i personally feel if the weather is bad enough for there to be no qualifying whatsoever then it is really ambitious to hope for a race to happen as well."", ""Stewards discretion seems to be the most likely option but teams will protest for sure. It's going to be a hot mess.\n\nAlthough it probably won't matter looking at the forecast"", ""Time for Verstappen to pull a Hamilton '21\n\nWe're here for it"", ""Logical answer: sprint quali grid\n\nProbable answer: some FIA moment ruling that hasn't been thought of makes FP1 the race grid session."", ""You did not miss anything i think, there is no rule yet.\n\n>if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:\n\nThat is the question. If quali doesn't happen at all, does that mean that all 20 drivers failed to set a lap time during Q1 in the sense of this regulation? I don't think it has to be seen that way if Q1 never started and the stewards could use a different order.\n\nFor next year the rules in this situation would be WDC order."", '""If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1""\n\nThey didn\'t, the -did- set a time in SQ1.
