The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t rocked the Formula 1 world. Mercedes and Ferrari have moved somewhat closer.**\n\n> We don\'t need to rewrite the Formula 1 World Championship. The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t upset the balance of power between the teams. McLaren is still ahead, both on a single lap and in the long run. Max Verstappen is close. This has to do with the fact that Barcelona is a Red Bull track. The hope that stiffer front wings would upset the balance of the papaya racers was not fulfilled.\n\n> Mercedes has rediscovered its form from the first six races. But only for one lap. During the long run, the tires overheated. Ferrari delivered a solid performance. The gap to the leaders was half a second, slightly less than last time.\n\n> In the midfield, Aston Martin performed well on a single lap and Alpine on the long run. Toro Rosso showed the most balance. Their speed is good both on a single lap and over the distance.\n\n> Sauber has made a noticeable leap forward with its new aero package. Nico H√ºlkenberg\'s strong endurance run underscores that the Sauber has become more predictable. Williams, as expected, is struggling. The car doesn\'t thrive in the long corners. Haas had the same problem and plummeted to the bottom of the standings.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n> **1) Has the new front wing rule shuffled the field?**\nNot at all. On one lap, McLaren is ahead of Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Alpine, Toro Rosso, Sauber, Williams, and Haas. That\'s almost normal. Aston Martin looks slightly better than recently, Williams slightly worse. That depends on the track. Sauber and Alpine have made a leap with their upgrades. Haas adjusted the setup in the wrong direction after a strong first practice. On one lap, Mercedes is a pole position contender. But the Silver Arrows suffered a setback in the long run.\n\n> **2) Who has the fastest car in the long run?**\nWhen comparing the long runs, much depends on the time in the second practice session they were completed and the distance they covered. George Russell drove the longest stint on soft tires with 16 laps. Piastri was the marathon man on the medium tires with 14 laps. We only count the fast laps without cool-down periods or time lost due to traffic. The length of the race simulation logically puts pressure on the lap times. This is why Russell and Norris are far down in the standings.\n\n> Max Verstappen and Lando Norris are difficult to compare. Both completed a long run on the soft and medium tires, but at different times. Verstappen started on the medium and then switched to the soft. Norris did the opposite. Therefore, the world champion was faster in the soft long run, while Norris was faster in the medium endurance run. The difference was three to four tenths per lap. Taking the weight factor into account, it\'s a close race. The second stint was obviously helped by the fact that there was less fuel in the tank at the end.\n\n> The Ferrari drivers split their time in sync. First medium, then soft. Lewis Hamilton leads the soft long runs. However, he only completed three hot laps on the set. Oscar Piastri took the fastest time of the day, but suffered a setback in the endurance run. In 14 laps on the medium tires, the Australian only managed an average of 1:20.966 minutes. ""Things didn\'t go well in the first practice session. It wasn\'t until the second that we slowly found our way back to form,"" he said.\n\n> **3) Ferrari: Good or Evil?\nAfter the first practice session, Ferrari\'s faces were relaxed. Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc finished third and fourth, surprising even themselves. Barcelona hasn\'t exactly been one of the red cars\' signature tracks in the past. In the afternoon, with temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius in the shade, the corners of their mouths drooped again. Leclerc slipped to fifth place, half a second off Piastri\'s fastest time.\n\n> Hamilton, finishing eleventh, didn\'t even make the top ten. The Englishman complained about the car\'s balance. ""It was a confusing day with good and bad moments. But I think the final setup changes on Saturday should help us."" Leclerc expressed his positive surprise: ""It was a positive day. In the heat, everyone has less grip. That\'s why it\'s difficult to assess the cars\' true potential. But I feel like we still have something up our sleeve with our car.""\n\n(1/2)', ""Mclaren won by 30-40 seconds in Miami, that advantage isn't just a front wing difference."", 'While I agree the flexi wing clampdown won‚Äôt have much impact on the overall running order, I do think it‚Äôs a bit premature to say ‚Äúnothings changed‚Äù when we‚Äôve only seen 2 practice sessions. We all know Friday practice sessions can be unrepresentative.', 'We‚Äôll see after the race how things play out, too early to draw any conclusions.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our¬†[guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our¬†[FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H√§kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

You can see how well a driver did (H2H, mean and median gap) against their teammate\n\n* over a season\n* over all qualifying sessions they took part in as teammates \n* against all his teammates at a particular circuit\n\nI compared times from sessions both drivers participated in. I.e. if driver A made it to Q3 and driver B got out in Q1, then their Q1 times were used. This means results such as Norris v Piastri in 2025 Saudi went to Norris because he crashed and couldn't set a Q3 time but was faster in Q2.\n\nThere is also a fourth feature where you can see how far off a driver's best time is from the fastest driver for every quali session in a season. I thought it would be interesting to see how the gap to the fastest changes over a year (like how Verstappen got closer and closer to Mercedes in 2020, or how Alonso got further away in 2023).\n\nData was fetched from the Jolpica (formerly Ergast) API. Only data from the 1994 season onwards is available (so unfortunately no Prost v Senna). There is also a lot of data from the late 90s and early 2000s seasons missing, so you may find it weird that only 32 results for Coulthard v Hakkinen across their career are shown.\n\nI am planning to make a post here about it but wanted some feedback first. I'm not a frontend guy so excuse the basic layout and style, but if you could suggest a change that is simple enough and would improve the look of the site I'll do it.\n\nhttps://www.f1teammatequali.com/"", 'Rosberg is back for Spain.', 'Had Gilles Villeneuve lived and stayed at Ferrari, do you think he would have won the 1985 championship in place of Alboreto?', 'Damn, Lindblad is really good huh?', 'Is practice on today ?

One way to eliminate this issue would be to move the timeline for practice and qualifying to somewhere before pit-in so cars coming off a flyer can just duck in the pits and get out of the way.
