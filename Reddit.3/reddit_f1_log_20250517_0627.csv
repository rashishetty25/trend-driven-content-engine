What an ideal lap time is is sticking all of their best sectors together across all their laps in a session.\n\nHowever, it very often isn't physically possible to do all these sectors at the same time. A large reason that's easy to understand is ERS (energy reserve system) deployment. They get a boost in speed when they want. In one lap in a session, they might have used the ERS on sector one and had their fastest sector one then. On another lap, they might have deployed more of it in sector two, on another lap in sector 3. The sectors through a total lap are also affected by tire management through the lap, or how a corner is taken. Practice is for trying out a lot of different things. Someone might take the last corner of a sector in a way that's fast for the first sector but slower for the next sector on one lap, and on another lap, they might try it the other way, which gets a better second sector time."", 'I really like this analysis.

1koagef,How much do teams need to disclose?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1koagef/how_much_do_teams_need_to_disclose/,2025-05-16, Technical,"Watching Tech Talk and I keep wondering, how much are teams required to disclose to the FIA inspectors? Like does the FIA know exactly what McLaren is doing with their brakes and tyres after checking them for compliance? Are the FIA inspectors sitting a gold mine of cool secret information that they cant tell anyone about?

Tangentially F1TV asked Aston Martin about what their knew side pod ducts were for and they just said to cool the fuel tank. What stops teams from just blatantly lying to the media on these things?","['>Are the FIA inspectors sitting a gold mine of cool secret information that they cant tell anyone about\n\n[Check this out ](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-explains-laser-scanning-system-for-f1-scrutineering/9074990/)\\- in explains how the FIA uses scans (as well as other means) to scrutineer the cars.', 'Teams are required to fully disclose any component the FIA chooses to inspect. FIA scrutineers can demand CAD files, materials data, or even disassemble parts. So yes, technically, they can know everything but only if they choose to look. There‚Äôs a lot of cat and mouse here.\n\nThat said, nothing stops teams from lying to the media. They often do an It‚Äôs gamesmanship why reveal the purpose of a design innovation to rivals watching the same interview? For example, Red Bull‚Äôs 2022 floor edge design had people guessing for months.\n\nWhat‚Äôs wild is that teams often disguise their real tech even in plain sight like adding dummy parts during testing. So, maybe Aston Martin did say the ducts were for cooling the fuel tank, but maybe they‚Äôre really shaping airflow to energize the floor.', ""The FIA knows everything about the cars unless the teams specifically hide it.

They are not, however, required to explain why they made various decisions, or how things work at a more abstract level. So someone at the FIA does know the exact shape/materials of the McLaren brake ducts, but they may not have been able to figure out why that shape works so well.', ""NGL I didn't know this, thanks for the article.""]",22,9,0.8,22,8,8,3,0,0.010000000000000009,3
