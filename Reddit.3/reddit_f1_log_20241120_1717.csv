The cars are hopelessly out of step with the characteristics of F1 cars and the discrepancies in car performance that exist due to a lack of testing and availability of spare parts will never be solved because that would require them actually putting their hand in their own pocket.', ""The thing is that junior Formula series used to scale pretty decently. Every move up the ladder means a car that is faster, brakes harder, has more downforce and experiences more G-forces. The tech increases every step and so does complexity, but in the end setup works largely the same. Pretty clear cut.\n\nHowever, nowadays driving an F1 car is way more than just driving as hard as you can. Many of the younger drivers will quite easily be quick over a few laps in an F1 car. To do good in an F1 race tough, that's where the scaling between F1 and junior categories falls on its ass.\n\nMedia and social media pressure is immense, but that has, at least in some part, always been the case for the sport so I'm going to leave that out if it. What is incredibly different is that an F1 driver nowadays has to be able to read a car a lot better and a lot more than they used to.\n\nTake braking. Before the introduction of hybrid elements a driver could basically only modify their brake balance in the car. Nowadays it's brake balance, brake migration (the shifting of brake balance depending on the brake phase), the amount of energy harvesting / '(hybrid) engine braking' etc. Those settings don't exist in any of the other cars and can greatly mess with a drivers ability to be on the absolute limit (Ricciardo's McLaren comments for example).\n\nThan there's conservation of energy and tires. So much of F1 nowadays is centred around keeping the tires alive long enough without them falling off the infamous cliff and making sure you don't use too much fuel. In essence, the car does not carry enough fuel to go a full race distance on full-send mode, so they need to conserve that energy. For most (junior) drivers this is a rather foreign concept as during the junior races they can easily just fill the car up and go all-out for the full distance. Being able to feel the car, being right on the edge of what the tires can do and what fits your fuel target is something incredibly finicky and not all drivers are great at doing so. Combine that with either having to attack or defend for position on track and you've got a complex task that they aren't taught from an early age.\n\nDrivers like De Vries are great examples. He's shown that he's a fast driver in plenty of categories, but he lacks the skill-set a driver needs to perform in F1."", 'That is why Super Formula is seen as a finishing school.

Lewis Hamilton\'s successor will have a big challenge ahead of him in 2025, in which he must prove that he is one of the great future promises of motorsport.\n\nAfter an undeniable success in lower categories, with the exception of Formula 2, Antonelli will land in the Grand Circus in 2025 in a top-level seat at Mercedes. Although the brand of the star is not going through its best sporting moment, it is clear that they are betting heavily on him by choosing him as Hamilton\'s successor.\n\nAt 18 years old and in his first Formula 1 season, they will have to be patient with the young Italian, but Antonelli wants to make noise from the beginning. For 2025, he knows that his head-to-head with Russell will be very important and for that very reason, he arrives with a clear objective, which is to beat his teammate.\n\n""That great speed, I had it from the beginning. I struggled a bit at the start with the pace, but after a test at Spa they saw a clear step forward and they were convinced. I have a good relationship with George, he hasn\'t given me much advice, but for now, it\'s all good. Next year, I want to beat him,"" said Antonelli in an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\nAntonelli and Russell will enter 2025 with some doubts about what might happen at Mercedes in the medium to long term. Toto Wolff continues to make no secret of his desire to sign Max Verstappen and despite his repeated assurances that he has confidence in his two talents, the weight of an arguably four-time world champion may tip the balance in his favour.\n\nAlthough in the event of Verstappen\'s arrival Antonelli\'s future is less in jeopardy, the Italian cannot afford to fall too far behind Russell in order to avoid sowing uncertainty about his prospects. It will be an important year for him, in which he will have the pressure of racing a top level car and at the same time, the pressure of facing a tremendously fast teammate without a contract for 2026.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)', ""Just in: Antonelli's second f1 goal is beating everyone else"", 'first goal: complete a session without crashing', 'I like antonelli lets see how long it lasts', 'First George, and then (dramatic pause) ...
