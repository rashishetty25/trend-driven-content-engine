1o82rkp,Have we ever seen a contract?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o82rkp/have_we_ever_seen_a_contract/,2025-10-16, Discussion,"With all the talk of ever more complex contracts and drivers hinting at times over the conditions in one team being more or less onerous conditions around appearances, sponsor deals and presumably 'free agent's not related F1 or team activities, it got me thinking - have we ever / when was the last time we saw anything like a contract out of high end sports but especially F1 drivers? 

Do we have any clue at all how long these are? What teams have the worst clamp down conditions? What teams have the best / most free conditions? 

Just wondering if we have anything we could look at even if it's years out of date for interest.
