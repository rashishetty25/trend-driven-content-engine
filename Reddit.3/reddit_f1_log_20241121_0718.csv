The cars are hopelessly out of step with the characteristics of F1 cars and the discrepancies in car performance that exist due to a lack of testing and availability of spare parts will never be solved because that would require them actually putting their hand in their own pocket.', 'That is why Super Formula is seen as a finishing school. It has more downforce, power steering(F2 does not. Professional drivers(meaning you have guys in the series for a few years and know the thing inside out), and you need to learn new circuits so it also does not aid the F2 graduates.', ""The thing is that junior Formula series used to scale pretty decently. Every move up the ladder means a car that is faster, brakes harder, has more downforce and experiences more G-forces. The tech increases every step and so does complexity, but in the end setup works largely the same. Pretty clear cut.\n\nHowever, nowadays driving an F1 car is way more than just driving as hard as you can. Many of the younger drivers will quite easily be quick over a few laps in an F1 car. To do good in an F1 race tough, that's where the scaling between F1 and junior categories falls on its ass.\n\nMedia and social media pressure is immense, but that has, at least in some part, always been the case for the sport so I'm going to leave that out if it. What is incredibly different is that an F1 driver nowadays has to be able to read a car a lot better and a lot more than they used to.\n\nTake braking. Before the introduction of hybrid elements a driver could basically only modify their brake balance in the car. Nowadays it's brake balance, brake migration (the shifting of brake balance depending on the brake phase), the amount of energy harvesting / '(hybrid) engine braking' etc. Those settings don't exist in any of the other cars and can greatly mess with a drivers ability to be on the absolute limit (Ricciardo's McLaren comments for example).\n\nThan there's conservation of energy and tires. So much of F1 nowadays is centred around keeping the tires alive long enough without them falling off the infamous cliff and making sure you don't use too much fuel. In essence, the car does not carry enough fuel to go a full race distance on full-send mode, so they need to conserve that energy. For most (junior) drivers this is a rather foreign concept as during the junior races they can easily just fill the car up and go all-out for the full distance. Being able to feel the car, being right on the edge of what the tires can do and what fits your fuel target is something incredibly finicky and not all drivers are great at doing so. Combine that with either having to attack or defend for position on track and you've got a complex task that they aren't taught from an early age.\n\nDrivers like De Vries are great examples. He's shown that he's a fast driver in plenty of categories, but he lacks the skill-set a driver needs to perform in F1."", 'Pretty sure Yuki was never even given any FP session before his call up.', ""Therefore it makes zero sense in a sportive point of view that Superformula has less SL points overall than F2 has. The sole reason is simple because both the FIA and the FOM are just greedy folks who want to earn more money and political power into those feeder series instead of accepting better alternatives who aren't profitable for them."", 'The major issue with the Junior Formulas is the lack of spaces and opportunity on the top category.\n\n\nYou have old and washed drivers holding on spots on mid-and-back field and some even on top teams...

With immediate effect, the FIA is banning special protective plates that around 50 percent of the teams had fitted over the skid blocks. Red Bull pointed out to the association that this practice is illegal.\n\n>It's the big issue with the ground effect cars. How deep can I drive without the skid blocks in the underbody wearing out too much due to contact with the road surface? The critical value for the screws that fix the floor panel to the car is one millimeter. Anyone who exceeds this will be disqualified, as Mercedes and Ferrari did at the 2023 US GP.\n\n>Because the downforce of the cars is heavily dependent on the height of the vehicle, the teams have come up with every conceivable trick over the last three years to protect the fastening screws as well as possible. They have experimented with insulating material between the base plate or with bolts that have a certain amount of play to cushion the impact from the track.\n\n>Red Bull discovered the trick first\n\n>The latest trick was to provide the sid-blocks, which are used for measurement by the FIA inspectors, with special protection. This applies above all to the fastening screw in the rear area of the base plate. Everyone wants to drive as low as possible in order to gain downforce.\n\n>Around 50 percent of the field believed they had found a loophole in the regulations. Red Bull was the first to discover the so-called protection skids among the competition. These are said to include Ferrari, Mercedes and Haas. World Championship opponents McLaren, on the other hand, like Red Bull, did without this practice.\n\n>What are the consequences of the ban?\n\n>Red Bull pointed out to the FIA that the trick was illegal if the rules were applied precisely and that a protest would have to be expected if there was no clarification on this issue. And this came promptly. A week before the Las Vegas GP, all teams received a letter. In a technical directive, the FIA announced that the protective skids in question were not permitted. This assessment applies with immediate effect. Ferrari would have liked to move the date to the Qatar GP, but were unable to get their way.\n\n>The teams affected now have a problem that is all the greater when the aerodynamics are specifically designed for extremely low ground clearance. Because no one can risk the skid blocks rubbing off too much, the relevant teams have to raise their vehicle height to a safe level. And that could cost one or the other a lap time.\n\nTranslated via DeepL"", 'Yikes I was kind of hoping for a Leclerc masterclass here but maybe it’ll be a straight fight between Max and McLaren after all\n\nMeanwhile Red Bull has been cleared of so many false cheating allegations this season, while apparently Merc and Ferrari were doing this and McLaren was using mini-DRS wings up until cota', 'Vegas might be fine, but Qatar…..Merc and Ferrari will get fucked up.

1gvx4ox,Penalty point distribution analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gvx4ox/penalty_point_distribution_analysis/,2024-11-20, Statistics,"**Intro**  
After seeing a picture of the top 10 most penalized drivers circulating online, I was curious about the probability of the current penalty point distribution among nationalities. So, I did a small analysis of the current distribution. And found some interesting results I would like to share, mostly to ask for help in improving the analysis from the community. Please don't take this as an excuse to express gut feelings over bias. Some of the results may be highly unlikely but none of the results are beyond possible. I'm also no journalist, just an F1 nerd!

**Summary**  
I collected all data I could find about penalty points given per driver and the races they participated in per year. To this, I added the nationality they race under (Albon is Thai in the analysis). I then assumed penalty points to be normally distributed. I analyzed the result per nationality and took the variance from the mean as a measure. When you only take into consideration nationalities from which driver partook in at least 100 races you get the following results.

https://preview.redd.it/ihbezmz1w32e1.png?width=317&format=png&auto=webp&s=05093cd2b26089d4865b5feccd41276ff6b62a82

As many noted in the original post given the amount of races driven by British drivers they are quite absent in the top 10. The likelihood of this given this analysis would be around 14% (50% for the mean - 36%). Although highly unlikely not improbable. It could however be a signal of potential bias, yet I wouldn't go as far based on the current analysis.

Another interesting result is that both Russia and the Netherlands, have quite the variance from the mean. However drivers such as Kyvat, Mazepin, and Verstappen, who are more generally deemed aggressive drivers the results are more understandable.

**Discussion**  
I feel the analysis could be quite a lot better, and for that, I'm hoping some of the kind souls of r/Formula1  would be willing to assist. I'm yet to find a good index or database with all penalty points per race. I have found this up until 2021, but after that, I'm reliant on articles that don't specify where the points were given.

The results would also mean more if it would take into consideration all infringements investigated by the stewards. That would further improve the reliability of the analysis.

Beyond that assuming the results would be normally distributed is a stretch, even though the dataset is large, it fails to take into consideration all nuances of motorsport. This however is the best method I could come up with to check the results for potential bias.

He used the wrong words indeed and we shouldnt define everything he does by those words, but it doesnt change that he did say those words. He did, people didnt take it out of context or twisted the words. He used them. \n\nIts no reason to get full on hate as social media these days is used for. But it doesnt change the fact that he is responsible for his words. Own it, apologise for using the wrong words and that you didnt mean it like that and move on.
