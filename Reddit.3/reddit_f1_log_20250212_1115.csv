The F1 season currently has 24 races and while most circuits are locked in with multi-year contracts, there appears to be at least one available slot in 2027, with the Dutch Grand Prix to no longer be held after 2026 and the Belgian Grand Prix shifting to a bi-annual rotation.  Italy may also lose one of its current Grand Prix races, with the Imola expiring at the end of this season.

Thailand is not the only contender in the bidding race though, with rival submissions expected from organisers in South Africa and Rwanda. Authorities in South Korea and Argentina have also previously expressed interest.

It also hosts an annual MotoGP motorcycle race in Buriram in the east of the country, which generated US$140 million in economic circulation in 2024 and created close to 7,000 job positions at the circuit, according to the tourism authority.

A race in Bangkok would mean two annual races in the region, alongside the Singapore GP, which has been on the calendar in its Marina Bay circuit form since 2008. It was the first night race in the sport’s history and the first street race in Asia.

From 2005, his stock crumbled. But do we think that reflects how well he actually performed? \n\nWas his performance alongside Alonso a reflection of what he always was, or did his level vary?

1imyulw,Am I the only one actually optimistic for the F1 Movie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1imyulw/am_i_the_only_one_actually_optimistic_for_the_f1/,2025-02-11, Discussion,"Title. I feel like any post about the movie has half the comments being unneccessarily pessimistic. Calling it Driven on a higher budget. I feel like judging a movie from less than 3 minutes of promotional material is a bit odd, especially since just last year we had Transformers ONE which convinced everyone the movie would be terrible based on the marketing only for it to be a great film. Claiming a movie will be bad preemptively is just a little sad.

F1 fans in general seem to be under the impression this movie should only be for the extremely passionate fans who know every inch of the sport,otherwise it won't be good, when that's clearly not the case. Like any good fandom movie, it's designed to be something casual fans, experts, and people who vaguely know a guy named Lewis Hamilton can watch and enjoy. 

There's a lot of positives to take in my opinion. The Top Gun Maverick director is working on this one, so at the least the racing scenes should be fantastic and with Lewis helping out with production, they will try to maintain some degree of accuracy. They've also got the writer from the Transformers movies and Hans Zimmer working on it. I saw people whining about some of clips they've been recording, but we don't even know how those will look in post or if they'll even be in the movie, given they recorded clips of both Brad Pitt and Damson Idris winning in Abu Dhabi. They could always scrap or heavily edit them.

As for the plot, will it be like Rush or FordVFerrari? Absolutely not, because they aren't making a biopic, they're making a relvatively original plot that needs to not dumb it down too much to deter passionate fans nor make it so niche that casual viewers and the secondary audience aren't confused, which anybody would know is much more difficult than it sounds, especially with a fanbase as fickle as this one. Will there be some Hollywood cheesiness in it as a result? Of course there will be! But you can't disagree even some seasons in real life played perfectly straight with zero inaccuracies (something even Rush can't claim) would be accused of being ripped from Hollywood.

All I'm saying is, have a little faith. I will probably make a follow up to this with a review for the movie where I HOPE I'm not wrong.

TL;DR: A little more optimism would go a long way regarding the F1 Movie.","[""I'm looking forward to my movie debut, I'm sure if I get my magnifying glass out I'll be able to see my cameo in the silverstone crowd."", ""The estimated population of the world is over 8 billion.

No, that would be incredibly boring.\n\nIf they get the drama just right and don't over-americanise it, then it'll be fine.\n\nMy only issue at present is a 61 year old Brad Pitt somehow being a front-running driver in F1, but from the brief plot summary we have, they might have cleverly worked around that so it makes some sense."", 'I’m not optimistic because I don’t like Brad Pitt and he’s the lead.', ""I am one of the (quiet) pessimists and I doubt it'll change but dude, if you are optimistic for the movie, don't let the other consensus take you away from it.
