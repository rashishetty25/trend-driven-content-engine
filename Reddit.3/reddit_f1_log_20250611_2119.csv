Monaco, on the other hand, gets 2 million explicitly because it comes on TV in North America in the morning before the Indy 500. Shuffling the schedule like this not only hurts the Canadian GP but will also hurt Monaco, the most prestigious race of the year, in the viewership region that F1 is trying to attract.\n\nAnd if you think that F1 will steal viewers from the 500 you are sorely mistaken. Statistically, nearly every motorsports fan in North America watches the 500. Many people watch the Indy 500 who could not name a single team, driver, or manufacturer. TV's in bars, restaurants, airports, maybe even the dentist's office will be showing the 500. 1 in 48 people in general will be seated infront of the television watching the 500. The outcome of the 500 will be on local news across the country at 6:30pm. What you will not see, if it collides, is the Canadian GP. Nobody will see it who isn't already an exclusive fan of F1, which does not grow viewership in any capacity.\n\nIt will also hurt ticket sales. I'd wager that the vast majority of people in attendance will be local to the track. Celebrities, major news media, and motorsports fans from across the continent will not travel to Montreal, they will travel to Indy.

Its foolishness. They could put the race after the 500 but now they'd be colliding with the 600 which still gets 2.6m viewers and will still smother F1's TV ratings among casuals.

Charles Leclerc managed to get on the podium twice - in Monaco with a second place that almost tasted like a defeat, and a third place in Spain, partly fortunate, partly the result of good pace from the car - which were worth precious points. The SF-25, despite the debacle in qualifying at Imola, the most hostile track for the Italian car among the three of the triple-header, remains a car that in race pace shows it is capable of expressing second-force potential, especially in hot races.\n\n""On the pace we are more or less there. The characteristic of this car is that it suffers much more in qualifying than in the race."" (F.Vasseur)\n\nThe consistency in results that came from the European triple has allowed the Scuderia di Maranello to rise, almost unexpectedly, to second place in the constructors\' championship, overtaking a Mercedes that is still too erratic and with reliability problems, and a Red Bull still lacking in results from its second driver. The SF-25 remains “crippled” in performance by conservative set-ups to preserve skid wear. Pending the macro-development including the new rear suspension, the set-up compromise remains the car\'s big limitation. Info tells us that on the development front the situation is still very dynamic, but the internal operations relating to the 677 are close to being completed in order to make way in the tunnel for the 2026 car within the current month, as scheduled.\n\n**Ferrari with an evolving situation after the European triple header. In Spain no game changer but cars are more limited: the new directive cost the top teams 8 months of development.**\n\nA new front wing debuted in Spain, developed to comply with the new anti-flexion regulations imposed by the FIA. An update that had been expected and planned for months, making a virtue of necessity due to the T018 directive communicated to the teams at the end of January.\n\nNo substantial “game changer”, the wing directive has not materially altered the hierarchies, such for someone to consistently undermine a McLaren still with a technical advantage, but not super dominant. The values on the field, however, while not having seen radical changes in hierarchies, may not have been affected by the introduction of stiffer wings. Canada is already a further test.\n\nAn average loss of about a tenth is what the TD018 causes, with the Ferrari wing roughly back to pre-Austin 2024 stiffness values. An obligatory turnaround, which costs a top-team around eight months of work by the wing department, and around 50% of the budget spent on wing development. On-track feedback from the new specification in Barcelona was positive about the wing\'s new aerodynamic look. The loss of efficiency generated by the increased stiffness was partially offset by the new aerodynamics thanks to what we know to be a “more efficient” out-wash.\n\nFor the first few years of this regulation, the trend in wing shape was towards more extreme configurations, with upper flaps designed to increase the flow offset outside the front wheel envelope. With the rise of more flexing wings, the trend in aerodynamic form has shifted to having larger profiles in the mid-wing structure, taking advantage of controlled flexing to gain efficiency. It is clear that with TD some teams may have found better compromises than others. Some have managed to maintain good dynamic characteristics despite the stiffening of structures, thanks to more advanced materials.\n\n**Canadian GP: in 2024 it was a disaster with wrong pressures and colder weather. A stop & go track for an SF-25 with no updates**\n\nThe Montreal track with this generation of cars has never given Ferrari victories. In the first year Sainz was in a battle with Verstappen while Leclerc had no great luck. The technical and climatic characteristics are very different to the last three European races, and we return to a semi-city circuit with long straights, heavy braking and slow restarts: a classic “stop and go” track, where traction and braking are fundamental. A track that Hamilton has always liked, but with the Englishman still having to have full control of his car.\n\nTemperatures are lower than in scorching Barcelona, where switching on and windowing the tyres on the single lap remains the key issue in the simulator. Ferrari will return to using the “V-shape” rear wing configuration, with evaluation on the slightly trimmed flap configuration that ran in both Arabia and Italy. No significant updates are expected on the SF-25, which will not be reserving any new components for the overseas leg. Serra has been overseeing operations throughout the European triple, and the work in Maranello for Canada has been aimed at fine tuning the current package, making gold from the mistakes of 2024, when the Canadian GP represented one of the low points of the previous season, a gift to the competition that probably cost the world championship.\n\nTranslated by DeepL', '“the new directive cost the top teams 8 months of development.”\n\nPeople were saying Ferrari would be a big benefactor…\xa0\n\nNext Year ™️\xa0', 'Because they were planning to use this new geometry for the 2026 car.

There a number of changes in the technical regulations, many of which are beyond my understanding with aero.      
Did notice however that in regards to the power unit that there will be some differences in harvesting between race sessions and quali sessions.

There is a limit on energy harvesting of 8.5Mj per lap. At some events this may be reduced to 8Mj where the FIA determines that you can't really harvest more than 8Mj per lap.         
**This limit may be further reduced to no less than 5MJ for Sprint Qualifying and Qualifying sessions at Competitions where the FIA determines that the harvesting strategies required to achieve the above limit are excessive, subject to the conditions specified in Article B7.2.**

Also:         

There is a total power reduction limit of 450kW maximum and the resulting electrical DC power of the ERS-K must remain above -100kW(i.e. 350kW deployment to 100kW harvest = 450kW power reduction)      
**These limits are changed respectively to 600kW and -250kW for the Sprint Qualifying and Qualifying sessions.**","['This is indirectly saying that qualifying will always be faster than racing.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.
