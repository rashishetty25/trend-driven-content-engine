Some interesting bits I found:
The 80’s are the only decade the UK didn’t win a title and that they have been first or tied for first in 4 of the 7.5 decades. Ironically in the 80’s every driver who won the title did so driving a British car, but none of the drivers were British. The UK in the 60’s was the most successful any nationality has been in a decade with 6 titles.

Germany were nowhere before Schumacher but since his first title they have been the most successful country with 12 titles since then ahead of the UK with 9 titles since then. Germany also were first or tied first three decades in a row from their first appearance but it’s looking like they may not even appear this decade at all as things stand.

Before 2000 South American countries were first or tied first for titles in 3/5 decades and were second in another decade, only missing out on titles in the 60’s. After 2000 however, they have failed to win a single title. It goes back further though with Senna’s 1991 title being the last South American title. No one from outside of Europe has won a title since Villeneuve’s 1997 title.

Argentina and Italy were first and second for title wins in the 50’s but haven’t won titles since 1957 and 1953 respectively. Since then however, Ferrari has won 16 constructors titles so it’s not all bad for Italy. Argentina on the other hand, hang in there maybe Franco can turn things around.

Asia is the only continent (not counting Antarctica) that has never had a driver win a title. Africa has 1 thanks to Scheckter in 1979, which also happens to be the last Ferrari driver’s championship of the 20th century, North America has 3, Australia/Oceania has 5, South America has 13, and Europe has 53. Not really close on the continent level for the most titles.

The 90’s were the most competitive decade in terms of titles per nationality, with no country having more than 2 titles. All around though the sport was more competitive as a whole from 1958-1999. In that time period no driver won more than 2 titles in a row (you can technically extend that to 2001, before Schumacher won his 3rd in a row in 2002). In fact, from 1960-1985 no driver won consecutive titles. Prost in 1986 was the first driver to retain the title since Brabham. Compare that to 2000-2025 where 4 drivers have won 4 consecutive titles, and one of those, Schumacher, won 5. In the first 50 years of the sport only 1 driver did that and now in the last 25 years 4 have done it. As much as I loved when Vettel did it, I sincerely hope this era of drivers dominating for long periods of time ends and we go back to different drivers winning the title each year. 

Finally, the most titles any driver has won in a single decade is 5 and 3 drivers have done it (Fangio, Schumacher, and Hamilton). Verstappen has this year and 4 more after it to try to become the first to win more than 5 in a decade and if he wins this year, though it seems to be getting more and more unlikely, it would guarantee the Netherlands finish the decade in at least tied first for most titles. Hamilton may not win another title in his career, (though if he wins the title with Ferrari he would be the first Brit to do so since John Surtees in 1964) but he is the only driver to win titles across 3 decades, the 2000’s, 2010’s, and 2020’s.

Is it because the race leader rarely has a pace advantage that big that they can pit and not lose track position as well as teams being more likely to use alternative tyre strats due to compound changes?"", 'first /s', '“\xa0on the heels of his F2 title and McLaren instead signed Ocon to replace Ricciardo.”\xa0\n\nso for 2022? Ricciardo was never going to be replaced after 2021 so Im going to assume you’ve forgotten that Piastri took a year between F2 and F1 and you mean for 2023. Either way this is a very interesting question.\xa0\n\nBut first off, Ocon going to McLaren in 2023 wouldve been quite strange because at the time Alpine were in a slightly better place than McLaren and they were a French team. Are you saying that Alpine end up losing both drivers and have a Gasly/Piastri line up in 2023? \xa0\n\nBut I’ll try and answer this as best I can because I love a good ‘What If’.So as I understand this McLaren have a Norris/Ocon line up and Alpine a Gasly/Piastri line up.\n\nIn the first half of 2023 Alpine would be faster than McLaren. Not much would change in the grand scheme of things bar Hulkenburg likely gets a podium in Australia 2023 because Gasly and Ocon don’t collide and cause a red flag before they reach a sector marker.\n\nWhen McLaren become good in Silverstone I think things look even better for them because at this time Ocon is a better driver than Piastri. He likely gets a good few podiums. Not as many as Norris but Ocon was driving to a high level in 2023 perhaps better than Gasly. He had a lot of bad luck.\xa0\n\nAt Alpine Gasly probably outperforms Piastri who doenst get a podium.\xa0\n\nNow to 2024. This is where things start getting very interesting. First off Piastri and Gasly are screwed because Alpine still build a boat at the start of the year. \xa0McLaren meanwhile have a good time. After the steady start to the year and Norris probably still wins Miami although theres a chance that goes to Ocon. It’s basically whoever gets the saftey car luck. Also Ocon was actually really good at the start of 2024 and consistently outperforming Gasly up until Momaco where he likely still takes himself out.\xa0\n\nNow here is the question of team orders. Ocon will not want to obey them. Doesn’t mean he will crash with Norris because his reputation for crashing with team mates is quite overblown (more often the team mates fault than Ocon’s). But he is an aggressive driver.\xa0\n\nIt’s also hard to gauge where his performance level is relative to Piastri at this point. In fact Piastri as a whole I find very hard to gauge because he’s only ever had 1 team mate.\xa0\n\nOverall I think Ocon might win a couple of races. The main ones being Belgium and Brazil. He had a strong race in Belgium irl and could’ve beaten Hamilton but it’s hard to tell. The latter depends on whether he still stays out when it rains or if McLaren call him in. If he stays out it would’ve been interesting because irl Max overtook Ocon but Ocon was in an Alpine not a McLaren.\xa0\n\nPart of me thinks Verstappen still wins because that was his Maxterpiece but it’s difficult because Ocon was also driving superbly and if he was in the second fastest car he would’ve been hard to overtake. Also what a throwback it would be to have Ocon vs Verstappen for the win in Brazil after 2018.\xa0\n\nOverall 2024 still ends with a Max title even if Hungary goes to Norris. The constructors is again hard to figure out because as I said it’s hard to figure out how Ocon and Piastri stack up in 2024 especially comsidering that Ocon was likely not being given the same upgrades as Pierre at Alpine towards the end of the year.\n\nSpeaking of Alpine Gasly still has his strong end to the year and is likely better than Piastri in this period because Oscar did actually have a difficult end to 2024.\xa0\n\nGasly might actually beat Piastri in the standings courtesy of \xa0his good form coming when the car was at its quickest even if Piastri was better overall but the Alpine didnt reward points as much in that period.\n\nAnd finally Azerbaijan would be a different race because Ocon getting himself a puncture in Q1 and hampering Norris would have meant both McLarens out in Q1 as I read it. Rewatching Quali I think this could’ve happened.\n\nThis is huge for the constructors championship. Ferrari likely get a 1-2 or a 1-3 unless Leclerc still cooks his tyres which means we get the best finish of all time if the whole Leclerc, Perez, Sainz thing still happens. Unlikely thoigh and we probably get a 1-3 for Ferrari amd a 5-7 plus Fastest lap at best for McLaren. This is 40 points for Ferrari amd 16 for McLaren rather than real life’s 38 for McLaren and 18 for Ferrari. Basically this could be a monumental 44 poimt swing in the constructors championship but in the end it’s hard to tell how the constructors goes.\xa0\n\nAs for the driver market I’d say Alpine keep Gasly and Piastri who we have to remember won’t be as highly rated by people in this world. This means no Doohan or Colapinto at Alpine. McLaren probably keep their drivers as Ocon probably isn’t too bad that they put Bortoleto in. Probably. Haas also cant get Ocon so they probably just keep KMag.\xa0\n\nNow for 2025. McLaren still build the best car but dont have the current championship leader.\xa0\n\nLet’s enter the mother and father of all guesswork. This is all likely wrong but it’s fun nonetheless.\n\nIn Australia I’d guess Ocon doesn’t spin off but also doesn’t challenge Lando or Max.\n\nLando 25\nMax 18\nOcon 15\n\nIn the sprint both Norris and Ocon struggle while Max is second to Lewis. In the race in China Ocon had one of the best races he’s had while Norris struggled and had brake issues. Ocon likely wins.\n\nLando 43\nOcon 41\nMax 37\n\nIn Japan Max still wins from Norris while Ocon still has an awful Quali and probably cant overtake in the race.\n\nMax 62\nLando 61\nOcon 41\n\nIn Bahrain Ocon still crashes in Q2 and Norris and Verstappen both have unsatisfactory Qualis leaving the door open for Russell to just about win ahead of Norris. Piastri likely comes 5th or 6th for Alpine.\xa0\n\nLando 79\nMax 68\nOcon 51\n\nIn Saudi Ocon still has a shit Quali, Norris still has a crash in Q3, Max still has pole but gets a penalty for goimg off at the start but this time it’s Russell in second and so Max still wins. Norris is third. Ocon is 7th.\xa0\n\nLando 94\nMax 93\nOcon 57\n\nIn Miami sprint Norris probably stop wins while Ocon is second or third. In the race it’s a 1-2 and hard to tell who wouldve topped lap 1 shenanigans but I’ll say Lando wins over Ocon.\n\nNorris 127\nMax 105\nOcon 82\n\nIn Imola Max gets pole ahead of Russell \xa0and the McLarens. Russell fades away and ultimately Max wins. McLaren might start prioritising Norris at this stage.\n\nNorris 145\nMax 130\nOcon 97\n\nIn Monaco this is difficult because Norris and Ocon were the two stars of Quali and Ocon is potentially the best Monaco specialist on the grid. I’ll still give it to Norris. Just.\xa0\n\nNorris 170\nMax 142\nOcon 115\n\nAnd in Spain Max and Lando duke it out for victory but Max shenanigans still happen at the end. Ocon has a poor race and comes fourth at best.\xa0\n\nNorris 195\nMax 142\nOcon 127\n\nSo in this world Norris currently has a commanding lead while Oscar does well enough with Alpine to keep them off the bottom.\xa0\n\nAlso that is all guesswork and there are so many variables that Im probably completely wrong everywhere, but it’s fun!', ""Leaving aside the fact Ocon gets an unfair reputation, he was actually one of the least likely options to have gotten the McLaren seat. Also, Piastri had signed with Alpine. He spend 2022 as their reserve driver, because they didn't have an open seat. It's during that year that he started looking elsewhere.\n\n\nThe open seat was between Piastri and Alonso, and in the end Alpine lost both. Ocon was in the other seat and was secure (or rather he had a contract that he clearly couldn't get out of yet). Had Piastri signed, McLaren had a few other options, a) stick with Ricciardo after all, b) sign Gasly (would have to be paid out, like Alpine ended up doing), c) get to Alonso, before AM does, d) get someone from Indycar, like Palou (he was at the time rumoured to replace Ricciardo), e) another option I haven't thought about right now.\xa0"", ""None officially - it's only a teams championship, where around 45% of Formula One Group EBIT is paid to the teams (with a scale down above 1.5bn).  \nThe PU manufacturers have a price target, as the leasing contract to the teams (including works teams & a customer price cannot be more expensive than a works team contract) for the per season allocation.  \n  \nWorks teams can of course decide how to split the money between the team & PU companies/departments."", ""I'm guessing you're looking at the last stint in Spain as an example. \n\nDuring a race you're trying to get as long of a stint as possible, so you can't push the tyres very hard, while in qualifying you're pushing them over the edge of overheating, to where you start losing grip at the end of the lap. See this grip/degradation curve below.\n\nhttps://temperature.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/large-Tyre-Temperature-Graph-1-1-e1627372610798.jpg\n\nSo in one qualifying lap you might suffer the same degradation as several racing laps. \n\nAlso, putting a heat cycle through a tyre changes its molecular structure, and can make it harder and therefore slower. \n\nWe often hear that pushing these tyres at the start of a stint will drastically reduce their life (and probably their early pace too), so the last thing you really want is an old qualifying tyre that's been pushed as hard as possible.""]",6,22,0.72,6,20,20,0,8,-0.08000000000000007,0
