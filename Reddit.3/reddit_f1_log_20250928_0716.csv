We're racing again on the most demanding race track in the world! Join us for race 9 of the Nürburgring Endurance Series of 2025 on the Nordschleife. Over 100 race cars are going on a four-hour hunt for points and trophies.  
  
In different classes, fast GT3 cars with around 500 hp, robust touring cars and identical cup cars fight for victory in their class. In the top class, GT3 cars from Porsche, Mercedes-AMG, Audi, BMW and others compete for overall victory.  
  
The Nürburgring Endurance Series races on the legendary Nordschleife - the longest permanent race track in the world.  
The 24-kilometre track leads through the middle of the Eifel forests, was built more than 90 years ago and leaves hardly any room for driving errors. No wonder that former Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart once called it the ""Green Hell"".
