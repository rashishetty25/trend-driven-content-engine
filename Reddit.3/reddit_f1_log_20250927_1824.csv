We're racing again on the most demanding race track in the world! Join us for race 9 of the Nürburgring Endurance Series of 2025 on the Nordschleife. Over 100 race cars are going on a four-hour hunt for points and trophies.  
  
In different classes, fast GT3 cars with around 500 hp, robust touring cars and identical cup cars fight for victory in their class. In the top class, GT3 cars from Porsche, Mercedes-AMG, Audi, BMW and others compete for overall victory.  
  
The Nürburgring Endurance Series races on the legendary Nordschleife - the longest permanent race track in the world.  
The 24-kilometre track leads through the middle of the Eifel forests, was built more than 90 years ago and leaves hardly any room for driving errors. No wonder that former Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart once called it the ""Green Hell"".

I think it\'s been 50-50, to be honest,"" Alonso said. ""The thing is that when you do 400-plus races, there are a lot of races with good luck and a lot of races with bad luck. But I think everything compensated, and even when I went to Le Mans, the second Le Mans, we were two minutes behind the leader one hour before the end and then they had a puncture, then they had a wheel that was not properly done, then they had a double pit stop ... then I won the second Le Mans.

While I agree Alonso has been unlucky not to win more championships, he was also fortunate to pick up the titles in 2005 and 2006. Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone never liked seeing one team dominate, and when Schumacher and Ferrari started winning almost every race in 2002, the FIA began looking for ways to rein them in. The qualifying format was switched to single-lap runs, which exposed Ferrari’s weakness with tire warm-up and limited Schumacher’s usual strategy of starting heavier on fuel. The points system was also revised to keep the championship battle closer for longer. Things got so extreme after 2002 that Mosley even floated ideas like adding ballast to the championship-winning car or reversing the starting grid.\n\nThe real turning point for Ferrari came with the one-tire rule in 2005. It was no secret that Bridgestones degraded faster than Michelins, and the regulation change effectively swung the advantage toward Micheli supplied teams. That allowed Renault and Alonso to capitalize, even though Ferrari still had a strong,if tricky car. Renault’s rapid engine development also paid off when V10s were banned in 2006. Had Ferrari been able to carry its early-2000s advantage forward, it’s an open question whether Alonso would have still won those two titles.', ""The starts those Renaults had back then were crazy.

When we talk about clean air pace, we’re referring to a driver’s true performance when not affected by the “dirty air” coming off the car ahead.  

🔍 Dirty air is the turbulent airflow generated by a Formula 1 car, which reduces downforce for the car behind, making cornering more difficult and increasing tyre wear.  

👉That’s why clean air pace gives us the clearest view of a driver’s pure and consistent speed, without external disturbances such as traffic.

📊 For fair and accurate comparisons, we standardise several factors:
 
- Only laps on the same tyre compound (soft, medium, or hard) are compared.  

- We apply a typical degradation per lap rate for each compound.  

- A fuel correction is also included, adjusting lap times to remove the effect of fuel load — essentially equalising every lap to simulate running at zero fuel weight.  

Obviously, there may be many external factors that we are unaware of that can influence a driver's performance, such as strategy or not needing to push to the maximum in a stint. Therefore, we try to carefully evaluate each driver in order to avoid including laps that are not representative""

* With his DNF in Baku, the soonest Piastri could clinch the title would be in the Brazil Sprint. This would require Norris score no more than 8 points and Verstappen score no more than 52 points between now and the end of the sprint.
* If Piastri wins every race (GP and Sprint), he would clinch in Vegas, even if Norris comes 2nd in everything.
* Verstappen winning every race is not sufficient to guarantee the title, as need to outscore Piastri by 9.86 pt/race and Norris by 6.29 pt/race. Consequently, if Verstappen wins every race and Piastri comes 2nd in all, then Piastri would win in Abu Dhabi by 18 points.

**WCC:** Despite Red Bull's 1-6 and McLaren's 7-DNF, Red Bull did not outscore McLaren enough to remain in contention, and they were mathematically eliminated. With the poor results in Baku, the maximum points McLaren can now score is 969, so they can not surpass the 1000 point line; however they can still break the record for most points in a season (860, set by Red Bull in 2023).

McLaren can clinch in Singapore, provided they are not outscored by Mercedes by more than 30 points or Ferrari by more than 34 points. With a maximum of 43 points on offer, this is guaranteed to happen provided they score at least 13 points. This could happen by:

* 1 driver finishing on the podium, even if the other does not score points

1nrzej1,First-time COTA F1 volunteer – Intervention Marshal. What should I bring with me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nrzej1/firsttime_cota_f1_volunteer_intervention_marshal/,2025-09-27, Discussion,"Hi everyone,

I’m volunteering at this year’s **F1 US Grand Prix at COTA** as part of the **Intervention Team**. I’ll be flying in from out of state, so packing space is limited. I know we’ll get full training on-site, but I’d love advice from anyone who’s done this before:

* What personal gear do you always bring with you?
* What does COTA provide vs. what do I need to supply myself?
* Any packing tips for someone traveling by air (compact essentials)?
* Anything you wish you’d brought your first time?

I want to show up prepared, safe, and ready to work. Any advice from past COTA marshals or intervention crew would be hugely appreciated.

Thanks in advance!","['Been to COTA but not as a marshal. But definitely bring a good hat and make sure to get hand on lots of water and maybe electrolytes powder packets. It can get quite hot even in late October!', 'Can’t answer your question, but just wanted to say that I’m jealous. Hope it goes well!', ""Your organization contact should be giving you all this information already in the form of guides and prep packs, go back to them and ask, it sounds like you've missed something. Also, if that doesn't work, look up UK marshalling resources, they have all of that kind of info."", 'Sunscreen, personal fan, big ass sun hat, giant water bottle', 'I think your phone in case any drivers crash out and want to watch the rest of the race!', 'patience']",16,6,0.9,16,6,6,16,6,0.9,16
