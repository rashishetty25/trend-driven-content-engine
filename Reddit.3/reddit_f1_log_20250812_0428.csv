That\'s never been the intention. It\'s just that if I see an opportunity to improve something, I want to speak about it, especially if it comes to track safety or car safety,"" Russell explained. ""In 2012 I was team-mates with Billy Monger \\[who lost his legs in a British F4 crash in 2017\\] and had a close relationship with him. Seeing that crash live, and then watching Anthoine \\[Hubert\\]\'s crash \\[at Spa 2019 in F2\\], I was watching that live. It was sickening to watch.\n\nWhen you experience things like this with people who you know so well, and you believe you have ideas that can help improve the safety or prevent that from happening, then you naturally want to share it.\n\nAgain, Romain Grosjean\'s crash \\[in Bahrain 2020\\], I saw that. He was in front of me and I passed him, and I still see the image in my head now. I looked in my mirror, and all I could see was flames. It took over my whole mirror.\n\nThat could have happened to anyone. It could have happened to the greatest driver in the world. That\'s just the danger we face. So, I think that\'s probably why I wanted to be more involved than not."" \n\nI genuinely don\'t understand what is so outrageous about what he said.

I remember when he crashed in the final lap of Aus 2024, and was flipped in the middle of the track at risked of getting t-boned (especially with stroll close behind).

I remember all the comments from drivers and team principals when the Halo first came out in 2018. It was after Hubert that it clicked for people that this sport is incredibly dangerous, because it was so easy to imagine that crash happening again. \n\nI'm glad Russell speaks about this often, a top driver holds a lot more weight in the public sphere than someone like Wurz did, and he clearly isn't afraid of the disgusting, often homophobic abuse he gets."", ""Driver safety should always come first. \n\nLook at Qatar23.

My favorite iteration of them is the British system with points for positions gained.

Experience is incredibly important in a low level series) than most of the field, always qualifies well, and never really has to practice overtaking. That can be an issue in some F4 series, though Italian F4 has developed talent well without them, aided by their generally strong strength of field.\n\nFrankly, I don't think reverse grids should be a thing by F2. All of those drivers should be experienced, and if the cars and teams are as equal as possible there should be enough parity that the same driver isn't on pole most weeks anyway.
