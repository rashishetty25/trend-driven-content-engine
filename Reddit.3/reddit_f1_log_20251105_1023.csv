1oo90jo,Current development won't harm Red Bull's 2026 chances - Mekies,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oo90jo/current_development_wont_harm_red_bulls_2026/,2025-11-04, News,,"['It’s such a stupid question, did anybody expect him or any management member to say they going to scrap their 2026 chances ?', "">”…it was if we were turning the page at the point of the season where we are very unhappy about this car, not reaching the full potential, then you would go into 2026 with a lot of question marks in your head and with a lot of wishful thinking.\n\n>”So we have preferred to invest a little bit more in this car. We tried to unlock what we felt had not worked and got a bit of performance out of it. It gives us a lot more confidence into tools, methodologies, approaches going into 2026. Yes, there is a cost in the amount of time and energy left for that, but that's the rationale behind it. Nothing to do with the performance whatsoever.\n\n >”We are doing it this way because we think for us – leaving alone the other guys – it's a net gain. We validate our approaches and [that will help] 2026, if we thought it would compromise it, we would not be doing it. We know there is a price to pay. We think it's reasonable and we think it's worth it.”\n\nMakes sense. They clearly understand the car much better now than they did mid-season, which will help if they have correlation issues with the next car. \n\nReminder that we have no idea how the teams will shake out next year, just rumors. Which are likely spread for a specific agenda. There’s a reason Max chose to stay for next year, and he’s actually seen the engine data etc."", 'Whoever has the best engine is going to win 2026 anyway.', ""I think Mekies is playing the cards he's been dealt. He obviously took the decision to refocus on the development of this years car while the obvious move would be to dedicate resources to next year.\n\nIn his position I'm sure most of us would do the same. He can't take for granted that he'll be retained at the end of the season (hard to escape the reality that he's been parachuted in as a midseason replacement TP, so there's no guarantees that he's not seen as a stopgap by the decision-makers at Red Bull), but he can certainly help his case by delivering improved results. Which he's clearly done.\n\nGood luck to him I say."", 'One could argue they *did* start 2022 relatively poorly versus where they ended up that year.

Obviously new engine in 2026 but those Red Bull engine guys are working full steam anyway', ""Beyond what they have said about correlation and how that can help them going forward, to some extent Red Bull is just such a massive team operationally that they can walk and chew bubble gum more efficiently than many of the other teams can. Haas literally doesn't employ enough people to both develop this years car and next years car at an equally high level, they will have to compromise somewhere. Red Bull likely can."", 'Seems to me that the correlation they’re getting is very valuable for next season\xa0']",427,69,0.96,427,961,961,9,1,0.0,9
