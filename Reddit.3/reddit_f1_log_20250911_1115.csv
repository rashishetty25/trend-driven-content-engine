1ndq57a,F1 can learn some lessons from WEC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ndq57a/f1_can_learn_some_lessons_from_wec/,2025-09-10, Discussion,"
I recently dove into the world of WEC and watched several races from this season. I’m very impressed with how well it’s run, especially in terms of safety and the consistency of decision-making from the Race Director.

Full Course Yellow (FCY):
Instead of bunching the field behind a Safety Car, every driver slows to a controlled speed of 80 kph while maintaining their position. The pit lane is closed. This eliminates the need for a VSC and adhering to a delta time. It effectively freezes the race and prevents anyone from taking advantage of gaps under the VSC.

Virtual Safety Car (VSC):
This works the same as a Full Course Yellow, except the pit lane remains open. Again, instead of monitoring a delta, cars are held to 80 kph throughout the VSC. This ensures no one gains an advantage by manipulating the delta.

Safety Car with Wave-By Procedures:
This is an area F1 could easily adopt. While you could argue F1 already has a similar system, WEC’s implementation is far more consistent. Each phase of the Safety Car is predictable and standardized, which provides better forecasting for teams to make strategic decisions.

Overall, the procedural decisions made during WEC races appear far more consistent than anything I’ve seen in F1 over the past 12 years. ","['I feel like F1 cars would struggle being stuck on 80 kp/h and the tire temps would drop massively, a delta time gives them more room to manage it.', 'As someone who follows both series closely I think WEC’s current procedures work very well for them and F1’s procedures work well for F1. There’s no need to change anything', ""WEC's procedures work well for WEC because WEC cars are fundamentally far more balanced vehicles that can still operate fairly well at 80kph and at the restart.\n\nIf F1 cars slow down to a speed of 80kph for a few laps, on most circuits and on most tire compounds, they'll be too cold for the restart.\n\nCourse volunteers can also work around 80kph WEC cars. The F1 cars need to be bunched up together under safety so that course volunteers can be safely dispatched to do their job. It is one thing to work around 80kph cars - another thing altogether to be out there with cold F1 rubber and aerodynamic grip reliant cars."", ""You haven't made a single argument for why F1 should adopt these changes or what would actually be improved by doing so.\n\n\nIt's different, it allows for different strategies. Different can be better, but it's not necessarily better."", 'I loved at COTA this past weekend when the safety car had done so many laps in the wet that they had to switch it out for another but then didn’t tell the field so they followed it into the pits and in the confusion temporarily mixed up the field so bad they had to red flag the race to determine the correct starting order.\n\nIt made for an interesting in-person viewing experience.\n\nOk the whole, WEC’s procedures are good for them because their races are long and the cars are well balanced to each other (another 10kg for Toyota).', 'One of these has 60+ cars that race for 24hrs and regularly pass each other the entire time.... The other does not', 'WEC races are long lol. Lemans has had 12 hours of safety car procedure before. You could eat a whole f1 race with 1 sc procedure lmao. Both series are regulated by the same FIA. F1s regulations work for f1, WEC for WEC. Remember Eduardo was f1 race director for some time so they have crossover at that level even and he didn’t massively change things', '>The pit lane is closed.\n\nAnd that is how Singapore 2008 entered into infamy. Renault pitted Alonso early, knowing that Piquet Jr. would bring out the safety car. When he did, everyone backed up behind it, unable to pit until racing resumed. When it did and everyone dived into the pits, Alonso got a thirty-second advantage on the road.', ""> Full Course Yellow (FCY): Instead of bunching the field behind a Safety Car, every driver slows to a controlled speed of 80 kph while maintaining their position.

At least the time delta takes that into account.\n\nWith a consistent 80kmph you're not taking unfair and making it fair, you're taking who it's unfair to and moving it around.""]",49,60,0.64,49,500,500,5,1,0.010000000000000009,5
