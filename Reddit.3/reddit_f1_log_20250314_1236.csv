Only tow choices and neither are full seasons, 2023 was so impressive when he came in, particularly Singapore. 2024 USA was just as good, but he wasn't beating Yuki as often in 24 so 23 it is. 

Lando Norris - 2021
Ok so Lando is an odd one in that all his seasons I'd rank pretty similar and he's never had a bad year. I chose 21 because of how impressive he was in the first half of the year (at summer break I think he was 3rd in standings) He also could have won a few races post summer break had things home differently. 

Oscar Piastri - 2024 
His run from Austria to Baku was truly incredible and his end of the season was nowhere near as bad as lots of people on here seem to think. He also had bad luck in a few races but still ranked fourth. 

Charles Leclerc - 2024 
This was actually a pretty clear winner. He did not make any of the mistakes that had blighted his previously great seasons and without the bad Ferrari summer run he could have won the championship. Winning in Monaco and Monza is amazing. 

Lewis Hamilton - 2020
His stretch from 18-20 is great but he never seemed quite as unstoppable as he did in 2020. He also beat Bottas better than in 2018 when Bottas had so much bad luck, and 2019 where both of them were on it. 

George Russell - 2024
So 2021 and 2022 are both strong contenders but his drives in Spa and Las Vegas as well as his qualifying demolition of the man with the most poles in F1 puts this first.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli - N/A

Fernando Alonso - 2012 
Fighting for the championship all the way to the end in what was usually the fourth best car is incredible and he deserved that title so much. 

Lance Stroll - 2020 
So Stroll was good in 17 but 2020 was different. He was fourth in the championship at mid season before he had a poor run until his finest hour when her got pole in Istanbul. He also got two podiums. 

Pierre Gasly - 2021 
How did he constantly qualify in the top six week in week out? He battered Yuki and git a podium in Baku as well as really strong P4s in Netherlands and Mexico 

Jack Doohan - 2024 (doesn't really count though) 

Esteban Ocon - 2017 
So Ocon actually had a few contenders, with 22 and 23 (which he got a fair bit of bad luck in) being strong. However 2017 takes it as he was really good in his first full season in F1 and looked like a driver who could challenge for a title in the future. He also could have got a podium in Canada of not for Perez.

Ollie Bearman - 2024 
Only did three races, and two of them were very good, Baku and Saudi. Though I don't rate Saudi quite as highly as most do. 

Yuki Tsunoda - 2024 
After an inconsistent 21 and a poor 22 he improved a lot in 23 before really coming on strong in 2024, topping the midfield numerous times at the start of the year and getting consistent points to the end.

Isack Hadjar - N/A 

Alex Albon - 2023 
Getting great points out of that car and destroying his team mate. His P7's were great as well as qualifying fourth in Zandvoort 

Carlos Sainz. Jr - 2019 
IMO he was easily a top three driver  that year with his constant best to the rest finishes earning him a thoroughly deserved sixth place in the standings spot following his podium in Brazil which is the second best midfield performance I have seen these last five years 

Nico Hulkenburg - 2014
So Hulkenberg is really difficult because loads of his seasons are solid but not spectacular. 2013 was great and I was really tempted to put 2018 here because he was best of the rest that year. But his mistakes in Baku and Spa held me back  and ultimately I think 2014 is his best. 
He finished in the top six in all but one of the first seven races in a force India and at one point he wa third in the championship standings. Only Hulkenburg could be third in the standings without a podium..

Gabriel Bortoleto - N/A
","[""In my opinion, Hamilton's best seasons are 2018, 2014 and 2015 in no particular order.\n\nI also think Leclerc's 2022 year is becoming a little bit underrated in hindsight. He had more pace than in 2024 IMO."", ""Good list, IMO Hamilton best season was 2018 (clearly the best driver that season despite not having the clear best car, unlike 2020), Ocon's best was 2021 (won a race, had worse luck than Alonso but was close to him in points despite that), Nico's was probably 2013 (51-6).\n\nAlso, for some drivers multiple seasons can apply (Max, Lando, Carlos, could even argue about Gasly with 2020) but the seasons in the list are probably the best ones IMO (or at least tied for that)."", 'I think 2008 and 2018 is better for Lewis Hamilton', ""Hamilton has had so many great seasons.

All while dealing with the pressure of getting that first championship."", 'Aside from 2006 and 2012, I wanna add 2014 for Alonso. Dragging the sixth(?) best car of the grid within a couple laps of a race win in Hungary and nearly getting fifth in the championship is absurd.', 'What is with the love for Lewis’ 2008? It’s one of his weakest seasons.

Aside from 2011, this is as patchy as a Lewis season gets. He ended up winning the title because it was arguably the weakest season of the last 20 years from a driving calibre perspective.', 'Call me crazy but I thought Fernando was pretty good when he beat Schumacher to two world titles..', 'Max - 2021, Lewis - 2018, Fernando - 2012', ""I'd say 2008/2018 and 2021 were better for Hamilton and Verstappen respectively. I'm not an F1 driver, may I shock you, but I assume it's much less pressure when you're far ahead of your mid-at-best teammate in a dominant car than when you're actually going wheel-to-wheel for the title against somebody. Dominant seasons are also impressive, but for me not as much as close battles.""]",44,144,0.71,44,765,765,7,1,0.020000000000000018,7

You guys might be looking forward to rain for the chaos, I’m looking forward to the rain because it’s pretty much our first proper rain in multiple months. We've been slowly approaching [drought-like conditions over the last 12 months](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/maps/rainfall/?variable=rainfall&map=decile&period=12month&region=nat&year=2025&month=02&day=28) in this part of the country so any rain is good rain.\n\nThe weather in Melbourne is largely dictated by the direction of the wind, hot when the wind is coming from the deserts in the middle of the country to our north and cold when the wind is coming from the Southern Ocean and Antarctica to our south. Saturday is currently forecast to be 34°C as we get the hot northerly desert winds ahead of the approaching Antarctic cold front. The cold front is then forecast to hit by Sunday morning, swinging the winds around to the S/SW and dragging up a much cooler air mass from down near Antarctica with the temperature forecast to be 20°C and dropping for the start of the race.\xa0The winds are also likely to be reasonably gusty for the race with a fairly steep pressure gradient as the ridge of high pressure behind the front moves over the Great Australian Bight and pushes through into Melbourne.\n\nThere’ll be rain and possible storms as the front passes through but we also quite often get fairly heavy intermittent showers for a few hours after the front passes as the cold Antarctic air interacts with the warmer waters of Port Phillip Bay, so I would say at this point it's likely that we're going to have at least a partially wet race. The showers behind the front can be pretty intense with occasional small hail but it was also a similar cold front setup around this time last year that brought severe storms and caused power outages that affected 500,000 homes and businesses so anything is possible.\n\nSome interesting links to keep track of our weather:  \nOffical forecast for Melbourne - [http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml)  \nOffical rain radar for the Melbourne region - [http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR024.loop.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR024.loop.shtml) (Albert Park is directly between the dots for Melbourne and St Kilda)  \nLatest official observations for the Melbourne region - [http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/melbourne.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/melbourne.shtml) (Melbourne (Olympic Park) is the closest station to Albert Park for most observations but St Kilda Harbour RMYS is marginally closer for wind observations)\n\nIt's definitely a weekend filled with the notorious 'Melbourne' weather that we're known for at least!"", 'I wish Harry Benjamin was a permanent in F1 commentary or skysportsf1 commentary', 'Why is the length of Oscar’s contract a secret?', 'so with a possibility of rain on sunday, how do teams go on about setup for quali?', 'On F1tv, how do I get cockpit audio from e.g. Verstappen?

1jaag7x,How Will the 2025 Drivers Perform (F1 Mathematical Model),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jaag7x/how_will_the_2025_drivers_perform_f1_mathematical/,2025-03-13, Discussion,"Since 2025 has such a big rookie class, I thought it could be interesting to speculate (based on my mathematical model) on how well they will perform, using all the references we have and comparing to similar candidates in the recent past.

# Let's Speculate

The model only predicts the potential ceiling or pace of the drivers (in parenthesis). Based on previous performances relative to their ceilings, I am estimating the drivers' performances in 2025 to look something like this (barring any major outliers):

Verstappen 92 (93)

Leclerc 90 (92)

Norris 87 (89)

Russell 84 (85)

Hamilton 82 (84)

Sainz 81 (83)

Albon 80 (83)

Piastri 79 (84)

Alonso 79 (81)

Ocon 77 (81)

Gasly 76 (80)

Tsunoda 74 (78)

Hulkenberg 63 (68)

Stroll 62 (74)

Now, let's look at the incoming drivers and see where they might fit in, going from most known to least. To make this perfectly clear: This is going to be highly speculative, especially the further down you go.

**Liam Lawson**

Lawson will be going into his first full season with 2 quarter seasons under his belt. That makes it a bit blurry to predict how exactly he will develop, but it also provides a clear baseline not present for most rookies. Based on his performances against Yuki Tsunoda, and assuming his current experience accumulates to that of one full rookie season, his ceiling for 2025 would be \~71. While he hasn't shown any signs of being mistake prone, making the step to a top car can be a bit much sometimes (especially next to someone like Verstappen), resulting in a relative step back. Based on similar examples a rating in the low to mid 60s would then make sense, so I'll go with 63.

**Franco Colapinto**

While he isn't technically on the grid right away, it seems like everyone's already expecting him to swoop in for Doohan at some point; and sooner rater than later. Colapinto looked really promising next to Albon and could have a ceiling of around 78 for 2025. He also seemed to be prone to overdriving, making it likely that he wouldn't score particularly close to his ceiing. Mid to high 60s might be reasonable. With a bit of improvement concerning his consistency I could see him at 68.

**Oliver Bearman**

Bearman's junior career isn't very telling but his 3 race weekends in 2024 are a bit of an easy out. While it's definetly not enough to predict anything concrete, he looks to be situated somewhere between Gasly and Russell in terms of his ceiling. Carlos Sainz might be an appropriate comparison. Sainz' rookie season is rated 62 by the model. Considering that Bearman will be a year younger than Sainz at the time but has a minimal leg up experience wise, I'm landing just below 60, so that'll be 59 with a low 60s ceiling for 2025.

**Jack Doohan**

He might not take part in enough races for a rating. Hopefully, his Abu Dhabi result wasn't entirely representative but if it was, he has no chance of holding on to that seat. His F2 and F3 record deosn't properly aleviate this fear either but at least it suggests that he migtht just not be quite that bad. Far below 50 is still the most likely outcome in my opinion. He'll likely settle somewhere ahead of Hartley (25) but worse than Zhou (42).

**Kimi Antonelli**

Kimi is heralded as the next Max Verstappen and his F2 season against the slightly older and more experienced Ollie Bearman does at least not refute that notion. Even though his record isn't quite as intimidating as Verstappen's, if he is that good, Max Verstappen's and Charles Leclerc's rookie seasons would be the best leads we have to speculate on how good Antonelli will be. Verstappen's 2015 was 73 (78), and Leclerc's 2018 was 76 (81). Antonelli is a year older than Verstappen was and 2 years younger than Leclerc. If Antonelli is that guy, he'll likely score in the mid 70s. I'm going with 74 (80). If this is true, he'll be pretty much matching and then overtaking George on pace from 2026 on.

**Gabriel Bortoleto**

Although there are no direct reference points for Bortoleto, his path and age are somewhat reminiscent (if slightly less impressive) of George Russell. Russell's rookie season is rated at 66. Their situations are probably going to be relatively similar as well, driving the worst car in Formula 1, so a similar performance relative to their ceilings is not too unlikely. Low to mid 60s might be where Bortoleto will be rated in 2025.

**Isack Hadjar**

Hadjar seems like a pretty typical lower midlevel F1 rookie, somewhere in the realm between Zhou and Logan Sargeant which would leave him around 50. Hadjar is a bit younger, meaning you would expect him below 50. It is also possible, since parallels have been drawn, that he will end up following his new teammate who had a very poor first year in F1 (46) due to overdriving and inconsistency. I'll go with \~47.

Historically, around 65 would be the middle of the pack, but the current grid is absolutely stacked, meaning that some drivers who would actually be considered pretty good might at the same time be below average. For Example, according to the model, Verstappen debuted as the 6th best driver in 2015. He would have been 12th with the same score in 2024. Of course, it's also very possible, even likely, that at least one driver will underperform uncharacteristically for whatever reason, just like Hamilton did in 2024.","['What is your methodology and maths to come up with these numbers?', ""Obviously speculative, but I assume this can be used for teammate battles and if it can there are some interesting results.\n\nI think people would probably put Ocon and Bearman a bit closer based on Ollie's brief outings last year, even if most agree that Ocon should beat Ollie overall.\n\nOther interesting estimates put Hulk and Borto very close, which is quite bullish on Bortoleto I'd say (even if I agree and I think Bortoleto has quite a lot of potential).\n\nLastly, Albon and Sainz are rated similarly, idk if this is kind on Alex or harsh on Carlos, but I think the general consensus is that Carlos should beat Albon with a bit of a gap at least."", 'Nice work.

1jaztyu,Why is Hamilton Being Given So Much Leeway to Adjust?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jaztyu/why_is_hamilton_being_given_so_much_leeway_to/,2025-03-14, Discussion,"It seems odd to me that one of the most experienced and succesful drivers of all time in lewis Hamilton is having so much leeway given to him by the media and fans in needing ""time to adapt"" and talking about it so much himself.

We don't give this leeway to other drivers (outside of rookies) and don't hear other drivers moaning about it.

Sainz is striaight up to speed at Williams, Ocon and Hulkenberg are expected to be straight on it with their new teams.

But all we hear about and from Hamilton is how hard the transition is and how it is going to take him time to get upto speed.

What is going on here? We didn't hear this when Hamitlon went to Mercedes in 2013, he was on the pace right away beating Rosberg.

Is this signs of Hamilton's age and pace beginning to wane and everyone is in denial or am I missing something?","[""My brother, we've only had FP1 and FP2."", 'Sainz is getting compared to Albon, Hamilton to Leclerc. Nothing against Albon but he aint close to Lec', ""Ocon and Hulkenberg are up against rookies who don't know their cars. Sainz is against a decent team mate, but in a midfield car.\n\nHamilton is up against one of the fastest drivers around, in a leading car. At that level, small things matter. Of course, his age is likely a factor, but it's a vastly different challenge to adapting to a Sauber from a Haas."", ""I love Albon but Leclerc is obviously a far stronger benchmark than him.

His steering wheel he's used for 12 years is also radically different, although Ferrari have tried to adjust it as much as they can. \n\nHe's had the same race engineer for 12 years, which we know is insanely important, as Max has said he would **never** drive in F1 with any other engineer other than GP. \n\nAs far as I can remember, no one else has ever spent that many years at one team and then gone to another to compete at the front against one of the fastest drivers on the grid as his teammate. \n\nIt's genuinely an unusual position to be in, you can't really compare it to anyone else honestly."", 'Sainz was literally in a Williams the day after Abu Dhabi.

You guys seriously underestimate how hard it is to adapt into a new team when you have been with Mercedes for 13 years, and fyi Lewis didn't look that much faster than Nico at Australia either, he just hooked up a banging lap at the end of Q3 whilst Nico bottled it. If you look at Lewis race pace he's already upto speed especially since that was his first proper race run in the 25 Ferrari."", 'There has only been two practice sessions.
