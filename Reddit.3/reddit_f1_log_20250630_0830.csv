1lnhi35,"If you were Toto and Max got on the phone saying he wanted to come to Mercedes, would you get rid of George? or Kimi? or would you refuse Max?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lnhi35/if_you_were_toto_and_max_got_on_the_phone_saying/,2025-06-29, Discussion,"
Personally I'd get rid of Kimi but I'd feel awful doing it. I just couldn't refuse a line up of arguably the two best drivers on the grid.

Max is a Goat tier driver and many in the paddock think he might have as much as two to three tenths on the whole grid. In this years Mercedes I think he could be right in the championship fight.

All that suggest that Kimi has a higher ceiling than George (which is very high) is his junior career, but here’s the kicker, George Russell has a better junior career, and against better competition.

In F1 I don't think you refuse a line up of potentially the two best drivers on the grid just to maintain good vibes and the power of friendship.

This is a competitive sport. If I got a chance to potentially have BOTH of the two best drivers on the grid (I’d put Leclerc > Russell tbf but it’s close) I would do it.

And if you get rid of George and get Max/Kimi you run a big risk of Max obliterating Kimi like he has with so many team mates, Kimi losing all confidence, and when Max retires (which he hints is sooner rather than later) you are left with no George. No Kimi. No Max.

And I feel like keeping George/Kimi and keeping Max is the emotions talking. It would be like 2002 Williams refusing 2002 Michael Schumacher to maintain harmony and good vibes. 

You may say Verstappen and Russell would cost each other points by crashing into each other but I think they would more than make up for the points they lose crashing into each other and simply put, I think a team will have a higher points tally with Max/George than they will with Max/Kimi or George/Kimi.

But what do you think? Im interested to hear other opinions even if they are different from my own because all three options have very strong arguments.","[""Just like with Lewis joining Ferrari you take the deal. Getting a (multiple) world champion on board is always favourable. I'd sign him and see how the season plays out and decide on the other driver later on."", 'Well, no one’s saying no to Max.

Hey all,

So watching the start of the race, I was a bit confused when Carlos made his way to the pits for a pit lane start. I was under the impression that once the marshals assisted his car, he was immediately DSQ'd. It ended up being a non factor, but, I figured I'd post this here to help clear it up for people.

Looking back at the regulations for 2025, in 26.7 it states that a car is DSQ'd for receiving marshal assistance anywhere other than the pit lane. However, it also states that there is an exception for 26.7d where marshals are allowed to assist team personnel to remove the car from the grid. As such, 47.2 takes over and it became a pit lane start for Carlos.

Note that this is not entirely clear because 26.7d specifies after the race start, during the intermission between the start of the formation lap and start of the race is not specified.

**HOWEVER**

Where it becomes more confusing is 44.12 (44 covering race start procedure). 44.12c states that any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car.  44.12d states that they may attempt to restart it once back in the pits. Carlos shuts off his car right before the marshals begin pushing him. They then stop pushing and he restarts the car. Should he not be DSQ'd for restarting his car after receiving assistance? Does that rule change because the race has been aborted at that point?","[""My take was that the race didn't actually start at that point so it was fine for a pitlane start but good question, Not entirely sure what happened there."", 'The FIA activated the fire in his car to DSQ him', ""It's all in the regulations you've posted.\n\n\n47.1:\n\n>If at any time **after the formation lap has commenced and prior to the start of the sprint session or race** a problem arises that could endanger the start, the Race Director may decide the start should be aborted, in such case the following procedures shall apply...\n\nThe race session has not officially started before the race start, including in the case of an Aborted Start.\n\n53.2:\n\n>Except for the circumstances described in Article 26.7d) or Article 57.3, any driver whose car stops in any area other than the Pit Lane during a sprint session or race and receives\nphysical assistance resulting in the car re-joining may be disqualified from that sprint session or race.\n\nThis only applies *during* a race session. As the race has not officially started in an Aborted Start, this doesn't apply."", 'I was thinking that as well, but the fact that he retired right after meant that it doenst really matter.\xa0', ""I don't think it was aborted start when the Marshall's touched the car and that's why they quickly stopped and went back trackside. I'm kinda talking out of my ass here, but I did find it weird how long it took for RC to abort the start when it was so clear it wasn't going to happen."", 'He didn’t start the race, so he simply didn’t participate.\nDNS', ""I believe it's because the race hadn't actually started, might be wrong."", ""I haven't rechecked the footage nor viewed Sainz camera (correct me if i'm wrong)\n\n>any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car. 44.12d states that they may attempt to restart it once back in the pits.\n\nThe issue here is the fact that the car was unable to move while shut off (the first time they tried to push him and didn't move), the marshalls got away to allow Sainz to restart the car, and when he did the issue was resolved."", 'I know you can be pushed onto the pit lane and start but you are right about the fact he wasn’t. However I recall they’ve made it so a pit lane start has to do the formation lap now with the others. So how does that work with being pushed into the pit lane. It’s less clear to me\xa0']",94,41,0.78,94,844,844,-1,1,0.0,-1

It really shows how supreme their tyre management is, however they’re managing it.', ""Current thinking is that McLaren's multi-link front suspension, which splits the lower A arm into two independent suspension elements, helps them better manage tyre temps by having more precise and specific toe control.

If McLaren knew it was going to be a two-stopper, there was no need to give a delta on tyres. At all times, you’d expect both drivers to have tyres in good condition. In fact, staying within DRS range was more critical, as it could gain you about 0.7 seconds per lap.

They fitted the hard tyres — the most durable — and with McLaren being easy on tyres (even Hamilton noted they could last to the end), they likely knew that once a gap was built, there was no way Piastri could close it, especially since both drivers are similar in pace.

They told Piastri: “1.5s gap now, or 4s with the delta.” This is where Piastri may have made a mistake. He should have realized that staying close to Norris was more important than holding the delta.

Also, once Piastri had the delta, he might have considered avoiding the second stop. After his second stop, Norris was 17 seconds behind with 17 laps to go — yet Piastri and his engineer never even discussed staying out until the end.

Anyway, I hope Piastri becomes smart enough to take strategic calls into his own hands when needed.","[""The reason Piastri ended up behind Norris after the pitstops was his own decision.\n\nIf McLaren hadn't given him the choice then I'd agree with you but they did and if he'd decided to stay close and put more pressure on Lando it could ahve been very different"", 'They were never going to split strategy like that, and they also nullified Piastri’s delta by pitting him one lap after Norris instead of the 4 he had gained in the second stint.', ""Piastri was going to drop out of DRS even if he stopped a lap later.

1lntfme,Annoying Announcers - Austrian GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lntfme/annoying_announcers_austrian_gp/,2025-06-29, Discussion,"So I’m probably going to get killed here but am I the only one (American viewer) who find the high pitched screams of the announcers on both Sky F1 (Crofty had the race off) and F1TV almost intolerable?  Less is more sometimes. Karun on Sky couldn’t get a word in edgewise because Harry Benjamin was screaming out babble. 

Maybe they are trying to emulate their F1 announcing hero Murray Walker but it’s effing 2025. Update your style. Unless that the announcing tradition in the UK.  ","['Nah, they good. This isn’t the NFL.\n\nCan’t speak to the Sky broadcast, but F1tv was fine and even Coulthard was on point today with the banter.', ""I don't care, F1 has Jolyon and DC, I like that combo.\n\nDC is hands down the best commentator of the moment, not even close.  OK so Rosberg maybe, but he's more a treat than a regular."", 'I always miss Martin Brundle when hes not there. The best analysis and usually right about things. I also miss Croft.', 'Today was the B team lol', 'I had no problem with the announcers at this race.', 'I like my announcers to get excited when exciting things are happening.', 'I personally find the F1TV commentary, as the Brits would say, minted', 'Watch with the F1TV team. Joylon Palmer is a gift to F1 commentary.', ""They aren't a good pairing.\n\nKarun needs to iron out some of his mistakes. Also he, at some point was saying how Norris hadn't put a foot wrong all race, half a lap after Piastri was within passing range into turn 1. Obviously Norris made a mistake for Piastri to be that close at that part of the track, which I expect the expert commentator to pick up on. I don't rate Benjamin""]",0,81,0.29,0,70,70,0,3,0.0,0
