The proposed loop looked like it would run around Emu Mountain Road and Peregian Springs Drive, tow main roads that are narrow and feature multiple roundabouts — which could make it a really tricky and technical layout for F1 cars.

The leak didn’t give full details, but the map suggested a tight course rather than the wide, open circuits fans are used to, raising questions about safety and overtaking opportunities. While no official confirmation has been made, the idea of a full Formula 1 event on these suburban roads is quite a debateble topic in my opinion.

Weird that they would also hold a race in a town of only 2,000 people out of anywhere, the might to the lower division races here instead.

Even with the challenges, the possibility of a street race through a normally quiet residential area is exciting. I can just imagine cars blasting through corners that I sometimes drive on. Whether this goes anywhere or stays just a false leak remains to be seen, but it’s got me wondering. I would appreciate to have anyone's thoughts.","['Looks boring to be honest', ""Source: somebody's ass.\n\nI really don't think is a serious rumor.
