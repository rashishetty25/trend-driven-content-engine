When do you think it was the beginning of the end for him, why was it so abrupt and did you ever get a glimpse of hope from him after that?

Personally even if he's a gentleman and won four WDC's, he's probably one of the least impressive multichampions as there were very few instances of him making the most out of bad machinery. For me it was Hockenheim 2018 when he was never the same after that.

Also interesting to see a parallel with Ricciardo, who much like Vettel, had this kind of abrupt downfall and wasnt very adaptable to different cars. ","[""The real peak of his success was getting the most out of the blown diffuser technology and when that became less significant his advantage waned. \n\n\nHe was still very good but he took three big psychological hits:\n\n-Losing to Ricciardo in 2014\n\n-Crashing out of the lead at the 2018 German Grand Prix (this was the biggest in my view, he never recovered after this)\n\n-It becoming clear he was going to be ditched for Leclerc\n\nWith hindsight he probably shouldn't have bothered with Aston Martin and retired at the end of 2020 because his heart clearly wasn't in it anymore."", 'After he won the 2018 Belgian Grand Prix, he only won more Grand Prix.

I think he was very car sensitive. He was obviously good through 2008-2013 but possibly not always as good as he looked. In 2009, 2010 and the first half of 2012 Webber was closer than he would have been to a truly generational driver. \n\nObviously Ricciardo was better than him in 2014 but I think Vettel had a strong 2015. He then seemed to get slightly worse every year from then on."", 'I mean yeah it was general opinion around his prime that he wasn’t the best driver on the grid especially in 2012. That wasn’t the case when I was growing up with Schumer or even Max now', '2020 knowing he would lose his seat and having that shit car. I think his motivation was gone and the decline was very big', 'Get Vettel in a car that suits and he was a machine. One of the best, consistent, fast, great on tyres.  \n\nIn the earlier championship years, he wasn’t the greatest at wheel to wheel, but it rarely mattered and when it did, he normally managed to keep it together. I think a lot of was poor risk assessment, we had seen that in races throughout his career. \n\nEven in cars that weren’t great, there were glimpses of his talent (Silverstone, Japan, Singapore 2014, 2016 wasn’t terrible in a pretty lacklustre car, 2015 was very strong but car was decent). Much of this I class as a motivational issue, seen the same with Hamilton from time to time, once it’s clear you’re not racing for anything, then the extra few percent above the others goes away, often until a race a driver particularly enjoys comes and you see them reappear. \n\nI’m not sure Germany was the cliff drop everyone says it was, he come back in Spa, and Ferrari fumbled their development shortly after which stumbled his run for 2018, towards the end when Ferrari reverted to older spec the speed came back, but others has progressed in that time. \n\nUltimately I think it was the internal politics of Ferrari getting in the way, once Marchionne was gone, it was well rumoured Ferrari split into two camps, and the team wide support was gone. 2017 wouldn’t have helped, where Vettel crashed himself out of real contention for the WDC. This was his biggest career mistake, in an otherwise very strong season. \n\nHe brought the only real challenge to Mercedes/Hamilton until 2021, when his teammate was nowhere, podium most races in 2015/2016.

1i4lv7j,Is Norris ready to become World Champion?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i4lv7j/is_norris_ready_to_become_world_champion/,2025-01-19, News,,"[""If he puts in performances like Abu Dhabi and Baku last year he'll easily be in the fight, it's just about cutting down on the needless mistakes that were present in Brazil and even the double yellows in Qatar if Lando can get on top of that he really has no reason not to be a contender, and even win this season, I don't think his wheel to wheel racing is actually as poor as people make it out to be, it's just when you're going up against the greatest wheel to wheel racer on the grid right now it'll undoubtedly be tougher then racing anybody else. If Lando also keeps Oscar in check throughout the year which he's done pretty well over these past two seasons he'll probably have a shot against either Leclerc or Verstappen both of whom I expect to be his main competitors."", 'Nah. Im sure Lando will want another year or two behind Max and being cool with it.  FFS.  The stupid headlines these days.', 'If they have a strong car at the beginning of the season, it’s possible', 'Yeah, he’s proven he learns and grows all the time. Is as quick as anybody and only 25', ""Honestly, Barretto and Co. will spend all season pumping up Lando as if he still has a mountain to climb.  \n\nBut he is the favorite going in to the season.  McLaren had the fastest car... Ferrari was close, but they are changing their car significantly, who knows if that'll work or not.  Verstappen dragged that Red Bull kicking and screaming to the title by year's end - that team is playing catch up.  Mercedes also has ground to make up.  \n\n  \nWe'll how testing and week 1 shakes out...but I imagine it is Lando's title to lose unless McLaren somehow really botch the car."", ""Well if they have a fastest car he just has to beat Piastri, which he has done very well for 2 seasons. Very very difficult though if it's a 3 way fight between Ferrari Mclaren and Redbull."", 'McLaren always said 2025 is the year they expect to be competing for championships so if they bring a car that can competes for wins from the get go then I don’t see why Lando doesn’t have a better chance than last year. Expecially since Ferrari is bringing an all new car to suit Lewis and Redbull has to solve their issues from the RB20. So if both Redbull and\xa0Ferrari screw up their cars and Mercedes are still confused I’d say Lando has a better chance of beating\xa0Oscar for the drivers based on last season.\n\nPersonally I’m hoping for a season like 2010 where we have 5 drivers in contention in the fight for the championship.', ""It's either him or Charles winning it this upcoming season."", 'In my opinion, he would have to have SIGNIFICANTLY improved over the break. \n\nMax is in an entirely different league, and idk if he can be stopped even with Red Bulls decline in performance.']",0,128,0.25,0,256,256,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
