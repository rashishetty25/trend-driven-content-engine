Hope you like it","[""I like your work, but I wanted to explain ideal laps for people who do not know. What an ideal lap time is is sticking all of their best sectors together across all their laps in a session.\n\nHowever, it very often isn't physically possible to do all these sectors at the same time. A large reason that's easy to understand is ERS (energy reserve system) deployment. They get a boost in speed when they want. In one lap in a session, they might have used the ERS on sector one and had their fastest sector one then. On another lap, they might have deployed more of it in sector two, on another lap in sector 3. The sectors through a total lap are also affected by tire management through the lap, or how a corner is taken. Practice is for trying out a lot of different things. Someone might take the last corner of a sector in a way that's fast for the first sector but slower for the next sector on one lap, and on another lap, they might try it the other way, which gets a better second sector time."", 'Keep in mind for a quali run you‚Äôre probably overcooking your tires if you push too hard throughout all sectors.

Pushing hard for a purple Sector can easily result in overcooked tires by the time you get to Sector 3. This weekend in particular, teams are having trouble (as of FP1) figuring out how to get the most of the new C6 over the full duration of a lap, so we‚Äôre seeing a lot drivers set purples in one sector with yellows in the next sector.

So someone at the FIA does know the exact shape/materials of the McLaren brake ducts, but they may not have been able to figure out why that shape works so well.', 'To the media they can lie as they want.\n\nTo the FIA, not really.

1komfkl,[AMuS] Who will finish second behind McLaren?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1komfkl/amus_who_will_finish_second_behind_mclaren/,2025-05-17, News,,"['Too early to tell, but Mercedes. Ferrari is Ferrari, and Red Bull is a one-man team.', 'Translation:\n\n> **McLaren proved to be vastly superior on the first day of practice at Imola. Over one lap and over the entire race. The only question now is: Who will finish second? Ferrari has the best chances in the long run, but they\'re one lap behind.**\n\n> After McLaren\'s one-two victory at the Miami GP, everyone was wondering: Could it be even more dominant? It could be, if the first day of practice in Imola were to be the benchmark for the rest of the weekend. This time, the McLarens had the better of the competition, even on one lap, with a lead of almost three-tenths. In the long run, that\'s for sure. There\'s a world of difference between McLaren and the rest.\n\n> The race for victory will be between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Piastri beat his teammate by 0.025 seconds on one lap. In the race simulation, Norris had the edge by 0.045 seconds. However, Piastri completed two more laps on the medium tires. The close race between the Papaya Boys could be quite exciting for spectators. Perhaps less so for the McLaren command bridge. Will the first clash, which McLaren boss Zak Brown says is inevitable, take place in Imola?\n\n> Things remain exciting behind McLaren as well. On one lap, Mercedes has a minimal lead over Red Bull and Ferrari. Things are different in the long runs, where Ferrari excelled. Charles Leclerc\'s lap times averaged just two-tenths of a second better than McLaren\'s. ""But that only helps us if we\'re ahead of our opponents on the starting grid,"" team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur told his team. Imola is a track with a built-in overtaking ban.\n\n> In the midfield, Alpine shone on one lap with the new C6 tire. Williams was stronger on the medium C5 compound. As a whole, you have to trust Williams more. Carlos Sainz\'s long run was over half a second faster per lap than Pierre Gasly\'s.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n\n> **1) Is McLaren unbeatable again?**\nThe first practice session ended with a one-two finish for McLaren. Oscar Piastri finished ahead of Lando Norris. But the lead over third-placed Carlos Sainz was razor-thin at 52 thousandths of a second. All were on the new C6 compound. The second practice session, on the medium tires, presented a similar picture: Norris ahead of Sainz, separated by only 0.040 seconds. There was still hope that McLaren would at least have to fight for pole position.\n\n> But on the soft tires, McLaren then unleashed a blast. Piastri and Norris were within just 0.025 seconds of each other. Everyone else, including Pierre Gasly at the front, was almost three-tenths behind. With a time difference of 1.127 seconds for the entire field, that\'s a class difference. Things got even worse for the rivals in the long runs. Only Ferrari was able to keep up. All the other drivers were on average half a second slower per lap. While the McLarens maintained their lap times consistently, their rivals\' times improved after five laps.\n\n> **2) Has Red Bull solved its problems?**\n\nYes and no. Even the Imola upgrade only partially cured the RB21\'s weaknesses. Max Verstappen initially reported understeer at the apex and oversteer on corner exit. But by the second practice session, the understeer had disappeared. ""Nevertheless, we lost four-tenths to the McLarens. That\'s too much. And in the race, the McLarens seem to be in a class of their own again,"" lamented Sporting Director Helmut Marko. Compared to the other teams, the assessment is cautious. ""We ran our normal program, but we have the feeling that some of them were perhaps a bit lighter.""\n\n> The latest development stage hasn\'t entirely failed to achieve its intended effect, but it hasn\'t brought Red Bull significantly closer to McLaren or away from its fellow sufferers Mercedes and Ferrari. Furthermore, the car bounces over bumps and curbs‚Äîa long-standing problem that has plagued Red Bull for two years now. Yuki Tsunoda\'s eighth-place finish was surprising, but even more so was the small time difference of 0.092 seconds. ""No one has been this close to Max in a long time. Yuki doesn\'t mind the oversteer as much. He complains less,"" Marko noted. The small time difference could also tell a different story, however. Namely, that Verstappen wasn\'t yet at his best. The world champion usually strikes when things get serious.\n\n(1/2)', '""Most competitive season yet""', '***Reaaaalllly*** interesting and helpful article. Thanks for the full translation!\n\nAnother interesting aspect, echoing recent races, is the apparently much better traction off the line from P2 on the grid. \n\nHave a look at the analysis by @lowerlaptime aka Martin on YT. \n\nThe C6 and the performances to date by Carlos and Pierre open up hope for their teams and the possibility of some teams going for a two-stop strategy.', 'I mean in reality the top 5 will be probably a couple of tenths in it. It‚Äôs also Imola.', 'I think a formula 1 car might finish after the McLarens.\xa0', 'Qualifying pace is too tight to say McLaren will definitely win', ""Watching a TP interview and yeah they don't want to go two-stop either."", 'Max Verstappen\xa0']",26,33,0.72,26,31,31,10,5,0.039999999999999925,10
