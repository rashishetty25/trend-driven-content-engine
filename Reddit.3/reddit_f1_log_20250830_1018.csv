Verstappen is talented but if the car isn't fully optimised to score wins and halt McLaren's trajectory for their own gain, then it'll be difficult.

I feel horrible for George and I'm worried for him."", ""And even (if the rumours are true) when the best athlete in a discipline wants to have negotiations with your team as team manager it is your responsibility to at least have them. Besides, as many have mentioned this whole charade is not about 2026 but about 2027.\n\nIn the event that Russell leaves Mercedes after 2026 (which I personally wouldn't like) he will certainly have several offers from interesting teams such as AM or RBR.

Please calm down. If anything were to happen to Russell, it is not the end of the world.
