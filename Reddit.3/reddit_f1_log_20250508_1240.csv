They've all dominated in feeder series like F2/F3 or even Formula E, but stepping into an F1 car is a whole different beast. Everything is on another level. They're suddenly racing against seasoned pros who've been honing their craft for years.

And the problem is, these rookies often aren't given much breathing room to actually learn and develop. If they don't deliver stellar results almost immediately, the knives start coming out. Teams are under immense pressure to perform, and unfortunately, young drivers can be seen as the easiest variable to change if things aren't going to plan.

It's a pretty cutthroat environment. One bad race, or even a couple of slightly off performances, and suddenly their seat is under threat. Where's the time for them to really understand the nuances of the car, figure out their driving style in this new machinery, and build confidence? It feels like they're constantly under the microscope, judged on every single lap.

You see flashes of brilliance, for sure. A stunning qualifying lap here, a gutsy overtake there. But consistency, the hallmark of a top F1 driver, takes time and experience. Maybe we need to rethink how we integrate these young talents, give them a longer leash, and acknowledge that becoming an F1 star isn't an overnight thing. It's a tough gig, and expecting instant perfection might just be setting them up for failure.","['Except not all rookies straight up dominate f3 or f2\n\nIf you are talking about Doohan, he didnt win neither f3 or f2, despite having multiple shots.\n\nAnd if he is unlucky, then what can Pourchaire, Drugo say?

1kgye8z,Pitlane Championship Round 6: Miami - Williams dominance could bore fans!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kgye8z/pitlane_championship_round_6_miami_williams/,2025-05-07, Statistics,"Albon takes the win for the third times in 6 races, with Sainz overtaking Norris with a strong P2 finish to take 2nd in the standings, making it a Williams 1-2.. who have also finished 1-2 for the second time this season.

Norris still in the fight bringing home 10 points in P5 but the gap with Albon is increasing and now he also has to deal with Sainz.

Further back Hulkenberg picks up his best result of the season with a third place, propelling him up the order from P18 to just outside the top 10 and settles in at P11.

Yuki still on the bottom end every weekend, seems like he is still very cautious in the pitlane, him and Alonso still failing to score a top 10 finish this season.

Max is meaningfully alongside for entry, mid-corner and exit, but because Piastri ""won"" it by being on the inside, he can just shepherd Max off. If Max was truly carrying too much speed, and was given a car\'s space, we\'d have found that out anyway because he would have missed the corner anyway. However, we don\'t even really get that - ""no more track for you"" is legal. I feel like a lot of fans feel that it\'s cathartic that it happened to Max and are happy that a new driver is beating him and... well, I get it.

Is every single corner a competition of efficiently working out that you\'re allowed to run someone off and doing it now?\n\nWell, Max did it to Lando *again* at Miami - he\'s just allowed to tell Lando ""no more track for you"" even though he\'s meaningfully alongside. This one doesn\'t end in disaster, but how is *any of this* normal? How is any of this the racing this sport has been known for? Did ""all of the time you have to leave a space"" not become a viral meme for over a decade? Where did this sentiment go?\n\nI think it\'s awful racing no matter who\'s guilty. Max is by far the most guilty, but Oscar has learned hard and is just going to do it as much over and over all season now because he\'s being rewarded for it.

This is just the new normal?\n\nGet me off this train. I\'ve been watching for 20 years and no other series in the world allows what we\'re seeing now.
