1ox439g,Updates from today's F1 Commission meeting. Limits to bare carbon fibre; Drivers changing numbers; tyre life and pit stop proposals,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ox439g/updates_from_todays_f1_commission_meeting_limits/,2025-11-14, News,"The fourth and final meeting of the Formula 1 Commission in 2025 took place today, November 14 at the offices of the FIA in London. The meeting was chaired by FIA Single-Seater Director Nikolas Tombazis and FOM President and CEO Stefano Domenicali.

**2026 Technical and Sporting Regulations**

Following discussion at the meeting, a raft of refinements to the 2026 Technical, Sporting, Financial and Operational Regulations will be submitted to the World Motor Sport Council on December 10.

A proposal to explore mandatory two pit stops for grands prix was discussed along with adjustments to tyre specifications, tyre-life limits and the use of three compounds during the race. The discussion centred on feedback on analysis and simulations from teams and Pirelli. No changes were presently agreed, but it was agreed that talks on this topic would continue during the 2026 season.


**Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR)**

Changes to Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR) are being developed to bring Formula 1 into line with contemporary processing and simulation technology while mindful of cost considerations.


**Car liveries and driver numbers**

Following discussions with the Technical Advisory Committee, the topic of a minimum surface requirement limit for car liveries in 2026 was discussed.

It was agreed by Commission representatives that a minimum of 55% of surface area (when viewed from the side and above) must be covered by painted or stickered liveries as opposed to bare carbon fibre surfaces. The objective of this measure is to increase visual differentiation between cars.

Changes to the regulation on permanent competition numbers for drivers, introduced for the 2014 season, were discussed. It was agreed that a proposal for drivers to change their numbers during their career would be permitted.

 
**Driving Cooling System**

The potential mandating of the Driving Cooling System (DCS) for 2026 was discussed. Re-designs to the current DCS and cooling garments were proposed along with an increased weight allowance for use of the DCS. Further driver feedback will be sought in parallel with the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association (GPDA).","["">It was agreed that a proposal for drivers to change their numbers during their career would be permitted.\n\nI wonder who's going to be the first driver to change their number, considering it becomes a part of their branding identity.\n\n>a minimum of 55% of surface area (when viewed from the side and above) must be covered by painted or stickered liveries as opposed to bare carbon fibre surfaces.\n\nBasically this prevents another Alpine A524 scenario, i'm glad we'll see more colorful cars from now on. (Though I kinda wanted the bare carbon Williams FW44 to be a thing, the bare carbon SF23 used by Cadillac for testing looks gorgeous)"", ""I'm sure that failure to meet 55% visible livery would just be a fine, but imagine the drama of a car getting DQ'd from a win because they changed their aero midseason but didn't adjust their livery and fell below that 55% and another team analyzed their paint and ratted them out."", 'This is pretty positive imo. The 55% paint is definitely a step in the right direction.

I'm sick of all the cars being 75% black.\n\n55% still seems pretty low though. I really miss the days of when the entire grid was colourful."", ""I think mandatory two stops is dumb. We saw what happen I believe in Qatar. Everyone had the same exact lineup and it suck. One stops aren't fun either if everyone does 90% of the race on one tire. What I want is tires that fall off a cliff again. Not tires losing only 5% of their performance so they eventually pit. I mean tires utterly falling off a cliff so that Lando gets blown past by the driver in last place if Yuki has fresh tires and blows past him. That the best. Say Max is chasing Lando for example. There only 15 laps left. The tires are good for 10 laps (I'm making stuff up so roll with it.) Lando tires might let him make it to the end but if they fall off it over. It be a nail biter till the end. I think Mexico 2023 was a good example with Lewis."", 'The livery requirements will make the reveals fun. If they are going to keep Monaco, it should be required for teams to run a legacy livery if available (subject to sponsor changes) or an alternate livery if no older one is available.', '>""No changes were presently agreed, but it was agreed that talks on this topic would continue during the 2026 season.""\n\nThank the lord.\n\nIf they ever introduce a mandatory 2 stop rule i might just lose my shit.

One that completely ignores all the actual issues with current tires and cars.\n\nSuch a change would also spit on everything that makes modern F1 so exciting at times with varying strategies.\n\nRussell not to be win at SPA? Gone. Leclercs Monza 1 stop heroics to win. Gone. Max\'s crazy good stint at Mexico? Gone. Lawson\'s heroics in Brazil?

The current regulations seems to have failed at improving the actual racing on track so i was wondering if Liberty Media is working on that and if there will be aerodynamics changes related to track action.","['They will be slightly thinner than the current tyres thuswill have lower grip', 'They will have new aerodynamics, and yes, improving racing will again be one of the core objectives.\n\nThe tyres will be slightly narrower and smaller in diamerer. It is obviously a new construction and the compounds get reworked as well. What we know is that Pirelli aim for a conservative construction and a larger pace difference between compounds (target is 7-8 tenths up from 5) to cover a wider range of potential car performance.\n\nHow these tyres will turn out to work is nothing that can easily be predicted. We will have to wait and see on that.', ""Mostly the same tires really\n\nAlso worth pointing out, these regulations haven't failed despite public opinion, they're still some of the closest racing we've had in the entire history\n\nYes we will see an increase again  \nGive it a couple of years though and in 3-4 years time they will be worse than what we had this season"", ""we're drawing a unknown, there have been discussions about mandatory 2 stop races, and as gor tha last bit, all of this isnt Liberty Media's are of experties, lol, its the FIA. FOM doesnt manage the rules and regs, that all FIA"", 'They will be almost the same.', ""I read that they will be the same. The car's body will be lighter and smaller"", 'They\'re a different diameter, width, and wheel size and sidewall height. They wont be ""the same"" in any way.', 'This Is good and could improved racing in some tracks']",21,8,0.78,21,8,8,-2,0,-0.030000000000000027,-2
1ox3ivv,"Regardless if Piastri or Norris win the WDC, it will be historic for the sport.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ox3ivv/regardless_if_piastri_or_norris_win_the_wdc_it/,2025-11-14, Discussion,"Verstappen still has a mathematical chance of winning the WDC, but the likelihood that Norris or Piastri win is greater. When that does likely happen, it will be pretty historic that ends of run of dominance by Red Bull and Mercedes. 

Norris/Lando would break the F1 WDC record of longest conscience wins by the same two constructors. A Red Bull or Mercedes driver has won last the 14 WDC among Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, and Max Verstappen. It also inches McLaren closer to tying Ferrari’s F1 leading 15 WDC by a constructor. 

The next closest run was from 1984-1993 when McLaren and Williams won 10 straight WDC with Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, and Nigel Mansell

It will stop another record from being broken as Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton are tied for the longest WDC consecutive streak of the same 2 drivers at 7 years. This is tied with Juan Manuel Fangio and Alberto Ascari also winning 7 straight years from 1951-1957

Maybe it’s because McLaren has had the fastest car on the grid for about a season and a half now, but this will truly mark an end of dominate era of F1. Feels like it’s not as big of a deal, but it truly is. Redbull and Mercedes have dominated the hybrid era (and the final stages of the V8 era) with so many changes over the last 14 years including the cost cap, ground effect being reintroduced, the mandating of the halo cockpit, the ever increasing size of the F1 car, DRS system, banning in-race refueling, etc.  Jensen Button’s winning car from 2009 looks so different and operated in such a different environment from the McLaren that will be on display likely soon. 

Obviously there is a chance that this is just a blip and Red Bull and Mercedes nail the 2026 regulations and Max Vertstappen still does indeed exist. Does just go to show how remarkable Red Bull and Mercedes run is given all the changes and still staying dominant and even the streak Verstappen and Hamilton have been on.

I think I’m really going to try and enjoy the last few races of the season because this is shaping up to be a historic season as I outlined and it could mark the end of an era. Does McLaren start a new era like Schumacher did to Williams and McLaren or will this just be a blip in the record books of a small win that’s overshadowed by more dominance from Red Bull and Mercedes?","['When was the last time a customer team won the WDC? Thats the real change of the era.\n\n(To be clear, I don’t view RB as a customer team because although they didn’t make their own engines, they were designed and made solely for them for the years they were successful.)', "">Maybe it’s because McLaren has had the fastest car on the grid for about a season and a half now, but this will truly mark an end of dominate era of F1.\n\nOr its the beginning of McLaren having their run at the top with their own dominant vehicle.\n\nI'm not saying that will happen, but so many scoffed at the thought that Merc would be where they ended up when Lewis joined, so its not a sure thing that McLaren is going away anytime soon."", ""2026 is Ferrari's year"", 'Still Mercedes engines though. lol', ""I'm happy for whoever wins it and they will deserve it, Lando for his late charge i think has got it and it's great to have a new champion"", ""I'm glad that we saw the top shaken up within one set of regulations. It seems like the introduction of the cost cap has been largely positive, with the field now being much closer and getting at least a *little* variance. The changes over the past two years have been fun and now we're already heading into new regs which will shake things up even more."", 'You forgot Mika Hakkinen and Schumi who also won 7 from 98 to 2004', 'What\'s a ""longest conscience win""?', ""It's always awesome to see first points, first podiums, first wins, and first championships. That's in order of rarity too. We're almost guaranteed the latter at the end of the season. I don't mind who it is. It will be nice to see.""]",0,75,0.46,0,432,432,0,0,0.0,0
1oxiezc,How many rounds will it take for Audi to score their first points in Formula 1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oxiezc/how_many_rounds_will_it_take_for_audi_to_score/,2025-11-15, Discussion,"As a huge supporter of Audi motorsport, I am extremely excited for the new Audi entry into Formula 1. I want your guys' opinion on how much success we will have next year. Historically, first-year works teams have done quite poorly, but I think there are too many experienced and talented people for this to be a complete flop. My prediction is it will take until the fourth round, at Bahrain, but those more knowledgeable than me I'm sure can give me a reality check. Obviously this is all hypothetical, and nobody really has any idea what will happen, but I like thinking about it anyway. I was gonna wait until near the start of the season for this post, but with all the hype surrounding Audi and the early launch this week, I thought I'd do it now. Maybe I'll repost it closer to the start of the season when there's more information to actually go off of.","['30 years ago, Sebastian Vettel told us: I have two balls, but neither of them is crystal.', 'Nico will catch a p8 by race 3.

We know shit about fuck about next year's rankings"", 'I think at the beginning of next season it will pretty much be an engine formula, and in that respect Audi are well placed given their experience in WEC (and rival teams seem to think so given they nerfed possible rule changes to increase energy generated by front axle regeneration.)

1oxs5yk,Doohan better than Colapinto,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oxs5yk/doohan_better_than_colapinto/,2025-11-15, Discussion,"Alpine make a mistake by signing Colapinto, he has not scored a single point this season and has had significantly more races than Doohan to try. They should have kept Doohan for several more races at least at the start of the year. There has not been an impressive drive from him yet. I'm disappointed in Alpine for chasing the sponsor money and not signing a different competitive driver or rookie; there are many people who do not have a seat next year who are likely better than him.
