1htcxty,[Motorsport IT] F1 | Ferrari: Fiorano and Barcelona to prepare Hamilton in red,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1htcxty/motorsport_it_f1_ferrari_fiorano_and_barcelona_to/,2025-01-04, News,,"['Finally the photoshops will stop.', ""**Translation:**\n\n  \n*The Scuderia has defined an ‘elastic’ test programme for Lewis's preparation after the FIA introduced stricter limits: from this year, the full-time drivers will be able to do a thousand kilometres in four days with the Previous Cars. Hamilton will be busy at Fiorano and then Barcelona. The dates are still up in the air depending on the weather.*\n\n  \nOne thousand kilometres in four days. That's how long Lewis Hamilton will have to get acclimatised with Ferrari's working system before the launch of the 2025 single-seater (19 February) and the tour de force that will follow, namely a filming day and the three days of collective testing in Bahrain.\n\nAt Maranello they have planned an ‘elastic’ test programme to ensure the best possible weather conditions considering the limitations of January. The aim is to secure test days in acceptable track conditions to complete the work that has been planned for some time.\n\nThe eagerly awaited debut of the seven-time world champion behind the wheel of a Ferrari (the choice is between the 2022 or 2023 single-seater) is scheduled to take place at the Fiorano circuit, a day that could vary (depending on weather conditions) from 20 to 21 January.\n\nAccording to information gathered by [Motorsport.com](http://Motorsport.com), the test programme will continue in the final days of January at the Barcelona circuit, with the hope of finding milder temperatures. In this case too, Ferrari has guaranteed themselves a window of several days (at least four) in order to postpone the test in the event of bad weather. A measure that has also become necessary because of the new regulations regarding TPC (Testing of Previous Cars) tests, i.e. tests with single-seaters used at least two seasons before the current one.\n\nLast 11 December, the FIA published a new version of the sporting regulations with several new features, including the paragraph regulating TPC tests. Paragraph ‘g’ of Article 10.2 introduces new limits: if a TPC test is carried out by a driver participating in the F1 World Championship, it will be subject to distance and duration constraints. A maximum mileage (in the calendar year) of 1,000 km has been introduced, which can be completed in a maximum of four different test days. For drivers not registred in the F1 world championship, the days are increased to twenty, with no mileage limit.\n\nIn Hamilton's case every lap will be precious, especially now that the kilometres have been capped. A tightening, the one introduced by the FIA, which came after the controversy raised last year by some teams following tests conducted within the rules but outside the spirit of the regulations.\n\nOne of the most commented cases was the test day organised in June last year by Red Bull at the Imola circuit, when Max Verstappen took to the track with the 2022 single-seater for some technical checks, going against the reasons for which the TPC tests were originally conceived, namely to offer an opportunity for drivers who need to familiarise themselves with driving a F1 car and with working methods.\n\nThe 1,000 kilometres allowed by the regulations give a driver the chance to acclimatise and familiarise himself with the working system, which is the case for Hamilton as it is for all drivers making their debut in a new team.\n\nLewis will have four days in which the team will try to make it as easy as possible for him to settle in, and then, from the first day of testing in Bahrain with the 2025 single-seater, we will start talking about performance.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", ' Cold conditions, SF-23 is perfect for that', 'This is going to be so good.', 'This is going to be the best thing and nothing can convince me otherwise.', 'I really hope at some point in his Ferrari stint Lewis gets to drive the SF70H and SF71H.', 'Sike !

The way it covered Pierre Gasly in 2019, for example, was terrific, they gave him an entire character arc with a good ending that very much reflected reality and it went a long way to show just how narrative-driven F1 can be. \n\nBack when I first started watching F1 in 2004 you always used to hear the ITV team talk about how much of a soap opera F1 was and what I see DTS doing is tapping into that potential in order to expand the sport’s audience.

It does not teach you anything about F1.\nIt does not explain the rules, it does not explain the technology.\n\n\nEven worse, they are just randomly stringing together clips from different races. DtS is purposely giving you a wrong idea of what happened during a certain race.\xa0', 'What exactly does it introduce apart from team names and drivers?

It's about introducing the personalities of the drivers and the teams as well as the overall narrative of the season more than anything else.\n\nThere are other resources available to explain the rules and technicalities of the sport if that's what you prefer \n\nAlso, I don't really think it's as inaccurate as you're making it out to be.""]",7,19,0.78,7,15,15,-1,2,-0.05999999999999994,-1
1hsvp0r,Ferrari passed FIA crash test,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hsvp0r/ferrari_passed_fia_crash_test/,2025-01-03, Discussion,"So, Ferrari passed the FIA crash test, which to me sounds like a good thing you know? But a lot of people are acting like it's the end of the world.. Why do they say that if a f1 car passes the crash tests easily, then it's a bad thing? I don't have much knowledge on the topic of the cars and how 1 thing has impact on another so sorry 
People were claiming that it means that the car will be slower?? Or that's it's just ""bad"". Help? ","[""I think it really depends on the year - in this case, we're on basically the same regulations as last year, so if they are not overhauling the main structure that much for this years' car and already know they've minimized the mass of the structural stuff - they may have just been able to build it on the early end, get it done and that's that.  The efforts are more going to work on the aero (floor, wings and other dangly bits) that are not crash critical."", 'There are two schools of thought.\n\nIf you pass early, some say you probably could have made the car lighter (and lighter = faster) because you’re meant to fail, add weight, try again, over and over until you finally reach a balance of the lightest car that can pass the crash test.\n\nHowever if you pass extremely late, you might have to frantically pile a ton of weight on to get the car through because the concept is wrong. That’s what happened to Alpine in 2024, and they had a grossly overweight car to begin with because of it.\n\nFWIW, Ferrari and Aston were the first to pass in 2024.', ""It means absolutely nothing. Just pointless speculation about fans who know nothing about how Ferrari operates (and never will).\n\nCrash tests are just a standard safety procedure. Teams know how to pass it and can do it quite easily. Sometimes they don't quite make it the first time, because of how strict the test is. That has nothing to do with how fast the car might be. Maybe they just need to add a tiny bit of material in one place.\n\nThe teams always make it in the end, without much trouble (unless the team is incompetent and struggling to even build a functioning car). Red Bull failed the crash test multiple times in one pre-season recently and still ended up champions."", 'It doesn’t mean much. Didn’t Red Bull failed theirs like 2 or 3 times last year?', 'Just wait till test day in Bahrain and FP1 in Australia. One way to learn if a car is good is during test day, who ever makes the most laps in all 3 days will equal a good car. Exaple Williams in 2023 and HAAS in 2024 both teams did in total of 400 laps and were preaty competitive in those years. Williams 2023 and HAAS 2024.\n\nEdit: sry for the misspell', ""I wouldn't read too much into it this year... This is now going into the 4th year of this regulation, also this year's cars even though the may be a new design they're basically going to be evolutions of last years cars with the completely new regs coming next season.  Think more along the line of hundreds of small changes to last years cars  instead of new complete clean sheet of paper designs."", 'To answer your question, the idea is that if you pass your crash test too easily your car is unnecessarily safe.. typically what you want is to be just on the wrong side of the limit and then add material to the failed site.\n\nHaving said that no one knows what Ferrari have done and what their procedure is. The above answer is just to explain to you why people are reasoning it is a bad thing to pass on the first try.\nFor example Red Bull is known to regularly fail on their first try and then add reinforcements ..', 'Will Alpine pass the test though ?', '![gif](giphy|jV0wXGqzUXNXFmShkC|downsized)', 'It could mean that they didn’t reach the full potential of the car they’re developing, because they could have pushed it farther, make it light enough that it fails the first time so they know exactly how much weight is the minimum required to pass. \n\nBut I don’t think there’s really a significant correlation between performance and speed of crash testing, at least I haven’t seen anyone go through and check that data.']",0,22,0.45,0,287,287,0,0,-0.019999999999999962,0
