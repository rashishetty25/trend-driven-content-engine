While he will start the championship with rookie Jack Doohan as a team-mate, he will discover another collaboration, but looks forward very positively to 2023 and 2024.\n\nDespite some tense moments, right up to the controversial collision at the Monaco Grand Prix last May, the French driver considers that Alpine was lucky to have this duo, particularly in the way it salvaged an unexpected sixth place in the constructors' championship last year.\n\n‚ÄúIt's true that we haven't really had the opportunity to say goodbye,‚Äù confided Pierre Gasly on Tuesday in London, when Esteban Ocon had left Alpine for Haas prematurely, not taking part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. ‚ÄúI think it was, when you think about it, the kind of story that we'll find hallucinating in twenty or thirty years' time. When we were told it was impossible to make it in F1, we both made it, in the same French team. It's a very beautiful story, with the podium in Brazil that will remain memorable.‚Äù\n\n**Fortunately, there were two drivers like us, both talented and motivated.**\n\nPierre Gasly also believes that the 100% French duo, while explosive on paper, proved the most skeptical of the pairing wrong.\n\n‚ÄúWe've proved that we're professionals,‚Äù he insists. ‚ÄúEveryone told us it would be a mess with both of us on the team. But it's a good thing there were two drivers like us, talented and motivated, because in-house competition allows us to give it our all. We never gave up, and if we managed to turn around what was a very complicated season last year, it's also partly thanks to the work we did together. We can be happy about that.‚Äù\n\nFrom now on, Pierre Gasly will cross paths with his compatriot on the track, but in the colors of Haas, which doesn't necessarily change his state of mind.\n\n‚ÄúThe rivalry has always been there,‚Äù he admits. ‚ÄúI've got 19 rivals on the grid, whether it's Esteban, Charles \\[Leclerc\\], Lewis \\[Hamilton\\]...
