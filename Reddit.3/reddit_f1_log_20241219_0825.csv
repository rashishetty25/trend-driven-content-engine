A first part clearly as the second force with the aim of catching up with Red Bull, a more complicated middle part, as the third and even fourth force on the track after the introduction of the problematic floor in Spain, to then have a final part of the season (from Monza onwards) of a high level , managing to also play the role of first force in some appointments. ‚ÄúI think the approach this year has been very good. Even when we encountered difficulties in July, the team‚Äôs reaction was very good . We never blamed anyone or a department but we worked together to find solutions between the different groups and it certainly went well.‚Äù ‚Äì Vasseur told the press present at the Christmas lunch in Maranello, including AutoRacer ‚Äì ‚ÄúOf course, it would have been better not to have had problems, but I think the reaction was good and that is what we expect for the future if we want to fight for the championship.‚Äù \n\n\nAfter a period of great understanding, where Charles Leclerc was often sacrificed to collect useful data later in the factory in those analyses of unforeseen problems introduced with the package brought to Spain, the SF-24 is back competitive. ""I was very proud of the team\'s reaction this year, because a positive point of our season for me is when we struggled between the end of June and the beginning of July and we were able to react quickly, then showing good pace both in the race in Budapest and Spa."" Vasseur said. Let us remember that in Hungary what the French TP called \'evolved bottom\' had debuted, with the first artificial corrections made thanks to CFD analysis and without spending hours in the tunnel , to correct part of the problems encountered with the Montmel√≤ package. ""This type of reaction will be fundamental for next year. It is true that now when you develop the car, sometimes you also take some risks by introducing updates, and it is something that has affected everyone, but it is the way you react in this situation that becomes fundamental, also for next year,‚Äù concluded Vasseur.\n\n\nFerrari Surprise: Vasseur Announces Less Than 1% of SF-24 Components Ported to 2025 Car\n\n\nThe Italian team has high expectations for the 2025 car because, as already underlined several times, it has invested a lot of technical resources , setting up a completely new project that sees changes in all the macro areas of the single-seater: from the chassis, therefore to the position of the driver and the engine, to the mechanics as well as the aerodynamic surfaces . ‚ÄúWe are in the fourth year of application of this regulation and we know our previous project very well. For this reason the 2025 car will be completely new , ‚Äù announced Fred Vasseur during the Christmas lunch in Maranello .\n\n\nA calculated risk according to the team principal of the Italian team, even if with the current regulation ‚Äúsometimes you have the feeling of not running any risks but then on the track you realize that there really were‚Äù. There will be important changes to the front , with the suspension that will become a pull-rod design, following the philosophy already used by McLaren and Red Bull. Linked to the important mechanical steps forward, the aerodynamic surfaces of the floor have also undergone a strong restyling since, as understood by AutoRacer , it will be quite different compared to the first spec 25 iteration seen on the track starting from Las Vegas s . Surprisingly, compared to the car that won 5 of the 24 races during the season just ended, 99% of the parts will change, given that Vasseur stated that the 2025 Ferrari will share ‚Äúless than 1 percent of the current car‚Äù, for what is in effect a truly different project designed to try to win at least one of the two world championships available.', 'Keep checking Leclerc‚Äôs social media pages, if he‚Äôs been posting a crap ton before the chassis reveal and pre-season testing then it‚Äôs a good car', ""The rules from 2024 to 2025 are as stable as they get in F1, and literally everything will change for 2026, so redesigning the entire car for what will be the final year will either end up being an amazing hail mary to get Lewis or Charles a(nother) championship, or it'll fail spectacularly. There's almost no in-between."", 'Oh god no.']",1054,209,0.98,1054,196,196,170,22,0.0,170

You could see the same negative dynamics play out at Alpine or at McLaren during the power struggle between Dennis, Whitmarsh and Ojjeh."", '>The case of Prost, a driver that has multiple championships, being fired because he called the car tractor or whatever will forever form my opinion of the team.\xa0\n\n\nTo add to that, his quote about the car handling like a truck was massively taken out of context after a post-race interview and Ferrari never sought any clarification. He\'s explained why in interviews and more recently in his documentary that aired earlier this month.\xa0\n\n\nAll he meant was how his car, in one particular race (Japan 1991), was almost impossible to drive because he had damage. At turn 1 he made contact with another car and his steering buckled as a result, making the car feel heavy and very hard to turn, hence the truck comparison. Now the whole year the Ferrari already had an issue where the steering would lock in long turns and the car almost couldn\'t turn, so the steering damage in Japan must\'ve amplified the issue and felt like hell. Prost called that race one of the best he\'s ever had despite finishing P4 and 25 seconds off the podium. For the record Brundle finished P5 and got lapped, the other Ferrari\'s engine blew up on the opening lap. At the time he was also in the middle of contract negotiations for the upcoming season and Ferrari felt his comments were even more disrespectful given the situation.\xa0\n\n\nYou\'re right that Ferrari has always had an issue with accepting criticism, especially from their own drivers. Another anecdote mentioned in the Prost documentary, in 1990 (which he called of his favorite seasons in F1 in terms of team atmosphere) he brought up to Ferrari how the engine was not good enough to compete with McLaren\'s engine and the team wouldn\'t accept such criticism. He said ""at Ferrari, the engine is sacred. You don\'t touch the engine, you don\'t talk about the engine. Everything has to be about the rest of the car. Except the chassis was very good that year.""

I figure it is the kind of info which is probably casually dropped in the middle of a YouTube video, but I wouldn't know how to search for it by itself.

For context, the reason I want to know is that the Ambulance Trust I work for loves to describe our approach to resuscitation as a ""Pit Stop"" approach, where everyone has a single role and they all come together to work as a team, but I would quite like to be able to point out the next time just how often Pit Crews get to practice working as a team, compared to the one afternoon every 18 months that my trust thinks is sufficient dedicated training time.","['At the factory the teams tend to short sessions with around a dozen stops twice a day. |  \nAt the track they will do a 30 min session every day each 30 min session would be around 50 stops.\n\nRed Bull article about this: [https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops)', 'Idk but Talking Bulls podcast had an episode with members of their pit crew, can probably find out there', ""Some of this information is second or third hand from some personal sources, and some of it is a few seasons old, so bear that in mind. The article u/Mysterious_Research2 also has some interesting tidbits about Red Bull's approach.\n\nThe actual training structure and volume varies a lot between teams, I think the differences in approach between a top team like Red Bull and a much smaller team like Haas would surprise a lot of people.\n\nYou can break the training/practice down into three separate blocks:\n\n1. Off-season (December - Feb/March). The crew are working almost exclusively from the factory, and the top teams will be training their pit crews for maybe 1 hour per day. Not all of that is pitstop practice, so some days may see dozens of pit stops while others might involve some strength training at the gym. For the smaller teams it will be more workload dependent, and also dependent on their facilities (not all teams have a Red Bull-style dedicated pit stop practice room). There may be weeks where the crew needs to spend time on other things and only have time to practice for 30 minutes on 1 or 2 days in a week.\n\n\n2. In-season at the Track (Wednesday-Sunday). Similar between the teams. Each team will spend 15-30 mins per day practicing pit stops. Due to travel and the time it takes to set up the paddock, there is usually no practice on a Monday or Tuesday of the race week.\n\n\n3. In-season Off Weeks. Depending on travel schedules, fatigue and rest days, the crew might not spend much time practicing back at the factory between races (the number of days in the factory will be team-dependent). At the top teams the training might be similar to off-season when the crew are back in the factory, since they have more support that lets them take time away from their normal duties. On the other hand, some top teams will offer their crew more rest days between events as a perk, so the practice volume might be very small. For the smaller teams, who don't have as many staff and so rely more on the trackside staff to fill in when they're back, it will be heavily dependent on their workload. A busy week might mean they don't train at all."", 'Typical race weekend practice sessions: \n\nThursday PSP \n10-15 stops \nMainly scenario based, inc nose changes, puncture, penalties and single crew \n\nFriday PSP\n8-10 stops \nStandard stops \n\nSaturday PSP \nUsually doesn‚Äôt happen, due to time constraints. \n\nSunday PSP \n4-8 stops \nLimit stop count ready for GP \n\nFP1/2/3 \n1-3 stops each session \nMixture of static pit stops and live stops.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: \nForgot factory sessions:\n\nDuring the winter build Jan-Feb practice twice a day 8-10 stops per practice.\n\nDuring the season, some teams come into the factory between races and have one half day doing some practice, but majority wait until they‚Äôre at the circuit due to freight constraints.', ""During peak race season I'd venture to say they're practicing daily - for hours a day."", 'Speed with Guy Martin did an F1 special that let him get a shot at being an F1 mechanic, including the pit stops.

As much as Checo and Danny Ric, respect each other, they both knew one of them would only survive going into 2025. What they didn‚Äôt know that neither of them would make it and effectively be thrown to the dogs by the same team they spent years fighting for and being replaced by someone who hasn‚Äôt completed a full season nor scored any position higher than 8th.

1hhi8lf,Colapinto is Rebull's best choice (since they hate Yuki),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhi8lf/colapinto_is_rebulls_best_choice_since_they_hate/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"Redbull have always appreciated drivers who are fast off the block, and they are willing to stomach a crash here and there as long as your fast.

2025 is the last of the regulations, Honeslty who cares what happens in the constructors as long as max gets his 5th. if they come third again itll give them the edge going into 2026 with new regulations with more wind tunnel time.

* Yuki is the obvious choice but is a honda boy and redbull only keep him arround so honda dont chuck a wobbly (which sucks just move him up), He also doenst play team orders well.
* Lawson wasnt excitingly fast or anything and didnt score many points. he also doesnt have the backing of any huge sponsors. also a weird vibe so not everyone is his biggest fan.

Redbull's first choice should be colapinto, he outscored Lawson in an argubaly shitier car in fewer races, was fast albiet a little crash prone, Has major sponsors to bring cause South America hailing sports people like gods, (Might even bring some favour in with old checo fans for this reason). His also funny and extremely marketable.

If his bad, rotate him out for lawson after the midseason break in true redbull bad faith fashion, once laswson has some more points under his belt.

Hell Williams took albon on loan from redbull, maybe they can repay the favour.","['James Vowles is asking 20 millions to let him walk. \n\nRed Bull is coming off paying a driver off to leave their team, they‚Äôre not going to spend another 20 just like that.', 'Horner already stated its between Yuki and Lawson', 'Colapinto is good.
