People have come and gone, and Andrea has done an incredible job. **So to be part of this whole story, to be part of it not long after Zak joined McLaren and started changing things and making McLaren into a slightly more happy place than it was prior, I've been along the journey with Zak, and we've gone through a lot of things together, highs and lows and emotional times.** \n\nSo it definitely has been a longer rise to get to where we are, which has been fun and I've really loved it and I've enjoyed it. \n\n**And I think the thing I'll be proudest and most happy about is the fact I'm still here.** The fact I'm still in papaya because I believed in the team for many years. I had opportunities to not be in papaya and to maybe go on and win races at an earlier stage in my career and those kind of things. I had those opportunities, but I believed **and I wanted to simply do it with McLaren. I wanted to do it with the guys who gave me my opportunity in Formula 1.** \n\nAnd as much as we didn't think it was going to be possible this year, we're hoping for next year. And next year was our kind of in-line target, on-paper target. The fact we're doing it this year is an even bigger achievement. \n\nJob not done, and Andrea will be happy that I say it, **but I'm proud to be on this journey, to have been on it with McLaren for so many years, and I'll be very happy when hopefully it's all finished off.**\n\n(emphasis mine) [post-qualifying-press-conference-transcript](https://www.fia.com/news/f1-2024-abu-dhabi-grand-prix-post-qualifying-press-conference-transcript)"", 'I remember in 2018 there were rumours Lando was going to Toro Rosso to replace the under performing Brendon Hartley.

Valtteri Bottas will race his last F1 race on Sunday, at least for now.\n\nHeikki Kulta\n\n7.12. 14:33\n\nOn 15 November 2011, Valtteri Bottas drove an F1 car on a race track for the first time. The stage was the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi. On Sunday, the 35-year-old Finnish driver will drive his last F1 race on the same track.\n\nThirteen years ago, then GP3 champion Bottas had only gained F1 experience in advance from two straight tests at the Kemble circuit in England. Sunday marks the 246th race of his F1 career.\n\nBut Bottas, who has been the last Finnish driver on the grid for the last three seasons, refuses to think that after the final race he will say goodbye to the F1 pace he loves.\n\n**- I have a feeling that I\'m not finished with this sport. I still have a lot to give, so I\'m going to see this through to the end of this card,"" Bottas asserted in a telephone interview on Saturday morning ahead of the day\'s challenges.**\n\nAfter five years with Mercedes as Lewis Hamilton\'s teammate, Bottas moved to the Sauber team, which operated under the Alfa Romeo banner, in 2022 for virtually nothing more than top positions.\n\nFrederic Vasseur, who had led the Finn to success in the minor leagues, was team principal in 2022, but after he moved to Ferrari for 2023, Sauber has since gone without a team boss.\n\nSo Bottas\' first three-year F1 contract did not turn out to be the best of his career?\n\n**- Certainly not. If I could go back three years, I would have switched to somewhere else. Unfortunately, that\'s the way it is. It was a big mistake, but it\'s hard to predict these things in advance,"" Bottas sighed.**\n\n*Valtteri Bottas was spraying bubbly in his mouth after winning the Russian GP in spring 2017, when he was a Mercedes man.*\n\n**- That first year with Vasseur was a good one. The team spirit was good and the results were pretty good. The last two seasons since then have been a bit downhill all the way. Of course, that also affects my image as a driver. If you can\'t show results, you kind of forget your name.**\n\nUnder Vasseur in 2022, Bottas finished in the top 10 in the drivers\' championship with 49 points - his best result was fifth place at Imola. The team finished sixth in the Manufacturers\' World Championship. In 2023, the standings started to collapse, and in this record-breaking season Bottas is still at zero on the eve of the final race.\n\n**- This season has been undeniably awful. In 2022, when Vasseur and I set the targets and how to achieve them, we had a clear plan. But when he left, all the goals and plans were really scrapped. Since then it has been much more challenging.**\n\nIn Qatar, Bottas scored his best finish of the season in 11th place, which lifted him out of the drivers\' championship, past Logan Sargeant.\n\nBottas says it was that race that was his biggest disappointment of the season.\n\n**- The team sacrificed me quite rudely there, and offered Guanyu Zhou the better tactics that got us the points. It was just a case of seeing which car was ahead, got the priority, and that\'s why they stopped me earlier to help my teammate. There went my chances of finishing in the top ten. I\'ve learnt a lot of things this season and my skin has tanned from it.**\n\nValtteri Bottas feels that the team sacrificed him for another driver.', 'He god fucked when Fred left. He was Vasseur driver and while Fred rated him high Seidl was exact opposite. Will be interesting to see how it goes to Hulk since he was Seidl signing and not a Binotto one. Felt like Binotto wanted both Bottas and Bortoleto to the team but there just was one spot left.', 'These are strong words from someone often as balanced as Bottas is', 'Interesting that he says next years plans will be finalised next week. Merc reserve incoming.\n\nThat said, I don‚Äôt think Bottas and his team played this silly season well. He was publicly talking throughout the early part of it about how he only wanted long contracts, that‚Äôs just not a game you can play when your car‚Äôs too shit to put results on the board. Alpine IMO was his best shot, since they‚Äôre not overly attached to the rookie they chose, but no way was Flavio going to give him more than a year at a time.\n\n*So Bottas‚Äô first three-year F1 contract didn‚Äôt turn out to be the best of his career?\n\n‚Äì Absolutely not. If I could go back three years, I would have changed somewhere else. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs how it is.

This is such a lazy narrative. 

Taking the conspiracies aside, what most people are suggesting isn‚Äôt that Mercedes have purposely slowed Lewis down, but they have favoured George, which has, by default, given him an advantage.

It is clear that all teams, on many weekends, have two unequal cars due to upgrades being given to only one of their drivers. It is therefore absolutely feasible that George got every upgrade first. And it would be understandable that they chose George given Lewis is leaving. That‚Äôs not making Lewis directly slower, but it is likely making George faster. 

On several occasions this season, it has been acknowledged Lewis is running the experimental setup, including Toto saying that today. That‚Äôs not necessarily making Lewis slower, but it is probably making him slower than George. 

Some people seek every reason to put Lewis down (as many do to max and every other driver). Others will be wilfully blind to their favourite drivers flaws.

It could be that Lewis has just drifted off motivation wise. It could be that he has genuinely dropped in form, be it permanently or temporarily.

But the drop off from a clear outperformance of George last year is quite substantial. And I cannot believe that it‚Äôs 100% of Lewis. 

There is a difference between sabotage and favouritism. 

There is also absolutely the motivation to show your investors that your new number 1 is better than the driver who decided to leave. That‚Äôs the CEO 101, not a conspiracy. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, I think Mercedes has been poorly led for a few years now, and I think they really let Lewis down this year. ","[""It's the opposite with Mercedes. They had a full upgrade they gave to both drivers in Austin, but it didn't work as they thought.

I'm just curious to see if I'm the only person who thinks F1 penalties have gotten ridiculous. I get that sometimes they are warranted but when there is a racing incident in the 1st corner on the opening lap of the race and absolutely nothing flagrant, there's no need for a penalty. Contact happens, it is racing after all. I guess being a Nascar fan I expect drivers to always race hard and not have to ""be careful"" around others competing for a manufacturer championship...that kind of careful driving, in my opinion, should only apply when one is being lapped.
