I don't believe any other system on a modern F1 car is as high up the chain on both of those categories simultaneously. Tires can be changed under red flags because red flags are associated with dangerous track condition that can threaten the structural and tractive status of tires.

Prior to that stopping made sense as Norris also stopped and George would have still come out on fresh tyres ahead of all the cars behind.\xa0 Shovlin says normally they try not to assume that it\'ll get red flagged because if you stay out and don\'t get a red flag, you\'re in trouble. Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you get it wrong and this time the cars that gambled got what they wanted.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What were the issues with the brakes that both drivers complained about?\xa0\n\n\nA: George said the brake disc felt like they had ""warped"" but they didn\'t. There can be higher friction in some areas that can create vibrations that the drivers can feel through the pedals. They are still investigating but think it could be due to the very cold temperatures, as the brakes were fine in the dry and other drivers also complained about brake vibrations during the race. George thinks it was costing 2 or 3 tenths a lap.\n\n\n- Q: Lewis was particularly struggling with the car. In general how challenging is it to make sure the setup suits both drivers\' demands?\xa0\n\n\nA: Normally you\'re able to do it, they let the drivers deviate with the setup, evolve their own setup and when one of them appears to be going well you often take some elements or even the whole lot and put it on the other car.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0Lewis was mainly struggling with rear grip, in the sprint for example he had snaps of oversteer, which overheats the tyres and prolongs the issue. The difference between the sprint (hot and dry) and the race (cold and wet) made it difficult to get the car where he wanted.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What about adjusting the tyres pressure on the grid and the subsequent penalty?\n\n\nA: When they got the message for the restart, there was only 10 minutes to go, and the tyres must be on the car with 5 to go (serious penalty if you break that rule says Shovlin). The pitlane layout in Brazil is unsual and makes more difficult for teams to get the car. The tyres they selected hadn\'t been ""bled down"" to race pressures and the penalty was because there wasn\'t time for the FIA checks.\n\n\n$5,000 fine per car, no rules around tyre pressures were broken and no sporting advantage was gained, mitigating factor of not having enough time to bring the tyres and get the checks done.\n\n\n- Q: Did the COTA upgrades perform as expected?\n\n\nA: In terms of loads measured, they\'re seeing what they expect and where they expect in terms of ride height range. In the wet the car worked well in quali (front row) and in the race, particularly the first stint with George. However in the dry they have issues in slow speed, particularly when one corner follows another and a lot of turning is required.\xa0\n\n\nThe aim of those upgrades wasn\'t to fix that but to lift the base performance of the car, which is what they\'re doing. They know they still have some fundamentals to tackle in order to fix them on the W16, which they\'re very busy with at the moment.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What learnings for the W16 and how will the team prepare for the rest to the season?\xa0\n\n\nA: The main weakness has been the same, the interconnected slow corners like sector 2 in Brazil. They\'ll keep working on that in the next races. The final three races will be useful to assess performance, determine who is the benchmark between Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren and establish the gap that needs to be closed down over the winter.\xa0', 'So Shov seemed to just blame Lewis for a bad setup when Hamilton said it was the worst car he\'s ever driven in these regs. \n\nAt this point he must just be told what to say by a press communications director before doing these things, they say a bunch of words that just feel like a bunch of nothing. \n\nIt\'s unfortunate, as these used to be very informative videos. \n\nGuess it got old saying, ""We still don\'t understand how our car works, our upgrade correlations don\'t ever match up.""', "">W16\n\nFeels like yesterday the W13 was porpoising down the Bahrain straight, and now we're close to meeting the W16.

If the revs dropped when lifting off, it might mean the power delivery isn't as high when they get back on the throttle. This makes sense for high speed corners, obviously not relevant for low speed corners.\n\nThat's just a guess. There were no blown diffusers back then. It could also be traction control related (traction control wasn't banned until a couple of years later).\n\nThat BMW engine was a beast in the early 00s. It was rumoured they were the first to hit 1000hp during the v10 era. I think peak HP was around 2002 or 2003.

Take the timings from the last active racing lap and remove the average pit time from anyone that decides to change tyres under a red flag. This is then your new grid for a restart.

  
I think it'd be the fairest solution as it also takes into account drivers who had built up large gaps to the car behind. There'd also be some strategy to it as you wouldn't just automatically change tyres.



The only downside i can think is teams trying to play mind games by changing tyres at the last possible second before a restart, but that could be avoided by mandating tyre changes within a certain time frame when the race has stopped.","['I think the red flag situation is fine as it is.

You don't want cars driving through debris after a red flag worthy incident and then send them out on dodgy tyres."", 'Why only for Red Flag ? Pitting under SC/VSC should also give a time penalty to equalize pitstop times then. But then you basically punish a driver who managed his tyres well and could go on longer waiting for SC opportunity.', 'Teams are allowed to change tyres under a red flag because teams are allowed to work on cars in general under red. It\'s allowed because teams may need to repair damage like changing wings or like after Bottas went bowling in Hungary 2021 Red Bull mechanics did their best to patch up Verstappen\'s floor and sidepod. Are you going to account for that too or only tyres? It takes a lot longer to swap a front wing out in a pit stop. And how do you account for VSC, SC, differing pitlane lengths and who knows what other factors I\'m not even thinking of right now. Should drivers be forced to stop longer when they pit under SC or VSC? Because that\'s an ""unfair"" advantage as well.\n\nOr you just don\'t make up a lot of complicated new rules that are going to introduce new scenarios that are unfair anyway and just accept that sometimes things aren\'t perfectly fair and it\'s just part of racing.', 'I like the randomness the red flag sometimes generates. So I am fine with it. If we do what you suggest, we would have never had a Alpine 2/3, which was some of the biggest good surprises of the weekend. When you start compensating for time lost during Red (and why stop there, why no VSC/SC?) you take away an element of randomness and teams outside the top 4 will never be in top 5 again.', '> In order to remove the unfairness from the fact that you get a completely free tyre change under a red, have it so that they essentially simulate a pit stop if they choose to change tyres.  \n  \nSo your intent is to penalize drivers who drove through debris and needed a tire change due to damage from an incident they were not involved in?  \n  \nAnd would you apply similar logic towards (V)SC situation, as it\'s also a ""reduced"" pitstop?', 'I honestly don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any unfairness to getting a free tyre change during a red flag. It‚Äôs all part of the strategy. Sometimes the red flag helps and sometimes it hurts. I think this rule is fine as it is.', 'Ah Verstappen gained from a Red Flag, we must discuss it and change it. \n\nWhen anyone else gains from a Red Flag, it is all part of the game. \n\n\nIt is getting a bit predictable.']",0,127,0.09,0,741,741,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
