For some reason it just never clicked with RIC in the car, was very rarely on it (luckily for him in Monza xd). Technically a good move with how RIC was performing and McL was on the up, but just never worked unfortunately.\n\nIn hindsight, RIC was better of staying put in Renault and Macca could have given Albon a shot, or retried with Stoffel or Hulk maybe from the free agents. Otherwise they could have tried to nick Russell or Piastri, either on loan from Merc/Alpine or trying to get them to join altogether."", ""he should have never left. back when he did leave, he still was performing well and beating Max on occasion and probably thought he should be the number one guy but it seems pretty clear now that Max was on his way up and Danny was on the way down.   \n\nDTS definitely pushed that angle. If you didn't watch F1 and just the first season of DTS, you could very easily get the idea that Danny was better than Max."", ""I am just going to say that he made the proper career moves that he could make, at the time. \n\nPart of why I say this because it is evident that Red Bull was gearing up towards favouring Verstappen, which is all perfectly understandable but in my opinion, had Ricciardo stayed, there is a chance that his stock would have plumetted and the camaraderie that was carefully built with Verstappen and Red Bull would have crumbled further. Some will say that he left because he is too afraid to take the fight to Verstappen, and I won't fault the idea because it appears that way, but I think he knows that this is a decision that he must take, to preserve the prime of his career whilst Verstappen is blossoming into his\n\nBut you asked for my personal answer. And maybe I will throw in a curveball. Maybe the answer does not lie with Renault or McLaren either. Maybe it should have been with another team. Reductive answer, I know. But I just don't know how things would have played out if there are only small tweaks to his Renault and McLaren moves.\n\nIf he had joined McLaren a lot earlier than 2021, there is a possibility that he would be able to adapt a lot faster but he was already struggling with the McLaren before the ground effect regulations came in. There is also the chance that this would have accelerated his inability to manage the car a lot quicker. Joining Renault was a bold move but a welcome one, considering there was a promise that the team will be built relatively around him but I get why he left as well. Correct me if I am mistaken, but I have heard of rumours of instability within the team structure, and disputes within his own camp. If the dynamics are already shaky, why stay put? I am currently watching some 2019 races and the ones I did happen to watch for now, saw him going through some really tough luck. 2020 did appear promising with how he ended that year, but with that offer to McLaren, which at the time, would be the better prospect, I cannot say I blame him.\n\nAs for who McLaren should have signed in 2021, if not for Ricciardo? Tough call. Maybe Sainz should have been retained? A race win in 2021 would not have been in the cards but there was a solid possibility McLaren could have gotten to the front a lot faster. Not saying I would change anything now but I am trying to see what can be deduced from my predictions. Or they could have brought in another rookie from the time, but I simply do not see it being Albon. In another lifetime, I would have taken stabs in the dark and maybe gunned for a bolder choice like Russell. A Norris-Russell dynamic would have been fiery, but alas, that is just a guess\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer on my end. Ricciardo did what he had to do. And I'll be happy to expand on my thought process / rescind to give it more thought before I comment on a Ricciardo post in the future 😅. Thought I'll add to the discussion a little"", 'In an ideal hindsight world he should probably have stayed at Red Bull if he purely wanted to pad his stats more, but he would soon have found his stock diminished there by a rapidly rising Max anyway. \n\nIn reality, with him not having the benefit of hindsight, both his moves made total sense at the time. He could see the writing on the wall at Red Bull, and Renault, a manufacturer team with a history of F1 success were offering him a huge multi-year contract to be their lead driver in their quest to get back up the grid. Then, with having likely seen plenty within Renault for that one year to realise how dysfunctional things actually were there, moving to McLaren as Sainz’s replacement - an historical giant of a team who were once again on the up, with a lot more internal stability than Renault and offering him another huge multi-year contract to be their lead driver - made sense as well. He wasn’t to know when he signed the contract prior to the 2020 season that he was running headlong into a rapidly-rising Norris, nor that his own ability to adapt had some severe limitations.\n\nAs for McLaren, if they had not signed Ricciardo. they could have opted for Vettel, as he was on the market once Sainz took his seat at Ferrari.']",0,60,0.42,0,432,432,0,0,0.019999999999999962,0
