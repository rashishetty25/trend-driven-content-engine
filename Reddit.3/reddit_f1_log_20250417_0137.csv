1k0ds0q,How F-ducts worked - and an aero detail not discussed previously,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k0ds0q/how_fducts_worked_and_an_aero_detail_not/,2025-04-16, Technical,"As has been well covered in the past - the F-duct system was introduced in 2010 by McLaren (and later adopted in varying forms by other teams). It was a clever way of achieving drag reduction without movable aerodynamic devices - skirting the regulations by using driver input to trigger a ""fluidic"" switch hidden away inside the engine cover.

I thought I'd write up a post explaining how this system worked aerodynamically, having seen it's development, testing, and eventual deployment firsthand.

**Fluidics: a quick background**

Fluidics is a whole discipline of its own, similar to the fields of mechanics and electronics. Fluidic systems use the properties of fluids (i.e. liquids and gases) to create logical systems free from electronic or mechanical influence. Within the fluidic world we have devices like logic gates, amplifiers, oscillators, etc - the same things you'd find in the mechanical and electronic counterpart worlds. You can therefore build different systems and solve for many different use cases using these fluidic devices. Great little intro paper [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19730002533/downloads/19730002533.pdf) from NASA talks about many different use cases that fluidics have seen in the world of aerospace.

Now that we know that fluidics are essentially the aero counterpart to mechanical and/or electrical systems, it's easy to then connect the dots and see what sort of clever loopholes a fluidic system could open up in a set of rules and regulations that were written with mechanical and/or electrical devices in mind. It is also worth noting that it was exactly this sort of ""what is the X analogue of Y"" logic that led to the inerter (""J-damper""), another famous F1 innovation which is the mechanical equivalent of an electronic capacitor. No surprise to note that it was also McLaren that brought this innovation to F1 first, shortly after it's invention.

**Coming back to F-Ducts**

If moveable aero regulations banned *mechanical* switches to change the aero behaviour of the car, they didn't (initially) ban *aerodynamic* switches. And the lowest hanging fruit seem to be in shedding drag in straight line conditions - something where an on/off switch would be a perfect use case for fluidics.

At its core, the F-duct worked by stalling the rear wing - similar in outcome to the DRS. However, the F-Duct did this purely aerodynamically (no rotating flaps) by injecting ducted flow perpendicular to the normal airflow on the rear wing flap (and later at the mainplane, to have a larger stall effect) to trigger separation of the boundary layer, creating a stall and dump downforce and therefore the induced drag that comes with it.

**Basic function**

The system used internal ducting to channel air from an inlet (usually at the nose or via a slot at the top of the airbox) to the rear wing. When the system was activated - typically by the driver blocking or unblocking a duct with their hand or leg - the airflow would be directed to a slot in the rear wing's surface, triggering the stall.

Most F-duct systems had two possible outlet paths:

1. A default, low-energy path that always exited the ducted flow harmlessly out of what RBR called the ""donkey d\*ck"" - a long horizontal outlet at the back of the engine cover.
2. A stall path that redirected flow up through the rear wing and out the slot perpendicular to the rear wing surface when the duct was activated

https://preview.redd.it/5dmiy3gq45ve1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=398d21a33d2676999f8aab72551978aae3446610

**The need for a reliable switch**

Early testing showed that the system did not initially have a fully binary switching behaviour: even when a majority of the flow was going into the default outlet, some flow would end up in the stall outlet, negatively impacting rear wing performance when the wing should be operating at 'normal' load (e.g. in cornering). Similarly, switching the system on and off and back on again showed signs of aerodynamic hysteresis - a phenomenon that basically means that a sort of aerodynamic lag. If blocking the driver control duct caused a rear wing stall, simply unblocking the duct wouldn't be enough to cause the rear wing to recover. Not good.

**The vortex trap**

The solution to this, aside from a lot of fine-tuning, was the introduction of a small but crucial aerodynamic feature that was added to the switch, and was intentionally hidden via a vanity panel - though I'm sure others figured this out quickly too since this detail is present in a lot of fluidic research literature. This feature was the semi-circular vortex trap at the junction of the two outlet paths. Here sat a trapped vortex that would help stabilise the flow going to the default outlet when the stall switch was deactivated. It would reverse it's rotation when the stall switch was activated, thereby helping stabilise flow going to the stall path.

What this did was quite elegant:

* When the system wasn’t activated, the donkey d\*ck was the low-resistance path, and the vortex acted as a sort of buffer that prevented any significant bleed to the stall slot, keeping it aerodynamically “quiet"". The counter-clockwise rotation of the vortex encouraged all flow from the inlet duct to head down the non-stall pathway.

https://preview.redd.it/b8s7e46t45ve1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5115a0bfc409d03669048b05c3e60a7f1e2dfe6

* When the control duct was activated by the driver, there was upwards flow at the switch that caused the vortex to reverse its rotation, encouraging all the flow to head to the stall duct. The vortex would now stabilise this new flow path, again insulating it from the now dormant donkey d\*ck path.

https://preview.redd.it/qnl4uvtt45ve1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcdb094f9032f9d4aeab758689526e8206887819

This meant the system behaved like a bistable switch - very stable in both modes (stall on or stall off). There was very little dynamic pressure or cross-talk in the non-active duct, which was key for predictable and stable rear wing stall/unstall transitions.

It was a small detail - but a good example of how in F1, even a small change in duct geometry can make or break the whole system.","['I love the way it got it\'s name.

1k0yqbd,Explanation of Aerodynamics in F1 Cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k0yqbd/explanation_of_aerodynamics_in_f1_cars/,2025-04-16, Discussion,"Hi - I am an aerospace engineer with almost 2 decades of experience in rocket engines, missile systems, and aircraft. I have never worked on formula 1 cars, or any car for that matter. However, I know aerodynamics and the core principles remain the same across applications.

In these first few weeks of the season, I have seen a lot of talk about the Red Bull car in particular. In a lot of these discussions (including articles from journalists...) people seem to falsely equate how hard the car is to drive with it's speed. What I hope people take away from this post is that a car that is hard to drive can still be very fast. In fact, a worse ""window"" can actually make a car faster when inside that window (speaking purely in terms of aerodynamics).

As a side note, this is not about drivers. There is no question that Max is amazing. There is also no debate that the McLaren is fast, but I do think that some people are underestimating how fast the Red Bull actually is just because it is hard to drive.

So into the explanation (trying to make it ELI5):

Let's start with airfoils - airfoils are one of the main ways to create aerodynamic structures. Airfoils are a 2D shape that look like a tear drop - if you look at an aircraft wing, it is an airfoil that is extruded to 3D. 

Camber is the degree to which the airfoil is bent. Typically, if you camber an airfoil more the lift/downforce will increase, but so will the drag. Think about holding your hand out of the window while driving - a flat hand has no camber and a cupped hand is more cambered. You can also do a lot with how ""sensitive"" an airfoil is - meaning, there are some airfoils that are ""twitchy"" when it hits a gust of air (colloquially referred to as turbulence). In something like a commercial jet, they design their airfoils to be very stable - this makes them easier to fly safely, less prone to ""turbulence"", etc. The downside is that these more stable airfoils are very slow for maneuvering by design. So in contrast, they design combat aircraft (e.g. F-15)) with much more unstable, but also much more responsive aero surfaces. Engineers put a lot of time into optimizing these aero surfaces to be both responsive and stable, but it is always a trade off on some level.

The other important concept for people to understand is stall. Ideally you want air to ""stick"" to your airfoil, so you generate maximum lift with minimal drag - however when you angle the airfoil (say turn an F1 car) you increase the amount of flow that starts to separate - which if it gets bad enough is called ""stall"" and the surface loses most of it's lift (or downforce in F1 terms). Similar to the camber, some airfoil designs can be more sensitive to stall, but typically these have the lowest drag in ideal conditions.

In an F1 car you have literally thousands of individual aerodynamics surfaces. Not all of them are airfoils, but  they all follow the same principles. Engineers need to balance drag, downforce, responsiveness, and risk of stall on each surface in a variety of speeds, turns, temperatures, winds, etc.  Not to mention how suspension, stiffness, dirty air, etc. can also impact aerodynamic performance. Unfortunately, if you increase downforce (all else being equal) you also increase drag. If you lower drag to go faster you can cause some surfaces to stall in a corner. If you are quickest in clean air, it's possible you are compromising your speed in dirty air (think the McLaren in Japan).

I think if you read this far, the issues with Red Bull's car are pretty obvious. It has a very narrow window of conditions where it has optimal aerodynamics. They clearly have gotten ""spoiled"" by having a driver like Max who can consistently keep it in the proper window for peak performance - and thus have gradually opted for a faster car rather than a car that is easy to drive. Unfortunately, even if Max drives perfectly there are things outside of his control like temperatures, track layout, wind, etc. I do think that when the Red Bull is in the window, it is probably faster than the McLaren, but that window is a lot smaller than McLaren's so you rarely if ever get to see it. 

Of course McLaren could have discovered some kind of black magic that allows them to be the fastest, most responsive, and easiest to drive all in one package. It is possible, but in my opinion based on the races so far, it is more likely that they just struck a better balance between those various factors that provides better performance across the all of the tracks. And I would wager that, that McLaren is also quite hard to drive even if it is not as bad as the Red Bull.","['r/F1technical would probably enjoy this write-up as well', 'I was thinking about a lot of this myself, but it’s nice to hear a more professional perspective on the matter. And indeed there is overlap between a hard to drive car, and a fast car. One does not exclude the other.\n\nOn your end conclusion though… I mean, we’ll see how it turns out, but I do not believe Red Bull are in this without significant (and correct, can’t be understated) upgrades, either for the actual speed of the car, or the capability of setting it up correctly. In that regard they are behind and/or too dependent on outside conditions, which is also part of the game. Can’t build a car that only works when it’s rainbows amd sunshine.\n\nGreat technical insight though, loved the read!', 'so basically people misconstrued speed and cornering', 'Can one infer from this that F1 drivers would do great flying combat aircraft?', 'I’m having a hard time following the discussion of a “stable airfoil”.  While there are angular moments resulting from lift generation this pales in comparison the resulting moments from other primary control surfaces (horizontal tail/canards, etc) in creating stable responses to disturbances. A key difference being that these are purely aerodynamic effects in airplanes but are tied more to physical structure (how the wing is connected to the body, suspension, and eventually the ground) of automobiles.  Any change in this relationship is solely due to aero elasticity.   The F-15 is also a remarkably stable aircraft it just has tons of pitch authority due to absolute units on a horizontal stab.  The wing has camber optimized for an elliptical lift profile at a wide variety of angles of attack while also being remarkably efficient at area ruling for supersonic flight.  Not bad for 1960s slide rule toting engineers!', ""Your point about stability in clean air vs. dirty air is a really good one, and of the things that is overlooked the most in my opinion. Everyone knows that dirty air is a thing, but it's often underestimated how important it is and how the magnitude of the impact varies with the car design.\n\nIt's one of the things that irked me about all the Lando vs. Oscar comparisons last year. Was Lando really so much faster in Zandvoort and Singapore, or was it just the benefit of clean air? Was Oscar really faster in Spa and Hungary? The McLaren seems particularly sensitive in this regard. I remember in one of the last races in the year (I forget which one), Lando had great pace, until he reached the backmarkers and commented on how much harder it was in dirty air.\n\nIt makes it very difficult to get an honest gauge comparative pace sometimes. It's all part of the fun, but the engineer in me desperately wants every driver to drive every car at every track in every condition, purely so I can scratch the itch of having a proper dataset."", ""[*...this bit here is what Adrian Newey sees in his mind's eye when he's on the drawing board...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlDnd3B1rhs&ab_channel=wickedender)""]",79,10,0.88,79,7,7,79,10,0.88,79

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Or do you think George would be able to fight back better than most people assume? I know Max is a generational talent and one of the best drivers in history, but George is an established part of the Mercedes structure and a very skilled driver in his own right. I could see George really bothering Max during the first months of their partnership.', ""Can't seem to find this year's application for volunteering at the Austin GP 2025.

Honda wouldn\'t sell their IP, but RBR was able to negotiate an engine freeze, which meant Honda could significantly reduce development, and almost pull out, while still supplying engines. RBR already created RBPT, but instead of building the Honda engines with their IP, they essentially kept buying the engines, and worked with Honda like before, just that most of the development on it stopped. So essentially RBPT is more or less a shell, gearing up for the point when they do have to create their own engine, and all the secrets are still with Honda, who supply RBPT with their engine, who then license it in their name.\n\n\\-That same Honda already commited to re-enter in 2026 for the new PU regs, this time partnering with Aston Martin. Honda still have their own engine as mentioned before, so the new one will probably be based off of that, which is why they limit their access to the engine that much with RBPT, and didn\'t want to sell their IP\n\n\\-Aston Martin invested heavily into building their own engine, but I assume have since backpedalled to just support and work with Honda in their development, in a kind of ""we\'re not the same but we\'re working a lot closer than a customer"" deal that RB previously had with Renault before Renault re-entered, and then with Honda later on\n\n\\-Renault will stop their engine program alltogether, and Alpine will become Mercedes customer number 200 or something, probably hindering their progress even more, since independece was the only thing they had going for them\n\n\\-Audi is building their own engine from scratch, and use it on their own team that used to be Sauber / Kick\n\n\\-GM is working on their own engine as well, but isn\'t going to be ready in time. Instead they will enter as an 11th team, but use Ferrari engines for the first 2 year and become fully operational in 2028 (100 race plan?!)\n\n\\-the ICE will remain the same, but fuel will be measured differently and reduced, so just a toned down version of the current V6, the MGU-H will be gone entirely, and to compensate the battery and MGU-K will be increased significantly, more or less similar overall power, just less conventional and more electric\n\n\\-chassis will be smaller and lighter, less ground effect and a tiny bit more complex aero again (so worse racing again? 2022 worked pretty well in terms of following each other compared to 2021)', 'It’s still early and purely speculative. But who could be Hamilton’s potential replacement starting in 2027?\n\nIn my opinion, there are two options: Oliver Bearman. If he keeps performing at HAAS the way he is now and continues to grow, I can see it happening. The downside is that he would still be “only” 22 years old by then.\n\nPiastri: if McLaren hypothetically chooses Norris over time as their number 1 driver, then I could see Piastri going to Ferrari for that reason. And to be honest, I’m also just a fan of Piastri and would love to see him drive for Ferrari.', ""If Max moves to another team with a top driver who's been there for years (e.g. Max to Ferrari after Lewis leaves, with Charles as his teammate) who do you think comes out on top in their first year?\n\n\nIf it were someone else going to Red Bull, I'd think Max would easily come on top, but going to a team where the car isn't necessarily moulded around his driving style /more drivable for the other driver, it would be more of a question."", 'Any good places to watch the race in Manchester this weekend?', ""What do you think the 2026 F1 calendar will look like?\n\nSome things to consider:\n\n* Ramadan next year will be from mid-February to mid-March; a reason why Bahrain and Jeddah are relatively late this year is because Ramadan largely coincided with the whole of March.\n* Imola likely won't be on the calendar.\n* We'll have two Spanish races, with the Spanish Grand Prix moving to Madrid and Barcelona still contracted for a race next year as well.\n* Las Vegas doesn't have a contract for next year yet, though I think it's likely they'll be extended.\n\nMy prediction:\n\n* Australia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia to start the season. \n* Japan and China as the next leg.\n* Miami, then Montreal as the next two races. With Imola out, it's possible we finally get a brief North American two-parter instead of the Canadian GP interrupting the European leg.\n* Monaco to open the European section of the calendar, then some permutation of Madrid/Barcelona/Spielberg/Silverstone/Hungary/Spa up to the summer break.\n* Zandvoort sings its swan song before the calendar goes to Monza, to wrap up the European leg.\n* The last eight or so races are roughly in the same order as 2024 and 2025 - that is, Baku, Singapore, Austin, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Las Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi.\n\nThis is all assuming no circuits get dropped besides Imola, and no circuits get added besides Madrid."", 'Are individual F1 teams allowed to release/license their own games?

I’m concerned for him, he’s been terrible in every race this year.

In Japan, he qualified P14 against Hadjar’s P7, and in the race finished 50 seconds behind Hadjar, P8 vs P17. This weekend, he qualified 0.5 seconds behind Hadjar and caused two crashes. 

Do you guys see Lawson lasting the season?

Even Yuki did better in just 2 weekends in that RB"", ""This discourse is kind of sad for Lawson because Hadjar has seen some decent promise but it's only just the beginning. He did well last year all things considered so I expect him to just hold out for a while unless Red Bull decides to pull a swift one on him again."", 'I think so but I’m not sure if he will stay next year.
