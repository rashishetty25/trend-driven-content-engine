George Russell controlled the Canadian GP from the front, and Andrea Kimi Antonelli finished third. Was the Silver Arrows\' good form a flash in the pan or a turning point?**\n\n> This was no fluke victory. George Russell put the Mercedes on pole position with a lead of 0.160 seconds over Max Verstappen. He had the best start and controlled the race from the front. Whenever Verstappen approached the DRS zone, the 27-year-old Englishman increased the pace and effortlessly pulled away from the world champion. Team principal Toto Wolff called it an ""honest victory.""\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli rounded out Mercedes\' success in third place. It was the first podium finish for an Italian since Jarno Trulli at the 2009 Japanese GP. Antonelli also became the third-youngest driver to climb onto the podium at a Grand Prix. His drive to third place wasn\'t quite as relaxed as Russell\'s fourth GP victory: ""For the last few laps, I was praying it would be over soon. Piastri was putting a lot of pressure on me from behind.""\n\n> Mercedes reclaimed second place in the Constructors\' World Championship from Ferrari with 40 points. The W16 hadn\'t undergone any significant changes. The front brake vents were given larger openings. The underbody was modified at the edge to provide a few points more downforce. And the new rear axle, which had been retired immediately after its debut in Imola, returned. It wasn\'t the reason why the rear tires overheated in recent races. In retrospect, it actually helped to better control the problem.\n\n> **Track, asphalt and weather helped Mercedes.**\nWere the pole position, the win, and third place a flash in the pan or a turning point? The answer is: neither. Mercedes is unlikely to be as competitive at all tracks from now on as it was in Montreal. Russell admitted: ""This type of track, the smooth asphalt, and cooler temperatures help us. That\'s the picture we\'ve seen for years. We need to figure out why we can\'t replicate it everywhere.""\n\n> Toto Wolff also blamed the track and the circumstances. ""George controlled the race. Kimi withstood the pressure from the McLarens. That was possible because we gave them the car for it. Fast corners and rough asphalt like in Barcelona aren\'t so good for our car, because the tires are put under too much strain. And then we have the problem with overheating.""\n\n> Conditions were ideal for Mercedes during qualifying on Saturday. Russell was concerned before the start because the track temperature had risen by six degrees compared to Saturday. ""I was surprised that the temperature increase didn\'t affect us. The tires are simply not challenged as much in the slow corners. It was the same last year. Back then, we threw away a victory. This time we were able to seize our opportunity.\n\n> **Mercedes reacted to Verstappen.**\nFrom the engineers\' perspective, the explanation for Mercedes\' Montreal mystery sounds like this: ""With one exception, this track has only one type of corner. This makes it easy to set up the car. In the corners with little lateral acceleration, the tire doesn\'t flex enough to overheat. The smooth asphalt is good for the tire surface. Therefore, thermal wear was minimal. The biggest problem for everyone was graining on the left front. There was a simple solution for that: You couldn\'t push too hard in Turns 3, 5, and 7.""\n\n> Mercedes had the speed, tire management, and track position to react to everything their opponents threw at them. Mercedes soon identified Verstappen as their main challenger. Therefore, they reacted to Red Bull\'s pit stops. When it briefly looked like Oscar Piastri might have a one-stop race, the Mercedes command center remained calm. ""We had the confidence to catch him again with fresher tires.""\n\n> The McLarens only managed to keep their tires in better condition than Mercedes in the final stint due to the shorter running times. The Red Bulls failed earlier in each of the first two stints. ""The tires only held up at the end, with less fuel in the tank,"" said the Formula 1 World Champion.

1lcwcb2,Fernando Alonso's future?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lcwcb2/fernando_alonsos_future/,2025-06-16, Discussion,"
Alonso's future will be AM until at least 2026. He already said that he signed a multi-year contract in 2024 and according to Pedro de la Rosa, AM ambassador who usually comments on various things on Dazn, he will be probably also in 2027. 

I know that the English press makes up things and assumes many things quickly with Alonso, especially because many leaks, information and facts do not reach them and only appear in the Spanish press. Above all because, as I said, important people like Pedro de la Rosa keep information to themselves and give clues in the Spanish press. It has happened before, but lately it has been very noticeable. 

Now, speaking of Alonso's not-so-distant future... There are rumors that Russell will replace Alonso next year or in 2 years. That Alonso will go to Alpine because he was seen in the Alpine offices and other things. Pedro de la Rosa denied this, he was only there because Briatore and his parents were there, it was just a walk, that hoax has been denied. Cowell and AM backed Alonso and it is confirmed once again that Alonso is not going to Alpine and will remain at AM for a few more years.  Besides, it's obvious that he won't be returning to alpine, he had enough a few years ago. 

Now, there are rumors that Honda would like a Japanese driver to be in AM, BUT, it is not known if they would want to take Stroll or Alonso, here there is nothing confirmed 

I've gotten all this information from Pedro de la Rosa's IG, various informants, live broadcasts on DAZN, reliable sources, and reliable newspapers. In any case, you can visit Pedro de la Rosa's IG or search for information that's been coming out lately. I can't post Dazn videos because it's a paid service and I prefer not to break any rules of that style.

What do people think about all this? Please share if you have any information. I'm curious.","[""He's got another 40 years in him at least"", ""AM is his retirement Valhalla. I mean he is already a legend, bagging another WDC at his age now would just elevate that further. He will see out his contract, for a couple of years of Newey AM Honda for chance maybe at WDC and if that doesn't pan out he will retire probably. Get married, make babehs, and enjoy his millions and revisit the grid with his progeny decade+ later. \n\nNo way he is going back to Alpine. It's maybe shot at WDC, retirement, and long term roles and ambassadorship at AM. And maybe shot at the triple crown once a year at Indy for 5 years before babeh time, with all his free time, if he's up to the risks."", 'Good question! Crofty kept talking about Alonso going to the Alpine garage four times in Thursday and Friday in Canada. It sounds more likely he was just seeing friends or family or something but then again it is Alonso we are talking about, and it is Alpine we are talking about. I wouldn’t rule anything out.\xa0\n\nI think the situation with Aston is that Alonso has a contract for 2026. Fernando mightn’t be able to break out of that contract but the team can break him out. After that it appears that Aston want him to become a team ambassador or something. I don’t think Alonso will drive for Aston in 2027 unless he’s in the 2026 title fight which seems unlikely with the Merc engine runours, speaking of which, Alpine have the fancied Merc engine in 2026 which makes them an attractive option.\n\nWe also know that Flávio is Alonso’s manager and they have a long history. While one last get together sounds unthinkable, is it impossible? Stranger things have happened in F1.\xa0\n\nI think the situation all depends on Max Verstappen. If we get the unlikely scenario where he goes to Mercedes or Aston Martin, then I think Alonso has been told or heard that in this scenario he loses his seat. If Max goes to Merc then George goes to Aston to replace Fernando. if Max goes to Aston he replaces Fernando. Basically Lance will defo drive next season amd Alonso knows hes out if Max leaves Red Bull which is very unlikely.\xa0\n\nHowever I’ll reiterate that nothing is impossible in the F1 transfer market and if Max does leave RB Alonso doenst want to be left off the grid, therefore he is making sure he has a plan B, that plan B is Alpine.\xa0\n\nIf Alonso actually has the power to break his contract, maybe for a performance clause, then it will be very interesting to see if Alpine becomes his plan A. I think Flávio would 100% take him over Franco, so if both parties want each other (and Alonso might be tempted by getting 26 and 27 rather than just 26 at Aston) and Alonso can break free, Alpine have a very strong Alonso, Gasly partnership in 2026 and Aston are left with Stroll and would likely go in for Yuki or maybe an F2 driver.\xa0\n\n\xa0All of that said I think that the most likely scenario is we keep the status quo for 2026, but if Alonso can get out of his contract he might try. One final roll of the dice by the man who’s rolled more dice than any other.', 'Didn’t Alonso’s recent contract with AM include him signing up to stay there beyond his stint as a driver? I can’t remember if it detailed in what capacity but I definitely remember the ‘beyond driving’ part being discussed when he re-signed. This is pure speculation on my part obviously but I think he’ll see what Newey & co come up with for the new regs next year and then make a decision about his driving future based on that. I cannot see the Alpine rumour being true, the team is still the same shitshow he left, despite his ties to Flávio. I also still think it’s more likely Max will eventually go to AM than Russell tbh.', 'Guy is going to be 45 soon and at some point he will want to retire, he already has his management side gig and I wouldnt be surprised if he gets a few more drivers under him in the coming years. He isnt going anywhere and to be honest I doubt anyone would want an expensive old driver who is cranky. \n\nHulk and Hamilton will also be gone soon, Sainz is the next oldest but is still good enough to be in F1. I dont see any of them past 2027 to be honest, its time for a new generation.', 'I think you think highly of PDLR.', ""Alonso has a contract with AM until 2026, and he said he will keep racing while he think he is capable of doing it at the highest level. In the last races he showed he is capable of doing that. Alonso and Briatore are good friends, don't look too much into a visit to Alpine. \n\nEverything else are just rumours.\n\nHonda is going to be partner with AM. They will have voice in team decisions, so they may want a new driver in the second seat (Tsunoda, Iwasa, ?). The Strolls could be leaving F1 at the end of the year. Lance's hand injury could be one of the public reasons given for his exit.\n\nLuca De Meo is leaving Renault, so Briatore might have limited time remaining at Alpine. It could change owners for 2026.

1ldmk8t,The Comeback: Is Ferrari the Boston Red Sox of F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ldmk8t/the_comeback_is_ferrari_the_boston_red_sox_of_f1/,2025-06-17, Discussion,"I just watched [The Comeback](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31186041/) on Netflix and was immediately struck by the parallels between the Boston Red Sox and Ferrari teams, especially when the teams aren’t winning. 

To those unfamiliar, the Boston Red Sox are one of the most storied teams in Major League Baseball history. For a time, and on multiple occasions, the Red Sox have been plagued by near-miss or fumbled title aspirations: the 1986 World Series against the Mets blowing the game with one out remaining, and the 2023 playoffs, where they blew a 3-run lead in game 7 in extra innings against the Yankees. The Red Sox finally broke “the curse” and won a World Series in 2004 to end an 86-year title drought. 

Both teams have passionate fans (Red Sox Nation and Tifosi), a rich history and tradition, are iconic brands in their own right, have enjoyed great successes, but also catastrophic defeats and prolonged droughts between championships. But two things that drove this home were: 

1. The media’s reaction to a losing team 
2. The amount of work and time to rebuild a winning team 

The media has a frenzied and panicked tone when the teams are underperforming - this goes beyond a bog-standard team enduring a losing streak. The knives are incredibly sharp, and fingers point in all directions. From questioning management decisions, challenging accountability and the lack of transparency to the lack of individual performance. The media becomes a singular point of criticism to express fan dissatisfaction. Dan Shaughnessy is probably one of the best examples, once having called the team “frauds” (the 2004 championship team, actually). 

I couldn’t say for sure who the Italian equivalent might be, as I’m not based in Italy and only learned Italian on Duolingo, but perhaps Giorgio Terruzzi or Pino Allievi? Terruzzi always seems particularly critical of Hamilton, recently writing that the [marmot murder was not pivotal in his result](https://www.corriere.it/sport/formula-1/25_giugno_16/f1-ferrari-commento-76b54281-b1a6-4495-a811-f83549b16xlk.shtml#:~:text=Hamilton%20has%20a%20weak%20excuse%20because%20he%20was%20hit%20by%20a%20poor%2C%20dazed%20marmot%20that%20compromised%20the%20aerodynamics%20but%2C%20let%27s%20be%20clear%2C%20we%20are%20once%20again%20talking%20about%20a%20broken%20promise%2C%20a%20breathless%20race%2C%20on%20a%20track%20that%20he%20loves%2C%20after%20an%20encouraging%20qualifying.), which seems disingenuous at best. The one thing that is slightly different is that Boston tends to focus on the [ownership and management](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/john-henry-red-sox-ownership-drawing-criticism-for-teams-lackluster-roster-management/#:~:text=In%20the%20Boston%20Herald%2C%20Jason,the%20Red%20Sox'%20overall%20plan) of teams, whereas, in my limited understanding, Italian media come for the team principal (and drivers, or at least one driver anyway). 

Building, or rather, rebuilding greatness takes time and investment. Given that the main performance assets in MLB are players, who are easily acquired by trade and can play immediately. Credit to the GM Theo Epstein, who recognised what needed to be done. Boston finally broke the curse in 2004 by trading for depth in pitching and all-arounders/defensive players, including getting rid of one of the faces of their franchise.  

Maybe it’s unfair to compare Ferrari to Boston in this way. In F1, beyond drivers, you need technicians and engineers who are not always readily available, and, even then, require periods of gardening leave that restrict their ability to make an immediate impact. The team principal plays a key role, which is perhaps why stability is most important and why you might be inclined to look further up the chain or at the wider structures in place, which need to change.

What happens at Ferrari remains to be seen but what do you think?","['Seems like you put a lot of effort into this post, so I will say.. sure', ""Ferrari wouldn't trade Rafael Devers for scraps"", 'I’d say more like the Yankees; they have not won in years, are the most famous team, can still make some noise.', 'No.', 'If you want to believe, then Next Year is Our Year.', 'Ferrari is like the Yankees with a salary cap.', ""I'm not sure if this will work.
