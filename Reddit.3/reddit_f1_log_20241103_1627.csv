There seems to be multiple people and sources saying there was ""long time"" between crash and Verstappen dropping out of top 10. Rewatched to confirm. First picture is moment yellow flags are thrown out (graphic isn't even fully shown yet), second one (1 second later) shows Leclerc making into top 10.

Biggest loser here was Bottas who was robbed since Albon and Lawson got their times done (Albon when time left 1:09, Lawson when time left 1:03).

Tldr: no, there was less than 1 second for stewards to react for red flag which is basically impossible. Red Bulls dropped because they left themself last.

1gig99z,The State of F1's Safety Car Interventions,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gig99z/the_state_of_f1s_safety_car_interventions/,2024-11-03, Statistics,"After the concerning delay in declaring a Virtual Safety Car during this weekend's sprint race, much has been said about F1's officiating attempting to rig the results of races to make better TV. This accusation is, after the end of the 2021 season, potentially justified. However, the discussion has been doing an incredible disservice to the fact that the past few seasons have been an ongoing showcase of a potentially dangerous slowness to deploy Safety Cars, Virtual Safety Cars, or red flags. To educate myself and (hopefully) the rest of the subreddit, I went back and reviewed very SC/VSC intervention so far this season and made note of how long it took the race director to make the decision and neutralize the race. 

  
TL;DR up front, because this is going to be long; the average time this season between an incident occurring and a VSC or SC being deployed is a whopping \*48 seconds.\* 

  
Quick methodology notes up front: I used the very helpful [list of safety car interventions this season](https://www.lightsoutblog.com/every-safety-car-f1-2024/) by Nick Haldenby at Lights Out Blog, and went back to each race with the F1TV feed, the live timing, and a stopwatch. For cars that stopped alongside or on the track, I started the clock at the point when the car stopped moving (assuming that they wouldn't want to intervene in a race if a driver can quickly get moving again). Twice this season we've had VSC's deployed due to debris on the track, at Miami and Austria -- I've chosen not to include these as they would skew the average time calculation. So, here's the list:

  
Saudi Arabia, Lap 6: Stroll into the barriers, 50 seconds

Australia, lap 17: Hamilton stops on track, 20 seconds (from the moment of stoppage -- he did spend a long time trying to limp the car back)

Australia, lap 58: Russell into the barriers, 12 seconds

Japan, lap 1: Albon and Ricciardo collide, 23 seconds (race red-flagged)

China, lap 22: Bottas stops in the runoff, 1 minute 37 seconds (this was the incident reposted today of him exiting his car while standing at the end of the braking zone, under only yellow flags)

China, lap 27: Tsunoda and Magnussen collide, 15 seconds

Miami (sprint), lap 1: Norris and Stroll collide, 58 seconds

Miami, lap 29: Sargeant and Magnussen collide, 24 seconds

Monaco, lap 2: Perez/Hulk/Magnussen collide, 39 seconds (race red-flagged -- had to open Perez' onboard for this to even figure out when the crash occurred)

Canada, lap 25: Sargeant into the barriers, 40 seconds

Canada, lap 54: Sainz and Albon collide, 27 seconds

Azerbaijan, lap 50: Perez and Sainz collide, 1 minute 35 seconds

Austin, lap 2: Hamilton into the gravel, 53 seconds

Mexico, lap 1: Tsunoda into the barrier, 41 seconds

Brazil (sprint), lap 22: Hulkenberg stops on track, 2 minutes 2 seconds

  
The fastest reaction was a mere 12 seconds in Australia, while the longest came yesterday at 2 minutes and 2 seconds. However, that does still leave our average time at 48 seconds for this season. I did not take notes on every incident's on-track battles, but did notice that they didn't seem to favor one team consistently throughout the season. Without inside information that I doubt we'll ever see, it's impossible to know whether the delays are coming from a communications issue, a lack of confidence, or a desire to leave it as late as possible so the racing can continue (a la the old ""Racing back to the caution"" rule that NASCAR rightly did away with in the 2000's). Regardless, this is very clearly an ongoing issue, going back years, Taking longer than 60 seconds to make the decision for intervention should be a rare occasion, and yet we've had 3 such incidents this season.

  
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do the same analysis for the 2023 season yet, but I would like to. Without a convenient pre-made list of SC and VSC interventions, it's a bit more work, but if people would like me to I'll happily keep working on it (I might do anyway, just for my own curiosity). 

  
In parting, this specifically came out of my frustration at seeing people saying things like, ""any other race and they'd have sent the VSC out right away,"" when I clearly remembered this being a pattern of behavior from the officials. It's good to be aware of the potential for issues like that, but in situations like this where driver safety is being potentially placed at risk, it detracts \*HEAVILY\* from a very real, very concerning pattern. ","['Quality post and effort OP. This also reminds me of how long race control took before deploying a safety car back at Baku 2021 for either Stroll or Verstappen‚Äôs retirement when their tires randomly blew up. I remember after the race it was found that multiple drivers ignored the double waved yellows in that section by going significantly faster, yet in the end no one got a penalty for it. This has consistently been an issue like you said.\n\nEdit: [This article goes into further detail about how long it took for the Safety Car to be deployed for their crashes, and mentions how Masi wasn‚Äôt satisfied with how some drivers failed to slow sufficiently for double waved yellows](https://www.racefans.net/2021/06/09/eight-safety-questions-raised-by-azerbaijan-grand-prix-crashes-and-f1s-reaction/)', 'I saw that hulkenberg was moving (in neutral presumably) after the start of the double yellows. \n\nWhen did he stop moving? Was it a huge gap between him stopping completely and him getting out of the car?', ""I'm a marshall at Monza and I will try to explain why there's usually a long delay from the incident to the actual decision\n\nFirst of all a marshall has to report the incident to the race director to asses the conditions of the track and the driver, it's not so easy to do from the camera feed but a marshall that is right there at like 10m or less can easily evaluate the situation better.\n\nThen the circuit race director has to translate what is being said (because for us we communicate in Italian but the FIA race director understands English) and the FIA race director has to make a decision\n\nKeep in mind that usually as long as the car it's still limping around and the driver is not out they won't ever give out a VSC or a SC because it's always better to just wave a double yellow and let the driver bring the car to safety\n\nIn cases like Australia I highly doubt that there was even some sort of communication between the track marshall and the race director, they gave the VSC too quickly so I suppose the fia race director decided without hearing the marshalls (and rightfully so, I'm not blaming the decision it was the right thing to do)\n\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of communication between the track marshalls and the race director then again between the two of them. Then the decision is given out which in turn takes another few seconds\n\nIt's never as easy as on TV you might think it is, and also trust me a race director does not want to use a SC or a VSC (while on the FCY they are more favorable because it's a lot better)\n\n\nAlso it's worth noting that if an accident happens like at turn 1 but all the cars are already past that point they will tend to wait for the sc/vsc, because marshalls might be able to remove the car in like 20/30 seconds without having the need to deploy a safety measure. In case the sc/vsc is deployed they will let them race up until almost the end of the lap so they get a bit more action before having the race neutralized"", 'The worst thing is if I‚Äôm remembering correctly even there fastest of 12 seconds was to slow considering the scenario, Russel was upside down in a high speed section with debris up in the air blocking vision of Russel, so within that 12 seconds  a car almost drove directly into the underfloor of russels car, a red flag should of immediately been thrown out in this situation, it‚Äôs just not good enough and unfortunately seems like it is going to take another fatal accident before they tighten up these calls.', 'Agree this is a quality post! What I don‚Äôt get is why the VSC cannot be deployed right away, even for just a few seconds, when something is clearly happening at the track. Almost as a swift replacement for double-waved yellows in most situation. Then full SC can be deployed within 30-60 seconds if deemed crucial. That was the whole point of introducing the VSC: not to have all the issues and instances OP rightfully brought up!', ""I watch a lot of feeder series as well, and the thing I note in both places is that sometimes flags or safety cars or other things aren't called until they imminently need to be called for safety. What I mean is that if the accident happens at turn one, and in two seconds all the cars are past turn one before anything could possibly be called... well, the cars won't be back around to turn one for more than a minute, sometimes much more depending on the track. So, often I think officials let it go for a bit so that we can get some more active racing while they aren't actually near a hazard. In several feeder series, they are much more likely than F1 to not call a safety car of any kind if some yellows or double yellows around one area are sufficient, and then they are active racing around the rest of the lap."", 'Do you also know the average time without the 2 minutes and 2 seconds from yesterday? I would expect that the average would be way down then and even shows more what of an outlier yesterday was.', 'Just a note - WEC/GT3 series (SRO based) have a mandated decision time of 45 seconds to call a VSC/SC or leave it under local yellows.', ""You have to consider, that safety car deployment will take longer / is delayed on purpose, if all cars are are close to each other with no back trackers and the fiele has already patheted the yellow sector.\n\nFor example first lap accidents or accidents after safety car restarts.\n\nThere is no risk in waiting to deploy the SC until sector 3, if the crash happens in sector 1 and that's what is done every time.\n\nFor red flag incidents it is different and they tend to call it faster to avoid a mess regarding restarting positions and to allow cars to cool down before returning to box.""]",360,103,0.94,360,98,98,-5,0,0.0,-5

The closest thing I could find is the rule about drivers that are not classified at the end of a qualifying session (39.4.b):

>Drivers will be considered to be ‚Äúunclassified‚Äù in the following circumstances:

>i) If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race Director.

>ii) If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted

>iii) If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint shootout

Unless this is covered by some other rule that I didn't see (if so, apologies for wasting your time), if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:

>The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows:

>\- Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 **(or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)**

If I understand correctly, then it has to be Free Practice 1 classification order and the commentators that mentioned the possibility of Stewards using a different order are incorrect. I wonder if the rest of Rule 39.4.b is the cause of this misunderstanding:

>The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters such as:

>\- A suitable lap time being set in another practice session  
\- The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the Championship  
\- The gravity of the offence which caused the driver‚Äôs disqualification

which is about allowing drivers that did not classify at the end of the qualifying session to start the race and not about their position in the grid if allowed. Usually drivers are allowed to start the race unless there are serious driver / car performance or safety concerns.

Did I miss something?

Final note: the Rule on moving the qualifying session is quite straightforward, basically the Race Director and Stewards can do whatever they want (inside FIA rules) based on Rule 15.3.a:

>The clerk of the course shall work in permanent consultation with the Race Director. The Race Director shall have overriding authority in the following matters and the clerk of the course may give orders in respect of them only with his express agreement:

>a) The control of free practice, qualifying session, sprint shootout, sprint session and the race, adherence to the timetable and, if he deems it necessary, the making of any proposal to the stewards to modify the timetable in accordance with the Code or Sporting Regulations.","['Fuck knows', ""the truth is there is no precedent. race director will make the final call if the qualifying doesn't go through.\n\nalthough i personally feel if the weather is bad enough for there to be no qualifying whatsoever then it is really ambitious to hope for a race to happen as well."", ""Stewards discretion seems to be the most likely option but teams will protest for sure. It's going to be a hot mess.\n\nAlthough it probably won't matter looking at the forecast"", ""Time for Verstappen to pull a Hamilton '21\n\nWe're here for it"", ""Logical answer: sprint quali grid\n\nProbable answer: some FIA moment ruling that hasn't been thought of makes FP1 the race grid session."", ""You did not miss anything i think, there is no rule yet.\n\n>if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:\n\nThat is the question. If quali doesn't happen at all, does that mean that all 20 drivers failed to set a lap time during Q1 in the sense of this regulation? I don't think it has to be seen that way if Q1 never started and the stewards could use a different order.\n\nFor next year the rules in this situation would be WDC order."", '""If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1""\n\nThey didn\'t, the -did- set a time in SQ1. So logic says Sprint Qualifying order.

Then the three behind him will have to sort themselves out. \n\nThe only thing is, Norris usually loses his P1 pole in the first lap and first corners, but when he not starts from pole, he generally starts pretty well and then starts gaining momentum. \n\nWhat I expect is that at T1, Piastri will have a decent start, Norris will have a decent start, Charles will have a better start, and Max will have a good start.

It would put Piastri in a hard situation, as Piastri would have to fight Charles quite a lot, but give Lando some breathing. The Mclarens really come alive after a few laps so I think LeClerc would find himself being beaten by Piastri after a few laps anyway, however, IF Charles passes, that means Verstappen is right there behind him, and Max is gonna divebomb. \n\nUnfortunately for Lando, him being P2, really puts him into the position, that it's gonna be Oscar that's gonna drive off, and find himself lodged between Charles, which he can overtake, but has to meanwhile defend from Max, whom WILL divebomb, and i think T4 is the place where the action will happen."", 'Here comes the complaining that he dare beat lord Norrison Duke of skyf1', 'Piastri is the Sainz of Mclaren, gets beaten like 5 times in a row then manages to chef once', ""When he gets more consistent at qualifying he is going to be an absolute force to be reckoned with.

I witnessed and followed the Senna and Schumaker years closely. Truth be told, I was not a great fan of either driver. Both had a steely, almost narcissistic obsession with winning and coming second was not an option. The cacophony of noise that followed them (prior to social media) was deafening.

Senna was described as a danger to himself, and other drivers, and it would only be a matter of time before he caused a serious (potentially fatal) crash. It was said that he meditated deeply prior to the race and that he believed that he was guided by some higher power, which made him untouchable in the race. It was claimed that he remained sitting in his car when the race was interrupted (red flagged) often for long periods, as he did not want anything to break this mental focus.¬† It was said that his ‚Äúcrazy beliefs‚Äù rather than exceptional talent, was the only explanation for the crazy high speeds he was able to able to race at, in very poor conditions with near zero visibility!

Was it the same case with Schumacher as well? Nowadays most people, including me, adore him but that's only because we only ever heard of the legend.

If so, how and when to time the wet race so it simulates rain properly - they almost need a computer controlled randomised algorithm that can simulate the weather radar aspect too. It\'s the unpredictable wet weather that makes rain races interesting. \n\nDo they make the whole track wet? Just a portion of the track? What are the safety implications of doing it - has to enough water to make it wet enough for inters I guess or it\'s a waste of time? \n\nAnd how much water do they need to deploy to make it practical. Maybe it\'s an unrealistically large amount for the whole track but could be simulated on a smaller portion as if rain was only on part of the track. \n\nIt\'s not beyond any technical possibility, the problem is making sure there\'s no impropriety if humans are involved in the process so everyone has the same data to work with.\n\nWould give the teams another angle to consider - wet setup Vs quali Vs race for example. Also means they get to do more running on wets so when it comes to the real thing in a GP they have better knowledge of the tyres. Gives rookies a chance to improve their skills. \n\nI think I\'d also be tempted to remove the WDC/WCC points from the sprints and have separate scoring that is almost a separate title. Let the teams race the sprints without being handcuffed by the main F1 limitations on parts. Again, have to avoid impropriety here and separate out the sprint race stuff from the main race stuff carefully.\n\nAt the moment it feels like a bit of a procession without the pit stops, strategy and wear / tear of a full length GP. \n\nOr go the other way, and make sprint races purely for rookies, backup drivers and test drivers with just a simple Gold, Silver and Bronze award for each sprint & doesn\'t have to be a dull 20 car grid.

Trying to understand the rules and penalties better. 

If Max is taking a new engine, will he have it only for the Quali/GP or all weekend including the Sprint? 

If he's using it for the whole weekend, does Max's engine Penalty apply to the sprint and the GP or just the latter?

I'm thrown off by the Sprint aspect. ","['In a **Sprint Weekend** format, such as the **Brazilian Grand Prix** this weekend, the way engine penalties work is indeed a bit different due to the additional Sprint event. Here‚Äôs how it generally applies:\n\n1. **New Engine Usage**: If a driver like Max takes a new engine (or any other power unit component) that exceeds the allowed allocation, he will receive a **grid penalty**.\n2. **Where the Penalty Applies**:\n   * **Grid Penalties** for power unit changes (e.g., taking a new engine) **only apply to the main Grand Prix** on Sunday, not the Sprint.\n   * This means if Max takes a new engine, he would receive a grid drop for the starting position of Sunday‚Äôs Grand Prix, but he can still start the Sprint race in the position he qualifies in Sprint Shootout.\n3. **Sprint Race Effect**:\n   * The Sprint event is treated as a separate race with its own qualifying session (Sprint Shootout) and is not affected by power unit penalties in terms of grid position.\n   * Therefore, any penalty Max incurs for the new engine would **not impact his Sprint starting position**‚Äîit only impacts his grid position for the Grand Prix on Sunday.\n\nTo summarise, if Max takes a new engine this weekend, the **penalty only affects the starting grid for Sunday‚Äôs Grand Prix** and does not impact his starting position for the Sprint race. The Sprint results themselves also do not influence the grid for Sunday, as the main Grand Prix grid is set by the qualifying session held on Friday.', 'The penalty applies to his Grand Prix qualifying position. The engine goes into his overall pool and is thus available for every session from the moment of its introduction.', 'Penalty is given to the race not the sprint race', 'Just the GP. It used to apply to the sprint before when it was Quali - SQ - Sprint - Race but now Sprint is no longer in Parc Ferme, meaning you can change your setups after the sprint too. Sprint is just a more entertaining FP with points.', 'Can‚Äôt penalise him for both races as that‚Äôs a double penalty and giving it to him for the sprint race where there isn‚Äôt as many points on offer would be unfair to those that take the penalty during non sprint race weekends', ""He will have the new engine for any sessions that he wants it for this weekend, and the penalty will only be for the grand prix. There being a sprint doesn't change anything. He'll definitely run the new engine for the sprint.

The goal should always be to drive the car as quickly and safely as possible, with overtaking only occuring if those objectives can still be met.\n\nIE at the apex of T4 it is clear Verstappen is going to run wide of the normal racing line, as shown by Sainz‚Äôs positioning ahead and Leclerc following.  Still he unwinds the wheel and accelerates leaving the corner, setting himself up even worse for T5, simply because he wants to force Norris to back out.  \n\nThen in T8 he is braking well past his ‚Äòapex‚Äô which defies any understanding of how to drive a normal corner quickly.  In that moment he only wanted to be on the inside, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt‚Äôs a strict line of thinking but these are the best drivers in the world.

You would‚Äôve never guessed it would happen to either of these teams. Hamilton to Ferrari is looking like another McLaren to Mercedes move.\xa0', '-Q: Did the team get useful data comparing the old spec and the upgraded one?\xa0\n\n\nA: Again, the updates brought the performance that was expected. What they didn\'t get was a clean run in clear air, Lewis had a balance issue in stint 1 (info: Lewis said he took too much front wing out before the race, which gave him understeer. They corrected that during the pit stop) and George had a broken front wing in stint 2 plus traffic for both drivers.\xa0\n\n\n-Q: How did George damage his front wing ?\n\n\nA: Happened during an overtake when the car hit a bump in the middle of the track at full speed (with DRS on, the front wing drops more as there\'s less load on the car). He lost a lot of aero balance and had a lot of understeer.\xa0\n\n\n-Q: With the team\'s position set in the Constructors, what will the next races be like?\xa0\n\n\nA: Good opportunity for experimenting for 2025, doing setup work, testing items and small bits of bodywork, but no more major upgrades.\xa0\n\n\n-Q: Will George have the repaired upgrades in Brazil?\n\n\nA: It\'s the plan, lot of work going on at the factory at the moment, the new floor should be on its way now and they\'re confident it\'ll be ready.\n\n\n-Q: What are the expectations for Brazil?\xa0\n\n\nA: They think McLaren and Ferraei will be ""very difficult opposition"" given how strong they\'ve been in slow corners recently (crucial for sector 2 in Brazil).

Ideally, forward-facing T-cam should always be available and it is good that they are working on that.\n\n>This meant that the respective stewards of those meetings had to make their calls without a very important piece of evidence\n\nNot quite. Mercedes had the same thought in Brazil 2021 and requested a right of review on the ground of the forward facing onboard and the 360 camera. It was [dismissed ](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/bra_doc_55_-_decision_-_mercedes_-_right_of_review_0.pdf)with a lengthy explanation regarding significance that also contained this\n\n>As\xa0noted\xa0above,\xa0the\xa0Stewards\xa0often\xa0must\xa0make\xa0a\xa0decision\xa0quickly\xa0and\xa0on\xa0a\xa0limited\xa0set\xa0of\xa0 information.\xa0At\xa0the\xa0time\xa0of\xa0the\xa0decision,\xa0the\xa0Stewards\xa0felt\xa0they\xa0had\xa0sufficient\xa0information\xa0 to\xa0make\xa0a\xa0decision,\xa0which\xa0subsequently\xa0broadly\xa0aligned\xa0with\xa0the\xa0immediate\xa0post‚Äêrace\xa0 comments\xa0of\xa0both\xa0drivers\xa0involved.\xa0\xa0Had\xa0they\xa0felt\xa0that\xa0the\xa0forward‚Äêfacing\xa0camera\xa0video\xa0 from\xa0Car\xa033\xa0was\xa0crucial\xa0in\xa0order\xa0to\xa0take\xa0a\xa0decision,\xa0they\xa0would\xa0simply\xa0have\xa0placed\xa0the\xa0 incident\xa0under\xa0investigation\xa0‚Äì\xa0to\xa0be\xa0investigated\xa0after\xa0the\xa0race\xa0‚Äì\xa0and\xa0rendered\xa0a\xa0decision\xa0 after\xa0this\xa0video\xa0was\xa0available.\xa0\xa0They\xa0saw\xa0no\xa0need\xa0to\xa0do\xa0so.\xa0\n\nSo, basically, the steward decided to make a call without having seen the onboard because they felt it would not make a significant difference.

And if they feel like it's needed they should do that."", 'So the whole ‚Äúthe stewards have a lot more camera angles to judge this on than we‚Äù in commentary is bull shit?', '‚ÄúAny functioning society wouldn‚Äôt expect legal investigators to examine a crime with their view deliberately impaired ‚Äì so why should F1 be any different?‚Äù\n\nAny functioning society would also think comparing a crime investigation to a car race is fucking absurd, but we don‚Äôt have a functioning society anymore.', ""Mentioned this in threads over the past week.

In Mexico Carlos Sainz did what his teammate had managed a week earlier in Austin. A decisive and deserved victory for the driver from Madrid, who had also taken an always complicated pole position for Ferrari, in a weekend certainly with fewer hitches than Leclerc. Lando Norris got between the two reds, taking away the chance for the Prancing Horse to repeat the one-two. However, a first and a third position remain that have an important weight in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n\nFerrari is now second in the Constructors and is the real anti-McLaren. The consistency of Leclerc and Sainz could be the extra weapon.\n\nThe SF-24 is now the real rival of the English team leading the constructors' championship, with Red Bull completely disappeared and, by Max Verstappen's own admission, never really fighting in recent weeks for the most coveted championship for most of the team owners. Ferrari's recovery could be considered sensational given that in two weekends, the Leclerc-Sainz duo has recovered 46 points on McLaren, now moving into second place at -29 points with four GPs to go. Enrico Cardile's former car has been put back on the right track with the update packages introduced in Monza and Singapore, confirming overseas that the steps forward made are to be considered more than important .\n\n\nIs Ferrari now the best car overall? In Maranello they don't want to hear about it, also because there is the certainty that the Mexican GP would have been much more complicated to win without the important skirmishes between Verstappen and Norris. The latter in fact showed the best race pace after the switch to hard tyres and a certain drop in asphalt temperature while he was certainly slowed down by Max Verstappen in the first part of the race, where Ferrari managed to open up the gap that guaranteed him the victory with Sainz.\n\n\nThe English McLaren driver used the new bottom all weekend, which was not a given at least at the start of the weekend, a sign that the important improvements expected by the Woking team were seen on track in FP2. For his part, Leclerc had to manage a lot, with a continuous lift-and-coast that prevented him from keeping the pace of the Madrid driver also due to the difficulty of keeping the tyres in the optimal window. It should also be underlined that having skipped FP1 and not having been able to work significantly on the set-ups in FP2 , due to the hour and a half dedicated mainly to testing the Pirelli tyres, did not help the Monegasque driver . A Leclerc who already in Austin had adapted more slowly to the new balance generated by a much more flexible front wing than the specification that had debuted in Singapore , and only with the setup changes between the Sprint and Main Race had he found that little something extra that had allowed him to dominate on the American Sunday. In Mexico, the time available was very short for the Monegasque, who entered qualifying almost in the dark regarding the set-up, so much so that he did not perform as well as his teammate.\n\n\nMexico has put to rest any doubts about the progress of SF-24, but will Interlagos close the circle?\n\nNow Ferrari is clearly the anti-McLaren and the gap from the top, after the latest evolutions brought to the SF-24, in certain phases and technical areas seems to have almost disappeared. And so the consistency of the Leclerc-Sainz duo could be the extra weapon in an unexpected, at least until a few weeks ago, chase for the constructors, which has been missing from Maranello since the distant 2008. If the car is able to compete for the victory, it seems more likely that there will be at least two drivers dressed in red on the podium than dressed in orange and this could be a significant advantage. An aspect in which McLaren ‚Äì with the little experience of Piastri and an alternating current Lando Norris ‚Äì and Red Bull ‚Äì with a Perez in free fall ‚Äì are lacking compared to the red driver lineup.\n\n\nAt Interlagos it is very likely that we will see both McLarens equipped with the latest updates, and not just Lando Norris' MCL38, also to try to respond to the hard attack by Ferrari in the last two events. The Brazilian track will close the triptych of consecutive races that began in Austin, and is quite complete given that there are slow sections and also long and medium and high speed support corners, as well as weather that is still to be evaluated, especially for the Sunday race. Red Bull and Max Verstappen left Mexico with very few positives, except for the few points lost by the Dutchman against Norris. However, the RB20 still lacks a lot technically compared to Ferrari and McLaren even after the developments brought to Texas, which have improved the English car in terms of connection between the front and rear axle but have not significantly widened the operating window. This is why we see Max Verstappen constantly racing in defense, clinging to even incorrect maneuvers to ruin his rival's race, favoring in a certain way Ferrari, a clear ally of the three-time world champion. For their part, in Maranello they know they still have a chance in Brazil to give continuity to the best technical moment of the season for the SF-24, with only the Qatar layout that 'scaries'.

1gga3q8,Is it a good idea to let team decide if they want to give the position back?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gga3q8/is_it_a_good_idea_to_let_team_decide_if_they_want/,2024-10-31, Discussion,"I‚Äôve been wondering if this rule is something that the fans appreciate or not.

On one hand, to give the teams the ability to decide might prevent interference from the race director, allowing everything to be decided on the race track.

On the other hand, rule interpretation is (as we‚Äôve seen the past few races) is quite subjective. Even to decide what it means to be ahead at the apex can be different depending on the frame your looking at. The team or driver might believe they have done everything by the book, unaware of all the data. And to give them the responsibility of deciding if they should give the place back might result in penalties that would have been prevented if they were told to do so, resulting in interference from the outside and sometimes creating an even bigger change in a race result.

What do you think is the best idea for the quality of the race and is there any other possibility besides these two?","['It isn‚Äôt a rule, it‚Äôs a way to avoid a punishment by ensuring the action essentially never took place. I would like if the fia made a decision quicker and asked teams to give up a place rather than waiting half an hour though. \n\nJust push for actual track limits with grass or gravel and the issue is fixed. Tarmac was supposed to be safer, we‚Äôve found it isn‚Äôt, and motogp also wants gravel because a driver slowing down is better than sliding and hitting a wall.', ""The rule is: there is a penalty if you gain a lasting advantage by going off track\n\nThe way the rule is applied is: if you voluntarily give back a position obtained by going off track then you haven't gained a lasting advantage, so no penalty\n\nThe way the stewards work is basically to give the team a chance to comply with the rules themselves before they have to step in. Of course, in some cases teams won't accept that they should, or that they have broken the rules, so the stewards will then impose whatever penalty they think is due\n\nThis seems fine to me"", 'Your idea of stewards making the decision and telling the drivers to swap places has one major flaw: It often takes stewards several minutes to analyse the data and decide. By that time the positions on track are likely to be different.', ""I don't get your question? Teams currently decide if they tell the driver to give the place back or not. But as you say it's subjective and consistency seems to be 0 and sometimes they get it wrong and then they get penalties."", ""Yes the fans do appreciate. Anything that minimizes the influence of the stewards is welcomed. It's like in football when a player is fouled and the team continues attacking as they have a good position and setup and the ref plays an advantage.\n\n\nLike in COTA, if Norris had given the position back,he would still have a chance of overtaking Verstappen in the remaning 4 laps. Intead of that he received a penalty in the last lap.\xa0\n\n\nIf the penalty was instant he would have managed to create a 5 second gap. But the penalty came in the last lap where all he could manage was 4.1.\xa0"", ""Charlie used to give his opinion to the teams on whether they should give the place back or not. In theory I think that's a good idea. The teams get pretty quick feedback on whether or not it was a valid move and they can hand the position back without having to get penalties involved.\n\nThe problem was Charlie as race director could only give his opinion and it might be different to the stewards, and then you get situations like Spa 2008 where a team has been told they're fine only to get a penalty later on.\n\nIn an ideal world the stewards would be able to make a decision much quicker and could tell a driver to give a place back very quickly after the original move to avoid a penalty. That's not really possible though.\n\nI kind of think the current solution is the best of a bunch of flawed options really."", ""I think main issue here is that while the race is ongoing drivers increase gaps between one another, waiting for officials to make a decision takes a long time for something like this; usually the best moment to give place back is right after you 'stole' it, thus giving you more race distance to properly overtake later on. If you only rely on officials ruling and wait 1-2 laps you may pull away too far for the move to be profitable, or the driver you stole place from could lose his position to someone else, meaning that to give place back to them you would be losing to another driver between you as well; or that driver could deliberately/or not pit and create even bigger gap between you, forcing you to get a penalty. Teams usually try to decide as quick as possible right on the spot to avoid these scenarios, and if they think they are right, then thats on them if they end up being wrong."", ""A lot of the penalties are based on whether or not you gained an advantage by your action. Handing the place back just means you can say you didn't, in the end, gain an advantage. \n\nYou should still get a penalty for deliberately forcing other cars off the track, even if you give the place back later, because that's dangerous driving."", ""Ultimately, the stewards can't make a binding decision quickly enough during the race for them to be able to reliably let the teams know in good time.\n\nThe Race Director could give their opinion, as they have done in the past, but that's not binding and the stewards could still investigate and go against RD's opinion.""]",0,26,0.38,0,95,95,0,0,-0.02999999999999997,0

F1 spending: stop or continue?
In the midst of all this, of course, the relevance of the Audi F1 project seems very strange. With the economic situation of the Volkswagen group having deteriorated over the last two years, the arrival of the brand with the rings in Formula 1 is once again weakened. Audi has nevertheless done everything to ensure its arrival in 2026, in particular with the 100% acquisition of the Sauber group at the beginning of the year . Since the announcement in 2022, millions ‚Äì if not billions ‚Äì of euros have been invested in the construction of new buildings in Neuburg-on-the-Donau and in the recruitment of several hundred people to develop the 2026 engine.

Expenses already incurred, already spent, which place Audi and the Volkswagen group in a complex situation and in a terrible dilemma. Should the project continue, assume the colossal sums already invested (and which still have to be invested) in a context of unprecedented budgetary rigor on a group scale, to the detriment of thousands of jobs at VAG? Or should the tap be turned off as quickly as possible, ""sold"" the project to save what can be saved with a few million at stake - which obviously will not reimburse everything that has already been committed since 2022 - and try to reduce as much as possible the scale of the social plan that is being prepared in Germany?

Of course, Volkswagen could use the popularity of Formula 1 as a huge advertising spot and as a last (desperate?) attempt to revive its global sales, especially in Asia. The group had notably bet heavily on the Chinese market, but the strategy turned into a fiasco. Far from us the desire to revive unfounded rumors, we could then say to ourselves that a Guanyu Zhou could be the best advertisement for Audi and the Volkswagen group in order to give themselves a last chance on the Chinese market, the driver from Shanghai - the first and only Chinese driver in Formula 1 - enjoying incredible popularity in the Middle Kingdom. A reflection which could notably explain why Audi is taking so long to choose its second driver for 2025...

It's all there, and ready. \n\nthis all has been designed. matter of fact, the parts in brazil should/are vastly different to that of let's say spain, because of development. \n\nmeaning, the spain car is 'outdated' and can't be used anymore. this means that almost every race, a car is a disposable item anyway.\n\nthey have to MAKE the parts anyway, and they have to have spare parts ANYWAY.\n\nthe machines you need for the parts you need to have anyway. it's not like they now need to order a new 500k CNC machine. \n\nIn all fairness, wrecking a car makes it theoretically more efficient, as the spares are gone, now you have to use the last drop of what you made. if the next race you were going to introduce new parts anyway, then the old parts were to be 'thrown away'. or put into a museum at best. \n\nthe cost of making parts obviously is not zero, but again, the spare parts were made already. so, it's not like they had to 'order new parts' from a supplier, and they make it in-house. \n\nat best, you have over hours on your mechanics, which will have to be paid more. but relatively, that's minimal on an entire f1 budget. \n\nyes, obviously it costs money. but the whole image painted by the teams is nonsense. the only relative loss is the material cost if you have to make new ones or bring spares overnight, and mechanic costs. The bigger loss might be that you now have less data on your parts, and the driver less experience, meaning your development is compromised, and that MIGHT, just MIGHT mean your car might drop in the standings. \n\nHowever, there is no way that Mercedes is going to drop below Aston, and they're not gonna pass RBR either. So in the WCC standings and thus prize money, it won't make a difference either. \n\nF1 is a prototype series, which makes it vastly different to a GP3 cup series for example. If you run a private team, in a cup car series for example, and you buy a F.E. a Lamborghini, and you buy all the parts, and you don't actually make them yourself, or design it yourself, then yes, if you wreck a car, that's gonna be costly, because you now need to order/buy new parts. (Even though, you're supposed to have spares anyway still.)\n\nF1 teams are trying to act like they are a cup series, like they are buying lamborghini's, or bugatti's. they don't. perhaps to a degree you could say this about a team like Haas, whom buys parts from Ferrari for example, and when parts get wrecked, they need to order new parts from them as they can't make it themselves. But that has been calculated in by their accountants, which is why they buy the parts and don't manufacture them. Interestingly enough, this also lowers the costs for Ferrari as they get to make parts not only for them, but also sell them to other teams. VCARB is a good example here if they use RBR parts from the year before. \n\nSo to be honest, they're really throwing a lot of nonsense out."", 'Sargeant is still the champ.', ""But then where do you draw the line? if new parts are allowed to be produced without impacting the cost cap.

It was quite striking that Max has benefited a lot more from this. Perez took 7 points off Lando early in the season, thanks to the sheer dominance of the Red Bull, the extent of which we‚Äôve not seen replicated by McLaren later in the season. 

Oscar‚Äôs impact is the more interesting one. He‚Äôs pretty much only taken points off Max when he‚Äôs also taken points from Lando. He‚Äôs actually been a detriment to Lando. This is surprising as you would expect the McLaren to be able to deliver 1-2‚Äôs. I attribute this to a few no show weekends from Oscar leading to missed opportunities (Zandvoort, Singapore and Mexico) and Lando not having the same dominance over his teammate as Max. 

I still think we could see this trend start to reverse in the run-in. When you look at the McL‚Äôs dominance over Red Bull since summer break (notwithstanding Austin weekend), then there should be potential for Oscar to slot in between Max and Lando, also noting that McL have indicated they will use team orders.

Hope you find that interesting and welcome any thoughts ","['Sergio points from Max: 0', 'Arguably this kinda highlights the reasons why max will win the WDC and why McLaren will win the WCC (Sergio took no points off max, mostly due to spending most of his time racing haas and VCARB; McLaren on the other hand lost out on WDC points, but have (for the most part) 2 drivers instead of 1)', ""Perez didn't take points off Max but he could/should have taken more off Lando"", ""Just to add to the analysis though: in the case of McLaren, the other variables. It is not enough just to have a second car that could potentially finish up and down the grid, the team has to enable that, which McLaren has been uniquely very poor at doing. I'd love to know what Oscar could have done position-wise if the team was able to execute double-stack pit stops, etc. McLaren was resolute in not coordinating strategies to benefit Lando but could have positioned both better (read: ahead of Max) with a more thoughtful approach. And of course a better start to the season would have made a difference too: if a team is intent on not having a number one driver, they cannot let that driver start the year flat footed compared to the competition.

Even looking at the USA GP and Mex GP: multiple drivers we're penalized for forcing a driver off track or leaving the track and gaining an advantage, but at COTA all penalties were 5 sec. Now, Max got 10 sec (while I don't dissagree with the severity, it is inconsistent). Even within the Mexico GP: Max got 10 seconds for forcing Lando off track in Turn 4, being the defending car, whereas Perez got nothing for basically doing the same to Lawson as the overtaking car in the same corner.\n\nThat said, as for Max specifically: He is just smart. He simply knows how to use the rules to his advantage, even if that means making a 'smart foul'. Sportmanslike? Maybe not. But as long as it benefits him in terms of results (or it doesn't really hurt him in the worst case scenario), I think he will continu to exploit the regulations where it indeed is beneficial to him. And others at some point will follow his lead. You already saw drivers racing to the apex as they noticed Max did it effectively and gained an advantage by just racing to the apex.\n\nUnless this is more structurally adressed in a way where these 'fouls' do not result in a benefit (which can never be completely eliminated, but could be addressed better than this), I doubt things will change very much.\n\nI also think the penalty point race ban is pretty useless. With the exception of Magnussen (who really took the piss with the regulations on some occasions), this has never been applied. Perhaps a better approach could be to penalize repeat offenders more harshly. Forcing a driver off track? 5 seconds penalty. Do it again next week? 10 seconds. Third time? Drive through. This way you leave open the possibility of people making unintential mistakes and not having to penalize them hard, but you can impose more harsh penalties to those trying to use the regulations including limited penalties to their advantage.\n\nI also still think grid penalties should be a thing. Too often we have seen a penalized driver taking advantage of their penalty (or at least not being hurt by it) due to simply having a faster car that allowed them to open enough of a gap so the penalty won't affect the race result. Examples are Lewis at Silverstone 2021 and Max at Vegas 2023. (An example the other way around is Carlos in Australia 2023, where he got a 5 second penalty but with the safety car going to the finishline, he finished the race in P4, but with the penalty applied he dropped all the way to p12 as there was simply a que of drivers right behind him due to the safety car.)"", ""No they won't, people have been saying this kind of stuff since he came into the sport, the same as the 'he's going to kill someone' etc. It's all just PR narratives\n\n\nIt's all just noise and talk, all the racers will continue to race as they do now unless there's a significant change to the sporting rules.

1gg04e6,Appreciating Guenther Steiner,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gg04e6/appreciating_guenther_steiner/,2024-10-30, Discussion,"Ayao Komatsu has been doing great his first season as TP of Haas. But given the process of car development in F1, I think Steiner also deserves some credit for the current success.

After making the decision to get young drivers with hefty sponsorship (Mazepin, Mick) in exchange for performance to keep the team afloat during the pandemic years, Steiner pulled the plug on that phase and brought in a veteran duo of Hulk and Mag. At first, I thought it was Haas trying to be competitive right away. Then Steiner made the most difficult decision to, borrowing NBA terms, tank the 2023 season. 

The focus in 2023 then was developing the 2024 car. The vet drivers were brought in not for performance but to give productive feedback. Tanking to last place also got them maximum wind tunnel time, which helped not just in the car's initial development but also in maintaining a steady flow of upgrades for 2024.

It did cost Steiner his job. But now Haas is 6th, and   one would he hard pressed to argue that they would achieve that if Steiner did not make the difficult decision to tank ","['I think he definitely deserves credit for keeping the team alive long enough to survive honestly, but clearly they improved quite a bit once he was gone.\n\nBut obviously we know one person never makes a team, and one person rarely rights the ship.\n\nBut we have seen two team principals come into teams and turn them around pretty quickly, Komatsu and James Vowles.', 'He is likable, has humor, he is a straight shooter. He‚Äôll make a fun commentator.\n\nI don‚Äôt think highly of him as a team principal. He berated his drivers, punched down, played all sorts of politics to make them feel horrible. He always deflected blame. Some engineer, some driver, something always at fault. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Gene the buck stops with me and we will fix it‚Äù, for so many years.\n\nThe second he‚Äôs out, the team‚Äôs communication is healthy, vibrant. The drivers are happy. Points come in. This paints a picture of management having been unable to get the most out of their assets.\n\nI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be around and contribute in fun ways. But I‚Äôm happy with the new Haas.', 'I dont think you need to eulogize his tenure. Gunther has talked about this quite a bit and I dont think he believes he was doing a good job at the end. He said he would have left earlier in hindsight  not that he was trying to set something up he didnt get to see out.', ""Steiner is the right man to get a team up and running from nowhere. He deserves all the credit for that. Both in his RedBull days as in the Haas early days. \n\nOperating with minimum budget to build and motivate and attract the right motivated people willing to put in effort and growth. \n\nBut that is only a 3 year maximum and he needs to be replaced by a proper Team Principal. Matter of fact, he never should have been a Team Principal, he should be a 'Team Builder', and that for a duration of 3 years tops. \n\nMAYBE he can stay on for longer in an advisory role. \n\nApart from that, he really is not the right person. I think he gets too emotional too, and it blinds him and frustrates him, and that ventilated to the rest of the team. \n\nIt's telling Komatsu turned the team immediately around. Steiner MAY have build a base to operate from, but he lacks the skill or refinement to tap into everything. It's clear Komatsu is the better man there, and he has completely pulled everything out of the bag. \n\nI certainly did not expect that, but he did. So Kudos to Komatsu. \n\nI think Steiner also needs to stay far away from interviews and other related stuff. As a Team 'higher up' he was enjoyable to hear talk from time to time and be unleashed, but as a reporter or interviewer, he is just aggravating. I can imagine working for him is.......triggering."", ""That's really wrong, Haas made this thing of sacrificing 2020 and 2021 to focus on the 2022 car that was only good in like 5 races of that year.\n\nWhat Komatsu did was bringing many upgrades that actually work and trying to upgrade the car for each race instead of bringing only 1 or 2 upgrade per year and falling in standings every time at the second half of the season. It's much better to finish a solid P6 than having a good car at the start of the year and not making anything with it and letting everyone outdevelop you to focus on next year's car only to make the cycle repeat.\n\nKomatsu in one year solved the tyre issues that Haas was having since 2019 while Steiner was more interested in being a superstar in DTS."", ""Guenther was probably the only one who could have gotten the team started in the first place as the team structure was his idea and he knew all the right people to make it happen including sponsors. That said there were some issues with his leadership. The main concern was how distant he was from day to day engineering decisions as he primarily was based in the US rather than their hubs in the UK or Italy. He also had to much stuff on his plate as he handled everything management wise from the technical to the boring business details. Komatsu is closer to the engineering operations and has a narrower focus.\n\nAs for the narrative that he created a toxic team environment, it seams to be mostly based on a few DtS clips and some click bait headlines rather than direct sources from inside the team. Magnussen actually said in his book that Haas is the best team environment he has been in and that Guenther was the best boss he had in F1. In Renault he was routinely ignored by Cyril Abiteboul. Yeah Guenther could swear at you sometimes but you always knew exactly where you stood with him which gave a piece of mind that you don't have elsewhere where the bosses would butter you up in one moment and drop you like a hot potato the next.\n\nMagnussen had also criticized McLaren for having a big problem with blame culture and talked about how when Haas had the big pitstop failures in 2018 and the aero issues in 2018, no individual heads rolled for that. Guenther viewed it as organizational failure that was his responsibility to figure out.\n\nAll in all, it was time for him to go but a lot of the narrative that have been build around him isn't grounded in much and he deserves a better legacy than that"", ""You're assuming a lot of things here.\n\nPlus, they only adressed they're main issue under Komatsu's leadership: race pace and tyre deg (during this year preseason).\n\nYou're telling me that Steiner decided to spend the whole 2023 season without addressing a key issue on purpose? lmao\n\nHe was a week TP. His only merit was bringing an F1 team to the grid in 2016, in the way they operate, and before each team being worth billions.\n\nF1 is better without him."", ""Meh, give him credit for making a rational decision?

Due to the points structure of F1, Lando needs wins, so Max is incentivised to stop Lando winning above all else.', ""One thing people are not talking about is Lando pace change drastically in the second stint. The McLaren this season is like Mercedes last year. When the fuel goes down, they gain a great boost compare to the others. Even without Max dirty air, Sainz gap could've been still too great by the time Lando pace improve. Plus Ferrari would've known this and reacted with their tire strats or use Charles to undercut and mess with Lando. Could he have won? Yes. Would it be a sure thing? Absolutely not. Sainz is no slouch and this track isn't Cota when it comes to over taking. Max just made Ferrari life a whole lot easier."", 'It\'s what we said at the time as well, the worst thing for Norris\'s race was that he got stuck behind Max due to egregious divebomb by Max into T7, which not only lost him the position to Max but also let Charles through.\n\nThen Max just kept gradually falling more and more behind the Ferraris, and Lando was stuck there in the dirty air being unable to make a move (also due to inherent lack of straight line performance for Mclaren, Piastri was having trouble passing cars down the straight for a lot of the race as well).\n\nBy the time Max pitted, Lando was already almost 13 seconds off the lead, and that difference just increased over the next couple laps as well because his tyres were already dead being stuck behind Max for first 25 laps.\n\nIn fact in the second stint, Lando reduced the gap to Carlos all the way to 4.7 seconds by the end, and even hunted down and passed Charles on track. \n\nIf Lando is 2nd after Lap 10, and doesn\'t have Leclerc between him in Sainz for the rest of the race, I think it\'s quite possible he wins the race given his immense advantage during the hard stint. It wouldn\'t have been a guarantee because Sainz isn\'t the easiest to pass either, but by the end Lando was almost 5-7 tenths a lap faster than Ferraris on some laps. That coupled with DRS would have been huge.\n\nWhat should have been a 13 point swing ended up being a 10 point swing because of the Verstappen ""Tactics"".', 'I also wonder if this whole situation would not have occured if Sainz did not lock up his brakes also compacting the gap between VER and NOR', ""I said it when it happened with KMag and I'll say it here --  two outstanding 10-second penalties should convert to an immediate drive-through penalty.
