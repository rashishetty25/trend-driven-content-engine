1kv5ujm,Something‚Äôs off between Hamilton and Adami ‚Äì how long can this go on?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kv5ujm/somethings_off_between_hamilton_and_adami_how/,2025-05-25, Discussion,"There has been tension between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer Riccardo Adami since he joined Ferrari, and the Monaco GP seems to have brought it to the surface again.

**Let‚Äôs rewind.**  
In qualifying, Adami told Hamilton that Verstappen was *‚Äúon a push lap,‚Äù* then immediately said he was *‚Äúslowing down.‚Äù* In reality, Verstappen *was* pushing. Hamilton ended up impeding him and received a three-place grid drop.

**During the race (Lap 76 of 78):**  
Hamilton asked:

>‚ÄúAre they still ahead by a minute?‚Äù  
Adami replied:  
‚ÄúCharles on medium, McLaren on hard. Lapping ‚Äò16 very close to each other fighting.‚Äù  
Hamilton responded:  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not answering the question. It doesn‚Äôt really matter I guess. I‚Äôm just asking if I‚Äôm a minute behind or?‚Äù  
Adami then clarified:  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 48 seconds.‚Äù

**Post-race:**  
Hamilton asked quietly:

>‚ÄúAre you upset with me or something?‚Äù   
No response.

**Context matters.**  
This isn‚Äôt the first awkward moment between the two. In Melbourne, Hamilton told Adami *‚Äúleave it to me‚Äù* when he received repeated reminders about engine modes. In Miami, he criticised the team for delayed team orders with the sarcastic, *‚ÄúHave a tea break while you‚Äôre at it.‚Äù*

Hamilton has said publicly that there‚Äôs no issue and that these are normal race situations. But with repeated miscommunications and visible frustration, questions are beginning to surface.

Is this a case of two people still learning to work together, or is there a deeper mismatch in communication styles? Could Ferrari‚Äôs overall decision-making be contributing to the problem? Is it time for a change, or does this just need more time?

Curious to hear what others think.","[""Lewis's radio was painful all day long. Idk what was wrong with Adami today but he was even more awkward than usual. It was like listening to the Vettel days with him."", 'Look at vettel and Adami(he ordered Ricky sometimes instead of other way around), Carlos and Adami(las Vegas 2024) the miscommunication has been eternal at that position.\n\nEDIT:  \n""Wake up guys, come on!""  \n""Tell it to him in Spanish""  \n""What are these two guys doing? They are not unlapping themselves, they need togo.  \nAdami: ""They restart like this. Treat them as lapped cars.""  \n""Stay out, stay out. No, box, box, box, box!"" Sainz: ""Make up your mind, guys!"" (silverstone 22)  \n\xa0""No, not inters! I told you, straight to slicks!""

His response was pretty telling:\n\n> ‚ÄúThe information wasn‚Äôt exactly that clear. I didn‚Äôt really understand ‚Äòthis is our race.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt know what I was fighting for‚Ä¶ I used up my tires a lot in that moment, but I was so far away from \\[the cars ahead\\] anyway.‚Äù\n\nThis lines up with the broader pattern from Monaco and earlier races; unclear communication, vague timing, and a lack of shared understanding on what the actual goal is.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just about tone or chemistry between driver and engineer.

So in that sense it's equal for everyone.\n\nBut what happens with a red flag is that the pit exit is close as soon as the flag is thrown out, and no car is allowed to leave the pits. So imagine a safety car comes up halfway through the race. Of course all drivers who haven't pitted already dive into the pits. Then the safety car gets upgraded to a full red. Now everyone who just the pit exit line will have done 2 stops (1 under safety car, one under red) while everyone just behind that will only have done 1 stop (since their safety car stop didn't count since they didn't exit the pits yet) despite giving up track (and thus restart) position by going into the pits.\n\nI once again feel the need to propose a rule change I've been proposing for years: If a SC or VSC is upgraded to a red flag, the restart order should be the order the cars where in when the SC or VSC was first called, not the order they were in when the red flag came out. For Monaco and it's mandatory 2 stop rule you can add a rule that all drivers are allowed to change tyres under a red flag, but tyres used only when a VSC or VC was out do not count as having been used (so you can't get 2 tyre changes out of a single VC upgraded to red flag)."", 'Everybody is talking about pit stops during formation laps (which aren‚Äôt allowed), but what about the formation lap after a red flag?\n\nFor example: red flag on lap 1, and everyone changes tires during the red flag.

1kvlauj,Red Flag Rule in F1 and Monaco Specific Rules,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvlauj/red_flag_rule_in_f1_and_monaco_specific_rules/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"I think we can all agree that the Monaco experiment was a failure, but I think F1 went the wrong way all to together and what should have changed was what can happen during a red flag. It doesn't make sense to allow teams to change their tyres during a red flag and satisfy the mandatory running of two specifications of tyres during a race. At most, during a red flag, a team should only be able to change tyres to the same specification that they are already on. I cannot understand for the life of me why F1 doesn't implement that rule. It would essentially restart the race in a state that is as close as possible to what the race stopped at.

Looking at Monaco specifically, I think we can all agree that forcing pitstops only promotes the shenanigans that we saw, so why not try the other way and only have C6 tyres at the event with no mandatory pitstops. I think the pace difference between a 40 lap old C6 would be huge versus a brand new set. It would open the opportunity for teams to be inventive with strategy. I can understand the safety issue, but there is nothing stopping a team running the C6 for 76 laps currently, other than the fact it would be much slower to do it that way.

Just curious on what thoughts others have on this.

Are you going to force everyone to go back out on slicks because they can't change to wets during the red flag?   What if they pick up tire damage from the debris?   They can't be forced to go out on damaged tires, and if they were out on mediums and were planning to go medium/hard/hard like many teams did today, then they wouldn't be able to switch to the same tire type they had on if they don't have any.  \n\nI understand that everyone is trying their best to figure out how to make Monaco into an entertaining race, but the problem is the track and the cars being unable to pass.   No amount of tire or pit stop manipulation is going to help that, no matter what fantasy scenario you come up with."", "">At most, during a red flag, a team should only be able to change tyres to the same specification that they are already on.

It wasn't interesting to watch and somehow made Monaco even more boring to watch.

But what if drivers had to keep to a minimum lap time throughout each lap? Governed by some metric, which I'm sure wouldn't be too difficult to work out and enforce (drivers would have a delta to follow), which would eradicate this backing up nonsense. Monaco isn't going anywhere. It's too steeped in history and has far too much significance with Formula 1, so I do think it's a good idea to mandate some interesting rules to help improve the racing, even though on-track overtaking is at a minimum/non-existent.

Would there be a reason this couldn't realistically work?
