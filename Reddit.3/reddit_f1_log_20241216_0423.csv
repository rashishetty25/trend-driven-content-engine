How good do we think it really was? Specifically, do we think Schumacher could have won the world championship in it?\n\nBefore having watched the mid 90s retrospectively, I thought Ferrari spent the period on a gradual upward curve and that 1995 was really quite similar to 1994 for them, but that really wasn‚Äôt the case at all. \n\nThe 94 car was generally third fastest throughout the year thanks to having the best engine in the sport. It was good at anything resembling a power circuit, a legit frontrunner at the Hockenheims and Monzas of the world, but a bit lacking at handling-dependent circuits like Monaco, Catalunya and Hungary, where the McLaren was clearly a better package.\n\nIn 95 Ferrari scored the same number of wins and podiums and only two points more than in 94, but watching the races tells an entirely different story. The 95 Ferrari was competitive virtually everywhere and could feasibly have won six races rather than just one. Berger led before a botched pit stop at Imola, Alesi led very early when he broke down at Spa, Monza they had a 1-2 before the camera catastrophe, at the Nurburgring Alesi had a 40 second lead but couldn‚Äôt hold on in the closing laps and then at Suzuka Alesi was fighting Schumacher for the lead when he suffered mechanical failure.\n\nObviously there were nuances with all five of the above races that put the Ferrari in a position to win (Schumacher and Hill colliding at Monza and the team getting the strategy bang on at the Nurburgring just two examples) and it is also probably fair to say Alesi had his best year in 95 but still it was shocking to me to find out how good the 95 Ferrari was. Schumacher never looked anything like winning six races in the 96 car so that says a lot. What do we think? How good was the 95 Ferrari really?', 'Thought this was nice. The global Head of Communications for Mercedes-Benz (not the racing team) posted that he did a long chat with Lewis in Stuttgart, a Q&A at the museum, and he was great. A Merc F1 engineer, Jonathan Wilcox, then replied with this:\n\n>Very much the person he is Rob. He took 2 dozen of us surfing in Abi Dhabi. **He requested no social media from the team**, just wanted it to be him and us hanging out. Very simply he is just a genuine, nice guy, who will listen to and talk to anyone, about anything.', 'How do strategists train/get better outside of real race practice?', ""Does anyone know where to buy those vintage racing jackets with sponsors all over them.
