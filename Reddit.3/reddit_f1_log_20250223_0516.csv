Generally if you demonstrated that you had the pace to get alongside a rival, they would simply let you go. It was just too risky to pull the kind of defensive moves we see today with the cars of the time, so this kind of situation developed naturally.\n\nThings began to change in the mid 1980s with the arrival of a new generation of drivers who hadn\'t been around in F1 when death was an ever-present like in the 70s and early 80s. The older drivers still stuck to the old rules of engagement, while newer guys were generally a lot more aggressive both on attack and in defence. Keke Rosberg for example gave a fairly lengthy criticism of Nigel Mansell\'s defensive driving after the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix, dismissing it as ""not Formula 1 tactics"" and giving an example of how earlier in the race he had let Alain Prost past because Prost had been able to put his nose alongside and was clearly quicker.

Nowadays you just do it and hope the other driver sees it coming and takes evasive action. Otherwise, you have a crash, you get out and then thump the other guy on the helmet.

1ivn08y,Brazil 2006 could have been one of the best title deciders of all time,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ivn08y/brazil_2006_could_have_been_one_of_the_best_title/,2025-02-22, Discussion,"Just something that sprung to my mind: if Michael Schumacher didn‘t have his engine fail in him while leading Suzuka, Brazil 2006 would have been one the most dramatic title deciders ever. In reality, Alonso was 10 points ahead and everybody felt like it was a done deal that Alonso would clinch his second championship, as he only needed to score one point to secure it. Michael needed Alonso to not score and win himself. In this scenario, Michael and Alonso would head to Brazil 126 to 124. 2 points difference, all to play for. With this alternate scenario in mind, let‘s look at how things played out in Brazil 2006:

Qualifying: Michael suffered a fuel pump issue in Q3, leading to him not setting a lap time and thus starting from 10th. Alonso started from 4th.

Race: Michael has a good start and first lap. By the end of the SC, Michael is already up to 6th, behind Fisichella. Alonso is still 4th.  Michael tries to overtake Fisichella, but catches his front wing, puncturing one of Michael‘s tires. He has to go almost a complete lap back to the pits like that, falling down to last place in the process and almost losing a lap. Michael begins his comeback drive. On lap 10, Trulli retires, promoting Alonso to 3rd. Both Ferraris are the fastest cars in the field at this stage. In the first round of stops, Alonso jumps Raikkonen to get into 2nd place. By the halfway point, Michael is back in the top ten, having overtaken some cars on track and through pitstops. He carves through the field, overtaking Heidfeld and Barrichello. On lap 47 Michael pits for his one and only regular stop, coming out again in 8th. Alonso is in a secure 2nd place after all pit stops are completed. The recovery drive of Michael continues; 15 laps from the end he caught up to Fisichella again. On lap 62, Michael makes it stick and takes 5th from the Italian. Raikkonen ahead is slower than Michael two and three laps from the end, Michael pulls a great maneuver on Kimi to take 4th. Pushing on, Michael scores the fastest lap the following lap but unable to catch 3rd place Button. In the end, Massa comfortably wins in front of Alonso, Button finished on the podium and Michael takes 4th after one of his best recovery drives of his career. Just for perspective, he made up nearly a minute on his teammate Massa after the puncture (knowing that Massa didn‘t need to push for the whole race).

So what are the implications of this, if Suzuka went to Michael? 
Alonso wins the title by a single point, 132 to 131. Michael would have only needed to pass Button to win the championship as he would have won on countback in this scenario with two more wins than Alonso. Michael was only 4.5 seconds behind Button at the finish line. The collision between Michael and Fisichella would have been looked at very differently. In reality, it didn‘t matter too much in the end, Michael would have lost anyway as Alonso finished in the points. But in this scenario, it effectively decided the championship. Fisichella wasn‘t to blame for the collision, it simply was a racing incident, but if the stakes would have been that high, it surely would have sparked some controversy. All this would lead to such a dramatic storyline: the all-timer in his last race shows everyone that he still has a claim to be the best on the grid and would nearly take his 8th title. He comes oh so close after a masterful recovery drive but ultimately has to concede the title to the young gun who shows he can hold up in a straight fight with possibly the best driver of all time. Alonso shows great maturity and truly cements his status as the heir to Michael (as in reality). Interesting fact: had it played out that way, Ferrari would have taken the constructors title 209-203. 

Tl;dr: Just one variable, Michael Schumacher‘s engine blowing up in Suzuka, prevented Brazil 2006 from being one of the most dramatic title deciders ever. 

What do you think? How do you think Brazil 2006 would rank among the great title showdowns in F1 history if it took place under these altered circumstances?","[""I very much agree it would've been quite dramatic, but I really like the way it ended anyway. Alonso wins the title, Schumacher caps off his last title challenge with one of his best drives. All in all, a great battle between the two titans, and a well deserved win for Alonso. The lack of controversy makes it good in this case. 2006 is one of my fave seasons."", 'Schumacher would have won the race by a massive margin.\nHe recovered like 50s on Massa despite losing a lot of time in traffic.', 'Honestly even considering this alternative scenario Schumacher had in my opinion one of his top 5 drives he basically lost an entire lap through the puncture he got early on, and then managed to claw back all of that time with no help from a safety car and finish fourth only 6 seconds behind Alonso and in fact only 24 seconds off Massa.', 'I was there :) “the final battle”, but yes indeed it was done deal', 'Him finishing on P4, after almost losing a lap at the beginning of the race and without any help from safety car is pretty impressive.

Have there been any prolonged upticks in form similar to Grosjean's second half of 2013?

It honestly still boggles my mind that on a grid with drivers like Hamilton, Alonso, Rosberg and Raikkonen that Grosjean of all people consistently outdrove them all in the back half of 2013 and was seemingly the only guy who could actually challenge the mighty Red Bull/Seb for wins. Was the 2013 Lotus really strong in the back half of the year, or was Grosjean in the form of his life outperforming every driver on the grid not named -ettel?

Edit: I'm probably underselling the Lotus' performance in the second half. For the record I do think it was clearly the second strongest car after the break, but that it wasn't *that* much quicker than the Mercedes and the Ferrari.","[""Lotus was the second best car in both halves of the season. Raikkonen was clearly better in the first half when the tyre management was absolutely crucial.

Grosjean was driving decently in the 2nd half of the season and Raikkonen was underperforming a bit due to various issues (back injury, wasn't being paid). \n\nHowever, across 2013 overall, Grosjean was still the worst driver of the top teams."", '2013 Lotus was just a lot quicker than people originally thought. Same could be said as the 2012 lotus which I’m sure the engineers said that if Hamilton or Alonso were in, could’ve challenged for the WDC. \n\nThe car was crazy quick and great on the tyres, it was unfortunately under driven by essentially a rookie Grosjean and a Kimi who was no longer elite from 2007 and who came from a 2 year break. \n\nCoupled with the fact that Kimi was destroyed by Alonso in 2014 and comfortably beaten by Vettel from 15-18 and it’s clear he was not a top driver. Grosjean himself was never amazingly quicker than Magnussen and I’d put them both in the solid midfield category.', ""It was great but it felt like in the second half or the vibes was at the time that pretty much everyone had waved the white flag and full focus was on 2014 especially when Seb was winning everything it didn't even feel like the drivers you mentioned were even giving it 100% imo."", ""That Lotus was very fast in the later stages.

He just had a purple patch and the car suited him + other teams were not as competitive.', ""Lotus brought a longer wheelbase car for Monza which Raikkonen didn't seem to get on as well with. That coincided with the car being very competitive at that time (not at Monza though).

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.
