But the Qatar track has no character whatsoever, I've never been able to discern the layout as it all looks exactly the same. It is a sea of flat tarmac, floodlights, and high-speed corners going into medium-speed corners. No identifiable corners, no landmarks for reference. 

Miami, a fairly universally disliked track, has distinct parts and buildings like the stadium and intersection for reference, so you can tell where in the track the rivers are. Bahrain, a similarly situated track with a barrage of floodlights in the middle of a desert, has the large tower by the first corner and goes up & down a hill for some kind of reference point. China has the gigantic pit building great first corner complex and a thrilling final few corners. Abu Dhabi, known for it's lack of character, is fairly nicely split into thirds with the high speed first sector, double-straight, and 90° corners galore.

Is this just me? Are there any other tracks that have a distinct lack of character that I am missing?

1h3uknj,Is FIA deliberately collecting penalty points against Max to justify a DSQ in next season? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3uknj/is_fia_deliberately_collecting_penalty_points/,2024-12-01, Discussion,"2 of the points don't expire till June 2025.

FIA is not beating the wrong passport allegations anytime soon. Corrupted to the core.

The 1980s and 1990s, however, were quite different. For instance, not many would have known about Ayrton Senna\'s beautiful friendship with Keith Sutton, had the latter not come out to shed light on it recently.\nAlthough Sutton never made it to the pinnacle of motorsports, he too, vied for a career in racing at the same time as Senna. Senna became successful, whereas Sutton started working as the Sao-Paolo native\'s personal photographer for a short period of time when he was in the lower ranks of open wheel racing (between 1981 and 1984).\nSenna first met Sutton when he took some pictures of him in his junior Formula car. Impressed, he asked Sutton to join his team and the two began working together, resulting in many prominent personalities getting to know the Brazilian driver, thanks to the clicks.\nEventually, Senna would meet the right people who would help accelerate his F1 dream, which not only did he realize, but also conquered. By winning three World Championships, he became one of the best and most beloved drivers of all time.\nSutton\'s role in shaping his career won\'t be forgotten and his time with Senna will be immortalized in the upcoming Netflix miniseries about the late great legend.\nSutton took to his own Instagram account to share his feelings about their friendship before the premiere. He wrote, ""Working closely with Ayrton during the early years of his racing career remains one of the most special periods of my life. Capturing the moments of a legend in the making was an honor I\'ll never forget.""', 'Very educational, I didn’t know Alain Prost was the actual devil responsible for famine and genocide.', 'It was a B-minus for me! \n\nPositives: cinematography, cast (Prost’s perm was chef’s kiss)\n\nNegatives: too much drama with Senna-Prost and Senna-FIA', 'The racing scenes were pretty repetitive and so were the Brazilian celebration scenes at the end of some episodes.
