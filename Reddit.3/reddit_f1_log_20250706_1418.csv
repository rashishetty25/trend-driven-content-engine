It would not make sense for Bottas or Alpine to take on another driver just for the sake of trying, but rather they need to find a better and more permanent solution for the second car. It goes without saying that Bottas is also looking further ahead.\n\n‚ÄòA short stint somewhere... does that help in any way?

**Image 1: Constructor Dominance**

This first graphic shows which constructor was the fastest in each mini-sector of the Silverstone circuit.

* **Red Bull Racing:** Unsurprisingly, they were absolutely dominant on the straights. The dark blue lines show their top-speed advantage on the Hangar and Wellington straights.
* **McLaren:** The papaya orange shows up strong in the high-speed cornering sections, owning large chunks of the Maggotts, Becketts, and Chapel complex.

  
**Image 2: Track Dominance - Piastri vs. Verstappen**

This second graphic drills down into the individual performances of Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen, showing who was faster and where.

* It's a classic trade-off: Verstappen leverages the Red Bull's incredible straight-line speed, while Piastri's McLaren appears to have the edge in cornering performance.

1lsihas,It just feels like the 'first to the apex' rule is gonna ruin what should be an amazing GP on Sunday,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lsihas/it_just_feels_like_the_first_to_the_apex_rule_is/,2025-07-05, Discussion,"Normally, Sunday's GP should be an absolute thriller. It's super tight at the front. Ferrari look competitive. The McLarens are fighting for the top of the championship and Verstappen has stuck it on pole with the lap of the year so far.

But I can't help but fear that we're gonna have a race that will be dominated by controversy and aggro over the 'first to the apex' rule in the racing guidelines.

First of all, the opening sector is almost tailor made to create controversy at the start:

- If you're ahead at the apex at Abbey, push them wide at the exit
- If you're ahead at the apex of Village, push them wide at the exit
- If you get pushed wide at Village or find yourself on the outside, lunge up the inside into The Loop and then push them wide at the exit

Then you have the second sector, with Brooklands, Luffield or even Copse all overtaking opportunities where its easy to just run someone off who's on your outside.

And that's all just the opening lap of the race.

We've already seen on Saturday multiple incidents in F3 and F2 where drivers were allowed to just drive rivals off the track at the exits of corners because they 'weren't ahead at the apex'. Gabriele Mini even got a ten second penalty for 'causing a collision' because he happened to be to the outside of Alex Dunne at The Loop.

The stewards weren't wrong, either. They applied the rules according to the driving guidelines they are advised by.

It just feels like an inevitability that at some point on Sunday, we're gonna have someone getting shoved wide at the exit of a corner, suffer damage and then get hit with a penalty because that's what the rules say is okay now. I fear its going to be the big talking point that comes out of the race, because we've already seen it be a major talking point from the junior series already.

Obviously this is the rule the drivers wanted. I'm not blaming the FIA or the stewards, really. I just feel like we're gonna have what should be an amazing race spoiled by the current racing rules being what they are, because a defending driver now has no obligation to leave space these days.","[""These rules have always been shit and remain to be.\n\nNo other series in the world just let's people drive other cars off the track.\n\nWhy is the world's premier single seater series promoting such shit driving?"", 'As an F1 journalist once said.

You are on the outside it‚Äôs your problem.', ""'These days' lol. People have been getting shoved wide on the outside for F1's entire history. It's always been the norm. The vast majority of drivers in every open wheel series believe the inside car has the priority and you try a move on the outside at your own peril."", 'Just enjoy the race.', ""You've got this wrong, it's not even ahead at the apex, it's alongside the mirror at the apex if you're attacking on the inside. What makes this even worse is that (this is new in 2025) the defender has the responsibility for crashes or going wide, not the attacker.

1lsr6so,A Couple Questions From a New Viewer,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lsr6so/a_couple_questions_from_a_new_viewer/,2025-07-06, Discussion,"Recently got into watching F1 and had a few questions about the dynamic of the competition for a chance to learn about some implied truths I might be missing out on.

\-Is it just a given that some teams will have no chance at podium finish all year and that they're more focused on finishing as close as they can to top 10? What I'm picking up from the dialogue is that some cars just outclass others and no matter how good of a driver you are you're not beating the regular top finishers.

\-Leads me to my second question, is it just an known objective fact by everyone involved that McClaren has the best car right now? I don't know anything about the tech behind these cars. Is it normal to expect them to continue to be dominating or are the modifications teams make between races a big enough game changer for it to be back and forth.

\-Lastly, if the answers to the above are yes, question to you guys as fans but how do you stay engaged throughout the season if you're a fan of a backmarker team or driver? Not that that stops me from watching but it seems like it'd be disappointing to not get much coverage during a race of specific drivers if I'm a fan of drivers who are always finishing outside of top 10 or someone who might DNF early.

edit: forgot to say thank you for taking your time to read this at the end of post so doing it now. appreciate all the insightful comments!","[""* Yes. Other than the top 3-4 teams, others almost never make it onto the podium, barring external factors like rain or other yellow/red flags.\n* Yes, it is known. In any other seasons, other teams would still try to improve their cars to match or beat McLaren. However, since next year brings new regulations, most teams are shifting their focus there and are not spending more technical and financial resources on this year's car.\n* Not really. The truth is, more often than not, it's actually more fun following mid and lower-level teams from a championship perspective; they're usually fighting for a single point difference. And that can mean millions of dollars in price money."", 'Others will probably give you better answers but I‚Äôll try to answer all 3 of these:\n\n1. Pretty much yes, for an Alpine or Sauber or Haas to finish on the podium this season it would require a minor miracle (although Alpine got one in Brazil last year and managed to finish with a double podium, but that was about as hectic a race as you‚Äôll ever see in F1). Even if the slowest car on the grid was only 0.5 seconds per lap behind the fastest car, over the course of a 60 lap race that‚Äôs half a minute in time and literal miles behind. So small gaps in pace can become insurmountable over the course of a race distance.\n\n2. McLaren currently have the best car by a large margin, although there are some tracks that suit other cars better (such as Mercedes in Canada). They will probably continue dominating, but it is possible that other teams will upgrade their cars enough to close the gap or even surpass McLaren. We saw this last year when Red Bull dominated the first 8ish races then had the 3rd fastest car by the end of the season because McLaren and Ferrari made better upgrades.\n\n3. Like in many sports, if you‚Äôre a fan of a team/player that simply isn‚Äôt capable of competing for championships, you take the small wins. A double points finish for Haas is probably about as exciting for their fans as a double podium is for McLaren fans. What‚Äôs been nice about this season is that every team has been able to score points on several different occasions, as opposed to years past when teams like Sauber will go all year without even sniffing the top 10.', ""1) yes, mostly though last year alpine was probably the worst on average but did manage a 2nd and 3rd in a rain race with a lucky strategy and good wet pace\n\n2) on average McLaren does,  but there's been a few times they missed setup and legit may not have been faster. They can upgrade the cars throughout the season and the pecking order can change. Last season redbull was way ahead for 5 or 6 races then for the entire rest of the season McLaren was faster.\n\n\nFollow up q\n\nYou pick a driver or two to watch and see how they do how the strategy fall in place where they are. The entire show isn't who wins. F1 historically isn't very race exciting. It's the engineering and raw speed."", ""\\> Is it normal to expect them to continue to be dominating\n\nYes, but the summer break can be a huge turning point. it won't, but it can be.\n\n\\> how do you stay engaged throughout the season if you're a fan of a backmarker team or driver?\n\nDue to the nature of the sport, we basically have several races going on at the same time, so the midfield battles are as valid as top ones, and more often than not they are more fierce. Like multiclass in GT, but everyone is still a competitor. It also opens up a possibility to a genuine miracle (Alpine in Brazil 2024), and even if not, it's still very cool to see what really good drivers can do with the cards dealt to them."", 'Enough people have answered your first two so I don‚Äôt need to repeat. But for the enjoyment part, I‚Äôm an Oscar fan (being an Aussie) so it‚Äôs obviously easy following the pointy end of the drivers championship.\xa0\n\nIn saying that, what drew me to F1 recently was that I love following the storylines up and down the grid. Such as:\n\n-Watching with interest how Lewis does at Ferrari\n\n-The interactions between rookies & veterans this season has been really nice to watch\n\n-Antonelli‚Äôs first pole and podium\n\n-Bortoleto getting his first point last week & the on track battle with Alonso.\xa0\n\n-Following Williams‚Äô progress to see if they can get back to competing, it‚Äôs been a rollercoaster so far.\xa0\n\n-Watching the dumpster fire that is currently Alpine and seeing where they go from here etc.\n\nAs much as I want Oscar to win it all, I‚Äôm a fan of the sport and appreciating every race weekend for what it is and whatever storylines it throws up each week.', ""First and foremost, it's an engineering competition."", 'I guess what makes this interesting as a post is you‚Äôre trying to get at what makes F1 interesting during a race.\n\nWhen it comes to on track action the level of interest ranks from most to least as follows: crashes/spins, overtaking, retirements, pit stops, lone cars lapping.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that I want crashes to happen but they are the most sensational part of racing, and they usually have an impact on the outcome of a race. If you talk about races from the past, crashes are often key to them being memorable.\n\nYour issue is if the driver you support is lapping on their own and down the leaderboard, then you‚Äôre not going to see them much. But isn‚Äôt it somewhat similar to a team ball sport where your player isn‚Äôt the key player so they‚Äôre playing support and not really in the action most of the time?\n\nI guess you‚Äôre lamenting that once a driver is in a team for the season, your fate is sealed as to what you can expect due to the car‚Äôs performance?\n\nAnd then I stop and wonder that even if I‚Äôm a fan of a driver, do I delight in just watching them lapping. There is a way I do but that‚Äôs not usually in the context of a race, it‚Äôs more for analysis afterwards.\xa0\n\nThe hard part of F1 is being able to understand the athleticism and skill as it‚Äôs the opposite of showy, like a great dunk or a bicycle kick, drivers are usually trying to be as clean as possible, more like a train. So just seeing a driver lapping on their own doesn‚Äôt do much for me during a race as what I want to see during a race is things that impact the outcome.\n\nThis is when you get into tyre/pit strategies and following that for all the drivers. So I don‚Äôt support one driver and vary my hopes from race to race,\xa0caring about them achieving their own goals.\n\nProbably motorsport‚Äôs biggest problem is that most of the time the most exciting and outcome variable moment of a race is the start. It‚Äôs the time that a crash is most likely and the chance for the most overtakes. So it‚Äôs often downhill from there for excitement and you‚Äôre relying on a big crash to cause a red flag for a standing restart or two drivers that are tight at the lead on the last lap to exceed the race start for tension.', 'I‚Äôve been watching since 1984.  There have always been dominate teams and cars.  Watch long enough and dynasties will fall and others will rise.  Mid fielders like Williams have stories to tell from an era gone by, and they may still have a new winning era in front of them.  The current dominate team was becoming an afterthought not long ago, and we may soon see the end of the Red Bull era(s).  You battle for 10th until you can battle for 5th, then you‚Äôre knocking on the door again.', 'My take on it:\n\n1. Some teams do a better job than others. Driver can make a difference (see Verstappen vs his teammates), but the performance of the car has massive impact. Big regulation changes can sometimes change the order. And many teams, that have no chance to catch up, will switch to the next season and hope that they get the next car right.\n2. Pretty much yes. Not on every track, but in the grand scheme - Yes.\n3. On Sky for example, you can follow one driver, if you want. Overall, i think that it is reductive to focus only at the top 3. Other teams and drivers can still do a good job, relative to their ranking. And on occasion, luck can have a big impact.']",64,60,0.83,64,55,55,2,1,0.0,2
1lslt5e,I Created a List of Top 150 Essential Sports Racing Movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lslt5e/i_created_a_list_of_top_150_essential_sports/,2025-07-05, Featured,"This one‚Äôs for all the Formula racing fans and for anyone who recently watched that new F1 2025 film (the one starring Brad Pitt by Apple) that re-introduced Formula racing to a whole new audience around the world. If that movie left you craving for more high-speed drama, legendary rivalries, and behind-the-scenes stories, welcome to the community - you‚Äôre in the right place!

**Link to Megathread for F1 Movie here:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk8rn0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk8rn0/)

So now that you‚Äôve seen *F1*, you might be wondering: *What should I watch next?* To get inspired & motivated or just want to know more about Auto racing sports and what it is about, basically the history and all the reasons why it has the most amazing audience globally!

I started building this list with the idea of rounding up **all the movies directly related to Formula 1**. But then I thought, why stop there? So I added films and docs about Formula 2, Formula E, and other motorsport gems too. And, as it turns out, there actually aren‚Äôt *that* many dramatic feature films that focus solely on F1, most of the really good stuff is in incredible documentaries and behind-the-scenes specials - leaving with only 20 to 30 titles - which is also amazing, but mostly its interview, documentary films..

So, this collection isn‚Äôt just about flashy F1 cars. It‚Äôs a hand-picked mix of movies and docs that truly capture the spirit of **auto racing - the rivalries, the heartbreaks, and the rush of living life at 200 mph.** No filler, no random car cameos just for show, only films and stories that deserve to be here. I tried my best not to just add & fill up movies that just had scenes of luxury looking F1 cars that are mostly in the background.

Do people believe that racing should carry on unless conditions are exceptionally wet i.e torrential thunderstorm, monsoon like conditions?

Personally, I'd like to see racing continue in most circumstances because it allows the ""wet weather specialists"" to shine, giving them an opportunity to level the playing field against cars they may not be able to compete with in more ideal weather conditions.

I understand the safety aspect and the reasoning but surely you drive to the conditions and capabilities of your car. Exceed the cars abilities and that is just the same as doing so in the dry?

There is no safe way to drive, unless you want to see a race at walking pace"", 'The spray the cars throw up makes it impossible to drive safely for anyone except the race leader', ""The FIA screwed the F3 race by delaying the start five minutes. When will we learn it's safer to start cars before rain sets in? Once it's started raining or we get a race stoppage getting going again is too hard.\n\n\nEdit to add: You have to give them a chance to get temperature and a feeling for the car as it gets wetter. Delaying the start makes the situation less safe when conditions are forecast to deteriorate."", ""The primary issue isn't grip but visibility.\n\nGranted after a certain point even the grip is basically gone and aquaplaning becomes inevitable.
