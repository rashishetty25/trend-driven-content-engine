However, in the Stewards’ assessment, no driver was wholly or predominantly to blame for that collision. Car 55 contributed to the incident by taking the risk to drive close to, and on the outside of, Car 30 when Car 55 had no right to room there and there was a real possibility that, if the collision had not occurred where it did, Car 55 would run out of track at the exit and/or a collision would have occurred at the exit for which the Driver of Car 55 would likely be predominantly if not wholly to blame. \n\n30.

1nfw8ta,Shark skin paint for aero benefits,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nfw8ta/shark_skin_paint_for_aero_benefits/,2025-09-13, Technical,"Hi all,
I'm a long time f1 fan, and enjoy learning about the technical side of things.

Which leads me to my question, in nature sharks have developed a sandpaper like texture to their skin which actually creates small vortices and reduces drag.
This has been replicated in high tech swimming costumes and even boat hulls.

Would this work with air rather than water?

I don't know if the principles of fluid dynamics translate to aero...

Imagine having localized areas of the car that reduce drag directing air to where it can be a benefit like the floor and wings etc...

Anyway, would love any input from anybody familiar with what I'm talking about
","['Shark skin textures reduce surface drag. \n\nSurface drag is not the primary limitation in F1’s aerodynamic performance. \n\nAnd the shark skin texture is not used in boat hulls.

There’s a startup trying to sell cling film that claims to prevent bio fouling but basically all the early adopters have had to rip it off their hulls because it fouls up quickly.', 'In case it helps, you can also try r/F1Technical', ""Air is a fluid. Principles generally translate, but the scale and severity is different. Simple as that.\n\nWater generally gets treated as incompressible where air is compressible, so there are some differences there. But what you're talking about is vortex generators which very much exist in aero applications and are already used where relevant on F1 cars."", 'The company I work for produces a foil that is put on airplanes to reduce fuel consumption. The surface of that foil is inspired by shark skin. I guess the F1 teams would have this foil already if it was useful to them.', ""> Imagine having localized areas of the car that reduce drag directing air to where it can be a benefit like the floor and wings etc...\n\nThe front of the car (e.g. front wing and leading edge and edges of the floor, etc.) do this to a very large extent.

Since the early 90s F1 teams have been very consciously trying to reduce the amount of weight that paint adds to the car (to the extremes of having the largely black clad machines of recent years) and having a thick textured layer would absolutely work against that. I can't imagine it'd be great for working with boundary attachment layers either, making conditioning the flow a nightmare."", ""I think it would interrupt the air which in swimming increases buoyancy, which lift or upsetting the air would be a pure negative.\n\nI remember one of the big problems with the suits was the buoyancy, not necessarily the drag.\n\nA flat clean surface means, you know exactly what the air is doing, any sort of pitted surface creates havoc and wouldn't be able to properly be mapped from front to rear."", ""Actually a very interesting idea, made me think of the time I think Mythbusters made a car with golf ball dimples in it.\n\nUnfortunately don't know enough about aerodynamics to know if it would be helpful in certain areas of the car, I'm sure if it could help they'd probably have tried something at some point.\n\nThe things F1 teams have tried that we don't know about has to be wild.
