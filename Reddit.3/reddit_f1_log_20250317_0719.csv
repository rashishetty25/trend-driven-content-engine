I was sitting in the grandstand at the final corner, just one corner after where Lando and Oscar went off and only about 100 metres away, and there were barely even a couple drops of rain when they went off, and it took probably about 2 more minutes before it started to properly rain. The rain that took Lando and Oscar off was extremely localised.', '**Q: Alright, very well done to you. Max, let\'s come to you now. You ran Lando very close at the end. What were you thinking? Just one more lap?**\n\nMV: No, not so much, to be honest. I just tried my best, tried to be close, tried to put a bit of pressure on, but it\'s very hard to pass around here. There was only one line. Even if I had gotten a run into whatever, Turn 9, you have to go onto the wet part, so you can\'t really do a lot. But at least it was close. It looked good on TV.\n \n**Q: Can we talk a lot more about the rain? Tell us about the call to stay out one more lap?**\n\nMV: Two more laps! We were on the Medium, and of course, you never know how that\'s going to work out. But I thought it was quite a sensible call with 15, 16, or 20 laps to go when the Safety Car came out. Then, of course, it started to rain. I saw them go off in front of me, kept it clean, and when I saw Oscar rejoining, I thought, ""Well, let\'s stay out,"" because it was only those three corners. The rest was still dry. When I continued, basically, the first two sectors were fine ‚Äì it was just if I could survive the final sector. I think that lap I did was okay. If there wasn\'t much more rain coming, I thought it could work. You also have to factor in that even if they caught me on an Inter, they‚Äôd have to box again for slicks, if it‚Äôs not going to rain anymore. So, it was fine. I thought, ""Yeah, we\'ll do another lap,"" but then, unfortunately, on that lap, the first sector was still okay-ish, but then in Sector 2, it started to rain a bit too much and we had to box. But in hindsight, it wouldn\'t have mattered. If I‚Äôd boxed with Lando, it would have been P2. If I‚Äôd boxed the next lap, it would have been P2. And the lap that I did box, I was also P2. So, we tried something else‚Äîit might have worked. In a way, it didn‚Äôt work, but we didn‚Äôt lose any position, so it‚Äôs fine.\n \n**Q: Max, when you think where you and the team were at the start of the weekend on Friday after practice, how satisfying is this P2?**\n\nMV: I think it\'s good compared to the teams behind us. But if you look at the first stint, we were quite a bit off. As soon as the tyres started to overheat, we had no chance. McLaren just took off. So, we still have a lot of work to do to fight for a win. But yeah, I‚Äôm happy that we are second here. It\'s basically one place better than we should have been. And it\'s 18 more points than I had last year at this race.', ""Very fair. I had a feeling that the best he could manage and clutch was P2 anyway, no matter what they had tried to do. I forgot that the overheating of those tyres had played a part in scaling back the overall car performance. His race management was fantastic. Verstappen, as a driver in tricky conditions and a competitor to the front, should not be dismissed easily in the slightest. \n\nI am pretty interested in seeing how Verstappen can extract the most out of the car this season. He seems to have a mighty knack for it, and he can give the frontrunners a run for their money. This season is Norris' to lose so if Verstappen manages to bring the fight to McLaren, it is going to be peak"", 'The thing is that if Verstappen had pitted the lap after (instead of two laps after), he could have overtaken Norris. In the first half of his outlap, Norris was struggling to keep up with Lawson, so he was losing time.', 'It was the reverse Sochi 2021 I feel, where back then Lewis pitted immediately when things went south but Lando decided to stick out and then faced the consequences.\n\nWhile in this case Max didn‚Äôt pay as much of a consequence, Lando made the earliest call to pit in before anybody else and turned out to have made the right decision. As that race was one of the biggest heartbreaks since I started watching F1, this was a very, very rewarding moment for me. Your favorite driver is learning from the mistake he‚Äôs made 4 years ago! Sochi 2021 died so Melbourne 2025 could live.', ""Staying out was the right call IMO, do the opposite of what Lando did. There was a high chance of a shunt in the in-between conditions, it just happened one lap too late for Max. If Lawson/Bortoleto's crashes were one lap sooner, Max gets a cheap safety car stop and comes out in P1.\n\nPeople galaxy brain the hindsight of these decisions all the time. Hell, even in Brazil last year, Lando and George pitting for new tires was technically the right call on the basis of probability, and it literally took Colapinto binning it during a safety car for Max + the alpines' gamble to stay out to pay off, and binning it during a safety car even in the rain is still statistically quite rare, even though anecdotally we've seen it at the past two wet races now.\n\nSometimes you have to just accept that these decisions are mostly probability based gambles from the lead driver, and that it's also acceptable for the non-lead driver to do the opposite thing even it's statistically less likely to work out for them, because it's their best chance of overtaking the leader."", 'Possibly, but that‚Äôs when you only look at Lando. At that point, they still thought that he might be able to stay out on slicks, so if he pitted, he would lose out to the Ferrari‚Äôs. In hindsight, this wasn‚Äôt the case, but still. \n\nAnd that is assuming he actually had a big enough gap. I remember seeing Norris 21 seconds behind as the biggest gap. Would that have been enough?', 'Correction, Lewis wanted to stay out but Mercedes forced him to pit while McLaren was talking in riddles to Lando.', ""Lando was bugging his engineer to pit early instead of late as soon as he found out that the rain would be Class 3. He even reiterated the plan before the safety car restart. Then, maybe about half a lap before he went off, Lando said that they should pit because he was starting to struggle a bit. You could see the extremely localized spits of rain on his onboard camera. It's almost good that he went off in sector 3 and could pit immediately because McLaren really didn't want to pit too early and that forced everyone's hand and made their decision for them.\n\nI agree with you. I was getting Sochi flashbacks, and I wasn't even the one in the car!

I know it‚Äôs busy, pls don‚Äôt crucify me. I think that time interval and tire strategy are two parts of the same story, so I added a tire progress bar lol. I also added number of laps on the current tire, and changed the time to green if within 1 second of the driver ahead (as suggested in the comments of my last post). 


Pic 2:

For the ‚Äúit‚Äôs too cluttered imo‚Äù folks, I removed the progress bar and just added each driver‚Äôs previous tires as little dots :) Tbh I prefer it to pic 1. 

Would love any other suggestions of ways to depict both past tires and tire life (ideally without cluttering it all up). 


Pic 3: 

Bonus update to my sector times post. Changed the sectors to vertical bars which pop out like the pit square. I muuuch prefer this to my original one, so thanks for all the suggestions and discussion. 

I also switched back to the original purple color. Long live purple, down with usurple. #fuckusurple #allmyhomieshateusurple



Loved all the comments and feedback in the last post, so would welcome more of the same. Haha even if it‚Äôs just to say you bloody hate it.

1jcfw84,Things we (re)learnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jcfw84/things_we_relearnt/,2025-03-16, Discussion,"1. McLaren: well-balanced car. The Drivers gotta step-up and minimize mistakes.


2. Max: pure talent, man! A class driver ‚Äîand Lando knows it. One mistake, and Max will be right there, ready to snatch away points from you. Especially when it rains.


3. Russell: He drives.


4. Norris vs Piastri is loading. Rivalry within house is gonna be fun for us, headache for Brown and opportunities for Max.


5. Hamilton is learning, so is Ferrari.


6. Williams and Vowles are cooking. Hope it doesn't end up like Aston Martin in 2023.


7. For me, the back-markers are still unclear. Ferrari, despite fighting with Williams and Alpine, will soon catch up to be among the front-runners or at least the lower front. Mercedes is in the upper midfield, and maybe Williams too. Alpine and the rest, including Aston Martin, seem more like mid to lower midfield teams. Sauber and Haas will probably eventually end up being the tail of the pack, but for now, I think they can still catch up to RB, Alpine, and Aston Martin. I'm not convinced yet on who will be the lapped cars.


8. Rookies are adapting among big shots. They'll deliver soon.


Edit: some additional points I should've added + elaborating few.

9. Lando deserved that win‚Äîhe drove brilliantly, and praising Max or discussing mistakes doesn‚Äôt take away from that. But we all know how even a small mistake can cost him dearly. I agree with Crofty that he could have suffered the same fate as Oscar with that mistake, and no, that mistake wasn‚Äôt small‚Äîc‚Äômon, guys. As for Max, it‚Äôs clear he can deliver even without being in a rocket ship.

10. Mercedes vs Ferrari: Many pointed out that Mercedes was faster than Ferrari, and I agree. However, Ferrari has the advantage of a seasoned (legendary) driver. Both Kimi and Lewis will need some time to settle in, and as I mentioned elsewhere, opinions might shift as the weeks and races progress. That said, we‚Äôre not quite at the point where we need to discuss Ferrari‚Äôs No. 2 driver‚Äîlol.

11. Piastri: Some people don‚Äôt see him as ready for a championship battle yet, but I believe he has the potential. In my opinion, he can deliver.

12. Kimi: He‚Äôs getting the hang of the car. I‚Äôd love to see him and Ferrari battle in the coming days.

13. Yuki: He had a great race‚Äîuntil he didn‚Äôt. We‚Äôll often hear him and Liam in the same sentence this year.","['George:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1ihmdnn40pe1.jpeg?width=783&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69b5fb3771009894d07285ddb89c9785c5f2fb65', ""McLaren >>> Red Bull > Mercedes >> Ferrari for me. \n\nStrategy aside, Ferrari's pace wasn't great either day."", 'We have to give Lando credit for his restarts today.

Here‚Äôs how every rookie fared in their first race

Kimi Antonelli went from 16th on the grid to 4th after charging through the field despite the wet conditions on the track and nearly crashing into the wall at one point. He was probably the most impressive of the 6.

Liam Lawson had a pretty atrocious weekend overall, not many laps in any of the sessions and he didn‚Äôt switch to inters sooner as the conditions worsened and thus lost control, spun and crashed into the wall at turn 2

Oliver Bearman managed to finish the race, but he was nowhere all weekend long and finished last out of the race finishers, plus he also had his crashes in practice 1 and 3 and couldn‚Äôt take part in qualifying and thus qualified dead last.

Jack Doohan had a great Saturday if I‚Äôm going to be honest here, he could‚Äôve qualified higher if it wasn‚Äôt for the yellow flag caused by Hamilton spinning. Made a rookie mistake on lap 1, but I thought there was the opportunity for points had he not crashed.

Gabriel Bortoleto honestly was under the radar for most of the weekend, he was certainly someone to look out for given that he made Q2 and out qualified Nico Hulkenberg, I think his crash was definitely partly his fault but the suspension also failed so he would‚Äôve retired anyway even if he was able to keep it from hitting the wall.

Isack Hadjar, oh boy, I was personally looking forward to his race the most given he qualified 11th, but his first ‚Äúrace‚Äù lasted one corner before he lost it and crashed into the wall. It was honestly really heart breaking for me given his performance on Saturday, I really was hoping for some points. W to Anthony Hamilton for comforting him after his crash though.

With all that being said, we shouldn‚Äôt jump to an immediate conclusion on how they‚Äôre going to perform for the rest of the season since this is kind of an unfair comparison since the conditions were so much more difficult for the drivers compared to season openers in previous years. What I‚Äôm asking is what do you think will happen in a general context(their future in F1, will they be dropped?, are they going to improve or worsen, how the rest of the season could play out for them etc.) to each of the 6 rookies based on their performances during this race weekend(not just the race)?","['I think nobody is making a big deal of one race', 'Nothing will change based on today.

Except Doohan, he's screwed."", ""It means rain is hard to navigate without experience in a 1,000 hp monster with no TC or ABS, that's it."", 'Utterly meaningless. Alonso binned it too', ""With people like Carlos and Fernando crashing out, and probably everyone else having some level of 'save' needed to keep going- most memorably both McLarens, but also Max and Charles I remember- I don't think teams will be too harsh on their rookies who crashed.\n\nDoohan and Lawson it probably hurts the most. Doohan because there's evidence that his seat was already insecure, and Lawson because he already had eleven races and four sprints under his belt. But, I think the crash is honestly not as bad for him as the bad quali and not gaining a bunch of places in the race before his crash.\n\nIt reflects great on Kimi. Of course, Mercedes have put a ton of money into Kimi. They've given him 30-something GPs of races distance now in private F1 car testing, and I'm sure he did that in many different weathers, so they prepared him very well. Preparation helps, and this wasn't an investment other teams chose to make into their rookies. Maybe more teams will consider it in the future. I don't want to downplay Kimi's natural talent, but all his life he's been the highest tester in every car he's been in- I don't know about karting, but probably then too. Testing helps. Doohan and Bearman had somewhat large testing programs, but not like that, though they did one and 3 GPs before now too. Testing of previous cars has actually been limited this year for the first time ever, and I legit wonder if it was because of Antonelli. It's still pretty generous on non-active drivers though.\n\nBearman, it reflects well on him that he didn't crash in the race, however, he did have a very expensive crash in practice, and we believe he's gone through a gearbox already, and he didn't get to do quali because of damage from his crashes. So... the race was definitely a great ending to a rough weekend for him. Ollie can definitely move past this, like all the other rookies can move past it, though I'm a little worried for Jack and Liam."", ""This is probably the worst kind of race to make a debut in, so I wouldn't overreact. Way too early to make any judgement. If Bearman crashes twice again in China in the dry, then we can start talking.""]",12,68,0.58,12,64,64,-1,6,-0.040000000000000036,-1

Doesn‚Äôt it make more sense to drive on the damp surface of the track on inters?

1jcut88,Why was it that Piastri had to be in the reverse gear for the car to get going.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jcut88/why_was_it_that_piastri_had_to_be_in_the_reverse/,2025-03-16, Technical,"Under normal circumstances where it‚Äôs not raining, I suppose it‚Äôd be easier to get the car back on track after running into the grass ?
