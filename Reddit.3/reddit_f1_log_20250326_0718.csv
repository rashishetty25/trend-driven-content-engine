Some big names with great primes that come to mind for me are Ricciardo and Massa. Granted, I haven't been watching as far back as their primes so I wouldn't know, but it truly feels like we have another uncrowned Champion in the making. 

Charles might have had mistakes earlier in his career but it really feels like he ironed them out last season and performs every race week. It's only early in his career but its possible we'll never see him lift the WDC Trophy despite being apparently more deserving than other names like Russel, Norris, or Piastri.

And, yes, since 2020, before that, actually, we had a lot of time that we are teammates, driving in the same categories.”\n\n(via: GPblog)\n\nThey are used to competing with each other and have been rivals for many years. Lawson’s been more defensive in his recent comments about deserving the seat “he’s had his time, now it’s my time” and saying he beat Yuki in the junior series, he has no sympathy for Yuki getting passed over but I think that’s just due to the pressure and him trying to be all like i’m not here to feel bad for others/make friends i’m here to win etc.', 'They were actually good friends a while back. Red Bull puts their juniors up in the same block of flats in Milton Keynes, so you’d see them on stream together (same with Vips before his gamer moment). \n\nI think a lot of the shit talk is media saying half of a quote to them mixed in with the obvious conflict over both wanting that seat. \n\nTsunoda was asked whether he’s ready to take the seat. He said 100%. Reasonable question, reasonable answer. He was asked if he’d do better than Lawson in the RB21 in China, he said he didn’t drive in it in China so he doesn’t know but he didn’t feel he was too far off Max in his Abu Dhabi test.\n\nLawson was told ‘Yuki is saying he’s ready to take your seat’ and Lawson has hit back saying ‘Well actually I beat him in juniors and F1 so he can say what I want’.

Lawson was 2nd fastes in AUS and 9th in China.

In AUS it was on the same lap as Max, lando, oscar and Yuki... so similar conditions and weight of car

In China his lap time was on lap 32, so a much heavier car, but possibly better tyre conditions?

Pictues below for everyone.

I mean lawson has shown on glimpses he is very fast... consistency sure not quite there, but I really do feel that car is going to screw Yuki...

Thougths?

OK seems im getting shredded in the comments... im not saying hes as good as the good drivers, im just saying he obviously has some talent, and maybe RB are being too harsh on him after two races...
