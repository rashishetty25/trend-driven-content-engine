There is no softening of the energy split. However, a back door for changes remains open.**\n\n> It was the defining Formula 1 topic in recent weeks. Several manufacturers wanted to overturn the new engine regulations for 2026. After F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali himself took up the V10 engine with synthetic fuel as an alternative for the future and FIA President Mohammed bin Sulayem jumped on the bandwagon, Red Bull and Ferrari wanted to grab the opportunity.\n\n> The two heavyweights of the premier class fought against the new Power Unit, which will come to Formula 1 in 2026. The electrical component is increasing sharply: almost half of the power is supposed to be delivered by the battery, the rest comes from the V6 turbo. Officially, the teams expressed safety concerns at the FIA. The longer recuperation phases could lead to large speed differences and create dangerous situations.\n\n> Other voices from the paddock, however, saw a different motivation for the advances. Ferrari and Red Bull are in arrears with the development of the new drive for 2026. It is rumored that Mercedes is on track to deliver the best power unit. Similar to 2014. At that time, the engine forge in Brixworth had best designed the change to the complicated drives of the current generation and the Formula 1 under several years in the choke.\n\n> **No energy split changes planned.**\nThe first damper was given to the opponents of the new regulations at the Bahrain Grand Prix. At a meeting of all engine manufacturers, Ferrari and Red Bull refused to reinstall the desired V10 naturally aspirated engine in the cars as soon as possible. Newcomers Audi, returnees Honda and also Mercedes would not have been able to develop a different drive at such short notice.\n\n> But the competition did not give up. They wanted to relax the energy split management. On Thursday (24.4.), however, Ferrari and Red Bull, which will develop their own combustion engine for the next season and are supported by Ford on the electric side, suffered the next defeat. The Formula 1 Commission rejected the proposal to change the distribution between the combustion engine and the battery. The plan was to reduce the 350 kW on the electric side to 200 kW in the race. The rest of the power should have been provided by the 1.6-liter V6 turbo engine.\n\n> Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was enraged by the advances of his opponents in the run-up to the meeting. ""I actually wanted to protect ourselves and not comment on it at all. But that\'s really a joke. Just a week ago we had a meeting about the engines. And now these things are back on the agenda.” Now the Austrian can take a deep breath. The new regulations are given a chance for the time being.\n\n> **Back door remains open.**\nThe F1 Commission discussed fundamental improvements to the energy management strategy for 2026, as well as measures to address financial problems that drive-prower manufacturers may face if either performance losses or significant reliability problems occur in 2026. All these topics will be discussed in more detail by the specialists in the relevant advisory committees.""\n\n> With this decision, the premier class has taken precautions. If there are large differences in performance on the racetrack next year, there would be opportunities to make adjustments in the sense of the sport. If manufacturers are significantly behind, they are likely to exceed the budget cap for the engines and receive more test bench hours.', 'If Honda ends up being faster than all of them it would be the funniest thing ever.

It’s a 5.4 km layout with 22 corners, and apparently features the world’s longest banked corner. There’s a mix of high-speed sections and some more technical bits. Lap time is around 1:34.

That reconfiguration hasn’t worked and they now need to get something that does work.\n\nLet not forget Hamilton is declining as a driver. Ferrari signing Hamilton cannot have been for truly competitive regions. They would have kept Carlos if that was the case.\n\nHamilton is as much about long term Ferrari ambassadorial roles as much as anything else.\n\nLeclerc is number 1. If Ferrari had a car that was competitive vs Mclaren there might be a stronger conversation here, but Leclerc isn’t doing what Max is doing.\n\nIts Mclaren vs Max and then Merc vs Ferrari.', 'What’s interesting is that before the season starts many people include media claim Lewis will beat Charles and his Merc form dip was bc team sabotage. Now five races on, it’s people overacting, we shouldn’t expect him to outperform Charles 🤫', 'It’s been 5 races. Blimey.\n\nThis same outlet on their podcast pre season said summer break is the real measure of anyone joining a new team and there will be peaks and troughs until then. \n\nI don’t think he’ll ever be as fast as Leclerc, it’s clear these ground effect cars removed his advantage of what made him so fast, and he’s 40… but my guess is after summer break we settle in to 2ish tenths gap in qualy and similar race paces.\n\nI think Charles is as good as anyone on the grid bar old Dutchy, and it’s his team at his physical peak. I’ll just enjoy 2/3 years of a victory lap in the red car and the odd race win for Lewis.\n\nMark Hughes has always seemed very negative about Lewis, on the podcast it’s like he can never quite give him a genuine compliment.', ""I think it's a bit dramatic to say after just 5 races that this is untenable, and also that liberty media are going to be concerned by this!\n\nClearly it hasn't been the dream start, but it's such a long season and a lot of learning to be done for Lewis.\n\nIf anything I think him being so down after Jeddah and basically saying it's going to be bad all year, really hasn't helped him and has given ammunition to write so many articles like this. But this is always how Lewis has been, really feeling the emotions, positive or negative post race.\n\nUltimately Lewis is 40, he's not at his 2018/2019 peak anymore, but he also isn't washed. Time will tell if he can reach the level again to compete for a championship, but it's way too dramatic to say this is a Ricciardo situation after 5 races."", ""I would highly recommend people listen to yesterday's podcast with Mark, Ed and Scott.

When tyres changed from bridgestone to high deg pirelli, everyone said Lewis was fucked because it wouldn't work with his aggressiveness yet he adapted and still performed at the top, becoming a tyre whisperer even. Even when he started as a rookie, people were reporting that he could easily handle cars that were so unpredictable and unstable even world champions like raikkonen or hakkinen would have complained ferociously about it.\n\nHamilton achieve what he achieved in great part because like so many greats before him, like alonso, like schumi, he could adapt to any changes thrown his way across the years.\n\nSo it's so weird to me how quick everyone is to believe that his struggles are explained simply because he can't adapt to the ferrari or even the ground effect cars. I can understand Hamilton saying it because f1 drivers clearly aren't wired to accept they could ever hit their limits and are always quick to find excuse to keep their confidence intact. \n\nBut from my pov, it feels instead like Hamilton, finally, finally declined.""]",0,204,0.45,0,165,165,0,3,0.0,0
