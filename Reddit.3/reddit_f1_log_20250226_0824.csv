1ixvvux,How much do teams benefit from not releasing their real car during preseason testing/car reveal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ixvvux/how_much_do_teams_benefit_from_not_releasing/,2025-02-25, Discussion,"Only been following F1 since 2020 and testing since 2022.

Teams like Ferrari and McLaren release 60% of their cars and keep some stuff for the testing and 1st race. Whereas Red Bull just shows either the show car or the previous years car.

How much of the design philosophy of the Ferrari car(just an example) can be examined by their rivals considering they aren't seeing the entire car/How much does Red Bull delay their rivals from copying them by not releasing their car?

Really interested to know the answer.","[""When it's just a livery reveal, teams won't show their real car. When it comes to actual driving on track, all teams use their real cars."", ""The less lead time you give your rivals to be able to copy something novel the better. Could something small or huge but it all adds up in the end. It's pretty easy to copy certain things. Like Racing Point and the pink Mercedes. To answer the question, it can vary how much benefit there is but there's likely always some.\xa0"", '> Really interested to know the answer.\n\nI don\'t think there will ever be an exact answer really... other than to say there\'s a benefit and it\'s ""something"".\n\nThis is a sport of tenths of seconds. Even if it delays their rivals by 1 week on a concept its worth it.\n\n\nYou could point to the double diffuser of 2009 and see how long it took Red Bull to introduce updates based on that concept? Brawn GP won 6/7 of the first races and didn\'t win after that, but I can\'t pinpoint exactly when Red Bull made changes... but that\'s an example of ""hey that\'s a concept we need to integrate"".\n\nOr the f-duct... everyone copied that eventually once it was known.\n\nI think if you want a quantifiable answer you\'ll need to look up some ground breaking innovations (like the two I mentioned) and read the news, and look at the season updates to kind of get an idea of how long it takes another team to copy that.\n\nbut also like... some are easy, some are hard, some require fundamental car changes (e.g. merc zero side pods to some side pods) that involve multiple parts.', ""There's no real incentive for any team to show their actual car for upcoming season during pre-season testing, apart from preventing teams to copy each other's concepts and make them ready by the first GP weekend. Which is why you will mostly see teams testing out individual parts like front wing, rear wing, side aero curtains, etc. using flow-vis material. Some teams however will reveal their full car on the final day if it requires them to run programs based on actual chassis, as well as gain popularity on social media if it's a radical design compared to previous year (which can be tricky to copy in short amount of time, if at all)."", 'The later you release/drive your car, the more time you have to develop and produce the car.', 'Publicity.', 'Aerodynamics play a big part such as wing designs, also shows how teams can interpret the rules differently to make small gains which all add up. There are loads of examples of this with rear wings. \n\nThe later you show the car the longer it takes for other teams to copy and catch up. \n\nI know the Merc sidepods flopped massively but if they had worked then Merc would have had a big advantage over rivals for many races.', 'Could also be the case that the new parts aren‚Äôt all ready. The car revealed later might just be late', ""Think about race season as an ever-sliding scale. If someone were to fully reveal a car at the normal car reveal time... Car reveals etc. are \\~4 weeks prior to the first race of the season.\n\nNow think about the races at the end of the season. If a team has something notable at the very beginning that you might have missed, you're giving yourself an additional 4 weeks to work it out and make a solution for your car.\n\nWhen you consider the fact that we dont have any idea who's actually going to win the season, it makes it all the more important to keep developments hidden for as long as feasibly possible.\n\nThe less time people have to see a car and potentially work out what's going on, the lower likelihood they have in replicating the success.\n\nHaving potentially 4 weeks of time to be able to assess a car and everything going on while youre in 'down time' (which is still very active), could work out as an enormous advantage at the tail end of the season.\n\nCost cap obviously makes this harder, and teams typically have their upgrade paths mapped for the season before it even starts, but coming with someone new that works too early could cause teams to divert.""]",6,26,0.56,6,124,124,2,0,0.020000000000000018,2
