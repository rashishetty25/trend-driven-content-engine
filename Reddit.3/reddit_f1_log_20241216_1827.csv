For Carlos to be a Ferrari driver for 4 years and have such good moments and wins with them is incredible and no one in Ferrari had any doubts that he‚Äôs been amazing at that team. 

They all love him, they never made him feel like a second driver, they always let him race Charles and were happy for him when he won races, in his last year they gave him the same upgrades as Charles and never prioritized one of them, they let him test with Williams in Abu Dhabi, they gave him one of the best send offs I‚Äôve seen, even tomorrow he‚Äôs going to Fiorano and both him and his dad are gonna do a final lap in the F1-75 around the factory.

1hfkn9i,2024 World Championship Standings using the previously proposed points down to 12th place system,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hfkn9i/2024_world_championship_standings_using_the/,2024-12-16, Statistics,"So this year there was a F1 points system change proposal for 2025 that was rejected as it was voted against by all teams in the F1 Comission meeting this past July. This proposed points sytem would have extended points down to 12th place finish, with no alteration to the sprint format. The changes would alter the points given from 8th place down, with the new proposal to also give points to 11th and 12th that would see a 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 breakdown.

Now, in theory, I'm also a defender of the current breakdown of points that only rewards the top 10. With that said, given the new entry of the 11th team (Cadillac) now approved for 2026 and with the prospect of a potential 12th entry in the coming 3 to 5 years, and with reliability being better then in previous decades (yes, we don't know how reliable the cars will be in 26' yet, so this might change), I think revisiting this idea again soon could be in the cards.

So, here are the alternative Drivers and Constructors standings for 2024 using this system: 

https://preview.redd.it/gsvncpck387e1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=05921731dca5a702ee7334ef5c7beb7d4bd403c1

As you can see, this system mainly changes things in a significant way in the midfield, with the drivers/constructors at the top and at the bottom not benefitting as much (I know this is obvious, but just thought I'd mention it). For instance, Max would score the exact same amount of points, as he didn't finish a single time in the 8th to 12th range, and most other drivers in the top positions wouldn't add many points to their tally either.

Some of the biggest gainers for this season would be H√ºlkenberg (+27 points), Alonso (+21), Magnussen & Gasly (+15), Albon (+14) and Tsunoda (+13). Also Bottas and Sargeant would have scored points! (Bottas for P11 in Lusail, Sargeant got a P11 in Silverstone). These results would also put Haas above Alpine in the WCC.

So, do you guys think there is any merit to this points system? Or do you prefer the system in place currently (fastest laps points will stop being awarded from 2025 onwards as a side note)? ","[""It's interesting to think about how Alpine vs Haas shook out in the constructors this year. Haas was way more consistent throughout the year, but Alpine was more volatile and had a couple of very high finishes that put them over the top. Hard to say which should be rewarded more, but it's something worth thinking about."", ""If the goal is to actually assess which driver/teams had the better season, obvs the further down you score the better. I don't know if that is the goal though or if the priority should be creating more unique/sacred moments by making points more exclusionary."", ""I think especially since there's about to be 2 more cars on the grid, it makes sense to give out points to 2 more cars."", 'Logan with 2 points Yay!', 'Give points to halve the cars: 10x points for 20 cars, 11x points for 22 cars, 12x points for 24 cars, etc.', 'Nico loved those P11s', 'Still Zhou beats Bottas lol', 'Literally half the field gets points just for finishing the race. This is already too much imo. Maybe if there were 26 cars, first 12 getting points would be fine, but with any less cars, it would just be weird, to give points to that high percentage of the grid, just for finishing the race.', 'The problem with the Alpine strategy is that it relies on a lot of luck. Imagine the chaotic race in Brazil where Alpine finished 2/3 actually happened in Abu Dhabi with Hulk starting on the second row.\n\nI think it‚Äôs unfortunate that a team that maximized all of its potential is thwarted by a team that got extremely lucky in one race.']",33,44,0.84,33,42,42,14,25,0.029999999999999916,14

Would it be better to buy tickets for all three days, or just for the race itself?

How‚Äôs the general admission experience? Is it worth upgrading to a grandstand seat, or is GA good enough?

I think gates open at 8am, but you should aim to arrive before then, otherwise your chances of finding a good place to sit are slim.\n\n* I don't know how you plan to get there, but the roads will be rammed and the Park & Ride is a bad idea. Parking at the circuit is expensive but worth it unless you like the idea of spending 4 hours waiting in a queue for the bus after the race (maybe it'll be better next year, but that's what happened to us this year)\n\n* In terms of seating, if you go GA, bring camping chairs. You don't want to be sat on wet grass if it rains. We sat on the grass area by the Vale chicane and had a good view of the action, and they have a massive broadcast screen as well. It also meant we were able to get on the track to see the podium since the only entrance they open is there.\n\n* Grandstand seats will be a better experience, but for me personally it's not worth the massive cost.

1hf99hh,Way too early Vegas 2025 ticket strategy. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hf99hh/way_too_early_vegas_2025_ticket_strategy/,2024-12-16, Discussion,"Hey fans ... 

Kudos to F1 for doing a great job marketing to the teenagers living in my house.

We are headed to the race in 2025 .

Should we buy our tickets nice and early?  (This is my preference.)

Or will we find better deals if we wait and buy tickets closer to race day ?

Get nervous about rolling the dice and prefer to book something in advance.

My plan is to buy good tickets for race day only rather than a three day pass .

I would complete rookie in this category and I'm looking for any suggestions you might have .","['My advice is to go to a different race! Since you‚Äôre asking about waiting for a deal, I can assume you care about getting good value for money. Vegas is probably the worst race on the calendar in this regard. If overseas travel is off the table, then look at COTA. I‚Äôm not sure about Montreal prices, but they can‚Äôt be worse than Vegas or Miami. I‚Äôve been to Hockenheim, COTA twice, and Suzuka. Suzuka was the best experience.', ""There's no 'better deals' in Vegas. :)   \nIt's more than twice as expensive as Monaco.  \n\n\nMatter of fact, you could probably fly to Monaco for the whole weekend and still end up saving money compared to attending the Vegas GP."", 'I got tickets literally the Thursday of this year and no, nothing cheaper.  Even the 44% off they did in the West Harmon zone was still $1500 for a three day ticket for 2 of us.', 'Hold', 'Montreal grandstand tickets are half the price of COTA, ish. 665 vs 1200. I also did Catalunya last year, ‚Ç¨360.', 'Vegas pricing for tickets wasn‚Äôt so bad, it‚Äôs comparable to cota and if you want a taste of hospitality it‚Äôs actually much cheaper than any U.S. based race.\n\nVegas prices will probably drop again, and again closer to the race.', 'Monaco I‚Äôm not sure but one of the other European races definitely', 'There are, they kept reducing ticket prices the closer it got to the race. It only ""sold out"" a couple of hours before the race. I put ""sold out"" in quotes cuz I doubt that it actually sold out, that\'s just marketing.\n\nA month before the race they reduced ticket prices from $1,200 for a 3-day ticket, including food & non-alcoholic drinks, to $672. By race week, that $672 ticket price was even lower.', 'I had suite tickets for $1700, it‚Äôs not cheaper than Monaco by any means']",0,12,0.29,0,11,11,0,0,0.05999999999999997,0
1hf3lta,"Was the old F1 as ""racist"" as Netflix depicts it in the new ""Senna"" series?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hf3lta/was_the_old_f1_as_racist_as_netflix_depicts_it_in/,2024-12-15, Discussion,"I've recently been watching the new Netflix series about Ayrton Senna and cannot get the thought out of my head about Netflix depicting 80's and 90's F1 mistreating non European/Western drivers with some subtle signs such as when they just did regulation changes in the 1990 Japanese just (apparently) because, as if it was to benefit Prost because he's European instead of Senna who isn't, or the 1991 Brazilian GP where Balestre says ""The Brazilian public should learn about hospitality and courtesy, we are bringin you the world championship""

Is it just me overthinking, did it actually happen or is it a Netflix thing?

Because we know how Netflix tends to be sometimes","[""I wouldn't say it was racist. South American drivers were allways within the top names of the sport. \n\nDuring the Senna-Prost clash there were many politics and national interests involved in the background... and the same stuff is creeping in nowadays with MBS and shifting of the powers to the middle eastern figures behind the curtain."", ""Any favoritism towards Prost from FIA's side was solely because Balestre and Prost were compatriots and buddies, nothing more. Of course there's always been prejudice in F1, but the dear saint Ayrton was never a victim of it. If anything, he got away with some absolutely ridiculous things. Not that the Netflix series would delve into that, Senna was perfect and anyone who didn't kiss the ground he walked on was automatically a piece of shit according to that same series."", ""This happens even now. It's quite easy to find xenophobic comments when Bortoleto won F2 against Hadjar from the French. And how can we forget our esteemed personality Helmut Marko and his comments about Perez. Or Hamilton's entire history in this sport. This happens all the time, Netflix might even not told all the racist and xenophobic things that might have happened in the 80's and 90s"", ""F1 and motorsport would still be visibly racist if McLaren hadn't stumbled upon Lewis in 1995. All it takes is a cursory glance at the state of motorsports discussion boards from the pre-Liberty media era to see what people really think."", ""During Formula 1's early years, as in many other business areas, there was a certain disdain for non-Western Europeans. With most teams originating from either the U.K. or Italy, strong rivalries also emerged between their respective nationalities. Like football, Formula 1 was centered around Europe, where everyone (bar Pel√©) aspired to compete to showcase their talent.\n\nHowever, F1 did open its doors to several non-European drivers, many of whom spoke the international language of money. Most notably, Juan Manuel Fangio from Argentina, who beat every rival to claim five drivers' titles fair and square. Another Argentine, Jos√© Froil√°n Gonz√°lez, gave Ferrari their first F1 victory. Even Prince Bira, a member of the Thai royal family, competed during this era.\n\nEven today, certain favoritism toward British drivers can still be felt in many media outlets, so much so that Fernando Alonso once remarked he has ‚Äúthe wrong passport.‚Äù Nevertheless, we have come a long way from the complicated days of the 20th century, and drivers from all nationalities are now far more widely accepted."", ""Atleast they didn't mistake Mexicans for South Americans I think.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s2pszwek577e1.png?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daa36f0f02740de7ba5475c438da6babbd0e9679"", ""There is some xenophobia nowadays I'm sure, but actual racism itself is probably a lot stronger.\n\nHamilton's report from a couple years back is pretty damning"", 'Before Senna, Fangio was by far the most famous F1 driver - an actual household name. I don‚Äôt think there was any general disrespect for South American (or Australian or New Zealand) drivers.', ""Yes, it was. Not just in the 80's and 90's. In the early 2000's and 2010's Lewis Hamilton was still faced with racism and F1 was quick to abandon the anti-racism messagin he initiated when he was no longer the reigning world champion.\n\nLmao at the downvotes.
