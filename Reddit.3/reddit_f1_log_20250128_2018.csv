Did he make along the way wrong decisions or other factors played role in his current situation? We all (well, most of us) agree that Carlos is not as good as Max, but he is not a bad driver, he is actually a very good one and he is consistent in scoring points.

I do find 2026 a strange year to go to AM. If there aren't any external factors playing a big part, a switch after 2026 would make more sense given Max can then make a choice based on performance on track rather than a educative guess.\n\nAnd I don't see why from AM's side they wouldn't want to do this as well - as long as they get Max. Fernando's contract apparently runs out after '26, so they could just have Fernando and Lance for '26."", 'Fernando and Liam as teammates?\xa0\n\n\nYes please lol', ""Genuinely, if this happens, it would out-silly every other silly season that I've seen.\n\nThis just can't be real."", 'I hope if Alonso comes to rebull, lawson is still here....', ""It's be typical Fernando luck to leave Aston right before they produce a championship-calibre rocketship just to toddle around the midfield in a mediocre Red Bull car.

Man, I don't know what deal with the devil monkey paw shit Fernando did to get those first two titles, but I bet he didn't think it'd still haunting him 20 years later.
