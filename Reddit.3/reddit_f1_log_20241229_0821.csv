I watched these live back in the day but I stopped in 2011 and only restarted this year so the differences are glaring, and I don't mean the look of the cars. 

What would happen today if this occurred? Michael Schumacher had a rear shunt and spin on lap 1 turn 1, ending up on the gravel, losing his front wing on the process. Schumacher's engine was still going and he then moved his car out of the gravel and onto the racing line, then stopped. Brundle reckoned Schumacher did that move and turned his engine off there to try and force a red flag (it didn't work, was just a safety car).

There are so many more rules for safety and sportsmanship reasons now. Could/would a driver try something like that today? ","[""These days they have access to telemetry and team radio from the cars. They would be able to see if there was an issue with the car or an instruction from the team. If they thought something unsportsmanlike occurred they could give a penalty.\n\nPotentially a driver could do something like this and accept the penalty because they'd benefit enough. Were it the final race and a safety car would freeze the running order preventing a championship rival getting the points needed. It would work, but in an era of social media could effectively be career ending."", ""I'm pretty sure what you're describing happened during a time when there was a rule where if there was a red flag during lap 1, then any driver caught up in a crash can jump into the spare car in the garage and take the restart (2000 Austrian GP I'm guessing?)\n\nThere have been rules to scrap the use of spare cars, and I'm pretty sure that once you leave a car somewhere where the marshals have to touch the car, you can't have your team repair it and rejoin anyway, whether under a neutralised race, or red flagged. One will have to get their car back to the pit garage under their own power to get it back to working condition."", 'Schumi only did that because the rules back then said that if the red flag came out on the first lap, the initial start would essentially be discarded and all drivers who crashed out could get back in their spare cars and take the restart from their original grid positions, basically a free lifeline.\xa0\n\nSpare cars were banned in 2006-2007 iirc, so those examples of guys running down the pitlane and jumping into the spare cars are a thing of the past.

1hop2bk,"Does someone know if its legal for example, for Ferrari F1 drivers to race in a third HYPERCAR at the 24h of Le Mans WEC round? Not in 2025 since it collides with Canadian GP but yeah :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hop2bk/does_someone_know_if_its_legal_for_example_for/,2024-12-29, Discussion,"Hi, first and foremost: its a bit unrelated but I feel it can be considered “Discussion” but I didnt find an “off topic” flair so my bad if I went too much off but yeah. And also excuse me if there are any typos or redundancies, english is not my first language and im still learning lol… BUT MY POINT IS:

I feel 2024 is an amazing year for Ferrari. Monaco and Monza for Charles, home GP of the team and himself, also Carlos farewell with two wins, and winning the 24 Hours of LeMans for the second year in a row with the car that didn’t win last year (in F1 terms like if in 2008 Massa was champion after Kimi in 2007).

I was thinking about the 70s that F1 drivers used to pop up at LeMans. I imagine each of the three drivers per car has a ranking, (like for example a “gentleman driver” needs to hypothetically be paired with Leclerc and Hamiltom).

But I was thinking that, hypothetically because it collides with the Canadian GP, BUT, if I was at Ferrari, as in the brand itself not the F1 or WEC team but actually Ferrari as a whole, and if it was legal (that that is my doubt)… and of course if it didn’t clash with an F1 round unlike this year, I would field a third car with Charles, Lewis and Arthur Leclerc.

I think that it would generate a phenomenon similar to MotoGP fans that tuned in to watch Rossi, I don’t think it would be disrespectful to the other to HYPERCARS because if it was me I would focus more on the actual championship than on the PR stunt… BUT if lets say HAM and LECx2 were to inbetween rounds contest the 24 Hours of Le Mans round in WEC, is that legal? If not why not.

And if it isnt I would field a third car with Arthur, Schwartzmann and Kimi Raikkonen. Like yeah, you read correctly but Kimi is, and sadly, the only living Ferrari legend that can drive. I feel that if in 2013 Ferrari had a LeMans prototype to try to add to Schumis Ferrari CV a 24h of Le Mans win would’ve been attractive, and I feel a one off Le Mans chance for a Ferrari mid 2025 when he will still be the last Ferrari F1 champ is a nice little thank you + farewell. He went out well with that COTA W in 2018 but we remember Abu Dhabi 2021 for the VER-HAM drama (and rightly so) and when we remember it was the last GP for Kimi at least I go “damnnn thats crazy”.

So yeah, does someone here knows if its legal or not? I remember Porsche in 2015 fielded a third car only for that race.

Fun Fact: Lando Norris and Fernando Alonso raced as teammates in the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2018. They finished P13 in their class :)

Thx in advance.
