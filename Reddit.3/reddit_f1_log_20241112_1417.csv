I'll only put the relevant part because the full context might make this more complicated and I am very bad with words.

- Say it's a 50 lap race.
- P1-P7 have lapped P8 down and are on the final lap.
- P1 suffers some failure/crashes/whatever and won't cross the chequered flag.

What we agree on:    
- P1 still classifies because they finished more than 90% of the race.

What we disagree on:    
- I say P1 becomes P7 because they already finished Lap 49 ahead of the other cars and so is ahead of P8.    
- He says P1 becomes last of the Lap 49 finishers because it's a DNF. *(In our scenario, P8-P11 are one lap down, so P1 becomes P11 according to him.)*

I still don't understand his reasoning for the DNF part but I am pretty sure I'm right on this one. However, I don't know how to properly put it into words so maybe someone better at explaining things can help me out.

# The Formation Lap

This week, we’re forgoing the typical *Last Week in Formula 1* preamble in favour of sharing a spot of news, dear reader and fellow racing fan.

There’s changes coming over the next week to *Last Week in Formula 1*, which include a new name and livery, along with the launch of a new weekly feature.

As this humble racing newsletter expands in scope, *Last Week in Formula 1* isn’t broad enough to capture all that will be published, hence the change.

Mums the word for now, but **the announcement will be landing in your inbox on Wednesday November 13th, bright and early at 6:30am PST.**

*(*[*Which is all the more reason to subscribe on Substack if you haven’t already.*](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/)*)*

Until then, you have the latest edition of *Last Week in Formula 1’s* mutterings and musings, twistings and turnings, tidbits and playtime to enjoy below.

*(If you missed last week’s issue,* [*you can find that one here.*](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-october-28-november-3-2024)*)*

**Now, for the uninitiated:** 

If you’re a rookie ‘round these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly feature compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world into one easy, breezy, beautiful read.

Every fun fact, story, and piece of news has been sourced from posts in r/formula1 (AKA: Formula 1’s publicly accessible online paddock).

Given this is The Internet, I suggest taking everything you read with a grain of salt. However, over many years of following the subreddit, there’s far more truth than lies posted—and much of the news comes from reputable sources.

Lastly, like the cars we enjoy watching so much, *Last Week in Formula 1* and   *nope, not this time either!* are in a constant state of development. Any feedback you have on what’s covered, the format, or anything I may have missed is welcome in the comments.

Now let’s hit the track…

\~\~\~

# Trackside Stats

***Behold:***

* [The laps lead leaderboard in 2024.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjex8o/f1_laps_led_in_2024/)
* [The WDC state of play with 3 rounds remaining.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjk67a/f1_team_standings_after_2124_rounds/)
* [The WCC state of play with 3 rounds left](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1go45o8/f1_2023_vs_2024_constructor_standings_after_21/) (and compared to last year).

Proving that Maxi’s 4th WDC title has never *really* been in doubt or danger, despite Red Bull’s travails and McLaren’s rise, [Max has *still* scored more points than Lando since Miami](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gla8v2/max_vs_lando/), when McLaren’s season began gaining steam.

A whopping [*nine* of Max’s laps around Interlagos were good enough to claim Fastest Lap honours…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjk9iv/f1_nine_of_max33verstappens_lap_times_in_brazil/) His best being over a second quicker than Lando’s best.

Owing to… I’m not sure what, a mixed bag of causes I’m sure… [Pierre Gasly has achieved 3 out 5 of his F1 podiums when starting from 10th or worse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjv0tv/fun_fact_pierre_gasly_has_achieved_3_out_of_his_5/)

For those following the riveting Black vs. Yellow T-Cam 2024 Championship, [here are the updated standings after Round 21](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl4hjc/black_vs_yellow_tcam_2024_championship_standings/) went down in São Paulo.

Alas… [Only 184 laps remain in this season for the ages.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gne0sw/f1_the_racing_has_been_fantastic_this_year_and_we/) Enjoy them all!

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

Is this news if hardly anyone is surprised? In an officially official statement, [Sauberaudi have confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkth3f/stake_f1_team_kick_sauber_team_statement/) that [Valtteri Bottas](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkyowb/valtteri_bottas_after_three_years_at_stakef1team/) and Zhou [Guanyu](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gktmna/zhou_guanyu_personal_statement/) will be leaving the team after this season, [paving the way for Nico Hulkenberg and… ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkuhzn/f1_the_2025_sauber_driver_lineup/)

[Gabriel Bortoleto, who has been *confirmed* as a Sauberaudi driver for 2025. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gkuhzn/f1_the_2025_sauber_driver_lineup/)

*(I’m pleased as punch about this development, as I’ve been super impressed with Young Gabriel over his last two feeder series seasons, and am eager to see what he can do in Formula 1—even if he is driving a tractor initially).*

As for Sauberaudi’s departing drivers, Zhou’s future is an uncertain mystery, while [Valtteri seems headed for a reserve/development role at Mercedes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl6o1y/mercedes_hinting_a_bottas_return_probably_as_a/)

In a poignant marking of this ending era at Sauberaudi, [former team strategist (under their Alfa Romeo guise) Ruth Buscombe Divey penned this *adorable* goodbye post honouring her time with Valtteri and Zhou.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gli4f3/thank_you_for_every_undercut_every_overcut_every/)

Meanwhile, [folks around the paddock seem rather confident that the Argentine surprise, Franco Colapinto, will be on the grid next year](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gl3o1t/campeonesnet_mar%C3%ADa_catarineu_when_asked_to_rate/), somehow.

And if The Race is reporting that Franco is firmly [“In Red Bull Frame As Perez Replacement Option”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glmqc0/colapinto_in_red_bull_frame_as_perez_replacement/) for 2025 there’s *definitely* fire amongst all the smoke.

I don’t want to put too much stock in this, because Flavio Briatore mostly, but *apparently* Flavio has changed his mind on Jack Doohan sitting in their car next year and [he’s giving Franco the “I want you” stare from across the room.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glzwer/la_gazzetta_dello_sport_flavio_briatore_has/)

In other driver news… [Shots have been fired from the portside cannons at FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem, courtesy of the Grand Prix Drivers Association (GDPA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glni62/grandprixdriversassociation_on_instagram_gpda/). Rightfully so, they’re fed up with the FIA’s nitpicking of silly things like underwear, jewelry, [and their very expensive swear jar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnj2dg/formula_1s_drivers_are_fighting_for_their_right/)

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

To the collective pain of Williams fans the world round, the team that’s been showing much promise and signs of growth this season, are having to accept that all may be for naught, at least in terms of rising in the WCC standings. 

Team Principal [James Vowles gave his honest assessment](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjkcdg/f1_im_hurting_right_now_james_vowles_gives_his/) of a torrid Brazilian Grand Prix weekend that began with so much promise, and was undone by big crashes and Alpine’s shock double podium rubbing salt in their wounds.

Speaking of Williams and their travails, in addition to likely losing $30 million in prize money, their recent spate of damages has them in a spot of bother, [leaving them uncertain of what car spec they can bring to Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glunax/unsustainable_run_of_damage_leaves_williams/)

The Middle East Oil Barons’ gradual takeover of Formula 1 continues, with [Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund set to buy a minority stake in what is becoming the Audi F1 team.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gmnca2/tobi_gruner_according_to_our_information_qatars/) Audi will retain full control, but gain a cash infusion for investments into their Hinwil factory and such.

1gplc79,Just finished a passion project - watching every race from 1992 to 2003. Here's what I learned...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gplc79/just_finished_a_passion_project_watching_every/,2024-11-12, Discussion,"I started watching F1 in 2004 and really wanted to find out a little more about the recent history of the sport, mainly about drivers. This took me a couple of years overall; I really like having background noise while working, so I would have old races on and take little notes on things that stood out. Safe to say there was a lot that made me think, I wanted to share it, and I could think of nowhere else to do so, so here it is. Hopefully this is appreciated - feel free to agree/disagree with any of this or ask anything I may not have covered etc...

* The level of driving talent throughout the field was so much worse in those days. It always made me laugh when I’d see people claim Latifi was a candidate for worst driver in F1 history. He was probably on par with someone like Aguri Suzuki, who was massively accident prone but had a noteworthy performance maybe once a year. Martin Brundle may be similar; very good for the era, but someone who struggled in qualifying like he did would probably have a much shorter shelf life in today's F1.
* The era immediately after Senna’s death is unquestionably the weakest since at least the early 80s, and most likely the weakest ever. Only Schumacher was the finished product. Hill was too error prone, Alesi too inconsistent, Villeneuve was both and the likes of Berger, Barrichello and Coulthard were lacking that last tenth or two. I don’t think you could say that for Lando, Charles or Piastri, nor for Ricciardo, Rosberg and Button in their primes.
* Michael Schumacher’s 1995 has to be the greatest single-season performance I can think of from a driver. After crashing at Imola, he went on a 13 race run where he won eight times, finished second once (Portugal), suffered a gearbox problem when leading by miles (Canada), got taken out while defending the lead (Britain), suffered mechanical failure while running second (Hungary) and got taken out while running second (Italy). This run included three of the best wins of his career at Spa, the Nurburgring and Aida, the latter one that really deserves more fanfare given I knew nothing about it before watching. If we consider Williams took 12 pole positions that year, Schumacher arguably wasn’t even driving the fastest car!
* Jacques Villeneuve is the most overrated driver I have ever seen. He was way off Hill in terms of pure pace in 96 but took advantage of Hill being awful at damage limitation. In ‘97 he was even worse at damage limitation than Damon the year prior. ‘98 saw some amazing individual drives, but there were eight occasions where he was either beaten by Frentzen, behind when one of them retired, or threw his car off the road. I would argue 2000 was his best, but even then it was hard to truly assess how good he was because his benchmark in the sister car was so bad. As soon as BAR put a competent driver in the second car, Villeneuve started to get shown up. He arguably looked weaker than Jarno Trulli compared to Panis.
* I couldn’t fathom how Montoya was so highly rated when he got walloped by Raikkonen in the same car. The Williams had to have been a rocketship. I now realise he probably was that good, but going to McLaren was awful for him. He was the antithesis of a Ron Dennis driver and just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong, though most of it was his own fault.
* Coulthard and Carlos Sainz Jr are basically the same driver, albeit Coulthard had better cars. They’d have phenomenal individual performances and somewhat lengthy purple patches where they looked like world beaters, and it was enough evidence to make you believe that Coulthard could really win the title, or Sainz could really become Ferrari’s #1 - then Leclerc/Hakkinen would remind everyone who’s boss.
* 2012 is still the greatest season ever, but 1999 and 2003 have to be right in the mix for sheer drama. There were so many flashpoints, narratives, underdog successes and what-ifs. 2000 also comes highly recommended for the sheer brilliance of the main protagonists.
* 1997 also comes highly recommended as one of the most competitive seasons of all time. There were no real classics, but there also wasn’t a single boring race. Williams had a rocketship for most of the year but Ferrari, McLaren and Benetton could win on any given weekend. Jordan and Sauber were also superb at tracks that suited their cars, while several midfield-or-lower teams were seriously boosted by Bridgestone being miles better than Goodyear. It couldn't possibly be understood by someone that hasn't seen it.
* The era puts into perspective how much MBS absolutely sucks. I couldn't stand Max in his latter years as FIA president but you could at least see he was fighting for the type of small team he himself used to be involved in. MBS is nothing more than a hyper-moralistic whinger.

It was the closest to late 90s racing I'd seen in a while. The drivers were gassed after it.\n\nI'd go one further myself: give teams a free choice of all five compounds per race, but mandate two stops minimum. I'm pretty sure it would force F1 to be a series of sprints again, instead of the sort of endurance racing we see in the current formula."", '>One of the better strategy discussions at races is if a team will one stop or two stop. Forcing two stops will eliminate that part of the strategy.\n\n  \nThinking about it, if it is guaranteed that everyone will do 2 stops, then Pirelli doesn\'t have to make their tyres last that long. And if a tyre doesn\'t last that long, the faster teams might do 3 stops as a ""safe/default"" strategy and slower teams would take the ""risk"" of 2 stops. So now the discussion could become ""will a team do 2 or 3 stops"".', 'Yeah they did all compounds for quali last year once or twice and it was boring.', ""Wasn't it Qatar last year? And it actually ended up being a 3 stop because the teams were only allowed to run 18 laps on each set of tyres""]",1,8,0.5,1,37,37,1,0,0.0,1
