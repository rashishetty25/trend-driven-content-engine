Is he a very good driver who deserves to be in a top team? Of course. 

But these people are acting like Ferrari didn’t appreciate him at all and just fired him for the first guy that wanted to drive for them. It’s Lewis Hamilton. I think Lewis and Max are the only 2 drivers on the grid that can get any team to fire one of their drivers immediately in order to sign them. 

I get that Carlos felt betrayed because he was supposed to renew his contract but the only reason he was “fired out of nowhere” is because Lewis made one of the biggest moves in the sport’s history. 

For Carlos to be a Ferrari driver for 4 years and have such good moments and wins with them is incredible and no one in Ferrari had any doubts that he’s been amazing at that team. 

They all love him, they never made him feel like a second driver, they always let him race Charles and were happy for him when he won races, in his last year they gave him the same upgrades as Charles and never prioritized one of them, they let him test with Williams in Abu Dhabi, they gave him one of the best send offs I’ve seen, even tomorrow he’s going to Fiorano and both him and his dad are gonna do a final lap in the F1-75 around the factory. 

Say what you want about Ferrari but I don’t think there’s another team on the grid that would do all of that. Ferrari treated him with all the respect and I see him coming back there in the future.","['I mean he mentioned that if it was another person replacing him he would feel insulted.

He held no grudges and there was no bitterness or animosity towards Lewis and Ferrari. He understood the situation and took it really well, even telling Lewis to enjoy his time at Ferrari. I don’t think we would have seen that level of generosity from many of the other drivers. I’ve always liked him but my respect for him went up even more after that. I really hope Williams builds him a decent car for 2026, I think the partnership between them both will be special. Even James Vowles said that the team went crazy when they found out Carlos would be joining him. He’s a very likeable person, and easily one of the most likeable on the grid.

Max Verstappen has always been clearly confirmed in this 2024, despite some of his hesitations in a certain part of the season, while Sergio Perez's position has never really been firm, not even after the new contract signed in the summer, which was intended to give serenity and stability to the Mexican driver. ‘I have a contract to race next year and unless something changes in the next few days, this will be the situation for next year,’ Perez had said in the Abu Dhabi post-race. ’We are talking to try to understand what is best going forward. We will discuss the situation on both sides and see if we are able to reach an agreement. If not, as I said, I have a contract for next year.’ Perez is mainly paying for a completely negative second half of the season where he collected only 34 points against 118 in the first 12 races, even less than Pierre Gasly with Alpine.\n\n**No surprise: even the Red Bull board would not want Checo Perez as Max Verstappen's team-mate**\n\nDuring the Abu Dhabi weekend, Helmut Marko had confirmed that an important meeting would be held on the day after the last GP of the season ‘to decide the future of both teams’. The Red Bull board, for the first time involved in a decision concerning a driver, expressed their willingness to terminate the relationship (as a driver) with Sergio Perez, while finding a solution that satisfies both parties. It is no coincidence that the Mexican driver was offered to become a brand ambassador, meanwhile maintaining the existing contract with the team signed last summer.\n\nA contract that has never really been a lifeline for the Mexican, even though it contained an important economic clause linked to the early termination of the relationship. 'We have heard rumours that there are around 16 million at stake. He at least wants his money, so he won't leave so easily. And I think there are some legal discussions going on at the moment,’ Nico Rosberg had made known during the Abu Dhabi weekend. The will expressed by the Red Bull board last Monday will or will not become the final decision if all agreements are made. Then it will move on to the official announcements, which, according to Helmut Marko, will take place this week. ‘In the next few days we will announce the news about the driver pair for next year,’ announced the Anglo-Austrian team's super-consultant in his column in Speedweek, admitting that negotiations are ongoing and that a decision will be made in a few hours.\n\n**Honda pushed for Tsunoda's test: the RB20 adapted very well to the Japanese's driving style**\n\nIt is Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda who are vying for the second seat in the official Red Bull team, alongside Max Verstappen. The choice of Horner and Marko has already been made and it would be to bet on Liam Lawson, but the board of the Austrian brand (also at the request of Honda) did not want to rush the decision in the Monday after Abu Dhabi, wanting to wait for the test that Yuki Tsunoda has carried out in the Emirates on the Red Bull RB20. As confirmed by Helmut Marko, a final decision will be made in these very hours but the New Zealand driver would seem to be the clear favourite, with the Japanese driver consequently confirmed in Racing Bulls.

1hfkn9i,2024 World Championship Standings using the previously proposed points down to 12th place system,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hfkn9i/2024_world_championship_standings_using_the/,2024-12-16, Statistics,"So this year there was a F1 points system change proposal for 2025 that was rejected as it was voted against by all teams in the F1 Comission meeting this past July. This proposed points sytem would have extended points down to 12th place finish, with no alteration to the sprint format. The changes would alter the points given from 8th place down, with the new proposal to also give points to 11th and 12th that would see a 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 breakdown.

Now, in theory, I'm also a defender of the current breakdown of points that only rewards the top 10. With that said, given the new entry of the 11th team (Cadillac) now approved for 2026 and with the prospect of a potential 12th entry in the coming 3 to 5 years, and with reliability being better then in previous decades (yes, we don't know how reliable the cars will be in 26' yet, so this might change), I think revisiting this idea again soon could be in the cards.

So, here are the alternative Drivers and Constructors standings for 2024 using this system: 

https://preview.redd.it/gsvncpck387e1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=05921731dca5a702ee7334ef5c7beb7d4bd403c1

As you can see, this system mainly changes things in a significant way in the midfield, with the drivers/constructors at the top and at the bottom not benefitting as much (I know this is obvious, but just thought I'd mention it). For instance, Max would score the exact same amount of points, as he didn't finish a single time in the 8th to 12th range, and most other drivers in the top positions wouldn't add many points to their tally either.

Some of the biggest gainers for this season would be Hülkenberg (+27 points), Alonso (+21), Magnussen & Gasly (+15), Albon (+14) and Tsunoda (+13). Also Bottas and Sargeant would have scored points! (Bottas for P11 in Lusail, Sargeant got a P11 in Silverstone). These results would also put Haas above Alpine in the WCC.

So, do you guys think there is any merit to this points system? Or do you prefer the system in place currently (fastest laps points will stop being awarded from 2025 onwards as a side note)? ","[""It's interesting to think about how Alpine vs Haas shook out in the constructors this year. Haas was way more consistent throughout the year, but Alpine was more volatile and had a couple of very high finishes that put them over the top. Hard to say which should be rewarded more, but it's something worth thinking about."", ""If the goal is to actually assess which driver/teams had the better season, obvs the further down you score the better. I don't know if that is the goal though or if the priority should be creating more unique/sacred moments by making points more exclusionary."", ""I think especially since there's about to be 2 more cars on the grid, it makes sense to give out points to 2 more cars."", 'Give points to halve the cars: 10x points for 20 cars, 11x points for 22 cars, 12x points for 24 cars, etc.', ""I support the most complete system. Points are a mark of prestige - they're a tool of classification, and the current system fails at that for half the grid. NASCAR does it right awarding points all the way down."", 'I just can\'t see how not expanding the points range almost all the way down the field isn\'t better for fans? Currently, we would see an incredible overtake for 15th place, wow what a move, and what? Nothing. Absolutely nothing meaningful has happened, that driver has gone from 0 points to 0 points.\n\n*""But you should do better if you want to earn points""* Ok, but not *everyone* who does better can score points under the current system? How does beating almost half the field (i.e. P11) warrant the same reward as finishing last, **or not even finishing at all**? How can that be logical?\n\n*""It means teams can get away with not trying and still reaping a reward""* Ok, well perhaps for a 22-car field we should give out points to P18? So you have to beat four cars to receive points and it would (probably) be 1 point so it\'s not a huge reward?\n\n*""It devalues the achievement of earning points""* I mean maybe it does yeah, but I think my first and second paragraphs are the justification and the paragraph above is the mitigation for this problem. Still have an achievement for getting points (not everyone gets them), but actually the (currently) non-scoring positions actually interesting.', 'Logan with 2 points Yay!', 'Nico loved those P11s', 'With Cadillac incoming, this point system should surely be adapted.']",107,80,0.9,107,464,464,-1,0,0.0,-1

Following all questions and the fitting answers to it:

**Who will win the 2024 World Drivers Championship?**

What a surprise. Max Verstappen won it and over 94% of the participants guessed it right.

**Who will place 3rd in the WDC?**

As expected by 31.7% Charles Leclerc placed third with a total of 356 points.

 **Who will place 7th in the WDC?**

With a calculated season Lewis Hamilton was able to secure the 7th spot in the WDC. 3.9% of all reddit prediction participants expected this outcome. Fun fact: Last season Carlos Sainz was the lucky seventh! Now Lewis is taking over the seat of Carlos.

**Who will place last in the 2024 World Drivers Championship?**

What a battle the fight for last place it was. After Logan Sargeant has scored an 11. Place, it seemed to be pretty certain that Valtteri Bottas or Zhou Guanyu will place last. Until the Qatar GP where Zhou was able to score points and Bottas finished the race on the 11. Place. Therefore Logan Sargeant was last again. Until Alpine decided to let Jack Doohan drive the last race of the season.

He is the last placed driver of the WDC 2024.

 

**Will every driver score points in 2024?**

As stated in the answer above, we got three drivers (Bottas, Sargeant and Doohan) who scored a whooping 0 points. Therefore the correct answer was ""No"" and 44% got this one right.

 

**Which team will win the 2024 World Constructors Championship?**

Only 0.3% participants predicted correctly that McLaren will win the World Constructors.

 

**Which team will finish 3rd in the WCC?**

Even less people expected Red Bull Racing to place third on the WCC. Only 0.25% expected them in that position.

 

**Which team will place last in the 2024 World Constructors Championship?\***

As Kick Sauber drove for most of the season with a tractor they were able to secue themselve the last place in the WCC. Therefore they will get the most time in the wind tunnel and 5% of our participants will get a point for guessing this one right.

 

**Will every team score points in 2024?** 

12% predicted this wrong. All teams DID score points in 2024 as Kick Sauber finally managed to get a Top 10 in Qatar.

 

**How many Grands Prix will there be in 2024?**

The longest F1 season was held as expected. All 24 planned Grand Prix were held as „only“ 71% expected this.

 

**How many Special Car Liveries (helmets won't count) will be done until the end of the season?**

Ths certainly was the season of special liveries. 18 different special liveries where used during the season. 7.5% guessed this correctly.

 

**How many Driver Lineup changes (for 2025) will be confirmed until the last race of 2024?**

Silly season started pretty early. Hamilton to Ferrari, both Sauber driver will leave the team, Ocon to Haas, Sainz to Williams. As both RB and Red Bull Racing are still yet to confirm their full line up, we have 7+ changes in the driver lineup and 14% correct answers.

 

**Will Alonso end his career after this season? (Needs to be confirmed before the end of the season)**

No he doesnt. The rookie is still hungry for more and starts a new season as predicted by 96%.

 

**Will Red Bull win more than half of all races?**

Only 4.4% predicted this one right and expected Red Bull Racing to dominate once again. In the end they only won 9 of the 24 races.

 

**Will any race finish with zero lapped cars?**

In China either the drivers were DNFd (Ricciardo, Tsunado & bottas) or counted on the same lap as the winner. Therefore we didn t have any lapped cars in the end. This was predicted by over 50%.

 

**Will any race finish with zero DNFs?**

In the first race of the season we already had no DNFs. 80% predicted this to happen somewhere during the season.

 

**Who will have the most DNFs?** 

Alexander Albon is has DNFd at six races over the whole season. Only 0.3% predicted him to be the ""King of DNFs"".

 

**Who will have the least DNFs?**

Oscar Piastri had no DNFs (and completed every lap) during the season. 0.5% expected him to be the most reliable car/driver combination when it comes down to DNFs.

 

**Who will have the first DNF (only counting race and not Training or Quali)?**

As the first race had no DNFs, Pierre Gasly managed to be first retirement in the second race. What a start of the season for 6.3% of the reddit participants as they locked their first points.

 

**Will the WDC be clinched before the second to last race of the season?**

94% predicted this correctly. Yes the WDC was decided already in Las Vegas.

 

**Will the WCC be clinched before the 21th race of the season?**

In the end the decision for the WCC went right down to the wire. McLaren and Ferrari battled till the last race of the season and 18% are getting points for their prediction.

 

**Will a driver have their race result disqualified?** 

In Silverstone Russell got disqualified, while Hülkenberg was disqualified in Brazil. Over all 45% predicted a disqualification.

 

**Will any F1 driver miss a race due to injury?**

As Sainz has missed Saudi-Arabia this was decided already really early in the season. Kevin Magnussen also missed two races late in the season. In the end this was correctly guessed by 40%.

 

**Will the leader of the Drivers Championship have more than 205 points after the Spanish Grand Prix? (10th Race)**

Yes. After Spain Verstappen had scored 215 points and was ahead of Lando Norris by 69 points (nice). 70% predicted this one correctly.

 

**How many races will finish under Safety Car in 2024?**

2 races (Australia and Azerbaijan) did finish under (Virtual) Safety Car which will still count in that aspect. 29.7% users predicted this correct.

 

**Will any driver receive a race ban for accumulating too many penalty points?** 

KMAG really delivered in that aspect. He was forced to sit out during the Azerbaijan GP due to having too many penalty points. Therefore 5.3% of all predictions were correct.

 

**Select all drivers that will win a race in 2024**

The race winners from 2024 were: Verstappen, Leclerc, Sainz, Hamilton, Russell, Norris and Piastri.

This was predicted by a whooping 0.14%.

 

**Select all teams that will win a race in 2024**

Red Bull Racing, Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren won races during that season. 23% were expecting these teams to win at least one race.

 

**Will we see a first-time race winner in 2024?**

The correct answer is Yes as both McLaren drivers won their first Grand Prix. Over 50% expected a first-time win from someone.

 

**Which driver pairing will have the biggest difference in points? (in percentage; Driver pairings where one driver has 0 points won't count)**

Even though anybody thinks this one must be obvious (looking at you Checo) the fact that we count the difference in percentage instead of points makes this one way closer than expected.

Verstappen 437P vs Perez 152P = 34.782%

Norris 374P vs Piastri 292P = 78.075%

Leclerc 356P vs Sainz 290P = 81.461%

Russell 245P vs Hamilton 223P = 91.020%

Alonso 70P vs Stroll 24P = 34.286%

Gasly 42P vs Ocon/Doohan 23P = 54.762%

Hulkenberg 41P vs Magnussen 16P = 39.024%

Tsunoda 30P vs Ricciardo/Lawson 16P = 53.333%

Albon 12P vs Lawson/Colapinto 5P = 41.667%

Zhou 4P vs Bottas 0P = n/a

Therefore our winner is Stroll / Alonso where Stroll only scored 34.28% of the points which Alonso scored. Perez was able to avoid that title by 0.5% (and Kick Sauber weren t counted as Bottas didn t score at all).

 

**Who will score more points in 2024? Perez, Russell, Hamilton, Leclerc, Sainz (Jr.)**

Out of those five, Leclerc was the one who scored the most points. This was predicted by 50%.

 

**Who will score more points in 2023? Bottas, Zhou, Tsunoda, Ricciardo, Hulkenberg, Magnussen**

It was Nico Hulkenberg which 0.7% of all the predictions chose.

 

**How many races will start behind the safety car?**

No race did start behind safety car. 26% of all predictions expected no race to start behind safety car.

 

**Will at least two drivers win their home Grand Prix?** 

Leclerc won his home race in Monaco, Hamilton did it in Silverstone. Therefore 35% got this one right.

 

**Will any team fully comply with the engine usage limit in 2024?** 

Aston Martin and McLaren complied with the full engine usage limit. This was predicted by 63%.

 

**Will any driver win 5 straight races?**

3 races in arow (twice) for Max Verstappen were the longest series of wins. Therefore the answer is „No“ and was correctly predicted by 7.5%.

 

**Who will be awarded the most penalty points in 2024?**

The most penalty points in 2024 received the one driver who was excluded of a GP. It s Kevin Magnussen with 12 penalty points. 6% expected Magnussen to receive the most penalty points over the whole season.

 

**Will any pair of teammates collide and cause a DNF?** 

The first crash that is coming to my mind is the french duo Ocon and Gasly in Monaco. 84.7% expected that any teammates will collide and DNF during the season.

1hfsx5s,Favorite moment of the season ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hfsx5s/favorite_moment_of_the_season/,2024-12-16, Discussion,"I’m reminiscing about the season, and while everyone’s aware of how good it was, there’s so many moments that deserve to be appreciated.

Yes there was 7 different 2 time winners, unheard of in recent times.

But besides that there’s so many amazing things  

Charles won in Monaco, he achieved his childhood dream and made the prince of Monaco cry.

Lewis won in Silverstone after being in such a terrible place with Mercedes.

The two drivers running in first and second in a race were battling aggressively, made contact and the driver in 3rd place (from a completely different team than 1st and 2nd place) won.

George Russel was the first driver in so many years to be disqualified from a win.

The entirety of Sunday in Brazil. 

Kmag actually got a race ban.

There’s so many moments that i’m probably missing that were just so insane, but so much stuff happened that lots of them just get lost.

My personal favorite as a Charles fan, was the moment in Monza that I realized… hang on Charles is going for the win. 

The race started on a high because Lando bottled pole and Charles from 4th got ahead into 2nd. I was already enjoying the Lando lap 1 memes (I don’t even hate Lando, i just enjoyed the slander)

And then the whole race was me thinking how can Charles take p2 and then kind of accepting and being content with a p3 and a podium in Monza.

And then i realized the size of the gap to Piastri, Charles pace and how many laps were left. Like 30s after i realized the commentators started to see it and talk about it and then the lap after that you could hear the crowds cheers as they realized Charles was racing for the win.

It was so amazing cause I really wasn’t expecting it. Monaco, once he got pole it was so stressful because he should win it unless things go wrong. All i felt was stress until Charles crossed t he line. But Monza was another experience entirely it was pure excitement.

While Charles win in Monza was a big moment, people forget how exciting the dawning realization was.

What amazing or insane moments have been lost in the sea of this season. Or even haven’t been lost but just deserve to still be talked about ","['A bit of a random one, but I loved watching the Haas boys start on Wets in Montreal and overtake loads of cars.

I don't think it's right for teams under the top 10 to fight for essentially meaningless positions that won't help in either drivers or constructors championships. It'll also add more value to the midfield and the backmarkers races rather than them just being a billboard for sponsors.
Am I missing something or is it just that easy.
What are the pros and cons to each?","['Seems to me that the older fans want to limit points to the top finishers. In the past, “points” was some achievement for a team/driver. But “back in the day”, just finishing a race was an achievement. In the modern era, reliability is so good that **not** finishing is now a rarity.\n\nI am in favor of expanding the points further down the finishing order, because a driver that finishes 11th every race shouldn’t be outscored by a driver who lucked into 10th once. For the bottom half of the field, their season finishing position is heavily skewed by anomalous races, and doesn’t reflect the season-long competency of the team/drivers.', ""Except positions outside the top 10 aren't meaningless positions.
