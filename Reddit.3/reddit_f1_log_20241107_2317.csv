Sure the races are geographically still pretty far apart but there is also a good amount of time between the races. It’s totally within reason time wise to move between sites in the time between races. Next year the hardest would be Austin to Mexico City with a full 24 hrs of drive time. But even Mexico to Las Vegas would be easy because there is almost a full month.
