Time to lico for 50 laps."", 'I know the prancing horse on that car just wants to gallop right off it out of shame.', '****\n**Hamilton confident Ferrari can take ‚Äòstep forward‚Äô in Austin as he sets out expectation for final races of 2025**\n\nLewis Hamilton has set out his hopes for what Ferrari can achieve at the United States Grand Prix, a race in which team mate Charles Leclerc took victory in 2024.\n\nLewis Hamilton is hopeful that Ferrari can take a ‚Äústep forward‚Äù by extracting more from their car during the United States Grand Prix weekend, with the seven-time World Champion admitting that the final six races of the campaign could play a key role in preparations for 2026.\n\nHamilton arrives into Round 19 of the season off the back of a P8 finish last time out in Singapore, having originally crossed the line in seventh before being handed a five-second time penalty post-race for exceeding track limits whilst managing a brake issue on his car.\n\nLooking ahead to what might be possible at the Circuit of The Americas ‚Äì a track where he has previously been victorious on five occasions ‚Äì Hamilton voiced an optimistic note about Ferrari‚Äôs prospects in terms of continuing to make improvements to the SF-25.\n\n‚ÄúI never have expectations except for that we give it our all and we continue to improve,‚Äù the Briton said. ‚ÄúI think there are lots and lots of positives to take from every weekend, and there are lots of areas we can improve.\n\n‚ÄúWe spent time after the last race going through areas that we can improve on, and I really think that this weekend we can take a step forward and extract more from the car that we have.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve not moved the car forward in terms of performance, but there is more performance in the car that, if we execute a little bit better, I think we can extract more, so that‚Äôs the goal.‚Äù\n\nWith the 2025 season now entering into its last six rounds ‚Äì featuring three Sprints along the way, including this weekend at COTA ‚Äì Hamilton was quizzed on what the approach will be and how the squad will find the answers they are seeking ahead of 2026, a year in which new technical regulations will be introduced into the sport.\n\n‚ÄúThese are ultimately test weekends, really, in terms of just continuing to learn, to improve on our processes,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIn the last races there have been a couple of gems through the weekend that we couldn‚Äôt capitalise on, and so it‚Äôs taking those good bits from there and continuing to work on them, to take what works and then change what isn‚Äôt [working].\n\n‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to do moving forwards. I think it‚Äôs continuing to build on the relationships, continuing to build on communication.\n\n‚ÄúUltimately, everyone back at the factory really deserves a good result and that‚Äôs the sole focus ‚Äì to get good results, try to maximise, squeeze every point we can out of our performances on the weekends, and I really, really believe that we can do that, so we just stay focused.‚Äù\n****']",0,3,0.44,0,3,3,0,0,-0.06,0
