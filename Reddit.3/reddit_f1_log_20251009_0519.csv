 What is clean air pace in Formula 1?  
  
When we talk about clean air pace, we’re referring to a driver’s true performance when not affected by the “dirty air” coming off the car ahead.  
  
 Dirty air is the turbulent airflow generated by a Formula 1 car, which reduces downforce for the car behind, making cornering more difficult and increasing tyre wear.  
  
That’s why clean air pace gives us the clearest view of a driver’s pure and consistent speed, without external disturbances such as traffic.  
  
 For fair and accurate comparisons, we standardise several factors:  
  
\- Only laps on the same tyre compound (soft, medium, or hard) are compared.  
  
\- We apply a typical degradation per lap rate for each compound.  
  
\- A fuel correction is also included, adjusting lap times to remove the effect of fuel load — essentially equalising every lap to simulate running at zero fuel weight.  
  
Obviously, there may be many external factors that we are unaware of that can influence a driver's performance, such as strategy or not needing to push to the maximum in a stint. Therefore, we try to carefully evaluate each driver in order to avoid including laps that are not representative.

Yes, overtaking possibilities are limited, but not impossible. Races there are rarely processions, but better than that, it's a circuit that actually allows for defensive driving. There's been some great on track battles with cars trying to get ahead of the other after the first few corners, and those battles are so cool to see, especially seeing the cars fighting side by side out of the second corner.

It disappoints me whenever people shrug Hungary off as the track where you can't overtake on, because I never found that to be the case. Not every Hungarian Grand Prix is a classic, but I haven't seen any truly bad ones either, and I've been watching F1 since 2012. Even 2015 saw it host a good race.

As for a popular track that I don't like? It's got to be Spa. From 2012 to now, the only times I enjoyed the Belgian Grand Prix were in 2012, 2019 and 2024. The Belgian Grand Prix in 2013, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2023 and 2025 were amongst the worst races in their respective seasons.

I know it's a good track to drive on, I've done so many times in all of my racing games, but it's simply not a fun track to watch.
