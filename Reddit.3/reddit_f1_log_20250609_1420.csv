1l6fjo2,F1 in the 2000’s was unhinged and amazing,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l6fjo2/f1_in_the_2000s_was_unhinged_and_amazing/,2025-06-08, Discussion,"I’ve been rewatching some old race clips & highlights from the early 2000’s and honestly… it’s pure chaotic gold.

You had wild overtakes, cars with weird skinny noses, team liveries that looked like someone lost a bet and strategies that made absolutely no sense but somehow worked.

Montoya sending it from 3 miles back, Takuma Sato just deciding to try things and teams like BAR-Honda constantly doing something ridiculous.

Don’t get me wrong, this era of car is on a different level. But back then it felt like anything could happen… and half the time, it did.

In MotoGP, when they refer to a rider’s world championships, they seemed to count *all* of their world championships— even the ones from other classes like Moto2 or Moto3. By contrast, in F1, very little weight seems to be given to whether a driver was a previous F2 or F3 champ.  \n  \nIs this purely a cultural difference or is the gap between F1/F2/F3 somehow more substantial than between different classes of motorcycle racing? Like, is there a practical reason why F2/F3 are less prestigious than Moto2/Moto3?', ""Watching the highlights of the last 20 or so laps of Canada 2011 yesterday made me realise how unsafe some on track situations were even only 14 years ago, you have marshalls running across the track in front of cars that are still catching the safety car queue (picking up bits of Heidfeld's front wing), and a recovery vehicle on the outside of turn 2 covered only by yellows, and it going completely unremarked by the commentators (Brundle & Coulthard).\n\nWhat situations that we accept now do you think will be looked back upon in a similar toe-curling manner in another 10-15 years?\n\nFor me it's the pit lane layout with dangling air lines for the wheel guns (why not battery operated like in other series?) behind held out of the way by mechanics so that a car being released doesn't hit them."", ""Is Grosjean's Bahrain 2020 crash the most dramatic/scary F1 accident to ever be broadcasted live?\n\nI thought about it the other day and tried remembering some of the most heart-stopping F1 accidents that were captured live on camera, and I think it was. Now I'm aware Lauda's crash in Germany 1976 was filmed, but, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think it was on the official broadcast. Other crashes that came to my mind are Mick Schumacher's Saudi Arabia 2022, Kubica's Canada 2007, Alonso's Brazil 2003, but ultimately imo I believe only Canada 2007 can compare in that sense as it really came out of nowhere as the camera just caught Kubica flying into the wall. What surprised me is that I didn't think of a single fatal crash there; I don't think Senna's accident was that dramatic visually, and honestly I am fairly certain Barrichello's crash was more scary than that (I believe Ratzenberger's crash didm't make the live feed, but might be wrong). Feel free to point out some older moments, cause I'm not that much into pre-late 80s F1 and am quite sure I missed something."", ""\nHi everyone. I am relatively new to F1 with a non-engineering background. \n\nI recently picked up the book - How to Win a Grand Prix: From Pit Lane to Podium - the Inside Track by Bernie Collins and the insight is absolutely fantastic. \n\nBut at the same time, it has completely sapped any fun out of F1 to me. \n\nThe amount of numbers, science, engineering and statistics, down to the millimetre.\n\nIt would be great to see one race a year where everyone races in the same car, to see who's skill comes out on top. \n\nRather than a sport, F1 just seems like one big science experiment with too much technology.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?"", ""I'm by no means an expert, but my understanding is that MotoGP, Moto2 and Moto3 are effectively three classes of one world championship, all running the full calendar. (Crucially, it's not like WEC or other modern multi-class championships where all classes race simultaneously).\n\nOn the other hand, F2 and F3 for most of their history have been wholly separate championships from F1, and are also not World Championships according to the FIA.

FIA actively pushes successful drivers ""upwards"" by making a rule that F2 and F3 world champions can no longer compete in the same series the next year. You may also see this from the aspect of F1 teams: they sign feeder series drivers into their dedicated junior programs aiming to foster future F1 drivers.\n\nWhile people might sometimes consider Moto2 and Moto3 as analogous to feeder series based on riders\' career paths, they are not intentionally made so by FIM. The different series are officially different displacement classes of the World Championship. There is also no Super License system or banning of Moto2 and Moto3 champions from staying in their series.\n\nOne may compare Formula 2 to JuniorGP and the whole concept of F1 feeder series to Road to MotoGP.', ""F2 and F3 aren't world championships for a start.

My understanding is that the speed and reliability of loosening the nuts was quite a long way away from the level they currently get from the pneumatic guns, and so none of them were very interested in having slower pit stops with more issues (most of which would be outside of the team's control)."", ""> I don't think it was on the official broadcast.  \n  \nThe races were broadcast, just not all in English or internationally (if i recall correctly BBC boycotted that year generally).  \nThe broadcast rights just weren't centrally organized through FISA or later FOPA & FoM, but the local promoter.  \nORF (Public broadcaster) produced all Austrian GPs between 1970 & 1978.
