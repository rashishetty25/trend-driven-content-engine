Caveats.  
I have the full data set from the very first race but did it from 1980 to simplify the calculations of max total points as there have been races where teams had 3 drivers etc.   
Only Grand Prix results no Sprints included.  
No fastest Lap points.  
This is using the current points system only.  


  
Calculations are very simple. Total number of races for each year multiplied by 43 for constructors or 25 for drivers as the total points available for each season.

Then using corrected points for the current system calculated what every constructor or driver would have gotten and just did (points/available points)\*100
