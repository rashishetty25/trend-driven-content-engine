The fact that it was the front right this time, which at Baku is the wheel that takes the most load during the race (usually it's the front left, which is mostly where the issue has been since Silverstone as well) I wonder if it's causing issues with the nuts or wheel rims on that particular wheel, especially on these long runs on mediums and/or running fully in dirty air. They've had the same issue once or twice with Piastri as well (Austria was one, which was after he was in Lando's dirty air and pushing for so long so it does track), so it could be that is a slight achilles heel with this season's suspension anyway, and the tweak for Norris's car is exacerbating it on his car.

Regardless if they are on the softer or the harder, the pace is the same and the deg is also pretty much the same', ""Forcing more tire wear will not result in better racing, just like more pit stops don't make Monaco a more interesting race.

It's neigh impossible for Pirelli to develop tires that have a time delta and a certain wear down profile that works ideally across 24 circuits with next or no testing and regular protests feom teams if they want to make any changes, where resurfacing and weather basically can make their selection useless.  \nThis is why last time they had just one other company also bidding besides Pirelli, while majority of competitors just won't make an offer as they don't want to showcase & advertise artificially degrading tires."", 'Today the track was 10 degrees colder than it was last year as per Sky. That probably negated any difference from bringing softer tyres compared to last year.', ""They're stuck between a rock and a hard place (a C1 and a C2?). They bring tyres which degrade a lot more and all the fans are pissed off because the drivers then spend the whole race at 90% pace managing their tyres"", 'Seeing the car live on track, you definitely see a difference between the medium and the hard!\n\n\nThe issue is more that there are no cliffs anymore, so at some point, the medium are getting slower but still match the hard... and on a low deg circuit in cold conditions. Yeah this is what it is\xa0', 'Every time this topic crops up, there seems to be an underlying assumption that the teams lack agency. Whatever Pirelli bring to the table, the teams will adapt to. And strategies will always converge on one ""ideal"" strategy that pretty much everybody contending for points will adopt and we\'ll be right where we started.\n\n\n\n>Should Pirelli make more of a difference between compounds to better emphasise different race strategies?\n\nWith the current three-compounds-race-two regulations, there will always be a compound that\'s either too fragile or too slow to be a useful race tyre and that compound will see minimal race use. A bigger gap isn\'t a solution because it just makes the extremes worse. Consider: sending the C1 to Monaco (bigger gap, no?), or the C6 to Suzuka. Neither option is a suitable one even though the gap has been made bigger.\n\nThat said, Baku (like a few other street circuits) is probably a poor example to use when assessing tyres. There isn\'t a huge difference in performance between compounds there because almost all the corners of note are slow, 90¬∫, point-and-squirt affairs that don\'t tax the lateral grip of the tyres.\n\n(Off on a tangent here, but in my opinion, what we actually need is a candid assessment of the type of tracks we race on. We\'ve got too many sacred cows and too many cash-grabs on the calendar that just aren\'t good ""race tracks"" ‚Äì at least not for the fat cars we have now.)', ""the last few races? the tires have been dire since 2018. \n\nWe had a race back in 18 or 19 iirc where Bottas was leading ham locked up so switched to new tires, then vettel pit to not be undercut and bottas stayed out, turned out despite being new rubber the harder compound was just slower than the softer rubber despite being old and on from the start and both ham and vettel lost time to bottas rather than gain or undercut them so he just stayed out.\n\nThis basically shouldn't happen with tires with reasonable deg and tires that give decent performance. We went from one stoppers almost nowhere, maybe monaco, to one stoppers becoming common.\n\nThe worst thing wasn't even the lack of difference between compounds, it was lack of a working window. the old tires you might run 5-10c cooler and you'd gain significant tire life at a slower time, or you could run 10c hotter, get more performance and lose some laps. The current tires have such a narrow window that if you don't get in it, you will suck performance wise, you won't gain laps or gain performance. If you're 5c over you both lose performance and tire life, and if you're 5c under you both lose performance and tire life. \n\nOld tires, one team might work best doing a two stopper on harder compounds and another team might do 5 stops pushing quali style stints at max pace but importantly, you could pretty easily make up the pitstop gap on fresh rubber. Now you can't which is why most races are one stop.\n\nTires have been fucking dire for years, lack of strategy, so many teams just missing performacne completely one track (more often about tires not working for them than car not suiting track), also we have races where you can't adapt strat much because you basically one stop or you're fucked.""]",1,44,0.51,1,43,43,1,2,0.020000000000000018,1

Or is any implementation at all  impossible by existing regulations? 

I can imagine some kind of augmented reality version with overlays giving a real benefit to the drivers. But than again i'm no F1 drivers, so it might be less than I think, or the downsides outweigh the benefits?
