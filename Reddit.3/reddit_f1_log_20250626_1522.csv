It also lets people who have talent but not experience in F1 get used to how to drive an F1 car so when they get to your latest car they are up to speed quickly.\n\nThis is something a lot of the rookies that have come into F1 and done well from the off have had. Hamilton notably had a lot of testing time (might have been current gen back then as well as rules were looser) but Kimi had a lot of miles on previous F1 cars before he ever touched the wheel of a modern Merc.\n\nAlso the engineers can probably draw links between the current car parts and previous and may be able to learn things that are relevant to the current or next gen car."", ""Well they get data which they always love to have, and get to scope out talent.

Even for someone who doesn't look like a likely F1 prospect, they're always interested in seeing the data. Toyota would love to find an F1 likely prospect within their fold. I'm sure they hoped they had one with Miyata, but he hasn't adapted to F2, which, even though they are very, very different cars, is a large strike against him.\n\nHaas benefitted more directly when Ocon and Bearman also got to drive the car, which has happened. With Ocon changing teams, even driving a 2023 Haas is helpful, especially since it's still in the same regulations. And a little off season test always helps keep the neck strength up too. Driving an F1 car is really the best neck exercise, better than they can do in the gym.

Lots of teams have old cars sitting around, and that doesn't mean they do anything with them.

1lk8b80,How Alex Dunne has found an 'extra level' as McLaren junior eyes F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk8b80/how_alex_dunne_has_found_an_extra_level_as/,2025-06-25, News,I spoke with Alex Dunne and his driver coach Warren Hughes to discuss the progress he's made since joining the McLaren Driver Development programme. ,"[""He has the one thing you can't teach: the raw speed. That alone will see someone take a punt on him, whether it's McLaren themselves or another team happy to make space for him with some cash from McLaren as a sweetener. He's a wrecking ball on wheels currently and I'd argue he could do with a second year in F2 to iron out those kinks but he's so quick he might make that impossible by winning the whole thing this year despite his recklessness. Anyone from Ireland should be very excited, he could potentially be the real deal if he does the work, stays disciplined and improves his racecraft."", ""McLaren doesn't have space at the moment, but they let Bortoleto go, or they wrote a contract that let Bortoleto escape, one of those. Dunne would be a good choice for another team looking for a rookie."", 'Will be interesting to see how he does. He’s got amazing raw talent. It seems like there won’t be an opening in 2026. I hope he gets a seat.', '>McLaren junior eyes F1\n\n... Where would he go?', 'No space at McLaren until 2028', 'If he does win F2, then perhaps a year in Formula E with whoever Neom McLaren turn into will keep him race craft ready for an opening into Formula 1.', 'Can we please stop posting PlanetF1 links?', ""I hope i McLaren doesn't lose him to any other team like how Alpine lost Piastri to McLaren\n\nHe is slightly rough but rapid"", 'I would bet that Dunne crashes the car. He is fast, but also a wreckless driver and causes a lot of touches/crashes in F2. \n\nFurthermore I wouldnt say that there is no space at McLaren. Look what they did with Theo Pouchaire. They promised and he had a contract but then they switched and in the end he had no cockpit at all. So if Lando has a low and Zac Brown is happy with Dunne, I would also bet that Zac would do the change immediately.']",88,40,0.82,88,273,273,-2,0,0.0,-2
