Some drivers were clearly struggling, while others didn’t seem as affected. I’ve seen how bad heat stroke can get, and it surprised me nothing worse came of it.

From my own experience, you don’t need weeks of prep, just a few sessions training in the heat made a massive difference in resiliency and cut heat injuries way down. Makes me wonder if F1 drivers could do something similar before hot races like Qatar or Singapore, or if that just isn’t realistic with their schedules.","['They already do this using saunas, etc., specifically before hot races', ""They do try to train in similar conditions.

1nkpw92,[Stuff] The question we weren’t allowed to ask Liam Lawson in rare pre-race interview New Zealand media,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nkpw92/stuff_the_question_we_werent_allowed_to_ask_liam/,2025-09-19, News,,"['To avoid clickbait, the question was ""Where will you be driving in 2026?""', 'Stuff is a garbage news outlet in NZ so this shitty clickbait title is no surprise', ""Years ago, an editor imparted unto me that if someone doesn't want you to ask something, it's probably because there's some (uncomfortable) truth to it that they're trying to hide. Misunderstandings and falsehoods can be easily clarified.\n\nErgo, if Liam was fully secure in whatever he was doing in 2026, Racing Bulls wouldn't go around censoring fair and frankly innocuous questions. Reading between the lines and using the context provided, you can pretty well infer what's happened and why the question's been blocked.\n\nYou can say what you want about the headline or the premise of the article or the state of the F1 media, which I agree has been sullied by clickbait, poor research, and drivel masquerading as op-eds. But this is a brave and important piece calling out the obstruction of the press, a trend that I've noticed is rising in motorsport in recent years and exacerbating the erosion of real journalism.\n\nThat PR teams increasingly view the press as something to be censored suggests a failure of two things: properly training their drivers to be able to answer challenging questions, and building relationships with the media that serve both parties.\n\nThis second part is jeopardized when public relations entities control access and narratives to an unreasonable degree, thereby limiting journalists' ability to work –\xa0and yes, as Mat's article says, often by speaking on behalf of otherwise cooperative sources. It's all about image control. And while in some cases image control is prudent, it's counterproductive and absurd when taken to an extreme, as it often is in racing.\n\nI know several other reputable racing journalists these days who feel powerless to do real reporting because they'll be yelled at, chased out, or denied access for deigning to do their jobs properly, which sometimes entails asking tougher questions because they're the only ones charged with doing so.\n\nGood journalists generally aren't interested in engaging with this kind of coercive behavior, and many simply stop trying after a while –\xa0which only invites more rubbish to the table. Mat alludes to the perils of this pretty well at the end, when he has to offer speculation instead of firsthand material.\n\nThe quiet protest of declining the invitation is exactly what should be done. I hope more will follow Stuff's lead here. A must-read for anyone else in or interested in motorsport journalism."", 'Stuff were told they had to pre clear their questions.\n\nThe question that was not allowed was\n\n>Do you feel like you are racing for a 2026 seat in these last eight races and is there any feedback from either Racing Bulls (VCARB) or Red Bull around that?', 'The no editorializing titles subreddit rule is stupid, so I don\'t blame OP for it. The article itself was a fun read. I liked the line ""yet another Hail Mary strategy that came up twos rather than aces"". It was all very tongue in cheek, supporting their driver but also acknowledging his mistakes. \n\nHonestly, I think it\'s very interesting news that\'s worth reporting that Racing Bulls told a publication not to ask about his seat next year, and apparently insinuated not to talk about his demotion at the beginning of the year.\n\nFrom that, if the seats have been decided, I don\'t think Liam has one. But, I think it\'s more likely that they haven\'t been decided yet, at that they might not be decided for a while. But that\'s my fairly baseless speculation.', 'Bad title. Bad.
