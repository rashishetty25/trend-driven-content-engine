1ixvvux,How much do teams benefit from not releasing their real car during preseason testing/car reveal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ixvvux/how_much_do_teams_benefit_from_not_releasing/,2025-02-25, Discussion,"Only been following F1 since 2020 and testing since 2022.

Teams like Ferrari and McLaren release 60% of their cars and keep some stuff for the testing and 1st race. Whereas Red Bull just shows either the show car or the previous years car.

How much of the design philosophy of the Ferrari car(just an example) can be examined by their rivals considering they aren't seeing the entire car/How much does Red Bull delay their rivals from copying them by not releasing their car?

Really interested to know the answer.","[""There's no real incentive for any team to show their actual car for upcoming season during pre-season testing, apart from preventing teams to copy each other's concepts and make them ready by the first GP weekend. Which is why you will mostly see teams testing out individual parts like front wing, rear wing, side aero curtains, etc. using flow-vis material. Some teams however will reveal their full car on the final day if it requires them to run programs based on actual chassis, as well as gain popularity on social media if it's a radical design compared to previous year (which can be tricky to copy in short amount of time, if at all)."", ""The less lead time you give your rivals to be able to copy something novel the better. Could something small or huge but it all adds up in the end. It's pretty easy to copy certain things. Like Racing Point and the pink Mercedes. To answer the question, it can vary how much benefit there is but there's likely always some.\xa0"", ""When it's just a livery reveal, teams won't show their real car. When it comes to actual driving on track, all teams use their real cars."", 'The later you release/drive your car, the more time you have to develop and produce the car.', 'Publicity.', 'Aerodynamics play a big part such as wing designs, also shows how teams can interpret the rules differently to make small gains which all add up. There are loads of examples of this with rear wings. \n\nThe later you show the car the longer it takes for other teams to copy and catch up. \n\nI know the Merc sidepods flopped massively but if they had worked then Merc would have had a big advantage over rivals for many races.', 'The zero sidepod comes to mind', 'I think we have to have an Asterix on that last sentence, simply due to Mercedes and their zero pod fake out.', ""When there's only a few days before testing starts, I'd imagine it's the reverse. The more time you give yourself to catch any unwelcome surprises, the better chance you have of applying a fix before the start of testing. Whatever issues RB/Merc discover during the shakedown, they'll be dealing with tomorrow too.""]",0,13,0.5,0,11,11,0,13,0.5,0

Is it just hold over from last year's drama?"", 'And then he will criticize the launch mostly!
