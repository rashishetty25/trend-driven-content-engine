1mcckj6,My experience at the Spa GP.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mcckj6/my_experience_at_the_spa_gp/,2025-07-29, Discussion,"Hi guys,


I want to share a story from after the race that myself and my family experienced at the Spa GP. I want to preface it by saying that we all had a great overall time at Spa (it was my second visit and the others first) and we will definitely be back, however:  



Myself and my group were in the Gold 3 stand (weekend tickets) and luckily as we were leaving we saw a disabled person pushing another disabled person in a wheel chair just to the rear of the grandstand walking towards where the your tickets were scanned. This is obviously a very steep hill, as such if the person had carried on pushing the wheel chair this would have ended up in a huge accident as they could not have gotten them down the hill. With thousands of other fans leaving at the same time this would have caused some serious injury to both of the men and other fans.

 

Luckily for the 2 men, myself and my family noticed this and offered to help them. After wheeling them down the hill we realised we obviously had no idea where to take them as surely the organiser would be responsible for getting these people too their grandstand and from their vehicle. Unfortunately both gentleman had issues with speech (as well as being French and we are British) so communication was incredibly hard. We eventually managed to figure out that they had been transported from the Les combes car park park and ride area (about a 45 minute walk) by the red cross. So we found some security guards in the hopes they could point us towards the red cross who we would have assumed had a vehicle capable of transporting them.



 

After spending 15 minutes talking with the red cross the outcome was that we could wait 90 minutes and there would be a chance they could take them (they implied it wasn't likely) or they would have to find their own way back to their vehicle. This was obviously not acceptable as at this point it was already 6pm and us not knowing when the park and ride finished we couldn't risk getting there and then having no idea where the gentleman's car was. So we opted to push the wheel chair and assist the gentleman in walking back, even though the walk would obviously tire the man out beyond what's acceptable for him to then drive home.

 

On the walk back we passed 2 red cross medic areas, the first one, the only help they offered was some foil blankets (which I had to request) as the gentleman in the wheel chair was clearly visibly very very cold, they did not have a wheel chair or anything useful to help us get the other man back (who could walk but had leg braces and struggled). The 2nd red cross medic area recognised the man, so they were clearly the ones who helped him get to Gold 3 to begin with, however when we questioned them on why they had not thought about the obvious fact they'd need to get home they stopped engaging with us in English and refused to help any further, claiming 10 of them needed to man the station at all times, they also did not have a wheel chair we could use.

 

So we carried on walking them back to the park and ride, luckily getting one of the final busses of the evening, so had we waited for the potential help from red cross and it not come, they would not have been able to get back to the car park. By the end of the walk we were having to carry the man who could walk because he was exhausted, overall it took 2 hours to get them back. The only positive interaction we had with any staff member from Spa was one of the shuttle bus stewards who was very helpful in getting them on the bus and then ensuring that people on the bus would help them on the other side, as we could not board the bus, since we were staying in green camping.

Overall myself and my family are appalled at the level of accessibility at the track and have never encountered a worse situation. Had we not been there at the right time to help these 2 men out, they at worse would have had a huge incident leaving Gold 3 and at best just never got back to their car. Out of the 15-20 staff members we spoke to (who were mostly polite just not helpful) only 1 was any real help. We were even refused to push them back on the track to green camping (which would have been much smoother and quieter making the walk a lot easier).

I have posted this for some visibility at the issue, while having also emailed Spa.","['Also was there, and had an overall amazing experience. \n\nBut agreed - the majority of security/staff were bloody useless.

Rude bastards.

Luckily we know how to navigate it and we were home within 2,5 hrs of race finish, but indeed access is abysmal. On Saturday, we couldn’t even access Gold 1 directly, the road was blocked for an unknown reason. We had to walk all the way around to the fanzone. Then when we came to the entrance of Gold 1, the road was opened again, so we basically nearly missed the sprint for nothing. Glad we were on time though.\n\nIt’s not just this event either. We went to Werchter Boutique a couple of weeks ago and had to wait (standing dead still) on the parking lot for 2 hours before traffic even started moving and we could leave the parking lot.', 'I agree logistics are a nightmare at Spa. I’m convinced that the main reason for the traffic congestion is because everyone wants to park as close to the circuit as possible. Because there’s only one main road, this means the shuttle busses are stuck in the same traffic jam as all the cars and the people on foot. There’s enough possibilities for tarmac parking further away and organise continuous shuttle busses. This would be way more efficient. \n\nBtw, we went by bike. It was awesome, with beautiful sights and should really be promoted more.', 'Thank you for your efforts dedication and persistence. Rare proof of humanity. Your group probably saved two lives.

Caveats.  
I have the full data set from the very first race but did it from 1980 to simplify the calculations of max total points as there have been races where teams had 3 drivers etc.   
Only Grand Prix results no Sprints included.  
No fastest Lap points.  
This is using the current points system only.  


  
Calculations are very simple. Total number of races for each year multiplied by 43 for constructors or 25 for drivers as the total points available for each season.

Then using corrected points for the current system calculated what every constructor or driver would have gotten and just did (points/available points)\*100
