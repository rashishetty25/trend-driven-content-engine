Sprints are also excluded - this affects Hulkenberg (6th Austria 23 sprint) Zhou (9th in China 24 Sprint) Ricciardo, Gasly, Sargeant (4th, 9th, 10th Miami 24 Sprint). Sprints are excluded because again, consistency of measurement towards all the previous formats.

Only races where the driver started are included - a WD does not break the streak, or count towards it, so Sargeant in Australia 24 didn’t make his stint an extra race longer, but also didn’t stop the streak.

Additionally, if the streak is equalled by another of the same length, the most recent is used (this only affects Sainz, who had another 6 race stint from Canada 2015).

Non rookies who had their longest streak during the most recent season are:

* Stroll (ongoing)
* Bottas (ongoing)
* Hulkenberg (Ended in Saudi)
* Albon (Ended in Monaco)
* Gasly (Ended in Monaco)
* Ricciardo (Ended in Canada)
* Zhou (Ended in Qatar)

Drivers with 1+ full season on the grid who had their longest streak occur partially during their rookie season are:

* Verstappen
* Ocon 
* Sargeant
* Piastri
* Leclerc
* Russell (his first points were for Mercedes in 2020 Sakhir, and he has the honour of being 3rd on the list of most races before scoring points).

Plus obviously the 2024 rookies! This was fairly interesting to me as I assumed most streaks would be in the poorer cars rookies typically end up in.

F2 is a way for me to know some of the faces who could potentially move up the ladder into various series, be it F1, WEC or Indycar. It is also a way for me to watch how those Mecachrome engines are going to screw up the race of a driver\n\nF2 can be interesting to watch because these drivers tend to shake things up by doing crazy manoeuvres. You'll be surprised to see how much the qualifying order can differ from the racing order sometimes.  \n\nI don't really keep up with F3 well due to the lack of time on my end. And I don't really watch so much of F2 and F1A; just the couple of odd races here and there, with some highlights to top it all off. I do wish that initiatives are taken to improve car models and quality of parts that goes into the car. Some of them can really be of low quality until it disadvantages the driver\n\nAlso, Mecachrome."", ""I enjoy F2 for a multitude of reasons. The grid is really fluid, barely anyone does more than 2 seasons, I can watch tomorrow's stars earlier, the teams are closer to each other, the races are exciting most of the time. I even managed to convince my boyfriend to watch with me."", 'The only way to spark more interest is to televise it. But since FOM doesn’t own F2/F3/Academy, that will never happen. The solution would be for those series to sell their media distribution rights to FOM and bulk package F1/F2/Academy into the FOM distribution deals. Networks must either show it live for full replay online for free.\nHell get someone’s 7 year old kid to stream the feed to stream it to Twitch.\n\nIt is genuinely shocking how little F2/F3/Academy understand this simple concept.', 'Watched entirety of F1 2024 season. For F2, I relied mostly on YouTube highlights. I liked watching F2 highlights primarily because of a young and hungry set of passionate drivers that aren’t afraid of unorthodox tactics and spectacular  overtakes….']",0,45,0.44,0,44,44,0,2,0.04999999999999999,0
1hp0ysv,Do you think Ferrari Will have Number 1 driver if they are in a championship fight?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hp0ysv/do_you_think_ferrari_will_have_number_1_driver_if/,2024-12-29, Discussion,"Let's say that Charles Is in a championship fight, and Hamilton Is out of contention in terms of points, do you think Ferrari will have a hard time asking Lewis to help Charles in the last few races ( also the other way round) like swapping positions, saying out longer to slow down others like Checo in 2021, or the other driver will refuse, because i think both of them do not come into the year thinking they will be the Number 2 , the question Is , will they do It to help the team , if needed, or not?","['If only one driver is in realistic contention, then yes, they will have team orders. The other driver won’t like being given them but it is a realistic thing to instruct them to do.\n\nThey’re not going to be able to do it if the other driver is still in contention.', 'If one of them is mathematically out of contention for the wdc I think they’ll follow team orders. If it’s earlier in the season and both are mathematically still in it I think there will be a lot more hesitation to use team orders at all, unless it’s a really clear split where one is 80+ points ahead of the other and within 25 points of the championship leader', 'We are checking.', 'Yes historically in 2007/2008 the deal between the drivers was whoever was ahead after Monza would be the nominee. \n\nAs Marko said, really Verstappen has a massive advantage having that arrangement essentially from race 1.', ""You're assuming ferrari will have a coherent strategy."", ""I mean, it's not like Ferrari never did that before..."", 'I believe in Fred for this kind of scenarios.He will lead them for whats best for the team and both will understand and respect that.', ""Lewis is still a great driver but he's not at his peak. Nobody peaks at 40 in elite sport. \n\nIf it's important, Charles is the main man for Ferrari."", 'See 2007, 2012, 2016 for the answer to your question.']",0,51,0.42,0,47,47,0,1,0.010000000000000009,0
