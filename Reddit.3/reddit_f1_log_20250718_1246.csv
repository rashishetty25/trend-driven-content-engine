I am facing a bit of a conundrum about my future. For context: I am a (going into in September) third year Aerospace student at Bristol university and want to work in F1 as an aerodynamicist or something similar - technical side. Currently I am on track for a 1st class degree and am on the bachelors course (3 years).

I have not had any experience in F1 but am shadowing a GT3 team race weekend and have done a 7 week research internship which involved wind tunnels and aeroelastic testing this summer. I am part of my university's equivalent to formula student and will be aerodynamics lead next year.  I am also press manager for my university's FS AI team although I don't really do much technical stuff and regularly volunteer/participate in engineering outreach activities. My third year individual project is going to be F1 related. 

1) Do I ask to change course to 4 years and apply for F1 placements between my 3 and 4 years? I do not really like the idea of staying in the same city for so long and don't want to feel too comfortable if that makes sense. 

2) Do I apply for grad roles off the bat with no F1 experience?

3) Do I apply for MSc Advanced Computational Methods at Imperial to bolster CV? I really like all the modules listed for this course and want to live in London for a year of my life 

I'm currently thinking of applying for grad roles and the MSc and just doing 3 years at Bristol but this summer in the engineering department has really made me love the uni and made my decision harder.

Any input would be appreciated! Be as harsh and realistic as you want!

Thanks","[""I'm an F1 Engineer, did this for 3 teams and still doing so.\n\nIgnore the negativity people spread here, they are clueless and possibly never entered an F1 facility once in their life.\nDo not believe who says the stress is unbearable and the pay is peanuts, this is completely false.\n\nEnd your studies first of all. Get a MEng degree too. Do not stop at bachelor's. This will make you more valuable on the market and your Aerospace path will make you both good for F1 and versatile if you decide to change career one day. So I'd stick to that.\nAdvanced Computational Methods sounds good to get in a CFD role, so if you like that, go for it.\n\nOnce done, look for early-career programs, basically most teams have one. Apply endlessly, write convincing presentation letters and differentiate them for the team and role you're applying for. Follow up with recruiters on LinkedIn, message them.\nLook for possibilities of redacting master's or bachelor's thesis at an F1 team.\nRemember, as every job search, it is a game of numbers: the more you apply, the more active you are, the more people you connect with, the higher the chances.\nCreate your own opportunities, things won't come at you by themselves.\n\nYour Aerospace studies are perfect to get into F1, there are many engineers, top and entry level, that I know that did your same path.\n\nOther tips: avoid pursuing an on track career if you plan on having a good work-life balance. Tbf most roles are not track roles so definitely not an issue.\nIt is not true that the pay is lower than the aerospace sector. If it is, I'm sure it is in the +-15% range. And remember: doing something you love and are passionate about is just like going to play every day, which is worth more than money.\nAlso having F1 in your CV makes you appear God-like to any future employers, even in a completely different field. And this has a big value by itself.\n\nBe careful with Formula Student: many students think it will open their doors, but often it turns out to consume a lot of the time they should use to prepare their exams instead. So do it as a plus, if you can keep up with the core part of your studies. I personally didn't do it and it didn't really change the outcome a bit.\n\nLast but not least: surround yourself of loving and supportive people, cut out negativity and be determined to show your passion and knowledge.\nAll of this is based on my experience and not perception."", 'I\'ll just answer the part for grad roles: Yes, no F1 experience is required to get into the grad roles, that\'s what they are for! Obviously, having motorsport experience or any experience from your Uni that shows that you are really invested into motorsports (and good enough at that) would still be what interviewers are looking for and improve your chances of getting in.\n\nIf you\'re dead set to get into F1, applying for the placement program is imo the best way to bolster your chances.

1m2aa3j,What is your go to racing news site that isn't focused on clickbait or politics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m2aa3j/what_is_your_go_to_racing_news_site_that_isnt/,2025-07-17, Discussion,"For years I've wanted to keep up with other racing series, but I have very little time to sit down and try to watch dozens of races to figure out who is who, which teams are good, etc. I'm a Dad that coaches for two baseball teams. I have time to read through a news feed (at work), and get to watch most F1 races, but can't watch full races outside of that.

Example: sitting down to watch a full WEC race is just not going to happen for me. They are really good at posting highlights, and the racing+strategy looks great. But, since I have no idea who is involved or strong, or bad, I have no context to whether the guy in the lead is a dominator or a shocker. 

Motorsport used to be a decent resource, but I stopped going there when I had to dig through all the BS, team politics and possibly clickbait articles to get to good stuff. I'm in tune with F1, so when they put something out I have a decent idea whether that article is reasonable. WEC, DTM, Indy... no idea.

So Reddit, how do you reliably keep up with your secondary racing series of choice?","[""Usually reddit's first comments are pretty solid clickbait filters\n\nWhy rely on paid actors when actual humans can do it"", 'I keep up with all racing by using Reddit and following official Twitter accounts.', 'Racefans is quite good.', 'For WEC specifically sportscar365 and onlyendurance are great sites.', 'I know people love to complain about them here but I really like The Race.
