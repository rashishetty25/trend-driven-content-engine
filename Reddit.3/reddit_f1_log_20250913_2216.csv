The Stewards agree with Williams’ characterisation of the collision as a racing incident. \n\n29. The Stewards are satisfied that the collision was caused by a momentary loss of control by Car 30. However, in the Stewards’ assessment, no driver was wholly or predominantly to blame for that collision. Car 55 contributed to the incident by taking the risk to drive close to, and on the outside of, Car 30 when Car 55 had no right to room there and there was a real possibility that, if the collision had not occurred where it did, Car 55 would run out of track at the exit and/or a collision would have occurred at the exit for which the Driver of Car 55 would likely be predominantly if not wholly to blame. \n\n30. The time penalty imposed by the Decision was served by Car 55 during the race. The Stewards have no power to remedy that served time penalty by amending the Classifications but note that the gap between Car 55 to the car ahead in the Final Classification of the race (coincidently Car 30) was 17 seconds.

I'm a long time f1 fan, and enjoy learning about the technical side of things.

Which leads me to my question, in nature sharks have developed a sandpaper like texture to their skin which actually creates small vortices and reduces drag.
This has been replicated in high tech swimming costumes and even boat hulls.

Would this work with air rather than water?

I don't know if the principles of fluid dynamics translate to aero...

Imagine having localized areas of the car that reduce drag directing air to where it can be a benefit like the floor and wings etc...

Anyway, would love any input from anybody familiar with what I'm talking about
","['Shark skin textures reduce surface drag. \n\nSurface drag is not the primary limitation in F1’s aerodynamic performance. \n\nAnd the shark skin texture is not used in boat hulls. Bio fouling quickly ruins it. There’s a startup trying to sell cling film that claims to prevent bio fouling but basically all the early adopters have had to rip it off their hulls because it fouls up quickly.', ""Air is a fluid. Principles generally translate, but the scale and severity is different. Simple as that.\n\nWater generally gets treated as incompressible where air is compressible, so there are some differences there. But what you're talking about is vortex generators which very much exist in aero applications and are already used where relevant on F1 cars."", 'In case it helps, you can also try r/F1Technical', ""> Imagine having localized areas of the car that reduce drag directing air to where it can be a benefit like the floor and wings etc...\n\nThe front of the car (e.g. front wing and leading edge and edges of the floor, etc.) do this to a very large extent. For example, the front wing provides downforce, but also conditions the flow rearwards so that downstream elements perform better. \n\nHere's a slightly better explanation (that also mentions shark skin surface treatment):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMEPKK2378Q&t=852s"", ""I think it would interrupt the air which in swimming increases buoyancy, which lift or upsetting the air would be a pure negative.\n\nI remember one of the big problems with the suits was the buoyancy, not necessarily the drag.\n\nA flat clean surface means, you know exactly what the air is doing, any sort of pitted surface creates havoc and wouldn't be able to properly be mapped from front to rear."", 'The company I work for produces a foil that is put on airplanes to reduce fuel consumption.

Since the early 90s F1 teams have been very consciously trying to reduce the amount of weight that paint adds to the car (to the extremes of having the largely black clad machines of recent years) and having a thick textured layer would absolutely work against that.

How is it possible that over the course of the season, some team's cars become worse than they were at the start of the season, like the aston martin in 2023? Can't they simply revert the changes that made the car slower and go back to the state where the car was faster initially? They clearly shouldn't have lost the knowledge or data on how the car exactly worked. Same for Williams this year, it is claimed that the car was very strong at the start of the season, and now got worse with time, how can that be and why can't they simply revert the car to how it was at the start?","['the other cars get faster.', 'Generally, all teams improve during a season. Some teams improve more than others. With the gaps being so close, having a ""bad"" upgrade can cost a team many places.', ""Imagine it's a straight line drag race \n\nTwo cars both go 100mph\n\nThey look roughly equal as the season starts \n\nThen both teams deliver an upgrade. Team A now go 105mph and team B go 110mph \n\nIt looks like team A got slower despite actually being faster than the start of the season.\n\nThis is what's happening only with much smaller margins and across many many areas of car performance rather than just mph"", 'Often the car does not get worse, but rather the other cars are getting faster in comparison.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that some upgrades are just complete failures. This means that the car gets for example, faster in theory with a new part, however the car could also get harder to drive, so that the lap times could even be slower with the ""upgrade""\n\nThis is probably currently happening at Red Bull, where the car is, in theory, rather ""fast"".   \nHowever, all the upgrades made the car extremely hard to drive, so only Max is able to use 100 % of the car\'s potential.', '1. Out developed by other teams.\n2. Wrong upgrade during season pushes them back', 'Williams didn’t get worse over the course of this season so that’s an odd example. They’ve been fairly consistently best of midfield in race pace. Having some reliability issues and challenges with tire preparation during qualifying doesn’t mean the car has gotten slower.', 'I suspect there’s a point where the teams stop developing the current season’s car and pour those resources into next season’s car. \n\nOf course where they are in the current season’s manufacturer/driver standings has a lot to do with what they decide. \n\nHow good/bad a team is can be determined by the points gap to the next team/driver.', ""It's quite rare that cars actually get slower; look at how rarely they revert upgrades. I think it happened with the Mercedes this season, but generally speaking they don't do that."", ""Perhaps we should end at the same track as we start, in the same conditions and everything. Then we'll see."", 'The Aston Martin apparently had a flexi front wing/nose assembly quietly removed which also contributed to the drop in performance that year.']",0,20,0.44,0,20,20,0,0,0.0,0
1nfng4o,Would my gender be a barrier to becoming an F1 commentator?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nfng4o/would_my_gender_be_a_barrier_to_becoming_an_f1/,2025-09-13, Discussion,"Hi :) I’m a South Korean student who just started uni, and I’ve been a passionate Ferrari fan for as long as I can remember. I absolutely love formula 1 and cars in general, and my dream is to one day become an F1 commentator.

My English is close to native level, and I’ve been told I have great diction. But due to the current gender conflict/polarizations in South Korea, I started questioning my dream. Would being a woman be a barrier if I try to pursue commentary in F1? Or are there any similar examples? I’d really appreciate your thoughts and advice.

EDIT : I realize being a commentator/becoming one is not an easy path AT ALL, and I’m posting this with that on my mind. I’m asking because I can’t change my gender but I can work my way up with effort for the hardships. ","['Women commentate on F1 and other sports already so I wouldn\'t say that in itself is a barrier. But is likely to be very competitive.\n\nI went to school with Alex Jacques and I remember him saying once (during one of those classes where the teacher is going round getting everyone to say what job they\'re planning on once they\'re older and how they plan to achieve it etc) that he wanted to be a TV sports commentator, and the end goal was F1. We would have been about 14? We\'re now 36 for reference of age and time.\n\nTeacher was typical with the sort of ""oh that\'s interesting, what\'s the plan, is there a more realistic back up plan"" sort of thing but he obviously bloody did it.\n\nAlex wasn\'t a friend at school, more of an  acquaintance in the same class, so I don\'t know him well or exactly how he got to where he is, but I think he\'s worked his way up from the very bottom and started out doing student radio at his university and then doing local radio sports commentary for small local teams for basically any sport there was going', ""Within Korea, or elsewhere? I don't think being a woman is a disadvantage, but its a long way up the ladder to do F1. If you can get invovled in broadcasting or any smaller, local events in your area that would be a start to get into the community and develop your skills."", ""Alex Jacques could be a good inspiration as he isn't like Coulthard or Palmer who were actual F1 drivers before. But yea, I think your gender is the least of your concerns, you need reps under your belt to show you're capable and a way to be seen, so I think maybe starting a YouTube channel and commentating the races to your viewers would be a way to build experience. Best of luck!"", 'Commentators are either journalists or ex drivers/engineers. Consider which field you would prefer to settle for/grind in the likely event that you can’t get it.', ""Can't comment on South Korea, but the British broadcasts do have a few women in their presenting teams.  \nCredentials might be a bigger issue. AFAIK almost all these women had been involved in professional motorsports before joining the broadcasting team, either as racers or part of the pit wall. The only exception I know of is Laura Winter from F1TV and even she was a professional athlete before. She used to be a rower, then did rowing commentating after retiring and transferred over to motorsports after that."", ""F1TV's lead commentator is a woman, I don't think that's an issue anymore\n\nbut getting into F1 is very difficult, you need to go through many sports below that before even having a chance, like the drivers or marshalls would have to do"", 'No it could even help, but probably whats most important is that you have passion and skill.', ""I understand Korea is a bit extra to say the least so I don't know how hard it would be, however, outside it should be easier, there will always be some barriers and some misogyny"", 'Grind up the ladder, many sports commentators do ski, tennis, all sorts of odd ball sports.
