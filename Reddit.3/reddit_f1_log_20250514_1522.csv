Mansell at this point was far and away the oldest driver on the grid, more than five years older than Martin Brundle and Roberto Moreno.\n\n\n\nMansell then signed with McLaren as their title sponsor Marlboro wanted a World Champion (while the team themselves and their engine supplier were opposed to the idea). Mansell was to be teamed with future champion Mika H√§kkinen.\n\n\n\nThe 1995 season began in an embarrassing fashion for the team as Mansell could simply not fit into the car, and Mark Blundell drove the first two races in his stead. Mansell's first start for Mclaren in Imola didn't end well as he collided with Eddie Irvine with a points finish in sight, only finishing 10^(th). Frustrated with the car's handling and uncompetitiveness, Mansell came into the pits on lap 18 of the Spanish Grand Prix, got out of the car and called it quits. Mark Blundell was once again called up, finishing off the rest of the season for the team, ironically having to make way for David Coulthard in 1996.\n\n\n\nMany years later, in 2015, Mansell said he regretted this decision and that he should've continued on, attempting to improve the car.\n\n\n\nMansell tested on the very same track for the Jordan team a year later, but decided against a comeback, despite the team's sponsors being willing to pay for his services."", 'Now there‚Äôs a mustache you could set your watch to.', '30 years ago we had 2 of the best mustaches to ever race in their respective sports.

Signed to Aston Martin's development program, but could probably be bought out pretty easily because he won't be getting promoted any time soon. Would need to finish P5 or higher this season to get a license outright (or P6 with practice points to compensate.) I expect Crawford to be the safety valve if Herta and Andretti choke that badly\n\nMeanwhile, all you have to do is expand your search outside the US of A, and you have so many wonderful options available to you: F2 champions like Drugovich and Pourchaire; drivers with test/practice experience like Iwasa, O'Ward and Schwartzman; Alex Palou, who's dominating the entire Indycar field like it ain't no thang.

It's very readable, the contrast between all the colours is a lot better and it's shorter because only the lap counter is shown and not the big unnecessary F1 race logo (if you're watching a race, you'll know it's an F1 race... You really don't need that logo to know that) at the top that is kind of wasted space, and the gaps between the positions are not as big leading to as timing tower that doesn't extend to the bottom of the screen and isn't unnecessarily big.¬†


Also some other points:


- When the current tyres are shown, the tyre compounds symbols are so much more readable with the red/yellow/white ring around the letter that indicates the compound instead of that flimsy letter in the tyre colour we have now (where especially red does not nearly have enough contrast to the black background), the time gap is also shown to one decimal (for example 2.0) so you know the rough timing gaps AND the tyre compounds at the same time. (Also no CGI tyre compounds at the begin of the race, looks much better)¬†


- The numbers indicating the drivers' position have a white background which makes them much easier to read.¬†


- The timing background is a bit transparent so you can see some stuff that's happening when something is behind the tower.¬†


- Yellow flags actually display the sector where the yellow is shown... Why would you not show that in this year's version? Why would you only show that there's a yellow somewhere on track but not where?¬†


- The \^‚ñºindicating how many places¬† a driver has lost/gained relative to their starting position is much more readable. The ones whe have now are way to thin and the red doesn't have enough contrast in comparison to the black background, leading to bad readability.¬†


- I feel the font for the timing gaps is a tad bolder/thicker which definitely helps readability.¬†


- The inly thing I'd probably keep from the current tower might be the team logos instead of team colour stripes.


What else I'd change about the current timing tower:


- When showing battles for x position (for example battle for third) - the timing gap in the tower dissappears. So you don't know how big the gap is when two cars are fighting, even though it's pretty much the most important thing imaginable to know the gaps at that moment. So¬† it would be nice if these could be displayed again (I have seen some inserts at the bottom of the screen that do show the gaps, but they aren't always there and I'd still like them to be displayed on the actual tower, so I can keep an eye on the rest of the gaps more easily).¬†


- In qualifying, instead of showing IN LAP and OUT LAP in the space where the lap times should be, show a little symbol with I or O next to the timing gaps similarly to the P that is shown to indicate someone in their pit box.¬†


- Show us +5/+10 next to the driver's name when they get a penalty they haven't served yet. I really thought we had that in recent years, but I can't find it anywhere so maybe I'm imagining things.¬†

In 2025, the Formula 1 World Championship is a multi-billion-dollar industry, criss-crossing the globe over a 24-race season that captures worldwide attention every grand prix weekend.

The drama created by the world's best racing drivers is documented in the Netflix series Drive to Survive, which has helped the sport grow further in popularity in recent years. An F1 movie, starring Brad Pitt, is due to be released next month.

It's a far cry from its beginnings in 1950, when just seven races made up the first World Championship. It began with the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on 13 May, watched by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and won by Italian Giuseppe Farina.

From Farina in 1950 to Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Lando Norris in 2025, F1 has produced thrills, controversy and tragedy. Here, BBC Sport and Getty Images tell the story of the sport, and the characters that have illuminated it, through a selection of the best photographs from the past 75 years.",['75th repost anniversary'],26,2,0.77,26,1,1,3,0,0.030000000000000027,3

1kmfd97,Lewis Hamilton comment on Max Verstappen‚Äôs driving style in interview for Netflix‚Äôs Drive to Survive Season 4 ‚ÄúGloves Are Off‚Äù bears striking similarities to Lando Norris‚Äô comment after Miami GP 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmfd97/lewis_hamilton_comment_on_max_verstappens_driving/,2025-05-14, Discussion,"I only post this because as I‚Äôm rewatching DTS on Netflix, Lewis‚Äô comment about his huge crash with Max, that came close to killing Lewis if not for the halo, reminded me so much of what Lando said recently about Max during the debacle at the first/second turn of the Miami Grand Prix two weeks ago.

Lewis says, ‚ÄúMax is kind of do or die. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre either crashing or you‚Äôre‚Ä¶or you‚Äôre not going by.‚Äù Lando says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crash or don‚Äôt pass with Max,‚Äù and of course so many people gave him shit especially when Oscar managed to ‚Äúeasily‚Äù pass Max later on in the race to then go on to win.

It‚Äôs no secret that race control and the stewards let Max get away with a lot of shit that I would argue played a large part in why he brought home his first championship in 2021 and why he continued to dominate in the years following, but if a 7 time F1 Drivers Champion, whose more than proven himself in this sport, shares a very similar sentiment about Max and his not only aggressive but dangerous race craft, why did so many people give Lando so much shit? And continue to give him shit even going on to discuss things like he‚Äôs not mentally fit to be champion, no longer #1, etc etc. 

I‚Äôm incredibly confused by the phenomena. I suppose it can simply boil down to people simply hate on Lando because he‚Äôs Lando, but I found that specifically the reaction to that statement to be the most bizarre?
