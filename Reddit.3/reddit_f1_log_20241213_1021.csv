1hctnit,Sergio Perez brings an estimated $30-40 million USD in merchandise and sponsorships alone whilst Verstappen lost sponsorships for Red Bull in 2024. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hctnit/sergio_perez_brings_an_estimated_3040_million_usd/,2024-12-12, Misinformation,"Dutch supermarket Jumbo [withdrew](https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1043062/1/verstappen-s-longtime-sponsors-explain-why-deal-ended) its financial support this year and while Verstappen still has personal sponsorhips, they're not directly tied to Red Bull. 

As for the Perez-specific Red Bull sponsors, they reportedly cover Perez's approximately $10 million annual salary and still leave $30m extra for the team and according to the Spanish sports newspaper [Marca](https://www.marca.com/en/f1/2024/11/10/673136f822601d8e4a8b4574.html), multiple new sponsors for 2025 have now signed up with Red Bull. Horner is said to have just given the green light to start production of 2025-spec team clothing and merchandise featuring the new sponsors' names, and one of them is a big, major sponsor that will join the likes of Grupo Carso (Carlos Slim's group). 

Basically, Checo is bringing enough sponsorship money to pay for half of Max's salary -- perhaps more! 

That's why Checo's group is asking around £15.7m (some sources have them at $75m USD!) to leave the team because they would definitely need to pay up all those sponsors who have already signed on for 2025. That's a lot of money just to have the privilege to put Lawson in that seat. 

Can Red Bull sustain the loss of Checo's backing? Perhaps but if they really wanted Lawson or even Ricciardo in that seat, they could've already cut Checo and their sponsors loose (incluing Disney and Ford). Something tells me it's not an easy task for Horner. ","['Yeah. I live in Mexico City and I can’t go a day without seeing Checo’s face somewhere.

1hcs00b,Has Ben Sulayem overestimated his power?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hcs00b/has_ben_sulayem_overestimated_his_power/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"Ben Sulayem made some interesting comments today about the FIA not having the funds to employ permanent stewards, so I thought I’d share a few thoughts on where his presidency seems to be heading.

Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run. Sulayem’s approach as president has been… combative, to say the least. A lot of his decisions seem more about ego than actually serving the role. He’s alienated key stakeholders and made governance changes that look like attempts to shield himself from accountability, which hasn’t done much for his reputation—or the FIA’s, for that matter.

Honestly, his position feels shaky. The next FIA elections are still a year away, and maybe he won’t face serious opposition, but the level of discontent right now suggests bigger problems within the organization. What we’re seeing play out publicly is probably just the surface.

At the end of the day, his authority isn’t limitless. The drivers and teams are the ones who really hold the power in F1, and history shows they aren’t afraid to push back when they’re unhappy—even to the point of threatening to leave the sport entirely. Sulayem seems to be gambling a lot by antagonizing them, and I’m not sure he fully understands just how strong their influence is.

This whole power struggle seems like it will rumble on over the off season. The longer it drags on, the more damage it could do—not just to his presidency, but to F1 itself.

I’m interested to hear others thoughts on the topic. How do you see this playing out, and could the FIA find itself in real trouble if things don’t change?","[""> Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run.\n\nThat's just sorta politics though, it always looks like something has to give, but the reality is Formula 1 is only a part of the FIA, and only relevant to a few of its wealthiest member nations/constituent clubs of which there are some 250 from 147 countries. Things look to be at a breaking point, then a few things elsewhere get shuffled around in the background and suddenly everyone's happy.\n\nIs F1 important? Is it the single most important FIA activity? Yeah, probably, but as F1 fans we're still only seeing a fraction of the FIA's overall purview. If the Ugandan Karting scene doesn't have the same beef with Sulayem that Formula One does, he's not going to have much problem being reelected."", ""A very important point is that the FIA president first and foremost serves the FIA members and not F1. F1 doesn't have much of a say, the member clubs elect the president and their leadership team. And so far it does in fact not look like Ben Sulayem is in danger of losing reelection next year. I would recommend reading this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5xbgv/jeppe_olesen_on_the_back_of_all_the_mbs/)regarding the FIA presidential elections."", ""The teams and commercial side breaking away is a popular Reddit power fantasy. The unfortunate reality of it is that the FIA owns F1 both as a series and a brand, and Indycar's shown us that *everyone* is worse off for a split - but especially the commercial side.\n\nThis is why the teams and FOM do not hold the power some people think they do. They can threaten to break away, haggle and negotiate, sure, but a breakaway involves far too much money lost for them to ever really make good on it. The FIA technically isn't a for-profit organisation. That's why the FIA president can get away with just about everything short of murder, and MBS simply hasn't done anything stupid enough to make his position truly untenable."", 'I think a lot of folks here want to believe the FIA and MBS is the problem. The issue is likely far more complicated. A lot of the issues are more the problem with the FOM than the FIA. Paying for full time FIA stewards is something that the FIA should address with the FOM. The FIA is a non-profit, it cannot simply ""get revenue and add costs"" from nowhere. The FOM should pay for the full time stewards for F1 and that is a project that the FIA rightly addresses. \n\nThe ENTIRETY of the FIA (including all motorsports not only F1) has about 300 full time employees. Their annual budget runs into the 150-200m Euro range. The annual income after taxes is less than 10m Euro (2023). For comparison this is smaller than a single F1 team\'s annual budget.\n\nIf the FIA has to hire 3-4 full time stewards, fly time to every F1 venue, this would very likely cost them several million Euro a year. It isn\'t hard to see why the FIA needs the FOM to pony up this kind of expense.', 'As much as MBS is unpopular to fans. Neither was Blatter or Infantino right now for FIFA. David Stern of NBA also was not popular. It took quite a bit of scandal to finally see the end of Mosley. \n\nReality is, fans are not the stakeholders the presidents/commissioner etc answer to, their unpopularity is irrelevant to the job they perform. Though I feel MBS is a bit different in that a lot of his unpopular moves seems to be about him specifically rather than necessarily large scale FIA decisions.', 'I’m not sure why he’s being blamed for this when they have *never* had permanent stewards and he is at least starting the conversation around fixing that, albeit with the caveat that the funds have to come from somewhere. Surely this is a reasonable starting point, rather than letting the problem endlessly fester like previous presidents did?\n\nAs for all the resignations and other changes, I still remain open minded as it’s not been very transparent, but the FIA never has been since long before he came in. And any media coverage of him always has a bit of a stink of racism that makes me take it with a pinch of salt. Part of me wonders if he’s just breaking up the old boys club that has been running things without consequence for so long.', ""Hasn't the FIA always been shady? I vaguely remember the whole group B debacle where the FIA was pretty much ignoring spectator and driver deaths since the sport was so popular.

This made me wonder: how many wins did the other champions have before their first championship winning season? The results shocked me a bit: despite Max being considered quite young and inexperienced before 2021, historically speaking he was one of the most experienced winners before starting his championship winning season. In my mind this shows how good he was in inferior machinery during the Merc domination.\n\nLastly, an important note: even if a driver only did 1 race in a season, that is still counted as a season. I can’t be arsed to judge where the limit for a partaking in a season goes, especially with all of the drivers who did like 2 races a season back in the 50’s and 60’s.\n\nNow for the fun facts:\n\nMax Verstappen is the only driver to have more than 7 victories before starting his first championship winning season who hadn't finished runners up or been in a proper championship fight.\xa0\n\nMansell's 21 wins would put him 16th on the all-time win list, tied with Kimi Räikkönen's all time wins.

For Mika, it was the 97 season finale, the very race before his first WDC season, and he only won it because of the Schumacher-Villeneuve crash.\xa0\n\nKeke Rosberg is another driver who really stands out. Unlike most drivers without a victory before their first season, who generally won their debut quite early on in the season, Keke’s first victory came in round 14/16 in 1982. Even crazier, had he finished second, he still would have won the championship, and became the only driver to win the championship while never winning a Grand Prix.\xa0\n\nDespite all the talk about Norris being inexperienced in a winning position, should he win the championship next season he would be pretty average on this list.

He above many other drivers I have seen gives me that vibe of being a fan of the sport living his dream. \n\nSo some of the comments we’ve seen from Lewis recently - especially the one about not wanting to come back after Brazil - have the alarm bells ringing for me. Lewis has been in worse situations in his career and has pushed like hell to overcome the odds, particularly in the first half of 2009 when the car was a complete dog or in 2012 when he had all the bad luck in the world. If he lost motivation then, he sure as hell never let it affect his driving.\n\nThe dip we’ve seen from him since COTA - where I think it would be fair to say he completely embarrassed himself - has been alarming. Since then, we’ve had his ranting on the Brazil team radio, his mess-up in Vegas Q3, his pit lane error in Qatar and his Q1 exit in Abu Dhabi. All very unlike Lewis, and the clear issue seems to be a mental one. I’m getting Mika 2001 kind of vibes - he had some great races too, but you could tell he wasn’t quite the same driver.\n\nIt’s understandable in a sense that Lewis may lack motivation for a team/project he’s leaving, but given his general passion for the sport and given you’d anticipate he’d have had a desire to sign off in the right way with Toto and the boys, I can’t help thinking that there’s something deeper going on here. I can’t help thinking Lewis was trying to force himself to believe he was done with Mercedes when he was in actual fact done with racing. \n\nI also fear Ferrari is a match made in hell for Lewis. Their race day operations are a big downgrade on Mercedes, Leclerc is arguably an even stronger team-mate than George and Ferrari in general is not the kind of environment where a driver is given freedom to express their individuality and opinions in the way Lewis loves to. I can see the allure of the prancing horse inspiring Lewis early on, but the moment a setback occurs or he has his first run-in with the pit wall I fear things could go very south very fast.\n\nI hope very much I am wrong.

1hd5qm5, How Media Influence Has Changed the F1 Fandom — Are We Losing the Essence of the Sport?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hd5qm5/how_media_influence_has_changed_the_f1_fandom_are/,2024-12-13, Discussion,"I’ve been following F1 for a while, but it’s hard to ignore how the increasing media focus on the sport has shifted the way we, as fans, view both the drivers and the racing itself. While the growth of the fanbase is great, I feel like the sport is becoming more about personalities and drama than the actual racing.

1. The Rise of Parasocial Relationships

With all the behind-the-scenes content and personal stories being shared, fans are starting to form one-sided connections with drivers. We feel like we know them, but what we really know is just what’s curated for us. This creates an odd dynamic where fans feel entitled to criticize or praise drivers based on these portrayals, even though they only get a small part of the picture.

2. More Entertainment Than Sport

The sport has started to feel more like a reality show at times. While the drama and rivalries are entertaining, they often overshadow the technical aspects of racing that made F1 so fascinating. The focus seems to be on the personalities rather than the engineering and strategy that are at the heart of the sport.

3. Expectations and Toxicity

With all this emphasis on drama and personal stories, there’s a lot more pressure on drivers to live up to certain personas. Fans now have unrealistic expectations of how drivers should behave, and when they don’t fit these molds, the backlash is intense. This has led to a more polarized, sometimes toxic, fanbase, especially on social media.

4. Impact on Drivers’ Mental Health

The constant spotlight on drivers and their personal lives can take a toll. They’re no longer just athletes; they’re characters in an ongoing narrative, and that’s a lot of pressure to deal with. It’s concerning to think about how all of this impacts their mental well-being.

In the end, I think the growth of F1 is fantastic, but I worry that the sport is losing some of its authenticity. The racing, the skill, and the strategy should always come first. Anyone else feel like media attention has changed F1 in ways that we didn’t expect? Id love to hear everyone’s thoughts and opinions.","[""To answer your question.   \nNo  \n  \nAll the points you've mentioned have existed in F1 well before social media. Social media just made it more obvious."", ""I think all of this has always been the case in F1. The drama, the politics, the characters etc.  It's part of what makes F1(and motorpsort in general) so entertaining. Of course the racing and the cars is the general core of the sport but it's always been the drama it creates that's kept people hooked.\n\nAll what's happened now is that due the increased popularity and social media, how fans interact with the sport is maybe louder than its ever been. But I don't think fans are engaging in the sport really any differently than they used to, it's just more in your face."", 'Both drama and actual racing can coexist. Why do you think that is wrong', '“People don’t follow it in the same way I do and therefore everything is bad”\n\nETA: Half of your post history is you overanalysing some random rapper?

So all that glossy entertainment stuff and the drama side is a gateway drug.\n\nBut yeah as someone already said, all those elements were around pre-social media. James Hunt was a tabloid celebrity. Nothing new under the sun etc etc', ""The media landscape had somewhat evolved, for better or for worse. It is expected, considering a loose formulae of this has existed in the past. But the rise of media attention and the current exposure of the sport is up to the viewer. I'll indulge in your statement for a bit\n\nWhile I can agree that parasocial relationships are compounded due to the rise of social media and the curation of personas that allow the viewer to feel as if they are attuned with a certain driver, this is honestly nothing new. Take a look at rivalries like Senna and Prost, both enigmatic figures who had a narrative on their characters as they both fought it out on track, whilst also delivering sentiments that fuelled their rivalry off-track, and this is just me scratching the surface of the larger picture. This rivalry had stood the test of time until today.\n\nI daresay that you don't usually see the toxicity back then because there wasn't a global platform to collectively share those thoughts, like Twitter and Reddit. I can only imagine that it would have been equally as bad if forums were a thing. I do agree that fanbases online can get out of hand, but this toes a similar line as fanatic behaviour that existed in other landscapes such as music and movies, or maybe even other sports. \n\nAnd funnily enough, if you ask me personally and selfishly, I agree with you on half of these points you brought up, OP! I really do agree that some of the authentic shine is wearing off of the sport because of the latest incidents that points towards the disregard of the established rules of the sport in the name of entertainment *(After all, I came in just to watch good racing and good strategies being played out, not to see catty arguments)*, and I do wish that more emphasis is on the sport as a whole instead of the off-track drama, but this is not a new thing. I have a feeling this used to be a thing last time, but because of social media, it wasn't blatantly obvious."", 'No man chill\n\nF1 was allways ""larger than life"" kind of sport and drivers allways had Rock star kind of fame and treatments   it is just more pronounced now with social media and the internet and all that stuff', ""This is the only correct answer. As an F1 fan for 40 years, I agree the only thing that's changed is how aware we are of it all.\xa0"", 'Right, it’s all more accessible to a global audience now.

1hd8ku3,Lewis and his potential resurgence,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hd8ku3/lewis_and_his_potential_resurgence/,2024-12-13, Discussion,"All the recent talks about Lewis' upcoming move to Ferrari and his potential resurgence has me wondering, has anyone ever actually improved their form so dramatically when they changed teams? The only example I could think of is Vettel in 2015, but I don't think Vettel was that bad in 2014 against Ricciardo, IIRC the quali gap wasn't as big as it is between Russell and Hamilton, and Vettel had multiple mechanical failures in quali. Vettel did look miles better in 2021 compared to 2020, but then again he was measured against Stroll in 2021, and nobody would argue Stroll is in anyway comparable to Leclerc. Keep in mind this question is more about raw pace (quali), we know Lewis is still elite in the race. 


","['Fernando and his 3 podiums in his first 3 races with Aston Martin in 2023?', 'You have to account for some demotivation. Similarly while I don’t believe the conspiracy theories, Lewis was visibly running a different car spec at times to Russel. More than any other top team. I think sainz and Leclerc ran the same spec car all through last year and most of this year (except when upgrades failed and there was some experimentation). So lewis next year will find his car has more consistent behaviour to what his teammate is running. So if it was the car, then he’ll be better but counter point if it was more him then there would be no excuses.', 'Gasly going from RB to TR/AT lmao.

But let’s not act like Lewis Race pace hasn’t been great in the last few races. He’s clearly still a top driver. \n\nIf Ferrari can improve the car and Lewis his quali results then we’ll probably see him fight fort top 3 next season.', 'Id love a Hamilton in Ferrari championship but i dont have much hope', ""No resurgence. Lewis has always been top tier. He's just getting the support he needs from Ferrari."", 'There will be no resurgence, only a slow but noticeable decline. His move to Ferrari has probably come too late to have any real impact on his career, unless somehow Ferrari builds a dominant car. Because in a one-on-one teammate battle, he can step up.

This must be bring down the morale of the whole team, and that means people leaving for greener pastures. The majority of people working at Red Bull want to _win_, not to make more money for the stakeholders and Checo's presence is working against that goal.
