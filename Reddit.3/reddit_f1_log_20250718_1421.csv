1m2yu8x,F1 career as Aerospace Undergrad,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m2yu8x/f1_career_as_aerospace_undergrad/,2025-07-18, Discussion,"Hi all! I am facing a bit of a conundrum about my future. For context: I am a (going into in September) third year Aerospace student at Bristol university and want to work in F1 as an aerodynamicist or something similar - technical side. Currently I am on track for a 1st class degree and am on the bachelors course (3 years).

I have not had any experience in F1 but am shadowing a GT3 team race weekend and have done a 7 week research internship which involved wind tunnels and aeroelastic testing this summer. I am part of my university's equivalent to formula student and will be aerodynamics lead next year.  I am also press manager for my university's FS AI team although I don't really do much technical stuff and regularly volunteer/participate in engineering outreach activities. My third year individual project is going to be F1 related. 

1) Do I ask to change course to 4 years and apply for F1 placements between my 3 and 4 years? I do not really like the idea of staying in the same city for so long and don't want to feel too comfortable if that makes sense. 

2) Do I apply for grad roles off the bat with no F1 experience?

3) Do I apply for MSc Advanced Computational Methods at Imperial to bolster CV? I really like all the modules listed for this course and want to live in London for a year of my life 

I'm currently thinking of applying for grad roles and the MSc and just doing 3 years at Bristol but this summer in the engineering department has really made me love the uni and made my decision harder.

Any input would be appreciated! Be as harsh and realistic as you want!

Thanks","['The book ""How to win a Grand Prix"" by Bernie Collins has an interesting section on the recruitment process for graduates - for that one team at least. \n\nOthers have said this, but get a masters, and follow your dream. However, don\'t be disheartened if you miss out on a graduate role - it is incredibly competitive. There\'s a lot of aerospace in the UK where those qualifications will be valued and there will always be roles that you can apply for in the future. F1 teams don\'t just recruit from other F1 teams. \n\n\nIgnore the naysayers - you\'re doing aerospace engineering at university in the UK whilst getting involved in other Motorsport. You couldn\'t be in a better position to make it happen.', 'I\'ll just answer the part for grad roles: Yes, no F1 experience is required to get into the grad roles, that\'s what they are for! Obviously, having motorsport experience or any experience from your Uni that shows that you are really invested into motorsports (and good enough at that) would still be what interviewers are looking for and improve your chances of getting in.\n\nIf you\'re dead set to get into F1, applying for the placement program is imo the best way to bolster your chances. For one, gives you an idea of if you really want to be doing this (a guy I know swore off the idea of doing it after uni after their placement), and if you prove to be someone they like they\'ll ""reserve"" you for when you graduate.', ""1 - Placements can be incredible, for the life and professional experience they can give you., plus a good way of making sure that F1/Engineering is really what you want to do.  They are hotly contested though so have a plan for other sectors / companies you think you'd also get a lot of learning from.  \nThat said, not everyone working in F1 did a placement year!  \n  \nIt may be a bit late now, but if you're comfortable with cold messaging people on LinkedIn, work your way through the Aero Departments and ask if they would be willing to provide support for your Final Year Project, or if there's a final year project you could do which would feedback into that team. (It does happen!).\n\n2 - Grad Roles are just what they say they are, roles for graduates - you can't ask people for multiple years of F1 XP when they are of standard university leavers age.  There are people who work in F1 who never had any intention of working in it, but they had the right skills to fit the job.  As a grad no one would be expecting you to know **everything** and they won't be measuring you against people who have been there for years.\n\n3 - You could stick to your current BEng course, nail your First, and apply for paid internships at engineering companies.  Do one of those for a year / set number of months, and then move into an MSc of your choosing, potentially with a better idea of what you would like to specialise in. \n\n  \nFormula Student is not a deal-breaker for F1 teams - it's now such a commonly held activity that it doesn't make candidates standout any more - you know yourself, but ensure that if you end up in FS full time that you'll still have the capacity to ace your exams and final year project.

Until Silverstone, testing was conducted with fixed front wings because no one had yet developed a suitable solution. Having to introduce hydraulic actuators in the wing and nose, it would also have been necessary to repeat the front crash test to get the new solution homologated. The FIA, aware that this step would have resulted in an unbearable increase in costs under the Budget Cap regime, granted confidence to the teams, allowing them to intervene on the cars freely. It is possible, therefore, that from the next tests scheduled after the Hungarian GP in Budapest it will be possible to see the first experimental solutions. On the Hungarian track Alpine, McLaren and Racing Bulls will be on stage on Tuesday, while the next day alongside the Enstone team will be only Haas. Ferrari will be busy with the SF-25 mule car in the aftermath of Monza, where Red Bull will also be there, and then also at Mugello, which will be the penultimate event on the calendar before tire homologation: the final outing will be in Mexico.

1m2l188,Trying to Rigorously Predict Next Year's Grid,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m2l188/trying_to_rigorously_predict_next_years_grid/,2025-07-17, Discussion,"I'm trying to game out this year's silly season to see if I can predict the grid makeup for next year. My approach to doing so is to look at each team with an open seat and rank their preferences for drivers, and do the same for each available driver and rank their preferences for teams. If I can come up with full rankings, then we can easily match teams and drivers until all the seats are full.

Of course, by my count, there are 10 seats potentially open at 6 teams (5 if we count the RB teams as one unit for driver choice), and 13 drivers available to fill them. That means that we'd have to rank up to 13 drivers 5 times and 5 teams 13 times to get the full picture. Because it's hard for me to fully think out each actor's preferences, I figured I'd reach out to the community to see if you guys can help form something of a consensus on what we expect the rankings to be.

I'll lay out all of the players, and then go through some of assumptions that I feel safe about making. Once that's done, I can leave it to you guys to argue the other stuff.


So to start, there's five teams (six if we count RBR and VCARB separately, which I don't think we should) that could have open seats next year. Those teams are:

Mercedes (2 seats)

Alpine (1 seat)

Red Bull (4 seats)

Aston (1 seat)

Cadillac (2 seats)

The thirteen available drivers would be:

-The eight drivers on the grid who could end up elsewhere:

Russell

Antonelli

Colapinto

Verstappen

Tsunoda

Hadjar

Lawson

Stroll

-The four former drivers who could return:

Perez

Bottas

Mick Schumacher

Zhou

-Arvid Lindblad, the Red Bull junior who could make his rookie debut


I've made the assumption here that anyone who has a confirmed contract for next year is as secure in that contract as he wishes to be–that teams won't force a buyout to get somebody off the grid. You can probably make an argument that this assumption doesn't hold up in the case of Alonso if Max wants his seat or of the Williams drivers if one of the Mercedes drivers comes knocking, but I think it's a good deal more likely than not that they're all safe. The other assumption that I've made is that Stroll's seat could be made available. I know a lot of people are absolutely convinced that he'll keep driving as long as Lawrence owns the team, but I've long suspected otherwise. I don't think he's super enthusiastic about remaining in the team long term, and I think that he and his dad would be willing to have him step aside should a driver like Max, George, or even Yuki show interest.


With all that in mind, here are some basic assumptions that I've made about everybody's preferences:

-Stroll's only willing to drive for Aston, so there's no point in considering what the other four teams think of him.

-Every team would take Verstappen as their top pick.

-Aside from Lance and Max, every other available driver has Mercedes as their top pick. I think this generally makes sense, as Merc's prospects look way better than any of the other four teams. Max himself seems undecided so far, because if he'd decided on Merc or on any other team, he'd have already signed a contract. We've heard no rumors to that extent, so we can assume that he's still making up his mind.

-Because Merc is the top team with open seats, they get the pick of the field. Aside from Max, I think it's safe to assume that their next two picks would be George and Kimi. If they get Max, one of them will have to go, but otherwise, the two of them will stay. This means that we don't have to consider what the other ten drivers think of Merc, because they're not in the running for a seat.


Anyways, I hope this post helped structure everyone's thinking about silly season, and I'll leave it to you to express your opinions on all the other preferences that we still have to lock down.",['> The four former drivers who could return:\n\n\n>Perez\n\n\n>Bottas\n\n\n>Mick Schumacher\n\n\n>Zhou\n\n\nGod dammit Danny!

So Reddit, how do you reliably keep up with your secondary racing series of choice?","[""Usually reddit's first comments are pretty solid clickbait filters\n\nWhy rely on paid actors when actual humans can do it"", 'I keep up with all racing by using Reddit and following official Twitter accounts.', 'Racefans is quite good.', 'For WEC specifically sportscar365 and onlyendurance are great sites.', 'I know people love to complain about them here but I really like The Race. They have coverage of F1, MotoGP, Indy, Formula E and WEC and podcasts for all of them as well (apart from WEC I think).', ""Racingnews365 ofcourse. Hahaha o no that's a steaming pile of garbage.\n\nHonestly dude, if you find one, let us know."", 'Similar situation as you.

1m2x9q7,"What are general opinions on ""sister-teams"", and could F1 realistically get rid of them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m2x9q7/what_are_general_opinions_on_sisterteams_and/,2025-07-18, Discussion,"Hey, new fan here (started following the sport this season). I always thought it was pretty weird that Red Bull through VCARB essentially have 4 seats in the sport, 2 of which are essentially used as backups for the main team (even though their car seems to be better than the main one this year lol). It seems that some of the other teams do this too to a much lesser extend (Williams for Merc, Haas for Ferrari), with those cases are more of a business partnership rather than straight up owning two teams. I don't really get why teams are able to do this (apart from $$$), because I think that inherently makes F1 less competitive, but I want to know other people's opinions on this. Are there any benefits to having ""sister teams"" or ""development teams"" or whatever you want to call them, and do you think there are ways that they could be removed?","[""The only way to remove them is force Red Bull to sell the team which I don't think would ever go through legally. \n\n\nThey have that team since 2006 where Minardi otherwise would have gone bankrupt and out of the sport without anyone else really trying to own them. \n\nSo basically they saved a team from going bankrupt at a time F1 wasn't lucrative as it is now. Teams spent way more and teams dropped out quickly in the following years because of the economic crisis aswell."", ""Well, if someone has billion plus dollars to cough up for the other team, I see no problem with RB being sold and I  doubt RBR would either. \n\nObjectively, they should be a competitive team and not RBR's crutches or whatever.\n\nHowever...years and years, people keep complaining about the second Red Bull team yet I did not see anyone falling over themselves and rushing to the finish line to buy them when Minardi was on its dying gasp. Red Bull took the chance and risk, and it paid off for them."", 'It was a one off situation\n\nRed Bull came in and saved a team that went bankrupt at the request of F1. Other teams also had the chance but didn’t do it.\n\nI don’t think a team would be allowed to buy another team today\n\nWhen someone does you a favor when you are having a tough time it would be bad if you then tried to reverse it when times are good', 'Outside of VCARB, the others are customers of the engine manufacturers. Having customer teams has always been part of F1 and if every team had to manufacture their own PU, we would not have a lot of the long running teams because the cost and resource to set that up and maintain it is unrealistic. So ya, sometimes there are rookies that go to midfield teams because of team connections, but I don’t really see an issue with it tbh. All the drivers and teams are connected in some way because of how personnel moved around the grid, so it’s always going to have an element of who you know which will help someone land a seat. VCARB is a different story entirely. Minardi needed a buyer, Red Bull came in, it’s been rebranded quite a few times since 2006. Ya, it’s strange for them to be the only sister team on the grid but.. it doesn’t bug me that much or really ever', 'It doesn’t really bother me personally, Redbull also took on a risk to buy a failing team. There were other teams at the time that could have bought the team and done the same thing, but didn’t.\n\nI think people generally make a much bigger deal of it than it is. Plus with how far ahead the top teams are anyway it give a bit more to watch, especially since the VCARB drivers are generally rookies or at least on the young side and I always like seeing how the rookies do.', 'There was a time when a customer with enough money could simply buy a car and race it, as long as they qualified within the allowed slots. One example was the Mexican driver Héctor Rebaque, who founded **""Rebaque""** in 1978 and entered a privateer Lotus 78.\nI see no issue with a private entity owning two or more teams, especially if it helps save jobs and keeps a healthy number of cars on the grid. Or would you prefer just 18 cars instead of the 20 we have now?', 'People have answered your question, but the short answer is that F1 would have been less competitive if Red Bull had not saved Minardi (which after a few name changes became Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team).\n\nKeep in mind that the team has used Ferrari, Renault, and Honda engines.', 'I totally understand your points and I don\'t wanna offer any solution for this since there are always going to be some dependences from some teams to other (like Williams to Merc because they use the engines, friendship/former employment like toto and vowels, or Haas total concept as a team to keep costs low)\n\n\n\nBut I wanna give some context to why the RedBull and Vcarb/Toro Rosso/alpha Tauri situation. Before the budget cap (and Netflix hype) there was a time when not many people would own a team since it was so expensive, and if you were a Midfield or Backmarker team you\'ll still loose tons of money and probably never have a realistic chance at a win. That lead for example lead to the famous 1 dollar sell of Jaguar to Red Bull. When Minardi was struggling Dietmar Mateschitz (owner of Red Bull) decided to buy it aswell since there wasn\'t that much interest from others. Of course Red Bull profits a lot from it, but also the other teams benefit from having a ""junior"" team on the grid if you for example of how many drivers in other teams are former red bull drivers.', 'I love it when people bring that up. Red Bull saved us from only having 9 teams on the grid back in 2006 when nobody wanted Minardi and they were bankrupt. Now that F1 is popular again and the teams actually make money some people have a problem with it. In their minds they were basically only allowed to dump money in the team but not benefit now.', "">I don't really get why teams are able to do this (apart from $$$), because I think that inherently makes F1 less competitive\n\nPre-budget cap Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes were spending over $400 million. Then you had McLaren and Renault spending between $250-300 million. That left Racing Point, AlphaTauri, Williams, Haas, and Sauber with budgets between $130-190 million.\n\nWithout technical partnerships - like the ones between Williams and Mercedes, and Haas with Ferrari - these teams would have been even less competitive. It gave them access to parts and tech they had zero scope of developing themselves, and allowed them to prioritize developing areas of the car that had to be created independently.\n\nEven now in the cost cap era, the facilities at each team's disposal can differ wildly. Vowles pushed to allow exemptions within the cost cap for special projects like building new wind tunnels and simulators, so Williams could upgrade their woefully out of date systems and facilities.\n\nAs for drivers, some of the midfield teams do take on development drivers from their technical partners, but I think that is becoming less of the case as they all have their own junior programs now. Williams haven't had a Mercedes driver since Russell. Latifi and Sargeant were both Williams juniors and they even retained Sargeant over Schumacher who Toto Wolff was lobbying for them to take on.""]",0,17,0.21,0,16,16,0,17,0.21,0
