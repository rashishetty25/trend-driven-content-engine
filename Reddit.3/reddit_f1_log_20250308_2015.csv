1j6km1q,Back of the grid discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j6km1q/back_of_the_grid_discussion/,2025-03-08, Discussion,"6-10 feels very up in the air this year. A lot of talented drivers have shifted further back in the grid. I'd like to hear opinions on how you rank these teams going into the season. I have them like this..

6. Williams
7. Alpine
8. VCARB
9. Haas
10. Sauber

I think Williams takes a step forward on driver talent alone. Last year was a disappointment for them, but I really feel Sargeant dragged the whole team down. Alpine and VCARB had good momentum, their success will rely heavily on if their new drivers can perform at this level. Haas I just don't believe in and Sauber I see mailing it in as next year is the year.. but Hulk scoring some points and getting them to a few Q3s is entirely possible. 

What say you? ","['How aston martin has managed to fraud their way into the top 5 for you i don‚Äôt know, forgetting testing, looking at their form end of last season they are definitely in this midfield fight', 'What makes you say Aston is a clear 5? It hasn‚Äôt been that way since 2023.\n\nConsensus is probably close to \n\nFront of midfield: Alpine, Williams\n\nMid of mid: Aston, Haas, RB\n\nSauber: Sauber\n\n+- one tier on any given weekend.', '6. Alpine/Williams \n\n7. Haas \n\n8. Aston Martin\n\n9. VCARB\n\n10. Sauber', ""While Alpine are a bit of an unknown, they ended last year in strong form - while Doohan may struggle a bit they are likely to be the fastest of the back 4 and I'd think likely to take 6th at least on that basis alone - likely contending for more points, more regularly. I wouldn't rule out challenging Aston for 5th to be honest (though I don't expect AMR to drop further than 6th unless they have a particular difficult season). \n\nBehind that... I'd expect Williams and Haas to be fighting for 7th, and I'd give the edge to Williams largely on the driver lineup. They maybe be able to challenge for 6th but I'm not totally sold at this stage. \n\nVCARB could surprise but I'd say they're comfortably 9th, with Sauber propping up the bottom of the table in a distant 10th, barring a lucky race where they can profit from chaos and walk away with a healthy points haul while their rivals fail to capitalize (which I would think is very unlikely)."", ""I think it's very likely that we will see Haas out preform vcarb and Alpine"", ""First of all it's 5-10. There's nothing whatsoever to think that Aston are even in the top 5 nevermind a sure place within it. In fact pre-season testing has put them at around the 9th fastest team only just ahead of Sauber. \n\nIt's probably more like\n\n5. Alpine. 6. Williams. 7. Haas. 8. Racing Bulls. 9. Aston Martin. 10. Sauber."", ""I think Aston are further back than they have been, no longer clear 5th. I'd say Alpine at least right now probably have the 5th fastest car, but Williams driver lineup could make the difference and end up with them finishing above Alpine. Behind those for 5/6 I'd say Haas and AM probably compete for 7/8 and then Racing Bulls in 9th and Sauber ofc 10th"", ""I mean back of the grid is easy, it's Sauber. 6-9 is up in the air, I'd say 5-9 even cause Aston might be closer to 9th than to 4th if the end of last season is anything to go by. Plus they have the Stroll factor who might be the worst driver in F1 with Logan and Zhou being out of the sport. \n\nI could obviously be way off but my guess at the end of the season is 5. Williams 6. Alpine 7. Haas 8. Aston 9. RB"", 'Acting like Aston is an undisputed #5 is insanity at this point.']",13,46,0.7,13,42,42,3,5,0.010000000000000009,3

Whilst pre-season testing isn't a reliable indicator of a team's performance of the coming season, its undeniable that red bull's performance has fallen off since mid 2024. 

My question is how can a team that was so dominant, winning all but 1 race in 2023, be where they are right now, without a change in regulations?

Red bull's internal issues aside (power struggle, hornergate, newey departure) how much of the performance drop can be attributed to reduction of development time & money from finishing 1st for several consecutive seasons + cost cap breach penalty (-10% wind tunnel time) + late grasp of the current regulations by competitors?

Hes amazing and gets the maximum points their cars can get, but his tendency to be able to drive around a cars problems can be problematic.

The same thing seems to have happened again last year.\n\nIm sure the chaos in the team doesnt help, but I dont think its the main factor."", ""Convergence. Red Bull hit their development ceiling before everyone else. If they can gain a tenth of a second on their rivals today, that is a big gain.

To give you an idea, Sainz went 1.287s faster YoY in Mexico, compared to Max's 1.09s improvement."", 'It\'s actually quite similar to the Honda situation with Marquez in MotoGP, they built a bike that only he could ride with his Natural style, then he got injured and they found themselves in a crap situation with a bike that nobody could ride,they probably went even more in that direction ,then when he came back (although with and injured arm) he also struggled because the bike got to a point where It was too extreme to ride at the limit , or else you would risk crashing, honda\'s issues were also other stuff and they have carried over to now, redbull found a faster fix with different setups that gave at least max a familiar feeling.\nOf course the driver here does count, no doubt , but you cannot win with a 15th Place car/bike, or even with a 6th Place car if we look at It that way, so i think a lot of It Is down to confidence and how easy Is It to drive, teams and media Say the ""they drive over problems""stuff also because It makes the driver look Better, while It May be in part true, It\'s not as easy as that', 'There is a difference between a drop in performance and a lack of improvement.
