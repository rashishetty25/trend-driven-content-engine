I'm just giving my opinion on ‘Do I think it's going to be as easy?’ I won last weekend by 30 seconds, very, very easy. I won today by pushing a lot more, only 10 seconds, and Max was probably the quickest out on track today.

Do I think that at a track that we've never been good at, we were very good here two years ago, we almost challenged Max for the win, we've never been good in Vegas. So why am I going to think, ‘Yeah, it's going to be fine, whatever?’ I'm giving my opinion, I'm giving my honest opinion on how I think we're going to be. We've never been good there, so I'm not the most confident about going into this race.

Maybe I'll win, then we'll see. But I'm not going to lie and say ‘Yeah, I'm very confident and I think it's going to be an easy weekend’ because I don't think that's how it's going to be.

2025 - Antonelli has scored 122 points in 22 Grand Prix races and 4 Sprint races - 110 points from GPs and 12 from Sprints. This is in a season where championship points are awarded from 25 to 1 for the top 10 finishers in GPs, and  8 to 1 for the top 8 finishers in Sprints. In GP races alone, he is averaging 6.47 points per race.

2007 - Hamilton scored 109 points in 17 Grand Prix races; there were no Sprint races. In 2007 points were awarded 10 to 1 for the top 8 finishers. In those races Hamilton averaged 6.41 points per race. If the 2025 points system were in place for 2007, Hamilton would have totaled 263 points that year, averaging 15.47 points per race.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters are to be avoided. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""Great race. Maybe some thought needs to be put on the type of tarmac used in other tracks because seeing real tyre wear and 2 stoppers is such a game changer.\n\nThe only downside is that the title fight is starting to simmer down with these results, Lando found his groove in a massive way and it's gonna take a small miracle from Oscar or a MAJOR miracle from Max to stop him."", ""Lando is getting a lot of well-deserved credit for his run of form, but I want to specifically point out the improvements he's made on his starts from pole. He's now converted every single standing start from pole position (7) to victory in the last 365 days and has done so without losing the lead at the start for any of them, something that seemed unthinkable for him last season: Abu Dhabi, Australia, Monaco, Austria, Mexico, and Brazil (gp and sprint). The one pole he has failed to convert to victory in the last year was Spa, which had a rolling start.\n\n*(Yes, he made a mistake in turn 1 and Oscar capitalized, but considering the unique circumstances \\[rolling start, wet\\] and the factors working against him \\[pole being notoriously difficult to hold onto at Spa, plus whatever role his battery issues played\\], I don't think it's unreasonable to look at that one as an outlier and not fully representative for his current form).*\n\nHis starts and SC restarts were perfect this weekend including in the damp conditions of the sprint, and last race out in Mexico he held onto pole at a track where leading into turn 1 from pole is notoriously difficult. His starts are still not perfect and he has plenty of room for improvement, as we've seen this season in races where he's starting P2/P3 etc, but it's clear he's absolutely worked on this achilles heel that plagued him for much of last season and it's nice as a fan to see the tangible improvements he's made and the results that come with it. I think the same could be said for Oscar, as much as his current slump is the topic right now, it's clear he knew qualifying was a weakness of his last year and took huge strides to improve going into this year, and it paid off for him for much of the season."", 'I have to keep reminding myself that rookies and younger drivers are more often than not going to be wildly inconsistent.  Kimi has taken a lot of flak this season, but performances like his at Interlagos proves that this kid is really going to be something in F1.', 'It honestly baffles me that if Oscar didn\'t break even harder when he saw Antonelli turning it, and would have instead kept going and therefore been first to the apex, absolutely punting Antonelli into Leclerc ruining 3 driver\'s cars, he\'d have probably been fine as he was ""ahead at the apex"".\n\nThe current rules, or at least the interpretation of them, is antithetical to good racing.\n\nOscar\'s move yesterday was a bold one that at worst should have gone down as a 5s each for him and Antonelli, because ultimately Antonelli had a full car width to his right so could have avoided it, or ideally just a racing incident. \n\nIt honestly makes me lose some interest in the sport, as it basically means the only way to pass is a pit strategy, a flyby from a much faster car, or a dirty dive bomb up the inside, we rarely get wheel-to-wheel racing.', ""Aston Martin had so much of potential after coming off the backs of a very promising sprint qualifying. Alonso fortunately managed his race well, even after conceding the position in a *(never seen ever)* tussle with Leclerc. Stroll had a decent one as well. But Christ, them going on the hards in the main race definitely killed some of the momentum that they have had. With Stroll, the contact with Tsunoda spells compromise on his end but I don't know what they were doing for Alonso here. It sucks to see them flip-flopping this way\n\nConversely, VCARB can leave Interlagos, feeling proud of the double points finish! Started the sprints relatively meh for both drivers with nothing egregious of note *(I think Lawson had an incident, or maybe my memory is playing games with me)* but their main qualifying and races were the highlights! Outqualifying the main outfit, optimal starting strategies, pace management, a bit of flip-flopping across the board but each of them managed to claw their way back into the fold, Lawson creating a DRS train *(ha!)* and giving them the room to race each other, and other drivers. Nothing but my kudos to them"", 'We went from expecting a 3 way showdown for the WDC in Abu Dhabi to Norris most likely wrapping it up in Qatar, also the way things are going for Oscar lately I wouldn’t be surprised if max takes P2 in the WDC.', 'A few thoughts about the race:\n\n* First off... the TV direction! Finally, they actually showed all the battles at the end instead of just zooming in on the winner. Loved the little split screens showing the other fights happening around the track.\n* McLaren Boys. Lando had an awesome race. You could tell he managed his tyres really well most of the way through. Shame Max started so far back, because we could’ve had a proper showdown. Lando’s clearly been working on his mindset this year, and it’s paying off. Perfect timing for him to hit form like this. Oscar’s still going through a rough patch, though. I might be wrong, but at this point it feels more likely that Max takes P2 in the championship than Oscar wins it. And yeah, McLaren’s strategy for him was a bit weird... they kept him out forever in the first stint only to go for a two-stop anyway.\n* Those final laps between Max and Kimi were amazing. Gotta give credit to the rookie, he held his own.\n* And Max… wow. P3 from the pit lane, in a dry race, no big Safety Cars or red flags and with a puncture? Unreal.\n\nInterlagos once again proving why it’s one of the best tracks on the calendar.', 'This was great TV direction. But also, on F1TV, you could literally hear when JP left the office, F1 without 2 or 3 commentators really does not feel natural.', 'The fun drivers have with silly parade cars makes me wish they were somehow thrown into a promotional kart race.', 'I must say I am aghast that for an organisation who prides themselves on excellent marketing and public relations with the media and the consumer, John Elkann\'s comments that were reported on Sky Italia is the **exact opposite** of what you should be saying to the press about Ferrari\'s performance\n\nNo, Elkann. In what world are your two high-profile drivers nursing LiCo issues every lap a vast improvement to the car? In what universe has this race been sufficient for your drivers to extract maximum potential out of this machinery that has set your trajectory back by a long mile since 2024? When your long-staying employee was taken out through no fault of his own during a race, and your decorated 7-time world champion has a car that is looking like it\'ll break under the weight of its grip and stability issues, how are they able to work with those? Funny that the comparison to the WEC team came about, because the latter *(that is under AF CORSE by the way)* actually had everyone working in sync to ensure maximum potential was extracted DESPITE the BoP issues plaguing them. It is the effort of both team and driver that got them there, not this *""we must stay united and i demand maximum results""* malarkey\n\nFrankly, it seems that everytime I talk about Ferrari\'s lows, I keep circling back to the same fundamental issue. When would it get to a point where Elkann, Vigna and the rest of the higher echelons will even realise that a lot of Ferrari\'s current stinkers is coming from *them* and their whacky integrated politics that barely gives any of their personnel a chance to move the needle forward?']",26,122,0.99,26,119,119,4,16,0.030000000000000027,4
1oss62o,The Brazil GP's logistical issues to locals in capitol São Paulo - as seen by a local,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss62o/the_brazil_gps_logistical_issues_to_locals_in/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"So as we all know, we just finished up the Brazilian GP at Interlagos. I have no idea as to if this is against the rules or not (as this is more of a rant instead of a technical writeup), but I'd assume it does due to this being a writeup about how the Brazilian GP is like to the locals - as whiny as it might sound like.

For some ungodly reason, [ENEM (acronym translates to National High School Exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_M%C3%A9dio), basically an SAT-type exam with 90 + 90 questions and an essay over two Sundays that students take in order to either get into federal/public college, or get a scholarship/free ride into private college) also takes place this Sunday and the next. An issue that has been true since the Brawn GP days [(there's literally a news article from 2010 about students from Zona Sul (the region near Interlagos) having a hard time getting to the exams due to the increased traffic from F1)](https://g1.globo.com/educacao/noticia/2010/11/formula-1-prejudica-estudantes-do-enem-na-zona-sul-de-sp.html)
For very obvious reasons, traffic jams are extremely common near the school/college buildings the exam takes place at all over the country, and due to São Paulo being a gigantic city this issue compounds even further there. If the roads and the subway system are already crowded enough in a regular day, then it gets absolutely bizarre during F1 week, even more so with ENEM and this is compounded even further when we factor in other events/shows that normally take place nearby (like the Morumbis stadium or Allianz Parque).

However, ENEM can't take place in January because that'd be too close a deadline for the grades to be up and ready to be released by February (when colleges and universities start taking new students), and by December all schools/colleges are on summer break, which leaves us with November. Specifically, the one Sunday in where the F1 circus shows up with almost 300k fans in tow (because logistical issues regarding the calendar and weather mean the Brazil GP has to happen in early November). Not even considering other events like Linkin Park's show because those are far and between, only ENEM that takes place literally every year since 1998.

Of course foreigners can take a plane to São Paulo and back (as such only dealing with the local and foreigner traffic inside the city), but locals will most likely be going to the GP by car, which means dealing with both F1 and Linkin Park traffic.

Seriously... this has been an issue for almost 20 years, it would've been way more manageable both for the locals driving to their jobs, the locals taking ENEM, the foreigners and the locals going to the GP if both events didn't take place in the exact same weekend. Specially because the city of São Paulo are the ones funding the GP, meaning they absolutely have incentive to make sure the dates don't clash.","[""An exam taking place on Sunday, especially in a Christian country, is wild to me.\n\nSaturday it's ok, but placing a school event on Sunday in Italy would mean riot as here it's meant as a no school day."", 'As much as I love to watch the race, having high school students suffer with traffic etc to get to their exams is painful to see.

After an interesting brazil grand prix, Norris who does Piastri and Piastri who does Norris... Verstappen who comes back from hell and rejects Norris' coronation. I felt it was the right moment to share something I've been working on for the past few months.

I'm thrilled to introduce [metrikdelta.com](http://metrikdelta.com) a comprehensive F1 data analysis platform that I've developed with one core mission: making high level telemetry and race analytics accessible to every F1 enthusiast and complete features for new fans.

The platform is free to use I believe F1 data should be accessible to the community that makes this sport so special. There's an optional premium tier (€4.99/month) for Studio Pro content creation tools, but all analysis features remain completely free.

The site is fully mobile-responsive but I recommend desktop experience, and covers all recent seasons. Data is sourced through FastF1, And Jolpica F1

This is a passion project, I would genuinely appreciate your feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism. What features would make this more useful for you? What analyses would you like to see? How can I improve the experience? I know the site is not perfect I have a lot to do but I will do my best

I hope metrikdelta can add value to your F1 experience.

1otgqka,A visual analysis of Piastris Penalty,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otgqka/a_visual_analysis_of_piastris_penalty/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"The basis for any analysis has to be the Driving Standard Guidelines obviously, which say:

>A. Overtaking on the INSIDE of a corner:

>To be entitled to be given room when overtaking on the INSIDE, the overtaking car must:

>i) Have its front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE THE MIRROR of the other car PRIOR TO AND AT THE

>APEX

>ii) Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex, and not have “dived in”.

>iii) In the Stewards’ estimation, have taken a reasonable racing line and been able to complete the

>move whilst remaining within track limits.

As well as:

>Chicanes and S-Bends:

>i) The above guides for INSIDE and OUTSIDE may apply for each element of the combination.

>Generally, priority will be given to the first corner element.

That being said, the FIA does not further clarify what overlap the overtaking car has to have inbetween the not further specified ""prior to the apex"" and the apex on it self.  
The interesting question is how they deal with cases were the overtaking car has an overlap of the frontaxle with the other cars mirrors.   
Because when you have to brake for the inside line, you have to brake earlier than for the outside line. Oscar Piastri braking earlier than Kimi Antonelli can be ovserved on his onboard.

What I did was look up at what point Piastri initiated his braking from the onboard and then cross-referenced it to the camera shot from above. I then drew some parallel lines through the front axle of Leclercs and Piastris car as well as Piastris and Antonellis rear wing.   
[The resulting picture is this](https://imgur.com/a/GYAkbFq).  
They all matched up pretty precisely, so unless all three of them had the same deviation from going straight, they should be a pretty precise 90° angle to the direction of the straight.

So from the line going through piastris front axle, it looks like Piastris front axle, at the point of braking, where you have to decide if you go for the move or not, is in fact overlapping Antonellis mirrors. Although of course the image is tilted, so the different height of the axle and the mirrors shift the perspective a bit. but even then, the picture shows a bit of safety margin.

So what the FIA is basically claryfying with their decision is:  
Even if you have an overlap on the straight and at the start of the braking zone, you are NOT entitled to a line if you have to brake harder and therefore do not have the overlap anymore.

From here on I'll quickly talk about why the other points of the sporting section do not (fully) apply.

1. ""Overlap at the Apex"" - pretty easy. They did not reach the Apex before coliding, so this can not apply. 
2. ""Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex"" - While many argued that his lock up shows that he is not in full control, I refuse this proposition. The front left tyre which he locks up is unloaded in the first corner and has a far lower friction coefficient than the right front which he does not lock up. Which means, that even though the front left locks up, he still is very close to the braking optimum (albeit flatspotting his front left). Behind him, Russell locks up in exactly the same way and is still able to turn in normally despite the lock up.
3. ""and not have “dived in”."" - A divebomb is when a car brakes later than the car in front to reach an overlap. It might include not being able to take the inside line with the resulting speed. Piastri did in fact brake earlier than Antonelli.

So the only thing left to penalize Piastri for is losing the required overlap inbetween the braking zone and the apex.  
Which should sound wrong to anybody, as it means that braking later to have that overlap and force the other driver into a wider line is fine. While braking earlier means you are left with no way out, if the outside driver does not give you room.","['Good in depth analysis.\n\nWorth noting that there is historic precedent (several incidents last year) for the idea that the overtaking car needs to have the overlap and maintain the overlap all the way to the corner, so it is not unreasonable that they applied that same logic here.\n\nWhether or not that logic is sensible to be encoded into the guidelines in the first place is another thing.', 'It says right there that the overtaking car must have its front axle at least alongside the mirror of the defending car prior to the apex. It says the exact same thing in the decision document. \n\n>""PIA did not establish the required overlap prior to and at the apex, as his front axle was not alongside the mirror of Car 12"".\n\nThat\'s the required overlap. \n\nWhether he managed to get alongside on the straight well before is pretty irrelevant. \n\n>So the only thing left to penalize Piastri for is losing the required overlap inbetween the braking zone and the apex.\n\nHe didn\'t manage to safely arrive at the apex. Therefore collision is on him since they didn\'t even reach the point (apex) where it could be assessed if he is entitled to the corner.', ""\\>So from the line going through piastris front axle, it looks like Piastris front axle, at the point of braking, where you have to decide if you go for the move or not, is in fact overlapping Antonellis mirrors.\xa0\n\nThat's why I was saying for firstly that it is perfectly legal by current guidelines move, but they clearly judged next moments after braking began and Piastri started a little earlier because being inside. And still it was very close to being legal in current guidelines, like 1 m close after a heavy braking."", ""Honestly, I hate the rules and I also complained on reddit earlier about his penalty.

If there wasn't a wall and Piastri failed to cut the corner in order to avoid collision, than it would have made sense, but with the wall there we can't really know if he couldn't cut the corner because of the lock up, his choices were either going against the wall or doing what he did. \n\n\n\nMy personal opinion on the crash is the same as Leclerc's, Antonelli himself said to italian interviewer that he didn't saw Piastri, and thought that he had braked earlier, and I think that is pretty evident because on the straight he left a lot of space for Piastri, which makes his move making sense, but at a point he steered like he wasn't there, and by that point Piastri could do nothing to avoid collision. If you look they hit each other wheel against wheel, there was no space for Piastri to let Antonelli pass without collision. But I see Antonelli hitting Piastri, not the other way round. That's why I think this apex rule doesn't make sense when there are walls, one thing is leaving space, one thing is hitting an other car.""]",3,34,0.53,3,30,30,-1,5,-0.020000000000000018,-1

1otchep,Proposed Regulation Overhaul for Overtaking and Racing Room,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otchep/proposed_regulation_overhaul_for_overtaking_and/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"Hello dead F1 fans! Following the Piastri penalty I see a lot of chatter on the overtaking rules once again and how people think they are, simply put, not that good. It's too easy for the defending driver to be entitled to space and too hard for the attacking driver to get alongside to be eligible for a move (especially from the outside). 

  
This is simply a problem because I for one, enjoy a lot overtaking attempts on the outside and two these rules some times seem to be opposite of what we call the racing spirit. For these reason and many more I want to share with you a rule concept I thought of that could make side to side racing easier to exist and judge for fans and stewards alike.

**Determination of Racing Rights at Corner Entry**

1. **Establishing Overlap** A driver attempting to overtake is entitled to racing room if, at the moment the defending driver commits to turn-in, the front axle of the attacking car is at least alongside the rear axle of the defending car.
2. **Definition of Turn-In** “Turn-in” occurs when the defending car begins a sustained steering input that causes the car to start cornering. Brief or minimal steering movements that do not result in the car turning are **not** considered turn-in.
3. **Responsibilities**
   * When overlap exists at turn-in, both drivers must leave at least one car’s width of track for each other through the corner.
   * When no overlap exists at turn-in, the defending driver may take the normal racing line.
   * The attacking driver must remain under control and keep within track limits; loss of control cancels their right to space.
4. **Applicability to All Corners** For long or multi-apex corners, the overlap status at the initial committed turn-in applies for the duration of the corner.



# Key points

* **One clear moment of judgment:** the committed turn-in.
* **No numeric thresholds in the text:** FIA can set technical detection criteria (like steering-angle % and minimum lateral-G) in a separate appendix.
* **Works everywhere:** from Monaco’s hairpin to Monza’s Parabolica.

\---

  
So pretty much the idea is simple. When the defending driver actually commits to the corner that's when we judge whether the attacker should be allowed space or not. I think this is the easiest way for everyone to intuitively know where that moment is as the drivers and viewers alike pretty much understand which moment the defender starts cornering and if the stewards have to be involved they have to look at simple 3 data parameters and then check if the attacking car was alongside the defender the moment the defender committed to the corner. 



Thank you for reading and if you have any ideas please leave them below!

\*Bonus info\*

In this segment I want to simply clarify more when the moment of commitment actually happens;

# 1. Conceptual meaning

In racing terms, *turn-in* is the **moment a driver stops braking in a straight line and begins steering the car into the corner.**  
It’s the commitment point where the car transitions from longitudinal control (braking/acceleration) to lateral control (cornering).

At that moment:

* The driver has chosen a line and braking point.
* The car’s direction begins to change measurably.
* The defending driver’s ability to react or adjust line drastically reduces — which is why this instant is critical for judging overtaking rights.

# 2. Why this matters for rules

All overtaking rules depend on when both drivers have *committed* to their lines.  
The attacker must be alongside **before** that commitment — otherwise, the defender can’t be expected to leave space safely.

# 3. Technical definition (as used by telemetry or stewards)

>

# a. “Transition from neutral to sustained steering input”

* **Neutral** steering means the car is still moving roughly straight (minor corrections only).
* **Sustained input** means the driver holds a steady steering direction rather than quick flicks or wheel twitches.
* This prevents drivers from artificially triggering “turn-in” early with a fake steering blip.

# b. “Sufficient steering angle”

* The steering angle must reach a *meaningful percentage* of the typical angle required for that specific corner (about **30–50%**, depending on geometry).
* This ensures the car is genuinely beginning the turn, not just being adjusted in the braking zone.

# c. “Initiate lateral acceleration consistent with the corner”

* Lateral acceleration (side G-force) is the physical proof that the car has actually started turning.
* For an F1 car, anything above **0.4–0.6 g** indicates real cornering has begun.
* Combining this with steering data ensures turn-in is *objective*, not opinion-based.

# d. “Consistent with the corner being approached”

* Each corner has a characteristic radius and therefore a normal expected steering load.
* The telemetry comparison is relative to that corner’s geometry (so Parabolica and Monaco hairpin are judged differently).

# How it prevents abuse

* **Fake early steering:** doesn’t generate enough G or sustain → ignored.

If 2 of the 3 agree it’s a penalty, if all 3 agree then it’s the larger penalty (ie the difference between a 5 or 10 second as a slam dunk) and also allow them to issue a penalty for dangerous or unsporting defending without needing to prove moving in the braking zone.\n\nMost of all, cut out the “it’s been referred to the stewards” rubbish, they can intervene and issue a penalty without needing the race director to give them permission to look at it first, and hopefully will be much faster to get a decision.', ""Not interested in chatGPT's 'ideas'."", 'I like where this is going', ""So until the axles line up, the front car can do fuck all?

1oss6ag,Genuine question about midfielders vs top drivers battles...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss6ag/genuine_question_about_midfielders_vs_top_drivers/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I may not know much about racing, but this always baffles me every time I hear about ""generational drive"" from anyone (and today from Max).

Why oh why don't any midfielders even atempt to take on a fight with the top drivers? In my vision they lose nothing, and may gain A LOT. This was shown in Mexico by Bearman, in Brasil by Kimi. Often they are more than capable of standing their ground and defend, or at least slow down the car behind. The legendary Alonso wall, where he was able to keep WDC behind him for the whole race. 

Now it just looks like they've been waved a blue flag, the second they see Max, Lando, Oscar or Charles in the mirror, they instantly move out the way, abandon racing line, don't even try to keep their position.

This in my opinion undermines today's Max achievement of reaching P3 from pitlane. I mean if only 6 of 19 cars is even atempting to race you, and 2 of them crash before you even warm your tires... In these conditions Logan Sergeant could have a shot at WDC. Basically every race this season feels like watching two races happening at the same time - McLaren vs Mercedes vs Leclerc vs Verstappen, and the other race is all of the other cars just getting out of the way of the ""big boys"".

And again, before MV fans tear me apart - I'm not saying his drive wasn't impressive (although Kimi's defence was even more impressive), but to he completly honest with you... If he doesn't need to race 90% of the cars, it's not THAT impressive. And we shouldn't talk about ""generational drive"" when 3 of the cars are out and the rest just lets you pass by. It's just catching up to the top and then starting to race for real. I mean if somebody starts from the pitlane, then 15 cars crash, your only opponents are Saubers and Alpines, and you are in the 3rd fastest car on the grid, you can easly achieve P1 and on paper be the best driver in history. But are you really?

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  
I'm giving MV as an EXAMPLE here, I'm not saying it's exclusive to him. I also didn't like how Lawson just jumped out the way from Piastri instead of even attempting to defend. MV's example is just the most apparent, since there's all this talk about ""generational drive"".

Yes, he finished dead last, but keep in mind that he had *two* penalties, the second of which was caused by the team.
 
Without those extra 20 seconds he would have finished P8, having started P19. That's pretty solid.

I know it's popular to bash whoever happens to be in the second RB seat, but it seems that Tsunoda is improving, and is working better with the team. I am not sure whether that is down to Mekies.

For next year, the rules change completely so everyone starts from zero.

Would it not be more beneficial to continue with a driver that is known to the team and that right now is talking and working with the same people who are designing and will be developing next season's car?

The other option is of course Hadjar. He has been an amazing rookie. But is he mature and experienced enough to help develop next year's Red Bull, especially when he has no established rapport with Red Bull engineers and, as a rising star, will be under tremendous pressure next to Max in a car that is expected to win?

As much as I like Yuki, I have to admit that it's a tough decision. Laurent Mekies has worked with both drivers, so I suppose that he already has an opinion on the matter, and a well-educated one at that.

Personally, I'd err on the side of caution and keep Yuki for '26, and let Hadjar mature in the lower pressure environment of the second team. ","['Why do you exclude the 10s Yuki caused himself from the timings?

I suspect that RB may be searching for the next big star like they always did. That'd make even more sense now when Verstappen's commitment beyond 2026 is murky. In this regard, Tsunoda is clearly not the driver that can replace Max Verstappen, and hence he's not worth keeping."", ""the general ask for RBR second driver is that he should be useful for the WDC.

That's kind of their requirement: feedback for car development, help with tyre selection, help with setup. Yuki hasn't been able to do that and there are a few races in 2025 Verstappen could have finished higher if they had been able to use Yuki as a second driver.

1oss8yc,Booing at Brazil podium towards Norris,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss8yc/booing_at_brazil_podium_towards_norris/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"This is my first time posting and I think this is an important discussion to have as a standalone instead of in the daily threads.

Lando is a hated driver and obviously people have their favourites but booing especially when it’s podium time is a stretch. I am a Ferrari fan and think Lando is talented but I don’t like his attitude so it’s not like I am looking for reasons that he is “mistreated”. Max has received booing in the past as well and I disagree when that happens too but this time I thought I’d like to hear others opinions on this as well because i haven’t seen discourse around it.

Socials: I went on the f1 instagram page to see if there was any mention of it but instead the comments under posts where anti lando and pro everyone else - fine, people have their opinions, I am not too fond of him either BUT no mention of booing.

Disrespect: I come from a culture where sports and national anthems are sacred. Even if you hate a person or nation, when they are on a podium and ESPECIALLY when a national anthem is playing you sit quiet but as protest you can turn your back or walk away. During the podium I was watching F1 TV and Alex did his best to speak over the boos but it was overwhelming and obviously he had to stay quiet during the English national anthem. 

Another think to note is that I think it’s also disrespectful to the other drivers on the podium because it takes away from their experience. The biggest giveaway of this for me was poor Kimi. I was watching his reactions to the podium as it was only his second time and it’s obvious he is not as experienced on how to handle difficult situations like this one. You could see on his face when Lando was receiving the trophy and the boos were loud that he was deeply uncomfortable and tried to laugh it off when he received the trophy himself. I just thing it’s an awful situation for everyone involved.

I only became a fan post Covid  and generally there has been a shift in how crowds act nowadays in events. So my two questions for you are 1) does anyone know if booing in motorsport during podiums and anthems have always been a thing 2) what is your opinion on it","['Both Hamilton and Max were disliked in Brazil in a certain point of their careers, things change, it’s not something personal.', 'To quote Lando\n\n""Just ignore all the people talking crap about you""\n\nI don\'t think he cares if anyone boos and throws hissy fit anymore', ""I watched Lewis serenely tell booing crowds that they were the best fans in the world.

If you look at the fan stages, he had pretty good reception there.  \n  \nPeople just have their own horses in a championship fight.
