Now that the dust has settled in Budapest, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","['Gabriel Bortoleto is the real deal. He‚Äôs finally got a car that can show off his skill. He‚Äôs qualifying well, doing the overtakes, defending, keeping up with other cars, and scoring points. Good for him üôè', ""To end things off with a high, I finally have the opportunity to sing my praises about Aston Martin! This was an amazing weekend from them, and one that I have been waiting for quite some time for them to have! The fact that the track fits with the high downforce setup paid off immensely\n\nQualifying saw them being consistently quick in a one lap pace, maximising their time efficiently to go out and set great laps *(the one from Alonso at Q3 stands out for me)*, and then effectively slotting themselves in good positions, given the limitations of overtaking in Hungary\n\nAlonso, in particular, keeping everyone at bay to conserve his own race was fantastic. He pulled off the one stop strategically whilst maintaining his own pace in the train. It might not be the wild race we are expecting from a sly fox like him, but it is the race he needed to maximise the points that he could for the weekend\n\nStroll, as well put in some really fine laps during qualifying. He also pulled the tyre degradation management off very well well, which is a feat when factoring in the bit where he was on scrubbed tyres in the dirty air. He did fall off a position but his race should be acknowledged for how nicely the job was done!\n\nI understand that this might be a one-off performance and I could be overly optimistic about their chances, but if this is how they are in high-downforce tracks, maybe I will allow myself to dream that they can break even in tracks with that characteristic in the neat future. There is no doubt that the double points haul is a major boost for the team and their efforts this week. They should be proud! Here's to hoping for more good returns for them!"", 'I‚Äôm really happy to see Sauber getting some results. Kubica was one of my favs and to see the team struggle for a decade plus has been frustrating.  Plus I really like Bortoletos attitude. I hope he never changes', 'Is it really impossible for some folks to comprehend that what is deemed as the best strategy can sometimes play out in the opposite manner, while fortune favours the bold in a twist of circumstances? Is it also impossible to comprehend that strategies being played out completely straight, especially when drivers are in the middle of a championship battle is not the most ideal, providing that the aim is to provide fair opportunities for both drivers to go for the title bid? It has always been in McLaren\'s best interest to let **BOTH** drivers fight, instead of prioritising one over the other. And given the gap has been consistently lesser than the amount of points the winner of a Grand Prix would get, it will be the stupidest thing to do. \n\nSome of the takes surrounding McLaren and the strategies executed by the garages of both drivers have been absolutely asinine over the past year, but this weekend is simply exceptional based on the aftermath of the vitriol that I have stumbled upon. The situation that has played out yesterday was incredibly reminiscent to Spa 2024, where the driver with nothing to lose, given the circumstances of his race up until that point, chooses to go onto a lesser-suggested strategy and manages to make it work. What is believed to be the better strategy eventually did not unravel in the way that is expected. Stuff like that happens in Formula One, similarly to the weight of luck in races and well-timed strategies. It happens. And some folks should be open into accepting that it is a thing, rather than drum up baseless conspiracy theories of their own. \n\nFor the record, this race was a blast to watch for myself. Both of them had me on the edge of my seat as they maximised their points and took home the good haul to set up a fantastic final stretch for the season between their fight. I have seen some folks moan about the fact that there was no clear dominance this season between the two because *""they should be, in the fastest car""* yet in the same breath, condemn dominance streaks of guys like Verstappen and Hamilton in their prime. The sports discourse demonstrated throughout the course of this season will never fail to stun me for how cheap and off-putting things have gotten.', 'Red Bull strategy team don‚Äôt seem to realize they no longer have a fast car. Max overtook like 5-6 cars and still ended up behind where he started.', 'This group of rookie is pretty good', 'That was a great race, for once the result was unclear heading into the last lap and that rarely happens. I don‚Äôt want to be too excitable, but if Norris hadn‚Äôt held on here I think it may have been a dagger blow to his title hopes. I do wonder if this will lead to some awkward discussions back stage at McLaren, Oscar couldn‚Äôt have made it more clear that his sole objective out of this race was to beat Lando, so to be beaten on strategy from within the team will sting a bit I‚Äôm sure. McLaren are letting them race and mixing up the strategy, more than Mercedes did for instance when they were dominant, so that‚Äôs good to see.', 'Who would have thought that a simple rear axle can make the diverence between almost losing to the Williams and being in Podium contention. \n\nHappy to See George getting another Podium and to See Antonelli being relieved about finally scoring points. \n\nThe Astons/saubers are absolutely in the Right for 5th in the constructors Right know. \n\nFerrari maybe where able to finally break Hamilton completely and I would be not surprised if Leclerc leaves at the end of the Next year, if they cant get their Shit together. \n\nAnd finally who would have thought that the best way of closing the gap between Max and yuki is just to make the car a real midfielder?', ""I've seen a decent number of complaints that Oscar's side of the garage should only be focusing on Lando, and I don't think that's a crazy thing to suggest. But it's also pretty apparent that McLaren as a team are going to prioritize getting both cars as high as possible this year--even if that doesn't necessarily make the most sense for a driver in terms of the WDC fight.\n\nHeck, Silverstone wasn't that long ago, and they were pretty open about how they would have double-stacked during a safety car despite Oscar's penalty to preserve the one-two. It doesn't surprise me that they would be more focused on trying to get ahead of Charles than making sure they're covering Lando in 4th.\n\nNow whether or not they'll be able to keep that mentality as the season goes on is another thing."", 'Alpines are such a joke lmao,too slow for a 1 stop,cant overtake anything if they 2 stop.\n\nDead last is gonna be from now till the end of the season.']",30,227,0.89,30,213,213,2,14,-0.020000000000000018,2
