Carlos has always been a rapid driver but if I'm not wrong, in terms of pace, this year Carlos has been closer to Charles than ever.

Red Bull outscored Mercedes by 121 points in the constructors. Checo finished the season on 152 points, meaning so long as he gave a 32 points swing over Mercedes, Red Bull would still outscore Mercedes.

His first 2 races were 2nd places, meaning he scored 36 points in those 2 races. In the remaining 22 races, he prevented 18 points from going to Mercedes via his finishing results. This means  Checo would have had to race Australia (where he scored 10 but didn't affect Mercedes who finished 17 (RUS) and retired (HAM)) and also Japan where he scored 18 points to secure the constructors bronze medal for Red Bull.

1hdkfcc,How F1 employee bonuses work in the budget cap era,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdkfcc/how_f1_employee_bonuses_work_in_the_budget_cap_era/,2024-12-13, Discussion,"McLaren can give 12mil to employees in bonuses and have it not count against the budget cap.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.

Edit: To do the math, assuming teams pay their full bonus, McLaren employees got a 20% increase in bonus compared to last year, and Red Bull employees got a 16.67% decrease. Now, teams might not choose to pay this much in bonuses. Individual teams might have goals they have to meet to get their bonuses by their individual employee contracts. Just like teams don't have to spend the whole budget cap in the first place. For instance, it might be in Red Bull's employee's contracts that they have to place top 3 in the WCC or no bonus at all. But they might have something much more lenient. Just like driver contracts, we don't know what are in employee contracts.

Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""

I did not understand how any of this worked until looking up the regulations, and I don't think many people understand how it works either. I did this digging to comment on another post that the poster deleted, but I thought it was interesting and other people might not know, so I wanted to post it anyway.

1hdwpvp,I hate the HUD from back in the day ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdwpvp/i_hate_the_hud_from_back_in_the_day/,2024-12-14, Discussion,"Hey, guys!

New fan here, started watching F1 last year.

I’ve been doing some “research” for a while now. I’m currently watching every race from the 2012 season.

I simply hate how they used to display the gaps between drivers. You need to check the time really fast as it will soon disappear and show the gaps for the next group of cars.

I find it hard to follow on how the race is at that exact moment, comparing to nowadays where the times are always visible.

There are other things I don’t like, such as the radio messages, which have bad audio quality and that’s understandable, but providing subtitles doesn’t require that much technology.

The way they show the starting grid is also horrendous.

AND YES! I KNOW THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO AND IT MAKES SENSE TO BE WORSE!

The whole point of this post is actually to ask if you guys miss anything from back in the day regarding HUD or anything broadcast related.","[""F1 was extremely slow to adapt its on-screen presentation to new technology and broadcasting standards. The graphics used until 2017 were essentially just coats of paint over the graphics introduced in 2004, when F1 was still broadcasting in standard definition 4:3. I don't think the scrolling positions along the bottom came in straight away but it happened as a result of those restrictions at least. With a lower resolution and less horizontal space on screen, having a vertical timing tower at all times would take up way more space, and they never changed that even after going widescreen in 2007 and eventually HD in 2011.\n\nThe fact that this finally changed in 2017 after Liberty took over suggests that this weird presentation style was something Bernie was still in charge of, which seems strange."", 'Yeah, people love to hate on Liberty but it was when they took over in 2017/2018 that the telemetry and presentation had a huge boost.', ""At least we didn't have the stupid AWS predictions onscreen and we had real images of tyres instead of the CGI version we have today while the actual tyres sit outside the Pirelli motorhome"", 'However many times I watch quali now, I just cannot get used to the double reference times on the new graphics. Bring back everything being P1+x.xxx.', 'Completely disagree. The graphics around 2016/17 were as good as they got. Compact, clear, and displayed all you needed. \n\nIt’s what, 6 years since they changed the graphics and yet they’re still oversized and still miss vital information regularly.', 'What’s wrong with the AWS predictions? They’re rarely that far off and it’s good to see F1 using new technologies to learn and develop from. \n\nThey also give new fans an insight into the battle we’re watching & additional info. \n\nYou can quite easily tell lots of this stuff is in its alpha version & they’re learning from it. The car tracking stuff alone has come along massively since they started. \n\nNor are they obtrusive. They don’t block a thing on track action and are quite easily glanced at and forgotten. \n\nOld man shouts at clouds. Literally.', 'But that isn’t really a helpful metric for a car in P16 during Q1? How does knowing Stroll is 8 tenths down on Verstappen tell you anything?', 'Because they’re all relative to the one time. When you get a session where say HAM starts out and they’re using the P1 time as the reference, and at the first split it’s well down and they switch to the P16 time instead on which it’s then slightly up: if you’re watching the actual lap you might not see the switch between the two references. Also, if the P16 cutoff is changing constantly as drivers complete their laps it’s even harder to keep track of, and they don’t always seem to have the actual laptime displayed obviously.\n\nHaving had years and years and looking at the old HUD, it used to be really easy to quickly calculate what the time you needed to beat was likely to be. When everything is being displayed relative to two different references it’s not always so obvious.\n\nIf you look at [this screengrab](https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/6-png.573044/) I know that +3.7 is the cutoff, and I can quickly glance at the same place on the screen to see that number update if P1 goes quicker.\n\nThe current version of [this](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F900nwbt0cvt91.jpg%3Fwidth%3D739%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D6eda171054367d035ab0f2b03a844973ce497a0a) has: two flying laps with references to two separate drivers (without telling you if they were up or down on either). Doesn’t actually tell you what MAGs time or gap is on the left hand side if you take a quick glance, so without doing some manual maths of MAGs lap (shown only on ALOs flying lap) against the P1 time you don’t know how safe VET was to MAG. Even if you know ALO is -0.1 on MAG, you don’t know if that will push VET down as well or not. Because ALO is only shown relative to MAG, and VET is only shown relative to P1, there’s no way of quickly cross checking the two of them. Just realised this has dragged on a bit…\n\n_the tl;dr version is there’s nothing in the graphic I’ve used there that will quickly tell me what ALOs time will be relative to VETs time, and which of them would be the new P15_\n\nIf you’re only used to the newer version maybe it makes more sense, but I have far less of a clue what’s going on with the newer quali graphics.', ""Sorry, but I fundamentally disagree across the board.\n\nThe newer HUD shows the most relevant information at that moment and is more immediately digestible within its context. You keep talking about wanting quick glances but then also talk about needing to do your own calculations as a result and those 2 things don't mix. The new version is infinitely more quick glanceable by design. \n\nIn your example: All that matters in context is how ALO is tracking against MAG through that lap in order to get out of Q1 - I don't need to know the available gap between MAG and VET because it's likely hundredths of a second anyway and those aren't the currently 'battling' cars. At that moment the important question is 'is ALO doing enough to get out of the drop zone? Y/N' and this graphic is the quickest and best display of that."", 'The gap between VET and MAG is over a tenth of a second in that example, not just a few hundredths. I’m personally far more interested in VETs gap to MAG than I am in TSUs gap to MAG. I’d be fine with using MAG in that example as the reference for all, but it’s that discrepancy between P14 and P15 that irks me. Yes, ALO is the one currently battling, but is he going to put VET at risk or be immediately at risk himself? To me, that’s more important and likely to determine if ALO is going to get out or not. If he beats MAG but is only P15, that’s still likely to be beaten again. \n\nI did use the wrong words when I said I could quickly calculate it: the reality is the HUD did it. I could look at a fixed place on the left of the screen (the P15 gap, whoever was in P15) to always know what the current cutoff was.']",0,10,0.17,0,10,10,0,4,-0.04999999999999999,0
