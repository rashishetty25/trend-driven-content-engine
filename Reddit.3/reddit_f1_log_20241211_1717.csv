From the looks of how understeery that car can go at times, it is not surprising both Verstappen and Perez reported similar issues with it. Another thing that I agree is the toxic backlash that Perez had been getting. Although I feel like this can be applied to a lot of other situations that goes around the sport, the vitriol here about Perez is appalling at times. I understand the frustration, but Jesus Christ, people.\n\nHowever, I do agree that Perez has been a factor in Red Bull's underperformance. While Verstappen has been able to extract every aspect out of the car, Perez couldn't. And it does seem like his confidence wanes with each race that passes along, which ultimately affects their results. 2023 may have helped hide that aspect considering Verstappen's surge to put Red Bull on the map, and the other teams' inability to match what they were doing *(which is ironic because that RB19 had its set of minor issues but it was masked quite well)*, but 2024 simply brought all of those to light, and it is quite frankly becoming a lot harder to shield those mistakes\n\nOn a different note, it sometimes makes me wonder on who is the **ideal** driver to sit alongside Verstappen, or what Red Bull are truly looking for. I mentioned elsewhere that Tsunoda will be my pick out of the plausible successors, should they decide to see Perez out. But at the same time, the thing with Red Bull and their revolving door of drivers coming in and out since Ricciardo is crazy, and I wonder who can actually remotely do a fraction of what Verstappen could do"", 'Maybe not, but he is slow and makes costly errors that you‚Äôd expect from a rookie, not a 14-year veteran', ""Something people don't realize is that Perez is a nice guy and Verstappen actually really likes him.  \n  \nPeople always think these two are at odds, they're not.""]",3729,589,0.97,3729,11661,11661,24,1,0.0,24

Except that was torpedoed almost immediately by an agreement between the French government and Renault to focus on electric cars, with Alpine being the brand of ""sporty"" electric cars.

You can\'t use F1 to market electric cars.\n\nBut considering that F1 surged in popularity over the same period, Renault tried to waddle in with minimal investment (because no overall strategy) which led to Alpine becoming this directionless mess over the past couple of years. So directionless in fact that it became an active embarassment for the Renault group and De Meo. So with embarassing performance and no strategic objective, we started hearing rumors of the team being up for sale.\n\nExcept it was *so directionless* that it would have sold for *billions* under current market value for a team, and a sale would have been a complete admission of defeat for Renault while heavyweights like Audi and GM were looking to get competitive into F1.

Flavio is there to be the bad guy and get rid of the fat while bringing some dignity back to the Alpine name, so that Renault can sell high without being completely embarassed in the process.']",681,152,0.95,681,144,144,20,2,0.0,20

Brought class and professionalism to the team that it desperately needed, and largely due to his driving Haas is in a much stronger position than it was when he got there.

Haas was 10th, 8th, and then in his first year, 10th, and calling their driver's lineup ""slapdash"" before Nico arrived would have been a compliment.

I don't know what role Nico had in helping to develop the improved Haas car this year, but I'm sure it was an important one, with his experience and professionalism allowing him to give very detailed feedback that helped the team figure out which way to move, which is probably the single biggest thing Haas lacked before he got there.  And then he drove that car to a very solid result considering what Haas has to work with.

Nico being a consummate professional salvaged the team's reputation, and I'm convinced his driving and ability to elevate his car helped Toyota to decide to take the plunge and invest in the team giving Haas access to greater resources than they could have achieved anytime soon on their own.  Certainly that was much less likely to happen when the Haas driver lineup was awash in mediocricy.  Now they sit at P7 with Nico having earned the lion's share of the points.  They're poised to make an assault on the midpack and Nico played a role in getting them there.

Haas is, in a word, a team with credibility now, which sure as heck wasn't the case when Nico first got there.

No knock on Kevin intended, but this was Nico's team for the last 2 years and he got it done.  I hope he does well at Sauber.  He earned his pay and owes Haas nothing.","["">Nico being a consummate professional salvaged the team's reputation, and I'm convinced his driving and ability to elevate his car helped Toyota to decide to take the plunge and invest in the team.\n\nI think it was the Silverstone weekend where we first saw some key Toyota people in the Haas garage. That was of course the weekend where Nico finished in P6 for the second race in a row. It was said that they were just some of Ayao's friends..."", '> No knock on Kevin\n\nHonestly, Kevin made things exciting and mostly in a good way.  The way he kept sacrificing his race to make sure Nico got points, in other races the fact that he wouldn\'t give up the fight even when it seemed obvious that there would be no positive outcome, his wheel to wheel battles. \n\nAs for Nico, I\'m happy about how things played out and I\'m always happy when ""one of the good ones"" finds success. He seems like an honestly good guy.', 'It annoyed me intensely when people were slagging off Haas and suggesting they be kicked because Andretti wasn‚Äôt getting in. These things take time and they‚Äôve been in a difficult spot. Give them half a chance and they‚Äôll go for it. The narrative that the team existed solely to advertise CNC and they didn‚Äôt care where they placed was obnoxious.', 'Haas is the highlight of this 2024 season for me, what a phenomenal comeback. I started the season thinking ‚ÄúOh boy, it couldn‚Äôt get any worse than Haas‚Äù (I was a Sauber fan). I was dead wrong. First half of the season, Haas were gatekeeping the top 10 from the Sauber drivers and for the later half of the season, Haas did get in the top 10 for God knows how many times (I lost count). Too bad that Nico and Kmag left after this season, I definitely can see them being the heroes (along with Ayao) who lead the team to the top of the midfield.', ""It's always difficult to judge just what caused a team to improve, there could be a bunch of factors with drivers, engineers, Komatsu taking over as team principal, changes to technical strategy and processes at the factory, etc.\n\nBut one of the biggest things that was noticeable about Haas in the years before Hulk joined was that they just couldn't fix their issues or be consistent from race to race. They had long running issues with tyres, so even if the car's aero etc may have been good, they destroyed tyres and couldn't find a good balance in the car. This issue seemed to keep up for multiple seasons with them just not being able to get to the bottom of how to solve it.\n\nSo it does somewhat fit with the idea that bringing in a strong development driver like Nico may have been a massive help to them. He's had plenty of experience at different teams, even in the years when he wasn't racing he was still a development driver with Aston. So there is a good chance that he was helpful in working through the issues that they were having with balance and tyre wear, and helping them solve those issues.\n\nBeing an experienced professional driver certainly helped too. It gave them a reliable benchmark to measure against - KMag is a great driver too but not always the most consistent, and rookies like Mick always make it harder to tell what's going on with the car and improve things, when you're not sure how fast they should be. Hulk is arguably the best driver Haas have ever had.\n\nHopefully he can go on to do good things at Sauber and help them improve too."", 'Top professional. Was instrumental at Renault in 2017 as well maximising the performance on track and providing very important feedback for continuous improvement just like he did at Haas.', ""I'm always surprised when people are fans of teams and not drivers (except when it's Ferrari because they're almost an Italian national team). Pleasantly surprised though."", 'Honestly felt like Haas was the perfect home for him. Will be a shame to see him in Sauber imo', ""I think having Hulk there really helped highlight some issues, especially in 23 with the tyres. If they didn't have Hulk doing wonders in quali and falling like a stone in the races, they probably never really get on top of that tyre issue as it becomes less prominent. If it was just Mick and Kmag qualifying and finishing 16/15th most weekends, they wouldn't really know that the car had underlying speed. Just makes a bit tougher to drilling to certain issues.\n\nHis feedback as well is meant to be really good and precise. I know Bearman was saying that the way he would describe certain details of the car to the engineers was really good, like Bearman could feel the same details but not able to word it the same way. Small stuff like that just makes it a bit easier to work on improving the car.\n\nIt's a two way street though. Komatsu always felt even though the car had a clear weakness in tyre management, so did Nico. So their tests at the start of the season were as much for the team figuring out the tyres as much as it was for Nico to improve that side. And honestly he really has, I actually think his race pace this year has been a lot better than his quali pace - Nico's just felt a lot more well rounded as a driver.""]",207,34,0.93,207,24,24,77,4,0.030000000000000027,77

1hbx78u,2024 World Constructors' Championship Alternative Standings,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hbx78u/2024_world_constructors_championship_alternative/,2024-12-11, Statistics,"  
From 1958 until 1978, the International Cup for F1 Constructors (as it was called at the time), only counted the points from the highest-scoring driver in each race for each constructor towards the Championship.

Using the same logic for the 2024 season, these are the standings (if I calculated them correctly, pardon any mistakes). The first table's results are the standings without counting sprints, as they didn't exist back in the day, or fastest laps, which not always awarded points:

https://preview.redd.it/9gv9sk3wu86e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d10da17ef4103eaa33d5f03a37a451da19b7d87e

The only major difference in the standings for this scenario is that Red Bull would finish ahead of Ferrari with McLaren only clinching the title on the finale in Abu Dhabi.

A funny tidbit, but Red Bull's points would actually be just Verstappen's points (no fastest lap points) + 10 (Checo's points in Australia, as Max DNFed and P√©rez never finished ahead of him any other time).

This method almost punishes you for both drivers doing well, as Alpine's double podium in S√£o Paulo wouldn't even ""help"" them as much, because only Ocon's 2nd place would count, and many other scenarios like these for the midfield and backmarker teams, as double points finishes wouldn't pay off as much as only 1 car finishing higher.

  
In the second table I've added sprint points using the same logic that only the highest scoring driver from each team counts:

https://preview.redd.it/e2s21au3v86e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=930922410ac5aef16b132f84a4cf70333b0c705d

The only difference in position here from the previous table above is that Haas jumps Alpine for 6th as they scored more points in sprints (again, Alpine's double podium has less relevancy in this scenario).

Something which I hadn't noticed before doing this, but besides Williams and Sauber (which I guess is understandable), I found that Aston Martin also didn't score a single point in a sprint. You would think at least in the sprint races in the first half of the season they may have had the pace for it, but they never did. Maybe shows they struggled with setting up the car with only 1 practice session in sprint weekends.

Just made this for fun, hope I can be forgiven for any mistakes here and there.",[],17,1,0.79,17,0,0,17,1,0.79,17

I already did the quick search but couldn't find the answer, and to be fair I don't want to read through all technical regulations.


","[""Nope, if a team is confident they're going to be lapped, it's a completely legitimate move to under-fuel the car by a lap.\n\nOf course, if you're unexpectedly on the lead lap at the end you have to make that back up through the race, so there is a risk-reward trade-off for teams who are more marginal."", 'No, they don‚Äôt.\n\nStrategists can use this to their advantage.

If you are expecting to be lapped then objectively you are doing it wrong. This is the racing equivalent of ‚Äúbuy high, sell low.‚Äù As others have stated, the main reason for minimum fuel is to test the fuel. This is to ensure your fuel conforms to the rules.

1hbb2nd,Viagogo Scam + Yas Marina Ticketing Mess at the Abu Dhabi GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hbb2nd/viagogo_scam_yas_marina_ticketing_mess_at_the_abu/,2024-12-10, Discussion,"This year‚Äôs Abu Dhabi Grand Prix turned into a nightmare for my husband and me, thanks to a combination of fraudulent reselling on Viagogo and Yas Marina Circuit‚Äôs flawed ticket system.

The Issue

We bought General Admission tickets for Saturday, which, according to Yas Marina Circuit‚Äôs website, include:

1.	Entry to the race zone (qualifying).
2.	Access to the After Race Concert (not sold separately).

But here‚Äôs the catch: this year, Yas Marina split the ticket into two separate QR codes‚Äîone for the race zone and one for the concert. Fraudulent resellers exploited this, sending us only the race zone QR code and withholding the concert access.

We didn‚Äôt know until we arrived at the gate, and Viagogo‚Äôs support refused to help, claiming ‚Äúeverything was delivered as advertised.‚Äù

The Bigger Loophole

To make things worse, Yas Marina‚Äôs system created a massive loophole:
‚Ä¢	If you had General Admission, you needed to enter the race zone first and visit an Ask Yas tent inside to get your concert wristband.
‚Ä¢	But for Golden Circle upgrades, you only had to show your upgrade ticket at the concert gate‚Äîno one checked if you had an F1 ticket for that day.

This allowed fraudsters to:
1.	Keep the Golden Circle ticket for themselves while selling only the F1 race zone QR code.
2.	Sell both QR codes separately, leaving buyers like us with an incomplete experience.

This is even more frustrating because it undermines the whole purpose of a General Admission ticket, which promises both race and concert access.

Why It‚Äôs Outrageous

1.	Yas Marina says the After Race Concert is part of the General Admission package. Splitting QR codes undermines this and enables fraud.
2.	Viagogo didn‚Äôt verify the seller and refused to take responsibility.
3.	Yas Marina‚Äôs flawed system let this happen, ruining the experience for fans like us.

What Needs to Change
‚Ä¢	Viagogo: Vet sellers and refund incomplete tickets.
‚Ä¢	Yas Marina Circuit: Revert to a single QR code for General Admission or fix the loopholes.
‚Ä¢	Fans: Avoid third-party platforms unless you can confirm both QR codes.

We paid a premium for the Abu Dhabi GP and missed the concert‚Äîone of the main highlights‚Äîbecause of this mess. F1 is supposed to be a world-class experience, and fans shouldn‚Äôt be left vulnerable to scams.

Anyone else have a similar experience? Let‚Äôs raise awareness so this doesn‚Äôt happen again.

1hbw6xz,There is a very high probability that we have never seen and will never see the potentially best drivers of all time because the pool of people practising the sport is extremely small,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hbw6xz/there_is_a_very_high_probability_that_we_have/,2024-12-11, Discussion,"I love this sport, don't get me wrong. However, I always have this thought that we will never see so many talented people. People who are certainly even better than Senna, Schumacher, Hamilton or Verstappen, which is the reason why, although I love this sport and watch every race, I don't take it as seriously as football(soccer) or basketball, for example

Unlike in sports like football or basketball, which are very easily accessible without having sponsors or rich parents, you can assume that we actually see a large proportion of the best and most talented people on the planet in this sport (of course there is still room for improvement, e.g. in China or India the potential is not even realised in these sports). The fact that very untalented people like Stroll, Mazepin and Taki Inoue were or still are able to compete in this class is unthinkable in the NBA, for example (Yes, there is currently a big exception with the Lakers, but apart from that there was no such thing). One of the reasons for this is that the teams drive cars of different strengths, so you often can't tell from the outside how good the driver really is.

It has definitely improved, I think the talent pool was way smaller 50 years ago than it is today, but even in 50 years nothing will change much, it is what it is. I just wanted to see if there are people here who feel the same way I do","[""Wasn't it Michael that said something about how the best driver in the world could be driving a bus in Buenos Aires or something like that?"", 'This is true of many activities, not just sport.', 'Also reason why we might be waiting a loooong time for a female F1 champ.

What you‚Äôre talking about are people who somehow have the innate ability to be better than Lewis, rather than people who are better. You can‚Äôt be better than someone at something you‚Äôre not actively doing. It‚Äôs like me saying I believe I‚Äôm a better tennis player than Djokovic but we‚Äôll never know because I don‚Äôt play tennis.\n\nIt also underestimates the amount of work that goes into being an all time great. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúoh given the opportunity, so and so would beat Lewis‚Äù because Lewis had raw talent and an incredible amount of work ethic and dedication.\n\nMazepin and Stroll had noteworthy accomplishments in lower formulas so they are still, despite their lackluster F1 performances, among the top talents in the world.', 'You are unable to take Formula 1 seriously because there could be a potential 10x world champion working a dead end job right now? Did I hear that right', 'Dude, not all of our parents are multimillionaires and/or former racers/ car mechanics.', 'Junior: ""Sharp as fucking cue ball""', 'Calling Stroll very untalented is a bit of a stretch there.

But ""not taking the sport as seriously as soccer"" just makes me laugh. These are highly trained, highly specialised athletes in a high-tech sport.
