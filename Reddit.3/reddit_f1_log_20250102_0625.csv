Can't wait to see him as to how fast he manages to reignite his speed in a Ferrari car.\n\nExcited even to see Antonelli in a Mercedes.

Albon in a Williams will be fun to watch as well."", "">The first images and videos of Lewis Hamilton in red driving a Ferrari and the coverage for that is just going to be insane.\n\nI think Ferrari need to be really careful about this. There is a lot of expectation that Hamilton is going to step into the Ferrari and immediately be the Hamilton of old, challenging for race wins and championships immediately. But it takes time to adapt to a new team. Ferrari has its own culture, its own procedures that it follows. There are relationships that need to be formed between Hamilton and the people that he's working with. And then even if Ferrari build a car that can challenge for race wins from the jump, Hamilton has been struggling with the 2022 generation of cars -- the working theory at the moment is that the regulations themselves just don't suit his driving style, and that it's not something that he can just drive around. Because if anybody can do that, it's Lewis Hamilton. Since he hasn't been able to do that, it's probably not something that can be done. And then there's the way he turns 40 in less than a week. Age catches up to all of us eventually. So I think expectations need to be tempered a little bit; last time he switched teams -- back in 2013 -- he only got a single race win and finished fourth overall. If Ferrari aren't careful, people who expect Hamilton to immediately start winning are probably going to be disappointed, and so the team will be under extra pressure to deliver, and that's when mistakes start creeping in."", 'MY BODY IS GETTING READY TO BE HURT AGAIN', '![gif](giphy|l0HlF6YoW9cOSfpXG|downsized)', "">which surely justifies Wolff's belief in his talent & speed\n\nIt's not about Wolff's belief. It's about Wolff's ego. He's desperate to find the next Verstappen, even moreso once it became once clear that Hamilton was leaving Mercedes. Sure, everyone raves about Antonelli's success in Formula 4 and Formula Regional, but look at the careers of everyone he was racing against -- most of them went on to achieve very little in Formula 3. I think there's a chance that Antonelli is a very good driver who appears better than he actually is because he was racing against drivers who weren't all that good to begin with. To me, the real problem here comes from the aftermath of free practice in Monza. Mercedes spent the week beforehand hyping up Antonelli -- there were even rumours that Toto Wolff would get on the radio at the end of FP1 and announce his signing live in the middle of the broadcast -- but when he crashed, it was obvious that they had no idea what to do next because it never crossed their mind that this could happen. A lot of Hamilton's late-season comments about the readiness of young drivers seemed to be designed for an audience of one: Kimi Antonelli. They really do sound like a warning about the intense scrutiny he's going to face this year. He might be quick on track, but he's seventeen years old. He has next to no media experience and he's probably pretty naive when it comes to things like public relations. If Antonelli doesn't perform, it could be disastrous for his career. I cannot think of a single driver who has had this much pressure and expectation piled upon them before the even got into the car. Not even Hamilton.\n\nI genuinely think that the best thing for Antonelli would be to spend another year in Formula 2 and make a serious bid for the title. Because on balance, I'm not convinced that he's ready."", 'Antonelli is fast but the question is more about his consistency at this level, there’s no use in being quick if you put the car in the wall every third race', '>I think Ferrari need to be really careful about this.\n\nNot just Ferrari at this rate. I think we need to adjust our own expectations to the basis of what you have described, and set it to a reasonable metric. He has the (dis)advantage(?) of being Lewis Hamilton, so expectations will be blown off the roof immediately the moment he steps into the new car. It is important to remember what you have described before the reactions takes can come forth. Unfortunately, I am not sure if people will heed that, going forward into the new season ;-;', "">I genuinely think that the best thing for Antonelli would be to spend another year in Formula 2 and make a serious bid for the title. Because on balance, I'm not convinced that he's ready.\n\nI think you have said everything that I felt about Antonelli and why I am generally very hesitant about his placement in Mercedes. This would have been the best outcome. No ill will against him in the slightest, and I know you have mentioned this, but Wolff's insistence on getting Antonelli in that seat ASAP to make up for the fact that he did not manage to get Verstappen when he was available back then *(I am unsure whether he actually feels that way or he has actually said that he feels that way)* or the insistence of finding the next Verstappen is very wayward\n\nAs much as my doubts are evident, there is nothing we can do now but hope for the best in Mercedes' position. Either way, one thing that remains clear: one of the two drivers from the team will have their stock fall immensely this season""]",0,13,0.46,0,11,11,0,4,0.0,0
1hrh64v,Senna being disqualified or Hamilton in 2021?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hrh64v/senna_being_disqualified_or_hamilton_in_2021/,2025-01-02, Discussion,"Just finished watching Senna on Netflix, it covers historical events that helped me view F1 in a new light. The 80s they seem to have been full of controversy. Aside from that comparing 

1) Senna and the issues from the jump start, potential forced accident and disqualification from the race that should have won another world championship. 

2) Hamilton's 2021 in review and the last laps of the final race.

Which is more controversial? 

Which has a larger impact on their legacies? 

What could have been?","['Senna being disqualified didn’t cost him the championship.
