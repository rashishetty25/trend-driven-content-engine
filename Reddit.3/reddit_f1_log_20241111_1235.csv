We mostly only see him in/post incident in actual race footage, or we see him driving or in a press conference (in which case his presence is usually glossed over or ignored completely). \n\nI agree he wouldn’t still be a driver though if not for his father’s ownership.

This figure is to be drastically reduced (150 euros?), introducing important bans on additive substances.

That’s over 1500km, a 3 hour flight. All flights were sold out, so they had chartered flights, as well as many people going by bus (a multiple day journey, as it is over 28 hours to drive). And for people originating from elsewhere in Argentina, the journey was likely longer… it was a big deal.', ""I don't think they understand that these are not big distances for South Americans, especially for sport fans. Europeans can cross multiple countries in like two hours, so they can't get their head around South Americans traveling 28 hours for a game, which some people do regularly for Copa América and stuff."", 'And? What’s your point. That sounds like normal travel problems. lol.', 'Well, you said you didn’t get it, and that it was not like it was far. I’d say it is a pretty big deal for a big amount of people to be mobilising like that - and the distance is certainly not short. But if you’re just salty for no reason there’s nothing I can do!', 'It’s just fans going to a race. lol. It’s not that crazy.', 'It’s the first time in over 20 years that Argentinians have a F1 driver, so it is kind of crazy for them. Did you watch the video?
