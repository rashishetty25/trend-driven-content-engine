1n2rcye,Schumacher & Hill 1994,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n2rcye/schumacher_hill_1994/,2025-08-28, Discussion,"I want to do this post as a way of proving something rather unpopular (to my own amusement). The general consensus in here seems to be that Schumacher did not deserve the championship, when in reality it was Hill who, even with the clear faster car, the FIA and the media on his side, couldn‚Äôt battle with Schumacher with 4 races less.

I‚Äôm going to go race by race proving how this general idea is just wrong:

Races 1-4: Senna and the early Season

Upon the start of the 1994 season, Senna (past his prime already) although struggling was outpacing Hill by an alarming margin, the first 3 races saw how Hill got severely outpaced by more than 0.7% (even reaching 2% at the first qualy in Brazil), the race pace was no different, we saw that in Brazil were before Senna's DNF, Hill already got lapped by lap 50. Without Senna nothing changed in Monaco where he got outqualified by an inferior Ferrari and Mclaren, and crashed into Hakkinen on turn one retiring on the spot.

Races 5-8: First win and first ""real"" controversy

In Spain Hill gets his first victory, a race where he won due to Schumacher's problem with the gearbox, where he had to do almost 2/3 of the race stuck in 5th gear.

Canada and France came and with that 2 appalling qualifying sessions, being just 0.1% infront of a rookie and a 41 year old driver that came out of retirement, although in favor of him, he clearly outpaced them in the race, but this was not enough to beat a Schumacher at his best and even though he had the faster car in both cases, he came behind.

Great Britain came and with that the first ""real"" controversy, Schumacher overtook Hill on the formation laps, something done also by other drivers but ignored (eg: Hakkinen clearly overtook Alesi), that was not allowed and that 5 second stop/go penalty was deserved, what clearly was not was the DSQ which only ocurred due to FIA not communicating correctly with Benetton (the penalty was first believed to be for a non existant false start and later rectified), that and the 2 race ban was just a farce needed to keep the interest in F1 alive because of Schumacher's domination of the season and the lack of champions in the grid (which was one of the reasons Williams called Mansell to race again).

Races 9-13: Hill's ""Golden"" Run

In Germany he crashed into Katayama and had to pit and fall to the back of the grid not getting any points in a crucial race where Schumacher had to retire due to an engine failure.

In Hungary he could only achieved second against a mighty Schumacher (although to be fair he had slightly the worse car).

Fast forward to Belgium, Italy and Portugal, the latter 2 without Schumacher, this 3 races (and the others I've pointed out) were very important in the point I am stressing, in them, Hill was outpaced by a rookie teammate and only ended up ahead due to team orders prioritizing him, 3 race wins in a row where team orders and heavy luck came in handy since he also won due to Ferrari's mechanical DNF's in both Italy and Portugal were even without Schumacher he was unable to win fair and square.

Race 14-16: Title Deciders

At Jerez, Schumacher came back and Hill went back to the same old not being able to take the battle to him even though he had the faster car.

In Suzuka he was benefited with the SC and subsequent red flag due to Schumacher's low fuel strategy that was characteristic of the Benetton team, this allowed Hill to run on free air which ultimately gave him the victory (more luck for Hill).

In came Australia, again Hill, unable to deliver saw how (again with the faster car) his teammate got pole and his (artificially fabricated) title contender qualified in front of him. Here is where I have to say that although I firmly think the crash was not deliberate it was totally Schumacher's fault.

Now with this context in mind let's get some data (team performance table and championship points):

https://preview.redd.it/91zj4enleulf1.png?width=1877&format=png&auto=webp&s=af1e4b4234fc867df3632cb81a54b322ebd27221

https://preview.redd.it/hh4sqenleulf1.png?width=1843&format=png&auto=webp&s=0322415660b10643bbca7d2fbbf89efe642f8796

To not be accused of being biased I've excluded the team orders and included Belgium DSQ (although the two tables are available)

If we correct the bad luck and remove the team orders, Schumacher could‚Äôve sealed the championship as early as Belgium, five races before the end. In that context, the 2 race ban wouldn‚Äôt have mattered.

So in conclusion, all this data (which is just a miniscule of all that there is) proves just the opposite of the general idea. 1994 should be hailed as one of Schumacher's greatest seasons. Hill, even while having the car, the FIA, and the media on his side, he still couldn‚Äôt deliver.","[""I think some journalists summarised perfectly at the time as 'the right champion, the wrong way'."", ""I've never seen a single person try to argue that Damon Hill was better than Michael Schumacher.\n\nWhen people say Michael didn't deserve the title, it's the allegations of cheating against both him and the team. They are arguing for a DSQ.\n\nIt's missing the point to avoid that subject and start debating performances in each race."", 'A Michael Schumacher defense post? Did I time travel to [Grandprix.com](http://Grandprix.com) forums in 2004 or something?', 'The very first part:\n\n>I want to do this post as a way of proving something rather unpopular (to my own amusement). The general consensus in here seems to be that Schumacher did not deserve the championship, when in reality it was Hill who, even with the clear faster car, the FIA and the media on his side, couldn‚Äôt battle with Schumacher with 4 races less.\n\n1. You\'re not proving anything here.\n\n2. Schumacher is one of the most popular drivers on this forum, so to claim you\'re proving something ""rather unpopular"" is completely wrong.\n\n3. The general consensus is not at all that schumacher didn\'t deserve the ch\'ship. Not sure why you\'d think so, see point 2.\n\n4. Still wearing a tin foil hat I see with the fia and in particular \'the media\' on hill\'s side. Yes, all the world\'s media are in it, they\'re all being governed from a central point, lets call it the \'Great Hidden Lizard Cave\', and their goal is to conquer the world by rooting for hill and being anti-schumacher.\n\n5. Schumacher didn\'t do 4 races less.\n\nThen, immediately after that:\n\n>I‚Äôm going to go race by race proving how this general idea is just wrong:\n\n>Races 1-4: Senna and the early Season\n\n>Upon the start of the 1994 season, Senna (past his prime already)\n\n1. Again, you\'re not proving anything here.\n\n2. Senna was anything but past his prime. He just came off a season in which he had performed racing miracles. And he was immediately completely dominating his incumbent teammate. Ask anyone on the current grid who changed teams how easy peasy that is. \n\nThe man did one spin exploring the limits of the flawed, not yet correctly developed treacherous car, in order to give it all and win in front of his home crowd, and it gets used as being ""proof"" of being over the hill by self-proclaimed general prosecutors.\n\nNeedless to say, I stopped reading after the quoted stuff.', 'Saying Senna was past his prime is absolute bs stopped reading after that part.', ""Regardless of how you got there, if you have to resort to cheating, you don't deserve whatever you win."", 'Hill was no all time great but I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôve decided to savage him here. \nWhy say nothing about illegal traction control and illegal modifications to fuelling rigs that Schumacher benefited from? Schumacher might have been the better driver and would be deserving of the championship if he‚Äôd not crashed into Hill deliberately.', ""Yeah there was an insane number of attempts to interfere with the championship and help Williams out that year.   \n  \nThey really didn't like the idea of this upstart young German in a team owned by a clothing company taking on a grandee team that first suffered a horrific tragedy and were then led by a great British hope and son of a heroic figure.\n\nIn reality Hill was not remotely close to being in the same league as Schumacher if you look at it objectively, as you point out."", '‚ÄúDeserve‚Äù as in being the obviously superior driver? Yes. But also, ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù as should we allow intentionally crashing out yourself and your opponent as legitimate racing moves? Then no. Fortunately F1 would never allow something like that today. Just look at Max. His ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù style looks like a grandma driving to church on Sunday in comparison to Schumacher (and sure, Prost and Senna too). And yet he gets penalties all the time, almost even copping a race ban.\n\nBecause the crash was clearly intentional. There‚Äôs no doubt about that and no longer even a debate. Even those who were dense on purpose back then to ‚Äúgive the benefit of a doubt‚Äù had to chew on their words in 97 when he tried it again.\n\nAnd yeah, Hill was probably one of the worse champions. He started really late. But when you say he almost got beaten by his ‚Äúrookie‚Äù teammate, you can‚Äôt compare rookie back then to now. Back then there was unlimited testing, so Villeneuve had driven many thousands of miles in the car. He knew the car extremely well. So he wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrookie‚Äù in the same sense as today. Also, it wasn‚Äôt just anyone, it was Jacques Villeneuve. He had just won Indycar AND Indy500 in his second season (actually, Indy505, lol). And back then there were still a few legends in the series.He was a top notch driver.\n\nAlso, if F1 really tried to have Hill win it - they could obviously have penalized Schumacher in the end. Which they didn‚Äôt. Which proves it beyond any doubt.']",0,61,0.4,0,197,197,0,0,0.030000000000000027,0
