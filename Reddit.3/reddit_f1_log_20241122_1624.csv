1gx8ffr,Who will be the next American (USA) F1 Driver?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gx8ffr/who_will_be_the_next_american_usa_f1_driver/,2024-11-22, Discussion,"This is a question I asked on this Reddit around 2.5 years ago (just after it was announced Andretti had a good chance of getting on the grid!) - (https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/sw8s2i/who\_will\_be\_the\_next\_american\_usa\_f1\_driver/)

Although at the time Sergeant was the only American driver in F2, the comments make it seem like none of us had much confidence he'd make it. 

With Logan now out and the US still a massive and expanding market for F1; I thought it would be interesting to ask again. Frankly, this time it seems even less obvious who it might be.

I see the options as:

* Jak Crawford - The best placed American in F2 (currently 5th), with links to Aston Martin. However, frankly, I think its unlikely Aston would put him in their car.
* Juan Manuel Correa - Sadly will perhaps always be best know for being part of Hubert's tragic crash.
* Max Esterson - Stepping up to F2 next weekend, but does not have great results over the last few years.
* Ugo Ugochukwu - Unlike the last time I asked when there were 5 Americans in F3, there is only Esterson this year and so far only Ugochukwu confirmed for next year. He is perhaps the most exciting US prospect having won Macau last weekend and being a long-term part of the McLaren junior programme. But like Bortoleto would he need to go elsewhere to get an F1 drive?
* Colton Herta - Still fairly young Andretti driver who could come across with them?

Again, an honourable mention to Pato O'Ward who grew up in Texas but was born in Mexico - who drives for McLaren in Indy but has expressed an interest in coming to F1 before. Nowadays, I'd see him more as a possible stand in for a F1 race in the Americas if Lando or Oscar were injured. ","[""If Colton wants the drive.

It's impossible until someone goes and does it, and it was definitely doable.\n\nAlso, the 80 point gap was at Silverstone, when Lando had already lost a lot of points at Spain, Austria and Silverstone. The gap was 54 points after Miami, arguably where McLaren started equalling and later beating Red Bull's pace. Closing 54 points in 18 races (with 4 sprints) was definitely doable especially when Red Bull became the 3rd fastest car at most of the races post summer break.
