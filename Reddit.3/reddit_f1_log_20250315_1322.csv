There‚Äôs no way all his past teammates are this bad. Gasly, Albon, Perez, Lawson all over 6 tenths or more slower than Max in the same car. Hell, Perez was closer in the 2020 RP than he was in 2021 RB, meaning RP was probably the 2nd quickest car in 2020, but Max is just an alien.

It‚Äôs very early; but Albon will probably be at least equal or very very close to Sainz. Obvs it his first quali session, but rarely did drivers close such a deficit over a season and then gain it on top. 

I‚Äôm genuinely starting to think Max might have spoken the truth when he said in 2020 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 2 tenths faster than anyone else‚Äù.  And that ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù included the likes of prime or at least very close to prime Hamilton.

I haven‚Äôt seen this level of domination since Schumacher in the 90‚Äôs. Just levels above everyone. That generation was also made to look bad by him, because great drivers like Barrichello or Irvine who beat almost all of their other teammates, including legends of the 80‚Äôs but also future talents(hell, old Rubens was matching a prime Jensen Button; who wasn‚Äôt that far off Lewis) were absolutely demolished by Schumacher. And the media couldn‚Äôt accept Schumacher was that much better than everyone else, so the entire generation was just deemed weak.

I think Max at this point has the same effect, however this generation is more proven because we‚Äôll have direct comparison between Leclerc-Vettel, Norris-Ricciardo, Russell-Lewis,  Leclerc-Lewis, Albon-Sainz etc.

Max is an all time great calibre of driver but also the car is very difficult to find a balance with that gives the driver confidence. Max can live with that, his teammates haven't been able to and it widens the gap between them.\n\nIf the car was more compliant his teammates would be closer. I remember an interview with Irvine talking about his time at Ferrari and he said every year the car got a little bit easier to drive and he'd get a little bit closer to Michael."", ""It's both. \n\nLike with Schumacher I think there is a gap between Verstappen and the rest of the field. \n\nThe Red Bull is also extremely sensitive and it's appears pretty much impossible for anyone but a driver as attuned to sensitivity as Verstappen to drive the car at 100%."", 'There are still people who underestimate how great Max really is.', ""Max is one of the best drivers to ever do it.\n\nI have no doubts that you could put anyone in the 2nd seat currently and Max would come out ahead.\n\nHowever, drivers like Gasly, Albon, Perez and now Lawson? They're not top drivers, so it's not exactly a big surprise that they are lagging behind Max. OK, maybe a bit too early to judge Lawson, but.... having followed his career for years, he's not really given the impression that he's a top driver. And Red Bull *is* a top team."", 'Of course Max is on another level but here are multiple factors to consider.\nLawson is new at RB, it‚Äôs his first full season, his teammate is the current four time world champion and Max apparently has gotten all the upgrades.\nI wouldn‚Äôt read too much into it.', ""It's already established Max is in that category of truly special driver. A few more seasons of him at this level and I'd have no issue declaring him the GOAT."", ""In terms of consistently staying at peak performances race after race, I think you could make a strong argument that Max is already the greatest driver of all time.\n\nIt doesn't matter who you put next to him, they will falter.\n\nBut Red Bull going with pretty much unproven rookies was never a good idea. Perez at least had a pretty good season before it all started going truly downhill."", ""Here we go again!

On the first day of practice for the Australian GP, all 20 Formula 1 cars were equipped with two additional cameras, which were aimed directly at the front wing and rear wing from both sides. A detailed deployment plan determined which camera was filming which driver in which practice session.\n\n> The 50 gram cameras recorded continuously. This meant that a Formula 1 driver could be at the front right and rear left in the first practice session and vice versa for his team-mate. And the other way round in the second session.\n\n> The world governing body began to keep a closer eye on the teams last year. Word had got around that some cars were equipped with front wings that bent under increasing load in order to shift the aero balance from the front to the rear. Of course, they all passed the static load tests.\n\n>Special high-resolution cameras. \nAt the Belgian GP, the FIA began filming the front wings in order to obtain more information about the degree of bending. The test was continued until the 2024 season finale and ultimately led to a tightening of the static tests from the Spanish GP onwards.\n\n> At the Azerbaijan GP last year, it then emerged that the teams were also playing tricks with the rear wings. McLaren bent the flap upwards on the outside, Ferrari pushed the main blade further down on the inside when the DRS was not activated. The aim of both was to increase the gap between the main blade and the flap. This reduces drag and increases top speed. In technical jargon, the practice is called ‚Äúmini-DRS‚Äù.\n\n> This has now led to the FIA also monitoring the rear wings on video during all Friday practice sessions in Melbourne. However, the referees are not satisfied with the images from the normal TV cameras. The association‚Äôs special cameras have three times the resolution of the TV images.\n\n> No disqualifications in Melbourne. According to Article 3.15.17 of the Technical Regulations, the gap between the wing elements may not increase by more than two millimetres if a force of 750 newtons is applied to the left and right of the wing when stationary.\n\n> If the video recordings show that the gap widens by more than the permitted two millimetres when driving, the FIA can slap the Formula 1 team concerned on the wrist and ask them to rectify the situation. However, disqualification is not possible.\n\n> It is rumoured from association circles that the rules could be tightened in the short term if there are too many violations in the rear as well as the front wing. Otherwise, the analyses will be used to specify the rules for the 2026 Formula 1 season.', 'I love how teams always find ways around rules to find advantages. \n\nThis game of cat and mouse between them and the FIA is one of my favourites things about this sport', 'Repent sinners!

1jb5px4,[AMuS] Can Ferrari annoy the McLaren?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jb5px4/amus_can_ferrari_annoy_the_mclaren/,2025-03-14, News,,"['Full translation: \n\n> The McLaren were at the top of everyone‚Äôs tip sheets. If only because of their legendary long runs. On one lap, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris finished second and third, a good tenth of a second behind the day‚Äôs winner Charles Leclerc. Many experts believe that McLaren is just bluffing. Ferrari team boss Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur is not just clinging to Charles Leclerc‚Äôs best time. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt far away from McLaren in the long run either.‚Äù\n\n> The top speeds were also equal. They were only 0.5 km/h apart. Leclerc was a few hundredths of a second faster than Norris in all three sectors. The race simulations went to the Papaya cars with a slight advantage. Norris was the fastest with an average of 1m 21.903s over eleven laps on medium tyres.\n\n> Leclerc covered three more laps and averaged 1m 22.140s. However, he turned up the power on the last two laps. The picture is similar for his team-mates. Piastri completed eleven laps with an average time of 1m 22.110s. Hamilton averaged 1m 22.228s over 13 laps.\n\n> Where does Mercedes stand? \nMercedes team boss Toto Wolff assesses the situation as follows: ‚ÄúMcLaren is at the front. Then everyone else is in line.‚Äù The Austrian may have to make a correction when it comes to Ferrari. Even after the first day of practice, it is difficult to judge how strong the Silver Arrows themselves are. Mercedes bucked the trend with hard tyres in the long run.\n\n> The engineers were surprised that everyone else opted for medium tyres. They are not worried about this. Continuous rain is forecast for Sunday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll only need rain tyres or intermediates anyway.‚Äù\n\n> George Russell equalled Norris‚Äô long run best time by just a few hundredths on the hard rubber. Andrea Kimi Antonelli put in a decent performance for his first endurance run under real-life conditions. On his fastest lap, the 18-year-old Italian was still four tenths behind his team-mate.\n\n> Explanation: ‚ÄúIt was the first time I had driven with C5 tyres. I didn‚Äôt get them into the window perfectly.‚Äù In general, the Mercedes drivers struggled with Pirelli‚Äôs softest compound. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt gain as much time as we should have. This was possibly due to the asphalt temperatures of over 40 degrees,‚Äù analysed Russell.\n\n> Another explanation is that both Mercedes drivers were too aggressive on their fast laps and then paid for it in the final sector with rear tyres that were too hot. A modest engine mode cost an additional 0.35 seconds over the competition on the straights.\n\n> Should Verstappen be worried? \nThe Formula 1 world champion was quite satisfied with the first practice session. He was four tenths behind Lando Norris in fifth place, although he was held up by Carlos Sainz on his lap. The Dutchman did not have a clean lap in afternoon practice either. After a mistake in turn 3, he abandoned the attempt. He later laboured his way up to seventh place. The gap to the leader was 0.624 seconds.\n\n> The champion then spent 13 minutes in the pits before tackling his long run on medium tyres, which turned into a short run with nine minutes remaining. The set-up was changed during the break. Different front wings were also used. ‚ÄúWe made the car worse compared to the first practice session,‚Äù lamented Head of Sport Helmut Marko.\n\n> The instability in some corners returned. According to their own calculations, McLaren is ahead by three tenths. Ferrari and Verstappen follow. One indication that the Red Bull RB21 still has its moods is the large gap of Liam Lawson. The New Zealander lost six tenths on one lap and 1.2 seconds on the long run to his team captain. ‚ÄúThat should be a little less,‚Äù hoped Marko.\n\n> How good are Toro Rosso and Williams?\nIn the opening session, Williams continued its show from the test drives with first and sixth places for Carlos Sainz and Alexander Albon. Team Principal James Vowles warned: ‚ÄúWe are significantly better than last year, but not as good as it looks.‚Äù In the second session, Sainz and Albon finished eleventh and twelfth with exactly the same lap time, just outside the top 10.\n\n> The blue cars performed differently in the long run. Albon went out twice for five laps each and looked correspondingly good. Sainz finished seventh in the endurance runs. From a Williams driver‚Äôs perspective, five tenths of a second behind the McLaren is not a disaster.\n\n> While Williams surprised in the first session, Toro Rosso set the tone in the second. Yuki Tsunoda finished the session in fourth place, just 0.345 seconds behind the best time. Rookie Isack Hadjar also impressed. Sixth place despite a handicap.\n\n> The Frenchman already cut a fine figure in the morning. But the excellent times came at the price of less petrol and a higher power mode. Hadjar was supposed to practise in the qualifying trim. There was no time for this during the tests. Marko estimates: ‚ÄúWilliams is ahead of us.‚Äù\n\n> Has Haas gambled away? \nThat was a real slap in the face for Haas. Oliver Bearman destroyed his car in a high-speed accident in the 220 km/h chicane in the first practice session. It was not ready for the second practice session. Esteban Ocon finished penultimate in both sessions. 1.6 seconds off the lead and three tenths off the rest.\n\n> The Frenchman complained about balance problems. The engineers were able to solve some of these between the two practice sessions. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs still more to come,‚Äù demanded Ocon. The US Ferrari‚Äôs understeer cannot be completely eradicated. So far, no setup trick has helped. It will probably be up to the aerodynamicists.\n\n> Sauber showed an improvement compared to the test, which Nico H√ºlkenberg underlined with eighth place. The German‚Äôs race simulation was also impressive. With an average of 1:22.592 minutes, the Sauber driver was in the sandwich of the Toro Rosso drivers. Gabriel Bortoleto was sent out on the track with an alternative setup with significantly more downforce. It was a failure. Conclusion: The new parts are starting to work. The car has become much more consistent.\n\n> Are the cars or the track that fast? \nLast year‚Äôs time was beaten by 1.2 seconds in the first practice session and by eight tenths in the second. The reason for this lies in the track and the tarmac. The drivers reported that the track surface offered more grip from the start than before.\n\n> The many support races that put rubber on the track at Albert Park played a positive role here. The rest of the time is spent developing the cars. Sauber Technical Director James Key confirms: ‚ÄúThese cars are real monsters. We‚Äôve never seen so much downforce in Formula 1 as today.‚Äù', 'Based off of this report the pecking order at the top seems to be:\n\nMcLaren, Ferrari in a close 2nd, Max, Mercedes, Liam\n\nAfter that it feels like Williams, VCARB, Aston Martin, and even Sauber all have a shot at the tail end of the points. \n\nWith temperatures set to get even hotter tomorrow it will be interesting to see how much that affects the cars compared to today. Mercedes already struggled on the quali runs today because their tires got too hot, so it could be even worse tomorrow. But on the other hand if they fire up the tires quicker than the rest that could also help them on Sunday when it‚Äôs cold and rainy. So there is a lot that can still change.', 'Can McLaren annoy Ferrari?', ""Three tenths would be depressing.

Obviously losing the Vodafone sponorship and dropping the iconic chrome paint scheme meant they had to start their livery design from scratch, but there is no excuse for how bland and uninspired those cars were.

Also Hadjar was seven tenths quicker than Lawson in Q1 and Tsunoda was 8 tenths faster in Q1. Comsidering the gap between Lawson and Tsunoda was not that big last year when they were team mates it surely begs the question, at least in qualifying pace, is the Racing Bull faster than the Red Bull?! 
Comsidering Yuki was less than two tenths off Max you also have to wonder what time would Max out in in that machine? What he still be third? would he be lower? Could he even be better? 

Also imagine telling someone just one year ago that this is a genuine debate. What do you all think?
