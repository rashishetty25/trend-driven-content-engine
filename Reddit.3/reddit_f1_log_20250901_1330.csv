Watching Hadjar hold his ground in 4th today behind Verstappen (bumped up to 3rd with Norris' DNF) got me wondering this. Obviously, there's plently of jokes about the curse of the second Red Bull seat, and Hadjar getting threatened with a ""demotion"" to Red Bull if he keeps doing well. But honestly, is RB better right now?

I mean, Lawson got off to a miserable start in Red Bull. Then he got 'demoted' to RB and has looked much better since. Yuki looked like he was better off last year at VCARB than he is now at Red Bull (though he's looked a little better since Horner got sacked). Hadjar has looked better than Lawson and Tsunoda, and he's been able to stay at RB. We always hear Verstappen complaining about how shit his car is (sometimes before he pulls off a miracle). I can't help but wonder if Verstappen would look better in an RB car? I mean, what if RB has been the faster car for a few races now and Verstappen has just been working his usual Verstappen magic to make the Red Bull not look as horrible as it is? ","['RBR has a higher ceiling but difficult to drive', 'Most likely easier to drive, but with a lower ceiling.

He did everything right but if it had been any other driver , that P2 wouldn't have been possible. And if it had 2 safety cars less, Hadjar might very possibly be P2 today.

I'm unfamiliar with it"", 'Fantastic interview, and well worth the read.  \n\nThere\'s a kid, handed a box of parts that was once a race car, jigsawing them back together, collecting fabricating skills to do it..  \n\n>I‚Äôve been tremendously fortunate in my career to work with John Barnard, Adrian Newey, Ross Brawn, Pat Symonds, Rory Byrne. I feel awful for leaving anyone out because there‚Äôve been so many. I‚Äôve worked with Flavio Briatore to Christian Horner; I‚Äôve seen both ends of the spectrum. And of course, you learn from all of those experiences and those people.\n\nThat quote speaks a lot.    Even mentioned and accredited Binotto.  \n\nOld school physical hands and knees, working from the bottom to the top, tutelage from 90% of the all-time greats, and also crediting some of the successful managers from the other side of the business and the lesson he learnt.\n\nPerfect marriage. \n\nAlso the quote:\n\n>I once had a very good conversation with Pat Symonds about my career aspirations and where I see myself, and I had to make a choice at that point: go down the managerial route and the people route, or stick with the cars and the engineering that I‚Äôd loved for years. And what F1 taught me more than anything was the power of a team‚Äîand I loved that. At Benetton, when we were fighting for a championship, everyone was looking for the last scrap of performance. I can‚Äôt tell you the energy that it gives you, and it keeps you young, so I made the decision to go into a management career. I‚Äôve never looked back, frankly.\n\n>I love the incredible creativity, the work that the engineering geniuses like Mattia Binotto can create with the right tools. But more than that, I‚Äôve loved managing people, building teams, guiding people in their career paths, seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee. I love all of that, and I love building teams, so it‚Äôs just a bigger team to put together as team principal than it was as a sporting director or mechanic.\n\n\nIt\'s the ""seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee. I love all of that.""', '100%.  The guy was arguably the real reason of their dominance.  \n\nThat\'s the problem with domination, and people have seen it in the Merc downfall.    Team dominates year after year, and no promotions for the key players.   Really showed that bad management style of Toto.  He kept key people in the same positions to maintain the status quo, to impress the board.   \n\nA lot of Toto fans will hate to read this, but Toto bought his way into the sport with Williams.  Lucked into a Merc role after Ross Brawn had to fall on the sword after the illegal tyre test.    In business, it would be called a ""hostile takeover"" by Toto.  No way the board got rid of Ross Brawn if someone wasn\'t earworming them behind the scenes.  Like the Mansour toppling Ron.  \n\nLauda and Toto were at loggerheads, which people forget, and only after Lauda\'s passing, the whole Toto <3 Lauda stuff came to appear.\n\nHaving someone like a Wheately, a James Vowles, or a Paddy Lowe, on a team, where the progression ceiling is just a dead end for years....\n\nAt least someone like Zak Brown recognised that career stagnation of the key people, is a fast course to failure.    Create different position names, where it\'s like a promotion to a new role etc.  Reward people and promote.   Stella for example.  Leaves Ferrari with Alonso, as he knows the Ferrari culture of modern times.   Works his way up from Race Engineer to TP.  \n\nRob Smedley should have been given Ferrari TP a long long time ago.  Long-term F1 key person, and he just left the sport because of that ceiling.\n\nOld school mentality, like Ron in McLaren, having Whitmarsh as the trainee to the crown.  Seasons pass, person still holds on, thinking ... the day will come... and then the day comes, and it\'s too late.  It\'s old school Independent Team mentality.  \n\nHorner shouled have stepped aside, given himself a new role description like Zak, and elevated Wheatley to TP.\n\nMuch like Toto showed that he wasn\'t a natural leader, trying to keep the status quo, rather than reward people to stop them from leaving.', ""Horner's reputation could be a factor but it is also a natural situation that people who have been in their position for quite a long time look for something new. The same happened at Mercedes, a lot of other teams and companies in general around the world. Wheatley could have been a logical successor just like James Vowles at Mercedes but the timing wasn't right. It took too long for the Red Bull HQ to find a way to fire Horner."", 'Why i this argument only ever made about red bull when Merc are in exactl the same situation?', ""It's the site Mike Spinelli put up after he sold Jalopnik, way back in the day."", 'Based on what was Wheatley the ‚Äûreal reason‚Äú, you really need to explain that.\n\nAlso how are the teams supposed to give those promotions what do you do with the people already in that position.\xa0', '>""Simba, one day all this will be your\'s."" \n\nHorner and Toto love the ego appearance of being at the helm and winning.  When in reality, it\'s the people behind them that do all the work.  But so far down the rabbit hole of self-importance, that they forget they\'re just the talking head on cameras.  Great if winning and news pieces with their photos, not so great when not winning.  \n\nZak for example, happy to miss races, and go off doing his other stuff.  Knows that the team will be fine, as he knows his role.  What, he stepped into the head roll from being a commercial side, finding sponsors and schmoozing. \n\nFerrari during the Schumacher years, Stefano was the commercial side head, looking after sponsor VIPs at races, give a few speeches with a glass of champagne in his hand, smile at whoever got the tickets from the sponsors that weekend.   Then thrown into the role to replace Todt and lucked in with the Kimi 07 title. \n\nF1 team heads, it\'s all ego, always has been.  Then when key people leave, they act like a jilted lover who has been cheated on.  \n\nToto should have just given himself an Executive title, and put Vowles as TP.    But again, people like Horner, Toto, Jordan, loved the publicity of it all.\n\nWheatley should have been TP many years ago.    Can\'t wait to cheer on Audi.\n\nEditing to add:  Lawrence Stroll could quite easily have put himself as Team Principal, and soaked in all the TV live interviews and celebrations when doing well.   People can talk shit about him all they like, criticising etc.  At least he knows how to manage.  Fly in and out of a few races, heli into the factory, step into the office, get a rundown of what is going on, fly out.  \n\nQuick question for anyone that survived this essay, would you rather work for a company that had a Toto or Horner helicoptering, or someone like Zak or Stroll?']",43,22,0.94,43,20,20,3,1,0.009999999999999898,3

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

This sort of crap has happened all season. May I remind people that it was *the inciting factor* in drama in even Saudi Arabia - the idea that the inside car is just allowed priority to run the outside car wherever they want, even when it goes against anything intuitive about racing - it's just been getting pushed further and further until it's finally hit a logical extreme that exposes how it never made sense. The rules about corner ownership needed to be destroyed a long time ago."", ""If the roles were reversed, this wouldn't even been half as controversial\n\nThe rules whether you like or not are clear and these drivers have agreed to them"", 'The ""ahead at the apex"" rule is so idiotic.

No two incidents are exactly the same even if they look the same from the outside.\n\nOne time the driver on the inside can completely miss the turn and cause a collision, another time the driver on ghe outside can be at fault.\n\nYou can't judge every incident the same way because then you get shit like this."", 'as a fan of both these drivers, this one hurt. anyone remember that hartley/stroll incident in canada? like, buddy on the outside probably shouldnt have been there, but bless him for his courage. then catastrophe. even the russell/stappen thing... bummer dudes. i guess the lesson is to expect oversteer if youre going around the outside. hope lawson gets a drive next year and sainz smokes albon next year. f1 is so friggin cool.', ""Sometimes things are just a racing incident and don't need a penalty either"", 'As others have said, this video is crap because it doesn\'t even seek to engage with the rules as they are.\n\nThe big change from last year was making express that if you ""own"" the corner (axle > mirror on the inside), **you are allowed to run the other driver off**. This was made clear after Jeddah, when Piastri ran Verstappen off at Turn 1 and the stewards ruled it was OK because of the new rules. George Russell explained that:\n\n>‚ÄúA lot of drivers are aligned that if you are the overtaking car on the inside, rule number one is you have to be able to stay on the circuit,‚Äù he said.\n\n>‚Äú**If you\'re able to stay on the circuit, you are in your right to run the driver wide**, as it has been for all of us since go-karting.\n\n>‚ÄúIf you\'re overtaking somebody on the inside, you\'ve got the right to run them wide.‚Äù  \n\\- [Revealed: The new F1 racing rules that sealed Verstappen penalty - The Race](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/revealed-new-f1-2025-racing-rules-verstappen-jeddah-penalty/)\n\nLike others, I\'m not a fan of that rule - at least when the driver on the inside is the overtaking car. Imo, if you\'re overtaking, you need to leave space on exit. There\'s also an inconsistency depending who you classify to be the ""overtaking"" and ""defending"" cars, which makes chicanes tricky.\n\nBut them\'s the rules as they are. They have been applied like this all season. Sainz can hardly be surprised.\n\nAll that said, in this case, Lawson wasn\'t even the overtaking car, he was the defending one, and he kept the car on the track. So even on my ""I don\'t agree with the rules"" view, Sainz is the one who has the onus to make the move cleanly. And you can hear from the onboard that, at the point of contact, he\'s on the throttle. So all in all, he was in a position to avoid it.']",12,94,0.53,12,88,88,7,10,0.010000000000000009,7

These rules of engagement are not conducive for actual racing. A driver can simply be ahead at the apex, know they have right of way, meaning they can just drive to the outside of the corner knowing they cannot be challenged, or if an accident occurs knowing they will not be at fault.

We need cars to go side by side to overtake, it‚Äôs just a fact. If a car can hold the outside line, for almost the entire corner, and be almost in line or at least half way up to the car alongside it, the inside driver should be required to leave one cars width in the exit. 

The current rules allow two cars in to a corner, but only one to come out. If two go in, two should come out. We are losing classic battles and excitement in the sport. 

Would really love to see something changed. Rant over!","[""The problem is trying to have a one size fits all rule.

Just because you know it will be deemed the other drivers fault doesn‚Äôt mean there is no consequences for making contact.  That incident ended Lawson‚Äôs race just as much as it ended Carlos‚Äôs.  The 10 second penalty wouldn‚Äôt be relevant to either one of the drivers results because they were both about a lap out of any points anyway.', ""Can I ask your opinion on the Russell vs Leclerc overtake that didn't get penalised?"", ""The problem is that you are obliged to give space only in some cases. But if you already gave space, you can't change lines to crash into someone and have them take penalty. Because giving space wasn't mandatory. \n\nLawson was inside and sainz was outside. Then Lawson just abandoned his line to crash into sainz.\n\nThe cleanest rule of engagement is that you can't force driver in front to abandon his own line to give you space. But if the overtaking car is along side, driver in front can't push him out.\n\nThe ambiguity comes from the definition of along side and definition of line in complex curves."", 'I thought Leclerc was overly optimistic and that many other penalties have been handed out for less.

Isack's podium allowed him to go from 11th to eighth, and Lance got closer to the Top 10 with another 7th place finish. Meanwhile, a haul of eight points for Ollie saw him hit double digits.

Red Bull got me into F1; Verstappen and Tsunoda were my introduction to it, I was most aware of the Red Bull sports brand outside of F1 beforehand, Red Bull is (basically) an Austrian team (which is where I live), and Hadjar is an incredibly likable rookie.

As I learned more about the different teams and drivers, I was immediately drawn to Russell and, by extension, Mercedes. Maybe it‚Äôs ironic, but I find his beef with Verstappen incredibly entertaining. I like Antonelli, and overall I like the Mercedes brand and leadership.

After Russell, I‚Äôd probably say my second favorite driver is Verstappen, maybe followed by Hadjar, with Antonelli, Stroll, Albon, Leclerc, and Piastri (if I have to choose a McLaren driver) as some others I like to watch.
