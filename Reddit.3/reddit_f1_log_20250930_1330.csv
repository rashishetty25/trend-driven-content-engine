It makes me wonder: do we as fans (and maybe even F1 itself) treat sprint race wins as if they don’t count? They show up in the stats, but when people talk about ""race wins,"" they clearly mean only Grand Prix wins.

So are sprint victories basically meaningless in the grand scheme of things, or should they be recognized as real wins just like a GP? And if they are meaningless, then why is F1 so hellbent on adding more sprint races every season?
