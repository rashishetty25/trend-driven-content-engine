There's a maximum of 43 points available each weekend (25 for the fastest stop, 18 for the second fastest stop), which means that McLaren can only earn 4x43=172 points at most, which isn't enough to close the 204-point gap, even if Ferrari failed to score a single point at the next four races.

So congrats to Ferrari on a dominant season in the pits, they win their second Fastest Pit Stop Award after winning the inaugural one in 2015, become only the second team to win it multiple times and dethrone Red Bull who had won it the past 7 years.

‚Äò‚ÄôMust bring‚Äô‚Äô -

- *Electrolytes* -> Reached 35 degrees, the water stations are easily accessed, but electrolytes really saved the day and kept us feeling well, we got a tube of 24 tablets which was the perfect amount for 2 of us https://amzn.eu/d/6C9X4Rb
- *Cooling towels* -> Keep you cool during the day, fill up pouches using water from the water station and wear them when you get to hot, we got a pack of 4 between 2 of us allowing you to switch when one dries out https://amzn.eu/d/dbJnYl3
- *Portable misting fan* -> Great at keeping you cool when you‚Äôre sat down in the sun for a long period of time and great when on the bus transport back to the city https://amzn.eu/d/gHBIZPO
- *Bleacher seat* -> Turn 12 stands are metal bleachers with no back support, these seats provide cushioning and a back, the bleachers are 11 inches deep so some brands are way too big impacting the leg room of people behind, best I could find was 13 inches which was perfect and even had a drinks holder https://a.co/d/6SWin68
- *Hat*/*Sunglasses*/*Portable charger*/*Ear plugs* (if you don‚Äôt have an Amex radio)/*Light rain jacket*/*Sun cream*/*Refillable water bottle* are all items I would highly recommend

What not to bring (suggested on some forums to bring but useless in 2025) -

- *Cash* -> COTA has been cashless since 2021 so cash is useless, ended up spending our cash at restaurants instead and for fuel as cash prices were cheaper
- *Lanyard with plastic sleeve* -> All tickets are now on mobiles with no screenshots allowed, you need to show your phone each time for access to the stands
- *Water in a insulated metal cooling flask*/*Snacks* -> The metal sets off the detectors at the entry, this sends you for bag screening and they order you to empty your drinks onto the floor, my brother had a plastic water bottle and got through each time with no search allowing him to keep water and anything he had in his bag, snacks aren‚Äôt allowed but only if you get caught

Useful information -

- *Mobile data* was invaluable, we got this whilst at baggage reclaim from an app called Airalo, ¬£15 for unlimited data, ¬£2.50 off for both people if you share your personal code when purchasing
- *F1 organised coaches* were brilliant, well worth the money, huge number of buses so queue was always moving and nice being driven out after a long day
- *Renting a car* was very useful as staying in an Airbnb south of the river, saved us taxi money, parking right next to Waterloo park (where the shuttles are) for $20, a taxi back on the first day cost us $35 one way, also useful in the evenings for parking at restaurants
- *Amex card holders* get free race radios at the circuit, you can collect on any day and keep, the same commentary as you would hear in the UK and kept you in the loop, also acted as ear plugs
- *Turn 12 grandstand* was the best turn in my option, you could see 2/3rd‚Äôs of the track including turn 1 and we saw all the major action that happened, there was a TV in front of blocks 6-8 which was very useful (you can see it from all blocks at turn 12 but closer the better to see timing tower), the higher up you are the better, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth paying for the last two rows, we were row 32 and it was perfect for the price
- *Food prices* - Expect to spend ‚Ç¨40-60 a day on food/drink at the circuit, very expensive, but can save money on drinks/snacks by purchasing them at the small self checkout vendors

*Disclaimer - This is all my opinion based on my experience, feel free to comment with what you found useful and ask any questions and I might be able to help, will ignore/delete any unhelpful/negative comments*","['They were also giving out free electrolytes at guest services. \nAlso, saw several people freeze water bottles and bring in.', 'Wow, thanks for the info!\n\nHope you had a good time.', 'Pretty much spot on.

An hour or so of partying makes the exit much better.\n\nBut we may bus next year', 'I saw an F1 race at COTA a couple of years ago and 2 WEC races there, including in 2024. So this is based on my experience and may not be valid for you. \n\nYou should think about what you want to do other than being at the track. You may spend as much or more time away from the track as at it. Even though every time I have gone to COTA I spent every minute I could at the track, I spent almost as much time awake and away from the track. \n\n1. Make sure you get the right info about where you need to enter and exit, COTA doesn‚Äôt always post or provide the correct information. \n\n2. Be ready for lines. Everywhere. Getting to the track, at the track, trying to leave the track, after leaving the track. Not as bad as at Spa, but they‚Äôre everywhere. \n\n3. Be prepared for a LOT heat and a LOT of sun, but also check the forecast for rain. Normally it is hot and sunny, brutally so if you‚Äôre not accustomed to Austin weather. But when it rains it can be nasty. Check out this year‚Äôs WEC race on YouTube to get an idea. \n\n4. Pay off your credit cards ahead of time or get your credit limit raised. It‚Äôs expensive for F1. I spent less for the VIP lounge at a WEC race than I did for a bleacher seat at Turn 6 for the F1 race. \n\n5. DO NOT take local taxis. I have heard horror stories about the ‚Äúapproved‚Äù taxis and seen pimps that looked more trustworthy. \n\n6. Uber in Austin is weird but will get you where you want to go. In 2024 I only had one Uber that  didn‚Äôt have a broken windshield and a really strange driver. One guy was talking about handing out free booze to potentially underage people for some events, another was watching anime with subtitles while driving. That being said, I would take an Uber over one of those ‚Äútaxis‚Äù any day.\n\n7. Get a hotel as close to the track as possible and book way in advance. You will be competing with not just F1 teams, but teams from support races and suppliers, plus people in town for non-racing business. Austin is the capital of Texas. \n\n8. Go to dinner and sightseeing in downtown. Austin is a fantastic place. Spend extra time there to enjoy it. For any really good restaurant, make reservations way in advance for the same reason as booking hotels early.\n\n9. If you like beer, there‚Äôs lots of local breweries, check them out. Also, if you like cigars there are good cigar shops in town. \n\n10. At the WEC race in 2024 they ran out of beer on race day BEFORE THE RACE STARTED. COTA doesn‚Äôt always plan well, so be prepared for disappointment. \n\n11. If you have bleacher seats, bring something to sit on. Your ass will thank you.\n\n12. Cargo pants and jackets with lots of pockets are a helpful. COTA security scans you and checks your bags when you enter. Pockets, not as much. Also, bags can be a pain in the ass to carry and watch. \n\nThis became longer than I expected and is based on my experience but hopefully it‚Äôs useful to someone.', ""If you have someone in your group that has special dietary needs, I emailed the ADA contact and got permission to bring in outside food and beverage. This was in 2024. No one cared about our food at the gate, but I appreciated having the email as backup.

1ohw2ct,Turn 1 lap 6 incident.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohw2ct/turn_1_lap_6_incident/,2025-10-28, Discussion,"I‚Äôm hopeful that since a full day has passed from the race, that we can have a more reasonable discussion about this incident.

On the ‚ÄúDriving Standards Guideline section A. ii)‚Äù it states the following:

‚ÄúBe driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex, and not have ‚Äúdived in‚Äù

Here is the link for that: https://static.fanpage.it/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/06/f1_driving_standards_guidelines_version_4.1_feb_20_2025.pdf

On Max‚Äôs onboard, we can see that Max hits the inside red sausage kerb located on the apex of the corner with his front right tire. This kerb is further inside the track of the normal red and white curb and it‚Äôs also much more pronounced. 

As a result of that impact Max loses control of the car and has to take corrective steering action. As he is sawing at the wheel, his front left makes contact with Lewis‚Äôs front right. 

How is this not in violation of the quoted section of the guidelines? 

If it is not a violation of the guideline, then it implies that as long as the car on the inside is first to apex, they cannot be deemed at fault for any incident. Further implying that any car attempting to defend their position on the outside of a corner, should concede immediately. The steward‚Äôs incident report pretty much confirmed this as they investigated Lewis for this contact and not Max. 

While I understand that the drivers voted for this, I simply don‚Äôt agree with it and it think it makes the racing product dull. 

I would much rather have something similar to what Indy car does. 

1) The defending car must be proactive and choose its line of defense. 

2) The attacking car is then responsible for carrying out a clean overtake. 

Sections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 of the Indycar rulebook can be found here: https://epaddock.indycar.com/docs/default-source/rules-regulations-and-policies/indycar-rulebook.pdf

Their rules are significantly more clear and I feel that they allow for far more exciting racing than what we currently have in F1. They are also more in line with what is the norm in other series and what is taught in most racing schools and lower level of competition.

I think it‚Äôs also time for F1 to have paid, professional and permanent stewards. Not only for consistency but more importantly, precedent. The best drivers on the grid, like Max, tend to push the line of what is acceptable in the rules and those rulings define how all drivers behave after. This leads to a degradation of driving standards over time and we continue to find ourselves in situations where we are changing the rules over and over. I feel like this is not too much to ask of a sport with a valuation in the 10+ billion dollar range. 
","['Verstappen could have been at fault if the speed he took would have meant that he was not staying on track which would have made his passing attempt invalid. The reality is that Verstappen was ahead by the apex and stopped on track but Hamilton turned into the apex when he no longer had the right of way which meant that they had a slight collision.\n\nAccording to the rules Hamilton should have taken a wider racing line and given the corner to Verstappen. It is pretty clear and the drivers have agreed to the rules.', '> I simply don‚Äôt agree with it and it think it makes the racing product dull.\n\nSo you find races with only DRS passes more exciting?', 'Don‚Äôt worry guys, OP doesn‚Äôt like how the rules work and is getting to the bottom of this.', ""The main issue was that Hamilton was caught off guard with the attempt, which didn't allow him to change his approach to the corner. He could have gone defensive and fully blocked the inside line at the cost of some lap time. He could have anticipated the dive with a wide line and more speed into the corner, taking the advantage in the next corner. As he didn't see the overtake coming, he took the normal racing line, but was already overtaken on the inside of turn 1. That caused him to be at a disadvantage in the next corner as it was on him to provide space for the leading driver.\n\nUltimately, both drivers lost out in the whole sequence. Hamilton would have lost much less if he let Verstappen pass after cutting t4 and t5."", ""IndyCar doesn't always have clean overtakes though if you've seen an IndyCar race that is not on an oval. There's a lot of argy bargy. As for the contact, that's just racing, Lewis did this far more egregiously in his younger years. No one complained. This is also far more prevalent in lower series like Karting. As the stewards stated if they were being consistent with other results in the past, this shouldn't deserve a pen.\n\n>it implies that as long as the car on the inside is first to apex, they cannot be deemed at fault for any incident\n\nYou'll come to learn that stewarding isn't fully based off the actions itself but the outcome. Remember Lawson and Sainz in Netherlands, the only reason he got a pen and Lewis didn't was because the collision ended with a puncture for both cars. The reason Checo didn't get a pen in Abu Dabi 21 and Lewis didn't in Abu Dabi 2016 for driving unreasonably slowly, Lewis didn't crash into him and Nico didn't crash into Lewis Mitigating circumstances. I wouldn't give a car a 10 second penalty just for a slight correction which lead to contact. Maybe if the slide was bigger, like Russell in Spain then I would give them a 10 second penalty.\n\nAlso in the same document you linked to, it shows the stewards literally take into consideration kerbs and the type of corner.

1ohbs3l,My train of thought after rewatching lap 6,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohbs3l/my_train_of_thought_after_rewatching_lap_6/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"- Lap 6 T1: Max tries to make a move on Lewis, it's hard racing, but it's a fair move. Lewis manages to keep alongside, they will take the battle to T2
- Lap 6 T2: Max, yet to complete the move on Lewis, goes wide and completes the move off track, cutting T3 in the process. Lewis stays within the track and lines up a move for T4.
- Lap 6 T4: Lewis tries to make the move around the outside on Max, goes off and completes the move off track. He then rejoins and doesn't give back the position.

Logical outcome in my opinion: both drivers get a 10 second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage.

Actual outcome: only Lewis gets a penalty...

Am I missing something or is this just bad stewarding?","['https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/Yn4g0c4q4B', ""Read the decision documents.\n\nThey say that, under the current rules, since Max is clearly (their word) ahead at the apex (i.e. having their front axle ahead of the other car's mirrors while overtaking on the inside), then Lewis should have yielded the corner. It was a legal overtake. The reason you say that the overtake wasn't completed, is because Lewis, incorrectly, failed to yield. Under the rules, it was completed. \n\nSo at the next corner, Lewis is attempting an overtake and pushes Max off track. Had Max not rejoined ahead, then it would have been a penalty for Lewis. Actually this corner might be considered still part of the previous corner, and since Max was ahead at the first apex, he was entitled to this corner as well.\n\nThen Lewis makes a mistake while attempting another overtake on Max. He gains the place and doesn't give it back. It's a clear penalty. Doesn't matter what occurred behind with Russell and Bearman. \n\nUnder the current rules (which I don't think are right by the way), it was correct that Lewis got the penalty and Max didn't get any. \n\nI think this has always been the problem between Lewis and Max going back to 2021. They seem to be driving under different racing rules/guidelines. What Max does is legal under the current rules, while Lewis drives as if it isn't."", ""T2: Max was at the apex first and was entitled to be given enough space. Lewis doesn't give that space, so Verstappen goes offtrack to avoid a crash.\n\nLewis was actually lucky here not to be given another penalty."", ""Lewis went off track in turn one and as such wasn't supposed to be alongside in t2 and pushes max off"", 'In addition to what others have said, that Max was ahead at the apex and therefore entitled to the corner while Lewis was not, another critical difference is that Lewis gained a position by going off track while Max did not (since he immediately lost it to Lewis again on the next corner).\n\nYou obviously are not going to get a penalty for ""leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage"" if you did not gain a lasting advantage. People are saying that Max didn\'t give the place back, but you cannot give a place back that you don\'t have. And while the rules are sometimes poorly written, they aren\'t so poorly written that they require drivers to do logically impossible things.\n\nIt really feels like people just understand the rules poorly and think that any gaining of a position while off track immediately yields a penalty, regardless of what happens after. That is not the case, and has never been the case. Drivers are always given a while (not sure if there\'s an exact time limit, but it\'s at least a lap or so) to give a place back. You often see drivers refusing to give a place back until their team tells them they should. That too is normal and allowed.', 'Hamilton move in T2 was illegal, as he was outside of the track.
