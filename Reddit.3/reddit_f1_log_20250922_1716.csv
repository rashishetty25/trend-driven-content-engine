1nnd5l6,"A Discussion about Team Principal background, and subsequent team success.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nnd5l6/a_discussion_about_team_principal_background_and/,2025-09-22, Discussion,"This past weekend at Baku was quite fun to watch for a lot of reasons, but the sudden and vivid resurgence of Red Bull was a flash point for me, and really got me thinking about what a fast and wild turnaround RBR has had since Laurent Mekies took over. 

That got me thinking about Principals, and teams, and wholesale performance depending on who is in charge, which led me to this wild post, which I would love for you to read, and subsequently discuss. 

An article shared a few days ago by u/enesracing about how Mekies is improving RBR's performance has, so far, proven true with this weekend's race. This was Yuki's best race so far with RBR, and Max had a classic race where he torched the competition all weekend. Arguably, it's because McLaren was weak here, but there were simply ""other things"" that seemed to go right all weekend, and things went well last weekend as well. The timing of pit stops, the tire strategy, the way the cars were set up, it all seems to be dialed in in a way that it hasn't in a long time for RBR. I am mostly convinced it's because Mekies has an engineering background and has \[probably\] been very pragmatic about his approach to the car. Horner was a driver. Always seemed like a ""feels"" guy who was comfortable stirring the pot--positively and negatively--to get results. And results were indeed had under Horner, for a long time, but the recent burnout has been unreal, and that cursed second RBR seat is, I'm convinced, partly his doing. Not sure how, but they are the only team on the grid with such an insane divergence in pace. 

More fuel: Mekies was/is also responsible for Racing Bulls and Alpha Tauri's marked success and consistency, and with him at the helm RBR will finish the season strong. Tost, a racing driver, however, got the B-side RBR team there while dealing with Horner, and they--and arguably RBR as well during the Renault era--burned hot and also super cold as Toro Rosso and Alpha Tauri with racing drivers at the helms of both teams. There is also some ""B-Team to save face"" shenanigans happening in the background with the RB team, of course, so maybe they aren't the greatest case study. 

Anyhow, in a nutshell, sort of based on RBR's recent drama, here's my theory:

engineer -> principal -> consistency, good or bad, long term...

and/or 

racing driver -> principal -> huge swings in success and failure...

or maybe no correlation at all? 

So, as soon as I thought about it, it immediately got my wheels turning about other teams, and it turned into an interesting thought exercise. 

I'm not going to go into \*every\* principal of every team, obviously, because that would take all year. But, I do want to deep dive into some of the teams and their principals to see if I'm just taking crazy pills, or if there's something to my theory. 

I'm going to keep things fairly modern, because that's when a lot of folks got into the sport. I am also going to attempt to do a fairly diverse sample size, and take a gander at some of the more interesting teams of the past decade.

Here we go:

\-Ferrari. Oh, Ferrari. The ostensive clown parade at Ferrari seems to be unaffected by Fred. Fred is an engineer. Which, it seems, is unfortunate for the Tifosi, and poor Charles and Lewis (and Kimi, and Seb, and Carlos). Ferrari hiring lots of engineers to head the team has done them no good. Let's be real, they, as a team, show flashes of brilliance, but the team has kind of have been in the same situation since Binotto. Beautiful cars with no teeth that destroy rear tires, and a hilariously backwards pitwall strategy for the entire weekend. Ironically and crazily, Arrivabene was the flash point for them in recent times, and he is a marketing and sales guy (which is still shocking to me, and always has been). They had moderate success, but truly chaotic moments, with him at the helm. Maybe they need a big swing at a driver to spice things up? Ferrari has obviously been around for 10,000 years, so there is a metric shitton of history I am just passing by, but I would be curious to chop it up with a Ferrari lore expert about my theory in regards to earlier Ferrari eras (Schumacher era, maybe?)

\-Alpine is interesting. Moderate success with Otmar, who is an electrical engineer, and also a marketing guy. Oakes, a driver, who fizzled out incredibly fast but also gave Alpine some success (podiums, points, decent finishes). He was set up by Famin, an engineer. So, Success and stability=Engineer....kind of...in Alpine's case, but \*wins\* with the driver at the helm, which led to absolute bedlam. And now with wacky ole Insurance Salesman/Restaurant manager/""Lifetime Ban"" enthusiast Flavio at the helm, you literally never know what you're going to get. If anything, Alpine proves my theory in spades in that they are wildly swing-y in how they perform, and their success has sort of followed the principals. 

Side note: Otmar drove Force India, Racing Point, and Aston Martin to perfect mediocrity. Silverstone is still mediocre, with more engineers at the helm. Let's be real, they (silverstone team Spyker/Force India/Racing Point/Jordan/Midland) had their best success with Eddie, way back when, and Eddie is a lot of things, but he is a racing driver first. Sooooo, racing driver principal=peaky success? 

  
\-Mercedes. The dominant force of F1 for almost a decade. Inseparable from Toto Wolff. Toto is a classic racing driver, and their incredible run has lasted an unusually long time with him at the helm, but they have arguably cracked now. Definitely a third or fourth place team at best. Yes, they won 8 championships in a row. They were unbelievably dominant for \*years\*, but something always felt unhinged behind the scenes at AMG Mercedes to me, and it always seemed to come back to Toto. The ""zero pod"" design was the first huge obvious miss, but I'd argue that the insanity that was Rosberg and Hamilton, letting Lewis run roughshod over Bottas for so, so many races with team orders and the aggressively fake ""yeah, we let them race"" statements was quite unhealthy and it always felt toxic an weird. Not to mention them letting their ""sister team"" Williams run around like a rabbit doused in acid for so long. AMG Mercedes Petronas has always screamed ""we are a well oiled machine that might blow up any minute"". They have sort of blown up now, but boy, it indeed took a minute. If my theory holds true, Toto should step back and hire an engineer. And I wonder, if they do that any time soon, if they will start getting right back up at the top instead of being dirty toilet water.

  
\-Williams is my speculation story. They have been, kind of like Alpine, a dumpster fire for a long time, but James Vowles is proof that a mathematician is probably the way to go towards righting a ship. I would also argue that he is smart enough to know that he should step aside if things get stale. Right now they are on a rocket trajectory back towards success, and you love to see it, but they are also dangerously close to mathing it all out too much, getting buried in numbers, and getting stuck in 3rd or 4th place. I'm calling it: they will have huge success if Vowles gets the boat going in the right direction, goes into a more managerial role, and hires some retired hothead racing driver to get them going. Alonso, for example, at Williams after he retires will send them \*straight\* to the top. And then, of course, they will come crashing down in spectacular dramatic fashion. Williams Dominance could be boring, but could absolutely happen. 

My final point is \[RECENT\*\] McLaren, and honestly, they are the case study that kind of proves my point, and I'm glad to argue it. I'll start off with Ron F'n Dennis, who, for so long, held that organization by the balls. And, definitely since 2014 (but arguably since \~2006), McLaren have essentially chased their tails around. Cue McLaren fan hate mail. Ron is, of course, a businessman, but started off as a gearhead mechanic. So, I'd argue for the sake of my wacky theory, more of an engineer. And he was in charge of the highest of highs in the late 90's and early 2000's but also spygate, etc. So, net, in the modern era, McLaren (Like the other old ass team, Ferrari) have been Consistent. Not always great, but consistently upper mid table. And Besides Ron, yes, Whitmarsh was ""technically"" principal for a lot of time (Wiki says since 2009), but was he? We all know Ron still ran the show until at least 2017. And then, boom, modern day, post 2017, post Ron, we get Seidl, who is an engineer, and continues the course of consistency, but arguably drives the ship in the wrong direction because of a lack of spark. AND NOW, finally, we're at Zak and Stella, who, I would argue, co-run things. Zak is a hothead, racer, American, talks shit, swings big. Stella is literally a doctor of engineering. I'm convinced \*they\* are why McLaren are so strong right now--it's the best of both worlds. I believe I even have heard Zak talking about it, and the whole Papaya Rules nonsense feeds into it. They are embracing the incestuous relationship of racing driver AND engineer, and succeeding big time because of it. Take notes, other teams! I don't care for McLaren at all, but I am wildly interested in their newfound glory, in part for this reason. 

  
Conclusion: I think I'm on to something. Engineers seem to be more consistent long term, and have a better history of ""righting a ship"", but also not making things better. Racing drivers, however, do seem to be a wild card, and seem to really get things fired up and win silverware pretty regularly, but also have a high record of burning out and crashing hard. Right? 

Anyhow, Thanks for reading, if you did! I'd love to see if anyone else is ""Charlie Day Pepe Silvia"" about this like I am, so we can chat about it.
