1i78lvs,"Starting today, we are banning Twitter/X content on r/formula1. We urge all journalists, creators, photographers and other F1 personalities to also make their content available on alternative platforms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i78lvs/starting_today_we_are_banning_twitterx_content_on/,2025-01-22, Meta,"**TL;DR:** For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter, with the intention to make this ban permanent in some form.

Hey everyone!

After [yesterday’s proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6lm2v/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/) we discussed within the mod team whether a full ban on Twitter content would be feasible. We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers & FOM have not. But we also realize that it’s a *chicken or the egg problem* and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a non-trivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news

In the end we’ve settled on the following approach:

* For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter with the only exception of screenshots of relevant posts by teams, drivers & F1 that are **not available on any other platform**. Even in case of major breaking news, we ask you to post links to the press releases or a screenshot of the post from Instagram, with a link in the comments.
* We hope that this trial period will provide a nudge for F1 journalists, creators and teams to make their content available on alternative platforms as **we intend to make this ban permanent in some form.**

Why a trial period? First of all, sometimes mods make bad decisions even if with the best intentions. (For example in 2015 this subreddit banned images & gifs, which caused a controversy that was only resolved after [Will Buxton stepped in to mediate the situation](https://redd.it/3jmslx).) Second of all, this is one of the strictest approaches to Twitter content and strict bans like this can have unintended consequences, so we might need to later refine this ban. We intend the trial period to last at least until the first races of the new season, after which a final form of the ban would be implemented.

This subreddit has had restrictions on what content can be posted for a very long time. We’ve had the source rating system that labeled the quality of news sites and is still used for removing sensationalist and unoriginal articles. We’ve also had limitations on Instagram due to its requirement for an account to view posts. There’s no doubt that over the past years Twitter has become a low-quality source: the login requirements, the flood of bots, the prioritization of content from paying users and promotion of sensationalist content. But unlike with news sites in our source-rating system, for Twitter there wasn’t really an alternative. But now that viable alternatives are emerging and the proposal thread from yesterday has shown that the community prefers those alternatives, **we think it’s time to try and see how the subreddit works without content from Twitter.**

# For journalists, photographers, creators & other F1 personalities

Our preferred alternative platform is Bluesky and to help avoid impersonations we have created a [list of verified F1 related accounts on Bluesky](https://go.bsky.app/57f6geP). This list is used both for feeds & starter packs on Bluesky, but also for AutoModerator here on Reddit. We are adding new verified accounts whenever we come across them, but please contact us on Bluesky or send a modmail here on Reddit to accelerate this process. We want to assist with this transition and we also want to hear your feedback throughout this trial period, so please get in touch.","['https://preview.redd.it/ffwlldom9jee1.jpeg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e7761f171e9f5d7430bb27593eb3c53408674db\n\nI see F1twt is reacting to this in a so normal way. 😭', ""Twitter was such a low bar for quality news anyway.

1i7ndan,"Old heads and frogman’s of the sport, what is Sulayem’s major malfunction?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i7ndan/old_heads_and_frogmans_of_the_sport_what_is/,2025-01-22, Discussion,"This guy sualyem has a different guffaw or scandal every week  and this newest one, regarding serious championship consequences for swearing such as points deductions and even race bans, just seems so utterly ridiculous to me that I find myself thinking back to when a different FIA head was in charge and seemed to have a similar reign of terror on racing at the tail end of last century.

Now, I’m American, and my familial roots as a sports fan is basketball. I know in the league they curse all the time and in many very creative ways over everything under the sun. On the court, in the interviews, in the press conferences, whenever, wherever. Hardly, ever does it become an issue to any real degree greater than a fine, it gets bleeped out, we all move on and keep enjoying the sport. 

Basketball is one of the biggest sports in the world, so this fascination with stamping out what has never been a problem either in Motorsports, really only happening with any frequency with specific people and often when things are going wrong and the excitement for a particular race can reach its highest peaks.

So I’m left to wonder, what gives? Most drivers across all FIA regulated sports are reasonably well behaved. Sponsors and Fans are flocking to top level racing unlike anything seen in years. Things are incredibly bright. So why is an issue being made out of thin air? Worse, Sulayem seems to be particularly waging this war with F1 rather than other disciplines. So what’s the issue? Did Briatore do something when he crashed that Renault back in the day?","['Power tripping on a country size massive scale.\n\nThat’s pretty much it. The messed up part about it is that he’s actually getting away with doing insane things.', 'He thinks that as president of the FIA, he should be listened to on all matters and there should be absolute deference to him. He has an enormous ego, and this is part of it.\n\nWhen there isn’t, he lacks the maturity to take it on the chin, and instead he lashes out. So he’s binned off the audit and ethics committees at the FIA, because how dare they question him. He’s decided the british media are a unique enemy because they publicly document his failings. He’s decided the drivers are trying to make trouble and they need to be penalised into behaving.\n\nHe then lacks the insight to understand that this just makes people dislike him more, and therefore he’s critiqued more, and he lashes out more to the point that any valid point he has is lost. It exposes his ego fully.\n\nBernie, and Moseley, and Todt all had the ability to take it on the chin and say ‘if you don’t like me, whatever’ which stops that cycle progressing.', 'The Briatore shot lmao. Also, I would say that this is becoming an issue for a lot of sports taking in new and more unprecedented amounts of revenue over the last few years. Thinking of the NFL celebration over-penalization. It’s all about this sort of clean image instead of whatever raw energy the sport gives off which is usually more fun. Like when Seb said back in the day “what the f*** are we doing here? What a stupid action. I’m going home.”\n\nThe fact that I can basically recite that from memory shows how entertaining it was, but now it’s like they want the sport to make money while the players/drivers/people inside of it don’t make a sound. I think the point they are missing is that the greater overall narrative of the sport is their moneymaker and that requires personality, like Lewis today. His post in Maranello was the most liked post in the history of F1, and in a sport that is leaning heavily into social media, you think you would allow them to cultivate that personality in any direction. Some rules are good (no hate speech) but shutting down personality is just sad.', ""It's getting more and more bizarre. Even if this is just a symbolic act, the FIA could theoretically apply these rules at any time. But as soon as they would ban a driver for a month and deduct championship points for shit like swearing or an unauthorized personal statement, they would seriously interfere with the integrity of the sport and also with potentially millions of dollars in prize money for a team. at that point even the team bosses would probably start a riot."", ""My take is he's a blowhard fancy boy who finds himself a notch above his level of incompetence. Plus, he's a bounding buffoon."", 'It’s just a feeble attempt by a fragile ego to stay relevant.', ""Fascist.

In GTD Pro, the class where GT3 road based cars are piloted by top rated professional Platinum and Gold drivers, we see 15 entries (cars) featuring 9 different road based chassis from nine different familiar manufacturers - sure to be an exciting and competitive class.
