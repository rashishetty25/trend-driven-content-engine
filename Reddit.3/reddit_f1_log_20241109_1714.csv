1gnczad,[RacingNews365.nl] Wolff again lashes out at Masi over Verstappen's controversial world title,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnczad/racingnews365nl_wolff_again_lashes_out_at_masi/,2024-11-09, News,,"['whoever share rn365 news rn is a fucking bot honestly', ""I mean he's not wrong but why are we still talking about it?"", 'Interviewer : How often does Wolff think back to that day?\n\n> ""There\'s definitely a moment every week that I think about it. But I mainly think about it because I think Lewis deserved to be the greatest of all time with eight world championship titles. You can keep arguing about that year, but I think Max and Lewis were both deserving champions,"" Wolff said on the High Performance Podcast .\n\n> ""There were times during that year when Max lost points that he shouldn\'t have lost. You look at Silverstone and the crash at Monza that the two of them had. They were both deserving champions on that particular afternoon in Abu Dhabi, but it was unfair.""\n\n> Wolff continues his story about the then race director, Michael Masi. ""I was angry, not even depressed or sad, just angry. One individual, by making a bad decision, was able to take an eighth championship away from the best driver in the world. Now you have to put that into context. There are dictators and crazy politicians all over the world who cause so much pain and so much damage. That is in no way comparable to Lewis losing his eighth title.""\n\n> ""It was just the anger at that moment towards one person and that was emotionally draining. Even Lewis needed a few days to get back to normal. It\'s still with us, given the unfairness of that day. But it\'s not like it\'s on our minds all the time and that it bothers us.""\n\n> Then Wolff elaborates on Masi. ""I really tried to talk to Michael and guide him throughout the year. I said to him: \'Listen, I\'ve been in the sport for a long time. Listen to the drivers. Don\'t be stubborn in making decisions and don\'t be arrogant\'. I tried to do that for the good of the sport and of course for us as a team. That way we wouldn\'t be vulnerable in situations that could be very bad. But in that sense it\'s just unforgivable what happened.""\n\n> The Austrian continued: ""I realise how he feels and I know that it\'s not good. It\'s bad. But he could have thought about it all year and some people, not just me, tried to support him in the right way. Sometimes you just have to realise that someone is just doing their own thing or making their own decision. So I don\'t care anymore. We\'re talking about it now, but we\'re actually wasting our time now. It\'s not relevant anymore.""', ""NGL, that whole situation still pisses me off when someone mentions it, but it's happened... it's history now. Focusing on it constantly isn't healthy at all. \n\nToto needs to just stop talking about it when asked in interviews."", '🥱', ""Ultimately Lewis lost it throughout the rest of the season, it never should have come down to AD, it only did because of Silverstone and Hungary.\n\nPlenty of other examples where Lewis and Max gained or lost due to race director decisions, it's silly to pretend AD was the only race in the entire season, had Lewis not messed up his brake magic in Baku he'd have won as well and that was for 25 points and not 7.\n\nIt's so easy to point fingers at Masi for losing you points instead of taking responsibility for their own mistakes that lost them even more."", 'Toto should evaluate his own position as he has presided over three years of abject mediocrity with 0 steps forward made in that time. Ferarri have inched forward whilst McLaren have flown past.', 'Have we gone back in time?', '> ""I really tried to talk to Michael and guide him throughout the year.
