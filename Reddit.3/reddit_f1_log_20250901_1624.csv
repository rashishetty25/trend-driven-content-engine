I'm unfamiliar with it"", 'Fantastic interview, and well worth the read.  \n\nThere\'s a kid, handed a box of parts that was once a race car, jigsawing them back together, collecting fabricating skills to do it..  \n\n>I’ve been tremendously fortunate in my career to work with John Barnard, Adrian Newey, Ross Brawn, Pat Symonds, Rory Byrne. I feel awful for leaving anyone out because there’ve been so many. I’ve worked with Flavio Briatore to Christian Horner; I’ve seen both ends of the spectrum. And of course, you learn from all of those experiences and those people.\n\nThat quote speaks a lot.

And what F1 taught me more than anything was the power of a team—and I loved that. At Benetton, when we were fighting for a championship, everyone was looking for the last scrap of performance. I can’t tell you the energy that it gives you, and it keeps you young, so I made the decision to go into a management career. I’ve never looked back, frankly.\n\n>I love the incredible creativity, the work that the engineering geniuses like Mattia Binotto can create with the right tools. But more than that, I’ve loved managing people, building teams, guiding people in their career paths, seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee. I love all of that, and I love building teams, so it’s just a bigger team to put together as team principal than it was as a sporting director or mechanic.\n\n\nIt\'s the ""seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee.

He kept key people in the same positions to maintain the status quo, to impress the board.   \n\nA lot of Toto fans will hate to read this, but Toto bought his way into the sport with Williams.  Lucked into a Merc role after Ross Brawn had to fall on the sword after the illegal tyre test.    In business, it would be called a ""hostile takeover"" by Toto.  No way the board got rid of Ross Brawn if someone wasn\'t earworming them behind the scenes.

Create different position names, where it\'s like a promotion to a new role etc.  Reward people and promote.   Stella for example.  Leaves Ferrari with Alonso, as he knows the Ferrari culture of modern times.   Works his way up from Race Engineer to TP.  \n\nRob Smedley should have been given Ferrari TP a long long time ago.  Long-term F1 key person, and he just left the sport because of that ceiling.\n\nOld school mentality, like Ron in McLaren, having Whitmarsh as the trainee to the crown.  Seasons pass, person still holds on, thinking ... the day will come... and then the day comes, and it\'s too late.  It\'s old school Independent Team mentality.  \n\nHorner shouled have stepped aside, given himself a new role description like Zak, and elevated Wheatley to TP.\n\nMuch like Toto showed that he wasn\'t a natural leader, trying to keep the status quo, rather than reward people to stop them from leaving.', ""Horner's reputation could be a factor but it is also a natural situation that people who have been in their position for quite a long time look for something new.

This sort of crap has happened all season. May I remind people that it was *the inciting factor* in drama in even Saudi Arabia - the idea that the inside car is just allowed priority to run the outside car wherever they want, even when it goes against anything intuitive about racing - it's just been getting pushed further and further until it's finally hit a logical extreme that exposes how it never made sense. The rules about corner ownership needed to be destroyed a long time ago."", 'The penalty is fair for the rules as written, it’s just most fans don’t like the rules.\n\nThe interesting part for me is that this version of the rules are a modification of last year’s based on feedback from the drivers, who felt that the previous version was too harsh and restrictive to the driver on the inside of the corner.\n\nJust shows how difficult it is to create a set of rules that is both consistent and as fair as possible in as many different situations as possible.', ""If the roles were reversed, this wouldn't even been half as controversial\n\nThe rules whether you like or not are clear and these drivers have agreed to them"", 'The ""ahead at the apex"" rule is so idiotic. Imagine if Gilles Villeneuve and René Arnoux had had to yield at every apex where they weren\'t ahead. We wouldn\'t have had the most iconic racing battle in history.', 'Sainz is trying to go outside and he’s not even at the rear wheel. That is not ‘alongside’.\xa0\n\nThe rules are very clear.\xa0', 'The person who made this video has no leg to stand on because the rules are absolutely clear on where responsibility lies.', ""Sometimes things are just a racing incident and don't need a penalty either"", 'I do wonder what the opinions would have been if the roles were reversed. Lawson on the outside, Sainz on the inside.', ""Man, I feel like I'm missing something with all the comments saying the decision is fair given the racing rules. I get that Sainz isn't entitled to space when trying to go around the outside, but he responds to Lawson's defensive line and only ends up hitting him because of the snap Lawson has. Sainz is not owed anything, but why penalize him? Do the overtaking rules say nobody is allowed to exist on the outside of a corner?\n\nI know I'm a Sainz fan, I'm biased, but genuinely, don't get it. Do the rules obligate that he be given a penalty because contact happened while they were in the corner and Sainz is the driver on the outside? I thought the rules are there to define right-of-way, not prohibit being close to someone while on the outside. I don't remember other rulings where someone was penalized in this way because of the overtaking rules, only instances where the inside driver was considered not at fault for squeezing resulting in contact. Granted I'm forgetful."", ""This is a good example of why the rules should allow reviews on a case by case basis. No two incidents are exactly the same even if they look the same from the outside.\n\nOne time the driver on the inside can completely miss the turn and cause a collision, another time the driver on ghe outside can be at fault.\n\nYou can't judge every incident the same way because then you get shit like this.""]",24,121,0.54,24,112,112,7,10,0.0,7

These rules of engagement are not conducive for actual racing. A driver can simply be ahead at the apex, know they have right of way, meaning they can just drive to the outside of the corner knowing they cannot be challenged, or if an accident occurs knowing they will not be at fault.

We need cars to go side by side to overtake, it’s just a fact. If a car can hold the outside line, for almost the entire corner, and be almost in line or at least half way up to the car alongside it, the inside driver should be required to leave one cars width in the exit. 

The current rules allow two cars in to a corner, but only one to come out. If two go in, two should come out. We are losing classic battles and excitement in the sport. 

Would really love to see something changed. Rant over!","[""The problem is trying to have a one size fits all rule.

Just because you know it will be deemed the other drivers fault doesn’t mean there is no consequences for making contact.  That incident ended Lawson’s race just as much as it ended Carlos’s.

	•	any small details you wish you knew earlier that made watching races more fun?
	•	stuff that’s not really “official” but more like insider knowledge or fan culture?
