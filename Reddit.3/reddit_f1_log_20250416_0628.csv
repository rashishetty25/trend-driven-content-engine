Don\'t think it has anything to do with bias, but there are some very weird decisions happening with the tv-direction. \n\n\\- They finale are using a mini-box, but aren\'t utilizing it nearly enough or correctly. (And did they stop showing the ""live minibox"" during replays? Why?)  \n\\- They should stop switching to onboards during overtakes, it\'s incredibly annoying. (Use onboards for replays)   \n\\- The timing of replays is so bad, that with races like last weekend we are seeing more actions happening on replays than live.   \n\\- They switch away during an overtake/action, this has happened multiple times every weekend now, with the last examples being Hamilton overtaking Norris, Sainz/Antonelli, etc.   \n\\- Qualifying is incredible close and exciting, but they keep missing A LOT of drivers finishing their lap. If there\'s many drivers that are competitive, we really should not focus on 1 entire lap of a driver. \n\nI know it\'s an incredible hard job, and they also have some very good direction sometimes, but these are some very consistent annoyances that I think a lot of people share.
