1mk12l0,People who's favourite driver retired/lost his seat did you stopped watching it or started supporting someone else or just what happened ?

So I'm gonna tell my friends experience to give some more context.  A friend of mine is a very big Seb fan and while Seb was still racing if he had a free time he used to watch every practice session spending some time in F1 related communities in social media etc. He was die-hard fan. 

Anyways when he retired my friend was obviously sad, also he gradually quit F1 like first he just started to watch Quali and Race also stopped spending time in f1 communities afterwards he only started to watch races and nowadays he usually just looks up to race results and watches some races if they're promising to be exciting (Silverstone this year for example)

I used to follow F1 since the early 2000s (as in read about it and watch some highlights on TV), and started watching some races around 2008-09 I think. Then Checo joined F1 in 2011 and that made me incredibly excited, so I started following it much more and watching qualys and races more often (sometimes it was too early in Mexico so after a night out I missed those). A turning point was Liberty Media taking over and making it much, much easier to watch F1, so by that point I very rarely missed a race. Checo then joined Red Bull and of course the excitement went through the roof. The last two years were rough though, I didn't want to watch the qualy anymore and just focus on the races, as it was honestly very hard to ignore his downfall.
