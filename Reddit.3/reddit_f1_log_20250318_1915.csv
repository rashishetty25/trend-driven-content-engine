Ferrari need to change their approach because all they seem to care about is race position, rather than what track conditions are like. This goes for the drivers too because in such situations, the drivers are the ones battling the conditions and can tell what they can handle or not. 

They need to be more firm just as Russell and Verstappen were about what needed to happen, else they won't ever change cause it's been happening for years. I'm surprised Hamilton wasn't more decisive but I suppose new team new relationship so he was still learning how the atmosphere would be like.

Bono took charge with Kimi and was understandably so. Same with Stoll, his engineer mostly made the calls and he never seemed like the type to care that much. Hulk put his experience hat on.

As for Norris and McLaren, they clearly learned from previous situations because both Lando and Will could tell that the type of rain that fell, will obviously not dry for the remainder of the race.

1jdoj2c,How much practice do new driver-engineer pairings really get?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jdoj2c/how_much_practice_do_new_driverengineer_pairings/,2025-03-17, Discussion,"I believe both Seb and Carlos generally spoke well of Adami (despite some of the selected team radios we heard from Carlos), but Lewis just came from a dozen years with Bono, so I imagine lack of familiarity is a huge factor here.

I don‚Äôt know what the exact procedures are inside an F1 team, but it *felt* like Hamilton and Adami were running a full race together for the first time.

I would have assumed they‚Äôd go through several simulated races with various scenarios‚Äîletting the race progress, reacting to changes, making all the calls they normally would‚Äîbefore the season starts.

Maybe they *do* this, and my impression from the live race radios is off, but it didn‚Äôt *sound* like they had much practice together.

I can see how he would work well with Stroll. \n\nI'm usually on Lando's, Max's, and Oscar's radios every race, and I decided to hop on other onboards after the last race. The communication styles are so different, and you can tell who have an understanding already and who don't. You can also kind of tell who has higher expectations of their pit wall/strategy team. \n\nAlso, just because there's an understanding or personal relationship already doesn't mean that things go perfectly. This wasn't broadcasted but Max was mildly unhappy that the team didn't pit him for inters a lap before they did. I'm sure he would have been more unhappy if he hadn't been in P2 by then already. \n\nI think both Max and Lando have personal relationships with their engineers, but the trust levels about the teams' strategies in the rain may be different. Max didn't ask a lot of questions about the incoming rain. I'm not sure if he even asked any. Lando, on the other hand, asked for every detail, made his preferred strategy clear, and even reiterated it again. (I'm willing to consider that this was perhaps a trauma response though, given how often McLaren has messed up his strategy in the rain. üòÖ)\n\nRussell's engineer serves as a good contrast to Lewis's. George was told how many positions he would lose beforehand while Lewis had to ask after the fact. In fact, I feel like that was Ferrari's main issue.

Where Max is great in wet races, Lando is great at wet qualifying. The F1 youtube video shows how he takes unique lines and takes crazy amounts of kerb but somehow gains time while others avoid the kerb. Memorable moments are China last year where he qualified over a second faster than Lewis in second. Also Spa 2021 where he was dominating that qualifying session. In that race George even noticed Lando takes a very sharp line in turn 1 and he tried the same, getting a purple first sector and qualifying 2nd in a Williams.\n\nObviously there are other drivers good in the wet, for Lewis you could find lots of examples. It\'s just these 2 are very fast and consistent in their wet ability.', 'On the flip side, I\'m not sure that there\'s a known ""bad"" in the wets driver in F1 right now, other than the rookies who just don\'t have experience handling it.', 'Generally the British tend to do well, as do other drivers from similar climates. Practice makes perfect.\n\nAnother indicator is a driver who likes the rear of the car a bit loose', ""The tough thing is that they're all pretty good in the wet. I think if you picked a driver at random (outside the rookies) they've all likely had good wet performances and bad wet performances.\n\nIf I had to pick a few drivers probably Max, Hamilton, Alonso, Hulkenberg and Norris.""]",0,150,0.48,0,1215,1215,0,2,0.0,0
1je06er,What season had the strongest grid?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1je06er/what_season_had_the_strongest_grid/,2025-03-18, Discussion,"As the question asks, which sesson do you think had the strongest grid?

Personally in my opinion the current grid is the best it has ever been in terms of talent but I'd definitely be open to the idea of being corrected.

You have absolute top tier talents in Verstappen, Leclerc, Hamilton, Russell, Norris, Piastri, Alonso, Sainz etc..the level below them as well is still extremely strong.

I don't recall an era where we had such a strong driver lineup.","['I‚Äôd say 2012 was a pretty amazing grid too. Vettel, Alonso, Raikkonen, Hamilton, Button, Webber, Massa, Rosberg. \n\nWith Perez, Hulkenberg, Grosjean, Ricciardo and Maldonado too. I‚Äôm probably missing some drivers, but these are the drivers that I could think of from memory.\n\nIt was a pretty talented grid.', 'I love the 2025 grid, but 1991 was not too bad either: Senna, Prost, Mansell, Piquet, Schumacher, Berger, Alesi and H√§kkinen', 'Until about fifteen years ago, there were huge differrnces between the backmarkers and the frontrunners. F1 today would not let anybody enter privately for a single race and something like the Andrea Moda desaster would just not happen.\n\n\nComparisons are hard because of this professionalization.\xa0', 'We had a grid with multiple WDCs : Rosberg, Button, Schumacher, Alonso, Kimi, Hamilton, Vettel', 'Feel Iike your answers have to be either 1991, 2012, or 2024', 'I have a [model](https://f1mathematicalmodel.com/) to rate drivers, and to assess grid quality, I take the average of the top 4 drivers in a season and the average of the ""middle"" (9th-12th). There are 6 seasons that score exceptionally high in the middle. These are in order:\n\n2024  \n1976  \n2022  \n1979  \n2023  \n1978\n\nThere are 5 seasons that score exceptionally well at the top end. These are in order:\n\n2024  \n1976  \n2023  \n2022  \n2021\n\nTo answer the original question, it\'s definitely 2024, or broader, the current grid, but the late 70s (especially 1976) are right there with it. Of course, the worst drivers on the current grids are much better than any worst drivers have ever been, so that\'s another point for today.\n\nOther people have mentioned 1991 and 2012, and they\'re definitely strong grids but not the best. Apart from the seasons I already mentioned, 2018, 2016, and 2009 would also be considered stronger grids than 1991 and 2012, according to the model.', ""I'm partly nostalgic but there's a strong case for the 1991 season. Prost, Senna, Mansell, Piquet, H√§kkinen, and Schumacher all won championships before, during, or after. Many other drivers on the grid in that season won races and had stable careers.\nOf course the number of seats was higher so it's partly to do with just a large crop of drivers and teams, and there's the benefit of all those careers having played out now fully, whereas we don't know where Hadjar or others might be in three years."", '1991\n\n***Ayrton Senna | Alain Prost | Nelson Piquet |*** *Nigel Mansell* *| Riccardo Patrese | Jean Alesi | Gerhard Berger | Roberto Moreno | Michael Schumacher | Andrea de Cesaris | Stefano Moden | Satoru Nakajima | Thierry Boutsen | Mark Blundell | Emanuele Pirro | Martin Brundle | Mika H√§kkinen | Bertrand Gachot | Johnny Herbert | Erik Comas | JJ Lehto | Pierluigi Martini | Gianni Morbidelli | Nicola Larini | Alex Caffi | Olivier Grouillard |  Mauricio Gugelmin | Ivan Capelli | Eric van de Poel | Gabriele Tarquini. | Aguri Suzuki | Karl Wendlinger*', 'Many of the grids people are naming from the past are very top heavy.

In the 2002 system, that's a great deal, even if it's only a small chance of getting into the points, because that 8th place is worthless. So a lot of those drivers end up somewhere around 18th or worse because they took the gamble that could have maybe got them 5th.
