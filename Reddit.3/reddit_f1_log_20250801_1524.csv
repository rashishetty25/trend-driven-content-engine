It’s a different package option to cater for driver preference on feedback through the steering wheel, which can result in changes to tyre deg patterns (however minimal). Lando prefers one option, Oscar prefers the other. McLaren can run both without having to compromise other areas of car development that are actual performance upgrades.

1mek52g,Hungarian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mek52g/hungarian_grand_prix/,2025-08-01, News,"Weather forecast for the weekend. This event in 2006 saw Button get his first F1 race win. 


The Hungarian Grand Prix in 2006 marked the last occasion the event was held in wet conditions. The track was already wet at the beginning of the race, making it a historic first for a wet Hungarian Grand Prix. 
All competitors started on intermediate tires, except for Barrichello, who opted for full wets. 

Early on, polesitter Kimi Räikkönen quickly established his lead. Both Alonso and Schumacher delivered impressive climbs through the field. Schumacher advanced from 11th to 6th by the first corner, while Alonso moved up from 15th with a notably aggressive and hard-fought opening lap. Alonso then engaged in a straight fight with Schumacher for several laps before executing a pass on the outside of Turn 5, securing 3rd place. He further progressed to take the lead after the McLaren drivers, Pedro de la Rosa and Räikkönen, made their pit stops. 

Traditionally, Bridgestone wet-weather tires were dominant in non-dry conditions, but in this race, the Japanese compound appeared to be an exception. All drivers using Bridgestone tires, including those from Ferrari, struggled with significantly reduced pace compared to their rivals. Schumacher found himself battling Giancarlo Fisichella for 5th place, ultimately losing his front wing in a mid-corner incident while fending off snap-oversteer, resulting in a forced pit stop that put him a lap down. Soon after, Jenson Button showcased remarkable overtaking prowess, passing Massa, Fisichella, and Schumacher in under two laps. Räikkönen, facing difficulties on his second set of tires, crashed into the rear of Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso, launching the car and necessitating a safety car period. This incident allowed Alonso to pit, enabling Schumacher to regain the lead lap. 
Another beneficiary of the safety car was Jenson Button, who chose not to pit and climbed to 2nd position behind Alonso. Following the safety car restart, Button challenged Alonso, but eventually had to pit for fuel. Alonso maintained the lead, but a subsequent pit stop for dry tires proved disastrous as his right-rear wheel nut detached, causing him to lose control and crash. 

Button inherited the lead and held it unchallenged for the remainder of the race. Schumacher made his way up to 2nd by remaining on intermediate tires as other drivers made further stops.

It seems that most teams are still loosing ground to McLaren, with the exception of Sauber. Mercedes is hanging there without making much progress. Ferrari was the closest at the beginning of the season, but it's loosing ground as well.

Or is their advantage something that the other teams still don’t know yet and could well be an advantage in 26, especially tyre management. ","[""They built a car that can spend an entire race in dirty air, has better tyre management than everyone else and is good in all weather conditions and unlocks new insane speed in the rain. \n\nIn short, it's voodoo."", 'I think teams have probably figured out what McLaren’s advantage is at this point and how to emulate it to some extent, but given that this is the final year for these regs (and the cost cap) they’re probably opting to focus on 2026 instead', 'Even if it is something McLaren have figured out that the others teams dont is highly unlikely it’ll remain an advantage into the new regs, the cars are changing so much and even a small change can alter the performance massively', 'Didnt McLaren basically get a shiny state of the art wind tunnel around the same time they finished fourth in the constructors (giving them more time) and have been on an upwards swing since \n\nRed Bull also hit a ceiling with the RB19 and have struggled with the RB20 design \n\nI suspect many others are diverting more and more resources now though, Ferrari and Merc are probably close to writing off the year (if not already) to focus on 26', 'I think it’s a mix of different factors. Yes the new regulations in 26 are playing a part, but not to the point where it explains everything.\n\nLast year McLaren won the constructors title by 14 points over Ferrari. Ferrari then came in with a car that, as I recall Fred Vasseur saying, was over 90% different from last year, and now the gap is close to 260 points between the two. Meanwhile Mercedes may have finally gotten a car relatively stable enough to not porpoise the entire race, and Red Bull has made a car that’s quick but outside of Max Verstappen (and sometimes with him) it’s a fight to handle on its good days. The directions the teams took with the concepts are another important key in what’s happened this year.', ""Red Bull was developing their car late into 21 and brought a WCC contending car for 2022. It won't be an issue. Their current advantage is that they have insane tyre management with consistent pace and downforce no matter the track or ride height. From my understanding 2026 will be a little of a reset since we're back to over the car aero with flat floors and a softer suspension since ground effects needed a really stiff and suspension development has been quite limited in this regulation."", 'They are the only team , that since Austria 2023 , every upgrade and every tweak they make , is a boost .That continuous progress indicates that they have understood better than anyone , what they need to do in these cars to make them better . Mercedes is completely lost , when they are bad they do not know why they are bad , when they are good they do not know why they are good , RBR is lost since Newey left , and Ferrari are terribly inconsistent .

A lot of the times, the races are absolutely boring.

Some of them are continue to be as expected less entertaining like Monaco with minimal race action, others like Spa, even with wet conditions, unexpectedly and unfortunately didn't offer much either. 

Which races left on the 2025 calendar, do you now, still have the most expectations from?
