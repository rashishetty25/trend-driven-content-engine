1nbjq85,A reminder that Albon making it to F1 at all was nothing short of a minor miracle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nbjq85/a_reminder_that_albon_making_it_to_f1_at_all_was/,2025-09-08, Discussion,"For me at least, Albon has been the best driver of 2025. More than any other, he's been the one to constantly get the results, even when the car wasn't at its best. But I think it's important to remember that there was a time where Albon making it to F1 at all was incredible.

In case you didn't know, Albon was good in the junior series, but not in a way that indicated that he was an F1 prospect (granted that's mainly down to him not having the budget to race for the biggest teams). For me at least, Albon wasn't even on my radar in any way until the 2016 GP3 series, where he finished runner up to Charles Leclerc, but I never expected him to be in the running for an F1 seat.

F2 in 2018 was a massively competitive and hyped up driver lineup, with Lando Norris and George Russell in particular getting most of the hype, with Nick De Vries being the most hyped up veteran. Alex Albon had very little hype, most likely down to him not even being signed up until the last minute (and even then it was on a race by race basis).

F2 2018 starts off, and Russell and Norris were two of the main title contenders. With them being both rookies and British, Sky F1 hyped them up a lot, but with all that said, Alex Albon never let them disappear. It was always fairly close between Russell, Norris and Albon, yet the former two always had a lot more hype than Albon did.

In fairness to Sky F1, a bunch of their pundits did eventually realise that Albon did deserve to be in the same conversation as Russell and Norris. I remember Martin Brundle tweeting to the effect of *""We hyped up Russell and Norris a lot, but why not Albon? He's right up with them two in the standings, why aren't we talking about him more?""*

Eventually that did indeed happen, and on the F2 broadcast at least, Albon was discussed a lot more, especially by the end of the season. But despite all this, F1 seemed all but impossible for him. So much that he signed up for Formula E for the 2018-19 season.

But fortunately for Alex, all the right dominos fell into place. Ricciardo moved to Renault for 2019, which saw Red Bull promote Gasly into Red Bull. Even then though, Gasly was replaced with Kvyat, and it was obvious that Red Bull wanted to replace Hartley with Ticktum, however Ticktum lost to Schumacher in European F3, which meant he couldn't earn his superlicense for 2019. All of this had to happen in order for Alex Albon to get the 2019 Toro Rosso seat, and even then a bunch of Hartley fans were unhappy at the announcement.

There were still rumblings online about how well Albon would do at Toro Rosso. I remember some predictions placing him dead last for 2019, but seeing him now, in his sixth year in F1, and performing to a better and higher standard than ever, it's amazing to think that there was a time where nobody thought he'd even be close to an F1 seat.","[""Owes a lot of it to Jean-Paul Driot of DAMS who could see the potential and supported him for that 2018 season so they could get him in the Nissan e.dams team.\n\nUnfortunately for JPD, Helmut came calling at testing and he knew it would be pointless to try and stand in Alex's way."", ""Albon just goes to show how fine the margins can be to getting that F1 chance.

I'm a huge fan so this year has been incredibly fun to watch him get the recognition he deserves.\n\nHis F2 season is insane when you account for the fact that he didn't know if he was going to be racing that week until sometimes like the day before the weekend would start. I think he's always been on the radars of F1 teams since karting as I remember a lot of drivers noting how they all knew he was super fast back then. The biggest limiter for him getting through the feeder series was money."", 'George Russell is fully aware of Albon‚Äôs under the radar talent. If you watch his interviews over the years whenever he is asked about Albon George always start off with how talented Alex is.

* The soonest Piastri can clinch is now Mexico, which could happen if he wins every race, and Norris scores no more than 22 points and Verstappen no more than 85 over the next 4 races.
* If Piastri were to win every GP (and score 0 in sprints), and Norris were to come 2nd in every GP and win every sprint, Piastri would fall one point short of clinching in Vegas.
* If the top 3 in Monza finish in the same order (Verstappen 1st, Norris 2nd, Piastri 3rd) in every remaining race (including sprints), then they would finish the championship in their current order, with Piastri winning on 462 points, Norris on 458, and Verstappen on 454.

* Outscore Ferrari by at least 10 points
* Are not outscored by Mercedes by 11 or more points
* Are not outscored by Red Bull by 32 or more points

It is also still possible for McLaren to break the 1000 point mark, but the margins are getting tighter, as their maximum tally is now only 6 points above 1000.

I truly don‚Äôt understand why someone would offer this to their championship rival.

I saw on some other threads that some people were saying it was the team‚Äôs idea and not Lando‚Äôs. I went into Lando‚Äôs POV which sometimes included extra radio messages which didn‚Äôt make it into the main feed but nope, the main feed didn‚Äôt miss any context. It was Lando‚Äôs idea. Here is the transcript:

Team: Lando we will box this lap after the soft tire <more words I don‚Äôt understand>

Lando: do you want to pit the other car first?

Team: yep we‚Äôll do that. We‚Äôll swap it around so stay out

Lando: well only if he doesn‚Äôt undercut otherwise I‚Äôll pit first

Team: There will be no undercut

So the team said ‚Äúbox this lap‚Äù then based on what Lando said they switched to ‚Äústay out‚Äù.

What was Lando trying to do? Did he just not want to risk a SC in the lap between the two stops?","['I think it was a way of not getting fucked over by a safety car if it happened after he pitted', 'It was clearly something Lando thought would benefit him, either 1 lap less on used tyres or to save against a safety car. No way was it for Oscar‚Äôs benefit', 'Is lando\'s "" do you want to pit the other car first"" a suggestion or a question?', 'Lando didnt want to get caught out if a safety car came out after he pitted.  He didn‚Äôt care about oscar getting beaten by leclerc and honestly leclerc wasn‚Äôt a threat.', 'I don‚Äôt buy the story of them being worried about leclerc. Although the McLaren stop for Piastri was incredible, he emerged from the pits still around 4/5 seconds in front. Another lap wouldn‚Äôt bring Charles in front. They also offered the stop to Lando initially anyway. If they were so worried about it they would have told Lando they were pitting Piastri first and explain why. \n\nLando didn‚Äôt mention covering Charles in his radio message. My only guess is he wanted track position and fresher tyres. Lando will want as many cars between him and Oscar as possible to bring that points gap down. When they are so far in front in the teams championship I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt care about making sure they get 3 points over Ferrari if him teammate was to finish 3rd or 4th. \n\nI think McLaren didn‚Äôt want their pit crew to feel like they were influencing the championship. Oscar was reeling Lando in a few laps before they stopped to put himself in a position to capitalise on any errors and that‚Äôs exactly what happened. \n\nIf this championship somehow goes to the wire and it‚Äôs within a 3 point margin I would not want to be McLaren trying to explain this.', 'Either he was worried about a safety car (or hoping for one to challenge for the win) or he was worried about tyre life on the soft and wanted one less lap on them.', ""The only hope they had of a win was a safety car.

This is not an exhaustive list and focusses on some races from a bit further back than the last decade. So if your favourite driver isn't represented or I missed something you think is important feel free to add it down below.

# 1956 Italian Grand Prix

Final race of the season.

Title was between three Ferraris', Fangio, Behra and Collins.

Fangio lead the Championship on 30 points, Collins and Behra tied on 22.

Complicating the matter, each driver only counted their best 5 results.

So Fangio could only increase his points tally if he won (giving an extra 2 points), as he didn't compete in the Indy 500 and already discarded a 4th place finish, his next worst result was a 2nd.

Behra could improve his total by finishing better than 3rd, giving him 2 or 4 points meaning he could not beat Fangio to the title.

Collins could improve his points if he finished the race as he already had discarded 2 DNFs, meaning a win would give him the 8 points that would win the title as Fnagio therefore couldn't win.

Fangio's steering broke, so they asked Collins to give his car up... and he did.

Collins gave up his only hope of winning the title so that Fangio would be guaranteed it, no threat from any other team or driver, a straight battle between the 2 of them.

# 1982 San Marino Grand Prix

Ferrari were having a pretty shocking start to the season but arrived at a hime race at Imola with a quick car.

They were running 1-2 with a decent gap as cars behind retired. Villeneuve ahead of Pironi.

Ferrari issued an order to both cars to slow down to protect the cars and the result.

Villeneuve believed this meant for the drivers also to hold station... Pironi did not.

Pironi passed on the last lap and Villeneuve vowed to never talk to him again in his life, he died 2 weeks later making that statement most likely true.

# 1989 San Marino Grand Prix

Second race of the season where McLaren were clearly the fastest car but hadn't won the first race.

Senna qualified on pole with Prost second.

Pre -race agreement between the drivers (not the team apparently), Whoever lead into turn 1 would stay there and be unchallenged for the race.

From the start Senna got away in the lead comfortably, but a major lap 4 crash bought out the red flags meaning a restart was required and the race would be run to aggregate time.

From the second start Prost got ahead comfortably, but into Tosa on Lap 1 senna overtook to lead the race.

Senna claimed the agreement only applied to the first start, Prost was furious.

# 1998 Australian Grand Prix

Season opener and McLaren were looking very quick and the car to beat, qualifying 1-2.

Pre race agreement was whoever lead into turn 1 would win the race to stop the drivers fighting it out.

Hakkinen lead into turn 1 and lead the race as planned.

However a phantom pit call from the team lead Hakkinen to make an extra unnecesary stop, handing the lead to Coulthard and an easy win.

He slowed down on the last lap letting Hakkinen take the victory. Hakkinen went on to become the team leader and win the championship that season.

# 1998 Belgian Grand Prix

Chaotic wet race, through retirements and decent pace the Jordan team find themselves in a 1-2 with Damon Hill ahead of Ralf Schumacher going for the team's first ever win.

Damon Hill (an experienced Grand Prix winner and World Champion) gets on the radio and suggests the team should protect the result and stop the team mates from fighting.

The Team agreed and ordered the drivers to hold station, denying Ralf Schumacher an opportunity at a maiden victory.

Ralf's brother Michael was furious with the decision and was very outspoken against it.

# 2002 Austrian Grand Prix

A dominant Ferrari team with a dominant Schumacher far ahead in the championship having won 4 of the first 5 races (and a third place) and coming off the back of 2 world titles in the previous 2 seasons.

Ferrari find themselves 1-2 with Barrichello ahead of Schumacher.

Ferrari order Barrichello to let Schumacher through for multiple laps approaching the end of the race, but Barrichello appears to be ignoring them and taking a second ever grand prix win.

Out of the last corner he dramatically slows allowing Schumacher to cross the line ahead, Schumacher clearly embarassed amid the boos on the podium ushers Barrichello to take the top step and collect the trophy (which earned the team a fine for breaking podium protocol).

# 2008 Singapore Grand Prix

Possibly the most infamous team orders controversy.

Renault and Alonso found themselves with an uncompetitive car with season best results of 4th place.

In Singapore Alonso qualified 15th and was expecting another tough race.

Alonso took an unusually early pit stop on lap 12 of the race.

The on lap 14 his team mate crashed heavily bringing out the safety car, which due to rules for that season where drivers couldn't pit, promoted Alonso to the front of the field (once penalties for pitting under Sc were sorted out) which he held for the rest of the race.

A year later Piquet claimed he was ordered by the team to crash in a way that gave them a chance at victory, team boss and engineering director were found guilty and given life time bans from F1 (which were later reduced).

# 2010 German Grand Prix

Coming into the race Alonso in Ferrari is a semi-distant 5th palce in the standings 47 points off the lead.

In the race Ferrari team mates Massa and Alonso found themselves at the front with Massa leading.

Through a couple of pit stop phases the gap yoyo'd with Alonso generally looking slightly quicker but unable to pass Massa who looked to have enough to win.

They had effectively seen off the threat of the cars behind and with Team orders being banned in F1 it loooked as though Massa would take a popular and deserved win.

On lap 48 of the race Massa received a message from his engineer Rob Smedley ""OK, so, Fernando is faster than you. Can you confirm you understood that message?"", on lap 49 Massa was 'mysteriously' slow off the exit of the hairpin losing the lead.

His engineer then apologised over the radio and Massa went on to finish 4 seconds behind his team mate.

# 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Second race of the season with the Red Bull cars looking quick but not having great success in the opening round of the season.

In a mixed condition race Webber ended up ahead of Vettel on a dry track, after spending much of the race in close quarters and things getting increasingly frought Red Bull issued the command ""Multi Map 21"" to both drivers which was a coded message for car 2 (Webber) to stay in front of car 1 (Vettel).

Ignoring this message and trying to avenge issues from a title deciding race at the end of the previous season Vettel launched risky attacks on his team mate which were rebuffed with equal venom and the multi corner fight by the team mates was intense, Vettel came out ahead.

Team Boss Christian Horner came on the radio saying ""This is silly, Seb. Come on."" on lap 46.

On lap 47 Webber tried to repass Vettel, but was forced wide and blocked from overtaking.

Vettel went on to win the race and faced fierce criticism from Webber in the media after the race but Vettel was unapologetic and supported by the team.","['Missed  the ""Valtteri it\'s James"" moments.', ""I'll never forget how Schumacher made it as obvious as possible that Rubens won that and earned that win."", 'Some interesting context about Austria 2002 and Ferrari team orders in general from Ross Brawn \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/UVrlK', 'Thanks for the deep dive into historical team orders events and the effort you clearly put in it.', ""Good read!

Now that the dust has settled in Monza it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""This season had so much potential and I really can't describe how angry and disappointed I am that the tyres are consistently far too hard."", 'I‚Äôm disappointed with McLaren making the ‚Äúthere will be no undercut‚Äù promise to Lando. Because he basically got full protection from a safety car (and took the opportunity of benefitting from a safety car away from Oscar) as well as protection from his teammate getting the pitstop priority. It really took away from their whole ‚Äúfree to race‚Äù sentiment, since it guaranteed the p2 to Lando and negated any opportunity that Oscar could‚Äôve had.\n\nIt reminds me of the Miami sprint, where Oscar pit first and Lando ended up benefitting from a safety car popping up between Oscar‚Äôs pitstop and his, which ultimately gave Lando the win. Lando wanted to avoid this scenario yesterday, as is his right to choose since he was the lead car, and he argued exactly what he needed to ensure the best result for himself (good for him it was exactly what he needed), but McLaren should‚Äôve never promised anything.\n\nBecause then they felt like it was on them to correct the mistake of the pitcrew, when a slow stop was just a different risk Lando exposed himself to in exchange to protecting himself from the risk of a safety car. It just doesn‚Äôt seem fair to me to guarantee a win-win scenario to one driver when unpredictable events may come into play, and have been part of the game in previous races.', 'Ollie did not deserve that penalty. Haas should appeal.', 'I think Mclaren are thinking about this the wrong way. They can only provide equality of opportunity and not equality of outcome. They should have just asked Norris whether he wants to pit or not. They are rivals and the garages should act like it\n\nHe should not know what Oscar is going to do and vice versa. Will Joseph should just ask if Lando wants to pit. If he does, there is no undercut but he risks the chance of vsc or SC.  If he waits, he risks undercut but can benefit from vsc. He cannot just be given all options and be told what Oscar is going to do. \n\nThey should have just thought the pit stop as racing incident. There should not be a guarantee that whenever he pits he is ahead. Just doesnt make sense.\n\nSure give lando the first chance to take the call but he cannot be just given the advantage on a platter disadvantaging Oscar.', ""McLaren attempting to be as fair as possible to both their drivers could backfire on them and put them in a corner when something arises in the future.\n\nAs Toto said (remember, he is the one TP who has had to deal with his two drivers fighting each other for the WDC), what if the positions of the drivers get swapped by something that's not a pit stop and isn't the fault of the lead driver?\n\nFor example, if the trailing driver gets a free stop under SC/VSC or red flag? Or if a driver from another team pushes the lead McLaren off and thus allows the second driver to get ahead?\n\nPersonally think that Oscar gave up the position without any complaints so that he can use this as leverage for the future. If he's leading on track and anything outside of Lando overtaking him or him getting a penalty results in the positions being swapped, he can mention this on the radio and request for the original positions to be reinstated.\n\nEspecially since in yesterday's race, they were fighting over P2 and P3, so it would only be a 6 point swing. In the majority of the remaining 8 races, they should be battling for P1 and P2, which would be a 14 point swing. And he can try and use this to his favour in a race later on if something out of his control costs him track position to Lando.\n\nBoth McLaren drivers are downplaying this in public, but Max's amused reaction and Toto's opinion on this make it clear it's not something that would happen at other teams and that they find it strange."", ""I will throw an early monkey wrench to the discussion. My apologies to the dudes who manage the place in advance\n\nFrom my understanding, the events took place as follows:\n\n‚Ä¢ Norris has stated, when asked, that he is alright with Piastri stopping first, so as long as he does not end up behind him, essentially an undercut. It is affirmed that nothing of the sort will take place. It is also understood that McLaren's general rule is to let the leading driver pit first\n\n‚Ä¢ Piastri proceeds to pit with 1.9 seconds without a hitch\n\n‚Ä¢ Norris proceeds to pit. There was an issue with the front left tyre. The pit took 5.9 seconds and he ends up behind Piastri instead, which was not a part of what was agreed upon\n\n‚Ä¢ McLaren proceeds to go on the radio and asks Piastri if they could swap back. Piastri was understandably confused, but he decides to honour the request\n\nNorris agreeing to the stop with conditions in the attempts of protecting his position while also ensuring the security of the team's 2-3 position in that manner is understandable. Even though I understand the strategy fully, but ultimately *(and this is admittedly under hindsight)*, McLaren should have stuck to the original agreement provided, or maybe provided risk assessments for the leading driver to take. Reasons being that you do not confuse and alienate the drivers later, and you are also preparing for any misfortunes from taking place, considering how risky it all is\n\nHowever, the gamble did not pay off and the blunder happened *(neither you, me nor a deity can change that)* and McLaren asks Piastri to make the swap, the same way that Norris was asked to make the swap in Hungary 2024. I am of the opinion that bad stops are a part and parcel of the race but not only does McLaren seem to have stipulated procedures about a potential situation like this, given their advantage in the WCC, but the drivers themselves displayed sportsmanship in regards to their team when the other alternative is just as present for the taking. They both acknowledged the team mistake and the difficulty of the other being stuck in this position. I think it is handily established prior that radio messages are not a great indicative of true sentiments, given the lack of full context to the drivers and I don't see why this should be different here.\n\nDo I think the call to swap is understandable? Yes. \n\nDo I think this was a highly unnecessary situation for McLaren to put their drivers into? Also yes. \n\nDo I think this is a warrant for some of the most ridiculous outcries and complaints I had ever seen from the likes of social media users who follow Formula 1? Absolutely not.\n\nTo me personally, the line between fighting for your points and regarding the team dynamics for a team that values themselves more makes the battle interesting. I am curious to see where it goes from here for them. But McLaren definitely needs to sort this out, especially when they want a fair championship fight"", ""Since every discussion here will be about papaya rules, let's not forget the performances of Albon, Hadjar and Gabi.\n\nAlbon has been amazing this season. Going from P14 to P7 is just amazing and he's now ahead of Kimi in the WDC. The battle goes on till Abu Dhabi as he said and right now I'm backing Albon to finish ahead.\n\nHadjar is easily the rookie of the season. Pitlane to P10 is a brilliant effort. Really pleased for him given how it all went wrong in Melbourne. Is he going to get the Red Bull seat for next season? \n\nGabi has also really picked up his race performances. His qualifying performances are getting all the praise and for good reason. Hulk is no slouch on Saturday's and Gabi is beating him fair and square. What's more impressive is that he is improving in races all the time. Now a consistent points finisher, I think he's really setting himself up nicely to lead Audi once Hulk retires."", ""My boi Sainz with another difficult race. At this point I feel like he's on a spiral similar to Antonelli where due to bad luck and a few mistakes, their confidence has completely eroded and they've started acting reckless and desperate. It's tough to see because I know he's a far better driver than his points total shows. A few of his best tracks are coming up and I hope we see him return to his usual level then.\n\nMy other bois Leclerc and Russell having quiet but excellent weekends which has become the usual for them. It feels like both teams have dropped off in performance which is a real shame because the drivers are both in very good form, Silverstone aside."", 'Seems like Sainz and Antonelli are just spiralling at this point. I feel bad for both of them.\n\nSainz has to be desperate for a good result, and Kimi has to be desperate for a result that‚Äôs not ending up beached or with a penalty.', ""Lando wanted the best of both worlds and he got it. If he wanted to pit first and avoid undercut he could've easily done it.\n\nBut he didn't want to risk anything and McLaren provided an environment where he could do so.\n\nIt seems Oscar wasn't on board with giving position back because pit stops are part of racing.\n\nIt seems McLaren's logic was due to the team fuck up, Lando lost a position so he has to get it back. If I'm Oscar I am asking Zak what exactly constitutes a team fuck up. You could argue that team fucked Oscar in Hungary so they should've swapped positions there. If I'm Oscar I'm going through hundreds of scenarios with Zak to establish the Papaya rules because they were obviously not on the same page.\n \nWhat if same happens in AD in final race does Lando give the position back? What would've happened if there's a car in between them yesterday? What if someone clearly gets beneficial strategy while not being ahead? There are hundreds of possible scenarios.\n\nAfter today there are two possibilities. Either Oscar feels team favours Lando and him conceding those 3pts isn't the biggest concern in the world when you're leading WDC. Him getting along with a team is much better for him here if it costs only 3 points. Or he's too big of a coward and he gave Lando position back. And I really can't see the 2nd scenario happening. Max even said without a hint of thinking about it that he wouldn't give the position back. And we know other World Champions and other greats aren't listening to team orders in similar scenarios if it makes them worse.""]",42,232,0.94,42,215,215,5,24,0.029999999999999916,5

Oscar Piastri opened up after a challenging race at Monza, where McLaren opted to swap positions between teammates. While not thrilled, Piastri called the decision ""fair,"" acknowledging Lando Norris had been ahead all race. He reflected on handling struggles in the first stint and accepted that the car lacked the pace to challenge Red Bull. The young Aussie is focused on learning and improving from here.","['The amount of attention this swap is making really says either a lot about how fickle f1 fans are or how boring the race was', 'Going for the diplomatic approach, I see.\n\nIt is probably a smart move on his part. The numbers current favour him in the championship fight -- all he needs to do it win one or two more races and he can finish second to Norris in every other race and still be champion. It would not be worth incurring the ire of the team for the sake of a few extra points. I cannot say that I like it, but McLaren seem to have shot themselves in the foot and Piastri comes out of this looking mature and magnanimous while Norris gets booed on the podium. It might mean playing politics, but with any luck Piastri can parse this into some kind of additional support from the team since the team seem to be hypervigilant about how the public perceive them.', 'The reporter misrepresented the discussion - there was no reference made to protecting from Charles. Norris decided by himself that he wanted the second pit, as long as there was no risk of undercut.\n\nWJ: And Lando, the gap to Verstappen is now 11.1. Lando, we will box this lap onto the soft tyre and come up one \\[on the front wing\\].\n\nLN: Did you want to box the other car first?\n\nWJ: Yep, we‚Äôll do that. We‚Äôll swap it around so stay out.\n\nLN: Well, only if he doesn‚Äôt undercut, otherwise I‚Äôll box first.\n\nWJ: There will be no undercut. Confirming we are staying out\n\nLN: Yeah, confirm.', ""I see people saying this is the right approach but it is not and might hurt Piastri more in the long run. I will explain:\n\nA strategic choice was made to let Piastri pit first due to the chance of a possible SC(non-controllable). This is a clear advantage for Norris. The risk for Norris is that he might get undercut. He had a clear time advantage, so the choice was made with the idea he won't get undercut.\n\nThe pitstop was too long (non-controllable) and made Piastri undercut Norris. Not strategy or planning.\n\nSo this was the deal: the non-controllable circumstances are ONLY in favour of Norris and never in favour of Piastri. If Norris got the SC advantage it would be him in front of Piastri but never Piastri in front of Norris. Terrible deal isn't it?\n\nSo why does this hurt Piastri? \n- Getting played: his team is taking the Mick out of him with this bad deal.\n- The team gets away with it. Next time they will do the same and not feel the pressure of a mad Piastri.\n- Self worth: Piastri is a great driver worthy of the #1 driver in a team.

So I'm not fan of anyone, no biases, just pure interest in racing and what racing right now is in F1 and what it maybe should be ?  
  
Considering what we have seen lately with these penalties to now Bearman vs Sainz and last race Sainz vs Lawson.

I feel like as racing we are entering kind of weird area, I dont know the exact ruling, but whatever it is it needs change or adjustment ?

The thing is if we aren't allowing drivers to go into corners wheel to wheel, then overtakes are not going to happen as often, see in my opinion when Bearman had half of his car alongside Sainz, then Sainz should give that room to allow this fight to happen, same goes to Liam though it was more of like racing incident imo, but still Liam shouldve propably leave bit more space before closing.

Another thing I wanted to discuss is the turn 1 in Monza, like Norris and Verstappen are alongside one another and Norris kind of doesn't turn (turns late/has too much speed) and instead goes more forward which pushes VER out of the track as he just cannot turn otherwise they crash and its like so who is first at that apex ? If we go by centimeters we might find the answer but is that racing ?   
  
The thing I heard on broadcast is Lando is on the racing line and he is entitled to it but is he ? Was he on racing line ? He barely made the turn imo, he was carrying too much speed and it shows on the line he had to take in that case. Going over the curb having only his right wheels slightly over the track limits line. Thats not racing line is it or rather not the optimal racing line (its shit line that would lose time every lap) but then it begs the question whats stops you from turning late in every turn and leaving the car on the outside not able to turn, with this current scenario it seems you can do that everytime and imo it just promotes unhealthy racing. Like everytime it seems  you want to be on the inside, slightly ahead and then just turn late so the car on outside cannot do shit and has to either crash you or leave track and thus overtake outside of track.

What's your thoughts on these scenarios, what would be the ideal way to ""fix"" or let me know why you think its good the way it is now. Whatever feels right to you.   
  
Just bring no biases into this discussion pretty please, let's keep it healthy for F1 and racing in general so we can all enjoy the best of both worlds.","['So the important context to remember is that the guidelines as they currently exist were agreed upon by, and developed with, the drivers. This is the ruleset they wanted. \n\nAs a fan, though, I agree that it\'s...not great as is. Another good example from this weekend was an incident in the F2 sprint. Dunne pulled a massive move, came from very far back into T1 on the inside and got to the apex first, and essentially ran Megatounif out of track. Meg then had a lot of momentum, came across and hit Dunne on the outside of T2. Meg was penalized for rejoining unsafely and causing a collision, but the scenario in general was caused by Dunne a) playing the rules well and b) somehow controlling a wild divebomb.\n\n But there was also generally nothing Meg could have done to avoid contact - it was a low probability move from Dunne, but should Meg have braked earlier as the first into the corner, to just let Dunne by? That\'s the only way that I can see that contact could have been avoided by the defending driver. \n\nIn general, I think we all want to see hard, controlled wheel-wheel racing. We want overtakes to be encouraged, but still difficult to do. If the car ahead at the apex can run the other car off of the track at will, it doesn\'t make for great overtakes. \n\nIt may not help, or it may cause other, larger issues that I\'m not thinking of, but I\'d be curious how changing the definition of ""alongside"" to represent the literal position of the car would impact racing. Essentially, say, if the front tyre is beside the rear, then the lead car has to provide at least a half car length or a tyre\'s width of room on track - something, to give the trailing driver a chance to not crash or run off track, while still likely losing out on the position.', ""The drivers asked for this level of detail in the guidelines and it's been dreadful.\n\nAs Mark Hughes at The Race suggested recently, the best thing for them to do would be to scrap 80% of the guidelines, because they can never cover for 100% of racing scerarios."", ""Lap 1 should be on Norris for pushing a car off the track, but ultimately the stewards didn't make a call on it.\n\nNorris was behind going into the corner, he was behind in the corner and he was behind coming out of the corner so at no point was he entitled to that corner.\n\nBut the fact that RBR felt the need to give up the place regardless speaks volumes about how rules are either to vague and open to interpretation, or the lack of trust in the stewards making the right call."", 'Good job on catching that Norris was a bit wide on T1, so Max went wide to give more space which led to the runoff, then he had to give it back.\n\n\nMost new viewers (and old viewers) have not noted that nuance, usually just hurr durr max agression, etc.', 'And that\'s why we have the term ""racing incident"", because there are many times were both drivers can be in the right and yet something still happens. I don\'t know how to make it better, but the only suggestion so far that seems to be the best is the idea of having a fixed team of stewards instead of having them switched up every race. Some more consistency is needed, but other than that, racing will always be a very tricky thing to monitor and penalize correctly all the time.', 'It‚Äôs too complicated and the drivers are at fault for this because they keep saying this is how we did it since karting. So it‚Äôs a fundamental problem with racecraft starting at the very beginning of the ladder. In the old days the fear of being killed if you didn‚Äôt leave some space for someone or reacted to their move kept things in check. Now that is no longer a deterrent. It has to start in karting and it‚Äôs two simple rules. Always leave the width of one car length beside you and do not react to a move being made.', 'Online sim racing has it pretty simple. As Alonso said, all the time you have to leave the space. Works well. Been asking for years why it can‚Äòt also work like this IRL.\n\nIn cases like Lando T1, if you don‚Äòt leave the space and therefore force the other car off track, there is no issue with cutting the chicane since you were basically forced to cut it.', 'The main issue I think everyone agrees on is that the ""First at Apex"" rule they are currently following is bad.\n\nFormula 1 has the big downside of cars being very fragile. This has improved with the 2022 regulations, but contact still means parts break off, leading to loss of downforce and therefore pace.\n\nThis fragility means that I personally feel overtakes more often than not turn into ""either you move out of the way, or we crash"" moves.  \nThis is only increased by the ""First at Apex"" Guideline for Stewards. It rewards reaching the apex first by any means necessary. It doesn\'t matter if you push the outside car on the grass, it\'s legally your corner now.\n\nWe don\'t need NASCAR levels of overlap to be allowed space, but front axle ahead of the rear axle would be a start for both defender and attacker', ""To explain a litte the guide lines, in a very summed up way.\n\nOvertake on the inside: This one is fairly simple, if, before the apex, your front axle is side by side with the other car's rear view mirror, its your corner and the other guy cant close you or deny you space or anything. Yes, that does mean you can do an overtake while being slightly behind a car as you both turn. Naturally, you need to complete the corner, you cant just send the car and not manage to turn, and the racing line has to be compatible with an overtake.\n\nOverake on the outside, and this is the universal headache for all the drivers: Your front axle, AT THE APEX, needs to be side by side with the other driver's or even further ahead, and then its your corner and the other guy has to give it to you unless they exit the corner better. Problem is, how do you defend from an overtake on the outside? The way you usually defend from that as it happens, is ease up on the brake to be ahead at the apex, and thats where the problem starts for a lot of drivers, cause it becomes a fight for the apex and not the position.

1nbabp4,[Opinion] The drama surrounding McLaren‚Äôs swap is due to their strategy and garages being unable to react live to race events,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nbabp4/opinion_the_drama_surrounding_mclarens_swap_is/,2025-09-08, Discussion,"As a fan, and seeing how McLaren operates today (very different from the 2000s), the drama over today‚Äôs swap seems to stem from the fact that, while the car is now a race winner, the team still falls short of a championship team level in some areas. Unlike Mercedes or Red Bull, McLaren struggles to maximize every situation live during races.

On several occasions, the team hasn‚Äôt been able to adapt or respond quickly enough to unfolding race scenarios, often failing to counter rival strategies. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, sometimes their approach works out, but they don‚Äôt seem to be as ‚Äúclinical‚Äù as RBR with strategy for example, with all respect for McLaren team.

Today‚Äôs swap issue, in my view, arose from a calculation error and slow reaction to live race events. The logical plan was simple: if Lando (running in front) chose to pit second, it would give Piastri the chance of an undercut, so if Piastri then took the lead due to pit stops, McLaren would swap them to keep the order. Easy to understand from their POV (‚ÄúPiastri, if you undercut because the strat order, you must give back because it was _gifted_ to you‚Äù)

However, what really happened was that an unexpected event (the slow stop for Lando) was the true cause for the position change. Without the +3s added to the stop, Lando would have come out in front of Piastri.

Fairly, Piastri should have stayed ahead as he only benefited because of the slow pit stop, not  because the strategy of who pits first. So the swap clause shouldn‚Äôt have been ‚Äúactivated‚Äù, as he wasn‚Äôt in front because strategy. 

In the end, McLaren stuck to a plan rather than reacting to real circumstances, showing the team still has ground to cover to act like a true championship contender. And this is just another time of them doing this, watching the race in delay and going too hard by their pre-race scenarios, without ability to adapt to the moment.","[""We will get these posts a lot those two weeks, don't we"", 'You guys have changed the concept of undercut to include overtaking a car due to a slow pit stop.', ""> if Piastri then took the lead due to pit stops, McLaren would swap them to keep the order.\n\n\nThis is exactly what happened - only it was a slow pit stop, not an undercut, that caused the issue.

Norris wasn't in much danger of being undercut, so they could've just pitted Piastri first and avoided the issue.\xa0 Yet, he was told to give the position back to Piastri.\xa0That was back when Norris was the leading McLaren and was still aiming for a WDC.\n\n\nMcLaren has made the decision that a swap due to a team error has to be rectified by the drivers.
