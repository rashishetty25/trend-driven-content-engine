Just wanted to share some frustration and perhaps also a warning. We bought tickets for an F1 experience at Monza that included a pit walk, trophy photo and a track tour.... So the starter package ü§£

Anyway long story short when we did the pit walk all the cars were covered and garages were basically closed. So you pay a lot of money.... Well for me it's a lot and you end up with this.

Anyway maybe I was expecting too much. But if you are planning doing some similar maybe ask them what time you will do the pit walk and if it will be open.

Just my rant annoy your day","['You‚Äôre justified, it kinda defeats the whole point of a pit walk if it‚Äôs closed. Otherwise you‚Äôd just save a fuck ton of money and just tour it when there isn‚Äôt a race.', 'That sounds really annoying. I would have been disappointed as well.', ""I would open a complaint and see if you can get anything as a result. You paid a heavy fee to get an elevated experience and fundamentally, didn't receive what you paid for. They have enough money to cover you walking down a pitlane."", 'Doing anything F1 isn‚Äôt cheap and it bugs me how this sort of thing happens.', ""We did this in Mexico last season, and I sort of learned that you have to get to the pit walk early. We did the track tour and photo first and I'd definitely swap the order next time. With the food trucks and drinks it was still a fun night and I'd do it again.\n\nWilliams never covered their cars or even their pit wall setup. Made me a bigger fan of them since I got a good peek even after the sun was set.\n\nETA that you're totally justified being annoyed by it, I'm not saying you shouldnt be."", 'That sucks.\nS√£o Paulo 2024 was bustling with activity', 'Unrelated question - what‚Äôs up with all the sand?', ""Is that even allowed? I can imagine the circuit is closed down to the public when there isn't a race.

The season was also tinged with tragedy: Antonio Ascari, winner at Spa, lost his life just a month later in Montlh√©ry. The 1925 World Championship was the first world championship title assigned in the history of motorsport, and it was the first of five World Championships for Alfa Romeo, since it would be followed by the 1950 and 1951 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship and by the 1975 and 1977 World Sportscar Championships.

The main one is that Italy, as organiser of the championship (Arturo Mercanti, presidente of the Italian Club and founder of the Autodromo di Monza, was the one who dratfed the first regulations for the WMC), vetoed the inclusion of a grand prix in Spain in response to the ban received by Diatto and Alfieri Maserati the year prior during a hill climb race in Rabassada.\xa0""]",83,8,0.97,83,8,8,9,0,0.010000000000000009,9
