1ky7p64,This is what 'Platinum' actually means for Max Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ky7p64/this_is_what_platinum_actually_means_for_max/,2025-05-29, Discussion,"I see a lot of misconceptions about what this 'Platinum' thing means that Max Verstappen has since yesterday, so this is what it actually is.

Platinum is a *rating* from the FIA, it's not a *licence*. As a driver you request to be rated by the FIA, you do not ask to be given a specific rating. The FIA decides what rating you get. It's like a tool or a guide for racing organisations like the SRO (GT World Challenge etc.), so they know where to place this driver into a certain category (like Pro, Pro-Am etc.), depending also on the rating of the driver's teammates.

Being rated by the FIA does not ""bring Verstappen closer to competing in WEC and ELMS"", because it's not a licence. Being Platinum is not a requirement at all to race in those championships nor did Verstappen need to do anything extra to be given a rating apart from just asking for one.

Also, not all F1 drivers are Platinum-rated. As a driver you only ask to be rated, if you intent on doing sports car racing. Only 6 current F1 drivers (including Max) actually have a Platinum-rating: Alonso (WEC champion and Le Mans winner), Colapinto (ELMS race winner and Spa 24H competitor), Norris and Stroll (Rolex 24 at Daytona competitors), and Hülkenberg (Le Mans winner). Edit: I didn't wanna forget about Friday drivers Drugovich, Hirakawa and Vesti, who too have a rating.

Alongside the facts listed above, my personal expectation is Verstappen might try and do the KW 6h ADAC Ruhr-Pokal-Rennen, the sixth round of the Nürburgring Langstrecken Serie on August 16. He is definitely not doing WEC or ELMS.

Edit: you don't even technically need to ask to be rated, but it is very common to do. As somebody who's been working in the sports car racing industry for a while now, I've seen cases of drivers set to make their debut without having requested to be rated. The FIA will then scramble to find out who this driver is and what their career history is to rate them asap 😅","['At risk of pedantry Haas test driver Ryo Hirakawa, who is doing FP1 for them this week, is platinum too', 'I believe after you turn 50 the FIA takes away your platinum status.

1ky6yot,[AMuS] Excitement through new front wing checks,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ky6yot/amus_excitement_through_new_front_wing_checks/,2025-05-29, News,,"['I expect to be disappointed', ""*Preview of the 2025 Spanish GP*\n\nTranslation:\n\n> **The FIA \u200b\u200bhas announced stricter front wing checks for Barcelona. We'll reveal what this means in our Grand Prix preview.**\n\n> Many engineers have marked the Spanish Grand Prix in bold on their calendars this year. During the winter break, the FIA \u200b\u200bannounced that all teams would have to prepare for more rigorous front wing testing leading up to the Barcelona weekend. Those who had designed the carbon elements to be too flexible in the past had to retrofit them.\n\n> A flexible front wing, in which the main blade and flaps bend backward, not only reduces drag, resulting in higher top speeds on the straights. The built-in flexibility also helps optimize the setup balance between fast and slow corners.\n\n> In tighter corners, drivers want the front axle to grip the turn. This requires a lot of downforce, which a steeply angled front wing produces. In faster corners, it's more comfortable for the drivers if the rear end doesn't veer off so easily. If the front wing is flatter, the aero balance automatically shifts rearward.\n\n> Since this trick became popular over the past two years, teams have taken increasingly extreme approaches to bending. Development has been increasingly tailored to this. With testing becoming more stringent, engineers now have to put the brakes on. The question is which cars will lose the least performance with the stiffer wings.\n\n> Some teams, including McLaren, predict that the new rules won't significantly change the balance of power from the first eight races. Others, such as Red Bull and Ferrari, hope that the gap to the Papaya cars will be noticeably reduced.\n\n> Barcelona could therefore represent a turning point in the season. The varied track has always been a good indicator for the rest of the year. Those who don't show any weaknesses here will be good anywhere. Many teams are also basing their performance on Barcelona as a factor in how long the development of the 2025 cars will progress.\n\n> The weather isn't expected to cause any additional drama. The latest forecasts call for dry conditions throughout the entire race weekend. Maximum temperatures are expected to only slightly exceed 25°C. A warmer climate would be especially welcome for McLaren. Then they could once again use the tire joker in the race – as they did recently in Miami.\n\n> **The track: Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.**\nThe Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya is an ideal benchmark for the cars' performance. Fast corners with high centrifugal forces alternate with medium-speed and slow corners. All-rounders are especially in demand. Those who look good here usually do well on other tracks as well. Because all types of corners are accommodated, an efficient aerodynamic package is required.\n\n> Despite two DRS zones and the more than one-kilometer-long straight, overtaking is traditionally difficult in Barcelona. Qualifying therefore remains crucial. The 600-meter-long sprint into the first corner is one of the longest of the entire season. Here, we often see slipstream battles as the chasing pack chases the man in pole position.\n\n> **Das Setup.**\nBarcelona has been a fixture on the calendar since 1991. The technicians know the track's quirks almost inside and out. The changing winds from the nearby Mediterranean can occasionally throw up surprises. The wings have to be set very steeply at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya to provide sufficient downforce and stability for the fast corner combinations.\n\n> Brake wear is usually not an issue. The engines aren't subjected to excessive strain either. Tires, however, are a regular source of tension in races. As usual, Pirelli brings the very hard compounds C1 to C3. The fast right-hand corners T3 and T9 place particular strain on the left front tire.\n\n> **The Upgrades.**\nAs already mentioned, Barcelona is one of the benchmark tracks in Formula 1. After the wave of upgrades at Imola, we expect to see many new parts on the cars again. Sauber has already announced a larger package. Mercedes also intends to significantly expand its offerings.\n\n> More exciting, however, is the new regulations. Most teams will have to respond to the more stringent endurance tests with reinforced wings. In most cases, the changes will not even be visible from the outside. Mercedes had already conducted test runs in Bahrain and Imola with a stiffer Barcelona wing.\n\n> **The favorites.**\nMcLaren is naturally at the top of the list of favorites again. The high temperatures and above-average tire wear favor Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. The two Papaya drivers travel to Catalunya separated by just three points. This could cause internal tensions.\n\n> Max Verstappen should be significantly more competitive than he was in Monaco. The fast corners of Barcelona are exactly what the RB21 is looking for. The world champion already showed in Imola that he's ready to take advantage of even the slightest opportunity. Since 2016, only two drivers have won in Barcelona: Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton.\n> Speaking of Hamilton: Barcelona will be Ferrari's last chance to turn things around. The Scuderia must finally get its tire problem under control in qualifying. And the setup window must be larger. In Monaco, they were able to concentrate entirely on the slow corners. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200ball-round qualities will be required again.\n\n> Mercedes also travels to Spain with concerns. Tire wear has been the Silver Arrow's Achilles heel twice this year. If the problem isn't addressed, a Waterloo could occur on the tire-killing track in Barcelona.\n\n> Williams has proven in recent races that while the speed is not enough to get to the front, the car is so consistent that it can score points when the competition is weak.\n\n> Behind them, Toro Rosso, Aston Martin, Haas, and Alpine are also waiting for slip-ups in the tight midfield. Sauber has recently remained well outside the top ten. Fans of the Swiss team will have to hope that the upgrades work."", 'Excitement, excitement aaaand nothing really changes.', 'And after all this anticipation, nothing will change probably', 'Whatever be the outcome, it will still be a 500X more interesting weekend compared to Monaco imo', 'I expect no big change.', 'if somehow aston are the ones most affected by this change as in 2023 and they are the 9th-10th team again I will fucking riot', '100% I am ready to be hurt again.', 'Getting excited for this weekend.']",161,87,0.93,161,83,83,8,1,0.0,8

That's unfortunate in my mind, but I guess not everyone agrees. Is Damson Idris supposed to be a rookie? Is he playing younger than he is?

This is as if McLaren had legitimately asked Hakkinnen to end his sabbatical to mentor Oscar lol.', ""Yeah, I know it's common which was why I was hoping it was happening with Pitt. I was pretty sure it was happening with Damson. I don't care about Damson playing young, it's fine. It was just funny to me when I saw a few pictures of them next to the drivers, and this guy that is probably supposed to be 21 or so standing next to people like Oscar and Lando, and even Carlos and looking older than them. It's fine. Some people just look older than their age. If I was told that someone who looked like him was 21 I wouldn't automatically jump to thinking they were lying, I'd just think he looked really old for his age. I think it makes more sense when there are only actors around, putting in real life athletes hanging around skews it a bit, but whatever. I totally understand doing it with high schoolers, because labor rights make it annoying to work with anyone under 18. And kids are usually worse actors. So a typical show casts a 22 year old to be 15, and then when the show is still going on five years later and the teens are only supposed to have aged two years, you just go along with it."", ""Spoilers for a trailer I watched. \n\nYeah, I didn't know it was that long ago. Or I guess I wasn't positive it was set in the modern era and not like set in 2007ish times, so the 90s wouldn't have been that long ago. If the character was in his 40s, the gap from his retirement would have also had to have been smaller, and it would just be all around less crazy. It would be almost like a more extreme version of calling Hulk back. It could be like if Massa retired after his 2009 crash, ended up racing elsewhere, but then came back in like 2017 to mentor Stroll because Papa Stroll wanted Lance to have a mentor. And Massa can be a few years older than he was then. That would be extreme, but still semi-believable. Not like 55ish year old Pitt whose character can't have been that established in F1 because he's apparently never won an F1 race?\n\nI'll watch it and enjoy it, I just wish they'd gone with making the character younger. Pitt could totally play a 40 something. After factoring in the never won a race thing, maybe he's not actually that old? Maybe he had barely started his F1 career and was like 23 in 1999? He could maybe barely be late 40s now? Though I'm not sure why someone who barely had an F1 career twenty five years ago would be the ideal candidate for an F1 rookie.""]",0,14,0.39,0,68,68,0,0,-0.02999999999999997,0
