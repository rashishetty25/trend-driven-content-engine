While the immediate impetus for the renovations is the arrival of MotoGP in 2027, the ultimate goal is far more ambitious: to return the pinnacle of motorsport to Argentinian soil after an absence of over two decades from the calendar.\n\nThe project\'s master plan has been designed by Hermann Tilke, the renowned German engineer responsible for numerous modern Formula 1 circuits. His proposal, selected from several alternatives, foresees the construction of a new track measuring almost five kilometres, incorporating contemporary safety standards and significant design modifications.\n\nWhile the new circuit will achieve FIA Grade 2 homologation — a prerequisite for hosting top-level international competitions — this is still insufficient for the immediate return of Formula 1, which requires Grade 1 certification. Nevertheless, the authorities view this as a stepping stone towards achieving that goal in the near future.\n\n\'We have a two-phase plan. The first phase is for MotoGP in 2027, and the second phase is for Formula 1. This involves upgrading to a full A licence for the FIM and achieving Grade 1 status for the F1. It\'s not just about technical issues and all the requirements we have; it\'s also about the walls and the fenders. All of this should result in a very good and exciting circuit,"" Hermann Tilke explained at the official announcement event, which SoyMotor.com attended via our Latin American correspondent, Daniel Panelo.\n\nThe remodelling will have a profound effect on the appearance of the Buenos Aires layout. Historic bends such as Vivorita, Cajón, Ombú, Tobogán Traverso and the S for Senna will be redesigned and removed to create a safer, more fluid design. However, the names of these bends will live on, as they will be used to christen curves and sections of the new course.\n\nThe Curvón Salotto and Chicana de Ascari area, on the other hand, will remain unchanged, preserving a part of circuit number 12 which is familiar to fans of national motor racing.\n\nThe project is being led by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires in collaboration with private promoters such as the OSD Group. In addition to the layout modifications, improvements to infrastructure, safety and access will be made, including new kerbs, optimised drainage, tyre protection, electrical upgrades and grandstands with a capacity of up to 120,000 spectators.\n\n\\[...\\]']",196,39,0.94,196,39,39,121,12,0.009999999999999898,121
