I must\'ve listened to about 5 bring back v10s ""your questions answered"" podcasts, and it\'s clear that they have a very high impression of him.\n\n[Here\'s the most recent example I just finished listening to - go to 24:30](https://youtu.be/D9qvO2Zuqmk?si=J2ve3zYcJLBpz8NI)\n\nMark Hughes: (paraphrasing) ""There\'s only two drivers who were head and shoulders above the others in the 1990s\xa0 and those were Hakkinen and Schumacher. The others were quite evenly matched. Irvine, Frentzen, Coulthard, Barrichello, Villeneuve, Fisichella were all evenly matched""\n\nI find this comment pretty bizarre because (among other things) it implies that Hakkinen was in the same league as Schumacher, but even weirder, a respected formula 1 journalist is saying something that is highly debatable and is just casually passing it off as an accepted fact. I get when people say Schumacher was the best of his generation and pass it off as a fact of conversation - he has the results to back that up, but there\'s zero basis to shoehorning Hakkinen there with him.\n\nWhy is Hakkinen rated so highly? Especially if you agree with Mark Hughes, I\'d like to understand why. I\'ve watched all of Hakkinen\'s races, analyzed all of his results, and I just don\'t understand it.', ""Now that we're into the launch season proper, am I the only one who finds the car unveilings to be underwhelming? I think that's my issue with the F1 75 Live event -- it kind of took the wind out of the sails for the 2025 cars. This time last year, I was eagerly checking my calendar and refreshing the page, waiting for the next car to be revealed.

Hakkinen got out after a poor 2001 season and it is often brushed away as just lack of motivation. If he had continued on for a few years and had more poor seasons it would have affected his reputation worse.\n\n- He was a better qualifier than racer. A lot of fans and experts put a lot of weight on qualifying as it’s the best indicator of ‘raw speed’.\n\n- People have a lot of admiration for him for coming back from his severe head injury in 1995.\n\n- He just comes across as a pretty nice guy in general. Your personality can have a big impact on how you are perceived, see Villeneuve for the opposite effect.\n\nA bit unrelated, but I also find it bizarre that Hughes puts the likes of Coulthard and Fisichella as evenly matched with drivers like Frentzen, Villeneuve or Barrichello. Hughes puts a lot of weight on qualifying pace when rating drivers, but that wouldn’t explain why he would rate Coulthard on par with the others, or even close to them considering he was a mediocre qualifier.', 'It\'s the ""being the only driver Schumacher feared"" nonsense. Just because they were friendly with each other, which Schumacher wasn\'t with JV, Hill, Montoya...', ""There was a perception (rightly or wrongly) at the time that Hakkinen was actually faster over one lap (9 poles in 98, 11 in 99), but Schumacher was the more complete package. Also you have to bare in mind that in Hakkinen's prime, Schumacher had yet to win those 5 titles - at the end of 99, they were equal in titles, and even when he retired at the end of 2001, it was still only 4 - 2 in Schuamcher's favour (the same as Vettel - Alonso for comparison). I agree with you and think it's ridiculous to look back now, but it was often said at the time and not too surprising that a journalist of the time has it still in his head. Also, as good as Mark Hughes is, you have to take the British journalist angle into it as well, they never were bowled over by Michael due to his incidents (especially 1994) so they've always tempered their praise of him"", ""I think it's because there were very few drivers that actually beat Schumacher at all during that era. From 1994 to 2006 the only champions other than Schumacher were Hill, Villeneuve, Hakkinen and Alonso. \n\nObviously Alonso is rightly considered one of the best but of the other three I think it helps that Hakkinen quit F1 whilst he was still doing pretty well. Hill and Villeneuve both had years after their championships where they moved to much less successful teams and had underwhelming performances which has impacted their legacy."", ""To be honest, I think it's a better experience for the vast majority of fans at the expense of a small number of more dedicated fans (like many of us here) who would have happily sat through lots of individual team car reveals.\n\nPersonally, I often find car reveal season a bit underwhelming anyway. Lots of hype for an unveiling that's usually not the real car.""]",4,18,0.7,4,16,16,2,5,0.07999999999999996,2
1iwqacf,"Do we have a record lowest number of current drivers to have taken part in an earnest ""title battle""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iwqacf/do_we_have_a_record_lowest_number_of_current/,2025-02-24, Discussion,"Obviously, modern F1 fans are well aware of the level of net dominance we've seen in the past 15 years, with only 1 WDC winner since 2010 winning it fewer than 4 times. However, those 15 years have had very different outcomes, of some years seeing a straight cruise to the record books, versus others with a number of different drivers in contention right through the final race. 

Currently, our grid is not only very rookie-heavy, but the dominance over the most recent regulations cycle has dwindled the number of drivers to ever have taken part in an earnest title battle. 

At any point in any season, only Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, and Lando Norris have ever truly been in the running to win the WDC. Considering that 3 of them are champions themselves, that's a pretty surprising statistic. 

Considering that FOM themselves have hyped up long shots like Perez in 2023 or Bottas for a number of years, there are seasons in which a great deal of drivers have had more legitimate title shots than any of the other 15 drivers on this year's grid... but of course, with aspiring competitors in potentially top seats like Piastri, Lawson, Russell, and Antonelli, we may add to this list quickly! ","[""1994 post Senna's death and when Mansell wasn't present, there was zero drivers who had ever battled for a championship prior to 1994 let alone won one."", ""I think you would have to meaningfully define 'title battle' cause Leclerc challenged Verstappen in the start but faded. As did Norris."", 'The first ever f1 season had no drivers to have previously been In a battle for an F1 Championship.', 'We just need to not have one car way faster than the rest to start the season. Now when we practically have no mechanical retirements or major issues anymore, being even ~ 0.2, 0.3 ish seconds quicker a lap consistently can pretty much end the season in a few races.', ""2004 only had Schumi, Kimi that challenged for a WDC for 1 year and a washed Villeneuve who was a 1 time WDC.\n\nThat's worse than 3 multi WDCs who battled for multiple WDCs each and Lando who had a title battle last year."", ""2007 maybe? Only Alonso and Raikkonen had really been in proper title fights before that season. So that's (x2).\n\n\nThis year Leclerc has never really been in the running for a title yet and Norris was barely in the running at all last season because the field got way more competitive in the second half so a bunch of teams and drivers, including his own teammate, took wins and points away from him when a dominant car like Verstappen had early season would have given him a much better chance of catching up Verstappen's gigantic lead. I'd honestly say only Alonso, Hamilton and Verstappen have been in proper title fights on the current grid. Including Norris is incorrect IMO. So (x3).\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Just had a look back from 1994-2006. Looks about right give or take depending on what you call a credible title contender. I don't really class Villeneuve as a credible challenge to Hill in their dominant 1996 Williams for example. Some might think it's harsh but to me he was no challenge to Hill in the championship the whole season.\xa0\n\n\n1994 Senna, Mansell (x2).\n\n\n1995 Mansell, Schumacher (x2).\n\n\n1996-1997 Schumacher, Hill (x2).\n\n\n1998 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve (x3).\n\n\n1999 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve, Hakkinen (x4).\n\n\n2000-2001 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Hakkinen, Irvine (x4).\n\n\n2002 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Irvine (x3).\n\n\n2003 Schumacher, Villeneuve (x2).\n\n\n2004-2005 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen (x3).\n\n\n2006 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen, Alonso (x4)\n\n\nSo quite a few seasons during this time have had 2 previous title contenders on the grid."", ""If the field was closer it would not have been that different, maybe Sainz/Russel , other than that who's good enough to be in the mix?"", ""will this year be pog to watch as someone who's never watched before?"", ""Alboreto was on the grid during that time wasn't he? He'd battled for the title in 1985, though his challenge fell apart in the closing rounds due to Ferrari shitting the bed (I'd compare it to Vettel's 2017, for a modern reference point).""]",0,24,0.36,0,22,22,0,-1,0.010000000000000009,0
1iw7rnc,10 best episodes of Drive to Survive for a complete beginner?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iw7rnc/10_best_episodes_of_drive_to_survive_for_a/,2025-02-23, Discussion,"My girlfriend is finally starting to express some interest in F1, which is fantastic, and she wants to watch some Drive to Survive. We'll watch the most recent season when it comes out, but she won't do all six previous seasons, so can anyone recommend 10-ish episodes from the past six seasons that would best prepare her to watch this year? 

  
Does anyone have any standout episodes? Is there anything that best explains the sport and some of the rules? She's more interested in the behind-the-scenes/drivers than anything, but some background into the sport would also be helpful.
