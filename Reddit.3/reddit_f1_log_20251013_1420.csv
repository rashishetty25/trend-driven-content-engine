1o5ftsq,Can Max (or anyone) catch Hamilton for wins at different circuits?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o5ftsq/can_max_or_anyone_catch_hamilton_for_wins_at/,2025-10-13, Statistics,"Lewis’s career spans three different rule cycles — and he’ll be going into a fourth one soon. During the early 2010s, F1 introduced a lot of new circuits (like Korea, India, Turkey, etc.), many of which were later dropped. Nowadays, there’s much less variation in the calendar — a few tracks might fall off (Imola, Zandvoort, Spa), and only one new track (Madrid) is added.

On the current calendar, the only circuit left for Max to win at is Singapore (and Madrid if Red Bull builds a strong enough car).

The combination of career longevity, era transitions, and addition and deletion of tracks that helped Hamilton reach 31 is hard to replicate in today’s more stable F1 calendar.

Zero victories, third place in the Constructors’ Championship with Red Bull breathing down their necks in fourth, growing discontent, and internal friction — with six Grands Prix still to go, starting this weekend in Austin.\n\nThe car was born bad, and the fixes haven’t worked. Even worse, looking ahead to 2026 — a key year for everyone, starting with Leclerc — Ferrari somehow managed to avoid improving it, sticking to ineffective solutions, while Mercedes made progress (two wins for Russell). Mistakes should be lessons, or at least acknowledged, to avoid repeating them. Instead, excuses and blame-shifting (often toward the drivers) have become routine, particularly from Vasseur but not only him. Without calling for yet another revolution — which would mean a long reset — perhaps some targeted reforms would be enough. The rumors about Horner seem more aimed at destabilizing the team, especially with the French team principal’s renewal just two months away.\n\nSomething in the Maranello–track axis isn’t working. Hamilton has pointed it out, pushing for changes in methods and procedures. Reportedly, Lewis has sent another report to the top management expressing his concerns.\n\nFerrari has denied rumors of a heated confrontation between Vasseur and Matteo Togninalli, the track operations coordinator, but the engineer from Valtellina — one of the key figures in the chain of command — is once again under scrutiny. He had already been questioned after the double disqualification in China but had regained the confidence of deputy team principal Jérôme D’Ambrosio and technical director Loïc Serra. Now, however, the situation has deteriorated: strained relationships within the team, too many mistakes in car setup, changes, and weekend execution. This explains the mystery of why Ferrari starts well during free practice — using baseline simulator setups — only to fade in crucial moments.\n\nThe team is being criticized for an overly centralized trackside management structure that stifles flexibility and responsiveness — a weakness particularly evident in qualifying, where quick thinking and a deeper understanding of details can make a real difference. The recurring and unresolved issue of getting the tires up to temperature forces drivers to constantly push beyond comfort. Mercedes has long been working on this — extracting performance from a car that isn’t top-tier — and even experimenting with using medium tires in qualifying, with good results. This is part of what Lewis was referring to: he expected to have more influence over decision-making but has instead found his suggestions ignored and has had to battle internal “politics” just to implement improvements. Vettel went through something similar — but with one key difference. In his first year in red, 2015, the German had a limited car, but it was part of a team ready to seize opportunities when they arose. For Lewis, that’s not the case.\n\nThe SF-25 has shown massive performance flaws — above all, the inability to run at the ideal ride height needed to generate sufficient downforce. Throughout the season, multiple adjustments were made to prevent excessive wear on the plank (the wooden skid block under the floor, checked by the FIA), following the embarrassing double disqualification in Shanghai. But they weren’t enough — in Barcelona, Budapest, and elsewhere, Ferrari had to make drastic setup changes to avoid further disqualifications after their wear calculations once again proved inaccurate.\n\nMoreover, whispers in the paddock suggest tension between Ferrari and the FIA, which has carried out unusually frequent inspections of the Scuderia’s cars — prompting an ultra-conservative approach across all departments to avoid even the slightest infraction. The track engineering department is just as crucial as the design office when it comes to extracting performance — and this seems to be one of Maranello’s major weak spots. In recent years, many talented engineers have left the “track group” (with more expected to follow). They had called for change — and were themselves changed. Meanwhile, Ferrari’s crisis has only deepened']",97,26,0.93,97,26,26,97,26,0.93,97
