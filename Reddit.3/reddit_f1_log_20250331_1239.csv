1jndvqa,The Curious Case of Nico Hulkenberg's Dominant 06-07 A1GP Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jndvqa/the_curious_case_of_nico_hulkenbergs_dominant/,2025-03-30, Throwback,"I would like to introduce you to the most interesting season driven by an F1 junior in recent memory.

When we think about the junior ladder to F1, we have known it for the last 2-3 decades to be a relatively standardized process. The natural progression of the ladder has generally been:

National F4 (\~150-200hp) -> Regional F3 (\~200-400hp) -> International F2 (\~400-600hp) -> F1

There have been variations over the years, competing series like Formula Renault 2.0/3.5, the introduction of GP3/F3 creating an international F3 step, and so on, but the general process has stayed consistent. There have been drivers who skipped steps (Verstappen skipping F4 and F2, or Antonelli skipping F3), but most drivers have followed this process as a tried and true method of getting to Formula 1.

If we look at Nico Hulkenberg's junior career through the feeder ranks, he followed a similar progression (Note: every series past German F3 has 1 qualifying per 2 races):

2005: Formula BMW ADAC (\~140hp) - 1st Place, 8 wins, 14 podiums, 9 poles in 20 races  
2006: German Formula 3 (\~200hp) - 5th Place, 1 win, 6 podiums, 3 poles in 18 races  
2007: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 3rd Place, 4 wins, 8 podiums, 2 poles in 20 races  
2008: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 1st Place, 7 wins, 8 podiums, 6 poles in 20 races  
2009: GP2 Series (\~600hp) - 1st Place, 5 wins, 10 podiums, 3 poles in 20 races

Nico followed a generally standard progression up the ranks, winning a title at a level before making the step up, and winning F3/F2 back to back, the classic marker of a top tier prospect. You may have noticed, however, that I omitted his A1GP season, so lets go ahead and give that an introduction. A1 Grand Prix (A1GP) was an international single-seater series that ran from 2005 to 2009, featuring teams representing nations. The series had a grid of professional drivers in identical cars with a Lola chassis and a Zytek 3.4L V8 producing \~550hp.

Lets add that series into the progression to see how it looks:

2005: Formula BMW ADAC (\~140hp) - 1st Place, 8 wins, 14 podiums, 9 poles in 20 races  
2006: German Formula 3 (\~200hp) - 5th Place, 1 win, 6 podiums, 3 poles in 18 races  
**2006 - 2007: A1 Grand Prix (\~550hp) - 1st Place, 9 wins, 14 podiums, 3 poles in 20 races**  
2007: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 3rd Place, 4 wins, 8 podiums, 2 poles in 20 races  
2008: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 1st Place, 7 wins, 8 podiums, 6 poles in 20 races  
2009: GP2 Series (\~600hp) - 1st Place, 5 wins, 10 podiums, 3 poles in 20 races

Yes, you are reading that right. **Nico Hulkenberg, a 19 year old F3 driver, during a random winter in the middle of his standard 3 year regional Formula 3 progression, was chosen to represent Germany in an international series with professional drivers in cars with \~550hp and double the downforce. And in only his second year racing cars, he absolutely DOMINATED the field.**

When I say dominated, I don’t mean that lightly. Here are some highlights from this season:

**Round 1: Netherlands (First Weekend, First Victory)**

In his first feature race at Zandvoort, Nico put together an absolutely incredible drive in dry to wet to dry conditions. In a car with more than double the power, and performing his first career pit stops, Nico drove a flawless race, making up 10 seconds in the final dry stint over USA's Phil Giebler to take victory by 7 seconds.

**Round 4: Malaysia (Best Drive...Possibly Ever?)**

After taking second in the sprint race to start the weekend, Nico Hulkenberg put together what you might be able to argue is his greatest career drive. In extreme wet conditions at Sepang, in a race full of professional drivers with identical cars, Nico Hulkenberg **won the race by 43 seconds**. Yes, 4 3. And the cherry on top? He stalled his car at the pit stop and lost 8 seconds. Absolute masterclass. Don't believe me? Watch this: [https://youtu.be/ePmM8Dipz-Q?si=Bnk8jrP9cUGxOCrz&t=4378](https://youtu.be/ePmM8Dipz-Q?si=Bnk8jrP9cUGxOCrz&t=4378)

**Round 6: New Zealand (Grand Slam #1)**

During his first trip racing in the southern hemisphere, Nico Hulkenberg put together an incredible run of form, starting at Taupo. Pole, Sprint Race Win/Fastest Lap, Feature Race Win/Fastest Lap. Another absolute slaughtering of the field, this time in dry conditions and by only a mere 20 seconds: [https://youtu.be/P1ZIQ7Vqd2E?si=kvg1blcZB2ziR1Hl&t=5774](https://youtu.be/P1ZIQ7Vqd2E?si=kvg1blcZB2ziR1Hl&t=5774)

**Round 7: Australia (Grand Slam #2)**

Back to back Grand Slams? Yes indeed. Another brand new circuit for Hulkenberg at Eastern Creek Raceway, another Pole, Sprint Win/Fastest Lap, Feature Race Win/Fastest Lap. The field ran him a bit closer this weekend but he still pulled out a 6 second gap in the feature race to drive home the point.

**Round 8: South Africa (Almost Grand Slam #3)**

Hulkenberg is on a fantastic run, but there's a new twist: street circuit. Racing on the streets of Durban proves no challenge for Nico, who's third Grand Slam in a row was only foiled by losing the fastest lap at the end of feature race. In another filthy display of dominance, Hulkenberg built a 22 second lead in the feature race, had his lead evaporate to a safety car restart with 13 laps to go, and still won by 10 seconds to take his **6th victory in a row**: [https://youtu.be/wbhHXcF7UyY?si=GIzPhXGFwunaRq2F&t=4682](https://youtu.be/wbhHXcF7UyY?si=GIzPhXGFwunaRq2F&t=4682)

**Round 11: United Kingdom (Perfect Finale)**

Having missed Round 9 in Mexico for Euro F3 testing, Hulkenberg returned at round 10 in Shanghai to take 2 third places and seal the championship. At the final feature race at Brands Hatch, Nico drove a phenomenal defensive race to retain the lead with the UK's Robbie Kerr breathing down his neck from start to finish, sealing his 9th victory and 14th podium in just 20 race starts. His victory cost the UK second place in the championship to New Zealand by 1 point.

**Result: Champions**

Nico's outstanding performance throughout this season singlehandedly won the 2006-2007 A1GP championship for Germany. His 9 wins in 20 starts set the series record for most wins and most laps led, which he held until Neel Jani finally surpassed his record to set the final A1GP record at 10 wins...in 60 starts. Nico's performance was a victory for his manager who placed him in the series, Willi Weber, who also happened to be the manager of Michael Schumacher. Weber's confidence in his young German talent was so much that Weber happened to miss Schumacher's final victory for Ferrari in Shanghai to be at Hulkenberg's first A1GP race at Zandvoort.

Curiously, Hulkenberg's performance in this championship did not accelerate his passage through the junior ranks as it may have today. Weber kept him on track, continuing the standard route of the 220hp F3 Euro series for 2007, leading to dominant championships in Euro F3 in 2008 and GP2 in 2009 before going on to have one of the most unique Formula 1 careers in history.

It was purely a teams championship.\nAlso, not every driver was a seasoned professional, many were up and coming amateurs trying to make a name for themselves.  \n\nMost of the professionals were at the end of their careers, not the peak of them, and most teams swapped drivers during the seasons, so in many cases drivers were trying to come to terms with the cars handling qualities, as opposed to maximising their lap speed.\n\nSome of the professionals were relatively inexperienced driving open wheel cars, or hadn't driven one in a decade or more.  Even rally drivers were in the cars, usually quite quick but not great at actually racing.\n\nHulkenberg did become a name I knew during that season, and he was really strong and it did look like he'd be a talent to watch out for on his climb to F1, but it wasn't a clear sign he'd even get there, let alone anything indicating he'd be particularly good in F1.\nCertainly GP2 was a better indicator."", 'Shocking bad luck in F1 to never have a podium.

Might as well just shorten the new regs and then introduce bringing back the V10in another era"", 'Basically the new engines seem like they’re gonna be quite shit, even compared to the current ones and therefore are quite unpopular.\n\nMBS is seeking to boost his popularity, especially with the FIA elections coming up so he’s suggesting switching to V10s with sustainable fuels to try to boost his popularity.\n\nThe problem is the moneys already been spent and the engines are well into development so it’s far too late to back out now and if they try to it will upset the engine manufactures a lot as they’ve probably invested hundreds of millions into them.\n\nTLDR: MBS is trying too boost his popularity by suggesting something he can’t do, at least for quite a few years', ""Haven't all the manufacturers spent hundreds of millions developing these engines lol. Poor Audi will also end up having to be Audi-Honda if they do this"", 'Everyone: We like it when regs are stable, and we get to see the field close up.\n\nFIA: V10s in 2028', ""Spolier alert: it's not.\n\nIt is a welcome destraction for MBS and the FIA who sowed the seeds of the story which has become click-bait fodder because ads."", '> FIA single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis has confirmed these discussions are ongoing, stressing that any change would not and cannot be forced through unilaterally. It will only happen in collaboration with the manufacturers and teams via the established governance processes.\n\n\n> ""Things have changed,"" said Tombazis when I asked him why the certainty of two years ago had been replaced with what would potentially be a dramatic reversal. ""A significant factor is the perception, even amongst manufacturers, about the speed at which electrification will happen.\n\n> ""This is a significant factor, we can\'t deny it. Back in 2020, 2021, when these discussions were had, the trend was pretty decisively in the direction of electrification. I\'m not saying that\'s not happening, but certainly the views of the participants have changed since then.\n\n> ""The second thing is that even if Formula 1 is in very good health financially, it has become important also to protect it against world economic fluctuations. We need to take these protective measures while the sun is shining and not when it starts raining, ideally. The drive to cut costs is important to consider.""\n\nSo sounds like its more than MBS blowing smoke for a distraction.

Heads were stuck in sand for too long, now they\'re looking up and it\'s too late to do anything about it.

The potentially prospect of V10s is solely so they can say ""WE HAVE A PLAN"" when realise the 26 engines are awful next March.', 'on the one hand id love v10s.\n\non the other am not niave enough to think if we go and get V10s then manufactures that have invested millions will stick around.', ""MBS is trying to get on people's good side again.

Other than the turmoil that was the Horner saga, it is an absolute fact that it was the driver's brilliance and determination that won him his fourth title as the team increasingly lost its way.\n\nThe Race were saying pre-testing that the feeling with RBR is that they'll either catch the 'slide' since mid 2024, or won't - and I think they've not. \n\nMark Hughes wrote on Motorsport recently that Verstappen says the RBR is actually not *that* bad to drive now - it's just slow.

With Senna looking at a 30 point deficit after Imola, it would be very tricky to win the 1994 title from there, especially when you consider that Senna’s car suffered mechanical failures in Spain, France and Germany. Even if Schumacher kept his race bans and disqualifications, I think Senna would have fallen short of the title. For 1995, I think it would be very close with Schumacher, but I think Senna would have just come out on top.
