I noticed that a lot when the Red Bulls are braking into the pits.

I get why sports cars pop and crackle on startup or when revving, but what exactly causes F1 cars to backfire so much while slowing down?

Watching Hadjar hold his ground in 4th today behind Verstappen (bumped up to 3rd with Norris' DNF) got me wondering this. Obviously, there's plently of jokes about the curse of the second Red Bull seat, and Hadjar getting threatened with a ""demotion"" to Red Bull if he keeps doing well. But honestly, is RB better right now?

I mean, Lawson got off to a miserable start in Red Bull. Then he got 'demoted' to RB and has looked much better since. Yuki looked like he was better off last year at VCARB than he is now at Red Bull (though he's looked a little better since Horner got sacked). Hadjar has looked better than Lawson and Tsunoda, and he's been able to stay at RB. We always hear Verstappen complaining about how shit his car is (sometimes before he pulls off a miracle). I can't help but wonder if Verstappen would look better in an RB car? I mean, what if RB has been the faster car for a few races now and Verstappen has just been working his usual Verstappen magic to make the Red Bull not look as horrible as it is?

He did everything right but if it had been any other driver , that P2 wouldn't have been possible. And if it had 2 safety cars less, Hadjar might very possibly be P2 today.
