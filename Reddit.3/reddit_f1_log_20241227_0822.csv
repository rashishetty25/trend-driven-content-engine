Then he loses control,” the 81-year-old continues. As a result, Tsunoda always “slows down and gets out of control”.

Despite his limited Grand Prix experience, he has the mental strength needed to drive alongside four-time Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen and to accept that you have no chance against him.\n\n>It's a different story for Tsunoda. “We believe that it would lead to great difficulties emotionally if Tsunoda realized next to Max that he couldn't beat him, possibly couldn't even get close and things weren't going as he had imagined,” explained the Red Bull motorsport consultant.\n\n>Marko has already made an initial announcement to Lawson.

1hmkuul,Trip to Modena and Maranello,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hmkuul/trip_to_modena_and_maranello/,2024-12-26, Discussion,"Hello, 
My wife and I are planning a trip to the Modena and Maranello museums soon. I know there have been many posts about visiting these museums, but I’m unsure how up-to-date the information is, and I still have a few questions.

1. How do we get from Modena to Maranello and back? We’ll be traveling by train from Bologna to Modena and back. I’ve seen that there’s a shuttle bus on the museum website, but the timetable seems a bit inconvenient. Are there any better options for getting between the two museums? And if there's a bus between them, how do we get the tickets?

2. Can we visit both museums in one day, or would you recommend dedicating a full day to each?

3. I read in another post that someone recommended taking a guide during the visit, but I didn’t see this option when booking tickets online. Is it possible to hire a guide on-site?

4. I’ve never used a simulator before—not even on a PC. Would the F1 simulator experience still be worth it, or would it likely be frustrating since I’m a complete beginner?

5. Are there any must-visit spots near the museums? This could be anything—great places to eat, nice walking areas, or other attractions in the vicinity.

6. Are there any must-buy souvenirs from either museum, or are there better shops nearby?
Is photography allowed in the museums, and are there any specific spots that are particularly great for photos?

Sorry for so many questions. Thanks in advance for your advice and tips!","['I did both this year in August.\n\n1.\tWe had a car so I can’t talk about transit unfortunately, we parked at Fiorano and got the coach in to Maranello. \n2.\tWe did both in the same day, it was just right, not too much to do at all. \n3.\tWe didn’t book a guide or feel like it was necessary. We did book tickets online beforehand. \n4.\tThe simulators are great and beginner friendly. Maranello has an F1 simulator, and Modena has a GT style one.

I passed on this, it was something like an additional 30 USD for like 10 minutes. But I have a sim rig at home with arguably better hardware lol. Pretty confident they were running Assetto Corsa which is a standard available game, not some crazy secret proprietary software.  But still may be cool as it will allow your brain to see how fast some stuff comes at you. \n\n6. Photography was allowed and encouraged in Maranello. When I did the little bus through the campus tour it wasn’t allowed. I did not find the campus bus tour worth the extra money.', ""2. It depends how much time you'll spend there, but it took me about 1,5-2h to leasurly walk though the Museo in Maranello and have a close look at everything.\n\n  \n4.

You can visit Maranello, have lunch at Cavallino and move to Modena. I’m a long time fan and a bit of a mechanical engineering junkie, it was a blast: hope you’ll have a great time!

I think you can do both museums in one day, but if you are going for the factory tour as well then it may be a bit tight, but I think it should still be manageable. I would strongly recommend the factory bus tour and I quite like the guide. You can book the factory tour when booking museum tickets too. \n\n5. If you want to drive a Ferrari but not rich enough to buy one you can rent a Ferrari to driver around Maranello. Also, you can walk from the museum to the entrance of GeS (or whatever it is called now), which is where the Scuderia is, and when they take the iconic photo. You can see Haas and Scuderia Ferrari staff walking in and out. \n\n6. There are some souvenir shops near the museum.

But it’s not about reactions – which is the physical asset which most obviously begins to decline with age.\n\n>We know this because there have been many tests done of F1 driver reactions – and the outcome is completely normal; a range from fast to slow, just as in any control group of non-racing drivers. One of the greatest racing drivers of all time, Michael Schumacher, had notoriously poor reactions when measured.\n\n>“About the same as mine,” related his then-boss Ross Brawn. Dr. Ricardo Ceccarelli, whose Formula Medicine establishment has worked with a high proportion of the F1 grid of the last three decades, has conducted this test as a matter of routine. He says: “The range is completely normal from fast to slow reactions with the group. My secretary actually had one of the best scores.”\n\n>It's not about reactions, it’s about feel. Reactions measure the response time of our central nervous system to a stimulus. Research conducted by defence contractor (and one-time Williams sponsor) QinetiQ to determine physical suitability of candidates for fighter pilot roles found that sensitivity to rotation and yaw (the very things a racing driver is using to feel and balance a car through a corner) came from receptors in our lower spine which pass messages sub-consciously (and therefore instantly, with zero delay) to our middle ear.\n\n>This would seem to suggest that the effectiveness of this neural pathway is what actually differentiates who can feel a car better than someone else and probably therefore how naturally quick they are.\n\nShame the people who only read headlines and smugly make conclusions will likely miss out on it."", '“So we have a scenario with Hamilton in a ’25 Ferrari where he might just find a car which overlaps with his natural style much better than the Mercedes of the last few years, with a mechanical suppleness which overcomes the inflexible nature of these cars.\n\nIn which case we’ll likely see a fascinating to-and-fro contest between him and Leclerc.\n\nOr, we might see Ferrari pursue that flexi-wing technology to an extent where Hamilton is every bit as stymied as he has been in the ‘24 Mercedes.”\n\nBasically a useless article unless you know what type of car Ferrari will bring in 2025!', '""So, another myth which needs to be put to bed: the ‘fastest driver’.\n\nThere is hardly ever such thing as a definitive ‘fastest driver’. That can be a different driver from one day to the next, depending upon what limitations the car is putting on their respective skill sets. Some drivers have a wider skill set than others – Fernando Alonso springs to mind. But sometimes only at the expense of the peak performance.\n\nBut when a super-skilled driver has a car which rewards his skillset fully, we can invariably see very special things from them and it is this which generally forms the perceptions. Max Verstappen is one such, Lewis Hamilton has been another, Charles Leclerc can do very special things with a car just as he likes it.""\n\nThis bit is so interesting.\n\nSo a potentially good way to ""rank"" drivers would be to see who can have the highest ceiling of performance in a range of car limitations.', ""This is a really great article. As always Mark is one of the few writers who can explain how a driver like Lewis can find lap time, and link that to why the current cars don't work for him. \n\nThe section about the medical tests for reaction time is fascinating. You only have to look at Alonso's performance to see that age won't be a factor for Lewis."", ""I always felt the mark of a great driver is their adaptability.\n\nHamilton has driven in F1 since 2007? That's 18 years by now of competition, regulation changes and team changes and he has been mighty competitive in almost all those years\n\nPerhaps his relative decline is really more a function of age and/or motivation since 2021.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).
