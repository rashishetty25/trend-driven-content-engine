1ha3cii,The statistic about Pierre Gasly finishing the season with no crash damage cost isn't quite right...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ha3cii/the_statistic_about_pierre_gasly_finishing_the/,2024-12-09, Featured,"Thought it was a bit strange that a [post on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h9ku0x/pierre_gasly_finishes_with_no_crash_damage_cost/) with upward of 20k upvotes, several media outlets. and [F1's official social](https://x.com/f1/status/1859527924946440328) media channels have talked about how Gasly is the only driver to not have cost his team any money in terms of damages, but this is not quite true. Seems like all of these posts go back to this one source on the r/formula1 subreddit, a post talking about the [World Destructors Championship](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gndkl5/world_destructors_championship_after_brazil_20/). But, examining the data points to some omissions and mistakes. To start off:

* Gasly did get[ floor damage in Suzuka](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/gasly-rues-costly-floor-damage-from-ocon-contact-in-f1-japanese-gp/10596991/), when he and Ocon came together on the first restart lap. Ironically enough, F1 themselves have a [interview pen video](https://www.formula1.com/en/video/gasly-damage-from-contact-with-ocon-meant-it-was-game-over-from-lap-1.1795661874949227703) of Gasly talking about said damage costing him about >30 points of downforce. We don't know if this floor was completely replaced or just fixed, but this alone makes it so that Gasly did cost his team some money in repairs.

* But if we ignore minor floor damage, Gasly did have a precautionary front wing change in Monaco after his clash with Ocon during lap 1, and there were some repairs ongoing to the front right side of his car. But, as there was no visible damage to the front wing or the front right side of the car, honestly this one shouldn't count.
* Finally, if we do ignore minor floor damage completely, there is one other driver with no damage sustained through the season: Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton did spin in Austin, but besides gravel rash on the underside of the car, the car itself was completely fine and nothing was replaced. His only other incident was in Austria lap 1 turn 1, when he was ushered wide by Sainz onto the sausage kerb on the exit of turn 1, which resulted in floor damage that cost him about 0.25s/lap. Lewis did say in the post-race interview that he felt that there was a [touch from Sainz on his sidepod](https://www.formula1.com/en/video/hamilton-reveals-he-had-damage-after-lap-1-clash-with-sainz-in-austria.1803300339355415341), but looking at the replays of the onboards, they never came close enough to touch. The original World Destructors Championship post also noted Hamilton got about 320k worth of damage in Austria, 225k worth of floor damage and presumably, 95k worth of sidepod damage (which is not true). The same post also ignored Gasly's floor damage in Japan for some reason.
* Over a full season, Bottas almost came close to then being technically the driver with the least damage with just 125k worth of damage according to the same post, but well, we all saw what happened in Abu Dhabi 2024.

(None of these damage estimates count reliability issues, which I think is completely fair).

I know it doesn't really matter, I mean it's just a random statistic, but feels odd for a post from Reddit to go mainstream and then end up back on Reddit, and for the said random statistic to still be wrong. Feels like journalists should be doing a bit more research before they publish things.

FYI: I could've missed damage for any of the drivers mentioned, so don't take me as gospel.","[""You are perfectly right. Every online F1 media has been taking Reddit's Destructor Championship as gospel. To make the matter worse, they don't even bother to mention the creator or the source.  \nAs its creator said many times, it is a fan created estimation, it lacks many data points and should not be taken for an ironclad statistic.\n\nBut because F1 media is lazy and unprofessional, it goes on and on."", 'Gasly floor was deemed irreparable as far as I remember the team had used spare floor until the upgrades\xa0', 'Good post, hopefully this makes it half as far as the original.

Which drivers have you changed your opinion on after this season? Good, bad or otherwise?

For me

The Mclaren drivers- I expected Oscar to be closer to Lando this year but Lando has proven to be quicker than I thought and Oscar has not made the overall improvement I expected.

Yuki- I expected Yuki and Daniel to be close but Yuki has proven to be a much more rounded driver than I previously thought.

Colapinto- Never really seen or heard much of him,but despite some late crashes he showed some good pace out there this season



","[""Piastri - After last season, I thought he would be a lot closer to Norris but Norris had a consistent pace advantage the entire year. I feel he needs a big improvement next season in order to fight for WDC one day.\n\nHulk - I've always known Hulk is a good driver, but he put in some mighty performances this season once Haas upgraded their car to fight in the midfield.\n\nSainz - This has been his best season in F1 by far. Still lacks that extra something compared to the top tier, but he's still super quick and Williams are lucky to have him.\n\nBearman - I've been following him since F3 and have been a fan, but this season, his F1 races showed he is definitely F1 quality. He outqualified Hulk twice, beating him in Baku as well."", 'Hulk and really all of Haas.  Now that Guenther is gone,  they have really improved so much as a team.  I didn‚Äôt expect that at all.  And without Alpine master class in Brazil,  they had 6th!  \n\nI hope they can keep the momentum with Ocon and Ollie.', ""Yuki really impressed me with his growth on and off the track. Red Bull not giving him the second seat beside Max is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI think I've become a bigger fan of Hulk and KMag after this season. They were both so solid for Haas all season. Hopefully Nico gets a great car with Audi and Kevin carves out a successful career in whatever discipline he chooses next."", ""Leclerc - I did believe he was a very fast driver, but he stepped up quite a bit, especially with his race management. The engineer change seems to have helped him out a lot too. Now I believe he's a champion in waiting.\n\nPiastri - Peaked during the European leg but was disapponting after that. His qualifying is rough to watch compared to Norris. \n\nBottas - Thought he was washed last year when Zhou was close, but he did a better job this year regardless of the standings."", 'Charles Leclerc - he was the ‚Äúfast but inconsistent‚Äù one for me, but this season he‚Äôs proven that he‚Äôs matured to a more rounded driver.', ""Oscar is my second favorite driver but hes been very disappointing this season. Outqualified 20-4 with one of those winnings being in Baku where Lando had to lift. 0 poles to Lando's 8 and made a lot of mistakes in both races and qualifying. He still has time to turn into a championship contender but you would think with the discourse surrounding Lando, Oscar wouldve been closer to Lando"", 'Gasly. I always thought he was overrated in comparison to Ocon but he‚Äôs set himself apart this season', ""Not to pile on but Piastri as well. He hasn't had a horrible season but after 2 long seasons he hasnt really improved his baseline pace compared to lando which is notoriously something you either have or don't. I think next year will be defining for him and if he's still consistently slower, teams won't be looking at him as a potential driver to lead a WDC charge.\n\nLeclerc impressed me a lot with his mentality and cutting out the occasional mistakes from his previous seasons. Also how much he seemed to care about winning the WCC. I don't think many drivers would show such passion or be so devastated to not win it for the team. The combination of speed + a true team player is extremely rare in F1 and very impressive."", ""I thought Piastri would be better.

1h9sq8o,2025 rookies,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h9sq8o/2025_rookies/,2024-12-08, Discussion,"bear with me as i only got into f1/f2 in 2020/2021, but can someone genuinely explain kimi getting a top seat as a rookie? this may sound like hate but im genuinely curious bc you usually see rookies from f2 (like lando, alex, pierre) coming into bottom/midfield teams ‚Äî even the past f2 champions (charles, george, and oscar at the time).

and as you see all of the rookies coming next year (including this year‚Äôs f2 champion), besides kimi, are getting a bottom/midfield team. to be fair ive only really watched kimi in f2 this year bc im pretty sure he skipped f3, but can anyone give any insight into how good kimi is? additionally, i do remember a lot of people being upset that drivers like paul aron, zane maloney, and other reserve drivers weren‚Äôt being considered for seats given their driving experience or current form as an f2 rookie. so my question is, do all the teams see kimi as being on par with max‚Äôs junior career considering he‚Äôs getting a similar treatment or it toto just anxious about possibly losing out on generational talent again? in that same regard, was max only really seen as a ‚Äúmust get‚Äù talent to redbull? if anyone has any insight i would love to hear! 

**side note: but even max started in toro rosso which makes me even more interested in kimi‚Äôs positioning at mercedes so early in his career**","['There‚Äôs no one reason, but rather a combination of several factors:\n\nIf Mercedes could have placed Kimi in a second team (like Max at Toro Rosso or like they did with George at Williams) they probably would have. But Williams is more financially stable these days and sees more value in an established second driver than in getting some cash from Mercedes to fill a seat. \n \nThough Mercedes won‚Äôt admit it publicly, they‚Äôre far enough off the top teams right now that they‚Äôre unlikely to be fighting for anything next year. As that is the case, they have a ‚Äúfree‚Äù year to put Kimi in before the reg changes. \n\nThere is the Max comparison too. Toto wants his own Max. How close Max really was to joining Mercedes we‚Äôll probably never know, but it was close enough for Toto to not want to miss out again. \n\nThere are very few, if any, options for an established driver to fill that seat on a one year or a 1+1 deal. Sainz probably wouldn‚Äôt have signed on for that. Guys like Bottas/KMag probably would. But those guys probably aren‚Äôt moving the needle enough next  year, so you might as well just give Kimi the year.\n\nETA: Re: Max. The ability of Red Bull to put Max in an F1 car immediately was reportedly critical in getting him to the team. Red Bull has the luxury of 4 seats and an entire extra team to mess around with. This is one of the criticisms of allowing RB to have two teams, which is its own discussion.\n\nAnd Mercedes clearly rates him as a generational  talent. As they have little to lose, they roll the dice.', '>""but can someone genuinely explain kimi getting a top seat as a rookie?""\n\nToto wants his very own Max Verstappen. And he wants him now not latter.', ""Mercedes doesn't have a junior team. They've paid teams like Manor, Sauber, and Williams to take their juniors before, but there wasn't a team interested in being their training grounds for Kimi for a year or two. Mercedes wasn't thrilled that they had to leave George in Williams the full three years when they wanted to retrieve him sooner, but Williams only accepted a three year contract, and forced them to see it to the end. So, their options were to not put Antonelli in a seat, or to put them in their seat. We don't know if they had any extra pressure to put Kimi in a seat or lose him to another team, because we don't know contract details.\n\nOther teams wanted Max, but none of the other teams were going to offer a 17 year old an F1 seat, so Max signed with Red Bull."", ""Mercedes happened to have a seat available in the main team at the same time that Antonelli was available. Mercedes are currently in a similar position to where McLaren were when they hired Piastri\n\nHis junior career has been very strong. He won two F4 series as a rookie, followed by winning FRECA the following year also as a rookie, all before turning 18. Then in F2 his team haven't been good but he still convincingly beat his teammate Bearman who was also highly rated and proved capable in F1 on multiple occasions."", ""McLaren hasn't been shy to put rookies in. When they were a great team or when they were a midfield team. Lewis, KMag, Stoffel, Lando, Oscar. Sometimes the car has been great, sometimes not so much. Sometimes the rookie has worked out amazingly, sometimes not so much. Red Bull solved the issue by making a junior team. Other teams like Ferrari and Mercedes- and even some others have tried- have sometimes used other teams as proving grounds via a loan, and sometimes they can't get a contract like that."", 'i\'m sure the current kimi situation wasn\'t toto\'s first preference and he would\'ve much rather had max drive for him while kimi developed in williams for at least a year.\n\nbut james vowles did not want to incubate merc juniors and pursued carlos instead and max simply didn\'t want to join mercedes leading to this snowballing effect. in toto\'s head it\'s probably better to give kimi a shot nonetheless instead of storing him away as a reserve.\n\nof course all of this seems to be heavily hinging on kimi being ""the next verstappen"" which is an insanely tall order.', 'Check out which team Lewis Hamilton debuted in. If the boss believes you are that good, you get a top car in debut!', 'You name Lando but he has only driven for McLaren', ""He's a Mercedes junior. They need someone to replace Lewis and feel it's better to put him right in than try to get him a Williams seat, especially since Vowles seems unwilling to do that. He is a hot commodity and leaving him on the sidelines for too long risks him pulling a Piastri. \n\nPaul Aron probably could've got a seat if he had connections, but he doesn't. By finishing 3rd he's not exactly made himself undeniable to the point teams are knocking down his door.\n\nBortoleto had to leave McLaren for a seat since they've got no openings. Bearman obviously isn't going to Ferrari yet, so he goes to their customer team. Doohan is at the senior Alpine team, they just happen to suck.""]",17,50,0.62,17,386,386,2,1,0.010000000000000009,2

And why?

Mine

1. Verstappen- I think that's clearer after this season
2. Leclerc- Quick and has made gains in racecraft and consistency 
3. Hamilton- It is hard to rank Lewis. He lost to George in qualy but seemed faster in race trim.
4. Russell- Ran Lewis very close during their time as team mates. Has that dog in him that could win a WDC
5. Norris- Quick but lacks some intangibles at present
6. Sainz- Well rounded. I think he's in the same tier as some above but less potential
7. Alonso- At the backend of his career but still very good.
8. Piastri- It feels harsh but right now I think he's a tier below the top 6
9. Hulk- Would do a job in a top team. Good qualifier
10. Gasly- Impressive midfield driver, looked very good at the end of the season
11. Ocon- Not much to separate between him and Gasly
12. Bottas- I really don't know how good Bottas still is because his car was terrible 
13. Tsunoda- Has shown growth this season
14. Albon- Some stellar drives but Colapinto might have shown his true level?
15. K mag-
16. Perez- Terrible season. Not sure how washed he is though
17. Stroll- Shouldn‚Äôt be on the grid but he isn't a disaster. Capable of a good drive on occasion.
18. Zhou- Hard to rank given this  years car


Colapinto and Lawson have a small sample size to judge so I didn't include them. But I would rank then in and around 15th based on what we have seen. Ricciardo in a similar position ","['Checo 1st, he is responsible for giving us some extremely unique stats', 'Mostly agree but a few small changes\n1. Max. No real question here. Probably the most complete driver I have ever seen.\n2. Charles. WDC material with newly found consistency and ruthlessness.\n3. Lando. Leveled up this year and can be dominant situationally. Some mental question marks but no doubting the pace.\n4. George. Another level up this year. Seems to be able to manage tires better. Still a bit error prone but is ready to lead Mercedes\n5. Carlos. Tragedy he lost his place at a front runner. Nearly as fast as Charles and still one of the most cerebral drivers. Little less consistent but still very good. Red Bull will regret not signing him.\n6. Lewis. The pace has started to fall off and errors are more numerous but can still pull out the old GOAT occasionally.\n7. Oscar. Amazing progress in year 2 to solve his tire management issues. Quali h2h vs lando is misleading because the average gap between them was among the closest on the grid. Needs a bit more consistency and better overtaking skills to challenge Lando next year.\n8. Fernando. If he was in a top 4 car, he would have won races. Still one of the best but some signs of errors creeping in.\n9. Gasly. One of his best seasons ever. Hope it‚Äôs enough for tempt another shot at a winning team.\n10. Hulk. Amazing pace and consistency. Still got it.\n11. Yuki. Fast and consistent. Still some errors and hot flashes. Deserves the Red Bull promotion over Liam.\n12. Alex. Got a bit found out once Sargent wasn‚Äôt in the picture. Needs to be competitive to Sainz next season.\n13. Ocon. Very inconsistent but could have been his situation. Brazil suggests good upside next season.\n14. Liam. Consistent but lacks pace vs Yuki and overdrives the car. Could struggle at Red Bull.\n15. KMag. Flashes of pace but no consistency and some poor racecraft.\n16. Bottas. Was so far back the only benchmark was zhou who he was consistently faster than.\n17. Franco. Has pace but overdrives the car and made repeated errors. Much better than Sargent tho.\n18. Checo. Just not fast, consistent or adaptable enough for this era of car. Still mega on a handful of street circuits.\n19. Stroll. Bit better this season but still wouldn‚Äôt be there if it wasn‚Äôt for his dad.\n20. Zhou.

1h9j4kj,Penalties,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h9j4kj/penalties/,2024-12-08, Discussion,"Hey everyone. I'm just curious to see if I'm the only person who thinks F1 penalties have gotten ridiculous. I get that sometimes they are warranted but when there is a racing incident in the 1st corner on the opening lap of the race and absolutely nothing flagrant, there's no need for a penalty. Contact happens, it is racing after all. I guess being a Nascar fan I expect drivers to always race hard and not have to ""be careful"" around others competing for a manufacturer championship...that kind of careful driving, in my opinion, should only apply when one is being lapped. If they're racing for position...well...they should be allowed to actually race! I guess that aligns nicely with F1's extreme pretentiousness....","['Crofty and Brundle said that the penalties have been harsher recently because the drivers asked for it, specifically when it comes to running into other cars', '5 second penalties were largely irrelevant last season so they discouraged nothing.  10 second penalties are appropriate IMO.', ""> Contact happens, it is racing after all.\n\nCorrect, which is why racing incidents are not penalized.\n\nPenalties exist to *encourage* people to race and not endanger lives and bomb into people like it's a Forza lobby"", '""Rubbing is racing"" is a closed wheel thing, not open wheel, and especially not F1. You don\'t see the indycars touch on ovals like the stock cars do, people could die.', '>""being a NASCAR fan""\n\nSo, I do mean this respectfully, but NASCAR is far more about the entertainment aspect than F1 is. And by ""entertainment"" I mean ""people watch NASCAR because of the wrecks, so NASCAR looks the other way on wrecking.""\n\nAs much as we all love Days of Thunder, rubbing *ain\'t* racing in this world. Open wheel cars are a lot more sensitive to contact than cars with fenders are. Most of the time, wheel to wheel contact means someone is going airborne, so stewards penalize dangerous driving a lot more harshly than series with closed wheels. \n\nImo, if drivers don\'t want a penalty, don\'t do moves that require a wreck to happen for the move to be completed. The move that Max did in the first turn *is* considered a flagrant move in bad taste in this world, and it *absolutely* needed a penalty. F1 may either just not be for you, or you may need to adjust what you consider racing to be. Contact ain\'t acceptable in this series, though.', ""There's a racing incident but then there's that move."", 'You make a mistake = you get penalised. Max made a mistake, so it‚Äôs a penalty. I just think there should be more variety. There is no way Max should get the same penalty as Oscar', 'It‚Äôs fun to see the drivers actually race, it‚Äôs not fun to watch divebombs where either both cars are out or one has ti back out every time to avoid it. Look at Leclerc vs Verstappen, theres been a lot of great racing within the rules. Or Leclerc and Sainz the last few races.\n\nVerstappen is a great driver, and has a lot of great racing against others, but at times he makes the sport less entertaining when he goes over the line, when other drivers can‚Äôt pass him because he will just take them out', 'Sounds like F1 isn‚Äôt for you sadly‚Ä¶', ""1st lap incidents are usually ignored because there is so much traffic that avoiding contact is really difficult, not really the case here. Max sent it into a gap that didn't exist and went into the side of another car, it's a slam dunk penalty.
