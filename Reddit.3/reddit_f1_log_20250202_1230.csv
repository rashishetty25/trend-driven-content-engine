Similar ‘struggles’ you can be sure will be taking place at Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull to greater or lesser degrees. \n>\n>...\n>\n> So Watanabe’s comments will for certain have generated headlines suggesting that Honda is deep in trouble with the programme, maybe even manifesting the ghost of the company’s initially disastrous hybrid motor of 2015 and perhaps how this is potentially awful news for Aston Martin’s future prospects with its ’26 Adrian Newey wonder car potentially stymied by a feeble motor.\n> \n> Forget it all.
