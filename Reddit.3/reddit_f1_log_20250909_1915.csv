1nc0kxo,Built an open source play-by-play app — Timestamped for F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nc0kxo/built_an_open_source_playbyplay_app_timestamped/,2025-09-08, Technical,"There are a lot of cool projects involving telemetry and other stats, but I haven't seen anything so far that actually documents everything that happens during the F1 weekend, apart from Wikipedia or certain blogs (which aren't all that comprehensive).

Over the past few months, I've been working on and overengineering an app inspired by NHL/NBA's play-by-play features, where you can view an F1 session's events in chronological order. Each event has a description and certain tags like driver number, tyre compound, position, etc. Right now the app is pretty barebones and unpolished (frontend is not my passion), but at some point in the future I'd like to add features including:

* searching for events by tags
* context for events (a circuit view of driver locations at the time of the event, driver positions)

and more depending on what the community might find useful (if it can be done).

There are a few issues/limitations right now with the data such as the occasional duplicate pit stop and drivers being marked as instigators when they are not, but they mostly stem from the raw data and the fact that there are tons of edge cases (for example, race control messages are always formatted so that the driver responsible for an incident is listed first, but there are cases where no driver is really responsible such as failing to follow the minimum delta time).

Big shoutout to OpenF1 and Multiviewer, as it would have taken months just to figure out how to retrieve data from the F1 livetiming API.

Anyway, the link to the app is [timestampedforf1.jeffreyjpz.com](https://timestampedforf1.jeffreyjpz.com), where data for the 2025 season should be up already. Ideas, fixes, and contributions are welcome either here or in the [repo](https://github.com/JeffreyJPZ/timestamped-for-f1), but since school has started I probably won't have time to go through them for a while.

Hopefully someone finds this useful!

I think the top teams besides McLaren seem to have drivers that are the clear favorite. Russel at Mercedes, Max at Red Bull, Charles in Ferrari. I think you could maybe argue Kimi next year and Hamilton might improve but that’s an interesting if.

Towards the midfield the Williams pair I think are a clear favorite. Albon and Sainz in a battle would be intense. I think it’s clear to say Albon has proved he is good enough to match and beat Carlos, now if in a title battle Albon might fall to pressure more than Carlos? I think that’s a question that still means a fight would go long between the two.

1ncomu6,Thought experiment with Oscar v Lando,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ncomu6/thought_experiment_with_oscar_v_lando/,2025-09-09, Statistics,"After last weekend, I decided to run a little experiment. It turned out to be more eye-opening than I expected, because I thought it would confirm something I already believed—but instead, it showed me something completely different.

With a little help from AI, I used random number generation to adjust Oscar Piastri’s form to reflect how he performed last year.

Looking back at all of his finishes from 2024, his average was 5.1 with a standard deviation of 3.0. So the idea was to simulate his current season as if he hadn’t improved, using last year’s stats as the baseline. I thought this would create a model where Lando was clearly McLaren’s number one driver.

My assumption going in was that, if Oscar wasn’t consistently near the front, Max Verstappen would be seriously challenging Lando and might be ahead. 

Here’s how I set it up: I left all other drivers’ positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spots based on that statistical profile, promoting the drivers ahead of him. For example, in my model he finished third at Spa instead of winning. There were a few other adjustments like that, but he still only finished outside the points once and even got two wins, which felt realistic.

What I actually ended up with was Lando leading Max by about 70 points. Behind them, there’s roughly a 60-point gap to George Russell, followed by Charles and Oscar close together, about 50 points ahead of Lewis, with Kimi and Alex another 50 points back.

So what I learned is this: Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar’s form stayed at last year’s level.

I’m Australian, so of course I’d love to see Oscar win the whole thing, but I’ll happily say this: Lando is fantastic this year. And unsurprisingly, even in this model, McLaren is running away with the Constructors’ Championship.","['There’s a reason people get degrees in statistics and other fields. \n\nWhat you’ve done is throw darts in the dark to draw a conclusion with no objective meaning. \n\nJust saying “AI” doesn’t make something meaningful or correct.\n\nOf course Lando has been good.

I also wanted to have a distributive set of numbers with the correct standard deviation, but with enough randomization so it didn’t feel like I was putting my thumb on the scale in any particular place.\n\nFor example, I wanted to maybe explore the butterfly effect of us not finishing near the front row because in Austria the McLarens basically held up traffic at turn three and everybody except Kimi got the memo, this took him and Max out of the race making Max‘s campaign much harder.  I ended up deciding against that because who can predict things that happen in races all the time so while Austria might not have happened, maybe another event happened instead.\n\nI should do another experiment to see if Max had a teammate as good as Oscar last year if Red Bull would be doing any better in the constructors championship.', 'What if Charles Leclerc were Moçambican rather than Monegasque?
