Is he a very good driver who deserves to be in a top team? Of course. 

But these people are acting like Ferrari didn‚Äôt appreciate him at all and just fired him for the first guy that wanted to drive for them. It‚Äôs Lewis Hamilton. I think Lewis and Max are the only 2 drivers on the grid that can get any team to fire one of their drivers immediately in order to sign them. 

I get that Carlos felt betrayed because he was supposed to renew his contract but the only reason he was ‚Äúfired out of nowhere‚Äù is because Lewis made one of the biggest moves in the sport‚Äôs history. 

For Carlos to be a Ferrari driver for 4 years and have such good moments and wins with them is incredible and no one in Ferrari had any doubts that he‚Äôs been amazing at that team. 

They all love him, they never made him feel like a second driver, they always let him race Charles and were happy for him when he won races, in his last year they gave him the same upgrades as Charles and never prioritized one of them, they let him test with Williams in Abu Dhabi, they gave him one of the best send offs I‚Äôve seen, even tomorrow he‚Äôs going to Fiorano and both him and his dad are gonna do a final lap in the F1-75 around the factory.

I really hope Williams builds him a decent car for 2026, I think the partnership between them both will be special. Even James Vowles said that the team went crazy when they found out Carlos would be joining him. He‚Äôs a very likeable person, and easily one of the most likeable on the grid.

The choice of Horner and Marko has already been made and it would be to bet on Liam Lawson, but the board of the Austrian brand (also at the request of Honda) did not want to rush the decision in the Monday after Abu Dhabi, wanting to wait for the test that Yuki Tsunoda has carried out in the Emirates on the Red Bull RB20. As confirmed by Helmut Marko, a final decision will be made in these very hours but the New Zealand driver would seem to be the clear favourite, with the Japanese driver consequently confirmed in Racing Bulls.

He has only had 11 races in Formula 1, scoring 6 points. In 2023 he had the upper hand over Tsunoda beating him 4-1 in the races (but that also includes a Tsunoda DNS and a retirement). However in 2024, Tsunoda beat Lawson 4-2. Lawson is a decent driver but he hasn't shown that he's a generational talent ready for the demands of being Verstappen's teammate.

Red Bull would be foolish to waste such a talent and undermine their academy programme just to keep an underperforming Perez in the Red Bull.\n\nGoing with a Verstappen-Tsunoda Red Bull line up with Lawson-Hadjar at VCARB makes the most sense. Verstappen is going to need an established, experienced teammate to support him if the field is going to be competitive in 2025. Tsunoda fits that bill more than Lawson and Perez is too unreliable. Tsunoda moving to Red Bull gives Lawson and Hadjar a full season to develop.

1hfkn9i,2024 World Championship Standings using the previously proposed points down to 12th place system,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hfkn9i/2024_world_championship_standings_using_the/,2024-12-16, Statistics,"So this year there was a F1 points system change proposal for 2025 that was rejected as it was voted against by all teams in the F1 Comission meeting this past July. This proposed points sytem would have extended points down to 12th place finish, with no alteration to the sprint format. The changes would alter the points given from 8th place down, with the new proposal to also give points to 11th and 12th that would see a 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 breakdown.

Now, in theory, I'm also a defender of the current breakdown of points that only rewards the top 10. With that said, given the new entry of the 11th team (Cadillac) now approved for 2026 and with the prospect of a potential 12th entry in the coming 3 to 5 years, and with reliability being better then in previous decades (yes, we don't know how reliable the cars will be in 26' yet, so this might change), I think revisiting this idea again soon could be in the cards.

So, here are the alternative Drivers and Constructors standings for 2024 using this system: 

https://preview.redd.it/gsvncpck387e1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=05921731dca5a702ee7334ef5c7beb7d4bd403c1

As you can see, this system mainly changes things in a significant way in the midfield, with the drivers/constructors at the top and at the bottom not benefitting as much (I know this is obvious, but just thought I'd mention it). For instance, Max would score the exact same amount of points, as he didn't finish a single time in the 8th to 12th range, and most other drivers in the top positions wouldn't add many points to their tally either.

Some of the biggest gainers for this season would be H√ºlkenberg (+27 points), Alonso (+21), Magnussen & Gasly (+15), Albon (+14) and Tsunoda (+13). Also Bottas and Sargeant would have scored points! (Bottas for P11 in Lusail, Sargeant got a P11 in Silverstone). These results would also put Haas above Alpine in the WCC.

So, do you guys think there is any merit to this points system? Or do you prefer the system in place currently (fastest laps points will stop being awarded from 2025 onwards as a side note)? ","[""It's interesting to think about how Alpine vs Haas shook out in the constructors this year. Haas was way more consistent throughout the year, but Alpine was more volatile and had a couple of very high finishes that put them over the top. Hard to say which should be rewarded more, but it's something worth thinking about."", ""If the goal is to actually assess which driver/teams had the better season, obvs the further down you score the better. I don't know if that is the goal though or if the priority should be creating more unique/sacred moments by making points more exclusionary."", 'Give points to halve the cars: 10x points for 20 cars, 11x points for 22 cars, 12x points for 24 cars, etc.', ""I support the most complete system.

NASCAR does it right awarding points all the way down."", ""I think especially since there's about to be 2 more cars on the grid, it makes sense to give out points to 2 more cars."", 'I just can\'t see how not expanding the points range almost all the way down the field isn\'t better for fans?

How does beating almost half the field (i.e. P11) warrant the same reward as finishing last, **or not even finishing at all**? How can that be logical?\n\n*""It means teams can get away with not trying and still reaping a reward""* Ok, well perhaps for a 22-car field we should give out points to P18?

In an interview with auto motor und sport, Flavio Briatore reveals why he came back, how he wants to apply the old success model to Alpine and what he understands by a good management style.

**You decided to make a comeback to Formula 1 at the age of 74. Why return to retirement?**

> Briatore: I was never really away. In the meantime, I was an ambassador for the sport for Stefano Domenicali and worked with him on new races and marketing opportunities. And as Fernando Alonso's manager, I was always in contact with the scene. But I was mainly involved in setting up my restaurant chain. I started from scratch. We are now one of the largest groups in the luxury segment worldwide and employ 1,200 people. It pretty much runs itself by now. There wasn't much left for me to do. My son moved from Monte Carlo to Geneva because he is studying there. It was getting a bit lonely at home and I was bored. And Formula 1 never really lets you go. I admit, I missed it. And then I had a conversation with Luca de Meo. I've known him for ages. I told him that it was sad to see a former world champion team in this state.

**And how did it become a job?**

> Briatore: In the beginning, the idea was to help a little. I wasn't sure because so much has changed in Formula 1. We talked about the last few years of Alpine in a very non-committal way. Losing two drivers like Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri in one summer was a bit of an inability. Fernando wanted to stay because the season before wasn't that bad. We wanted to sign the contract in Canada. Then Laurent Rossi suddenly disappeared. We could no longer contact him. That was the moment when I started talking to Lawrence Stroll from Aston Martin. We even had an offer from Williams. I said to them: get your shop in order first. In the end, we signed with Aston Martin because we couldn't get on with Alpine's management. The faults lay with the management. That's when I said to Luca: if I get full responsibility, I'll do it.

**You became world champion with Benetton during your career and made Renault world champion in the 2000s. Is the situation today comparable to back then?**

> Briatore: It is comparable to 2002. But we are in a better position with Alpine than we were with Renault back then. The team was in total disarray in 2002. Everyone was arguing with everyone else. With Luca, I now have the opportunity to do everything we want to do in the next three to five years. The first step was to get rid of our own engine. That means we're saying goodbye to something that only costs us money but brings us nothing. Mercedes will give us the best engine and the best gearbox in the business in 2026. If you want to win, 80 to 90 per cent of your components have to be the best. You don't need handicaps. In 2002, Renault had a very good engine. It was so good that we were even able to sell it to Red Bull later on. And the gearbox? It can't win you any races, it can only lose you some.

*How do you want to turn Alpine around?**

> Briatore: I have clear and simple management structures. We have appointed Oliver Oakes as team principal because he is young and motivated and has motorsport experience. Running a Formula 1 team is certainly different to being a Formula 2 team principal. But Ollie learns very quickly. He is a great choice.

**Why didn't you want to be team principal yourself?**

> Briatore: Why? I have been for long enough. I want to take care of the big picture and not be at the factory in Enstone every day. I represent our president Luca. I don't need a title to do that. Everyone knows that: I make the decisions. You need a team principal and a technical director to implement them. I have my old Benetton team in mind. There were three or four people running the place. I had less experience back then, but fortunately I had a good technical team around me with Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds. Now we have a good team under our Technical Director David Sanchez, a mix of people from the past and young engineers. We have to build the new Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds from that. In the meantime, everyone can see the light at the end of the tunnel. With the Mercedes engine, we have the basis to win. That is the mission. Not just driving around in circles.

**How do you intend to achieve this?**

> Briatore: You need the right people in the management positions. They can do what they want in their area as long as they deliver results. If not, that's where I come in. I am a democratic dictator. I trust people as long as they return the trust. If they are bad, I change them. Bad people infect everyone who works under them. They then say to themselves: why should I work for someone who is worse than me?

**They say that people make the difference. Adrian Newey was on the market. Why did he go to Aston Martin and not Alpine?**

> Briatore: You'll have to ask him that. Adrian is an artist. We're not ready for someone like him yet. To benefit from him, you have to have the right team around him. Maybe we'll be ready in two or three years. That's why I've never spoken to him seriously.

**Can the solutions that worked in the 2000s still be applied today?**

> Briatore: I think so. Successful models survive the test of time. As a manager, I have to make sure that everyone in the team understands what it's all about. Everyone must always have the goal in mind. The past is part of the present. That's why I had the world champion cars from 1995 and 2006 and all the world championship trophies placed in the entrance hall at Enstone and the previous year's car taken out. On Monday, our people come to the factory, see what this team has achieved and are prepared to work an extra three hours. When success comes, you no longer ask how high your personal commitment is. The difference today is that the teams have become much bigger and spend more money. You have to recognize the good people and let them grow. The size of the teams means that responsibility in the individual areas is spread over several shoulders.

**Isn't it harder to keep 800 people happy instead of 400?**

> Briatore: It all depends on the management staff. That's maybe 20 people. Just like in my restaurants, actually. We have 37 establishments worldwide. The product is different, but the system of creating a good product is the same as in Formula 1. We have to find the best people for all departments, in the technical office and production. The technical director has the task of putting it all together and overseeing the final product. I see a lot of progress here. The mood and motivation are much better today than they were five months ago. You only have to look at the faces of the people in the factory. There is a completely different spirit than when I started. You motivate employees with two things: Money and success.

**How much time do you devote to Formula 1?**

> Briatore: About 60 percent. I will be at Enstone three days a week in the winter. That's enough. I'm not going there to show my face. Something has to come out of it. I meet with our department heads there and find out whether the targets are being met. In the end, I'm only responsible to Luca de Meo. I owe him success. And we are lucky with him. He is a fan of motorsport. He wants to win. Even more so than Louis Schweitzer and Carlos Ghosn, with whom I had dealings in the past.","['This guy should be far away from the sport but the world we live in money talks and criminals walk.

Is the price right and is the system fair?**\n\n> Briatore: The name budget cap sounds very good. The reality is different. If you want to do it right, the driver has to be included in the budget. And also expensive engineers. Adrian Newey is as expensive as a driver. That's a big cost factor. It makes no sense to take him out. So the rich teams will always have an advantage because they can afford the expensive drivers or engineers and don't have to suffer in other areas. If the driver were included, it would be a fair system. Then you can decide: Do I prefer to spend my money on the driver or the car?\n\n**You used to preach efficiency with Renault and criticized when teams had over 500 people. Now we're at 800 to 1,000, what do you think?**\n\n> Briatore: That's completely crazy. Why do we race? To entertain the spectators. The spectator doesn't care how many people work for the teams. The car doesn't look any different to them if 300 instead of 2,000 people are working on it. And if the gearbox was the same for everyone, nobody would notice. People don't care whether it has five or eight gears. It doesn't make the car any faster. It only causes costs. How many cylinders does the engine have? It doesn't matter, the main thing is that it makes noise for the local people. You can't even hear that on the TV. You only notice the engine when it breaks down. Just like it still happens to us. Then everyone talks about the engine. We'd be better off investing our money in the show. We need a battle of the gladiators and not an arms race of components that make no difference.\n\n**Don't think Alpine will lose its identity with a Mercedes engine. The French have always been proud of their products?**\n\n> Briatore: The French want to win. We don't win with our engine. It's as simple as that. If we want to win, we have to give up the areas in which we are not competitive. That's one less problem for us to worry about in the future. Let's focus on the car. McLaren becomes world champion with a Mercedes engine. How many times have you read or heard about McLaren-Mercedes becoming world champions? Never. Haas is Haas and not Haas-Ferrari.\n\n**Can you guarantee that the move to a customer engine is not the first step towards selling the team?**\n\n> Briatore: I don't understand this speculation. Since I joined Renault, the same questions have always been asked. When we won the world championship title in 2005 and 2006, I was asked whether Renault wanted to stay in Formula 1. The truth is: I always got what I needed for the job from Renault. They appreciate that I am careful with their money. I believe in efficiency. That's why I'm now saving money everywhere in the areas that don't make my car faster. I don't think about what I'll be doing in five, ten or 20 years' time. I decide what's important now.\n\n**How long did it take you to figure out where Alpine was and what was needed to get back to winning ways?**\n\n> Briatore: It didn't take a genius to figure out that Alpine was down. When I came on board, the team had two points on the board. What is needed? I think we have a recipe for winning with 30 to 40 percent less money than the others. At Benetton it was 50 percent less. I know this team. That's why I came back. I wouldn't have done it with anyone else.\n\n**Where will Alpine be at the end of the season?**\n\n> Briatore: We have taken a big step forward and improved to the same level as Haas and Toro Rosso. But that was already a step for 2025. It wouldn't have been worth the effort for a few races in 2024. We had actually already ticked off that year. That's why I told the engineers: we'll only bring the upgrade if it will help us next year.\n\n**They wanted Carlos Sainz. He signed with Williams. What went wrong there?**\n\n> Briatore: I spoke to Sainz. He was interesting for us, but only for four years. It makes no sense to take a driver like Carlos for one or two years. Either he believes in our program or he doesn't. I don't need a driver who costs me a lot of money and is looking to go to another team when the opportunity arises.\n\n**You are also interested in Franco Colapinto. Why is that? You already have a young driver in Jack Doohan.**\n\n> Briatore: I'm interested in any driver who is fast. Colapinto surprised everyone. But we have contracts with Gasly, Doohan and Aron for next season. If there was an opportunity to get Colapinto for 2026, you have to think about it. Nevertheless, you always have to be careful when assessing drivers. In this sport, you quickly get hyped up after a good race. Then the price rises and suddenly we're talking about 20 or 30 million dollars. The choice today is much greater than it used to be. Today, there are six to seven promising drivers in Formula 2 and Formula 3. We want to concentrate on the good ones in our academy and no longer run around with a watering can. It will probably come down to three drivers. Aron, Mini and Martins.\n\n**We have five rookies at the start next year. One at Alpine. Has time run out for the veterans?**\n\n> Briatore: It is now time for a generation change. Sainz is a very good driver. But when he was on the market, none of the top teams took him on. They prefer to go for young drivers. Toto Wolff on Antonelli, Christian Horner on Lawson. Young drivers are hungrier than someone who has a wife and two children and 30 or 40 million in the bank. Even Enzo Ferrari said that drivers slow down when they have children. I think the rise of Piastri has made people think. Bearman jumps into a Ferrari overnight and drives a great race. The young drivers are much better trained. And the competitive pressure is higher. In Formula 2, you're in first place today and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton or Rosberg used to win 70 percent of all races. When Schumacher came to us, he still lacked experience. We first sent Fernando to Minardi. Verstappen didn't even have a driver's license when he started at Toro Rosso.\n\n**How long can Fernando Alonso survive in this environment?**\n\n> Briatore: Fernando is the exception. I've been his manager for 22 years. He has money, but no children. And he is still hungry. If he finishes 14th, he wants to be 13th. Someone else his age would do his job by the book if it's only about 14th place. There are now two feelings in my chest. On the one hand, I wish Fernando could get off to another flying start with Adrian Newey at Aston Martin in 2026, but on the other hand, he's racing against Alpine. But still, would a World Championship title as a farewell be a brilliant story?\n\n**Where should Alpine finish next year, where in 2026 and 2027?**\n\n> Briatore: Alpine must always be in the top 6 next year. Maybe a podium every now and then. We have to improve our car to achieve this. That should be possible. Aerodynamically, we have much more leeway than Ferrari or McLaren. In 2026, we want to be on the podium in 50 percent of all races. Then you automatically win one or two races. In 2027, we have to be in a position to compete for the title."", 'And a cheat', '‚ÄúWith Luca, I now have the opportunity to do everything we want to do‚Äù\nTranslation: ‚ÄúI can do what I want and Luca won‚Äôt tell me no‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúWe have appointed Oliver Oakes as team principal because he is young‚Äù\nTranslation: ‚ÄúI can do anything and Oakes won‚Äôt speak up‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúLouis Schweitzer and Carlos Ghosn, with whom I have had dealings with in the past‚Äù \nTranslation: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm corrupt as fuck‚Äù', 'https://preview.redd.it/ag2xv8f9qe7e1.jpeg?width=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edda0fd3d031224c0f3f306151c0b2b15fe73ae4', 'What a thing to say lmao']",174,95,0.84,174,83,83,111,37,0.05999999999999994,111

Following all questions and the fitting answers to it:

**Who will win the 2024 World Drivers Championship?**

What a surprise. Max Verstappen won it and over 94% of the participants guessed it right.

**Who will place 3rd in the WDC?**

As expected by 31.7% Charles Leclerc placed third with a total of 356 points.

¬†**Who will place 7th in the WDC?**

With a calculated season Lewis Hamilton was able to secure the 7th spot in the WDC. 3.9% of all reddit prediction participants expected this outcome. Fun fact: Last season Carlos Sainz was the lucky seventh! Now Lewis is taking over the seat of Carlos.

**Who will place last in the 2024 World Drivers Championship?**

What a battle the fight for last place it was. After Logan Sargeant has scored an 11. Place, it seemed to be pretty certain that Valtteri Bottas or Zhou Guanyu will place last. Until the Qatar GP where Zhou was able to score points and Bottas finished the race on the 11. Place. Therefore Logan Sargeant was last again. Until Alpine decided to let Jack Doohan drive the last race of the season.

He is the last placed driver of the WDC 2024.

¬†

**Will every driver score points in 2024?**

As stated in the answer above, we got three drivers (Bottas, Sargeant and Doohan) who scored a whooping 0 points. Therefore the correct answer was ""No"" and 44% got this one right.

¬†

**Which team will win the 2024 World Constructors Championship?**

Only 0.3% participants predicted correctly that McLaren will win the World Constructors.

¬†

**Which team will finish 3rd in the WCC?**

Even less people expected Red Bull Racing to place third on the WCC. Only 0.25% expected them in that position.

¬†

**Which team will place last in the 2024 World Constructors Championship?\***

As Kick Sauber drove for most of the season with a tractor they were able to secue themselve the last place in the WCC. Therefore they will get the most time in the wind tunnel and 5% of our participants will get a point for guessing this one right.

¬†

**Will every team score points in 2024?**¬†

12% predicted this wrong. All teams DID score points in 2024 as Kick Sauber finally managed to get a Top 10 in Qatar.

¬†

**How many Grands Prix will there be in 2024?**

The longest F1 season was held as expected. All 24 planned Grand Prix were held as ‚Äûonly‚Äú 71% expected this.

¬†

**How many Special Car Liveries (helmets won't count) will be done until the end of the season?**

Ths certainly was the season of special liveries. 18 different special liveries where used during the season. 7.5% guessed this correctly.

¬†

**How many Driver Lineup changes (for 2025) will be confirmed until the last race of 2024?**

Silly season started pretty early. Hamilton to Ferrari, both Sauber driver will leave the team, Ocon to Haas, Sainz to Williams. As both RB and Red Bull Racing are still yet to confirm their full line up, we have 7+ changes in the driver lineup and 14% correct answers.

¬†

**Will Alonso end his career after this season? (Needs to be confirmed before the end of the season)**

No he doesnt. The rookie is still hungry for more and starts a new season as predicted by 96%.

¬†

**Will Red Bull win more than half of all races?**

Only 4.4% predicted this one right and expected Red Bull Racing to dominate once again. In the end they only won 9 of the 24 races.

¬†

**Will any race finish with zero lapped cars?**

In China either the drivers were DNFd (Ricciardo, Tsunado & bottas) or counted on the same lap as the winner. Therefore we didn t have any lapped cars in the end. This was predicted by over 50%.

¬†

**Will any race finish with zero DNFs?**

In the first race of the season we already had no DNFs. 80% predicted this to happen somewhere during the season.

¬†

**Who will have the most DNFs?**¬†

Alexander Albon is has DNFd at six races over the whole season. Only 0.3% predicted him to be the ""King of DNFs"".

¬†

**Who will have the least DNFs?**

Oscar Piastri had no DNFs (and completed every lap) during the season. 0.5% expected him to be the most reliable car/driver combination when it comes down to DNFs.

¬†

**Who will have the first DNF (only counting race and not Training or Quali)?**

As the first race had no DNFs, Pierre Gasly managed to be first retirement in the second race. What a start of the season for 6.3% of the reddit participants as they locked their first points.

¬†

**Will the WDC be clinched before the second to last race of the season?**

94% predicted this correctly. Yes the WDC was decided already in Las Vegas.

¬†

**Will the WCC be clinched before the 21th race of the season?**

In the end the decision for the WCC went right down to the wire. McLaren and Ferrari battled till the last race of the season and 18% are getting points for their prediction.

¬†

**Will a driver have their race result disqualified?**¬†

In Silverstone Russell got disqualified, while H√ºlkenberg was disqualified in Brazil. Over all 45% predicted a disqualification.

¬†

**Will any F1 driver miss a race due to injury?**

As Sainz has missed Saudi-Arabia this was decided already really early in the season. Kevin Magnussen also missed two races late in the season. In the end this was correctly guessed by 40%.

¬†

**Will the leader of the Drivers Championship have more than 205 points after the Spanish Grand Prix? (10th Race)**

Yes. After Spain Verstappen had scored 215 points and was ahead of Lando Norris by 69 points (nice). 70% predicted this one correctly.

¬†

**How many races will finish under Safety Car in 2024?**

2 races (Australia and Azerbaijan) did finish under (Virtual) Safety Car which will still count in that aspect. 29.7% users predicted this correct.

¬†

**Will any driver receive a race ban for accumulating too many penalty points?**¬†

KMAG really delivered in that aspect. He was forced to sit out during the Azerbaijan GP due to having too many penalty points. Therefore 5.3% of all predictions were correct.

¬†

**Select all drivers that will win a race in 2024**

The race winners from 2024 were: Verstappen, Leclerc, Sainz, Hamilton, Russell, Norris and Piastri.

This was predicted by a whooping 0.14%.

¬†

**Select all teams that will win a race in 2024**

Red Bull Racing, Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren won races during that season. 23% were expecting these teams to win at least one race.

¬†

**Will we see a first-time race winner in 2024?**

The correct answer is Yes as both McLaren drivers won their first Grand Prix. Over 50% expected a first-time win from someone.

¬†

**Which driver pairing will have the biggest difference in points? (in percentage; Driver pairings where one driver has 0 points won't count)**

Even though anybody thinks this one must be obvious (looking at you Checo) the fact that we count the difference in percentage instead of points makes this one way closer than expected.

Verstappen 437P vs Perez 152P = 34.782%

Norris 374P vs Piastri 292P = 78.075%

Leclerc 356P vs Sainz 290P = 81.461%

Russell 245P vs Hamilton 223P = 91.020%

Alonso 70P vs Stroll 24P = 34.286%

Gasly 42P vs Ocon/Doohan 23P = 54.762%

Hulkenberg 41P vs Magnussen 16P = 39.024%

Tsunoda 30P vs Ricciardo/Lawson 16P = 53.333%

Albon 12P vs Lawson/Colapinto 5P = 41.667%

Zhou 4P vs Bottas 0P = n/a

Therefore our winner is Stroll / Alonso where Stroll only scored 34.28% of the points which Alonso scored. Perez was able to avoid that title by 0.5% (and Kick Sauber weren t counted as Bottas didn t score at all).

¬†

**Who will score more points in 2024? Perez, Russell, Hamilton, Leclerc, Sainz (Jr.)**

Out of those five, Leclerc was the one who scored the most points. This was predicted by 50%.

¬†

**Who will score more points in 2023? Bottas, Zhou, Tsunoda, Ricciardo, Hulkenberg, Magnussen**

It was Nico Hulkenberg which 0.7% of all the predictions chose.

¬†

**How many races will start behind the safety car?**

No race did start behind safety car. 26% of all predictions expected no race to start behind safety car.

¬†

**Will at least two drivers win their home Grand Prix?**¬†

Leclerc won his home race in Monaco, Hamilton did it in Silverstone. Therefore 35% got this one right.

¬†

**Will any team fully comply with the engine usage limit in 2024?**¬†

Aston Martin and McLaren complied with the full engine usage limit. This was predicted by 63%.

¬†

**Will any driver win 5 straight races?**

3 races in arow (twice) for Max Verstappen were the longest series of wins. Therefore the answer is ‚ÄûNo‚Äú and was correctly predicted by 7.5%.

¬†

**Who will be awarded the most penalty points in 2024?**

The most penalty points in 2024 received the one driver who was excluded of a GP. It s Kevin Magnussen with 12 penalty points. 6% expected Magnussen to receive the most penalty points over the whole season.

¬†

**Will any pair of teammates collide and cause a DNF?**¬†

The first crash that is coming to my mind is the french duo Ocon and Gasly in Monaco. 84.7% expected that any teammates will collide and DNF during the season.

¬†

**Which team will have the fastest pit stop in 2024?**

Here I am in a bit of a tricky situation. Both McLaren and Red Bull were able to do a 1.90 sec stop. Therefore we have a tie which I needed to implement into the spreadsheet. Both answer were correct.","['I loved reading through all these stats. Amazing work!

The firm will invest 400 million euros - over these ten years - in luxury services and exclusive experiences, in addition to the construction, assembly, operation and marketing of these areas.\n\nThe Swiss company Match Hospitality, belonging to the Byrom group, has been selected to economically exploit the Spanish Formula 1 Grand Prix, which will be held in Madrid from 2026, imposing itself against competitors such as Legends and the Atl√©tico de Madrid football club.\n\nThe award of the operation is an important step forward in the organization of the event that, let us remember, will extend until the year 2035. The winning firm will invest 400 million euros in the development of the project and will join forces with IFEMA Madrid to get the most out of the VIP and Hospitality areas.\n\nThe agreement with Match Hospitality contemplates a progressive economic injection during the ten years that the contract lasts. These resources will be focused exclusively on luxury services, such as hospitality programs and VIP tickets, leaving out standard tickets for amateurs.\n\nThe goal is to transform the Spanish Grand Prix into a complete experience, following the model of other high-caliber events such as the Miami Grand Prix or Las Vegas, where the car competition is complemented by musical events and cultural activities that extend for a whole week.\n\nIFEMA Madrid, promoter of the event, led the bidding process with three internationally renowned participants. Legends, a company associated with Real Madrid, and Neptuno VIP Events, linked to Atl√©tico de Madrid, presented solid proposals, but Match Hospitality stood out for its financial capacity and experience in high-level sporting events. The Swiss firm has an impressive record, having managed services in the World Cups of South Africa, Brazil, Russia and Qatar, in addition to Formula 1 and MotoGP events such as the British Grand Prix of both disciplines.\n\nDespite the intensity of the negotiations, the financial and strategic advantages of Match Hospitality tilted the scales. Atl√©tico de Madrid‚Äôs proposal included initiatives such as the total transfer of a parking lot and synergies with its sports city project, while Legends stood out for its experience in projects linked to Real Madrid. However, IFEMA prioritized investment capacity and direct experience in Formula 1 as key factors for its decision.\n\nThis strategy reinforces the commitment of the Community and the City of Madrid to organize an economically sustainable and internationally attractive event. Representatives of IFEMA, who recently visited the paddock of Abu Dhabi during the last event of the season, are already finalizing the details of this ambitious Spanish Grand Prix in Madrid.

1hfsx5s,Favorite moment of the season ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hfsx5s/favorite_moment_of_the_season/,2024-12-16, Discussion,"I‚Äôm reminiscing about the season, and while everyone‚Äôs aware of how good it was, there‚Äôs so many moments that deserve to be appreciated.

Yes there was 7 different 2 time winners, unheard of in recent times.

But besides that there‚Äôs so many amazing things  

Charles won in Monaco, he achieved his childhood dream and made the prince of Monaco cry.

Lewis won in Silverstone after being in such a terrible place with Mercedes.

The two drivers running in first and second in a race were battling aggressively, made contact and the driver in 3rd place (from a completely different team than 1st and 2nd place) won.

George Russel was the first driver in so many years to be disqualified from a win.

The entirety of Sunday in Brazil. 

Kmag actually got a race ban.

There‚Äôs so many moments that i‚Äôm probably missing that were just so insane, but so much stuff happened that lots of them just get lost.

My personal favorite as a Charles fan, was the moment in Monza that I realized‚Ä¶ hang on Charles is going for the win. 

The race started on a high because Lando bottled pole and Charles from 4th got ahead into 2nd. I was already enjoying the Lando lap 1 memes (I don‚Äôt even hate Lando, i just enjoyed the slander)

And then the whole race was me thinking how can Charles take p2 and then kind of accepting and being content with a p3 and a podium in Monza.

And then i realized the size of the gap to Piastri, Charles pace and how many laps were left. Like 30s after i realized the commentators started to see it and talk about it and then the lap after that you could hear the crowds cheers as they realized Charles was racing for the win.

It was so amazing cause I really wasn‚Äôt expecting it. Monaco, once he got pole it was so stressful because he should win it unless things go wrong. All i felt was stress until Charles crossed t he line. But Monza was another experience entirely it was pure excitement.

While Charles win in Monza was a big moment, people forget how exciting the dawning realization was.
