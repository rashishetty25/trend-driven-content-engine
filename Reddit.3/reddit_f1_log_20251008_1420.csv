Mark started talking about how Fernando had accustomed to share a part of his gainings in Renault with the lads that worked on his car. When he attempted to do the same in McLaren, Dave Ryan said they had to give all of the money they received to him, or else mechanics might risk being sacked. This highlighted, in his opinion, a very different mindset between the team and Fernando, which in turn ended up scalating to a very difficult relationship with the team, citing that some of the stuff started with Lewis' camp, while he found him friendly to work with, ""a nice guy, with incredible determination"".

Yes, overtaking possibilities are limited, but not impossible. Races there are rarely processions, but better than that, it's a circuit that actually allows for defensive driving. There's been some great on track battles with cars trying to get ahead of the other after the first few corners, and those battles are so cool to see, especially seeing the cars fighting side by side out of the second corner.

It disappoints me whenever people shrug Hungary off as the track where you can't overtake on, because I never found that to be the case. Not every Hungarian Grand Prix is a classic, but I haven't seen any truly bad ones either, and I've been watching F1 since 2012. Even 2015 saw it host a good race.

As for a popular track that I don't like? It's got to be Spa. From 2012 to now, the only times I enjoyed the Belgian Grand Prix were in 2012, 2019 and 2024. The Belgian Grand Prix in 2013, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2023 and 2025 were amongst the worst races in their respective seasons.

I know it's a good track to drive on, I've done so many times in all of my racing games, but it's simply not a fun track to watch.

But, I'm not going to watch one of my favorite sports keeping rich people finances in mind with how I should treat my sport. Thoughts?","[""Honestly, I think you're feeling this way because some tracks are too hard to pass at, and the internet's being really toxic about the title battle.\n\nWe're coming up on COTA, which is always great, and Vegas has been great, and Sao Paulo, and Abu Dhabi has quietly been much better for racing since the layout change. Qatar... might be boring, and Mexico might be okay, but we've got some great weeks coming up for sure."", 'I have mixed feelings on it\n\nfor one, I enjoy the races as their own events more than I enjoy the championship fight, so having 24 of them in a year is something I vibe with\n\nbut on the other hand, having virtually half the weekends in the year be race weekends does dilltue the value of each race as an event', ""It is too long.\n\n24 race weekends. 72 days of on-track action.\n\nEach grand prix is less important, mathematically, than they were two decades ago with 16/17 rounds. Not even .mentioning sprint races.\n\nThe time commitment as a hardcore fan is higher than it has ever been. And when there are so many choices for sports or other forms of entertainment to follow, it's hard not to find yourself questioning your commitment at times.\n\nIt will never happen, but I would love to see a significant reduction in the calendar. It would make each F1 weekend more exciting, more meaningful and more special."", 'I agree. I would prefer 20 races maximum with fewer long breaks between races. A more concentrated season with one long summer break.', 'I thought 20 races a year was a good amount with season starting mid-March and ending mid-November. And no sprint races and no triple headers.\xa0', ""Personally I have no issue with the season length. It's the gaps between races that irritate me. Just some nonsensical long gaps following by manic periods of activity."", 'I did feel this towards the end of last year when there were tons of sprints close together. The timing of the European races is also kind of unsocial - I’d rather hang out with my friends on a Sunday afternoon! What helped for me is not watching sessions live and catching up when I feel like it. I started Singapore an hour late and watched it on 2x speed and by the time the race ended I was caught up to the live broadcast.', ""I grew up at a time when 17 races was the norm.   \nTechnically, there are 30 races now (24 races plus six sprint races), which is too many.   \nWhile 2021 had 'only' three fewer races, it felt more exciting, thanks to the action on the track and the proper fight for the World Drivers' Championship.   \nWe're not really experiencing this kind of excitement this year, as one team is trying to sanitise the race by implying a false parity between their drivers."", 'you are alone on this one mate , i like to look forward to weekends with a race']",0,30,0.39,0,143,143,0,1,-0.010000000000000009,0
