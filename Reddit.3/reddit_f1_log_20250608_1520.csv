""I even sent him an Instagram DM once. A very long one where I told him all about it. But I didn't get a reply.

So, I worked very closely with a psychologist, a sports psychologist. Almost my entire career, especially in my world champion year. Sometimes I sat with him for up to 2 hours every other day, going through everything that was possible. Visualizing, repeating, meditating, everything. If I were his psychologist, the first thing I would say is, of course, that's wonderful for us. Yes, he makes himself very approachable. He shows his feelings, his doubts. That's great, of course. But for him, I would recommend that he doesn't repeat it over and over again, because in the repetition, at some point you also reinforce it in yourself.""

The suspended member is Maina Muturi who was elected president of the Kenya Motor Sports Federation back in 2023. However in late December last year, a Nairobi court issued temporary orders to suspended Mr Muturi pending the hearing and determination of a case filed by a KMSF director (And former chairman) James Kahumbura who is now acting head.

As far as I'm aware, he is still suspended although he has tried to act as leader since then, signing agreements on behalf of the KMSF that have had to be nullified by the High Court as they were made in defiance of the court order.

The latest news in regards to this I can find state:

\> *""The court has given Muturi seven days to show cause why he should not be committed to civil jail for disobeying court orders. He has also been ordered to appear in court on March 25 to respond to the contempt charges.""*
