How’s that possible when it’s so obvious on the steering wheel? ,"['An then there is German Sky with Ralf Schumacher who thought it was a bump in the track or a engine braking malfuntion until his son David wrote him a quick message telling him its the DRS lol', 'I’m pretty sure Ant mentioned it almost immediately?

I watched Sky for 3 years before switching to F1TV for the last 3.  Sky felt more traditional with sportscaster personalities and typical storylines being the emphasis.  \n\nWith F1TV, I enjoy the more technical discussions they emphasize with Sam, Jolyon, and David… then the addition of the strategist with Ruth.  For FP1 this week, they had a long time former Red Bull crew member and it was fascinating to hear his take on what was going on.  Plus they have all the reserve drivers drop by occasionally.  It just feels much more interesting for my viewing preference. \n\nNeither are the “right one” - just whichever one you enjoy listening to based on how you consume sporting events.  I like to know how the sausage is made, so F1TV is better at scratching that itch.\n\nEdit: corrected a comment about FP1 being this week… not year.', 'How did you go the entire time not acknowledging Ant had his theories about this?', 'So you\'ve got the Sky booth with Crofty in it and a producer. Expert commentator Villeneuve is not there - he is out traipsing around the circuit, which is a good thing; it\'s what they normally do with Brundle during FP2, it\'s a great part of Sky\'s coverage. Davidson is the second expert commentator but he\'s also not in the booth - to save some money he\'s back in the UK, so he\'s not actually there with Crofty.  \n\nWhen they show the onboard replays it\'s clear to me that Doohan doesn\'t switch off DRS by pressing a steering wheel button. I\'m watching wondering why they don\'t acknowledge that, I think ""maybe that\'s not how it works"", so I wait for the replay looking down the straight so we can see whether the DRS was open or not. \n\nF1 shows this replay once during the session, and it\'s while they are crossing to Villeneuve out on the track - so the replay is shown in a little thumbnail on the Sky feed; it\'s not seen by Villeneuve, and it\'s missed by Crofty. Kind of a perfect storm. \n\nThe weird part of this is that the producers or Davidson don\'t take another look at that replay to see what we all see. Particularly during all the red flag periods that come during the session. Davidson is awesome, but he and the producers definitely missed this.', 'It’s weird because Davidson suggested it was the cause at 51:50 and almost prophetically spoke of it toward the end of FP1', 'I watch F1TV exclusively and it drives me crazy whenever I have to listen to Crofty and whoever else is on that side.

Their simulator and windtunnel don't correlate with what they are seeing on track. So the problems from last season are still the problems this season."", 'Translation and full article:\n\n> McLaren continued its upward trend on Friday\'s practice session at Suzuka. The papaya-shaped racers once again set the pace. Their biggest rival is Mercedes. Red Bull, on the other hand, continues to struggle with its car. We\'ve compiled the key findings in our analysis.\n\n> Four red flags in the second practice session cost the teams 38 minutes of track time. The long runs also fell victim to the interruptions. And on the fast laps between accidents and grass fires, much depended on how the drivers navigated traffic and completed their preparation laps.\n\n> The picture is somewhat distorted. The morning\'s long runs had to compensate for the missed race simulations in the afternoon. The picture is relatively clear here. McLaren is also setting the tone in Suzuka. Mercedes and Ferrari are following. Red Bull is still in deep trouble. The white-painted cars were completely out of balance.\n\n> Neither the base setup, for which the engineers had high hopes, nor the setup adjustments made in the afternoon worked. However, the sister cars from Toro Rosso once again showed strong early form. This is still impressive considering that Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson had increased their engine power for their fast laps.\n\n> Although Nico Hülkenberg had the best long run on paper on the medium tires, the Sauber driver was running on less fuel than the top teams and only completed four laps. ""The car felt decent, was better in the second practice session than in the first,"" Hülkenberg reflected. Both Sauber cars were equipped with the new underbody and rear wings in the afternoon.\n\n> **Is McLaren superior again?** Both fastest times on Friday went to a McLaren driver. In the first session, Lando Norris had the edge. His lead over George Russell was 0.163 seconds. In the afternoon, teammate Oscar Piastri set the pace. The Australian beat Norris by 0.049 seconds and Isack Hadjar by 0.404 seconds. The internal duel between the McLaren drivers was decided in the chicane. Whoever made the cleanest passage there had the fastest time.\n\n> The Papaya racers\' dominance continued in the long runs. Norris averaged a time of 1:33.361 minutes over seven laps, making him one and a half tenths faster than Russell, who, however, also completed three laps longer. The McLarens again showed remarkable performance in maintaining their lap times almost consistently, while their rivals began to experience noticeable tire degradation as the distance increased.\n\n> **Does Mercedes have a chance of winning?** Mercedes is the second-best team. George Russell felt comfortable right away and maintained his high level throughout the day. Even taking into account Mercedes\' usual early form on green tracks on Friday, Russell is the first challenger to McLaren. This is also underscored by the second-best long run in the first practice session.\n\n> The Englishman calls it a positive day and predicts: ""If everything goes well, we can finish on the front two rows."" Suzuka rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli is still lagging behind. The Italian lost more than a second to his team captain in both practice sessions. This shows that Suzuka is a track that\'s not easy to learn in a flash. Antonelli admitted: ""I didn\'t get the most out of the car in the first sector. George showed what\'s possible.""\n\n> Ferrari was just behind Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton beat his former teammate Russell by 23 thousandths of a second. In the endurance test, however, the Silver Arrows were faster. Russell averaged 1:33.489 minutes over ten laps. Charles Leclerc completed eight laps and achieved an average time of 1:33.566 minutes.\n\n> **How does Tsunoda fare against Verstappen?** In the first practice session, Yuki Tsunoda lost just 0.107 seconds to Max Verstappen. The world champion had to overtake six cars on his fastest lap, which reportedly cost him around three-tenths of a second. In the afternoon, the lap times were not comparable. Verstappen drove on soft tires, while Tsunoda stuck with the medium. Nevertheless, Tsunoda performed significantly better than Liam Lawson or even Sergio Perez last year.\n\n> What is worrying, however, is the overall shape of the Red Bull RB21. The car alternates between understeer and oversteer. Verstappen reported on the radio that it felt as if the car was bending. The Red Bull\'s severe sliding accelerated tire wear.\n\n(1/2)', '>Sporting director Helmut Marko was annoyed: ""Whenever the simulator cheers, the basic setup on the track isn\'t right.

1jrihmw,Ryo Hirakawa,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jrihmw/ryo_hirakawa/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"Alpine reserve driver. Two time WEC champion. I wanted to make this post because when I've mentioned Ryo in the past, many people have thought I was talking about Indonesian former F1 driver Rio Haryanto. 

Ryo had a really admirable FP1 today. I am not placing undue importance on finishing order in free practice, or making a big deal that he finished ahead of Gasly, but for how little time he's had in any F1 car, he did remarkably well. He wasn't afraid to push the car, and clearly Alpine had the faith in him to let him. Too often rookie FP1 sessions just have the rookies all at the back playing extremely safe.

Ryo starting racing at the quite late age of 13, after watching the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton won that day. Ryo saw those F1 cars, and he wanted to race. A year later, he won the 2008 all Japan junior kart championship.

Since then, he's had incredible success in Super GT, WEC, and Super Formula. But he's clearly always had interest in racing in the rest of the world and being part of F1. He stopped racing in Super GT when he got the opportunity to join WEC (and he won WEC hypercar that year, and the next year). When he got the oppotttunity to be an F1 test and reserve driver, he left Super Formula as well, so now he only does WEC amd F1 work. I’d love for him to get even just one F1 race. 

I’m not trying to take Doohan's seat from him. But I am saying that maybe he shouldn’t race this weekend. That was a massive crash. Also, the team has Ryo right there who knows the track really well and was proper quick in FP1. Maybe I’d just love to see a 31 year old man with an F1 dream who is super accomplished in other racing series to get than chance in front of his home crowd.","['I love the appreciation for Ryo, (our) member of Toyota #8. If he also made his Formula 1 debut, the whole Toyota #8 team would have raced in F1', 'Toyota are very silently cooking something up. At first they were pushing Miyata as the then reigning SF champion but since his F2 season was really lackluster they have shifted their focus on Ryo.

No hate to Jack, I think the way everyone's expecting him to be replaced sucks but if he needs to sit one race out for the sake of his health, then that should be the priority, rather than putting him back in and something going wrong"", 'Doohan will race if he is cleared to drive by the doctors at the circuit. In that case Hirakawa as the reserve will take the drive for qualy & race.', 'I think it’s pretty clear to people who watched his previous sessions and series, that he’s plenty capable. Did well in the McLaren, same with the Haas. Then today, he sealed the deal and removed what doubt existed. \n\nHe’s a Toyota driver, I can 100% see him working more closely with Haas in the future to replace Bearman or Ocon, especially if support for Miyata doesn’t pan out.

As to his attitude? “He is a kind-natured person,” Malvern says. “But extremely competitive.”\n\nAnd this part about honesty has always been my opinion on Lando:\n\n>Norris seems to have a strong sense of justice. “He is a very honest person, and works best when people are honest and frank with him too,” his race engineer says. “If he feels strongly about something, he will say it.”\n\nI still think that\'s why he and Max get along.

Most strikingly F1 tempo does not indicate that Max lost all his time in the hairpin. I think the official one is probably more accurate and F1 Tempo is mostly being held back by the poor sampling rate that FastF1 provides (5 Hz).\n\nI also think it shows some care needs to be taken when interpreting the data from FastF1 and visualisations such as F1 Tempo. This can be important since some journalists/media outlets use this data to draw certain conclusions. \n\nExample: [video by The Race](https://youtu.be/q9UrEGSYfpo?si=PPt7u-lABglj_6ON&t=132) (time-stamp 2:12).', 'AFAIK they have access to 4 significant digits after the decimal.

That\'s because publicly available data is sampled at a much less frequent rate compared to what F1 and the teams have available.\n\nOn my own app, I use resampling and interpolation + distance shifting to align the data as best as I can before calculating the delta. On top of that, I also align them by minisectors. Basically, I try to preserve the gaps at ""sector gates"" for the delta. It will never be 1:1 and depending on the quality of the data, there might be some error on braking zones, but I feel like the end result is usually more accurate than what F1Tempo provides, if you compare it across the entire lap.\n\n[You can have a look into mine here](https://i.imgur.com/a8CRtDg.jpeg)', 'Me dumb. Learn me numbers meaning please.', ""Definitely a very interesting topic. I've noticed that the accuracy of the delta from f1tempo varies from session to session.

What I mean is, Verstappen is in blue and he had the faster lap, yet the delta shows his line above Yuki's, whereas on F1tempo Yuki's line is above the blue line meaning that going up the y-axis indicates positive delta time."", ""Sampling cannot be an explanation for a bad delta, it can only be an explanation for missed inputs or inaccurate speed but only at most for 200ms. Their position on track and their relative time will simply be off for a bit but then update to accurate within 200ms at most because 5Hz is 5 times a second. This is plenty for an accurate enough delta. There's something else wrong here.\n\nIf anything, I wonder if the official one is wrong. Look at the speed graphs. How is it possible for Max to lose so much delta in that hairpin with those speed graphs? He enters the corner a bit slower, but has a higher minimum speed and exits it the same as Yuki. It doesn't make sense that he lost a tenth there.""]",113,24,0.92,113,129,129,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0

And they achieved exactly what Mercedes wanted in handing them dominance, allowing their marketing department to talk about hybrid efficiency, and eliminating the chances of non-manufacturer F1 teams like Red Bull, McLaren, Lotus etc of being competitive like they were in the previous seasons due to the wild complexity of the new engines and the difficulty for a customer team in integrating them as efficiently as a works team.\n\nIt came to the massive detriment of the sport of course, with spiralling costs that put some teams out of business and cars that were slower than GP2 at some races, and vastly slower than the cars that preceded them. To save the embarassment of the incredibly slow cars they introduced wider tyres and bigger cars with much more aero in 2016 to cover up the inadequacies of the power unit. This clawed the laptime back but left us with the barges we have today that barely fit around tracks like Monaco.\n\nSo after a few years of zero competition, the engines did finally start to reach parity and all the teams were getting to grips with them, and we got new chassis rules in 2022 designed to improve the racing, which have worked reasonably well and given us the closest, most competitive racing we've had in years. This has led to upstarts like McLaren and Red Bull getting back in the mix again. So of course we've ended up with 2026 rules being announced shortly after this formula was introduced, designed to give engine manufacturers everything they want again with a complete disregard for the other teams.\n\nAll the data that people have been discussing has shown the plans for the new engines will result in much slower cars, and once again like 2016 they're looking for ways to enhance the aerodynamics to cover up the inadequacy of the power units, this time with moveable aero.\n\nI see the idea of switching back to V10s as a plan to ensure F1 remains a sport and not just a completely uncompetitive marketing exercise for car manufacturers, like it was from 2014 to 2020. It would result in cars that are cheaper to build, smaller, more nimble, more lightweight, and naturally faster.  \n  \nOf course the manufacturers are not going to support this. It's no surprise that the only manufacturers showing support for a return to more sensible engines are Ferrari, for whom racing is in their DNA, and Red Bull, who are only there to race and were effectively forced to become a manufacturer to survive the upcoming rules.\n\nMBS has faced a ton of criticism, a lot of it tinged with racism I find more than any real substantive criticism, but I do feel like he's consistently been doing his bit to push back against supremacy for car manufacturers and ensuring that F1 is a proper sport and not just a marketing exercise for car makers, from moves like this to his attempts to get Andretti on the grid."", ""I'm genuinely shocked by this tbh. All this talk about Road Relevancy in regards to other parts of the powertrain and then dumping a big ol' V10 in the back is very confusing. \n\nMaybe they're planning to up the electric output as well? 60% Electric and 40% ICE with the V10 kinda there for show?

1jrc6te,Will there be a different standard of success for Yuki?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jrc6te/will_there_be_a_different_standard_of_success_for/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"We finally have some track time for Yuki in the Bull, and he’s definitely looking promising. This makes me wonder if there might be a different standard for success for Yuki this season? He clearly was not a favorite of team management in the way he has been looked over for the second seat. It was only due to extraordinary circumstances that he now has a drive next to Verstappen (seeming begrudgingly so on behalf of Marko and others / split with Honda, etc). Since the indication was that Yuki would be gone from the Racing Bulls at the end of the season, do you think “just get close to Max” or “just get into Q3” might not be enough to save his drive at the end of the season? I’m a huge Yuki fan and hope he has a long career in whatever drive he wants in F1, but worry I’m setting myself up for disappointment regardless of how close he gets to Max.

Nowadays, it feels like every other race we hear drivers venting about tire degradation, strategy calls, or car performance, either on the radio or in interviews.

Was this level of complaining or criticism always part of the sport, or is it more common now because of how much more media access and radio coverage we have?

1jr6xff,Is it justified if Alpine get rid of Doohan early?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jr6xff/is_it_justified_if_alpine_get_rid_of_doohan_early/,2025-04-04, Discussion,"So going into the season there were a lot of rumours that Alpine would replace Doohan after about five races. And those rumours were fuelled by Alpine signing Colapinto and 3 other reserve drivers. They also never publicly said that Doohan would stay even if he performed well.

Many fans, understandably, were outraged and felt for Jack. He had barely driven an F1 car and there were already rumours that he would be out the door after the flyaway races that kickstart the season. 
His crash this morning have sparked more even discussions about this and I've seen people discussing weather Alpine should replace him. 

So let's go through his season so far and see what we make of it. 

In testing, Doohan performed well enough. He was close enough to Gasly and actually set a faster time on day 2. 

In Australia it actually got off to a decent start and thoigh he went out in Q2 there was a feeling he had the pace to go faster but was impeded by yellow flags after the Hamilton spin. 
So He would start P14, 5 places off Gasly. 

However come race day it was all over in 5 corners after he spun off as they left sector one on the opening lap. Many other drivers did crash that day so you have to give him some forgiveness but I feel as though this video https://youtu.be/d_6DFoHWBC0 shows the difference between a good talent and a great talent. 

In China Alpine seemed hardest hit by the new rear wing directive and Doohan was P16 in SQ1. But he was ahead of Gasly which went a little under the radar but was very impressive. 
 
The sprint itself though, was a bad one for Jack. While Gasly worked his way up to P12, Doohan spent the  whole race battling with the Sauber's before making a silly lunge down the inside on tub last lap and crashing into Bortoleto, spinning him around. For this Doohan got a penalty that didn't change his P20. 

In the main qualifying session he was out in Q1 in P18. To be fair, he was only a tenth off Gasly. 

And for the first time we got to see his comparison to Gasly over a race distance and... it was fairly impressive. On lap 33 he was only a few seconds off Gasly. From then on he was battling with the late stoppers Bearman and Stroll as well as the two stoppers of the Racing Bulls. 

They had much fresher tyres but Doohan fought hard, though he picked up a penalty for forcing Hadjar off. He still held Hadjar off for the remainder of the race but the penalty dropped him a couple of places. But finishing ten seconds off of am experienced midfield driver like Gasly in his first race distance is actually pretty commendable and why I think he should be given a bit longer. 

Yes his crash today was big, and the main argument for replacikg him is that crashes like the ones he's having will cost the team valuable momey they could use for development in this era of the cost cap. 

But if Doohan stops crashing so much and just cuts out the small errors I think he deserves to stay because he does have that raw speed in him. He has outqualified Gasly in one out of three quails and gotten close in the other two. Gasly is one of the stronger qualifiers on the grid and it's no mean feat to be that close. 

Admittedly Australia and China are two of Gasly's worst tracks but if we get to Bahrain and the gap is still small then Doohan deserves the time. Also Doohan isnt that familiar with these tracks either. When we get to more of the circuits he drove in F3 and F2 let's see what he can do. 

In F1 what often seperates rookies is their raw pace. A driver like a young Max Verstappen who is fast but crahses a lot is actually much more impressive than a rookie driver like Sergey Sirotkin, who doenst really crash, but also doenst show any speed. 

I think the reason Jack is crashing is all the pressure Alpine have put him under to perform or get fired. He's pushing the car too much amd crashing due to that. If he continues to have an incident per race yes he should be home by the summer but I think he has shown enough raw pace to be kept on until at least the summer break and if he is very good at the tracks he's more familiar with he should be kept on for 2026. 

TLDR - He's shown enough raw pace to deserve to keep his seat.

But I think he'll get it out of his system: he's a rookie.\n\nThat said, Alpine and Briatore could literally do anything and nobody would be surprised.

The only reason Gasly is not ahead by more is probably cause the Alpine is just not very good."", 'The difference is that Gasly has already proven he can be fast, get points and podiums.
