1m1863b,"Toyota: Strong synergy with Haas, signs of growing interest in F1?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m1863b/toyota_strong_synergy_with_haas_signs_of_growing/,2025-07-16, News,,"[""I think it has been quite obvious for the last 2 years that they've started the long term Haas takeover.\n\nBig sponsor on the rear wing, glorious spawn of multiple Japanese drivers to drive in TPC tests and demos, what else do we need? Just lacking an official announcement, tbh."", 'Translation:\n\nUntil last season, the idea of organizing a test during the championship had always been considered ""too much"" for the small Haas. Significant expenses, difficult to sustain for a team that only finished 12 points in the 2023 constructors\' championship. Then came the rebirth. Today, the American team ‚Äì which nevertheless had to abandon its NASCAR program last year ‚Äì has already collected 29 championship points but, above all, continues its important partnership with Toyota . And it is precisely thanks to the bond with the Japanese manufacturer that the team founded by Gene Haas will be driving at Fuji on August 6-7 as part of a new TPC test .\n\nTHE DRIVERS ON THE TRACK AND TOYOTA\'S INFLUENCE: HERE\'S WHO WILL BE THERE\n\nThe star of the show on the track ‚Äì as per the regulations ‚Äì will be the 2023 single-seater, the VF-23, which will be entrusted to reserve driver Ryo Hirakawa and reigning Super Formula and Super GT championship champion Sho Tsuboi , making his debut at the wheel of an F1 car. The choice of two Japanese drivers mirrors that made in the January tests at Jerez and the tests organized in June at Paul Ricard, with Ritomo Miyata and Kamui Kobayashi, respectively, taking the lead. In this sense, Toyota\'s influence in the choice of the drivers involved is evident , with the Japanese manufacturer having never hidden its desire to help the Japanese drivers gain greater experience in Formula One.\n\nTHE RETURN TO FUJI AND TOYOTA\'S GOALS:\n\nTo celebrate the return of Formula One to Fuji Speedway ‚Äì a venue first visited in 2008 ‚Äì Toyota, the facility\'s owner, has chosen to allow public access to the two-day test, also providing its own technicians on the track. Masaya Kaji, Director of TGR Global Motorsport , explained that the technical partnership between Haas and Toyota is based on improving three pillars: "" people, operations, and product ."" "" In this sense ,"" Kaji added, "" these TPC tests are part of our people efforts , as we will focus on human resource development. I believe that Sho [Tsuboi], a former Super Formula champion, will not only contribute to the development of his skills, but will also provide great motivation for the other TGR drivers. In addition, mechanics and engineers from Toyota Motor Corporation will be present, making this an invaluable opportunity for them as well . Experiencing first-hand the technologies and skills required on the world\'s highest stage, F1, will certainly be an important experience for their growth .""\n\nA test, therefore, that sees a strong commitment from Toyota, which is in some way returning ""actively"" to the world of F1. And who knows, it could also be a preparation for the future. The Japanese group is still involved in the WEC world, but for months there have been rumors and hypotheses of a possible farewell to the world of endurance , at least temporarily, pending new regulations or a more ambitious project that would revolutionize the current car, which is now rather dated. And it is not out of the question that Toyota is considering a return to the world of F1 as well. At the moment there is no confirmation , but behind the scenes things are moving between the WEC and other commitments that suggest some movement is afoot, but we will have to see what it will lead to. In the meantime, however, in what would be a simple partnership, we see a rather active commitment from Toyota , in terms of drivers, engineers and more.\n\nRecently in the Austrian paddock, Andrea De Zordo, Haas Technical Director, spoke about another important contribution the Japanese manufacturer will have for Haas. ‚Äú The relationship with Toyota currently focuses mainly on TPC testing and the development of our own simulator . We don\'t have one at the moment, and it will be important for us in preparing for the races. Arriving with good preparation on the simulator would allow us to start the weekends better and get better use of the driver.‚Äù According to the Italian engineer, one of the reasons Haas is lagging behind the others is the delay in arriving on track. ‚Äú By starting the weekend better, the driver is freer to focus on building confidence or working on balance details. And the same goes for updates. Having a simulator where we can work would be a great thing for Haas .‚Äù An advantage that De Zordo defines as even more significant with a view to 2026 and the next-generation cars.\n\nA positive and stimulating collaboration, which Haas Team Principal Ayao Komatsu also spoke about. ‚Äú I am very excited that in our first season running a TPC program, we will be able to run for two days at Fuji Speedway in Japan ,‚Äù Komatsu explained. ‚Äú The importance of racing our car at Toyota‚Äôs home circuit, where we first announced our partnership with Toyota Gazoo Racing last October, is truly special . ‚Äù Looking back at the test\'s protagonists, the team principal explained: ‚Äú Giving Sho Tsuboi his first time in a Formula 1 car is equally satisfying , considering his reputation as a multiple champion. We obviously already know Ryo\'s talent and we look forward to him continuing to make his contribution to our program. The fact that we will be using the VF-23 and that the test is open to fans is also great . We know the passion Japanese fans have for Formula 1, so to have a second test in the country this year, after the Japanese Grand Prix in April, is fantastic.‚Äù', 'I kinda like the current arrangement Haas has (ha) where they essentially have both Toyota and Ferrari co-parenting.', 'Toyota added to the growing pool of engine suppliers would be great, but I do question when enough is enough.', 'If their partnership with Haas really is a long term project to get back into F1, I\'m not surprised that Toyota is only dipping their toes into the F1 pool for now.
