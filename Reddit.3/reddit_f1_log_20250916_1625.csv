1ni0tr7,With the new engine requirements in 2026…does Cadillac actually have a chance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ni0tr7/with_the_new_engine_requirements_in_2026does/,2025-09-15, Discussion,"I’m very  exited for Cadillac to enter Formula 1. Even more so that they have two excellent drivers.

I thought that they would not really stand a chance. That 2026 would be all about them learning as a team, figuring out car setup and so on.

That’s gonna happen, no doubt. I was thinking though. With all the teams having to adapt to the new engine requirements for 2026…is there a chance that Cadillac could actually make points?

It will be a whole new car and way of racing. What are your thoughts?
","[""cadillac will use ferrari engines, they have the same chance that they would have otherwise\n\nthe chassis regulations are very different but there's still some carry-over from the current cars, they still have a lot of learning ahead of them"", 'They are almost certainly planning on 0 points in 2026. Even if the car is decent, they still have to figure everything out operationally - the global logistics, weekend planning, how to arrange the fucking garage.', 'Absolutely not.', ""They have a chance, but it's a slim one.\n\nThere are two main reasons for that:\n\n1. The team is being set up entirely from scratch. That means zero built-in instiutional knowledge and new facilities, new people and new procedures in every part of their design, testing and manufacturing processes. That's not a guarantee that they do a bad job, but increases the risk of issues quite considerably.\n\n2. If we're realistic about it, what are the chances of a brand new team doing a better job on the chassis and aerodynamics of their car compared to any of the 10 teams who have done it before and crucially have actual working cars running this year?"", 'They will score a handful of points because there will be reliability issues, there are more races and more points on offer (sprints, etc).\n\nThey’re also coming in with what looks like good prep and a useful budget, so should be better than the likes of HRT or Manor.\n\nI’d be expecting for 1-5 points, hoping for a few more.', ""Are people forgetting about Haas' first year? They obviously weren't a top contender but they scored points right away, I can't help but think GM has way more resources and experience in racing than Hass did when they started out. Obviously they're not going to be fighting for race wins right off the hop but I seriously think people are underestimating the commitment and success GM has in racing."", ""I don't know why some people here are saying that Cadillac are aiming for 0 points. First, nobody who enters Formula One as a new team thinks this pessimistically. Cadillac have a lot of ambition and started prepping very early on, despite not being fully approved by all the higher-ups until last Match. Second, Haas seemed like a less ambitious team with less proven drivers before their debut in 2016, compared to how Cadillac is viewed now, but they scored 18 points in their first ever two Grands Prix. Cadillac will undoubtedly be able to achieve such results."", ""I doubt, like you said they're using 2026 to learn and adapt. Sure they have hired people that had experience in other F1 teams, but everything needs to click. In total [Ferrari customers teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_engine_customers%27_Grand_Prix_results) got 7 podiums since 1956 and one win, Sebastian Vettel with Scuderia Toro Rosso in 2008.\n\nSure customers teams in the past often got slower engines than the factory teams (different mapping). I don't think Cadillac will be that successful unless they designed a great chassis."", 'They sure killed their lineup, though.
