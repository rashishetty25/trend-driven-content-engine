During the second safety car, it's very hard to see, but it looks like the lights go out on the safety car right before it goes under the bridge on the Hangar Straight (@54:04).

He rightfully deserved that podium spot, and after 239 races worth, this is one of my most significant reasons as to why I tune into the sport.

First of all Piastri deserved that penalty. There have been a few news articles with more details about the stewards taking a look at his lap 17 restart as well. They didn't interject then, but when Piastri proceeded to do the same again, they just decided that this really wasn't something that they wanted to encourage. I can understand why. Now the real question is, where is the limit? When is it erratic driving and what exactly is too much? I guess only future races will tell. Hopefully this stops drivers at the front at a restart slamming on the brakes as soon as the safety car lights go out. Nothing wrong with just slowing down more gradually and then weaving around.\n\nSecond let me just praise Sauber. They have done so well. Their upgrades are working. Their team morale seems to be great. Well done to Binotto and Wheatley. I hope that next year they can do well with their first engines with Audi. At least for now it seems that they choose the right people to lead their team. And then Hulkenberg. I'm just so happy for him. Gone is his very much unwanted record! \n\nThe Haas drivers are both very lucky that they got away with their little synchronized spin. That could've ended in a double DNF. \n\nLeclerc had such a messy race. I had to laugh at his little safari tour. Seeing the car just drive straight through the corner over the grass was something else. However water coming into his visor isn't ideal. That might be something to look at in the future. Hamilton had a good race. I really thought he'd get Hulkenberg, but I'm happy he didn't.\n\nStroll also had a good race. I was really skeptical when Aston put on those soft tyres in that first stint before the safety car but the strategy worked out! He put in some quick laps and some good overtakes. Very well done to him. \n\nVerstappen was unlucky with the weather. I'm frankly impressed that he managed to keep the car on the road as well as he did. That car was drifting through the corners lmao. Near the end the little rear wing seemed to benefit him again though, when it dried up the speed of the Red Bull was back. I wonder what would've happened if we didn't have the heavy shower. \n\nNow onto a three week break...

I just have a question for the physics-minded people. How much does the stopping distance vary on a F1 car when applying 60psi of braking pressure in Wet vs Dry conditions?

I see everyone is comparing George's 30 psi (in the dry) to Oscar's 60 psi (in the wet) and saying Oscar 'stopped twice as quick'. From my understanding, this is not accurate. I am under the assumption a better metric that the FIA would use as a baseline or threshold would be to look at the deceleration values?

Obviously Oscar shedding the 100mph was significant, but the timing in which he does so should be mentioned also and used as part of the baseline.

All just my thoughts, I'm interested in what everyone else has to say. Would be fun to have the raw data!","['r/f1technical is probably the better forum if you want better answers than ""he broke 2x as much.""\n\nEspecially considering the FIA in the Russell document didn\'t even comment on the brake pressure argument put forward by mercedes', 'It‚Äôs the effect on the guys behind.\n\nThere was massive spray for the guys behind Piastri - he was essentially the only guy with a clear view.

That\'s kinda the opposite of what you (should) do in a road car.\n\nI can\'t find good data on how much psi F1 brakes do, but apparently it can be up to 2000 psi? So 30 or 60 really is not much, definitely not proper corner braking, more like gentle slowing down like in a road car.\n\nI guess that\'s why the McL people were saying it just looks more dramatic on TV due to how fast the cars are and how the brakes work.\n\nIn that context, Russell\'s 30 psi makes even more sense that he was just warming them up, even if it looked like hard braking to us.\n\nAs for the rain, I\'m not too sure but I\'d guess that\'s the same like in a road car. If you brake too hard, the guy behind you is more likely to ram you even if the overall braking distance is longer, so braking inherently carries more risk. I also imagine F1 drivers are more gentle on the brakes in the rain to keep better control, so maybe even 60 psi is into the ""don\'t do that"" territory in the rain.\n\nBut I\'ve also seen an explanation that the main difference between Russell\'s and Piastri\'s situation was that Russel was still behind an active SC with its lights on, while Piastri was essentially under racing conditions with him controlling the speed, not the SC.

1lt8gv5,Piastri‚Äòs penalty undeserved?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lt8gv5/piastris_penalty_undeserved/,2025-07-06, Discussion,"Edited see below

During the race, it looked quite clear that Piastri just tried to surprise Verstappen to give him a penalty. I just had a look at the telemetry from the live timing, and it paints a different picture. 

During the first safety car, Piastri decelerated from 207 to 65 kph in 3.3 sec (3.3 sec of hard braking). Verstappen went from 219 to 75 kph in 3.5 sec, they started braking at ca. 1/5 of the straight and basically simultaneously. 

During the second SC, Piastri went from 215 to 70 kph in again ca. 3.2 sec, for Verstappen it was 221 to 60 in 3.1 sec, so similar to the first SC. But Piastri started braking at 1/2 of the straight (so quite a bit later), the key here is that Verstappen only started to break 1.5 sec after Piastri. Piastri had already decelerated to 120 kph when Verstappen reacted. 

Looking at Verstappen‚Äòs onboard also gives a bit more additional information. During the acceleration down the straight, there was a lot of spray from Piastri and the safety car, so his visibility was reduced and he received a radio call that the SC is ending. I think both of these factors have contributed to his delayed reaction, which then in turn led to a very high closing speed, which forced him to evade Piastri. That obviously looked quite extreme off-board. 

I think, given that the call for the ending SC came relatively late and then Piastri‚Äôs need to allow the SC to go into the pits and the track to go green before he hits turn 15, gave him cause to decelerate quickly. It is not his fault that Verstappen didn‚Äôt notice him braking for almost 1.5 seconds. Just to be clear, I don‚Äôt think Verstappen is at fault here either, it‚Äôs just that his delayed reaction makes Piastri‚Äòs braking look quite extreme. From Piastri‚Äôs on-board (which faces rear) his braking doesn‚Äôt seem quite so strong and it looks like Verstappen just doesn‚Äôt brake. 

We can also compare this to the Russell incident in Canada. There Russell had no cause to brake (SC not ending or other), they were at lower speeds and Russell only decelerated to ca 85 kph so not as hard braking required (Russel 30 psi vs Piastri 60 psi). Russel did not receive a penalty.

Watching the race I thought the penalty was deserved but now I think Oscar got quite unlucky with it.

Edit: I stand by the conclusions I made due to the data but I agree that he shouldn‚Äôt have braked this hard this suddenly given the conditions. But if race control has an issue with him driving this way they should have reacted the first time he did it during the first SC restart. The way it happened he thought he was in the green to do it again","['Please keep the discussion focused on the (technical) details of the incident itself.\n\nFan wars, whataboutism or hatred targeted at any team, driver or official will result in bans.', ""The braking might have seemed reasonable to OP, but to everyone piled up behind him with low visibility it wasn't. \n\nI thought he stopped on track watching it live."", 'It was reckless given the conditions and very deserved. Even Hulk in the cool down room told him how it impacted him and other drivers.', 'Zero question whether he deserved a penalty. 10 seconds can be argued but no penalty at all would have been bullshit, stupid from him\xa0', ""Piastri wasn't thinking about Verstappen at all.\n\nHe was trying to warm up his brakes and tyres. That's all. He just did it in a way that wasn't reasonable. That's all there's is to it.\n\nIt had nothing to do with Verstappen."", 'The fact that the safety car had been called in makes it way worse, and that is what warrants the penalty imo. That is also the reason why Russel did not get a penalty: it was during normal SC period. Not after it has been called in.\n\nThe rule is clear : \n\n"" When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car the message ‚ÄúSAFETY CAR IN THIS LAP‚Äù will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system and the car‚Äôs orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors and drivers that it \r\nwill be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.\r\nAt this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall \r\nmore than ten (10) car lengths behind it.\r\nIn order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the \r\npoint at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves \r\nno erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other \r\ndrivers or impede the restart.""\n\nPiastri was in breached of it. Russell wasn\'t. \n\nPiastri also did it under the rain, and it was a consequent breach. So they went for the harsher penalty. \n\nI honestly completely understand the logic of the steward. And comparing their decision with the Russell one doesn\'t make much sense as it is not the same rule. One if for normal SC conditions, where people are expected to warm up the tyres, and the other is during the actually restart procedures, when drivers are supposed to be lined up and predictable to get back to racing safely.\n\nLike yes it is unlucky for Piastri, but he should have seen the ""SC in pit this lap"" light on time, and eased off instead of keeping doing it.', ""I don't think he was doing it maliciously. He knew he could get away from Verstappen very quickly. But it was still a stupid mistake.\n\nIf he'd done it maliciously I don't think he would be so angry. It's the most emotion we've seen out of him."", 'The way the rules are today it‚Äôs a penalty, harsh or not. But I think the FIA needs to look at when they call a safety call in this lap and the drivers should be asking for that. Piastri was reacting to a very late call and as such caused the situation. Had they call it before maggots/beckets then this whole incident doesn‚Äôt happen as Oscar can back off in enough time in the ‚Äúacceleration zone‚Äù of the straight. Half way down the straight is too late!', '""In order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the point at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves no erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers or impede the restart""\n\n55.14 of the sporting regulations. Seems pretty cut and dry to me.']",0,269,0.36,0,3015,3015,0,0,0.0,0
