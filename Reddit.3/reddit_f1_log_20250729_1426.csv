1mc5l35,Anyone else surprised by how bad the dirty air has been this year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mc5l35/anyone_else_surprised_by_how_bad_the_dirty_air/,2025-07-29, Discussion,"I remember hearing a while ago that this generation of cars were supposed to have less dirty air than the 2017-2021 generation. It may have been better earlier on (I must admit I didn't follow the 2023 or 2022 seasons that closely), but in 2024, and this year, it seems as if the dirty air is right back up to 2020/2021 levels.

Aside from Silverstone and Austria this year (and Lewis at Spa), cars seem to find it nigh on impossible to overtake, even with DRS zones to help. The Suzuka race in particular was a big example of this. No-one could overtake anyone. Monaco was another example - the Williams drivers slowed by 3 seconds a lap so the other could get a free pit stop, and the dirty air was so bad that even when they were driving 80% speed no-one could slip by (granted, it wasn't helped by the narrow width of the track).

I'm just very surprised the dirty air seems no better than 2020-2021, considering all that I heard about these cars ""improving racing.""

Now they're saying the same thing about the 2026 cars. I wonder how bad the dirty air will actually end up being with those. Will it be any better than the 2025 cars? I hope so. It would make the races more exciting then.","[""another thing is that the cars are generally closer to each other in pace right now compared to years past, so they're less likely to have the performance delta to accomplish an overtake."", '- Cars followed much better in dirty air when they rode lower to the ground.

Even in races like Spa or Suzuka where there is limited overtaking, there are cars across the entire grid that are easily following within a second for multiple laps. It's far off 2022 though.\n\nThe two main issues at the moment are:\n\n\\- The cars are producing so much downforce from the floors that they can run less RW, so the DRS effect is less. This is on top of getting less slipstream than the previous gen cars\n\n\\- The cope with the weight and downforce of the cars, Pirelli have made all the tyres a bit harder for this year. As such, deg is generally very low\n\n\\- Low deg tyres plus cars that are very close in performance means that it's much harder to overtake."", 'It’s nowhere near the 20/21 levels.
