STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.
