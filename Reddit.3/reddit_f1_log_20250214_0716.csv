Almost everyone here is like ""at the gym"" or ""with jeans as a normal t-shirt"" when you\'re asking how to make it fashionable. The truth is 90% of F1 merch is almost impossible to be fashionable because of the abundance of logos and because they\'re not actually cool at all in terms of design, as some soccer jerseys (either modern or vintage) are. If I were you, I would look for merch you really, really like and that could be worn with stylish clothes, though these tend to be special editions or something.
