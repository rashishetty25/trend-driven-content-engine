The SF-25 was unable to live up to the great expectations of the beginning of the year. The car proved to be semi-unknown in the first laps of testing, which made Maranello realize that it had to fight important, totally unexpected limits. Disqualification aside, Miami was the low point for Fred Vassuer's team, with the car that - on a difficult track anyway - competed in the role of fifth force behind the Williams, reaching the finish line almost a minute behind the McLarens. A scenario that was not even imaginable in the most negative expectations of the beginning of the year. The post-GP debrief had many points for reflection and Lewis Hamilton in particular discussed the implementation of some choices on the track. There was not much positive to bring from Florida. Looking at the data, numerically it is as if Ferrari had been a year behind in development ,seeing the average gap suffered by the MCL39. The race for updates is something that might not be enough, which is why, as we already told you exclusively last week , Loic Serra has apparently made the decision to push for changes to the mechanical platform with interventions to the rear suspension.\n\n\nThe mistakes made on the SF-25 originate in the idea behind the concept. The puzzle is ‚Äúsolved‚Äù and the development plan has changed\n\n\nImola is one of the two big home events of the Prancing Horse team, which is why, regardless of the problems, there is great expectation around the team. Ferrari arrives in Imola with simulator work still in progress that sees both Prancing Horse drivers busy in arriving with the best setup, an aspect in which there were several difficulties in Miami. The information we have on the evolution front of the SF-25 allows us to say that the development program has changed substantially . All this since the critical issues of the SF-25 emerged, limited by a rear end that mechanically does not allow it to fully exploit the aerodynamic needs of the surface . The potential that Frederic Vassuer refers to is hidden behind a single-seater that cannot express the real aerodynamic load available, seen only in very few glimpses of this first part of the season.\n\n\nProject 677 changed the entire mechanical platform compared to the SF-24, with a change of layout at the front and a completely updated and extreme rear suspension in concept despite remaining a tie rod.  Someone in the corridors of Ges believes that a mistake was made in the operation of the car . in other words they failed to interpret the aeromechanical platform correctly, remaining faithful to some concepts of the old car despite the radical changes.\n\n\nIn Emilia-Romagna no big package: in 2024 the evolved SF-24 arrived in Imola, today we wait to see (also) what happens with the directive from Spain. The corrections of 2025 will be profound if it is worth it.\n\n\nThe wind tunnel simulation data has always given very positive feedback in terms of the amount of load generated, however this cannot be fully exploited. With the problems revealed in Australia, Loic Serra has carried out an ‚Äúinterim‚Äù job to unravel the SF-25 enigma , up to considering a possible and almost concrete ‚Äúin-season‚Äù intervention on the rear mechanics. All this has led to a reorganisation of the developments planned for the SF-25, with the exception of the Bahrain package, already decided before Australia.\n\n\nLast year, the Imola race was one of the most important stages of the year in terms of development, while this year on the banks of the Santerno river it is worth noting that the possibility of introducing an updated SF-25 in the floor or body has never been examined . Everything has been postponed until after the Spanish GP , and is currently in the pipeline both in terms of decision-making and timing. Barcelona represents a watershed on the technical front to understand how the balance of cars with stiffer wings will change, especially for those teams that have based much of their firepower on the deformation of the front. The attitude on the technical directive front from Ferrari has returned a fair neutrality on the possible advantages and disadvantages of tightening the static controls of the front wings, but it is no coincidence that for many teams large evolutionary packages for the floor and body are planned for after Spain.\n\n\nAt Imola there will be Serra who is working quietly. While Ferrari will test an experimental rear brake grip, it is no coincidence\n\n\nTechnical director Loic Serra is expected to return to the track, inside the Scuderia garages to closely monitor operations. AutoRacer has information that suggests Imola will be a round with no significant new features on the SF-25. At the circuit named after Enzo and Dino Ferrari, the red car is scheduled to carry out a one-off test involving the use of a new rear brake duct , updated in the internal ducts, both for aerodynamic reasons and for different cooling management.\n\n\nIt is clear that both Ferrari and other teams, as we have already told you , are trying to replicate the ‚ÄúMcLaren effect‚Äù to avoid overheating the rear tires through the internal fluid dynamics of the baskets. The test will be a real experiment on the track to see the effect on the tires, to verify any advantages and disadvantages in conditions that are difficult to faithfully replicate in simulation. In Bahrain, as we have told you , the rear brake intake had been updated in the internal ducts, even if this type of modification may not be ‚Äúlisted‚Äù in the lists of technical innovations that the FIA releases every race weekend, which is why it is likely that this one may also be omitted. The modifications will also affect the wheel corner where the fins located in the internal area of the brake intake will be updated."", ""We'll always have next update and next year"", 'I do love how Italian media makes everything Ferrari related feel like a life or death scenario.', ""They thought they had reached the development ceiling with the SF24 and decided to change the suspension layout with the SF25, among other things. On paper, it was the right direction, but somehow, it hasn‚Äôt translated to the track, leaving Ferrari engineers puzzled as to why the simulations differ so significantly from on-track performance. I believe they‚Äôve started to understand how the SF25 works and are making arrangements to redirect the team's efforts as soon as possible so the championship isn‚Äôt completely lost.\n\nAs a Ferrari fan, I do hope they find the answers on home soil at Imola, giving us a sign of revival and momentum for the rest of the season."", 'what have you done, people! ü§¶\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è', 'Pee wan baby, pee wan.']",123,25,0.96,123,24,24,26,4,0.020000000000000018,26

I think it just reminds me on how much the current car and the dispersion of water spray is very bad these days, which translates over to poor visibility. With the regs being changed, I'm not sure if this aspect of the current regulations that is actively hindering the prospects of a good wet race at play will be reworked to accommodate as such\n\nAlso, I didn't think that last lap will give me the heart attack that it did, but it did. The winner of this race was going after drivers like he is drafted for war. Definitely one of his best drives, for sure\n\n\n[MONACO 2018]\n\nThere are probably many examples to this, but watching the McLaren of a certain driver come to a stop and DNF also makes me realise how far the McLaren had come from these days. As I watch the race go on, Alonso...y'know and Vandoorne is running at 17th. Not even drivers of their respective calibres can save the remnants of that McLaren, so to be able to witness the McLaren from such positions in the early 2020s to where they are now is such a mind trip\n\nAlso, Ricciardo nursing that PU problem while still retaining the lead is crazy. Granted, Vettel was currently dealing with his tyres and having a Hamilton trying to make attempts at overtaking forces him to go on the defense, but it does not deter Ricciardo's ability and drive that day. Not one bit"", 'I am at a car event on the weekend of the Monaco GP so can only watch either the qualifying or race live on TV (can attend car event either on Saturday or Sunday). Given the track and lack of overtaking, is it best to watch the qualifying and skip the race or vice versa?', ""What are some of the best non-podium drives you've seen?"", 'This 24hr live stream on the YouTube is the funniest thing omg. If you‚Äôre not watching watch it for the next race. I think it‚Äôs Brazil 08 so the live chat at the end is going to be priceless', 'What on earth is happening with redbull and Horner? It feels like I‚Äôve missed something', ""After 75 years, which drivers do you think are under- or over-rated in the Greatest Of All Time discussion?\n\nI of course think Jack Brabham deserves more mention, I mean imagine if Prost won a championship in a Prost car.\n\nI feel like Verstappen is overrated in the goat conversation, he's a great driver but at the end of the day he won four championships in a row with the same team, personally I rate that below winning at multiple teams"", "">  to be able to witness the McLaren from such positions in the early 2020s to where they are now is such a mind trip\n\nI remember Spa 2015 they were like 2.5 seconds a lap off. Just bananas. \n\nSuzuka that year, Button was saying it was genuinely dangerous because you'd look in your mirrors, see noone, and then at the end of the straight someone would appear in front of you from nowhere."", 'Charlie Whiting is Exhibit A of not knowing how good a thing you have until its gone.
