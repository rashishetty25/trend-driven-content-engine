1ogc0zg,What's behind Piastri's 'mystery' lack of pace in Mexico,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ogc0zg/whats_behind_piastris_mystery_lack_of_pace_in/,2025-10-26, News,"""The fastest car is a car that needs to be driven in a certain way, especially when you have conditions like here, and to some extent in Austin, with hot Tarmac, sliding tyres,"" said Stella.

""And the way in which you

generate laptime is a way that comes relatively naturally for Lando, and less naturally for Oscar. Lando is the driver of going on low grip, end of the stint when the tyres are quite worn, the grip is low - it's where we see Lando go green sector, green sector, green sector. Oscar, instead, is more of a driver of high grip. That's where he can exploit this incredible talent.","['There is no mystery.\n\nIn the 2023 Mexico GP Lando qualified 17th and climbed all the way to 5th. Oscar went from 7th to down to 8th.\n\nIn the 2024 Mexico GP Lando qualified 3rd and finished 2nd. Meanwhile Oscar qualified 17th and finished 8th.\n\nOscar is just not that comfortable at this track, and Lando is pretty good here. \n\nI swear F1 fans have the memories of goldfish.', 'So Oscar doesn’t like low grip. Is it safe to say this doesn’t bode well for next season considering the tires are smaller and likely will have lower grip?', 'In COTA Tom Stallard recommended that Oscar should use the combined more on entry like the other car (i.e. Lando) based on ""learnings from quali"".\xa0\n\n\nI believe (but could be wrong)\xa0this refers to combined throttle/brake application, which is supposed to help stabilize the car through corners.\n\n\nMaybe Oscar struggling more with this technique is why he has a harder time on low grip circuits where the car is a bit ""snappier""?\xa0', ""He did poorly in America last year as well, let's see what it's like in Las Vegas"", ""A reasonable explanation by Stella tbh, but it's easier to create conspiracy theories instead of reading I guess"", 'My guess is that he needs more ""feel"" at the front end on more slippery tracks, which is what Lando asked for and got earlier in the season but Oscar felt he didn\'t need.', 'Lol at all the comments suggesting conspiracy. Piastri has been shit in COTA and Mexico last year, same this year. Why it is so hard to believe that this is skills issue?', 'Last year Oscar’s form dropped exactly at the same point in the season. It’s no unreasonable to think that he has more problems extracting time lap from these tracks.', 'I thought the best drivers are the ones that can perform in difficult conditions', 'That sounds super reasonable. And Lando is very frequently fastest on track at the end of stints. Not just at COTA. \n\nAnd his first point about the car needing to be driven a certain way makes sense too. The competition and engineering is at such a high level, it really is coming down to the driver in those last couple tenths. You can see it in how at least in the past, Redbull had made a very pointed car which Max was able to adjust to better than any other team mate. Albon explains this in his interview about it. And as you watch your team mate excel more and more your confidence begins to crack. I think we are seeing in Piastri something similar. His onboards are so timid and nervous now.']",902,294,0.95,902,3123,3123,5,0,0.0,5
