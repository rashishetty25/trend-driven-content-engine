Just wanted to share some frustration and perhaps also a warning. We bought tickets for an F1 experience at Monza that included a pit walk, trophy photo and a track tour.... So the starter package ü§£

Anyway long story short when we did the pit walk all the cars were covered and garages were basically closed. So you pay a lot of money.... Well for me it's a lot and you end up with this.

Anyway maybe I was expecting too much. But if you are planning doing some similar maybe ask them what time you will do the pit walk and if it will be open.

I propose two key differences from the current qualifying and points system. 

* Qualifying doesn't determine grid placement. Instead it determines the order in which you choose your place on the grid. If you're 1st, you can choose to start anywhere on the grid. Later qualifiers can choose any remaining places. 
* We start with the current point system (25 points in first, etc.), but you get a bonus point for each place you finish higher than when you started. So if you started 20th and finished 15th, you still get 5 points. 

Let's see how this plays out in a few different scenarios:

1. If you qualify 1st in Monaco, you choose 1st on the grid because overtakes are nearly impossible.
2. If you qualify 1st on a track with a long straight (like Mexico City), you might choose 2nd on the grid because that position often wins to the first corner.  
3. If you have a fast car but bungled qualifying and didn't make it into Q3, you might choose 15th to maximize points through overtakes.
4. If you're a midfield team that only sometimes is in the points, you choose to start 20th if the track allows overtakes. 
5. If you expect many retirements due to weather and you're fairly slow but not the slowest, choose to start 20th so you get bonus points from retirements. 
6. If you're Norris who qualified 2nd in the last race of the season and 10 points behind Piastri who qualified 1st and chose 1st, you might choose to start 5th so that if you won, you get 25+4 points vs 18 points for Piastri, giving you the WDC. 

Now it's your turn. Is this a great idea, horrible idea, or something in between? ","['wake up babe, another post about alternate F1 rules just dropped', 'No thanks', ""Nope. Way too many options and confusion to make it fun to watch. \n\nThe worst ideas I've heard in quite a while."", ""It's a fun idea for a scramble/recreational weekend, for sure. And a fun thought experiment. \n\nCompetition wise? Nah, it doesn't necessarily further the purpose of qualifying in terms of building the race weekend, or the purpose of the race itself. Plus, realistically it would never make sense for someone starting in the top 10 to choose a lower position. If you start in P2, then overtake for P1, sure you get 1 extra point, but risk losing 7 if that overtake is never made."", 'If you were designing a tabletop board or card game, sure! All kinds of fun alternate strategies for winning points, why not?\xa0\n\n\nBut in real life, racing is *racing,* or at least it should be.', '**horrible idea**']",0,7,0.28,0,6,6,0,7,0.28,0
