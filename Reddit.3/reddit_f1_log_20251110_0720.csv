1osgskk,I looked at 800 overtakes from the last 30+ years at Interlagos. Here’s where you actually want to sit,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osgskk/i_looked_at_800_overtakes_from_the_last_30_years/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I’ve always heard people say the Senna S is the best place to watch the Brazilian GP, but I wanted to know if that’s actually true. So I went through data from the past 30+ years (roughly 1990–2023) and looked at around **800 on-track overtakes** at Interlagos to see where the action really happens.

**Main Straight / Start–Finish, Best overall**  
About half of all overtakes happen here. The long DRS zone and slipstreaming make it the busiest part of the circuit, and you see cars pull out to pass right in front of you. Plus you get the start, pit stops, and podium. **Grandstand A** is the go-to spot if you want overtakes and atmosphere in one.

**Turn 1 (Senna S), Pure action**  
Roughly a quarter of the overtakes happen here. Cars come flying down the straight and dive under braking. It’s chaotic on lap 1 and great throughout the race.  
**Grandstand M** sits right at the end of the straight with a perfect view into the Senna S, while **Grandstand B** is slightly further back but still sees the braking zone and the start of the corner.

**Turn 4 (Descida do Lago), Underrated gem**  
Around 10 % of the overtakes happen here. It’s the second DRS zone, downhill, and you often get side-by-side moves that carry through the corner. **Grandstand G** looks straight down the hill and gives a great sense of speed.

**Best spot**  
If you combine the main straight and Turn 1, you’re looking at roughly **80 % of all overtakes** over the past three decades, which matches what most F1 analysis sites say about Interlagos’ two DRS braking zones being where nearly everything happens.

**Turn-by-Turn Ranking (top 8)**

| Rank | Location       | Total Overtakes | % of Total | Avg/Race |
|------|----------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| 1    | Main Straight  | 471             | 53.2%      | 14.7     |
| 2    | Turn 1         | 227             | 25.6%      | 7.1      |
| 3    | Turn 4         | 80              | 9.0%       | 2.5      |
| 4    | Turn 2         | 24              | 2.7%       | 0.8      |
| 5    | Turn 6         | 19              | 2.1%       | 0.6      |
| 6    | Turn 3         | 13              | 1.5%       | 0.4      |
| 7    | Turn 10        | 10              | 1.1%       | 0.3      |
| 8    | Turn 12        | 9               | 1.0%       | 0.3      |

**TL;DR:**

* **Main Straight (Grandstand A)** – best all-round experience and most overtakes (~50% of overtakes)
* **Turn 1 (Grandstand M or B)** – most dramatic corner action (~25% of overtakes)
* **Turn 4 (Grandstand G)** – cheaper and still plenty going on (~9% of overtakes)

If you can get a seat that shows both the straight and the Senna S, you’ll catch almost all the overtakes live.

1osip54,Red Bull's tyre strategy in Qualifying,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osip54/red_bulls_tyre_strategy_in_qualifying/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"TLDR: Max failed to reach Q2 because Red Bull put him on high fuel and made him do 2 quali laps while everyone else did 1. 

I watched the Quali yesterday and saw all the discussions and memes till now. But I didn't see anyone criticising Red Bull for their horrendous management of Max in Q1. Feel free to correct me.

Q1 started with Max going out very early and being one of the first drivers to do a hot lap. He does one and puts the car outside Top 5 but still in a decent position. He then pits early. 

While he is in pits, everyone else goes out and put their respective times on board as the track ramps up. This includes Tsunoda who benefits from the same. Then everyone pits after their first lap, including Yuki. 

After everyone pits except Lewis, Max goes out again and does a hot lap. His car slides in Turn 9 which costs him 0.5 second. He improves but only to P16. 

Now this is the critical part. He does a cooldown lap while everyone else is still in the pits. Then he does another cooldown lap. Then he goes for his second hot lap while everyone comes out of pits, including Yuki. 

So he had more fuel than others, enough to do 2 cooldown laps and a hot lap. And his tyres were also worn down compared to everyone else using brand new set of tyres for only one lap. 

Despite this, Max only misses out by half a tenth in his second and final hot lap. He misses out Q2 by just one position. Even Yuki with a fresh set of tyres is slower by 2 or 3 tenths. 

If Red Bull had put him on low fuel and allowed him to do a single hot lap and then pitted him for a second time, he could've put a better time easily. Granted that Max made a mistake in first hot lap but there was 5 minutes left. It was enough to pit and go out again for another hot lap. 

Red Bull clearly ran a different strategy for Max. They wanted him to either save a third set of softs or believed that the soft tyre could last that long, which doesn't make sense because everyone else, including Yuki, only did one lap on softs in the end. 

This is also not the first time that they have fumbled the qualifying strategy. Max wasn't able to do a second hot lap in Austin because he went out too late. Yuki has also been a victim recently. ","['well, >99% of the time, Verstappen will be good enough to make it through with those used softs. Yesterday not. Shit happens', ""He's not made it out because the car is difficult to drive and he's made mistakes because of it. His first lap of his final run would have probably got him through to Q2 without the slide at T9.\n\nIf they'd sent him out with only 1 lap of fuel and he'd had the same T9 slide he would have been P18 instead of P16, so the slide is the issue (which will have also damaged his tyres more and hurt his second lap), not the plan itself.\n\nThe other side of this is that the driver usually has input into the plan for Qualifying, and Max has a lot of power at Red Bull, so I very much doubt they sent him out early with extra fuel without getting him to agree to it."", ""Was he slow because of the strategy or because they completely fumbled the car's setup? I'd say it seems to be more the latter."", 'The driver also has input in the qualifying strategy. They took a risk to change the setup from FP and the sprint, after Max complained, and Max probably wanted two laps to feel the new car setup.', 'So you mean he did almost or exactly the same run plan that Norris did yesterday in q3 that resultet in two times fast enough for pole?\n\nSounds not like the run plan was the biggest issue here. 🤷\u200d♂️', ""Red Bull also didn't use slipstreaming tactics in Mexico quali, which I can't understand if you still try to fight for the title.\n\nThey also used weird stragetys for Verstappen in the Zandvoort race, and were saved by safety cars.\n\nAnd the call to pit for hards in spain... yeah, no need to talk about it."", ""Hadn't really paid attention to this (thanks for pointing it out), but I was definitely shocked to see that Q1 exit...because his first lap was around 0.2/0.3ish off the top before the track evo on USED softs. That definitely did not seem like a P16 final quali result at the time😅"", 'It was a fumble for sure but now they have a chance to work on the car and give him a new PU.', 'The gap between P1 and P15 is not the same on every track. RB knew that softs couldn\'t last very long and others were going for one hot lap, including Yuki. \n\nThe slide in Turn 9 may be ""shit happens"" but not this.']",13,20,0.59,13,109,109,-3,0,-0.020000000000000018,-3

1osfra3,Lewis Hamilton & Ferrari - a discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osfra3/lewis_hamilton_ferrari_a_discussion/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I'm wondering in people are able to help me understand a little bit about the history of Scuderia Ferrari, the team dynamics, and whether it's realistic for Hamilton to be successful there before he retires. A few facts below.

* With respect to the Constructors and Drivers Championships, and in absolute terms, Ferrari are the most successful F1 team in history with 16 and 15 titles respectively. The second and third most successful teams are McLaren and Williams
* Ferrari's last Driver Championship is held by Raikkonen, won in 2007 and the last Constructors Championship was won in 2008. This means a Drivers title hasn't been won there for 18 years
* Since that period, 7 drivers have driven for Ferrari: Alonso, Massa, Vettel, Raikkonen, Leclerc, Sainz, and Hamilton. Out of those 7 drivers, 4 are World Champions and 3 are multiple World Champions
* Being a historic Italian outfit and almost a ""religion"" in Italy, Ferrari are based there, whereas most other teams (aside from a couple) are based in the UK
* Several individuals were instrumental in bringing Hamilton across to Ferrari including those with significant power i.e.,
   * Jon Elkan - Chairman and major stakeholder
   * Fred Vasseur - Team Principal
* Lewis Hamilton is now 40 years old however it was only 4 years ago (2021) when he finished 2nd in the Drivers Championship and 2 years ago (2023) when he finished 3rd with unprecedented dominance in front

I could lay out some more facts but based on the above I have some questions as I genuinely do not know the answers but hoping some folks can provide some more colour...

*  Why are Ferrari reluctant to shake up their team or are seemingly reluctant to take constructive feedback from their drivers (including a 7 time world champion) when what they have been doing for the last 18 years clearly hasn't been working?
* Hamilton has been in race winning cars since the start of career so why does it appear his feedback and/or constructive criticism isn't being well received? Drivers input is surely significant given that Schumacher is widely credited with helping drive forward the dominant Ferrari of the past
* Leclerc is of course a brilliant driver, however Hamilton is a champion. I know some people call him a rocket ship merchant but people have short memories and there are countless examples of Hamilton brilliance. His experience is second to none
* Why for example is Jon Elkan, the Chairman, top boss, and guy who brought Hamilton over not saying we need to listen to this guy, no exceptions? it appears to me that with the team consolidated in Italy, there isn't much wiggle room
* Why are some team members who are clearly not effective such as Adami not being reshuffled or sacked?
* Some people think that Ferrari wouldn't want Hamilton to break Schumacher's records or are embarrassing him in favour of Leclerc - how much truth is there to this?
* Why would Ferrari employ a 40 year old Hamilton if they think it wouldn't work? Some people state he is old and past his prime however we have seen that only 2 years ago he came 3rd in the Championship
* What are the realistic chances Ferrari will reflect on the errors of their ways and help Hamilton secure a title?
* What is actually going on here? Surely a team isn't arrogant enough to not want to WIN and are just trading off a historical brand name. 

","["">Why are some team members who are clearly not effective such as Adami not being reshuffled or sacked?\n\nCurious what data or knowledge you're basing this off?

Getting Lewis made fantastic marketing sense. In an ideal world theyd be winning too, but they have a driver more than capable of winning a title in Leclerc. They just need the right tools, and thats where Ferrari have been found wanting for nearly two decades.\xa0', 'Just one note: two years is a very long time, especially when things start to not go your way.\xa0\nHiring LH could be seen not only as a holy mary to try to win (if a 7 time world champ doesn’t win, who will?), but the PR and Merch side of it? Absolutely bonkers.\n\nAlso, they could have hired LH to improve for the future. Ferrari wants to win now, but also knows that things take time. So why not listen, and get some perspective, from someone experienced and, more important, outside of the team?', 'It’s pretty obvious there isn’t just one reason, and honestly firing everyone like people keep saying isn’t gonna fix anything. A team needs some stability, and changing things too much or too often, especially in a reactive way like Ferrari’s done before, just makes things worse. I also find it kinda funny how everyone treats the team’s “Italian side” like it’s a problem, or the problem, but then you see some of those “incompetent Italians” doing great once they leave (Stella, Costa...) while a few of the so called foreign geniuses who joined just ended up failing or adding more confusion but I guess the agenda’s gotta keep “agending” lol.\xa0\n\nWhen it comes to Hamilton, it’s clearly just a legacy thing. I get the feeling a lot of people in the team would’ve rather stuck with Sainz, but the call came from the top so… whatever. Sure, the team should try to listen to him more, but it goes both ways, with the exception of some pr friendly statements, he hasn’t really done much to fit in. Basically he’s asking the team to\xa0fully adapt not to his prime version, but to what effectively seems like the fading version of himself (or at least is perceived as such). They are both stubborn, totally a doomed marriage from the start\n\n\nEdit: one thing I forgot, they’re also really weak politically. People often talk about the bonus they get from FIA, but it’s almost like that’s their only leverage. In recent years sporting rules, even midseason, have mostly followed the direction pushed by other top teams rather than theirs, add in that they’re slow to react and develop, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for failure.\xa0']",0,35,0.31,0,110,110,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
