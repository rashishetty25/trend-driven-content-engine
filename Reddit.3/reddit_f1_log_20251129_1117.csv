According to early reporting from BILD Sport (link above in German; translating here to English), former Formula 1 star Adrian Sutil (42) was arrested by officers of the Stuttgart State Criminal Police Office. The motorsport star is now in custody in a Baden-Württemberg prison. The investigation concerns fraud and embezzlement.

Sutil competed in Formula 1 from 2007 to 2014 and holds the record for the most career starts without a podium finish (128).

Since his retirement from Formula 1, he has been well-known for his lavish lifestyle, often showing off his extensive car collection, valued at close to $100 million, in the streets of Monaco.

In 2008, Vijay Mallya took over the team and renamed it Force India. Sutil was part of the team until 2011, when he was replaced by Nico Hülkenberg at the end of the 2011 season. After his time at Force India, he raced for Sauber in 2014, a season in which he scored no points. After his involuntary departure, he joined Williams as a reserve driver in 2015.\n\nBy the way: After Hülkenberg finished on the podium at Silverstone this year, Sutil once again holds the record for the most Grand Prix starts (128) without a podium finish.', 'Nett hier.

Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren have opted for a medium-downforce aero setup, whereas Red Bull has gone for a lower-downforce rear wing, clearly visible from the flat main plane, as opposed to the “scoop-shaped” profile of the others.

This translates to less aerodynamic load and therefore reduced cornering grip, but also lower drag, resulting in higher top speed.

Consequently, in line with the trends of the season, we can expect a Red Bull particularly strong on the straights.

It remains to be seen whether the Milton Keynes squad will stick with this choice throughout the weekend to gain an edge in wheel-to-wheel battles.

Seems like it knocks those areas out of commission for a goodly while for set up and take down, plus the race days themselves. And the cost of installing grandstands, pit facilities, etc. I’m guessing tens of millions of dollars all-in? Clearly those towns think the economic or reputational benefit of hosting a race is worth it. ","[""> Clearly those towns think the economic or reputational benefit of hosting a race is worth it.   \n  \nCheck hotel prices in cities during a race weekend and compare it against a non race weekend.  \n  \nAt Las Vegas some suites with a view to a circuit went for 100k, at Monaco the nightly price increases from $500 per night to $20000 per night.  \n  \nFor regular circuits like Spa a $60 hostel 5km away suddenly costs $300 per night.  \n  \nWhile they don't directly benefit from it, the local economy and taxes from the event do help.  \n  \nOther circuits like Cota just get government subsidies that cover ~75% of the hosting fees, as without it they couldn't afford it to bring the circus to town.  \nhttps://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a1977191/cota-receives-293-million-texas-trust-fund-support-f1-us-grand-prix/"", 'It all boils down to the total cost for the facilities versus what the race visitors spend on lodging, food, and everything else.', 'When it comes to my opposition to street tracks, my main one is that the lack of a permanent racing circuit deprives the local motorsport community of a year-round venue with high safety standards they can use to develop local talent. Permanent tracks also can enhance the local economy from year round activity. Youth tend to be influenced by exciting activities and hobbies, so what better way to support a healthier and safer release valve than to build infrastructure to facilitate a much more professional approach to motorsport in general.', 'First, don\'t assume that the municipality that hosts the race actually pays the costs for building out the infrastructure.  That cost is usually covered by the race organizer, in addition the race organizer usually also covers the costs associated with the safety and security procedures - they pay for the police overtime and they pay for the fire rescue teams.\n\nYes, there\'s a loss of tax revenue - but the impact of that revenue depends on where the race is actually located and many of these street tracks aren\'t actually located in the central business district of a city -  adjacent to, or on the edge of that district but not in that district.  Miami\'s a perfect example here - the race was originally proposed to be in downtown Miami, the local government refused and instead it\'s out at the Dolphin\'s stadium which is several miles away from downtown Miami and isn\'t located in a business district of any sort.\n\nBut the big thing is that the city gets fees, a lot of fees, from the organizer to hold the race on city streets.\n\nAlso, unlike say, Monaco - the decision to host a street race often gets a lot of resistance from residents.  It was extremely questionable if the Miami-Dade government was going to approve the race plans - and those plans were tweaked several times to get approval from moving the race out of downtown Miami - and then further changes to the track plan to keep the race fully on the grounds of the stadium and race on the street at all. Las Vegas - there\'s still a lot of pushback over that race from residents and part of the reason it\'s held overnight is because it reduces the traffic disruption that the race causes on The Strip and surrounding streets. There\'s also still no guarantee that Las Vegas will have a race for more than a few years before the city and county kick them out.\n\nWhen New Jersey almost got a race - it was going to be held in a State Park - again outside of a business district, although again it met a ton of resistance because there was a bit of residential around the venue.  Ultimately though, it was Superstorm Sandy that killed that plan, not the residents.\n\nAnd it\'s not just F1 - Nascar won\'t be holding another street race in Chicago in 2026, despite attendance rising every three years, and making numerous changes in the three years the race was held to minimize disruptions.

1p9bb0s,Pirelli hasn't learned a thing from past experiences,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p9bb0s/pirelli_hasnt_learned_a_thing_from_past/,2025-11-29, Discussion,"2023 we had tyre issues caused by tyre construction 
2024 we had tyre issues caused by tyre construction 
And now 2025 we are having the same old repeat.
In 2 years they haven't learned a thing.
At some point you gotta question maybe it's time to either delay the homologation to account for final races or have measure in place to address the issues with mid season changes.
That's the only excuse I can come up with this mess caused by Pirelli incompetance. They are forcing teams to run 25 laps stint because they don't want a failure which is a side affect of having a single tyre supplier that they become complicit in innovation and pushing the boundaries. In 4 years of these new tyres we haven't really had any serious improvements nor have we learned from the mistakes. They have continued to fail in making the racing exciting with the failed C6 tyre which is going to be axed for 2026 and they have failed to fix the issue of tyre construction seen in Qatar. FIA has got all the data that Pirelli could need regarding gravel being used and the curbs being used because they are all FIA grades certified. But still we running into the same old problem. 
F1 should really look into opening up the grid to at least 1 more tyre supplier because the argument of costs doesn't hold up when you consider the fact we have got systems in place to regulate tyre suppliers and cost caps. They could treat them as a option for all teams and regulate the suppliers ensuring they are like what Pirelli is now. It would be like different brake suppliers but obviously much more integral to car performance.
This would at least mean that we have motivates for each supplier to do there best and we could see real push for innovation with tyre suppliers having a benchmark in form of other suppliers.
I am not saying we need to regulate it but we do need to offer a option for all teams.
We can a small set of rules for tyre suppliers basically along the geometrical shape limits for car design consistency and ensure that the tyres are easily interchangable. Maybe in 2000s it didn't work well but with current set of regulations and also mechanism on a sporting level we could make it work. Something to also add is that last Pirelli initially blamed debris for tyre punctures it's interesting to see how they have change the notion coming to this week and also I didn't mention that they had 2021 even though even they had tyre failures because they were different construction also the curbs that are used are something FIA has certified so clearly something that is not track's issue but a fundamental flaw that hasn't changed for Pirelli","[""I aint reading that wall. What's the tl;dr"", 'Good lord OP, learn to use paragraphs!', ""Fuck me mate. Learn to write a coherent post.   \n  \nI did not read it all, but I'm pretty sure these tires are made to exactly what is wanted. They're not made to just be the best and last a whole race.

Many people blamed specific debris last year because it was an easy conclusion from just watching the race. But the cause was identified to be very high wear, which makes the tyre vulnerable to all sorts of things. \n\n2021 was a different track. Literally.

The last thing F1 needs is a tyre war. \n\nWe've finally got a close grid with teams well matched at least on the car engineering side, leaving the question open on engine performance next year. I for one do not want to add a question about the best tyre supplier to that equation. \n\nFact is, very few people care about innovation or pushing the boundaries when it comes to tyre technology. The Pirelli tyres are more or less fine - if there are some restrictions at the Qatar GP, so be it, its not a big deal.\n\nIf a Ferrari finally wins a title, it ought to be because they were the strongest team, not because Bridgestone has a team at Maranello customizing their development for the SF26."", ""Were you a small yappy dog in a previous life?

1p9inxa,hot take : i think mclaren is completely justified in backing a driver at this point and needs to stop pretending otherwise.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p9inxa/hot_take_i_think_mclaren_is_completely_justified/,2025-11-29, Discussion,"look, we're deep into the championship with only two races and a sprint left and the points tell the whole story. one driver is at 390 while the other two are tied at 366. when you have that kind of gap, it's not favoritism or being unfair to make a call, it's basic championship mathematics.

this isn't like red bull where they backed their guy from race one regardless of performance or gave him preferential treatment when both drivers were equal. this is a natural hierarchy that's emerged over 20+ races based purely on results. one driver has extracted more from the car and built a legitimate points advantage. at some point you have to acknowledge reality and maximize your championship potential.

the ""we won't back anyone"" stance made sense early in the season when things were close and both drivers deserved equal opportunity. but now? you're just shooting yourself in the foot with indecision. every team that's won championships has made this call when the math demanded it! like ferrari with schumacher, red bull with vettel and max, mercedes with lewis. you don't win titles by being democratically fair, you win by being strategically ruthless when the situation calls for it.","['Do you watch sports?
