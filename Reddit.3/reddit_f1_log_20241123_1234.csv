The championship team feared McLaren might lodge a surprise complaint that could see all cars with protective skids disqualified. McLaren, having avoided this solution from the start, had no intention of protesting, as they were unaware of the ambiguity in the rules.\n\n> Ferrari was not appeased. “Six days’ notice was extremely short,” lamented Vasseur. The primary issue wasn’t raising the car slightly, which Ferrari’s SF-24 could handle due to its wide aerodynamic tolerance. The bigger concern was excessive wear on the unprotected mounting screws if the car bottomed out on the track, potentially violating the millimeter-rule. Gaining reliable data and performing tests under Free Practice conditions left little room for adjustments.\n\n> Ferrari briefly considered ignoring the directive. With written FIA approval in hand, the stewards would have little grounds to disqualify them if a protest occurred. However, Vasseur ultimately decided against it, unwilling to fan the flames in the Constructors’ Championship battle. “We’re better off focusing on ourselves. The FIA already has enough problems,” he concluded.\n\nThis is backed up by F1.uno, who reported that Ferrari had received explicit permission for this previously and that's why they were the most upset.\n\nThe ~~seven~~ eight teams that had to change their skid blocks were: Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes, Aston Martin, Haas, Sauber, Alpine, and VCARB.\n\nAll in all, it's a very messy situation, but probably not that impactful on car performance."", 'So to summarise, Red Bull were so paranoid that McLaren might protest something they had done (probably paranoid about revenge after they tried to get McLaren in trouble for the tyre thing) that they blew the whistle on themselves.

That part makes sense -- but that's the *only* part that makes sense.\n\nFirst, he wanted to base the team out of the new headquarters at Fishers in Indianapolis. But that's not exactly a major international transit hub, and even if it was, it would mean that Andretti would be treating the majority of the calendar as a flyaway round. The European teams would be able to commute easily enough between European races, but Andretti would have to travel a significant distance to every single race, even the Canadian Grand Prix, the closest race to Fishers. When he was racing in 1993, he insisted on basing himself in the United States instead of moving to England, so he had less time with the team on a day-to-day basis and never established good relationships with team members. It appears he was making the exact same mistake here. Even if he got the team up and running in Fishers, how is he going to attract the engineering talent and knowledge from Europe?\n\nSecondly, he wanted an American driver in the sport. Sure, there's an argument to be made here that an American driver could engage American fans, but a driver's nationality doesn't make them a naturally better driver. Haas -- the existing American team -- never felt the need to field an American driver, and while Gene Haas and Michael Andretti do have different motives and objectives here, it feels like Andretti is needlessly tying himself to a decision that makes little sense. Especially if his American driver fails to perform. This whole part of the plan was contingent on Andretti Global giving a competitive car to an American driver in its first years of operation, all while building up a team that is literally an ocean away from all of the engineering knowledge and experience. Sure, Brawn GP had a fairytale story, but that was mostly because Honda did all of the work on the RA109 chassis that became the BGP-001.\n\nThe major draw card of the Andretti bid was the Andretti name, but if his name was Michael Smith or Michael Jones or literally anything else, then the whole bid falls apart because these decisions don't really make much sense. And if Andretti got onto the grid and failed, it could be a hell of a long time before anyone else was willing to even try and establish a team."", 'funny, there are many American drivers who can only drive road courses.', 'I know it’s so hard to understand lil bro but I worked for Audi Product Planning for 6 years and their development drivers are American German and Swedish.

I was used to watching the sky commentators before (on free streaming websites), but I'm wondering if there is perhaps a general consensus that one of them is better?

My definition of better:

\- gives more information about the race (stats, explanation of incidents and situations,...)

\- access to team radios

\- has that chemistry and makes a joke here and there

1gx8ffr,Who will be the next American (USA) F1 Driver?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gx8ffr/who_will_be_the_next_american_usa_f1_driver/,2024-11-22, Discussion,"This is a question I asked on this Reddit around 2.5 years ago (just after it was announced Andretti had a good chance of getting on the grid!) - (https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/sw8s2i/who\_will\_be\_the\_next\_american\_usa\_f1\_driver/)

Although at the time Sergeant was the only American driver in F2, the comments make it seem like none of us had much confidence he'd make it. 

With Logan now out and the US still a massive and expanding market for F1; I thought it would be interesting to ask again. Frankly, this time it seems even less obvious who it might be.

I see the options as:

* Jak Crawford - The best placed American in F2 (currently 5th), with links to Aston Martin. However, frankly, I think its unlikely Aston would put him in their car.
* Juan Manuel Correa - Sadly will perhaps always be best know for being part of Hubert's tragic crash.
* Max Esterson - Stepping up to F2 next weekend, but does not have great results over the last few years.
* Ugo Ugochukwu - Unlike the last time I asked when there were 5 Americans in F3, there is only Esterson this year and so far only Ugochukwu confirmed for next year. He is perhaps the most exciting US prospect having won Macau last weekend and being a long-term part of the McLaren junior programme. But like Bortoleto would he need to go elsewhere to get an F1 drive?
* Colton Herta - Still fairly young Andretti driver who could come across with them?

Again, an honourable mention to Pato O'Ward who grew up in Texas but was born in Mexico - who drives for McLaren in Indy but has expressed an interest in coming to F1 before. Nowadays, I'd see him more as a possible stand in for a F1 race in the Americas if Lando or Oscar were injured. ","[""If Colton wants the drive. Andretti will make it happen.\n\nCrawford is definitely impressive.

Aston Martin I’m sure wouldn’t hold him back from an F1 seat and F2 drivers have closer paddock ties than Indy drivers do (especially those with academy ties), not to mention driving the same circuits as F1. \n\nHerta doesn’t have a super license. The Andretti ties work in his favour obviously but curious what Michael’s involvement is these days. \n\nI agree that Correa and Esterson are not realistic. I’d probably give Ugo the best chance after Crawford but outside of Macau, he wasn’t great this year either.
