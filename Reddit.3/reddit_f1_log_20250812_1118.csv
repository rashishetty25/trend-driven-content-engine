My favorite iteration of them is the British system with points for positions gained. The thing reverse grids do is ensure in a low level series that you don't have a driver that is significantly more skilled (experience, talent, whatever reason. Experience is incredibly important in a low level series) than most of the field, always qualifies well, and never really has to practice overtaking. That can be an issue in some F4 series, though Italian F4 has developed talent well without them, aided by their generally strong strength of field.\n\nFrankly, I don't think reverse grids should be a thing by F2. All of those drivers should be experienced, and if the cars and teams are as equal as possible there should be enough parity that the same driver isn't on pole most weeks anyway. And, if someone's up there consistently, it should mean that they deserve to be up there. (I'd like it to be centrally run with actually equal circumstances rather than better teams having advantage, but that's a different issue).\n\nHaving them in F1 makes far less sense than even F2.
