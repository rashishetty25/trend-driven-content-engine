HRC President Koji Watanabe and HRC Executive Advisor Takuma Sato spoke with high expectations about Tsunoda, as well as Ayumu Iwasa, who also took part in the test.\n\n**⚫︎ HRC President Koji Watanabe: ""We were able to realize his request to participate in the test. I have heard that he is very satisfied.""**\n\n  \n""I returned to Japan from Abu Dhabi yesterday afternoon (Tuesday, December 10th), and on Saturday I had various discussions with (Red Bull F1 Team Principal) Christian Horner about the drivers for next season and beyond. As I always say, the team has the right to decide on the driver, so our opinion is merely for reference, but from the HRC side, we believe that Tsunoda has the ability to be promoted to Red Bull and should be one of the candidates. I think that what we can do is to provide an opportunity for him to show his abilities to the world, so I asked him to participate in this test, and yesterday we were able to make it happen.""\n\n""I only met (Tsunoda) before the test, and he said, \'I want to achieve good results. I\'m going to enjoy myself.\' He said these two things, and since then, all I have is the report from the site by HRC, but he has very clearly analysed the differences between the RB car and the Red Bull car, and has given the team very useful advice and comments on that basis. I have confirmed from the report that Tsunoda himself is very satisfied.""\n\n""After that, I don\'t know what will happen, so we\'ll have to wait and see the results, but if it goes well, that\'ll be great. In any case, (even if he can\'t drive for Red Bull), he\'s already been booked to drive for RB next season, so I expect him to perform well next season no matter which team he drives for.""\n\n**⚫︎Takuma Sato HRC Executive Advisor ""All we can do now is pray.""**\n\n  \n""From what I\'ve seen, of course, with regards to Yuki, he showed amazing speed from Q1 (second place) at the Bahrain GP (2021) when he made his F1 debut, and I think his growth as a driver has been steadily increasing over the past four years. I met him at Imola (test held in August) for the first time in a while, and he seemed very relaxed, so I thought he\'s become a really good driver. Including race management and race craft, Yuki now has speed, and I think he has grown a lot with age and experience, including his own self-control to manage well.""\n\n""So, as I just said, we are hoping that he will drive for Red Bull, but I think it\'s up to the team. Yuki spoke to the media yesterday, saying that his driving style and the Red Bull car, with its sharp front end, suit him well, so I think he must have had a very good test. Now, all we can do is pray.""\n\n""Naturally, I went (to the Imola test) not only to support Yuki, but also to support Ayumu, and about half of the RB staff there, formerly Toro Rosso, who I tested with in 2008, were still there. So there were a lot of familiar faces.""\n\n""As we talked, it turned out that the engineers on-site really valued Ayumu\'s extremely sensitive abilities, and the feedback they were giving him in the simulator was extremely appropriate. During the actual test at Imola, (Liam) Lawson wanted to show his speed so he was pushing hard, and in a sense he was overdriving, but Ayumu was driving with great control, so the feedback from the engineers on-site was at a higher level for Ayumu.""\n\n""Looking at it like that, both Yuki and Ayumu are becoming really good drivers, so I really want them to get into F1 in a good way. As a driver, I have high expectations of both of them, so that\'s how I see it.""Takuma Sato\'s advisor, Koji Watanabe, CEO, comments on Yuki Tsunoda\'s test at Red Bull and 2025: ""All we can do now is pray""', 'its insane they are considering anyone but yuki', 'they must really not want Yuki in the red bull if the Higher ups of have to have talks personally with Horner to somehow convince him', 'One of us!

This made me wonder: how many wins did the other champions have before their first championship winning season? The results shocked me a bit: despite Max being considered quite young and inexperienced before 2021, historically speaking he was one of the most experienced winners before starting his championship winning season. In my mind this shows how good he was in inferior machinery during the Merc domination.\n\nLastly, an important note: even if a driver only did 1 race in a season, that is still counted as a season. I can’t be arsed to judge where the limit for a partaking in a season goes, especially with all of the drivers who did like 2 races a season back in the 50’s and 60’s.\n\nNow for the fun facts:\n\nMax Verstappen is the only driver to have more than 7 victories before starting his first championship winning season who hadn't finished runners up or been in a proper championship fight.\xa0\n\nMansell's 21 wins would put him 16th on the all-time win list, tied with Kimi Räikkönen's all time wins.

In other words, it is fairly common that new F1 champions have a rather limited experience winning races.\n\nHäkkinen and especially Button stand out as drivers with lots of overall experience, Button had 9 seasons before his WDC season, but with very limited race winning experience, only winning one race each. For Mika, it was the 97 season finale, the very race before his first WDC season, and he only won it because of the Schumacher-Villeneuve crash.\xa0\n\nKeke Rosberg is another driver who really stands out. Unlike most drivers without a victory before their first season, who generally won their debut quite early on in the season, Keke’s first victory came in round 14/16 in 1982. Even crazier, had he finished second, he still would have won the championship, and became the only driver to win the championship while never winning a Grand Prix.\xa0\n\nDespite all the talk about Norris being inexperienced in a winning position, should he win the championship next season he would be pretty average on this list. Russell would also be pretty average, while Leclerc would be on the high end. Perez would also be quite high, but if he is even on the grid next year, I’ll eat my cat’s food.

The deal will bring one of the world’s biggest motor-racing brands and MotoGP — often described as the two-wheeled equivalent of Formula 1 — under a single roof.\n\n>In-depth EU probes typically add about 90 working days to deal reviews — but can drag on, for example if regulators stop the clock to demand further data. The EU’s antitrust arm usually demands remedies to solve competition concerns but sometimes also decide to give their unconditional approval if initial concerns are shown to be unfounded.\n\n>Heightened scrutiny can also lead to firms walking away from planned acquisitions. Under the terms of the deal, Liberty would have to pay Dorna €126 million if it ends up withdrawing from the takeover.\n\n>Regulators have previously raised concerns over drawing both sporting brands together. CVC Capital Partners Ltd. was forced to put MotoGP up for sale nearly two decades ago to gain antitrust approval from European regulators for its takeover of Formula 1 in 2005.\n\n>MotoGP is just the latest asset to be taken over by billionaire John Malone’s sprawling Liberty Media empire that already includes a wide range of media, communications and entertainment businesses such as concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment Inc.\n\n>Since buying F1 in 2016, Liberty Media has targeted key markets including the US, attempted to grow the sport’s popularity through digital streaming and struck gold with the show Drive to Survive."", ""Can't read.

1hcaaf6,Question for older fans about Vettel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hcaaf6/question_for_older_fans_about_vettel/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"I'm a new fan this year, so I don't have a ton of context about Vettel's career or previous eras of F1.

With Verstappen's 4th WDC, there's been a lot of conversations online about how important/rare that number of (+ run of consecutive) championships are and discourse about whether or not Verstappen should be added to the list of ""GOATs"" yet. I generally think the GOAT discourse is nonsense, but it made me curious this time because: Why is Vettel not generally included when people talk about the greatest drivers?

To the best of my understanding, his stats are pretty good (like, consecutive championships are rare, he held the consecutive win record before Verstappen, 4 titles is *very* rare). Is there some context I'm missing? Is it just nostalgia bias where people are reluctant to induct a ""new"" guy into the ""good old days"" club? Are his titles less impressive than other champions' titles for some reason?

Thanks! Always looking to learn more about F1 :)","['I saw Vettel race in 2004 in Formel BMW and he was already a class of his own there. In 2008 he jumped into the limelight with his superb win in Monza and he build from there. Now specifically in 2011 and 2013 there wasn’t much competition (like Max had last year), with Vettel in the best car and his teammate just not at his level. His 2010 and 2012 titles were fantastic. His ‘GOAT status’ however got a hit in the seasons after, a bit like Lewis the last couple of years. In all, a fantastic driver, and he matured into a very likable guy the last years.', ""Getting matched by Ricciardo in 14 and then beaten by Leclerc in 19-20 really did a number on Vettel's legacy. Plus, his incapability in mounting a full challenge to Hamilton in 17-18. Add to that the perception of being a one trick pony (i.e. master of Newey's blown diffuser design) and you get the picture."", ""Other things that impacted Vettel career:\n\n2014 Vettel became a father (same year Bianchi died), and becoming a father tends to make you risk averse. \n\nJoined Ferrari which was not as stable as under the Montezemolo, Todt, Brawn years. Remember Alonso was there previously and couldn't make it work. Nobody doubts Alonso driving skills. \n\nVettel did not have a manager, and while that works in certain situations, it can backfire in others. If he had a good manager during his time at Ferrari, it would have ended differently. Someone like Briatore or Willi Weber would have never allowed Vettel to be treated the way Ferrari publicly did. Teams like Ferrari have a lot of internal politics, and a driver in this case needs a manager to navigate the politics and do the dirty work."", ""I did not go look up stats, nor did I fact check anything I'm about to say, and I haven't watched replays of his career so this is entirely my subjective perception, ripened in my mind all by itself.\n\nVettel was annoyingly good in the RB. I was really annoyed with it at least, and I think he suffered from Schumacher-backlash as well. Together these things made that people would grudgingly admit he was the best than openly admire and extoll his virtues. Vettel only really became well liked outside of Germany after his RB years. Maybe this is one way in which his legacy is subdued, the people who saw him at his best might have been emotionally invested in seeing him fail.\n\nBut he was winning so much because he had some really undeniable strengths. He was a great qualifier, great starter and generally executed brilliant first laps, in laps and out laps. Especially the latter, his ability to feel out a car that's not yet in its performance window, is a champion's skill. At the time, he also had an iron mind, always thinking and unwavering determination. I remember him being spun round in the first lap in one of the final races of the season (or possible THE final) and cheering massively because I was hoping Webber would win the championship as a result, but then seeing Vettel coasting backwards, constantly making steering adjustments to avoid further contact and gather it up on the tarmac. Mid-crash, he was already working on the recovery drive. Seeing Max vs. Norris this season has only cemented my memory of how unimpeachable Vettel was back then; no one was consistent enough to snatch it away from him even at times when RB wasn't on top, true back then and true this season.\n\nWhat Vettel could not do post-RB however, was consistently outdrive the car. Drag a shitbox into big points. And that is in my opinion the sole reason why a driver like Alonso is rated higher than Vettel, despite similarly only having undisputed supremacy in one particular car with kind of a niche setup. Vettel's Ferrari career was a spiral of overdriving, frustration and costly mistakes. Come to think of it, Vettel's Toro Rosso career (also a shitbox) was probably similar in this regard, he could be brilliant but also represented a Grosjean-level liability at times. I think a lot of it is probably psychological, he lost that sense of infallibility and became a (very well liked) human again, but this meant he could not find the last 1% and might spin out chasing it in vain.\n\nI wonder how Hamilton will do in the ferrari. He's a bit of an enigma: he definitely does not have that iron mind, but when the carrot is dangled, he does still find the 1%. He might be a Vettel or an Alonso at Ferrari. I can't wait!"", ""It didn't help that when he was at his most successful, he was also at his least likeable."", 'He was simply much more error prone than Max. He was a fantastic driver otherwise but if you’re comparing him to the GOATs it’s a pretty fatal flaw. I would recommend an F1TV subscription where you can watch the entirety of Seb’s career in full. \n\nYou’ll see critical errors like how he took himself out in Turkey 2010 trying to pass his team-mate, throwing away an easy victory in Hungary by flouting the safety car rules and his absolute mare at Spa. \n\n2017 it was a big ask to win the championship but he let Lewis off the hook massively with his start line move in Singapore, a track where Mercedes were known to be weak. He had a great year otherwise but that was a basic, unforgivable error that wiped out any title hopes he had in an instant.\n\nIn 2018 his crash in Germany was huge and it felt like he unravelled mentally after that with the pressure Lewis put on him. Ferrari made huge gains with the PU from Spa onwards but he made an error at Monza understeering into the side of Lewis on the first lap, with Lewis going onto beat Kimi to the win. Lewis then had arguably the weekend of his life in Singapore and the mistakes kept flowing from Seb through 2019, which is arguably the main reason Leclerc beat him that year.\n\nSome people will point to Danny Ric beating him in 2014 as a reason why Seb isn’t one of the best but I think that was simply a down year for Seb. In his championship years he had this hyper aggressive counter intuitive driving style that the blown diffusers really helped him hone. When the 2014 reg changes took that away, he needed the time to adapt. He went on to (at times at least) thump Raikkonen almost as convincingly as Alonso had done and that tells me Seb had all the ability in the world, I just don’t see at all that Ricciardo was fundamentally better. It’s a shame we never got to see a rematch to prove this theory.', ""There was a time when Vettel and Hamilton were about equal, success-wise, and Seb kinda flatlined from that point, while Lewis pulled away, amassing many more great wins & three more championships. \n\nI'm sorry to say that Vettel got a touch of the checos towards the end, which damaged his reputation somewhat. \n\nI don't really get the thing about 'consecutive championships'. I'd've thought non-consecutive championships would be harder and more rare (and therefore considered the greater achievement?)"", ""To me there can never be GOATS , it defeats the purpose of having a GOAT in the 1st place , like in football every1 say messi and Ronaldo are GOATS , to me that's dumb cuz u r supposed to pick one and the goat is messi. Just like in racing there can be only one goat and that is maldonado."", ""Vettel's not seen as a GOAT tier driver because he wasn't great when Ferrari had the car to challenge Mercedes in the hybrid era and then at Aston he was a shadow of his former self.\n\nHe was good in the V8 era with a good car, but he didn't show enough long term. He's like Ricciardo where he was fast when it suited him and then faded when it didn't. Drivers like Senna and Verstappen were always fast and that's why they're GOAT tier drivers."", 'He was regarded as a highly talented though flawed driver back in 2009-2010. Vettel\'s first title could have been a lot easier for him had the RB6 been reliable, but his own errors in Turkey, Hungary and Belgium showed there was room for improvement.\n\nThen, in 2011, his dominant streak still featured talk of weaknesses. Canada\'s slip-up (something that can happen to anyone, really) was often characterized as him cracking under pressure. Such chatter remained, although he silenced many critics through races like Abu Dhabi and Brazil 2012.\n\nThe ""Vettel era"" is something that you only really felt at times in 2011 and in the back half of 2013. It was never as much of a constant as Hamilton\'s dominance in 2015 and 2019-2020 displayed, irrespective of the points totals and such. Max\'s era is also different to Vettel\'s, as the ultra-dominance of 2023 and his many wins either side of that season have cemented it as an unprecedented walkover.\n\nVettel never got the legend status of Senna/Prost or what Hamilton/Verstappen will end up as. The reason ultimately is found in what happened after his titles. Beaten by Ricciardo in 2014 and exiting RBR, never getting his Ferrari WDC and being dropped in 2020 at a relatively early age.']",15,120,0.68,15,108,108,2,1,0.010000000000000009,2

I have been listening to many different historic formula 1 podcasts over the last 6 months (specifically the Bring Back V10’s and “And Colossally That’s History” series from The Race Media Group) and have become interested in working my way through all of the “modern” history of formula 1. I have what I would call an extensive knowledge of general F1 history, but have become fascinated with learning more of the nuanced details of the modern sport, particularly from 1990 onwards (i started watching consciously in 2015, I was 8 at that time so only have full-race knowledge from then onwards). on F1TV, there are only season reviews and extended highlights packages/race replays for a few races per season until about the mid-2000’s, when every race is available. Is there somewhere I can access every race, or can someone attest to the accuracy and depth of the content in the season reviews?

1hclu70,Somethings to know about the 2026 cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hclu70/somethings_to_know_about_the_2026_cars/,2024-12-12, Technical,"Keep in mind i'm talking about the pre-redesign car here, things may have changed.

**1: There won't be as much downforce as with the 2024 cars.**

This will likely make handling more difficult, many drivers will likely spend more time fighting the cars than fighting for position. And also a lot more MazeSpins(TM).

**2: 2026 cars will be slower and smaller compared to 2024 ones.**

With one part of ERS removed, 2026 cars will have less energy. And the design is more narrower. Combined with DRS being replaced with Override Mode, this would make 2026 cars slower when OM is not active. This was likely done to favor racing in tighter circuits like Monaco.

**3: 2026 cars are allowed less fuel flow, and this fuel likely has lower performance.**

In order to foster sustainability, fuel flow has been reduced from 100 kilos per hour, to just 70. This is a one-third reduction in fuel input. Further, fuel efficiency and autonomy will likely be reduced as biofuels tend to burn faster than fossil fuels, leading to lower MPG. Anyone who drives a flex car will know this.

**4: To compensate for lower combustion engine performance, the hybrid engine will have quadruple horsepower.**

The plan is for the 2026 electric hybrid engine to have its power increased from 160hp to 470hp, almost four times higher. As a result, output from both engines would be on par with each other, at least when OM is active.

**Further considerations:**

* With lower efficiency fuel and a hybrid engine that puts more strain on its battery, and with MGU-H being banned, it is likely that the FIA will either shorten the races, or allow mid-race refueling and recharging.
* It is likely that, to improve stability, teams will try to find ways to increase downforce without sacrificing speed. Similar to what Brawn GP once did, if i remember correctly.
* If stability cannot be improved, the likelihood of yellow and red flags will increase due to a possible rise in crashes, cars going off-track, and spin-outs.
* It is likely that the teams will make the fuel tanks and batteries as large as possible so as to not risk finishing the race with a dead battery and without the FIA-mandated fuel sample.
* All 2026 gearboxes will have 6 gears instead of 8. That's it.

Tell me what you think about this.","['""it is likely FIA will allow mid race refueling"" absolutely not lol. \n\nAlso what do you mean about your point of Brawn? Finding loopholes? Of course? All teams do that, all the time. It is part of the sport. Nothing special about the new regs though.\n\nAnd you can\'t say anything about them fighting the car more than fighting for positions. A person fighting his car will allow another to try to gain a position. It could actually improve driving battles.', 'Not sure 470 is nearly four times 160.', ""> Tell me what you think about this.\n\nA lot of speculation, not a ton of substance.\n\n> it is likely that the FIA will either shorten the races, or allow mid-race refueling and recharging\n\nNeither will happen, this is the engineering challenge that the teams must solve. This type of constraint is fundamental to formula racing and challenges like this have been solved in previous regulation sets, 2014 as an example.\n\n> It is likely that, to improve stability, teams will try to find ways to increase downforce without sacrificing speed. Similar to what Brawn GP once did, if i remember correctly\n\nThis is, and has been, a central problem in formula 1 since it became an aero-dominant series. Teams will always try to find downforce without a drag penalty. They're doing it right now. \n\n> If stability cannot be improved, the likelihood of yellow and red flags will increase due to a possible rise in crashes, cars going off-track, and spin-outs.\n\nWhat makes you think that stability will be lacking? Lower downforce does not inherently mean an unstable car. \n\n> It is likely that the teams will make the fuel tanks and batteries as large as possible so as to not risk finishing the race with a dead battery and without the FIA-mandated fuel sample\n\nAbsolutely not, they will not want the weight penalty. The single biggest performance indicator in a race car is its power:weight, so all the teams will be working overtime to make their fuel tanks and batteries will be as small as possible. If anything, the regulations will impose a minimum weight for both to try to curtail the endless pursuit of cutting weight which becomes both expensive and time-consuming."", ""I'm not against the cars being slower tbh.
