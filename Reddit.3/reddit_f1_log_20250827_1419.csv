1n106se,The worst rookie in every F1 season I‚Äôve watched,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n106se/the_worst_rookie_in_every_f1_season_ive_watched/,2025-08-26, Discussion,"For reference, I will not be counting one off drivers like Lotterer, Aitkin or Fittipaldi

**2012:** Ricciardo, Vergne, Grosjean, **Pic**: Bit unfair to give this one to Pic as he was stuck driving a Manor all year, but the other three were consistently good to great (albeit Ricciardo and Vergne‚Äôs Toro Rossi was awful for most of the season).

**2013:** Bottas, **Gutierrez**, Bianchi, Chilton, Van Der Garde: An undertalked about driver in my opinion when it comes to discussing the 2010‚Äôs worst drivers. Gutierrez was in point scoring cars for two of his three seasons in F1, and he finished in the points a grand total of once.

**2014:** Magnussen, Kvyat, **Ericsson**: I don‚Äôt want to be too mean on Marcus, because he is a reasonable driver in F1, and has had more convincing performances than he gets credit for, especially in his last season. Having said that, him being overtaken by Bianchi in Monaco of all places costed his team dearly.

**2015:** Sainz, Verstappen, Nasr, **Stevens**, Mehri: For some reason every time I look up driver ranking lists, Stevens is always ranked over Mehri, despite Mehri finishing higher than him in the standings. Granted, Stevens beat him in more races, but it was hardly Verstappen team mate dominance.

**2016:** Palmer, Ocon, **Haryanto**, Wherlein: I feel for this lineup, because all of them were driving terrible cars. To Haryanto‚Äôs credit, he did occasionally beat Wherlein in qualifying, but he never beat him in the races.

**2017: Vandoorne**, Stroll: As much as people like to hate on Lance Stroll, even in this season alone, his accomplishments were a lot higher than Vandoorne‚Äôs.

**2018:** Gasly, Leclerc, Sirotkin, **Hartley**: Always looked out of his depth, despite driving a points scoring capable car. Whenever he qualified well, he would tumble terribly in the race. Only scored four points, all of which came down to crazy races or shocking disqualifications.

**2019:** Russell, **Giovinazzi**, Norris, Albon: By far the worst interesting of the three. Had no standout moments all year and was easily beaten by an aging Raikonnen.

**2020: Latifi:** He‚Äôs the only rookie in this particular year, but considering the quality of his performances, I think calling him the worst rookie of the year suits him far more than being the best.

**2021:** Tsunoda, **Mazepin**, Schumacher: No words are required here.

**2022: Zhou:** Unlike Latifi, Zhou‚Äôs rookie year was alright. Nothing spectacular, but I would say his rookie year was the best rookie year of all the worst rookies on this list.

**2023: Sargeant**, De Vries, Lawson, Piastri: Close between Sargeant and De Vries, but ultimately went with Logan due to De Vries having occasionally out qualified Tsunoda.

**2024: Colapinto**: Really the only driver who can be called a full time rookie in 2024, but he still did alright. Shame he didn‚Äôt show the promise from this year currently at Alpine.

Even Sargeant was better (although not by much)', 'Vandoorne‚Äôs rookie season was much, much better than Stroll‚Äôs. He was about as close to Alonso as Stroll is now, despite the fact he was a rookie and facing a much younger version of Alonso. \n\nStroll‚Äôs rookie season was unbelievably poor. He averaged almost a second a lap slower in qualifying against Massa, and the only reason it was close in points was due to Massa suffering a cartoonish amount of bad luck. Massa had 2 random punctures in Russia and Mexico (the latter of which was under safety car conditions), a random suspension failure in Azerbaijan (which cost him a likely podium) and was wiped out by Sainz in Canada.', ""2015: It's been a while but I remember Merhi being way out of his league not to mention he went back to F2(?) and caused a horrendous and quite amateur crash.

Vandoorne had a really good junior career even if he was a bit older by today's standards.

He was cursed with mechanical issues and people crashing into him at no fault of his own. He underperformed for sure for a 2x WEC champion but I want to cut him some slack.

1n1ejru,[AMuS] FIA has defined track dependent rules for energy management in 2026. According to the latest version teams will not be allowed to use full electrical power at Monaco and Singapore. Energy recovery will also be restricted on certain tracks.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n1ejru/amus_fia_has_defined_track_dependent_rules_for/,2025-08-27, News,,"['Completely sensible if the reports about the cars being able to reach 400 km/h are true but these regs feel like they‚Äôre going to be a disaster', '>Formula 1 cars threaten to be too fast on some circuits in 2026. That\'s why the FIA is imposing strict energy management requirements on the teams. We have been given an insight into the secret data sheets.\n\n>A new era begins for Formula 1 in 2026. Once again. And yet the next technical regulations have a different quality than all previous technical reforms. Not only because the drive, chassis and tires are changing. The high proportion of electric power in the drive system presents the rule-makers with major challenges. There is a difference between feeding 350 kilowatts (475 hp) or 120 kilowatts (163 hp) from the battery into the system.\n\n>Added to this is 400 kilowatts (545 hp) from the combustion engine. Minimum. Engine circles are already talking about up to 430 kilowatts (585 hp). This means that the hybrid drives of the future would have well over 1,000 hp at full power. But not always. To charge the battery reliably, it is not enough just to recuperate on the brakes. The combustion engine will also have to help recover energy when cornering under partial load.\n\n>Keyword energy management: in the future, this will be as important as the peak engine performance itself. FIA Head of Sport Nikolas Tombazis confirms: ""If the electric share of power increases relative to the combustion engine and the batteries only have limited charging and discharging capacities, energy management will become an important challenge. This will bring about some innovations on the electric side of the drive.""\n\n>No risk in the Monte-Carlo tunnel\n\n>The teams will not be completely free when it comes to energy management. If they were, in extreme cases this could lead to excesses that pose a safety risk. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff warned of top speeds of up to 400 km/h. If full electric power were allowed in Monte-Carlo, the cars would be able to reach speeds of 350 km/h at the end of the tunnel - until now, it has ""only"" been around 290 km/h.\n\n>If there were no restriction on charging, the cars would lose too much speed too quickly in the middle of the straights. If suddenly 120 kilowatts are missing, it\'s not so bad. With three times the power, it becomes a problem. That\'s why the power has to be gradually reduced when sailing down the straights. ""We will make sure that the cars don\'t suddenly decelerate on the straights or do any other unnatural things,"" confirms Tombazis.\n\n>The complexity of the future hybrid drive requires that limits are set individually, depending on the race track. There is already an energy management chart for this, but it is only a snapshot. It is constantly being adapted in consultation with the teams and engine manufacturers. We were allowed to take a look at the secret paper.\n\n>Rules are constantly being adapted\n\n>According to Tombazis, the FIA is in constant contact with the teams to find out what the drivers report from the tests in the simulator and where there are still weak points. ""We have not yet finalized the rules. They will be adapted step by step, depending on the experiences the teams make and report to us. The more intensively they get involved in development now, the more often the drivers try out the 2026 cars in the simulator, the more feedback we get from them.""\n\n>The product is not yet finished, but each of the eleven teams already has the current status of how the energy may be used on the individual circuits. First of all, the proportion of each track where full throttle is theoretically used is determined. In Melbourne this is 4,630 out of 5,278, in Monte-Carlo 1,388 out of 3,337 and in Monza 4,218 out of 5,793 meters.\n\n>With two exceptions, full power can be called up on each of the 24 GP circuits. Only on the street circuits in Monte-Carlo and Singapore does a reduced power mode known as ‚ÄúRev1‚Äù apply.\n\n>This is how much can be charged per round\n\n>There are also restrictions on charging. According to the regulations, the maximum amount of energy that can be charged into the battery via the MGU-K per lap is 9.0 megajoules. But not everywhere and not always. The directive not only makes a difference for racetracks, but also whether it is a free practice session, a qualifying session or the race. Sprint and Grand Prix are treated equally.\n\n>On twelve of the 24 circuits, a maximum of 9.0 megajoules per lap may be recuperated in free practice, qualifying and override mode. For each normal lap in the race, 8.5 MJ/lap applies. This category includes circuits such as Suzuka, Miami, Monte-Carlo, Spa, Madrid and Austin.\n\n>In Barcelona, Silverstone or Zandvoort, the maximum amount of storage is also limited to 8.5 MJ/lap in qualifying. There are precautionary measures on the extremely fast circuits. In Jeddah, no more than 8.5 MJ/lap may be charged in free practice, no more than 6.5 MJ/lap in qualifying and no more than 8.0 MJ/lap in the race. In Monza, only 6.0 MJ/lap is permitted in qualifying.\n\n>DRS effect via extra boost\n\n>In order to prevent a car suddenly becoming an obstacle when sailing on the straights, the power of the combustion engine may only be reduced gradually. Normally, 100 kilowatts per second apply. On the super-fast tracks such as Melbourne, Jeddah, Silverstone, Spa, Monza, Baku and Las Vegas, it is only 50 kW/s.\n\n>DRS will be history next year because the cars will automatically flatten the flaps on the front and rear wings on the straights to reduce drag. From 2026, the overtaking aid will be an extra boost from the drive. As with DRS, it may only be used if the gap between two cars at the detection point is one second or less.\n\n>The points at which the distance is measured and from which the power button may be pressed are largely already defined and specified in meters. These distances refer to the distance to the finish line. As only one point has been noted so far, it looks as if there is only one point per track where the override mode may be activated.\n\n>Boost area does not equal DRS zones\nIn Spa, this is conveniently the finish line. In Bahrain it is the fourth straight between turns 13 and 14, in Shanghai, Barcelona, Montreal or at the Red Bull Ring the home straight, in Interlagos at the end of turn 13 and in Melbourne at the end of the back straight.\n\n>Tombazis does not yet want to say how powerful the overtaking aid will be. ""This is currently being coordinated with the drivers in the simulator. There are similarities with DRS, but also differences. We don\'t want to make overtaking too easy or too difficult. The parameters will not be the same for every track.""\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com. If there are errors please let me know so I can correct them!', 'I really dont like the sound of this.', 'The varying MJ available per track and session is reminiscent of the LMP1 days in WEC where the various hybrid energy allocation was written for Le Mans and then proportionally adapted for other tracks based on the lenght.\n\nThe fact that it also varies by track session however will make it incredibly obscure to explain for the more casual viewers.', ""It is very weird to me that regulations aren't even finalized to this point.

Now we get performance limits that are invisible to fans.\n\nGiven how poor a job FOM does showing electrical deployment and battery status now, I have no faith it‚Äôll be any clearer next year', ""Completely understandable as these will be straight line weapons, so safer to just limit the power at tracks that dont really care about power output/straight line speed. 350km/h at the end of the tunnel is just too much risk.

1n10tny,A valid hypothetical question - would these 3 changes have altered the course of the 2005 season entirely?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n10tny/a_valid_hypothetical_question_would_these_3/,2025-08-26, Discussion,"Hello hello Formula 1 fans. 

I recently found my 2005 season review DVD (""Fantastic Fernando"") and inspired by the season review + some Bring Back V10s discussions, it occurred to me that there a bunch of very likely to have happened ""What if"" scenarios in this year which are not totally far-fetched, abstract nonsense - you know, nothing like ""what if Lewis and Max raced in 2005"" but things that were plausibly likely in the 2005 season. 

I have excluded a compromise outcome on the USGP because that GP is a bit like Fukushima's reactor. Not healthy to touch! 

The question I have for you all is - do they make a material difference to the outcome, which is the first WDC crown for Fernando Alonso. Fernando takes home 133 points vs Kimi Raikkonen in P2 on 112. 

These are the three hypotheticals:

\- In his biography and on some podcasts, **Mark Webber** has revealed that his manager Flavio Briatore wanted him to sign for Renault and drive alongside Fernado Alonso for '05. Mark instead went to Williams, because of the nostalgia pull of it being the team where Alan Jones won his title. Mark had a decent season with the car in 2005, but history would show him a better driver than the actual team-mate of Fernando, Giancarlo Fisichella (who finished P5 in the standings with less than half of Fernando's points). What changes would this have had to the season? (Notwithstanding the obvious; that Mark wins his first race before 2009). 

\- **McLaren-Mercedes** pairing of Kimi Raikkonen and Juan-Pablo Montoya (plus Alex Wurz and Pedro de la Rosa, who did 2 races for an injured Montoya) finished 2nd and 4th in the title. Reliability hampered the McLaren, it provided an impediment to the team that the Renault of Fernando didn't suffer (Fernando retired once due to a broken suspension; Fisi, by contrast, had mechanical gremlins more often). Assuming the reliability had been comparable between Alonso and Raikkonen, does this change the season outcome?

\- **Ferrari,** as the lead **Bridgestone** customer, were caught flat footed when the rules banned tyre changes for 2005. Tyres now had to last the whole race unless there was safety risks involved with keeping boots on. Kimi's crash at Germany that year was an example of the risks associated with 50/50 calls on tyres, for example. Bridgestone had been integral to Ferrari's dominance of the prior seasons, with bespoke tyres just for the Scuderia. Their ability to construct competitive, durable rubber that could meet or exceed the Michelin rubber was not comparable. Hence, the only Bridgestone win is USA 2005. This rule only lasted for 2005, which was longer than the stupid aggregate qualifying. In 2006, Michelin withdraw from F1 and it's only Bridgestone left, with Fernando taking title #2. If the 2005 tyre rule isn't there - either, allowing tyre changes or going straight to the 2006 Michelin withdrawal, does the season look different as a result? ","['1. Webber was of similar calibre to Fisichella, so this wouldn‚Äôt change much from reality. Alonso would have destroyed him.\n\n2. The McLaren when it was working was much faster than the Renault. So with equal reliability, Raikkonen would have strolled to the title.\n\n3.  Ferrari would certainly have been much more competitive. I think they would‚Äôve challenged for the title, but they wouldn‚Äôt have been as dominant in 2004. It‚Äôs worth noting that in the one race where the Bridgestones worked properly at Imola, Schumacher would have won without his mistake in qualifying.', 'Michelin was still around for 2006, they won the championship with Alonso/Renault\n\n1) Probably nothing changes with Webber, maybe less points for Kimi/MSC/whoever but Renault won WCC even with Fisico\n\n2) Renault had good reliability also because they were managing their PUs. Alonso started the year very well and because of that points lead Renault could afford to not go all out for every single victory, consistent podiums being good enough. Same thing happened in 06, where Renault ran quite detuned untill a late upgrade in the season\n\n3) rules were made to nerf Ferrari and it worked. Hard to say how good Ferrari would look on a different rubber or in a different rule set, but in the end the points gap was huge even with the indy farce. Is that huge gap only on the tyres or the car was also not great? Very hard to say', 'Almost a race weekend\n\nAlmost a race weekend\n\nAlmost a race weekend\n\nAlmost a race weekend', '1. It is hard to say whether Webber at Renault would had changed anything. I can\'t actually properly rate him, as while he was a great driver, he spent most of his years at midfield/backmarker teams. Even at Williams, he spent a lot of time into adapting to the car (more time than his teammate Heidfeld) and would had very well been outscored by Nick, hadn\'t the latter had a season ending injury.\n\nWebber was quick, but he wasn\'t ever ""Alonso quick"". Or if he was, we only saw that in 2010, which is just a fraction of his career. I\'d say in 2005 he probably does about the same as Fisichella, then outscores Fisichella in 2006 (with Alonso still winning the championship) and then getting kicked out after 2007 for returning Alonso and rookie Piquet Jr. That said, I think Webber would had won Suzuka 2005 so we wouldn\'t have Kimi\'s iconic win.\n\n2. While McLaren was still unreliable, you have to keep in mind that both Kimi and JPM did a lot of mistakes that year. While the tire blowout at N√ºrburgring is already minus 10 points from Kimi\'s tally, he is also the one who refused to pitstop for new tyres. So while Alonso gained a lot from McLaren\'s unfortune, he was also more consistent of the 2. In an universe where no driver has bad luck, Kimi would win. But in an universe with better reliability, I think Alonso would still win. Although as a Kimi fan, I\'d love to be corrected on this one.\n\n3. This is a common misconception people have. The tyre rule was done in order to stop Ferrari\'s dominance. But they also produced a car that didn\'t go well with new aero rules. So even without the rule, I doubt that Ferrari would had competed for the championship, but Schumacher would surely have more wins than 1. Which could had impacted championship results in a long run. But it is impossible to say how.', ""Alonso would've destroyed Webber\n\nRaikkonen would've won\n\nFerrari would've won"", ""1) Renault would probably get the Constructors' in a more convincing way but otherwise I don't see that much of a change. Webber would be lucky to win a race given his history of bad starts from the front (back then in mid-2000s), maybe it would come later in 2006.\n\n\n2) If the reliability wasn't an issue, Kimi would take the championship down to the last race. He'd win at Imola and Hockenheim and grid penalties wouldn't hamper him the way they did. I'm not counting N√ºrburgring in, that was a mechanical issue and a team decision.\nMcLaren would still have a hard time getting Constructors' since Montoya was quite appalling. In reality, he singlehandledly cost them that title.\n\n\n3) Hard to say regarding this one. It would change the dynamics of the season but the rule change wasn't only associated with the tyre rule - the front wings were lifted, the design of the cars changed quite a lot compared to previous few years. The Ferrari could be a lot closer but still not close enought to challenge for the championships."", 'Kimi in the Mclaren was the faster driver in 2005. The trouble is the Mclaren broke if you sneezed at it. Give both Mclarens the reliability of Alonso and they‚Äôd take points off him, and Kimi gets the title.', 'Renault often raced with their engines on a lower power mode, prioritising consistent high-scoring finishes over wins. Pat Symonds claimed the only time it was fully turned up was China, when Alonso comfortably had the edge over Raikkonen.', 'I think Webber had an edge on Fisi, but the question is more does he so better in the 2nd car than does he beat Fernando. My assumption is he should have beaten JPM (because of the two missed races), if he goes to Renault over Williams. Certainly, if things play out similarly with AU quali and the timing.']",15,12,0.63,15,52,52,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
