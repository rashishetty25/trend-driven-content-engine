Will it be this week? I don't know. Too much depends on how other people do. I don't think people should overreact to practice times though."", 'Translation and full article:\n\n> **McLaren is the team to beat, even on the second-fastest track on the calendar. Red Bull is back within one lap, Ferrari is better than its lap times suggest, and Mercedes is still searching for its form. The practice analysis.**\n\n> McLaren is playing with the competition in Jeddah. The lead of the day\'s fastest driver, Lando Norris, over Max Verstappen isn\'t huge at 0.280 seconds, but you always get the impression that the McLaren drivers still have something up their sleeve. Both drivers eased off the throttle shortly before the finish line. And neither had optimal laps.\n\n> But who had that in the evening hours of the first day of practice? The Ferrari drivers had to repeatedly abort their attempts. They\'re better than fourth and 13th place for Leclerc and Hamilton, respectively. George Russell in the Mercedes also didn\'t navigate the traffic optimally. Andrea Kimi Antonelli was slowed by a wall kiss. Pierre Gasly surprised everyone with a fastest time in the first practice session and lacked some grip in the second. In the long runs, however, the Alpine was the second strongest driver in the field.\n\n> Traffic on the Jeddah Corniche Circuit is just as big a problem as it is in Monte Carlo. The difference is that the cars are traveling much faster. Time and again, there were hair-raising evasive maneuvers. The section between Turns 4 and 8 is particularly dangerous. All blind corners, with hardly any room to maneuver. Q1, with 20 cars on the track, will be a challenge for everyone. Even one of the big drivers could get caught out, especially since warming up the tires is causing major problems for everyone.\n\n> Yuki Tsunoda\'s accident ended the long runs eight minutes before the checkered flag, leaving only short runs. Max Verstappen completed the longest distance with seven consecutive laps.\n\n> This was frustrating for the teams. The endurance runs in the afternoon heat were irrelevant, and the evening race simulations were too short to draw any definitive conclusions about tire durability. Since Pirelli supplied a level of softer tires this year, the teams are missing important information for their race strategy. McLaren boss Zak Brown, however, could still envision a one-stop race with medium tires at the start and hard tires at the finish.\n\n> **Who beats McLaren?**\nThe answer must be: none. Neither McLaren driver had optimal laps and were still in the lead. Lando Norris had to overtake two drivers in Turn 13 and managed to gain a tenth on his second attempt. By then, his tires had already lost grip. Oscar Piastri clipped the wall.\n\n> The two-time season winner demonstrated with his four-lap long run that McLaren will be in a class of its own in the race, even more so than in qualifying. His average time of 1:33.949 minutes remained unmatched.\n\n> Next best was Pierre Gasly with a time of 1:34.539 minutes. Even though Gasly only finished eighth in the second practice session, the Alpine driver could give McLaren\'s rivals Red Bull, Ferrari, and Mercedes a run for their money. And not just because of his strong long run. In the first practice session, with track temperatures reaching 50 degrees Celsius, Gasly set the fastest time. ""We were lacking a bit of grip in the evening,"" explained the Frenchman.\n\n> **Is Red Bull back on track?**\nThe track suits Red Bull, even though Max Verstappen again complained of understeer in slow corners and oversteer in fast corners in the first practice session. However, on the smooth asphalt, the tires don\'t suffer as much as they did in Bahrain. In the cool evening hours, the Red Bulls were almost back to normal. Verstappen lost almost three-tenths of a second on the fastest time and was best of the rest. Only in the race simulation does the situation continue to look bleak. McLaren is an average of 1.1 seconds faster.\n\n> Sporting Director Helmut Marko reveals: ""We made significant changes to the car between practice sessions and tried out a new setup. It worked very well on a single lap, even though we still lost two to three tenths to the McLarens. We were too slow in the long runs. That\'s where our old problem caught up with us: the tires overheat. We now have to find a compromise between maintaining the speed on a single lap and better protecting the tires in the race.""\n\n> Yuki Tsunoda is getting better and better at the Red Bull, finishing sixth, only four-tenths behind his team captain. His positive impression was dampened eight minutes before the finish line. Tsunoda\'s left front wheel touched the wall on the inside of the final corner and slid into the concrete wall on the opposite side. Marko nevertheless praised his number two: ""The speed is good, and the gap to Max is absolutely pleasing.""\n\n(1/2)', 'Is the answer to a headline that ends with a question mark typically ""no""?', 'Norris did say at the start of the year that at the rate these regs have closed the pack up, the midfield will be joining the top teams by the end of this year.\xa0', 'If the favorites are Haas or Sauber.', 'Sauber upgrades are doing something. Please just get a clean quali, Nico', ""They have a good chassis for sure, they were matching the McLarens in some corners in Bahrain.\n\nI'm more interested to see what they can do in Monaco."", 'Absolutely not.\n\nIs this season already so boring that journalists try to spin a narrative out of an FP2 session?

The new car is as good as a Mercedes or Red Bull under the best of circumstances. However, it lacks consistency.**\n\n> You have to look very closely for Ferrari\'s good moments this season. Lewis Hamilton\'s sprint victory in Shanghai. Charles Leclerc\'s second place on the grid in Bahrain. The two Ferrari drivers\' solid middle stints at the same race. ""A good stint or a highlight isn\'t enough to win. We need more consistency,"" demands team principal Frédéric Vasseur.\n\n> The bottom line is that the disappointments outweigh the disappointments. The poor performance of the red cars in the rain in Melbourne. The disqualification of both cars in Shanghai. The 16-second gap to the winning trio at the Japanese GP, in a race in which everyone was able to drive 53 laps at the limit because their tires barely wore down. The two to four-tenths gap to McLaren. Vasseur sees the Papaya racers as one step ahead of everyone else.\n\n> Although Ferrari had the best car in the second half of the 2024 season, the engineers changed the concept over the winter. The old SF-24 with its pushrod front axle was reaching its limits. The aerodynamicists saw no room to squeeze more out of the underbody.\n\n> **Old car was at its limit.**\nA pullrod front axle, on the other hand, allows the airflow towards the rear to be configured in such a way that, ultimately, more downforce can be produced. But that\'s precisely where Ferrari is currently struggling. ""We don\'t have a further development of last year\'s model, but rather a new car. It will take time until we find the right car balance for all conditions,"" the team principal apologizes.\n\n> Leclerc is on the right track. Last year\'s third-place finisher in the World Championship knows the team inside and out, and he has a reference point in mind with the old car. After Suzuka, Leclerc said with relief: ""I think I\'ve now found a way to get more out of the car with the setup."" The eight-time GP winner also made it clear: ""To beat McLaren, we need more upgrades.""\n\n> Lewis Hamilton isn\'t quite there yet. The team\'s newcomer is still experimenting too much. ""Charles is largely staying true to his setup over the weekend. I\'m still tweaking the car a lot to get a better feel for it. At the same time, I\'m trying to adapt my driving style.""\n\n> **New subfloor opens window.**\nFerrari already introduced a new underbody in Bahrain. It wasn\'t a response to the problems of the early races, but it did address a weak point of the SF-25 that the engineers had apparently already been aware of. Compared to its predecessor, the working window has been significantly narrowed. Ideally, Ferrari would have to run extremely low everywhere, but that\'s not possible because it would otherwise cause excessive wear on the underbody.\n\n> The new underbody is intended to open up this window somewhat and deliver the same downforce across a wider setup range. Bahrain was a small first step forward, according to Vasseur. But more such steps must follow. ""We have the ingredients for a good car, we just need to put them together correctly at the right time. I have the feeling that Mercedes and Red Bull, and usually one of the two McLarens, aren\'t doing any better.""\n\n> Vasseur is annoyed that defeats are often portrayed as major dramas. ""We\'re talking about a tenth of a second here, one way or the other. That made five starting positions in Bahrain. One tiny mistake is enough, and you either look good or bad. Red Bull wins in Suzuka and trails in Bahrain. But it\'s still the same car.""', ""We're consistently inconsistent. We're already there"", '""Next year"" has been pretty consistent theme for the past decade.', 'Same old Ferrari excuses. \n\nI feel sorry for Lewis and Charles. At least Lewis already has 7 titles and is a GOAT but Charles has no titles and with Max on the grid, he could end up retiring with no titles which will be one of the most terrible things of the sport.', 'The SF-25  has serious design flaws. Its the only top car that is struggling with ride height this year. Those were the kind of issues that teams solved back in 2023.\n\nThe 24 Ferrari was an extremely well balanced car. How the fuck did they mess this up so badly?\n\nEven Leclerc is complaining about the car being extremely tricky to drive. So Hamilton struggling is not really a surprise.\n\nIMO, Ferrari should write this season off and just focus on the new regs. The gap to Mclaren is just too big.', 'They are consistent. \n\nConsistently underwhelming.', 'And i seek happiness... not in life general but in Ferrari doing good in F1 .... both are so far away from reality...']",104,30,0.96,104,28,28,11,2,0.010000000000000009,11

They’re often seen looking at monitors in front of them…..but what’s actually on those screens? Are they looking at data graphs comparing their laps to the leader or to their teammate? Do the teams have access to all drivers’ data instantly, or just their own and their teammate’s?

Can the drivers interact with the data themselves, or is it the engineers guiding them through it? Are they watching onboards from other cars, or their own lap. Also, are they constantly talking with their engineers during that time, or just staying focused and quiet?

Just curious what goes on during those moments in the garage that we don’t really hear much about.","['data-graphs, probably against team-mate/leader, showing where they are slower/faster, and some info on why such as throttle/braking.', 'Max is sim racing.', 'Data', 'Data, and pretty sure they can also show their previous lap or that of their teammate to analyse', 'I wonder what Max compares his data with.', 'So all drivers data is immediately available to all teams?', 'Playing minecraft', 'You probably mean telemetry']",29,15,0.94,29,14,14,29,15,0.94,29

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.
