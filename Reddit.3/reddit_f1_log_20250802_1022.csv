In 2023, I recall how McLaren had a significant jump in performance mid-season, going from a midfield team to a consistent podium contender.

I‚Äôm curious if Ferrari, Mercedes, or Red Bull seem to have that in the cards this year, as it appeared that even McLaren in 2023 was not expecting the significant jump, which has also evolved into their dominance this year. I‚Äôm also cognizant that the regulation changes may mean that there is just less performance to get out of the car in 2025, than there was in ‚Äò22 or ‚Äò23.

Most changes on the sporting regulations are to largely bring them into line with the most recent updates (2025/04/30) of the 2025 regulations. Including the tyre regulations we had for Monaco this year.      
Some changes I did notice from a quick glance:       

* Grid drops at a driver's next race now have a 12 month period to serve them in. So Valtteri will be off the hook from his incident in the 2024 Abu Dhabi GP should he race next year.

* A document will be provided to all teams no later than the 30th June this year which details all the provisional information and limitations in regards to ERS-K usage and deployment for races, the following season. Any amendments will be confirmed by 15th September. Subsequent modifications may only be applied for new circuits or where this is a significant difference between vehicle fundamentals & FIA correlated values

* There is now a much easier to read list of Parc Ferme Permitted Works

I'm sure there are more. Same as well with the technical regulations.","[""\\>Grid drops at a driver's next race now have a 12 month period to serve them in.\n\nJenson Button return confirmed."", 'W for Bottas my fucking guy', 'Adding a couple of points:\n\nThere are some changes to the limited components. Gearboxes have been made unlimited this year, and that will now be carried over to next year\'s cars. And there will be a new limited component group, PU-ANC (ancillary components), with a limit of 5 of each Power Unit ancillary component. So those should be specific components that are part of, for example, the ICE, but can now be changed without changing the ICE itself.\n\nAnd regarding energy management, I noticed that in the last issue of the regulations, **for qualifying only**, they increased the limit to the total allowable reduction of driver maximum power demand from 450kW to 600kW and the limit to the resulting electrical DC power of the ERS-K from above ‚àí100kW to above -250kW.\n\nWith this newest issue, the ""for qualifying only"" part has been removed. So these limits should now apply at all times.', 'The total power reduction under full throttle is now allowed to be 600 kW instead of 450 kW at all times, not just for qualifying as in the recent rule change.

Lewis Hamilton took to the track with the SF-25 set with the maximum downforce, then with the rear wing and the beam wing used in Monte Carlo. His teammate instead chose a minor step, focusing on the mid-high-load rear wing of Barcelona and a beam wing with the second unloading element. Charles Leclerc immediately found a good balance and feeling with the car, although the track is not one of his favorites, having to fight only with a bit of oversteer. The increasing grip of the track will certainly help, in addition to the refinements of setup between Friday and Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe choice was also confirmed in the second free practice session, with Lewis Hamilton converting to that of choice. Waxing and beam wing therefore for the seven-time world champion, who, however, did not find the same answers as the Monegasque. In the fast lap he paid a not indifferent gap. On the long run, carried out with the Soft (Leclerc with the average) he had a good pace and even a fair amount of consistency, but via radio he complained a lot about ‚Äúthe balance is dangerous‚Äù, he told his track engineer, Riccardo Adami. Looking at the onboards, beyond the times, we saw an SF-25 more nervous for him and that from understeer to center-curved ‚Äì mainly the wide-ranging slow curves ‚Äì turned into violent snaps of the outgoing rear. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a long way from being on the tracks,‚Äù Hamilton said at the end of the day. ‚ÄúCharles is fast, but I‚Äôm not and I don‚Äôt have a good balance yet.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAfter and during the FP1 the Englishman complained of lack of front load, with the car felt by the Englishman too understeer. For the second session of Friday, therefore, he had tried to align the choices between the two drivers with the grade 4 wing, a little more discharge, but which did not greatly improve the driving feeling of the Englishman. From the images collected by the pit-lane this morning the car number 44 is inside the garages with the maximum load configuration, which would suggest that the evening briefing has led the Ferrari technicians to take a step back and go back to a more loaded setup the number 44. So, except for last-minute trim changes, Hamilton will return to the track with the most loaded setup in the FP3, which could also help him in case of rain on Sunday. The front wing instead is of the same specification, with the riders who can then adjust the request of the setup, with the last flap to which a rather often and evident nolder remains integrated, to meet the technical requirements of the Hungaroring, with the need to have a lot of front load.', 'This is eother gonna be a Hamilton masterclass or disasterclass', 'Now he will have too much oversteer and he will lose the rear.

Is there a reason why this would be more prevalent? Conditions looked dry, most drivers know the track well, I don‚Äôt think it has been re-profiled. Is there something about the current regs/cars which makes it more likely?

It's more common than you think."", ""It makes sense. Every event (even if same track) is different. Track isn't rubbered in, tire compounds change (year to year), changes in car suspension, different aero loads,  etc. This is exactly why there are practice sessions - so that drivers can explore the limits. FP1 is not about setting the fastest or cleanest laps. \n\nT1 has good run off w/o hazards (so very little risk going off) it is a heavy braking zone and pretty much every driver starts their run on the pit straight. Drivers don't have to play safe coming into it and tires are not always up to temp.
