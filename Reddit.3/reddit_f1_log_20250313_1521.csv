Before anyone jumps on me‚ÄîI'm not saying Lewis isn't an all-time great. His legacy is undeniable. But if we‚Äôre talking about pure performance *right now*, I feel like Russell has the edge.

Over the past couple of seasons, we've seen Russell consistently match or even outperform Lewis in both qualifying and races. Yes, there have been some mistakes, but his raw pace and adaptability seem stronger. Meanwhile, Lewis has had flashes of brilliance, but he hasn‚Äôt looked as dominant or as sharp as he did in previous years.

Maybe it's down to motivation, car development preferences, or just the natural changing of the guard. But from what I've seen, Russell is extracting more out of the car last season.

This year, the draft reached a point where teams were faced with choosing either a rookie/young driver in a fast car (Lawson, Antonelli) or a veteran driver in a lesser car (Alonso, Sainz). Then it was down to a pool of veteran and rookie drivers in questionable cars (Hulk, Ocon, Gasly, Hadjar, Doohan, Bearman).

Wondering what you all thought would be a better strategy - rookie in a fast car or veteran in a (likely) slower car?","['If Lawson or Antonelli finished behind Alonso or Sainz it would be a major disappointment. Even with a terrible season, Checo scored more than double the points of 9th place.\n\nAnd IDK, Gasly might have been a good choice there, maybe even above Alonso', ""F1 is first and foremost an engineering competition. I'd always side with the car."", 'A terrible lap time differential (average) across teammates would be in the region of 0.5 seconds even with one vastly experienced team mate against a rookie.\n\nThe lap time differential in the race between the top teams to the worst teams is in the order of 1+ seconds. \n\nSo clearly rookie in a good car is the optimal choice.', ""Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‚Äòtake a monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.‚Äô \n\nSo: Car >> Driver. The driver can make a big difference only if the margins are tight. This year they will be, at least among the tiers, but a midfield veteran won't often beat a frontrunning team's rookie."", 'Uh‚Ä¶ how is this a question? \n\nThe faster car obviously. Why do you think Bearman finished P7 in Jeddah?', 'Good car every day of the week', 'the best drivers will get the most out of a given car, but the car is still something like 80% of the equation', 'The fact that Sainz and Alonso can both \xa0be classed as veterans is crazy.. Like Alonso was literally Sianzs idol.', ""Depends how the league works. If it's just giving points based on how the drivers do in the championship, then you'd 100% be better choosing rookies in good cars as they'd have to massively underperform to finish behind any of the drivers in lesser cars""]",0,35,0.43,0,287,287,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0

So if everything is equal, since we can't predict what would have happened with cars in other places, could McLaren have secured a win for Norris by just not screwing up the strategies?","['Its always if, if, if you know? If my mom had balls she would‚Äôve been my dad', 'Could? Yes there was enough points on the table.\n\nHow easy would it have realistically been, it would have needed a pretty flawless run of about 15 races from Norris, and Verstappen would still have held the significant points advantage to play around with.', ""It wasn't close at any point. There wasn't a stretch of races where McLaren could be dominant and Norris could've racked five, six wins in a row to deplete Max's advantage built in the beginning of the year.\n\nNorris could've won the WDC if he and McLaren were perfect Miami onwards, but that wasn't the case. And we shouldn't expect a team that two years ago started with one of the worst cars of the grid and a driver who hadn't even won his first race before last year to be absolutely perfect to chase a 80+ point lead."", 'This is the problem with ""could haves"" and ""ifs"". Sure, Norris *could* have been the driver\'s champion if a bunch of shit happened differently. Zhou *could* also have replaced Lewis at Merc if a bunch of shit happened differently', 'It would have been the biggest comeback in f1 history.\n\nIt was doable, but it would have been such an outstanding achievement that no one in the history of the sport has ever achieved.', ""Realistically, no. People glommed onto the mathematical possibility in hopes of a run to the end, the reality is that but despite RBR's decline, they were still too consistent to overcome.\n\nWhen you're in the latter half of the season and still hoping for DNFs to swing the championship, you've already lost. Even if you win, it's going to be a freak fluke."", 'No. Too much went wrong for him to be able to get to a point where he had a realistic shot at winning it. \n\nFirstly McLaren didn‚Äôt have the car to compete until Miami and even then it was still sometimes hit and miss on pace. DTS I know illustrates it as if he had been underperforming until Miami. The truth was that there was no Miami car until Miami. Some days it was the fastest and it was dominant, others it was second fastest, other times it was muddling about in P5. The consistency wasn‚Äôt good enough on a technical level. When the Red Bull was dominant, it was *dominant*. When the McLaren was dominant it did so in bursts but could easily fall back behind Red Bull/Ferrari/Mercedes depending on the track and conditions. That‚Äôs where Max‚Äôs points comfort came from. \n\nSecondly, Norris‚Äô own shortcomings. Granted it was a massive learning curve for someone who started the year hanging around the bottom of the top 5 and ended it with 4 race wins and 8 pole positions. However he was not consistent enough when he needed to be. Would it have been enough to overhaul the points difference? Probably not. Even when he had perfect weekends, Max was right there behind him making it so no matter how far ahead he finished, if Max was P2 (as he often was) it didn‚Äôt make enough of a dent. Also when Max had off days, Norris also had off days (Spa, Baku, Hungary, Monza) so he was never really able to capitalise on those moments.\n\nThirdly, the McLaren pitwall. Sometimes the strategy was just so bad. How can you save a new medium for *a specific situation*, have that situation handed to you on a plate *and still* mess it up? There were times where the pitwall was static, as if they were unable to react to the situation in front of them and deviate from their pre-planned simulation. They were unable to decide what to do in Canada in particular which ended up costing him a win. But when it wasn‚Äôt the strategy it was that race engineer of his giving the wrong information or completely missing a double yellow flag that his driver didn‚Äôt know about because he was driving with tunnel vision. \n\nFinally, Max had nothing to lose if he crashed into Lando. He knew that. The points cushion was so significant that he could afford to play silly games knowing Lando needed the points more and had much more to lose with McLaren chasing the constructors title. \n\nCould he have been WC in 2024? No, there was too much against him including himself.', ""Honestly? No. \n\nDTS highlights McLaren's mistakes for drama but all teams make them, they're not something you can 100% solve for. \n\nMy personal opinion is that McLaren knowingly went for the constructors and removing 'papaya rules' when they did was just a bonus round if anything. Even if they didn't make any mistakes a lot would have had to go right for them at that stage of the season for Lando to have overtaken Max and stay there.\n\nI'll be really interested to see if their approach changes this year should their performance hold."", ""if you swap the drivers and their points since miami, sure max would've been champion\n\nBut it was landos first rodeo and its a bit unfair to expect that of him, but also winning in that car isnt a herculean task, nando, hamilton could've done it 100% and probably russel and leclerc etc""]",0,42,0.18,0,311,311,0,0,0.0,0
