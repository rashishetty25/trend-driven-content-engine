i would like to buy my boyfriend tickets for the upcoming f1 season as a valentines day gift.

which race would you guys suggest will be the most entertaining to watch? he likes ferarri but doesn't exclusively root for one team or player. 

I personally want watch the monza race but i read online that it is a harder circuit for overtakes. and as far as I noticed from the few races i have watched - the overtakes are the most fun part 😅

","[""Since you mentioned Monza I assume it will be Europe only, so I'd say if you want the highest chance of having a good race go to Silverstone or the Red Bull Ring.\n\nFun also means something else for everybody. I guess it depends what you guys value in a trip to a GP."", 'Only ever been to one race, Silverstone, but the crowd is really what makes it. Fantastic atmosphere and camaraderie.', ""Honestly, with something this big, I'd suggest talking to him and getting his opinion. Unless he really likes you planning multi-day trips without his input. I don't know what his life looks like, but he might have to ask for time off work, or other factors might make some tracks make more sense than others.\n\nI'll also say that what makes a race good in person is not necessarily the same thing that makes it good watching from home. At the track, depending on the track, it might be difficult to sit in a place that is likely to have overtakes, and it can still be very entertaining to watch the cars go past. A race that's boring at home might be almost as good in person as a race with lots of overtakes would be. You can also think about what area you would like to visit outside of the track, if you can spend a little extra time there."", 'I think watching a race at the track is a experience on its own. No matter where. Every race i went to i rewatched on tv when i got home as it is hard to follow between the Jumbotron and watch one section of the circuit. I think any race will do for a F1 fan.

I'm sure there are situations that can change the number so I'm basically asking, right now, how many teams you feel F1 should grow/shrink to for maximum health of the sport.

In my opinion F1 should look to target 12 active teams if possible.  I think that's a good number to allow 3-4 to struggle at any given time without majorly impacting the competitiveness of the entire grid and ensuring a competitive midpack, which as we saw in 2023 and  2024 can be vital for the longterm viability of the sport with McLaren and Aston Martin emerging from the midpack to challenge for top positions (and then Aston Martin falling back, but it was still fun while it lasted).

Bottom line in my mind 12 teams is the right number to maintain a healthy midpack from which new challengers for the stop spots might emerge.  This is entirely my own opinion but I'm curious what others think.","[""I think the maximum sustainable number is 13 since it's required for a circuit to be able to accommodate that, but a few probably wouldn't be able to support any more. So circuits would have to change and that would be strenuous for contracts.\n\nI think 12 is a good aim, we've had 12 recently without any issues.\n\nMinimum is probably pretty low, like 7 or 8, but that's an absolute minimum and not ideal"", 'Definitely more than 3, that gives 2005 US GP vibes.\n\nAPXGP made it 11 teams, are you saying they don’t count?', ""10 Seemed to work well, and I would think that's the minimum.

Sure, there used to be more in the past, but cars were smaller.\nI think the safety concern is the main aspect. 12 teams is a stretch, 14 is ridiculous.\nThe number of teams should not be determined by the number of teams who should be allowed to struggle.\nRacing is good with 20 cars.
