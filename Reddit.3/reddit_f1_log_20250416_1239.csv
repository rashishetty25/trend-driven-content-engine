1k0ds0q,How F-ducts worked - and an aero detail not discussed previously,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k0ds0q/how_fducts_worked_and_an_aero_detail_not/,2025-04-16, Technical,"As has been well covered in the past - the F-duct system was introduced in 2010 by McLaren (and later adopted in varying forms by other teams). It was a clever way of achieving drag reduction without movable aerodynamic devices - skirting the regulations by using driver input to trigger a ""fluidic"" switch hidden away inside the engine cover.

I thought I'd write up a post explaining how this system worked aerodynamically, having seen it's development, testing, and eventual deployment firsthand.

**Fluidics: a quick background**

Fluidics is a whole discipline of its own, similar to the fields of mechanics and electronics. Fluidic systems use the properties of fluids (i.e. liquids and gases) to create logical systems free from electronic or mechanical influence. Within the fluidic world we have devices like logic gates, amplifiers, oscillators, etc - the same things you'd find in the mechanical and electronic counterpart worlds. You can therefore build different systems and solve for many different use cases using these fluidic devices. Great little intro paper [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19730002533/downloads/19730002533.pdf) from NASA talks about many different use cases that fluidics have seen in the world of aerospace.

Now that we know that fluidics are essentially the aero counterpart to mechanical and/or electrical systems, it's easy to then connect the dots and see what sort of clever loopholes a fluidic system could open up in a set of rules and regulations that were written with mechanical and/or electrical devices in mind. It is also worth noting that it was exactly this sort of ""what is the X analogue of Y"" logic that led to the inerter (""J-damper""), another famous F1 innovation which is the mechanical equivalent of an electronic capacitor. No surprise to note that it was also McLaren that brought this innovation to F1 first, shortly after it's invention.

**Coming back to F-Ducts**

If moveable aero regulations banned *mechanical* switches to change the aero behaviour of the car, they didn't (initially) ban *aerodynamic* switches. And the lowest hanging fruit seem to be in shedding drag in straight line conditions - something where an on/off switch would be a perfect use case for fluidics.

At its core, the F-duct worked by stalling the rear wing - similar in outcome to the DRS. However, the F-Duct did this purely aerodynamically (no rotating flaps) by injecting ducted flow perpendicular to the normal airflow on the rear wing flap (and later at the mainplane, to have a larger stall effect) to trigger separation of the boundary layer, creating a stall and dump downforce and therefore the induced drag that comes with it.

**Basic function**

The system used internal ducting to channel air from an inlet (usually at the nose or via a slot at the top of the airbox) to the rear wing. When the system was activated - typically by the driver blocking or unblocking a duct with their hand or leg - the airflow would be directed to a slot in the rear wing's surface, triggering the stall.

Most F-duct systems had two possible outlet paths:

1. A default, low-energy path that always exited the ducted flow harmlessly out of what RBR called the ""donkey d\*ck"" - a long horizontal outlet at the back of the engine cover.
2. A stall path that redirected flow up through the rear wing and out the slot perpendicular to the rear wing surface when the duct was activated

https://preview.redd.it/5dmiy3gq45ve1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=398d21a33d2676999f8aab72551978aae3446610

**The need for a reliable switch**

Early testing showed that the system did not initially have a fully binary switching behaviour: even when a majority of the flow was going into the default outlet, some flow would end up in the stall outlet, negatively impacting rear wing performance when the wing should be operating at 'normal' load (e.g. in cornering). Similarly, switching the system on and off and back on again showed signs of aerodynamic hysteresis - a phenomenon that basically means that a sort of aerodynamic lag. If blocking the driver control duct caused a rear wing stall, simply unblocking the duct wouldn't be enough to cause the rear wing to recover. Not good.

**The vortex trap**

The solution to this, aside from a lot of fine-tuning, was the introduction of a small but crucial aerodynamic feature that was added to the switch, and was intentionally hidden via a vanity panel - though I'm sure others figured this out quickly too since this detail is present in a lot of fluidic research literature. This feature was the semi-circular vortex trap at the junction of the two outlet paths. Here sat a trapped vortex that would help stabilise the flow going to the default outlet when the stall switch was deactivated. It would reverse it's rotation when the stall switch was activated, thereby helping stabilise flow going to the stall path.

What this did was quite elegant:

* When the system wasn’t activated, the donkey d\*ck was the low-resistance path, and the vortex acted as a sort of buffer that prevented any significant bleed to the stall slot, keeping it aerodynamically “quiet"". The counter-clockwise rotation of the vortex encouraged all flow from the inlet duct to head down the non-stall pathway.

https://preview.redd.it/b8s7e46t45ve1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5115a0bfc409d03669048b05c3e60a7f1e2dfe6

* When the control duct was activated by the driver, there was upwards flow at the switch that caused the vortex to reverse its rotation, encouraging all the flow to head to the stall duct. The vortex would now stabilise this new flow path, again insulating it from the now dormant donkey d\*ck path.

https://preview.redd.it/qnl4uvtt45ve1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcdb094f9032f9d4aeab758689526e8206887819

This meant the system behaved like a bistable switch - very stable in both modes (stall on or stall off). There was very little dynamic pressure or cross-talk in the non-active duct, which was key for predictable and stable rear wing stall/unstall transitions.

It was a small detail - but a good example of how in F1, even a small change in duct geometry can make or break the whole system.","[""Wow, I didn't know how much I didn't know about F-ducts.\xa0 Thanks for this detailed and fascinating post!"", 'Interesting read, thank you very much!', 'I love the way it got it\'s name.

The downside is that he would still be “only” 22 years old by then.\n\nPiastri: if McLaren hypothetically chooses Norris over time as their number 1 driver, then I could see Piastri going to Ferrari for that reason.

With Imola out, it's possible we finally get a brief North American two-parter instead of the Canadian GP interrupting the European leg.\n* Monaco to open the European section of the calendar, then some permutation of Madrid/Barcelona/Spielberg/Silverstone/Hungary/Spa up to the summer break.\n* Zandvoort sings its swan song before the calendar goes to Monza, to wrap up the European leg.\n* The last eight or so races are roughly in the same order as 2024 and 2025 - that is, Baku, Singapore, Austin, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Las Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi.\n\nThis is all assuming no circuits get dropped besides Imola, and no circuits get added besides Madrid."", 'Are individual F1 teams allowed to release/license their own games?

If they’re competitive and he is too them he’ll probably stay another year.\xa0\n\nSo the options in my opinion are intersting. Bearman is the obvious one but I’m going to go against the grain and say he struggled in a very poor Haas in 2026 and is beaten handily by Ocon. This will mean Ferrari might go for someone else.\xa0\n\nNow the old Ferrari would have gone for an experienced driver (Leclerc was like the first young driver they ever signed).\xa0\n\nSo who are our options?\xa0\n\nI genuinely think Sainz would be still on their radar. He was the perfect number two driver for Ferrari bar him occasionally going against team orders. Though he never did anything too extreme. And the fact he left gracefully means he could potentially return. That said, if Albon bosses Sainz then he could be on the radar instead.\xa0\n\nGasly is another one. I think he’d work well with Leclerc and along with Ocon, he has been the star of the midfield for the last five years. Honestly his career is actually really similar to Sergio Perez’s imo. Impresses super well in small team. Goes to big team amd flops. Returns to midfield and gets loads of podiums and is always getting great results in a midfield car. And then like Perez he could get a seat at one of the big teams again towards the end of his career.\n\nNow whats interesting about these options in my opinion is that there is a chance if Merc do build a very very string engine in 2026 Williams and whatever Alpine are called by that stage could actually be better cars than Ferrari. So would one of the drivers step down to the 6th faster car? In that case Bearman is a more obvious pick after all.\n\nAnd finally there is one other name to throw in. This rely’s on a few unlikely events happening but if they do this is on the cards.\xa0\n\nMax Verstappen.\n\nNow for this to happen I think we would need Max to take a sabbatical after this season which is unlikely but not impossible.\xa0\n\nHe is seemingly not happy with Red Bull atm and with good reason. He is also unhappy with the FIA. And he is goimg to have a child. Perhaps he will want to spend a year with his new daughter for a year and stay away from what could be a shitshow in 2026. Then with a Ferrari seat on offer could Ferrari come out with a Leclerc/ Verstappen line up for 2027?\xa0\n\nThat’s my bold prediction.\xa0\n\nOnly thing is it is kinda similar to the Alonso/Button line up that was wasted away at McLaren Honda.

The increased power of the battery component will be a fascinating watch too, especially with Honda having come along way from what happened in 2015.\n\nSomething that also is quietly going under the radar is the fact that Aston Martin will be able to build around the engine as to how they want.

1k0hh8g,An idea for safety car pit stops,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k0hh8g/an_idea_for_safety_car_pit_stops/,2025-04-16, Discussion,"We saw it to some degree in Bahrain and we’ve seen it numerous times in the past where a safety car/VSC has been deployed in the middle of a pit stop cycle and gifted the drivers who are yet to it a cheap stop. 

This has a double knock-on effect on those who stopped early. Firstly, not only do they lose track position, but they then have a tyre disadvantage to those who have jumped ahead of them for the remainder of the race, and if it impacts a fight for the lead, it can ruin any suspense over who will win when second place is catapulted into first with tyres that are five laps fresher.

To me, there’s a simple solution to all this. You work out the time gained by pitting under the safety car and apply an automatic penalty to those who pit to keep the time gaps level. 

For example, at a track where normal pit stop would cost you 20 seconds, but a safety car/VSC pit stop would only cost you ten, any driver who pits under it would have to wait in the pit box for ten seconds before the mechanics can touch the car. The time stopped varies from circuit to circuit depending on the actual time loss. 

Now the one main counter-argument I foresee in the comments here is that this would impact on teams double stacking, so simply, the ten seconds of a driver forced to wait starts the moment he stops behind his teammate, not once he’s stopped in the pit box.

The theory behind it is it keeps the running order and time gaps as they would have been had the race not been neutralised and stops drivers from being unfairly penalised/boosted based on when they stopped. Anyone who does pit under the safety car would still have a tyre advantage, so it hopefully wouldn’t deter teams from gambling on strategy.","['Pitstops literally exist to add strategy to racing. And with strategy comes luck.\n\nWe have the technology. They could fuel the cars up and slap on super hard tires and eliminate pitstops all together. Combine that with VSCs totally eliminating safety cars and the gaps never change ever. \n\nIs it pure unaffected racing? Sure. would it be boring as fuck? Absolutely.', 'Hard pass on this. It’s part of the race.', 'Nah, sometimes you get delt a bad hand. Just have to roll with it.', 'Its part of racing.  People hold on hoping for a safety car so they can get the cheap pit stop but therefore take the hit with longer stint and worse deg before hand and this may never come.. Any change would take away the bet', 'Safety cars happen. \n\nNo one is asking for this and you spent way too much time on it.', "">Firstly, not only do they lose track position, but they then have a tyre disadvantage to those who have jumped ahead of them for the remainder of the race, and if it impacts a fight for the lead, it can ruin any suspense over who will win when second place is catapulted into first with tyres that are five laps fresher.\n\nThat's the gamble you take.\n\n>You work out the time gained by pitting under the safety car and apply an automatic penalty to those who pit to keep the time gaps level.\n\nSo you're penalising drivers for not doing anything wrong? Sure, that will be popular."", 'This would be incredibly boring', 'Hard pass', ""Stop trying to fix something that isn't broken.""]",0,56,0.04,0,51,51,0,36,-0.04,0
