It made me think about what this actually means for racing.

2026 F1 cars will have a 9 MJ battery powering a 350 kW electric motor, but the battery can’t be fully recharged every lap even with all the energy recovered during braking.

Even top tracks with strong braking zones only give back about 7-8 MJ to the battery, less than what the 9 MJ pack needs. Drivers can’t rely on using maximum electric power all the time without draining the battery.

On long straights, the battery drains quickly and regen can’t keep up. Teams will have to manage energy carefully and save electric power for key parts of the lap instead of using it continuously.

This limitation makes the new hybrid systems more strategic in racing, when and how you use electric power could decide battles and lap times.

Will this energy management create more strategy and uncertainty, or just become standard race management?","['Even as it is, it takes a lap to build up to have a shot at overtaking every 2nd lap. This will make it every 3rd.', ""They obviously won't deploy maximum power all the time and will have to get used to managing when they want to use all the power they have and when they don't.   \n\nOne thing that interests me more is if the massive amount of electric torque available now makes the motor mapping a sort of back-door traction control, or if the FIA has already thought around it."", ""It'll be like Top Gear. Where you have to save the nitro boost for the best parts of the track."", 'Not sure I understand this correctly, but the battery delta SOC should be 4MJ whilst the energy recovery limit is at most 9MJ, usually 8.5MJ.\n\nIt could indeed be challenging to recover enough energy under braking, they will likely burn some fuel for that as well. There are also a number of regulatory deployment limitations to manage the battery around the lap. things like limits to how much power they can deploy at what speeds, how fast they can reduce that power and how much they can recharge under full throttle.', 'In theory it will be a fun variable to the racing. On any given lap, two cars battling for position will have different amounts of horsepower available.', 'they will be using the mgu-k to generate on throttle too - possibly out of corners for TC of sorts but mostly towards the end of straights like the mgu-h does already - some tracks they will definitely not have enough fuel to do this every lap though.', 'there will probably be a lot of clipping', ""They are expected to recover energy directly from the crank when you're not on max throttle. You could charge the battery off the engine itself by keeping the engine torque higher than it should be at a given rpm and harvesting the surplus into the battery. It will consume more fuel but you'll have more overall energy from the battery which will be critical to traction coming out of corners. It won't be enough at most circuits to have full deployment available at all times but it should be enough to avoid dramatic slowing on the straights."", 'My biggest gripe with this is that it will diminish pure racing. More and more F1 is becoming an engineering and strategy sport, where the best drivers also have to be race managers to have a shot at winning anything. There’s a slim chance that this could give us more exciting racing because it might promote far more strategies than now, but more exciting isn’t necessarily better.', 'ferrari practicing lift and cost this year to be ready for next year :3']",70,29,0.86,70,29,29,70,29,0.86,70

Edit: thank you all for the feedback and suggestions. I should probably point out that I already purchased an f1tv subscription as well. ","[""ChainBear on YOuTube has a lot of very instructional videos. Pretty graphics, explanations for the lay person.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@chainbear\n\nBut at a certain point you just gotta watch the race. There's not a lot that can be distilled into a short post. \n\nIt's a racing series where the main differentiator is that the Teams or Constructors need to build the *majority* of the car themselves (as opposed to a spec series where everyone has the same car).\n\nSome teams build their own engines and are considered 'works' teams, other teams buy an engine from Merc / Renault / Honda / Ferrari are are 'customer teams'. \n\nThere is a Constructor championship (team) and a Driver championship (individual), so you get lots of drama where what's good for the team is bad for the individual. \n\nEvery race requires 2 sets of tyre compounds, so you see different strategies."", 'That’s awesome first of all that your son is interested and you might have a cool father-son activity together.\n\nI would go to YouTube, and just look up videos explaining things about F1 for new viewers. There’s a lot of content. We had an influx of new viewers over the past few years with the Netflix series (Drive to Survive if you feel like checking it out) and the F1 movie. So a lot of channels and outlets put out good explainer videos. \n\nYou can get as deep into it as you want. Some people really immerse into technical details, and some are more casual viewers. But YouTube is definitely the place to learn more.', 'Ahw, this is so cute.  \nThe Formula 1 Youtube channel has a bunch of vids that explain the basics, like ""Beginners Guide to F1"" and  ""Everything you need to know about F1"". If you have any questions you could probably just write them into google and you\'ll find the right answer quickly.

That frustrates us all. :)\n\nAs for what makes it fascinating that'll be different for everyone, of course. For myself it's seeing twenty (currently) drivers who are so talented, fast and consistent that they can lap a difficult track within tenths, hundredths or even thousandths of seconds from each other competing in a sport where every decision is impactful. Tiny mistakes, tiny engineering details, taking a pit stop one lap early or one lap late can all have dramatic consequences.

Qualifying sessions are still thrilling—especially Q3 shootouts where drivers push the limits—but once Sunday rolls around, the excitement fizzles out almost immediately.

The races are often decided in the first 2–3 corners of lap 1. If someone nails the start and defends well through Turn 1 and Turn 2, that’s usually game over unless a safety car shakes things up. And even then, the drama feels manufactured rather than organic. The midfield battles are decent, but that's about it.

Strategy used to be a wildcard—undercuts, tire gambles, late stops—but now even the undercut barely works. Either the tires don’t degrade fast enough, or the pit delta is too punishing. Teams seem locked into one-stop strategies, and the window for creative calls has shrunk to almost nothing. 

DRS trains are back in full force, and unless someone has a massive pace advantage, overtaking is a formality or a non-event.

I’m not saying every race needs to be chaos, but where’s the tension? Where’s the unpredictability? Even dominant seasons in the past had moments of brilliance—weather changes, bold moves, surprise podiums (I know this is after Russel's podium, but let's look at the whole season ). This year feels like a procession with occasional sparks.

Anyone else feeling this? Is it the regulations, the tire compounds, or just a weird lull in competitiveness? I’d love to hear if others are seeing the same pattern—or if I’m just becoming a grumpy fan nostalgic for the chaos of the early 2010s.","[""It's definitely been noticed. A few reasons why the races are predictable:\n\n\\- The cars are extremely close together in raw performance, so the delta's required for overtaking aren't being met\n\n\\-The 2025 tyres are the most durable tyres Pirelli have made since the 2017 ones. As such, most races are easy 1 stoppers\n\n\\- Reliability failures are minimal so no in race drama"", '\nOh, you predicted Hulk and Isaack podiums?
