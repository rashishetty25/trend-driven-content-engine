People in Indy NXT aim for Indy, and/or lack the budget for F2, but the only single-seater series an IndyCar driver would want to go to is F1, and that's not a given (I'm sure people in the F1 paddock have called Palou). There's also the factor of IndyCar giving too few SL points for its level; just ask Colton Herta.\n\nRealistically, the pipeline mostly goes the other way. Look at how many IndyCar drivers started their careers in the feeder series ladder over in Europe, and then there are the ex-F1 drivers."", ""Bringing in a driver from Indycar is difficult. Deliberately so. \n\nMcLaren Indycar driver Pato O'Ward would need 40 super licence points to drive in F1, but his last 3 seasons in Indycar were 5th (8pts), 4th (10pts), and 7th (4pts) giving him a total of just 22 of the 40 points required. Had he got the same results in F2 they would have been 5th (20pts), 4th (30pts), and 7th (8pts) for a total of 58 points and a super licence. Fuck, he'd have got more points getting those results in F3, 5th (12pts), 4th (15pts), and 7th (7pts) for a total of 34 points. \n\nThe FIAs crappy assessment of Indycar results is near mirrored by their view of Superformula.\n\nThe FIA wants drivers to come up through their ranks."", 'IndyCar on Roads is quite similar to F2 in speed.

There is some movement from F2 to SF and one SF champion is currently driving F2, with not much to show for after 1 1/2 seasons. \n\nIndy NXT is plenty fast for a feeder series. It has 450 HP (+50HP for P2P) and decent down force for what it is. It has 70 HP more than F3 and I would say comparable downforce. IndyNXT should be as fast or faster than F3. \n\nF4 is miles away from F3 and Indy NXT.', ""There's multiple reasons why drivers from non F-eeder classes aren't getting the same amount of shots as ones that are in the system.\n\n1: Points. Drivers in the other classes don't get the same amount of points as say, being a top 4 driver in F3 and/or F2 for a few seasons. A recent example being Colton Herta who just missed out on a superlicense despite having very impressive Indycar results.\n\n1.5: To add to that, Indycar (and most series with Americanized point systems) are inherently harder to succeed in. With a much bigger part of the grid getting points, as well as the points differentials being lower between winners and the rest of the top 5, as well as racing being much less prone to success monopoly (rd. one team/driver winning a majority of races due to superior equipment), it's much harder to consistently finish the season in high enough positions to accrue good license points, further exasperated by the lower license points.\n\n2: Feeder bias. The paddock is a small world, and being at the same race weekends as F1 teams has a significant effect on in-paddock perception of drivers and their talent. They're more scouted, there's more attention for them simply by being around major teams all the time. More often than not, many feeder drivers are also part of a young driver programme for one of the F1 teams (As well as often sharing sports agents that are 'in' with F1 teams), so F1 teams have a greater incentive to focus on their own youth than look to drivers outside of their own programmes.\n\n2.5: Also politically speaking, Liberty and the FIA want to prefer the feeder series because they are literally built to feed into F1. Teams structurally ignoring drivers from feeder series would hurt the prestige of the series, make it less marketeable, make young drivers less likely to go through the feeder series, and generally be seen as not being THE way to get into F1. There's a lot of money and corporate stakes at play who want the feeder series to keep its advantages.\n\n3: Level of competition. I won't claim F2 is a superior racing class with superior drivers to Indycar and Super Formula. But generally speaking they have a broader field of international talent, and there's definitely an inherent bias from teams and media towards Feeder series drivers as being better. Localized series with a heavy contingent of local drivers (for example, Super Formula only has 4 non-Japanese drivers this year) feeds the idea that there's less true talent, and thus drivers who don't utterly dominate are seen as inferior than drivers who have reasonable success in F2/F3. It's kinda unfair, but it's a pervasive bias that has existed for a long time.\n\n4: Car/track experience. Whilst Indycar and Super Formula have comparable open-wheel cars, they are very much their own class of cars with their own quirks and limitations. F2 and F3 have specifically been designed around being a ladder towards F1, with rulesets and cars (where reasonable) built around F1 specs. They also race on the same tracks (see point 2) as the F1 teams, so drivers have more track know-how, even though simulator work has become more prevalent, teams appreciate practical experience. It also leans into some of the earlier biases, but a top 4 F2 driver is seen as more F1-Ready than someone coming in from Indycar (where there's also a lot more oval racing that isn't present in F1)\n\nHonestly I agree with you that I would love to see F1 pull in more talent from outside their usual feeder series bubble, but F1 is nothing if not a world of politics and looking inward. The FIA and Liberty would love to see an American driver, but they want 'their' American driver, one they can in some form or fashion can mold as an F1 star and not necessarily one that cut their teeth in Indycar or elsewhere."", 'It is not necessarily speed that you use to measure the differences between races. For example, Indycar races on ovals and success there requires a skill set that is not developed in circuit racing.', 'Super Formula is typically considered a top-tier racing series, despite some teams treating it as a feeder for F1', 'If you want to adapt to go to F1, Super Formula is definitely the right way, for the championship IndyCar is definitely the right one', ""Imo:\n\nIndycar>F2>Super Formula>F3>FRECA>GB3>NXT>Italian F4\n\nIndycar has had some decent F1 and F2 drivers go and not exactly have an easy time so it's probably the best, especially with a load of experienced drivers who've had a lot of success in it.\n\nF2 is the premier junior series in the world so is pretty good.\n\nSuper Formula I've not been too impressed by the Japanese drivers outside of it and F2 level western drivers have been able to go over and compete for the championship immediately on tracks they've never driven on vs drivers who've driven on them for years.\n\nNXT I'm not impressed by at all really, there doesn't seem to be much depth (both in terms of quality and field size) and you don't have to be very good to compete near the front.

So lotus ran with 1 and 2. Tyrrell finished second in 73 so took 3 and 4 for 1974. Tyrrell kept those numbers until the 1990s. 

McLaren finished third and so took numbers 5 and 6 for 1974

And so on. 

Questions: at what point did Williams get car 5/6?

And why did Ferrari get numbers 27 and 28? Going by 1973 standings they’d get 11 and 12 in 1974

","[""The way this worked is that the WDC's team got #1 and #2 and gave its previous numbers to the previous year's WDC team.\n\nFerrari did start out with #11 and #12 in 1974. Scheckter won the WDC in 1979, stayed with the team so Ferrari had #1 and #2 in 1980. Williams (Jones) who had #27 and #28 won the WDC that year, so they were #1 and #2 in 1981 and Ferrari got #27 and #28 from them.\n\nInitially Lotus had #5 and #6 and exchanged those numbers with Brabham in 1979 (Lauda was #1 in 1978, Andretti in 1979). Williams (Jones) had #1 and #2 in 1981 and exchanged numbers with Brabham in 1982 after Piquet had won the WDC. Then #5 and #6 went back and forth between them again in 1983 and 1984."", ""I'm sure someone else will come in with concrete dates, but I believe there was a time when Ferrari paid lower positioned teams so they could run a consistent number, although I forget which years they did this"", ""I believe the 1-2 would always go to the team which had the driver's champion of the previous year and you would swap numbers with the other team if that changed.\n\nFor example:\n\nGoing into 1978 Brabham were #1-2 due Niki Lauda winning the 1977 title with Ferrari and then moving to Brabham.      \nMario Andretti won the 1978 title for Lotus driving number #5.        \nSo in 1979 Lotus took the #1-2 and Brabham inherited the #5-6.      \nIn 1979 Jody Scheckter won for Ferrari using the number #11.       \nSo in 1980 Ferrari took the #1-2 and Lotus inherited the #11-12     \nIn 1980 Alan Jones won for Williams driving number #27.     \nSo in 1981 Williams took the #1-2 and Ferrari inherited the #27-28."", ""The numbers would usually only change depending on what team the reigning WDC drove for, which was usually the same team they won with. The dethroned champion team would take the numbers of the new champions for the following season.\n\nFerrari had 11/12 for 1974, though they gave those to McLaren following Lauda's WDC win in 1975. Of course Hunt won in 1976, so for 1977, Ferrari were 11/12 again and kept those until the end of 1979 as Lauda took 1/2 to Brabham for 1978.\n\nIn 1979, Ferrari won the WDC and WCC with Jody Scheckter and so were 1/2 in 1980.\n\nWilliams, as a relatively new team, were 27/28 in 1980, but won both championships that year, and so swapped with Ferrari for 1981. That's how Ferrari ended up with 27/28.\n\nFerrari kept those numbers until 1990 when the reigning WDC Alain Prost joined them so they got 1/2, with 27/28 being swapped with McLaren (who had 1/2 in 1989). Senna and McLaren took both titles in 1990 and so for 1991, McLaren and Ferrari swapped back, with the red cars being 27/28 again.\n\nWith Prost swapping teams with Berger for 1990, and the two teams swapping numbers too, Berger drove the #28 Ferrari in 1989 and then the #28 McLaren in 1990.\n\nI do find it funny 27/28 are associated with Ferrari when both Williams and McLaren won championships with those numbers but Ferrari didn't.\n\nI'm sorry I've made this a confusing mess.\n\nAs for Williams. They got 5/6 in 1982 when Nelson Piquet won the WDC in Brabham, so Williams took Brabhams numbers.

It felt that way anyway but then they only won one WDC between 1982 and 1992 and Piquet went to lotus the year after that, so they stick with 5/6. \n\nMeanwhile every year McLaren won the WDC (which they did once or twice between 84 and 91), they took numbers 1/2 the following year and so Williams stuck with 5/6 for quite a while \n\nThat would answer the Williams question I guess', 'Thanks, that’s interesting. I’m still curious why, as they could have just kept 11/12 until the mid 90s and that would have been just as consistent as 27/28']",18,19,0.86,18,39,39,0,0,-0.050000000000000044,0

1loyua3,"F1®: The Movie, women, and the collective sigh of disappointment",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1loyua3/f1_the_movie_women_and_the_collective_sigh_of/,2025-07-01, News,,"['I mean overall I like the movie but ngl the way the Kate the TD was portrayed in that movie was atrocious. The Vegas romance between her and Sonny was so unnecessary and she somehow failed to make the car into anything other than a shitbox for more than 2 years until Sonny basically gave her a breakthrough idea in like his first month there.', 'Yeah having Jodie being schooled by Sonny immediately on how to do her job and the pit girl being useless had me rolling my eyes.', ""I think this is emblematic of the biggest issue in the film: it is simply trying to do too much and so it does not really give itself the opportunity to do any one thing well. Here are all of the subplots that the film is trying to juggle:\n\n* Sonny's habit of racing despite his injuries.\n* Sonny's hostile relationship with the press.\n* Pearce trying to make a name for himself as quickly as possible.\n* Ruben's efforts to manage the relationship between the drivers.\n* Banning's attempt to hijack the team.\n* Kate's struggle to make it in Formula 1.\n* Jodie's lack of confidence potentially letting the team down.\n\nThere are just so many subplots that the film's only solution is to work through them as quickly as possible. Take the team itself -- APX is clearly able to attract world-class talent, since Kasper was a team principal at Ferrari and Kate worked at Lockheed-Martin. The film seems to be aiming for the idea that APX has everything it needs for a breakthrough, but they just cannot get the stars to align. However, it then gets distracted by off-track -- and worse, off-camera -- politics that threaten to undermine the team. Its solution to this problem is to have Sonny say a few words of encouragement to Jodie and then have the team go for a run together and suddenly they all work well. Check that box and then move on to the next subplot that needs to be resolved. Sometimes these things fit together pretty well; Sonny's relationship with and management of the team is in contrast to Pearce's, which fuels the tension between them. But because another subplot comes up, the film has no time to breathe.\n\nA character like Kate had the potential to be interesting. She gave up a career working for Lockheed-Martin to join Formula 1, chasing those few tenths of a second that could make the team great. It costs her everything, but she persists because she loves it, even though she cannot explain why. She is probably the person who can come closest to understanding Sonny's feeling of flying, and she is the person who can take that ephemeral feeling and turn it into a physical thing. There is a natural relationship there, but it should not be a romantic one. The film really wobbles in the pub scene because it presents Sonny's charm as flirting. It should have reframed it as him trying to persuade her into supporting him because he thinks Kate has to work *for* him when in reality he needs to work *with* her.\n\nWe know the film went through some reshoots because they were filming at Silverstone in 2023 and 2024. I suspect that the Banning scenes were a late addition -- the framing of the shots on the grid where the cars are behind the camera make me think that this was filmed separately and then spliced in. A lot of the complaints about the film stem from people not really understanding the Banning subplot, probably because it comes up so late. He goes from a goofy supporter of Ruben to a cutthroat board member in the blink of an eye, and the transformation happens off-camera, so I suspect the character was added in or rewritten at the last minute because the film felt the need for a third-act villain. The unintended consequence was that it compressed everything else that the film did, and characters like Kate and Jodie copped the worst of it."", 'It didn’t really pass the bechdel test in spirit even though it might have literally. Honestly this movie did feel like a load of compromises made because of a meddling studio - “there has to be a love interest for Sonny” included', 'I liked how the women of Sky F1 realised the movie was a little bit shit about women in the sport, so Bernie went round interviewing different female employees at Aston Martin and Red Bull during the Austrian GP weekend. I thought that was a nice bit.', 'It could have meant so much for women in motorsport… yet they created something thats just a setback for women, objectiving them and dumbing them down to be saved by men. \n\nIts just poor writing and gives the impression that no woman was in the room during the writing process\n\nWhat coulve been… they could’ve done justice to the intelligence, professionalism and capability of the real women working in motorsport.', 'a lot of people in the comments are missing the point. women want representation done properly, not just for the sake of it. the real danger of the way they portrayed kate is enforcing the idea that women “have to” sleep their way to the top to be taken seriously or to achieve something, that their achievements are not valid on merit alone. you can literally write out their romance and it will still be the same movie. you can give sonny a different love interest and it will still be the same movie. so why make it his engineer of all people, that they even write in a little context that she was encouraged to stay away from him? they initially present kate being this smart woman, but turns out they write her as not smart enough to design a car properly until sonny comes into the picture, that she’s not smart enough to think through the risks of having a one night stand with someone she works for, that she shows little remorse or regret when she gets caught in sonny’s hotel room by their boss. it’s all very male-gaze in an era when women in real life are doing the most to break the old-fashioned, very masculine barriers in motorsport.', 'The woman who plays Kate in Bridgerton had role with lines and did a lot of PR.
