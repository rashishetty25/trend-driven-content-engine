1n7bz5t,From 2026’s 50% split V6 Hybrid to a 2030 V8 Hybrid? What Are We Doing…,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n7bz5t/from_2026s_50_split_v6_hybrid_to_a_2030_v8_hybrid/,2025-09-03, News,"So, the FIA hasn’t even rolled out the 2026 engine regs yet and according to the credible sources at AmUs they’re already talking about the next formula. If this is true, it’s a mess. Four years of one set of rules, then we rip it up again.  


The new proposal for ~2030 (per AMuS):  
- 2.4L naturally aspirated V8 (like 2006–2013)  
- Hybrid component delivering 220–240kW (midway between current 120kW and 2026’s 350kW)  
- CO₂-neutral fuel with pre-chamber ignition for efficiency  
- Turbo gone (at least sound might improve) but fuel limits will still mute it  
- FIA pushing for 2029 start; RB Powertrains & Cadillac on board  
- Audi & Honda resisting as they want their 2026 investments to last the promised 5 years  
- Ferrari open to earlier switch if FIA gives clear direction  
- Cost-cutting goal: engines simpler, cheaper, leasing to customer teams for ~€10M (down from €17–20M)  
- But switching to V8 means all manufacturers redesign the blocks so it's only worth it if regs are locked for ~10 years  

This is frustrating is it too much to ask for a simpler formula focused on the raceabiliy ? 
the 2026 regs already feel like a marketing exercise 

- ~50/50 power split between ICE (~500hp) and electric (~350kW) with constant tweaking per circuit to accommodate risks of sudden electric clipping
- Gimmick ""axis"" modes from movable aero and electric boost with conditional deployment that will give casters a headache to comment.


And now we’re talking about binning them early for another formula, which means more costs, more churn, and less stability.  


If the FIA wanted to showcase sustainability, they could’ve just promoted the insane thermal efficiency of the current engines instead of forcing a 50/50 split that creates regen limits, de-rating, and aero headaches.  
As a fan I want great racing, not constant technical resets to bait manufacturers ready to flee as soon as they don't have it their way.","[""As frustrating as it may sound, it's pointless to fight against technology and, differently from many sports, F1 is very costly and requires large companies, specially automakers, to back it.\n\nHaving a high-rev NA engine, to eliminate lag/traction issues + electrification sounds already better than 2026.

So that I dont care too much about.\n\nBut yeah the engine side is a bit of a mess and a lot of that is just because they want the manufacturers involved, so they catered it around everyone's needs. Doing that has meant they also handicapped themselves on the regen side, so its a bit of mess making that work when it probably didnt need to be."", 'I would love to see the new regs limit the overall size of these monsters. Sorry to sound like Grandpa, onion on the belt and all, but back in the day cars were small enough to pass on nearly every circuit. \n\nExcept Monaco, of course. That was always just a showcase for the elite and their yacht side viewing parties.', '""Haha v8 goes vroom who cares"" are really starting to annoy me.

It should have been abandoned long ago.', 'I say let them build whatever engine they like, just limit the total fuel in the race.', ""I have a better question. Would it be SMARTER if they just extend this engineer regulation till 2030? Because switching from the current reg, to the upcoming regs to then CHANGE it again in 4 years. Since the current regs lasted ELEVEN YEARS...and I don't think any manufacturer would agree to switching to new regs so soon."", 'The aero modes aren’t gimmicky as long as they are fully controlled by the driver. Things like DRS where you can only use them if you meet arbitrary parameters and only in certain places would be a gimmick. As long as they don’t do that with the moveable aero these regs stand a chance of at least being pure racing.', 'As a long-time fan who had the pleasure of going to V10 races in the early 2000s, I cannot overstate how much those things changed the experience. The current cars are technical marvels but utterly dull to spectators. They sound like tin cans with a ball rattling inside. The Porsche GT cup cars are often louder in the pre-race. \n\nAdditionally, the engine formula I don’t think is what makes the racing better today. Many of the drivers in fact think these V6s are hard to race because they are heavy.

1n6i3d2,Let's look back at Vettel's penalty in the 2019 Canadian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n6i3d2/lets_look_back_at_vettels_penalty_in_the_2019/,2025-09-02, Discussion,"A bit of context for all you whippersnappers who joined F1 during the 2021 season. 2019 was built up as the year of Ferrari. All the preseason testing all pointed towards Ferrari being THE team to beat during the season. What we actually got was Mercedes being as dominant as they've ever been. Every race up to Canada has either been an easy Mercedes 1-2, or a race where Ferrari shot themselves in the foot (Bahrain and Canada). Yes new viewers, we were all making fun of Ferrari before 2022.

The Canadian Grand Prix was one that many were enjoying during the race, mainly because as long as Vettel didn't suffer an engine blowout like Leclerc did in Bahrain, he would win the race. Unfortunately during the last ten laps or so, Vettel made an error. He went off the track, onto the grass, and rejoined the track in such a way that Hamilton had to brake in order to avoid a collision.

This resulted in Vettel receiving a five second penalty. A penalty that resulted in Hamilton and Mercedes winning yet another race. At this point in the season, none of the races were won by a different constructor, and Canada was only the second race where P2 wasn't Bottas.

I suspect this played a large hand in the massive backlash over the decision to give Vettel a penalty. Not just online, but the Sky F1 pundits, Channel 4 pundits, TV personalities, it was a wildly despised penalty. This led in turn to the FIA introducing a yellow card like system, where drivers were basically let off with a warning if they committed minor five second penalty offenses. This meant that certain driver on driver duels such as Verstappen v Leclerc at Austria and Hamilton v Leclerc in Italy resulted in the winner forcing a driver off the track and getting away with it, so the FIA quietly reverted back to the old way of doing it.

Personally speaking, I believe the only way Vettel doesn't deserve a penalty is if you don't believe that Hamilton was allowed to take the standard racing line at standard racing speed whilst Vettel sorted himself out, and nowadays the backlash has softened massively. What do you think of the penalty? Are you still mad about it?","['>2019 was built up as the year of Ferrari.\n\nLike every year, really.', ""What's the point of this thread?
