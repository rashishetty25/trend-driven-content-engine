Drivers have been desperately trying to get NASCAR to listen to them for years. New car development by NASCAR with hardly any feedback from the drivers resulted in multiple driver injuries due to design flaws. Rule changes required for fair competition have been completely disregarded by NASCAR in leu of their own incompetent rules committee making decisions. Not to mention the latest lawsuit brought up by two of the teams partly because they forced teams to sign a contract with little time to review it.', 'Think this might be a bit of an overreaction... \n\nNASCAR did *just* force the entire grid into submission with their concord agreement - nuking FRM and 23XI in the process...\n\nedit: the Athletic is great for ball sports but man they just continue to miss the mark with racing news.', 'Doesn‚Äôt Nascar penalize drivers for even mildly saying the car is bad?

They are currently involved in a lawsuit involving 2 teams.', 'This is kind of bullshit. NASCAR has always had a far looser ruleset for their drivers. You can punch someone and you might get parked if it was really bad but probably not. However nascar has little interest in anything but entertainment.

They did it again this year lol.\xa0\n\nBeyond that something wasn‚Äôt mentioned in this article that should have been. Which is the FIA is not akin to nascar. NASCAR is the regulator and the owner. It is a member of the ACCUS-FIA but NASCAR controls most of that. F1 is not regulated by itself. The FIA independently regulates it and the FIA isn‚Äôt beholden to it.
