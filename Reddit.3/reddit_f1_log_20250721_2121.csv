1m5dzlu,The F1 movie from the perspective of an F1 fan versus someone who doesn't know the sport,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m5dzlu/the_f1_movie_from_the_perspective_of_an_f1_fan/,2025-07-21, Discussion,"I recently saw the F1 movie together with a buddy of mine who is really not into motorsports or any kind - but it's an avid movie watcher (and can be a fairly tough critic). 

I'll try not to spoil anything, but it was very interesting how different our experiences were. 

As someone who has been watching F1 since the late 90s, it was a really mixed bag. Like a long advertisement for F1, where they pretty much threw a bunch of money at some grad A artists and hoped for the best. To be fair, everyone was really professional (Bardem absolutely kills it as usual, Kerry Condon steals most of the scenes she's in), and the imagery on the track is fantastic. But the way they insert F1 personalities and elements, felt really artificial, and more like a caricature of F1. 


However, my friend loved the movie. Without any prior F1 knowledge, he was glued to the screen, and he was really impressed by the whole atmosphere and the feeling of speed from the cars. He says it reminded him of Top Gun Maverick (which is a fair comparison, given how much in-car footage there is). It also helped a lot that they do a good job explaining the more technical terms of the sport. 

TL;DR: the movie succeeds in making F1 interesting for the average viewer that's out of the loop, but it might be a mixed bag if you know a thing or two about the sport.","['I have been watching F1 since 1992 and I am just happy they filmed a big movie about the sport that I love.\xa0\n\n\nIt is inaccurate and sometimes unrealistic, but I can watch any race for accuracy and realism - this one is pure enjoyment for me. Entertainment.', ""Yeah, that'll always be the case with whatever the subject of a movie is.\n\nI'm sure that in a bunch of science based films that I enjoy, someone who knows the subject matter is going to be a little bit irked at the contents of the film.\n\nIt's a piece of fiction that has a ton of high profile cameos. Enjoy it for what it is."", 'My dad been a fan since the 70s and he loved it. So did I. Its a film, a lot of rules wont apply. As someone who loves history as well, you have no idea how much Braveheart and Gladiator messed up and they are still so highly regarded and rightly so. They are fantastic movies.\n\nRocky makes a mockery of boxing (and you dont even need to be a fan to see it, the fight is ridiculous) and it won an Oscar. The F1 movie is obviously not on that level, but it was a fun 2 hour romp. I will definitely rewatch it soon.', 'Top Gun Maverick and the F1 Movie had the same director which goes some way to feeling that comparison.', ""I split my appreciation in two. My general film enjoyer side appreciated it as a cool fun blockbuster. My F1 fan side just found a lot of it pretty funny with things like the Hungary crashfest or Toto's cameo"", ""Basically what everyone has said so far. It's made to bring new fans to the sport rather than to cater to the niche hardcore/veteran F1 fanbase. Documentaries exist for the latter."", 'I enjoyed it, but had to leave my F1 head outside. Definitely a film for non/casual F1 fans.', 'One thing that I particularly disliked about the movie is that they never showed quali. Like, how? There are tons of amazing scenes you could do using quali and they just never brought it up once? Just a waste.', 'Im very much a casual F1 fan, I just like to watch the races but anything deeper than that I’m not too interested in.  I thought the film was awful.  So incredibly cheesy, stakes were so low.  Like from the start they mention they just need to win one race, obviously that was going to happen.  I think the use of real F1 personalities was a mistake, just kind of felt like they weren’t actually racing anyone because you know the other racers aren’t real characters in the film.  Every time I had to hear Martin Brundle painfully read his lines took me out of it, I get he’s not an actor but it really showed.  Every explanation of some rule or tactic felt incredibly heavy handed, not subtle at all.  I get some viewers wont know the rules but it didn’t need to be so blatant with it lol.  I honestly thought the film would be perfect for a “fan” like me but I had my eyes rolling so many times']",3152,664,0.92,3152,4866,4866,129,20,0.0,129

Wind tunnels and computers can only tell you so much. McLaren also helped by being in the lead so changes can be staggered.', '> In all these instances, the delay in racing the new parts wasn’t due to underperformance, but rather to a carefully thought-out plan. By collecting on-track data, McLaren was able to verify the correlation, checking whether the upgrades delivered what was expected based on wind tunnel and CFD simulations.\n\n> This cautious rollout has helped McLaren avoid problems that have plagued other teams in recent years, such as correlation issues or unexpected side effects - issues Ferrari encountered after introducing a new floor in Barcelona last year, whereas Christian Horner has spoken many times about the handicap of Red Bull’s outdated windtunnel.\n\nThis definitely feels like a luxury afforded to them by their large performance delta this year relative to other teams.

Many times they brought little winglets and rear wings to test on the cars before running them on the cars in the following race in 2023. Remember the suspension in Hungary in 2023? Tested in FP1, removed for the race and reintroduced in Singapore. Rear wing in Zandvoort was added to the cars later in the season.
