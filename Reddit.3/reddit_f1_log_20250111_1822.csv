The spectacle continues to decline, its treated like a testing bed for technologies that dont benefit the sport.  \n\nThe recent seasons have been most interesting for almost over a decade - the sports viewership has dropped drastically from mid 2000s from ~600m global viewership to around ~80m globally (live & ignoring YouTube/social media interactions).  \nFor me it\'s fun to see what the engineers come up with and how drivers adapt from weekend to weekend.  \n\n> It appears as if the only goal is to line the owners of F1s pockets with as much money as possible and at any cost.  \n  \nThat has been the case since the 80s, with Concorde Agreement and the ""gentleman"" drivers (rich people spending time in racing cars) has been a part of the sport since always.  \n  \n> They continue to add more and more GPs putting more and more strain on everyone involved.  \n  \nI mean I maybe watch ~50% of races live, if and when i have time and catch-up others with highlights. You don\'t have to be hardcore invested in it in your favourite drivers/teams most recent gear ever 5 weeks, depending on what is legal as advertisement.  \nBut as an occasional live visitor having sprint and race makes visiting Saturday and Sunday more interesting.  \n  \nAs to people working there (and also the thousands of volunteers) it\'s a strain, but they\'d be better off working as an engineer outside of the sport, where they\'d earn more money - so they\'re also there as they like the challenge.  \nSimilarly all teams are now pivoting to engineering services companies, which allows them to keep the workforce and not everyone singularly committed to F1 full time.  \n  \n[Toto Wolff, with the incoming cost cap, planned to transform their ~20m per year services arm to ~100m services industry](https://www.ft.com/content/8f3b4450-24a9-4438-ae50-7d30ea2a00fc) and I\'d say he also managed to achieve it - considering the turnover of the company.  \nSimilarly McLaren and Red Bull Technologies (parent company of Red Bull Racing) are also structured in a similar manner (though more publicly - as different subsidiaries), allowing them to keep their workforce busy & happy as well as to have different teams for the ~80 or so people who travel to circuit.  \n  \n> F1 has turned from probably the peak of motorsport  \n  \nI don\'t think that was ever the case - it always has had regulations and restrictions where modern technologies are tested in various industries and once their compact / robust enough they come to F1 - independently if they\'re road relevant or not (sequential gearboxes from motorcycles, composite materials from aerospace engineering, automatic gearboxes/traction control once technologies was reliable and fast enough after it was used in road cars).  \nThe formula changes and is dictated by what ever is currently interesting for manufacturers (why Ferrari got technical veto power - when they were the only full manufacturer in the sport in the 80s).  \nOther times other sports have been faster, more technical (Group B in 80s, LMP in 90s, CanAm in 60s).  \nF1 is just the ""highest level"" of open wheeled formula (regulations) that isn\'t a spec series.  \n  \n> We are literally in a scenario where Germany, a country which has a total of 3 world champions and has won a total of 12 drivers titles doesnt have GP, yet a continent who cant even get a driver into the sport hosts 4.  \n  \nBecause Germany, while a world known car country, is primarily a football country, where the stadiums are regularly sold out in first and second league - and many aren\'t interested in motorsports - Formula 1 peaked in 2000 with viewership and attendance and has been declining ever since, as even Germans got bored of Schumacher.  \nIn contrast to other countries, even Italy and Spa, as well as COTA, are (local) government subsidised and Germany doesn\'t do that, as it concentrates more on industry and voluntary youth clubs for football/handball/basketball.  \n  \n> Why do any of you watch it?  \n  \nCars going vroom, makes dopamine happen, independently of a team/driver/circuit.\nThis doesn\'t happen with other sports, movies or television.  \n  \nEdit: i should enable autocorrect.', 'Cars go vroom fast:)', ""Not going to bother replying to all of this but just want to point out that Germany has never really loved F1 apart from the Schumacher years.

1hybdw5,Why Alpine axing Doohan for Colapinto would be bad for F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hybdw5/why_alpine_axing_doohan_for_colapinto_would_be/,2025-01-10, News,,"['""it could cause a revolving door of cast-aside talent""\n\nalpine fucked doohan by having him have his debut in abu dhabi, he was very unimpressive and now everyone\'s talking about how they\'re gonna fire him\n\nF1 has always been ruthless, and it has always been a revolving door of cast-aside talent, there\'s only 20 seats and on average like 2 new people enter the sport every year, so at least 2 people have to lose their jobs per year\n\nthere\'s no way a top tier sport with only 20 spots and constant junior development can stop being a revolving door', 'It would be bad for rookies that graduate into F1... Yeah, because Franco is a 15 season veteran... Huh.\n\nI wonder how many teams pay 20M for a third driver to let him play in the sim back in the factory...', ""It wouldn't be bad for F1, it would be business as usual."", ""F1 is becoming accustomed to Drivers getting limited opportunities.\n\nWe've seen it a lot from Red Bull over the last decade, especially with their Junior Team, whilst Mclaren and Williams have jumped on board with mid-season changes in recent years... So the more it happens, the more people are going to expect to see instant results from Drivers, else the rumour mill will start.\n\nI don't expect it to last long before the Lindblad replacing Hadjar / Tsunoda rumours start.\n\nAlpine have screwed themselves really, as we knew for ages that Ocon was leaving, but they dithered for so long over who would replace him; Doohan is almost there because their options were shite."", 'Why replacing a slow driver for a quicker one would be bad for F1. This has been the MO for F1 since 1950 are you guys new to this', 'Who wrote this? Doohans dad?', '‘But Alpine, have you considered that sacking a driver might be bad for OUR bottom line? Btw no you can’t have the engine equalisation we promised’', ""We just came from a season where there was no movement of seats coming into it and people were upset. The shake-up only occurred for the 2025 season and Hamilton moving to Ferrari. It's not a bad thing to give drivers some chance at F1 or as a business for a team to then take them out if they do poorly, if the team has a driver they believe could do better.\n\n>may stymie development of young drivers who have graduated to F1, paradoxically producing a self-perpetuating revolving door of cast-aside talent.\n\n>Young drivers need a chance to prove themselves and regardless of where early performance may or may not be, someone of Doohan's calibre has earned the right to be given time, just as Sargeant was.\n\nDoohan has been rumored to have signed a 6 race contract. This isn't something that he didn't know could have happened. His chance to show what he is capable of is 6 races, as that is what he has been rumored to have signed on for.\n\nedit: formatting"", ""It would be bad if Jack is doing a decent job next year but they put Franco in anyway.
