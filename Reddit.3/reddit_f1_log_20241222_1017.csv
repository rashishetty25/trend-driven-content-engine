The fact that he doesn‚Äôt have a drive for 2025 just shows how much F1 is about politics. He may be a rookie and may have done costly mistakes but he has the persona and the pace to be there. He stepped into F1 from F2 without being a constant front runner and did that job. Im my opinion it means more that an F2 oe F3 title. Someone should sign him as a 3rd driver and let him drive in FP1 sessions from the beginning. Teams like mercedes, redbull or sauber should have a driver like him.‚Äù, cuz they have a driver who is not 100% bulletproof to do the job in their car.
