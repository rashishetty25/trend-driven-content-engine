1lvuyy0,No situations for wet tyres.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvuyy0/no_situations_for_wet_tyres/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"I must say I find it pretty annoying that there seems to be an overlap between intermediate tyres and SC/VSC/🚩. At Silverstone it seemed like Race Control had a perfect opportunity to let the teams squabble with tyre choices, as the forecast said there would be around ten minutes of rain, and no more to follow.

The obvious quandary is about safety, and as Martin Brundle said on commentary, he agreed with the decision of the safety car, because the standing water started to endanger the cars of aquaplaning. Personally I think a VSC would be sufficient in that instance, if anything, particularly for letting Piastri keep his advantage.

I remember that less than a decade ago, half of the pack used wet and the other half intermediate tyres in conditions like that, and I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution. I'm also wondering what other people's thoughts and opinions are, hence this post.

I clearly don't want drivers in danger, but like we often say, they are professionals and we need to trust that they will take precaution too. I think I lean towards letting them drive and enjoying the peril as a spectator, not of damage or injury, but of race-changing incidents due to the challenging conditions.","[""> I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution\n\nIt is the aero design of this regulation. It wasn't as bad in the beginning when teams were figuring it out still and having to raise ride height, but they've all dialed in so much now that the cars all produce more spray. So the increased spray combined with conditions that would warrant wet tires mean that visibility is not good enough to race safely where it would have been in past years, plus I think the sport is just more safety-minded in general now. That's my understanding at least. Happy to hear if others think there are other factors."", 'What changed is that the current generation of cars generate so much spray that when the conditions are bad enough for wets, visibility is dangerously bad. No amount of trusting drivers to “take precautions” matters when they can’t see anything more than 20 yards in front of them.', ""I feel it's a very mixed situation. \n\nThe wet tires are to no use at this moment. The spray that they, in combination with this era of ground effect cars, cause limits visibility so much that you cannot safely drive, let alone race. So by the time the weather becomes bad enough, it's time for a Safety car or a Red flag even. The Dutch GP of 2023 showed that really well. \n\nAlso it doesn't help that the crossover between Inters and Wets is at that same point where racing just becomes impossible. So teams tend to just stick to Inters, because chance is more likely that race is gonna get neutralized at that point anyway. \n\nAnd the reason to get a Full Safety car over a VSC, wasn't to ruin Piastri's advantage. It was for the safety of all drivers. Remember that Bernd Mayländer has all the information on track conditions, if there is a really wet part of the track he can limit the pace of all cars and have them evade especially risky puddles. while the movement of the cars, especially in closer proximity of each other, works really well to dry the track out. That's why sometimes after a heavy rain before a race start, they have 2-3 or even 4 formation laps, just to dry the track out. \n\nBut we'll see, Pirelli said that the usability window for wets should be better. And i hope the design of the 2026 cars limit spray somewhat more so we can actually have racing in the wet."", 'As a related issue, do safety cars actually make wet situations less safe? \n\nBy bunching cars up and then releasing them with cold tyres in wet conditions aren’t you just increasing the likelihood of a crash. Wouldn’t it be better to try and keep some distance between cars when they are released, like the VSC?', 'They can’t use the full wet because the amount of spray generated by an amount of water necessitating the full wet + the spray generated by the floor is extreme and visibility goes to zero.', ""it's not just about aquaplaning, it's that they literally cant see because of the spray"", 'Forecast was rain in ten minutes, initially light then heavier before tailing off.

A few months ago, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident wanted to bring the naturally aspirated V10 back into Formula 1. Now there\'s a new idea. Furthermore, a twelfth F1 team could emerge.**\n\n> It was one of the most controversial political issues of the current Formula 1 season: the engine regulations for the upcoming season. Next year, there will be new power units. The electric component will increase to almost 50 percent, while the rest of the power will continue to be generated by the conventional 1.6-liter V6 turbo.\n\n> Since the start of the season, several teams and engine manufacturers in the paddock have been pursuing a policy against the new rules. Ferrari and Red Bull in particular are leading the way. Both top teams are apparently concerned about falling behind Mercedes on the powertrain side. Ferrari team principal Frédéric Vasseur and his Red Bull counterpart Christian Horner have advocated for a V10 comeback.\n\n> Both the Frenchman and the Englishman walked through a door opened by the current FIA President, Mohammed bin Sulayem. In February of this year, he announced that the team would be using synthetic fuel starting in 2026 anyway. This would have addressed the sustainability aspect. A return to the loud, screeching V10 naturally aspirated engines, so popular with fans, would be an option.\n\n> Bin Sulayem likely hoped to increase his popularity in Europe with this move. His first term ends in December 2025. He is seeking re-election as FIA President. He doesn\'t have many fans on the Old Continent.\xa0Since the Silverstone weekend, he has had a rival candidate\xa0in the race for the position: Tim Mayer.\n\n> **Engine meeting in Bahrain fizzles out.**\nThe V10 issue escalated so quickly that an engine meeting was called for the fourth Bahrain Grand Prix in mid-April. Bin Sulayem, F1 boss Stefano Domenicali, and the power unit manufacturers were present, as were the power unit manufacturers, who presented their positions. Mercedes and newcomer Audi declared that they would have no engines for next year if the regulations were changed to naturally aspirated V10s at short notice. The proposal was rejected.\n\n> A few months later, Mohammed bin Sulayem is now upping the ante. He told the news agency Reuters: ""The current engines are so complicated and very expensive. The research and development costs reach $200 million (around €170 million), and the engine costs about $1.8 million to $2.1 million.""\n\n> The 63-year-old is therefore emphasizing the advantages of the simpler naturally aspirated engines. Unlike in Winter, however, he is now offering a naturally aspirated V8 as an option. According to the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident, this should be half the price of the current and future engines.\n\n> The new engine regulations are actually designed to run for five years. However, there\'s the possibility of shortening the interval. Naturally aspirated engines could return in 2029 at the earliest. ""We have to do it quickly. It takes three years, so hopefully we\'ll have something by 2029,"" Bin Sulayem insists.\n\n> **Will a twelfth team come from China?**\nIn addition to the engine issue, Mohammed bin Sulayem also commented on a possible twelfth racing team in the premier class. After Cadillac fought its way into the championship against the wishes of the established F1 teams and will enter the race with a Ferrari engine in 2026, another newcomer is expected to join, according to the former rally driver.\n\n> ""The time will come when we believe it is right to reopen a bidding round,"" said Bin Sulayem. The twelfth team should come from China, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident explained.\n\n> Would the existing racing teams welcome this? Hardly. The team\'s payout fee would be reduced because more parties would get a piece of the pie. This was already a major contentious issue in the Cadillac case. Only after the US Congress launched an investigation into Formula 1, because the Americans considered the reasoning for its rejection to be unlawful, was Cadillac granted entry into the premier class.', ""I don't see either a V8 or V10 happening any time soon. Engine manufacturers have basically no interest in developing big engines, so doing this would cause most of them to leave instantly.\n\nI could see it maybe in enough years that EV tech is far enough along that engine makers are willing to have some pet projects, but for now I just don't see anyone being willing to do it."", ""Ben Sulayem did make a good point about the environment.

At what point has the flow of time changed cars to the point that comparing drivers becomes foolish? For instance our original conversation started with the question: 
“can Jim Clark be called the goat of F1 when he drove a version of F1 cars that didn’t even have downforce”

But one could pose the question saying the same thing about Senna, because his car didn’t have the technology requiring the level of multitasking today’s drivers have to deal with.

So my full question boils down to, were Clark, Senna, Schumacher, and Hamilton even champions of the same sport? Why even compare them in the first place? Because realistically, with a few exceptions of maybe some of the similar era cars. Most of them wouldn’t be able to drive each other’s cars with the same degree of proficiency.
","[""Congratulations! You've successfully achieved the higher level of F1 fandom where you realise trying to compare drivers across vastly different eras is inherently meaningless.\n\nAll you can really do is compare drivers to their peers of the time. In that way, Clark really was on a very special level."", 'even comparing drivers across 2 different regulation cycles is hard, doing it across different eras is literally impossible', 'Absolutely agreed. Hamilton and Verstappen are virtually driving a completely different sport to Fangio and Clark. Murray Walker’s [take](https://youtu.be/CGKsKU0P3oo) at the start of this video has been my view broadly ever since I saw it as a kid. He later says for him Schumacher is his greatest of all time, narrowly ahead of Fangio, but stresses it’s just an opinion and of course that’s a perfectly fine opinion to have (backed up by a long career in F1 journalism). For me, the top tier is Fangio, Clark, Senna, Prost, Schumacher, Hamilton, Verstappen in no particular order. I do not know who I would pick if forced, it would probably change every time.', ""You're right, F1 is unique in that different eras are essentially completely different sports. Generally speaking, apart from tactics and the weight of the ball, football/soccer has been the same for decades. Senna wouldn't be as good as Hamilton in today's machinery, and Clark wouldn't have been as good as Senna in 80s machinery. They're all completely different skillsets."", ""It's totally pointless comparing drivers even in the same era who weren't teammates, and even then the driver who's superior in one car might not be in another with different characteristics. There are so many external factors and circumstances that it's really quite pointless to try and come up with any slightly objective ranking. The driver who was fastest at old Spa in the wet in a 60s deathtrap might not be the driver who is fastest at Miami in modern cars. Traction control vs no traction control. Power steering, sequential gears etc. Which combination of conditions, driver aids, tracks are you comparing across. It's nonsensical really.\n\nAnyway, Jim Clark's the best."", 'Welcome to the rational club!', ""Frankly it's impossible.  It's entirely possible that Senna would dominate today but because he never had to contend with the driving load of today's cars we simply will never know.   We can't just assume that because something didn't exist the old drivers are incapable of mastering it.   It's simply unknowable."", ""At literally every point that they're not dirivng the same car at the same time with a comparable setup and traffic. So yep.\xa0"", 'There\'s no ""at what point"". \n\nIt\'s foolish to compare drivers from across different regulations and eras in the first place. Only people that are clueless in F1 do that.', ""I'm going to disagree with everyone and get downvoted to hell, but meh.\n\nYou absolutely can compare drivers from different eras. It doesn't matter that technology has advanced etc, what matters is how good they were in comparison to their peers, who have the same technology, physical conditioning etc. The same as in any sport.\n\nDrivers can only master what is in front of them. Schumacher squeezed every last bit of performance he could out of the cars he won his titles in. If he had been born 30 years later, does anyone think he wouldn't have mastered today's cars in exactly the same way? It was his drive and determination to win that made him great, and he would have applied that to whatever technology was available to him.\n\nGranted, you couldn't use a time machine to transport 1990s Schumacher into a 2025 car and expect him to win a title instantly, but if he had grown up alongside today's racers, he would likely be just as successful in this era as he was during his own.\n\n(Or not, depending on how you think he compares to Hamilton and Verstappen...)""]",47,100,0.74,47,90,90,2,8,0.0,2

The new F1 movie makes a lot of very factual sounding statements about the history of APXGP that aren’t discussed any further beyond a sentence or two. This includes things like; the teams age, (very vaguely) their other driver, teammate to Josh prior to Hayes, and other little things. I have done my very best to tie as much legitimate believable real F1 with the Movie to create an F1.com style article for the origins/history of the fictional team prior to the movie/through the events of the movie. Obviously they could have an infinite amount of theoretical backstories, but this is just my fan-made one. Any feedback is appreciated, sorry for the long read

 Origins & Formation (2019–2020)

In mid-2019, whispers began circulating that Kaspar Molinski, Ferrari’s former technical mastermind behind their dominant 2000–2004 era, was plotting a return to F1. He was spotted in discussions with Ruben Cervantes—a millionaire tech entrepreneur, as well as a former Renault F1 driver in the 1990’s.
By late 2020, the rumors crystalized into reality as financial software giant Expensify announced a surprise multi-year title sponsorship for an 11th F1 team. The newly christened Expensify APXGP would be headquartered at a refurbished section of the former McLaren campus in Silverstone.

The team secured a Mercedes power unit deal, becoming the fifth team to run Mercedes-AMG HPP engines in 2021.

⸻

Key Personnel:
	•	Team Principal: Kaspar Molinski
	•	Technical Director: Kate McKenna (Cambridge-educated in aerospace/aerothermal engineering)

2021 Season

	Chassis: APX01
	Drivers:
	•	Kevin Magnussen (returning shock inclusion)
	•	Dan Ticktum (controversial F2 graduate, ex-Williams academy)

Season Summary:

To fast-track development, the team utilized components from the 2020 Racing Point and Williams FW43, coupled with technical support from Mercedes. The APX01 was reliable but underdeveloped, with weak aero balance and minimal downforce.
	•	Best Result: P14 (Magnussen, Baku)
	•	Notable Moments: Near Q2 appearance by Magnussen at a wet spa. Grid penalty at Austria GP for unhomologated front wing
	•	Final Standing: 11th in Constructors’ Championship, 0 points
	•	Driver Swap: Ticktum dropped for behavioral issues, replaced by Callum Ilott for final 4 races.

⸻

 2022 Season

    Chassis: APX02
     Drivers:
	•	Callum Ilott (retained)
	•	Logan Sargeant (rookie; replaced Magnussen who returned to Haas)

Season Summary:

The APX02 was APXGP’s first car designed under new ground effect regulations. It featured aggressive aero but suffered from porpoising and weak cornering grip. Despite flashes of straight-line speed, downforce limitations plagued development.
	•	Best Finishes:
	•	Sargeant: P15 (Austria, Monza)
	•	Ilott: Struggled with adaptation
	•	Final Standing: 11th, 0 points
	•	Behind the Scenes: Launched a driver academy, signing F2 prospect Théo Pourchaire

⸻

2023 Season

Car: APX03

Drivers:
	•	Logan Sargeant (Year 2, team leader)
	•	Joshua Pearce (23 y.o. rookie; British F2 graduate, APX Academy product)

The most advanced APXGP car to date, the APX03 had tighter sidepods, improved aero, and more stable rear-end performance. Despite early-season tire overheating and poor straight-line speed, development throughout the season was substantial.

⸻

 First Half (Rounds 1–13): Frustration & Fractures
	•	Bahrain to Spain: Consistent bottom-grid finishes (P18–P22)
	•	Austria GP: Sargeant criticizes car development over team radio
	•	Silverstone: Williams poaches Sargeant for post-summer seat

⸻

 Mid-Season Driver Shakeup (Round 14)
	•	Sargeant exits post-Austria
	•	Sonny Hayes returns to F1 at age 51 after 30 years away, joining Pearce. Hayes was teammate with Cervantes in the 90’s, so media speculated Hayes mid season seat swap could have been influenced by a personal relationship between the two, though nothing was publicly confirmed.
	•	Silverstone: Double DNF after contact between Pearce and Hayes

⸻

Turning Point: Hungary GP (Round 15)

In a wild, controversial race:
	•	Hayes disrupts midfield strategy with bold tire calls and controversial wheel to wheel racing. 
	•	Pearce scores APXGP’s first-ever point (P10) following Hayes’ aggressive defense

Post-Hungary Upgrades:
	•	Major floor redesign improved dirty air performance
	•	Team entered most competitive phase in its history

⸻

Late Season Drama & Climax
	•	Monza: Pearce suffers a massive crash fighting for podium; sidelined
	•	Dutch GP: Hayes scores P9
	•	Suzuka: Hayes scores P7
	•	Mexico: Hayes scores P5
	•	Belgium: Hayes and Pearce collide again; Pearce salvages P10

Vegas GP Controversy:
	•	FIA investigates floor upgrades; reportedly, anonymous documents were submitted to the FIA that suggested that APX’s upgrade package was developed outside-of-facility. parts temporarily suspended for Vegas GP
	•	Hayes crashes out; upgrades later cleared as legal and fitted for for remaining races

⸻

Finale: Abu Dhabi GP

Despite injuries and missing most of the weekend, Hayes replaces Cortez last-minute and starts P22.

Race Summary:
	•	Safety cars and bold tire strategy play into APXGP’s hands
	•	Pearce and Hamilton crash out in a late battle for the lead, later deemed as a racing incident with no penalties awarded
	•	Hayes wins — APXGP’s first F1 victory
	•	First American race winner since Mario Andretti (1978)
	•	Constructors’ Standing: 7th, up from 11th — one of the largest one-season jumps in modern F1

⸻

Legacy and Outlook

Post-2023 Changes:
	•	Sonny Hayes retires from racing, declining further involvement
	•	Lucas Cortez promoted to full-time second driver
	•	Joshua Pearce retained for 2024 as lead driver
	•	APXGP launches Phase II of development: new wind tunnel, expanded academy, and deeper integration with Mercedes’ simulator tools

Season	Drivers	Best Finish	Constructors’ Rank	Points
2021	Magnussen, Ticktum/Ilott	P14 (Baku)	11th	0
2022	Ilott, Sargeant	P15 (Austria, Monza)	11th	0
