He hopes that through updates in three stages Red Bull can really take the fight to McLaren.*\n\nThe Bahrain Grand Prix, as is well known, has been the low point of the Formula One season so far for Red Bull Racing. Max Verstappen managed to limit the damage somewhat with a sixth place, but the reality was that Red Bull proved powerless with the RB21 at the Sakhir circuit. A weekend later, the world looked a lot better. Verstappen managed to claim pole position in Jeddah and, according to Christian Horner and Helmut Marko, would normally have won the race as well, were it not for a five-second time penalty that threw a spanner in the works.\n\n**Updates in three stages: “**We are taking small steps”\n\n“We were surprised, but positively surprised,” Marko revealed afterwards in the paddock in Jeddah about the race pace. “Compared to Bahrain we made a lot of progress, although this circuit also suits us better. Here you have many more fast corners and different asphalt, which helped us,” Marko acknowledged. Nevertheless, he also sees signs that the 81-year-old Austrian believes indicate more structural improvement. “We are making strides and trying to make the car more predictable. Furthermore, we are working on making the car a bigger window.” With those last words, Marko is referring to the car's set-up window. Horner has already explained that Red Bull was unable to find that in Bahrain, which made the picture look particularly bad, and that the optimal window was found for that circuit prior to qualifying in Jeddah.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Red Bull had some new parts on the car, with Marko explaining that these were three-step updates. In Miami - as in Jeddah - another small upgrade should follow, followed by more in Imola, according to the Austrian. “We are making small steps. I think that around Imola we should be in a position where we have the speed to beat the McLarens,” Marko reveals quite optimistically after a question from Motorsport.com.\n\n**Can heat in Miami still make things difficult for Red Bull?**\n\nBefore that follows the race weekend in Florida, and that could be an interesting one. For example, Horner revealed that McLaren was in a class of its own in the heat. The gap in practice sessions was at times 1.2 seconds per lap, according to the Briton, which made him laugh: “On Friday we still thought McLaren would lap everyone!” In the evening sessions it was still hot, but Red Bull performed better than expected. That said, the sessions in Miami are run during the day and it can be quite hot in The Sunshine State.\n\nDoes Marko fear the next Grand Prix somewhat because of that? “Well, fortunately the race is not around lunch time and normally the sun sets, of course. We have to see how it goes there and if we can find more performance, but I normally think we can be competitive there as well.”\n\nTranslated with DeepL"", ""As long as RBR don't fix their tyre deg, they don't stand a chance. The only constant between Jeddah and Japan was the lower tyre wear."", ""it's clear the redbull works well around high speed tracks with a smoother surface, Japan and Jeddah played to that, but China and Bahrain didn't. so we'll go to Miami and they'll likely struggle all over again"", ""I mean even at their best tracks they've been behind Mclaren on pace, maybe enough pace to win with the right circumstances, and whist Norris might create those circumstances, Piastri is less likely to mess up currently.\n\nAnd then there will be a bunch of tracks they will struggle at and not be able to compete.\n\nYou can't really fight for a title that way.\n\nHave to hope that the rules later this season work in their favor and Max can keep the gap small until then.. which is going well so far if you consider how many more points the WDC leader could have."", 'Think that Miami will suck for them, Imola will be good despite the upgrades due to high speed corners, Monaco depends on qualifying, it’s that stretch from Spain-Netherlands which the upgrades all depend on.

1k559mi,[AMuS] The secret of Ferrari pace,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k559mi/amus_the_secret_of_ferrari_pace/,2025-04-22, News,,"['People around here should actually learn to properly read the article and not just the title, before commenting.\n\nThe ""secret"" of Ferrari\'s pace is clean air. They had great pace when they were in clean air as shown last race. Since this article is based and focused on what happened last race, where Ferrari had good racepace, it\'s obvious what they meant with the title.\n\nI know it\'s hard for some people, but read the article first and not just the title. The amount of people who can\'t read properly around here is astonishing', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> **The Saudi Arabian GP showed that if you drive in clean air, you can beat faster cars. That\'s why the battle was so fierce in Turn 1. And that\'s why the timing of the pit stops was all about finding the golden opportunity.**\n\n> The McLaren is a faster car than the Red Bull. And it treats its tires more gently. Nevertheless, Max Verstappen pulled away from his tail, Oscar Piastri, at the end of the first stint. The Ferrari is a slower car than the McLaren, Red Bull, and Mercedes. Nevertheless, Charles Leclerc occasionally set faster lap times than Verstappen and Piastri.\n\n> The secret lies in the position on the track. Those at the front of a pack benefit in two ways. They drive in clean air. This allows the aerodynamics to work optimally. According to the engineers, this is a bonus of at least two-tenths of a second. Those with other cars in front of them experience a worse airflow. The car begins to slide, the tires heat up, and lose grip more quickly.\n\n> Good cars can afford to stay behind for longer than bad ones. But even they get caught up eventually. For 15 laps, Oscar Piastri stayed within Max Verstappen\'s DRS zone. Then the leader took three-tenths of a second per lap off his pursuer. In the second stint, Piastri enjoyed the luxury of a clear run. Until he gradually closed the gap on his teammate, who was driving countercyclically on hard tires. At a distance of 2.5 seconds, Piastri suddenly felt understeer. By then, he was already driving in the turbulent air of Lando Norris.\n\n> **A Grand Prix with two races.**\nIn the fourth year of the ground-effect era, aerodynamics have practically reached their limits. Even small disturbances in the airflow can have major consequences. Therefore, it\'s more important than ever to avoid any cars in front of you. This makes the starting grid, the start, and the timing of pit stops even more important than ever.\n\n> In four of the five Grands Prix, the driver who had the lead after the first corner won the race. That would likely have been the case in Jeddah as well, had Verstappen not received a five-second penalty for defending his position at the start by cutting the first chicane.\n\n> So it was a two-race Grand Prix. Verstappen dominated the first, and Piastri dominated the second. The world champion reduced a 4.8-second deficit to 2.8 seconds, but Piastri only drove as fast as he had to. On the very last lap, he showed his pursuer who was boss in the ring with his personal fastest lap.\n\n> **Lots of risk in the first corner.**\nVerstappen and Piastri knew the first corner would be decisive. Therefore, both took high risks at the braking point. Verstappen\'s was greater because, according to overtaking regulations, the driver on the outside lane is always at a disadvantage. He needs a half-car-length lead at the apex to make the corner his own. For the driver on the inside, the same height is sufficient.\n\n> Overtaking was difficult despite three DRS zones. There were 32 position changes due to differing strategies. Those who didn\'t manage it right away damaged their tires. That\'s why it was so important for Piastri to overtake Lewis Hamilton as quickly as possible after his pit stop. He risked it in the DRS zone, weaving at high speed.\n\n> Drivers stuck in a pack have to drive tactically. It\'s better to leave a three-second gap and only open up at the end of the stint. When timing pit stops, it\'s becoming increasingly important for teams to find gaps in the field to make an undercut or overcut effective. Esteban Ocon gained six positions with his early pit stop in Bahrain, because he had a ten-second gap to the car in front where he fell.\n\n\n> **Overcut gives Leclerc a clear path.**\nIn Jeddah, Ferrari did everything right with the overcut of Charles Leclerc. The fifth-placed driver in the World Championship was within two to three seconds of George Russell in the first stint. Nevertheless, he complained of slight understeer caused by the turbulent air emanating from the Mercedes in front of him.\n\n> When all the drivers ahead of the Ferrari had turned into the pits, Leclerc was in the lead. And he suddenly set lap times that astonished both friend and foe. Leclerc, on ancient medium tires, was getting faster instead of slower. Between laps 21 and 28, he improved from 1:33.9 to 1:33.3. His new pursuers on fresh hard tires were barely faster. Leclerc held on until lap 29, creating a tire gap of ten laps to Piastri, nine to Russell, and eight to Verstappen.\n\n> More importantly, Leclerc had eight laps of clear air before entering George Russell\'s DRS zone. By then, the Mercedes driver had already hit the wall. He had overtaxed his tires while trying to follow the leaders. The front tires became so hot that they blistered. This made Russell easy prey for Leclerc and Norris.\n\n> **Hamilton weak, despite clear driving.**\nRussell couldn\'t even complain about traffic that caused his tires to give out so dramatically. ""The speed in the race was higher than we expected. And we set up the setup a bit too front-heavy,"" the strategists explained.\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli also struggled with hot tires, but to a lesser extent than Russell. In the second stint, the Italian benefited from having the track to himself from the 30th lap onwards. The previous duel with Isack Hadjar had cost rubber, but Antonelli then used the quiet period to give his tires a rest. It paid off. When Hamilton closed in from behind, he had an answer. There was still life in his tires.\n\n> The fifth round of the World Championship was also a sobering experience for Lewis Hamilton. The record winner was on his own for large stretches of the race and yet failed to benefit. He was simply too slow. His personal fastest lap placed him only in seventh place. Given the good conditions, he should have achieved more.\n\n> The Williams drivers were also well positioned in the field from their pit stop. Carlos Sainz and Alexander Albon only had to briefly contend with Esteban Ocon, who had already switched to hard tires during the safety car period. After that, the Williams drivers were able to build up speed unhindered, aiming to get into Isack Hadjar\'s pit stop window. They succeeded. After his late stop on lap 34, Hadjar was up against two Williams cars and was left with a hopeless battle, as one was giving the other DRS.\n\n> **Safety car as friend and foe.**\nLando Norris and Isaac Hadjar proved that bucking the trend and starting with harder tires was a good decision. This automatically brought them into clear air at some point. Norris had clear air for 32 laps, Hadjar for 21.\n\n> Had Norris not been outsmarted twice by Hamilton\'s DRS on the home straight, he would have had more time in reserve later in the duel with Leclerc. Hadjar frustrated Albon twice. In the first stint, he drove six laps into the Williams\' gearbox, and in the second, twelve. Neither of these actions was good for the tires.\n\n> Anyone who tries to gain a clear path with a different tire sequence is playing with fire. You can either hit the bull\'s eye or pull a blank. Ferrari tried it in Bahrain and was cheated by the safety car. From Ferrari\'s perspective, it came too early. Norris, Hadjar, Stroll, and Hülkenberg would have preferred a safety car after lap 23 in Jeddah. That would have given them a free pit stop.', 'This may be the least funny thread in the history of Reddit so far.', 'Dirty air really that bad this season?', ""Like Fred said, F1 is becoming a qualifying world championship, Max was the only pole sitter to lose across the last 5 (6 with the sprint) races they've had, and he only lost because of the T1 incident and penalty."", 'Now that the article reminded me, a positive Hamilton can take from the race is the fact that his defence held up Norris, which meant Leclerc could rocket to the podium.

Does the fact that the broadcast caught it mean he was still holding down the radio button?', 'Is it just me or did Horner’s picture actually help prove why Max deserved a penalty:\n\nOne thing that stood out to me in Horner’s pic was how much steering lock Max had on (with Brundle in commentary originally saying he didn’t have much on). \n\nLooking back at Max’s onboard he does crank the steering lock on from mid corner up until the moment he goes off track. The fact he had so much steering lock on makes it so obvious that he wasn’t going to make the corner just by looking at the trajectory of the car from the video, how he was carrying too much speed and understeering well off track. Obviously the fact he was carrying far too much speed is why he was able to be alongside or even marginally ahead at the apex. But people continue to ignore the making the corner aspect of the rules (this is also why he got a track limits violation).\n\nMy question for discussion is simply why do we think that is? How are there a small subset of people arguing Max was unfairly forced off and shouldn’t have been penalised?\n\nIs it just from such strong allegiance to their driver, a lack of understanding of physics or something else?', 'In your opinion,what are the chracteristic or situations when a driver ""outperforms or outdrives the car""?', 'How would you rank the five races so far in terms of how good a race it was?', ""For all of ferrari's miserable start and perhaps end of season shout out to the pit crew.

So let’s put a wall there, the “Virtual Wall”.\n\nIf a driver has the apex but then goes past track limits, they automatically lose the corner and must give the place back. No equivocation between 5sec or 10sec penalties. Give the position back within one lap.\n\nFighting for a corner?

Piastri barely made the corner but crucially stayed within the white lines, verstappen didn’t hence he deserved a penalty.

Last year, I stated that Piastri was a cold-blooded assassin behind the wheel and that Norris\xa0[lacked the killer instinct](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreed/2024/09/04/three-reasons-why-this-is-the-formula-one-season-of-the-century/)\xa0to be World Champion—at a time when Norris had a commanding lead over Piastri.

While I’ve never hired a racing driver, I’ve hired for all key roles at venture-backed tech startups, and this is the key quality I look for. You don’t need to hire killers for Fortune 500 companies; in fact, they don’t fit in. But startups can only be successful if the founder(s) and leadership team are all killers (also known as A-players). As with F1 and winning the WDC, the margin for error in startups is too small to accept anything less.\n\nWe know that Verstappen is a killer, and we saw two killers go head-to-head in Saudi Arabia. Verstappen got the best of Piastri in qualifying, but Piastri hit back with a brilliant start that led Verstappen to miss the corner entirely and incur a five-second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage. Any objective analysis will conclude that Piastri’s superior start put him ahead of Verstappen and in a position to take the corner. Where was Verstappen supposed to go? He’s a big boy. He should have braked sooner in order to make the corner, which meant he had to slot in behind Piastri. That’s what’s dictated by both the rules and physics. But Verstappen doesn’t think the rules apply to him, and Piastri was under no obligation to give Verstappen room. The corner was his.
