The meeting was chaired by FIA Single-Seater Director Nikolas Tombazis and FOM President and CEO Stefano Domenicali.

**2026 Technical and Sporting Regulations**

Following discussion at the meeting, a raft of refinements to the 2026 Technical, Sporting, Financial and Operational Regulations will be submitted to the World Motor Sport Council on December 10.

A proposal to explore mandatory two pit stops for grands prix was discussed along with adjustments to tyre specifications, tyre-life limits and the use of three compounds during the race. The discussion centred on feedback on analysis and simulations from teams and Pirelli. No changes were presently agreed, but it was agreed that talks on this topic would continue during the 2026 season.


**Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR)**

Changes to Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR) are being developed to bring Formula 1 into line with contemporary processing and simulation technology while mindful of cost considerations.


**Car liveries and driver numbers**

Following discussions with the Technical Advisory Committee, the topic of a minimum surface requirement limit for car liveries in 2026 was discussed.

It was agreed by Commission representatives that a minimum of 55% of surface area (when viewed from the side and above) must be covered by painted or stickered liveries as opposed to bare carbon fibre surfaces. The objective of this measure is to increase visual differentiation between cars.

Changes to the regulation on permanent competition numbers for drivers, introduced for the 2014 season, were discussed. It was agreed that a proposal for drivers to change their numbers during their career would be permitted.

 
**Driving Cooling System**

The potential mandating of the Driving Cooling System (DCS) for 2026 was discussed. Re-designs to the current DCS and cooling garments were proposed along with an increased weight allowance for use of the DCS. Further driver feedback will be sought in parallel with the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association (GPDA).","['This is pretty positive imo. The 55% paint is definitely a step in the right direction.

I took a look at their gap between each other in actual time interval (seconds), and then also took a look at the gap between them as a percentage of overall lap time, to adjust for the range of different circuits' lap times. 

Notes:

* I excluded the races where either driver had a crash in Q3 (Jeddah for Norris, Baku for Piastri). I considered using their Q2 times, but Norris had the faster time in Q2 in Jeddah, so it didn’t really feel like it would be representative of their actual performances that weekend. If you want to take a look at what it would look like with Jeddah and Baku, [I made an alt graph here](https://imgur.com/a/JGc4GMM). For that one, I used Norris' Q2 time in Jeddah against Piastri's Q3 time, and used both of their Q2 times for Baku
* For Austria, I used Norris' first Q3 lap for comparison since Piastri was unable to get a second lap due to the yellow flag. Their actual gap in that qualifying was over 0.5s. if you’re curious what the graph would look like [I made another alternate here](https://imgur.com/a/qZrsiOd).
* I made both grand prix only and sprint inclusive versions to get a full picture of the entire season, since I know sprints are not usually considered in qualifying head-to-head records but ultimately still do show a trend on how teammates compare in a qualifying context. 

Let me know if you spot anything that doesn't look right in my numbers or methodology. I just thought it was interesting to visualize, interested to hear others' thoughts.","[""Cool comparison and it's interesting to see the way the tide shifted so dramatically\xa0\n\n\nI\xa0would say it's probably better to treat the data consistently unless you are going to have a more comprehensive cleaning process.

I believe higly competitive people such as sportsmen and women should be able to push the limits but where should the line be drawn? Drivers like Senna and Schumacher were always tough on track and wouldn't think twice about blocking etc but then again we have drivers like Prost who always used their competitive nature off the track even to the point of corruption to get what they want out of people.

On a side note, I was a young Mansell fan at that time and so didn't really care for either Prost or Senna but I have since grown to appreciate both for various reasons like their diffent driving styles.","[""> Has it changed your opinion? \n\nNo, it hasn't. it was clear at the time Prost deliberately punted Senna off the track.

I've read a ton of media from the period, and while the possibility that Prost turned in to crash deliberately was considered, most seemed to consider it a racing incident.

Mario Andretti meanwhile seemed to think it a racing incident where both drivers did exactly what he would have done in their positions](https://postimg.cc/tZCjPJ58).

I've never seen any actual proof of him saying that he intended to deliberately take Senna out, but what he did say is that he was tired of having to leave the door open when Senna tried marginal moves on him while Senna didn't do the same in return. I think he therefore chose to slam the door incredibly aggressively, and did not care what happened. The collision was the result, so it was definitely much more on Prost that Senna, but I honestly don't think it was a cynical attempt to deliberately take him out (after all, if that's your goal why pick the slowest corner on the track where any damage has a higher chance of being recoverable?)"", ""That's not a racing incident.

I'm new to F1, and DtS is partly why I became interested, but I've since recognized the danger of this show. For me, the worst of it is the potential for historical revisionism.  
  
Archived broadcasts of races and articles of races will probably be harder for future audiences to access and they will instead rely on DtS to ""learn"" how certain races and seasons went. They will have vastly different perceptions from those who watched the races live, or who at least read about them soon after they occurred or watched highlight vids.  


Archived races become paywalled. Articles get paywalled or even simply deleted all too often. Highlight vids get claimed and/or deleted all too often. Blogs come and go.

I think DtS is more likely to remain, and if that's all that future audiences have to easily assess legacies of those racing now, then the fictionalized narratives and misleading emphasis on certain elements will become the revised historical narrative. The new audience will outnumber those who saw it happen without a DtS episode.

  
I like the idea of a cinematic docu-series that highlights the drama of the sport, but can't it be done without inventing straight up fiction? The legacies of these drivers, mechanics, engineers, and staff may become falsified for those not yet born, and it may become too complex to untangle and rectify even by those who care.","['That will happen with DtS or without.

When that does likely happen, it will be pretty historic that ends of run of dominance by Red Bull and Mercedes. 

Norris/Lando would break the F1 WDC record of longest conscience wins by the same two constructors. A Red Bull or Mercedes driver has won last the 14 WDC among Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, and Max Verstappen. It also inches McLaren closer to tying Ferrari’s F1 leading 15 WDC by a constructor. 

The next closest run was from 1984-1993 when McLaren and Williams won 10 straight WDC with Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, and Nigel Mansell

It will stop another record from being broken as Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton are tied for the longest WDC consecutive streak of the same 2 drivers at 7 years. This is tied with Juan Manuel Fangio and Alberto Ascari also winning 7 straight years from 1951-1957

Maybe it’s because McLaren has had the fastest car on the grid for about a season and a half now, but this will truly mark an end of dominate era of F1. Feels like it’s not as big of a deal, but it truly is. Redbull and Mercedes have dominated the hybrid era (and the final stages of the V8 era) with so many changes over the last 14 years including the cost cap, ground effect being reintroduced, the mandating of the halo cockpit, the ever increasing size of the F1 car, DRS system, banning in-race refueling, etc.  Jensen Button’s winning car from 2009 looks so different and operated in such a different environment from the McLaren that will be on display likely soon. 

Obviously there is a chance that this is just a blip and Red Bull and Mercedes nail the 2026 regulations and Max Vertstappen still does indeed exist. Does just go to show how remarkable Red Bull and Mercedes run is given all the changes and still staying dominant and even the streak Verstappen and Hamilton have been on.

From the Senna & Prost collision to the Belgian 1998 GP start (appalling, worst ever)... His commentary was always  straight to the point and just human reactions, no personal bias, no patriotic bias for English drivers, just simply true commentary of the events unfolding in front of him.

In recent age of F1 commentary, I think the only person who even comes close to that is Martin Brundle. All the other commentators always seem to be biased towards UK drivers. 
Brundle (while at times his fanboying of Hamilton came out) tried his best to be neutral and actually acknowledge the talent and performance of every other driver.

Am I wrong about this? I'd love to discuss this. 

FYI, This post was inspired by Brundle's commentary on the 2012 European GP in Valencia. There was a moment in that race when Hamilton passed Schumacher and Brundle almost said ""Hamilton passing slower traffic"" but stopped himself and recognized that it was Schumacher, and then even commented how he had to stop himself mid-sentence because calling Schumacher ""slower traffic"" wasn't right.

Brundle didn't care which driver was from what country, he respected talent no matter where it came from.
