1nak7iq,Why did Mercedes reveal the DAS system in 2020 instead of 2021?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nak7iq/why_did_mercedes_reveal_the_das_system_in_2020/,2025-09-07, Discussion,"I still don't understand to this day why Mercedes decided to reveal DAS during the 2020 pre-season test. We know today that the Mercedes W11 of 2020 is the most dominant, even the fastest car of all time. They essentially had both the WDC and WCC wrapped up weeks before the teams even headed to Melbourne for the season opener and based on pre-season tests like 2023, teams are highly aware when one team has a dominant car aka the Red Bull so Mercedes of all teams should've also been aware of the gap their 2020 challenger had over the competition.


Moreover, we know also from previous testimony from ex-Mercedes members like Paddy Lowe that in 2014, they deliberately ran low engine modes to hide their enormous gap they built in the new regulations to slow the FIA down from allowing the regulations to let the other teams catch-up.


This begs the question - why didn't they save DAS for the 2021 season? It's of course easier to say with hindsight after COVID happened and the 7 straight years of Mercedes dominance since 2014 that nobody expected Red Bull to produce a title challenger for 2021. Nevertheless, considering Lewis and Max were literally on equal points going into Abu Dhabi in 2021, DAS could've easily been the difference between Lewis winning the WDC and not had it not been banned for the 2021 season which Mercedes facilitated by revealing it in 2020.","[""Sry i stole the Crystal ball from Mercedes in late 2019\n\nThey simply couldn't have known they would be so dominant in 2020 and not 2021 without it."", 'Wasn‚Äôt 2020 supposed to be the last year of the regulations?

1navn43,I'm actually shocked at how negative the reactions are in the F1 world towards sportsmanship,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1navn43/im_actually_shocked_at_how_negative_the_reactions/,2025-09-07, Discussion,"As somone who was watching F1 as a kid, then stopped, and is coming back more and more those last few years, I'm actually surprised at how many F1 fans view sportsmanship actions such as Piastri's today as bad.  
  
In a marathon, if someone leads a race, but misses the last refreshment point and as a result drops 100m from the finish line, and the second runner picks them up to help them win because they deserve it, both of them would be celebrated.  
The second one would be seen as a hero for high sportsmanship, while the other runner would still be celebrated for winning the race.  
  
But in Formula 1, it seems like people have been matrixed into thinking that to be a real champion, you need to be brutal and not care about what is or is not fair.  
We all want to see an insane fight for the title, but can't we also be happy that some drivers on the track are able to take fair decisions?","['Sportsmanship is kicking the ball out of play if you see someone is injured or in distress, it isn\'t saying ""after you Claude"" and letting the opponent kick the ball in the net', ""What sportmanship?
