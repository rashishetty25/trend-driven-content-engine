The spectacle continues to decline, its treated like a testing bed for technologies that dont benefit the sport. It appears as if the only goal is to line the owners of F1s pockets with as much money as possible and at any cost.\n\nThey will happily ditch circuits that the fans love and replace them with awful street circuits, funded by dirty money gathered from the very resource they claim to want to use less of. They continue to add more and more GPs putting more and more strain on everyone involved.\n\nThey claim to care about the environment yet they add more and more travel to the calendar, polluting more and more. They even sign deals with countries who are the worst polluters on earth while shoving their politically motivated green agenda down your throats.\n\nF1 has turned from probably the peak of motorsport into an eco tech proving ground, funded by oil money from the middle east, masquerading as a motorsport. A ""sport"" that claims it wants to be net zero, but has no issue doing deals with countries that have no interest in cutting back their emissions at all. In fact they dont seem to really are at all, as long as it lines their pockets.\n\nWe are literally in a scenario where Germany, a country which has a total of 3 world champions and has won a total of 12 drivers titles doesnt have GP, yet a continent who cant even get a driver into the sport hosts 4. They dont even have a sporting or racing heritage and their tracks are awful.\n\nSo I must ask. Why do any of you watch it?', 'car go fast', '>They dont even have a sporting or racing heritage\n\nHow are they supposed to get a ""sporting or racing heritage""? All you\'re doing is gate-keeping.', 'So basically you need to be easily stimulated.', 'For a start build some good circuits, prove those circuits in lower level series first, grow the sport in your country off of your own back and start to try and grow some talent, along with the infrastructure to host high quality races.\n\nYou dont have to just jump in right at the deep end of F1, they should all be made to start small and prove themselves first.\n\nYou need to gatekeep otherwise you end up with the deluge of low quality circuits we have now.']",1,6,0.55,1,5,5,-1,3,-0.07999999999999996,-1

1hyozsz,Why Sainz is sure to improve Williams pace overtime,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hyozsz/why_sainz_is_sure_to_improve_williams_pace/,2025-01-11, Discussion,"  I was watching some old videos from Red Bull Racing, where they followed Liam and Alex throughout their DTM season, and what really caught my attention was that in the parts where they are discussing what needs to be changed in the car, what's bothering them and etc., you can notice how they focus on the consequences and not the actual problem. For an example in this video (10:30-11:30): [https://youtu.be/kgYVQcOZPC8?si=WxpTPVuiymtWTY7U&t=630](https://youtu.be/kgYVQcOZPC8?si=WxpTPVuiymtWTY7U&t=630), it's all about how the car is understeery, how it feels to take a turn and how it affects their lap.  
  
  Sainz, in the other hand immediately gives a direction for the team to focus on, while asking for more data so he can be sure that what he's asking is in the right path, like we can see in the new Williams video (5:21-6:30): [https://youtu.be/wi7XrM020j8?si=wwAtLQp8mOLwghbo&t=321](https://youtu.be/wi7XrM020j8?si=wwAtLQp8mOLwghbo&t=321).

  Obviously we'll never know everything that each drivers discuss with their team and how they appproach it, but i don't know, if what the team was comfortable sharing with us already shows so much of how he actually is engaged in the setup, behind the scenes (as he hints in 6:11-6:22, with how the last tunings made already betterded the car a lot) must be pretty impressive, is no wonder why that every team he's been part of improved quickly with his arrival.","['It’s the team that gets better over time. A single person is not going to turn a whole organization around. Williams has been either 9th or 10th in constructors and will likely stay there for the foreseeable future.\n\nI don’t doubt Sainz is a top tier driver and he has definitely made teams flow smoother along the way but you have to be realistic. The narrative that Sainz has made teams better once he’s there is just happenstance. When he was at McLaren that team started to get on the right track once Fernando left. 2019 was a good year for them and they have gotten faster since. With Ferrari, we know this has been a top 3 team for decades.', 'Drivers do not develop the car and setup feedback is not design work.\n\nCarlos is a great technical driver that often talks about or shows that he enjoys and cares about the tech, but it isn’t him that will make decisions about what to do with the new floor or the data from CFD. What he can do is find the right balance between practice sessions and during the preparations in the simulator. And of course help with feedback for correlation purposes, but that’s also mostly data collection.', 'Thank you for comparing Albon’s 2021 feedback in DTM, a new series for him where he might not have had the expertise to address certain issues, with Sainz’s 2024 feedback in F1, after he immediately switched the teams and had access to detailed information for comparing the two cars on the same track.\n\nNext one, please.']",0,3,0.17,0,3,3,0,0,-0.04999999999999999,0
