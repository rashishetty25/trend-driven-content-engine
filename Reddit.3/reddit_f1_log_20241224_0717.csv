1hkvmr3,[Mercedes AMG F1] 23/12/2009: The day Michael Schumacher announced his return to F1 with Mercedes,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkvmr3/mercedes_amg_f1_23122009_the_day_michael/,2024-12-23, Social Media,,"['Damn, right after the Russell skiing post', '""Oh yeah 7 more titles incoming"" - some random fan in 2009', ""I wasn't watching back then, but it must have been such a crazy announcement to hear. Were there rumors for a while before it was announced?"", 'Michael’s comeback success was different that what everyone expected. But this announcement was insane at the time. For people who had followed him in his first career knew he left too early, still capable of amazing drives. \n\nThe motorcycle accident definitely changed what he could do on a race track, there were some serious injuries, and one to the skull which generally results in a fatality. \n\nYet  the 40 year old improved every year till he retired again. In his final year he was faster than Rosberg in race pace and they were 10-10 in Quali. Rosberg in his prime against a 43 year old, who also got pole in Monaco.\n\nMichael in my opinion is in the top 3 of Grand Prix racing. Wish he could be in the paddock and part of the current formula 1 culture. #KeepFightingMichael', ""I had pretty much stopped watching F1 regularly once he retired in 2006. By 2009, my cable tv package no longer had the sports channel that broadcast F1. I remember being so excited hearing Schumi's come back, i switched to a more expensive cable package. His first test was in a GP2 car, he came within 4/10ths of the lap record sitting in a race car for the first time in over 3 yrs and in a machinery completely different to what he was used to. You could see he still had the pace between 2010 to 2012, but reliability issues, mid-grid positions prone to crashes and few unforced errors pretty much brought an end to his comeback. Ross Brawn would later credit Schumacher's feedback and work with the engineers are being the foundation for Mercedes championship success in 2014.\n\nWe now know both Williams and Mclaren tried signing Schumacher multiple times in the 90s and 2000s. It is anyones guess how many more titles he could have won had he jumped from one competitive team to another instead of toiling much of the 90s without titles at Ferrari.

It's hilarious. Like why the fuck are you saying this now?"", ""No, you're at fault for failing both drivers in helping them perform to the best they could achieve every weekend. The fact that Mekies still has a job there is the ultimate insult because he consistently fucks the drivers in the race every single time.\n\nIf they hadn't fucked them over every single time they went out things would have looked a lot different for Daniel."", 'I also blame my team for never making it to formula1.', ""Despite everything having played out as it has, deep down, my gut tells me that had daniel gotten the RB main seat, he would've done really well. And no, this is not me and my wishful thinking, I genuinely believe so.\n\nWhen that vcarb was semi-decent early in the season, daniel hit some peaks in his performance, putting it among the top 5, where it just does not belong, definitely not in Q3 quali in the top 5 with 4 top teams hogging the top 8 spots. Given a good car, one that speaks to his strengths, his peaks could genuinely be hit more often. His problem, and VCARBs problem was that the car was generally a shitbox, and often the team self-sabotaged with strategy.\n\nI think the RB main team's car is exactly that - A more refined formula 1 car that suits his strengths well, ones that he shares with Max, on the extremes of balance. There is a reason RB have struggled to find someone capable of filling that seat since daniel left, because genuinely no one else can likely keep up with the car's design direction the way max does. But daniel already had done so, before he left. He was the last direct rival to max in that seat, driving the same car, with the same development directions.\n\nNot to mention, Vcarb TP mekies and ceo bayer repeatedly praised daniel on his technical inputs that helped in developing their car, something they don't really do/did in Yuki's case. That should not come as a surprise given what daniel achieved at Renault with that shitbox of a car and team. RB could've benefitted more from having Daneil in the 2nd seat giving his inputs that were on the same track as max, rather than put up with checo's nonsense for so long, that caused them to waste so much development time and even rollback the chassis on his car just to please him and clear the air on 'its the car' discourse. So much valuable time and development lost that could've been avoided if Daniel was in that seat, working in tandem with Max.\n\nAnyways, that's just my 2 cents. Sorry for the pseudo-rant.\n\nTL;DR:  Daniel's peaks in a shitty vcarb that he helped develop & improve with his feedback would've translated very well to the main RB team where he would work with Max on the same development direction (their driving styles are similar), instead of wasting valuable time and money on checo and the opposite development direction for the 2nd car.  They never replaced Daniel, the only driver apart from Max that did excellently in that main team with the same development direction that Max prefers."", ""At this point I'm convinced any mention of Daniel in a news article is an attempt by the publisher for clicks. It's time for the F1 media to let it go (and I'm a fan of his!)."", 'Well tbf RB jr has always had ATROCIOUS strategy calls, especially when it comes to raining conditions.\n\nAnyone remember Gasly in 2018 or Vergne in Monaco 2012?

1hkqm89,Women liking F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkqm89/women_liking_f1/,2024-12-23, Discussion,"so I'm a teen (f) and I've been watching F1 since I can remember. I literally grew up watching every race, my father being a hard-core fan. Hell I saw some of these ""big"" races, like I remember watching anxiously as Romain Grosjean spun off, the car catching fire and I even remember then the feed being cut off cause they did not want to show anymore incase he didn't make it out alive. 

Anyway, I've been a core ferrari fan all my life. It's not because of any one thing in particular and I don't support all of the teams decisions, but because it was a team my father once supported. I fell in love with RED and the emotions attached with the teams previous driver like Räikkönen and Vettel. 

But now, it's become so insanely mainstream. Drive to survive has made it into this insanely big thing where there are so many people who now all of a sudden care about motorsport only cause the drivers look good. There's no issue with being a new fan, however my issue is that so many people talking only about the drivers looks invalidates the skill and people who care about the racing aspect, especially as a woman.
The moment you talk about F1 with men who don't know you, the first assumption is that we only watch the sport cause of the men. I had to mention the ferrari thing earlier now because it happens a lot more when you saw you're a ferrari fan.

Now, obviously certain men are the issue but it's genuinely becoming increasingly common to have a view point as such and I wanted to know of other women who watch F1 have experienced a similar outlook.

Disclaimer, I'm not talking about all men or only men but it's simply an observation.","[""For every gate there's a crappy keeper that wants to deem people not worthy. Never feel the need to prove your f1ness to some asshat.

People that are worth your time will come to realize that you love F1 for the racing, and those that don’t, just don’t waste your time worrying about them. \n\nI’m sure your dad knows that you like the racing, and your close friends probably do too.

I've been watching since '95 or so and it was like that back then too. It used to bother me too, but I learned just ignore them. You don't have to be able to name the top 3 of every single Monaco race since the dawn of time to be a fan. You don't have to justify yourself to some insecure bozo. \n\nMy personal opinion is that people are free to enjoy a sport however they please. If they go for a driver for looks, that's their choice. It doesn't hinder my enjoyment of the sport in any way, so why should it bother me? I'm sure drivers don't mind: more money for them from merch and buzz.\n\n I'll save my annoyance for developments such as INSANE ticket pricing, or what races they put in (\\*cough\\* Qatar \\*cough\\*) or take out (German GP!), or Helmut Marko LOL"", 'Wait....

There's no doubt he was a fantastic driver, but how fantastic, exactly? \n\nI recently watched Beat Zehnder's beyond the grid, where he rated Raikkonen as the fastest driver he worked with. Additionally, Marc Priestley said that Raikkonen was the fastest driver he ever worked with, even quicker than Alonso and Hamilton. Furthermore, Vettel mentioned in his beyond the grid that Raikkonen was the most naturally gifted team mate he ever worked with.\n\nHe's an interesting case for me, and the reason why he's an interesting case is because you can hear all these things about how good a driver Raikkonen was, with some extremely high (and over the top) praise of his skill level. But the problem is........that praise isn't really translated to his results on the track.\xa0 As good as he was, he doesn't really live up to the hype.\n\nI really struggle to believe that Raikkonen was this amazing top driver on Michelin tyres exclusively, and never recovered once Michelin quit F1. That doesn't logically follow for me, and seems like a convenient way to paint Raikkonen as better than he really was (of which, don't get me wrong, he was amazing, but what people say about him seems over the top). \n\nYet I can't deny that what insiders say about him tend to see it differently , that Raikkonen was actually **that** good.\n\nTl,Dr - simple question \nDo you think that Raikkonen was a driver, who early in his career,\xa0 was on par with Alonso & Schumacher?""]",2,1,1.0,2,1,1,2,1,1.0,2
