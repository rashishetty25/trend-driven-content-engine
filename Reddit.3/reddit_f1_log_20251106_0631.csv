As McLaren admitted to before the summer break, **it is a stance that opens the risk for a title defeat like McLaren suffered in 2007, when Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen came through the middle to triumph against Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso.**\n\n\n>Speaking on F1’s Beyond the Grid podcast, **McLaren CEO Zak Brown believed that sticking to the team’s principles of fairness between its drivers mattered much more than the final result in the championship. Asked what the response would be if Verstappen came through and won, Brown said: *“I shake his hand and say, job well done. I want to make sure if we don’t win, he beats us. We don’t beat ourselves. That’s important.""***\n\n\n\n>***“We’re well aware of 2007. Two drivers tie on points, one gets in the front. But you know, we’ve got two drivers who want to win the world championship. We’re playing offence. We’re not playing defence.

Forget it. That’s not how we go racing. In the event that 2007 happens again, I’d rather have that outcome than all the other outcomes by playing favourites. We won’t do it.”***\xa0\n\n\n>McLaren team principal **Andrea Stella added: *“If Max is the champion at the end of the year, for us, the important thing is that we can say we have done our best and we have done our best according to the way we go racing. And if Max wins this year, we say we’re going to win next year, we’re going to be there and we are going to be united as we are.”***\n\n\n>**He also refuted any suggestion that there would be any bias within the team**. *""So when you are in my role, it’s like when you have two sons and somebody says, \'Which one is your preferred son?\' Yeah, but they are my two sons, how can you say which one is the preferred one?""* Stella said.\n\n\n>*""Sometimes when I hear or read some comments of this kind, I find them really very superficial and just like, I think sometimes people don’t really understand what it means to have two drivers that are with you together in this journey in Formula 1. I just feel very grateful to both, in fairness.""*', ""You know what? Fair enough.
