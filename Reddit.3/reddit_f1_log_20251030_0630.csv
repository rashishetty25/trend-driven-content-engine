In one of many introspective moments, revealing both Wolff’s struggles with mental health and his endearingly literal way of expressing himself in his second language, he explains: “Susie’s emotionally much more resilient than I am. She’s mentally stable, somebody I can rely on. I have episodes where I’m really depressed. So I say, ‘I’m a bit like an Arabian thoroughbred. You put me in the cage before the start and I won’t like it at all. But once that thing opens, I run.’ On the other hand, Austria has these famous workhorses.

With Interlagos on the calendar this weekend, I’ve been feeling a bit nostalgic. I went back through the history of Formula One season finales since 1990, and it reminded me how much the end of the year used to feel different.

1985 - 1995: Australia (Adelaide) closed the season

1996 - 1999: Japan (Suzuka or Jerez in ’97)

2000 - 2005: Mostly Japan or Malaysia/China

2004 - 2008: Brazil’s Interlagos - the golden run of finales

2009 - 2025: Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina Circuit has taken over ever since


For me, Interlagos just has something no other circuit can replicate. The atmosphere is electric, the weather unpredictable, and the fans make it feel like the whole sport’s heartbeat is right there in São Paulo. Those finales gave us so many iconic moments - Raikkonen’s 2007 title shock, Hamilton’s 2008 “Is that Glock?!” drama, Vettel’s 2012 charge through the field.

Abu Dhabi has its glamour, but Interlagos always delivered chaos, emotion and pure racing theatre. I sometimes wonder if my fondness for it is just nostalgia - because so many emotional memories are tied to it being the last race - or if it’s genuinely the perfect place to end a season. It's just such a great track in any case.  

What do you all think?
