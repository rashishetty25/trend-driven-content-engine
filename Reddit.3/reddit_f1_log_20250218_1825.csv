While he will start the championship with rookie Jack Doohan as a team-mate, he will discover another collaboration, but looks forward very positively to 2023 and 2024.\n\nDespite some tense moments, right up to the controversial collision at the Monaco Grand Prix last May, the French driver considers that Alpine was lucky to have this duo, particularly in the way it salvaged an unexpected sixth place in the constructors' championship last year.\n\n“It's true that we haven't really had the opportunity to say goodbye,” confided Pierre Gasly on Tuesday in London, when Esteban Ocon had left Alpine for Haas prematurely, not taking part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. “I think it was, when you think about it, the kind of story that we'll find hallucinating in twenty or thirty years' time. When we were told it was impossible to make it in F1, we both made it, in the same French team. It's a very beautiful story, with the podium in Brazil that will remain memorable.”\n\n**Fortunately, there were two drivers like us, both talented and motivated.**\n\nPierre Gasly also believes that the 100% French duo, while explosive on paper, proved the most skeptical of the pairing wrong.\n\n“We've proved that we're professionals,” he insists. “Everyone told us it would be a mess with both of us on the team. But it's a good thing there were two drivers like us, talented and motivated, because in-house competition allows us to give it our all. We never gave up, and if we managed to turn around what was a very complicated season last year, it's also partly thanks to the work we did together. We can be happy about that.”\n\nFrom now on, Pierre Gasly will cross paths with his compatriot on the track, but in the colors of Haas, which doesn't necessarily change his state of mind.\n\n“The rivalry has always been there,” he admits. “I've got 19 rivals on the grid, whether it's Esteban, Charles \\[Leclerc\\], Lewis \\[Hamilton\\]... After that, there are animosities between everyone and it's up to us to manage that. I'm a professional, I fight hard on the track but with respect, no matter who I'm up against.”"", 'The final straw for me with DTS was them trying to spin it into being a disaster. \n\nAlpine might be a mess, both those guys did just fine together.', 'I remember joking that it was going to be ""dinamite"". I\'m happy they had Brazil as a goodbye as team mates, they both looked really happy.', ""Let's be real here.  The problem at Alpine isn't Ocon and Gasly.  It's fucking Alpine.   I think they made the best out of a very bad situation.  Yes, they had a couple of dust ups  (all the teams do, now and again, don't they?), but they were \\*not\\* the problem."", ""It might have been a mess. If the car wasn't so bad."", 'Ocon has the win at all cost attitude of a champion. He just doesn’t have the talent of one.', 'Brazil 24 demonstrated how far ahead Gasly and Ocon are skill-wise to the rest of the grid', ""Would've been even better without the totally avoidable Monaco incident."", 'Gasly’s F1 career could be a blockbuster movie trilogy at some point\n\nPart 1: Having arrived to the sport as a hot up-and-coming talent, he gets a shot at the front of the field next to one of the most talented drivers to ever exist. The pressure mounts, he flounders in comparison to his teammate, and winds up getting demoted back into the midfield. Around the same time, one of his best friends tragically loses his life. Determined as ever, Gasly puts up some of the best midfield performances ever, climaxing at his Monza 2020 win and continuing through 2021.\n\nPart 2: Gasly decides that after seeing AlphaTauri’s struggles in 2022, it’s time for a change of scenery. He winds up getting pitted against a childhood rival whom the media attempts to paint as his enemy. Their first year together is marred with collisions in Australia and Hungary, and the start of their second year sees them floundering at the tail end of the field. However, they have some stellar performances at the season end, highlighted by the double podium in Brazil, and wind up way higher up the WCC order than they anticipated at the start of the year.\n\nPart 3: ???']",673,96,0.98,673,88,88,98,5,0.010000000000000009,98
