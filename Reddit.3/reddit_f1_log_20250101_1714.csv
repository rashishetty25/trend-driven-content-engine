So at the peak of the winter break, I ask your predictions on how the 2025 season will end in terms of rivalry of Williams pair Sainz and Albon. 

You can predict any statistics you want, from race&quali H2H to WDC points if you feel lucky.

I'll start:
Race Head to Head: 14-9 in favor of Sainz (I reckon there will be 1 race they'll both DNF'd)

Qualifying Head to Head: 13-11 in favor of Sainz

WDC Positions: Sainz P8, Albon P11

My hope is that the pace Albon showed in his first races at RB (and started to recover towards the end of 2020) is more of who he is up against the best, rather than the pace he had in most of 2020. Not sure if that makes sense, but I think about those races where he got punted from a probable win and a probable 2nd place and am always wondering what if? He‚Äôs talked a lot about how everything that happened at RB really messed with his head over time and he seems like he‚Äôs in a much stronger place mentally now.\n\nIf he gets his clock cleaned then he‚Äôs probably done in F1 after his current contract (and I suppose before if it‚Äôs really bad, but I think that would take a lot), which would be sad as I really like him as a person, but I don‚Äôt think he has enough stock to survive that when Williams has Colapinto (who I think is overhyped, but is promising) in the wings.', 'Sainz is going to have him for a light supper', 'I disagree with basically every prediction.

Williams has been at times fast but an unstable platform, bad on tyres, whereas the Ferrari has been able to be pushed right to the limit (both Sainz and LeClerc have been able to recover big slides)\n\nIf Williams get their stability sorted out then Sainz and Albon will be well-matched, with Sainz shading it. If they don't, I expect Albon to lead the way and Sainz to come back towards the end of the season, with Albon ending up leading driver because of a fast start.\n\nTo be honest, as to who scores the most points, that will probably be down to luck and retirements.\n\nAs a pairing, it's very, very strong, and probably more than Williams' performances deserve""]",79,148,0.81,79,1470,1470,-1,0,0.0,-1
