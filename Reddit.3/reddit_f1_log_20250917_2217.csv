And they zoomed in on the sustainable fuel and all the extra consequences it might bring.. for one; not all teams get free fuel from their fuel sponsor. Sustainable fuel will be like much more expensive, where they pay for like 2-3 million for fuel per season, this could go up to 12-15 million per season with sustainable fuel. That's a serious increase in costs for smaller teams. Just to have ""cleaner"" fuel.

Also there are talks about the fuel being standardised and that would eliminate the r&d aspect and thus make it less interesting for partner ships..how important are these partnerships? Sometimes you hear they gained some power because of better fuel, but it's marginal.

And is it fair, some teams have to pay for fuel and others don't?

What do you guys think, are these unintended side effects / collateral damage worth pursuing sustainable fuel? Will it really trickle down to the consumer automotive? It's been a long time since we have seen any substantial contribution from F1 to the automotive industry, for normal people. Not the hybrid supercars with F1 style power trains. And should F1 be a test lab for consumer automotive? 

The plus side of the sustainable fuel idea is that it comes with the return of V8, (after there wasn't a consensus abot the V10) but that's only a plus if the V8 can be like in the old days and not muzzled like the V6. Because if the V8 is just as fuel flow / rev Limited the sound won't be much better. what benefits are there to a V8 then? Just more power?

Sustainable fuels are a far better option for everyone. Yes, developing these fuels costs money, and some companies are further ahead than others. Nevertheless, if racing can introduce fuel formulas that clearly work, the benefits will eventually trickle down to the general population, making it a priority worth pursuing.

I see it going something like this, Vettel doesn't initially gel at Merc so Rosberg wins his first championship 2 years earlier than real life.
