I disagree slightly because controversy over stewarding decisions hasn\'t always been THIS bad. There have been periods in F1 where the stewards were able to quickly come to the correct decision without any problem. Of course it won\'t always be perfect.\n\nCharles also says that they need to introduce more common sense in to the stewarding process and less black and white guidelines because it is impossible for the guidelines to cover every single scenario and incident.

The guidelines are written very rigidly, and I put zero blame on the stewards making their decisions based on what the guidelines outright say.\n\nI cannot imagine it\'s possible to rigidly outline rules for every racing scenario - I think there needs to be some vagueness for something as fluid as w2w racing.', 'The problem with the stewarding is that they are having far too much impact on race outcomes for such subjective decisions (and I’m specifically talking about contact/passes not rules like moving before the start). Stewarding and reffing should not be so visibly fucking with the sport. I’d rather see no rules and let the drivers self-enforce like nascar does than have what we have now. I think Sainz’s idea makes sense - I’d like to see one season of a PAID group of former professional drivers or expert race analysts doing the stewarding for crashes.\n\nRegular Track limits, start/stop procedures etc can be done by volunteers but not these highly impactful subjective decisions about contact/passes.', 'I don’t mean to be controversial or a contrarian but can someone give me a good reason why the current rules don’t work?

But when Piastri does it, causes a crash, and by the guidelines doesn’t meet the criteria for a safe pass everyone wants to blame the driver that closed the door. \n\nI guess my point is, the current rules are strong enough to make the drivers have to be certain on their judgement and not just wing it. While the alternative is far more risk for both drivers and allows more subjective judging to determine if it’s just “racing” or a penalty', ""The only problem with this is ... when a decision is controversial (and there's bound to be some) then there's nothing to fall back on.\xa0"", '\\>There have been periods in F1 where the stewards were able to quickly come to the correct decision without any problem.\n\n\\>Something myself and I\'m sure others have been saying for several years now.\n\nI don\'t want to sound harsh, but i\'ve read this take on litterally every sport i\'ve been a fan of.
