1l0qmxh,A 10 second time penalty for Max is not enough. The precedent for deliberate crashes was already set in 1997.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l0qmxh/a_10_second_time_penalty_for_max_is_not_enough/,2025-06-01, Discussion,"When Schumacher intentionally crashed into a driver in 1997, he was disqualified from the championship. I am not saying a penalty this harsh should be given here, but a 10s penalty is an absolute joke.

Max slowed down to let George ahead, then torpedo'd him. This is undeniably a deliberate crash by Max. This behaviour is absolutely unacceptable and should not be given such a lenient penalty. Such disgusting, reckless, and endangering behaviour should be given a race ban at minimum. The FIA needs to make it clear that intentionally crashing with other drivers is a step too far.

Edit: The circumstances are obviously different to my example. Schumacher crashed into his championship rival, Max didn't. That's why I don't think a championship DSQ is reasonable, but he still needs to be punished more than he currently is.

Edit 2: And the holy stewards decided it was a 10s penalty and 3 penalty points. Russell got a bigger penalty in Monaco for overtaking off track, and Kmag got banned for less. What an absolute joke.

For me, today‚Äôs race highlighted the issues, but it‚Äôs been like this for a while, I think it discourages racing. What I want, and what I think of, when cars are racing is a show of skill, talent and bravery. A recent example being Max around the outside of Oscar at Imola T1. Space should be left ALWAYS, inside or out, the person making the overtake should have to work for it and use their talent to pull off the move. What is becoming a real issue, and ruining racing in general, is the idea that because you get to the apex first, you have rights to the corner and can force another driver off. That kills all racing. You practically act as if the other car doesn‚Äôt exist, continue on your line and push them into the grass, gravel, or a wall. Racing can‚Äôt exist. You dive late on the brakes, get to the apex first, push the driver off. If anything, the guy being pushed off will get a penalty, damage, or told to give the position back. It‚Äôs formula 1‚Äôs equivalent of diving in football. I wish they‚Äôd change it so it would encourage better racing between all drivers. 

There have been plenty of moves where the drivers have raced fairly, Alonso around the outside of many drivers at T3 in Spain. Lando and Oscar fighting occasionally (yes they‚Äôre teammates but sportsmanship should shown throughout the grid, and encouraged). Moves where just enough room is given. 

Idk, it‚Äôs getting annoying seeing cars dive and others taking avoiding action off the road just for it to turn into an argument over the radio, rather than an on track scrap ü§∑


Edit : I don‚Äôt have enough comment karma to comment on here apparently so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs being seen and what isn‚Äôt. It appears to be 60/40 on the rule being utter nonsense. Which is nice to see. To the other 40% of you, what is it about this style of racing you enjoy? Someone asked what I would change, I think it‚Äôs fairly obvious. Both cars are responsible for looking after themselves, and their competitors. Therefore, you do not push a driver off track, you leave space at all times whilst in a fight for position, inside or out. This should be in the fibres of the sport, it‚Äôs not a spectacle seeing cars get shunted off track and it be classed as an overtake.

How did Nico H√ºlkenberg pull off the Sauber sensation? Why did Red Bull opt for three stops? Did Charles Leclerc\'s strategy pay off? We answer the remaining questions in our race analysis.**\n\n> **Why did Red Bull choose a three-stop strategy?**\nAt the beginning of the race, things were going quite well for Max Verstappen. He overtook Lando Norris in the McLaren in the very first corner and moved into second place. But by lap 12, the Dutchman was already reporting that he lacked grip compared to the McLarens and was soon overtaken by Norris.\n\n> The first pit stop followed on lap 13, switching from soft to soft tires. ""We had already committed to a three-stop strategy,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. The next service was scheduled for lap 29, with Verstappen getting medium tires. The final scheduled stop didn\'t happen until lap 47. The four-time world champion returned to the track on soft tires.\n\n> ""We had to take some risks to have a chance. And that was the three-stop strategy,"" explained Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko. In terms of tire wear, they were inferior to McLaren in the 29-degree air temperature and 50-degree track temperature. It\'s the signature discipline of the Papaya racers.\n\n> In that respect, it was positive that they were on track until the safety car was deployed on lap 55 following the engine failure of Kimi Antonelli\'s Mercedes, and that they were projecting a podium finish. At one point, they even came very close to McLaren. ""We were closer than we thought until the safety car and did everything right,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner.\n\n> ""The problem was that our tires didn\'t last long enough, and McLaren\'s middle stint was very strong. Our only chance was the undercut with the soft tires at the end."" McLaren was alert and countered immediately. And then had racing luck on its side, as Horner explains. ""The safety car deployed at the worst possible time in terms of our strategy. Max was on eight-lap-old soft tires, which were worn out.""\n\n> The problem: He had no alternatives available. Although he had a new set of soft tires and three used sets of soft tires on his list, one of them had already been discarded due to use in qualifying and the drive to the starting grid. So, only a new set of the hard compound remained.\n\n> The decision: plague or cholera. Verstappen said: ""Maybe it would have been better to stay out. But hindsight is always 20/20."" According to Horner, they would have been eliminated. The hard option, however, was anything but ideal. ""He was really bad in the warm-up,"" analyzed Marko. ""If you take risks, things can sometimes go in the wrong direction.""\n\n> **Was Verstappen‚Äôs collision with Russell intentional?**\nAfter the restart on lap 61, things got heated for Verstappen and everyone he encountered on the track. First, the Red Bull driver slid off the track almost by himself in the RB21 on the hard tires. A few seconds later, he clashed with Charles Leclerc. The two touched.\n\n> The Ferrari driver explained the situation on the home straight as follows: ""It was a battle for position on the track, to get the slipstream of the McLaren. Max wanted to push me to the inside, and I didn\'t want to go there, so I tried to push him off. I tried to push him to the left. There was a little contact, but luckily without consequences. I knew he would have a tough time on the hard tires."" The incident was investigated, but no penalty was imposed.\n\n> Unlike the clash with George Russell in the Mercedes, which began with Verstappen having to leave the track to avoid the Briton, who had attempted to overtake in Turn 1. The team feared that the stewards would impose a penalty on him for gaining an advantage. So they asked Verstappen to relinquish the position.\n\n> But that really riled the 27-year-old. Instead of simply letting Russell through, he rammed into the Englishman\'s car at Turn 5. This resulted in a penalty: 10 seconds, meaning only one point for tenth place instead of a podium finish. Nico Rosberg even called for a disqualification on Sky UK.\n\n> Russell commented on the situation: ""I was just as surprised as you. I\'ve seen maneuvers like this in simulation games and go-karting, but never in Formula 1.""\n\n> Red Bull team boss Horner declined to comment immediately after the race because he hadn\'t yet spoken to his driver. Marko said: ""We didn\'t anticipate that the tires would be so bad during the warm-up phase. There was a certain amount of frustration, which was reflected in the driving style.""\n\n> What\'s annoying in retrospect from Red Bull\'s perspective: After the race, it turned out that Verstappen had been cleared by the stewards for the original offense of ""track leaving."" So, there was no need to order a swap at all. ""It would be nice if the referees would just say: Keep going or give the place back,"" Horner expressed his hope.\n\n> When asked about the intent, Verstappen replied: ""Does that matter?"" Strictly speaking, yes. Because that might have made a difference in the punishment. The Dutchman got off with a 10-second time penalty and three penalty points for his maneuver against Russell. If the stewards had ruled it intentional, it would have been four, and Verstappen would have received a one-race ban. As it is, he\'s still one point away from that. He now has to behave himself until June 30th.\n\n(1/2)', ""So how does it work with the penalty points? If he gets 1 point on race day in Austria (29th) he'd have 12, but by the time the next race comes around the first 2 points are removed again. Does he still get the ban? Technically he doesn't have 12 points on the license for that race. Or is it just whenever you hit 12 points you get a ban no matter if they dissolve by the next race."", ""Man can steer perfectly around corners in quali mode and gets hailed a god, but cannot brake in time to avoid a collision after giving a place back.\n\nIt was intentional and we all know it, should have been a Black flag (said the same about Vettel Baku - you cannot do this in grass roots so why formula 1 (because it's a drama with less rules)) \n\nBut should be 4 points and race ban since he meant it... Poor stewarding, when will Max learn if hes 27 and still gets treated like the boy that doesn't do wrong?"", ""I appreciate that a penalty should in theory be independent of the context, but I quite like that the penalty is such that \n\na. he was effectively DQd from the race\n\nb. if he does really very little wrong, he's out for a race.

1l1czlu,Built an F1 data dashboard as a side project ‚Äì would love some feedback!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l1czlu/built_an_f1_data_dashboard_as_a_side_project/,2025-06-02, Technical,"Hi all,

I‚Äôve been working on a side project over the past few months: an F1 data dashboard that pulls together various insights from the current season. I was looking for something that showed more than just the basic standings and helped visualise how the season is progressing. I thought others might find it useful too.

At the moment, the site includes:

- The most recent race weekend (pole sitter, pole time, race winner)

- The full race calendar with upcoming event dates

- Bar charts for driver and constructor championship standings

- Charts showing which drivers and constructors have taken the most pole positions

- The fastest pit stop of the season, including who set it and at which race

- A scatter plot showing average qualifying position vs race finish for each driver

- A line graph tracking finishing positions for the top 5 drivers across the season

The dashboard updates automatically after each race and qualifying session, so it stays current throughout the season. I‚Äôve tried to keep the design clean and simple, aiming to make the data accessible without being overwhelming: it‚Äôs not trying to replace big analytics tools.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback, particularly around what other insights might be interesting to include or ways I could improve the current layout.

I know all the talk is about what Max wrongly did afterwards probably trying to ‚Äúpay back‚Äù to George, but seriously, why was the prior incident not investigated and result in a penalty for George? I really don‚Äôt see how losing control of your car and hitting someone while overtaking can not be a penalty.","['because the outcome does matter and the FIA just makes the rules up every time an incident happens\n\ngasly also completely slammed into tsunoda in monaco and the official FIA document essentially says ""as gasly didn\'t fuck up the race for anyone else, we\'re not going to penalize him""', 'The outcome does matter.

If he\'d ended up ahead he\'d have probably got a penalty\n\nAlso, I think people misunderstand the ""penalties aren\'t based on the outcome"" thing. They are based on the outcome but only in a sporting sense, not physically.\n\nFor example, say there are two scenarios where George pushes Max off the track. In one of them Max has to retire from the race and in the other Max actually gets ahead of George as a result. The fist case will be considered as a worse incident as George gained a lasting advantage for it.\n\nFor an example of where the outcome doesn\'t matter. Say there are two scenarios again, but Max retires in both of them. In the first he\'s pushed into the gravel and gets stuck but is otherwise entirely unscathed. In the other, a similar thing happens but his car gets significantly damaged.

Had Red Bull not tried to get Max to give the place back, the FIA may have looked into it a little more. IMO, it probably would have still been no further action because that was their decision for the minor collisions between Max and Charles and also Liam and Ollie.', '""The outcome doesn\'t matter"" isn\'t really true.\n\nThe stewards assess both the severity of the contact and whether any material sporting advantage or disadvantage was caused.\n\nIn this case, the contact was minor because of a snap and neither car had a significant sporting disadvantage because of it (Red Bull telling Max to give the place up is on them).']",0,61,0.36,0,56,56,0,61,0.36,0
