The deal will bring one of the world’s biggest motor-racing brands and MotoGP — often described as the two-wheeled equivalent of Formula 1 — under a single roof.\n\n>In-depth EU probes typically add about 90 working days to deal reviews — but can drag on, for example if regulators stop the clock to demand further data. The EU’s antitrust arm usually demands remedies to solve competition concerns but sometimes also decide to give their unconditional approval if initial concerns are shown to be unfounded.\n\n>Heightened scrutiny can also lead to firms walking away from planned acquisitions. Under the terms of the deal, Liberty would have to pay Dorna €126 million if it ends up withdrawing from the takeover.\n\n>Regulators have previously raised concerns over drawing both sporting brands together. CVC Capital Partners Ltd. was forced to put MotoGP up for sale nearly two decades ago to gain antitrust approval from European regulators for its takeover of Formula 1 in 2005.\n\n>MotoGP is just the latest asset to be taken over by billionaire John Malone’s sprawling Liberty Media empire that already includes a wide range of media, communications and entertainment businesses such as concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment Inc.\n\n>Since buying F1 in 2016, Liberty Media has targeted key markets including the US, attempted to grow the sport’s popularity through digital streaming and struck gold with the show Drive to Survive."", 'I predicted this would happen lol, not the first time F1 tried to buy MotoGP.', ""Can't read.

1hcs00b,Has Ben Sulayem overestimated his power?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hcs00b/has_ben_sulayem_overestimated_his_power/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"Ben Sulayem made some interesting comments today about the FIA not having the funds to employ permanent stewards, so I thought I’d share a few thoughts on where his presidency seems to be heading.

Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run. Sulayem’s approach as president has been… combative, to say the least. A lot of his decisions seem more about ego than actually serving the role. He’s alienated key stakeholders and made governance changes that look like attempts to shield himself from accountability, which hasn’t done much for his reputation—or the FIA’s, for that matter.

Honestly, his position feels shaky. The next FIA elections are still a year away, and maybe he won’t face serious opposition, but the level of discontent right now suggests bigger problems within the organization. What we’re seeing play out publicly is probably just the surface.

At the end of the day, his authority isn’t limitless. The drivers and teams are the ones who really hold the power in F1, and history shows they aren’t afraid to push back when they’re unhappy—even to the point of threatening to leave the sport entirely. Sulayem seems to be gambling a lot by antagonizing them, and I’m not sure he fully understands just how strong their influence is.

This whole power struggle seems like it will rumble on over the off season. The longer it drags on, the more damage it could do—not just to his presidency, but to F1 itself.

I’m interested to hear others thoughts on the topic. How do you see this playing out, and could the FIA find itself in real trouble if things don’t change?","[""> Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run.\n\nThat's just sorta politics though, it always looks like something has to give, but the reality is Formula 1 is only a part of the FIA, and only relevant to a few of its wealthiest member nations/constituent clubs of which there are some 250 from 147 countries. Things look to be at a breaking point, then a few things elsewhere get shuffled around in the background and suddenly everyone's happy.\n\nIs F1 important? Is it the single most important FIA activity? Yeah, probably, but as F1 fans we're still only seeing a fraction of the FIA's overall purview. If the Ugandan Karting scene doesn't have the same beef with Sulayem that Formula One does, he's not going to have much problem being reelected."", ""A very important point is that the FIA president first and foremost serves the FIA members and not F1. F1 doesn't have much of a say, the member clubs elect the president and their leadership team. And so far it does in fact not look like Ben Sulayem is in danger of losing reelection next year. I would recommend reading this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5xbgv/jeppe_olesen_on_the_back_of_all_the_mbs/)regarding the FIA presidential elections."", ""The teams and commercial side breaking away is a popular Reddit power fantasy. The unfortunate reality of it is that the FIA owns F1 both as a series and a brand, and Indycar's shown us that *everyone* is worse off for a split - but especially the commercial side.\n\nThis is why the teams and FOM do not hold the power some people think they do. They can threaten to break away, haggle and negotiate, sure, but a breakaway involves far too much money lost for them to ever really make good on it. The FIA technically isn't a for-profit organisation. That's why the FIA president can get away with just about everything short of murder, and MBS simply hasn't done anything stupid enough to make his position truly untenable."", 'I think a lot of folks here want to believe the FIA and MBS is the problem. The issue is likely far more complicated. A lot of the issues are more the problem with the FOM than the FIA. Paying for full time FIA stewards is something that the FIA should address with the FOM. The FIA is a non-profit, it cannot simply ""get revenue and add costs"" from nowhere. The FOM should pay for the full time stewards for F1 and that is a project that the FIA rightly addresses. \n\nThe ENTIRETY of the FIA (including all motorsports not only F1) has about 300 full time employees. Their annual budget runs into the 150-200m Euro range. The annual income after taxes is less than 10m Euro (2023). For comparison this is smaller than a single F1 team\'s annual budget.\n\nIf the FIA has to hire 3-4 full time stewards, fly time to every F1 venue, this would very likely cost them several million Euro a year. It isn\'t hard to see why the FIA needs the FOM to pony up this kind of expense.', 'As much as MBS is unpopular to fans. Neither was Blatter or Infantino right now for FIFA. David Stern of NBA also was not popular. It took quite a bit of scandal to finally see the end of Mosley. \n\nReality is, fans are not the stakeholders the presidents/commissioner etc answer to, their unpopularity is irrelevant to the job they perform. Though I feel MBS is a bit different in that a lot of his unpopular moves seems to be about him specifically rather than necessarily large scale FIA decisions.', 'I’m not sure why he’s being blamed for this when they have *never* had permanent stewards and he is at least starting the conversation around fixing that, albeit with the caveat that the funds have to come from somewhere. Surely this is a reasonable starting point, rather than letting the problem endlessly fester like previous presidents did?\n\nAs for all the resignations and other changes, I still remain open minded as it’s not been very transparent, but the FIA never has been since long before he came in. And any media coverage of him always has a bit of a stink of racism that makes me take it with a pinch of salt. Part of me wonders if he’s just breaking up the old boys club that has been running things without consequence for so long.', ""Hasn't the FIA always been shady? I vaguely remember the whole group B debacle where the FIA was pretty much ignoring spectator and driver deaths since the sport was so popular. And then there was a whole slew of F1 controversies that people were mad about but almost every casual F1 fan has never even heard about those or has forgotten about it. I recon as long as the sport keeps growing he will be kept in the position he is in."", 'He was all about making the funding more transparent and it was one of the main reasons many voted him in.\n\nSince that time he has not done that basically and since gaining the seat he has continued to make measures to cement that seat for him.\n\nHe has tried to medal with what goes on in race weekends in F1, he has questionable ties to certain venues of which questionable things have happened just before and at said events, He has recently looked to make himself ruler and judgements that would put what he does into question, drivers and others have continued to question where funds go like their finds with no answers...\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nHe clearly is not fit for the job and the FIA has not improved under his leadership.', '![gif](giphy|lqczWksNBr4HK)\n\nBen Sulayem right now.']",163,64,0.84,163,521,521,1,1,0.0,1

For example, at the end of 2020, Max had 10 wins. I also made a chart showing how many race winning seasons each driver had before their first championship winning season, as well as the total number of seasons at that point. I also made these charts for every non-WDC race winner on the 2025 grid, to see how the compare historically. Hope you enjoy and checkout my comment for some fun tidbits.","['I’m so bummed that Bottas isn’t a current driver on these charts anymore', ""I made these charts after seeing a comment that pointed out that Max only had 10 race wins before 2021. This made me wonder: how many wins did the other champions have before their first championship winning season? The results shocked me a bit: despite Max being considered quite young and inexperienced before 2021, historically speaking he was one of the most experienced winners before starting his championship winning season. In my mind this shows how good he was in inferior machinery during the Merc domination.\n\nLastly, an important note: even if a driver only did 1 race in a season, that is still counted as a season. I can’t be arsed to judge where the limit for a partaking in a season goes, especially with all of the drivers who did like 2 races a season back in the 50’s and 60’s.\n\nNow for the fun facts:\n\nMax Verstappen is the only driver to have more than 7 victories before starting his first championship winning season who hadn't finished runners up or been in a proper championship fight.\xa0\n\nMansell's 21 wins would put him 16th on the all-time win list, tied with Kimi Räikkönen's all time wins. Meanwhile, Prost had the same amount of wins as Stirling Moss, the driver with the most race wins without a championship.\xa0\n\n14 out of 34 drivers had one or no race wins when they started their championship winning season. 20 out 34 WDC had only had either 1 or no race winning seasons before their first championship winning season.

For Mika, it was the 97 season finale, the very race before his first WDC season, and he only won it because of the Schumacher-Villeneuve crash.\xa0\n\nKeke Rosberg is another driver who really stands out. Unlike most drivers without a victory before their first season, who generally won their debut quite early on in the season, Keke’s first victory came in round 14/16 in 1982. Even crazier, had he finished second, he still would have won the championship, and became the only driver to win the championship while never winning a Grand Prix.\xa0\n\nDespite all the talk about Norris being inexperienced in a winning position, should he win the championship next season he would be pretty average on this list. Russell would also be pretty average, while Leclerc would be on the high end. Perez would also be quite high, but if he is even on the grid next year, I’ll eat my cat’s food.

He above many other drivers I have seen gives me that vibe of being a fan of the sport living his dream. \n\nSo some of the comments we’ve seen from Lewis recently - especially the one about not wanting to come back after Brazil - have the alarm bells ringing for me. Lewis has been in worse situations in his career and has pushed like hell to overcome the odds, particularly in the first half of 2009 when the car was a complete dog or in 2012 when he had all the bad luck in the world. If he lost motivation then, he sure as hell never let it affect his driving.\n\nThe dip we’ve seen from him since COTA - where I think it would be fair to say he completely embarrassed himself - has been alarming. Since then, we’ve had his ranting on the Brazil team radio, his mess-up in Vegas Q3, his pit lane error in Qatar and his Q1 exit in Abu Dhabi. All very unlike Lewis, and the clear issue seems to be a mental one. I’m getting Mika 2001 kind of vibes - he had some great races too, but you could tell he wasn’t quite the same driver.\n\nIt’s understandable in a sense that Lewis may lack motivation for a team/project he’s leaving, but given his general passion for the sport and given you’d anticipate he’d have had a desire to sign off in the right way with Toto and the boys, I can’t help thinking that there’s something deeper going on here. I can’t help thinking Lewis was trying to force himself to believe he was done with Mercedes when he was in actual fact done with racing. \n\nI also fear Ferrari is a match made in hell for Lewis. Their race day operations are a big downgrade on Mercedes, Leclerc is arguably an even stronger team-mate than George and Ferrari in general is not the kind of environment where a driver is given freedom to express their individuality and opinions in the way Lewis loves to. I can see the allure of the prancing horse inspiring Lewis early on, but the moment a setback occurs or he has his first run-in with the pit wall I fear things could go very south very fast.\n\nI hope very much I am wrong.

1hctthl,Max 2025 Race Ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hctthl/max_2025_race_ban/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"So Verstappen is 4 points off a race ban—he currently has 8 of the 12. His first points don’t expire until June, meaning he’ll have to navigate at least 11 races without picking up 4 more points—just two incidents and he’s out. 

Considering next season could be one of the most competitive in years is this something he and Red Bull are seriously concerned about?

How likely do you think it is that Max gets a race ban? ","['If Lawson gets checos seat and then Max gets a race ban: surely they will let Yuki have 1 race in the RB right? Surely.', 'FIA is extremely disinclined to issue race bans when it comes to this. Magnussen is more of an exception to the rule than a prime example, and it was probably either because he was retiring anyway, or because he was too open about the fact that he had nothing to lose and so didn’t care about breaking the rules. In other cases, once a driver gets close to 12 points, the stewards become deaf and blind. They give any punishment whatsoever other than penalty points.', 'Unlikely. Maybe he gets on the edge but FIA tends to give a warning before a driver breaches the limit( exactly what happened with Magnussen this year)', ""Besides the two 1 point incidents I think he could've entirely avoided all of the other 3 incidents in the moment. This is important to point out because he likely doesn't do whatever he did if he knows that a race ban is nearby. Also, while the Austria thing was possibly not something he avoids (light contact with big consequences and with drivers staying on track) there is also the possibility (high imo) that something like that does not result in penalty points if the driver in question is near a race ban. In fact, the Russell-quali incident also won't result in penalty points if he is closer to 12 points. I don't remember the other 1 point incident tbh..."", 'Not likely at all.', 'When is the baby due?', 'honestly depends on how the stewards are feeling on a given day at this point. I do think that if before june he gets very close to it, he should just ‘plan’ the race ban and get rid of it early in the year so that he can continue the rest of the year with zero points and time to make up the -25 points because assuming he is in the wdc fight,  if he stays on the limit with 9-10 points near the end of the year, he will  always be at risk of having the wdc decided based on that ban', 'They are really out there to get Max, the amount of stuff others got away with but Max gets penalized all the time', ""They will continue to give him penalties for things that some of their favorite drivers won't even get investigated for, that's for sure. Doing dumb shit every now and then makes for a bad reputation and being neutral isn't very high on the stewards' priority list.""]",0,62,0.33,0,259,259,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0
