1og1r5h,The Most Dominant F1 Driver's Titles,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1og1r5h/the_most_dominant_f1_drivers_titles/,2025-10-25, Statistics,"Using Win-Percantage, Percantage of Highest Possible Points, Percantage of Laps Lead, The Average Finish Positon, the championship lead in percent, and Podium-Percantage, we can see that it's not Max Verstappen is 2023 who had the most dominant F1 season ever, but Jim Clark in 1963. And that even though Verstappen beat Clark in 5 of the 6 metrics. Clark leads Verstappen only in the relative championship lead, since he beat championship ""rival"" Graham Hill with 73 to 29 points, and so had Clark 152% the points of Hill in comparison to Verstappen's 101.8% lead to Teammate Sergio Perez.

Numbers for Win %, % of HPP, Avg. Finish, % Points Lead and % Podium come from the respective Wikipedia articles for the F1 championships from 1950 to 2024.  
Numbers for Laps Lead % come from [statsf1.com](http://statsf1.com) .

HPP stands for Highest Possible Points, so how many points you'd have if you won every race of the season.

The Numbers for the Average Finishing Position were calculated as following:

* Getting the Average of all Grand Prix Finishing Positions,
* Multiplying that Average by 10,
* Subtracting that number from 100.

In the case of an average finishing position higher than P10, the value will be 0.

Wins are counted as part of the podium.","['I feel like adding percentages to everything and then also to points in front is misleading.

So naturally the difference is a lot larger in percentage.', ""I'm astonished Jim Clark's 1965 season, where he won every race he finished and took three Grand Slams, is in the bottom half of most dominant season. The first F1 race that season which Clark entered but failed to win was round 8 of 10. In fact round 8 (the Italian Grand Prix) was the first time all season somebody had managed to complete even one lap ahead of Clark. If that season can be ranked as less dominant than a whole bunch of much tighter seasons then the methodology must be deeply flawed."", 'Why are we just picking random stats and adding percentages (a lethal sin) without any weighing and pretending it means something?', 'Clark is the GOAT for me.

1oghq3l,No one but Max: Verstappen could end end up as the only driver with multiple wins at circuits across this regulation cycle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oghq3l/no_one_but_max_verstappen_could_end_end_up_as_the/,2025-10-26, Statistics,"Since 2022, seven drivers other than Max have shared 39 wins between them — but none have managed to win *twice* at the same track in the ground effect era. Meanwhile, Max has already done that at 17 different circuits… and could still add Vegas to the list.

To prevent this, Sainz would need to win at Mexico, George at Interlagos / Vegas, or Lando at Abu Dhabi. Otherwise, Max will become the **only driver ever** to have multiple wins at a circuit across a single regulation era when no one else has.

1ogg7ws,P5 start by Sergio Perez 2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ogg7ws/p5_start_by_sergio_perez_2023/,2025-10-26, Technical,"I've watched P5 starts from previous years - unfortunatelly it's not ideal grid position: usually it's great at first 1-2 seconds because you are in the slipstream of 2 cars ahead, but then they cut to the right side of the track and your slipstream is suddenly gone. And you can't really cut to the right as well because of P4 and P3. What's more if someone cuts back to left side of the track again then you're blocked. Also being on the outside in T1 you have to be extra careful as everyone is understeering there.

What suprised me was that Perez in 2023 actually had amazing start from P5. Verstappen and Charles both started in straight line giving him a bit of a slipstream, then he almost immediately managed to overtake Hamilton in P4, cut to right which gave him absolutely massive slipstream and drove next to Sainz (I don't know why Sainz didn't block him there). He used empty left side of T1 and at some point was ahead of the Verstappen and Leclerc.

I think what helped him was average start by Hamilton, that no one ahead of him switched suddenly from left to right (all moves were slow) so he could keep within slipstream and Sainz who didn't prevent him from entering Charles and Max's slipstream.

I was't impressed with Sergio's start in that race as he took out himself and almost Charles and I was too focused on the leaders, but the more I watch it the more I like it.
I don't think anymore that going into T1 3 wide was stupid from Checo, it was brave and he had really good opportunity at taking the lead in his home gp, but maybe he could be a little but more careful knowing well that Charles and Max have drag race to T1. Maybe knowing Max and Charles he should let them fight and position himself better at exit at T3 trying to overtake to T4.

Anyway as a Max fan I am not optimistic, Russel surelly won't have bad start but because all top 5 are so experienced I am very curious who will be ahead of T1. Something tells me this can be Russel as P4 is decent, he doesn't count in WDC fight, doesn't have team mate next to him and already extended with Mercedes so has nothing to loose and can be more agressive.","[""only positive thing can happen is max doesnt lose position and both ferrari' s overtake norris and norris is stuck in dirty air.

Any other driver would've tried the same."", 'If its going to be a normal Norris, then he will be extra cautious, leave space to others, only to end up bunched up/pushed off ...']",8,7,0.79,8,7,7,8,7,0.79,8
