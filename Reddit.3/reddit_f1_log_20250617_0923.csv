* 2026 F1 calendar discussions are ongoing, with Turkey apparently having hope if Madrid's situation doesn't work out
* There are also efforts to bring other racing series like DTM to Turkey as part of broader motorsport development

According to the posts from Kemal ≈ûeng√ºl, recent legal issues around F1 management have been reported to F1's administration by unknown people, which may have negatively impacted Turkey's 2026 prospects.

George Russell controlled the Canadian GP from the front, and Andrea Kimi Antonelli finished third. Was the Silver Arrows\' good form a flash in the pan or a turning point?**\n\n> This was no fluke victory. George Russell put the Mercedes on pole position with a lead of 0.160 seconds over Max Verstappen. He had the best start and controlled the race from the front. Whenever Verstappen approached the DRS zone, the 27-year-old Englishman increased the pace and effortlessly pulled away from the world champion. Team principal Toto Wolff called it an ""honest victory.""\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli rounded out Mercedes\' success in third place. It was the first podium finish for an Italian since Jarno Trulli at the 2009 Japanese GP. Antonelli also became the third-youngest driver to climb onto the podium at a Grand Prix. His drive to third place wasn\'t quite as relaxed as Russell\'s fourth GP victory: ""For the last few laps, I was praying it would be over soon. Piastri was putting a lot of pressure on me from behind.""\n\n> Mercedes reclaimed second place in the Constructors\' World Championship from Ferrari with 40 points. The W16 hadn\'t undergone any significant changes. The front brake vents were given larger openings. The underbody was modified at the edge to provide a few points more downforce. And the new rear axle, which had been retired immediately after its debut in Imola, returned. It wasn\'t the reason why the rear tires overheated in recent races. In retrospect, it actually helped to better control the problem.\n\n> **Track, asphalt and weather helped Mercedes.**\nWere the pole position, the win, and third place a flash in the pan or a turning point? The answer is: neither. Mercedes is unlikely to be as competitive at all tracks from now on as it was in Montreal. Russell admitted: ""This type of track, the smooth asphalt, and cooler temperatures help us. That\'s the picture we\'ve seen for years. We need to figure out why we can\'t replicate it everywhere.""\n\n> Toto Wolff also blamed the track and the circumstances. ""George controlled the race. Kimi withstood the pressure from the McLarens. That was possible because we gave them the car for it. Fast corners and rough asphalt like in Barcelona aren\'t so good for our car, because the tires are put under too much strain. And then we have the problem with overheating.""\n\n> Conditions were ideal for Mercedes during qualifying on Saturday. Russell was concerned before the start because the track temperature had risen by six degrees compared to Saturday. ""I was surprised that the temperature increase didn\'t affect us. The tires are simply not challenged as much in the slow corners. It was the same last year. Back then, we threw away a victory. This time we were able to seize our opportunity.\n\n> **Mercedes reacted to Verstappen.**\nFrom the engineers\' perspective, the explanation for Mercedes\' Montreal mystery sounds like this: ""With one exception, this track has only one type of corner. This makes it easy to set up the car. In the corners with little lateral acceleration, the tire doesn\'t flex enough to overheat. The smooth asphalt is good for the tire surface. Therefore, thermal wear was minimal. The biggest problem for everyone was graining on the left front. There was a simple solution for that: You couldn\'t push too hard in Turns 3, 5, and 7.""\n\n> Mercedes had the speed, tire management, and track position to react to everything their opponents threw at them. Mercedes soon identified Verstappen as their main challenger. Therefore, they reacted to Red Bull\'s pit stops. When it briefly looked like Oscar Piastri might have a one-stop race, the Mercedes command center remained calm. ""We had the confidence to catch him again with fresher tires.""\n\n> The McLarens only managed to keep their tires in better condition than Mercedes in the final stint due to the shorter running times. The Red Bulls failed earlier in each of the first two stints. ""The tires only held up at the end, with less fuel in the tank,"" said the Formula 1 World Champion. He had to look more in the rearview mirror than behind. But Antonelli overdid it a bit in his pursuit of Verstappen, ruining his left front tire in the process. ""I was lucky that the two McLarens behind me were busy with their own battle.""', 'Yeah, pretty much confirms Austria is going to be 3/4 in car pecking order. Time to wait until Silverstone', ""Trend reversal, it's the best car after those frankly quite insane floor upgrades.\n\nThe track was scorching hot (which is typically bad for Merc), and they had better tire deg than even McLaren this weekend.\n\nI actually think Russell should be close, if not the outright favourite to win the title as of right now.\n\nThe Merc floor upgrade this weekend is the most impactful upgrade for any team since McLaren's 2024 Miami package."", 'I expect more consistent inconsistency from them tbh.

Hamilton's race was already compromised after hitting the groundhog, affecting the downforce immensely on the onset. Leclerc's strategical calls may seem odd in the heat of the moment but degradation on the medium stints was higher than I personally expected, and the hards were on after the first stop to go all the way in the chase. In the opinion of a person who doesn't know any better, maybe they could have switched the order of the stints around *(a la what McLaren did with Norris)* but not only am I assuming the chances of a safety car was also in mind when making that call, but I also believe it would not lead to a huge chasm in places if done so\n\nFor Ferrari, with the added work of balancing that rear suspension and the added fear of increasing the ride height, the mitigation taken here was not at its worst, upon hindsight, although it could be better\n\nWhich is why I do want to address the rumours swirling around the paddock this week regarding them. If they even think of bringing the likes of Antonello Coletta into the team, he wouldn't be able to save this team from their own shadow as well. Surely after repeated rotational driver changes in *champions*, with Vasseur's own achievements prior to joining the Scuderia, would the higher echelons at Ferrari have an inkling that it is not them, but it doesn't seem to be that way. Vasseur and Hamilton collectively speaking their two cents does point to an indication that the general public will be hearing something a lot bigger in the upcoming few months\n\nI'll never get this team in this fundamental regard for as long as they keep this up. They have the theoretical frameworks to design the car to compete at the front. I get that there is a relative concern that the philosophy will not hold up for this year considering other teams will make better strides, but it honestly feels like a 5-step backwards movement, to the point where I don't doubt that people would rather have that SF-24 back.

And that's it. Which stat surprises/interests you the most? Let me know down in the comments. Again, you are also free to correct any mistakes, if I have made any.","['It surprises me that Kimi didnt finished once above Russell and only outqualified him also once. I wasnt aware of this', 'the fact that Bortoleto can (reasonably) keep up with H√ºlkenberg is pretty surprising.\n\nAlso Bearmans showing is strong. In fact all out of rookies that came out of f2 are looking really good (even thought Antonellis h2h looks a bit cursed, but he also has the by far best teammate out of him hadjar bortoleto and bearman).\n\nEdit: i fully forgot to mention that noone (myself included) would have guessed that Albon would be dominating the h2h against sainz.', ""So, which stat surprised me the most?\n\nDefinitely the McLaren H2Hs, especially qualifying. I mean, Oscar Piastri was beaten 20-4 or 21-3 (can't remember exactly) by Lando in quali last year and something like 19-5 in races.\n\nYet, in just the first third or so of this season, Oscar has out-qualified Lando more times than he outqualified him across the whole of last year.\n\nNo-one I know who was watching F1 at the end of last year would have predicted this - especially since Piastri's messy clusterfuck disasterclass of a recovery drive at Abu Dhabi was his send-off to the 2024 season.\n\nOscar Piastri has improved his qualifying tremendously this season.\n\nI'm also a little surprised by how little Antonelli has out-qualified or out-raced Russell. People were speaking very highly of him, and perhaps they were overhyping him, but due to how highly they spoke of him I expected the stats to be slightly less lopsided.\n\nOf course Stroll being out-qualified by Alonso in all but 1 sprint is no surprise.    ;)\n\nWhat about you? What caught your attention?"", ""Most surprising to me is Leclerc's race pace over Hamilton. I expected Charles to beat Lewis in qually but be closer over a race distance - that's not really happened."", ""Got AI to fix the formatting.\n\n## Race and Sprint H2H\n\n| Team          | Driver 1        | Driver 2        | Race H2H            | Sprint H2H           | Notes                                                                 |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| McLaren       | Norris          | Piastri         | 4 - 6               | 1 - 1                 |                                                                      |\n| Red Bull      | Verstappen      | Lawson          | 2 - 0               | 1 - 0                 |                                                                      |\n| Red Bull      | Verstappen      | Tsunoda         | 8 - 0               | 0 - 1                 |                                                                      |\n| Mercedes      | Russell         | Antonelli       | 10 - 0              | 2 - 0                 |                                                                      |\n| Ferrari       | Leclerc         | Hamilton        | 8 - 1               | 0 - 2                 | Both cars DQ'd from China;

1lcwcb2,Fernando Alonso's future?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lcwcb2/fernando_alonsos_future/,2025-06-16, Discussion,"
Alonso's future will be AM until at least 2026. He already said that he signed a multi-year contract in 2024 and according to Pedro de la Rosa, AM ambassador who usually comments on various things on Dazn, he will be probably also in 2027. 

I know that the English press makes up things and assumes many things quickly with Alonso, especially because many leaks, information and facts do not reach them and only appear in the Spanish press. Above all because, as I said, important people like Pedro de la Rosa keep information to themselves and give clues in the Spanish press. It has happened before, but lately it has been very noticeable. 

Now, speaking of Alonso's not-so-distant future... There are rumors that Russell will replace Alonso next year or in 2 years. That Alonso will go to Alpine because he was seen in the Alpine offices and other things. Pedro de la Rosa denied this, he was only there because Briatore and his parents were there, it was just a walk, that hoax has been denied. Cowell and AM backed Alonso and it is confirmed once again that Alonso is not going to Alpine and will remain at AM for a few more years.  Besides, it's obvious that he won't be returning to alpine, he had enough a few years ago. 

Now, there are rumors that Honda would like a Japanese driver to be in AM, BUT, it is not known if they would want to take Stroll or Alonso, here there is nothing confirmed 

I've gotten all this information from Pedro de la Rosa's IG, various informants, live broadcasts on DAZN, reliable sources, and reliable newspapers. In any case, you can visit Pedro de la Rosa's IG or search for information that's been coming out lately. I can't post Dazn videos because it's a paid service and I prefer not to break any rules of that style.

What do people think about all this? Please share if you have any information. I'm curious.","[""He's got another 40 years in him at least"", ""AM is his retirement Valhalla. I mean he is already a legend, bagging another WDC at his age now would just elevate that further. He will see out his contract, for a couple of years of Newey AM Honda for chance maybe at WDC and if that doesn't pan out he will retire probably. Get married, make babehs, and enjoy his millions and revisit the grid with his progeny decade+ later. \n\nNo way he is going back to Alpine. It's maybe shot at WDC, retirement, and long term roles and ambassadorship at AM. And maybe shot at the triple crown once a year at Indy for 5 years before babeh time, with all his free time, if he's up to the risks."", 'Good question! Crofty kept talking about Alonso going to the Alpine garage four times in Thursday and Friday in Canada. It sounds more likely he was just seeing friends or family or something but then again it is Alonso we are talking about, and it is Alpine we are talking about. I wouldn‚Äôt rule anything out.\xa0\n\nI think the situation with Aston is that Alonso has a contract for 2026. Fernando mightn‚Äôt be able to break out of that contract but the team can break him out. After that it appears that Aston want him to become a team ambassador or something. I don‚Äôt think Alonso will drive for Aston in 2027 unless he‚Äôs in the 2026 title fight which seems unlikely with the Merc engine runours, speaking of which, Alpine have the fancied Merc engine in 2026 which makes them an attractive option.\n\nWe also know that Fl√°vio is Alonso‚Äôs manager and they have a long history. While one last get together sounds unthinkable, is it impossible? Stranger things have happened in F1.\xa0\n\nI think the situation all depends on Max Verstappen. If we get the unlikely scenario where he goes to Mercedes or Aston Martin, then I think Alonso has been told or heard that in this scenario he loses his seat. If Max goes to Merc then George goes to Aston to replace Fernando. if Max goes to Aston he replaces Fernando. Basically Lance will defo drive next season amd Alonso knows hes out if Max leaves Red Bull which is very unlikely.\xa0\n\nHowever I‚Äôll reiterate that nothing is impossible in the F1 transfer market and if Max does leave RB Alonso doenst want to be left off the grid, therefore he is making sure he has a plan B, that plan B is Alpine.\xa0\n\nIf Alonso actually has the power to break his contract, maybe for a performance clause, then it will be very interesting to see if Alpine becomes his plan A. I think Fl√°vio would 100% take him over Franco, so if both parties want each other (and Alonso might be tempted by getting 26 and 27 rather than just 26 at Aston) and Alonso can break free, Alpine have a very strong Alonso, Gasly partnership in 2026 and Aston are left with Stroll and would likely go in for Yuki or maybe an F2 driver.\xa0\n\n\xa0All of that said I think that the most likely scenario is we keep the status quo for 2026, but if Alonso can get out of his contract he might try. One final roll of the dice by the man who‚Äôs rolled more dice than any other.', 'Didn‚Äôt Alonso‚Äôs recent contract with AM include him signing up to stay there beyond his stint as a driver? I can‚Äôt remember if it detailed in what capacity but I definitely remember the ‚Äòbeyond driving‚Äô part being discussed when he re-signed. This is pure speculation on my part obviously but I think he‚Äôll see what Newey & co come up with for the new regs next year and then make a decision about his driving future based on that. I cannot see the Alpine rumour being true, the team is still the same shitshow he left, despite his ties to Fl√°vio. I also still think it‚Äôs more likely Max will eventually go to AM than Russell tbh.', 'Guy is going to be 45 soon and at some point he will want to retire, he already has his management side gig and I wouldnt be surprised if he gets a few more drivers under him in the coming years. He isnt going anywhere and to be honest I doubt anyone would want an expensive old driver who is cranky. \n\nHulk and Hamilton will also be gone soon, Sainz is the next oldest but is still good enough to be in F1.

Would it even be possible for VCARB to be competitive, or would redbull genuinely just want to have them as a junior program? Could their development be limited/stunted to keep them as a B team? And if so, how is that okay?
