It’s so hard to lose your shadow', 'As a single male close to Ham\'s age who just lost both of my dogs over the summer I really empathize with his pain. You have family, you have friends, they all come and go in your life. Sometimes there are days, weeks, where I am just grinding at work and don\'t see anyone else. The dogs were always there. They were always happy to see me. Even if they had destroyed something in the house I was quick to forgive them.\n\nTo add to the pain of losing some part of your self, your life, your routine, there is the context of euthanasia. I had to make the very painful decision to euthanize my younger dog because his cancer was progressing rapidly. Otherwise, he was a healthy dog with a lot of love for life. It absolutely took me out when the drugs reached his heart and the vet just said ""He\'s gone.""\n\nRest in peace Molly, Behr, and Roscoe', 'A lot of people on here have clearly never had a pet or loved an animal deeply. \n\nShame… it’s a wonderful feeling, which makes their deaths extraordinarily sad.', 'I know that pain he’s feeling. It’s fucking horrible. Hope he remembers that in spirit, he’s always walking beside him. I like to imagine my dogs wandering around me, doing their thing as they did in corporal form.', 'I’m still struggling with my boy’s passing in March. I really feel for Lewis.', 'What a great memory. \n\nHe’s likely less than three years from retiring. Once he does, his schedule should be a lot more pet friendly. Of course he’s still gonna travel a lot but he will be more in control.', 'My dog is 14.5yrs, I dread the day I have to say goodbye. What a life Roscoe must’ve had though, Lewis surely did the guy proud!', 'Dogs are family. Shit hurts.', 'JUST A DOG\n\nFrom time to time, people tell me, “lighten up, it’s just a dog,” or “that’s a lot of money for just a dog.”\n\nThey don’t understand the distance travelled, the time spent, or the costs involved for “just a dog.”\n\nSome of my proudest moments have come about with “just a dog.”\n\nMany hours have passed and my only company was “just a dog,” but I did not once feel slighted.\n\nSome of my saddest moments have been brought about by “just a dog,” and in those days of darkness, the gentle touch\nof “just a dog” gave me comfort and reason to overcome the day.\n\nIf you, too, think it’s “just a dog,” then you probably understand phrases like “just a friend,” “just a sunrise,” or “just a promise.”\n\n“Just a dog” brings into my life the very essence of friendship, trust, and pure unbridled joy.\n\n“Just a dog” brings out the compassion and patience that make me a better person.\n\nBecause of “just a dog” I will rise early, take long walks and look longingly to the future.\n\nSo for me and folks like me, it’s not “just a dog” but an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the future, the fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment.\n\n“Just a dog” brings out what’s good in me and diverts my thoughts away from myself and the worries of the day.\n\nI hope that someday they can understand that its’ not “just a dog” but the thing that gives me humanity and keeps me from being “just a man” or “just a woman.”\n\nSo the next time you hear the phrase “just a dog,” just smile, because they “just don’t understand.”\n\n~Unknown Author~']",3817,122,0.93,3817,106,106,1694,42,0.0,1694
