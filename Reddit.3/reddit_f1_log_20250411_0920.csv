George Russell calls it the first real assessment of the Silver Arrows\' position.**\n\n> The year 2024 was a year of ups and downs for Mercedes. On the one hand, the Silver Arrows were able to win four Formula 1 races thanks to George Russell and former driver Lewis Hamilton, but on the other hand, the Mercedes W15 was often not even able to fight for podium finishes.\n\n> The engineers had identified the Formula 1 car\'s weak points throughout the season. This year, one thing in particular was at the top of their list: giving the successor, the W16, a wider operating window than the 2024 model. Last year, the car performed best when it was cool. When it was hot, Russell and Hamilton struggled.\n\n> After their first impressions of the new race car, both drivers and engineers gave the thumbs up. The car should perform better in a variety of conditions. It\'s easier to find a suitable setup. The tests in Bahrain at the end of February were already encouraging for the team. George Russell set the fastest lap on the final day of testing. However, they didn\'t want to overestimate the Englishman\'s performance.\n\n> The conditions in the desert were still cool a month and a half ago. Moreover, Russell set the time just before the end of the eight-hour session. Nevertheless, it was a first statement from the former Formula 1 dominators that they would translate their results into results starting with the Australian GP. With two podium finishes from George Russell in the first three races and three top-10 finishes from rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes ranks second among the constructors\' championships with 75 World Championship points.\n\n> **Return to Bahrain.**\nAfter a strong start to the season, Mercedes now faces the ultimate test with the W16. The Bahrain Grand Prix (April 13) will reveal where the Silver Arrows truly stand in 2025 and how the car performs in conditions that led to weaker performances on the racetrack in 2024. It\'s extremely hot in the desert during the day. Under the floodlights in the evening, it cools down only slightly. There are also many slow corners that require good traction on exit. The rear tires suffer in Bahrain.\n\n> George Russell knows a key weekend is ahead: ""This will be our first real test. After this weekend, we know where our weaknesses still lie. We performed well in the first few races."" The rough asphalt in Bahrain is likely to put more strain on the tires than was the case recently in Suzuka and Shanghai. A strength that the paddock attributes to McLaren. ""I expect McLaren to be strong here in terms of tire wear in the high temperatures,"" explained the 27-year-old Russell.\n\n> The low tire wear was a big topic in the paddock after the races in Shanghai and Suzuka. The Formula 1 teams were able to rely on a one-stop strategy with almost no problems. While many focused on the freshly paved tracks, Russell also took Pirelli to task: ""The tires were probably too good. We need softer tires to ensure better wear. There has to be a solution on tracks with very soft asphalt. Otherwise, we\'ll have too many one-stop races.""\n\n> **Antonelli before next test.**\nHis teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli made a splash in Suzuka on his debut on the rollercoaster. Sixth place in the race, leading kilometers, and a new lap record put Mercedes in a good mood. Now the youngster will be returning to Bahrain, a track he knows and has already tested on with the W16.\n\n> The Italian, like his teammate Russell, sees tires as a crucial issue in the desert: ""In Suzuka, I didn\'t really have to worry about tire management; I could push, which was fun. But here it\'s a completely different story. We have old and very rough asphalt here. On top of that, it\'s very hot. Tire management will be a huge issue here.""\n\n> If Mercedes manages to treat the sensitive tires well in Bahrain, George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli could play a role in the fight for the podium. From the Silver Arrows\' perspective, this would be further proof that the W16 is a better racing car than its predecessor.']",6,2,0.88,6,1,1,6,2,0.88,6

Japan has been deemed boring, yet it's quite surprising that more races aren't like this.

There were other issues such as on a damp drying track going off line made it even harder to pass.

If you want to spice things up, there's reverse grids, which is silly, qualifying 1st come last in Monacco. Or drivers trying to get the lowest qualifying time but within the 107%. So that's out.

Randomised grid order, everyone will start in 1 position once. Requires the same number of cars as there are races. Plus starting last is more of a hinderence at some tracks than others.
And its a literal lottery.

So here's my idea. 3 rounds of qualifying you must use soft, medium, and hard compounds. But once you use one in a round you can only use that tyre, unless it rains.

Teams at the back could start on soft and try to get to Q2 but will then have a disadvantage in the later rounds. It adds an aspect of strategy in to play, which will mix up the grids, but is still based on performance and team strategy.

Either it's fine as it is, or there needs to be a shake up. Anyone got a better idea?","[""> If you line all the cars up in order of how fast they go i.e. qualifying, and then barring any accidents, shouldn't they naturally finish in that order.\n\nNo not in the slightest, as even at a basic level it doesn't address different strength of the cars/drivers.
