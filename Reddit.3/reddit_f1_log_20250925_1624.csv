We\'ll see how true it is. As long as every team can still be profitable while matching the new budget cap, I have no issue tbh. But if one, or more, teams can\'t even reach the cap, then it is a problem.', ""Not really a reveal, as this was public before (for example [here](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-says-maternity-leave-will-definitely-fall-outside-f1-2026-cost-cap/10614621/)). Basically a result of moving things into the cap that were outside and adjusting for inflation, whilst the actual spending level stays the same. Sounds big, but it's basically just shifting things around"", ""That's... a big increase"", 'Is this the same rules which are adjusting for regional pricing? E.g. Sauber is getting a lot more budget accounting for Swiss salaries.', ""Cost cap\n\n\n2021 $145m / ¬£105.43m\n\n\n2022 $140m / ¬£113.61m (104.14m inf. adj.)\n\n\n2023 $135m / ¬£108.58m (¬£91.62m inf. adj)\n\n\n2024 $135m / ¬£105.65m (¬£88.05m inf. adj)\n\n\n2025 $135m / ¬£102.86m (¬£82.34m inf. adj)\n\n\nKeep in mind the figure was supposed to be $175m, but reduced because of COVID. $175m = ¬£127.24m or inflation adjusted ¬£158.94m which is $192m.\n\n\nSo just the original cost cap, adjusted for inflation and currency would come out to at least $192m today. Plus whatever uplift for 2026 plus increased costs for new PU's etc. it puts it back in line with where it should have been, because before you are effectively just crippling the wages of the workers because drivers and CEOcs were exempt from the cap.\n\n\nI have my own opinion about that, but I don't think increasing the cap is a bad thing.
