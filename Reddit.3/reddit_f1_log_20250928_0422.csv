1nrn0fk,Mercedes sim failure contributed to Antonelli's F1 slump,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nrn0fk/mercedes_sim_failure_contributed_to_antonellis_f1/,2025-09-27, News,,"['could have use Logitech G923 like Alpine does', 'So Iâ€™m assuming their simulator is fixed, right?', 'He should try iRacing', 'Sim not working or running on too high grip level is a genuine problem for Mercedes\n\nThat said though itâ€™s still up to the driver to judge the grip level himself instead of blindly relying on the sim', 'Is the slump over though?\n\nBaku was not a good indicator because it was a cold, no deg race. Deg is what kills Kimi.\n\nLooked to me like he was still overdriving quite a lot during the race. George, who was far from 100% kicked his ass while being on slower tyres.\n\nSingapore should paint a clearer picture.', 'When they reverted the changes to his floor or undercarriage or whatever it was like 3 races ago, his performance immediately improved, and he started looking like the Antonelli from early season, putting up good results.', 'Maybe they should switch to eSIM to overcome this.\xa0 Environment friendlier too ðŸ¤£', 'No wonder he was beaching his car in the FPs..', 'Did the sim crash into Leclerc? Or have a bad start and push Albon off the track? Come on now...', 'Could have just said no to the simulator like Hamilton did pre 2021 ðŸ˜‚']",788,62,0.95,788,2786,2786,11,1,0.0,11
