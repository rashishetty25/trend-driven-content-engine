As a Perez fan, I agreed with this viewpoint simply on the basis that it felt like Perez was a bit closer to the ultimate pace than Albon was. He had five podiums, lost an all-but-certain podium to late mechanical failure in Abu Dhabi, lost a probable podium in Austria to a slow pit stop, a potential podium to a VSC in Brazil and was on course for one when the rain came down in Russia. He also had some on-track battles with Lewis that made him look very good, especially in the context of RBR desperately needing a driver to play a supporting role to Max. He had some lows but the potential was there for greater things and he fulfilled that (and then some) the following year.\n\nHowever, I’m curious - how much of that was Perez simply looking better than Albon because of the context? And how much of it was down to him looking better by being in a better car? Could the optics have simply been very kind to Perez?\n\nAnother thing with Albon is he scored a whopping 78% of Max’s points in 2019, which could’ve been over 95% if Lewis hadn’t yeeted him at the finish in Brazil. Yes, Albon was massively flattered by Max having problems at Spa, Monza, Suzuka and Mexico City - some his fault, some not. It’s also worth noting that Albon was basically guaranteed at least sixth even on a bad day in 2019.

1jjcr23,New Netflix show suggestion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjcr23/new_netflix_show_suggestion/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"# The Problem:

With the support of the FIA, I think there should be a new show to complement *Drive to Survive*.

I don’t mind *Drive to Survive*, but it has become more of a drama series than an in-depth coverage of the sport. While it’s great for bringing in new fans, it has also led to a wave of social media discourse from people who don’t fully understand the complexities of F1.

Formula 1 is an incredibly intricate sport, with countless elements that make it fascinating—car design, engines, racecraft, team strategies, and so much more. Yet, a lot of new fans miss these aspects, leading to takes like this one from the past few days:

>

This kind of misunderstanding happens all the time, and it’s frustrating because these are fundamental parts of the sport that have existed for decades.

# The Idea:

A new show that dives into the technical and strategic side of F1—covering the rules, mechanics, racecraft, and innovations that define the sport.

Each episode could focus on a different aspect:

* **Engines** – The different suppliers, why some teams build their own while others rely on manufacturers, how engines are managed across a season, cooling systems, and FIA regulations.
* **Car Regulations & Innovation** – How teams design their cars within the rules, how they push boundaries, and the technical loopholes they exploit.
* **Racecraft & Strategy** – The tactical decisions made during a race, pit stop strategies, driver-team communications, and how they impact performance.
* **Behind the Scenes** – A day in the life of a pit crew member, engineers, and mechanics, showcasing their roles and contributions.

With engaging visuals, expert commentary, and perhaps even actors or F1-loving celebrities acting as the audience, asking the questions casual fans might have, this show could bridge the gap between hardcore fans and newcomers.

It looked nailed on around Spa that Ricciardo would be jumping into the Red Bull, numerous reports that the Verstappen camp fully expected it and were surprised when it didn’t materialise for whatever reason. Once that decision was made the writing was really on the wall, but I don’t think anyone really expected them to pull the trigger mid season like they did. In my opinion, they should’ve given him to the end of the year and if they’d made the decision to get rid of Checo, could’ve lined up like this in 2025:

RBR: Verstappen/Ricciardo
RB: Tsunoda/Lawson

Hadjar as reserve wouldn’t have been the worst move for his career, and if Ricciardo struggled they then had the option of swapping one of Lawson or Tsunoda into the seat. A year or two would’ve been Daniel’s max stint anyway and that time to develop would’ve benefitted Lawson and allowed Hadjar his route into the sport.

The advantage Ricciardo offered was his years of experience on what by all accounts is a difficult car, and the fact he likes a pointy front end similar to Max and so set up wise they’d be more aligned. It would also give us an insight into just how far Max’s set up has taken the car, and also once and for all answered the Ricciardo question. It doesn’t massively delay any of the RBR talent pool, and they keep a veteran who’s well liked around?","['Hate to quote marko but this is not netflix, bro fell off', 'Just let him go.', 'All in all, in my opinion, RBR has made a numerous of bad decisions. but our speculations are only matters of WHAT IF situations. \n\nWhat if they lose Checo, put DR in the Red Bull seat, and Lawson in VCARB last year?   \nWhat if they put Tsunoda instead of Lawson that Red Bull seat this season? \n\nAgain, these are purely speculations.
