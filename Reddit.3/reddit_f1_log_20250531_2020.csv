Or is it something about design philosophy like how the 2023 and 2024 williams prioritised top speed?","['It‚Äôs less about regulations and more about team design philosophy. \n\nFor the past‚Ä¶ 10 years or so, Williams main design philosophy has been ‚Äòtop speed‚Äô. They fell into that by default of their new Mercedes engines when the 2014 regs came in and saved Claire‚Äôs ass, and they kept philosophy since: Make the car stable and fast in a straight line at the expense of cornering and responsiveness. \n\nThis was especially prominent during the dark years between 2018-21 when Monza and Mexico were basically Williams‚Äô only legitimate chance at points barring something crazy happening like Germany 2019. \n\nNow with Dorilton as the owners and James as the TP, the design philosophy is changing with the culture. And with a long term driver in Albon alongside Sainz as the veteran, instead of the revolving door of pay drivers, they‚Äôre getting better driver feedback.', ""You can either make your car good at straight lines \nOr good in turns \n\nYou can't make it both due to the laws of physics \n\nAs a result teams adjust their cars differently to try find a good balance \n\nHowever in F1 your only aloud so much testing and RnD time so often you don't know where you're car sits until you're already in the season as result certain cars end up on the straight line of things or on bendy side of the balance which means certain tracks that favourite straight line speed reward the speedy cars and cars that can conour well do better in bendy tracks \n\n(Slightly joke here)\nAnd then you have McLaren who decided to fuck aero and just worked out how to keep the tires cold so there car works everywhere because the tires dont fall apart lol"", 'In Williams‚Äôs case they werent exactly great anywhere in this time span, except some low drag tracks\n\nAlso in all their better years, the car progressed due to in season upgrades. 2021, 2023 and 2024 all had upgrades mid season, but later than catalunya\n\nThis statistic exists for Catalunya cause it‚Äôs the only ‚Äúearly‚Äù season track that‚Äôs consistently been on the calendar since then.(besides Monaco, but i think they were generally shit at Monaco too)\n\nAustralia had a big COVID gap and they scored with the hards gamble with Albon in 2023, not because the car had pace\n\nChina had a big COVID gap\n\nSuzuka had a COVID gap and it used to be in autumn anyway\n\nImola wasnt on the calendar precovid\n\nJeddah is only a thing since 2021, and the first gp was in autumn\n\nMiami is also a new track\n\nMonaco and Catalunya are the only tracks that have been consistent early season in this time frame\n\nFor example, i remember the 2021 Williams having upgrades around Austria, the 2023 one in Canada and the 2024 one i‚Äôm not sure but still later in the summer. All these cars made a big step with upgrades, but till then werent exactly remarkable', 'Im not too sure but I have a feel it has to do with the Williams design philosophy across all regs and they always make a car based to their expertise which they know best even if it makes them vulnerable and certain tracks', 'Watching an interview with Vowles at the moment - Rosberg pointed out that the Williams‚Äô weaknesses here are aerodynamics and prolonged corners.', 'just to add what was mentioned already in other comments, I remember James Allison talking about new rules and how teams go into working on them and he basically said that teams never start from scratch, they take their current car and say for example the new rule is changing the front wing width, so they take the current car with their latest data and simulation and change that car‚Äôs wing width then see how different the data is and it affected the car then identify the negatives and positives of that change and then start working on fixing the negative outcome but all is happening on the current car because basically they own so much of valuable data to throw it away. In that context, it‚Äôs understandable that cars can suffer from specific things over 10 years period because they never designed a completely new car and always adapted the new rules to the current car.', 'Barcelona is all about aerodynamic efficiency, how much usable high-speed downforce you can produce with the least amount of drag. Historically it\'s produced a lot of ""Noah\'s Ark"" grids, where the teams literally line up 2x2 because what is happening is that the performance of the car was the limiting factor. (It\'s going to be a boring ass race tomorrow.)', ""They've always been using Mercedes, which was a great engine then and the constructor's champ engine last year."", 'Williams made a top speed machine in 2014-16 but it was still a decent chassis.
