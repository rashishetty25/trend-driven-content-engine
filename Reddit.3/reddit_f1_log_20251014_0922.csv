At least it's a few new theories that I haven't seen floated around before.\n\nI found the part about Ferrari often losing out quite badly when the FIA decides to close certain loopholes quite good. Their competitors also use loopholes that the FIA is trying to close all the time, yet somehow they don't lose out **that** badly. Is Ferrari using the grey areas of the rules too much and losing out too much, when in the end the FIA comes knocking on the doors of Maranello? It's an interesting take that I haven't really seen before. \n\nThis is also the first time I see that weird asymmetric brake theory that got debunked about Red Bull so many times, linked to another team. Specifically Ferrari with their temperature issues between the brakes. I've not come across that one yet. Although the FIA did say that none of the teams were actually using it."", '\nTranslated through ChatGPT\n\nPart 1:\n\n‚ÄúFerrari‚Äôs Five Years on the Edge ‚Äî From Secret Deals to Failing Brakes\n\nThe brakes are only the latest example: since 2020, Ferrari has been in a constant state of catch-up, chasing performance through borderline solutions that come with unsustainable risks.\n\nIt all began in February 2020. The COVID pandemic had just broken out in Italy, and winter testing in Barcelona had come to an end. Ferrari‚Äôs mechanics and engineers looked tense throughout the two weeks, giving the impression that the SF1000 was suffering from serious problems ‚Äî most likely aerodynamic. After the previous year‚Äôs SF90 (a rocket on the straights but lacking downforce), Ferrari had made a dramatic shift in design.\n\nWhen asked if the car had indeed gained downforce, Sebastian Vettel simply replied ‚Äúyes.‚Äù Data showed a marked loss of top-end speed. The most plausible theory forming in the paddock was that Ferrari had gained downforce, but in a highly inefficient way.\n\nAnd then, just as the crates were being loaded in the Montmel√≥ paddock, the FIA website suddenly published an announcement: what would become known as the infamous secret agreement between Ferrari and the federation regarding the use of the 2019 power unit.\n\nMore than five years later, the terms of that deal remain unknown ‚Äî but the results that followed spoke volumes. Both the SF1000 and its successor, the SF21, showed a clear power deficit compared to the competition. It was effectively confirmation that Ferrari had agreed not to use a certain technique or technology that had previously given it a performance advantage in how it exploited the hybrid power unit.\n\nThe most surprising part wasn‚Äôt that such an agreement had been made, but that once Ferrari removed the system or technology in question, the team didn‚Äôt just fall back to the level of its rivals ‚Äî it fell far below them. That fueled speculation that the deal had even been punitive. Whatever the device or method was, it clearly didn‚Äôt just provide extra horsepower ‚Äî it seemed to have been an integral part of Ferrari‚Äôs baseline performance.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nTD39 and the Flexibility of the Floor Plank\n\nAfter two seasons in limbo came 2022, bringing the long-awaited overhaul of aerodynamic regulations and the debut of the new ground-effect cars. Ferrari launched the F1-75, and the season started brilliantly: the car had downforce, driveability, power, and a broad setup window. Charles Leclerc led the championship early on and went head-to-head with Max Verstappen through the middle phase of the season.\n\nBut then the competitive balance began to shift. Several teams, most notably Mercedes, complained about the violent porpoising effect of the new designs.\n\nAt the end of June, the FIA issued the now-famous Technical Directive 039 (TD39). Beyond addressing the porpoising metric, the directive also closed a grey area concerning the flexibility of the floor plank.\nIt came into effect at the Belgian Grand Prix, and immediately Ferrari‚Äôs team radio chatter (especially between Sainz and engineer Adami) focused on managing plank wear over the bumps at Eau Rouge and at the end of the Kemmel straight.\n\nFerrari still looked competitive in France and Hungary ‚Äî despite driver and pit wall errors ‚Äî but from Belgium onwards, the story changed completely. Ferrari‚Äôs form collapsed. Red Bull won every race until Abu Dhabi, except for Russell‚Äôs victory for Mercedes in Brazil.\n\nMany blamed politics, aerodynamics, or the porpoising issue, but the real question lingered: how much of Ferrari‚Äôs performance had depended on that grey area which the directive had just shut down? Because once it was gone, so was Ferrari‚Äôs pace.‚Äù', 'When left with no options, you gotta stick the entire thing into Google Translate and then paste into a word document.', 'Pretty much all web browsers have in-browser translation available', 'As I understand (and according to Duchessa and co.), the issues with braking are related to the plank wear. Ferrari is trying to regain some of the lost load by running smaller brake ducts, as well as using more aggressive settings at the front for balance.', ""Ferrari engineer 1: Ok, FIA closed that loophole. What's our backup plan?\n\nFerrari engineer 2: Backup plan?\n\nFerrari engineer 3: Next year..."", '> I found the part about Ferrari often losing out quite badly when the FIA decides to close certain loopholes quite good.\n\nThe times of FIA being called Ferrari international assistance are well gone, but it\'s interesting to see the clamp down.  \nBut similarly most queries about ""is this legal"" come from competitors and if the result is no, a TD is issued clarifying FIA interpretation of rules.  \n  \nOne can say that between 2017 and 2023 both Mercedes and Red Bull had an interest in checking the potential legality of their closest competitors and thus asking for such clarifications.  \nSimilarly to the tire water clarification this year or the TD outlining that phase change materials are against the spirit of the rules.']",230,14,0.97,230,329,329,0,0,0.0,0

While it is a wild speculation, Red Bull is known for making unexpected moves. Should Lindblad and Dunne make extraordinary progress in F2, they could swiftly replace Tsunoda and Lawson. It would be a huge gamble, but that is precisely the kind of decision Marko makes. The current situation in the F1 driver market indicates Red Bull is eager to secure their top future talent quickly, even if it means ruthlessly discarding experienced drivers. Such a radical move would instantly elevate the stakes in the junior categories, placing immense pressure on both Lindblad and Dunne to perform immediately. Furthermore, their lack of F1 experience could destabilize the junior team, but the hunger for a future champion often overrides short-term risk assessments in Milton Keynes.","[""I doubt Dunne will be in F1 in 2026 tbh. I think he stays in F2 and goes for the title next year with a view to take one of the Vcarb seats in 2027.\n\nAlso I'm not fully sure about his super license situation as there are some conflicting reports, but there is a chance Vcarb can't put him in next year even if they wanted to"", 'I believe Dunne has been linked to a second season in F2 with backing from Red Bull.

If he does, then maybe, but needs a marked change in results.', ""Certainly possible. Tsunoda is very likely gone, while Mekies seems to support him more and there is more of an acceptance that the Red Bull is just really hard to drive, his results still haven't been great, and with Honda leaving there's less incentive to keep him. Hadjar will likely get promoted and it feels a bit pointless to keep Tsunoda around.\n\nLawson maybe gets a bit more grace if they felt they rushed him into RB too quickly, but similarly it may feel a bit like he's had his chance. He has been solid in the latter half of the season though, likely they'd prefer to have one more experienced driver to compare a rookie too, so I feel like he'll stay another year.\n\nI feel like the lineup will be Verstappen and Hadjar in Red Bull, Lawson and Lindblad in VCARB. Then if Lindblad gets up to speed well enough, Dunne will replace Lawson in 2027, after another year in F2.

1o6a1ui,Most underrated F1 races?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o6a1ui/most_underrated_f1_races/,2025-10-14, Discussion,"As the title says, what do you guys think are the most underrated F1 races? Races that were quietly great but overshadowed by other races during the season?

For me, I would pick:

Brazil 2022: IMO, this is the best race of the season (even above Silverstone) but it gets a bit forgotten these days because it happened during the second half where Max started to dominate. Russell's first win, Merc 1-2, Charles getting tonked on the first lap by Lando but recovering to finish 4th, Red bull drama, Alonso recovery to finish 5th from 17th. The entire weekend was just great tbh starting with Magnussen's shock pole.

Italy 2023: Another race that gets forgotten because it happened during Max's dominance but it was quite fun, mainly because of Sainz fighting the red bulls and then the battle between Charles and himself. (No risk charles, no risk)

USA 2022: Another race overshadowed by Max's dominance but actually a really great race. Sainz getting tonked by Russell on lap 1, multiple safety cars, Alonso sent flying by Stroll but still recovering to finish in the points, Charles' majestic recovery drive and his (mini) battle with Max, RBR's botched pitstop which meant we briefly got to see Max and Lewis battli for the lead and, of course, Seb driving like an absolute madman to hold off Magnuessen on the line. (He even led the race briefly!)

Suzuka 2022: For a rain curtailed race, this was pretty good. Max and Charles tearing away from the rest of the pack in the first few laps was crazy (until Charles' tires fell off), Charles going off at the last few corners to let Perez through, Alonso and Seb's crazy battle to the line... a good race considering the circumstances. 

I am a newer F1 fan so I can't speak much for older races. 

","['Brazil ‚Äò22 was nuts Russell‚Äôs breakout, Red Bull drama, Seb‚Äôs last dance energy. \n\nAlso check out Turkey ‚Äò20, crazy wet-dry race where everyone slipped except Lewis.
