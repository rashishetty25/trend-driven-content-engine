What is it I don‚Äôt get about McLaren culture that makes you stand so much from almost every other competitor in the history of the championship? \n\n*Oscar*: I mean, I think we‚Äôve said many, many times now that we don‚Äôt just want a chance of this success just for this year. You know, there‚Äôs a big regulations change next year. We don‚Äôt know how competitive we‚Äôre going to be, we don‚Äôt know how competitive anyone‚Äôs going to be. **But you know, ultimately, we want the best chance of winning championships for as long as we‚Äôre Formula 1 drivers, and we‚Äôre both at McLaren for a very long time. And protecting the people around us that give us this opportunity is a very important thing. So I think it‚Äôs easy enough to put yourself second at times like that.** Especially, if we were fighting very closely the whole race, then you know, it‚Äôs slightly different.

You know, it‚Äôs not a very nice feeling, I would imagine. **So it‚Äôs important to protect all the people that we have because that‚Äôs what gives us a championship hope for years to come.** \n\n*Lando*: That was beautiful. He said it well, I don‚Äôt need to add anymore. **The team is priority. Team is number one, then drivers are second. That‚Äôs how it works.** Normally when you see teams who don‚Äôt have some sort of, enough respect for the team and the opportunities that the team give, it normally doesn‚Äôt last long. And you see that with plenty of other teams whether it‚Äôs been Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes. And we want to try and be in this position for a longer period of time than what they have been at the top. So it‚Äôs still early days. It‚Äôs only our second year of fighting for wins.

1nhb26r,How do you think the ‚ÄúF1‚Äù Car from the F1 movie would compare to an F2 car in terms of performance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nhb26r/how_do_you_think_the_f1_car_from_the_f1_movie/,2025-09-15, Technical,"As I‚Äôm sure many of you know, to film the F1 movie, they used a modified F2 car that was meant to look like an F1 car. Obviously, the prop car isn‚Äôt going to compete with real F1 cars‚Äîthe R&D is nowhere near the level of even the worst F1 car, the engine isn‚Äôt as powerful, etc. But how do you think it would compare to an F2 car? Like, I read that the bodywork was primarily carbon fibre, and the fact that they were trying to build bodywork to look like an F1 car and at least somewhat fit with FIA F1 aero regulations makes me wonder if maybe it had superior aerodynamics to the average F2 car? And that combined with having the same engine makes me wonder if it would perform above the level of an F2 car, at least around the corners.","['They fitted plenty of cameras in it, that is the reason they choose F2 cars over F1 cars.\n\nSo probably, AXGP cars will much slower than regular F2 cars', 'It would be slower. While the aero they added was ""real"" (i.e. it generated useful amounts of downforce), it was not remotely optimized to reduce drag. So the net result is a car that is heavier and draggier than an F2 car, but using an F2 engine.\n\nSam Collins did an interesting interview with the vehicle coordinator for the movie talking about how they built the cars (including the electric version they used for the pit lane shots).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tv\\_W8ZLndM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tv_W8ZLndM)', ""I reckon it'll be slower. The aero is for looks; I know they had to work a bit to make it drivable but suspect it's not adding much other than weight..."", ""I'd expect it to be worse than F2 cars. I would be shocked if the APX car had properly executed ground effect like current gen F2 cars, and the overbody aero is much less thought through than the 2018 gen F2s\n\nand even if the APX did have more downforce than current F2s, there's no telling how well it handles aero in corners, dirty air or cross winds, or if it has too much drag for what that engine can pull"", 'If you‚Äôre ever near an Apple Store, go do the Vision Pro demo where they have a ride along with Brad Pitt driving the car. It‚Äôs very underpowered and slow. Or maybe that was just Brad Pitts driving. It looked very underpowered as well, barely able to pull through 3rd gear down the straight.', 'Well, none of the F2 cars are set up for combat, so......', 'Surely worse than an F2 car, probably better than an F3, just because of the higher HPs engine.\n\nBut I bet the handling is shit nonetheless, as the prop cars were made for a completely different purpose than racing.', ""I don't have the answer to this, but I'm surprised this post didn't get any engagement"", 'That is a practice lap.
