1k3usr0,Karun at the SkyPad analyses the Verstappen Piastri move that gave Verstappen a 5s penalty Post 2025 Saudi Arabian GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k3usr0/karun_at_the_skypad_analyses_the_verstappen/,2025-04-20, Video,,"['Fantastic launch by Piastri', 'F1 beginner here, is p2 the stronger of the positions at the front?', ""Norris also remained ahead after trying a move on the outside In Mexico last year turn 4, he didn't receive any penalty which I think Is fine but why the Inconsistency? Why and how Verstappen won the penalty both ways when he takes the exact opposite role?"", 'Imo, Oscar had that corner and Verstappen absolutely gained an advantage leaving the track \n\nIgnore my flair, but I might be a little bias', '""He\'s won the corner"". Why? The moment Karun paused at the apex, Max is right alongside. Yes, max has more speed, but he\'s also coming from all the way on the outside of the corner where the racing line is, allowing him to carry more speed. I think it\'s really not as slam dunk as people make it out to be.', ""There are a few problems with how these situations are being judged.\n\nSo the idea behind any ruling of this kind these days is that the car ahead at the apex is entitled to the corner.\n\nFine, now here are the problems with this. Corners have multiple apexes, depending on the line you're taking. In a situation such as this, where a car is on the inside, while the other is on the outside, the apexes will differ. So this is not a good benchmark to begin with. \n\nNot only that, but chicanes are actually a nightmare in this situation. Same scenario - two cars alongside each other. The one on the inside has ths entry. Fine. The problem is that the car on the outside upon entry has the better line for the exit out of the chicane. And that's what I hate the most about this situation. Everybody, from the fans to the stewards act like this ain't actually a thing. \n\nThe rulings they always dish out in these scenarios clearly indicate that they expect the car that has the worse line upon entry to yield the whole chicane. But nobody has the guts to actually lay it out in writing. To actually turn it into a rule. Because how the hell would you tell racing drivers to yield two corners based on a relative benchmark?\n\nNow with regards to the Verstappen-Piastri situation.  Please don't come at me with the 'Max would've never made the corner' nomsense. That's the single dumbest take I've seen within the F1 community since 2021.\n\nHe obviously did make the corner. He didn't go out because he had too much speed. He went out because Oscar took the optimal line throughout the whole chicane. Now, yet again, if the standard for chicanes is indeed that the car with the optimal line upon entry is entitled to the whole thing, then fine. I don't agree with it, but turn it into a rule. We don't even have this. We only have rulings that act as if this is what the regulations say, but they don't.\n\nI think Max was a bit too ambitious, however I really dislike how Oscar acts as if the chicane was entirely his. The fact is that he wasn't actually ahead at the apex, which is why people keep spreading around the whole 'Max wouldn't have made the corner nonsense'. They are aware of it, they just pretend that Max was alongside/ahead simply because he bombed into the corner. It's clearly not the case. \n\nIf you don't like Max's behavior in t1, which I can see why, then you shouldn't like Oscar's behavior in t2 either. He clearly had not intention to leave any space and acted as if he was a full car length ahead.\n\nIf they didn't take any action against Hamilton in Abu Dhabi 2021, then they shouldn't have taken any here as well. \n\nThe truth is that Max has a solid case in claiming that he was pushed out. Because he clearly was, midway through the chicane. Just like Hamilton could make this case with regards to the Abu Dhabi lap 1 incident."", 'While I agree max was never making that corner, I fins the way you can muscle people off the road if you ahead at the apex frustrating. It just leads to bad and unsporting racing. This is not how other series do it.', 'When did they change the penalty? If Lap 1 was mitigating factor and Lando got 5s and Max supposed to get 10s but because of Lap 1 he got 5s.\n\n  \nEDIT: Already last year.', 'There was no way verstappen were going to make that corner even if piastry weren’t there. He had to much speed and being on the outside into the corner.\n \nCorrect decision but 5s is not enough imo.']",64,105,0.77,64,667,667,-1,0,0.0,-1

1k3zqmf,Has the ground effect era been a success?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k3zqmf/has_the_ground_effect_era_been_a_success/,2025-04-20, Discussion,"Given this is the last season before another shift in regulations, the question is simple, but also rather complicated at the same time. Most ‘casual’ F1 fans would look at the question at face value, and probably come to the conclusion that no, it has not. The simple reason being Red Bull’s dominance since the introduction of the regulation changes. 

However, there is also the argument to be made that Max’s dominance could mislead opinions. It was only in 2023 that the Red Bull managed a 1-2 in championship standings, 2022 saw Perez finishing 3rd on a similar points tally to Charles, with George not miles behind. 2024 seeing Perez all the way down in 8th. Which suggest as everyone understands, the Red Bull certainly has had its struggles in terms of drivability. 

F1 isn’t just about championships though, so what about the rest of the field? I think the best measure for this is to look at average overtakes per season, given the whole reasoning behind the reg changes was to promote better racing, with cars being able to follow closer to the car in front, and for longer without their tyres being cooked. So, let’s look at the numbers:

2014: 45.2
2015: 33.1
2016: 52.2
2017: 25.5
2018: 35.7
2019: 45.2
2020: 36.9
2021: 36.7
2022: 45.2
2023: 50
2024: 38.8

It’s actually interesting to see that bar 2023, numbers were somewhat similar, with similar fluctuations to preceding seasons. 

For me it comes down to two questions:

1) Did it break a one team dominance?
2) Did it promote competitive racing throughout the grid?

For the first I’d say again, a complicated answer. Yes, Red Bull were dominant. However, the overwhelming reason behind this was Max’s pure dominance. With the second seat looking more in line with the other top teams. So, I would argue that whilst on the face of things the answer would be a no, if you take the Max factor into consideration it’s actually a yes. 

For the second, I think as the numbers support, we didn’t see a suddenly more competitive mid to lower pack, with it seemingly staying around the same in terms of competitive performance.

I also think we’re now seeing with multiple years of development of cars under the regs it’s becoming less competitive. The joke of this season being more of a qualifying championship than a racing one, popping up far too frequently than we’d like.

Interested to see other people’s perspective on this topic.

For me there are two I'd bring in immediately.

1. IndyCar's offset timing line in qualifying. Without the need for full in/out laps, teams would be able to get more laps in during quali at tracks like Spa, and at tracks like Monza where traffic is an issue, there could potentially be fewer cars on track.

2. MotoGP's Long Lap penalty. Take Max's penalty at Jeddah for example. If rather than waiting until his stop to serve a 5 second penalty, why not make him take a long lap within 3 laps? It would have likely put him back behind Piastri and maybe we'd have seen a fight for the lead? It would also be fairer on drivers who get a 5 second penalty after their last stop only for the race to end behind the safety car.

1k4hewo,Is McLaren 2025 Really Dominant or Just Consistently Good?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k4hewo/is_mclaren_2025_really_dominant_or_just/,2025-04-21, Discussion,"During this season, McLaren has undoubtedly shown impressive long-run pace, especially in the last three race weekends. Their FP1 and FP2 race pace simulations looked incredibly strong — often outpacing rivals by 3 to 6 tenths over race distance runs. On paper, that should translate to dominance... but when it comes to actual Qualifying and Race Day performance, the story seems different.

We’ve seen in the past how Max and Lewis used to win races with 20+ second margins. With the hype surrounding McLaren this season, I expected something similar. But that hasn’t really been the case. In fact, it feels like the opposite.

Yes, their car struggles in dirty air — we’ve all noticed how poor it is at following other cars. But even in clean air during Quali (FP3, Q2, Q3), their single-lap pace hasn’t looked unbeatable. George Russell, for example, is often right there with them in terms of one-lap performance.

So, is McLaren truly dominant this season, or are we just caught up in the hype? They might be the fastest team overall, but they don’t seem to have the kind of crushing dominance we saw from Red Bull or Mercedes in their prime.

Is it fair to think this way, or am I just expecting too much?","[""Pretty much what you said, the McLaren is the consistently best car, generally has the best tyre wear and pace.\n\nVerstappen, for example, has to be perfect in somewhere like Suzuka, or this weekend in SA to beat them - but it's clearly been possible.\n\nI do also think Norris' struggles in the car are making it look a bit less dominant than it is. Since he has generally been the faster driver between himself and Piastri, if he was comfortable in the car, they could have ended up with more 1-2s etc."", 'The sport went from having the Mercedes-Hamilton combination to the Red Bull-Verstappen combination. There\'s people that genuinely don\'t know that you can have the best car but not ve dominant. I\'m in that category, I started following around 2019 but I\'ve looked at past season and tried to learn about the ""old times"". \n\nRn, there\'s almost a need for a team to be dominant. If you are not a generational talent then most of your achievements are down to the car per some people online. The question is how much do you care about a random person\'s opinion. I think most people that are involved in F1 rn agree that McLaren is undoubtedly the best car but they don\'t have the gap that Mercedes had or RB had in years past.', 'The McLaren advantage is most likely expected to show in hot races, according to Zak in the post race F1TV interview after Jeddah. Which supports why we saw such glaring differences in pace for FO3 Bahrain and Jeddah. \n\nI think the best of McLaren is yet to come. I am currently hoping RBRs Miami upgrade levels the playing field', '""They\'re going to be good everywhere"" got confused for ""they\'re going to be dominant"".\n\nBy years end I think Lando and Oscar are 1-2 and by a good margin, however each circuit will still present it\'s own challenges and as we\'ve seen already, Max, George, and the Ferraris on their best days can battle with or be better. It\'s just going to likely rotate a bit through those three while McLaren is always there. Through 5 races this is tougher to see but I think by the mid-way point it will start to become apparent.', ""Hot weather most likely dominant, others it's consistently the best. Piastri being in his third season and Norris having a bad run is just overshadowing it. But it's no Max & RB19 dominance; but Checo wouldn't have been as dominant in that RB19 so it might be comparable."", ""I think they are dominant but we've maybe not seen the ideal conditions in which they can really dominate. In Australia they pulled a HUGE gap on Max in the dry stint before he caught back up to them on inters. In Bahrain, Oscar's gap over the rest of the field was pretty sizable."", 'They’re obviously dominant currently, but not enough to make up for major driver error - unlike the RB19 for example.\n\nThat is why they’re leading the WCC and the WDC and have won 4 out of 5 races despite arguably not the best drivers of the top teams.', ""It's the clear fastest car but not dominant in any sense imho. I fully discount practice as a datapoint because Red Bull has clearly run lower engine modes since 21 at least and recently also tries experimental setups before (more often than not) getting it all together by Qualifying. The McLaren's main advantage is its wide setup window which lets them hit the ground running anywhere and its ability to look after the rears which only really helps in places with high deg like Bahrain and China. That isn't a guaranteed edge every weekend which is why you see can Red Bull nail their narrow setup window and be on the pace or a close battle at a low deg track like Suzuka or Jeddah that negates the McLaren's tire advantage. In terms of peak car performance when everything is dialed in, the RB21 is close enough that Max can make up the difference."", 'Nothing comes close to the Mercedes domination of 14-16 and 20 IMO. So comparing it to that, then there is no domination but McClaren have been very strong in Australia (dry part), China and Bahrein and only in Suzuka and Jeddah they looked beatable as a result of two insane laps from Max \n\nQualifying has been rather close since 2022 and even jn 2023, Red Bull was beatable about half the qualifying sessions as well (also because of their focus on race pace).']",0,36,0.32,0,33,33,0,12,0.03999999999999998,0

1k4aoyv,What if Sainz is driving the SF-25?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k4aoyv/what_if_sainz_is_driving_the_sf25/,2025-04-21, Discussion,"Now we know Lewis is having trouble extracting performance from the Ferrari and he's further from Leclerc than Sainz normally was, but I was watching Leclerc's interviews and he said that he hasn't been this comfortable with a car in a very long time. He pointed out that the car is less predictable now but he likes it that way. Lewis also said that the car fits Leclerc's overseer-heavy driving style really well. 

Now that makes me wonder, how would Sainz handle the SF-25? The car's balance seems to be pretty similar to the early-form F1-75, a car that Sainz had difficulties extracting performance from. Personally I think Sainz would struggle in similar way to how he did in 2022, maybe to a slightly lesser extent. ","[""Charles has also said the car is very difficult to drive & he kept making a lot of corrections through out the race.I don't think this car is that similar to f1-75.\n\nThe level of comfort that Charles had in f1-75 for first half of the season was something else.He was literally flying in Aus 2022.\n\nAnd about Sainz I think he will do better than Hamilton bc he is inherently more familiar with the car but he will trail slightly behind Charles just like he always did apart from 4-5 weekends."", 'He would do better than Hamilton, but be slightly behind Leclerc, as he always was', ""Who knows? Carlos' first year with Ferrari was very similar to where Hamilton is - a mixture of P5-P8 etc, with Charles ending up P4-P7 alot, which is a current trend so far this year. \n\nSo, I would guess - probably about the same?"", 'This car is nothing like f1-75.

It doesn’t suit Charles driving style, he just coped with it better.', 'Stop inventing', ""Hard to judge after 5 races. Good to see Sainz getting to grips with the Williams but he only has 5 points in the standings Vs Albon at 20. The same with Lewis. He made the below expectation start with Ferrari but Carlos was judged over 3-4 years at Ferrari. We're only 5 races in we still have 19 races and 5 sprints left. Let's at least give it a season.\n\n Hamilton doesn't look like he has the answers now but who knows maybe Ferrari adds more downforce or rear grip to the car which can help improve his performance"", 'I actually do think the gap would be bigger than the average gap between Charles and Carlos but yes, less than the one with Lewis.\n\nThe SF-25 is slow, that’s the big issue, but Charles actually seems to love to drive it. The pace isn’t there but he’s very comfortable in the set up and driving it and has found a way to extract everything out of it.\n\nEvery-time Charles is comfortable in the car, the gap between him and Carlos grew. Considering Charles usually can comfortably out-qualify Carlos in Bahrain and Saudi, my guess is the qualifying gap in Bahrain would’ve been around two tenths but bigger again in Saudi     \n\nAnd then I think Charles would have the clear advantage in race pace, I think that’s where he actually had more of an advantage over Carlos.\n\nOn tracks Charles likes, when he’s comfortable with the car and not making small mistakes in qualifying, it’s very unlikely Carlos would be a real threat to him. Yeah he might be doing a bit better than Lewis but I still don’t think Ferrari have any reason to regret their decision.\n\nTheir fastest driver is still their fastest driver so they haven’t lost any footing in the drivers championship. Might hurt their WCC but any money they lose by a place lost in that they gain by the profitability of Lewis Hamilton on their team. \n\nFerrari have also had the same two drivers since 2021. It’s good to get a fresh perspective on the car from a different driver. No, not developing the car in Lewis’s direction but input from drivers is necessary to make it faster. \n\nCharles and Carlos were incredibly competitive which meant they learned a lot from each other, and to have new teammates means they now have different drivers to learn different strengths, like tracks that neither Charles or Carlos were particularly strong at.', ""On average in qualifying Hamilton is actually slightly closer to Leclerc than Sainz was beginning of 2021 when he joined Ferrari. So maybe Sainz would've performed better this year had they kept him given his familiarity with the team and their cars, but it's not a sure thing. It's only been 5 races"", 'He’s not.
