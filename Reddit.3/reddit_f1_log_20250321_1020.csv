In my humble opinion, Chris Amon was a great and versatile driver who just never had the luck or reliability to win a Grand Prix, and if I may say, if he got to drive with Ferrari in their early 60 era, he may have been a contender for a championship. Ferrari in the late 60s were just struggling to keep up with Lotus, Brabham and Matra International (future Tyrrell) so getting podiums quite consistently was an amazing feat by Amon.

He was also very capable of doing great with a newcomer such as March in 1970, being able to finish at the podium a three times (2 second places and one third) that season (although the 701 was quite a competitive chassis overall). Even at his brief stint at Matra in 1971 and 1972 he was able to get two poles (1971 Italian GP and 1972 French GP) with a car that was just not as good as before.

To sum it up, Chris Amon is not talked about much due to how long it has been since he last competed in F1, but his record shows how much of a wasted talent he was, maybe if he got a seat at Lotus in 68' he could have won a race ir maybe a few more, we will never know how good this man truly could have been.

And to quote Mario Andretti on how unlucky Amon was: ""if he became an undertaker, people would stop dying"", or even legendary Ferrari engineer Mauro Forghieri: ""by far the best test driver I have ever worked with. He had all the qualities to be a World Champion but bad luck just wouldn't let him be"".","['If you were a Kiwi, your dad would have been telling you this ever since you were old enough to remember. \n\nFun fact: Brendon Hartley is the second unluckiest driver.', 'Really was the best part of that late 60s Ferrari team. I think in 69 he finished one race. Just a dire period for them.', ""My favourite quote regarding Amon has to be that Andretti one (edit: I initially repeated the quote because I can't read). \n\nAmon himself always said later in life that he was lucky to just have survived the era of formula 1 he raced in (unlike Clark, Rindt, Cevert, and so many others).\n\nIn my totally unbiased kiwi opinion I reckon he was the best driver to never win a race."", 'He won arguably the most famous Le Mans race in history.', 'the Nico Hulkenberg of the 1960s?', 'Liam Lawson third?', 'The more you learn of F1 history, the more you realize that Ferrari going through dire times is actually the norm, not the exception.', 'Thank you for repeating a quote from the post.', 'Ken Miles was robbed', ""He'll be fine.

I've always dreamt of a career in Motorsports, but i don't have the money nor the time to become one, so my secondary choice went to becoming a Motorsport engineer, potentially in Formula 1. I've planned most things already: from the University I'll go to, the faculty I'll choose (mechanical engineering), and i chose the University that collaborated with the Formula SAE (Formula Student) project as well; both the engineering degree and the Formula Student experience can and are fundamental in my CV to be an engineer in higher grades of motorsport, but I've never asked myself, beyond my passion of engines and cars, how would working as a Formula One engineer actually feel like, so can someone who's had a first hand experience tell me about it?","['I\'m not sure if this helps but Calum from Red Bull is a ""senior mechanic"" and I really liked his interview with High Performance, commenting on different aspects of his job, the pressure to perform, diversity, and little things like how he went up and down the paddock asking if he could volunteer for a weekend, until somebody said yes.

I used to remember not so long ago videos explaining the driving style of memorable f1 drivers, such as Alonso, Schumacher, Senna, Hamilton, Vettel, Verstappen, even Marc M√°rquez, if im not wrong. I strongly remember that the thumbnails were a photo of the driver with a solid dark grey background behind.

Some of the videos were quite popular, I think they were from JaramaFan. I used to watch them frequently, as they were of an excellent quality, explaining the ability of adaptation from fernando as well as his renault-michelin technique (neutroviraje), the tire management from seb or the late brake from lewis.

From one day to the next, they went from being among the first result to being unexistant.

Maybe I am giving it more importance than I should, but I have never encountered other videos as good as them on the same topic and I believe they are worthy to preserve.
