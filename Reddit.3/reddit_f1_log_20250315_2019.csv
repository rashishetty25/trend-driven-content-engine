Hell, Perez was closer in the 2020 RP than he was in 2021 RB, meaning RP was probably the 2nd quickest car in 2020, but Max is just an alien.

It‚Äôs very early; but Albon will probably be at least equal or very very close to Sainz. Obvs it his first quali session, but rarely did drivers close such a deficit over a season and then gain it on top. 

I‚Äôm genuinely starting to think Max might have spoken the truth when he said in 2020 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 2 tenths faster than anyone else‚Äù.  And that ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù included the likes of prime or at least very close to prime Hamilton.

I haven‚Äôt seen this level of domination since Schumacher in the 90‚Äôs. Just levels above everyone. That generation was also made to look bad by him, because great drivers like Barrichello or Irvine who beat almost all of their other teammates, including legends of the 80‚Äôs but also future talents(hell, old Rubens was matching a prime Jensen Button; who wasn‚Äôt that far off Lewis) were absolutely demolished by Schumacher. And the media couldn‚Äôt accept Schumacher was that much better than everyone else, so the entire generation was just deemed weak.

I think Max at this point has the same effect, however this generation is more proven because we‚Äôll have direct comparison between Leclerc-Vettel, Norris-Ricciardo, Russell-Lewis,  Leclerc-Lewis, Albon-Sainz etc.

","[""Probably a mix of both. Max is an all time great calibre of driver but also the car is very difficult to find a balance with that gives the driver confidence. Max can live with that, his teammates haven't been able to and it widens the gap between them.\n\nIf the car was more compliant his teammates would be closer. I remember an interview with Irvine talking about his time at Ferrari and he said every year the car got a little bit easier to drive and he'd get a little bit closer to Michael."", 'Max is Schumacher level. But to be honest, I was never that impressed by Lawson so I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be any closer to Max than Checo was.', ""It's both. \n\nLike with Schumacher I think there is a gap between Verstappen and the rest of the field. \n\nThe Red Bull is also extremely sensitive and it's appears pretty much impossible for anyone but a driver as attuned to sensitivity as Verstappen to drive the car at 100%."", 'It has been one (1) qualifying session', ""Lawson's last lap in quali was awful, full of mistakes. There's no way that he is that bad in the car, I've never seen him doing similar things in RB. I'm pretty sure the car is pretty much undrivable for everyone except for Max. \nThat said, Max is a beast and he would probably beat everyone as his teammate even with an easier car to drive."", 'No doubt Max is one of the most talented out there, but Lawson‚Äôs session wasn‚Äôt reflective at all - he made a lot of mistakes on a track that punishes. \n\nHe‚Äôs unlikely to beat max but the difference isn‚Äôt quite what we saw this weekend so far.', 'There are still people who underestimate how great Max really is.', ""Max is one of the best drivers to ever do it.\n\nI have no doubts that you could put anyone in the 2nd seat currently and Max would come out ahead.\n\nHowever, drivers like Gasly, Albon, Perez and now Lawson? They're not top drivers, so it's not exactly a big surprise that they are lagging behind Max. OK, maybe a bit too early to judge Lawson, but.... having followed his career for years, he's not really given the impression that he's a top driver. And Red Bull *is* a top team."", 'Of course Max is on another level but here are multiple factors to consider.\nLawson is new at RB, it‚Äôs his first full season, his teammate is the current four time world champion and Max apparently has gotten all the upgrades.\nI wouldn‚Äôt read too much into it.']",1463,705,0.89,1463,440,440,138,29,0.010000000000000009,138

Also Hadjar was seven tenths quicker than Lawson in Q1 and Tsunoda was 8 tenths faster in Q1. Comsidering the gap between Lawson and Tsunoda was not that big last year when they were team mates it surely begs the question, at least in qualifying pace, is the Racing Bull faster than the Red Bull?! 
Comsidering Yuki was less than two tenths off Max you also have to wonder what time would Max out in in that machine? What he still be third? would he be lower? Could he even be better? 

Also imagine telling someone just one year ago that this is a genuine debate. What do you all think?
