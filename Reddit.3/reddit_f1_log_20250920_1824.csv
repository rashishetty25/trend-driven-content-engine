And he appeared to have the upper hand on what is now a less experienced Hadjar. I really don't understand how people keep comparing him to Lawson when he was genuinely the worst driver in a top car since Badoer in Ferrari. Yuki is just a worse Perez... like there's levels to this."", ""It's interesting to try to make claims about the qualities of the cars and drivers relative to the nearly two decades that the teams have been on the grid.   \n\n\nMany people would claim that RBR is the least able to extract performance from its second driver ever. Still, Yuki is either more experienced *or* was rated initially as having a higher ceiling than all of the past decade of drivers for the lead team that never managed a win. (I.e., Rookie and early-career Yuki seemed stronger than Kvyat when accounting for proneness to dumb incidents, and Gasly, Albon, and Lawson never had a real shot). Additionally, the car itself is rarely ever the clear fastest or even challenging for it over a weekend, with Max as an incredible confounding factor in rating performance. Nevertheless, a driver able to consistently stay 2-3 positions behind Max would have them a clear second in the championship, which is better than most years of the team's history. \n\nThe Racing Bulls sit at 7th in the constructors' championship, in the midst of a very tight 6-8 and abnormally close 5-9 when the whole field is incredibly tight. Two mediocre drivers could fly completely under the radar if they only occasionally made it into Q3 as long as they weren't under constant threat of Q1 exits. However, Hadjar has had incredible qualifying form, having made only one Q1 exit and taking 16 races to do so. Lawson bounced back to have strong mid-season form after falling short of optimistic expectations in his shock promotion to Red Bull. \n\nGiven that AlphaTauri finished 7th and 6th in 2020 and 2021 when Gasly was paired respectively with Kvyat and Tsunoda, and Toro Rosso recorded sixth-place finishes in 2008 with the Sebs and 2019 while primarily driven to the points by Gasly and Kvyat--all more experienced pairings than the current duo--I think there's a strong case to be made that Lawson and especially Hadjar are proving to be some of the strongest young drivers the team has had. Now, measuring by peak qualifying result in a rain-affected session is deeply flawed, but this is just one of the many statistics that tell us how impressive the Kiwi and Frenchman are!"", ""It's gonna be a long and hard road (especially with the new regulations, PU provider change and still borked wind tunnel that won't be replaced until 2027), but at least the drivers seem quite satisfied.

Some of the track indicators seem to be in run off areas, while the driver would be looking at the corner, i.e. where they want to aim.

Race control would control the indicator and track position could be used to determine if it applies to that sector. Could also be used for blue flags etc. in the race.

","[""Thanks for posting this, really valuable when we didn't get the clear Q3 comparisons we usually get. McLaren seem to still have good pace, Piastri would be kicking himself for the crash if not for Lando also failing to put in a decent final lap. \n\nTomorrow probably either they both fairly easily overtake on the start-finish but fail to catch Verstappen or they get stuck in traffic with DRS unable to make up the time lost in the 90 degree turns. Both scenarios Piastri can be very happy with, any weekend where Lando gets reduced points from finishing down the grid is more or less a win for him if he keeps it on track himself.

""The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 27 (Nico Hulkenberg), team representative and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry, and in-car video evidence. Car 44 ran off at Turn 1. A yellow flag was waived at Turn 1 as Car 27 approached.  After the turn, Car 27 overtook Car 44, which was travelling at a significantly slower speed than Car 27, prior to the green light displayed between Turns 1 and 2.  This all occurred after the chequered flag had been displayed. The driver of Car 27 advised that he could not see the yellow flag because it was displayed after he began turning into the apex of Turn 1.  He then could not see the green panel because it was obstructed by Car 44 in front so he had no idea until he passed Car 44 that he was in a yellow flag area."" 

So are they supposed to come to an stop during a yellow flag now? Yes i know the flag rules no overtaking and so on, but it has always been a difference between overtaking an car that drives the same speed as you vs overtaking the one who caused the flag in the first place. And the same with the case from yesterday with Piastri, where there was a splitt second momentary yellow but he didn't slowed down while seeing the green light.
