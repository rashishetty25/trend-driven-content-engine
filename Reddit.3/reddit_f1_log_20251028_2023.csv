1ohqr5i,"[F1] Total domination in Mexico. Lando Norris won by the biggest winning margin we've seen this season so far, over half a minute up the road!",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohqr5i/f1_total_domination_in_mexico_lando_norris_won_by/,2025-10-27, Social Media,,"['For the curious minds, this is the list of biggest gaps since 2000:\n\n\n1 Lewis Hamilton, British Grand Prix 2008, 68.577 sec.\n\n\n2 Juan Pablo Montoya, German Grand Prix 2003, 65.459\n\n\n3 Lewis Hamilton, Russian Grand Prix 2021, 53.271\n\n4 Ralf Schumacher, German Grand Prix 2001, 46.117\n\n5 Michael Schumacher, Spanish Grand Prix 2001, 40.738\n\n6 Michael Schumacher, Brazilian Grand Prix 2000, 39.898\n\n7 Ralf Schumacher, Malaysian Grand Prix 2002, 39.700\n\n8 Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, Malaysian Grand Prix 2003, 39.286\n\n9 Nico Rosberg l, Chinese Grand Prix 2016, 37.776\n\n10 Max Verstappen, Styrian Grand Prix 2021, 35.743', 'Itâ€™s also his third time converting pole to win while leading every lap, but still missing out on a grand slam because of the fastest lap. Kind of funny since i feel like leading every lap is more rare than getting the fastest lap. \n\n(in fairness once everyone started two-stopping he didnâ€™t stand a chance to get the FL, his first two instances of missing out on a grand slam were a lot closer where he was only denied by 1-2 people at the very end back when the fastest lap point still existed)', 'Very impressive performance by Lando. He delivered when it mattered', 'People can say what they want but he really executed this weekend to perfection from start to finish. Most dominant display weâ€™ve seen from the mclaren drivers this year', ""This was Lando's most mature and controlled race. He was the fastest all weekend, executed the strategy, and won handily. While I'm not sure if this is a sign of a new and improved Lando, he did what he needed to keep fighting for the championship in the face of a rejuvenated Max, and a depleted Piastri. Who knows what next week will bring, but this is now a proper 3-way battle!"", 'I mean a perfect weekend domination in quali no-one was close enough into turn 1 which is kinda a crazy good start and then dissapeared for the rest of sunday', 'That first stint on the softs was magical from him. Insanely consistent. I remember during the race many low 1.22s close to each other. Even knowing his starts are not his strongest point and Mexico being such a long straight, after qualy I felt very confident in Norris winning the race. When he is locked in its so fun to watch', 'Championship drive from Lando', ""When Norris is on it, he just doesn't look back, like he did in Abu Dhabi 2024 despite the pressure or when he got his first podium even, in 2019 !"", 'The second winning winning margin of the ground effect era. Say what you want about these regulations, but there were 2 races in 2021 with 30+ second winning margins and 2 races from 2022-2025 with 30+ second winning margins.']",1345,125,0.91,1345,3309,3309,28,0,0.0,28
1ohyali,Gabi on Ollie finishing P4: â€˜That was very niceâ€™,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohyali/gabi_on_ollie_finishing_p4_that_was_very_nice/,2025-10-28, Video,,"['What a wholesome guy, always seems happy when others succeed', 'â€˜Not for our championshipâ€™ \n\nI like that he had to remind him of that haha.

He cited Max and Bearman as the people he is close with and hangs out outside the track. But his reaction to Hulk's podium and radio was very sweet. Gabi seems like a very nice guy."", ""Eh, Doohan and Colapinto both I'm not impressed by, compared to the others at least. They're not the worst in recent years by any means, just not as good. But perhaps it's being warped by the Alpine being an absolute dogboat.\n\nLawson also has a rough spot, but since he's been in the AlphaTauri he's kept up decently with Hadjar imo. Kimi is up against one of the strongest drivers on the grid in a car that, I think, is quite hard to understand how to optimally drive it (not as bad as the RB, but the Merc is a weird car), and he has shown flashes of real good stuff.\n\nHadjar obviously has the podium and, aside from the Straya formation lap, has impressed me the most. Bearman is getting more comfortable with the Haas and it's showing, I think in recent races he's done better than Ocon. Gabi is perhaps not getting as many points as his teammate, but he's beating Hulk in quali this season, right? Which I think speaks volumes that he's good, even if Hulk is having a (to his standards) poor qualifying season."", ""Franco said Gaby was his closest friend in the grid the other day but maybe the feeling isn't mutual lmao""]",290,13,0.96,290,312,312,10,0,0.010000000000000009,10
