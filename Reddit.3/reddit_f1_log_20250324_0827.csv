We drain fuel and replace broken parts before weigh in, but don't account for tires?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ji73ly/why_are_cars_weighed_with_their_tires_we_drain/,2025-03-23, Discussion,"I was bothered by this last time when George got DSQed and its bothering me now too.

Do the current rules mean that every team is doing an estimate of how much rubber they will lose through a race and add some extra weight in their car? So if Ferrari's estimate is 500 grams and Mercedes's estimate is 700 grams, both cars start the race at different weights just because they estimate different tire wear?

Does it also mean that you have to add extra weight, just in case you want to go long on the same tire set in the end? So if you stay 30 laps on the same tires, you're legal, but if you stay out another 10 laps, suddenly you're not?

Does it also mean that a severe lockup or two during an intense battle can make your otherwise legal car illegal?

When someone crashes or has damage, we account for this weight loss by mounting a new part before weighing them or weighing them with the debris. I'm fairly sure the fuel also gets drained to account for different fuel use between cars. So why don't we account for tire loss when different cars will have different tire wear + drivers pick up different amounts of rubber marbles on their cooldown lap?

I understand why we can't remove the tires every time we use the weigh bridge in-session, but at the end of a race, we absolutely can afford to remove the tires and weigh the cars without them. So why don't we?

This feels really strange for a sport where we claim every gram matters... yet the weight of cars all over the grid can vary massively just on their estimate of how much tire they'll lose and also based on whether they stay long or not.","['The minimum of 800kg is car + minimum possible tyre weight when completely worn. So in any case a car is found to be underweight it‚Äôs the team‚Äôs fault.', ""> both cars start the race at different weights just because they estimate different tire wear?  \n  \nOr to read it another way - the team failed to consider their minimum weight based on their chosen strategies. They could have installed half a kg of extra ballast and they'd be fine.  \n  \nThe core rule is that car dry weight at any time during the competition shouldn't be below the set weight. This includes consideration of wear and tear components, including PU, tires or plank wear.  \n  \nOnly accidental damage can be replaced with equal specification equipment.

But over the last few years it's become evident that they do, at the very minimum, see quite a bit of the social media comments and reactions to anything surrounding F1. Particularly when it comes to anything having to do with drivers. The most recent example of this being the current situation with Liam Lawson who is only 2 races into this season with people calling for him to be replaced by Yuki Tsunoda. And it seems that this motion is starting to gain traction. I don't know if this is naive or not but it doesn't seem fair to Liam that people who aren't in the team or who race the car should be able to put pressure on his team to replace him. I feel like as a young driver he should be allowed to develop like drivers are supposed to. And part of me has been wondering how much of that pressure to make changes it influenced or exacerbated by social media.

1jhxng3,Verstappen's Future,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jhxng3/verstappens_future/,2025-03-23, Discussion,"So it's pretty clear now that Red Bull is not super competitive, as of today in basically a three-way tie for 2nd/3rd/4th place in the WDC, and already a long way back in the WCC to McLaren and Merc. 

Max Verstappen is unhappy with his car's pace - and quite vocal about it - and probably has a decision to make for 2026, when the new rules kick in.

Technically, he has a contract until 2028, but contracts can be bought out; when the driver doesn't want to be there it's only a question of how much someone else will pay Red Bull to get hold of him, and how much Red Bull will ask to release him.

With that in mind, you have to be looking at teams who can afford Max, and that leads you to 5 candidates: McLaren, Mercedes, Ferrari, Audi and Aston Martin. Williams, Haas, Alpine, Cadillac and VCARB are all too cheap, too new, or too weak to be attractive.

McLaren could/would dump a driver to get Max, and they could probably afford him with their 2024 and 2025 prize money. Their engineering team has surmounted Red Bull in three seasons now under Andrea Stella, with two comebacks mid-season and then this one starting good out do the box. It's interesting that Zak Brown picks on Horner/Red Bull and not Max directly in his stirring and chirping.

Mercedes would dump George for Max for sure, and maybe Kimi if he doesn't perform. And the signature PR alone would be worth the price for Merc. The issue is if they can produce a winning car again, although it's arguable that Russell's car in Max's hands would be finishing higher already.

Ferrari might make a tough decision about Leclerc, who, despite several seasons, and fast single laps, just seems to be behind the curve. Blame the team, sure, but that car was a race winner, a pole sitter, and with Max and Lewis driving, Vasseur in charge and Ferrari money you have no excuses any more.

Aston Martin, with Stroll's cash, is an obvious avenue, with Alonso retiring and Lance clearly staying in Seat #2. It might be attractive, esp. with Newey in his new role, and you can bet they would pull more sponsors with Max on board to pay his fees. But they never seem to live up to the promise of the money being deployed.

Audi is a dark horse, but they could pay the bill and Audi has a formidable Le Mans prototype pedigree, so betting against them being a force at some future point is a losing game. The only question is whether Max would be attracted by a new, unproven package so early on, and I would guess not.

So does Max think Red Bull has the chops to deliver a winning car for the next 3 years in the new regs? Or has he lost faith, and is ready to jump ship?

On current results I think Zak Brown is right: he's ready for a change, and he will be off, maybe signing something as  soon as mid-season this year.
","['Max was questioned on this after the race and basically seemed not too worried and was pretty content with how his life is in and out of the sport.', ""It's 2 races in, his car apparently sucks and he's still 2nd in the WDC, I think maybe it's a bit premature to even have this thread."", 'Hello.
