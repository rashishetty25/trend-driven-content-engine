1p9bb0s,Pirelli hasn't learned a thing from past experiences,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p9bb0s/pirelli_hasnt_learned_a_thing_from_past/,2025-11-29, Discussion,"2023 we had tyre issues caused by tyre construction 
2024 we had tyre issues caused by tyre construction 
And now 2025 we are having the same old repeat.
In 2 years they haven't learned a thing.
At some point you gotta question maybe it's time to either delay the homologation to account for final races or have measure in place to address the issues with mid season changes.
That's the only excuse I can come up with this mess caused by Pirelli incompetance. They are forcing teams to run 25 laps stint because they don't want a failure which is a side affect of having a single tyre supplier that they become complicit in innovation and pushing the boundaries. In 4 years of these new tyres we haven't really had any serious improvements nor have we learned from the mistakes. They have continued to fail in making the racing exciting with the failed C6 tyre which is going to be axed for 2026 and they have failed to fix the issue of tyre construction seen in Qatar. FIA has got all the data that Pirelli could need regarding gravel being used and the curbs being used because they are all FIA grades certified. But still we running into the same old problem. 
F1 should really look into opening up the grid to at least 1 more tyre supplier because the argument of costs doesn't hold up when you consider the fact we have got systems in place to regulate tyre suppliers and cost caps. They could treat them as a option for all teams and regulate the suppliers ensuring they are like what Pirelli is now. It would be like different brake suppliers but obviously much more integral to car performance.
This would at least mean that we have motivates for each supplier to do there best and we could see real push for innovation with tyre suppliers having a benchmark in form of other suppliers.
I am not saying we need to regulate it but we do need to offer a option for all teams.
We can a small set of rules for tyre suppliers basically along the geometrical shape limits for car design consistency and ensure that the tyres are easily interchangable. Maybe in 2000s it didn't work well but with current set of regulations and also mechanism on a sporting level we could make it work. Something to also add is that last Pirelli initially blamed debris for tyre punctures it's interesting to see how they have change the notion coming to this week and also I didn't mention that they had 2021 even though even they had tyre failures because they were different construction also the curbs that are used are something FIA has certified so clearly something that is not track's issue but a fundamental flaw that hasn't changed for Pirelli","[""I aint reading that wall. What's the tl;dr"", 'Good lord OP, learn to use paragraphs!', ""Fuck me mate. Learn to write a coherent post.   \n  \nI did not read it all, but I'm pretty sure these tires are made to exactly what is wanted. They're not made to just be the best and last a whole race.

Many people blamed specific debris last year because it was an easy conclusion from just watching the race. But the cause was identified to be very high wear, which makes the tyre vulnerable to all sorts of things. \n\n2021 was a different track. Literally. They reworked the track between then and 2023, and it was classified as a new track in 2023. The rework included a new surface and a change of curbs.\n\n  \nAlso, try this paragraph thing, please."", 'I just wanted to point out that the current Pirelli F1 tires might be the most stressed racing tire of all time, certainly in F1.

The last thing F1 needs is a tyre war. \n\nWe've finally got a close grid with teams well matched at least on the car engineering side, leaving the question open on engine performance next year. I for one do not want to add a question about the best tyre supplier to that equation. \n\nFact is, very few people care about innovation or pushing the boundaries when it comes to tyre technology. The Pirelli tyres are more or less fine - if there are some restrictions at the Qatar GP, so be it, its not a big deal.\n\nIf a Ferrari finally wins a title, it ought to be because they were the strongest team, not because Bridgestone has a team at Maranello customizing their development for the SF26."", ""Were you a small yappy dog in a previous life?
