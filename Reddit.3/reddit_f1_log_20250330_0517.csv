1jmx3fa,Hauger to Cadillac F1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jmx3fa/hauger_to_cadillac_f1/,2025-03-29, Discussion,"This post is only to start a conversation for fun about the topic of Dennis Hauger to F1. He had a really good formula series career, but I think he was incredibly unlucky with a lot of his Formula 2 racing which sadly put him a bit off the market. He‚Äôs now in Indy NXT and off to a great start with Andretti. 

If he does well in Indy NXT, could he potentially be a rookie for the new team of Cadillac F1 paired with another veteran driver? What do we think? ","['I think there are far better drivers who will be miles ahead of him in any conversation.', ""I think first choice Herta if he gets a super license, second choice Crawford if he gets a license. After that, I'm less sure that there's a plan, so it's more open. As someone pointed out, he's likely to replace Herta in Andretti if Herta gets his license, so that would be a really great thing for Hauger. IndyCar is an excellent career."", 'I love IndyCar but ‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt go directly from NXT to F1. Palou probably isn‚Äôt going to get into F1 even if he wins 4 IndyCar titles in 5 years.', 'Let me put it this way:\n\nDennis Hauger would make a fantastic reserve driver for Cadillac F1.  He could really help the team in that role, and it would be a deserved promotion for him.', 'He should probably just focus on Indy now. He can have a good career over there. I think the F1 ship has sailed.', ""He didn't really impress that much in Formula 2. He had a good run in Formula 3 and Formula 4, but he never finished higher than eighth in Formula 2. And while he absolutely dominated the St Petersburg round in Indycar NXT, it's also the only race that he's done. On top of that, the Dallara IL-15 chassis used by Indycar NXT is a decade old at this point, and is significantly less powerful than the F2 2018 and F2 2024 chassis Hauger was racing in Formula 2.\n\nIf Cadillac are looking to take on a rookie, then I imagine that they'll either go for an American or take Dino Beganovic as part of a deal with Ferrari."", 'Hauger is off to replace Herta at Andretti', 'He is not going to end up down in NXT to then find himself at Cadillac next year lol.', 'no chance. if he didnt do well in indy NXT id be worried lol.']",0,40,0.31,0,36,36,0,1,-0.030000000000000027,0
