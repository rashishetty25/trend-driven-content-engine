Is there a reason why they couldn't put a decent size RGB led indicator into the halo, so the driver you see it in their line of sight? TV showed the indicator on the steering wheel and it is tiny. Some of the track indicators seem to be in run off areas, while the driver would be looking at the corner, i.e. where they want to aim.

Race control would control the indicator and track position could be used to determine if it applies to that sector. Could also be used for blue flags etc. in the race.

Is this a stupid idea? ","['Steering wheel might be tiny from onboard camera but it is literally in front of driver’s eyes. Halo device is above driver’s head and not sure if that would be visible for them.\nFormula E has leds on halo but they are using it to show who is using boost, or energy modes.', 'i cant say for sure but I think its probably easier for them to see an off board yellow flag than an on board one when they are focusing past the halo onto the track. i think the amount of infringements is more a function of it being a fast street circuit. they could just enlarge the existing flag lights for baku, this doesnt seem to be a big problem elsewhere.', ""I was thinking the same after Colapinto crashed just now, and Palmer was talking about how he must've not seen the yellow already from Gasly going off. To me, it looked like the flag was straightened by the wind, showing very little surface area towards Colapinto.\n\nSeeing as flags behave differently with different winds, I think a better system could surely be invented."", 'Their entire wheel screen flashes the flag at them. There is *no* excuse.', ""Teams can make the light bigger / more prominent if they feel it'll improve their chances of not getting a penalty...."", 'Making the flag a bit more stiff could also help', ""The various flags, and how to respond to them, are the first thing any racing driver at any level learns. These days drivers also have the light panels and the in-car LEDs, but even if only the physical flag is present a driver is expected to react accordingly. Any driver that can't manage that has no business being anywhere near a race car, let alone Formula 1."", ""Don't they get flag alerts on the steering wheel anymore?\xa0"", 'Why can’t they just say yellow flag or red flag over the radio?', 'I get it that the top of the halo would be out of their eyeline, but the middle vertical is in front of them. I know that it kind of disappears from your view, like you can ""see through"" your finger if you hold it in front of your eyes. No need to have green lit all the time, except when changing back to normal racing conditions.\n\nSteering wheel is the obvious location, but seems real estate is limited.']",27,14,0.75,27,14,14,11,7,0.010000000000000009,11
