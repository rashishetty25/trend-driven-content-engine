So instead of trying to fix the race with things like 2 mandatory pit stops, why not double down on the part of the weekend everyone actually likes?\n\nI think the Monaco GP should become a time attack event instead of a race. Move FP1+2 to Saturday, skip FP3, and have an extra-long qualifying session in the race's time slot. Use a similar elimination format to normal qualifying sessions (maybe with 5 rounds instead of 3?) and award points using the same system as the races (ie.  25 for pole, 18 for 2nd, etc). The finishing order of the race is mostly determined by qualifying anyway, so this is just cutting out the middleman."", ""McLaren did relatively well this weekend, Norris did what he had to do to salvage points for the weekend. What a stellar drive. I wouldn't say he was faultless but his drive essentially gave him the victory. The qualifying lap was also worth shouting out as well, though. While I do feel like I am unable to tell how this speaks for Norris's future qualifying sessions considering this is rather track-specific, and the TD *(which shouldn't affect them, per their statement but i'll watch closely either way)* is arriving next week, this is what was needed for the weekend \n\nI say that because as much as the race was still somewhat loose by the seams in turns of entertainment value, it takes a different kind of approach to ensure that you stay afloat in Monaco. With attention to all drivers in this regard, I doubt it is as easy it looks. Verstappen did what he had to do, as a competitor, by bunching up the field, leaving Norris to the pressure cooker that is by ensuring Leclerc stays behind and ensuring nothing happens to warrant a crash. Yes, Leclerc wasn't going to get past him *(in looks to the radio that Norris was slow, now we know it's because he was bunched up)* but that is the challenge, innit? I imagine that keeping your head on your shoulders while remaining patient and focused are part of the parcel of being a well-rounded driver, and if you rise up to the task, then hell yeah!\n\nI want to show my appreciation for Piastri too. While this is not the best of weekends for him, he kept it consistent, slightly playing defense towards the end, and he brought the podium back to Woking. Like I said, it may sound pedantic to suggest otherwise, but it is easy to get it wrong in Monaco if you are not careful, so the fact he kept it solid was good! \n\nChampionship gap's getting narrower once more. To that, I say, I commend both the McLaren boys in keeping respectful while pushing each other in the pursuit of maximizing the results. I'll repeat myself: this team has an amazing driver line-up in their hands with two fantastic and talented drivers in their own regard. I'll speak for myself here but it is easy to forget that this is such when title battles are at play, and at the end of it all, if there is a show for a tussle and it is all under good strides, then I'm probably the biggest winner of them all"", 'Just posted this in another thread but I wanna hear what people think\n\nOne thought I had during the Williams/Mercedes debacle: when Antonelli went straight through the chicane and passed Albon, what was stopping him from simply staying ahead, taking a penalty, and backing up the field while Russell served his drive through and pitted twice?

Verstappen would still struggle because he's not an Oval Racer, but I think his open wheel experience and skills would translate to a similar or slightly better level of success than Kyle if he ran the 500. He'd also figure out how to make the car go fast on NASCAR road courses and in qualifying (all F1 drivers who swap out for stock cars do), but NASCAR is a contact sport in both driver aggression levels and in etiquette. Open-wheel drivers struggle with that aspect (unless he catches a perfect storm like SVG did on a road or street course, but even SVG has a lot more experience with contact). He'd struggle mightily in oval racing in a one-off, that requires a lot more in-car experience.\n\nKyle likes a dangerously loose race car, I don't think he'd do well in F1 because he'd lose the handle on it and hit something.

So I'm well aware that Imola has now dropped off the calendar but I still think about how the circuit could be improved. We did see some overtaking this year which was great but, still feel more could be done.

As Imola is surrounded by either river or buildings there's not much you can do making massive layout changes, there are also buildings and sports facilities on the inside of the circuit to consider as well.

My main suggestion is to remove the Variante Alta Chicane entirely to provide a nice straight from Acqua Minerali to the first Rivazza. This chicane seems a bit out of place these days and I don't think removing it would take the essence of the circuit away, whilst improving the racing.

I also feel that modifying the Rivazzas to provide a heavy braking zone for cars approaching the twin corners should be considered but even leaving them as they are should still provide an extra opportunity to overtake with Variante Alta gone.

What are your thoughts?","['The tracks are fine, just make the cars smaller and lighter and the racing will improve a lot', ""Imola is gone. No point talking about it.

All that F1 would need to do is to create a Monaco specific PU rule which is to disallow using any battery in the GP, *except* for when you're the car behind and using manual override.

Since it's significantly more powerful than DRS with hundreds of horsepower of an advantage over a car not using any energy and could be activated anywhere, I could see it being possible to line up a move on the pit straight or into the chicane.

I'm far from the first person to say that f1 has outgrown Monaco, however I think the situation is also made worse by the lack of changes that Monaco has made in order to try and improve racing over the years. I personally don't want, and don't think that Monaco would be removed from the F1 calendar as it is too much of a world event for the super wealthy. So I think it's best to make good use of a bad situation and try and improve the track to promote more interesting racing for us plebs to enjoy.

These are some of the changes that I would make to the Monaco circuit in order to try and improve the track. Along with this, I'd want the ""straight"" up the hill after t1 to be actually somewhat straight by either raising the track or lowering the pavement on either side of the road. Allowing cars to possibly enter into Massenet side by side. 

  
My first real change would be to add a small chicane in the casino square or some other sort of complex, currently there is a fountain in this area, however it was only added in late 2019 / early 2020. I don't know how much this will affect racing as cars would have to be very close coming up the hill, I hope the changes to the hill I mentioned would allow for cars to be closer entering this complex. 

Next I'd do something which I've seen suggested a few times before, and I believe to be a decent idea, which is to turn left after Meribau and turn around the roundabout, this would not only allow for drivers to try and take varying lines around the long right-hander, it would also extend the straight between what would be portier and the Villeneuve chicane, possibly allowing drivers to be closer in order to attempt a pass into said chicane

  
Another change would be to make use of the space currently used by grandstands after the swimming pool, I'd remove the horrid and clunky chicane currently there and smooth it, then add a different style of chicane heading into La Rasecasse. After Rasecasse I'd remove Anthony Noghes which currently makes passing on the pit straight much more challenging, and swap it for a sweeping right hand turn similar to how it was pre-1976. This would allow cars to reach higher top speeds along the main straight, thus making DRS / slipstream more effective.

1kw7b69,Why do people think Alonso is washed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kw7b69/why_do_people_think_alonso_is_washed/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"I keep seeing the narrative that Alonso is washed yet if anything he is better than he was in 2023, where he was voted second best driver of the year by team principles - the car is just worse now. His pace gap in qualifying to Stroll is around 4 tenths, slightly larger than in pervious years together. He hasnt been outqualified since halfway through last year, and I genuinely struggle to remember when he has been outright slower than Stroll without some kind of external reason like floor damage in the entire time they've been teammates. 

The idea that he makes more mistakes is potentially only true when comparing to his absolute peak in 2011-2014 but he has actually made very few genuine mistakes this year and has generally just been very unlucky. Australia has the caveat of the huge amount of gravel on track and the only real mistake was a spin while running 15th in Miami. 

Most people who argue he is washed say that he simply has a bad benchmark, however I would say he has a particularly good benchmark as Stroll was teammates to Massa, Alonos longest standing teammate, and the pace gaps are very coherent when compared, with Massa generally slightly closer to Alonso in his prime years (around 3 tenths) whereas Massa and Stroll were quite evenly matched together, despite Stroll being new to the sport.

GR is great, and honestly I don’t think race pace, mistakes, (like losing the lead at the sprint) or even crashes are worrying, but it’s the raw pace that he has yet to show. In my understanding, speed is mostly not taught, and most great drivers become competitive in qualifying just about immediately.

He also lost the lead to drivers like Piastri, Verstappen, Norris - so not fair to judge on that.\n\nComparing Hadjar & Antonelli's H2H is also not fair, Lawson doesn't even have a full season yet and not on the level of GR who is on his 4th season in Mercedes.""]",0,114,0.2,0,1084,1084,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
