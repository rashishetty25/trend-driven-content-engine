1nk0ptg,FIA president opens door for Russia’s return to Formula 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nk0ptg/fia_president_opens_door_for_russias_return_to/,2025-09-18, News,"The president of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), Mohammed Ben Sulayem, has opened the door for Russia to return as a Formula 1 host.
“We don’t mix religion and politics into our choices,” he said.

In early March 2022, Formula 1 announced that the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi was canceled.
“That means Russia will not host any races in the future,” F1 said in a statement at the time.

When FIA president Ben Sulayem met Swedish media during a conference on online hate in Stockholm, he gave no direct answer on whether Russia might rejoin the calendar — but did not rule it out.
“There’s a difference between the commercial side of Formula 1 and motorsport. And we must follow the Olympic Committee’s guidelines, we respect them. But let’s hope. Do you think the war will last forever? I don’t hope so,” he told TT.

He emphasized that excluding Russia had not been his decision.
“Russia was a commercial decision. It wasn’t FIA that made it. To be clear, it was FOM (Formula One Management) that didn’t want to race there, and there was pressure on FIA to take a stand against Russia.”

The Russian motorsport federation remains part of the FIA, and Russian drivers are allowed to compete under a neutral flag. Ben Sulayem stressed that he has no mandate to exclude the country.
“I will not break the rules for anyone. When it suits them, people love democracy, but democracy has two sides, and when the other side appears, it’s not as popular,” he said.

“Of course we think about safety”

One race that was not canceled took place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in March 2022, when an oil depot 16 kilometers from the circuit was attacked during the same weekend as a Formula 1 race. BBC and Sky Sports reported that teams and drivers felt pressured to take part — a description Ben Sulayem rejects.
“We never forced drivers to race in Saudi Arabia. They had a choice, and they had a long meeting. We said: ‘If you want to leave, leave. We’ll take you to the airport.’ But no one wanted to go.”

This year, the penultimate race of the season will be held in Doha, Qatar — which suffered an Israeli airstrike just hours after this interview.
“Of course we think about safety, but we don’t mix in religion and politics. It’s written in our rules. We think about people and about motorsport,” said Ben Sulayem.
“When we build our foundation for choosing a venue, we do so together with our event organizers. We will never take our people to a dangerous place where we see a threat to them.”

“If we start poking at every country”

FIA has long faced criticism for holding races in countries with severe human rights shortcomings, including Bahrain, Azerbaijan, and Saudi Arabia — three states with serious press freedom restrictions according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF).

Ben Sulayem does not see that as a reason to strike the races from the calendar.
“They have press freedom, but the media also needs to understand that you can’t go to countries and just fabricate news. You have to respect them,” he said, even though five of the races on the 2026 calendar are in countries ranked by RSF as having no press freedom at all.

He argued that problems exist in many places.
“If we start poking at every country and say: ‘I won’t go there because of this, or because of that.’ Then maybe we should all just go back to Sweden — then we can have everything,” Ben Sulayem said.

The next Formula 1 race takes place in Baku, Azerbaijan, on September 21.

Mohammed Ben Sulayem
Mohammed Ben Sulayem, born November 12, 1961, in Dubai, is president of the FIA and a former rally driver.
He was elected FIA president in December 2021, after serving as vice president since 2008.

His leadership has been criticized, including allegations of sexism and attempts to silence dissenting voices and restrict drivers’ freedom of expression.
“Just because media, from another country, accuse someone of something, we’re not going to follow that,” Ben Sulayem said.
“I don’t care what people think. I only care about the future of the sport,” he added in response to the criticism.

In the upcoming election for the FIA presidency on December 12, he will face Tim Mayer.

2014 grid is,

Mercedes - Sebastian/Nico
Ferrari - Fernando/Kimi
McLaren - Jenson/Lewis

I see it going something like this, Vettel doesn't initially gel at Merc so Rosberg wins his first championship 2 years earlier than real life. Lewis wants out of McLaren, due to them being woefully uncompetitive, and with Fernando's relationship with Ferrari deteriorating this means a seat swap happens.

2015 and 2016 grid is,

Mercedes - Vettel/Rosberg
Ferrari - Hamilton/Raikonnen
McLaren - Alonso/Button 

I can see Vettel winning the 2015 season, he was outstanding in real life that year and I can see this upsetting Nico to the point where 2016 playsout much the same. With Rosberg winning the championship and retiring as a 2x F1 champion.

This is where I'm going to ask the question, what do you think will happen from here. The driver market is the sane as real life with Button retiring, with Stoffel replacing him, and Bottas going to Merc as Nicos replacement.
