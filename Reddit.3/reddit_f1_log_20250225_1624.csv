It's hilarious how we always talk about how international the sport is (It is!) but we can't comprehend that the audiences at the tracks or events are still mostly local. It's the same in every other sport when playing away matches."", ""F1 is as soft as blue cheese. \n\nEvery major sport has booing. Deal with it. \n\nPeople play villains and heroes. Everyone wants that DTS fame but somehow wants to avoid the tropes that come with general audience fame. Can't have it both ways. \n\nGo spend 5 minutes on a pitch and then come back with your pearls clutched. Or even less time at a hockey rink. Verbal war crimes are old news."", 'It‚Äôs interesting whenever Max gets booed it‚Äôs the biggest problem in the world. Schumi/Vettel/Hamilton all were at the receiving ends of boos at one point or another it‚Äôs simply part and parcel of domination.
