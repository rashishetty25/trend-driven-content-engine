1lfk2bl,The Vettel effect theory.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lfk2bl/the_vettel_effect_theory/,2025-06-19, Discussion,"  
Before downvoting, note this is just a speculative discussion not a claim of absolute truth.

  
**TLDR:** Vettel‚Äôs peak was surprisingly short, his driving style was only perfectly suited to the V8 era. When the turbo-hybrid regulations arrived in 2014, he declined massively and this accidentally inflated the reputations of drivers like Ricciardo, Norris, and Leclerc.

**Vettel** had no wins in 2014, the car was not the best but still fast. His performance at Ferrari was inconsistent, and against Stroll he was very similar to Perez (both scored around 65% of team points).

When **Ricciardo** joined Red Bull in 2014 (beginning of turbo-hybrid) Vettel was a 4x WDC but not a top driver anymore, still Daniel's stock grew exponentially . Ricciardo did well in RB, but was outperformed by a teenage Verstappen (for context Max entered F1 at 17 Hamilton at 22).

  Ricciardo‚Äôs reputation stayed very high, so naturally when **Norris** destoroyed him, Norris became one of the hot shots of F1.

  With **Leclerc** I will be careful, he is undeniably fast, and he does look stronger than 40-year-old Hamilton now. But was his early reputation also boosted by beating a fading Vettel?

*Bonus Conspiracy Angle:* Lawrence Stroll knew about  the Vettel effect and signed him to Aston Martin to make Lance look better.



Q: Without Vettel would we rate Ricciardo, Norris, and Leclerc differently?","[""2015 is one of Vettel's strongest seasons and ruins your argument from the get go.\n\nVettel was also really good in 2017 and ultimately lost the title on a series of 4 coinflips those being the Silverstone tire failure, Singapore start calamity, Japan spark plug failure and Malaysia engine failure\n\nAs for Leclerc. No his reputation was high because he was one of the best young tallents to graze the junior ladder in a while. He also backed up that tallent in F1 straight away and more than proved himself already."", 'He didn‚Äôt decline massively. He was still great until mid 2018 and even after he had skme great flashes. We can see that with the results he had. \n\nEvent in Aston Martin he was putting some great drives ala Alonso now.
