I cant remember which race it was earlier this season (maybe miami?) where oscar slowed up before the restart so hard that lando almost rammed into the back of him.', ""I said in the [post race thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lt4am5/2025_british_gp_postrace_discussion/n1o04bc/) that I thought he did the same action in both safety car restarts. From the onboard, it looks like Piastri brakes right after the astroturf on the exit of Chapel on the first safety car restart. On the second restart he slows at the bridge on the Hangar Straight. Also, the safety car ending announcement on the broadcast shows up when Piastri is going through Becketts on the first restart compared to after Piastri has exited Chapel on the second restart.\n\nEdit: I think I see why Piastri got the penalty. Using F1TV, during the first safety car, you can see the safety car lights go out right from Verstappen's onboard after Piastri passes that little astroturf on the exit of Chapel (@43:48). During the second safety car, it's very hard to see, but it looks like the lights go out on the safety car right before it goes under the bridge on the Hangar Straight (@54:04).

And to actually quote oscar ""I did what I did at the first restart, and apparently one needed a penalty and one didnt"". So I get why is oscar is very annoyed because he was led to believe by race control that what he did first time was alright, and then when he repeated the exact same thing he gets a 10 s penalty. And in my personal opinion the stewards gave him a penalty second time because for whatever reason max wasn\'t paying attention to oscar second time around and got caught out by him and that made a scene, and that scene ultimately is what got oscar the penalty.', 'Unless there was a warning after lap 17 braking, this graphic just highlights Oscar‚Äôs position and shows how inconsistent the FIA were, within the same race. \n\nI do think it was a safety concern, think it could have been handled differently.', ""I feel like this data is more in Oscar's favor."", 'I don‚Äôt know how people are seriously looking at this and calling Oscar‚Äôs driving erratic.

I see everyone is comparing George's 30 psi (in the dry) to Oscar's 60 psi (in the wet) and saying Oscar 'stopped twice as quick'. From my understanding, this is not accurate.

1lt8gv5,Piastri‚Äòs penalty undeserved?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lt8gv5/piastris_penalty_undeserved/,2025-07-06, Discussion,"Edited see below

During the race, it looked quite clear that Piastri just tried to surprise Verstappen to give him a penalty. I just had a look at the telemetry from the live timing, and it paints a different picture. 

During the first safety car, Piastri decelerated from 207 to 65 kph in 3.3 sec (3.3 sec of hard braking). Verstappen went from 219 to 75 kph in 3.5 sec, they started braking at ca. 1/5 of the straight and basically simultaneously. 

During the second SC, Piastri went from 215 to 70 kph in again ca. 3.2 sec, for Verstappen it was 221 to 60 in 3.1 sec, so similar to the first SC. But Piastri started braking at 1/2 of the straight (so quite a bit later), the key here is that Verstappen only started to break 1.5 sec after Piastri. Piastri had already decelerated to 120 kph when Verstappen reacted. 

Looking at Verstappen‚Äòs onboard also gives a bit more additional information. During the acceleration down the straight, there was a lot of spray from Piastri and the safety car, so his visibility was reduced and he received a radio call that the SC is ending. I think both of these factors have contributed to his delayed reaction, which then in turn led to a very high closing speed, which forced him to evade Piastri. That obviously looked quite extreme off-board. 

I think, given that the call for the ending SC came relatively late and then Piastri‚Äôs need to allow the SC to go into the pits and the track to go green before he hits turn 15, gave him cause to decelerate quickly. It is not his fault that Verstappen didn‚Äôt notice him braking for almost 1.5 seconds. Just to be clear, I don‚Äôt think Verstappen is at fault here either, it‚Äôs just that his delayed reaction makes Piastri‚Äòs braking look quite extreme. From Piastri‚Äôs on-board (which faces rear) his braking doesn‚Äôt seem quite so strong and it looks like Verstappen just doesn‚Äôt brake. 

We can also compare this to the Russell incident in Canada. There Russell had no cause to brake (SC not ending or other), they were at lower speeds and Russell only decelerated to ca 85 kph so not as hard braking required (Russel 30 psi vs Piastri 60 psi). Russel did not receive a penalty.

Watching the race I thought the penalty was deserved but now I think Oscar got quite unlucky with it.

Edit: I stand by the conclusions I made due to the data but I agree that he shouldn‚Äôt have braked this hard this suddenly given the conditions. But if race control has an issue with him driving this way they should have reacted the first time he did it during the first SC restart. The way it happened he thought he was in the green to do it again","['Please keep the discussion focused on the (technical) details of the incident itself.\n\nFan wars, whataboutism or hatred targeted at any team, driver or official will result in bans.', ""The braking might have seemed reasonable to OP, but to everyone piled up behind him with low visibility it wasn't. \n\nI thought he stopped on track watching it live."", 'It was reckless given the conditions and very deserved. Even Hulk in the cool down room told him how it impacted him and other drivers.', ""Piastri wasn't thinking about Verstappen at all.\n\nHe was trying to warm up his brakes and tyres. That's all. He just did it in a way that wasn't reasonable. That's all there's is to it.\n\nIt had nothing to do with Verstappen."", 'Zero question whether he deserved a penalty. 10 seconds can be argued but no penalty at all would have been bullshit, stupid from him\xa0', ""I don't think he was doing it maliciously. He knew he could get away from Verstappen very quickly. But it was still a stupid mistake.\n\nIf he'd done it maliciously I don't think he would be so angry. It's the most emotion we've seen out of him."", 'The way the rules are today it‚Äôs a penalty, harsh or not. But I think the FIA needs to look at when they call a safety call in this lap and the drivers should be asking for that. Piastri was reacting to a very late call and as such caused the situation. Had they call it before maggots/beckets then this whole incident doesn‚Äôt happen as Oscar can back off in enough time in the ‚Äúacceleration zone‚Äù of the straight. Half way down the straight is too late!', 'The fact that the safety car had been called in makes it way worse, and that is what warrants the penalty imo. That is also the reason why Russel did not get a penalty: it was during normal SC period. Not after it has been called in.\n\nThe rule is clear : \n\n"" When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car the message ‚ÄúSAFETY CAR IN THIS LAP‚Äù will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system and the car‚Äôs orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors and drivers that it \r\nwill be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.\r\nAt this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall \r\nmore than ten (10) car lengths behind it.\r\nIn order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the \r\npoint at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves \r\nno erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other \r\ndrivers or impede the restart.""\n\nPiastri was in breached of it. Russell wasn\'t. \n\nPiastri also did it under the rain, and it was a consequent breach. So they went for the harsher penalty. \n\nI honestly completely understand the logic of the steward. And comparing their decision with the Russell one doesn\'t make much sense as it is not the same rule. One if for normal SC conditions, where people are expected to warm up the tyres, and the other is during the actually restart procedures, when drivers are supposed to be lined up and predictable to get back to racing safely.\n\nLike yes it is unlucky for Piastri, but he should have seen the ""SC in pit this lap"" light on time, and eased off instead of keeping doing it.', ""The Race's video on it was interesting...Piastri did the exact same thing on lap 17, on the first safety car restart, and it wasn't even noted by the stewards. I do think a 150 mph sudden deceleration is a bit excessive but the stewards have been rather poor at being consistent about this stuff, particularly when looking back at the end of the Canadian GP""]",0,267,0.36,0,2919,2919,0,5,0.0,0
