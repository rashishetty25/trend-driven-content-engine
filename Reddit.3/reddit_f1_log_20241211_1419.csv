And it does seem like his confidence wanes with each race that passes along, which ultimately affects their results. 2023 may have helped hide that aspect considering Verstappen's surge to put Red Bull on the map, and the other teams' inability to match what they were doing *(which is ironic because that RB19 had its set of minor issues but it was masked quite well)*, but 2024 simply brought all of those to light, and it is quite frankly becoming a lot harder to shield those mistakes\n\nOn a different note, it sometimes makes me wonder on who is the **ideal** driver to sit alongside Verstappen, or what Red Bull are truly looking for. I mentioned elsewhere that Tsunoda will be my pick out of the plausible successors, should they decide to see Perez out.

When do we get to see him sporting Ferrari gear?', 'Battle of the Finns, who was the best Finnish driver? Who was the weakest?\n\n- K.

I mean I\'ve seen people saying he should be in a top team, but on the other hand when people talk about good drivers Hulkenberg is somewhat rarely mentioned. People always say that the cars affect people\'s perception of driver ability and that top drivers are often flattered by their cars\' performance, but i think the ""top"" midfield drivers enjoy some advantage in that they don\'t have top teammates and their shortcomings are often explained away by saying their car is lacking pace. The prime example of this is Perez, who everyone thought was a great midfield driver who would do good as a second driver in a top team, but look at him now. Do you think Hulkenberg is worthy of a top seat (either now or in his prime) or is he another Perez?', ""The media seems to be leaning toward Lawson. Apparently Tsunoda and Lawson were put into the RB20 specifically to get data on who should replace Checo. \n\nLawson had a faster best, but honestly there's no way to know without having all the data. Plus the fastest times of the day were with Ferrari and Williams, and McLaren wasn't even in the top 10, so there has to be more important data they're looking at.\n\nI think Lawson screwed his chances with his tussle with Perez. They want smooth negotiations to get Checo out and even though Yuki is hot headed, he has ALWAYS let the main team drivers through when necessary."", 'Watching the amazing Senna series, 30+ years later it pisses me off how the corrupt FIA and Williams washed their hands with Senna as a driver error as cause of the accident. It seems the FIA has always been a greedy organisation that doesnt give a fuck about the drivers, one big casualty and TWO driver deaths in one weekend, and continuing is the best decision? Thats fucking sick.', ""This year it seemed that the team, not only Norris, were late to commit to the WDC, with Papaya rules (which could also be part of Piastris contract, as he is managed by Webber who had the infamous Multi-21 topic).  \nNorris also had a lot to learn of what it takes to the extent of wording of the rules, when the fighting gets close.  \n  \nSo Norris needs a car and a team that is willing to commit and make sacrifices, when necessary to ensure his chances.  \n  \nIt also depends how well other teams used their second half of 2024 to prepare for the 2025 contender - as I'm assuming once the 2026 development restrictions are lifted the majority of teams will concentrate on that."", ""F1 pundits and sports reporters in general are incredibly prone to recency bias. If the season had ended after Qatar I think they would have been saying that Red Bull have solved their problems and Max is favourite.\n\nMclaren's trajectory would suggest they're going to continue to be fighting at the top and Norris is still the faster driver at this point so it makes sense. But as this season has shown, it's so incredibly tight that any team could take a step and be the car to beat.\n\nI have a feeling that it might finally be 'next year' in 2025, however I wouldn't put any money on that til at least pre-season testing.""]",4,42,0.63,4,36,36,3,1,0.08999999999999997,3

But are there modified rules for cars that have been lapped? Do they need to have an extra   % of fuel after the race?

I already did the quick search but couldn't find the answer, and to be fair I don't want to read through all technical regulations.


","[""Nope, if a team is confident they're going to be lapped, it's a completely legitimate move to under-fuel the car by a lap.\n\nOf course, if you're unexpectedly on the lead lap at the end you have to make that back up through the race, so there is a risk-reward trade-off for teams who are more marginal."", 'No, they don‚Äôt.\n\nStrategists can use this to their advantage. If they‚Äôre anticipating being lapped they‚Äôll put less fuel in the car.', ""Lapped cars don't need extra fuel but in current F1 it would be stupid to underfuel to the point where you need to be lapped for it to work out."", 'They just need to have the 1l for fuel testing, thats all.', ""Can I piggyback on this to ask about end of season donuts in Abu Dhabi?

Do they get a grace/allowance for this?"", 'The purpose of the rule is for fuel testing, no matter when you exit the race or even qualifying. \n\nWhat has this to with lapped cars?', ""Especially if you consider that lapped cars can return to the leader's lap under the SC."", 'Fuel no, tyres yes.', 'Was a question last week: [https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/comments/1h5oav5/why\\_do\\_some\\_teams\\_not\\_want\\_drivers\\_to\\_do\\_donuts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/comments/1h5oav5/why_do_some_teams_not_want_drivers_to_do_donuts/)', 'Lapped cars cover less race distance and burn less fuel. \n\nOP is asking if there is some formula where the lapped car now needs 1+x liters of fuel instead of just the 1 L that lead lap cars need.']",1,11,0.53,1,11,11,1,1,0.07,1
1hbb2nd,Viagogo Scam + Yas Marina Ticketing Mess at the Abu Dhabi GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hbb2nd/viagogo_scam_yas_marina_ticketing_mess_at_the_abu/,2024-12-10, Discussion,"This year‚Äôs Abu Dhabi Grand Prix turned into a nightmare for my husband and me, thanks to a combination of fraudulent reselling on Viagogo and Yas Marina Circuit‚Äôs flawed ticket system.

The Issue

We bought General Admission tickets for Saturday, which, according to Yas Marina Circuit‚Äôs website, include:

1.	Entry to the race zone (qualifying).
2.	Access to the After Race Concert (not sold separately).

But here‚Äôs the catch: this year, Yas Marina split the ticket into two separate QR codes‚Äîone for the race zone and one for the concert. Fraudulent resellers exploited this, sending us only the race zone QR code and withholding the concert access.

We didn‚Äôt know until we arrived at the gate, and Viagogo‚Äôs support refused to help, claiming ‚Äúeverything was delivered as advertised.‚Äù

The Bigger Loophole

To make things worse, Yas Marina‚Äôs system created a massive loophole:
‚Ä¢	If you had General Admission, you needed to enter the race zone first and visit an Ask Yas tent inside to get your concert wristband.
‚Ä¢	But for Golden Circle upgrades, you only had to show your upgrade ticket at the concert gate‚Äîno one checked if you had an F1 ticket for that day.

This allowed fraudsters to:
1.	Keep the Golden Circle ticket for themselves while selling only the F1 race zone QR code.
2.	Sell both QR codes separately, leaving buyers like us with an incomplete experience.

This is even more frustrating because it undermines the whole purpose of a General Admission ticket, which promises both race and concert access.

Why It‚Äôs Outrageous

1.	Yas Marina says the After Race Concert is part of the General Admission package. Splitting QR codes undermines this and enables fraud.
2.	Viagogo didn‚Äôt verify the seller and refused to take responsibility.
3.	Yas Marina‚Äôs flawed system let this happen, ruining the experience for fans like us.

What Needs to Change
‚Ä¢	Viagogo: Vet sellers and refund incomplete tickets.
‚Ä¢	Yas Marina Circuit: Revert to a single QR code for General Admission or fix the loopholes.
‚Ä¢	Fans: Avoid third-party platforms unless you can confirm both QR codes.

We paid a premium for the Abu Dhabi GP and missed the concert‚Äîone of the main highlights‚Äîbecause of this mess. F1 is supposed to be a world-class experience, and fans shouldn‚Äôt be left vulnerable to scams.

Anyone else have a similar experience? Let‚Äôs raise awareness so this doesn‚Äôt happen again.
