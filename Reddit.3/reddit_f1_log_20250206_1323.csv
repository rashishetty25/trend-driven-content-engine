Video contains some testing footage, and an interview with Carlos, where he answers the following questions:

- Why did you choose Williams over another team?
- What did you learn from watching your dad that's been helpful in your Formula 1 career?
- What were your first impressions of working with the team in Abu Dhabi?
- What's the significance of the number 55?
- What qualities do you have that give you the reputation of a driver who helps teams grow?
- What are your hopes and expectations for the team going into 2025?
- How is your hair always so good after a race? (lol)
- What's your most memorable win in Formula 1?
- Any message for the Williams workforce?

","[""I legit sat down to watch this yesterday like a movie, with a cup of tea and my couch blanket lol.\n\nCarlos seems genuinely eager to get to work. He was very insightful with his answers, realistic while also throwing out small morsels of optimism.

It always comes through when he speaks. The vibe at Williams seems right.

1ij1bho,I developed an all-in-one telemetry and data analysis tool for F1 sessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ij1bho/i_developed_an_allinone_telemetry_and_data/,2025-02-06, Technical,,"[""[Imgur Demo](https://imgur.com/gallery/f1insightshub-demo-osG68a2)\n\nHey everyone!\n\nSo, it's been a while now that I have been working on this app. Truth be told, development started sometime in mid-2024, but due to life reasons I was unable to put in any real effort until the last 2-3 months.I have been using it privately for analysis, but now I feel like the application is at a stage where I feel comfortable sharing it with others and I hope it's somewhat useful for someone out there.\n\nI am someone who really enjoys the data and technical aspect of the sport, so the main inspiration behind this, popped up when I got tired of waiting for different sources to publish the relevant data I used for analysis after a session. Even after that, I had to put everything together and make something out of that data. So I decided to develop an app/tool that fetches all that data for me and presents it in a nice format, accompanied by some visual graphs as well. An added bonus is that the data is almost immediately available after a session ends (sometimes even while the session is ongoing), so there is no waiting.\n\nOn top of that, I also added an RSS-Feed reader from some of the most popular F1 outlets. It just makes it somewhat easier to stay on top of news.\n\nNow, although (I think) the app is relatively usable at its current state, there are some known issues (and perhaps plenty of unknown too I am sure) that I will work on in the future.\n\nWhat I know to currently be some of the issues are :\n\n* Delta graph on laptime comparisons is approximated by using interpolated data. It gives a good idea on where each car is losing/gaining time, especially when laptimes are properly aligned, but it is not 100% accurate\n* The speed chart on laptime comparisons can often be misaligned. This is because I use a naive algorithm to perform the alignment based on the first braking point on each lap. This will be replaced sometime in the future. The effects of this are purely visual. It makes it easier to understand when the speed chart is aligned properly. Even if it isn't though, insights could still be extracted from the data.\n* Fetching data from the API can often take a bit too long. Not much I can do here, because it depends on the data API status. I only have client-based caching implemented at the moment. If I see this project getting traction, I might upgrade the server where it's being hosted and use server-side caching as well to speed everything up.\n* The app is not responsive, meaning that it's not meant to be used on a phone. I might work a bit on this just to make it serve some sort of information, but the intended platform is on a big screen, so not much will be available to see on the phone.\n\nAt the moment, I am not so focused on the bugs because I am working on a new segment (Season Summaries), where I intend to generate season-long averages and data summaries. There you would be able to see cumulative and aggregated data about each team (such as average quali/race position, average gap to pole, most preferred weather conditions etc ...)\n\nI have also added a contact option where you could send me an email regarding bugs you encounter or ideas you might have to improve the app. Any sort of feedback is highly appreciated"", 'Damn, love it. bookmarking it to use it during the season', ""I like it. I'll certainly give it a go when the new season starts. \n\nIt doesn't seem to work well on mobile though which makes selecting the filter options a bit tricky. I got it to work, but it was a bit of a fiddle."", ""Hey OP this still needs a lot of work in the UI. It's really not that intuitive in mobile either I am guessing most of your time was spent getting the backend and graphs working. Let me know if this is open source and a way to contribute would love to help. But great job\xa0"", 'Does this also work live during sessions?', 'Mind if I ask what api you are using to get the data?

I hope it proves useful for you :)', 'Thank you!\n\nI am working on some responsive views as we speak. Might make another deployment today for that.
