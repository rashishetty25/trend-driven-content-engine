When we talk about clean air pace, we‚Äôre referring to a driver‚Äôs true performance when not affected by the ‚Äúdirty air‚Äù coming off the car ahead.  

üîç Dirty air is the turbulent airflow generated by a Formula 1 car, which reduces downforce for the car behind, making cornering more difficult and increasing tyre wear.  

üëâThat‚Äôs why clean air pace gives us the clearest view of a driver‚Äôs pure and consistent speed, without external disturbances such as traffic.

üìä For fair and accurate comparisons, we standardise several factors:
 
- Only laps on the same tyre compound (soft, medium, or hard) are compared.  

- We apply a typical degradation per lap rate for each compound.  

- A fuel correction is also included, adjusting lap times to remove the effect of fuel load ‚Äî essentially equalising every lap to simulate running at zero fuel weight.  

Obviously, there may be many external factors that we are unaware of that can influence a driver's performance, such as strategy or not needing to push to the maximum in a stint. Therefore, we try to carefully evaluate each driver in order to avoid including laps that are not representative""

1ns0906,Championship Standings and Eliminations - Azerbaijan GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ns0906/championship_standings_and_eliminations/,2025-09-27, Statistics,"**WDC:** Hamilton has been mathematically eliminated from contention - even if he wins every remaining race he cannot score more points than Piastri currently has.

* With his DNF in Baku, the soonest Piastri could clinch the title would be in the Brazil Sprint. This would require Norris score no more than 8 points and Verstappen score no more than 52 points between now and the end of the sprint.
* If Piastri wins every race (GP and Sprint), he would clinch in Vegas, even if Norris comes 2nd in everything.
* Verstappen winning every race is not sufficient to guarantee the title, as need to outscore Piastri by 9.86 pt/race and Norris by 6.29 pt/race. Consequently, if Verstappen wins every race and Piastri comes 2nd in all, then Piastri would win in Abu Dhabi by 18 points.

**WCC:** Despite Red Bull's 1-6 and McLaren's 7-DNF, Red Bull did not outscore McLaren enough to remain in contention, and they were mathematically eliminated. With the poor results in Baku, the maximum points McLaren can now score is 969, so they can not surpass the 1000 point line; however they can still break the record for most points in a season (860, set by Red Bull in 2023).

McLaren can clinch in Singapore, provided they are not outscored by Mercedes by more than 30 points or Ferrari by more than 34 points. With a maximum of 43 points on offer, this is guaranteed to happen provided they score at least 13 points. This could happen by:

* 1 driver finishing on the podium, even if the other does not score points
* A 4th place finish, provided the other is 10th or higher
* A 5th place finish, provided the other is 8th or higher

We're racing again on the most demanding race track in the world! Join us for race 9 of the N√ºrburgring Endurance Series of 2025 on the Nordschleife. Over 100 race cars are going on a four-hour hunt for points and trophies.  
  
In different classes, fast GT3 cars with around 500 hp, robust touring cars and identical cup cars fight for victory in their class. In the top class, GT3 cars from Porsche, Mercedes-AMG, Audi, BMW and others compete for overall victory.  
  
The N√ºrburgring Endurance Series races on the legendary Nordschleife - the longest permanent race track in the world.  
The 24-kilometre track leads through the middle of the Eifel forests, was built more than 90 years ago and leaves hardly any room for driving errors. No wonder that former Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart once called it the ""Green Hell"".
