I'm currently weighing on those and would like opinions of people who've been to those races or even the seats itself

For Spa we want to go with Gold 3, however the tickets are sold out from the cirucit organisers itself and only available from F1 so I saw on youtube it's a bit of a hit or miss.

For Monza we are going with 8B which looks like this (I'm a Hamilton fan so if we see him win in Monza it'll be crazy but the likelyhood of that is none)

And for Suzuka we're going with Grandstand B2 Zone 1 (Dad's a kimi fan so he likes Suzuka aswell)

Anyone who's ever been to the GPs or seats please comment, thank you!","[""i've been to Suzuka and it was the best grand prix i've ever been to - for reference, i've never done Spa or Monza, but I have been to Austria (multiple times) and Imola.\n\nSuzuka has huge plusses (for me):\n\n- it's well organised, especially when entering/leaving the circuit. you'll queue, but you'll know exactly where to queue and everyone respects the system\n- on friday you can watch from any grandstand (maybe not start/finish but not 100% on that)\n- after the sessions are over, you can also go into the start/finish grandstand, i got some really cool pictures of the track/pitlane\n- food is really good\n- beer is cheap (ridiculously priced in Europe now, imo) and you can also get highballs.\n- during 'meet the drivers', it wasn't a melee to try and get a glimpse of the stage. everyone who wanted to watch literally sat down so everyone could see. couldn't believe it at first.\n- there is a mini theme park in the circuit, which is free to use with your ticket (as well as the ferris wheel)\n- toilets weren't an overflowing mess\n\nwe sat in Q1 lower and it was a great view, had a screen right in front of us, saw the final chicane, pitlane entry, and a fair bit of the start/finish straight.\n\nraces in Europe are really fun but in my experience you have to be prepared to embrace the chaos and the fact you're spending quite a lot of money to be in said chaotic environment.\n\nfinal thought, wherever you go, grandstands are always worth it. GA is every man for himself, and always twice as bad on raceday."", 'Suzuka easily. You are there to experience the cars, not the racing (especially considering there is very little wheel to wheel in general in F1).\n\nSuzuka just has some of the craziest direction changes and beautiful sections that illustrate the absolute insanity of the performance of formula cars. Anywhere in the Esses or specifically T8/T9 would be insane to see in person.\n\nThey would all be great experiences, but Suzuka wins by knockout over most, especially when you account for the international travel and Japan just being an incredible place to visit as a whole.\n\nBtw, COTA has some similar sections and good visibility from some viewing areas and can be a much cheaper trip overall.

Fuji is also an amazing track and worth checking out for Super Formula and WEC.', 'Monza is one of my favorite circuits (I love everything Italy),and the pre and post shows are second none. Spa is in a gorgeous part of the world, in the middle of a forest, and Suzuka is filled with the most authentic fans anywhere in the world.

It's brilliant, I would recommend it. Circuit access is a breeze, atmosphere is electric and trackside viewing is great. I watched from every corner across the weekend. Wherever you sit/stand you feel very close to the action, and often have unobstructed views. I was on the outside of 6, has a real amphitheatre feel to it.

The difference between the two videos might be explained by this, if confirmed.

When I go during a GP I usually seat in the opposite stand you're showing here, so the Prima Variante Interna or I think is called Alta Velocità now. Variante Ascari is incredible to see the cars breezing through that fast chicane, but no overtakes there. Every time I have to decide where to go I also consider Variante Della Roggia, maybe next time I'll end up there.

1njabhz,Is pursuing sustainable fuel worth the unintended side Effects?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1njabhz/is_pursuing_sustainable_fuel_worth_the_unintended/,2025-09-17, Discussion,"I was listening to latest episode of the race podcast regarding some of the things Domenicali said lately. And they zoomed in on the sustainable fuel and all the extra consequences it might bring.. for one; not all teams get free fuel from their fuel sponsor. Sustainable fuel will be like much more expensive, where they pay for like 2-3 million for fuel per season, this could go up to 12-15 million per season with sustainable fuel. That's a serious increase in costs for smaller teams. Just to have ""cleaner"" fuel.

Also there are talks about the fuel being standardised and that would eliminate the r&d aspect and thus make it less interesting for partner ships..how important are these partnerships? Sometimes you hear they gained some power because of better fuel, but it's marginal.

And is it fair, some teams have to pay for fuel and others don't?

What do you guys think, are these unintended side effects / collateral damage worth pursuing sustainable fuel? Will it really trickle down to the consumer automotive? It's been a long time since we have seen any substantial contribution from F1 to the automotive industry, for normal people. Not the hybrid supercars with F1 style power trains. And should F1 be a test lab for consumer automotive? 

The plus side of the sustainable fuel idea is that it comes with the return of V8, (after there wasn't a consensus abot the V10) but that's only a plus if the V8 can be like in the old days and not muzzled like the V6. Because if the V8 is just as fuel flow / rev Limited the sound won't be much better. what benefits are there to a V8 then? Just more power? ","['There are over 1.5 billion cars in the world, so going electric is not the complete solution, as most people cannot afford to buy new cars. Sustainable fuels are a far better option for everyone. Yes, developing these fuels costs money, and some companies are further ahead than others. Nevertheless, if racing can introduce fuel formulas that clearly work, the benefits will eventually trickle down to the general population, making it a priority worth pursuing. Sebastian Vettel has already demonstrated this by running sustainable fuels in his McLaren MP4/8 and Williams FW14B (yes, he owns both), proving that racing cars can be driven at speed using them.', ""It's not unintended side effects, it's unintended consequences. And yes it's worth it."", ""Sustainable fuels are new, actively being researched, and expensive.

2014 grid is,

Mercedes - Sebastian/Nico
Ferrari - Fernando/Kimi
McLaren - Jenson/Lewis

I see it going something like this, Vettel doesn't initially gel at Merc so Rosberg wins his first championship 2 years earlier than real life. Lewis wants out of McLaren, due to them being woefully uncompetitive, and with Fernando's relationship with Ferrari deteriorating this means a seat swap happens.

2015 and 2016 grid is,

Mercedes - Vettel/Rosberg
Ferrari - Hamilton/Raikonnen
McLaren - Alonso/Button 

I can see Vettel winning the 2015 season, he was outstanding in real life that year and I can see this upsetting Nico to the point where 2016 playsout much the same. With Rosberg winning the championship and retiring as a 2x F1 champion.

This is where I'm going to ask the question, what do you think will happen from here. The driver market is the sane as real life with Button retiring, with Stoffel replacing him, and Bottas going to Merc as Nicos replacement. Does Vettel win 2017/18 in Merc or does Lewis do what Seb couldn't in Ferrari.
