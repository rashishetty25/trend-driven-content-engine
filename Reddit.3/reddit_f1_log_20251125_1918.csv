# Analysis

* Each remaining race gives a range of possible points for each driver (0 to 25 for a race, 0 to 8 for a sprint).
* I treated every finishing position as equally likely.
* I generated all combinations of results across the remaining weekends.
* For each combination, I calculated the driver’s total season points.
* Then I created a probability distribution based off all the combinations available.

The chart shows the final distribution for both drivers. The overlap area between the curves represents the chance that Verstappen finishes ahead of Norris in total points.

Verstappen and Piastri are currently on equal points, so Piastri’s distribution is mathematically identical to Verstappen’s. I left it out to keep the chart clear.

# Key Result

The probability Verstappen finishes the season with greater than or equal points than Norris is about 8%.

This isn’t a prediction; driver form, car pace, DNFs, and the usual chaos are not part of this model.","['Why do you use equal distribution of places. This makes no sense. It would be much better to make distribution based on the results from the season or any different way than equal.', 'This is a pretty rudimentary visualization.

1p6gw61,Could this year's title battle be compared to the 1986 season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6gw61/could_this_years_title_battle_be_compared_to_the/,2025-11-25, Discussion,"Of course, the early and mid-season phases were different between '86 and '25. In '86, it was a four-way fight between Alain, Nigel, Nelson and Ayrton, while in '25 it was seen more as an internal battle between the McLaren duo—almost like another Silver War.

However, with two Grands Prix left, I’ve found the two seasons to be quite similar.

In the ’86, Nigel led with 70 points, followed by Nelson on 60 and Alain on 59. Right now, Lando has 390 points, with Oscar and Max both on 366. Considering the points systems of each era, the trends look quite similar.

In the ’86, the title fight was between the two Williams drivers, who were competing with the constructors’ championship-winning team, and Alain, the defending champion driving a McLaren that was regarded as relatively uncompetitive. This year shows a similar pattern as well, with McLaren’s two drivers battling against the defending champion, Max.

In the end, Alain, sitting in third like Max currently, went on to successfully defend his title against Williams. Will Max be able to do what Alain did in ’86? What are your thoughts?

1p5uq5n,How do you rate drivers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5uq5n/how_do_you_rate_drivers/,2025-11-24, Discussion,"How do you rate drivers?

In F1 spaces, there's a pretty strong consensus over where each driver relatively ranks. This post was prompted by [this discussion post asking who would be closest Max in the second RBR seat](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5ftxx/which_driver_from_the_current_grid_would/), where there's a clear favorite answer (Charles) and then some runners-up (George, Fernando, and Lando a few times), which seems to be about the usual ranking.

But like...how do you guys know? I get that different drivers have demonstrated fantastic W2W skill or pace or raw speed, but these things are obviously affected by the car. When comparing drivers who have never been teammates, e.g. Russell vs. Leclerc, in your mind, how do you compensate for machinery? Like, I don't think I could say George *wouldn't* have done even better than Charles in the 2022 Ferrari, or that Charles wouldn't have more race wins than George in the 2025 Mercedes. 

I guess related: where does the consensus in the relative quality of cars come from? This season, with all the VCARB/RBR shenanigans, I've heard that the RBR has a higher ceiling but the VCARB is easier to drive. But based on what we know (everyone not Max has done better in the VCARB than the RBR), it seems equally possible that Verstappen is just car Jesus who  would have won the championship in the VCARB and the RBR without him would be a backmarker—not saying this is true or I believe it, but it doesn't necessarily seem *less* true than the current popular opinion.

I think the boring answer is that fans will naturally reach consensus (especially with new fans coming in and learning about past seasons via memes/stories) and that F1 is fundamentally not a sport where you can compare drivers like that, but I might be/probably am missing something. So how do you compare drivers and cars?","[""Vibes\n\nAnd consider how they're performing compared to their teammates, how consistent they are, and in relation to the team/car's recent performances.\n\nBut mostly vibes."", ""For that discussion post you linked, the reason Leclerc is mentioned is likely more because he and Verstappen like similarly slippery cars + have known each other for a long time so they're often associated together. \n\nIf we're rating based on skill, you'll never find a clear consensus on the 2nd best after Verstappen. There are people on here who 100% believe Leclerc, Russell, Norris, etc. are all bums - when in reality they just don't like them. Sports are inherently biased, that's part of the fun but also frustration when speaking to other fans."", ""This is Reddit, we rate drivers based on whether we like them or not.

However if Lando finishes right behind Max in P2, he won't get it.

So here's how he can get other drivers to overtake Lando.



1. Lead the race after turn 1.

2. Drive as slow as possible without getting overtaken. Be gentle on the tyres.

3. A train will start to form with a bunch of drivers who can be quicker in clean air.

4. Some drivers will go for the undercut, let them.

5. Those drivers will be quicker after their pitstops; virtually overtaking Lando & Max if they will make their pitstops.

6. As soon as Lando pits, go all out. Use the clean air he has in P1 and the still fresh tyres to set fast laptimes to virtually overtake the other drivers again.

7. Keep believing.
