The spectacular Nordschleife test was actually supposed to remain secret. Nevertheless, we were able to take a few exclusive pictures of the drive. And we reveal what the Formula 1 star's future plans are.\n\nAs we all know, Max Verstappen can't get enough of racing. In addition to his Grand Prix appointments, the Formula 1 world champion trains every minute in his home simulator. The Dutchman also runs his own GT3 team, which competes in the GT World Challenge (GTWC). The racing team owner regularly gets behind the wheel himself during private test drives to tinker with the set-up.\n\nThese test drives normally take place behind closed doors on privately rented racetracks, mainly in southern Europe. But now Verstappen has surprisingly dared to come out of hiding. As part of the official test and set-up runs ahead of the third NLS race, the Formula 1 star completed a few laps of the Nordschleife in his 600 hp Ferrari 296 GT3 on Friday (9 May).\n\nThe Italian racing flounder was looked after by Emil Frey Racing during the Eifel event. The Swiss racing team is entering the 296 GT3 in the DTM and GTWC this season. Thierry Vermeulen, the son of Verstappen manager Raymond Vermeulen, normally sits in the cockpit for the experienced GT3 team.\n\n**Verstappen drives under a pseudonym**  \nVerstappen's trip to the Eifel was actually supposed to remain a secret. That is why the driver did not drive under his own name, but under a pseudonym. The most successful racing driver of recent years competed as ‘Franz Hermann’. This name was also stuck on the outside of the Ferrari - next to the Dutch flag. However, because his real name was printed on his helmet and racing overall, it quickly became clear who was really in the car.\n\nVerstappen probably just wanted to enjoy a few laps of the world's most spectacular racetrack in peace and quiet. To avoid being harassed, the new father of a family had his own security staff shield him during his test drive. External photographers were not allowed into the garage.\n\n**Further Nordschleife appearances planned**  \nIt was already known that Verstappen is a big fan of the Nordschleife. The four-time F1 champion had already successfully participated in virtual racing events in the digital NLS (DNLS) on several occasions. However, the simulator events are apparently no longer enough for the Red Bull driver. In future, he will probably be travelling to the Eifel in person more often.\n\nAccording to information from auto motor und sport, Verstappen is reportedly planning to obtain the so-called Nordschleife permit this year. This special racing licence is required to take part in official NLS events and the legendary 24-hour race at the Nürburgring.\n\nDuring a winner's interview at a DNLS event last year, the racing driver had already expressed his interest in real racing: ‘The Nürburgring Nordschleife is one of my absolute favourite race tracks and I hope that in a few years I will also be able to compete here in a real GT3.’"", 'Verstappen: I’m gonna incognito this shit.\n\nAlso Verstappen:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipgnyd5g8qze1.jpeg?width=1169&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a086bd36a940c569bf898130c505bef2632305c', 'It would be an absolute blast seeing him at the 24h race.']",5311,365,0.96,5311,341,341,586,37,-0.010000000000000009,586

I needed him, I felt, more than Mercedes and he was in contract. If I let him go, what message would that have sent? What would that have done to my team if I'd have let George go?\n\n“He was one of the greatest things that we had at Williams. When you go into a negotiation with a team like Mercedes and they're not offering you what they should be for your A-star driver, then why would you just let him go? What kind of Team Principal would I have been if I'd have just let George go because Mercedes said, ‘we want George now’. That's not how it works, is it?\n\n“[George] was clearly upset and it was really difficult. It was very hard to stand my ground because if someone comes to me and they're upset, and it's because of me because I'm a blocker, it's really hard – but I had to put my team first.\n\n“As much as I would have loved to have made George's dreams come true, I couldn't at the time, and that was one of the hardest parts of being a Team Principal for me. And I always said to George: you will be grateful for this one day because it will build resilience in you, it will build strength.”"", ""It makes sense. Claire was looking out for the best interest of the team, and at the time, it was to make George live out the rest of the contract he signed. George was one of the few drivers that could bring the car to Q3. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's a business."", ""This comment section feels really silly. Can you imagine another sport where certain teams don't try to maximize their advantage simply because they are in a poor position? Because that's what it seems some redditors are advocating for."", 'Also seems Merc didnt want to buy out the contract, or give Williams any money for George. Yes they wanted him, but they were not willing to pay Williams out for him. Toto is a businessman first dont forget.', 'She did the right thing. George signed a contract. If Mercedes were not willing to pay up the asking price to get George, I’m not sure why that is a Williams problem. She has no obligation to screw over her own team by letting her driver walk away for nothing just he because wants to.', ""Sucked for george but I totally understand why she did it, george was all they had those years. I don't think it's  far fetched to say George's time at the team laid the groundwork for what JV and albon are doing now."", ""Russell was under contract, so nothing wrong there. Instead, what Williams's responsibility actually was was to do their best to make a competitive car. That was the era where the Mercedes engine was just outstanding. They had a big leg up in making a great car, and they wouldn't do it. And they fell massively behind in infrastructure before the cost cap era started. If they couldn't fund it and couldn't attract enough sponsorship, they should have sold sooner. I know it was a difficult era for money in the sport, but the teams are all responsible for that."", ""Good for her, all this free poaching between same owners teams isn't really good for the sport anyways."", ""Ultimately it just shows Mercedes did want him, but want him to the point they'd concede something to get him out a year early.

Hill, known as 'Mr. Monaco', began and ended his Formula 1 career in the principality, having made his debut there in a small front-engined Lotus 12, in the last year where front-engined cars dominated the field, and the year Juan Manuel Fangio ended his career.\n\nAt the time of his retirement, Hill had started in 176 Grand Prix – a record standing more than a decade until being equalled by Jacques Laffite in 1986 – and had competed in 18 consecutive seasons, a number which would not be equalled until 35 years (!) later by Rubens Barrichello, who now still holds the record with 19 consecutive seasons. He was also the, to this day, last driver to have competed in Formula 1 at more than 45 years of age, a timespan which could be ended by Fernando Alonso if he competed in the latter races of the 2026 season.\n\nHill had been in the sport so long that he was the last active driver of his championship-winning 1962 season, the next most seasoned driver on the grid being Chris Amon, who began in 1963.\n\nHill's career in Formula 1 had been on a downturn since breaking both of his legs during the 1969 United States Grand Prix, not achieving anything more than a select few points finishes since then. Having established Embassy Racing with Graham Hill in 1973, he was gradually winding down his racing career, and with the arrival of promising young rookie Tony Brise to his team, his heart was not in it anymore. After starting in the two opening races of the season in Argentina and Brazil, Hill failed to qualify in South African, and then failed to qualify again in Monaco, a track on which he had won a then-record five Grand Prix on.\n\nSadly, Hill's career as a team boss would only last a further six months, as he, Tony Brise, and several other crew members were killed in a plane crash in November 1975, with Hill himself at the controls. Due to this grievous loss, Embassy Hill was no more – and Damon Hill's way to Formula 1 become one hell of a lot harder and longer, as his family was saddled with the remaining debts."", 'Insane to think about the change he saw in the sport. Imagine starting in front engined cars and changing to rear engined!', ""One of the greats. Both his and Damon's stories are very interesting."", ""When I was a young lad back the early sixties I saw Graham Hill race at my local circuit - Pacific Raceways at Kent, Washington.

Even the floors can get exposed if they have to move the car by crane"", 'I’d love it if a completely random team managed to crack it. Sauber or something is suddenly maintaining its tyres beautifully.', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> When a team wins, it ends up under the scrutiny of the teams and consequently of the FIA. The doubts about how someone can create a considerable advantage over the competition also lead to thinking about solutions that are within the famous grey areas and that perhaps even go beyond in some cases, even more so if that advantage is found in the last year of regulations. \n\n> In this sense,\xa0the McLaren MCL39 is surprising everyone with its dominant performances and rivals are wondering about the nature of this advantage\xa0. Toto Wolff takes his hat off and applauds his customer team.\xa0“Pointing the finger at something illegal is not right. I know the integrity of Stella, Brown, Marshall and those who work in Woking. \n\n> They are just doing a better job than us”\xa0said the Mercedes CEO & Team Principal. Compliments that also come, at least publicly, from Christian Horner (Red Bull) who however behind the scenes has tried to\xa0uncover more than any other team the or even worse the secrets\xa0of the papaya team.\n\n> **Tyre management is McLaren\'s winning ace: the \'secret\' also lies in the brake drums.**\nAnalyzing this start to the season, it has been seen that the peak performance of McLaren is superior but not unattainable for the other teams.\xa0On certain circuits\xa0, the fastest,\xa0and/or in certain conditions\xa0, think of when it is colder,\xa0the MCL39 can be beatable\xa0or in any case the gap is significantly reduced. \n\n> Furthermore,\xa0the Papaya single-seater\xa0encounters the greatest \'difficulties\' in qualifying, which leads Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to make too many mistakes on Saturday.\xa0""Now we have enough data to confirm that\xa0our car is easier to drive in race trim than in qualifying\xa0. So far we have not done a perfect qualifying lap, even if Oscar\'s lap in Bahrain came very close,""\xa0said Andrea Stella. It turns out that above all Mercedes and Red Bull have managed to get closer and even beat the times of the two Papaya standard-bearers in the fastest lap.\n\n>\xa0What makes a significant difference with all the other teams is the MCL39\'s ability to manage the tyres in the most difficult conditions.\xa0In the rain of Melbourne and Miami we saw the difference they can make with the Intermediates, tyres that tend to overheat a lot as the track dries and the tread becomes smooth. This allowed the orange duo to have a pace that was clearly better than everyone else, zero overheating and therefore zero degradation with unmatched consistency in performance. \n\n> The same thing happens, unfortunately for the others, even in dry asphalt conditions.\xa0""When it\'s cold they win with a 10 second advantage, when it\'s hot with 30, today even 37""\xa0said George Russell in the post-race in Miami\xa0. The MCL39 in fact excels on those circuits where a perfect balance between slow and fast is important and above all where it is necessary to know how to manage the tyres very well, that is when the thermal degradation of the rear axle (overheating) is crucial as in Bahrain but also in Miami.\n\n> Since last season, suspicions have been raised at Red Bull about the use of possible \'tricks\' in the wheel corner area. The Milton Keynes technicians have asked the FIA \u200b\u200bfor information regarding\xa0a possible use of infinitesimal quantities of water to manage temperatures\xa0, a technique that they know well in Milton Keynes, and that Rob Marshall believes could have brought to Woking. \n\n> However, both Pirelli and the FIA \u200b\u200bhave never found any evidence to support the thesis of Horner\'s men. Until the study of that macro area of \u200b\u200bthe MCL39 with special thermal cameras, as anticipated by AMuS, which showed\xa0""a strange temperature profile, certainly very different from ours and also from those of our other competitors""\xa0a top technician from the Milton Keynes team told us. It is therefore not surprising that, on both orange-coloured cars, the tyres are practically always in the perfect range of use, above all they do not overheat when environmental and track factors require it.\xa0\n\n> The suspicion, now become certainty for all direct competitors, is that the team led by Andrea Stella has found the perfect way through the cooling system to let air in to cool the brakes but also to not overheat the tires too much, thus trying to have the right temperature to trigger them and guarantee peak grip in a larger window of \'external\' temperatures.\xa0A very delicate balance obtained through what Andrea Stella calls the\xa0dark art\xa0of this F1.\xa0""It is clear that in the race, when we have to deal with tire wear in hot conditions, our car behaves very well. I would like to underline that this is the result of very specific engineering work by our team,\xa0"" said the engineer from Abruzzo.\n\n> In short, not only in terms of aeroelasticity but also in the area of \u200b\u200bthe wheel corners, more precisely inside the baskets, that\xa0McLaren makes an important difference to all the other teams\xa0, thanks to some very advanced technical solutions designed by the team led by Rob Marshall, a former leading engineer at Red Bull. \n\n> The brake baskets that we usually see covering the entire braking system have a standard design on the outside, but underneath it the teams have a lot of freedom in the design and often look for significant aerodynamic gains and above all cooling, even if for this season McLaren has significantly raised the technical bar also in that macro area.\xa0\n\n> It is therefore no coincidence that all three top teams are working hard in that area to bring developments in the very short and short term.\xa0Right in Milton Keynes,\xa0as we have already had the opportunity to report\xa0, they are working on trying to replicate what McLaren believe they can do, with sensitive parts that could already see the track in one of the next races even if Verstappen was very vague in Miami about it.\xa0“We are doing our best to solve this problem. But some things take more time,\xa0even to understand them thoroughly\xa0. Then producing them is a whole other story”.\n\n>\xa0The same goes for Mercedes and Ferrari, although the latter has more of a problem with lighting the tyres and less with not overheating them. In Brackley they clearly admitted with the words of James Allison, who spoke about the purpose of the updates that will arrive in the first part of the summer season.\xa0“The main aspect on which we have concentrated is keeping the temperature of the tyres under control, a crucial aspect to allow the car to exploit the pace it has available”\xa0said the former Ferrari, now in charge of the technical office of the Brackley team.', 'Yeah no shit Sherlock', ""Didn't most teams massively copy Red Bull when they where so dominant?

13:00 - 13:20 After Felbermayr spins you can see who I believe is Ciconte continue down the road wihtout lights flashing.

Hard to believe that this wasn't reported right away. I could verify that the 3 frontrunners Pin, Palmowski, and Chambers turned on their lights later. But it shouldn't have happened in the first place. The team should have ensure the lights were turned on before they started the formation lap.

If you could change the outcome of a WDC, which one(s) would you change?

For background - F1 fan since the 90s, never really been a fan of one driver or team. I'm British so there's always a bit of bias there, but not always - I was gunning for Hakkinen over Coulthard in the late 90s for example. But I mention this to say the purpose should try to stay away from ""I like this driver and cannot have my view changed, and I treat F1 like I'm a football fan""

  
So -

2008 - Massa instead of Hamilton. 

Massa drove brilliantly all season, as did Lewis. Again, as a Brit I was somewhat gunning for Lewis, but in hindsight Massa would have made for a better story. If it wasn't for that pit-stop disaster in Singapore he'd have won it anyway. Hamilton only just won by sheer luck of Glock not having pitted. Massa won the race in style in front of his home crowd, and had the championship snatched away at the last second. Even Lewis has since said he didn't feel mature or ready enough for his first title and he felt like he'd gone too far too soon. Massa had that dreadful accident the following year in Hungary and was never the same again. Lewis would still have six titles, Massa could have retired with a championship to his name.

1986 - Mansell instead of Prost.

Mansell's one and only F1 championship seemed way too easy for him. That 1992 Williams was basically unbeatable. Still the most ""advanced"" car in F1 history. Even Patrese was consistently putting it home in second or third place, and even won in Japan. Mansell walked the entire season to win in an almost fittingly boring and dull style. But he fought like a madman through his entire motorsport career, his determination and hardship was unbelievable at times. I felt he was so cruelly robbed in 1986 when his tyre blew. Prost won other championships, I'm sure he'd have called it fair and deserved if Mansell hadn't retired from the race and took the title. 

1982 - Pironi instead of Rosberg

1982 was a pretty awful season all in, full of tragedy, some bizarre races, and political fallout. Rosberg managed to crawl into winning the championship despite winning just one race, retiring from three, and never really looking that exciting or championship-worthy. Pironi could easily have won had he not had such a terrible accident at Hockenheim. He still managed to finish second in the championship despite missing the last five races of a 16 round season, and not racing in Belgium because Gilles died in practice. Keke is a cool guy, and nothing against him personally, but he was never really championship material and lucked into that one in awful circumstances I'm sure he'd change if he could.

1956 - Moss instead of Fangio

Reaching a little bit as Juan-Manuel was such a fine driver who dominated his era, a record five titles that wouldn't be matched until 2002. Moss however is often described as ""the greatest driver never to win a championship"" and 1956 was his closest shot. A couple of very cruel retirements due to mechanical failure, including one at his home race at Silverstone where him and Fangio did identical qualifying times (only down to a tenth in those days, but Moss got the pole), he was just a couple of points behind Fangio at the end of the season.

1ki7w0t,Should F1 Teams Face Higher Fees for Technical Protests?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ki7w0t/should_f1_teams_face_higher_fees_for_technical/,2025-05-09, Discussion,"After some recent discussions I've been reflecting on the current state of technical protests in Formula 1 and believe there's room for improvement in the system to ensure it's used judiciously.  
  
Recently we have seen Red Bull (surprise surprise) make complaints official and publicly regard McLaren specifically. It has been rear wings, front wings, tires and brakes.   
  
Being a fan for years I am actually getting quite tired of Red Bull's approach over the last couple of decades where any team is competitive.

**Current Structure:**  
Under the FIA's International Sporting Code, teams can lodge formal protests during race weekends by paying a fee, typically around €1,000 from what I could find. If the protest is upheld, this fee is refunded. However, this fee is really a small amount and doesn't seem to deter teams from filing frequent complaints, some of which often seem to lack substantial grounds.  
  
Red Bull as I mentioned, actively lodges both official protests as well as public complaints (often to the media)  raising concerns about rival teams' car components. Basically any time any other team has been competitive or has brought real innovations to their team and the sport. While my focus is on this side of things, in general Red Bull have lodged a variety of complaints consistently.  
  
For instance:

* **Miami Grand Prix 2025**: Red Bull protested George Russell's third-place finish, alleging he didn't slow adequately under yellow flags. The FIA reviewed the evidence and dismissed the protest, allowing Russell to retain his position. 
* **Tyre Cooling Allegations**: Red Bull accused McLaren of employing illegal tyre-cooling methods. The FIA investigated and found no irregularities
* **Brake System Scrutiny**: Red Bull questioned the legality of McLaren's rear brake systems, leading to further investigations that found no wrongdoing.

The flexi wing complaints is another example. Here you can argue that some have been legitimate complaints, the mini DRS while clever I think warranted a revisit.

I think it is important to note though that unlike years gone by teams have to submit their technically specifications and updates to the FIA and the FIA approve all current car updates. There are many cases where there are loop holes and grey areas which teams exploit and that is part and parcel of the sport. I personally love how teams read through these detailed regulations and manage to still come up with clever and innovative evolutions to the cars.

While it's essential to uphold the sport's integrity, the frequency and timing of such complaints, specifically from one team seams to more to do with attempts to stifle competition rather than genuine attempts to uphold that integrity. 

**I believe there should be a change made here:**

To ensure that protests are made with genuine intent and substantial evidence, I believe the following should really be changed.

1. **Increased Protest Fee**: Raise the fee for lodging a protest to a more substantial amount, say €50,000.
2. **Refund Conditions**:
   * **Full Refund**: If the protest is upheld and leads to a rule clarification, future change or penalty.
   * **Partial Refund**: If the protest is found to be legitimate but doesn't result in any action.
   * **No Refund**: If the protest is deemed frivolous or without merit.
3. **Support Requirement**: Depending maybe regarding the size of complaint it may require backing from at least one other team to lodge a protest, ensuring that concerns are shared and not solely strategic.
4. If there is no significant evidence but a team has publicly made claims to the media and if the protest is deemed without merit or frivolous fines will be issued.

I believe these changes would discourage teams more from filing protests without substantial grounds and encourage a focus on innovation and performance.

In my view, Red Bull has taken advantage of the current protest system as a way to suppress competition. Especially during Christian Horner’s two-decade leadership, it seems like part of their strategy hasn’t just been to observe rival teams as all teams do but to actively complain often when they have struggled on innovating and evolving their own car. There’s also a noticeable pattern of Red Bull making public accusations through the media, even when there’s little or no evidence to support their claims.

While they’ve occasionally hit on genuine issues like the Ferrari fuel flow controversy, which itself was quietly buried, the sheer volume of protests and accusations doesn't justify it. In my opinion, this kind of tactic is unhealthy for the sport and undermines fair competition.","[""I appreciate that you took the time to write all of this, but I can't agree with you.\n\nTechnical protests exist for a reason. While the FIA has the duty to police technical legality of the cars, the FIA can't do it alone, so this would also rely on the teams policing each other as well, which technical protests is achieving. Hence teams should find technical protests accessible to encourage the usage of such a system, while ensuring that there is cost to a F1 team such that teams won't abuse the system.\n\nSure most of them are probably false, but when some of these protests turned out to be true, it does help prevent cheating.

I don't know much about that process.\n\nThe other possible side is the cost side. You talk about the amount charged, but not about the price incurred. I do understand that we don't have access to what those costs are.
