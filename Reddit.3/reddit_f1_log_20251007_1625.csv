I wanted to follow up on some other posts and overall discussions around here lately with this video from the '24 Vegas GP that somehow has flown under the radar. Someone suggested I share this as a full post to follow up on another discussion post yesterday, so figured I do so while we've all got last weekend's direction fully in mind!

This video gives a really cool sense of the logistics and communications that happen during a GP just to keep the camera angles flowing. Most of us can and will agree that the direction choices this season have been particularly bad - and I'm definitely not going to argue with that lol. It's been terrible. 

Seeing this behind the scenes gives some cool perspective, though. You *really* can't just have some joe blow who knows wheel come in and do a good job with it - even to make poor decisions effectively, the director needs a level of experience in doing this specific task. 

And, it also begs a question for me. Considering all of the folks working in this room whose jobs are to execute this director's orderes for hours during the sessions' broadcasts, I wonder if there are any debriefs where those folks are asking ""hey, we missed a bunch of overtakes in the last 10 laps, how do we incorporate them in the the future"" or what's going on behind the scenes and between weekends.

1o09v6k,Sergey Sirotkin's F1 career,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o09v6k/sergey_sirotkins_f1_career/,2025-10-07, Discussion,"It's actually shocking to me how forgotten Sergey Sirotkin actually is, because I remember a time when he was probably the most hated driver in the F1 world. For all of you who weren't watching F1 in 2013, for the longest time, it was looking like Sauber was going to be signing eighteen year old Sergey Sirotkin for one of their seats.

Some context is required here. This was before the debut of Max Verstappen, and back during a time where entering F1 in your early twenties was considered young. Another thing to remember was that this was before the super licence point scheme was introduced, meaning that any driver who completed enough testing mileage could get themselves a super licence. Including teenagers with very little success to boast about.

So yeah, there was a lot of fear and hate around the prospect of an unproven Russian teenager getting an F1 seat purely down to money, and this was on top of all the other driver transfers that were going on at the same time. Pastor Maldonado got the then coveted Lotus seat over Nico Hulkenberg that people at the time already felt was robbed of the Ferrari seat, and Daniil Kvyat getting the Toro Rosso drive over Antonio Felix Da Costa, it was one of the more depressing silly seasons to watch during my time as an F1 fan.

However as things turned out, Sirotkin didn't get the F1 drive for 2014, and following Verstappen's entry into F1 in 2015, the FIA created the super licence points system in order to prevent under qualified drivers with loads of money from claiming seats without any real success in single seater series. Sirotking however would return to the F1 radar in 2017, and sadly for him, it's still resulted in a lot of hate.

This time, the hate came from the fact that Williams had already signed Lance Stroll for 2018, and the choice of second driver was coming down between signing Sirotkin or a returning Robert Kubica. Robert Kubica returning to F1 after his awful injury was something we all wanted to see happen. Combined with rumours that Vodka Martini (Williams' main sponsor at the time) wanted a 25+ year old driver resulted in disappointment for many when Sirotkin got the F1 drive instead.

In fairness to Sirotkin, he did finish third in the 2016 GP2 season. Granted, he was a long way back from Giovinazzi and Gasly, but they were both in Premas, and Sirotkin now had the bare minimum results we expected from an F1 rookie. But the problem here was that Charles Leclerc was also entering F1 as a rookie at the same time, and he was hyped as hell. I remember reading an article on Motorsport comparing the two preseason. One was entering F1 with a lot of love and expectation, the other was being viewed as the driver who took Kubica's seat away from him.

So with all this hate going his way before he even started the season, how was he actually in F1...he was okay I guess. Wasn't the best driver in the world, but he was driving by far the worst car on the grid last year, and he showed some good dosage of speed every once in a while such as Monaco and Germany. He even scored a point in Italy, in a car that had no business scoring anything. If I had to rank him in terms of quality, I'd say he was better than Sargent, but worse than Zhou.

But in the end of the day, I think we saw everything he was going to offer F1. Williams would sign Russell and Kubica for 2019, and with it, all memory of Sirotkin's time in F1 all but evaporated, including the hate he suffered for years. As miraculous as it was seeing Kubica back in F1, he was beaten pretty convincingly by Russell, and I don't think Sirotkin would've been any different.","[""Has a degree in race car engineering, and came in when Williams started turning to shit.
