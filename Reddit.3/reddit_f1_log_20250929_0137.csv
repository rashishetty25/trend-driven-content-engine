1nsyrx5,"Enzo Osella, founder and patron of Osella Corse, died yesterday",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nsyrx5/enzo_osella_founder_and_patron_of_osella_corse/,2025-09-28, News,"Enzo Osella, Italian founder of the Osella team, died yesterday 27 September 2025 at the age of 86.

He participated in Formula 1 from 1980 to 1990 starting 132 Grands Prix, later selling the team to Fondmetal.

Osella often had financial issues but managed to get through the years, with the highlight being reached at the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix (the famous race boycotted amidst the FISA-FOCA war) with Jean-Pierre Jarier scoring a 4th place. Piercarlo Ghinzani later managed to score a 5th place finish at the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix.

Osella had more luck in other categories; in the World Sportscar Championship Osella won the 6 Hours of Pergusa and Vallelunga of 1979 and the 6 Hours of Mugello of 1981 with Enrico Grimaldi, Lella Lombardi and Giorgio Francia; the manufacturer also won several titles in the European Hillclimb Championship.","[""Osella were one of the unluckiest teams of all time losing personnel on the track, but always kept going, they're the original Minardi"", 'Text of the article translated in English:\n\n>When you don’t have money, you have to use imagination. Enzo Osella knew this well, because even though he was just a racing craftsman, he was part of the Formula 1 Circus for ten years. With skill, but without backing. From 1980 to 1990. Before and after, he mainly focused on sports cars that managed to mark important stages in races of very different eras.\n\n>Enzo Osella passed away on Saturday, September 27, after spending his final period in a world closed off by illness, but everyone—absolutely everyone—remembers him as a great figure who never managed to find fortune, contenting himself instead with his immense passion for racing. And yet, he discovered drivers who went on to build careers, engineers who trained in the micro-factory of Volpiano on the outskirts of Turin, and major sponsors who first entered the world of GPs with him before ending up on the bodywork of the most successful and important teams.\n\n>Piercarlo Ghinzani is the driver who raced the most Grands Prix in F1 (47 out of 132 contested), followed by Jean-Pierre Jarier (20) and Nicola Larini (18). The first two were the only ones to score points, while the Tuscan recalls the great opportunity he missed at the 1989 Canadian GP...\n\n>“I was incredibly in third place halfway through the race behind Senna,” recalls Larini. “The FA1M89 was performing well even in the wet, because it was raining heavily, but at a certain point the car suddenly went silent. What had happened? The bodywork was fastened with about a dozen screws and, since during the warm-up I had decided to race with the T-car, the preparation of the car had been... rushed. The mechanics had only tightened one screw out of every two and hadn’t sealed the gaps with silicone, as they had done on the other car, so the electronic control unit in the sidepod got wet and broke down. With that podium, which then went to Andrea De Cesaris, the history of the team would have changed, because Osella would have benefited from the FOCA bonuses.”\n\n>Jean-Pierre Jarier, in the 1982 San Marino GP—the race that marked the rift between Gilles Villeneuve and Didier Pironi, contested by only 16 cars due to the FIA–FOCA war—took a historic fourth place, one lap behind the Ferraris, which remains Osella’s best result. Meanwhile, Ghinzani has never forgotten the fifth place he earned in Dallas in 1984:\n“It was incredibly hot,” recalls Piercarlo, “and on the final lap, just before the finish line, I overtook Nigel Mansell who, exhausted, had fainted only a few meters from the checkered flag after getting out of his Lotus and trying to push his car. Osella, always farsighted, had thrown a bucket of water down my back during the pit stop, while the mechanics worked on the car, and I was able to benefit from the soaked overalls.”\n\n>Gruff in appearance but always approachable in relationships, Enzo knew how to make people fond of him: he often began seasons without having the budget to finish them. And he came up with all sorts of ways to find the most improvised solutions: while cars for extra-European races traveled free of charge in FOCA cargo planes, teams without “bonuses” had to bear enormous costs for shipping their crates. Enzo, instead, would pack his F1 cars full of as much workshop equipment as he could fit into the chassis...\nBorn in Cambiano 86 years ago, Osella had followed in the footsteps of his father, who owned a workshop in Turin.\n\n>He began his racing career in 1957 as a co-driver in rallies, because a client of his father was looking for a partner, and later he tried a few outings as a driver. But that was not his true ambition: in order to sell Abarths in the family business, he attended a training course at the Scorpione’s headquarters, and from 1963 he started working with Carlo.\n\n>In 1971, when Abarth sold the brand and its production\nfacilities to FIAT, Osella had the courage to take over the racing department, which the Turin-based company was not interested in. Thus, Osella Corse was born, consisting of a basement, a ground floor, and a “stilt house” above the workshop: “The technical office was there,” explains Antonio Tomaini. “At the beginning, there were really very few of us: five or six during the day, but we doubled in the evening, because those who had gone to FIAT but were still passionate about racing would come back to give us a hand until late at night.”\n\n>Different times, almost heroic: “It’s true,” adds Tomaini, “but I remember that period on Via Guastalla with nostalgia. With Enzo, a relationship of great mutual respect had developed: it may make you smile, but we always addressed each other formally until a few years ago, when we finally broke the barriers and switched to the informal ‘you.’ And to think we worked together for years, in two different phases after 13 years at Ferrari.”\n\n>F1 was the most visible window of Osella’s activity: how could one forget the 1972 European Sports title with Arturo Merzario, which led to a prolific production of winning two-seaters everywhere, especially in hill climbs. When Osella resumed his activity after a pause following the F1 stop, he moved to Matera, where he created the factory where many prototypes were born that went on to dominate the hill climb scene.\n\n>Osella left a significant mark on motorsport with cars that raced and won in every corner of the world, but the lasting image is that of an enthusiast through and through, a man of engines who realized his dream by reaching F1, even while knowing he didn’t have the means to challenge the other Enzo, the one far better known and celebrated.', 'Crazy. I was just watching some video of the launch of their first F1 car in 1980 yesterday and wondered if Enzo was still alive as the video specifically mentioned he was 40 years old at the time.\n\nI checked and he was and that was only yesterday....damn. \n\nI only saw an Osella once in my time, and that was at the 1988 Australian GP with the awkwardly named FA1L, and that was only briefly as Larini couldnt get past pre-qualifying. But I think everyone has a soft-spot for the team and Im glad to have had the chance to see.', 'Osella sports racers were among the sexiest. Not particularly fast but very pretty.', ""One of my favorite historic teams. They had some of the most beautiful cars and liveries. It wasn't easy to build cars, their first car was some 100 KG overweight. But ocassionaly, it got some good places with Cheever on-board, both on the grid as well as the races, until something broke down on the car. The baby blue color was unique for the following years as well as the yellow-black. It ended white until Fondmetal bought it, with Grouillard on the wheel. The car was good but it was expensive and they ran out of money."", 'I think all F1 fans have a soft spot for small underdog teams like these, your Osellas, Minardis, and Manors.', 'Or ATS.', 'Absolutely.
