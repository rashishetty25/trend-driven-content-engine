1i9ojre,The FIA swearing ban is mentally insane.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i9ojre/the_fia_swearing_ban_is_mentally_insane/,2025-01-25, Discussion,"What on Earth was MBS thinking when he drew up those rules? Penalty for friggin swearing? Race ban threats? Thousands of Euros in fines?

I think this is too much. Almost every F1 driver swears, and these new rules are a recipe for disaster, both in F1 and in other FIA series.

The average accrued penalty points by the end of the first season of these rules will be worse than Lord Mahaveer's F2 season.

And not just that, it's in the Motorsport Code, meaning it won't just be F1 that's affected; F2, F3, FE, WEC, it will apply to anything FIA-regulated.

How long until an F1 race has as many starters as Monaco '96 had finishers? How long until an LMP2 driver wins the 24 Hours of Le Mans because most of everyone in the Hypercars said a bad word?

These new rules are a powder keg. I can only hope they'll be taken out.","[""All of the F1 drivers should get together every GP and swear like sailors. \n\nLet's see the FIA ban all 20 drivers."", ""He's an insecure petty little dictator.

To be more precise, on average, in a new season, between 2013 and 2025, we have gotten:

•	⁠**3** rookies,

•	⁠**13** drivers staying with their team,

•	⁠**3** drivers changing teams,

•	⁠**1** driver coming back after a break from F1.

Other key numbers:

•	⁠**19** drivers started the 2024 season in the same seat they started 2023 (and the whole grid started in the seat they finished the 2023 season in),

•	⁠**8** drivers started the 2019 season in the same seat they finished 2018 with,

•	⁠Lewis Hamilton drove **12** seasons with Mercedes while at the end of 2025, Max Verstappen will have been with Red Bull for **9.5** seasons,

•	⁠In the last decade, Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas had the longest teammates tenure with **5** seasons together between 2017 & 2021,

•	⁠Between 2013 & 2025, **9** drivers got a seat after not having one at the beginning of the previous season (Kevin Magnussen doing it twice).
