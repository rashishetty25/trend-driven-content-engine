I have read all of this on reddit, so, my source is a bit lacking, for lack of a better word. 

Now, I don't know how much Haas pushing the cockpit behind is due to them taking design cues from Ferrari or there's some performance gains that they see in this design philosophy.

1iqilse,Drivers driving style comparison,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iqilse/drivers_driving_style_comparison/,2025-02-16, Statistics,"Hi. I watched this video of [JxmyHighRoller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boct75srdbE) where he found out which NBA player is most similar to LeBron James by his play style using different metrics from raw data(game stats, etc.). I'm curious if there is any similar analysis in formula 1 where they compare some drivers driving style (for example Verstappen's) just by creating different metrics from raw data (lap times, tire deg,..)? Or it was done by video analysis?","['Definitely isn’t possible with data as we don’t have equal cars and there’s many other variables such as strategy, reliability, a bad setup, etc that can easily skew the data making it unreliable \n\nProbably the best way to compare driving styles is to just observe a drivers traits over a number of years and make judgements based off of what you notice, however this also isn’t fully reliable as the best drivers will adapt their style to the car they’re driving (probably the most extreme example of this was Alonso at Renault with his aggressive turn in)', ""There's a couple of videos on the F1 YouTube channel of Jolyon explaining some differences.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zVZlcwHgJgE?si=vS4UM5JMFfOJWIa4\nhttps://youtu.be/-iGEcXg1KIw?si=ahjWsZCdf6lR0vxD\n\nI think might be part of a more in depth video on F1TV though not entirely sure \n\nIt's hard to truly know though unless we had the data of a driver throughout their whole career to see trends. So some of the older drivers you may be able to make an educated guess. Also doesn't help some cars require specifc ways of driving, so drivers often have to drive outside their comfort zones and may not be driving their preferred way.""]",0,2,0.44,0,2,2,0,1,0.10999999999999999,0
