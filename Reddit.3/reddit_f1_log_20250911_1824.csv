1ne57q8,What Undercuts and Overcuts Are,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ne57q8/what_undercuts_and_overcuts_are/,2025-09-11, Discussion,"It's become apparent in recent discourse that people use the terms Undercut and Overcut to mean any change in position which happens around a pitstop phase.

This isn't really what these terms mean when discussed in terms of ""Driver X was given an undercut by the team"". etc.

Undercut or Overcut is all about changes in position happening around pitstops precisely because of the timing of the stop giving you a pace advantage on track.

# Undercut -

The Undercut is the idea that pitting earlier gives you the opportunity to gain time on the driver you are battling by being able to exploit fresh tyres. This increased pace over the car out on track on worn tyres might allow you to gain multiple seconds per lap.

**Risks of Undercut  -** The Undercut only works if you can get upto speed quickly and exploit the pace of the fresh tyres. Traffic is usually a big risk for an Undercut strategy as if you have to pass cars you can't exploit the pace of your fresh tyres. The other potential issue is tyre warm up which in F1 usually isn't much of an issue due to tyre warmers, but with hard tyres on cool tracks it can still be a significant issue. Also pitting first means you will have to go longer on your tyres, potentially leaving you vulnerable later in the race.

Safety cars are a huge risk for a driver attempting an Undercut, if you pit first under green flag conditions and then a safety car or VSC comes out your advantage is demolished.

**How to Negate an Undercut -** Having a big enough lead over the car behind can protect you from an undercut, or having the pace to match (or nearly match) the driver on fresh tyres. Otherwise the strategy to defend from an UnderCut is to pit as soon after your rival as you can to negate their advantage. Then the ultimate way to defend from an Undercut is to pit first!

Or, you run much much longer and allow them to undercut you with the intention of passing them later on much fresher tyres.

# Overcut -

The Overcut is the idea of staying out longer than your rival and using the pace of your car and tyres to gain time on them on their outlaps. This also defends from potential safety cars benefitting your opponent over yourself.

**Risks of Overcut -** This only really works if either you have an inherently faster car, tyre wear is next to non-existent or the tyres cars are pitting onto have a signficant warm up phase or are just inherently slower. In F1 it is fairly rare where the Overcut is the preferred strategy as tyres come out the blankets nearly ready to race, but traffic can make the overcut viable. This is something you see more in series without tyre warmers such as indycar.

**How to Negate an Overcut -** Negating an OverCut is all about not pitting too early and ensuring you have good pace on your fresh tyres. If you have a quicker car behind you and fresh tyres are gonna take a while to be upto speed then pitting first is very dangerous and you are going to want to try and outlast your opponent. In these situations sometimes you get a game of ""pit stop chicken"" where they try to goad each other into pitting first.

# Exceptions -

If a driver suffers a slow pit stop for whatever reason and gets passed either by a car pitting earlier or later, that isn't an Under or Over cut. The timing of the cars pitting is not the reason that the positions changed, it was the issues in the pitlane.

Saying a car Overcut or Undercut in such situations is missing the reason for the overtake happening which is entirely the time spent on pitlane, not the timing of the stop.

Thankyou for coming to my Ted Talk","['Key point I miss here, the overcut and undercut can only be executed by the driver behind.\xa0', 'Thanks for this explainer, it’s a pretty good explanation of both concepts.', ""So if you're going for an undercut you ideally want your team to execute a very fast pitstop and for your rival to have a stop that isn't that fast.

1ndq57a,F1 can learn some lessons from WEC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ndq57a/f1_can_learn_some_lessons_from_wec/,2025-09-10, Discussion,"
I recently dove into the world of WEC and watched several races from this season. I’m very impressed with how well it’s run, especially in terms of safety and the consistency of decision-making from the Race Director.

Full Course Yellow (FCY):
Instead of bunching the field behind a Safety Car, every driver slows to a controlled speed of 80 kph while maintaining their position. The pit lane is closed. This eliminates the need for a VSC and adhering to a delta time. It effectively freezes the race and prevents anyone from taking advantage of gaps under the VSC.

Virtual Safety Car (VSC):
This works the same as a Full Course Yellow, except the pit lane remains open. Again, instead of monitoring a delta, cars are held to 80 kph throughout the VSC. This ensures no one gains an advantage by manipulating the delta.

Safety Car with Wave-By Procedures:
This is an area F1 could easily adopt. While you could argue F1 already has a similar system, WEC’s implementation is far more consistent. Each phase of the Safety Car is predictable and standardized, which provides better forecasting for teams to make strategic decisions.

Overall, the procedural decisions made during WEC races appear far more consistent than anything I’ve seen in F1 over the past 12 years. ","['I feel like F1 cars would struggle being stuck on 80 kp/h and the tire temps would drop massively, a delta time gives them more room to manage it.', 'As someone who follows both series closely I think WEC’s current procedures work very well for them and F1’s procedures work well for F1. There’s no need to change anything', ""WEC's procedures work well for WEC because WEC cars are fundamentally far more balanced vehicles that can still operate fairly well at 80kph and at the restart.\n\nIf F1 cars slow down to a speed of 80kph for a few laps, on most circuits and on most tire compounds, they'll be too cold for the restart.\n\nCourse volunteers can also work around 80kph WEC cars. The F1 cars need to be bunched up together under safety so that course volunteers can be safely dispatched to do their job. It is one thing to work around 80kph cars - another thing altogether to be out there with cold F1 rubber and aerodynamic grip reliant cars."", 'I loved at COTA this past weekend when the safety car had done so many laps in the wet that they had to switch it out for another but then didn’t tell the field so they followed it into the pits and in the confusion temporarily mixed up the field so bad they had to red flag the race to determine the correct starting order.\n\nIt made for an interesting in-person viewing experience.\n\nOk the whole, WEC’s procedures are good for them because their races are long and the cars are well balanced to each other (another 10kg for Toyota).', ""You haven't made a single argument for why F1 should adopt these changes or what would actually be improved by doing so.\n\n\nIt's different, it allows for different strategies. Different can be better, but it's not necessarily better."", 'WEC races are long lol. Lemans has had 12 hours of safety car procedure before. You could eat a whole f1 race with 1 sc procedure lmao. Both series are regulated by the same FIA. F1s regulations work for f1, WEC for WEC. Remember Eduardo was f1 race director for some time so they have crossover at that level even and he didn’t massively change things', 'One of these has 60+ cars that race for 24hrs and regularly pass each other the entire time.... The other does not', '>The pit lane is closed.\n\nAnd that is how Singapore 2008 entered into infamy. Renault pitted Alonso early, knowing that Piquet Jr. would bring out the safety car. When he did, everyone backed up behind it, unable to pit until racing resumed. When it did and everyone dived into the pits, Alonso got a thirty-second advantage on the road.', ""> Full Course Yellow (FCY): Instead of bunching the field behind a Safety Car, every driver slows to a controlled speed of 80 kph while maintaining their position.

At least the time delta takes that into account.\n\nWith a consistent 80kmph you're not taking unfair and making it fair, you're taking who it's unfair to and moving it around.""]",85,63,0.69,85,696,696,1,0,0.009999999999999898,1

I’m believing that this championship battle has almost no hype. McLaren is obviously a rocket ship no one can deny that. After 16 races both McLaren drivers individually have more points than any other constructors. Lando is currently 13 points ahead of Ferrari and Piastri is 44 points ahead of them. And they both have same car so they’re equal on that.
In terms of skill etc. I’m believing that Oscar is slightly more talented than Lando but Lando’s experience balances it, so they’re almost equal on that too.
Basically there’s no significant difference for me that effects the battle significantly.

Situation looks like it’s screaming 2016 all over again but nobody is hyped about it. In summer break the gap was 8 points if I remember correctly, it’s basically nothing but why nobody is excited about it ?

For me a big factor is this 

-McLaren intervenes their battle quite a lot than it should be which kills the excitement quite a lot for me. They’re acting like a parent whose twins are competing over something (let’s say exam scores) , they create some boundaries etc. If the situation is indeed like twins competing over exam scores I’d say they’re good parents. Since they don’t let the tension rise etc. but the situation isn’t like that at all. 
In title battles I’ve watched and heard things weren’t that calm, they’d go all out do whatever they can to win which creates a big excitement.

Another thing is we don’t see on track battles between McLaren drivers. Usually for me on track battles creates a lot of excitement they lack that too. Do they ever really had an on track battle for a win this season ? I’d say no they were usually close but not a significant battle they kinda accept their position and move on. It feels like there’s some sort of de facto Multi-21 team order.

Finally I think they lack aggressiveness. If you followed interviews etc. they aren’t aggressive their statements doesn’t feel like they’re fighting for championship instead it feels like they’re in an upper-midfield team that fight for podiums. And you can see that lack of aggressiveness in team radios too. In Monza Lando had a bad pit stop and got undercutted by Oscar because of this, McLaren intervened asked Oscar to return position and Oscar just accepted it. He didn’t resist at all. I get it in radio they said to him it’s payback for Hungary last year but still I don’t get it at all. 

Oscar and Lando are fighting for title this year, situation is completely different than 2024. It’s just so stupid.

Anyways that’s what I think about that.
Do you think that this title race is boring if so why ? 


It’d be nice to read some opinions beside the ones that my algorithm shows me.

Thanks.


","['I think this is one of those seasons where the WDC fight is *interesting* rather than *exciting*. It happens sometimes - to me, it\'s the same principle as a race being won on strategy instead of wheel-to-wheel racing. It\'s less popular and not as flashy, but still a perfectly valid method of doing it.\n\nThe main reason I say it\'s interesting is because of the very reason a lot of people don\'t like it: McLaren are managing this in a way I don\'t know if any team in a similar position has before. There\'s a tendency to believe that the only valid personality for an F1 World Champion is to have a huge ego, blow off anyone who thinks they can control them, and be a complete ruthless bastard on track. What we\'re seeing is an inverse of the driver-team relationship someone like that usually provokes; the team are the ones pulling rank on the drivers, they\'re the ones steering the championship instead of the ego of one or both drivers, and for the novelty of that approach alone I think it\'s interesting to see.\n\nI think it\'s kind of a perfect storm for them to even be able to try this, and the reason I think that is also where I think the difference is between this season and something like 2016. What I think is key to McLaren\'s driver management this season is that neither Piastri nor Norris have won or seriously challenged for a title before. That means neither of them have effectively earned the right to be considered the ""default"" driver. While Norris is the more experienced and was a McLaren junior before F1, it\'s not really his team because Piastri has the arguably higher pedigree, with the F3/F2 back to back titles and the public coup that was his signing in the first place. At the start of last year, neither had won a race at all, and now they\'re battling for the championship. When you look at other teammate WDC fights, they\'re not so evenly matched (from the team\'s perspective), and that changes the driver\'s mentality too. 2016 was exciting because we\'d seen Rosberg beaten twice in a row - including very convincingly in 2015 - while Hamilton\'s stock grew as he racked up the championships. There was a very obvious underdog story going on that year that doesn\'t really apply this year because both drivers have pretty much equal stock. Incidentally, that\'s also part of why I think there\'s so much belief that McLaren are institutionally against Piastri - people like to root for the underdog, so when there\'s someone doing better you have to find some reason for it to be a heartwarming story too.\n\nSee what I mean - I have a lot of thoughts about how this is going, so compared to a season where one driver cruises to the title with no competition, I can never say this is a boring season. I think it\'s fascinating to see whether they can hold it together with this unusual management style, it\'ll be interesting to see whether those driver egos we expect are actually present and what the breaking point might be, and I\'m still as invested as ever in seeing every race because the gap is close enough that everything still matters.', 'I think it’s boring because the only possible intrigue is being neutered by McLaren trying to hyper manage driver/team relations out of fear. It’s not a team that looks strong and dominating, it’s a team that looks out of their element and scared to make mistakes. The car is doing extremely heavy lifting. The WCC is locked up and the WDC is being filtered through McLaren’s PR op. \n\nNot that the races aren’t worth watching anyway, but I honestly couldn’t give a crap about the title fight. Which is really odd, because it’s a resurgent team with two non-champions in the fight. It should be amazing, but it’s not. The only intrigue I have left for the title is if/when the reins come off this hand holding adventure.', 'Maybe on an individual level within McLaren, some might lean toward one driver or the other, but not the team as a whole. My biggest issue is that only Max can race them consistently; otherwise, the drivers end up fighting among themselves. When the team interferes with results, it doesn’t look good from the outside.\nAs for the racing being boring, I don’t think it is. Most events have delivered good competition and drama, and the upcoming tracks should provide more excitement, unless you only care about who finishes first.', 'You guys need to realize that not every championship battle will go down the wire like 2021', 'I\'ve been thinking on this lately, particularly after some heavier, conflict-first (honestly, myself included) discussions after Monza. And, just in general. There seems to be a real disconnect between what we have on paper, and what us fans are experiencing. \n\nFor me personally, I find that I\'m able to get invested in the championship battle - though I have also never experienced this much ambiguity in the WDC standings. My first race that I watched live was literally Miami 2023, and it\'s been Max all the way down since then lol. Since I have no other battles to compare to, so I\'m able to get invested just in the ""ooh, what\'s going to happen?"" vibe. \n\nBut, I do have to ***work*** to get invested. It\'s intentional. Realistically, regardless of the media trying to hype up the battle, it just doesn\'t feel like there\'s blood on the line. I don\'t need to see Lando and Oscar truly hate each other, but I can\'t really think of any time we\'ve seen them emotional or pissed off, or that they truly *care* to beat the other. The intensity that as fans we\'re told to expect from the media hype, just isn\'t there. And that\'s the disconnect I think that folks are struggling to engage with as fans. We need to see more from the two of them that shows that this WDC *really matters*. \n\nThere\'s a real ""corporate identity above all"" vibe with McLaren that feels...off. It doesn\'t scream ""we\'re a racing team!"" it screams ""we are here to represent our sponsors."" Miscues and mistakes like Monza, and their response to those issues, compound this by giving us an *inkling* that they *might* choreograph their driver\'s on track positions. \n\nIt\'s odd. There\'s still something there, if you try to see it, but I don\'t blame anyone for not feeling like they really want to try.', 'Because we already know the winning team will be McLaren, and whether they realize it or not, the team is creating the perception that whoever wins is whichever driver gets chosen to win by the team. It\'s like a parent letting their kids ""race"" with training wheels and trying desperately to keep it a tie so that one kid doesn\'t start crying\n\nThere\'s no drama or intrigue because it\'s clear the drivers aren\'t giving it 100%. They aren\'t showing the same ""win or die trying"" mentality that made previous F1 championship battles so enthralling. It\'s all so sanitized and controlled by the team that it just feels borderline scripted', ""The season started of slow between the McLarens with Lando not qualifying brilliantly and Max just having enough in the car to be in the way a little. Then the gap grew for McLaren so the 1/2s became more common but the results were mostly solidified by qualy and the first corner. We started getting some slightly more wheel to wheel (Austria and Hungary for example) but when something like that happened the quick radio messages of 'remember how we go racing' kills the mood a little. We also had a little spice with the Oscar Silverstone penalty but while I think he was very pissed off about it he kept relatively quiet. After Hungary and Spa I had some hope they were finally allowed to go a bit more rogue with strategy and have it be a little more each garage on their own, but Monza showed that's not really allowed (we've heard nothing about Oscar being allowed to try undercut, Lando had the reigns), and of course the Zandvoort DNF has resulted in a pretty decent points gap. This means Oscar can just go on steady as ever and Lando needs to step up big time but most people just don't see it happening. \n\nAnd what also matters, although unconsciously for a lot of people I think, is the fact that expectations for this season were really high. F1 ended 2024 with two teams pretty close, which would result in a 4-driver battle for the wdc in 2025, and if Red Bull or Mercedes could step up a little more it could've been a 5/6 driver wdc battle. Instead it's just 2 drivers and a dominant team once again. A title fight between different teams will almost always be better than a fight between 2 teammates."", 'I mean its a better title fight, rather than the non-existent ones in 2022 / 2023.\n\nIt might be ""boring"" because there is no drama, but its a Sport... If people want drama they should stick to the manufactured shit provided by DTS - You\'ve still got the fact that we\'ll go into each weekend, not knowing who is fastest between Norris / Piastri in Qualifying... and as shown with Austria / Hungary, they are allowed to race, regardless of common opinion on here.\n\nYes its not great that its a season dominated by one team, but at least its not a season dominated by one single Driver, which was the case when Perez was too shit to truly challenge Verstappen.', 'It’s boring because the drivers involved don’t exactly show much spice and McLaren and their stupid rules take every little bit of conflict out of it\n\nImagine Hamilton vs Rosberg or Senna vs Prost but everyone was nice to each other and tried to avoid conflict as much as possible.\n\n\nThis whole WDC fight feels more like a PR campaign than two racers going at it']",39,102,0.67,39,96,96,10,14,0.020000000000000018,10
