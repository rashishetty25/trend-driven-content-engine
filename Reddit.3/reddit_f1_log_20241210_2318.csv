From the looks of how understeery that car can go at times, it is not surprising both Verstappen and Perez reported similar issues with it.

Although I feel like this can be applied to a lot of other situations that goes around the sport, the vitriol here about Perez is appalling at times. I understand the frustration, but Jesus Christ, people.\n\nHowever, I do agree that Perez has been a factor in Red Bull's underperformance. While Verstappen has been able to extract every aspect out of the car, Perez couldn't. And it does seem like his confidence wanes with each race that passes along, which ultimately affects their results. 2023 may have helped hide that aspect considering Verstappen's surge to put Red Bull on the map, and the other teams' inability to match what they were doing *(which is ironic because that RB19 had its set of minor issues but it was masked quite well)*, but 2024 simply brought all of those to light, and it is quite frankly becoming a lot harder to shield those mistakes\n\nOn a different note, it sometimes makes me wonder on who is the **ideal** driver to sit alongside Verstappen, or what Red Bull are truly looking for. I mentioned elsewhere that Tsunoda will be my pick out of the plausible successors, should they decide to see Perez out.

The Issue

We bought General Admission tickets for Saturday, which, according to Yas Marina Circuit‚Äôs website, include:

1.	Entry to the race zone (qualifying).
2.	Access to the After Race Concert (not sold separately).

But here‚Äôs the catch: this year, Yas Marina split the ticket into two separate QR codes‚Äîone for the race zone and one for the concert. Fraudulent resellers exploited this, sending us only the race zone QR code and withholding the concert access.

We didn‚Äôt know until we arrived at the gate, and Viagogo‚Äôs support refused to help, claiming ‚Äúeverything was delivered as advertised.‚Äù

The Bigger Loophole

To make things worse, Yas Marina‚Äôs system created a massive loophole:
‚Ä¢	If you had General Admission, you needed to enter the race zone first and visit an Ask Yas tent inside to get your concert wristband.
‚Ä¢	But for Golden Circle upgrades, you only had to show your upgrade ticket at the concert gate‚Äîno one checked if you had an F1 ticket for that day.

This allowed fraudsters to:
1.	Keep the Golden Circle ticket for themselves while selling only the F1 race zone QR code.
2.	Sell both QR codes separately, leaving buyers like us with an incomplete experience.

This is even more frustrating because it undermines the whole purpose of a General Admission ticket, which promises both race and concert access.

Why It‚Äôs Outrageous

1.	Yas Marina says the After Race Concert is part of the General Admission package. Splitting QR codes undermines this and enables fraud.
2.	Viagogo didn‚Äôt verify the seller and refused to take responsibility.
3.	Yas Marina‚Äôs flawed system let this happen, ruining the experience for fans like us.

What Needs to Change
‚Ä¢	Viagogo: Vet sellers and refund incomplete tickets.
‚Ä¢	Yas Marina Circuit: Revert to a single QR code for General Admission or fix the loopholes.
‚Ä¢	Fans: Avoid third-party platforms unless you can confirm both QR codes.

We paid a premium for the Abu Dhabi GP and missed the concert‚Äîone of the main highlights‚Äîbecause of this mess. F1 is supposed to be a world-class experience, and fans shouldn‚Äôt be left vulnerable to scams.

Anyone else have a similar experience? Let‚Äôs raise awareness so this doesn‚Äôt happen again.

1hazmn9,I think the 2026 rules are going to hurt overtaking a lot,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hazmn9/i_think_the_2026_rules_are_going_to_hurt/,2024-12-10, Discussion,"You know why no other motorsport allows active aero? Because it bolsters dirty air and reduces slipstream. It's rule number 1 of racing regulations - its why GT3's have bolt-on wings while their road-going counterparts are shapeshifting. In the 2026 F1 regs, teams will be able to toggle between aero modes on most straights at all times - which means dirty downforce creating a huge wake in the corner, and Monza trim down the straights.

[Take it from PlanetF1](https://preview.redd.it/reme6rzr306e1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=256f7aa727bfea4b22178ba706d0d48b05159c79)

Despite this, DRS is getting removed in 2026. I hate it as much as the next guy but removing the aid that makes 3+ tenths on a straight when you'll have these Project 400 monsters making reduced slipstream, is a recipe for disaster.

  
Downforce decreased by 30%? Surely that is SOME good news for the following car? Nope - its all been sourced from lovely clean ground effect.

[Venturi effect has been the dirty air magic bullet](https://preview.redd.it/cquec0l7706e1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=6846ac5c3e1250ff14c4edc1523f4fd066b71980)



There is a ""DRS replacement"" for the following car, in the form of an ERS boost. How exciting! Thats way better than DRS, it can be used anywhere including small straights (DRS potency is exponential with speed), gives diversity in overtaking and maybe even a challenge to control the traction!

Oh, it only STARTS to activate at 295kph. And its a gradient that only really kicks in around 310-320. Its somehow even less diverse than DRS. Now every motorway overtake will become even more redundant, and every straight less than a kilometre will be abandoned. 

[You can do the maths](https://preview.redd.it/zzoox5vx706e1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=9175f92639228e14ce23b006d35f1bfceaedaf5d)

And it depletes the battery so there's not even intrinsic gain for the following car like DRS. Which is so critical when dirty air is gonna be a problem! Funny DRS train battles will perish - now each position swap is a huge battery depletion, if the guy can even get close.



They must be hoping that their vaunted ""inwash"" effect can save the day. But it doesn't fill me with hope that their last amendment from November was to allow more front wing and bargeboard appendages to ""claw back some lap time"". I think 2026 is going to be a massive struggle for on-track action.

  
To people who think the sleuths at the FIA are trustworthy enough to avoid this cock-up - they sat on extensive ground effect for 40 years when it was the cure for dirty air all along, they forced hybrids through while bankrupting 2 teams and providing little value to anybody, and they commissioned the 2017 regs. Also traction control shouldn't've lasted until 2007.  


Its a shame because people will conflate this latest gaffe with the car size reduction, which is a brilliant first step towards tiny, agile, raceable ones. Small (particularly narrow) cars are the best way to create exciting racing. But with extreme dirty air, racing can never initiate in the first place.

(Not to mention it is a markedly small step: Weight reduction is half of what was gained between 2021 and 2022 even IF theres no backsliding. And dimension reductions are less than half of 2016-to-17s gain.)

  
Does this match the public sentiment? Most of the F1 fans I've talked to haven't even looked at the regs. But im interested to hear some opinions. And I'd like to hear from an expert about the active aero stuff, because I am no expert but I find it hard to believe active aero was a productive solution here?","['I think most of the reaction to the regulations are overblown and it‚Äôs worth waiting until we see them in action for a few races before forming an opinion', ""I disagree, or at least, am a bit more optimistic.\n\nConsider that:\n\n- Slower cornering speeds with lower downforce actually creates more potential for varying lines through corner complexes. Additionally, lower downforce places more emphasis on driver skill in braking zones.\n- Cars may have a harder time following due to lack of slipstream and no DRS to overtake, but they will still have battery deployment to bring them alongside and will be able to stay alongside without instability due to inwash aero.\n- Smaller footprint due to reduced length and width means more nimble.\n\nTaking these three things together and what I think we will see (and what F1 is aiming for) is less 'push to pass' on the straights (though some 'push to draw alongside') but more battling / overtakes through corner complexes, which I think could be significantly more exciting and is certainly more reliant on driver skill."", 'I am not saying you are wrong in your worries, but ground effect is not the nectar that makes following easier. It is the reduction of outwashing elements and the reliance of the front wing to control the airflow that helps. You force the teams to use a single plane front wing with no end plate and ensure its width is less that the overall width of the car and you remove outwashing bargeboards, then you will also have cars that are easy to follow without increasing any downforce from the floor. The issue here is that the cars will most likely be slow. Inwashing elements greatly reduce the width of the wake and that is the key to making cars easier to follow.', ""To me this reads mostly like a bunch of half-informed hot takes patched together. I'm not saying the concerns aren't unwarranted, but they are way more complex than they seem. If these concerns can be reached through some thinking and discussion they have definitely been evaluated and addressed quite a while ago.\n\nEdit: also speaking from experience, ground effect is not the magic bullet to solve racing, it was just aggressively marketed to create hype for the 2022 reg changes. Sure it does help to some extent but great racing can be achieved without it and poor racing can still happen with it."", ""When I saw the news about DRS being removed I also got worried about overtaking getting worse, not only that but small front wing damage will probably force most drivers to pit, while with the current regs you usually can keep racing with only a small performance cost.\n\nIt looks like most of the changes have been made so the engines can be raced without making the cars incredibly slow on straights. I have the feeling that overtaking will be very hard in 2026, but I hope I'm wrong."", ""Reduction in downforce doesn't really matter, it's the reduction in downforce while following another car that's important."", ""the ground effect cars showed no improvement on overtaking, and as we saw in the last race in this season, a car following close to another will lose downforce drastically, and DRS was just a push to pass created to mitigate the inability of those giant cars to overtake on corners.\n\nThere's also the problem of ground effect cars being much harder to drive then conventional ones as the downforce generated changes drastically if you're going over a kerb or if the track is wet."", ""Before the current ruleset people were constantly crying that F1 was going to be ruined, etc. etc.\n\nWe'll see"", 'Drs is going away because we‚Äôre getting the F1 version of Indycar‚Äôs Push to Pass. There will still be an advantage to the chasing car. Not sure all of the details yet but it should be fine. Also, less downforce means less dirty air. Cars should be able to follow each other closer, for longer.', ""I do agree that the movable aero doesn't seem like it's going to create the easiest racing opportunities. However, we need to wait and see just how powerful this p2p system is. There's a chance that can overcome the lack of a proper slipstream effect.""]",0,28,0.3,0,28,28,0,1,-0.020000000000000018,0

Verstappen handled the clash in pretty much the way that we'd expect a driver to handle the clash.\n\nThis appears to be little more than an attempt to launder Russell's image since he made himself look stupid after accusing Verstappen of being a bully in Qatar.
