1i78lvs,"Starting today, we are banning Twitter/X content on r/formula1. We urge all journalists, creators, photographers and other F1 personalities to also make their content available on alternative platforms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i78lvs/starting_today_we_are_banning_twitterx_content_on/,2025-01-22, Meta,"**TL;DR:** For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter, with the intention to make this ban permanent in some form.

Hey everyone!

After [yesterday‚Äôs proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6lm2v/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/) we discussed within the mod team whether a full ban on Twitter content would be feasible. We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers & FOM have not. But we also realize that it‚Äôs a *chicken or the egg problem* and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a non-trivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news

In the end we‚Äôve settled on the following approach:

* For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter with the only exception of screenshots of relevant posts by teams, drivers & F1 that are **not available on any other platform**. Even in case of major breaking news, we ask you to post links to the press releases or a screenshot of the post from Instagram, with a link in the comments.
* We hope that this trial period will provide a nudge for F1 journalists, creators and teams to make their content available on alternative platforms as **we intend to make this ban permanent in some form.**

Why a trial period? First of all, sometimes mods make bad decisions even if with the best intentions. (For example in 2015 this subreddit banned images & gifs, which caused a controversy that was only resolved after [Will Buxton stepped in to mediate the situation](https://redd.it/3jmslx).) Second of all, this is one of the strictest approaches to Twitter content and strict bans like this can have unintended consequences, so we might need to later refine this ban. We intend the trial period to last at least until the first races of the new season, after which a final form of the ban would be implemented.

This subreddit has had restrictions on what content can be posted for a very long time. We‚Äôve had the source rating system that labeled the quality of news sites and is still used for removing sensationalist and unoriginal articles. We‚Äôve also had limitations on Instagram due to its requirement for an account to view posts. There‚Äôs no doubt that over the past years Twitter has become a low-quality source: the login requirements, the flood of bots, the prioritization of content from paying users and promotion of sensationalist content. But unlike with news sites in our source-rating system, for Twitter there wasn‚Äôt really an alternative. But now that viable alternatives are emerging and the proposal thread from yesterday has shown that the community prefers those alternatives, **we think it‚Äôs time to try and see how the subreddit works without content from Twitter.**

# For journalists, photographers, creators & other F1 personalities

Our preferred alternative platform is Bluesky and to help avoid impersonations we have created a [list of verified F1 related accounts on Bluesky](https://go.bsky.app/57f6geP). This list is used both for feeds & starter packs on Bluesky, but also for AutoModerator here on Reddit. We are adding new verified accounts whenever we come across them, but please contact us on Bluesky or send a modmail here on Reddit to accelerate this process. We want to assist with this transition and we also want to hear your feedback throughout this trial period, so please get in touch.","['https://preview.redd.it/ffwlldom9jee1.jpeg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e7761f171e9f5d7430bb27593eb3c53408674db\n\nI see F1twt is reacting to this in a so normal way. üò≠', ""Twitter was such a low bar for quality news anyway.

Now, I‚Äôm American, and my familial roots as a sports fan is basketball. I know in the league they curse all the time and in many very creative ways over everything under the sun. On the court, in the interviews, in the press conferences, whenever, wherever. Hardly, ever does it become an issue to any real degree greater than a fine, it gets bleeped out, we all move on and keep enjoying the sport. 

Basketball is one of the biggest sports in the world, so this fascination with stamping out what has never been a problem either in Motorsports, really only happening with any frequency with specific people and often when things are going wrong and the excitement for a particular race can reach its highest peaks.

So I‚Äôm left to wonder, what gives? Most drivers across all FIA regulated sports are reasonably well behaved. Sponsors and Fans are flocking to top level racing unlike anything seen in years. Things are incredibly bright. So why is an issue being made out of thin air? Worse, Sulayem seems to be particularly waging this war with F1 rather than other disciplines. So what‚Äôs the issue?

He has an enormous ego, and this is part of it.\n\nWhen there isn‚Äôt, he lacks the maturity to take it on the chin, and instead he lashes out. So he‚Äôs binned off the audit and ethics committees at the FIA, because how dare they question him. He‚Äôs decided the british media are a unique enemy because they publicly document his failings. He‚Äôs decided the drivers are trying to make trouble and they need to be penalised into behaving.\n\nHe then lacks the insight to understand that this just makes people dislike him more, and therefore he‚Äôs critiqued more, and he lashes out more to the point that any valid point he has is lost. It exposes his ego fully.\n\nBernie, and Moseley, and Todt all had the ability to take it on the chin and say ‚Äòif you don‚Äôt like me, whatever‚Äô which stops that cycle progressing.', ""It's getting more and more bizarre. Even if this is just a symbolic act, the FIA could theoretically apply these rules at any time.

1i745e4,Gary Anderson: Which of Audi and Cadillac is the better bet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i745e4/gary_anderson_which_of_audi_and_cadillac_is_the/,2025-01-22, News,,"['One thing people seem to love to ignore about Audi is that they\'re likely fine with Sauber just existing so as to sandbag for their ""debut"" season. The new Concorde Agreement being heavily patterned after an American-style franchise system basically makes that a viable medium-term strategy. Also helps them avoid a situation where they finish lower on their first year as Audi compared to their previous year as Sauber.', ""> It will be the second and third years that are the toughest, as you will run into all the mistakes you make and, as the races will keep coming thick and fast, you need to focus on improving reliability and development while still building up your team. [...] This is why it can easily be your fourth season before you can really assess where you stand.  \n  \nSo competition for Alpine regarding 100 race plans, without saying 100 race plans.  \nBut in general as Cadillac will be allowed to be a PU supplier from 2028 onwards, it'll also affect their results - even if they manage to learn from chassis lessons.  \n  \n> Sauber led the way years ago as far as its windtunnel was concerned, but it hasn't had the finance and stability to keep it up to date so improving that and its other simulation tools is the first challenge.  \n  \nFor Audi the issue is three fold from my perspective, partially it'll be a Williams like team restructuring, the additional cost cap allowances coming for Switzerland (25% import tax from certain goods from EU) as well as a notably higher cost of living will only appear for 2026 onwards - meaning they'll be at a financial disadvantage when they enter as Audi.  \nAdditionally as Audi lobbied for additional materials to be allowed for PU, which they know from road car production - it remains to be seen how those ICE materials will work out in F1 settings and workload (i.e. potentially reduced power output, due to use of aluminum over iron alloys). \nMeaning in contrast to Cadillac they'll learn their lesson regarding chassis and PU by 2028, while Cadillac has a staged learning curve coming towards them."", ""It's probably Audi but it will be due to experience. The carrying over the sauber staff under better management is probably the difference.t\n\nCadillac won't have the running of facilities straight away. New teams need time to adjust so who knows 5 years time, it could flip"", ""Why is this even a question ? Audi are and it's not even close, they actually have an existing foundation to build off and are years ahead with engine development.\n\nAnd sure, they were the worst team in 2024, but being the worst team in the year with the closest field spread ever when the team has both eyes on 2026 isn't as bad as it looks. \n\nI wouldn't have faith in either atm fwiw, but still, Audi are clear."", 'Audi easily, they actually have history building amazing racecars. Cadillac has always taken the cheap route, even currently in IMSA/WEC.', 'LMFAO. \n\nExplain.', 'Psst, in WEC What regulations did Alpine build their car too?

In GTD Pro, the class where GT3 road based cars are piloted by top rated professional Platinum and Gold drivers, we see 15 entries (cars) featuring 9 different road based chassis from nine different familiar manufacturers - sure to be an exciting and competitive class. [Breakdown of GTD Pro](https://www.dailysportscar.com/2025/01/22/2025-daytona-24-hours-preview-gtd-pro.html).\n\nThat\'s 27 cars with all professional driver squads - the primary focus of the broadcast. A field bigger than F1. It\'s the biggest professional GT3 field seen around the globe. And the only other championship, aside from WEC, where the GTP/Hypercar prototypes compete.\n\n24 hour races are mentally punishing. Strategy plays a huge part in racing here - stay on the lead lap and in the lead group, and after a late race safety car with 2h-1h to go, it\'s anybodies guess as to who crosses the line first to win the Rolex.

Final left-turn onto my street and boom!! There is my wife pulling her vehicle out of the way RIGHT as I hit our driveway. It was the most flawless double stack ever! I raced into my spot as she followed right behind leaving her vehicle first to leave tomorrow for work.
