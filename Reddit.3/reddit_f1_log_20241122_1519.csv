Although at the time Sergeant was the only American driver in F2, the comments make it seem like none of us had much confidence he'd make it. 

With Logan now out and the US still a massive and expanding market for F1; I thought it would be interesting to ask again. Frankly, this time it seems even less obvious who it might be.

I see the options as:

* Jak Crawford - The best placed American in F2 (currently 5th), with links to Aston Martin. However, frankly, I think its unlikely Aston would put him in their car.
* Juan Manuel Correa - Sadly will perhaps always be best know for being part of Hubert's tragic crash.
* Max Esterson - Stepping up to F2 next weekend, but does not have great results over the last few years.
* Ugo Ugochukwu - Unlike the last time I asked when there were 5 Americans in F3, there is only Esterson this year and so far only Ugochukwu confirmed for next year. He is perhaps the most exciting US prospect having won Macau last weekend and being a long-term part of the McLaren junior programme. But like Bortoleto would he need to go elsewhere to get an F1 drive?
* Colton Herta - Still fairly young Andretti driver who could come across with them?

Again, an honourable mention to Pato O'Ward who grew up in Texas but was born in Mexico - who drives for McLaren in Indy but has expressed an interest in coming to F1 before. Nowadays, I'd see him more as a possible stand in for a F1 race in the Americas if Lando or Oscar were injured. ","[""If Colton wants the drive.

Aston Martin I’m sure wouldn’t hold him back from an F1 seat and F2 drivers have closer paddock ties than Indy drivers do (especially those with academy ties), not to mention driving the same circuits as F1. \n\nHerta doesn’t have a super license. The Andretti ties work in his favour obviously but curious what Michael’s involvement is these days. \n\nI agree that Correa and Esterson are not realistic. I’d probably give Ugo the best chance after Crawford but outside of Macau, he wasn’t great this year either.

But while there's been a few races where the team let him down, he's also been letting himself down through his [poor starts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WwTIzl86IYetXxWnZVdmMSjt3eJkXsOj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112088406529391436673&rtpof=true&sd=true) and this has directly affected his championship chances. With outliers removed, he has the highest average placement loss (-0.7), tied with Ricciardo.\n\nThis is in comparison to Verstappen and Leclerc, who both have a positive average of 0.6 and and a gain of 15 positions across the season. I've seen people say it's the car but Norris' own teammate, Piastri, has only lost a position on lap one once this entire year.\n\nI know it's probably frustrating for him because he clearly has the pace to win these races, but I find it difficult to believe Verstappen wouldn't have been more competitive in the MCL38 when Verstappen is incredibly good at the one skill Norris is incredibly bad at. There are multiple races Norris could have won if it wasn't for this. I genuinely believe if Verstappen was in the car, 95% of the positions Norris has lost on start, Verstappen would've kept. And therefore, kept those precious points too."", ""As always a self-pity party over at McLaren. McLaren have had the overall fastest car since Miami, and took that weekend + Imola to fully understand their upgrades. \n\nPotential point swings that McLaren/Norris threw away are: \n\n* 7+7 points at Spain (2nd > 1st + Max 1st > 2nd) \n* 8 points at Austria (DNF > 6th) \n* 13 points at Silverstone (3rd > 1st + Max 2nd > 3rd)\n* 7 points at Hungary (2nd > 1st) \n* 7 points at Monza (2nd > 1st)\n* Atleast 9 points in COTA (4th > 2nd + Max 3rd > 4th)\n* 17+7 points at Brazil (6th > 1st + Max 1st > 2nd)\n\nThey could've been leading the WDC by ~20 points if they hadn't repeatedly fucked up. Also keep in mind that Spain, Hungary, Monza, COTA and Brazil all fully or partially came as a result from Norris' shit starts."", ""The history point is technically correct that nobody has clawed back an 80+ point gap in F1, but that's because we've only had 15 seasons where an 80 point gap between frontrunners is even possible. Similar was said in 2022 when Leclerc was leading Max by 46 points after Australia, and Max ended up winning the title by 150(?) points. It's impossible until someone goes and does it, and it was definitely doable.\n\nAlso, the 80 point gap was at Silverstone, when Lando had already lost a lot of points at Spain, Austria and Silverstone. The gap was 54 points after Miami, arguably where McLaren started equalling and later beating Red Bull's pace. Closing 54 points in 18 races (with 4 sprints) was definitely doable especially when Red Bull became the 3rd fastest car at most of the races post summer break. Verstappen won 4 of the first 5 races, while Lando has managed 3 in 16 since Miami, in a car capable of much more""]",0,82,0.41,0,73,73,0,33,0.12,0
