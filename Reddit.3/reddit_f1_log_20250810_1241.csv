I cannot find any information on how those specific crossings - the parts were the F1 track crossed the horse racing track - were managed.



There are only to options, both seem problematic: either the horse racing track was paved over or the GP circuit was covered with sand/earth/dirt/whatever it is that a horse racing circuit is made of.

If they paved it, they had to remove the asphalt after every Grand Prix to make it useable for the horses again.

If they put sand over persisting asphalt, wouldn't that still be noticeable during the horse races or maybe even be bad for the horse's legs?

  
Any information on this topic would be much appreciated!","['At Aintree the crossing points are actually public roads - Melling road which you can look up on Google maps is the road. \n\nThe horse racing has multiple layouts, the only one with crossover is the Grand National.
