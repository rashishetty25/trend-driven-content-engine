The impact destroyed the front of his MP4/3, killed the deer instantly, and left Johansson dazed and bruised ‚Äî but incredibly, he escaped serious injury.

He later described it as ""like hitting a concrete wall."" The crash left the car wrecked and Johansson shaken, but after a medical check, he returned to the garage, got in the spare car, and still managed to qualify.
