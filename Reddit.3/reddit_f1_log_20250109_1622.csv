The results of this were apparently dismal for Doohan and so the rumours came out.\n\nIt‚Äôs never been about Colapinto. I think everybody can agree Brazil was Colapinto‚Äôs worst weekend with the two crashes, the lack of faith didn‚Äôt come from belief in Colapinto instead.\n\nIf Doohan does well, he‚Äôll be kept.

we often hear discussions about the current F2 cars not being a good indicator for driver performance in current F1 cars.
In parallel, most teams run ""TPC"" (Test of Previous Cars) programs with older spec F1 cars with aspiring drivers.
Do you think it could make sense to run these TPC cars in a racing series instead of F2 cars? Eventually with de-tuned engines or other limitations for cost reduction.
Currently drivers need to bring budget to finance the TPC runs, but as these are held privately, they certainly aren't very attractive for sponsors. What's your take on this?","['That‚Äôs sounds awfully more complicated than it is now. Iirc it takes a great team to even think about firing up an ex-f1 car.
