1o2i8jx,Alex Palou: 'I was upset and angry' when McLaren signed Piastri,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o2i8jx/alex_palou_i_was_upset_and_angry_when_mclaren/,2025-10-09, High Court witness statement,,"['What people forget about Oscar signing with McLaren was that Andreas Seidl really really wanted him. Even Palou just stated it was Seidl who ultimately wanted Oscar. Seidl was basically Oscar‚Äôs biggest supporter at McLaren.\n\nAlso thought it was bizarre at the time to have all of Palou, Herta and O‚ÄôWard at one point in the books. 3 don‚Äôt fit into 1 and that‚Äôs not accounting for Oscar.', ""It's amazing that the echos of Vettel's retirement are still ringing.

Seidl was the data-driven TP; he was the one able to assess Piastri‚Äòs reserve driver work and potential ceiling.

The C6s won't be run again this year, and the tyres are changing with the new regs anyway, so it's a bit of a moot point.\n\nI think the main thing the C6 has done this year is throw a wrench into quali and weekend planning.

But for the fans, when it is 'tricky' for the teams, it is great.\n\nI'm not suggesting I want a tyre failure demolition derby and complete chaos, but F1 should not run from 'tricky' tyres, it should embrace them. It needs to find a way to get them away from the race to be the slowest, and softest tyre managers, i.e. how do they make every race into a one-stopper.\n\nOutside of refueling, which isn't coming back, I'm not sure how. However, we need to find a way to introduce some strategic variance, to the point that there are at least a minimum of 2-3x strategies each weekend that would make actual competitive sense to run in a race that converge at one point. Not ones that are long shot gambles - but legitimate viable winning strategies. I know this isn't the only issue (current regs, car size, etc), but I think this would go a long way towards helping in the future.""]",559,101,0.96,559,1831,1831,5,0,0.0,5
