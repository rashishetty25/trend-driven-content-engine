1kjn12p,Did F1’s Fastest Lap Point Rule Really Affect Strategy? Here's What I Found,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kjn12p/did_f1s_fastest_lap_point_rule_really_affect/,2025-05-10, Discussion,"So, F1 recently got rid of the fastest lap point, claiming it was all about strategy, not pure pace. They said drivers outside the top 10 were ""stealing"" the point, with some even affecting the championship. But is that really true? I decided to dive into the stats and find out if the rule actually made a difference.  
For context, the fastest lap point was introduced in the 2019 season till the 2024 season. When I say before 2019, I mean from 2011 to 2018.  
  
Here's what I found -  

**Before 2019**: The fastest laps were mostly set in the middle of the race. Only about **3% of races** (6 races) saw a driver in the top 10 pit late and grab the fastest lap. The **average laps remaining** when the fastest lap was set? **17.22**.

**After 2019**: Things changed. Fastest laps were set much closer to the end of the race, and it wasn’t just about pace anymore. **23% of races** (27 races) saw top 10 drivers pit late for that point. The **mean laps remaining** when the fastest lap was set dropped to **5.94**.

Here's a slide showing all the instances of drivers outside the top 10 pitting towards the end and setting the fastest lap - 

[Comparison of instances where drivers outside the top 10 secured the fastest lap, before and after the introduction of the fastest lap point in 2019.](https://preview.redd.it/o83j28mtd10f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e83b3163b3addc51b4f3ee9a2fb91ae52061d57e)

  
So, what else did F1 management expect? In close championship battles, teams would always take every advantage they could, whether that meant pitting late for the fastest lap or making strategic moves to “steal” the point. It was clear that the rule wasn’t just about pure pace, and in many cases, it became a tactical tool for those outside the top 10.

F1 scrapping the rule makes sense, but only time will tell if, from this year onward, teams return to the pre-2019 pattern where the fastest lap becomes more of an honorary achievement rather than a strategic goal.

What do you think? Did this rule give too much power to drivers outside the top 10?","[""The problem wasn't drivers outside the top 10, it was that getting fastest lap was more to do with how fast the driver behind you was (and therefore how close). It generally just boiled down to which driver in the top 10 had a pit stop gap behind them in the last 5 laps."", ""What I really like about Zhou's fastest lap at Bahrain 2023 is that it was done to take the point away from Gasly, which means that Sauber thought that they would be competing with Alpine for positions in the WCC. By the end of the year, Alpine had beaten them by 120 to 16..."", ""The straw that broke it was a sister team tactically 'stealing' a point from a driver who was in direct competition with the parent team, wasn't it?\n\n  \nWithout that one Ricciardo fastest lap, I doubt they'd even have changed the rule."", ""Still think they should've switched to a pole position bonus point for GPs. It would serve as effectively the same thing but without the gimmick of some teams stopping for tires to steal it when others don't."", 'For chaos: a point for the fastest lap every lap.', 'One point I would like is extra point for pole', '>\xa0What do you think? Did this rule give too much power to drivers outside the top 10?\n\n\nI don\'t know about too much power...\n\n\nIt certainly gave teams the ability to tank one drivers race to influence it...

We\'ve all seen allegations suggestions about how RB tells TR to let their drivers through easier etc.\xa0\n\n\nIt\'s also a ridiculous thing when the only driver that goes for FL is P5 with a 30 second gap. It often felt like FL points were a matter of circumstances and not a genuine ""wow he tried hard and got it"". Which I\'d use for a good argument at removing it.\xa0', 'Only race it genuinely affected the result, in my opinion, was Silverstone (70th anniversary?) race. Max pitted for fastest lap then Lewis’ tyre exploded and won on three wheels. \n\nIt’s pretty easy to assume Max would have won if not for that.', ""Fastest lap point was pointless to measure real pace order.\xa0As you noted, in quite a few cases it just resulted in a late pitstop for a semi-quali lap. The way it is now still doesn't reflect genuine pure pace given it's all about who has the better tyre management, but at least it gives other insides into it, rather than just showing driver X pitted onto the soft tyres near the end.""]",1148,255,0.96,1148,241,241,77,17,0.0,77

Its seems everyone keeps forgetting that McLaren haven’t even touched the car yet. one update and you can forget about qualifying ahead of them', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Max Verstappen has been complaining regularly about his car\'s handling this year. The understeer is particularly annoying. But the engineers fear the problem won\'t be completely resolved, even with upgrades.**\n\n> In Bahrain, the first warning sign had already been given. And in Miami, Max Verstappen was unable to compensate for his car\'s deficiencies. In the end, the world champion crossed the finish line just 40 seconds behind winner Oscar Piastri. ""Max was able to pull off a magic trick on one lap in qualifying. In the race, we saw that we were losing an average of seven-tenths to a second per lap to the McLaren,"" calculated Motorsport Director Helmut Marko.\n\n> Verstappen had already complained about his car\'s steering behavior in free practice. As has often been the case this season, the rear end initially feels light when braking and turning. Towards the apex, the balance shifts increasingly toward understeer. It\'s difficult for the drivers to adjust to this shift in balance. The lack of confidence leads to frustration and lost time on the clock.\n\n> To alleviate the problem, the engineers brought a new underbody to Miami. The upgrade was originally planned for Imola, but a sample was finally ready in time for the Florida trip. Naturally, it was installed on the number 1 race car. It\'s rare for such a major change to be used on a sprint weekend, where there\'s only one free practice session for testing and data collection.\n\n> **Underbody alleviates problem.**\nAccording to chief engineer Paul Monaghan, however, the risk was limited. ""We saw in the wind tunnel that the stability of the airflow was unchanged compared to the old underbody. Therefore, we weren\'t worried about it suddenly becoming aerodynamically unstable. The new underbody simply produces a little more downforce,"" the Briton explained.\n\n> The car\'s sensors then spit out the expected values. But it wasn\'t a cure for the problems: ""We know the areas where we need to improve. They\'re the same after Miami as they were before Miami,"" explained team principal Christian Horner. ""The new underbody delivered what we wanted. It\'s part of a series of upgrades that will come over the next few races.""\n\n> Helmut Marko also hopes that the engineers have something more up their sleeve: ""The understeer problem isn\'t solved yet. It improved somewhat with the new underbody, but we still have work to do. I hope that a solution will be ready by Imola so that the car can finally find balance.""\n\n> **No one-stop solution.**\nChief Engineer Monaghan tries to temper expectations somewhat in this regard: ""There\'s no one-size-fits-all solution. It\'s only possible with small advances in many areas. We know what\'s happening to the car, but finding a cure isn\'t so simple. It may never even go away completely. But we should at least be able to mitigate the extent of it. We have a lot of clever people in Milton Keynes working hard on it. I\'m sure it will get better.""\n\n> The question is whether it won\'t be too late for Verstappen\'s title dreams until the engineers finally cure the RB21\'s mood swings. With a current 32-point deficit, Horner sees the situation as already tense: ""The World Championship is over 24 races. The road is long. But McLaren looks very impressive in Miami. Things can change, of course. But we should start reducing the points deficit in the next few races.""\n\n> **Hope for Barcelona turnaround.**\nRed Bull\'s own upgrades aren\'t the only thing intended to bring them closer to McLaren. Hopes are also pinned on the new front wing regulations being introduced for the Spanish Grand Prix. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200bthe front end of the car is no longer allowed to flex as much under load. All top teams need to make improvements here to pass the more stringent FIA tests. This could potentially hit McLaren harder.\n\n> ""It\'s difficult to predict at this point what the impact will be,"" Horner pondered. ""But it\'s not just a small adjustment; it\'s a fundamental change. It will definitely affect all cars, in many areas. It\'s just a question of the extent.""', 'Im actually really excited for the Barcelona “reg” change. Horner says it will affect all the cars differently.\n\nLike imagine we show up and Ferrari are fastest or something\xa0', 'i can’t imagine how they’d be able to contend for the wdc unless they figure out a tyre cooling trick similar to mcl because even if they solve all their balance problems all of a sudden, their tyre deg will never be as good especially in hot conditions', ""If only they had some sort of warning about the car balance or that they were heading into the wrong development direction!  \n\n\nNo one ever said anything, nothing at all, no way they could've known!"", 'So, just another day for a team not at the front row ;)', 'Nothing new']",412,91,0.96,412,1973,1973,4,0,0.0,4
