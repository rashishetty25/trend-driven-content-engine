1iazszl,F1 History Question: Head/Nec/CTE before the halo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iazszl/f1_history_question_headneccte_before_the_halo/,2025-01-27, Discussion,"I’ve never posted here, and I’m going to discuss driver death and injury, so I’ve used the NSFW tag per the rules. If I’m wrong on this just yell at me about it.

So I’m not exactly a new fan to F1 (I found it when I was trying to get clean in 2017/18 and it helped - a lot), but during this off season I wanted to go through and watch old races, learn history, etc. I’ve kinda gone through what Netflix has to offer and I’ve also watched a ton of YouTube and I’ve got an F1 pro account and have for about five years or so now and have watched a ton on that.

Something that sticks out to me is the driver deaths and injuries pre-halo. Right now I’m watching “20 Times F1 Cars Went Airborne” via the official f1 channel on YouTube and I am familiar with Senna and that…race at Imola (I have angry opinions on this. Very angry. I was 12 when he died and because F1 wasn’t really a thing here (US), I didnt see the race until recently. Fuck.)

I’m wondering, watching this footage and Senna and so many drivers before and after him, how many drivers ended up with CTE or other head/neck injuries before the halo was introduced? I know the halo isn’t a magical unicorn of less injuries, but watching drivers just look like he’s a rag doll when crashing is yikes.

","[""Because most safety measures only come up once something causes it to be brought up. Also, for more context, F1 came to be less than a decade after a world war, so people had a different concept of risk back then (same could probably be said of the grand prix drivers during the interbellum, having just come from the great war). So the result is that safety measures tended to develop at a snails pace, right until something major happens and/or someone raises a stink about it.\n\nThat said, prior to the halo (and after Senna's crash) the rule was that when drawing a line from the top of the roll hoop to the small bump in front of the steering wheel, the line should not intersect with the driver's head. This was in addition to the higher side protection around the drivers head."", 'I think CTE comes more as a result of repeated impacts to the head. This is common in American football and combat sports. While the individual impacts may not be as high in magnitude as a crash in F1, the repeated nature of these probably do more damage that may contribute to CTE.', 'One thing worth remembering is most head injuries/concussions in F1 over the last 30 years or so have come as a result of the severity of the crash and not because something entered the cockpit and hit the driver. Halo wouldn’t have helped in those cases. It’s the HANS device that has made the biggest difference in preventing concussion and whiplash injuries. \n\nSenna and Massa are the only two instances in F1, although there are cases in other series (Henry Surtees in F2, Justin Wilson in IndyCar) of fatalities due to debris striking a driver. It’s been proven that Bianchi wouldn’t have been helped by Halo because the forces the crash generated were too vast.\n\nThere are cases of drivers suffering long-term concussion effects. Luciano Burti suffered from seizures after his crash at Spa in 2001, while Dario Franchitti was forced to retire from IndyCar, but I’d say these are relatively rare.', 'It certainly happens but the halo has actually quite little to do with this protection. It protects against an impact in front of you but this isn’t a primary risk. Many more concussions and brain injury come from the head whipping around and sudden deceleration. A lot of credit goes to HANS which is quite a bit older than the halo. It primarily prevents your head from whipping around. It was implemented to prevent skull fracture deaths but most head and neck injuries are much less common with it. I’m not sure about senna, he had many factors add up but Ratzenberger who died a day earlier than Senna would likely have survived', ""I feel most of the time, security measures are introduced when there is a clear case where it could have saved a life. In the case of the Halo, things started rolling when Bianchi died in 2014. \n\nBut there was a lot of pushback, from drivers and teams. Aesthetic concerns, worries about not being able to get out in time etc. But in the end, even if the pre-halo cars are much more handsome, safety won the day. As it should.\n\nIt's just a shame that, like with so many other things in life, it first must go very wrong for people to take it seriously.\n\nThere have been countless safety developments through the years, but freak accidents can always happen. In 2009 Felipe Massa was hit in the head with a bolt that came off Barrichello's car in front and he was in a coma for quite a while and nearly lost his eye. That could still happen with a halo, so it's never safe."", 'We’ll never know, because if they admit them they’re not allowed to race. Max Verstappen admitted to post concussive symptoms in 2021, but he admitted it this year - had he admitted it at the time he wouldn’t be medically cleared.\n\nWe do know that the former F1 drivers that we see don’t appear to have as high of a rate of dementia and parkinsons as former boxers do.', 'HANS device was a big improvement also.\xa0', 'Head injury from an airborn/upside down car has been rare in F1 for a while. Even before the the Halo, the Roll-Hoop prevented a drivers head from making direct contact with the ground.\n\nWhere we have seen head injuries are 2 main scenarios a) a loose flying object hits a driver. This happened to Massa in 2009 (suspension), and wasn’t uncommon in the 80s/90s (wheels/tires) but the wheel tethers largely eliminated that risk. Scenario b) is high G accidents without direct head impact. Even without direct impact a sudden stop will slam the brain into the skull hard enough to cause damage. This happened to Kubica in 2007 and Verstappen in 2021 and many more, but has become less dangerous with the HANS deviance and as crash structures on the car improve\n\nUnfortunately we will never have hard stats for this. Drivers are incentivized to keep symptoms secret or risk not being able to drive. It took untill last year for max to reveal that after the 2021 crash, he drove the rest of the season with blurred vision and concussion like symptoms, but didn’t tell the team because he couldn’t risk the championship', 'As many have already said, the HANS device has stopped the rag doll effect rather than the halo. HALO is primarily to stop items coming into the cockpit. HANS device stops the driver moving.', ""Maria de Villota suffered a head injury testing a Marussia, colliding with a truck's tailgate, also losing an eye. She was only going about 60 kph. She died over a year later (aged 34) with a a statement from her family claiming it was “a consequence of the neurological injuries she suffered, according to what the forensic doctor has told us.” ^[\\[ref\\]](https://braininjurygroup.co.uk/news/death-spanish-f1-driver-maria-de-villota-may-linked-existing-head-injury/)\n\nGiven the speed and point of collision, the halo almost certainly would've prevented injury and consequently her death.""]",5,19,0.6,5,18,18,2,2,0.010000000000000009,2

It got me wondering is there any actual evidence of constructors building cars for specific drivers?,"['No. Cars are built to be as fast as possible.\n\nThey may take feedback from one driver more seriously than the other when working on development - for example, Red Bull initially disregarded Perez’s opinion on an upgrade because Max continued to do well, but when things suddenly went wrong continuing down that path it turned out that what Perez had said had been correct, and they then had to try and go backwards to undo this upgrade.\n\nBut the base car itself isn’t built for one of the other. The upgrades aren’t ’driver X will like this’.', ""These arguments are usually made by someone who is a fan of the driver who is doing worse in a team and cannot accept they're doing badly."", 'I never understand these arguments.\nIf one driver is faster than the other and therefor knows the limitations of the car better, naturally engineers listen to their feedback more as it will be more accurate. That results in a faster car that that driver will be able to use to find the new limitations. But since the other driver wasn’t able to properly find the limits in the previous iteration they most certainly won’t be able to now.\n\nDoes that mean the car is only being developed for 1 driver? No it means one driver can adapt and improve more than the other. The car is just developed to be faster.', ""It is a myth.
