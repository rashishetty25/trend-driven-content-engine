1ibawuc,New focus on bending wings: no more progress with underbody upgrades? (amUs),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ibawuc/new_focus_on_bending_wings_no_more_progress_with/,2025-01-27, Technical,,"['Translation (credit to JunaidSamodien\\_ on the place we cannot link too anymore):\n\nDespite the improvement in lap times compared to 2023, the current cars have reached the end of their development, Adrian Newey believes ""It\'s in the nature of things. A ground-effect car without side-sealing skirts like in the 80s will always be prone to instability. You are looking for more and more underpressure under the car, but you always have to deal with leaks from the side. This generates downforce losses here and there, which are stronger the lower your car is.""\n\nThe engineers are therefore constantly navigating the conflict of producing as much downforce as possible while incurring as little instability as possible. In this compromise, many teams have now almost reached their limit.  \nEveryone fears harmful side effects in their development work, such as bouncing, fluctuating downforce, or balance shifts. With the exception of McLaren and Haas, everyone had at least one upgrade that had a negative effect.\n\nAdditionally, the field kept getting closer together. Only between the top 4 and the rest is there a larger gap of three to four tenths. At some point, everyone will encounter this conflict when improving the floor.  \nAnd when searching for the best compromise, the margins naturally become smaller and smaller. Newey adds: ""Both are a clear signal that we have already come quite close to the limit.""\n\nThe big topic at the moment is aeroelasticity. Since the regulations cannot prescribe absolutely rigid components, everyone is pushing the limits as far as the FIA tests allow.  \nMcLaren started with it and optimized the flexibility of certain aero parts. The team relied mainly on the expertise of Rob Marshall, who was previously very creative in this area at Red Bull. No one controlled the twisting of the front wing as well as McLaren.  \nAnd that is a trump card for the ground effect cars. Because the wing and its flaps are still in their normal position at low speeds, the driver feels the grip they need to steer in slow corners. The higher the speed, the more parts of the wing rotate backwards. This shifts the center of downforce backward, allowing the driver to rely on the rear sticking to the road in fast corners. This shift in balance creates confidence and brings lap time.\n\nThe teams also came up with tricks on the rear wing to reduce drag, especially with the DRS closed. McLaren bent the flaps upwards at the outer edges, Ferrari pulled the main element downwards. Both were banned. It harmed neither one nor the other in the long run.  \nMore important was the front wing. Mercedes was the first team to copy McLaren. Ferrari waited until after the summer break because they were afraid the FIA might quickly ban the trick. The development of a suitable wing is not trivial and costs money that one does not want to waste within the budget cap. Only when the FIA issued a statement on McLaren\'s front wing did Ferrari follow suit. Too late, as Vasseur remarked. Red Bull focused on lobbying against the flexible wings, which only succeeded with the rear wing.\n\nIn the second half of the season, more and more teams followed suit. Especially from the second half of the table. That\'s why cars like the Alpine and the Haas got closer to the top 4, and that\'s why Sauber also caught up with the field.  \nBecause the rules in this area are not supposed to be tightened in the last year of the existing regulations, one can assume that the field will come even closer together.\n\nBut research was also conducted in other places. The chassis engineers are always trying to design dampers and springs more progressively to keep the car stable in the best possible position at all speed ranges.  \nNewey says: ""Mechanics and aerodynamics must harmonize. This is especially true for ground-effect cars. Whoever doesn\'t manage that will ruin their tires in continuous operation.‚Äù', 'Imagine not having 4 but 6 teams fighting for wins!', 'I feel that with the cost cap in place, some regulation should be loosened. Both because teams can no longer throw money at the problem for marginal gains, but also because i think loosened rules might give team cheaper ways to improve performance.', 'Aston mid season upgrade is gonna rock, Newie will figure out a way to put them on top', 'This is fantastic. Thank you.', ""Thanks! What still isn't clear to me: Did RBR bring their variant of the flexi-frontwing last season or do they still have that gain to bring for 2025?"", ""They didn't. While they could have, cost cap restrictions and delays with rule clarification prevented them from doing so. (like how they never developed a 'Monza spec' rear wing) \n\nNothing's stopping them for this year and frankly it's shown to be so effective in widening the setup window you'd be foolish to ignore it.""]",69,8,0.92,69,45,45,-2,0,-0.010000000000000009,-2

1iazszl,F1 History Question: Head/Nec/CTE before the halo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iazszl/f1_history_question_headneccte_before_the_halo/,2025-01-27, Discussion,"I‚Äôve never posted here, and I‚Äôm going to discuss driver death and injury, so I‚Äôve used the NSFW tag per the rules. If I‚Äôm wrong on this just yell at me about it.

So I‚Äôm not exactly a new fan to F1 (I found it when I was trying to get clean in 2017/18 and it helped - a lot), but during this off season I wanted to go through and watch old races, learn history, etc. I‚Äôve kinda gone through what Netflix has to offer and I‚Äôve also watched a ton of YouTube and I‚Äôve got an F1 pro account and have for about five years or so now and have watched a ton on that.

Something that sticks out to me is the driver deaths and injuries pre-halo. Right now I‚Äôm watching ‚Äú20 Times F1 Cars Went Airborne‚Äù via the official f1 channel on YouTube and I am familiar with Senna and that‚Ä¶race at Imola (I have angry opinions on this. Very angry. I was 12 when he died and because F1 wasn‚Äôt really a thing here (US), I didnt see the race until recently. Fuck.)

I‚Äôm wondering, watching this footage and Senna and so many drivers before and after him, how many drivers ended up with CTE or other head/neck injuries before the halo was introduced? I know the halo isn‚Äôt a magical unicorn of less injuries, but watching drivers just look like he‚Äôs a rag doll when crashing is yikes.

","[""Because most safety measures only come up once something causes it to be brought up. Also, for more context, F1 came to be less than a decade after a world war, so people had a different concept of risk back then (same could probably be said of the grand prix drivers during the interbellum, having just come from the great war). So the result is that safety measures tended to develop at a snails pace, right until something major happens and/or someone raises a stink about it.\n\nThat said, prior to the halo (and after Senna's crash) the rule was that when drawing a line from the top of the roll hoop to the small bump in front of the steering wheel, the line should not intersect with the driver's head. This was in addition to the higher side protection around the drivers head."", 'I think CTE comes more as a result of repeated impacts to the head. This is common in American football and combat sports. While the individual impacts may not be as high in magnitude as a crash in F1, the repeated nature of these probably do more damage that may contribute to CTE.', 'One thing worth remembering is most head injuries/concussions in F1 over the last 30 years or so have come as a result of the severity of the crash and not because something entered the cockpit and hit the driver. Halo wouldn‚Äôt have helped in those cases. It‚Äôs the HANS device that has made the biggest difference in preventing concussion and whiplash injuries. \n\nSenna and Massa are the only two instances in F1, although there are cases in other series (Henry Surtees in F2, Justin Wilson in IndyCar) of fatalities due to debris striking a driver. It‚Äôs been proven that Bianchi wouldn‚Äôt have been helped by Halo because the forces the crash generated were too vast.\n\nThere are cases of drivers suffering long-term concussion effects. Luciano Burti suffered from seizures after his crash at Spa in 2001, while Dario Franchitti was forced to retire from IndyCar, but I‚Äôd say these are relatively rare.', 'It certainly happens but the halo has actually quite little to do with this protection. It protects against an impact in front of you but this isn‚Äôt a primary risk. Many more concussions and brain injury come from the head whipping around and sudden deceleration. A lot of credit goes to HANS which is quite a bit older than the halo. It primarily prevents your head from whipping around. It was implemented to prevent skull fracture deaths but most head and neck injuries are much less common with it. I‚Äôm not sure about senna, he had many factors add up but Ratzenberger who died a day earlier than Senna would likely have survived', 'We‚Äôll never know, because if they admit them they‚Äôre not allowed to race. Max Verstappen admitted to post concussive symptoms in 2021, but he admitted it this year - had he admitted it at the time he wouldn‚Äôt be medically cleared.\n\nWe do know that the former F1 drivers that we see don‚Äôt appear to have as high of a rate of dementia and parkinsons as former boxers do.', 'HANS device was a big improvement also.\xa0', 'Head injury from an airborn/upside down car has been rare in F1 for a while. Even before the the Halo, the Roll-Hoop prevented a drivers head from making direct contact with the ground.\n\nWhere we have seen head injuries are 2 main scenarios a) a loose flying object hits a driver. This happened to Massa in 2009 (suspension), and wasn‚Äôt uncommon in the 80s/90s (wheels/tires) but the wheel tethers largely eliminated that risk. Scenario b) is high G accidents without direct head impact. Even without direct impact a sudden stop will slam the brain into the skull hard enough to cause damage. This happened to Kubica in 2007 and Verstappen in 2021 and many more, but has become less dangerous with the HANS deviance and as crash structures on the car improve\n\nUnfortunately we will never have hard stats for this. Drivers are incentivized to keep symptoms secret or risk not being able to drive. It took untill last year for max to reveal that after the 2021 crash, he drove the rest of the season with blurred vision and concussion like symptoms, but didn‚Äôt tell the team because he couldn‚Äôt risk the championship', ""Maria de Villota suffered a head injury testing a Marussia, colliding with a truck's tailgate, also losing an eye. She was only going about 60 kph. She died over a year later (aged 34) with a a statement from her family claiming it was ‚Äúa consequence of the neurological injuries she suffered, according to what the forensic doctor has told us.‚Äù ^[\\[ref\\]](https://braininjurygroup.co.uk/news/death-spanish-f1-driver-maria-de-villota-may-linked-existing-head-injury/)\n\nGiven the speed and point of collision, the halo almost certainly would've prevented injury and consequently her death."", 'As many have already said, the HANS device has stopped the rag doll effect rather than the halo. HALO is primarily to stop items coming into the cockpit. HANS device stops the driver moving.', 'Probably the biggest advance in this space was the 2003 introduction of the HANS device which stops the drivers head moving around excessively during heavy (or even light) contact. Check out Hakkinen Adelaide 1995 for a good example for why it was introduced.']",7,28,0.56,7,169,169,1,0,0.010000000000000009,1

The Williams was definitely the fastest car on the balance of 2003 for me, but I also think the Ferrari was underrated - for me Michael had easily his weakest year as a title contender, while Barrichello was able to beat Raikkonen on merit in a good few races. I rate Barrichello as highly as anyone, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd have been able to beat the best Kimi in equal cars, so I do think there‚Äôs a case that McLaren and Ferrari were at least closely matched over the balance of 2003.\n\nThe 2012 Williams is the biggest waste of a competitive car I can think of. As pointed out elsewhere, Maldonado was highly erratic and while he looked fast in 2012, other years would really suggest he was flattered by the car and by his team-mate. Senna was woeful. Personally, I think Maldonado is a complete hooligan who should never have been allowed into F1 in the first place after his Monaco 2005 antics, and should have had his superlicense revoked the moment he took that swipe at Hamilton at Spa in 2011.', 'I think the 2003 McLaren definitely could have got more than two wins. Brazil is the obvious one they missed out on due to the red flag timing, and they would likely have won Nurburgring if not for reliability. Raikkonen also had quite a few close seconds (Imola, Monaco, Austria). Did the drivers maximise it? Not fully no, but they didn‚Äôt really underperform either. Raikkonen wasn‚Äôt as good in 2003 as 2004 or 2005, but he still put in a pretty strong season. Williams were the ones who really failed to maximise in 2003, they should have won both titles.\n\nWilliams 2012 is probably one of the most underdriven cars I can think of. Senna was just slow, and Maldonado was horribly error-prone (and looking at his career outside of 2012 I‚Äôm not convinced he was particularly fast either). They had the best car outside of the top four teams, but the worst driver lineup bar HRT. If they‚Äôd kept Barrichello for 2012, even though he was past his best he could‚Äôve got some decent results. With a top driver they could‚Äôve got more podiums for sure, and potentially one or two more wins. With the field being so close in 2012, even just a decent driver lineup could have propelled Williams up the order.']",5,35,0.69,5,51,51,-1,1,-0.020000000000000018,-1
