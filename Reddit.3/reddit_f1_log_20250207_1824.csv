I am writing a paper on how effective the FIA was in regard to safety advancements along the years. Something I cannot seem to find is why the FIA took so long for the HANS to be mandated and what caused that decision. Was it a specific accident? The HANS device was developed in the mid 1980s, but mandated in 2003. Any help is much appreciated! Also, if you know where to find that information (hopefully from a reputable source :) please let me know!!) Thank you!","['[https://www.thepitcrewonline.net/2018/07/30/safety-in-motorsports-week-the-hans-device/](https://www.thepitcrewonline.net/2018/07/30/safety-in-motorsports-week-the-hans-device/)\n\n*The Head and Neck System (more commonly referred to as the HANS device) is often overlooked in the world of modern Formula One. Its historical significance, though,\xa0should not be underestimated, not least because at the time of its introduction it was one of very, very few occasions in F1‚Äôs history up to that point where the FIA had reacted to a non-fatal accident. The accident in question occurred at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, hosted at the popular Adelaide circuit. At one of the fastest points on the track, a rapid tyre deflation sent Mika Hakkinen ‚Äì then in his third season in F1 ‚Äì hurtling into the barriers. The impact was so extreme that his neck hyperextended, his skull was fractured, he swallowed his tongue, and he suffered major internal bleeding. He spent over two months in hospital ‚Äì a significant amount of that in intensive care ‚Äì but he eventually made a full recovery and returned to F1 for the 1996 season.*\n\nThe crash: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwVpVLDWG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwVpVLDWG8)', 'Not specific to F1 but the HANS device was quite unpopular amongst drivers for a long time. A couple of factors for drivers not liking it was because it was easy to get the fit and setup wrong, which would cause the wearer major discomfort, and that it pins the driver down more than seatbelts alone, something that many drivers disliked. Dale Earnhardt Sr., who lost his life to a basilar skull fracture, the very injury that the HANS device is meant to prevent, famously referred to it as ‚Äúthat damned noose‚Äù and complained that it restricted his range of motion and limited his competitive advantage. His death was one of many, but arguably the most high profile, that led to the HANS becoming mandatory in major racing series.', 'If you‚Äôre writing a paper on FIA safety then I hope you‚Äôre including a section on Prof. Sid Watkins and all he did for the sport.', ""The HANS device was possibly accelerated by the death of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, considered one of the sport's all-time legends on a level akin to Senna, dying in a crash that was completely survivable if the the device was equipped; the sport made it available to drivers, but he utterly detested it, throwing it out of the car on every opportunity, until the largest race of the year, the Daytona 500 in 2001, when, on the final lap, he died in front of an audience of millions - this caused NASCAR to mandate it and quite possibly accelerated the moves of sanctioning bodies worldwide."", ""The hans is uncomfortable, and even distracting to drivers sometimes. It's not a natural feeling to have your head tied to your chest. Some drivers even rallied that it would be dangerous. \n\nYou should look into Rubens Barrichello who had actually received special permission to forgo the Hans even after it was mandated. He only ran a single race in Australia 2003 before the FIA cracked down and told him either wear it, or they'd find a driver that would.\n\nAnd don't forget to mention, Dale Sr wasn't the only driver to suffer a deadly injury that the HANS would have protected from, there is also Roman Ratzenberger, Adam Petty, Blaise Alexander (who was fatally injured 7 months AFTER Earnhardt and was Nascars real final straw)"", ""Safety isn't sexy.\xa0\n\n\nThe Halo was pretty widely condemned as ugly, but this has since been shut down by several instances where the driver was clearly saved by it, most famously Romain Grosjean.\xa0\n\n\nTyre tethers were only added after the death of Ayrton Senna. Marshals had been killed prior to this by bouncing tyres.\xa0\n\n\nJackie Stewart is a good person to look at for championing safety in motor sport. There was a time when a few deaths per year was just what happened."", 'For the same reasons that it took years to even develop the Halo, despite the calls that were made immediately after the death of Henry Surtees; far too many people clinging to the bizarre notion of making the sport ""too safe"", plus aesthetic concerns and the fact it wasn\'t particularly comfortable.', ""Karting doesn't mandate neck braces, still at least in UK. Our daughter always wore one (a motorcross one) but it wasn't seen as a 'cool kid' thing & most stopped as they got older. This cool kid attitude to safety needs to be stopped in F1 & down through the levels of motorsport."", 'Not-Invented-Here\n\n  \nIIRC, it was invented by Jim Downing (IMSA Kudzu Mazda fame) and a colleague.', 'Sports and humans in general are reluctant to change.\n\nF1 drivers in late 1980s and early 1990s had grown up seeing how much more dangerous F1 had been in 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, and were still willing to accept the risks and enter the sport. By the time they enter, F1 had become safer than what they were already willing to accept, so its not big issue for most of them.\n\nDont forget our bodies are millions of years old. Back in the wery olden days, most answers to problems would have been found from the elders and the past, and doing what you have always done has kept you alive.

1ijyjlf,Groter 'window' voor nieuwe auto Verstappen en Lawson of niet? Red Bull legt uit | T: Bigger 'window' for Verstappen and Lawson's new car or not? Red Bull explains,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ijyjlf/groter_window_voor_nieuwe_auto_verstappen_en/,2025-02-07, News,,"[""I feel like there is a bit of underestimation going on with Red Bull due to the drop in form. Red Bull's struggles seemed very specific and were identified by the team around Monza weekend. This isn't like Mercedes where it took them several years to even work out what was wrong with the car. I'm not saying 2025 will be a guaranteed success but they shouldn't be written off."", ""Tl;dr\n\nPierre Wach√© discusses Red Bull's challenge in balancing car performance and setup flexibility. The RB20 had a narrow setup window-when dialed in, it performed well, but any deviation led to a big drop in performance. While Red Bull aims to expand the RB21's setup window, Wach√© warns that doing so can reduce overall potential. Instead of prioritizing ease of setup for engineers, the focus is on consistently finding the optimal setup for each circuit. Some compromises may be made to help drivers extract performance, but not at the cost of outright speed."", 'It would be more interesting if he‚Äôd expand a bit on how peak potential and the size of the operating window are correlated. It‚Äôs easy to see that you could theoretically find gains under very specific circumstances, but there must be methods to gauge how specific those circumstances are allowed to be.', 'ü™ü', 'Translation by google:\n\nPierre Wach√© explains the dilemma between a larger set-up window and pure potential in Formula 1. According to the technical director, it is more about Red Bull being able to find the ideal window on every circuit in 2025.\n\nWith the Austin update package, Red Bull Racing  took a step in the right direction last year. Max Verstappen won the sprint race at the Circuit of the Americas and added triumphs in Qatar and Brazil, although it should be noted that the latter victory was mainly due to the rain. However, the race weekends from Austin onwards have shown a pattern: Red Bull seemed to be cautiously on the right track again, but it was a balancing act on a fine line. This was evident in Qatar, for example, where Red Bull was unable to compete during the sprint race, but was suddenly able to triumph on Sunday.\n\nLess potential with a larger setup window?\n\nIt shows that the RB20\'s setup window was very small. If Red Bull could find the so-called \' sweet spot \' of the car, the speed was there, but the drop-off was big if the setup fell outside the acceptable margins. Team principal Christian Horner and top advisor Helmut Marko have already stated that the RB21\'s setup window must be larger than that of its predecessor. ""As a dream you want that of course, but you know that the overall potential decreases if you increase the window,"" technical director Pierre Wach√© said in an exclusive interview with Motorsport.com. \n\n‚ÄúIf you look at other teams‚Äô cars and how they‚Äôre positioned, they‚Äôre all insanely stiff. What you want is to produce the fastest car, but it‚Äôs not the case that a car is slow because the window in which it operates is small.‚Äù According to the engineering chief, one aspect is more important than how big a car‚Äôs set-up window is: being able to find that window ‚Äì however small. ‚ÄúWhat you want is to be in the right window for each circuit, so that you can anticipate that. If you can achieve that, why would you want to extend the window and flatten the overall potential of a car?‚Äù\n\n""You want the fastest car compared to the others. I will not reduce the overall potential to make it easier operationally. You can reduce the potential to help drivers to use the car, but not to help engineers to use the car.""\n\nFinding a balance between potential and usability\nWith those last words, Wach√© touches on a crucial point: the technical director is willing to reduce the potential a little bit to ensure that drivers can get the most out of it ‚Äì which has already happened to some extent with the Austin package ‚Äì but not to make it easier for engineers to find the set-up window. ‚ÄúThe most important thing is that you are always looking for ways to make the car faster and at the same time ensure that drivers can get the most out of it. In 2023 we proved that our direction was correct, because we were faster than the others. Last year showed us that we were not correct then. It is always about finding a balance between the balance of a car and its overall potential. We have to solve that question for next season.‚Äù', 'I understand what he means, but the risk of _not_ finding the window and dropping major points is killing in a season. Max has been complaining about the tricky setup for months and months before they started paying attention. Plus having both drivers being able to keep the car on track would be a welcome surprise for the team.', 'the ego of these fucking number crunching engineers to not listen to the guys actually piloting these cars is insane', 'And a 4 time champion at that']",0,9,0.41,0,8,8,0,2,-0.010000000000000009,0
