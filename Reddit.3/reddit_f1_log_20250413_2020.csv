• This time last season 3 teams (Alpine, Williams and Sauber) still had 0 points.

• If every team gets to 13 points this will break 2023's record for the most points the team in last has scored. I would say this is a very achievable goal for every team bar Sauber, who may need another chaotic race like Australia to score high.

1jxr5mn,PIAvNOR: Finding 4 tenths of a second.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jxr5mn/piavnor_finding_4_tenths_of_a_second/,2025-04-12, Technical,"Approaching T1, NOR lifts later, but PIA brakes later. Thus, PIA gets a better exit, and builds more speed through the T2&3 combination. When coming to T4, PIA lifts earlier and more gradual, coming to 0% at nearly the same point as NOR, who, brakes earlier and longer. Coming at nearly the same speed to the S-Combination of T5/6/7. Before T6, PIA brakes earlier, allowing for a better exit and not having to lift-off as much as NOR through T7. Approach to T8 is nigh identical, but PIA was earlier back on the throttle and NOR had to feather for a moment, costing him a bit of speed. Coming to the Tilke-Special of T9/10, NOR lifts later again and PIA brakes later, again. PIA gets a slightly better exit, capping at a higher top speed before T11. There, PIA lifts later, which lets NOR have a better exit and gaining back a bit on PIA. But T13: PIA lifts and brakes later, carrying more speed into the corner and having a slightly worse exit as NOR. T14 doesn't shake anything up, yet again, PIA lifts way earlier and more gradual than NOR, who is also braking earlier and longer.

Conclusion: Difficult. Their respective car control is remarkably similar. PIA brakes later and finds better exits, having overall a bit more confidence in the car. The approaches to T4 and T14 are quite extreme, with PIA starting to lift-off 90 and 60 metres, respectively, earlier than NOR (if the data of FastF1 is to be trusted). My guess: After seeing the live delta to PIA on his dash after T3, NOR went all in, staying on the throttle longer than usual, thus paying with worse exits, which cost him even more time. And if I may delve into the crystal ball: NOR was standing in his own way, starting to drive with a clenched jaw upon glancing at the live delta inbetween T3&4. Probably cost him the front row.","['Oh my days. Actual analysis instead of “mentality” talk.

1jy2ugp,McLaren's High Downforce Setup vs. Cooler Late-Race Temperatures and Safety Cars in Bahrain,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jy2ugp/mclarens_high_downforce_setup_vs_cooler_laterace/,2025-04-13, Discussion,"While it's likely Piastri and Norris will have a pace advantage at the start, this delta will be smaller as track temperatures decrease towards the end of the race, and with their high downforce setup (shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jxn93v/fdataanalysis_no_driver_had_a_lower_top_speed/)) a late safety car might put them under pressure. 

I had a look at the history of safety cars in Bahrain. I didn't investigate why the data is so skewed, but we hardly saw the safety car for over a decade, and have seen it almost every year since 2017, including three times in each of the COVID double-headers here. 

Going by the most recent data, we will most likely see one, either late or early. If degradation is high enough for 2 stops, and there's a late safety car neutralising the field on equal tyres, the McLarens might be in trouble. 

Of course historical data is not predictive, but is this a risk, and is it one they needed to take?
