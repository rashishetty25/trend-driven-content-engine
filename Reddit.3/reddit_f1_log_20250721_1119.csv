Ferrari drove with Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi.



Some of the photos were made during the pit walkabout.

The photos from the cars on track were made from the inside of the track at Eau Rouge/Raidillon from the top of a building.

1m5dzlu,The F1 movie from the perspective of an F1 fan versus someone who doesn't know the sport,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m5dzlu/the_f1_movie_from_the_perspective_of_an_f1_fan/,2025-07-21, Discussion,"I recently saw the F1 movie together with a buddy of mine who is really not into motorsports or any kind - but it's an avid movie watcher (and can be a fairly tough critic). 

I'll try not to spoil anything, but it was very interesting how different our experiences were. 

As someone who has been watching F1 since the late 90s, it was a really mixed bag. Like a long advertisement for F1, where they pretty much threw a bunch of money at some grad A artists and hoped for the best. To be fair, everyone was really professional (Bardem absolutely kills it as usual, Kerry Condon steals most of the scenes she's in), and the imagery on the track is fantastic. But the way they insert F1 personalities and elements, felt really artificial, and more like a caricature of F1. 


However, my friend loved the movie. Without any prior F1 knowledge, he was glued to the screen, and he was really impressed by the whole atmosphere and the feeling of speed from the cars. He says it reminded him of Top Gun Maverick (which is a fair comparison, given how much in-car footage there is). It also helped a lot that they do a good job explaining the more technical terms of the sport. 

TL;DR: the movie succeeds in making F1 interesting for the average viewer that's out of the loop, but it might be a mixed bag if you know a thing or two about the sport.","['I have been watching F1 since 1992 and I am just happy they filmed a big movie about the sport that I love.\xa0\n\n\nIt is inaccurate and sometimes unrealistic, but I can watch any race for accuracy and realism - this one is pure enjoyment for me. Entertainment.', ""Yeah, that'll always be the case with whatever the subject of a movie is.\n\nI'm sure that in a bunch of science based films that I enjoy, someone who knows the subject matter is going to be a little bit irked at the contents of the film.\n\nIt's a piece of fiction that has a ton of high profile cameos. Enjoy it for what it is."", ""Basically what everyone has said so far. It's made to bring new fans to the sport rather than to cater to the niche hardcore/veteran F1 fanbase. Documentaries exist for the latter."", 'I enjoyed it, but had to leave my F1 head outside. Definitely a film for non/casual F1 fans.', 'My dad been a fan since the 70s and he loved it. So did I. Its a film, a lot of rules wont apply. As someone who loves history as well, you have no idea how much Braveheart and Gladiator messed up and they are still so highly regarded and rightly so. They are fantastic movies.\n\nRocky makes a mockery of boxing and it won an Oscar. The F1 movie is obviously not on that level, but it was a fun 2 hour romp. I will definitely rewatch it soon.', 'One thing that I particularly disliked about the movie is that they never showed quali. Like, how? There are tons of amazing scenes you could do using quali and they just never brought it up once? Just a waste.', ""I split my appreciation in two. My general film enjoyer side appreciated it as a cool fun blockbuster. My F1 fan side just found a lot of it pretty funny with things like the Hungary crashfest or Toto's cameo"", 'Top Gun Maverick and the F1 Movie had the same director which goes some way to feeling that comparison.', "" best scene in the F1 movie wasn't related to F1 at all""]",634,192,0.91,634,172,172,337,80,0.010000000000000009,337
