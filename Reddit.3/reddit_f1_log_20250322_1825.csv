When you are on the outside, you‚Äôd obviously feel you could do better than anyone who‚Äôs in that dreaded second RB seat, but the reality is harsh, isn‚Äôt it ?

Max doesn‚Äôt seem to be overly fond of the balance  and pace of the car and I think it‚Äôs only going to get worse from here for Liam. As development and upgrades come in I expect the car to get father away from Liam as Max‚Äôs feedback will be more aggressive and in the direction that he likes.

I‚Äôm now inclined to believe that since Checo had so much more experience, we was able to nudge the development of the car in a more neutral way during the season break and used to be more comfortable with the car, often matching Max on pace in the earlier parts of the season. With Liam, with his inexperience it can‚Äôt imagine him having any say in the development direction and hence will feel more and more uncomfortable with the car as the season progresses.

It‚Äôs an unfortunate situation to be in, but I honestly don‚Äôt see him surviving a full season as it stands.

What do you guys think? ","[""Remember how we said last year to swap Checo asap because his replacement couldn't possibly do a worse job? Lmao."", ""Lawson would be better in VCARB. Redbull definitely have a 2nd car problem. Albon's analogy on the Redbull car being computer mouse on highest sensitivity is on point. It's fast if you can take advantage of it, which Max can.

They really should fear the day he announces his departure. Checo last year barely made it out of Q1 and Q2, now Liam is dead last in all three qualifyings, and I am sure he did not forget how to drive a car all of a sudden."", ""I don't agree, only because it really can't get worse."", ""Max is an incredibly skilled driver. I believe that the car's set up is just not ideal for most drivers. If the four time world champion struggles to reach the top with current car, Liam has no chance of getting anywhere near Max's performance. \n\nFor the sake of Liam's mental health, I do hope he stays away from social media or at least reading comments about him online. I would not trade place with him, that's for sure."", ""Thing is; if they swap him for Tsunoda or Hadjar, I can't see things changing that much. Hadjar or Tsunoda may get into Q2 more frequently and perhaps Q3 but a front-row lockout for Red Bull is basically impossible at this stage"", ""I know most of us want Yuki or any other experienced driver on that seat. But this is definitely on RB's top management. \n\nAlthough Liam tries to be stoic or even toxic, I don't think he's all that. He seemed starstruck when Max is around on DTS. Pretty sure his facial reaction isn't scripted. He's a kid trying to compete in F1. Of course, he'll go for the top seat. Any driver would.\n\nHe was in way over his head. And so is RB. They already had a track record of failing junior drivers in early RB promotions. They know Max is the exemption. They know they became more competitive with an experienced #2 adjusting rather than learning anew. \n\nSo promoting Liam must have had an action plan that considered their previous failures OR continue on giving that seat to experience. Even if they didn't like Yuki, there were other choices. I mean that's RB. No one would be mega-surprised if they chose externally. \n\nIt's definitely too soon to tell but Liam is already losing his mind. The top brass needs to give him a vocal support, internally and externally. I don't think a 5-race plan is generous enough. That sounds more like an excuse to throw the mistake's weight onto the driver and not on the team."", ""Checo was only really able to sort of match Max when the car had significant understeer, which basically limits what you can do with the car. So it equalises the drivers, but if one driver can go faster with less understeer it's an easy performance gain. Max's approach to racing is genuinely faster because oversteer itself is faster than understeer all other things equal\n\n  \nIf Lawson can't figure out how to drive the car as it is I think he just gets dropped. Really unfortunate but they aren't going to induce more understeer and make the car slower when they already way behind McLaren"", 'I somewhat agree. I think it‚Äôs going to get worse for Liam because there‚Äôs only so much they can do on this 2025 car without compromising the development of the 2026 car. I just hope that the powers that be listen to Liam and consider his feedback for the 2026 car, or else this issue is going to continue, and whoever is next in the car is going to have similar issues where the car is literally designed for the only person that seemingly can drive the car at a good pace.']",635,454,0.88,635,414,414,139,35,0.0,139

Helmut Marko heads up the Red Bull young driver programme, and in recent years has overseen the decline of an academy that brought through Vettel, Ricciardo, Sainz and Verstappen into one that has produced one race win since 2018 (Gasly‚Äôs at Monza in 2020). Meanwhile, other academies have brought through Leclerc, Russell, Norris and Piastri with far greater success and this season has seen Antonelli, Bearman and Bortoleto all graduate to F1 through other teams as well. 

Where Red Bull were once the undisputed number ones at bringing through young talents, they‚Äôve been usurped by Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren and have reached a point where the only realistic alternatives for their second seat are to stick with Lawson or promote Tsunoda or Hadjar with the likely end result being another driver that gets taken to the cleaners by Max.

As much as people enjoy beating up on and memeing Max‚Äôs teammates, the truth is that if Marko had done his job and not spent the last few years failing to identify the better junior talents, or given them more time to develop before throwing them in at the deep end, they wouldn‚Äôt be in the position where their second seat has turned into a carousel of underperforming drivers. 

In a sport where we regularly see drivers, team principals, engineers and designers lose their jobs for failing to perform, it‚Äôs amazing that Marko hasn‚Äôt come under any scrutiny himself given that ultimately, he is the one responsible for finding and developing the drivers that are failing to deliver for Red Bull. Gasly, Albon and no doubt soon to be Lawson are merely collateral damage as a result of his failures.","['Marko used to be able to sign whoever he wanted because Red Bull used to entirely fund drivers juniors career - in exchange they had them on 5 year option contracts. \n\nThis is no longer the case, so they no longer have the pick of the litter, plus they still stick the 5 year option contracts on which make them more unattractive.', 'I‚Äôm not a fan of Marko because of his views and how he talks - but the RB young driver program has had a lot of good drivers come out of it. How many are flourishing in other teams right now? It just seems no one can stay close to Max.', 'Why? Helmut brought good drivers to the team: Yuki, Gasly, Albon are all great drivers and he promoted them to RB or rb seats. Lawson also a good driver, he already proved that in the Visa Rb. I dont think it is Marco‚Äôs fault that Red Bull is requiring something extra as well to be able to competitive in that second seat.', ""Verstappen, Sainz, Albon, Gasly, Tsunoda, Lawson, Hadjar.. I don't know why RB always gets shit for it when it gives far more opportunities than any other team on the grid."", 'What pressure?  He‚Äôs 180 years old. He‚Äôll retire anytime. This is Horners problem. His leadership is obviously having a big impact on the teams performance.', 'Many might consider this to be a hot take: Yes, the car is hard to drive, Lawson has to improve a lot and Red Bull **was** quite ruthless with their drivers, BUT - Right now, the internet/commentators are the ones who put Lawson under this immense pressure, call for (or discuss) his immediate replacement and write him off, not Red Bull.\n\nAs far as it concerns me, almost anybody will struggle with this car.', ""Having a shitty car which seems incredible hard to drvie is not the responsibility of Helmut Marko. Firing him doesn't make the car better"", 'People really ignore how hard is it nowadays to get promising drivers to their academies, RedBull were the first to do a proper academy and it showed with Vettel,Kvyat,Albon,Gasly,Ricciardo,Sainz , even Buemi Hartley Vergne went on to have great careers outside F1 \n\nNowadays all drivers who go on to reach F1 from F3 are signed to a team, Antonelli got signed in Karting if I remember correctly, Norris, Russell, Piastri all did F3 as academy members of Mclaren Merc and Alpine \n\nIt‚Äôs impossible to hoard that much talent nowadays because there 5 other teams promising a better promotion scheme to every upcoming driver', 'I think this is more on the car building side. Even Max is struggling with it. Had they not made such a difficult car to drive, who knows how Lawson would perform. They need to get some updates in asap to fix the issues or they risk not only the championships but possibly ruining another drivers career. No one else can do what Max does. They need to accept that and make the car better.']",535,213,0.78,535,199,199,190,25,0.020000000000000018,190

Sergio P√©rez had been with Red Bull Racing for almost three and a half years, when he suddenly started to fall off. The average gap between him and Max Verstappen in dry qualifying sessions between Imola and Abu Dhabi last year was 0.638 seconds - I'm not counting Silverstone, because P√©rez had only set one slow banker before spinning out, and I'm going with their lap times from Q3 if P√©rez made Q3 or with their lap times from the session in which P√©rez was eliminated.

The gap between Liam Lawson and Verstappen in qualifying for China today was 0.750 seconds and Lawson is only in his second race weekend with the team, and not his sixtieth or seventienth race weekend. That's a difference of just 0.750-0.638=0.112 seconds between P√©rez and Larson then. Because the field seems even closer now than it did in 2024, the same margin of sixth or seven tenths now costs a driver more positions.

Lawson is getting a lot of slander and people are immediately calling onto Red Bull to put Yuki Tsunoda in the seat alongside Verstappen, but let's be frank here. Tsunoda would not be doing any better, if he were with Red Bull Racing. You can't tell me Pierre Gasly who is now seen as a major talent for Alpine, Alexander Albon who is clearly the best driver Williams has had in many years, Sergio P√©rez who pulled off many miracles with midfielders Sauber and Force India, and Liam Lawson who is known for having been quick in many completely different cars throughout his career, are all *awful* drivers. Lawson and Tsunoda were consistently equal on pace at AlphaTauri in 2023 and at VCARB in 2024. You can't tell me Lawson's talent has just evaporated over the past winter.

A gap this relatively big can't be down to just the driver. Listen to everything Verstappen has said about the car in the last half of 2024 and now in 2025. The Red Bull car is slow and uncomfortable to drive.","['Yeah true to a certain extent. It also helped Gasly / Albon as there was a much bigger gap between top three teams and the rest. \n\nAlso made charging through the field a lot easier because you essentially need a 0.6-9s a lap advantage to pass often.', 'I would\'ve called the ""car is undrivable"" rumour BS if it wasn\'t for when Red Bull finally admitted last year that the car already had issues back in Spain 2023 but they ignored Checo\'s feedback of the car because Max was dominating.\n\nSo not did they only ignored feedback, they also continuously hound on their 2nd driver instead of trying to make improvements to their car. Add on another fact that Red Bull, especially Helmut Marko, constantly relies on Max outdriving the car every weekend to get results with the ""Verstappen factor"" nonsense. Yes, Max is quick and consistent, but he is not god.\n\nThat team may as well be called ""Oracle Verstappen F1 Team"".', 'So, when is max getting promoted to RB, and who has to be dropped to red bull?', 'No that was actually more a case for Perez. Best example of that was Monaco qualifying last year, where he got knocked out of Q1 while being ""just"" 2 and a half tenths down on Max\'s time (this is not to say Perez wasn\'t performing horribly tho. He absolutely did, especially near the end of the year)\n\nEven accounting for the more closed up grid, the gap Lawson is losing to Max by is incredibly damning. What was it - almost a second between them? And the bigger problem is that, at least based on observations it is much worse in actual race pace\n\nStill, it\'s only been two races on the tracks he has not driven yet. It doesn\'t look good and the trend points to his immediate capitulation and collapse within that seat, but there is a relatively strong possibility he will perform better in Japan, it being a track he has on track experience with', 'I think what would be really interesting is to see max on another team. The combo of him being a generational driver and his extreme style / red bulls complete focus on him makes it difficult to judge.', 'Yes, and the fact that Red Bull is entering this season already on their back foot, I would be shocked if he makes it even 5 races in if he doesn‚Äôt start delivering points now.', ""Perez started out well with all his experience coming into red bull, but even that wasn't keeping him up there. It is coming to a point that if you're not Max driving the car, whether or not it is because of car being designed for him or him being able to drive around issues, you're not going to be up the top charts often enough.\xa0\n\n\nWe have seen Liam within Yuki's performances in the sister team, so it's not like he's Sargeant or even Mazepin level. Red Bull doesn't dare try their hands on a considered top driver, whether that is political or knowing they have a car fundamental issue."", 'Atleast my man is consistent', 'Lawson not being able to extract performance from the car does not make the car slow.']",190,67,0.79,190,59,59,15,3,0.0,15

1jh9iln,[AMuS] Verstappen window too small for Lawson,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jh9iln/amus_verstappen_window_too_small_for_lawson/,2025-03-22, News,,"['Translation:\n\n\n> Max Verstappen and Liam Lawson are driving at two different ends of the Formula 1 grid. That won\'t change even with a different number two. Verstappen is too good, and Red Bull\'s operating window is too narrow.\n\n> What could Sergio Perez have been thinking at home on his couch in Guadalajara? Max Verstappen is currently burying his next Formula 1 teammate. The Chinese GP demonstrates Red Bull\'s full dilemma. Max Verstappen is at the front of the field, Liam Lawson at the back.\n\n> The numbers show it all. In the sprint qualifying (March 21), the world champion finished second, his teammate 20th. In qualifying for the main race, Verstappen finished fourth and Lawson last again. The gap between the two was an average of one second. Even though Lawson is new to the team and still learning, the gap is too large. The seat in the second Red Bull will likely remain the hot seat in Formula 1.\n\n> Voices are already being raised again that the New Zealander could soon be demoted to Toro Rosso, and Yuki Tsunoda could be promoted to the A team instead. In Shanghai, sporting director Helmut Marko used words we\'ve heard before before internal driver reshuffles. ""Lawson isn\'t delivering what we expect from him. We\'ll have to analyze this carefully. Everyone at Red Bull knows: For us, performance is what counts.""\n\n> Tsunoda also fails to solve Red Bull‚Äôs problem. Yuki Tsunoda may be in the form of his life, but even he wouldn\'t change much about the situation at Red Bull. He might be three-tenths closer to Verstappen, but he would suffer more mentally in the medium term than the still-fresh Lawson. And the same would happen to Isack Hadjar, Ayumu Iwasa, or Arvid Lindblad. Their careers would be over before they even began.\n\n> Red Bull must recognize that there\'s no ideal driver alongside Verstappen. Not in the current configuration. The Dutchman is too good and the car too bad. The RB21 still exhibits the weaknesses of its predecessor, perhaps a little less pronounced and a little easier to conceal. However, it still loses balance quickly, behaves differently from corner to corner, and therefore puts more strain on the tires.\n\n> Window too small for two drivers\nThe car has a tiny working window. Setting up the car is like a doctoral thesis. Verstappen and his technical crew usually hit the mark at some point. Sometimes sooner, sometimes later. Sometimes precisely, sometimes less precisely. But when it matters, the four-time Formula 1 World Champion is there, getting the most out of his package. Or he works around the problems that can\'t be solved.\nHis teammate has a doubly difficult time. Even if he could set up the car perfectly, he would be slower than Verstappen. However, he usually hits the window less often and less accurately. Because his window is probably somewhere else entirely. Perez always explained it like this: ""Then I would feel comfortable in the car, but it would be slower."" Red Bull would have to find a driver who demands exactly the same from the car as their star driver. Lando Norris would be one of them, but he wouldn\'t trade his McLaren for a Red Bull these days.\n\n> Lawson is no different than Perez. The new man in the second Red Bull admitted after another qualifying setback: ""The window of the car is extremely small. I can\'t find it. That\'s why I don\'t have 100 percent confidence in the car. I don\'t have the time to understand the car better."" We\'ve heard something similar from his predecessor before.\n\n> Where would Verstappen be in the Toro Rosso?\nAs long as the technical department can\'t build a Formula 1 car that\'s both docile and fast, Red Bull will remain a one-man team. It makes no sense to send other drivers from the pool into a battle they can\'t win. That would only burn out more drivers. The young drivers have one advantage over last year\'s solution: They\'re all cheaper than Perez.\nLawson probably secretly wishes he could get back to the Toro Rosso. The VCARB02 is the better car at the moment. Isack Hadjar was only two-tenths behind Verstappen. The same was true of Yuki Tsunoda in Melbourne.\n\n> If the Red Bull continues to prove to be a fickle car and its sister car from Toro Rosso proves to be a hit, then a completely different question soon arises: Would Verstappen have a better chance of defending his title in the B team? He wouldn\'t be the first driver to become world champion in two different cars. Juan-Manuel Fangio began the 1954 season with Maserati and finished it with Mercedes.\n\n> Two things stand in the way of this currently still audacious idea. Red Bull\'s potential to further develop its car is greater than Toro Rosso\'s due to its manpower and infrastructure. And without Verstappen, Red Bull would slip so far back in the Constructors\' Championship that it would cost the racing team a massive amount of money in terms of payouts from the rights holders.', 'When Marko talks about :"" For us, performance is what counts"", doe he include the design and engineering teams? Year after year they keep producing and running those cars, at some point they should be held accountable for their characteristics.', ""That's a belter of an article from AMuS, and a huge dilemma for Red Bull and also for Max."", 'During the quali, one of the commentators talked how Max likes loaded front and loose rear. That style of driving can be challenging. \n\nMany others prefer planted rear. Especially at slow corners, they steer a little strongly. The car turns when the fronts bite. For it to work you need some understeer and a stable rear. \n\nThe car that Max likes swings the rear more. That makes it pretty uncomfortable for the other driver.\n\nAnother thing visible in one lap analysis of Liam vs Max is that Liam  is braking too late. The footage from the car showed he was way too far from the apex of many curves. This again can be due to not being used to rear not pressing down hard. \n\nIt would be fun to compare how Lewis or Oscar drove Shanghai to Liam and Max.', 'i hope Max leaves Red bull and red bull falls flat on their face and maybe try making their environment slightly less toxic', ""Yuki said he wants it for Suzuka. Just do it. Give him the chance but dont give a guarantee.\n\nThe biggest problem i have with Red Bull's approach has been their inflexibility given their options. If you make it clear to your drivers they can go up or down more freely, then you can do that without damaging confidence too much. I get Checo would undoubtedly have a contract that wouldnt let him go to toro rosso but all their drivers bar max right now wont. Dont leave Liam in the frying pan. Get him out of there and let Yuki have a go, if it doesnt work. You can flip them back and Liam will have had a chance to reflect"", 'Very good article. Red Bull for sure is failing to make a car that is fast but suits a good amount of drivers. Ferrari, McLaren and this year probably even Mercedes did that. For those teams it is the rare occurance that the gap between their drivers is bigger than half a second. For Red Bull it is the other way around. Yes there still is the Verstappen factor. He is probably the best for a while now. But not by over half a second. A Russell, Norris, Piastri, Leclerc or Hamilton all could get within 2 tenths most of the time. On occasion beating him. A Lawson with his skill should be able to get within 3 tenths most of the time. Which is a world between teammates already. For me it is clear that it is at this point a simple car problem. And I am afraid that it is not an easy one to fix.', ""why is lawson trying to break in through max's window?"", ""> If the Red Bull continues to prove to be a fickle car and its sister car from Toro Rosso proves to be a hit, then a completely different question soon arises: Would Verstappen have a better chance of defending his title in the B team?

The Mercedes driver is a prime example of the thin air at the top of Formula 1. The Silver Arrows are sensing a glimmer of hope.\n\n> Three sessions had already been completed on this Grand Prix weekend in China. Then it was George Russell\'s turn. In qualifying (March 22), the Mercedes driver conjured up a fabulous lap on the freshly laid asphalt of the Shanghai International Circuit, raising eyebrows among Formula 1 experts and fans alike.\n\n> Where did that come from? That was the question on everyone\'s mind. Mercedes had consistently finished in the top ten during the second Formula 1 weekend of the 2025 season, but based on previous impressions, few had expected a front-row start. In the sprint qualifying (March 21), Russell finished fifth, while his teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli raced from P7 into the sprint on Saturday morning (March 22).\n\n> In the end, the Mercedes drivers finished fourth and seventh. Not bad, but nothing earth-shattering either. Until qualifying, the main topics were Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari), Lando Norris and his mistakes in the McLaren, and Max Verstappen\'s daring performances in the Red Bull. There was barely any room for the former Formula 1 dominators, until the final lap of qualifying.\n> George Russell himself was surprised by the stroke of genius he had achieved in the closing seconds. ""I don\'t think anyone expected to challenge the McLarens. Third place would have been a good result, so second place is a great result,"" the Mercedes spearhead rejoiced.\n\n> Toto Wolff optimistic for the China race. His team boss, Toto Wolff, was equally enthusiastic about his prot√©g√©\'s performance in a Sky interview: ""George is one of the absolute fastest drivers in the field ‚Äì if you give him the right car."" Russell delivered when it counted. A trait necessary in this tight Formula 1 world to score big points.\n\n> Wolff also believes that despite the high tire wear in Shanghai, Mercedes has a lot in store. Last year, the Silver Arrows suffered in the high temperatures. However, the W16\'s operating window has expanded. The good starting position could therefore help Mercedes. Wolff explained: ""If you take Lewis (Hamilton) out of the sprint, almost all the cars were equally fast and had similar tire wear.""\n\n> Nevertheless, the McLarens of pole-sitter Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, who will start from P3, are the favorites heading into the Chinese Grand Prix. Wolff agrees. ""We expect the McLarens to be strong, while the Ferraris had the edge in this morning\'s sprint. We\'ll start from P2 and try to assert ourselves at the beginning. Then we\'ll see where we end up.""\n\n> Antonelli dissatisfied with eighth place. George Russell performed brilliantly in qualifying. His rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli, on the other hand, was unhappy. ""I\'m a little disappointed. It was difficult to get the most out of the tires."" The 18-year-old was self-critical about his performance in the final qualifying segment. ""I had some good laps throughout the session, but my two attempts in Q3 weren\'t my strongest.""\n\n> Chief engineer Andrew Shovlin defended Antonelli. ""It was his first Q3 of his Formula 1 career. Of course, he\'ll be disappointed, but he can focus on tomorrow to attack in the race.""\n\n> There, it will be crucial to preserve the left front tire over the stints. Shovlin knows this too. ""In the sprint, we had more graining than expected. You have to be extremely careful: If you push, the tire will degrade immediately."" Qualifying champion Russell is aware of this. Nevertheless, the three-time Grand Prix winner wants to be part of the action on Sunday (March 23). ""Hopefully we can manage the tires well, utilize the car\'s pace, and achieve a strong result.""\n\n> If George Russell can confirm Saturday\'s performance and finish the Chinese GP in the top three, it would be the 300th podium finish in Mercedes\' Formula 1 history.

1jgqugd,Every current F1 drivers best Quali performance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jgqugd/every_current_f1_drivers_best_quali_performance/,2025-03-21, Discussion,"In light of today's brilliant qualifying session I started thinking about what each driver on the current grids best qualifying lap is. Here is what I came up with. 

Max Verstappen - 2023 Monaco -
One of the most exciting Q3's in recent times was topped by this extraordinary effort from Max. Two tenths down going into the final sector it looked as thoigh we were getting an Alonso pole and probable win given that it's Monaco. Then Max pulled three tenths out of the bag by going oh so close and even touching some walls that had ruined his Monaco Grand Prix in his early years. 

Liam Lawson - Singapore 2023 - 
Not a massive amount of choices here but this one is great. At this point in the year it was Liams third race in F1 as he subbed in for the injured Danny Ric and he was racing for the Alpha Tauri team that had thus far scired just three points and reached Q3 just twice. Yuki was down in 15th but Liam set a lap that got him into Q3 and would lead him on a path to points. Best of all, it knocked the Red Bulls out as Max was demoted to 11th on the grid after having won 10 races running. 
This lap not only ended that streak but also was when a full time F1 drive became a serious possibility for him. 

Lando Norris - Spain 2024 - 
Lando has a few options as he excels particularly in wet weather Qualis. However it is a lap in Spain's sunny summer that stands out the most. 
It looked unlikely Max would be toppled however Lando managed to grab his first of 8 race poles in  2024 with a brilliant effort. 

Oscar Piastri - Saudi Arabia 2023 -
Yes I could have gone for one of his sprint poles or many front row laps but this lap, where he put his McLaren 8th on the grid is my favourite. 
It was Oscar's second race and his team mate Norris had gone out in Q1 in 19th. His first race in Bahrain had been disappointing as his McLaren has broken down on lap 13. But in one of the worst cars on the grid Oscar did something special under the lights in Jeddah to make Q3 and then put it 9th. Then he was promoted to 8th after Leclerc's penalty, speaking of whom...

Charles Leclerc - Sakhir 2020 -
""What?!"" I can hear you say, ""Leclerc has 26 poles and you have THIS lap as the best?"" 
Well Yes, this was only good enough for 4th on the grid, but he was in a 2020 Ferrari! And Vettel was down in 13th! Admittedly there were quite a few P4s for him that year but this stands out because when he put it in during the first runs it was good enough for second, and he had gone purple in sector one. 
The lap was so good that Charles himself got out of the car without even setting a final run and said it was an amazing lap, and Charles is usually very self critical. 

Lewis Hamilton - Singapore 2018 - 
A very highly rated lap among fans and I came up with a few contenders to beat it (Silverstone 2007, Monaco 2015, Italy 2017 Australia 2018, Styria 2020). However in Singapore 2018, it seemed Merc had only the third fastest car at a track they usually struggled at. Lewis had narrowly avoided elimination in Q2. Then suddenly he produced what Toto Wolff called the best lap he has ever seen in an F1 car as Hamilton went 1.3 seconds faster than any lap he had done so far that weekend. This was where it became evident that Vettel wasn't getting that title. 

Russell - Belgium 2021 - 
Russell's Quali laps in 2021 just keep getting better and better and after a series of Q3 appearances George blew the F1 world away by qualifying 2nd in torrential conditions that had taken out a rapid Norris.
Russell in the 8th/9th fastest car outqualified everyone except Max Verstappen and when Sundays race never started, this lap got George his first ever podium and Williams's only podium of the last 12 years.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli - China 2025 ( sprint Quali) - Yeah theres only two options and the other ones bad so moving on

Fernando Alonso - Britain 2012 - 
What a year this was for Fernando, and the best qualifying lap of his I could think of is here. It was a told turvy wet to dry session and Fernando put his upper midfield at best Ferrari on pole position by 5 hundredths if a second ahead of Mark Webber.

Lance Stroll - Turkey 2020 - 
Yeah this couldnt be anything else and is widely regarded as Lance's finest hour. On a slippery, wet, resurfaced Turkish track Lance Stroll beat Max Verstappen to go give Racing Point it's first pole since Fisichella in 2009 when it was Force India. Lance Stroll was on pole in Istanbul. (That rhymes well) 

Pierre Gasly - Las Vegas 2024 - 
Throughout 2020 and particularly 2021 Pierre Gasly put in some stunning laps but never did one impress me as much as last years third place in Las Vegas. This lap was enough to beat both Red Bulls, both McLarens, Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. And this is in a year where there was a fairly large gap between the top four amd the rest. 

Jack Doohan - China 2024 (sprint Quali) - 
Yeah only two options for Jack and this one was good as he beat Gasly. It's a shame for him Alpine seem to have been affected worse than anyone by new rear wing rules. 

Esteban Ocon - Monaco 2023 - 
The second time this fantastic qualifying has come up and this Ocon lap for P3 was special. It was the first/second runs in Q3 and you can hear the shock in commentator Alex Jacques voice when this lap puts Ocon onto provisional pole. Incredible effort that earned him a podium on race day. 

Ollie Bearman - Azerbaijan 2024 - 
Honestly today is a contender but this lap is more impressive imo. After a surprise Saudi weekend that I personally didn't rate as highly as most people Bearman was back when Magnussen got banned for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and after a messy crash in practice Bearman rebounded in stunning style to out qualify Hulkenburg and get into Q3! 

Yuki Tsunoda - Brazil 2024 -
Last weeks lap in Australia is certainly up there but I think last years lap that got him P3 on the grid on a wet and rainy Sunday morning in Brazil is his best. Yuki was incredible last season and this was the cherry on top. He seems to be driving perhaps even better this year. 

Isack Hadjar - Australia 2025 - 
Well out of the two qualifying sessions that he's partaken in being fastest of al the rookies and 11th on the grid is respectable. It will be exciting to see what he can do in the future. 

Alex Albon - Italy 2023 - 
I narrowed it down to Japan 2019 when he matched Max, and Britain, Zandvoort amd Italy 2023. 
Ultimately I went with the highest up of those in Zandvoort when Albon put it P4 on the grid. Brilliant lap in the Williams. 

Carlos Sainz - Italy 2023 - 
Qualifying on pole? in a Ferrari? in Monza?! It doenst get much better than that for a qualifying lap and Sainz sent the tifosi into ecstasy with a supreme lap to top Max Verstappen's effort and put it on pole for the race. 

Nico Hulkeburg - Brazil 2010 - 
Hulkenburg's only pole in F1 and on a drizzly day on track in Interlagos everyone wondered which of the 5 championship contenders would be on pole. 
In the end neither of the Red Bulls took pole, which was unusual in 2010, amd it wasnt a McLaren or even a Ferrari that usurped them. It was a bloody Williams. 
Rookie Hulkenburg was finding out he didn't have a drive for 2011, with Williams bringing in Maldonado for the cash. But Hulkenburg showed he belonged on that grid and set pole position. 

Gabriel Bortoleto - Australia 2025 -
Finally we arrive at Bortoleto's and his two qualifying sessions thus far have been marvellous.

1jhdvff,Your theories on the second RedBull,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jhdvff/your_theories_on_the_second_redbull/,2025-03-22, Discussion,"I am counting on people bringing some facts based on track data and interviews.

I have several theories regarding why every single second RB driver just... falls off the wagon.

1. Ever since 2018, the car had been a nightmare to drive. I am considering here the perfectionism Max has and how he has forced himself through countless hours in the simulator to adjust his driving style to the peculiarities of the car. Or maybe, that is just his natural style and here is an interesting bit of speculation, beginning with 2018, the cars have only been built around him, that is why Ricciardo fell behind Max beginning with that year.   
  
2. Max was just better than everyone, but ever since Perez won in Azerbaijan in 2023 they have not run identical configurations on the cars to avoid driver conflict. This would fail to explain though why they would still keep this after Perez left. We are going down the rabbit hole of conspiracies now, as the only reason would be to make Max appear like God's gift to the motorsport and milk an undrivable car for every single drop of performance. 

3. The second RB is cursed and Marko's glass eye is the final horcrux. Slightly far fetched this one.

Now, if we go with theory number 1, which is the most feasible, that means Max has a very VERY peculiar driving style as of today, and the cars are built to respect his style and they couldn't give a rat's ass about the second driver. They say the greatest of them all would be able to drive a matchbox car into a title battle, however I would be curious if that applies to Max. If a car fit for his driving style is undrivable by literally anyone else, how would he do in a regular championship winning car, like this year's McLaren? Would he just dominate the field, would he be able to adapt? Or would he fall slightly behind the other driver in a car that has to be driven in a more conventional way?","[""3... it's 3."", ""Any theories about sabotage make no sense. Red Bull would love to have two drivers so they have better strategy options.\n\nPerez has been the only driver they've had with actually decent experience since the Ricciardo era.

They guy who is leaving, some junior driver/outsider or the driver who your team believes is best on the grid? Obvious you'd choose Max because he's the best driver on the grid so *obviously* he knows best, and if Max is happy, then the team is happy, and if the second driver doesn't perform in a car which they have little input on then he's *obviously* not up to the task of being a Red Bull driver! \n\nAdd in the pressure cooker that is Red Bulls junior program and you get the last 7 years of second driver Hell RBR have been in.

1jh5akm,A theory on Ferrari and Racing Bulls strategy.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jh5akm/a_theory_on_ferrari_and_racing_bulls_strategy/,2025-03-22, Discussion,"Over the last 5 years two teams have stood out as being very poor strategy wise. 

Ferrari, who arguably could have won or at least fought a lot harder for both the 2019 and 2022 titles had they had better strategy. 

The other is Toro Rosso/Alpha Tauri/VCARB/ Racing Bulls/ Red Bull B-team/RB/ whatever you want to call them. 
Though not as talked about as Ferrari (understandable given they are a midfield team) many fans have noticed how many points they have thrown away from bad strategies. 

I would also like to throw Sauber in here as well because in 2021 they threw away points with Raikkonen and in particular Giovinazzi on a good few occasions. Since then Bottas and Zhou have also lost positions in the pit stop phase in the last few years, thoigh it's hardly ever noticed because it tends to result in a drop from P13/14 to P15/16. 

What all three of the aforementioned temas have in common is that they are the only teams based outside the Uk and as a result have more of their engineers from countries such as Italy, where English is not the first language. 

The reason this is importnat is because all the teams have to communicate to their drivers jn English, mainly for our entertainment so we understand team radio's. 

Is it possible that this is hampering these engineers efforts to quickly communicate with their drivers.

 Take Max's engineer GP for an example of the opposite. He is English and is able to use as little words as possible but still get the point across crisply and clearly. 
In fact all but 6 driver engineers on the grid (according to my research) have English as their first language. The exceptions are a Haas engineer, A Sauber one, and both Ferrari and Racimg Bulls engineers. 

So is it a coincidence that the two teams that dont have either engineers with English as their first language are also the two teams with the worst strategy? And should temas be allowed to communicate with drivers in other languages? 

I'd be really interested to hear what you all think.","[""not speaking english as their main language doesn't have any effect on the decisions the strategy team themselves make."", ""Good theory. For example, McLaren last year were spotless in their strategy calls as they fought for the WDC and that's because they are not silly disorganized Italians. /s"", "">Is it possible that this is hampering these engineers efforts to quickly communicate with their drivers.\n\nI don't think Yuki's or Lewis' engineers communicating to them in Italian would improve communication."", ""To an extent. The 2 Italian teams do seem to have the biggest brain-farts when it comes to strategy. \n\nBut I'd also argue that really only rbr have, what I'd call, consistently good strategy calls, all other teams, over a season are mediocre at best, considering the level they're operating at."", 'where is that Sopranos meme\n\nThis is anti italian discrimination!!', 'If you go through the Merc dominant years you will find countless examples of them really not having a good strategy and relying on the car+driver combo to get them out of sticky situations.

They should be the brain of the live race ops (e.g. James Vowles\' ex-Merc role).\n\nWhile it\'s true that the driver has the best view on track, the garage has the big picture with more time and information to forecast and weigh decisions. \n\nI forgot which race but that infamous ""Stop inventing"" from Carlos where he was supposed to let Charles go ahead. The logic was that Carlos with better tires can protect both their positions. IIRC, that seemed very fictional because it will end in both of them being passed. \n\nIn any case, if your driver can consistently think of better strategies than your dedicated strategist/s, then what are they there for? \n\nThe ideal situation should have a strategist presenting clear choices that both the team and driver can easily weigh OR an already decided action plan to execute. \n\nPerhaps better said that all strategies presented (2-3 choices or a firm recommendation) should be so effective that no one second-guesses it.

In my opinion, it is likely a combination of both. Yes it makes sense to set the car up around your more talented/senior driver but that should not overshadow that the car has become slightly undriveable and Max is what makes it work. ","['Albon stated in an interview that it\'s not built around him. His explanation was something to the effect of ""Driving F1 cars is like playing a video game. Everyone likes different sensitivity levels. Max likes his sensitivity to be maxxed out (sorry for the pun"".\n\n\nIs it fair to say that his feedback over the years has influenced how RedBull builds their cars? Sure. But at the end of the day, 2024 proved you can\'t win the WCC with only one driver.', ""Newey has said himself they don't/can't develop cars for drivers. Feedback probably plays a role to an extent, but ultimately, they develop a car according to what they think will make it fastest. IIRC Redbull cars in general do tend to be front end heavy\n\nMax is struggling with the car now. I don't think he prefers to struggle and fight the car just because he can."", 'What works for Max is near undriveable for most others, and he is good enough to drive around problems until they are too chronic to fix easily. This is one of the reasons why Ferrari put Barrichello next to Schumacher, as a good measuring stick for car development as Michael could just drive around car problems without much thought. Rubens gave good feedback to develop the car in the right direction.\n\nUnrelated to F1 but in MotoGP, Honda and Ducati learned the hard way with Marquez and Stoner respectively how extreme talent can cover up fundamental development problems that eventually can no longer be compensated for.', ""Horner was asked this after FP1 yesterday in an interview with Sky F1\n\n> Pinkham: Could it be that the car is just simply better suited to Max and could anyone drive the Red Bull other than Max?\n\n> Horner: Well, Max is quite specific what he wants from a car to make it fast. And that is generally a very positive front end on the car.\n\n> Horner: Very sharp turn in. Of course, the consequence of that is it will unsettle the rear of the car. And that for a driver is tremendously confident sapping. If you've got a loose rear on the rear end of these cars on entry into corners. And so, that's where he excels.\n\n> Horner: That's where, you know, he's able to live on a knife's edge of adhesion. And he's just constantly asking for more and more, you know, front out of the car. \n\n> Horner: And of course, that you're always going to follow the direction of your faster driver. And that leads the organisation in terms of its development."", '![gif](giphy|3ELtfmA4Apkju)', 'Both the car isn‚Äôt as good as it has been in 2022-24 and it‚Äôs harder to drive \n\nThe car isn‚Äôt designed around a driver, please explain to me how an engineer doing the cad model of a wing can predict if it causes understeer oversteer\n\nWhat does happen is they try to make the car as fast as possible and it has intrinsic characteristics, for example nobody wants to make cars with bad tyre deg, but those cars do happen and when there‚Äôs no clear solution it‚Äôs very hard to work a car out of it', ""I'd say it's 80/20 with 80 being just the car set up and being difficult to drive. \n\nThe engineers are going to make the fastest car they can, they will take input from the drivers on what they like, but numbers and results(cfd and wind tunnel)drive the engineers. \n\nAlbon spoke on it in an interview. He doesn't say it's built around Max and he has every incentive to say that. If the car was built around Max it's justifiable that he struggled with it. \n\nThat being said, taken any 2 of Max's teammates as the driver pairing and I think the car would be massively different. There is an inherent instability in the Red Bull that Max either drives around or likes that allows him to succeed. \n\nSo in summary, Max can handle a difficult car and extract the most out of it which allows the engineers to continue down this development path and not fix those issues because they don't need to."", 'In both scenarios you seem to think Max likes the way the car is.\n\nI think Max is just good enough to drive around it but would rather it behaved better.\n\nI think Max hurts red bulls development by being too good at driving around issues and that masks big flaws that the get bigger as they go down vecertain upgrade paths.', ""It's all fine. They just need to clone a Max, or let Max sim race the 2nd car whilst driving.\xa0""]",0,55,0.24,0,49,49,0,3,0.0,0
1jh7c6d,Is Lawsons performance evidence that the Redbull IS in fact built around Max?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jh7c6d/is_lawsons_performance_evidence_that_the_redbull/,2025-03-22, Discussion,"People here may remember that over the course of the last few years, people (mostly Verstappen fans) were arguing that the Redbull is definitely not built around Verstappen and that the car is never and has never been built around 1 driver in the team.

This debate seemed to come to a head in the 2021-22 season where even Redbull themselves (Horner) was answering questions regarding the Redbull being built around Max, saying that it wasnt.

But does Lawsons performance (and literally every single driver before him now) show that the Redbull **IS** in fact built around Max?

Other commentators seem to be landing on this conclusion again too (including fans of Max this time), and it cant be a coincidence that nobody but Max seems to be able to drive the Redbull?","['I think it‚Äòs more that the car is very difficult to drive.\n\nIf you watch Max‚Äòs onboards you can see him struggling with under-/oversteer as well, but because he‚Äòs a better and more experienced driver than Liam and more used to the very sensitive car, he can extract more performance from the car.\n\nAs to whether that means the car is built around Max: I think F1 cars in general are built to be as fast as possible. A more sensitive car has a higher ceiling than an easier to drive car, but that makes it easier to make mistakes as well. Max can deal with the characteristicd that make the car faster better, so in a way the car is built for him. But if the car were faster with different characteristics, I‚Äòm sure Red Bull would design it that way and it would be on Max to change his driving style.', 'Every engineer ever has said you can‚Äôt build a car around a driver. Newey himself said this as well. \nSo I‚Äôve no idea why this is still a question.\n\nYou can only change a set up towards a drivers preference.\n\nYou can also visibly see Max struggling with the car himself and he was complaining about it nearly the entirety of last season.\nWhy would he want a car that‚Äôs hard to drive?', 'what you‚Äôre seeing stems from the fact that max is one of the best drivers to ever grace the sport, not that the car somehow only responds to his command like its the elder wand fucks sake lol', 'Like many other here are saying: the short answer is no. The car is built to be the ‚Äòtheoretical‚Äô fastest it can go. Often, however, this comes at attributes of a car that make it difficult to drive, which in turn is just costing laptime. Teams therefore need to find a balance between the theoretical fastest, and drivability that allows for a driver the actually extract any pace from it. \n\nWith Max, it just so happens that he seems to be better than others to drive a car that still contains those difficult attributes, meaning he can drive a car that is closer to the theoretical fastest than other drivers. This doesn‚Äôt mean the car is built around Max. It just means he is more capable of driving around ‚Äòproblems‚Äô, meaning the team doesn‚Äôt need to go to as great extends to make the car manageable than other drivers might need. \n\nThey could theoretically change the car to make it more drivable for Liam, but it would most likely mean they compromise overall pace of the car as they move away from the ‚Äòtheoretical fastest‚Äô.', 'The ""debate"" has been around since 2018, where people basically thought Red Bull would change the car completely to suit Max because he was becoming their number one driver. \n\nIt only seems to exist around Red Bull though, simply because Max keeps stomping his teammates, as if Red Bull are doing some sort of satanic sacrifice of the second car to make his more powerful', ""Given a choice between two equally fast and viable development paths, they'd probably listen to the feedback of the guy who's driven for them for a decade and who can win them championships. \n\nIn reality that situation likely (almost) never happens, and the car is just designed to be the fastest possible and then each driver can adjust setup to try and make it suit them."", ""If you have a car that's too slow to fight for the championship but you can sacrifice driveability to make the car faster and you have a driver who can deal with that the choice is easy. In 2022 and 2023 Perez had (relatively) good results. Same as early 2024. As soon as they lost their advantage they had to make compromised. We saw in Imola that Max too spun once or twice in testing. Max is just good enough that he can get on top of that and then go on to win the race.\n\nSo no, the car isn't designed for Max necessarily. It's just that Max's skill allows them to make the car hard to drive and he'll deal with it."", ""It's built for speed. Others finding it hard to drive is simply collateral until they no longer have a driver that can extract the performance."", ""The difference between Lawson in Red Bull and same Lawson in Racing Bull last year is so abysmal that the only explanation must be the car, given that this applies also to Albon, Gasly, even Perez...\nNot saying that Max isn't extremely good but the only possible explanation is that the car is undrivable and only a very good and experienced driver like Max can achieve something with it""]",0,136,0.29,0,125,125,0,2,-0.010000000000000009,0
