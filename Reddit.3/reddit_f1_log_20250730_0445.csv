1mcckj6,My experience at the Spa GP.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mcckj6/my_experience_at_the_spa_gp/,2025-07-29, Discussion,"Hi guys,


I want to share a story from after the race that myself and my family experienced at the Spa GP. I want to preface it by saying that we all had a great overall time at Spa (it was my second visit and the others first) and we will definitely be back, however:  



Myself and my group were in the Gold 3 stand (weekend tickets) and luckily as we were leaving we saw a disabled person pushing another disabled person in a wheel chair just to the rear of the grandstand walking towards where the your tickets were scanned. This is obviously a very steep hill, as such if the person had carried on pushing the wheel chair this would have ended up in a huge accident as they could not have gotten them down the hill. With thousands of other fans leaving at the same time this would have caused some serious injury to both of the men and other fans.

 

Luckily for the 2 men, myself and my family noticed this and offered to help them. After wheeling them down the hill we realised we obviously had no idea where to take them as surely the organiser would be responsible for getting these people too their grandstand and from their vehicle. Unfortunately both gentleman had issues with speech (as well as being French and we are British) so communication was incredibly hard. We eventually managed to figure out that they had been transported from the Les combes car park park and ride area (about a 45 minute walk) by the red cross. So we found some security guards in the hopes they could point us towards the red cross who we would have assumed had a vehicle capable of transporting them.



 

After spending 15 minutes talking with the red cross the outcome was that we could wait 90 minutes and there would be a chance they could take them (they implied it wasn't likely) or they would have to find their own way back to their vehicle. This was obviously not acceptable as at this point it was already 6pm and us not knowing when the park and ride finished we couldn't risk getting there and then having no idea where the gentleman's car was. So we opted to push the wheel chair and assist the gentleman in walking back, even though the walk would obviously tire the man out beyond what's acceptable for him to then drive home.

 

On the walk back we passed 2 red cross medic areas, the first one, the only help they offered was some foil blankets (which I had to request) as the gentleman in the wheel chair was clearly visibly very very cold, they did not have a wheel chair or anything useful to help us get the other man back (who could walk but had leg braces and struggled). The 2nd red cross medic area recognised the man, so they were clearly the ones who helped him get to Gold 3 to begin with, however when we questioned them on why they had not thought about the obvious fact they'd need to get home they stopped engaging with us in English and refused to help any further, claiming 10 of them needed to man the station at all times, they also did not have a wheel chair we could use.

 

So we carried on walking them back to the park and ride, luckily getting one of the final busses of the evening, so had we waited for the potential help from red cross and it not come, they would not have been able to get back to the car park. By the end of the walk we were having to carry the man who could walk because he was exhausted, overall it took 2 hours to get them back. The only positive interaction we had with any staff member from Spa was one of the shuttle bus stewards who was very helpful in getting them on the bus and then ensuring that people on the bus would help them on the other side, as we could not board the bus, since we were staying in green camping.

Overall myself and my family are appalled at the level of accessibility at the track and have never encountered a worse situation. Had we not been there at the right time to help these 2 men out, they at worse would have had a huge incident leaving Gold 3 and at best just never got back to their car. Out of the 15-20 staff members we spoke to (who were mostly polite just not helpful) only 1 was any real help.

1mc5l35,Anyone else surprised by how bad the dirty air has been this year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mc5l35/anyone_else_surprised_by_how_bad_the_dirty_air/,2025-07-29, Discussion,"I remember hearing a while ago that this generation of cars were supposed to have less dirty air than the 2017-2021 generation. It may have been better earlier on (I must admit I didn't follow the 2023 or 2022 seasons that closely), but in 2024, and this year, it seems as if the dirty air is right back up to 2020/2021 levels.

Aside from Silverstone and Austria this year (and Lewis at Spa), cars seem to find it nigh on impossible to overtake, even with DRS zones to help. The Suzuka race in particular was a big example of this. No-one could overtake anyone. Monaco was another example - the Williams drivers slowed by 3 seconds a lap so the other could get a free pit stop, and the dirty air was so bad that even when they were driving 80% speed no-one could slip by (granted, it wasn't helped by the narrow width of the track).

I'm just very surprised the dirty air seems no better than 2020-2021, considering all that I heard about these cars ""improving racing.""

Now they're saying the same thing about the 2026 cars. I wonder how bad the dirty air will actually end up being with those. Will it be any better than the 2025 cars? I hope so.

Even in races like Spa or Suzuka where there is limited overtaking, there are cars across the entire grid that are easily following within a second for multiple laps. It's far off 2022 though.\n\nThe two main issues at the moment are:\n\n\\- The cars are producing so much downforce from the floors that they can run less RW, so the DRS effect is less. This is on top of getting less slipstream than the previous gen cars\n\n\\- The cope with the weight and downforce of the cars, Pirelli have made all the tyres a bit harder for this year. As such, deg is generally very low\n\n\\- Low deg tyres plus cars that are very close in performance means that it's much harder to overtake."", 'It‚Äôs nowhere near the 20/21 levels.

1mc6lld,If a driver switched teams in any time of the season and won the world championship which team would have the WDC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mc6lld/if_a_driver_switched_teams_in_any_time_of_the/,2025-07-29, Discussion,"Lets say there are a few scenarios:

A-Driver switches teams in the first half/summer break/second half
B- Driver switches teams just before the last race and wins the championship in the last one
C- Driver switches teams after winning the WDC

Which team would be seen as getting the WDC?
How controversial would it be?
And did this ever happen in Formula 1?","[""Teams don't win the WDC, so neither"", ""Any points earned while driving for Team A would go towards Team A's total for the World Constructor's Championship. \n\nAny points earned while driving for Team B would go towards Team B's total for the World Constructor's Championship. \n\nAny points earned by Driver would go towards Driver's total for the World Driver's Championship, regardless of which team he drove for at the time."", 'Fangio has done this in 1954, drove two races for Maserati then went to Mercedes, on Wikipedia both are credited with a WDC in 1954 but I dunno if Wikipedia is reliable for that sorta infomation.', 'Officially, neither, as WDC is just for the driver, but many stat sources do count WDCs per team.\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio actually did this in 1954, winning the first 2 races for Maserati before moving to Mercedes, winning a further 4 races en route to his second WDC. Any sources that list WDCs per team give Fangios 1954 WDC to both Maserati and Mercedes.', ""teams don't have world drivers championships, drivers have those"", ""Will depend on the context. Have both build a WDC caliber car and/or do the majority/all of the points come from one team? Have they spend about 40-60% at each team or is it more 10-90%. Etc.\xa0\n\n\nI'd say in scenario B and C it's the team where the driver scored (most of) the points, as they provided the WDC caliber car.\xa0\n\n\nIn scenario A it's more difficult to credit just one, but still possible. Ex. If during the previous regs Russell spend some time at Williams and then switched to Mercedes mid-season and somehow won the WDC, I think most people would credit Mercedes for providing the car.\xa0\n\n\nTeams don't get/have WDC's, but seems from your comments the question is a bit more nuanced. So I replied with that in mind."", ""WDC is for drivers, so the team he is under contract with for next year will claim that they have a WDC winning driver.  \n  \nThe teams have their own constructors championship, drivers are just contractors and only associated with a team they're under contract with."", ""I think I understand what you mean. Some teams have stickers as you enter their garages proclaiming they've won X WDC and X WCC. Because the WDC isn't officially awarded to the team, it's nothing more than a mere opinion. In mine, if a driver drives for your team during a race and goes on to win the championship, they won it across multiple teams"", 'None or both, depending on your definition of credited.']",0,44,0.42,0,352,352,0,0,0.03999999999999998,0
