1jw4xfl,Confused about qualifying,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jw4xfl/confused_about_qualifying/,2025-04-10, Discussion,"***EDIT: ASKED & ANSWERED! THANK YOU ALL!!!!***

I’m a MotoGP fan but starting to get into F1.  Can someone link or clarify how qualifying works this year? 

Google search shows it would be 3 Qualifying sessions (Q1, Q2, Q3) that are knock-out stages eliminating 5 drivers until Q3 establishes top 10. 

However the F1 APP shows does not indicate a Q1 or Q2, but lists Practice 1, Practice 2, Practice 3 and then Qualifying qualifying session and no “free practice” session?

I typed a few variations in the search bar to try and find a summary or explanation but could not see one.  

My logic tells me that Practice 1 and Practice 2 are actually Q1 and Q2 and knockout rounds and that Qualifying is really Q3 to establish top 10.  

Appreciate in advance clarification!","['Free Practice 1, 2, 3 are all separate sessions.\n\nQualifying is 1 session SPLIT into 3 (Q1, Q2, Q3)', ""Q1, Q2, and Q3 are all part of the Qualifying session. They're done back to back with just a little bit of time in between the parts.\n\nQ1 is 18 minutes, Q2 is 15 minutes, and Q3 is 12 minutes, so Qualifying usually takes 45 minutes to an hour (assuming no red flags)."", 'q1, q2 and q3 are just parts of the same QUALIFY.\n\nnot separate events.\n\nq1 is the first 15 minutes of the qualify.\n\nq2 is the next few minutes of the qualify.\n\nq3 is the last 8 minutes of the qualify and when the top 10 are determined.\n\n  \nPRACTICE 1, 2 and 3 are called FP1, FP2 and FP3 and are just free practices, nothing competitive.', 'FP, or practice sessions, are where we all lose our minds, checking sector times, and determine who is going to win the race, and possibly the drivers championship\n\nqualifying is where those dreams get crushed and max pulls out an insane lap on his final stint.  Or someone else gets pole and we take bets on how they will bottle the start or team strategy.', 'So the practice rounds do not count into the qualifying. Drivers and teams get 3 practice sessions to get their cars set up and all. As for qualifying, there is one session with 3 rounds, Q1, Q2, and Q3. Bottom 5 drivers get eliminated in the Q1 and the rest progress onto the Q2. The same thing happens in the Q2. Then for the Q3 the remaining 10 drivers again try and set the fastest lap to get the best grid position. \n\nHope this helps!', 'Practices are separate from Qualifying. On a regular race week Practice 1 and Practice 2 sessions are on Friday, while Practice 3 and Qualifying are on Saturday. On a sprint week, it’s Practice 1 and Sprint Qualifying on Friday, Sprint and Qualifying (for the regular race) on Saturday.', 'The qualifying is 1 hour and each session is broken down into a 18 minutes, 15 minutes and 12 minutes sessions. \n\nF1 changed the verbiage of calling it free practice to just practice. Likely to be more in line with the US counterparts.', 'The practice sessions are exactly that - teams use them to get the drivers out on the track, play with set up etc. Qualifying takes place in one session where all the drivers go out for the first part of the session Q1 (18 minutes) that sets the grid order for 16-20; then the top fifteen move forward for a second session immediately afterwards Q2 (around 15 minutes) which sets the grid order for 11-15 and then the top ten of them go forward to one last session Q3 (12 minutes) to set the final grid order (1-10). So three free practice sessions (Friday (morning and afternoon) and Saturday morning) and then one Qualifying season on Saturday afternoon.', 'Everyone else has answered your question already, so I\'ll just give a suggestion. \n\nWhen I was getting into F1 chat GPT was extremely useful. I started with ""what does a race weekend look like"" and then went on from there. \n\nAfter that, once I had watched a few races and knew a bit of terminology, I continued with more in depth questions, like tyres (types, tyre usage, graining, etc), under and oversteering, corners (chicanes, hairpin, etc).

Had to adapt to new tyres, didn't like the brakes of the car, and let Ron's management and his own paranoia to reach his head.

Still, after Mclaren finally changed his breaks at Silverstone, he outqualified and outpointed Hamilton for the rest of the season. Still, it was a mighty fight and Hamilton remains the most impressive rookie season of all time.

But then from 2008 to 2014, I think it's arguable that Alonso was the better driver in most seasons. 

In 2008, Hamilton was weirdly doing mistakes he wasn't doing in his rookie season. Both him and Massa seemed to have been trying to gift the championship to eachother. I can't help but feel Alonso would have cruised to an easy championship if he stayed at Mclaren, he was incredibly consistent in 2008, but the Renault was an average car.

In 2009 they both drove well, better than Button or Vettel who were doing lots of mistakes. It's hard to tell.

In 2010 again both drove well, probably better than Vettel. Maybe Lewis takes it because I feel Alonso has more notorious mistakes like Spa.

In 2011 Alonso was definetely better. Hamilton had probably his worst year in F1.

In 2012 I can't really say Hamilton drove bad, he was really good when Mclaren weren't fucking him up, but Alonso also had his best season ever, next to 2006. Ferrari were more or less the 4th fastest car, though reliability probably take them above Mclaren as the 3rd best car of the season.

In 2013 again I think Alonso was better. Maybe some of you have different opinions. Hamilton was still accomodating at a new team.

After 2014 it's impossible to tell, mostly because Lewis would go on to enjoy probably the best run of cars in F1 ever, with a championship capable car every season, and 4 dominant cars, while Alonso will experience some of the worst, at least in the modern era, with the 2015-2017 Mclaren Hondas.

Still, for what it is worth, Alonso had a bigger %avg race page gap between him and Button than what Lewis did. His gap to Massa is also big enough to accomodate for the gap between Hamilton and Bottas and the gap between Bottas and Massa, for some cross comparison.

Both are actually consistent with the average %gap between Alonso and Hamilton in 2007. Hamilton enjoyed a -0.05% advantage in quali, while Alonso enjoyed a -0.05% in race pace. So they were both within half a tenth of eachother, just with different strenghts.

What's your opinion? For me these 2 guys are the 3rd and 4th best drivers of all time, though I switch them up depending on how I wake up on the day. One thing is clear, I think Alonso might have the biggest gap between his talent and level of achievements, maybe other than G. Villeneuve.","['In the f1 community, is there ever a consensus on anything?', ""They're both great"", ""It's F1 rarely is anyone competing on the same field.

F1 used Grooved tyres whilst GP2 used slick tyres, with different compounds made to different specs. If Alonso had to adapt to the Bridgestone F1 tyres so did Lewis. \n\nPlus its also worth noting that when Hamilton did his test session against Pedro de la Rosa where McLaren were deciding which driver to pick based on their lap times. they were still using the Michelin tyres back then, so Lewis did better lap times than the Mclaren test driver on the Michelin tyres.\n\nthis argument makes more sense for Kimi and Massa than it does Lewis and Alonso"", 'For me there\'s no comparison.

Japan has been deemed boring, yet it's quite surprising that more races aren't like this.

There were other issues such as on a damp drying track going off line made it even harder to pass.

If you want to spice things up, there's reverse grids, which is silly, qualifying 1st come last in Monacco. Or drivers trying to get the lowest qualifying time but within the 107%. So that's out.

Randomised grid order, everyone will start in 1 position once. Requires the same number of cars as there are races. Plus starting last is more of a hinderence at some tracks than others.
And its a literal lottery.

So here's my idea. 3 rounds of qualifying you must use soft, medium, and hard compounds. But once you use one in a round you can only use that tyre, unless it rains.

Teams at the back could start on soft and try to get to Q2 but will then have a disadvantage in the later rounds. It adds an aspect of strategy in to play, which will mix up the grids, but is still based on performance and team strategy.

Either it's fine as it is, or there needs to be a shake up. Anyone got a better idea?","['The only thing worse than a boring race is a race ruined by gimmicks.
