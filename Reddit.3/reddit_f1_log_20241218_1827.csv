The case of Prost, a driver that has multiple championships, being fired because he called the car tractor or whatever will forever form my opinion of the team.\n\nWe even see it today, even on his worst days Leclerc is tiptoeing around his post-race messages.\n\nMaybe it\'s something Italian, I don\'t know. Considering their strongest years (the early 2000s), which were led by non-Italians, leads me to such conclusions.', "">With F1 operations so complex now, it would be all too easy for senior management to get involved in elements they know little about – which is why he is very much hands-off in certain areas.\n\nThis is such a breath of fresh air compared to Ron Dennis's attempt at implementing the outdated matrix management structure -- outdated because even the aerospace companies Ron was trying to copy were dumping it by then.

Reminds me of when the Michael lost his first championship with them in 1997 by trying to force Villenueve off track. Everyone in the Italian press was calling for him to be sacked. It was only thanks to Todt and Brawn shielding him that nothing drastic happened."", ""It wasn't necessarily the fact that it was lead by non-Italians, but that there was an agreement between Todt and Montezemolo, that thd hirarchy of Ferrari and McLaren wouldn't meddle with the team, thereby shielding them from the politics being played at both companies. The moment Montezemolo broke that agreement, the team went downhill. You could see the same negative dynamics play out at Alpine or at McLaren during the power struggle between Dennis, Whitmarsh and Ojjeh."", '>The case of Prost, a driver that has multiple championships, being fired because he called the car tractor or whatever will forever form my opinion of the team.\xa0\n\n\nTo add to that, his quote about the car handling like a truck was massively taken out of context after a post-race interview and Ferrari never sought any clarification. He\'s explained why in interviews and more recently in his documentary that aired earlier this month.\xa0\n\n\nAll he meant was how his car, in one particular race (Japan 1991), was almost impossible to drive because he had damage. At turn 1 he made contact with another car and his steering buckled as a result, making the car feel heavy and very hard to turn, hence the truck comparison. Now the whole year the Ferrari already had an issue where the steering would lock in long turns and the car almost couldn\'t turn, so the steering damage in Japan must\'ve amplified the issue and felt like hell. Prost called that race one of the best he\'s ever had despite finishing P4 and 25 seconds off the podium. For the record Brundle finished P5 and got lapped, the other Ferrari\'s engine blew up on the opening lap. At the time he was also in the middle of contract negotiations for the upcoming season and Ferrari felt his comments were even more disrespectful given the situation.\xa0\n\n\nYou\'re right that Ferrari has always had an issue with accepting criticism, especially from their own drivers. Another anecdote mentioned in the Prost documentary, in 1990 (which he called of his favorite seasons in F1 in terms of team atmosphere) he brought up to Ferrari how the engine was not good enough to compete with McLaren\'s engine and the team wouldn\'t accept such criticism. He said ""at Ferrari, the engine is sacred. You don\'t touch the engine, you don\'t talk about the engine. Everything has to be about the rest of the car. Except the chassis was very good that year."" I don\'t think it\'s as extreme nowadays, but it\'s still telling that their team culture, not their technical expertise, potentially cost them some championships along the way', ""This is such a big thing for F1 teams - and most like business - in general.\n\nHow many times have we heard about how F1 teams have success precisely because the eg the manufacturer they are owner by does \\*not\\* interfere with the running of the team and lets them get on with it. The same with the likes of Newey is given the authority to do what he likes.\n\nOn the flip side F1 teams tend to suffer when the 'higher ups' get involved, like so often with Ferrari, Gary Anderson had stories from Jaguar where they literally couldn't do development work on the car until it was submitted to and approved by Ford management - who didn't have any idea what they were looking at.\n\nFrom the looks of it Audi despite not even being in F1 yet is already having to learn this lesson, question is will they learn it in time.

We’ve all watched ‘Drive to survive’ and some of us enjoy a good old documentary….

I was 9 when I first saw F1 and being a Brit I was drawn in by the emotions of a win by a British driver at a time when so many drivers from other nations were so strong and capable. Statistics said it had been 10 years since our last British champion so I was hopeful that I could see a new winner soon.

As a child and still to this day, ‘Our Nige’ is still my all time favourite. 

This documentary brought all my emotions back, feels very similar to the day I heard ‘is that Glock?’

I figure it is the kind of info which is probably casually dropped in the middle of a YouTube video, but I wouldn't know how to search for it by itself.

For context, the reason I want to know is that the Ambulance Trust I work for loves to describe our approach to resuscitation as a ""Pit Stop"" approach, where everyone has a single role and they all come together to work as a team, but I would quite like to be able to point out the next time just how often Pit Crews get to practice working as a team, compared to the one afternoon every 18 months that my trust thinks is sufficient dedicated training time.","['At the factory the teams tend to short sessions with around a dozen stops twice a day. |  \nAt the track they will do a 30 min session every day each 30 min session would be around 50 stops.\n\nRed Bull article about this: [https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops)', 'Idk but Talking Bulls podcast had an episode with members of their pit crew, can probably find out there', ""Some of this information is second or third hand from some personal sources, and some of it is a few seasons old, so bear that in mind. The article u/Mysterious_Research2 also has some interesting tidbits about Red Bull's approach.\n\nThe actual training structure and volume varies a lot between teams, I think the differences in approach between a top team like Red Bull and a much smaller team like Haas would surprise a lot of people.\n\nYou can break the training/practice down into three separate blocks:\n\n1. Off-season (December - Feb/March). The crew are working almost exclusively from the factory, and the top teams will be training their pit crews for maybe 1 hour per day. Not all of that is pitstop practice, so some days may see dozens of pit stops while others might involve some strength training at the gym. For the smaller teams it will be more workload dependent, and also dependent on their facilities (not all teams have a Red Bull-style dedicated pit stop practice room). There may be weeks where the crew needs to spend time on other things and only have time to practice for 30 minutes on 1 or 2 days in a week.\n\n\n2. In-season at the Track (Wednesday-Sunday). Similar between the teams. Each team will spend 15-30 mins per day practicing pit stops. Due to travel and the time it takes to set up the paddock, there is usually no practice on a Monday or Tuesday of the race week.\n\n\n3. In-season Off Weeks. Depending on travel schedules, fatigue and rest days, the crew might not spend much time practicing back at the factory between races (the number of days in the factory will be team-dependent). At the top teams the training might be similar to off-season when the crew are back in the factory, since they have more support that lets them take time away from their normal duties. On the other hand, some top teams will offer their crew more rest days between events as a perk, so the practice volume might be very small. For the smaller teams, who don't have as many staff and so rely more on the trackside staff to fill in when they're back, it will be heavily dependent on their workload. A busy week might mean they don't train at all."", ""During peak race season I'd venture to say they're practicing daily - for hours a day."", ""On race weekends, they usually practice on Thursdays and Fridays. During off weeks they'll have practice sessions at the factory.\n\nTheir practice hours per year probably reach 3 digits easily."", 'Speed with Guy Martin did an F1 special that let him get a shot at being an F1 mechanic, including the pit stops. It was a really interesting episode an worth a watch, but they do keep some of it secret', ""They definitely don't practice daily during the season as they may not have time with all the time spent traveling and performing other tasks. Regarding the off-season, Vasseur mentioned two ago that the crew had done about 1800 practice stops over the winter. No idea if it's average, lower or higher compared to other teams though"", ""My company had a guy come speak at a national conference who was head of a NASCAR pit crew for a long time and he showed a bunch of videos of them working out, doing practice runs etc. \n\nWhat was interesting is that when he got into it in the early 90s, apparently they didn't practice at all and just were winging it at that point with whoever they had around. \n\nThis guy was a college football player who got hurt and didn't make it to the league and somehow stumbled into pit crews. He basically convinced the team to let him run the program and train the guys and told them they should focus on finding former college athletes like him, football players, wrestlers etc.  who weren't going to go pro but still wanted to compete in something and were already strong and in shape. Apparently it revolutionized the whole thing, they have an entire training program they bring people into now."", 'apparently some teams like williams have also taken to automating the pit stop practice. previously teams would use an old car that they would push into a set up pit box but i think at somepoint early in the hybrid era that changed.\n\nnot all teams put a lot of emphasis of practicing it and it shows in the pit times.

Why did Ferrari sign him for 96?\n\nIt seems most people at the time felt there were better options for the Ferrari drive, but I have not been able to find any in-depth analysis on why Ferrari chose him. Was it simply that he was the best driver willing to sign a contract to be #2 to Schumacher? I feel like I have read/heard somewhere that Ferrari wanted to keep Berger but that he didn’t want to be Schumi’s team-mate.\n\nThe likes of Hakkinen, Barrichello, Frentzen and Coulthard all seemed to have better reputations than Irvine but I wonder if Ferrari looked at Eddie and saw a strong personality who wouldn’t be mentally fazed by Schumacher’s presence, and would instead just get on with the job as best as he could. \n\n2. How do we rate him overall? \n\nI ask this mainly in the context of his comparison to Barrichello. After a messy ‘94, Irvine was very closely matched with Barrichello in ‘95 and he seemed to mentally destabilise Barrichello a bit, or at least that is the general consensus and one that seems to be corroborated by Eddie Jordan himself.\n\nHowever, Barrichello went on to be a much better #2 to Schumacher than Eddie was. I said in my recent post on 1992-2003 that there seemed to be two versions of Eddie at Ferrari - one was a great competitive spirit that could take points away from Michael’s rivals and the other was miles off the pace. \n\nHowever, he started off at Ferrari with a car that was not particularly good and reportedly had very little opportunity to test in his first year or so at Maranello. How much do we think that skewed things against him? It seems to me he improved throughout his time at Ferrari and largely fulfilled his potential in ‘99, albeit the main factor in putting him on the verge of a title was the numerous mistakes and mechanical failures for Hakkinen & McLaren that year.', 'There was a relatively good interview (or bunch of quotes mashed together into one) with Steiner, where he said the sticking point with Perez may be the lost future income.

1hghw8a,How much of an advantage is it to have light drivers on the grid?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hghw8a/how_much_of_an_advantage_is_it_to_have_light/,2024-12-17, Discussion,"Lighter cars are faster than heavier cars, thats a given. But how much of an advantage is it to have lightweight drivers on the grid nowadays, that cars are much heavier than in the past.

This year the extremes were Tsunoda (54 kg) and Hulkenberg (75 kg). 21 kg is about 10 laps of fuel or 2,5% of the car's weight. How many seconds per lap could that amount to?","[""it isn't anymore. light drivers have ballast to make it's equal. the minimum weight is 80kg\n\nalso this is a question for https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hg53d8/ask_rformula1_anything_daily_discussion_thread/"", 'the lighter drivers have added ballast to reach the 80kg minimum weight', 'Ballast to make weight up to 80kg must be placed under the drivers seat/cockpit so cannot be used to improve car balance.', ""Interestingly, in the 80s and early 90s, only the car had to be a certain minimum weight. The driver was excluded. This theoretically meant the lighter drivers had the advantage. \n\nIf I remember correctly Eddie Cheever was one of the heaviest drivers.. Yet he was also one of the quickest. In 1982, he went up against one of the lightest drivers on the grid, Laffite, and thoroughly outperformed him. He then went on to do reasonably well against the legendary (and another light weight) Alain Prost in 1983.\n\nIn 1995, the driver weight was included as well with the car for the first time, and their sum had to be a certain minimum weight. \n\nAnd .. Absolutely nothing changed with regards to the pecking order of drivers. Nothing significant, anyway.\n\nI don't deny weight is important, but driver talent matters more than how much you weigh."", 'None as ballast is added to compensate for the difference between lighter drivers and those that are heavier.\n\nThe cars all have the same minimum weight requirement with the ballast added.', ""It's no longer a big disadvantage but it used to be before they added the minimum driver weight rule. I guess one advantage a small driver has is they can have move the ballast on the car for better car balance, whereas for the taller/heavier drivers they can't really do that.\n\nI believe 10kg is around 3 tenths in performance per lap, so before that rule and if your car was overweight being light was a decent adavantage. It was particularly bad problem in 2014 for example as all the cars were overweight, a lot of the tall drivers had go on strict diets to get closer to their teammates. Vergne for example was hospitalised because he passed out after a race due to dehydrating and starving himself. Hulk as well was allegedly passed over by both Mclaren and Ferrari because he was seen to be too heavy for them.\n\n So it used to be a big deal, but now it's not really anything that matters."", 'Is there any driver that is over 80kg?', ""Well, if we're talking about very small differences, a lighter driver with ballast under the seat is slightly better for the center of gravity height than having a heavier driver, even if the overall weight is the same. \n\nAlso, a shorter driver results in a lower polar moment of inertia, so the car could be very slightly more agile"", 'Very nice, thank you for insights', 'Unlikely. \n\nUnless youre as tall as ocon, albon or russell, you have to be fairly burly to be 80kg, and while fit, they definitely arent conventionally muscular.\n\nFor the majority of the grid, 80kg would make them close to or overweight by BMI (yes, BMI is not a good indicator without context)']",0,13,0.22,0,76,76,0,1,0.010000000000000009,0
