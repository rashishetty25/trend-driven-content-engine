1m37jqo,"An insider account of the inerter in F1: from its 1997 invention to McLaren‚Äôs secret ‚Äúdamper‚Äù, the 2007 Spygate scandal, and the 2022 ban. The inventor, Prof. Malcolm Smith, tells the full story in this interview.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m37jqo/an_insider_account_of_the_inerter_in_f1_from_its/,2025-07-18, Featured,"Hi r/formula1

I‚Äôm a professor of Control Engineering, and I happen to know Prof. Smith.

For those who do not know, Prof. Smith is the inventor of the inerter, a suspension device that had a huge impact on Formula 1 in the last 20 years. After its invention, the inerter was secretly used by McLaren since the Spanish Grand Prix in 2005. If you check the results of that year, the impact is quite astonishing. Renault won all the previous 4 Grands Prix. Once the inerter was deployed, McLaren went on to win 10 of the following 15 Grands Prix.

But the inerter became famous only a couple of years after as the mysterious ‚ÄúJ-damper‚Äù during the 2007 F1 Spygate. Only in 2008, journalist Craig Scarborough revealed that the J-damper was in fact a device called ‚Äúinerter‚Äù, invented by Prof. Smith at the University of Cambridge.

I had the opportunity of interviewing Prof. Smith and go deep into the story of the inerter and his involvement in Formula 1: from a chance call from Williams F1, all the way to the 2022 ban.

The interview is a goldmine of information, some of which is quite technical, while some is more big-picture moments about F1 engineering, innovation, and industrial espionage.

As the r/formula1 is a varied crowd, below I‚Äôve timestamped the Formula 1 bits if you just want the racing side of the story, without the technical explanation. If instead you are into F1 tech and you want to know how he came up with such an idea, what an inerter does, and how it‚Äôs different from a tuned mass damper, then watch the whole thing!

I‚Äôm happy to answer to some questions below.

You can watch the full interview [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhmLb2DhNYM&list=PLzqux5myRDHWaAWEt1cgI84ZbIheYT3nr&index=4).

Fantastic idea, and not that complicated.', 'Fascinating and captivating video!\nProfessor Smith clearly articulated his concept and the advantages of his work. Very clever man! \nThank you for sharing!', 'Amazing video, thanks for sharing it here! I knew about the McLaren-Cambridge connection in developing the device, but it was quite interesting to hear the details from the inventor.', 'Wow.  So, an F1 team just phones up Cambridge and says, ""Right, we have a problem, send us a PhD to work on it.""  And Williams and the university go into business together to prove out and manufacture the solution.  Corporations do this routinely, but I\'d just never thought about an F1 team partnering like that with a university.  Great video.', 'So was the banning of the inverter technology a reason for the sudden era of ‚Äúporpoising‚Äù?\nIt wasn‚Äôt explicitly stated in the video?', 'Indeed. In a way springs, dampers, and inerter are essentially on the same level, like resistors, inductors, and capacitors. They are the three basic components of a mechanical/electrical circuit. Banning one of the three seems quite arbitrary (of course with the difference that springs and dampers cannot really be banned). As Prof. Smith said, F1 is supposed to be the pinnacle of Engineering development and banning a device that allows for further engineering design feels wrong.', 'Thank you so much! I‚Äôm really glad you enjoyed the video. It was a real privilege to share Prof. Smith‚Äôs story. There were actually a few parts we couldn‚Äôt include, like how he convinced McLaren to adopt the inerter in the first place. I can‚Äôt share the full details, but just imagine the challenge: walking into McLaren and proposing a simple mechanical device that no one else on the planet had ever thought of. There was a lot of scepticism. Not an easy sell!', 'Thanks so much! I‚Äôm really glad you enjoyed it. I was in a similar boat, I‚Äôve known the story for a few years and even use it in my introductory lectures to inspire students to study control engineering. But this was the first time I had the chance to explore all the details. Spending a day in Cambridge discussing the inerter‚Äôs impact on F1 was a fantastic experience, and I‚Äôm glad so many fascinating insights made it into the final video :)', ""99% of the times this is exactly how it works, it boils down to personal connections. The majoritity of collaborations happens because someone at a company remembers of their professor and contact them. For instance back in December I received a random call from a guy who did their PhD at the same time as me and in October I will have a PhD student starting to work on their company's problem XD"", ""Not directly, I believe. I think that porpoising is caused by the reintroduction of ground effect aero in 2022 (meaning that the bottom of the car was flat since the 80', and with the 2022 regulation sculpuring of the bottom was allowed). So the banning of inerters didn‚Äôt cause it, but it removed a tool teams might‚Äôve used to help manage the bouncing.""]",213,18,0.97,213,64,64,7,1,0.0,7
