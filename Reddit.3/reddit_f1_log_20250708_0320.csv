Consistency is needed: hiring Lewis – who has won seven Drivers' World Championships since 2008 while Ferrari has won zero in the meantime – means accepting, and therefore embracing, his vision of work and the car. Those who want everything immediately, and don't understand how F1 works, consider his difficulties with a car that's too inconsistent in its behavior as a consequence of the decline of a former champion. But what the Englishman has been preaching for a while – since he assessed the situation at Maranello – is a change of philosophy, a less extreme future project, with a good aerodynamic base capable of making life easier for the drivers, who are not lacking in talent. This would be as essential as bread for Leclerc too, who through frustrations and suffering has come to humiliate himself (Saturday after qualifying)\n\nDont think this is an unreasonable take, Lewis has been talking for weeks now how theres a lot of things that need to change at Ferrari to become championship contenders,  that they need to have a solid foundation and that hes working with fred to see that happen. Also talked about it yesterday too after the race on the fan stage that theres a lot of work being done behind the scenes at Ferrari and wishes he could tell people whats going on"", ""Just in case you didn't know, la Gazzetta isn't exactly the best of sources, quality-wise.

Afterward, he said he only saw the red rear light at the last moment—too late to react.

**That made me wonder: why do F1 rain lights still blink during heavy spray?**

In light rain, blinking might help grab attention. But in dense spray, the off-moments make the car ahead briefly invisible, which is exactly when you need to see it. A solid, constantly lit rain light would likely be more visible through the mist, even if less “attention-grabbing” on paper.

According to older threads and technical docs, the rain light flashes at ~4Hz in wet conditions and ~2Hz during ERS harvesting, but a solid mode does exist (like during pit limiter). Why not use it when visibility is at its worst?

With wet races becoming more common, shouldn't the FIA consider making the rain light stay on instead of flashing in extreme spray?","[""A blinking or strobing light demands your attention, a single continuous light would eventually start being ignored because it's there constantly. It's why every emergency vehicle has strobing lights."", 'Having two lights side by side in each of the three ""points"" of the triangle, that flash on and off alternately, would possibly help.\n\nThat way there\'s a light visible all of the time, but the flashing makes the light move to still draw attention to it.', ""I've raced in rain worse than this weekend.

If someone spins or slows down dramatically you are hitting them 100% of the time. Nothing you can do about it. That's why race directors stop races or pull out the safety car. If you can't stop in half the distance you can see ahead to be clear, it is not safe to race.\n\nTLDR, it doesn't matter in the slightest. By the time you see the light you are incapable of stopping."", 'That light was off more than it was on.

I just have a question for the physics-minded people. How much does the stopping distance vary on a F1 car when applying 60psi of braking pressure in Wet vs Dry conditions?

I see everyone is comparing George's 30 psi (in the dry) to Oscar's 60 psi (in the wet) and saying Oscar 'stopped twice as quick'. From my understanding, this is not accurate. I am under the assumption a better metric that the FIA would use as a baseline or threshold would be to look at the deceleration values?

Obviously Oscar shedding the 100mph was significant, but the timing in which he does so should be mentioned also and used as part of the baseline.

""Max cannot see you because of the spray so this is not the time to throw up a surprise and brake harder than any other race leader has done behind the safety car in recent years.""\n\nThe Russell comparison is just to illustrate that last point: show what has caught out the number 2 man in the past even without the visibility issue.', 'Idk why anyone is looking at psi instead of Gs.

That\'s kinda the opposite of what you (should) do in a road car.\n\nI can\'t find good data on how much psi F1 brakes do, but apparently it can be up to 2000 psi? So 30 or 60 really is not much, definitely not proper corner braking, more like gentle slowing down like in a road car.\n\nI guess that\'s why the McL people were saying it just looks more dramatic on TV due to how fast the cars are and how the brakes work.\n\nIn that context, Russell\'s 30 psi makes even more sense that he was just warming them up, even if it looked like hard braking to us.\n\nAs for the rain, I\'m not too sure but I\'d guess that\'s the same like in a road car. If you brake too hard, the guy behind you is more likely to ram you even if the overall braking distance is longer, so braking inherently carries more risk. I also imagine F1 drivers are more gentle on the brakes in the rain to keep better control, so maybe even 60 psi is into the ""don\'t do that"" territory in the rain.\n\nBut I\'ve also seen an explanation that the main difference between Russell\'s and Piastri\'s situation was that Russel was still behind an active SC with its lights on, while Piastri was essentially under racing conditions with him controlling the speed, not the SC.

1. Mercedes - Even without verstappen merc look strong and with the new regs looking engine focused they may well be top of the field.

3. Ferrari - Will have a strong package like always, not having to switch to single turbo will give them slight advantage

4. Mclaren - Strong podium contender but given there extreme development to secure title this year it may be hard for them to compete for titles in coming years however the merc engine will work well for them

5. Williams - will be close with mclaren due to williams ignoring this year to focus on next regs and also having the merc engine, will have disadvantage due to lack of funding

6. Red Bull - Implosion for red bull with verstappens departure seeming iminent, newey wheatley leaving and horner may be out aswell, the switch to full works team may disadvantage them.

7. Alpine - Merc engine will be only saviour of this car

8. Haas - probably will have better aero and chassis than alpine but the new regs are mainly engine focused

9. Cadillac - New team so has catching up to do although will be working all throughout this year to try and catch up

I believe the driver lineup can contest if the car can deliver but each year I start with hope then things go bananas. Also it was the 2 nd or 3 rd team but I feel like with new teams coming, after a while if this continues Ferrari will be a mid team.

What should Ferrari change to become the first team and stay there? And also what was different in Schumacher era than now?","[""If the universe is truly infinite, it's bound to happen again."", ""Ferrari has all the technical/physical resources necessary to be at the very top and winning WCs\n\nTheir problem is political and cultural.\n\nAs demonstrated by listening to radio conversations with Hamilton, one of the GOAT drivers in the history of F1- Ferrari does not respect their drivers, any of them. It's in their DNA from Enzo's days. The driver is just a tiresome burden.  \n\nThe last time the driver commanded respect was Schumacher and thats ONLY because the core team leaders came with him when he joined the team. \n\nThey have very unimaginative race strategy, slow to react to changing weather or race conditions. They genuinely seem bored and uninterested, like its an ordeal to suffer through.\n\n\nId fire the race strategy team and bring in fresh DNA that actually seems to care and have the ability to adapt to rapidly changing scenarios during the race."", ""100% they can. People love to criticize Ferrari for everything they do but people forget they've still finished 2nd, 3rd, 2nd in this ground effect era and will most probably finish 2nd again this season.
