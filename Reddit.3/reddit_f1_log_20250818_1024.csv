1mt7bi5,David Coulthard Drives Alfetta 158 at Silverstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mt7bi5/david_coulthard_drives_alfetta_158_at_silverstone/,2025-08-18, Video,"Edit: redid post because I mispelled Alfetta in the title. Poor little Alfa (sad). 

This is one of the cars from the Bernie Ecclestone Collection. Red Bull purchased the entire collection and plans to build a museum at the Red Bull Ring to display them. if you do not know, Bernie had put together a collection of some of the most important cars in the history of F1. In addition to this 158, he has early Ferraris and Vanwalls. He has the Brabhams from his years of owning the team including the only known surviving fan car. While Bernie owned the collection few of the cars were seen. It is nice to see that Red Bull are dusting them off for people to see.","[""Imagine.

I contacted them to see if they would make those histories available. Sadly they said they are the property of whoever buys the cars. Hopefully Red Bull makes he information available.

1mtdvo5,MONDAY TRASH TALK THREAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mtdvo5/monday_trash_talk_thread/,2025-08-18, Discussion,"TRASH TALK 101 FOR ANYONE NEW HERE - BEACAUSE. TRASH. TALK. IS. A. GENERATIONAL. THREAD.

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY “NEW”.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.
