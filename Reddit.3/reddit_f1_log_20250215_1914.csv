With McLaren historically not being very good (I got into F1 as Mercedes appeared on the scene) having favourite drivers allowed me to have at least a little celebration now and again 😂\n\nIt’s pure coincidence that both of my favourite drivers currently happen to be at McLaren but a happy one.\n\nHistorically my favourite drivers have been Vettel and Ricciardo and I supported them despite my strong dislike of Red Bull when they were there.\xa0\n\nHaving Ric and Lando at McLaren was the first time my drivers and teams aligned and I think it strengthened my loyalty to McLaren. Would I like Oscar as much if he’d got to Alpine - probably not.']",0,80,0.41,0,57,57,0,0,0.02999999999999997,0
