1glwybq,Team Paddock RV‚Äôs in North America?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glwybq/team_paddock_rvs_in_north_america/,2024-11-07, Discussion,"Now with five races in North America is there a possibility of teams using RVs similar to what they have in Europe? Sure the races are geographically still pretty far apart but there is also a good amount of time between the races. It‚Äôs totally within reason time wise to move between sites in the time between races. Next year the hardest would be Austin to Mexico City with a full 24 hrs of drive time. But even Mexico to Las Vegas would be easy because there is almost a full month. 

It would be fun to see, they could even do PR events and set them up in different sites along the way. ","[""I'm sure the drivers would rather spend the time between Mexico and Vegas with friends and family than driving around creating content."", 'Given that there‚Äôs been a push for teams to reduce their footprint, specifically when it comes to the motor homes I‚Äôm thinking team motor homes aren‚Äôt coming to North America.\n\nTeams got pushed to reduce the size of the motor homes in Europe, I can‚Äôt see a willingness to buy motorhomes for North America, and they would need specific ones for North America to meet the different road safety regulations.\n\nThen there‚Äôs the cost cap - if buying and operating these would fall under the cost cap there‚Äôs absolutely no way teams would go for it.', ""Nearly all team personnel fly back to their home bases UK/Italy etc... between races if they aren't attending back to back races."", ""Outside of Europe organisors are required by the FIA as part of their contract to provide the facilities for the teams so no.\n\nEven if it's doable technically the rules make it unnecessary and moving the giant motorhomes around is very expensive."", 'If they did that sort of thing I would expect a PR team would staff without drivers.
