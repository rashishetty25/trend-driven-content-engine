1iazszl,F1 History Question: Head/Nec/CTE before the halo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iazszl/f1_history_question_headneccte_before_the_halo/,2025-01-27, Discussion,"I’ve never posted here, and I’m going to discuss driver death and injury, so I’ve used the NSFW tag per the rules. If I’m wrong on this just yell at me about it.

So I’m not exactly a new fan to F1 (I found it when I was trying to get clean in 2017/18 and it helped - a lot), but during this off season I wanted to go through and watch old races, learn history, etc. I’ve kinda gone through what Netflix has to offer and I’ve also watched a ton of YouTube and I’ve got an F1 pro account and have for about five years or so now and have watched a ton on that.

Something that sticks out to me is the driver deaths and injuries pre-halo. Right now I’m watching “20 Times F1 Cars Went Airborne” via the official f1 channel on YouTube and I am familiar with Senna and that…race at Imola (I have angry opinions on this. Very angry. I was 12 when he died and because F1 wasn’t really a thing here (US), I didnt see the race until recently. Fuck.)

I’m wondering, watching this footage and Senna and so many drivers before and after him, how many drivers ended up with CTE or other head/neck injuries before the halo was introduced? I know the halo isn’t a magical unicorn of less injuries, but watching drivers just look like he’s a rag doll when crashing is yikes.

","[""Because most safety measures only come up once something causes it to be brought up. Also, for more context, F1 came to be less than a decade after a world war, so people had a different concept of risk back then (same could probably be said of the grand prix drivers during the interbellum, having just come from the great war). So the result is that safety measures tended to develop at a snails pace, right until something major happens and/or someone raises a stink about it.\n\nThat said, prior to the halo (and after Senna's crash) the rule was that when drawing a line from the top of the roll hoop to the small bump in front of the steering wheel, the line should not intersect with the driver's head. This was in addition to the higher side protection around the drivers head."", 'I think CTE comes more as a result of repeated impacts to the head. This is common in American football and combat sports. While the individual impacts may not be as high in magnitude as a crash in F1, the repeated nature of these probably do more damage that may contribute to CTE.', 'One thing worth remembering is most head injuries/concussions in F1 over the last 30 years or so have come as a result of the severity of the crash and not because something entered the cockpit and hit the driver. Halo wouldn’t have helped in those cases. It’s the HANS device that has made the biggest difference in preventing concussion and whiplash injuries. \n\nSenna and Massa are the only two instances in F1, although there are cases in other series (Henry Surtees in F2, Justin Wilson in IndyCar) of fatalities due to debris striking a driver. It’s been proven that Bianchi wouldn’t have been helped by Halo because the forces the crash generated were too vast.\n\nThere are cases of drivers suffering long-term concussion effects. Luciano Burti suffered from seizures after his crash at Spa in 2001, while Dario Franchitti was forced to retire from IndyCar, but I’d say these are relatively rare.', 'It certainly happens but the halo has actually quite little to do with this protection. It protects against an impact in front of you but this isn’t a primary risk. Many more concussions and brain injury come from the head whipping around and sudden deceleration. A lot of credit goes to HANS which is quite a bit older than the halo. It primarily prevents your head from whipping around. It was implemented to prevent skull fracture deaths but most head and neck injuries are much less common with it. I’m not sure about senna, he had many factors add up but Ratzenberger who died a day earlier than Senna would likely have survived', ""I feel most of the time, security measures are introduced when there is a clear case where it could have saved a life. In the case of the Halo, things started rolling when Bianchi died in 2014. \n\nBut there was a lot of pushback, from drivers and teams. Aesthetic concerns, worries about not being able to get out in time etc. But in the end, even if the pre-halo cars are much more handsome, safety won the day. As it should.\n\nIt's just a shame that, like with so many other things in life, it first must go very wrong for people to take it seriously.\n\nThere have been countless safety developments through the years, but freak accidents can always happen. In 2009 Felipe Massa was hit in the head with a bolt that came off Barrichello's car in front and he was in a coma for quite a while and nearly lost his eye. That could still happen with a halo, so it's never safe."", 'We’ll never know, because if they admit them they’re not allowed to race. Max Verstappen admitted to post concussive symptoms in 2021, but he admitted it this year - had he admitted it at the time he wouldn’t be medically cleared.\n\nWe do know that the former F1 drivers that we see don’t appear to have as high of a rate of dementia and parkinsons as former boxers do.', 'HANS device was a big improvement also.\xa0', 'Head injury from an airborn/upside down car has been rare in F1 for a while. Even before the the Halo, the Roll-Hoop prevented a drivers head from making direct contact with the ground.\n\nWhere we have seen head injuries are 2 main scenarios a) a loose flying object hits a driver. This happened to Massa in 2009 (suspension), and wasn’t uncommon in the 80s/90s (wheels/tires) but the wheel tethers largely eliminated that risk. Scenario b) is high G accidents without direct head impact. Even without direct impact a sudden stop will slam the brain into the skull hard enough to cause damage. This happened to Kubica in 2007 and Verstappen in 2021 and many more, but has become less dangerous with the HANS deviance and as crash structures on the car improve\n\nUnfortunately we will never have hard stats for this. Drivers are incentivized to keep symptoms secret or risk not being able to drive. It took untill last year for max to reveal that after the 2021 crash, he drove the rest of the season with blurred vision and concussion like symptoms, but didn’t tell the team because he couldn’t risk the championship', ""Maria de Villota suffered a head injury testing a Marussia, colliding with a truck's tailgate, also losing an eye. She was only going about 60 kph. She died over a year later (aged 34) with a a statement from her family claiming it was “a consequence of the neurological injuries she suffered, according to what the forensic doctor has told us.” ^[\\[ref\\]](https://braininjurygroup.co.uk/news/death-spanish-f1-driver-maria-de-villota-may-linked-existing-head-injury/)\n\nGiven the speed and point of collision, the halo almost certainly would've prevented injury and consequently her death."", 'As many have already said, the HANS device has stopped the rag doll effect rather than the halo. HALO is primarily to stop items coming into the cockpit. HANS device stops the driver moving.']",2,21,0.52,2,20,20,-2,1,-0.040000000000000036,-2

He then argued that a constructor building a car for a driver is a myth. It got me wondering is there any actual evidence of constructors building cars for specific drivers?,"['No. Cars are built to be as fast as possible.\n\nThey may take feedback from one driver more seriously than the other when working on development - for example, Red Bull initially disregarded Perez’s opinion on an upgrade because Max continued to do well, but when things suddenly went wrong continuing down that path it turned out that what Perez had said had been correct, and they then had to try and go backwards to undo this upgrade.\n\nBut the base car itself isn’t built for one of the other. The upgrades aren’t ’driver X will like this’.', ""These arguments are usually made by someone who is a fan of the driver who is doing worse in a team and cannot accept they're doing badly."", ""It is a myth. Teams always build what they think is theoretically the fastest car and the drivers have to adapt to it and extract the most out of it. Favoring setup to one driver over another is a different story, but that's miles away from building a car for a driver."", 'I never understand these arguments.\nIf one driver is faster than the other and therefor knows the limitations of the car better, naturally engineers listen to their feedback more as it will be more accurate. That results in a faster car that that driver will be able to use to find the new limitations. But since the other driver wasn’t able to properly find the limits in the previous iteration they most certainly won’t be able to now.\n\nDoes that mean the car is only being developed for 1 driver? No it means one driver can adapt and improve more than the other.

1ib738m,Lewis at Ferrari will be a test of both the car and Charles Leclerc.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ib738m/lewis_at_ferrari_will_be_a_test_of_both_the_car/,2025-01-27, Discussion,"The thing I am looking forward to most by seeing Lewis Hamilton at Ferrari is a real benchmark of what that car can do, and a real benchmark for how quick Charles really is.

Hamilton may not be the driver he was 5 years ago but he still one of the quickest out there. He knows how to set up a car and he knows how to race it. If the baseline 2025 Ferrari has the form that we've seen in the last season or so a driver like Hamilton might be able to extract just a little bit more, and that would  make him very competitive.

Charles has had Vettel as a teammate but it's arguable (go ahead, argue) that Vettel was never as dominant once he left Red Bull, and he wasn't fully motivated at Ferrari towards the end, whereas Charles was full of youthful exuberance when battling him. I'm not sure if Lewis still has the same grit, but he's very commited and seems energised by the new challenge, so it will be super interesting to watch.

The season is going to be the acid test for both of them. The technical approach of Vasseur is starting to pay dividends at Ferrari, and the car does look quick. If LH44 can light make it work, we will have some fireworks at the front of the grid.","[""I want to understand when Vettels prime was exactly? Was it only when he had average teammates or teammates past their prime? I have seen this Vettels prime statement several times to undermine Leclerc and Ricciardo both of whom came to Vettel's team and defeated Vettel quite handily."", 'For me is more a test of CL and LH than the car. We know that the car is going to be at least decent (unless huge problems)  around top 3.  This year will tell us, if LH is really past his prime or/and if CL is overrated by Ferrari. Also will be intresting to see their relationship plasming in the future. Will they be able to keep a civil, almost friendly, relationship? Will they stimulate eachothers ?', ""If he's within a tenth or two of Leclerc in Bahrain, the hype will be monumental. Hopefully it happens and we have a season for the ages with a 4-way fight for the championship."", 'And a comparison between LEC and RUS', ""Ferrari will be the real story this year. If Red Bull continue to be out of form, it will be a championship battle between McLaren and Ferrari, and neither team has a driver who will emerge as the clear number two. Leclerc has tailored his entire career to Ferrari and has an incredible amount of political power behind him (Todt), while Hamilton is one of the best drivers of all time and is unlikely to be ironed out like Vettel was in 2019. However, I still think Leclerc is one of the fastest drivers over a lap, while he and Ferrari have always been in each other's way when it comes to a full WDC campaign, which has essentially been Ferrari's problem since 2010 at the latest.\n\nNorris is going to have big problems with Piastri sooner or later, and he hasn't proven that he's mentally or drivingly mature enough to compete at the highest level for a full season.\nBoth teams have also historically struggled with team order, which is likely to be even more difficult with a Leclerc-Hamilton line-up.\n\nI'm very excited to see how the dynamics develop this season."", 'Charles leclerc doubters in big 2025.', '>The season is going to be the acid test for both of them.\n\nFor me it\'s going to be an even bigger test for Lewis, than it is for Ferrari/Charles.   \nLewis doesn\'t have anything left to prove in my opinion, but these past years he didn\'t really have the consistency, speed and ""setup knowledge"" of a world champion.', 'Charles is going to win the WDC.', ""I'm buzzing to see it. I've long since said if Lewis left the sport, Charles would immediately replace him as my favourite driver.\n\nI'm expecting a Hamilton-Rosberg style season between them, not in terms of interpersonal relationship (massive TBD on that) but in specific regards to quali/race results.  I.e. I expect Charles to generally be quicker in quali, but Lewis to generally be quicker in races (with exceptions from race to race, ofc).""]",0,32,0.31,0,28,28,0,12,0.06,0
