1nsta8z,On this day in 1990 Martin Donnelly astonishingly survived an appalling crash in testing for the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez. It later inspired the backstory for the character Sonny Hayes in F1: The Movie,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nsta8z/on_this_day_in_1990_martin_donnelly_astonishingly/,2025-09-28, Throwback,,"['This is perhaps the most brutal non-fatal crash in F1 history. No giant fireballs or anything, just a crash where the car split in half and the driver, still strapped to his seat, was found lying limp on the middle on the track.', 'This was the second season I watched as a kid and the image was just frightening. IIRC Senna went and did some unbelievable lap after and looked totally shook up in the interviews after.
