This has me wondering‚Äîshould Pirelli bring back the 2018-style naming and color convention to improve clarity?

Back in 2018, each compound had its own name and color (e.g., Hypersoft, Ultrasoft, Supersoft...), which made it easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps. Since 2019, Pirelli has simplified this into just ‚ÄúSoft,‚Äù ‚ÄúMedium,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHard‚Äù regardless of which actual compound is selected, but that‚Äôs led to some confusion‚Äîespecially when C2 is called ‚ÄúSoft‚Äù one weekend and C5 gets the same label another.

So with six compounds now in regular use, and possibly staying that way into 2026 and beyond, is it time to revisit or modernize the naming system? Maybe bring back unique names and colors‚Äîor at least tweak the current system to reduce ambiguity?

Curious to hear what others think‚Äîwould reintroducing distinct compound names make things clearer, or is the current format better for casual fans?","[""I liked the rainbow, but I understand why some people didn't. Always sounded cooler when they called it the hypersoft."", 'I liked the pirelli rainbow more than what we have now. but i understand the ease of understanding just Soft - Medium - Hard and using C1-C6 for the more hardcore technical fanbase. \n\nFor someone who has no clue about the details behind the tires. Knowing that Soft goes fast but not far, Hard goes far but less fast. And medium goes in between. Is simple. Instead of having to remember one week, why they are driving on Ultrasoft, supersoft and soft tires. And the next week all of a sudden superhard, hard and medium tires.   \nHaving the same colour scheme across every week also helps distinguishing between what the soft medium or hards are. Instead having to remember this week we have orange which is the hardest, blue which is the medium, and white which is the softest. just for it to be a week later be blue for the hardest, and another race having white as the hardest tire. \n\nAnd using C1-C6 just removes any confusion between it.', "">easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps.\n\nIf everyone's tires are the same 3 compounds in a race, does it really matter? Having a different compound be called soft on different tracks doesn't really seem to make much of a difference since you can't compare across tracks directly anyways"", 'No, because it\'s terrible for viewing. Right now when you are watching a race, and you see someone pitting and putting on the ""Soft"" tyre, you know that they have put on the softest available tyre and you know they are going for a short and quick stint.\n\n\nBut with the old naming system, where ""Super Soft"" wasn\'t even the softest tyre at some tracks, you would basically have to memorise which specific tyres are available for that weekend and so if someone puts on the ""Super Soft"" when the ""Hyper Soft"" is available, it is confusing. It makes the racing much harder to follow.\n\n\nHaving the softest available for that race be the Soft, Medium, and Hard, makes the racing so much easier to follow.', ""No, the current format is better in pretty much every way. There's no loss of information, the most relevant information to the vast majority of fans is clearly visible, yet the detail of which compounds are being used is readily available.\n\nThe old system just had unnecessary confusion"", 'The Pirelli rainbow range (or whatever you want to call it) was fine for the more hardcore audience who new what compounds were being brought each weekend, but I imagine it was confusing as hell if you didn‚Äôt know what they had - one weekend one colour might have been the softest but the next it was the hardest. Was just an unnecessary barrier to entry for a newer viewer and left them at the mercy of the commentators explaining it every time. Current system is perfect because at a glance you know what‚Äôs going on.', "">\xa0Curious to hear what others think‚Äîwould reintroducing distinct compound names make things clearer, or is the current format better for casual fans?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nThe current format is the best for **during** the race.\n\n\nThe most important thing during the race is the relationship of the compounds to each other. Soft medium hard\xa0\n\n\nInstantly at a glance no matter the *actual* compounds used I know the relationship.\n\n\nAfter the race I can quibble about ultra vs super, C4 vs C5.\xa0\n\n\nBut during the race it's quicker to comprehend the difference between soft medium hard, red yellow white without understanding Ultra super mega hyper soft..."", ""Minor point, the C2 can't be called a soft. It can be a hard (C2-C3-C4) or a medium (C1-C2-C3).\n\n\nCurrent format is best. It‚Äôs clear, it's concise.\xa0"", ""No because that's not how it works. There is a soft medium and hard for each race. What their construction is really shouldn't matter. I would argue they shouldn't even have advertised that there are 6 actual compounds. It doesn't add value except for us to complain when they don't wear and say oh they should have been C1,2,3 as they are too hard. They also only ever had 3 options at each race so it made no difference as there was still a hard wearing gripper tyre, a medium wearing and slower wearing tyre.""]",446,146,0.84,446,3114,3114,1,0,0.0,1
