1otk0p0,2025 Antonelli v. 2007 Hamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otk0p0/2025_antonelli_v_2007_hamilton/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"With everyone on TV (Sky and F1TV) making a big deal that Antonelli has now scored the most points in a rookie season (122) surpassing Hamilton (109), I thought it would be interesting to compare and contrast what this actually means.

2025 - Antonelli has scored 122 points in 22 Grand Prix races and 4 Sprint races - 110 points from GPs and 12 from Sprints. This is in a season where championship points are awarded from 25 to 1 for the top 10 finishers in GPs, and  8 to 1 for the top 8 finishers in Sprints. In GP races alone, he is averaging 6.47 points per race.

2007 - Hamilton scored 109 points in 17 Grand Prix races; there were no Sprint races. In 2007 points were awarded 10 to 1 for the top 8 finishers. In those races Hamilton averaged 6.41 points per race. If the 2025 points system were in place for 2007, Hamilton would have totaled 263 points that year, averaging 15.47 points per race.

I think it's fair to say Kimi's rookie season has been very good, but isn't anywhere near as good as Lewis' rookie season in 2007. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.","[""It's a nonsense to compare different point system without conversion, so yeah, their points are really far apart."", 'Adjusting 2007 to the current system Lewis would have had 265 points or 62.4% of the maximum possible total (425), Kimi only has 21.6% (out of 565).\n\nAnd BTW that 62.4% is the highest someone who would have finished 3rd (Alonso gets one more point in the current system) has ever gotten.', ""I really wish they'd stop using the points scored stat unless they're comparing Kimi to another rookie 2010 or later."", 'More races and a whole different points system. 5th now gets the points that the winner got back then.\n\nSo I don’t think their rookie seasons are in the same league. Hamilton was fighting for the championship that season and by countback beat his 2x reigning champion team-mate Alonso.\n\nIt’s not like Antonelli has the machinery to fight for the championship unlike Hamilton did but Antonelli also has less than half the points of Russell.\n\nAntonelli is not bad by any means and drives like his debut, Canada and Brazil proves there really is promise in this guy. But Hamilton had the best rookie season in the history of F1 (unless we’re counting 1950).\n\nSo in this particular matter for Antonelli it is not a shame to be beaten by the best.', 'Lewis’ debut was sensational. It’s probably the one F1 record that might never get beaten.', 'People who think that Kimi did a better rookie season than Lewis : \n""My friend got 9/10 at his test, but I’m a better student because I got 11/20, and 11 is greater than 9 !""', 'No point paying much mind to points records as the system has not been the same over the years. Sergio Perez is 8th in all time points scored. Bottas is 6th.', 'This post is helpful for misguided newbies.', 'Not the biggest fan of Hamilton, but his rookie season was cartoonishly spectacular. I don’t think we have seen anything as good in the modern era of F1, nor are we likely to see something like that till the end of F1. 6 podiums in his first six races, scoring like 65% of the maximum possible points, being the bookie favourite for the WDC, mentally disintegrating the man who unseated Michael Friggin Schumacher. I mean obvious maths apart, that debut was so unrealistically unbelievable, they would have to fictionally nerf him when the biopic gets made just to make it seem realistic for the viewers. \n\nKimi’s debut season has been crazy good, but cm’on, Hamilton’s was a few light years ahead. Conservatively.']",3928,244,0.95,3928,8003,8003,60,1,0.0,60

1otgqka,A visual analysis of Piastris Penalty,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otgqka/a_visual_analysis_of_piastris_penalty/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"The basis for any analysis has to be the Driving Standard Guidelines obviously, which say:

>A. Overtaking on the INSIDE of a corner:

>To be entitled to be given room when overtaking on the INSIDE, the overtaking car must:

>i) Have its front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE THE MIRROR of the other car PRIOR TO AND AT THE

>APEX

>ii) Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex, and not have “dived in”.

>iii) In the Stewards’ estimation, have taken a reasonable racing line and been able to complete the

>move whilst remaining within track limits.

As well as:

>Chicanes and S-Bends:

>i) The above guides for INSIDE and OUTSIDE may apply for each element of the combination.

>Generally, priority will be given to the first corner element.

That being said, the FIA does not further clarify what overlap the overtaking car has to have inbetween the not further specified ""prior to the apex"" and the apex on it self.  
The interesting question is how they deal with cases were the overtaking car has an overlap of the frontaxle with the other cars mirrors.   
Because when you have to brake for the inside line, you have to brake earlier than for the outside line. Oscar Piastri braking earlier than Kimi Antonelli can be ovserved on his onboard.

What I did was look up at what point Piastri initiated his braking from the onboard and then cross-referenced it to the camera shot from above. I then drew some parallel lines through the front axle of Leclercs and Piastris car as well as Piastris and Antonellis rear wing.   
[The resulting picture is this](https://imgur.com/a/GYAkbFq).  
They all matched up pretty precisely, so unless all three of them had the same deviation from going straight, they should be a pretty precise 90° angle to the direction of the straight.

So from the line going through piastris front axle, it looks like Piastris front axle, at the point of braking, where you have to decide if you go for the move or not, is in fact overlapping Antonellis mirrors. Although of course the image is tilted, so the different height of the axle and the mirrors shift the perspective a bit. but even then, the picture shows a bit of safety margin.

So what the FIA is basically claryfying with their decision is:  
Even if you have an overlap on the straight and at the start of the braking zone, you are NOT entitled to a line if you have to brake harder and therefore do not have the overlap anymore.

From here on I'll quickly talk about why the other points of the sporting section do not (fully) apply.

1. ""Overlap at the Apex"" - pretty easy. They did not reach the Apex before coliding, so this can not apply. 
2. ""Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex"" - While many argued that his lock up shows that he is not in full control, I refuse this proposition. The front left tyre which he locks up is unloaded in the first corner and has a far lower friction coefficient than the right front which he does not lock up. Which means, that even though the front left locks up, he still is very close to the braking optimum (albeit flatspotting his front left). Behind him, Russell locks up in exactly the same way and is still able to turn in normally despite the lock up.
3. ""and not have “dived in”."" - A divebomb is when a car brakes later than the car in front to reach an overlap. It might include not being able to take the inside line with the resulting speed. Piastri did in fact brake earlier than Antonelli.

So the only thing left to penalize Piastri for is losing the required overlap inbetween the braking zone and the apex.  
Which should sound wrong to anybody, as it means that braking later to have that overlap and force the other driver into a wider line is fine. While braking earlier means you are left with no way out, if the outside driver does not give you room.","['Good in depth analysis.\n\nWorth noting that there is historic precedent (several incidents last year) for the idea that the overtaking car needs to have the overlap and maintain the overlap all the way to the corner, so it is not unreasonable that they applied that same logic here.\n\nWhether or not that logic is sensible to be encoded into the guidelines in the first place is another thing.', 'It says right there that the overtaking car must have its front axle at least alongside the mirror of the defending car prior to the apex. It says the exact same thing in the decision document. \n\n>""PIA did not establish the required overlap prior to and at the apex, as his front axle was not alongside the mirror of Car 12"".\n\nThat\'s the required overlap. \n\nWhether he managed to get alongside on the straight well before is pretty irrelevant. \n\n>So the only thing left to penalize Piastri for is losing the required overlap inbetween the braking zone and the apex.\n\nHe didn\'t manage to safely arrive at the apex.

Not because I didn't think he deserved it based on the rules, but because I think the rules are stupid. (And because Oscar is one of my husband's favorite drivers, and his recent problems have been really really not fun around my house.)\n\nBut, after more consideration with the lockup...

1otu0od,How can Lando win the championship. Analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otu0od/how_can_lando_win_the_championship_analysis/,2025-11-10, Statistics,"
1st: Lando Norris (390 points)
2nd: Oscar Piastri (24 points behind Lando)
3rd: Max Verstappen (49 points behind Lando)
With  3 races left (Las Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi), with a total of 83 points still available.

Norris must be 26 or more points ahead of his closest rival after the Qatar Grand Prix to be crowned champion.

Remaining Races & Maximum Points (Total: 83)
 * Las Vegas GP: 25 points
 * Qatar GP (Sprint Weekend): 33 points (8 from Sprint + 25 from GP)
 * Abu Dhabi GP: 25 points

Lando Norris can  mathematically eliminate Max Verstappen, and second, he must secure the title against his teammate.

A: Eliminating Max Verstappen ( las vegas )
 After Las Vegas, 58 points will remain (33 in Qatar + 25 in Abu Dhabi). If Norris's lead over Verstappen is 59 points or more, Verstappen is mathematically eliminated.
 Norris must outscore Verstappen by 10 points in Las Vegas to be 59+ points clear.

 * Norris finishes P1 (25 pts), Verstappen finishes P3 (15 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P2 (18 pts), Verstappen finishes P6 (8 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P3 (15 pts), Verstappen finishes P8 (4 pts) or lower. (Gap = 60+)
 * Norris finishes P4 (12 pts), Verstappen finishes P9 (2 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P5 (10 pts), Verstappen finishes P10 (1 pt) or lower. (Gap = 58+, but Verstappen would lose on countback).
 * Norris finishes P6 (8 pts) or lower, he cannot eliminate Verstappen in Las Vegas, regardless of Verstappen's result.


 B: Winning the Championship vs. Piastri (Qatar)
Norris needs to gain just 2 net points over Piastri across the next two events (Las Vegas GP and Qatar Sprint/GP).


Scenario 1: Norris gains in Las Vegas
Norris wins (25 pts), Piastri finishes 2nd (18 pts).
Norris gains 7 points.
Norris's lead grows from 24 to 31 points.
Norris could afford to be outscored by Piastri by 5 points and still win the championship (31 - 5 = 26).

Scenario 2: Piastri gain in Las Vegas
Piastri wins (25 pts), Norris finishes 2nd (18 pts).
Piastri gains 7 points.
 
Norris's lead shrinks from 24 to 17 points.
The fight would go to Qatar, where Norris would need to outscore Piastri by 9 points (17 + 9 = 26) over the Sprint and GP to clinch the title there.

Scenario 3: DNF for Norris
 Piastri wins (25 pts), Norris has a DNF (0 pts).
 Piastri gains 25 points.
Piastri takes a 1-point lead in the championship.

C: Abu Dhabi
Any scenario where Norris leaves Qatar with a lead of 25 points or less will take the championship to the final race.
If the gap is 25 points, Piastri would have to win the race with Norris scoring zero points
