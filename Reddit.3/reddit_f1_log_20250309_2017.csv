For me, I think it will end up being Perez and Jak Crawford. I think they'll want a young driver and a vet. Bottas is probably the best vet available, but it will probably be Perez because he's from Mexico and can bring big sponsor money and a lot of Mexican fans.
And Jak because I think they'll want a young American driver and I don't think that Herta is as strong a connection as it was before.

I think it should be Bottas and Yuki. Yuki doesn't have a contract for next year and even though he's not so young anymore, he still has potential and hasn't gotten the shot he deserves. And Bottas is the best vet available.

And I personally would love for it to be Bottas and Mick Schumacher. This is meant to just be who you would love to see, I know this won't happen, I know that it shouldn't happen, but man I really want to see Mick drive anything other than a Haas. Him and Valterri are my favourite recent drivers.

Bit of an odd question - is there any way to see driver on-boards for past races like you can with F1 TV in live races? As I'm in Australia, F1 TV isn't offered for us so I'm unsure how it works.

I'm trying to find Carlos Sainz onboard for his victory lap after Australia 2024.

Thank you!","['Aussie here. You can get F1 TV Access (the basic level subscription) here and see all onboards from all past seasons. You just won’t be able to see current seasons until they’re over.

Piastri has the talent, but he couldn't deliver every weekend last year. But when he did, he was sometimes even faster than Lando.

However, when Norris had his Singapore-level pace… nobody could catch him—except himself, almost crashing into the wall.

Can Norris handle the pressure if the car is the fastest and he has bad luck or poor performances? Or maybe we'll see Norris 2.0 with no mistakes, crushing everybody. Or maybe Piastri will get as comfortable as he was in the lower categories, where he won almost every race…

All in all, I'm very excited for the new season! Hopefully, it will be a tight season with more teams fighting for wins than just one.

With seasons increasing in length, the scope for learning from a replacement has also increased. Moreover, the coming season has many rookie drivers. Finally, the season after has a host of rule changes and it will be important to have a pair of drivers that are sufficiently experienced to deal with new conditions.

Bringing these elements together, the question becomes who will be the first to be replaced? One of the rookies, one of the seasoned drivers? And who will they be replaced by?
