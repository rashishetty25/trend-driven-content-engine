1mek52g,Hungarian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mek52g/hungarian_grand_prix/,2025-08-01, News,"Weather forecast for the weekend. This event in 2006 saw Button get his first F1 race win. 


The Hungarian Grand Prix in 2006 marked the last occasion the event was held in wet conditions. The track was already wet at the beginning of the race, making it a historic first for a wet Hungarian Grand Prix. 
All competitors started on intermediate tires, except for Barrichello, who opted for full wets. 

Early on, polesitter Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen quickly established his lead. Both Alonso and Schumacher delivered impressive climbs through the field. Schumacher advanced from 11th to 6th by the first corner, while Alonso moved up from 15th with a notably aggressive and hard-fought opening lap. Alonso then engaged in a straight fight with Schumacher for several laps before executing a pass on the outside of Turn 5, securing 3rd place. He further progressed to take the lead after the McLaren drivers, Pedro de la Rosa and R√§ikk√∂nen, made their pit stops. 

Traditionally, Bridgestone wet-weather tires were dominant in non-dry conditions, but in this race, the Japanese compound appeared to be an exception. All drivers using Bridgestone tires, including those from Ferrari, struggled with significantly reduced pace compared to their rivals. Schumacher found himself battling Giancarlo Fisichella for 5th place, ultimately losing his front wing in a mid-corner incident while fending off snap-oversteer, resulting in a forced pit stop that put him a lap down. Soon after, Jenson Button showcased remarkable overtaking prowess, passing Massa, Fisichella, and Schumacher in under two laps. R√§ikk√∂nen, facing difficulties on his second set of tires, crashed into the rear of Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso, launching the car and necessitating a safety car period. This incident allowed Alonso to pit, enabling Schumacher to regain the lead lap. 
Another beneficiary of the safety car was Jenson Button, who chose not to pit and climbed to 2nd position behind Alonso. Following the safety car restart, Button challenged Alonso, but eventually had to pit for fuel. Alonso maintained the lead, but a subsequent pit stop for dry tires proved disastrous as his right-rear wheel nut detached, causing him to lose control and crash. 

Button inherited the lead and held it unchallenged for the remainder of the race. Schumacher made his way up to 2nd by remaining on intermediate tires as other drivers made further stops.

Most changes on the sporting regulations are to largely bring them into line with the most recent updates (2025/04/30) of the 2025 regulations. Including the tyre regulations we had for Monaco this year.      
Some changes I did notice from a quick glance:       

* Grid drops at a driver's next race now have a 12 month period to serve them in. So Valtteri will be off the hook from his incident in the 2024 Abu Dhabi GP should he race next year.

* A document will be provided to all teams no later than the 30th June this year which details all the provisional information and limitations in regards to ERS-K usage and deployment for races, the following season. Any amendments will be confirmed by 15th September. Subsequent modifications may only be applied for new circuits or where this is a significant difference between vehicle fundamentals & FIA correlated values

* There is now a much easier to read list of Parc Ferme Permitted Works

I'm sure there are more. Same as well with the technical regulations.","[""\\>Grid drops at a driver's next race now have a 12 month period to serve them in.\n\nJenson Button return confirmed."", 'W for Bottas my fucking guy', ""What do you mean no later than June 30th?

Or is their advantage something that the other teams still don‚Äôt know yet and could well be an advantage in 26, especially tyre management.

It won't be an issue. Their current advantage is that they have insane tyre management with consistent pace and downforce no matter the track or ride height.

1mf1y1e,Largest performance changes mid-season in F1 history,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mf1y1e/largest_performance_changes_midseason_in_f1/,2025-08-01, Discussion,"I wanted to discuss the largest shifts in performance midseason. In 2023, I recall how McLaren had a significant jump in performance mid-season, going from a midfield team to a consistent podium contender.

I‚Äôm curious if Ferrari, Mercedes, or Red Bull seem to have that in the cards this year, as it appeared that even McLaren in 2023 was not expecting the significant jump, which has also evolved into their dominance this year. I‚Äôm also cognizant that the regulation changes may mean that there is just less performance to get out of the car in 2025, than there was in ‚Äò22 or ‚Äò23.
