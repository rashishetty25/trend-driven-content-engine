Racing is rarely done in the rain anymore primarily due to extremely poor visibility, not because drivers can't control the cars. Modern tires and diffusers create a massive amount of spray, making it impossible for drivers to see other cars, even at close distances and high speeds. This lack of visibility significantly increases the risk of severe accidents. While drivers like Carlos Sainz enjoy the challenge of driving in the rain, the safety concerns related to visibility with multiple cars on the track are the main reason for the reduced frequency of rain races.

Genuinely (naively) thought we might have a 4-way battle at one point."", 'Sorry for the late Post today, I was at work.', 'I was considering making a post to recap a season so far but as you‚Äôve created this post i might as well use it.\n\nSure we‚Äôre not yet at summer break but Hungary race won‚Äôt change much.\n\nHere‚Äôs my review of a season so far in a Positive/Negative/Neutral ratings.\n\n*Positives*\n\n\n**McLaren**\n\nThe team grew even more from last year, car is so far bulletproof and a clear pace setter in vas majority of races so far. Team is operating on a really strong level with much less mistakes than last year. They‚Äôre handling inter team battle really well (but considering other teams are realistically out of the fight it‚Äôs probably easier) Both drivers are showing great level of driving with Oscar having a slight edge in consistency over Lando. But even with slight mistakes Lando makes, he‚Äôs still keeping himself in a Fight.\n\n**Max Verstappen**\n\nProbably the only bright spot of the Team this year so far. He‚Äôs always ready to pounce and grab the win when the opportunity arrives. Really can‚Äôt ask anything more from a driver and Max this season is the only thing keeping mclaren drivers on their toes.\n\n**Williams and Albon**\n\nWilliams delivered on a huge growth this year, definitely a positive step in the right direction and mostly thanks to incredible consistency from Alex. Everyone doubted him, and put him under a lot of pressure with Carlos coming into a team but he handled himself brilliantly. You could say Carlos had a few unlucky ones this year but Alex has him beat handily so far and he showa no signs of stopping.\n\n**Pierre Gasly**\n\nI think it‚Äôs unfair to see how little recognition Pierre gets this year. He‚Äôs driving the wheels of of that Alpine and i genuinely sometimes can‚Äôt believe how he pulls it off. A team that has myriad of problems with management (or should i rather say missmanagement), morale, performance, he‚Äôs still getting regular q3 entries with some outstanding Qualy laps, and some wonderful race drives. He‚Äôs definitely one of top driver performers this year.\n\n**Sauber**\n\nFrom a team that i expected the least, and when i expected them to wait out a Year before transforming into Audi. They surprised me the most. It looks like they really consolidated their management and leadership, nailed a driver pairing and even brought upgrades to the car to be genuinely competetive with other midfielders. It‚Äôs great to see them being rewarded with a podium (And what a podium it was). Both Nico and Gabi had great races.\xa0\n\n**George Russell**\n\nThis is the year where George really visibly stepped up. Lewis leaving mercedes created a big power vacuum, and George took it upon himself to take it. He‚Äôs shown some real stellar drives this year, and barely put a foot wrong so far this year. He‚Äôs finally showing his true potential that he was being called for years. Ultimately he‚Äôs being let down by Mercedes and a car they delivered him (much like Leclerc).\n\n\n**Charles Leclerc**\n\nThere‚Äôs really not much more a team can ask from their driver. Charles is doing absolute maximum Ferrari is able to do. He‚Äôs consistent, his racecraft is wonderful, tyre management is great, Charles is having a stellar driving season so far and is being let down by the car that simpy doesn‚Äôt have the pace to be competetive for the wins. He really continued on his driving form from last season in the best possible way, and it‚Äôs a real shame he cannot crown it with wins.\n\nNeutrals\n\n** Racing bulls**\n\nI was thinking, is it really fair not to put them in the positives column, they had some stellar drives, bunch of points, and Hadjar really impressed with some great drives as a Rookie. It‚Äôs true but whole driver seat drama in RB family, really leaves bad taste. They started the season strong with both Yuki and Hadjar, then when the swap happened lawson had a lot of issues, but in the end he‚Äôs also slowly regaining confidence and driving better. Strategy wise they‚Äôre still the biggest clowns of the field and that is the only reason why i‚Äôm not rating them positively.\n\n**HAAS**\n\nHaas this year might be the definition of neutral. While they had some great drives from both drivers and the pairing seems to work really well, they are really showing no signs of some great improvement and growth. They are always in the mix to score some points but also can be nowhere near them.\n\n\n**Lewis Hamilton**\n\n\nTransition to the red team has been really painful for Lewis. I cannot say he disappointed because it would be unfair, he had few stellar drives but mostly he was average at best. The car doesn‚Äôt suit him and it‚Äôs painfully obvious. Charles has and edge on him but i think that was also expected. Overall, pacewise i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs even that far from Charles. And i genuinely think that Carlos wouldn‚Äôt be better than Lewis this year in Ferrari even though he‚Äôd have a lot more experience with red cars. Lewis has shown sparks of his true self in some races and i hope he continues to improve in the rest of the season but ultimately Ferrari gave him an ass of a car and it‚Äôs hampering him a Lot.\n\n\n*Negatives*\n\n\n**Ferrari**\n\n\nI think it‚Äôs fair to say that ferrari is abbysmal this year. From a team that was genuinely competetive to Mclaren last season to the team that is a 5th best car on some occasions this year. A shame because they have a super interesting drivers lineup and they‚Äôve managed to fuck them up.\n\n**Red Bull**\n\nA fall from grace of last year spiraled to an abyssmal level this year, Car is barely drivable even for Max, losing a bunch of crucial staff members, comically atrocious missmanagement of the team and 2nd car being virtually non existant. \xa0The whole Yuki/Liam situation was ridiculous, pit stop crew is also out of shape for many races this year.\n\n**Aston Martin**\n\nReally don‚Äôt know what to say about them as a team. Stroll is non existant for most of the races, Alonso is driving average this season with some good results.\n\n**Alpine**\n\nTeam missmanagement (whole doohan colapinto saga), car going nowhere pacewise even with upgrades, Gasly is the only bright spot of the team.\n\n\nI understand i haven‚Äôt mentioned some stuff and drivers, but post is already too long :)', 'Is the 16 points the largest lead the whole year?', 'best rivalries \nLeclerc v russel\nalbon vs antonelli \nrest of the field vs each other - p12 - p20 brutal', 'Just one points finish in last 7 races is ridiculous. \n\nNot that he‚Äôs at fault for them all, but he‚Äôd be sacked at Red Bull or exchanged for an VCARB driver', 'Antonelli reeks of underdevelopment.

Although both mclarens and Max can get through to Q3 easily, track evolution can be big. So setting only a lap at the beginning of the session would make them vulnerable to high tradk evolution.

This is easy enough to implement during the race, but if everyone sets off from the grid at the same time it doesn't make any difference from starting under the Safety Car.

My proposal is to send the cars off at 3 or 4 second intervals (longer would be ideal, but the limit will be informed by the lap time under VSC divided by the number of cars, then reduced further to create a margin for error). I'm not sure what the exact procedure would look like, but as an example, the starting lights could alternate extinguishing two lights on each side to indicate the next car on each side can proceed.

Once underway, the cars can circulate to clear the standing water, with enough of a gap between them to avoid the worst of the spray. The current rules already allow for multiple formation laps, so there wouldn't need to be any change there.

1mb1wd2,2024 Sainz vs 2025 Hamilton: It's not really close,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mb1wd2/2024_sainz_vs_2025_hamilton_its_not_really_close/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"Last year Carlos Sainz ended up with 9 podiums for Ferrari. He won Australia and Mexico. And in addition to 7 other podiums for Carlos, he also had 5 5th place finishes and a 4th. 15 top 5 finishes.

Through 13 races last year Seinz had 190 points. Hamilton has 109 (no I didn't transpose the numbers).

And yet you hear very little about Sainz now, struggling along to do the best he can with Williams; he's getting beat there by his own teammate this year, so there's that. Obviously it takes a little time to acclimate to a new environment; a reason that Hamilton OBVIOUSLY is given the benefit of the doubt on, despite last year's results at Mercedes.

Today Sainz's own pit crew screwed him over. And they then decided on a 2 stopper, and it simply didn't go his way today. Hamilton had one of his better races; passing a bunch of guys with his updated equipment and getting up to where he's normally at.

I do not feel that Hamilton is ever a threat to win a race. LeClerc has been consistently outperforming the world champion. It doesn't really feel competitive. Just like last year didn't feel that competitive with George Russell at Mercedes. I feel that, of the 8 seats that make up McClaren, Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, Hamilton is at best 6th, with the jury being out as way too early on Antonelli. Only the 2nd RB seat doesn't compare to Lewis.

In hindsight, the manner in which Sainz was quickly ushered out of Ferrari seems sort of sickening at this point. He's left to one choice, no options. And he's done career wise, unless one of the big three/four invite him to a seat, and obviously Ferrari isn't in the cards for that.

This seems alot different from a driver CHOOSING to leave because he's not the number one driver and wants to go somewhere else to be the big dog, like what happened with Daniel Riccardo, who should probably never have left RedBull. He's the last great 2nd driver they've had in years.

Guys like Sainz and Botas, who was a pretty darn productive driver for Mercedes, they both got the short end. Watching Nico's 3rd place finish a few weeks ago got me really thinking about this. There are some pretty damn good drivers out there, without the equipment to show their talent, left hoping for inclement weather or a miracle for them to have a quality day.

I've always loved Alonso, and have watched his struggle for many years now. About half the time he's ""the best of the rest"". Not this year obviously. But you watch him and you see the talent after all these years, and you cannot help but wonder how he'd do in a number one seat at one of the best places. Like with Sainz.
