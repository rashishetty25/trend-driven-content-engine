Could shape out to be an interesting middle of the season especially with extra pressure on McLaren to essentially not screw up the advantage.', 'Mercedes must be gleeful regarding 2026 prospects, works team advantage, two really fast drivers, they are in drivers seat for both WDC&WCC', 'If Merc get a car that‚Äôs as good as McLaren‚Äôs I genuinely think George can claw back the thirty or so points between him and Piastri.\xa0\n\nI think Russell‚Äôs been the second best driver so far this year.\xa0\n\n[EDIT] Ok getting lots of interesting replies so this is a long edit.\xa0Wow I didn‚Äôt realise that lots of people rated Oscar‚Äôs season so far as high as they do and in some cases better than Max‚Äôs. I think Max has definitely been the best driver this year. Just look at the team mate gaps in Quali and race pace down the grid. Furthermore Verstappen has literally outqualified Piastri in half the races this year amd outraced him in a third of them. And that Red Bull is nowhere near McLaren.\nAnd I would also rate George and probably Leclerc over Piastri. But tbf the three of them are very tight imo.\n\nHere‚Äôs my ‚Äújustification‚Äù for this.\n\nPiastri is on 131 points.\xa0\n\nIf Russell was in Piastri‚Äôs seat at McLaren these are the results I‚Äôd say he would‚Äôve got.\n\nAustralia - P2, Lando was on it that race but George had solid pace throughout and didn‚Äôt spin off like Oscar did so easy P2.\n\nChina sprint - P2, Made a great opportunistic move on Leclerc irl. His Quali lap was decent enough it would‚Äôve had him top three on the grid and then he probably would‚Äôve just done what Oscar did irl.\n\nChina - P1, Yeah George was absolutely on it this race and would have beaten Lando similarly to Oscar.\xa0\n\nJapan - P3, His small mistake in Quali left him P5 irl. In the McLaren he‚Äôd have been ahead of Leclerc but wouldnt have been able to pass Max or Norris.\n\nBahrain - P1, He was on fire this race and I‚Äôd assume Lando still messes up Q3 so it‚Äôs pole and win for George.\n\nSaudi Arabia - P2, His Quali lap was actually really strong so it‚Äôs touch and go weather he would‚Äôve beaten Max to pole. Either way he‚Äôd have taken the lead at the start but he was really bad on his tyres so he wound‚Äônt have been able to do what Oscar did and even though overtaking was hard I‚Äôd guess he would have ended P2.\n\nMiami sprint - P2, he was decent in the sprint but not spectacular. All the other top cars ran into difficulties though and I doubt he was that bad that Hamilton would‚Äôve beaten him.\xa0\n\nMiami - P1, Overall Norris would still get pushed off by Max on lap 1 and George would have found his way through after probably qualifying fourth or fifth. And he would‚Äôve been the lead McLaren after lap 1 and thus won the race. Also his race pace was really strong so I don‚Äôt think Norris could‚Äôve caught up.\n\nObviously it‚Äôs subjective but if that were what happened it would leave him on 140 points. Nine more than what Piastri has.', 'The title would better match Ferrari', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Mercedes has so far been reluctant to further develop the current Silver Arrow. However, the factory team has now announced a major upgrade offensive for the upcoming races.**\n\n> Mercedes is currently on track with second place in the team standings. The Silver Arrows have been significantly more competitive in the first six races of the season than last year. With four podium finishes for George Russell, the haul is impressive. Only the significant gap to market leader McLaren somewhat dampens the record.\n\n> But that\'s about to change. At the first six overseas Grands Prix, the engineers held back on upgrades. At the European season opener in Imola, Mercedes also wants to fully launch the development race. But that doesn\'t mean nothing has happened at the first races of the year.\n\n> ""We\'ve already made a few upgrades. They weren\'t particularly big or sexy, but there were always new things coming in,"" reveals technical director James Allison. The fact that Mercedes hasn\'t been mentioned much in the FIA\'s upgrade lists so far is also due to the calendar. ""We\'re already a quarter of the way through the season. The teams have been faced with many races in a row. It\'s quite difficult to make upgrades to the car when the races are flying around you like that.""\n\n> **Improvement with Imola upgrade?**\nBut that\'s about to change. After Miami, the engineers will have a two-week break to catch their breath. The European season opener traditionally also marks the start of the major development race. It\'s expected that most teams have something bigger planned for Imola. According to Allison, that\'s also the case with Mercedes.\n\n> ""In the next races, we\'ll be bringing new parts that are more visible from the outside. With a bit of luck, they should be able to improve our results."" The AMG W16 showed its strengths in the first few races, especially in qualifying. Over the race distance, however, the drivers struggled to maintain their good starting positions. McLaren, Red Bull, and Ferrari seem to be taking better care of their tires.\n\n> Allison is confident that Mercedes can improve in this area with the new parts: ""Hopefully, the upgrades we bring in the next two or three races will swing the pendulum a bit in our direction. We\'ll continue to try to work on tire temperatures in the race. That should help with the results as well.""\n\n> **New parts for Imola, Barcelona and Montreal.**\nThe second triple-header of the season, Imola, Monaco, and Barcelona, \u200b\u200bis now on the schedule. Allison doesn\'t believe the picture will change much compared to the first few races: ""We\'ve always been strong in qualifying so far, so we can expect to continue putting the car near the front of the grid. With a bit of luck, we\'ll even be a bit stronger here with the upgrades.""\n\n> However, the engineers\' focus is on improving race pace: ""We have to make sure that we can deliver on Sunday what we promise on Saturday. The most important thing is to control the temperatures in the tires and ensure that the car can show the pace it is capable of.""\n\n> However, further development is far from halted after the triple-header. Team boss Toto Wolff reveals: ""We have something planned for Imola, Barcelona, \u200b\u200band even Montreal."" Whether they can still catch up with McLaren is questionable, however. If the gap continues to grow, Mercedes will likely also discontinue development of the current model at some point.

13:00 - 13:20 After Felbermayr spins you can see who I believe is Ciconte continue down the road wihtout lights flashing.

Hard to believe that this wasn't reported right away. I could verify that the 3 frontrunners Pin, Palmowski, and Chambers turned on their lights later.

1ki7w0t,Should F1 Teams Face Higher Fees for Technical Protests?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ki7w0t/should_f1_teams_face_higher_fees_for_technical/,2025-05-09, Discussion,"After some recent discussions I've been reflecting on the current state of technical protests in Formula 1 and believe there's room for improvement in the system to ensure it's used judiciously.  
  
Recently we have seen Red Bull (surprise surprise) make complaints official and publicly regard McLaren specifically. It has been rear wings, front wings, tires and brakes.   
  
Being a fan for years I am actually getting quite tired of Red Bull's approach over the last couple of decades where any team is competitive.

**Current Structure:**  
Under the FIA's International Sporting Code, teams can lodge formal protests during race weekends by paying a fee, typically around ‚Ç¨1,000 from what I could find. If the protest is upheld, this fee is refunded. However, this fee is really a small amount and doesn't seem to deter teams from filing frequent complaints, some of which often seem to lack substantial grounds.  
  
Red Bull as I mentioned, actively lodges both official protests as well as public complaints (often to the media)  raising concerns about rival teams' car components. Basically any time any other team has been competitive or has brought real innovations to their team and the sport. While my focus is on this side of things, in general Red Bull have lodged a variety of complaints consistently.  
  
For instance:

* **Miami Grand Prix 2025**: Red Bull protested George Russell's third-place finish, alleging he didn't slow adequately under yellow flags. The FIA reviewed the evidence and dismissed the protest, allowing Russell to retain his position. 
* **Tyre Cooling Allegations**: Red Bull accused McLaren of employing illegal tyre-cooling methods. The FIA investigated and found no irregularities
* **Brake System Scrutiny**: Red Bull questioned the legality of McLaren's rear brake systems, leading to further investigations that found no wrongdoing.

The flexi wing complaints is another example. Here you can argue that some have been legitimate complaints, the mini DRS while clever I think warranted a revisit.

I think it is important to note though that unlike years gone by teams have to submit their technically specifications and updates to the FIA and the FIA approve all current car updates. There are many cases where there are loop holes and grey areas which teams exploit and that is part and parcel of the sport. I personally love how teams read through these detailed regulations and manage to still come up with clever and innovative evolutions to the cars.

While it's essential to uphold the sport's integrity, the frequency and timing of such complaints, specifically from one team seams to more to do with attempts to stifle competition rather than genuine attempts to uphold that integrity. 

**I believe there should be a change made here:**

To ensure that protests are made with genuine intent and substantial evidence, I believe the following should really be changed.

1. **Increased Protest Fee**: Raise the fee for lodging a protest to a more substantial amount, say ‚Ç¨50,000.
2. **Refund Conditions**:
   * **Full Refund**: If the protest is upheld and leads to a rule clarification, future change or penalty.
   * **Partial Refund**: If the protest is found to be legitimate but doesn't result in any action.
   * **No Refund**: If the protest is deemed frivolous or without merit.
3. **Support Requirement**: Depending maybe regarding the size of complaint it may require backing from at least one other team to lodge a protest, ensuring that concerns are shared and not solely strategic.
4. If there is no significant evidence but a team has publicly made claims to the media and if the protest is deemed without merit or frivolous fines will be issued.

I believe these changes would discourage teams more from filing protests without substantial grounds and encourage a focus on innovation and performance.

In my view, Red Bull has taken advantage of the current protest system as a way to suppress competition. Especially during Christian Horner‚Äôs two-decade leadership, it seems like part of their strategy hasn‚Äôt just been to observe rival teams as all teams do but to actively complain often when they have struggled on innovating and evolving their own car. There‚Äôs also a noticeable pattern of Red Bull making public accusations through the media, even when there‚Äôs little or no evidence to support their claims.

While they‚Äôve occasionally hit on genuine issues like the Ferrari fuel flow controversy, which itself was quietly buried, the sheer volume of protests and accusations doesn't justify it. In my opinion, this kind of tactic is unhealthy for the sport and undermines fair competition.","[""So.\n\nThe FIA made rules and the FIA needs to make sure the rules are enforced. \n\nWhat do you think is cheaper?
