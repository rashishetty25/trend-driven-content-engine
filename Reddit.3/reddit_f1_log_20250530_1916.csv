I think we‚Äôve been very good at being open about it, just talking about it.‚Äù\nWhile he and Norris are aiming for a maiden title win this season, McLaren‚Äôs current level is such that the Australian reckons several more title fights are on the horizon ‚Äì meaning maintaining harmony between the pair is a top priority.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre never going to do anything that‚Äôs unsportsmanlike or puts the team in a bad light or puts ourselves in a bad light. I think that‚Äôs just not who Lando and I are,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúOf course, we want to go out and beat each other every weekend, but we‚Äôre never going to cross that line that‚Äôs going to cause damage that can‚Äôt be repaired. Because, I‚Äôve said it a few times now, we don‚Äôt want just one opportunity at this.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both at McLaren for a very long time after this year, and we want to fight for the championship every single year. I think we both understand it‚Äôs pretty unwise to try and win one championship and bring the house down with it.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs a unique situation, as Piastri acknowledged. It‚Äôs not so long ago since Mercedes encountered fallout between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg as the former childhood friends fell out in similar circumstances, and the Australian praised McLaren for its hands-off handling of things.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think every team would handle it as we are, no,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúAt the same time, there are not many teams in our situation with a car and drivers that are strong enough‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got a very good lead in the Constructors‚Äô Championship at the moment and, whilst we‚Äôre continuing to build that gap, I think it‚Äôs the right thing to do to let us both try and fight for a championship.‚Äù\n\nThere will come a point where he believes the team should start imposing team orders as it closes in on the titles ‚Äì but only if one of the pair develops a big enough lead to warrant some level of support.\n\n‚ÄúI think, once it‚Äôs mathematically impossible, probably,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúBut no, I think we both want to win or try and fight for this championship and score our own points.\n\n‚ÄúOf course, if there becomes a time, later in the year, where it is genuinely impossible ‚Äì or very close to it ‚Äì then, then, yes, maybe that will change, but I don‚Äôt see that happening for a very long time.‚Äù\n\nHaving had a run of momentum that saw him take wins in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, Piastri was beaten by Norris at Imola and Monaco, and said he suspects this pattern of momentum switching will continue through the year.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to ebb and flow a bit through the whole year,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúBut, I mean, I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôve analysed what went a little bit wrong in Monaco.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, it still wasn‚Äôt a terrible weekend, but just not as good as some of the weekends have been this year for me. So we‚Äôve looked at what we can do a bit better, and we‚Äôll try and put that in action.‚Äù\n\n___________________________________________\n\nPiastri‚Äôs comfort with the dynamic at McLaren will be welcomed by Zak Brown, who outlined his position on his driver‚Äôs assured equality during an exclusive interview with PlanetF1.com.\n\n‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs quite an easy thing to work through,‚Äù Brown explained.\n\n‚ÄúOur drivers aren‚Äôt asking for favouritism, they‚Äôre asking for fairness, and that‚Äôs what they get.\n\n‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre very comfortable; may the best man win.\n\n‚ÄúHopefully we give them a car in an environment where you‚Äôre going into the last race and it‚Äôs the two of them competing, and they didn‚Äôt take points off each other to the point where it lets Max [Verstappen] or someone else get in there.\n\n‚ÄúBut if so, then whoever wins the Drivers‚Äô Championship has done a better job.‚Äù\n\nsacrifice [Yuki] Tsunoda‚Äôs qualifying because he‚Äôs giving Max a tow or whatever.‚ÄúI get compromising the second car at Red Bull because it‚Äôs not competing for the Drivers‚Äô Championship, so it‚Äôs an easy decision to make.\n\n‚ÄúBut when you‚Äôve got two drivers first and second in the championship and are separated by less than one second place finish, how do you possibly even consider standing one down into a supporting role?\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just no way we will.‚Äù', 'Why do people get upset with this?

Please¬†[direct these to the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/formula1)¬†instead.","[""I made a simple web app to compare qualifying performance of drivers with their teammates. You can see how well a driver did (H2H, mean and median gap) against their teammate\n\n* over a season\n* over all qualifying sessions they took part in as teammates \n* against all his teammates at a particular circuit\n\nI compared times from sessions both drivers participated in. I.e. if driver A made it to Q3 and driver B got out in Q1, then their Q1 times were used. This means results such as Norris v Piastri in 2025 Saudi went to Norris because he crashed and couldn't set a Q3 time but was faster in Q2.\n\nThere is also a fourth feature where you can see how far off a driver's best time is from the fastest driver for every quali session in a season. I thought it would be interesting to see how the gap to the fastest changes over a year (like how Verstappen got closer and closer to Mercedes in 2020, or how Alonso got further away in 2023).\n\nData was fetched from the Jolpica (formerly Ergast) API. Only data from the 1994 season onwards is available (so unfortunately no Prost v Senna). There is also a lot of data from the late 90s and early 2000s seasons missing, so you may find it weird that only 32 results for Coulthard v Hakkinen across their career are shown.\n\nI am planning to make a post here about it but wanted some feedback first.

There are some circuits where the race is defined in the first laps, because passing is so difficult in narrow streets. 

Wouldn't it make more sense that certain circuits would be used only for sprints? It would be a very short race, and the short format would put more pressure on qualifiers, where the real fun is. And it would be a test of skill, not of endurance.

Besides, think of the chaos.","['No? Why would anyone want that', 'How would a sprint at Monaco be any better?   The only hope of a mixup is pit stops. Take that away and it‚Äôs just a 30 lap parade.', 'You think a 90 minute race is about endurance? Wait until you see the Le Man 24hr next month.\n\nAlso, no on sprints. They were probably the worst idea for F1 in the last 5 years', 'Yes. That‚Äôs a terrible idea. Pitch it to MBS he will love it.', ""It's better to remove the sprint format."", ""No because sometimes even the most boring tracks can pull off good races, like Sochi 2021. Can you imagine if the race ended by like lap 30 and we never got the rain shenanigans? Less laps actually would mean less probability of the 'chaos' that you speak of.\n\nAnd more importantly, try to pitch circuits the idea that they'll have less racing, but will have to pay the same fee that they do normally. And how they will convince fans to pay the same ticket prices for less racing."", ""I can see the logic, but in circuits where overtake is pretty bad, the longer race can at least, sometimes, give us an interesting strategy battle, or the chance of Safety Car happening. These things sometimes get to make a race that would be boring without overtakes, interesting. Even Monaco can be good with a timely safety car and strategies (if it wasn't for the pile up). \n\nA sprint only takes these out. Sure, we would have the qualifying, but it would further doom the main event without even a chance of something interesting to occur."", 'I mean the point of a sprint is that you want more overtakes per lap because they‚Äôre pushing the car and tyres without expectation of hanging out for a safety car or saving for 1 or 2 stop.\n\nPutting it on a track where there‚Äôs limited overtaking spots just means you get an extremely boring sprint.\n\nI think it‚Äôs just time to accept that Monaco isn‚Äôt really good to race on. It‚Äôs been that way since the 80s when the cars were smaller, we can go ‚Äòmake them smaller‚Äô all we want but there‚Äôs only so far you can go while maintaining the speed F1 is known and loved for. Formula E makes for far better racing there specifically because the cars are slower - it makes the overtaking opportunities longer, but is that really where we want to go?', ""That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom.""]",0,15,0.1,0,14,14,0,15,0.1,0
