Martin gives clear reasoning behind his retirements and more detailed information about what his race plan was, whereas all the other drivers would barely give an answer. Instead of just saying, ""Gearbox"" for example, Martin would go in to more specifics and use a way of words that he does now I'm his commentary work; ""The gearbox had enough basically. First I lost 2nd and 3rd gear, then 5th and 6th so I had to stay in 4th and try and make the end, but unfortunately it turned in to a bag of nuts and bolts very quickly which sent me home early"".

1iywct3,Changes to the 2025 Formula One Sporting Regulations as agreed by today WMSC Meeting,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iywct3/changes_to_the_2025_formula_one_sporting/,2025-02-26, Technical,"[The Sporting Regulations are linked here](https://www.fia.com/system/files/documents/fia_2025_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_4_-_2025-02-26.pdf)

This is a non-exhaustive list of all the changes to the Sporting Regulations that were published today following a meeting of the WMSC.
Note that due to more than 1 member of the WMSC being barred from attending said meeting and this seemingly being in violation of the FIA statutes, it remains to be seen if these changes are valid or not.

Either way:

* A clarification to the number of stewards at any weekend which will now be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 (Not including the local national steward)

* The regulations in regards to drivers with serious mechanical difficulties leaving the track has been updated to:         
 - > ""Any driver whose car has significant and obvious damage to a structural component which results in it being in a condition presenting an immediate risk of endangering the driver or others, or whose car has a significant failure or fault which means it cannot reasonably return to the pit lane without unnecessarily impeding another competitor or otherwise hindering the Competition must leave the track as soon as it is safe to do so.""

 - Under the sole discretion of the race director such a car can be instructed to leave the track as soon as it is safe to do so.

* The Heat Index required to trigger a Heat Hazard has been increased to 31¬∞C (Was 30.5). Once the heat hazard has been declared, all components of the driver cooling system must be fitted with the exception of the cooling media and the driver's personal equipment (i.e. Cooling vest). At the start of any sprint or race session for which the heat hazard has been declared, all components of the Driver Cooling System must be installed. If a driver wishes to not wear his personal cooling equipment, everything else must still be installed including the cooling medium. In addition an extra 0.5kg of ballast will be added into the cockpit for those drivers who don't wear their personal cooling equipment.

* The entire section of the Usage of Restricted Number Components has been made void.

* The usage of tyres has now been clarified. Tyres fitted in the pit lane will now be deemed to have been used once the car leaves the pitlane with those tyres fitted. Tyres fitted on the grid will be deemed used when the car leaves it's grid position under its own power with those tyres fitted.

* The additional regulations in regards to the Monaco specific tyre rules (Must use 3 sets of 2 different specs) have been added. If a race is suspended and does not restart and a driver has only used 1 set of tyres, they will have an additional 30s added on top of the usual 30s added on for not using 2 specifications of tyres.

* From 24h prior to the start of the competition, if it is requested by the technical delegate, any competitor must provide without delay any team specific items such as, but not limited to, adaptors, fixtures, lifting devices, tools, wiring looms or connectors defined in and required by the Appendices to the Technical Regulations to facilitate the undertaking of scrutineering checks

* For cars starting from pitlane, the time for work being allowed in the fast lane has changed from 90 seconds after the start of the formation lap to 15 seconds prior to the start of the formation lap. This is now equal to those cars starting on the grid.

* Once all cars on track have passed the end of pit lane on the formation lap, the pit exit will open and all cars starting from the pit lane must leave the pit lane and join the formation lap. All such cars must enter the pit lane and the end of the formation lap.

* The driver of any car immobilised on the grid at any time after the formation lap has started and before the start of a race must raise their hands above their head to signal they have a problem. These cars will then be pushed into the inner lane (Not the fast lane) where the team may attempt to restart it.

* Extra formation laps can now be brought into place at any point after the start of the formation lap and before the start of any race (Before it was technically only possible once all cars had returned to the grid after the formation lap).       
 - Once all cars have completed their formation lap returned to their grid position, orange lights will be illuminated on the gantry and a board saying **EXTRA FORMATION LAP** will be displayed. After 2 seconds the green lights will be illuminated on the gantry, signalling for the cars to complete an extra formation lap.

* For an aborted start (Which now can also be called at any point after the start of the formation lap and before the start of any race), once all cars have completed their formation lap and returned to their grid spots, the orange lights will be illuminated on the gantry and a board saying **ABORTED START** will be displayed. All cars should remain in their positions and team personnel and equipment will be permitted access to the grid. 

* The Sporting Regulations now include a full text version of the FIA Motorsport Privacy Notice in regards to Data Protection and what personal data they collect

As said, this was non-exhaustive and I have most likely missed something. 

The 2025 technical regulations, The 2025 Financial Regulations and the 2026 Technical Regulations were also updated today.","['The aborted start and new formation lap point is funny because the issue was that not all cars finished the formation lap. So the same case as it did happen is still not clarified?\xa0', ""Seems like this will really fuck over anyone starting from pit lane, there won't be enough time to get to pit exit before the start lights go out."", 'Wait all components?
