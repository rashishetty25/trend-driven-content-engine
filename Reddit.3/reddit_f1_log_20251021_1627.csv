I‚Äôm also just relieved he‚Äôs getting praise from the general fanbase for this, because there have been a few performances this season where I felt he did a top-class drive but didn‚Äôt get recognition from casual fans for it because of the car being unremarkable or overshadowed (Saudi Arabia, Spa, Monza.)\n\nThe moves and pace Antonelli had after pitting were brilliant and I wonder if he could‚Äôve had his first on track fight with his teammate had things gone another way. If he had this level of performance at the European tracks, his stock would be much higher - it‚Äôs strange how the moment they leave Europe, he‚Äôs the fiery rookie I remember from F4. I hope he can end the season on a good note.\n\nI‚Äôm disappointed in Sainz, but also not surprised? This year has been a rollercoaster and with him becoming more comfortable in the team, we can see him trying old tricks. The problem is, he shouldn‚Äôt trust rookies to make space for him like that. To me it seems like Sainz still has the mentality that everyone he‚Äôs racing is a top driver with years of experience. But he needs to reel back in his expectations for how other drivers will react to his moves. Other than that one silly mistake though, I‚Äôm pleased with his pace and continued improvement with this car.\n\nAnother underrated weekend from Bearman. He is just so quick when he‚Äôs feeling confident, and nobody can say he doesn‚Äôt have the willingness to risk moves. I‚Äôm excited to see how he grows and one day how he does in Ferrari.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say Norris had a good weekend because he didn‚Äôt complete the sprint (not by his own fault, but we have no idea how he would‚Äôve done) and he was stuck behind Leclerc for almost 90% of the race. But compared to Piastri, Norris looks like a real WDC contender. As in... Piastri was absolutely nowhere this weekend. With this being the 4th weekend in a row he‚Äôs struggled to make an impact, it feels like he‚Äôs on a mental spiral downward. I know he had this problem last season too but his improvement from the end of last season to the start of this one seemed so big that I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd have the same issue. Even though I‚Äôm not rooting for him to win it all, I do hope he can find some good results again just to make it a three-way race rather than a two-way race between Norris and Verstappen with him slowly dwindling away.\n\nI‚Äôm surprised people thought of this race as boring. There was action all over the field and Leclerc vs Norris alone had me on the edge of my seat. COTA is my home track and I‚Äôm always proud when we come here because it never fails to deliver excitement in some way.', ""F1 needs to sort out its tire situation. We consistently are having weekends this year with very low deg and very consistent performance regardless of compounds, which isn't amazing. I understand that Pirelli doesn't love the optics of their tires blowing up or failing or whatever, but there needs to be something changed for the future seasons to make tire strategy more consequential, if at all possible.\n\nLando looked very strong today compared to Piastri. Max looked like 2023. Oscar has had three stinker weekends in a row and is looking rattled- he needs to pull off a win in the next couple weeks to claw back what he's lost. A DNF would be absolutely brutal for his chances, especially with Max looking like a man possessed.\n\nThat said... give me a Ver-Nor-Pia for the next four races and I believe we end up with 1 point separating all three for AD. Fingers crossed, this year has gotten much more interesting."", ""One thing that was very apparent at this race is the commentators didn't have any idea that this was a simple medium-soft or soft-medium race. I guess part of that is down to the sprint weekend meaning there is less data to go off of, but we're late into Charles first stint and the F1TV team thinks he might be able to hold on long enough to take a hard tire to the end. 5 laps later and Yuki and others start putting on softs to go to the end. \n\nI feel like the broadcast is consistently surprised by how the teams are managing tires, Monza was another good example where they were caught out."", 'If I was a betting man I would put my money on Norris right now.

However, everything can always be better ... these are my realistic thoughts (mostly realistic in any case...) to improve the show. What do you think?

1. Points system should be expanded maybe down to 15th. Easy and a total no-brainer IMO. Would give the backmarkers more to race for.
2. Sprint race qualification. Nice enough with more racing / show, but right now its a carbon copy of the race and IMO thats a missed opportunity. Some say reverse grid. I'm not really for that. Instead I would bring back the one lap shootout for qualifying. That would bring enough randomness into the game (track conditions, track evolution). Order = championship position, let the leader go first.
3. Sprint race. This is harder reg. the setup ... but I think it should be doable in our time and computer age: many tracks has different configurations. Change it between sprint and race, so that the sprint has a different configuration. I know sectors will have to be changed for timing. And track will have to be modified, maybe with some paint and curbes worst case scenario. But think that would bring something extra.
4. Would love to see an extra race between the formula 1 drivers - maybe on none-sprint-weekends? - in equal machinery. Could be sponsored locally per event: In germany GT4 porsches, in US some Chevy stock car etc. etc. Expensive and difficult to do maybe ... but think it would create a huge interest. Here qualifying could be an oldfashioned 1 hour test session (to let the drivers learn the machinery) and the grid determined by the sessions order.

I know F1 is trying to come up with new ways to bring in more fans and Lee more fans interested. F1 has a unique team and constructor element to its sport that you don‚Äôt see in American racing series. F1 is always rumored to be going in the direction of more sprints and more short action events to not lose the attention of fans, they think the only way to gain new viewers is to be able to make a race short enough to post on TikTok, Reels, & YouTube Shorts. But I think biggest complaint is often the lack of action, especially for 1st place. So what if instead of adding races to calendar and/or adding sprints what if a few weekends out of the year they did a tag team ‚Äúendurance‚Äù style race.

You could still do qualifying a similar way. 
Session 1, each team picks a number 1 driver to do a Quali run.
Session 2 the number 2s go out, then session 3, is the best driver from each team in Q1 and q2 go out again for final q3 starting grid. 
Then race day you pick which driver to start and  they drive a full race or maybe only 2/3-3/4. And you still require 1 mandatory pit for each driver, then when they finish their full race instead of crossing finish on last lap, they enter pit lane and 2nd driver leaves their garage once pit crew gets the first car jacked up and wheeled into the garage. Then the 2nd driver goes out and does their 50+ laps through the finish line. Nobody gets individual points just team points maybe only for top 5 or top 7 teams. And if you want to add individual element, you could pair it with a sprint weekend to score individual points

1obylse,Piastri chances are still strong - I built a Python Monte Carlo F1 Simulator to predict the WDC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1obylse/piastri_chances_are_still_strong_i_built_a_python/,2025-10-21, Statistics,"With the title fight tightening up after the US GP (Piastri P5, Verstappen P1), I got tired of guessing, so I built a Python-based Monte Carlo simulation to project the final Drivers' Championship outcome.

How real are Verstappen's chances? 

  
1. Track-Specific Performance Weights (Adjustable)

I created a custom system that applies a performance multiplier (a weight) to each driver for the specific characteristics of the remaining tracks (Mexico, Brazil, Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi).

* **Example:** Verstappen gets a `+20% likelihood boost` for Mexico City's high-altitude/high-downforce circuit. This addresses the fact that some cars simply perform better on specific layouts.

# 2. Deterministic ""What If"" Analysis

The script automatically runs a hard-math check to see what happens if Verstappen wins out. Which outside of 2023 - is pretty unlikely even given his current form.

Right now even if Max wins out and Piastri gets 2nd, Piastri takes the championship. 

`--- Deterministic 'What If' Analysis ---`  
`SCENARIO: If VER wins EVERY remaining race/sprint:`  
   `PIA CAN still win the WDC.`  
   `PIA Max Points (if 2nd every time): 450`  
   `VER Guaranteed Points: 447`  
`-------------------------------------------`



The chances for winning a race are the big question. You can run the script and change them. The reality is Max needs a good run + some bad luck from McLaren. 

With these default weights:   
  
`--- World Drivers' Championship Simulation Results (Track-Adjusted) ---`  
`Total Simulations Run: 10,000`  
  
`--- Championship Win Probability ---`  
`Driver | WDC Chance`  
`------ | ----------`  
`PIA    | 74.33%`  
`NOR    | 25.57%`  
`VER    | 0.10%`

  
It does not take a DNF into account - although there is a chance the driver does not score.
