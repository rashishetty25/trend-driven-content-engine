But the Qatar track has no character whatsoever, I've never been able to discern the layout as it all looks exactly the same. It is a sea of flat tarmac, floodlights, and high-speed corners going into medium-speed corners. No identifiable corners, no landmarks for reference. 

Miami, a fairly universally disliked track, has distinct parts and buildings like the stadium and intersection for reference, so you can tell where in the track the rivers are. Bahrain, a similarly situated track with a barrage of floodlights in the middle of a desert, has the large tower by the first corner and goes up & down a hill for some kind of reference point. China has the gigantic pit building great first corner complex and a thrilling final few corners. Abu Dhabi, known for it's lack of character, is fairly nicely split into thirds with the high speed first sector, double-straight, and 90° corners galore.

Is this just me? Are there any other tracks that have a distinct lack of character that I am missing?


EDIT: I agree that the races it's produced have been exciting and fully respect that people enjoy driving on it in-game. The layout clearly works.

I'm assuming the ones with no points would probably also flounder in F4 regional, but do the top 5 or top 10 have a good shot at podiums in weaker f4 regionals, or even F3/F2 for drivers such as pulling and pin.

Furthermore, how do they stack up to actual F1/F2 drivers. Does someone like Bianca Bustamante actually have the skill to backup mocking actual f1 drivers like Lance Stroll, or would Lance Stroll in a wig lap every single f1 academy driver comfortably without breaking a sweat in equivalent machinery over a full grand prix length.

Senna became successful, whereas Sutton started working as the Sao-Paolo native\'s personal photographer for a short period of time when he was in the lower ranks of open wheel racing (between 1981 and 1984).\nSenna first met Sutton when he took some pictures of him in his junior Formula car. Impressed, he asked Sutton to join his team and the two began working together, resulting in many prominent personalities getting to know the Brazilian driver, thanks to the clicks.\nEventually, Senna would meet the right people who would help accelerate his F1 dream, which not only did he realize, but also conquered. By winning three World Championships, he became one of the best and most beloved drivers of all time.\nSutton\'s role in shaping his career won\'t be forgotten and his time with Senna will be immortalized in the upcoming Netflix miniseries about the late great legend.\nSutton took to his own Instagram account to share his feelings about their friendship before the premiere.
