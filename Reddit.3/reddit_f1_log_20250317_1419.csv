Thanks","['Felt bad for Yuki. He did everything right and was going to score good points then the team completely screwed up the strategy and pit stops.  Same with Ferrari. I get what they were trying to do, but it was the complete wrong call. \n\nFrom the looks of it with all the rookies and veterans, we might be seeing a lot of solo teams in the points. Last year it was always two RB, two Mercedes, two Ferrari, two McLaren in some order. Now, two McLaren, two Ferrari and a bunch of one offs.  Should be pretty fun.', 'That race was like a crucible for Norris. Every weakness he had displayed in previous seasons was thrown at him and he overcame every single one. \n\n* Held P1 at the start\n* learned to shut the door on Max\n* managed conditions changing\n* made the right calls\n* pitted for inters (!!) \n* had a proper dialogue with his race engineer, asked questions and asked A LOT\n* managed restarts without losing positions\n* recovered from a mistake\n* managed pressure from behind\n\nI was impressed. \n\nThe speed of the McLaren is something else though, it was already decent in the rain but then the period of slick running was ominous. Norris pulled away from both Piastri and Verstappen on a drier track which suggests the gap would have been much bigger in a dry race.\n\nPiastri had a good race until he had to chase down Norris. At that point he pushed far too hard and the mistakes started to come. He put a tyre in the gravel and could have ended up in the same situation as Alonso. Being too eager to get back out in front of Max meant he took far too much speed back into the track and ended up in the grass. It was a bad day for him. \n\nMax will always be a menace even though he himself didn‚Äôt have the best of races making rare mistakes in the rain. Sliding around on slicks after making the call to stay out and gamble was quite the move. He nearly ended up binning it in the pit lane. \n\nFerrari‚Ä¶what can be said about Ferrari that hasn‚Äôt already been said. The communication is dire and they seem incapable of learning from their mistakes. Rain strategy is a Ferrari weak point but this time they had Hamilton there for advice and they didn‚Äôt want it. The car did not look good and the pace that had been seen on Friday never materialised. Shanghai is next and they weren‚Äôt very good there either last year. Ferrari have problems and I don‚Äôt think Lewis Hamilton will be able to fix it. \n\nShout out to Albon and Tsunoda, one of which had the perfect strategy and the other whose race was wrecked by bad strategy. Yuki did everything correctly this weekend but his team screwed him. \n\nAntonelli was also very impressive. Coming back from P16 to P4 in his first race although granted he was massively out of position for the car he had. But he did an excellent job at managing his race pace.', 'The most curious thing for me was how similar to the end of the past season everything was, in terms of performance. McLaren being the much faster car when the tires drop, Max being able to hang in there at the beginning until that point, Ferrari apparently compromising their setup, Mercedes being a sort of unremarkable good team... it seems like things only shook up a little at the back of the grid (mostly Haas...).\n\nObviously this is the first race and we should see teams making leaps as they adjust to new packages and all that, but it was weirdly underwhelming despite a very eventful race.', 'Saturday evening we were told Ferrari intentionally went for a wet weather set up which impacted quali performance. That doesn‚Äôt explain why Charles done basically the same lap time on 7 lap old softs in Q2 and new softs in Q3‚Ä¶ same issues as last season? \n\nOn race day with both cars in clean air Leclerc was 1-1.5 seconds a lap slower than Norris. It‚Äôs been years now and Ferrari don‚Äôt seem to know why they suck so bad when it rains. Wet or dry set up it doesn‚Äôt matter.\n\nThe strategy blunder took me back to 2022 and making wrong decisions when a race gets chaotic. Poor communication over the radio, especially to Lewis and he got a ‚ÄòWelcome to Ferrari‚Äô experience. \n\nI do think Ferrari have more performance to unlock. Will it be in China? Very unlikely considering turns 1-4 sequence were a big weakness last season. Weather forecast looks stable. I think McLaren will be 30 seconds down the road with Max, George and the two Ferrari‚Äôs behind. \n\n\nOn a side note I was so disappointed with the F1 timing app on race day. Huge lag spikes causing it to run out of sequence with the race, ruined my usual set up of watching and tracking sector times.', 'I keep being amazed how McLaren is able be very fast while keeping their tyres cool enough. On the other side they seem to have the ability to warmup their tyres faster than any other team. Would love to know their trick and why no other team seem to be able to do so this far in the current regulations.', ""Interesting to hear James Vowles' comment about Sainz sitting on the pit wall saying there is no way the Ferraris are going to stay on track with the hard tyres and telling the pitwall the exact lap to pit Albon.\n\nIt shows just how much the drivers are (usually) the experts in knowing when to change tyres if they are given the right info about the weather.  It's not often we have a driver actually on the pitwall calling out the exact lap to change.  Maybe engineers generally should concede to drivers when there is doubt about going from dry to wet and vice versa: unless of course Sainz is an outlier in being more expert than most drivers in that knowledge..."", ""Haas probably would have had a double points finish if they didn't second guess themselves when the commentators were roasting them for putting new inters on during the safety car when everyone else went on slicks.\n\nThe part that bothered me is that no matter what the conditions were, Haas would be the slowest car no matter what when doing the same thing as everyone else. They should have had the mentality to live and die by the sword.\n\nI dont think it's fair to hold it against the 4 teams who didn't make the quick decision to pit right away like Lando, the Mercs, Albon, Stroll, and Hulkenberg did because *that* decision was not super obvious, but I think Haas second guessing their initial decision before was particularly egregious. If you're last, you're last. I'd rather finish last by taking a swing at something that can *maybe* work even if rather unlikely, than getting there through self-fulfilling prophecy."", 'I don‚Äôt know very much about race direction or how to run a track or what it‚Äôs like to be a marshal, and I definitely don‚Äôt mean any disrespect toward any of these roles, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that the overall management of the weekend was average. It wasn‚Äôt just in F1, either. I noticed that the response time for incidents, getting recovery vehicles out, clearing the track, etc. was slow during the other Formula series and the Supercars events as well. Marshals seemed almost lackadaisical at times, standing around or moving slowly, like they weren‚Äôt sure what they were supposed to be doing. I can only assume this is some sort of leadership issue since it was happening across the whole weekend. Maybe the people calling the shots didn‚Äôt know what they were doing, or communication between areas wasn‚Äôt great, or it was particularly difficult to manage getting recovery vehicles onto the circuit due to its layout. I have no idea, so I‚Äôm just speculating. It would be great to hear some insight if anyone has any experience working Albert Park.\n\nOverall, I‚Äôm appreciative as we all should be to the people who work up to and over the course of the weekend to make the GP happen, but it feels like at times slow decision making delayed us from being able to get back to racing as early as we should have, and that‚Äôs never a good thing.', 'For years we the fans, along with many comentators, pundits, drivers, ex-drivers, and team members have been saying ""just let them race"" when it comes to wet weather racing. After the death of Bianchi, there was a major swing too far in the other direction, and we\'ve had years of knowing the moment there\'s a slight bit of rain it\'ll be red flagged until it\'s almost time for dry tires again, and it\'s been crap.\n\nYesterday seemed like a reversal of this trend, finally. Yes, it wasn\'t as wet as Spa 2021, but we actually saw wet weather racing, and the race wasn\'t red flagged multiple times like it would have been in previous years. When there was a crash, the safety car was released, the track cleared in a few laps, and off we went again. No red flag, no extended delays as they don\'t want a standing start during a 2 lap burst of rain, no arguments over ""he should be able to change tyres under a red flag"", just straight up traditional racing.\n\nPersonally I loved it, and hope race control keep up this trend. I\'m just amazed at the sheer volume of comments in the race thread, and post race thread, about how unsafe everything was, how it should have been red flagged. We can\'t have it both ways, and I definitely prefer the more measured risk acceptance model of racing we saw yesterday.', ""Well that was an entertaining race to start the season.

It seems like at the very least they are free from being the last place team in terms of their pace. Hulk rewarded their trust in him right away with some nice points on his Sauber debut. \n* **Ferrari**. Well Ferrari is doing Ferrari things. First of all I really expected more from them. Especially after Friday. It thought they'd have had the pace to take the fight to McLaren. Maybe they just went wrong in their setup. I hope that them having to raise their ride height isn't going to be a recurring problem this season... Also they really should've followed Max into the pits. \n* **Mercedes** had the driver that impressed me the most yesterday in Antonelli. Yes, he had his spin, yes George was P3 in front of him. Still for his very first race in F1, that was mighty impressive. I'm looking forward to seeing what more he can do in F1. It looks like Mercedes have a bright future with a very talented young driver. George an anonymous in P3 in the end, I don't mean that in a bad way btw. I just don't remember the tv direction showing him at all. He just drove a clean race in no mans land between the McLarens and Max on the one hand and the pack behind Alex behind him. \n* **Red Bull** really should've pitted Lawson a lap earlier. Why do you leave the inexperienced guy out on the mediums that long when McLarens have already skated off track? On the other hand they tried to gamble with Max. It didn't pay off, but it also didn't cost them. The right choice to make at the time. Max got mighty close to Lando in the end due to Lando making an error in turn 6. Like Max said, I don't think he could've gone for an overtake because there really was only one dry line. But it was fun to look at. \n* **McLaren** really are the class of the field. Although I really hope that Australia is an outlier in terms of pace for McLaren. If they are as far up the road in terms of pace and tyre management as it seems, we're in for 2023 part 2 Orange edition. They almost lost the win when both cars went off, but Lando managed to hold on. Oscar also did great to keep his head down and salvaged some points in the end. You never know how close it will be at the end of the season, so maybe those few points will come in clutch in the end.""]",21,150,0.86,21,146,146,3,13,-0.020000000000000018,3

1jdbu2n,Speculation:  Did lack of institutional memory contribute to Haas' struggles in Melbourne?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jdbu2n/speculation_did_lack_of_institutional_memory/,2025-03-17, Discussion,"OK first of all, definition

Institutional memory is the collective experience of all the personnel in an organization to handle a given situation.  It's the biggest thing you lose when experienced personnel head for greener pastures and their replacements have to do their learning the hard way, with little in the way of mentorship.

Awkward and unsatisfactory outcomes in the short term are usually the consequence of losing your institutional memory.

With that said, here's what we know.

Haas is rolling around not just with 2 brand new drivers, but also 2 brand new race engineers.  Gary Gannon and Mark Slade are both gone, replaced by new voices that weren't on the F1 grid last year.

Furthermore, many of the technical people, including technical chief Andrea de Zordo, have only 1 year of experience as Komatsu purged the team of Steiner's people.

I suspect one of the big reasons that Haas came out so flat, and by ""flat"" I mean the lack of pace that was a problem for Haas even without the rain, is because they have very little actual F1 experience anywhere in their squad right now.  This culminated in delays and isses with putting the right adjustments into the car as everyone struggles to communicate with everyone else and a lot of people are just kinda trying to figure things out on the fly that an experienced person would simply know what to say, or what to do.  The result is chaos.

Last year you at least had longtime veterans dotting the roster, especially Slade, Nico and Kevin who all had many years of experience in the league.  And if, say, Gannon's side of the paddock had issues and he had to reach beyond his own experience to address a problem, Mark was right there to ask.  R

ight now the only experienced person anywhere in their front of house at Haas is Esteban, who was on a different team last year.  With everyone all figuring it out together, there's no one to really lean on when one side of the paddock or the other is struggling to crack a tough problem.

That strikes me as a situation where getting a reliable setup for their cars is going to be extra tricky because you just don't have that longstanding experience to fall back on if the first attempt doesn't work.

Like if a driver isn't happy with a given setup, you need engineers who can think 2-3 adjustments ahead in order to figure out what can be quickly tried to get them back on the track with a better setup than they had before, and I'm not sure the Haas team has that right now.

Throw in the fact that Bearman is a rookie and Ocon isn't a native English speaker, with the attending problems in providing reliable feedback in the first place, and you have a perfect storm of ""learning curve issues"" with communication, feedback and adjustments that could easily hold a team back.

The good news is that these may not be experienced people, but they are talented people who should climb the learning curve relatively quickly.  Unfortunately for many of them, ""relatively quickly"" in this sport can be measured in seasons, not races.  By throwing so many inexperienced personnel into the deep end at once I think Haas may be in a situation where they're forced to use this year as a pure shakedown and focus almost exclusively on 2026, which is a pity for those of us who hoped for bigger things..","[""It definitely can't have helped. Getting both two new drivers and two new race engineers is a lot. Especially when 3 out of the 4 are essentially rookies in their field.\n\nBut Haas are also just tied to Ferrari development. When Ferrari aren't strong, like they don't seem to be now, Haas are always down as well."", ""I'm sure someone will compile the laptime comparison charts and show how much laptime improvements each team has gained after we have had a couple of dry races. But my initial impression is that Haas has simply missed the boat and especially VCARB and Williams have gained even more relatively vs the top 4 teams let alone vs Haas and Alpine. In quali there were 17 cars within 1 sec from each other at some point, and that's almost unheard of in F1 history...\n\nCan't really blame it on the drivers though. Ollie had 6 (FP) weekends/races with the team last year, so he knows exactly how the current car compares to the previous one, including setups quirks. Ocon is a veteran nowadays and is at least or even more fluent in English than the likes of Barichello, Kimi and Massa who were known to give good feed back and were credited by drivers/TPs of developing the car or making setups."", 'Listening to the pit wall conversation with Ocon on him pushing to go back to slicks was frustrating. The wall needed to take charge (because they have a weather radar in front of them) rather than Ocon in that situation.\n\nI‚Äôm sure it will work itself out in due time, but it‚Äôs better to find and identify the issues now than after 16 races', ""Great assessment. I wasn't aware that Ayao got rid of so many veterans in the team--didn't he actually say in an interview or something that he wanted to promote people in-house, especially those who stayed loyal with Haas for all these years?

This is their 10th year in F1 and it looks like the 8th season where they finish 8th or below."", '![gif](giphy|j6uK36y32LxQs)', 'Yes the Ferrari point is a very good one\xa0\n\n2018, 2022 and 2024 are both Haas and Ferrari‚Äôs strongest cars of the last decade.\xa0']",16,12,0.68,16,11,11,5,5,0.0,5

He was stuck behind worst cars on the grid the entire race. Yes, he was P6 when it started pouring down, but he didn‚Äôt pit, hence the position. Everyone in front was pitting. And then he crashed. Had he pit, he would be 2 positions from being last. He was literally nowhere. Yuki was fighting Ferrari and Mercedes at the same time, while Lawson couldn‚Äôt even fight Kick Sauber.', 'Ah, the New Zealand Harold lol. Sure.', '> see .co.nz\n\nYeah that checks out', 'Idk mate, today was kinda of a disaster', 'Ah yes a unbiased New Zealand source', 'Yeah the guy.. battling the worst performing car/team of the weekend all race long.. IN A RED BULL (AT WORST 3RD BEST CAR) while his teammate finishes #2 is SURELY going to help Red Bull this season!', 'I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting to read here but Lawson‚Äôs ability to provide good feedback being his biggest strength that can save Red Bull‚Äôs season wasn‚Äôt that.', '...leaving a trail of debris to trip up opponents...', ""I don't think Liam had a good race as much as the next person, but this post seems deliberate. The archive link doesn't open and the post is behind a pay wall. But more than that - this is the NZ herald and an opinion piece no less, what did you expect? 'hey guys guess what? our driver is bad?' of course those who support are going to look for positives.\n\nPersonally I feel Liam was promoted earlier than warranted and a year or more at Racing Bulls would have gone a long way into cementing him as a great driver for RBR. But because Tsunoda or Sainz don't satisfy Horner and Marko's criteria, we are not going to see a proper transition and support for the 2nd seat and hold our hands up in the air saying 'oh that seat is cursed'""]",0,111,0.35,0,1441,1441,0,1,0.0,0
