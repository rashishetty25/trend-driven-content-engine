1kmeizt,"On this day 30 years ago, the Formula 1 career of 1992 champion Nigel Mansell came to an end at the Spanish Grand Prix, pulling into the pits voluntarily to end his brief and disastrous spell with McLaren.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmeizt/on_this_day_30_years_ago_the_formula_1_career_of/,2025-05-14, Throwback,,"[""The joke at the time was that Mansell couldn't fit into the car because his wallet was so big."", ""After his very lucrative return to the sport at the end of 1994 (bagging him 2.7 million dollars in just three races, nine times as much as his team mate Damon Hill made all year), Mansell was not retained by the Williams team, who opted for a youthful approach, hiring David Coulthard instead. Mansell at this point was far and away the oldest driver on the grid, more than five years older than Martin Brundle and Roberto Moreno.\n\n\n\nMansell then signed with McLaren as their title sponsor Marlboro wanted a World Champion (while the team themselves and their engine supplier were opposed to the idea). Mansell was to be teamed with future champion Mika Häkkinen.\n\n\n\nThe 1995 season began in an embarrassing fashion for the team as Mansell could simply not fit into the car, and Mark Blundell drove the first two races in his stead. Mansell's first start for Mclaren in Imola didn't end well as he collided with Eddie Irvine with a points finish in sight, only finishing 10^(th). Frustrated with the car's handling and uncompetitiveness, Mansell came into the pits on lap 18 of the Spanish Grand Prix, got out of the car and called it quits. Mark Blundell was once again called up, finishing off the rest of the season for the team, ironically having to make way for David Coulthard in 1996.\n\n\n\nMany years later, in 2015, Mansell said he regretted this decision and that he should've continued on, attempting to improve the car.\n\n\n\nMansell tested on the very same track for the Jordan team a year later, but decided against a comeback, despite the team's sponsors being willing to pay for his services."", ""I'm just old enough to remember the (small) ripple of excitement in Ireland when the Jordan rumours were circulating."", 'Now there’s a mustache you could set your watch to.', '30 years ago we had 2 of the best mustaches to ever race in their respective sports.

1kmrbr9,Why does Ferrari consider Monza as the “home race “instead of Imola which is names after Enzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmrbr9/why_does_ferrari_consider_monza_as_the_home_race/,2025-05-14, Discussion,"Even though Imola (Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari) is named after Enzo and Dino, I’ve noticed that Ferrari always places more importance on the Monza race, considering it their true home race. Ferrari’s victories at Monza in the past have been among the most important to the team, second only to winning the Championship. 

Is there a historical reason for Ferrari’s greater attachment to Monza?","['Imola wasnt always on the calendar and Monza has always been the “Italian grand prix”', 'Monza has been the Italian GP since 1949 except for 1980. Enzo particularly liked Monza for its Straights and called it an engine circuit', ""Because it's hosted the Italian GP since 1922 (with the exceptions of Livorno in '37, Portello in '47, Turin in '48, Imola in '80, and the inaugural edition in Montichiari in 1921), while Imola has been a GP venue only since the Imola Grand Prix in '63, and in a stable way only since the Dino Ferrari GP in '79, the 1980 Italian GP, the dispute with the ACI and the Sammarinese GP's institution.\n\nNaples, Pescara, Siracusa, Modena, Pergusa, Rome, Vallelunga, Bari, Sanremo have all held a Formula One race before Imola.\n\nMonza has got more continuity and is the more historical race between the two, as showed by the fact that Imola will go and Monza won't. If you have to elect one track as your home one, you better choose the one that's guaranteed to stay.\n\n\nAs an Italian and a Lombard, Monza obviously feels much more important to me than Imola, I like Imola but it's not more important than Pescara or Brescia or the Madonie circuits racing wise.\xa0\n\n\nAlso Monza has a better track with good races so it's more marketable I guess."", 'I’m not entirely sure, but I think it might have to do with Imola being run as the San Marino Grand Prix for many years. Monza has always been the ItalianGP and has been on the F1-calendar since the start in 1950. Whereas Imola was added to the calendar in 1980 and only hosted the ItalianGP in its first year. Perhaps it is therefore they consider it their home race more than Imola.', ""Because Monza is a constant, the home of *The* Italian Grand Prix, it's the big one, with history, prestige, Imola just has brief flings with the series every now and then. \n\nThe same reason RB consider Monza their home GP too, despite being closer to Imola."", '“Home races” don’t really have a hard fast rule… it could be a home race if it’s in the country where the driver was born or lives, the teams current base of operations, or a sponsor is based. Miami and Vegas are 3000 miles apart, but are both still considered home races for Haas lol', 'Monza is the italian GP, while Imola was either the San Marino GP or lately the Emilia Romagna GP\n\nAlso imola had a long stretch when it wasnt on the calendar, while Monza has been consistent. Monza is also a historical venue and has always been one of the cornerstones of f1, being the temple of speed. At least for now, who knows when FiA/FOM will ditch it for some street track in Rome\n\nImola is the home race of Scuderia Faenza tho, the current Visa whatever RB. Their factory is close to the circuit and it’s usually where they have their shakedowns or filming days', ""My guess is that it's because it's the Italian grand prix and it has been ever present on the calendar so it's kind of a tradition.

We saw cases like Mazepin (Abu Dhabi GP) and Raikkonen missing races that year due to positive tests.

On the other hand - I think poor Borteleto would need practically the entire field DSQ or DNF to get the win due to the car and him being a rookie. I’m not sure who I think he could realistically beat. 

I think Leclerc could pull a win as long as one McLaren was out of the running, and Ferrari didn’t do Ferrari things but it would still be tricky.
