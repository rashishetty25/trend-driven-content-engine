This is according to the documents seen by EL PAÍS, which also state that the promoter will try to reach agreements on economic compensation with the businesses affected by the race, which will take place near the Ifema exhibition centre between 2026 and 2035 and is expected to force the temporary closure of a petrol station, for example.\n\nAyuso\'s government estimates the bill it will have to pay to the state for its share of the public transport subsidy at seven million euros.\n\nBoth regional and municipal technicians agree that the F1 race will mean that the noise levels permitted by the capital\'s regulations will be exceeded during the days of the training sessions and the race, affecting the residents closest to the circuit.\n\nThese would be the houses to the north of the M-11 in the Valdelasfuentes neighbourhood, particularly those adjacent to the Ifema extension on Francisco Umbral and Florentino Rodríguez Alonso streets (the distance to the circuit of the most exposed houses in this area is around 40 metres); and those in the area of Calle de las Pedroñeras, in the eastern part of the Canillas neighbourhood, and in the northern part of the La Piovera neighbourhood (the distance to the circuit of the most exposed houses in this area varies between approximately 320 and 500 metres).\n\nThese homes would be affected by levels above 80 dB during training and races. The solution, as already proposed by the promoter, is therefore to install noise barriers, modify the layout and, above all, obtain the exemption provided for by the law to comply with the regulations.\n\n\\[...\\]', 'they should add more roundabouts', 'Can I dream of a scenario where Madrid never happens and Spa’s new deal is upgraded to a permanent one?\n\nOk, I’m dreaming…', 'They should stick to Formula E.

Similar ‘struggles’ you can be sure will be taking place at Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull to greater or lesser degrees. \n>\n>...\n>\n> So Watanabe’s comments will for certain have generated headlines suggesting that Honda is deep in trouble with the programme, maybe even manifesting the ghost of the company’s initially disastrous hybrid motor of 2015 and perhaps how this is potentially awful news for Aston Martin’s future prospects with its ’26 Adrian Newey wonder car potentially stymied by a feeble motor.\n> \n> Forget it all.
