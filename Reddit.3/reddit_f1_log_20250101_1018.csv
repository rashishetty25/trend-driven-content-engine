Let‚Äôs me know your Top 3.

My predictions:

1. WDC Champion: Charles Leclerc
2. WDC Vice-Champion: Lewis Hamilton
3. Third Place: Lando Norris

I do believe that if Ferrari provides a Championship level car (or even close), Charles & Lewis are both the favorites (I believe they will provide a very good car hence my top 2 but they are interchangeable). 

I think McLaren will have a very very good car but Lando isn‚Äôt ready yet to challenge and same goes for Oscar, he is to inconsistent.

Regarding Redbull and verstappen, unfortunately I don‚Äôt see them delivering a good car for max to be able to challenge for the title next year.

Finally, concerning Mercedes It‚Äôs been 3 years and they still don‚Äôt seem to understand the current regulations and haven‚Äôt show the capacity to build a championship level car. So Goerge won‚Äôt be anywhere near the top, tho he might win 1 or 2 gps.","['1. Max Verstappen\n2. Lando Norris\n3. Charles Leclerc\n4. Oscar Piastri\n5. Lewis Hamilton', ""1. Charles Leclerc\n\n2.
