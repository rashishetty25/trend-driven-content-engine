1omcv1n,I made a website to compare quali and race H2H between any teammates,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1omcv1n/i_made_a_website_to_compare_quali_and_race_h2h/,2025-11-02, Statistics,"I made a simple web app to compare a driver’s results with his teammate which I wanted to share with the community. It started as a way to view qualifying H2H and getting stats such as mean/median (hence it being called f1teammatequali), but recently I added the option of comparing race data too.



You can see how well a driver did against their teammate: 

* over a season
* over all qualifying sessions/races they took part in as teammates
* against all his teammates over the years at a particular circuit



For qualifying, I compared times from sessions both drivers participated in. I.e. if driver A made it to Q3 and driver B got out in Q1, then their Q1 times were used.



There is also a fourth feature where you can see how far off a driver's best time is from the fastest driver for every quali session in a season, or how far away from P1 a driver finished in the race. I thought it would be interesting to see how the gap to the fastest changes over a year (like how Verstappen closed in on Mercedes in 2020).



For sessions marred by outliers or anomalies, you can deselect that entry, and the H2H, stats, and charts will update instantly.



I hope you like it! If you have ideas for any new features you think would be interesting to see, then lmk.



[https://www.f1teammatequali.com/](https://www.f1teammatequali.com/) 



Note:

The web app is reliant on data fetched from the Jolpica (formerly Ergast) API. Only data from the 1994 season onwards is available for qualifying. There is also a lot of qualifying data from the late 90s and early 2000s missing. There are no such problems with race results data. 



If a driver doesn't set a time in a qualifying session, the API often nulls the entry for that session. This means results like Norris v Piastri in Saudi 2025 was recorded as a Norris win because the program compared their Q2 times instead of Q3 (in which Norris crashed) where he was faster than Piastri. The result should’ve gone to Piastri as he kept his car in one piece and qualified ahead, but as far as the data is concerned, Norris didn't take part in Q3 as his Q3 entry was empty, which is why the script defaulted to comparing Q2 times. If you find other results that you know are incorrect, keep this reason in mind as for why. ","['OP how much does it cost you each month to run this website?\n\nGood work btw love it.', ""Hey, that's really awesome! I have one suggestion, instead of comparing between the drivers of the same team, why not just provide the option to select drivers from any team.\n\nBecause in the current design, if we are selecting a team, there's no need to select drivers, it could be shown directly.\n\nHope it helps!"", 'Very cool but it gets fucky after you play around with it for a little bit and you have to reload the site.', 'This is an excellent resource that I have been using for the last while.\xa0\n\nHowever, only yesterday I was discussing Ricciardo vs Norris in 2021 with somebody and it seems some of your figures are incorrect?\n\nAnd taking another look through it now, there does seem to be the odd inconsistency. ~~For example Miami 2023 is given in Verstappen’s favour rather than Perez when that is straight up incorrect~~\xa0\n\n[edit] thanks for clearing that one up.
