Norris- towards season's end, he seemed to learn from his mistakes and drove quite a few great races

1hcveez,Is one of the reason RB wants to drop Checo team morale ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hcveez/is_one_of_the_reason_rb_wants_to_drop_checo_team/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"People talk. The entire team and paddock knows why Checo is there : money.

Would you like to end of third in the WCC because one of the drivers is bringing in enough money that the higher ups are still happy ? You've worked your whole life to end up here, but money talks more than performance. So you're not happy.

This must be bring down the morale of the whole team, and that means people leaving for greener pastures. The majority of people working at Red Bull want to _win_, not to make more money for the stakeholders and Checo's presence is working against that goal.

This might be a significant enough reason to drop him despite the money, especially since Red Bull has been losing engineers left and right since the new regs. It just took some time to percolate up the ranks with enough pressure.","[""F1 is a performance sport. Checo is simply not performing.

1hctthl,Max 2025 Race Ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hctthl/max_2025_race_ban/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"So Verstappen is 4 points off a race ban—he currently has 8 of the 12. His first points don’t expire until June, meaning he’ll have to navigate at least 11 races without picking up 4 more points—just two incidents and he’s out. 

Considering next season could be one of the most competitive in years is this something he and Red Bull are seriously concerned about?

How likely do you think it is that Max gets a race ban? ","['If Lawson gets checos seat and then Max gets a race ban: surely they will let Yuki have 1 race in the RB right? Surely.', 'FIA is extremely disinclined to issue race bans when it comes to this. Magnussen is more of an exception to the rule than a prime example, and it was probably either because he was retiring anyway, or because he was too open about the fact that he had nothing to lose and so didn’t care about breaking the rules. In other cases, once a driver gets close to 12 points, the stewards become deaf and blind. They give any punishment whatsoever other than penalty points.', 'Unlikely. Maybe he gets on the edge but FIA tends to give a warning before a driver breaches the limit( exactly what happened with Magnussen this year)', ""Besides the two 1 point incidents I think he could've entirely avoided all of the other 3 incidents in the moment. This is important to point out because he likely doesn't do whatever he did if he knows that a race ban is nearby. Also, while the Austria thing was possibly not something he avoids (light contact with big consequences and with drivers staying on track) there is also the possibility (high imo) that something like that does not result in penalty points if the driver in question is near a race ban. In fact, the Russell-quali incident also won't result in penalty points if he is closer to 12 points. I don't remember the other 1 point incident tbh..."", 'Not likely at all.', 'When is the baby due?', 'honestly depends on how the stewards are feeling on a given day at this point. I do think that if before june he gets very close to it, he should just ‘plan’ the race ban and get rid of it early in the year so that he can continue the rest of the year with zero points and time to make up the -25 points because assuming he is in the wdc fight,  if he stays on the limit with 9-10 points near the end of the year, he will  always be at risk of having the wdc decided based on that ban', ""it is worth noting, people in the comment are being far too dismissive. stewards have been harsher as of late and Max has inherently been antagonising anyone who cared to listen.\n\nIf he is found at fault of two instances that could be worthy of penalty points then it's a very real possibility. \n\nGenerally tho Max despite his hot headed radio message is too smart to be caught out by it, i feel like an incidents he'll be involved with would appear very marginal and not enough to warrant penalty points."", 'They are really out there to get Max, the amount of stuff others got away with but Max gets penalized all the time']",0,62,0.35,0,275,275,0,0,0.02999999999999997,0
