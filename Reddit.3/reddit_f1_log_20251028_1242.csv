There's a maximum of 43 points available each weekend (25 for the fastest stop, 18 for the second fastest stop), which means that McLaren can only earn 4x43=172 points at most, which isn't enough to close the 204-point gap, even if Ferrari failed to score a single point at the next four races.

In the last two years, when all 10 teams complied with the regulations, the FIA announced the results in September.\n\nBut in a statement issued on Tuesday, the FIA confirmed that nine teams were found to be in full compliance with the financial regulations, with the only exception being Aston Martin’s minor procedural breach.\n\nThe FIA’s Cost Cap Administration (CCA), which completes the review of all team 10s, stated the Aston Martin had “not exceeded the cost cap level, and that the Procedural Breach was of a very minor nature, originated by unpredictable circumstances outside the control of the F1 team.”\n\n[As reported by\xa0*The Athletic*\xa0last week](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6746459/2025/10/24/aston-martin-f1-cost-cap-minor-breach/), Aston Martin still had to enter an Accepted Breach Agreement (ABA) with the FIA to recognize its late submission which resulted from extenuating circumstances beyond the team’s control.\n\nAs the team did not look to gain any advantage through the procedural breach, the CCA agreed these were mitigating factors and decided to award no sanction. Aston Martin will have to cover the administrative costs to prepare the ABA.\n\nBesides the 10 teams, all five F1 power unit manufacturers were found to have complied with their own regulations.\n\nIn its statement, the FIA said reviewing the teams’ submissions was a “particularly time consuming considering both the complexities of the Financial Regulations and the necessity to assess technical aspects (and related cost treatment) of activities of development undertaken by F1 teams and power unit manufacturers.”\n\nLast week in Mexico, when asked about the length of the delay and the possibility of a breach by a rival team, Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur said it was “not a big deal” to have the results announced this late.\n\n“We have to trust the FIA that they are doing their job,” Vasseur said. “I think it’s not an easy one, honestly. But we also have to avoid making any speculation or rumors. That would be a mistake.”\n\nSauber team principal Jonathan Wheatley was with Red Bull as its sporting director when it was found to have breached the cost cap, and said it was a “very, very difficult thing to balance” for teams.\n\n“You want to be competitive,” Wheatley said. “You want to spend every last dollar up against your cost cap limit, of course you do.

In Azerbaijan yes he made plenty of mistakes and while they are reflective on his performance they aren’t reflective on how fast he’s been that being said it’s still his worst race of the season. Singapore he qualified ahead of Lando and though I do think Lando’s move was a bit stupid seeing how close he got to Oscar it’s a racing incident and there’s nothing McLaren should have done about it. Despite that Oscar still finished in p4 only dropping one place not amazing but not horrible. 

Austin I’ll admit was another poor race especially with his collision with Lando and Hulkenberg in the sprint (though I personally feel sprints are a place where you make higher risks since there’s less you lose out on.

He could have overtaken Ollie in the end but with the circumstances of the race it definitely made it harder. These last two races especially I think are what we need to look at and in comparison to how he did at them last year he hasn’t improved much but also hasn’t gotten any worse. In Austin he finished in the same place (which isn’t as impressive considering how much faster he should be and how much faster his car should be) in Mexico he finished ahead of where he did last year. These two tracks last year weren’t his best for him so it’s not entirely surprising to see him do worse

I also haven’t touched on the slow stops McLaren has been giving out to both drivers or any other controversies which I have no real opinion on. With that being said I do think his performance has obviously declined but mostly in the past two races the four before that his pace didn’t take as bad of a hit with Azerbaijan being the only race I’d call. Personally I wanted to make this post because while I do think Oscar has taken a hit people have been coming at him especially for certain comments where he’s said he doesn’t know if it’s the car or him and people obviously comparing his performance to Lando’s. If there’s anything I missed please remind me 

","['He could just be racing on tracks that don’t suit him.\n\nBrazil is the key race, as apart from qualifying last year he was good that weekend.\n\nIf Lando is still faster in Brazil, I think it’s likely Lando has just stepped up his game the past few weeks', 'oscar has had a poor 4 weeks, however these tracks just dont suit his style, i thought the signs were very good in the mexico race that combative oscar was returning, hopefully we will see old oscar back from now as the rest of the tracks are more suited to his style', ""I think this is a more accurate representation of his level than the rest of the year. He was a long, long way behind Norris last year and you can't close that gap in the blink of an eye like he seemed to. He's no match for a Norris at his best. Given that the biggest gap he's managed to build is 34 points (with 18 of those coming from Zandvoort) he's only a tiny bit better than an underperforming Norris."", ""Doesn't matter. He either gets back his form or he doesn't. But Norris has currently reached his new high. If Piastri doesn't go through similar development, especially on his bad tracks, he's very likely not going to reach Norris until the end of the year."", 'I wouldn’t say Singapore was bad performance. McLaren wasn’t strong enough and he had some bad luck at the start. Still had decent pace.', 'or you could say norris is 1 point better than an underperforming oscar, comments like this are dumb, he was behind norris last year you say? he wasnt that far ahead and that was oscars second season in f1 and landos 7th. You say the last 4 races on oscars worst tracks are more representative of his level this year even though he has performed at a much higher level for 16 races this year? i think everyone here is dumber for reading your opinion', "">He's no match for a Norris at his best.\n\nI think this is just false. If this year has shown us anything, it's that when they are both at their best there is almost nothing separating them.\n\nThe real difference is that Norris has recovered and salvaged more from his bad races. Even when he looked lost at the start of the year, he was regularly driving it onto the podium."", 'I felt McLaren stunted Piastri’s learning by making a car that doesn’t need to be driven on the limit or need much tyre management. It’s not helped him because now he’s reached the races where those skills are required, he’s got nothing to draw upon since the car was doing half the job for him. So the gaps that were present last year are back again with the added context of him being a championship contender. It looks bad because it is bad and I really think McLaren fucked him over when they thought they were helping him.', ""Christ what's wrong with you"", 'insanely stupid comments annoy me']",0,11,0.35,0,10,10,0,11,0.35,0
1ohw2ct,Turn 1 lap 6 incident.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohw2ct/turn_1_lap_6_incident/,2025-10-28, Discussion,"I’m hopeful that since a full day has passed from the race, that we can have a more reasonable discussion about this incident.

On the “Driving Standards Guideline section A. ii)” it states the following:

“Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex, and not have “dived in”

Here is the link for that: https://static.fanpage.it/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/06/f1_driving_standards_guidelines_version_4.1_feb_20_2025.pdf

On Max’s onboard, we can see that Max hits the inside red sausage kerb located on the apex of the corner with his front right tire. This kerb is further inside the track of the normal red and white curb and it’s also much more pronounced. 

As a result of that impact Max loses control of the car and has to take corrective steering action. As he is sawing at the wheel, his front left makes contact with Lewis’s front right. 

How is this not in violation of the quoted section of the guidelines? 

If it is not a violation of the guideline, then it implies that as long as the car on the inside is first to apex, they cannot be deemed at fault for any incident. Further implying that any car attempting to defend their position on the outside of a corner, should concede immediately. The steward’s incident report pretty much confirmed this as they investigated Lewis for this contact and not Max. 

While I understand that the drivers voted for this, I simply don’t agree with it and it think it makes the racing product dull. 

I would much rather have something similar to what Indy car does. 

1) The defending car must be proactive and choose its line of defense. 

2) The attacking car is then responsible for carrying out a clean overtake. 

Sections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 of the Indycar rulebook can be found here: https://epaddock.indycar.com/docs/default-source/rules-regulations-and-policies/indycar-rulebook.pdf

Their rules are significantly more clear and I feel that they allow for far more exciting racing than what we currently have in F1. They are also more in line with what is the norm in other series and what is taught in most racing schools and lower level of competition.

I think it’s also time for F1 to have paid, professional and permanent stewards. Not only for consistency but more importantly, precedent. The best drivers on the grid, like Max, tend to push the line of what is acceptable in the rules and those rulings define how all drivers behave after. This leads to a degradation of driving standards over time and we continue to find ourselves in situations where we are changing the rules over and over. I feel like this is not too much to ask of a sport with a valuation in the 10+ billion dollar range. 
","['Verstappen could have been at fault if the speed he took would have meant that he was not staying on track which would have made his passing attempt invalid. The reality is that Verstappen was ahead by the apex and stopped on track but Hamilton turned into the apex when he no longer had the right of way which meant that they had a slight collision.\n\nAccording to the rules Hamilton should have taken a wider racing line and given the corner to Verstappen. It is pretty clear and the drivers have agreed to the rules.', '> I simply don’t agree with it and it think it makes the racing product dull.\n\nSo you find races with only DRS passes more exciting?', ""OP, I only know that you are not allowed to overtake outside the track.  \napart from that....racing guidlines are terrible, and its application even worse.  \ncurrently you don't need to leave a space at all if you are ahead of apex and that is very dangerous and stupid. you can push out other car out of the track without consequences if you are ahead of apex."", 'Don’t worry guys, OP doesn’t like how the rules work and is getting to the bottom of this.', ""The main issue was that Hamilton was caught off guard with the attempt, which didn't allow him to change his approach to the corner. He could have gone defensive and fully blocked the inside line at the cost of some lap time. He could have anticipated the dive with a wide line and more speed into the corner, taking the advantage in the next corner. As he didn't see the overtake coming, he took the normal racing line, but was already overtaken on the inside of turn 1. That caused him to be at a disadvantage in the next corner as it was on him to provide space for the leading driver.\n\nUltimately, both drivers lost out in the whole sequence. Hamilton would have lost much less if he let Verstappen pass after cutting t4 and t5."", ""IndyCar doesn't always have clean overtakes though if you've seen an IndyCar race that is not on an oval. There's a lot of argy bargy. As for the contact, that's just racing, Lewis did this far more egregiously in his younger years. No one complained. This is also far more prevalent in lower series like Karting. As the stewards stated if they were being consistent with other results in the past, this shouldn't deserve a pen.\n\n>it implies that as long as the car on the inside is first to apex, they cannot be deemed at fault for any incident\n\nYou'll come to learn that stewarding isn't fully based off the actions itself but the outcome. Remember Lawson and Sainz in Netherlands, the only reason he got a pen and Lewis didn't was because the collision ended with a puncture for both cars. The reason Checo didn't get a pen in Abu Dabi 21 and Lewis didn't in Abu Dabi 2016 for driving unreasonably slowly, Lewis didn't crash into him and Nico didn't crash into Lewis Mitigating circumstances. I wouldn't give a car a 10 second penalty just for a slight correction which lead to contact. Maybe if the slide was bigger, like Russell in Spain then I would give them a 10 second penalty.\n\nAlso in the same document you linked to, it shows the stewards literally take into consideration kerbs and the type of corner. This is the second page.\n\n>vii) Did the type of corner contribute to the incident? (e.g. camber, kerbs, curve, apexes)"", ""Because you're wrong. Max did it to push Lewis wider because it would have left Lewis on the track if he maintained that line which would have left him in a much better position to attack Max on the next corner  \n\nOne day Ferrari will invent mirrors and he will see Max coming.""]",0,10,0.28,0,7,7,0,0,-0.02999999999999997,0
