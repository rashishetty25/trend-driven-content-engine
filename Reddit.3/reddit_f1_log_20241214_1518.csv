1hdkfcc,How F1 employee bonuses work in the budget cap era,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdkfcc/how_f1_employee_bonuses_work_in_the_budget_cap_era/,2024-12-13, Discussion,"McLaren can give 12mil to employees in bonuses and have it not count against the budget cap.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.

Edit: To do the math, assuming teams pay their full bonus, McLaren employees got a 20% increase in bonus compared to last year, and Red Bull employees got a 16.67% decrease. Now, teams might not choose to pay this much in bonuses. Individual teams might have goals they have to meet to get their bonuses by their individual employee contracts. Just like teams don't have to spend the whole budget cap in the first place. For instance, it might be in Red Bull's employee's contracts that they have to place top 3 in the WCC or no bonus at all. But they might have something much more lenient. Just like driver contracts, we don't know what are in employee contracts.

Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors‚Äô Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors‚Äô Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""

I did not understand how any of this worked until looking up the regulations, and I don't think many people understand how it works either. I did this digging to comment on another post that the poster deleted, but I thought it was interesting and other people might not know, so I wanted to post it anyway.

He is only talked when, ‚ÄúYuki deserves the RB seat‚Äù instead of him. But I want to talk a bit about ‚Äúhis‚Äù carreer. He drove only 5 races in 2023 and 6 in 2024. He did not even completed a whole season worth of races, two seasons combined. He lacks of experience especially compared to Yuki‚Äôs ‚Äú4 full seasons‚Äù of experience. I believe he is a decent driver and can be a regular top 10 if he gains experience. For now, of couse if there‚Äôs somebody to be promoted, it is Yuki. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that Liam is a bad driver. He didn‚Äôt even have a full season worth of drive (11 races in total, correct me if i‚Äôm wrong), so it is not reasonable to compare the two and saying Lawson is bad.  He should gain experience to avoid RBR‚Äôs Gasly & Albon situation.  Also, even though how much I want Yuki to promote to the dark blue car, I don‚Äôt think Red Bull would gave one of the seats to a Honda driver considering Ford engines will come in 2026.

If he does all that, by the late season he could be right behind Max, which would already be enough for Red Bull.\n\nAnd yes, the exact same applies to Tsunoda."", 'I think Tsunoda should get the RBR seat for 2025 for two reasons.  One, I think he is more ready than Liam at this point and secondly, I think he will do better than Sergio.

New fan here, started watching F1 last year.

I‚Äôve been doing some ‚Äúresearch‚Äù for a while now. I‚Äôm currently watching every race from the 2012 season.

I simply hate how they used to display the gaps between drivers. You need to check the time really fast as it will soon disappear and show the gaps for the next group of cars.

I find it hard to follow on how the race is at that exact moment, comparing to nowadays where the times are always visible.

There are other things I don‚Äôt like, such as the radio messages, which have bad audio quality and that‚Äôs understandable, but providing subtitles doesn‚Äôt require that much technology.

The way they show the starting grid is also horrendous.
