Those are all traits people used to, and still do, praise Carlos for.\n\nCarlos, on the other hand, I think has learned from Charles how to extract more from the car. Carlos has always been a rapid driver but if I'm not wrong, in terms of pace, this year Carlos has been closer to Charles than ever. This year he did his best quali performance against Charles, and I don't think there were a lot of times where Charles left him in the dust (with 20s+ gaps) in the race, like there were in 2021-2023.

1hdkfcc,How F1 employee bonuses work in the budget cap era,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdkfcc/how_f1_employee_bonuses_work_in_the_budget_cap_era/,2024-12-13, Discussion,"McLaren can give 12mil to employees in bonuses and have it not count against the budget cap.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.

Edit: To do the math, assuming teams pay their full bonus, McLaren employees got a 20% increase in bonus compared to last year, and Red Bull employees got a 16.67% decrease. Now, teams might not choose to pay this much in bonuses. Individual teams might have goals they have to meet to get their bonuses by their individual employee contracts. Just like teams don't have to spend the whole budget cap in the first place. For instance, it might be in Red Bull's employee's contracts that they have to place top 3 in the WCC or no bonus at all. But they might have something much more lenient. Just like driver contracts, we don't know what are in employee contracts.

Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""

I did this digging to comment on another post that the poster deleted, but I thought it was interesting and other people might not know, so I wanted to post it anyway.

He is only talked when, “Yuki deserves the RB seat” instead of him. But I want to talk a bit about “his” carreer. He drove only 5 races in 2023 and 6 in 2024. He did not even completed a whole season worth of races, two seasons combined. He lacks of experience especially compared to Yuki’s “4 full seasons” of experience. I believe he is a decent driver and can be a regular top 10 if he gains experience. For now, of couse if there’s somebody to be promoted, it is Yuki. But it doesn’t mean that Liam is a bad driver. He didn’t even have a full season worth of drive (11 races in total, correct me if i’m wrong), so it is not reasonable to compare the two and saying Lawson is bad.  He should gain experience to avoid RBR’s Gasly & Albon situation.  Also, even though how much I want Yuki to promote to the dark blue car, I don’t think Red Bull would gave one of the seats to a Honda driver considering Ford engines will come in 2026. But maybe they do, who knows right?? Anyway.. Any comments about Lawson? ","[""He has potential, but he needs to be given a proper season with winter testing included.

We've seen experienced drivers like Ricciardo and Perez, and rookies like Gasly and Albon, either meltdown or not live up to the absurd expectations of that seat.

If he does all that, by the late season he could be right behind Max, which would already be enough for Red Bull.\n\nAnd yes, the exact same applies to Tsunoda."", 'I think Tsunoda should get the RBR seat for 2025 for two reasons.  One, I think he is more ready than Liam at this point and secondly, I think he will do better than Sergio.

New fan here, started watching F1 last year.

I’ve been doing some “research” for a while now. I’m currently watching every race from the 2012 season.

I simply hate how they used to display the gaps between drivers. You need to check the time really fast as it will soon disappear and show the gaps for the next group of cars.

I find it hard to follow on how the race is at that exact moment, comparing to nowadays where the times are always visible.

There are other things I don’t like, such as the radio messages, which have bad audio quality and that’s understandable, but providing subtitles doesn’t require that much technology.

The way they show the starting grid is also horrendous.

AND YES! I KNOW THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO AND IT MAKES SENSE TO BE WORSE!
