1n1ejru,[AMuS] FIA has defined track dependent rules for energy management in 2026. According to the latest version teams will not be allowed to use full electrical power at Monaco and Singapore. Energy recovery will also be restricted on certain tracks.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n1ejru/amus_fia_has_defined_track_dependent_rules_for/,2025-08-27, News,,"['Completely sensible if the reports about the cars being able to reach 400 km/h are true but these regs feel like they’re going to be a disaster', '>Formula 1 cars threaten to be too fast on some circuits in 2026. That\'s why the FIA is imposing strict energy management requirements on the teams. We have been given an insight into the secret data sheets.\n\n>A new era begins for Formula 1 in 2026. Once again. And yet the next technical regulations have a different quality than all previous technical reforms. Not only because the drive, chassis and tires are changing. The high proportion of electric power in the drive system presents the rule-makers with major challenges. There is a difference between feeding 350 kilowatts (475 hp) or 120 kilowatts (163 hp) from the battery into the system.\n\n>Added to this is 400 kilowatts (545 hp) from the combustion engine. Minimum. Engine circles are already talking about up to 430 kilowatts (585 hp). This means that the hybrid drives of the future would have well over 1,000 hp at full power. But not always. To charge the battery reliably, it is not enough just to recuperate on the brakes. The combustion engine will also have to help recover energy when cornering under partial load.\n\n>Keyword energy management: in the future, this will be as important as the peak engine performance itself. FIA Head of Sport Nikolas Tombazis confirms: ""If the electric share of power increases relative to the combustion engine and the batteries only have limited charging and discharging capacities, energy management will become an important challenge. This will bring about some innovations on the electric side of the drive.""\n\n>No risk in the Monte-Carlo tunnel\n\n>The teams will not be completely free when it comes to energy management. If they were, in extreme cases this could lead to excesses that pose a safety risk. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff warned of top speeds of up to 400 km/h. If full electric power were allowed in Monte-Carlo, the cars would be able to reach speeds of 350 km/h at the end of the tunnel - until now, it has ""only"" been around 290 km/h.\n\n>If there were no restriction on charging, the cars would lose too much speed too quickly in the middle of the straights. If suddenly 120 kilowatts are missing, it\'s not so bad. With three times the power, it becomes a problem. That\'s why the power has to be gradually reduced when sailing down the straights. ""We will make sure that the cars don\'t suddenly decelerate on the straights or do any other unnatural things,"" confirms Tombazis.\n\n>The complexity of the future hybrid drive requires that limits are set individually, depending on the race track. There is already an energy management chart for this, but it is only a snapshot. It is constantly being adapted in consultation with the teams and engine manufacturers. We were allowed to take a look at the secret paper.\n\n>Rules are constantly being adapted\n\n>According to Tombazis, the FIA is in constant contact with the teams to find out what the drivers report from the tests in the simulator and where there are still weak points. ""We have not yet finalized the rules. They will be adapted step by step, depending on the experiences the teams make and report to us. The more intensively they get involved in development now, the more often the drivers try out the 2026 cars in the simulator, the more feedback we get from them.""\n\n>The product is not yet finished, but each of the eleven teams already has the current status of how the energy may be used on the individual circuits. First of all, the proportion of each track where full throttle is theoretically used is determined. In Melbourne this is 4,630 out of 5,278, in Monte-Carlo 1,388 out of 3,337 and in Monza 4,218 out of 5,793 meters.\n\n>With two exceptions, full power can be called up on each of the 24 GP circuits. Only on the street circuits in Monte-Carlo and Singapore does a reduced power mode known as “Rev1” apply.\n\n>This is how much can be charged per round\n\n>There are also restrictions on charging. According to the regulations, the maximum amount of energy that can be charged into the battery via the MGU-K per lap is 9.0 megajoules. But not everywhere and not always. The directive not only makes a difference for racetracks, but also whether it is a free practice session, a qualifying session or the race. Sprint and Grand Prix are treated equally.\n\n>On twelve of the 24 circuits, a maximum of 9.0 megajoules per lap may be recuperated in free practice, qualifying and override mode. For each normal lap in the race, 8.5 MJ/lap applies. This category includes circuits such as Suzuka, Miami, Monte-Carlo, Spa, Madrid and Austin.\n\n>In Barcelona, Silverstone or Zandvoort, the maximum amount of storage is also limited to 8.5 MJ/lap in qualifying. There are precautionary measures on the extremely fast circuits. In Jeddah, no more than 8.5 MJ/lap may be charged in free practice, no more than 6.5 MJ/lap in qualifying and no more than 8.0 MJ/lap in the race. In Monza, only 6.0 MJ/lap is permitted in qualifying.\n\n>DRS effect via extra boost\n\n>In order to prevent a car suddenly becoming an obstacle when sailing on the straights, the power of the combustion engine may only be reduced gradually. Normally, 100 kilowatts per second apply. On the super-fast tracks such as Melbourne, Jeddah, Silverstone, Spa, Monza, Baku and Las Vegas, it is only 50 kW/s.\n\n>DRS will be history next year because the cars will automatically flatten the flaps on the front and rear wings on the straights to reduce drag. From 2026, the overtaking aid will be an extra boost from the drive. As with DRS, it may only be used if the gap between two cars at the detection point is one second or less.\n\n>The points at which the distance is measured and from which the power button may be pressed are largely already defined and specified in meters. These distances refer to the distance to the finish line. As only one point has been noted so far, it looks as if there is only one point per track where the override mode may be activated.\n\n>Boost area does not equal DRS zones\nIn Spa, this is conveniently the finish line. In Bahrain it is the fourth straight between turns 13 and 14, in Shanghai, Barcelona, Montreal or at the Red Bull Ring the home straight, in Interlagos at the end of turn 13 and in Melbourne at the end of the back straight.\n\n>Tombazis does not yet want to say how powerful the overtaking aid will be. ""This is currently being coordinated with the drivers in the simulator. There are similarities with DRS, but also differences. We don\'t want to make overtaking too easy or too difficult. The parameters will not be the same for every track.""\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com. If there are errors please let me know so I can correct them!', 'The varying MJ available per track and session is reminiscent of the LMP1 days in WEC where the various hybrid energy allocation was written for Le Mans and then proportionally adapted for other tracks based on the lenght.\n\nThe fact that it also varies by track session however will make it incredibly obscure to explain for the more casual viewers.', 'I really dont like the sound of this.', ""It is very weird to me that regulations aren't even finalized to this point.
