Max Verstappen managed to limit the damage somewhat with a sixth place, but the reality was that Red Bull proved powerless with the RB21 at the Sakhir circuit. A weekend later, the world looked a lot better. Verstappen managed to claim pole position in Jeddah and, according to Christian Horner and Helmut Marko, would normally have won the race as well, were it not for a five-second time penalty that threw a spanner in the works.\n\n**Updates in three stages: ‚Äú**We are taking small steps‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe were surprised, but positively surprised,‚Äù Marko revealed afterwards in the paddock in Jeddah about the race pace. ‚ÄúCompared to Bahrain we made a lot of progress, although this circuit also suits us better. Here you have many more fast corners and different asphalt, which helped us,‚Äù Marko acknowledged. Nevertheless, he also sees signs that the 81-year-old Austrian believes indicate more structural improvement. ‚ÄúWe are making strides and trying to make the car more predictable. Furthermore, we are working on making the car a bigger window.‚Äù With those last words, Marko is referring to the car's set-up window. Horner has already explained that Red Bull was unable to find that in Bahrain, which made the picture look particularly bad, and that the optimal window was found for that circuit prior to qualifying in Jeddah.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Red Bull had some new parts on the car, with Marko explaining that these were three-step updates. In Miami - as in Jeddah - another small upgrade should follow, followed by more in Imola, according to the Austrian. ‚ÄúWe are making small steps. I think that around Imola we should be in a position where we have the speed to beat the McLarens,‚Äù Marko reveals quite optimistically after a question from Motorsport.com.\n\n**Can heat in Miami still make things difficult for Red Bull?**\n\nBefore that follows the race weekend in Florida, and that could be an interesting one. For example, Horner revealed that McLaren was in a class of its own in the heat. The gap in practice sessions was at times 1.2 seconds per lap, according to the Briton, which made him laugh: ‚ÄúOn Friday we still thought McLaren would lap everyone!‚Äù In the evening sessions it was still hot, but Red Bull performed better than expected. That said, the sessions in Miami are run during the day and it can be quite hot in The Sunshine State.\n\nDoes Marko fear the next Grand Prix somewhat because of that? ‚ÄúWell, fortunately the race is not around lunch time and normally the sun sets, of course. We have to see how it goes there and if we can find more performance, but I normally think we can be competitive there as well.‚Äù\n\nTranslated with DeepL"", 'In a way it especially interesting in context of Marko statement iirc before Japan(or was it Bahrain) calling next three races not favouring RedBull car.\n\nSo either it was preventive PR in case of Yuki struggling. Or things really becoming interesting by RedBull upgrades by far exceeding their own expectations.\n\nHonestly hope for latter, cause previous season was absolute fire and can only pray for this to be same.', 'This has to do with the nature of the track. Fast and fast corners, like Suzuka work good for the RB. Slow tracks and slow corners will set them back again.', ""Max has proven that he sure can beat Mclarens but RBR as a team won't with only 1 car consistently in the points while Mclaren puts both of their drivers into high points scoring positions unless something goes wrong."", 'We can be sure of one thing, if Max has the car to compete with McLaren this early in the season, it is over for Lando and Oscar.', 'It would be brilliant if Red Bull can match or come very close to the McLaren car.

Now that the dust has settled in Jeddah, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

I wish there was a bit more passing, but the high speed corners blocked a ton of passing as seen when Oscar and Max had to lap cars.\n\nOverall, I think if Max gave spot away in the beginning he may have faired better but it's hindsight. It's a risk, he took that couldve been beneficial with 1st lap lienancy or as we saw, could've been 10second penalty. He got a slight compromise."", ""Huge kudos to the Ferrari mechanics/pit crew for how much they've improved their pit stops this year.

Sort of the opposite of what I'm used to from Ferrari."", ""Searching for consistency in stewarding decisions is often something of a fool's errand, but I think they got it right this time with Oscar and Max.\n\n\nThe argument that Max got forced off track does have some merit, but the fact that he chose to keep the position takes away from the legitimacy of that argument.\n\n\nIf they had swapped places back, then the stewards would have more reason to discuss whether or not Max got forced off.\n\n\n\n\nAnd then 10s for Lawson, not sure why it wasn't 5, maybe because it wasn't lap 1?"", 'I am really surprised that no one on the Red Bull wall thought about giving the place back to Oscar on what was a clear advantage gained by going off track.\n\nI suppose they thought that a 5s penalty was an ok price to pay for running in clean air.\n\nI would be in favour of bringing back the drive through penalty if a driver gains a place unfairly and does not hand it back on his own within 3 racing laps of the incident. It will enough the drivers to police themselves and be fair to each other on the track if the penalty for not doing so has real teeth.', ""After seeing the video (on Twitter, can't post it here) and Mark Sutton's photos I am now fairly convinced MBS basically told Max not to talk publicly about the steward's decision on the penalty, or worse, threatened him with a fine if he talked negatively about it.\n\nIt is being framed that Max was mad about his penalty, and he probably was, but I think his reactions in the post-race interviews are more about what MBS said to him on the grid. Yes, it's supposition and we'll never truly know unless Max or MBS decide to reveal what they were talking about.\n\nIt sure doesn't look like a typical post-race friendly, congrats chat though.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/DIsvkz5sw57/?hl=en&img\\_index=1](https://www.instagram.com/p/DIsvkz5sw57/?hl=en&img_index=1)"", ""I really hope this season becomes an Oscar v Max to end year, I like them both so wouldn't care who wins either way.

This is mainly due to the importance of racing in the clean area ""We also saw with Lewis in China that starting in front is important. Free air makes the race different because free air can give you an advantage of 6 tenths"".', 'Even a flawless quali lap from Charles like in Jeddah is 2 tenths off the pace of Russell in the Merc.

In the second stint he wasn't close to the McLaren in pace outside Piastri just managing the gap.\n\nLikewise Lewis ran a few laps in the second stint as clearly the 3rd quickest car, almost on the pace of Piastri and Leclerc ahead of him.  But as soon as he closed on Antonelli his pace stabilised behind him, and then his tyres started to go off.\n\nThe combination of these current tyres and cars is causing excessive degradation of the tyre when following the car in front, albeit with higher degradation at some tracks masking this to a degree.  You *can* follow closely but you compromise your pace later in the stint by doing so.  Maybe it'll be better in the cooler temperatures of the European races.""]",11,6,0.92,11,5,5,11,6,0.92,11

Now that makes me wonder, how would Sainz handle the SF-25? The car's balance seems to be pretty similar to the early-form F1-75, a car that Sainz had difficulties extracting performance from.
