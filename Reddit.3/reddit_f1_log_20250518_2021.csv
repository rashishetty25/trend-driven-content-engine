1kp2ilw,[AMuS] The Aston Martin Miracle of Imola,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kp2ilw/amus_the_aston_martin_miracle_of_imola/,2025-05-17, News,,"['Cheers to our Green Heroes grabbing some points tomorrow 💚', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Aston Martin can celebrate again. Both drivers finished in the top ten, with Fernando Alonso even securing fifth place on the grid. The medium-tire trick was planned well in advance. Mercedes copied it and almost secured pole position.**\n\n> The 2026 season has been a tragedy for Aston Martin so far. Recently, Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll have been consistently stuck in Q1. Stroll has always scored his 14 World Championship points when his rivals have missed them. Alonso\'s points tally is still empty after six World Championship races.\n\n> The first major technical upgrade was intended to halt the downward trend in Imola. After a comparison test on Friday, it was determined that the new aerodynamic package was better. But it wasn\'t so good that it would turn a Q1 car into a Q3 car. Despite this, Alonso and Stroll made it to the final knockout round relatively relaxed, trumping grid positions 5 and 8, respectively. Alonso missed Oscar Piastri\'s best time by 0.761 seconds, however. In the last few races, the green cars were more than a second behind.\n\n> The result flatters Aston Martin somewhat. ""We\'re not as good as the result,"" admits Alonso. Had the Spaniard driven on soft tires like most of his teammates, he would have finished tenth on the grid. The extra boost came from the tire choice. Starting in Q2, Aston Martin opted for the medium tire on each of their second attempts.\n\n> **Medium more stable and less temperature sensitive.**\nThat was the plan from the start. Aston Martin wasn\'t confident about Pirelli\'s new superglue, the C6. ""We already noticed during the tests last year in Mexico and Abu Dhabi that things could get critical with the C6 at the end of the lap on certain tracks,"" reveals chief engineer Mike Krack. But they were a bit hesitant. ""The new soft tire lasted surprisingly long on Friday.""\n\n> Nevertheless, Aston Martin went ahead with its plan. And it was proven right. The C6 was already degrading in the second sector with the track temperature reaching 40 degrees Celsius. The C5 compound, on the other hand, remained stable throughout the entire lap. The medium tire overheats less quickly and also offers more lateral stability because the tread moves less.\n\n> Aston Martin may no longer have any fresh medium tires in its contingent, but the team almost always warms up its tires before races anyway. Alonso believes he\'s well prepared for the race. ""We\'re not as fast as we look. But even if we lose two more positions, it wouldn\'t be a big deal. We just need to manage to make it through the race with one stop. Then the others have to overtake us on the track, and that\'s difficult.""\n\n> **Mercedes almost on pole position.**\nOnly one team also ran a medium in Q3. Mercedes had it in mind, but wasn\'t sure whether to sacrifice a set of C6 tires. Only when Aston Martin showed such a big performance did Mercedes decide to do the same. For the very last attempt, George Russell switched from soft to medium.\n\n> Red Bull team principal Christian Horner admits: ""When we saw that, we were sure George would be on pole position."" And that almost happened. Russell was only 0.137 seconds behind Piastri\'s pole lap. The Englishman lost his time entirely in the first four corners. ""After that, George was exactly as fast as Piastri,"" Mercedes calculated. Russell may have lost pole position on the warm-up lap. He had to slow down in heavy traffic, which is never good for tire preparation.\n\n> **Red Bull has saved medium.**\nRed Bull also briefly considered the medium tire, but preferred the better strategic options in the race. ""If it had guaranteed us pole position, we would have done it,"" says Horner. On the soft tire, Max Verstappn delivered an otherworldly first sector. However, by the second section, the Dutchman was already feeling a loss of grip. The Red Bull understeered more and more as the lap progressed.\n\n> McLaren once again beat Red Bull and Mercedes with its wildcard. The papaya racers keep every tire stable within the window, regardless of the compound. Piastri gained two tenths on Verstappen in the second part of the track. Looking back, Horner is glad he still had fresh medium tires in stock. ""One qualifying lap would have drained too much life out of that set of tires. We would have paid the price in the first stint on Sunday.""', 'Running the medium tire was a great gutsy call', 'Now to actually hold onto it for tomorrow and not drop like a brick of have a stupid strategy.', '![gif](giphy|uycNWzHCdfdcG4MY0q)', 'Alonso wdc 2026 please', 'All week people in F1 were talking about the mediums might be better. By Q3 I’m shocked more people didn’t do it.\xa0', 'They finished 20 seconds behind a Sauber in Miami, P5 is a massive improvement considering they were arguably the worst car in the grid alongside Sauber.\n\nThe new wind tunnel + Newey definitely has done wonders, just look the smile on Cowell’s face after reaching Q3', 'the neweification']",169,33,0.95,169,441,441,0,0,0.0,0

Charles tried valiantly to get a conversation going, but the vibes were off in the room that day. \n\n6) Miami GP - The highlight reel here was weirdly short. This cooldown room could have been an email.\n\n5) Japanese GP - The ""expensive lawnmover with a special floor"" discussion between Lando and Max was memorable. Oscar\'s ""That\'s all that happened in the race?"" was so real. Possibly more eventful than the race itself. \n\n4) Imola GP - The vibes were good but there were no memorable lines.

We also get the McLaren drivers imitating Andrea Stella who apparently reminisces a lot about the Schumacher era in Ferrari. Extra amusing because George is way more chill here than in Australia.\n\n2) Bahrain GP - We start out strong with a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek, self-deprecating comment from Lando, immediately followed by a  half-naked George Russell. We have Oscar poking fun at Lando. Lots of jokes from Lando about himself. George becomes Lando\'s sympathetic hype man. Should probably be switched around with China but gets extra points for George being on brand and shirtless.\n\n1) Australian GP - Lando\'s mum\'s swearing being part of the highlights makes up for the slightly awkward vibes between Max and George (and their mutual friend Lando who is thankfully in the middle).

1kp3bws,What rules apply to the medical car?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kp3bws/what_rules_apply_to_the_medical_car/,2025-05-17, Discussion,"Howdy, mods let me know if this kind of post isn’t meant for here

I had some questions and was curious on other’s opinions of medical car procedures. 

Firstly, how is driver radio communicated? Everyone seems to know quite quickly a crashed driver is okay or not, I believe Lando was told within a couple seconds after passing tsunoda’s incident. Does the race engineer do something simple like, stick a thumb up once they hear, and someone from the teams look? I ask because this is relevant to my question about the medical car. 

If I were the physician responsible, I would want to know *exactly* the words spoken by the driver that just shunted. Do they feel hurt, what hurts, what is their general conscious condition?

Secondly, do we know of specific rules that constrain the actions of the medical car? Are they forced to follow the direction of travel in the pits or on track, or can they drive wherever to reach the patient ASAP. 

I ask because a thought came to me after Doohan’s shunt. 

Consider this nightmarish theoretical:

At Imola, driver has a freak crash at turn 17-18 and immediately triggers the G-force alarm. Safety and med cars deployed as the red flag flys, but the driver comes over the radio saying:

>help help help, I’m bleeding

Or

>something is wrong I need help now

Would the medical car *really* put a flying lap in around the circuit to get to the driver? That precious two minutes could be critical. Our would/could/should they take a significant risk in rushing down the straight in the opposite direction of traffic to get to the driver? 

Rules may be in place, policies may exist, but if I was the physician responsible, I would**proportionally** react, do what was required to get to the patient who is actively in peril asap. Obviously this risks a lot, especially causing an accident, but that is merely theoretical. Practically, someone is dying

What do you think? How do you think you would act?","['Ok so I’ve sat in race control in the past and worked with the medical team a bit.\n\n1) lots of ways. The second there’s a crash everyone in race control is watching the cctv and FOM tv coverage desperately hoping to see the driver move and get out, at the same time race control will radio the nearest marshal post and get them to get a visual on the driver and look for and report a thumbs up or driver condition etc.\n\nEveryone is also listening to the team radio, only the FIA desk on race control has that direct team and car radio so 90% of race control can’t hear that but we do listen to publicly available commentary and radio as well as people at home, but remember that’s delayed by several seconds. But we still listen to it.\n\nBasically any sign on cameras, radio  and marshals.\n\n\n2) lots of rules and some just conventions. Lap 1 it’s always following anyway and won’t ask but just stop at an incident.\n\nOutside that Race control will tell the medical car to move or not.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer sitting in race control can see the g shock impact alarm and the same tv etc, he’ll be on immediate standby and on the radio to the medical car to get them ready, but they have a tv in the car as well so will have seen a crash on tv usually.\nAt the same time the chief medical officer will be looking at the race director who’s in contact with everyone and also watching tv, it’s he who will say go or not and when to the medical car, although technically the CMO can decide themselves but generally everyone runs to the race director or clerk of the course as they’ll also enact flags etc.\n\nNo they won’t do a full lap, almost every circuit has shortcuts and cut through the car will use. \n\nALL cars travel in race direction at ALL times, the risk of head to head crash is unthinkable so it’s NEVER done. EVER. It’s like rule one on track.\n\nYou also have multiple extraction teams around the circuit and all the marshals.\n\nIn your worst case scenario they’d be activated immediately and at least one extraction team, usually also containing doctors and amazingly skilled at saving drivers lives with a LOT of training would get there, these are spaced around the track to minimise reaction times.\n\nThe medical car would take the shortest route all already practiced and known for every section of track and would also be told to by race control and okd so everyone knows where that car’s moving and how.\n\nAt the same time the nearest marshals will be reacting and getting out flags, fire suppression and driver support and if the driver is trying to get out themselves they may assist or not depending on the situation.\n\n\nAll of that will happen and be radiod and made to happen within 20-30 seconds from the moment of impact!\n\nAnd occasionally yes, if you’re in the radio to a marshal who’s on site and the cameras haven’t seen it you might be the one who puts a thumb up in race control or speaks a little more loudly and says “thumbs up driver all ok”\n\nAll of the above happens very quietly by the way and very very calmly in 95% of race controls for F1.', '1. They have race control listening in for them. They’ll be told ‘X says he’s okay and I can see him getting out of the car’, ‘Y says he can’t self extract or feel his left leg’, ‘We haven’t had any response at all from Z’ via the radio from Race Control.\n\n2. They should go in the direction of the track if possible. They’re going on a live track with other cars going around with them (even if it’s the other cars heading to the pits), Marshals hopping out expecting them to be coming one way. Obviously this can be deviated from but it’s unlikely to be.', 'I don’t think anyone has said this but the drivers have an ok button on the wheel that they can press, that’s why after a crash we see a little onboard message saying “I’m ok” with no sound and a few minutes later we hear the actual onboard message with the race engineer.', 'I would assume they act as instructed by race control, same as with other interventions', 'The first rule of helping someone else is always to make sure that you are in a condition to provide that help. It\'s the basic ""put your oxygen mask on, then help others put theirs on"" rule. Hence, you *never* run opposite of traffic. You can\'t help a dude if you die in a wreck on the way to the scene. It also wouldn\'t be terribly helpful to cause a second wreck when there is already one active.\n\nAs a basic example: Think of the barriers. Barriers are set up to protect from one direction. In the opposite direction, they become solid beams of steel just waiting to jump out and kill you when you make a minor driving mistake on the way the existing crash.', 'This is really interesting. Maybe it’s one you could contact the teams/media with (and then please reply with findings!) \n\nMy guess would be that the race director has some buttons to notify the teams of a crash and that driver has declared himself OK. \n\nIt’s pure speculation however', '>Firstly, how is driver radio communicated?

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.
