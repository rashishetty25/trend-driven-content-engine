Colapinto TBD.

  
Oh, and Lawson.

  
We don't talk about Doohan.

  
Honest question, I don't know much about rookie seasons in the past, but just having seven rookies in a season seems like it wouldn't happen too often, let along having 4 or 5 potential stayers.","['2001 - Alonso, Raikkonen, Montoya', ""2007 - Hamilton, Vettel, ~~Kubica~~, Kovalainen\n\nEdit: That's 11 WDCs, for those counting"", '1991 - Michael Schumacher, Mika Hakkinen, Karl Wendlinger, Alex Zanardi', '1991, Michael Schumacher and Mika Hakkinen. 9 World Driving Championships.', '2019 - Norris, Russell, Albon', ""TBH Bortoleto is also a TBD, he'd be consistently getting points if he didn't drive a tractor."", 'Hot take, I think bortoleto will be a future champion and is way more likely to be than hadjar or even antonelli. Beating hulkenberg very consistently while also staying out of the limelight and getting on with his job with no issues. Some of his drives in f3 were seriously impressive, especially one in Belgium where he drove from 25th (?) to points and almost won the title in a shortened, wet race. He‚Äôs made a few mistakes but never anything significant in terms of cost to the team which will definitely help them with development in the cost cap era and suggests he‚Äôs driving within his limits. Think Audi will come good quickly, Wheatley was a great pickup and binotto, even though it isn‚Äôt his main role, is brilliant at building engines. I wouldn‚Äôt be suprised if he was at the top of f1 in a few years as he has the attitude and environment to win.', '1950 had some good rookies: Ascari, Fangio, Fagioli, Chiron, Villoresi, Farina, Trintignant, Taruffi, Gonzalez,...

Bortoleto unlike Hadjar has won titles, no less back to back F2 and F3 titles. He is in the group of Piastri, Leclerc and Russell to have done it, so anyone who does it is pretty good to say the least. He has outqualified Hulkenberg who is one of the fastest drivers on one lap as highlighted by last year's performances in the Haas. The Sauber is also not fast at all, so is difficult to show your talent. \n\nAntonelli obviously is up there in raw talent and pace, Lawson isn't going to stay for next year, Doohan is nothing spectacular with Colapinto being better than both IMO. Bearman has been good as well, but the Haas is tempremental""]",38,81,0.63,38,813,813,-4,0,-0.010000000000000009,-4
