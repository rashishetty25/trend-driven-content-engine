Two Red Bull starts and then another seat in F1 is more than most of them will ever get.', '>Lawson’s removal from the Red Bull seat is perhaps the most extreme example\n\nAn extreme example would be sending him to F2. Exchanging seats with a sister team is nothing. Other team sports do this all the time.', 'Hasn’t it always been said that F1 isn’t a finishing school? Why is everyone babying these drivers now. The argument would be better if it’s acknowledged that the drivers are starting way too young now vs previous generations.', 'Lol this is becoming excessive now.\n\nMost drivers do not get a chance to still drive in f1 after losing their seat actually. What happened to Lawson sucks, but he had a safety net which 99% of the drivers out there do not. And I’d bet that unless he’s absolutely disastrous at VCARB this year, he’ll be driving for them next year too.', ""Maybe it's damaging.   Maybe not. \n\n\nLook, a lot of these guys are obviously going to be young.  They should have teams around them that should focus on their progress for their benefit. \n\nRed Bull being ruthless is not new.  Juniors, and their teams, should be focusing on getting their details right so they are ready.   Don't just focus on climbing up as fast as possible with little regard to the rest."", ""You spend your whole life trying to get into F1...what makes you think anyone is going to pass on the opportunity to sit in the reigning WDC car alongside a 4x champ? If I'm young that's the exact seat I want, I didn't get to that level to settle with a back marker. Nor do I want to wait while the 2nd driver flounders in last.
