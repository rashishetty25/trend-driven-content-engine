I today discovered an article on the Formula 1 website that went into detail about some of the technical niches about the McLaren car, and found that it was of quite a high quality. It is worth noting I have absolutely no understanding of aerodynamics or engineering, but still I found it a very interesting read that gave an idea about how the team is trying to develop its car and go a certain way, and combating its limitations. It also tries to make a link to the potentially affected performance of the drivers. Here is that article:

1lec2mr,Which team has the best driver pairing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lec2mr/which_team_has_the_best_driver_pairing/,2025-06-18, Discussion,"I've been doing these on occasion in past and thought this season might be particularly interesting given how many rookies we have on the grid. Let's ignore the back markers and just focus on the top 4 or maybe 5 teams. In no particular order:

- Mercedes: Russell is proving that he can lead the team in the post Hamilton era and has managed to keep himself a close as possible to the McLarens. The season is still long and for now he can't be ruled out. Antonelli has been super solid so far and his podium shows that he can deliver under pressure. The recent unreliability of the car makes him a bit harder to judge though.

- Red Bull: Max is Max and if you ignore his idiotic brawl with Russell it's fair to say that he has gotten the most out of the car and, same as Russell, has kept himself in the fight. Let's not talk about the second seat.

- Ferrari: Ferrari is doing Ferrari things which, same as in previous seasons, makes this pairing rather hard to judge. Mainly Hamilton. Has he lost the edge? Is he still adjusting? Is he getting swallowed by the usual Ferrari drama? Chuck is doing what he can with what the team is giving him.

- McLaren: easily the strongest pairing imo and the driver standings show that. They have the best car on most tracks and both Norris and Piastri are delivering as expected. On an individual level, neither might be on the same level as Max and maybe Chuck, but they are as close as one can get. Neither have been flawless, of course. 

So for me it's McLaren first and then a close fight between Merc and Ferrari, with Red Bull being a distant fourth simply because they effectively only have one car. It's their luck Max is as good as he is.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic!","[""Williams might not be the absolute best, but they're worth mentioning in this conversation. Carlos and Alex are both very good drivers."", 'If we assume that a smaller gap in qualifying and race pace reflects a stronger teammate pairing—i.e., both drivers are maximizing the performance of their car—then the answer is undoubtedly Mclaren.', 'Today, I think Ferrari has the best pairing. They also have a shit organization and car.\n\nMcLaren is second - Piastri shines this year and has been steadily improving, whereas Norris seems to have reached his maximum already and, while very good, isn\'t going to be a ""great"".\n\nMercedes will be the best in a few years (Kimi seems to be great, but needs to grow, George already is top tier).\n\nRB is the worst, because they have only one driver.', 'Norris and Piastri', 'Probably McLaren at the moment.', 'Mercedes. They have a good car and have a talented rookie who is picking up well and a veteran who is able to lead the car into podiums and points consistently.\n\nMclaren have two folks who are contenders for the championship which creates a headache (a good one but a headache nonetheless).\n\nFerrari have two GOATs who don’t have a good car and are thus unable to perform \n\nRedbull have a cursed second seat\n\nSo it is Mercedes then mclaren then Ferrari', ""I'm torn between Ferrari and Williams, but McLaren is also close."", ""IMO I think McLaren have the best driver pairing, both Norris and Piastri seem to be pushing each other. Forgetting their collision in Montreal the other day they seem to work well in harmony together for the most part. I will say Norris seems to have peaked whereas Piastri in his third season still seems like he's growing and is already beginning to look more like a potential WDC. Still though its refreshing to see two drivers of a same ability in the fastest car give each other a decent fight - compared to Hamilton & Bottas at Mercedes and Verstappen & Perez at Red Bull.\n\nUnrelated note but as a neutral fan I've been rooting for Verstappen for most of this year, but I'm already beginning to think that Piastri is going to win it this year - he looks like he is the real deal. I always had great hopes for him in 2023-24 but thought he needed to be more consistent, but it seems like he has worked on those so far in 2025. I will say though, I still think Norris, Verstappen and Russell will stay in the fight though until the last few rounds. We're definitely looking at a 2010 style season here IMO. \n\nFerrari too have two very consistent drivers too - Leclerc is doing everything he can despite the shit show at Maranello and Hamilton is still delivering consistent points finishes despite being past his peak. All in all that should help the prancing horses in the battle for second in the championship. Russell is doing so well as Mercedes team leader in the post Hamilton era, and I'm impressed by how Antonelli is doing too in his rookie season. If Mercedes had better reliability they would be a much more consistent second in the constructors, thats the only thing IMO that is letting them down right now. \n\nRed Bull I won't even go into big detail about, if it wasn't for Verstappen's heroics they would be nowhere near McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari in the constructors. In fact they wouldn't be near Williams at all - judging by how little points Tsunoda has scored and Lawson nowhere near the points in the first two races, I'd see Red Bull down there at the bottom with the likes of Aston Martin, Sauber & Alpine.\n\nI will say though, Williams are worth a mention too. Albon and Sainz now he's sort of up to speed a bit now are getting in consistent points finishes and as the season reaches its halfway point they're a good comfortable fifth and it looks like it is going upward at that team. Already the team looks so different from the days when they had drivers like Latifi and Sargeant. \n\nPersonally I'd rank the top four driver pairings as McLaren, Ferrari, Williams & Mercedes - the rest of the grid IMO is up for subjective opinion."", 'I’d say Ferrari, but they have the worst strategists in F1 😂']",0,183,0.4,0,492,492,0,1,-0.02999999999999997,0

But Piastri made an even more amateurish mistake in Abu Dhabi (driving into the back of Colapinto) with the WCC on the line. It happens. Hamilton has had his fair share of braindead moments through the years. Didn't do him much harm. I don't think Norris can be too unhappy with a 22 point deficit given how the season has played out. Considering that Piastri has improved immensely from last year (where I thought he was massively overrated, probably not one of the top ten drivers on the grid) and Norris has been incredibly disappointing, that's a very manageable gap. It remains to be seen if Piastri can keep this up for a whole year. We know that Norris can be much better than this.
