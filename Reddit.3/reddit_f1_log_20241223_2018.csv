1hk8x55,Why did Mika Hakkinen take a sabbatical from Formula 1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hk8x55/why_did_mika_hakkinen_take_a_sabbatical_from/,2024-12-22, Discussion,"I know for a fact that he took a sabbatical, but a sabbatical is considered a sabbatical given that he/she returns. But Mika did not, instead he went to DTM. Was Mika too old for F1 or did other teams did not want Mika in their car? I dont recall Ron & Mika having a fallout which lead to his sabbatical. Also, how good or bad was his DTM career? I saw some stats on Wiki it said 5th 8th and 11th, but I dont know if Hakkinen's cars were top tier or just mediocre which was unable to deliver good results, or that he was bad in DTM.

1hkqm89,Women liking F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkqm89/women_liking_f1/,2024-12-23, Discussion,"so I'm a teen (f) and I've been watching F1 since I can remember. I literally grew up watching every race, my father being a hard-core fan. Hell I saw some of these ""big"" races, like I remember watching anxiously as Romain Grosjean spun off, the car catching fire and I even remember then the feed being cut off cause they did not want to show anymore incase he didn't make it out alive. 

Anyway, I've been a core ferrari fan all my life. It's not because of any one thing in particular and I don't support all of the teams decisions, but because it was a team my father once supported. I fell in love with RED and the emotions attached with the teams previous driver like Räikkönen and Vettel. 

But now, it's become so insanely mainstream. Drive to survive has made it into this insanely big thing where there are so many people who now all of a sudden care about motorsport only cause the drivers look good. There's no issue with being a new fan, however my issue is that so many people talking only about the drivers looks invalidates the skill and people who care about the racing aspect, especially as a woman.
The moment you talk about F1 with men who don't know you, the first assumption is that we only watch the sport cause of the men. I had to mention the ferrari thing earlier now because it happens a lot more when you saw you're a ferrari fan.

Now, obviously certain men are the issue but it's genuinely becoming increasingly common to have a view point as such and I wanted to know of other women who watch F1 have experienced a similar outlook.

Disclaimer, I'm not talking about all men or only men but it's simply an observation.","[""For every gate there's a crappy keeper that wants to deem people not worthy. Never feel the need to prove your f1ness to some asshat.
