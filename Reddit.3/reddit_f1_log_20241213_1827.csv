1hcs00b,Has Ben Sulayem overestimated his power?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hcs00b/has_ben_sulayem_overestimated_his_power/,2024-12-12, Discussion,"Ben Sulayem made some interesting comments today about the FIA not having the funds to employ permanent stewards, so I thought I’d share a few thoughts on where his presidency seems to be heading.

Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run. Sulayem’s approach as president has been… combative, to say the least. A lot of his decisions seem more about ego than actually serving the role. He’s alienated key stakeholders and made governance changes that look like attempts to shield himself from accountability, which hasn’t done much for his reputation—or the FIA’s, for that matter.

Honestly, his position feels shaky. The next FIA elections are still a year away, and maybe he won’t face serious opposition, but the level of discontent right now suggests bigger problems within the organization. What we’re seeing play out publicly is probably just the surface.

At the end of the day, his authority isn’t limitless. The drivers and teams are the ones who really hold the power in F1, and history shows they aren’t afraid to push back when they’re unhappy—even to the point of threatening to leave the sport entirely. Sulayem seems to be gambling a lot by antagonizing them, and I’m not sure he fully understands just how strong their influence is.

This whole power struggle seems like it will rumble on over the off season. The longer it drags on, the more damage it could do—not just to his presidency, but to F1 itself.

I’m interested to hear others thoughts on the topic. How do you see this playing out, and could the FIA find itself in real trouble if things don’t change?","[""> Right now, it feels like something’s got to give. No one within the sport seems particularly happy with how things are being run.\n\nThat's just sorta politics though, it always looks like something has to give, but the reality is Formula 1 is only a part of the FIA, and only relevant to a few of its wealthiest member nations/constituent clubs of which there are some 250 from 147 countries. Things look to be at a breaking point, then a few things elsewhere get shuffled around in the background and suddenly everyone's happy.\n\nIs F1 important? Is it the single most important FIA activity? Yeah, probably, but as F1 fans we're still only seeing a fraction of the FIA's overall purview. If the Ugandan Karting scene doesn't have the same beef with Sulayem that Formula One does, he's not going to have much problem being reelected."", ""A very important point is that the FIA president first and foremost serves the FIA members and not F1. F1 doesn't have much of a say, the member clubs elect the president and their leadership team. And so far it does in fact not look like Ben Sulayem is in danger of losing reelection next year. I would recommend reading this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5xbgv/jeppe_olesen_on_the_back_of_all_the_mbs/)regarding the FIA presidential elections."", ""The teams and commercial side breaking away is a popular Reddit power fantasy. The unfortunate reality of it is that the FIA owns F1 both as a series and a brand, and Indycar's shown us that *everyone* is worse off for a split - but especially the commercial side.\n\nThis is why the teams and FOM do not hold the power some people think they do. They can threaten to break away, haggle and negotiate, sure, but a breakaway involves far too much money lost for them to ever really make good on it. The FIA technically isn't a for-profit organisation. That's why the FIA president can get away with just about everything short of murder, and MBS simply hasn't done anything stupid enough to make his position truly untenable."", 'I think a lot of folks here want to believe the FIA and MBS is the problem. The issue is likely far more complicated. A lot of the issues are more the problem with the FOM than the FIA. Paying for full time FIA stewards is something that the FIA should address with the FOM. The FIA is a non-profit, it cannot simply ""get revenue and add costs"" from nowhere. The FOM should pay for the full time stewards for F1 and that is a project that the FIA rightly addresses. \n\nThe ENTIRETY of the FIA (including all motorsports not only F1) has about 300 full time employees. Their annual budget runs into the 150-200m Euro range. The annual income after taxes is less than 10m Euro (2023). For comparison this is smaller than a single F1 team\'s annual budget.\n\nIf the FIA has to hire 3-4 full time stewards, fly time to every F1 venue, this would very likely cost them several million Euro a year. It isn\'t hard to see why the FIA needs the FOM to pony up this kind of expense.', 'As much as MBS is unpopular to fans. Neither was Blatter or Infantino right now for FIFA. David Stern of NBA also was not popular. It took quite a bit of scandal to finally see the end of Mosley. \n\nReality is, fans are not the stakeholders the presidents/commissioner etc answer to, their unpopularity is irrelevant to the job they perform. Though I feel MBS is a bit different in that a lot of his unpopular moves seems to be about him specifically rather than necessarily large scale FIA decisions.', 'I’m not sure why he’s being blamed for this when they have *never* had permanent stewards and he is at least starting the conversation around fixing that, albeit with the caveat that the funds have to come from somewhere. Surely this is a reasonable starting point, rather than letting the problem endlessly fester like previous presidents did?\n\nAs for all the resignations and other changes, I still remain open minded as it’s not been very transparent, but the FIA never has been since long before he came in. And any media coverage of him always has a bit of a stink of racism that makes me take it with a pinch of salt. Part of me wonders if he’s just breaking up the old boys club that has been running things without consequence for so long.', ""Hasn't the FIA always been shady? I vaguely remember the whole group B debacle where the FIA was pretty much ignoring spectator and driver deaths since the sport was so popular. And then there was a whole slew of F1 controversies that people were mad about but almost every casual F1 fan has never even heard about those or has forgotten about it.

Would you like to end of third in the WCC because one of the drivers is bringing in enough money that the higher ups are still happy ? You've worked your whole life to end up here, but money talks more than performance. So you're not happy.

This must be bring down the morale of the whole team, and that means people leaving for greener pastures. The majority of people working at Red Bull want to _win_, not to make more money for the stakeholders and Checo's presence is working against that goal.

This might be a significant enough reason to drop him despite the money, especially since Red Bull has been losing engineers left and right since the new regs.

Magnussen is more of an exception to the rule than a prime example, and it was probably either because he was retiring anyway, or because he was too open about the fact that he had nothing to lose and so didn’t care about breaking the rules. In other cases, once a driver gets close to 12 points, the stewards become deaf and blind. They give any punishment whatsoever other than penalty points.', 'Unlikely.

This is important to point out because he likely doesn't do whatever he did if he knows that a race ban is nearby. Also, while the Austria thing was possibly not something he avoids (light contact with big consequences and with drivers staying on track) there is also the possibility (high imo) that something like that does not result in penalty points if the driver in question is near a race ban.
