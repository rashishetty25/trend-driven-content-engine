While the immediate impetus for the renovations is the arrival of MotoGP in 2027, the ultimate goal is far more ambitious: to return the pinnacle of motorsport to Argentinian soil after an absence of over two decades from the calendar.\n\nThe project\'s master plan has been designed by Hermann Tilke, the renowned German engineer responsible for numerous modern Formula 1 circuits. His proposal, selected from several alternatives, foresees the construction of a new track measuring almost five kilometres, incorporating contemporary safety standards and significant design modifications.\n\nWhile the new circuit will achieve FIA Grade 2 homologation — a prerequisite for hosting top-level international competitions — this is still insufficient for the immediate return of Formula 1, which requires Grade 1 certification. Nevertheless, the authorities view this as a stepping stone towards achieving that goal in the near future.\n\n\'We have a two-phase plan. The first phase is for MotoGP in 2027, and the second phase is for Formula 1. This involves upgrading to a full A licence for the FIM and achieving Grade 1 status for the F1. It\'s not just about technical issues and all the requirements we have; it\'s also about the walls and the fenders. All of this should result in a very good and exciting circuit,"" Hermann Tilke explained at the official announcement event, which SoyMotor.com attended via our Latin American correspondent, Daniel Panelo.\n\nThe remodelling will have a profound effect on the appearance of the Buenos Aires layout. Historic bends such as Vivorita, Cajón, Ombú, Tobogán Traverso and the S for Senna will be redesigned and removed to create a safer, more fluid design. However, the names of these bends will live on, as they will be used to christen curves and sections of the new course.\n\nThe Curvón Salotto and Chicana de Ascari area, on the other hand, will remain unchanged, preserving a part of circuit number 12 which is familiar to fans of national motor racing.\n\nThe project is being led by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires in collaboration with private promoters such as the OSD Group. In addition to the layout modifications, improvements to infrastructure, safety and access will be made, including new kerbs, optimised drainage, tyre protection, electrical upgrades and grandstands with a capacity of up to 120,000 spectators.\n\n\\[...\\]']",706,83,0.95,706,1370,1370,8,1,0.0,8

There is speculation in the paddock that the power unit in partnership with Ford may not perform as well as expected.\n\nThere are still a few months to go before the best-kept secret is revealed: the performance and reliability of next year\'s power units. Only time will tell if Honda will take a different approach with batteries and, above all, if Aston Martin will be able to combine the Japanese manufacturer\'s expertise with Adrian Newey\'s input.']",562,96,0.97,562,1894,1894,4,3,0.0,4

So obvious that an article is unnecessary. All drivers in hunt for title are selfish. They’d rather be the only driver in the team that matters—and this is evident in every single championship season.', '>""While that\'s not a big deal, I would rather keep it [the front suspension set-up] the same and get as accurate a read I can on the other big things we are changing, and I\'ve not particularly felt the need to go in that direction.\n\nI think a fair amount of people had completely taken this situation to nirvana with the outcry that McLaren is being biased by **forcing** Piastri to change to the new suspension in that recent news spike. \n\nPiastri has explained that there were issues with the MCL-39 as well, but his problems were not as pronounced as Norris\'s. And this article is the answer to the proposed suspension change. My understanding of his POV is that he is able to work with the current suspension that he has been using thus far, and if it is guaranteeing consistency and fair results on his end, he is able to focus on other aspects of the car that could use improving, and it does not compromise his performance either \n\nWhatever McLaren opts to do with their suspension scenario is up to their own prerogative, considering they have a better read of their situation than I do, but I am still pretty darn proud of the trajectory McLaren has had over the course of the few years, and the fact McLaren has stated that they are trying to settle any issues with their cars as soon as it is identified is admirable as well', ""The new update supposedly kills some of the Ackerman, leading to less wheel scrub when cornering.\xa0\n\n\nTaking out the Ackerman would make the turn in less sharp and give the wheel more of a floaty feeling vs a quick response and a heavy wheel where you can feel the traction/breakaway.\xa0\n\n\nIt's more of a feel issue, with minor tire wear benefits to take wheel scrub out.\xa0\n\n\nI would imagine the tighter corners like Monaco or turn 1 Spa Landos setup would be less desirable.

Why that is so is perhaps only a matter of speculation, but the closest explanation the team has offered is a lack of ‘cuing’, which roughly refers to feedback offered from the car during turn-in, generally through the steering wheel, an issue firmly placed by many on the new front-suspension.\n\nHowever, what I find interesting is that Oscar mentioned the unpredictability issue while refusing the new front suspension. This suggests to me that perhaps the unpredictability issue he’s referring to is either unrelated to the front suspension, or more likely that he has managed to understand the car’s behaviour better than Lando because he ‘feels’ the car in a different way, i.e not primarily through steering feedback. Fascinating stuff either way.', 'I liked the insight that he doesn’t want to try the new front suspension because it adds a variable to the car on top of other upgrades they’ve added, and he’d rather have a clear baseline for assessing those first. \n\nAlso his comment that he would consider trying it (again) later in the season… which maybe means if he ends up behind Norris in the WDC and needs to take more risks. Unless of course this is PR speak for basically he’ll try it if McLaren require him to adopt it.', 'So basically what every driver from every top team has been saying all year.', 'Yeah he def used it in Canada FP1.

That being said he’s been cleared, he carried on, it’s done! But the BBC nor Sky seemingly can’t let it go.

Red Bull sacking him I can understand. Performance has fallen, he’s damaged the brand due to his ‘infidelity’ being made public, they may lose Max to a direct rival, and the way he currently manages the team may not be to RedBull parent company liking. Call it power struggle etc..
