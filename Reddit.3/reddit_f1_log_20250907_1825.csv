I truly don‚Äôt understand why someone would offer this to their championship rival.

I saw on some other threads that some people were saying it was the team‚Äôs idea and not Lando‚Äôs. I went into Lando‚Äôs POV which sometimes included extra radio messages which didn‚Äôt make it into the main feed but nope, the main feed didn‚Äôt miss any context. It was Lando‚Äôs idea. Here is the transcript:

Team: Lando we will box this lap after the soft tire <more words I don‚Äôt understand>

Lando: do you want to pit the other car first?

Team: yep we‚Äôll do that. We‚Äôll swap it around so stay out

Lando: well only if he doesn‚Äôt undercut otherwise I‚Äôll pit first

Team: There will be no undercut

So the team said ‚Äúbox this lap‚Äù then based on what Lando said they switched to ‚Äústay out‚Äù.

What was Lando trying to do? Did he just not want to risk a SC in the lap between the two stops?","['I think it was a way of not getting fucked over by a safety car if it happened after he pitted', 'Either he was worried about a safety car (or hoping for one to challenge for the win) or he was worried about tyre life on the soft and wanted one less lap on them.', 'Because he wanted the advantages of pitting second. Namely a safety car. Fresher tyres in the end. Not bothered by undercut as McLaren told him so.\n\nPiastri should have never given the place back', 'Is lando\'s "" do you want to pit the other car first"" a suggestion or a question?', 'It was clearly something Lando thought would benefit him, either 1 lap less on used tyres or to save against a safety car. No way was it for Oscar‚Äôs benefit', ""The only hope they had of a win was a safety car.  Going 2nd gave him the extra lap if it came out where he'd benefit.  That's it.  With the undercut not expected (only happened due to the pit issue), it made sense."", 'I don‚Äôt buy the story of them being worried about leclerc. Although the McLaren stop for Piastri was incredible, he emerged from the pits still around 4/5 seconds in front. Another lap wouldn‚Äôt bring Charles in front. They also offered the stop to Lando initially anyway. If they were so worried about it they would have told Lando they were pitting Piastri first and explain why. \n\nLando didn‚Äôt mention covering Charles in his radio message. My only guess is he wanted track position and fresher tyres. Lando will want as many cars between him and Oscar as possible to bring that points gap down. When they are so far in front in the teams championship I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt care about making sure they get 3 points over Ferrari if him teammate was to finish 3rd or 4th. \n\nI think McLaren didn‚Äôt want their pit crew to feel like they were influencing the championship. Oscar was reeling Lando in a few laps before they stopped to put himself in a position to capitalise on any errors and that‚Äôs exactly what happened. \n\nIf this championship somehow goes to the wire and it‚Äôs within a 3 point margin I would not want to be McLaren trying to explain this.', ""My best guess was that he had gap big enough that Oscar wouldn't undercut him and wanted to have fresher tires to hold him off. One lap difference for softs is big, especially since he knew that Oscar would be pushing super hard on the outlap."", ""This is why they shouldn't have swapped back imo, they gave him a choice, he choose this and it just happened to come with a bad pitstop which could have happened anyway. \n\nIf he pit first and still had a bad pitstop swapping them around would be even more laughable""]",35,89,0.71,35,86,86,35,89,0.71,35

1nak7iq,Why did Mercedes reveal the DAS system in 2020 instead of 2021?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nak7iq/why_did_mercedes_reveal_the_das_system_in_2020/,2025-09-07, Discussion,"I still don't understand to this day why Mercedes decided to reveal DAS during the 2020 pre-season test. We know today that the Mercedes W11 of 2020 is the most dominant, even the fastest car of all time. They essentially had both the WDC and WCC wrapped up weeks before the teams even headed to Melbourne for the season opener and based on pre-season tests like 2023, teams are highly aware when one team has a dominant car aka the Red Bull so Mercedes of all teams should've also been aware of the gap their 2020 challenger had over the competition.


Moreover, we know also from previous testimony from ex-Mercedes members like Paddy Lowe that in 2014, they deliberately ran low engine modes to hide their enormous gap they built in the new regulations to slow the FIA down from allowing the regulations to let the other teams catch-up.


This begs the question - why didn't they save DAS for the 2021 season? It's of course easier to say with hindsight after COVID happened and the 7 straight years of Mercedes dominance since 2014 that nobody expected Red Bull to produce a title challenger for 2021. Nevertheless, considering Lewis and Max were literally on equal points going into Abu Dhabi in 2021, DAS could've easily been the difference between Lewis winning the WDC and not had it not been banned for the 2021 season which Mercedes facilitated by revealing it in 2020.","[""Sry i stole the Crystal ball from Mercedes in late 2019\n\nThey simply couldn't have known they would be so dominant in 2020 and not 2021 without it."", 'Wasn‚Äôt 2020 supposed to be the last year of the regulations?

1navn43,I'm actually shocked at how negative the reactions are in the F1 world towards sportsmanship,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1navn43/im_actually_shocked_at_how_negative_the_reactions/,2025-09-07, Discussion,"As somone who was watching F1 as a kid, then stopped, and is coming back more and more those last few years, I'm actually surprised at how many F1 fans view sportsmanship actions such as Piastri's today as bad.  
  
In a marathon, if someone leads a race, but misses the last refreshment point and as a result drops 100m from the finish line, and the second runner picks them up to help them win because they deserve it, both of them would be celebrated.  
The second one would be seen as a hero for high sportsmanship, while the other runner would still be celebrated for winning the race.  
  
But in Formula 1, it seems like people have been matrixed into thinking that to be a real champion, you need to be brutal and not care about what is or is not fair.
