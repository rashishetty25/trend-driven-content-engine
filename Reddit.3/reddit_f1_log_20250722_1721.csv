While the immediate impetus for the renovations is the arrival of MotoGP in 2027, the ultimate goal is far more ambitious: to return the pinnacle of motorsport to Argentinian soil after an absence of over two decades from the calendar.\n\nThe project\'s master plan has been designed by Hermann Tilke, the renowned German engineer responsible for numerous modern Formula 1 circuits. His proposal, selected from several alternatives, foresees the construction of a new track measuring almost five kilometres, incorporating contemporary safety standards and significant design modifications.\n\nWhile the new circuit will achieve FIA Grade 2 homologation — a prerequisite for hosting top-level international competitions — this is still insufficient for the immediate return of Formula 1, which requires Grade 1 certification. Nevertheless, the authorities view this as a stepping stone towards achieving that goal in the near future.\n\n\'We have a two-phase plan. The first phase is for MotoGP in 2027, and the second phase is for Formula 1. This involves upgrading to a full A licence for the FIM and achieving Grade 1 status for the F1. It\'s not just about technical issues and all the requirements we have; it\'s also about the walls and the fenders. All of this should result in a very good and exciting circuit,"" Hermann Tilke explained at the official announcement event, which SoyMotor.com attended via our Latin American correspondent, Daniel Panelo.\n\nThe remodelling will have a profound effect on the appearance of the Buenos Aires layout. Historic bends such as Vivorita, Cajón, Ombú, Tobogán Traverso and the S for Senna will be redesigned and removed to create a safer, more fluid design. However, the names of these bends will live on, as they will be used to christen curves and sections of the new course.\n\nThe Curvón Salotto and Chicana de Ascari area, on the other hand, will remain unchanged, preserving a part of circuit number 12 which is familiar to fans of national motor racing.\n\nThe project is being led by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires in collaboration with private promoters such as the OSD Group. In addition to the layout modifications, improvements to infrastructure, safety and access will be made, including new kerbs, optimised drainage, tyre protection, electrical upgrades and grandstands with a capacity of up to 120,000 spectators.\n\n\\[...\\]']",510,71,0.95,510,52,52,12,1,0.0,12

That\'s according to German journalist Ralf Bach.\n\nWith the change in regulations just around the corner, drivers, teams and engine manufacturers are beginning to see clearly the direction they will be taking from next year onwards. There are only 12 races left — just halfway through the season — before everything changes completely. Everyone will start from scratch, and the progress made so far will count for little or nothing.\n\nHowever, some teams are devoting more effort than others to the coming season. However, the reality is that what we see on the track today will not necessarily correspond to next year. We are on the verge of a twist in the script.\n\nIn the latest video published by the F1-Insider website, Ralf Bach analyses the future of single-seaters in the run-up to 2026. He suggests that Honda is taking a different approach to the rest of the manufacturers when it comes to the battery circuit. If so, this will set them apart from the other manufacturers: Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull\'s partnership with Ford.\n\nBach made it clear that Honda is going its own way when it comes to the battery circuit. Ferrari and Mercedes are going one way, but Honda is trying something different.""\n\nHonda is set to begin its partnership with Aston Martin in 2026. Although the engine manufacturer is still working with Red Bull, the reality is that it has its sights set on its next project. Furthermore, it has closed the door on the energy drinks team: if the 2026 engine fails, there will be no going back, warns HRC president Koji Watanabe. The reason? There is speculation in the paddock that the power unit in partnership with Ford may not perform as well as expected.\n\nThere are still a few months to go before the best-kept secret is revealed: the performance and reliability of next year\'s power units. Only time will tell if Honda will take a different approach with batteries and, above all, if Aston Martin will be able to combine the Japanese manufacturer\'s expertise with Adrian Newey\'s input.', ""There's no reason to think Honda, Ferrari and Mercedes won't all have competitive power units.

And this article is the answer to the proposed suspension change. My understanding of his POV is that he is able to work with the current suspension that he has been using thus far, and if it is guaranteeing consistency and fair results on his end, he is able to focus on other aspects of the car that could use improving, and it does not compromise his performance either \n\nWhatever McLaren opts to do with their suspension scenario is up to their own prerogative, considering they have a better read of their situation than I do, but I am still pretty darn proud of the trajectory McLaren has had over the course of the few years, and the fact McLaren has stated that they are trying to settle any issues with their cars as soon as it is identified is admirable as well', 'Because the update suits Lando and he doesn’t want to yield advantage to his closest rival.

We will find out this weekend.\xa0"", 'To add a bit more detail, the precise word he used was unpredictable, something he also said the team has managed to overcome with setup etc. Stella has discussed in earlier interviews that this means it is difficult to replicate the same performance or behaviour from the car in successive laps. Why that is so is perhaps only a matter of speculation, but the closest explanation the team has offered is a lack of ‘cuing’, which roughly refers to feedback offered from the car during turn-in, generally through the steering wheel, an issue firmly placed by many on the new front-suspension.\n\nHowever, what I find interesting is that Oscar mentioned the unpredictability issue while refusing the new front suspension. This suggests to me that perhaps the unpredictability issue he’s referring to is either unrelated to the front suspension, or more likely that he has managed to understand the car’s behaviour better than Lando because he ‘feels’ the car in a different way, i.e not primarily through steering feedback.

1m6gb7x,[OC] A statistical analysis of the most (and least) successful podiums in F1 history,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m6gb7x/oc_a_statistical_analysis_of_the_most_and_least/,2025-07-22, Statistics,"Nico Hülkenberg’s first podium, inspired me to do a deep dive into the data to figure out what are the most accomplished trios to have ever shared a podium?

To figure this out, I looked at all podiums since the 1982 season (when the first Concorde Agreement was introduced) and assessed them in 2 ways:

1. **Absolute numbers**: total podiums, wins, and championships of the three drivers at the time of the podium 
2. **Relative terms**: Total podiums or wins as % of total races, and total championships as a % of total seasons in F1. This helps normalize the increasing number of races per season in the modern era.

# The Podium of Absolute Success: 

Unsurprisingly, the trio of Hamilton, Alonso and Verstappen stands far above the rest in raw numbers. They've only shared a podium 3 times, but they hold the records across the board, with the **2023 Canadian Grand Prix** podium being the most successful F1 podium in history in absolute terms \[Image 1\].

# The GOAT of Relative Success:

When examining relative success rates, one driver becomes the common denominator: **Michael Schumacher**. His presence defines the era of peak statistical dominance \[Image 2\].

* **Highest Podium Rate (Podiums as % of Races):**
   * **1st Place (57.6%):** The **1996 Portuguese GP** podium of Jacques Villeneuve, Damon Hill, and Michael Schumacher.
   * **2nd Place (54.0%):** The **2006 Italian GP** podium of Michael Schumacher, Kimi Räikkönen, and Robert Kubica.
* **Highest Win Rate (Wins as % of Races):**
   * **1st Place (28.1%):** The **2006 Italian GP** podium of Michael Schumacher, Kimi Räikkönen, and Robert Kubica.
   * **2nd Place (27.9%):** The **1996 Portuguese GP** podium of Jacques Villeneuve, Damon Hill, and Michael Schumacher.

When looking at the **Championships-to-Seasons ratio**, two distinct eras of dominance emerge, centered around two pairs of drivers: Hamilton & Vettel, Schumacher & Alonso \[Images 3 & 4\].

The highest ratio ever recorded was **32.1%** at the **2019 Canadian GP** (Hamilton, Vettel, Leclerc), following a decade of dominance by Hamilton and Vettel. The next seven highest records all come from **2006**, when Schumacher and Alonso competed against each other.

# Where does the ""HAM-ALO-VER"" trio rank relatively?

While they dominate the absolute numbers, their incredible longevity slightly lowers their relative stats. Still, they are firmly in the top tier \[Image 5\]. 

Out of 780 unique podiums since 1982, their 2023 Canadian GP podium ranks:

* **Podiums %:** 113th
* **Wins %:** 114th
* **Championships/Seasons Ratio:** 73rd

# The Least Accomplished Podiums

What about the podiums with the least experience? In the modern era, the chaotic **2020 Italian Grand Prix** stands out \[Image 6\].

The podium of **Pierre Gasly, Carlos Sainz, and Lance Stroll** is the least accomplished in absolute terms. It also ranks in the bottom three for relative success metrics. Other notable ""underdog"" podiums include the 2020 Sakhir GP (Perez, Ocon, Stroll) and the 1999 European GP (Herbert, Trulli, Barrichello) \[Image 7\]. 

# Hülkenberg’s Podium

So where does the Hulk's long-awaited podium rank? While it was a hugely celebrated moment, it sits on the lower end of the historical scale, which is expected given the youth of the other 2 drivers \[Image 8\]. 

In absolute terms, it ranks in the bottom 10-20% across all metrics. In relative terms, it's in the bottom 10%.

1m6ddho,Why are there so many engine rules ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m6ddho/why_are_there_so_many_engine_rules/,2025-07-22, Discussion,"The title.

The most obvious reasons are all the rules related to safety: for example, limiting the power of engines put a limit on how fast the cars are going, and on how fast they accelerate, which helps safety. Several rules on batteries and electric motors also are there for safety purpose.

Some other rules are there to help engines reliability: limiting piston speed, rev/min of engines... however, i think the engine quotas we have today might be enough to force teams to create reliable engines.

Similarly, some rules are there to limit cost of engines and prevent a money burning race. But in the era where we have cost-caps, i think those also are not needed anymore.

We also have rules about fuel efficiency, to help F1 (and their oil sponsors) do greenwashing (/hj). However we also have an allowed fuel limit per race, which i think should be enough to cover this part.

Overall, having a lot of rules limit how the engine manufacturers can innovate on engines, and i'm not sure this is a good thing ( r/changemyview ). Why don't we get rid of most of those specific rules about having X number of cylinders, a turbo, those specific energy recovering things, no energy recovery on this part of the car, enforcing a battery of that specific amount of power, etc...

I think that in addition to allow manufacturers to innovate more, this will also close the debate around v6, v10, hybrid, and all that things. Just tell the manufacturers ""Develop an engine, maximum 800HP, and that consume at most 80L of fuel in a race. You're limited to 4 full engines per year, start from the back every time you use one more"" (figures out of my a\*s, you get the idea). And let them cook the best engine with those requirements. Obviously, some rules regarding safety must be added to avoid battery fires, catastrophic failures, this kind of stuff. But most of the rules we have today are not about safety.","[""Because that's what the engine manufacturers want. If you remove all rules other than max power, there'll be mass spending until they find the meta layout and then everybody will use that, all one/two manufacturers left that is."", 'If everything is allowed then rules will be implemented once one team becomes too dominant and revenue decreases.  Ultimately it’s about making an entertaining product that makes people money; and the people making money have to be happy to stay in.', 'Look up what the “Formula” in “Formula 1” actually means.', 'You hit the nail on the head, it is about limiting innovation.\n\nInnovation costs money and raises performance without improving the show.\n\nEngines are far more restrictive now to stop rampant spending and dramatic performance gains of previous regulations.', 'Fun idea. Formula SAE / Student does this by just giving upper limits to power and fuel as well as the safety rules. Then teams just pick an engine (since the students can’t build one from scratch with cost, reliability and safety issues). Some teams go with 4 cylinder, some with 2, and use different mfgs and models. But in the end you can design and tune your car around a specific engine which makes all the cars more unique. \n\nBut in F1 it’s not that easy. \nThe cost cap was put in place to close the gap between the teams. Removing the “unnecessary” engine rules would counteract that. You’d likely end up with one engine manufacturer having “the best” engine, and one team building the best car around it. Then wildly different outcomes for the other teams. There’s so many more choices to make and things that could go wrong if you leave the major engine design aspects open. There’d be much bigger car performance gaps.\n\nAlso if you removed the rules today, a lot of manufactures would probably just stick with the engines they have now rather than gamble on a big change like V10 / V12. There’s so much risk in changing to one of those and cost to develop them. And it’s not a simple engineering question to determine which one is better. If they all started from scratch it would work, but not now.\n\nAnother reason for the current engines is so the engine manufacturers can (or at least claim to) use some of the same engine technology and advances for their road cars. They don’t want to spend tons of cash to develop an engine that they could only use for F1.', 'We have complex engine regulations because there are many different stakeholders who all sign off on the rules with many having different, competing, interests.\n\nThe FIA (or FOM) do not set the rules in a vacuum.\n\nThe engine manufacturers also highly influence the rules, using the threat of turning away from F1, if they don’t get what they want at minimum.\n\nHowever, there are several competing engine manufacturers, who all have different interests, with the biggest being preventing the competition getting any leg up in leveraging their IP.\n\nThe rules are created by committee, because there is a commercial necessity for it to be created like that.', '“having a lot of rules limit how the engine manufacturers can innovate on engines”\n\nOr it could be quite the opposite. Because there are so many rules, PU suppliers must innovate even harder to create comparative advantages in a tight field.', ""I do feel like there's a bunch of things that needs to be sunset in the formula and I for one would be happy with a less limiting formula for engines, but it's sorta hard to make that converge."", 'I honestly think the way the rules are set up right now is for the better.  \nGot nothing to add though as everything has been said by others down below in the comments already.']",0,31,0.35,0,30,30,0,0,0.0,0
