1l9ug8k,Stolen passport causes travel issues for Bortoleto ahead of Canadian GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l9ug8k/stolen_passport_causes_travel_issues_for/,2025-06-12, News,"Here’s a translation of the news:

Brazilian driver was the victim of a crime while having dinner in Zurich, Switzerland.

Gabriel Bortoleto arrived in Montreal for the Canadian Grand Prix after dealing with some issues in recent days. The Sauber driver was the target of a theft in Switzerland, where the team’s headquarters is located, and ended up without his passport.

The information was first reported by Band. Bortoleto’s car was broken into while he was having dinner in Zurich during the week. Some of his belongings and documents were taken, but he managed to recover most of what had been stolen.

The driver had to quickly replace his documents and traveled to Canada using a second passport. Despite the setbacks, he made it in time to take part in the official Canadian GP schedule, including interviews this Thursday (12th).

“I had gone out to dinner one night in Switzerland, and someone broke into the car and took my backpack. I had my passports in there, my laptop, all my racing gear,” Bortoleto told reporter Mariana Becker.

“It was chaos, but we managed to find the guy. Everything worked out in the end—I have my passports back. We didn’t recover everything, but we did get some of it,” he added.

Gabriel Bortoleto is currently 19th in the Drivers’ Championship and has yet to score points. He finished 12th in the Spanish GP.

It is widely understood that the latter had history to them that goes beyond their partnership with Mercedes, and the current Papaya camaraderie doesn't have that. Things might turn tense but the way McLaren has been speaking, from driver to CEO, I do believe that there is a contigency plan in place if things start to escalate\n\nI am a bit puzzled by those who are desperately aching for Piastri and Norris to have a catfight and have a perfectly stable partnership burned down to the ground, but to each their own, I suppose? Although, I am just not finding the idea pleasant, personally\n\nAdditionally, it might just be me but whoever wins this title amongst the two, will also have to face the wrath of some that it'll be the very end of their hopes to get a WDC, which I think this is an overreaction as well.

But these are young drivers in their early to mid 20s, who have approximately a few years left in the peak of their physique and technique, with a team that is believed to have the engine of a team that'll nail the regulations next year.

The only permitted type of tyre heating devices are blankets that comply with the design prescriptions listed in Article C10.8.4.\n\n>e. Any other device, system or procedure (except for driving of the car) the purpose and/or effect of which is to heat, or maintain the temperature of the hubs, or brakes, above the ambient air temperature, or to maintain their temperature if they are already warm, is prohibited.”\n\n>This has led teams to suggest that this could lead, and has led, teams to exploit this, and at a meeting of the World Motorsport Council, the FIA decided to rewrite this section.\n\n>It now reads: d. “The only permitted type of tyre heating devices are blankets that comply with the design prescriptions listed in Article C10.8.4.\n\n>e. With the exception of air entering through the apertures defined in C3.16.6 and C3.16.16, and the blankets permitted in (d) above.
