The leaders doing their pace, trying to create a gap to the midfield to slot in after the first stop. In this case, one Mclaren will try to undercut Leclerc and the other will opt to go longer creating a tyre delta for later. In this scenario it will be very hard for Leclerc to keep the lead. The undercut here is extremly powerful and if they are within 2 seconds before the first stop, one Mclaren will pass him, so Ferrari themselves have to try and be the first to pit.\n\n2. Do a monaco train and keep the field close together, aka driving 1-2 seconds slower than what they normally could do. Therefore the chance of an undercut is reduced a lot since the Mclarens cant slot into some free air. \nWith Leclercs slightly lower downforce setup, the 5 kph top speed adventage could be enough to keep the lead on the two straights but its risky cause with one bad exit of the final corner and mclarens superior traction and grip there he could still be vulnerable and then once he is passed mclaren will drive away and the rest of the race will be hard to recover. With the field so tight chances are he might get undercut by the likes of Russell even behind.\n\nI expect two stops, medium hard hard but some people might try the one stop. If temps are lower, this could lead more drivers to try the one stop, maybe even the likes of russell', 'One stopper it is', ""If i was starting at the back I'd probably try a start on the mediums, run them hard and fast to around lap 20ish and try an undercut on the hard tyre and run it to the end. I'd much rather try defending than overtaking at the Hungaroring."", 'Be so funny if Lec P1 finishes via just on3 stop, on Medium then Hard, repeating Monza 2024.\xa0\n\n\nWhilst the McLaren boys do Medium, Hard and Hard & run out of laps to catch-up.\xa0\n\n\nHope Ferrari has some calculations internally to not take the gamble as Lec is already on higher tyre degradation (low downforce) setup. Trying that will probably gift McLaren wins.\xa0', ""Fastest is medium hard hard, no question about it. Now, if everyone starts playing it safe (which they may do) then they will attempt a one stop and everyone else will try the same. This means that cars won't have any performance to overtake and it'll become a procession."", ""Good summary.\n\nI really hope Charles can hang on and fight for the win. He probably needs Russell to nab one of the Mclarens off the line so he's not vulnerable to Mclaren splitting strategy."", ""Yeah, outside of unexpected Ferrari pace like COTA 2024 or McLaren having some trouble there's almost no way Charles wins this unfortunately"", 'Norris does not have the best record when it comes to starts so it would not surprise me massively if Russell was ahead of him after turn 1.']",14,8,1.0,14,8,8,14,8,1.0,14
