What he’s doing in that car is special.', 'Was he ever out of it? The Red Bull likes high speed front limited tracks. I’m expecting him to be somewhere in midfield in Monaco.', 'Translation and full article:\n\n> **Max Verstappen turned the tide in the World Championship battle with his second win of the season at Imola. How did he manage that? In our race analysis, we answer the most important questions about the Emilia Romagna GP.**\n\n> **Why was Red Bull so good?**\nAfter dominating the Miami race, McLaren had to concede defeat to Red Bull in the seventh race of the season. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri finished second and third, respectively, behind Max Verstappen, who controlled the entire race. Verstappen once again laid the foundation with his brilliant overtaking maneuver in the Villeneuve chicane. Overall, however, Red Bull also had the better pace than McLaren and was clearly the stronger force. This put them back in the fight for the World Championship.\n\n> Red Bull was on par with its arch-rivals in the 400th Grand Prix in precisely the discipline where McLaren usually excels – tire wear. Despite the warm temperatures, they managed to keep their tires alive. Another bonus: Like in Suzuka, they were in the lead and had a clear path and clean air. The pit stop just in time for the Virtual Safety Car, which was deployed due to Esteban Ocon\'s stranded Haas, played into the Bulls\' hands.\n\n> But even afterward, it became clear: Verstappen had everything under control. He extended his lead to 18 seconds before the safety car neutralized the race due to Kimi Antonelli\'s damaged Mercedes. In other words, he controlled the race from start to finish. ""He was never under pressure,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. After the safety car, he opened up a lead of 6.1 seconds over ten laps.\n\n> This strength is primarily due to the car being brought into a better setup window. This also allows for better tire temperature management. This is partly due to the upgrades that have been made to the RB21 since Miami. These included a different underbody, and in Imola, a different cooling intake and new brake ventilation.\n\n> Although Friday didn\'t look so promising, Horner reports that Verstappen was happy after the third practice session on Saturday. A typical picture of the difficult Friday – but they still needed time to evaluate and understand all the data. Horner even went so far as to say that they were at the same level as last year in Brazil. After all, Verstappen crossed the finish line 6.1 seconds ahead of Norris and 12.9 seconds ahead of Piastri.\n\n> Horner finds the current development very encouraging. ""We\'re building momentum, which is very important at this stage of the championship."" Verstappen is now third in the World Championship, just 22 points behind Piastri. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella sees two reasons why Red Bull was superior. ""They\'ve improved and made progress,"" he says. He was almost certain that the dominance they showed in Miami wouldn\'t be replicated to the same extent in Imola. ""The type of corners here are completely different from those in Miami. Here we have more fast corners.""\n\n> **Did McLaren expect the strategy with Oscar Piastri?**\nHowever, the question also arose as to whether there might have been more to gain if the McLaren command post had chosen Piastri to pursue a different strategy. The Australian and current World Championship leader made his first pit stop on lap 13 and switched from medium to hard tires. In doing so, he followed the example of Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari, who was the first of the leading group to adopt this tactic.\n\n> Piastri dropped from second to twelfth place, but then had to plow his way through the field. By lap 28, he was back in fourth place. But then came a gift for all those who hadn\'t yet stopped – including Verstappen: the Virtual Safety Car deployed due to Esteban Ocon\'s stranded Haas. Piastri also used the opportunity to switch back to medium. At his second opportunity, when the Safety Car was deployed on lap 46 for Kimi Antonelli, he stayed on the track and was later unable to defend himself against teammate Norris with the older tires.\n\n> ""It was unclear before the race whether it would be one or two stops,"" said McLaren team principal Andrea Stella after the race. ""And when Oscar came into the pits, that was exactly the moment to decide."" In his opinion, the problem was more that the hard tires didn\'t perform much better than the old medium tires. ""If that had been better, the two-stop strategy would have been a very good one – even if he would have had to overtake a few drivers,"" Stella said. ""That\'s why we have no regrets.""\n\n(1/2)', 'He never left.', ""Excellent share and translation, thank you.\n\nRedBull's aero and brake cooling upgrades helped, but Max perfectly positioning himself to take the outside of T1, to get clean air, was his masterstroke."", '“I never left.”', ""All depends, right now the McLaren works at every track.

You can absolutely put everything together but luck also has a small part to play in how your race is going to go. It is what I thought of when I thought about some of the drivers that got their opportunities squandered after the VSC, particularly Sainz\n\nWilliams is on a roll! Strong as hell qualifying and a formidable race. A lot could have gone differently, most notably Sainz pitting right before the VSC was thrown into the mix. But it is a good thing he managed to recover it fairly well, with the pace that he had. Albon himself had a strong race as well. Minus the incident with Leclerc and being caught in dirty air, I think there was a real possibility of him ending up in podium places. From an overview glance, this team in this season is such an improvement over the last, and years that followed. What JV has managed to do with the team is commendable, with two drivers that are able to challenge each other and a group of trustworthy personnel back in Grove to get the job done, they are ending their weekends on a solid and maximising on what they can *(all without upgrades considering development is going towards the FW48 but if the FW47's performance window maintains and they can keep themselves ahead, then hell yeah)*\n\nOnward to the next few races! These results show promise and I am thrilled to see what else they have in store"", 'Did Sky ever show the bit they filmed with Antonelli showing Ted Kravitz around Bologna?\n\nThey advertised it all weeked long, and kept saying ""coming up after the break"" on Sunday but it never appeared.  Did they ever show it at all?  It doesn\'t seem to be on their youtube channel either!', 'I don’t like how the Leclerc, Albon, Hamilton incident has concluded. Yes Leclerc gave Albon a place back, but it wasn’t the correct place, and it benefited his teammate. \n\nI think once someone else has gone through (in this case Lewis) you should lose the ability to give it back to avoid a penalty. Obviously it wasn’t planned, but now the FIA hasn’t punished Leclerc there will be teams thinking about it in the future.\n\nImagine we get to Abu Dhabi and it’s a winner takes all for the championship between Max and Oscar, and Lando pushes Max off to let Oscar take the lead, then gives Max the place back a lap later. We would all be freaking out but it would be fine within these rules right?', 'Ferrari made the right call not to pit Charles during the SC. The problem was that they overestimated how quickly marshals can move the Merc. The fact that it took them 8 laps to move an undamaged car is absurd. Other tracks can move burned down and crashed cars much quicker, on narrower circuits.', ""As much as how much I love how Monaco is just 6 days away, I feel bad for team Mercedes. Gonna spend the next couple of days having a closer look at what went wrong with Antonelli's car as well as how did Russell finish out of the top 5 also in the broader context of how did he get pushed out by the Ferraris and Albon, happy for them though especially Albon and Williams. This was a pretty good race weekend nonetheless."", 'Not the dull race I feared, but a bit of an odd one. Oscars poor start then choosing to block of George rather than Max (who was far more of a threat to the race win). Safety cars taking out most of the intrigue over the podium fight. Stewards decision over Charles and Albon made no sense, either it’s an acceptable move or it has to be a penalty. You can’t allow pushing someone off, allowing other cars through (especially the offenders teammate) but it’s all good because you gave the place back a few laps later. \n\nThe switch to even softer compounds did lead to some interesting mixups in both qualifying (some on mediums) and the race (mediums dying a bit in the middle of a stint, so some pitted mixing up strategies). I’m not sure the race effects would continue if this happened again (teams would learn to push through) but it did make a normal DRS train race a bit more exciting.']",31,174,0.83,31,172,172,1,5,0.0,1

So I’m cautious optimistic about his chances to fight for the title.', ""It's not 'or', it's 'and'."", 'Translation:\n\n\n> **All signs pointed to victory for McLaren. In the end, Max Verstappen still emerged victorious. Did Red Bull manage to turn things around and bring the wonder car to its knees with its onboard resources?**\n\n> The favorites couldn\'t be clearer. Oscar Piastri on pole position, McLaren fastest in the discipline where Red Bull and Mercedes are most feared. Hot weather and track temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius on Sunday, plus the softest tire compounds Pirelli can offer, all signs pointed to a McLaren victory.\n\n> And yet, in the end, Max Verstappen won. Just like in Suzuka. Although the track and conditions aren\'t comparable, Formula 1\'s farewell performance at Imola told a similar story. Verstappen won the start. This is even more crucial for Red Bull than for McLaren. With a clear track and a clean airflow, the RB21 almost has McLaren qualities.\n\n> Then, with the better-placed car, McLaren gambled with the strategy, just like in Japan. Piastri was brought in for a tire change on lap 13. This committed them to a two-stop race early on. McLaren underestimated two things. The hard tire wasn\'t as good as expected. And Piastri was stuck in traffic longer than expected. Although the Australian had to overtake seven cars in 15 laps, he only lost just under a second to Verstappen. This shows: The speed was there.\n\n> **McLaren loses race at the start.**\nLando Norris was already ten seconds behind after ten laps in the slipstream of George Russell\'s Mercedes when he finally managed to establish his pace. 18 laps later, it was 8.7 seconds. After Verstappen\'s VSC gift, the lead grew to 20 seconds. Norris reduced it to 18.4 seconds before the safety car 18 laps later.\n\n> The neutralization gave Verstappen and Norris a chance for a second tire change, narrowing the gap to zero, but McLaren was unlucky enough to have Piastri on old tires between them. By the time Norris had fought his way past his teammate, the train had finally left the station.\n\n> The bottom line is that McLaren was perhaps a touch faster, but never fast enough. ""The race might have had a different outcome had Oscar won the start,"" admitted team principal Andrea Stella. From then on, McLaren was on the defensive and had the choice to react or take a risk. They chose the risk and lost.\n\n> **That\'s why the heat was good for Red Bull.**\nBut why couldn\'t the McLarens take advantage of the conditions and the tire types available, as was the case in Miami? The track temperature was only 39 degrees Celsius. Yet, winner Piastri beat Red Bull and Mercedes by more than 37 seconds.\n\n> For Stella, the result at Imola was no surprise. ""Suzuka and Jeddah, like Imola, showed that this type of track suits Red Bull and limits our advantage. All tracks feature fast, flowing corners. Imola requires a completely different aerodynamic configuration than Miami. Furthermore, Red Bull made a good step with their upgrades. Nevertheless, we were surprised at the end by how fast and consistent they were.""\n\n> Red Bull technical director Pierre Waché had an explanation for why the heat didn\'t play into McLaren\'s hands on Sunday. ""On certain types of asphalt with certain tire compounds, the tire wear mechanism changes in our favor in hot weather."" The Frenchman declined to elaborate on the tire 101. ""That would give too much away.""\n\n> **Better balance enlarges setup window.**\nRed Bull has improved its much-maligned RB21 with its two-piece upgrade. The new underbody, which was already installed in Miami, delivers more stable downforce. The modified cooling intake optimizes the airflow around the sidepods, the modified rear wishbone fairings to the diffuser, and the new rear brake vents allow for better control of tire temperatures. ""But it will take time until this works as well as it does at McLaren,"" fears Sporting Director Helmut Marko.\n\n> The impact of recent developments was felt by the drivers. The Red Bull no longer changed its balance between turn-in and the apex. The understeer mid-corner disappeared, but the oversteer on the exit remained. But Verstappen can live with that. ""For the first time in a long time, Max hasn\'t complained,"" Marko said with a sigh of relief.\n\n> The champion praised: ""The car was easier to control. This made it easier to manage the tires."" Team principal Christian Horner explained that the improvements to the car expanded the setup window. Friday and Saturday were like night and day. This time, it was possible to find a good car setup and not just a half-baked compromise.\n\n> The decisive factor will be whether Imola, like Suzuka, was just a snapshot in time where the car benefited from favorable conditions or whether it will provide a better platform in the long term. Technical director Waché remains tight-lipped: ""Am I confident now? I don\'t have an answer to that. I was after Suzuka, and then we were beaten by McLaren three times in a row.""', 'i seriously hope this was a real improvement for red bull, it would make the title fight an absolute banger if it was these 3 going at it every race', 'Red Bull were a lot closer but it was Max who really made the difference. I can’t think of a lap 1 first corner move for the lead as good as what Max did yesterday.\xa0', 'Putting it simple: having a better feel for balance, rear end behavior, and brake response probably gives Max the confidence to make the lap 1 move (admittedly, wouldnt put trying regardless past him at all 😉)\n\nThat aside - on this track Redbull and McLaren were pretty much on par - best evidence is the almost non-existent delta between NOR and VER after NOR clearing PIA after the safety car - similar tire age, similar fuel load, similar degree of clean air', 'I think this entire season has had some real intense narratives that were mostly formed in testing and FP sessions that do not seem to fully describe the actual reality we see in competitive sessions; mostly that 1) the McLaren is dominant in the way that RBR or Merc were in their dominant seasons, and that 2) the RBR is an outright slow car.\xa0\n\n\nSeems to me since the start of the season that the actual race results make a lot more sense when we allow for the more moderate view that 1) the McLaren is overall fastest but by a fairly narrow margin, and that 2) the RBR is one of the fastest cars overall and so far the only non-McLaren car with the pace to win races when the setup window/track conditions align.\xa0', ""Passes were surprisingly easy due to the higher than expected tire deg.

This was obscured somewhat by the safety cars, but tire wear presented every team with interesting dilemmas, and the difficulty of the choice was highlighted by how many teams chose different strategies, or split strategies between their drivers. 

Pit stops at Imola are unusually costly, but Pirelli had tire compounds where it was difficult to decide between a one-stop and a two-stop strategy. At first it seemed like the undercut would be massively powerful, only for the mediums to come back. But as the stint went on, Albon (on a one stop) started warning the team they were taking a big risk by running those tires so long, though he was delivered by a timely safety car.

Imola is a track where it's difficult to pass, but the race would have been good even without the safety cars because everyone was worried they were on the wrong strategy, and were making difficult choices at multiple junctures, some of which jumbled up the running order in interesting ways.","['It was an easy one stop race despite the tyres being a step softer than last year.

I just don't like the idea that it gives some teams an advantage, and others a disadvantage. If you want built in drama, make it a rule to run all three tire (tyre) compounds in the race. 

What would you like to see changed?","[""It used to be like this, but it was changed due to:\n\n\\- Now the one who stays out is favored, with closed pits it's the other way around ( Nothing is fixed, just changed)\n\n\\- You might be in pits and the Safety car is out, you will get an advantage\n\n\\- The most important was, if someone had an issue - ie.: Safety car is deployed by crash, one survives with a puncture and the second driver is out. The one with a puncture officially can't enter the pit. \n\nI don't remember when they opened it up, was a good 15+ years ago at least. (Don't quote me on that number). \n\nIt will be more unfair than the current model is."", "">I just don't like the idea that it gives some teams an advantage\n\nAnd you're not fixing that by closing the pits.

You're just changing which groups gets screwed over.\n\nThe undercut in F1 is already generally stronger than the overcut. Making the undercut even stronger is not gonna make for better racing.

That way a car which has spun gives greater visibility. Failing this, just put LEDs on the halo, I think they look great. Especially when many cars are driving in wet conditions and they come towards the camera out of the spray.\n\n- Make the rear rainlights on the rear wing end plates change dependent on flags being shown.

Right now, the V/SC punishes those who just pitted and rewards those who stayed out by giving them less time loss for a tyre change.
