1ody9ve,"Red Bull, Horner wanted to give up on the RB21: the spark over goodbye",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ody9ve/red_bull_horner_wanted_to_give_up_on_the_rb21_the/,2025-10-23, News,"Partial translation by [ThisIsFormu1a1](https://x.com/ThisIsFormu1a1/status/1980918573959877054) on Twitter:

Red Bull's resurgence in the F1 championship with Max Verstappen has been marked by a strategic focus on taking each race weekend as it comes. The RB21's competitiveness has been confirmed progressively, with significant performances in Singapore and Texas.

Initial victories in Monza and Baku were met with skepticism due to track layouts, but subsequent races proved the RB21's capability on diverse circuits. Updates introduced at the Italian Grand Prix brought the car closer to the formidable McLaren MCL39.

Christian Horner's departure from Red Bull was influenced by friction with the team's Austrian leadership and the 'Verstappen clan.' Horner believed resources should be diverted to future projects, doubting the RB21's potential to close the gap with McLaren.

The decision to relieve Horner of his duties was not sudden, as developments for the RB21 were planned well before the summer break. The technical sector, led by Pierre Waché, faced implicit criticism from Horner, who saw no sense in further investment.

Despite Horner's skepticism, Red Bull's technical updates have revitalized the RB21, making it competitive across various circuits. The team's commitment to the current season has paid off, challenging the dominance of McLaren's MCL39.

The renewed competitiveness of the RB21 offers new interpretations of Red Bull's strategy, highlighting the importance of continuous development and adaptation in F1. The team's decision to persist with the RB21 has proven fruitful, defying initial doubts.","[""So the technical team's reasoning is probably that they need to understand the car because they have been struggling for over a year, and therefore putting out updates is the best way to verify whether what you are doing in Milton Keynes is correct?\n\nBecause any betting man would just give up on the championship after being so far behind with a car that has been struggling for over a year. And even with the car doing quite well now, who would have expect McLaren dropping the ball like they have done lately?"", 'This is very interesting given the praise Mekkies has received for his technical inputs with car developments and having a more open discussions with all the parties involved.\n\nHowever that doesn’t take away from Horner given these updates were planned when he was TP and I can understand him wanting to focus on 2026 given the huge investments needed by RB.\n\nLet’s see how this year goes and where Red Bull are next year to really make any judgement.', 'I don’t like the man, but even the fact he was wrong about this doesn’t make his stance unreasonable. This comeback wasn’t exactly a likely outcome', 'What I absolutely hate is that the article spins it just the right way to make people go ""baaah Horner is bad""\n\nBut these updates and technical ideas were already in a pipeline during his leadership.\n\nIt\'s a full team effort and tbh I can\'t blame Horner for at least thinking the RB21 was done for this year.', ""Honestly you can't fault Horner for his thinking. He's been bitten once in such a scenario. The last time there was a reg change around the PU, Red Bull did the same thing. It did lead to the 9 race win streak by Seb, but they were way more behind than expected by the time 2014 rolled around. He likely didn't want to be in the same position again."", ""Except if Max doesn't win the title and Red Bull start next year off the pace... he's been proven right lol"", ""Quite a few interesting lines of thought here.\n\nFor one thing, Horner still might not have been wrong, as the price RB paid for continuing with RB21's development will only become apparent next year. Then again, a reason why they wanted to keep pushing with the current car was reportedly to fully understand where they went wrong so they avoid the same mistakes again, which makes a lot of sense.\n\nAlso, let's just take a note here that out of Newey and Rob Marshall, it was Marshall who able to develop the ideas of the '22/'23 Red Bull into other mighty cars after moving to McLaren. And now Wache seems to have found a way out of the mess at Red Bull. Newey and his career long weakness of forgetting that his cars will have to be driven by human beings looking like the weak link."", 'Feels like a PR attack to diminish Horners influence on the current form ,article is kinda bs  since it was Horner who  gave the green light for these updates months ago.', ""Oh that's some nice old BS right there. Horner was still TP when these updates were being implemented, so he clearly didn't throw everything away and still kept his eye on the next season.\xa0"", ""This doesn't make sense because the Monza floor and Zandvoort front wing would've been developed while Horner was in charge.\n\n\nThis is not to discredit Mekies. Maybe his on-track approach is what RB needed and it's probable that with Horner in charge, those updates wouldn't have resulted in such big improvements.\n\nBut to say Horner gave up on this season, while simultaneously approving two major updates that later worked don't tally together.\n\n\nBy biggest takeaway from all this is that RB needed Newey for his technical leadership to find their way out of the development funk since March 2024. Their setup choices were hit & miss after he left and they just seemed lost. They kept bringing new parts & trying setups but nothing fixed their issues. And somehow Mekies' approach is what they needed.\n\nThe timeline of Newey leaving and RB starting to struggle; then Horner leaving and RB recovering their form is just too convineint to be just a coincidence.""]",1976,309,0.96,1976,5530,5530,10,0,0.0,10

9 (torro rosso year), 4, 1, 1, 6, n/a (covid), 1, 1, 1, 6
