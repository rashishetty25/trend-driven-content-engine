1kkr2e5,Court documents appear to confirm Peter de Putron is Williams' real owner,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kkr2e5/court_documents_appear_to_confirm_peter_de_putron/,2025-05-12, Discussion,"A few years ago, the F1 journalist Joe Saward wrote [an article](https://joesaward.wordpress.com/2022/05/31/green-notebook-from-solarium-beach/) in which he identified Peter de Putron, an extremely reclusive financier and investor, as the ultimate owner of the Williams F1 team. Saward wrote:

>Back in the summer of 2020, when the Williams team was sold to Dorilton Capital, there was much interest and speculation about who was behind the mysterious investment firm. It was based in New York, but was clearly not an American firm. It was identified only as being a private investment office for an unidentified high worth family.

>I got a tip that the buyer was a Jersey-based entrepreneur called Peter de Putron, but no-one in the team would talk about whether these stories were true. De Putron is so reclusive that there does not seem to be a single photograph of him on the Internet, which makes it quite hard to identify him. …

>Anyway, to cut a long story short I am certain that de Putron is the man behind Dorilton – and I’ll not post any pictures of him because he does not want to be famous.

Saward is a divisive character and it seems some people were suspicious as the source of his 'tip', but I recently came across a [court transcript](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2025/2025-ny-slip-op-30605-u.html) which does appear to prove him right. These court documents relate to an [ongoing lawsuit](https://archive.is/97mXe) brought by Williams' former marketing director, Claudia Schwartz, against [James Matthews](https://www.williamsf1.com/team/james-matthews), another financier and Williams board member (and Pippa Middleton's husband, if you're interested in that sort of thing).

Schwartz's lawyers (based on, among things, testimony from Jost Capito, Williams' former team principal), reveal that:

* de Putron approves (or at least approved) all budgets for Williams Grand Prix Engineering
* Capito was told never to use de Putron's name in discussions about Williams, being informed by the board that ""Peter De Putron is in the background and doesn’t want to be known or seen that he’s the owner of Williams""
* Despite this, de Putron is referred to as ""ODL"" (Our Dear Leader) internally
* de Putron is publicly the owner of another Williams-related company, Williams IP Holdings LLC
* The plaintiffs (Dorilton and Williams) tried to prevent de Putron's name being revealed by arguing he is merely “an outside investor” and not the owner

They further conclude that de Putron makes ""all significant decisions” for both Dorilton Capital Management and Williams Grand Prix Engineering.

The court documents are [freely available](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2025/2025-ny-slip-op-30605-u.html) if you want to dive in further.

De Putron himself seems like an interesting and well-connected character with all kinds of links to politicians and various high-flyers. He is the brother in law of Andrea Leadsom, the former UK health minister, and was at Wharton business school with Matthew Savage, the founder of Dorilton.

It should be noted that Dorilton denies de Putron being involved with Williams in any way, despite Jost Capito's testimony.","[""It's been a minute since we've had a genuine mystery man in F1 at such a high level.

1kk8pzy,[AMUS] Is this the explanation for the McLaren mystery?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kk8pzy/amus_is_this_the_explanation_for_the_mclaren/,2025-05-11, News,,"['One thing teams do to fuck with other teams is hide bits to throw off teams and steer them away from what they’re doing. It’s part of the fun and games', 'For those not quite completing how a material can have a “stop sign” at a specific temperature, here’s an example:\n\nYou can’t heat water hotter than 100°C (at atmospheric pressure), because the moment it hits 100°C it turns to water vapor via boiling. \n\nMcLaren may be using a solid that melts at a target temp to do the same thing. The solid inside the brake drum liner stops the tire receiving excess heat from the rim because it’s made of/coated in whatever material they’ve designed to melt instead of heating up beyond the target level. \n\nThere are lots of other technical difficulties to overcome, but maybe this comment simplifies some of the main scientific ideas from the article above.', ""Translation:\n\n> **Everyone is puzzling over the McLaren trick. A student may have found the key to the secret with his doctoral thesis. We explain this ingenious idea that could be used to cool tires.**\n\n> Formula 1 has rarely been so confused. The McLaren MCL39 is a fast racing car, but it's not far behind Red Bull and Mercedes in setting a fast lap. Yet it harbors a secret. It's already apparent during the qualifying laps, especially on tracks that put a lot of strain on the tires. The McLarens don't degrade over the lap because the tires stay within the temperature range.\n\n> In races, the Papaya racers are usually in a different league. They can conserve their tires and thus their lap times at a high level. When the tire temperatures of their rivals begin to rise, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris disappear into the distance with a lead of more than a second per lap. Regardless of the tire type. Here, too, the more the track layout, the asphalt, or the external conditions stress the tires, the greater the McLaren advantage.\n\n> This is a completely new quality of superiority. In the past, the competition searched for the key to why the fastest car was so fast. Now they have to figure out why this McLaren has so much endurance. One thing is clear to everyone after the Miami GP. More downforce and stable car balance may be ingredients in the cocktail, but the real secret lies elsewhere.\n\n> **Everyone looks at the brake ventilation.**\nMcLaren's opponents now know where to look. Photos of the brake ventilation systems are piled up on their desks. Sometimes closed, sometimes open. But they reveal nothing. Things only get interesting when the mechanics work on the extremely complex cooling system. But that's exactly when McLaren employees line up in front of the car like footballers at the free-kick wall, and you can't see anything.\n\n> The question of all questions is why mechanics always behave so suspiciously. That might be the answer. The solution might only be found if one could see what the mechanics are changing, adjusting, replacing, or checking. The regulations regarding brake ventilation are relatively clear. The so-called drum, which encloses the entire assembly and is located directly under the rim, is subject to strict regulations regarding its dimensions. However, the air flow inside and the materials used are free.\n\n> A small clue to solving the mystery may have emerged. It could, but doesn't have to, be the key. Eight years ago, a student researched the use of phase-change materials for his doctoral thesis at McLaren. Martin Buchan is now an aerodynamics engineer. He has now shared his knowledge in a\xa0YouTube video\xa0and drawn his own conclusions.\n\n> **Brakes hot and tires cool.**\nBrake vents have two functions. They are designed to cool the brakes, but keep them hot enough for optimal deceleration. They are also designed to quickly heat the tires via the rims, but then keep them within this temperature window for as long as possible. The challenge lies in balancing these two mutual requirements.\n\n> Even with the most skillful approach, the heat radiated by the brakes and the car will transfer to the tires. Especially during a race. Last year, Red Bull suspected that McLaren was filling its tires with water to keep them cool. The FIA \u200b\u200brefuted the suspicion. McLaren was subjected to several thorough inspections. The result was the same every time: This car is legal.\n\n> So there had to be some ingenious trick keeping the brakes hot and the tires cool. A trick that works without sensors, electronics, actuators, or the use of coolant. In other words, a process that runs passively and follows the laws of physics and chemistry. Presumably, McLaren's brake ducts aren't all that different mechanically from those of competitors.\n\n> **The miraculous heat storage.**\nInside the drum-shaped brake linings, there is usually a second sleeve with fins attached that influence the airflow. A channel runs between the two walls, which determines the temperature that the outer casing radiates onto the wheel rim. This is the case with all cars.\n\n> One could now imagine McLaren shielding this channel towards the inner panel with a very special material. A so-called phase-change material, which is also used in batteries, for example, as a heat storage device. The same requirements apply there as for tires. The temperature should rise quickly, but not exceed a certain target.\n\n> In the case of tires, it would work like this: The dissipated braking heat heats up the tire. According to this theory, McLaren would interrupt this process by having the insulating material change its state of matter, for example, from solid to liquid. During this transition, the temperature remains constant despite further external heat input.\n\n> The temperature in the outer drum triggers the phase change. The material used depends on the temperature at which the stop sign must be set. The amount of phase-change material used determines how long the heat is maintained at the desired level. A clever air distribution system can reverse the cooling direction. The brakes are then cooled to a point where the material has resolidified.\n\n> **Evidence for two-phase theory.**\nAdmittedly, this all sounds a bit otherworldly, but it's at least plausible. There's some evidence to support this. For example, Red Bull's disruptive maneuver with water in the tires. Team employees insist they saw moisture on the inside of McLaren's rims on several occasions. But the likely source wasn't the tire, but the brake drum. Perhaps fluid was sweating out during the phase transition.\n\n> It's also interesting to note that Red Bull complained at last year's Austrian GP that McLaren had been driving with temperature sensors on the brake drums. This is only permitted during free practice. According to Red Bull, McLaren did it at least once during the rest of the weekend. If this is true, it could be interpreted as the engineers trying to find out more about the temperatures inside the fairing during a race.\n\n> It's also noticeable that McLaren often performs aggressive long runs in the third free practice session, leaving the competition far behind. Perhaps they're trying to find out under extreme conditions whether everything is working as planned.\n\n> It's obviously no easy task to get this process working. A lot of development and testing goes into it. It looks like McLaren already tried out a precursor to the system after the 2024 summer break. Starting with the Dutch GP, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have excelled, especially in the second half of the races. The competition was already wondering how the two kept their tires in such good condition.\n\n> Even if rivals already know exactly what McLaren is doing, it's not that easy to copy the trick. Red Bull may already have a theory pointing in this direction. Recently, Max Verstappen has been complaining more and more frequently about mysterious braking problems. When asked whether this was related to tire cooling, team boss Christian Horner gave only monosyllabic answers."", 'This is the cool engineering shit that makes AP Calc worth it.', 'It’s an interesting theory—slush definitely is a useful temperature buffer. I’m somewhat skeptical of the practicalities, however. This is all unsprung weight, and making it heavy should meaningfully impact traction. Can they afford enough buffet material not to saturate over the course of a race?', 'So... Is a heatpipe (Like the ones you see in PC coolers) but at a competitive, fast and more secret level?', ""Interesting read! Very ingeneous. We might never really know if this is the trick to McLaren's success. I hope we will find out someday"", 'Good read! More information provided! It’s more and more likely phase-changing material is the trick. Let’s see how the whole thing develops. Fun time for the F1 tech world! 😄', "">It's also interesting to note that Red Bull complained at last year's Austrian GP that McLaren had been driving with temperature sensors on the brake drums. This is only permitted during free practice. According to Red Bull, McLaren did it at least once during the rest of the weekend. If this is true, it could be interpreted as the engineers trying to find out more about the temperatures inside the fairing during a race.\n\nThis has me a bit puzzled, if this is truly not allowed and they actually did it, how didn't a massive DSQ and sporting penalties follow. Just creating your own testing sessions is easily the biggest advantage you can have in a test deprived time like we are in now?\n\nEither the FIA took a massive shit on integrity or it's not true imo""]",1457,253,0.97,1457,5800,5800,16,1,0.0,16

FORTY FUCKING DOLLARS???', 'I’ve been reading through most of the Cadillac-related threads on this sub and I’ve noticed there seems to be a lot of negative sentiment about the team here already. And not just negative in terms of their expected performance (which is entirely valid), but a lot that comes off as genuine dislike or distaste. \n\nWhere does this sentiment come from? I ask this genuinely, as I’m not familiar enough with the sport to get some of the nuances that may be at play here.', 'Doritos should sponsor Williams... picturing a Cool Ranch livery', 'another week, another chance for a williams podium', 'Why the hate against Norris ?', 'I find it much easier to name drivers who are overrated rather than underrated. But it also depends on who you’re asking. For example, I think the folk that frequent these threads underrate Hakkinen a bit but they don’t underrate him anywhere near as much as the general consensus overrates him. I myself used to overrate him a fair bit, even up until quite recently. Then you have drivers like Montoya who are simultaneously overrated and underrated; you have a crowd that thinks he should’ve been a world champion and a crowd that think he was a myth because of how Raikkonen thumped him. In reality, he was a much more erratic and unlucky in 2001 and at McLaren than he was in other years, but at his best he was not a world beater or anything.\n\nThe most obvious example of a driver where the consensus clearly underrates him is Keke Rosberg. I have not seen back his career in great detail but I know enough to say that people just don’t understand the circumstances of his title triumph; F1 was effectively a two-tier formula at times with the turbos miles ahead of the normally aspirated cars but suffering much worse reliability. Still, Keke was very often first or second of those in normally aspirated cars, winning at Dijon, taking pole at Brands but being thwarted by mechanical issues and pulling off a minor miracle at Zandvoort where the turbos had arguably their biggest advantage all year, but Keke kept them honest and finished a minute ahead of Lauda in the next normally aspirated car. It was a year where consistency really counted and Keke ticked that box better than anyone.\n\nFrom there, Keke went on to convincingly beat Laffite (who might have been past his best, but if so, was still no joke) and then Mansell in 85, setting the famous record pole lap at Silverstone in the process. I understand he underperformed in 86 alongside Prost but still saved one of his best performances for last, when he led Prost and the Williamses by half a minute at Adelaide only to suffer tyre failure. Despite all that, Keke is almost universally remembered as the ‘one win champion’, which to me is completely unfair.', ""Eddie Irvine  \nHe was a good driver with very good pace. He struggled to keep the Ferrari under control in 1996 and at times in 1997, but that's about it. In 1997, 1998, and 1999, he was one of the best drivers on the grid not named Michael Schumacher. That doesn't exactly make him an all-time great, but he was good and better than drivers like Bottas or Hulkenberg (and much better than Damon Hill), while nearly all discourse around him would indicate Irvine to be embarrassingly bad. Overall, he is very similar to Montoya. The model rates him 73 (77).\n\nGerhard Berger  \nNot nearly as egregious of an example as Irvine, but in a similar vein, he often gets put aside as a weak number 2 driver. Berger was pretty quick, being on the same level as Piquet and Mansell pace-wise (or Ricciardo and Rosberg more recently), and put together some really good seasons in the early 90s. The model rates him 79 (82).\n\nKeke Rosberg  \nPossibly the most falsely represented driver of all time. At least he usually gets recognized by anyone who is knowledgeable or actually takes their time to do research, which can't be said about the others. Although a bit circumstantial (due to Villeneuve's death), there was a brief period in F1 history (~ 1982-1984) where Keke was THE best driver on the grid, before Prost and Senna fully took over. He isn't in that tier, but he was great akin to Vettel or Raikkonen. The model rates him 84 (86).\n\nAlan Jones  \nI'm actually not 100% sure what the consensus on Jones is, but since he is never really mentioned, that is already less than he deserves. In his prime (1978-1981), only Gilles Villeneuve was clearly better than him, with his title winning campaign in 1980 clearly being his worst season of the run. He could have and should have done better in 1981, but he was still by far the best title contender that year; he was just extremely unlucky. He and Keke should be at the top of any Williams drivers list, not Mansell. The model rates him 81 (85).\n\nRonnie Peterson  \nPeople know he was quick, and most people know he's probably one of the best to never win a title, but that still undersells Peterson so much. Ronnie Peterson was one of the most naturally gifted, quickest drivers of all time. There are no 10 drivers that would've beaten him over a race distance given a reliable and equal car. His main drawback was his inability to do development or set-up work. As it is often with drivers of that caliber, he just drove around the issues and went quick no matter what. The model rates him 90 (92)."", ""John Watson - unbelievably quick driver in the races. Mediocre speed in qualifying. He's the Jenson Button of his era (minus a WDC), because despite his limitations, he still managed to be highly competitive and beat world champion team mates. \n\nElio de Angelis - completely smashed Mario Andretti and Nigel Mansell at Lotus over a 5 year period. People underrate him generally due to his lack of success compared to these two team mates, but I get the sense it's also because his last season in F1 was only alright and not particularly great, but that should not erase what came before.\n\nKeke Rosberg - in a similar vein, he ran world champion Fittipaldi close and easily beat Mansell in the same car. There's a narrative that he won the 1982 championship due to luck, which has spread like a rash in the F1 community. But also, his last season in F1 wasn't amazing and he was beaten badly by Prost who was at the peak of his powers, which all serve to underrate him. However, the narrative is unfair and 1986 should not erase what came before. Keke's results against his team mates speak for themselves . He's also one of those guys you have to watch drive to truly appreciate. He had a beautiful and aggressive style.\n\nI would rate the preceding three above Mansell & Piquet any day.\n\nEddie Irvine - it's amazing how underrated he is, even by the same people who think Schumacher was the best driver by a mile in the 90s. When you look at Irvine's team mate record, it's actually quite stellar. He virtually always beat his team mate, usually significantly so, unless his team mate happened to be named Schumacher. Yet it's his period against Schumacher that make people underrate him. He was clearly a better driver than Coulthard in my view.\n\nHeinz Harald Frentzen - another driver who always beat his team mates, except Villeneuve, and it's that stint that's always unfairly focused on. Even though it was pretty clear that he had left his 1997 form behind, and Villeneuve was one of the best drivers in the field at the time, he still gets underrated because of his Williams years, particularly 1997.""]",8,37,0.79,8,25,25,0,5,0.0,0
