But McLaren had to defend against George Russell in the Mercedes.  \n  \nMcLaren also believes in the George WDC run. 🙏', 'Translation and full article:\n\n> McLaren\'s dominance has been broken thanks to Max Verstappen\'s victory at the Japanese Grand Prix. How did the world champion\'s success come about, and what role did the asphalt play? We answer the most important questions about the race in Suzuka.\n\n> **What was the significance of qualifying?**\nThe celebrations at Red Bull were already loud after the time trial on Saturday (April 5). Max Verstappen had put the RB21 on pole position thanks to his fabulous lap. McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were left empty-handed. What no one could have predicted was that Saturday\'s result would also be the result on Sunday. All experts had assumed that the McLarens would better exploit their strengths in a dry race due to less tire wear.\n\n> But that didn\'t happen. Team principal Christian Horner summed it up after the Grand Prix: ""I can\'t remember any overtaking maneuvers. Almost everyone finished in their starting position. It was a flat-out race from the first to the last lap."" The Englishman praised his star driver: ""That was one of the best weekends of his career.""\n\n> Another crucial factor was that, with very few exceptions, he never allowed his pursuer, Norris, into the DRS window. Horner knew the reason: ""He was particularly strong at the exit of the chicane before the start and finish. He had already secured pole position there yesterday.""\n\n> On Friday\'s practice session (April 4), Red Bull was still in the woods. Sporting director Helmut Marko called it a ""bad car."" But massive setup changes paid off. The car hit the window just in time for Q3. From that moment on, the world champion delivered. Marko enthused: ""He parried all the attacks, was on the limit for 53 laps, and didn\'t make a single mistake.""\n\n> The only time things got tense was when Verstappen and Norris changed tires at the same time on lap 21. Red Bull\'s pit stop took longer than McLaren\'s. Verstappen and Norris exited the pit lane almost level with each other. While accelerating, Norris tried to overtake, but Verstappen didn\'t give in, and Norris briefly skidded through the grass.\n\n> The Englishman immediately complained over the radio, and Verstappen countered: ""He drove into the grass of his own accord."" The stewards did not initiate an investigation. After the race, Norris also had a different opinion, at least publicly: ""I think that\'s racing. And Max would have been the last driver to make way voluntarily anyway.""\n\n> Christian Horner explained why Verstappen\'s stop took too long: ""We wanted to adjust something on the front wing. But that didn\'t work and cost time. It also caused more understeer.""\n\n> **Why did McLaren bring in Piastri first?**\nRed Bull was fortunate that McLaren didn\'t attempt the undercut with Norris. Instead of pitting the second-placed driver first, Piastri was given the hard tire on lap 20. From that moment on, Red Bull knew that Norris would be pitting a lap later and ordered their driver to pit as well. At first glance, it would have made more sense to favor Norris in the fight for victory. But McLaren had to defend against George Russell in the Mercedes.\n\n> The Englishman had already pitted on lap 19. Mercedes calculated that the undercut added 1.5 seconds per lap when switching from the medium to the hard rubber. Piastri also had difficulties with the medium compound. ""I was already within the window to stop and also had some graining on the front tires. We did that to cover the guys behind me.""\n\n> **Why were there so few overtaking maneuvers?**\nWhile Verstappen\'s victory puts him just one point behind championship leader Norris, McLaren was unhappy despite finishing second and third. Team principal Andrea Stella was annoyed by the fact that they had laid new asphalt in the first sector and from the chicane exit at Suzuka. Combined with the hardest tire set available, which Pirelli had brought to Suzuka, there was hardly any tire wear. ""It was a race with almost no tire degradation, and that hurt us because we couldn\'t play to our strengths in that area,"" Stella explained.\n\n> Sauber veteran Beat Zehnder took a different view. ""I wouldn\'t say it should be blamed solely on the new asphalt. We also had the hardest tire compounds available here."" The Swiss driver can imagine that results like those in Suzuka will lead to a different approach from the tire supplier. ""Perhaps Pirelli will bring the softer compounds to Japan next year.\n\n> Zehnder also provided another reason for the few place swaps: ""When you look at how close the field is, overtaking maneuvers become almost impossible. After ten laps, the entire field was only 17 seconds apart."" The overtaking gap is simply too small. The Mercedes strategists spoke of a 1.2-second gap needed to overtake.\n\n> **Why didn\'t McLaren swap places?**\nThe race was like a procession. McLaren could have spiced things up a bit, though. Even in the first stint, Oscar Piastri seemed a bit faster than his teammate Lando Norris after the initial phase. However, there was no exchange of positions.\n\n> Even towards the end of the race, it seemed as if Piastri could set a faster pace than Norris. The Australian therefore asked on the radio if he could be allowed to pass so he could try to attack Max Verstappen.\n\n> McLaren decided against it. Team principal Andrea Stella explained: ""Oscar was barely faster. That wouldn\'t have made any difference. As soon as the gap was within a second, the turbulence from the dirty air was too great. The same would have happened to Oscar."" Red Bull Sport Director Helmut Marko said mischievously: ""We would have swapped. But McLaren has the Papaya Rules, and they\'re their own rules.""\n\n> **What was going on at Ferrari and Mercedes?**\nUntil qualifying, George Russell had been considered McLaren\'s main challenger. But starting fifth, his race was essentially lost. He couldn\'t get past Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari. The aforementioned undercut didn\'t work. Russell ran into Yuki Tsunoda in traffic. Leclerc controlled his opponent after the only stop. Russell\'s teammate, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, finally closed in on the team leader. This was due to the long first stint on the medium tires. The Italian was then able to take advantage of the significantly fresher rubber.\n\n> Lewis Hamilton crossed the finish line in seventh place. The record winner had started on the hard tires. Ferrari team principal Frédéric Vasseur explained the reason: ""It was due to the starting position. Lewis was only eighth. We didn\'t want to send both drivers into the race with the same strategy.""\n\n> The Frenchman was once again forced to face critical questions after an average weekend. Ferrari is too far behind its rivals. ""We\'re missing two to three tenths of a second in qualifying. In the race, it\'s even more. We\'re talking about three to four tenths."" However, the mixed start to the season hasn\'t led Vasseur to resort to impulsiveness: ""We don\'t have to and won\'t change our approach from last year."" However, he held out hope for a miracle: ""You\'ll never improve by three to four tenths in one fell swoop.""', '*I curse the asphalt down in Suzuka*', ""Bringing Lando in on the same lap as Max was such a wasted opportunity. They should've pitted him first and try the undercut, or go long like Antonelli did. If Oscar got in the way they could swap places like they did in Hungary."", ""The asphalt thing is pretty interesting because that was my theory on why China and Japan were more difficult for McLaren, it's not just because of dirty air (since in Zandvoort or Baku last year McLaren was able to pass even with dirty air) although that played a part still. McLaren seems to only pull out big advantages at the end of stints where the tires are falling off a bit. Both China and Japan had resurfaced tracks and a relatively cool race day with  rain falling beforehand making the track too friendly on the tires for that fall off to even happen.\n\nSo far, McLaren was only able to pull a pace advantage at the very end in China (although Lando's brake issues prevented something interesting), and right at the tail end of the medium stint in Japan. And that's because there's so little tire deg that McLaren's advantage doesn't really form. I also have a theory that Lando seems to be able to run better at the end of stints when tyres are beginning to fall off, and not having that advantage also neuters his driving style more which is friendlier on the rear tyres."", 'So then Red Bull says: ""Kiss my asphalt""', 'Why was Suzuka even repaved in the first place?

Red Bull seemed invincible after 2023 too and their car seemed to have no weakness other than Perez, but it all switched in 2024.

Not ideal, but also not as bad as the first changes when Liberty took over from Bernie, when we had literally unreadable fonts and such.\n\nThe other, I suspect, is that they have decided to remove a lot of information from the broadcast. A few guesses as for why. For one thing, they might be trying to mystify things up to make the sport seem less predictable. This may sound stupid (and in my opinion, is stupid), but there is context for this. For example, they once tried to show the minisectors as yellow/green/purple in qualifying, not just the sectors. This was immediately removed after complaints about how it took all the suspense out.

Now that the dust has settled in Suzuka, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""I have to say - I do think people are overreacting a bit coming off of this race in regards to these regs. I think the reasons why we've had such an astoundingly tedious race (even by Suzuka standards) is a combination of factors such as - late track resurfacing that caught up Pirelli and their tyre choices off guard, and the weather that was too dull, to put it simply (cool, but not damp or cool enough to make it interesting, like making cars slide all over the place, but neither was it warm enough to induce serious tyre wear). Having said that - no changes to the regs did make it so the team's were completely unobstructed from adding elements and making changes to their cars that would make them even harder to follow, but I do think this was an unfortunate exaggeration of the problem. On top of that - Pirelli cannot be completely absolved of the blame here. Their task is horrible, difficult, and the combination of those words, yes, but fact of the matter is - Hard is just an op tyre now, and that shouldn't be the case."", 'RBR still has the best on track operations. They are the team who makes the changes between Friday and Saturday work the most.', ""Ah, Suzuka. Probably the best circuit in the world, and one I plan to go to next year, but yesterday was absolutely dull.\n\nOn one hand, I don't mind there being races like that. The 2010 season is one of my all time favourites but it did also feature several dull races. I think what made yesterday frustrating was the fact that across the whole grid, very little happened. The race between the front three was pretty much the only battle across the grid, and even then Norris never got close enough to even get DRS. Max won the race on Saturday, and the overall performance from him was probably his best ever. I know people rank CoTA 2021 as his finest race but I think this was better overall.\n\nThe main worry I've got for the season is Pirelli. It's a small sample size but so far the Hard tyre in both China and Japan was absolutely incredible. Zero deg, zero graining and easily the outright fastest race tyre. As a result, there is only one strategic option available (M-H). Pirelli either need to be a bit braver and make all tyres softer, or where possible the H needs to be a step harder so that it is truly slow and a two stop becomes a better strategy. Ideally the hard should be between 1.5-2s slower than the Medium. \n\nOddly, last year at Suzuka tyre deg was a really issue and we saw a mixture of 1,2 and 3 pit stops across the grid. Perhaps the resurfacing has made the track too easy on the tyres? Likewise, the cold weather probably helped. A track as brutal as Suzuka should not be an easy one stop imo."", 'Hirakawa going from FP1 in an Alpine to changing teams and doing FP1 in a Haas within a week is insane and I’m totally here for it', ""Well that was a bit of a dull race. I did enjoy the tension from the top three basically being close together the whole race. With Max being the one in front though, I wasn't really expecting him to make a mistake. After the pitstops I didn't really think McLaren could win the race, unless Max' tyres would've fallen off massively.\n\nThe biggest issue with this race was that the resurfaced part of the track meant that there was a lot less tyre degradation than expected. It was also quite cool. I don't remember who said it, but on Friday during practice apparently there was a lot more deg. Contrary to some people I saw yesterday, I don't really blame Pirelli. Last season they brought the correct tyre range in Japan and we had the two stop. They simply can't account for everything, they don't know how much deg the resurfacing will bring, they can't control the weather.\n\nMaybe a bit of a weird opinion but I'm kind of glad that the TV director missed the pit exit shenanigans by their stupid decision to switch to Leclercs pitstop. It was the only thing that brought some tention because we missed what actually happened. Meanwhile if we'd been with Max and Lando the whole time, we wouldn't even have had the tention of 'did Max do something?'. We would have just seen Lando drive himself into the grass the first time around. And that would be it, nothing Max did wrong, just a bit silly from Lando."", 'It will be interesting to see McLarens advantage at much hotter tracks considering we’ve had colder weather during the first 3 races. We will see if anyone can get near them in Bahrain and Jeddah where the weather is going to be much hotter.', ""Here's my take about how McLaren handled this race.\n\nMcLaren didn't want to risk undercutting Oscar past Lando and then have to handle the resulting situation afterwards, even if it meant handicapping themselves in the battle for the win.\n\nLando had a substantial gap to Charles and George, so he could've easily extended for multiple laps, and get some sort of tyre delta to Max.\n\nObviously getting the biggest possible delta to Max would mean Oscar undercutting Lando. Which can definitely result in a complicated situation later.\n\nIf the new tyre delta wasn't enough and Lando can't catch back up, he'd be annoyed at losing second due to being undercut by his own team. If Lando does catch back up at a time when Oscar is 1 second behind Max, Lando would want the position back and Oscar would be miffed at being asked to let Lando through when he himself is right behind the leader and pushing for the win. Even if one of their drivers did go on and pass Max, the other would leave the race disappointed and wanting explanations.\n\nThey intentionally went extremely conservative in an attempt to keep both drivers happy. That also gave Max an easier path to win this race. He still would've won regardless considering the lack of tyre wear and how difficult it was to overtake, but splitting strategies could've made him and Red Bull work for it a bit more.\n\nI don't think this conservative approach is sustainable long-term. Remember that Max nearly won in Melbourne when the McLaren duo were substantially ahead of the rest pace wise. If McLaren even give Max an inch, he will absolutely take it. Either McLaren need to show complete dominance and have a car that wins 75% of the races, or they'll have to make tough decisions soon if they are to win the WDC."", 'Geez, with the way people have been talking about McLaren, you would have assumed that the team ordered a mass expulsion on their families with poisonous gas. I cannot believe there is a squabble going on when it is evident that not swapping / not asking Norris to make way for Piastri is the right call at the moment\n\n*""Piastri had better pace. Why didn\'t he let him through?""* If he couldn\'t pass Norris with said better pace, he is not passing Verstappen anytime soon as well\n\n*""But they could have at least attempted to swap. Why did they not take the risk?""* Because there is an equally big risk that it will be all for nothing. You would not only extend Verstappen\'s gap from P2, but you would cut down Leclerc\'s gap to P3. Passing was difficult in this race, but why even give podium places up for a move that will prove nothing in the long run? \n\n*""Swap back then""*. ""Yo, Oscar, that move didn\'t work. Womp womp womp. Why don\'t you give that place back to Lando for a second, ey? Restore the order. Think of our Monday meetings"" **""Heeeeyy, Lando.... it did not work haha. Um, mea culpa, amiright? So Oscar will give you back the position.""**  Sounds familiar? \n\n*""They are risk-averse. They are not ballsy enough. How can anyone win championships this way? Bottlejobs""* Had the swap occurred, McLaren would have extended their gap in the WCC, but this significantly hampers Norris\'s chance *(not by merit, but by team orders)* in the standings. He would have tied with Piastri, and Verstappen would have closed the gap immensely over there. It is also not worth pissing off two equally skilled drivers this way by placing a move of distrust. There was too much on the line for them to gamble\n\nAnd I thought the consensus around McLaren was the fact team orders were placed around Hungary 2024, on the final Sprint races last year and Australia 2025 and how bad Papaya Rules were and how McLaren should let their drivers race? Now, these people want team orders in? What is it that you people want, exactly? \n\nYou can make a case that McLaren made blunders this weekend, and I\'d agree to an extent, but this wasn\'t one of them', ""Good enough performance from Tsunoda and Hamilton, gaining places in that procession.  Antonelli and Hadjar gave solid performances, the future's looking interesting."", ""Wake me up when something happens.\n\nIt was telling to see the 'quali top 10' next to the 'race top 10' and see that the only position change was ~~Kimi A~~ Hadjar   (but still, Go New Kimi!).\n\nHopefully the racing gets better or the weather gets worse.""]",17,56,0.9,17,55,55,3,25,0.010000000000000009,3

Looking at the results of 2012 and the second half of 2024, Massa and Perez were pumping out fairly similar results. Is out-of-prime Massa still a lot better than 2024 Perez? Maybe the F2012, and RB21/20 aren't THAT bad but the lack of results just came from the fact that the second driver is either washed (Massa, Perez) or too young (Lawson, Tsunoda)?

On another note, if Max drags this car to at least P2 in the WDC standings, would this be on par with Alonso's 2012 performance?","['The F2012 is not as bad as people claim. Yes it was terrible the first couple of races, but the first set of upgrades made it far moe driveable. In terms of race pace it was good, not the fastetst but mot as far off as people think, and it’s reliability was top notch, the only major weakness was in qualifying trim.', 'Let’s see few more races with RB21 first', 'Round 3 of 24.', 'It’s been 3 races', 'Both of these narratives are created to dickride the driver in question.\n\nNeither car was bad. Not the best on the field, sure, but certainly a top car.', 'I think this Is a an effect of the ""narratives"" because in that time Alonso/Verstappen were/are considered the best driver, i think people do that to ""create the gap"",\n\nyou know if i say ""Yesterday in Suzuka Verstappen won the race in a car slightly slower than the McLaren, probably this weekend It showed that McLaren isn\'t dominant , if you qualify ahead and with the right strategy you can win"" It doesn\'t sound that good, \nif instead i say "" incredible... Max... Wow... With a car that Is argubly slower than the junior team, this Is the proof that the driver counts more than anything else in F1"" It sounds like he Is some sort of magic god\n\nBoth cars are actually pretty decent, massa in the 2nd half of 2012 scored around the same points as Alonso, probably Ferrari \'s strenght was the fact that redbull and McLaren were very fragile, for example, in Valencia Vettel retired from the lead and gave the win to Alonso, the same thing happened like 3-4 times to Hamilton \n\nThe redbull car this year Is a strange one, the car isn\'t ""great"" , but the car Is strong if you drive with a specific driving style, the same one that max has, McLaren\'s strenght Is not so much speed, but tire wear, and yesterday was such a weird race, monaco 2.0 , and I think the problem Is that we expected a more normal race, so everyone kind of stayed where they were, i have this strange feeling that even if max started 2nd behind Norris he might have had a chance to win, or at least finish 2nd anyway , because redbull would have probably  tried something, McLaren had a bit more pace, but not a lot, \n \nIn Australia max dropped off after 15-20 Laps , at the start he was saying with them, until the tire deg, that Is probably what could have happened, but i think if we try to analise yesterday It\'s almost impossible, because the conditions and just the lack of overtaking  was so unusual, even more than normal', ""The 2012 Ferrari was on average the 3rd fastest car probably, sometimes a bit higher, sometimes a bit lower. \n\nCurrently the RB21 is tracking pretty similiar I'd say. But its only been 3 races."", 'I love how people now keep saying 2012 was a great car. But actual data shows that it was 4th fastest car. Average gap to pole for F2012 was 7 tenths\n\n\nTo answer your question Ferrari was worse in terms of pace relative to the rest but at least McLaren back then was a disaster operationally and RBR had 2 mechanical problems\n\n\nAlonso was super consistent and had to pull magical performances to keep in the title fight. Max is currently doing the same so if he keeps doing it then I agree it would be very similar to 2012', ""Every year the F2012 became slower, it started as the third fastest car that year, and now I see people saying it's 5th or even 8th fastest in 2012. In the near future maybe they would claim it's the 12th fastest car,  and is 1s slower than f4.""]",0,30,0.29,0,27,27,0,1,-0.030000000000000027,0

He did alright."", 'Gonna echo some of the other comments here and go a bit stronger: calling it a disappointing start given the actual context of the situation is pretty ridiculous and drama baity.', ""Going bit of a tangent.

I wish if tyre could just operate in a flat operating window.\n\nI know it's a skill in it's own, but still."", 'Single run in Q2 with red flags was not ideal.', 'I mean, was it disappointing?\n\nHe messed up qualifying which ultimately can’t happen but he showed more speed than Checo and obviously Liam.\n\nThe run plan was obviously questionable in qualifying, but the fact that RB made that decision leads me to believe that they were impressed by his speed overall', 'It was a good start. Hopefully next race will be a better chance to see some racecraft. This race was more of a procession unfortunately.', ""After the shitshow that was this weekend, I think he did pretty good. He has room to grow after this, which is the most important thing.
