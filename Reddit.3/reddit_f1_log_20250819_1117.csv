That’s mostly when LMP1s peaked and F1 hadn’t developed the crazy aerodynamics we saw from 2018 onwards. \n\nI don’t think there’s a way to fully compare an LMP1 to an F1 car, mainly because qualifying isn’t important in endurance racing and the cars are setup and driven in a particular way, different to non-endurance cars.', 'What do you mean by \'current gen\' LMP1?

1muex4h,Let's dissect the horrendous 2016 Elimination Qualifying system,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1muex4h/lets_dissect_the_horrendous_2016_elimination/,2025-08-19, Discussion,"Possibly the biggest blunder in F1 qualifying has got to be this terrible attempt to make qualifying more exciting. I'm all for coming up with new ideas, but it only took one attempt for everyone to realise that the new system was garbage. We're fast approaching the 10th anniversary of this farce, so I decided to look back on this horrible HORRIBLE qualifying format.

For those of you who forgot, how it worked was that after the first five minutes of the session, a car would be eliminated after every ninety seconds, until only one car remains who would then receive pole position.

**What Formula One were expecting to come out of this:**

* They clearly wanted this format to work as a pass the parcel/ticking time bomb system where cars were constantly on the edge, trying to set new fastest lap times in order to avoid being the next car to be eliminated.
* They were hoping for massive OMG moments where Lewis Hamilton locked up into the first corner, and the clock is ticking down, he has to set a quicker lap time quick or else he's going to get eliminated in P17

**What actually happened:**

* There was no pass the parcel tension because the teams that started at the bottom, stayed at the bottom.
* Cars were perfectly fine to just stay in the garage because they were either contempt with their position on the grid, or because they knew they were going to get eliminated anyway.
* Pole position was decided long before the session actually ended, as there were no cars on track in the last few minutes.

**Why did this happen:**

* F1 cars especially during this time were only really designed for one glory lap, meaning that they were incapable of setting fastest lap after fastest lap.
* Once the cars were getting eliminated, there wasn't enough time for the other drivers in danger to get onto the track and set a fastest time, so what's the point in going out.
* Because the drivers in danger weren't going out, the drivers further up the timing grid weren't in any danger of getting eliminated, so there weren't any incentives for them to go out either.
* Because Mercedes were so strong, Ferrari knew they weren't going to beat them, so when qualifying reached the final four, what reason was there to send the drivers out. They weren't going to beat Mercedes, and nobody was going to overtake them for the second row, because they were all out.
* Likewise, once Mercedes were guaranteed for P1 and P2, they had no reason to hit the track either.

All these different factors meant that the qualifying was quickly scrapped, which is probably for the best, as this system had even more flaws that we never got to see with the system.

* Q1 and Q2 in Australia were rather chaotic, but over time, the engineers would've better understood the system, and they would've ended up just like the disastrous Q3.
* Even if Lewis Hamilton made a major error in Q2 which put him in P8 at the end of his run, because drivers were being eliminated every three minutes, there would be less cars on track that could possibly overtake him, which in turn would big qualifying upsets even less likely to happen.
* Because eliminations occur once the clock reaches zero, unless a driver in danger of being eliminated is super close to the finish line anyway, you're almost never going to have an instance of a qualifying session being decided by the end of it.

So qualifying was a disaster, but was it always destined to be? Was Formula One's vision of a ticking time bomb/pass the parcel system ever going to be good? I started to think about the possibilities:

* First of all, you would have to ban cars from sitting in the pits, which they would do if there was no danger of them being eliminated.
* Because of this, the cars will need to be fuelled up for full distance, and will need tyres that don't degrade anywhere near as much as the Pirelli rubber. Son now all the cars are on track at all times, but will this still be enough?
* The next problem that has to be tackled is actually getting the cars to push at all times. This system is supposed to be encouraging drivers to be setting fastest laps all the time, but Mercedes were so much better than everyone else in 2016. Why wouldn't they set one massive lap right at the beginning, and then just coast the next few laps whilst the rest of the slower cars get eliminated one by one.
* The only way to solve this is by having the drivers getting eliminated after every lap or so, and having the times getting reset after each elimination. Then the drivers will need to be constantly pushing at all times, right?
* All these changes are needed to get the ticking time bomb system F1 was pushing for to work, however because of this, the cars are essentially being fuelled up for a standard F1 race stint, so it's not unreasonable to presume that the cars that will be quickest through my proposals, are the ones that have the strongest race pace.
* This will result in the starting grid for the race being in the order of which cars have the fastest racing pace as oppose to one lap pace, which would then increase the likelihood of the main race itself being boring with little to no overtaking, due to the cars being fastest on race pace already being at the front of the grid.

So in conclusion, the elimination qualifying format was always doomed for failure, and there was about zero chance of it ever being better than the one it replaced. I understand that why people like the idea of the ticking time bomb that needs to be passed on, but it just doesn't work for F1.","['I was in the crowd in Melbourne that day. I remember the boos as the drivers were all out of their cars with several minutes of qualifying still on the clock. Me and some other autograph hunters saw Johhny Herbert later in the day who asked us what we thought of it all and then said ""some of these people in F1 aren\'t as clever as they think they are"". I\'m glad elimination qualifying only lasted two GPs.', ""Yeah absolute garbage, less safe and just wasn't good to watch, I think the current format is basically perfect but I would have them use every tyre compound, hards in Q1, mediums in Q2 and softs in Q3 so it keeps getting quicker"", 'Like you said, I vaguely remember some fuckups in Australia until everyone was familiar with it. Then the flaws quickly showed themselves.', ""Man, this was a disaster. A proper 'designed by committee' format that no one wanted. So glad they abandoned this mess pretty much immediately.\n\nNot quite as bad as the brief 2005 Quali format (where Quali on Saturday was followed by a second session on Sunday with aggregate timings deciding the grid), but not far off it."", 'I have not forgotten!', 'Current system is the best there has been. It’s fair and it works. Mostly though we see cars constantly at their fastest with fresh rubber for one insane push lap. Don’t want to see them full of fuel or with long lasting slow tires either.', 'Honestly though, I do wonder if it would work better today with how much closer the cars are to each other. Although I think it would only be as exciting as Q1 is currently - I can’t see how it’d be more interesting. And that is best case scenario where there’s massive track evolution or something like that which is forcing people to go out and potentially flop their one chance to avoid a knock out.', 'That was indeed stupid. What I think might be worth a shot is for Q3 to be decided over a one lap shoot-out format. I think it might bring something different to the table. Sometimes it will also throw up a different grid due to weather.', ""It's beneficial they tried something new and then ditched it right away when it flopped. We got the current system because of that, it is good and doesn't need to change.""]",22,22,0.79,22,18,18,22,22,0.79,22
