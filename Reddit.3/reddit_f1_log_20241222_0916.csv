1hj6lwe,What makes a race exciting?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hj6lwe/what_makes_a_race_exciting/,2024-12-21, Discussion,"Hey guys, for a little personal data science project I'm trying to determine, based entirely on statistics, which races are the most exciting of all time. 

I'm doing this by assigning scores to things such as number of overtakes, number of safety cars, number of DNFs etc. and ranking them based on these scores. 

So my question to the F1 community is: What do you feel makes for an exciting, interesting race? 

It should be something that can be quantified like the stats I mentioned, so stuff like the atmosphere at the track or the celebrities present don't make for great data. Let me know what you think!","['Jeopardy. It doesn’t matter if the eventual victor started on pole and lead every lap. What matters is how they get to the chequered flag first. If they scoot up the road by 30s and there’s no chance of them losing, there’s no excitement. If however they are under pressure lap after lap, then you have jeopardy. I’m not sure how you measure that.', 'Rain', 'safety cars for sure. also number of accidents/pileups in the opening corner/lap\n\npunctures/engine failures/bad pitstops', 'as FOM are now noticing, ""excitement"" isn\'t something that can be just measured with quantifiable factors. They tried the ""as many overtakes as possible"" angle then the overtakes got boring, then the ""super fucking quick cars"" and the races got even more boring\n\n  \nhow exciting a race is is based on vibes and vibes alone', ""Needs to be a sense that the win, specifically, is up in the air. Max driving 45 seconds off into the distance is of course an absolute driving clinic but it does not make for exciting races.\n\nGood battles over 5th are fine imo, but really the win needs to be contested, whether that's on track or through strategy calls"", 'I think in General, unexpected Changes have the biggest influence. Nowadays Teams can calculate very precisely how fast the car will Go and so on, but it gets chaotic when unexpected Events Happen. This can bei weather Changes (rain, drying track etc) but also safety Cars from Crashes.', ""when a driver who's usually in q3 is out in q1 and has a chance to show their overtaking skills"", 'Last minute strategy', 'Another variable I\'d add is some way of measuring the ""upset"". I.e if different people win, it\'s automatically more interesting.\n\nAlso an easy one to statistically generate I\'d assume, is one I\'d recommend adding: total time the difference on track between 1st and 2nd is under 2s.\n\nId also add something like ""is 1st currently not the fastest on track"", as that ""hunt"" from someone behind is often exciting.\n\nAlso, I did a project very similar to this (just a different sport and obiective) back when I was at uni, so if you want any help feel free to DM me. Was a lot of fun tbh, but the major issue I can see you have is that you don\'t have ""true values"" for how interesting the races objectively were, so build models around. Will be fascinating to see how you solve that!']",56,138,0.75,56,813,813,-2,0,-0.010000000000000009,-2

But we have contracts with Gasly, Doohan and Aron for next season. If there was an opportunity to get Colapinto for 2026, you have to think about it.

Then the price rises and suddenly we're talking about 20 or 30 million dollars. The choice today is much greater than it used to be.

The fact that he doesn’t have a drive for 2025 just shows how much F1 is about politics. He may be a rookie and may have done costly mistakes but he has the persona and the pace to be there. He stepped into F1 from F2 without being a constant front runner and did that job. Im my opinion it means more that an F2 oe F3 title. Someone should sign him as a 3rd driver and let him drive in FP1 sessions from the beginning. Teams like mercedes, redbull or sauber should have a driver like him.”, cuz they have a driver who is not 100% bulletproof to do the job in their car. Anyway its just my take on Franco, let me know if you agree or disagree. Merry Christmas 🎄 ","['I thought this was a The Race article for a second', 'He showed how good he is but also how he also has some flaws. \n\nWe’ve seen many times that the decisions made by the teams are not entirely driven by performance and they also have their academies and know much better the drivers they’re nurturing. \n\nMaybe they don’t consider Franco the next Hamilton or Verstappen. Maybe his sponsors clash with the ones they already have. Maybe they have long term plans already. Maybe he talks too much. \n\nYes all these things could be disregarded for a driver coming in and putting the Williams on the podium a couple of times, but that’s not the case.']",0,2,0.33,0,2,2,0,2,0.33,0
