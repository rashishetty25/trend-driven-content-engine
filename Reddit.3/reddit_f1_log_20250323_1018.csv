1jh98nx,It’s Helmut Marko who should be under pressure - not Lawson,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jh98nx/its_helmut_marko_who_should_be_under_pressure_not/,2025-03-22, Discussion,"As bad as Liam Lawson has been so far, he is the fourth driver in a row to be in that second Red Bull seat and not look up to scratch. 

Helmut Marko heads up the Red Bull young driver programme, and in recent years has overseen the decline of an academy that brought through Vettel, Ricciardo, Sainz and Verstappen into one that has produced one race win since 2018 (Gasly’s at Monza in 2020). Meanwhile, other academies have brought through Leclerc, Russell, Norris and Piastri with far greater success and this season has seen Antonelli, Bearman and Bortoleto all graduate to F1 through other teams as well. 

Where Red Bull were once the undisputed number ones at bringing through young talents, they’ve been usurped by Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren and have reached a point where the only realistic alternatives for their second seat are to stick with Lawson or promote Tsunoda or Hadjar with the likely end result being another driver that gets taken to the cleaners by Max.

As much as people enjoy beating up on and memeing Max’s teammates, the truth is that if Marko had done his job and not spent the last few years failing to identify the better junior talents, or given them more time to develop before throwing them in at the deep end, they wouldn’t be in the position where their second seat has turned into a carousel of underperforming drivers. 

In a sport where we regularly see drivers, team principals, engineers and designers lose their jobs for failing to perform, it’s amazing that Marko hasn’t come under any scrutiny himself given that ultimately, he is the one responsible for finding and developing the drivers that are failing to deliver for Red Bull. Gasly, Albon and no doubt soon to be Lawson are merely collateral damage as a result of his failures.","['Marko used to be able to sign whoever he wanted because Red Bull used to entirely fund drivers juniors career - in exchange they had them on 5 year option contracts. \n\nThis is no longer the case, so they no longer have the pick of the litter, plus they still stick the 5 year option contracts on which make them more unattractive.', 'I’m not a fan of Marko because of his views and how he talks - but the RB young driver program has had a lot of good drivers come out of it. How many are flourishing in other teams right now? It just seems no one can stay close to Max.', 'I believe the better way to describe the issue is with the second Redbull driver is with a Horner quote: ""change your fucking car"".', ""Don't get me wrong, I think Marko is a seriously questionable person when it comes to fostering young talent (especially in this day and age) but the list speaks for itself.\n\nThe other drivers you've mentioned are from different academies or entirely different 'generations', Red Bull's driver program is still the best young driver program that has the biggest impact on the sport. \n\nI think Max is a generational talent and people put it down to 'oh it's built for max' instead of what IMO, is a case of Max being just that damn good.\n\nMarko has a lot of faults, but IMO finding talented young drivers isn't it.\n\n  \nNow when it comes to managing them... well that's a different story, they either pull the trigger too soon (Gasly/Albon) or take too long (IMO Yuki was perfect for that seat and not Lawson)"", 'What pressure?  He’s 180 years old. He’ll retire anytime. This is Horners problem. His leadership is obviously having a big impact on the teams performance.', ""Verstappen, Sainz, Albon, Gasly, Tsunoda, Lawson, Hadjar.. I don't know why RB always gets shit for it when it gives far more opportunities than any other team on the grid."", 'Many might consider this to be a hot take: Yes, the car is hard to drive, Lawson has to improve a lot and Red Bull **was** quite ruthless with their drivers, BUT - Right now, the internet/commentators are the ones who put Lawson under this immense pressure, call for (or discuss) his immediate replacement and write him off, not Red Bull.\n\nAs far as it concerns me, almost anybody will struggle with this car.', 'Why? Helmut brought good drivers to the team: Yuki, Gasly, Albon are all great drivers and he promoted them to RB or rb seats. Lawson also a good driver, he already proved that in the Visa Rb. I dont think it is Marco’s fault that Red Bull is requiring something extra as well to be able to competitive in that second seat.', 'People really ignore how hard is it nowadays to get promising drivers to their academies, RedBull were the first to do a proper academy and it showed with Vettel,Kvyat,Albon,Gasly,Ricciardo,Sainz , even Buemi Hartley Vergne went on to have great careers outside F1 \n\nNowadays all drivers who go on to reach F1 from F3 are signed to a team, Antonelli got signed in Karting if I remember correctly, Norris, Russell, Piastri all did F3 as academy members of Mclaren Merc and Alpine \n\nIt’s impossible to hoard that much talent nowadays because there 5 other teams promising a better promotion scheme to every upcoming driver']",8083,530,0.93,8083,12304,12304,87,3,0.0,87

1jh5ion,I think the fact that the teams are even closer together than last year makes the Lawson situation look much worse compared to how Pérez performed...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jh5ion/i_think_the_fact_that_the_teams_are_even_closer/,2025-03-22, Discussion,"So, a bit of a rant...

Sergio Pérez had been with Red Bull Racing for almost three and a half years, when he suddenly started to fall off. The average gap between him and Max Verstappen in dry qualifying sessions between Imola and Abu Dhabi last year was 0.638 seconds - I'm not counting Silverstone, because Pérez had only set one slow banker before spinning out, and I'm going with their lap times from Q3 if Pérez made Q3 or with their lap times from the session in which Pérez was eliminated.

The gap between Liam Lawson and Verstappen in qualifying for China today was 0.750 seconds and Lawson is only in his second race weekend with the team, and not his sixtieth or seventienth race weekend. That's a difference of just 0.750-0.638=0.112 seconds between Pérez and Larson then. Because the field seems even closer now than it did in 2024, the same margin of sixth or seven tenths now costs a driver more positions.

Lawson is getting a lot of slander and people are immediately calling onto Red Bull to put Yuki Tsunoda in the seat alongside Verstappen, but let's be frank here. Tsunoda would not be doing any better, if he were with Red Bull Racing. You can't tell me Pierre Gasly who is now seen as a major talent for Alpine, Alexander Albon who is clearly the best driver Williams has had in many years, Sergio Pérez who pulled off many miracles with midfielders Sauber and Force India, and Liam Lawson who is known for having been quick in many completely different cars throughout his career, are all *awful* drivers. Lawson and Tsunoda were consistently equal on pace at AlphaTauri in 2023 and at VCARB in 2024. You can't tell me Lawson's talent has just evaporated over the past winter.

A gap this relatively big can't be down to just the driver. Listen to everything Verstappen has said about the car in the last half of 2024 and now in 2025. The Red Bull car is slow and uncomfortable to drive.","['Yeah true to a certain extent. It also helped Gasly / Albon as there was a much bigger gap between top three teams and the rest. \n\nAlso made charging through the field a lot easier because you essentially need a 0.6-9s a lap advantage to pass often.', 'I would\'ve called the ""car is undrivable"" rumour BS if it wasn\'t for when Red Bull finally admitted last year that the car already had issues back in Spain 2023 but they ignored Checo\'s feedback of the car because Max was dominating.\n\nSo not did they only ignored feedback, they also continuously hound on their 2nd driver instead of trying to make improvements to their car. Add on another fact that Red Bull, especially Helmut Marko, constantly relies on Max outdriving the car every weekend to get results with the ""Verstappen factor"" nonsense. Yes, Max is quick and consistent, but he is not god.\n\nThat team may as well be called ""Oracle Verstappen F1 Team"".', 'So, when is max getting promoted to RB, and who has to be dropped to red bull?', 'No that was actually more a case for Perez. Best example of that was Monaco qualifying last year, where he got knocked out of Q1 while being ""just"" 2 and a half tenths down on Max\'s time (this is not to say Perez wasn\'t performing horribly tho. He absolutely did, especially near the end of the year)\n\nEven accounting for the more closed up grid, the gap Lawson is losing to Max by is incredibly damning. What was it - almost a second between them? And the bigger problem is that, at least based on observations it is much worse in actual race pace\n\nStill, it\'s only been two races on the tracks he has not driven yet. It doesn\'t look good and the trend points to his immediate capitulation and collapse within that seat, but there is a relatively strong possibility he will perform better in Japan, it being a track he has on track experience with', 'I think what would be really interesting is to see max on another team. The combo of him being a generational driver and his extreme style / red bulls complete focus on him makes it difficult to judge.', 'Yes, and the fact that Red Bull is entering this season already on their back foot, I would be shocked if he makes it even 5 races in if he doesn’t start delivering points now.', 'I remember a few years ago, Bottas out qualified Lewis at Barcelona by six tenths. Lewis started P2.\n\nNow, that gap alone would be considered an absolute disaster. The close field spread is amplifying small differences.', ""Perez started out well with all his experience coming into red bull, but even that wasn't keeping him up there. It is coming to a point that if you're not Max driving the car, whether or not it is because of car being designed for him or him being able to drive around issues, you're not going to be up the top charts often enough.\xa0\n\n\nWe have seen Liam within Yuki's performances in the sister team, so it's not like he's Sargeant or even Mazepin level. Red Bull doesn't dare try their hands on a considered top driver, whether that is political or knowing they have a car fundamental issue."", 'Atleast my man is consistent']",240,90,0.79,240,651,651,-2,1,0.0,-2

1jh9iln,[AMuS] Verstappen window too small for Lawson,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jh9iln/amus_verstappen_window_too_small_for_lawson/,2025-03-22, News,,"['Translation:\n\n\n> Max Verstappen and Liam Lawson are driving at two different ends of the Formula 1 grid. That won\'t change even with a different number two. Verstappen is too good, and Red Bull\'s operating window is too narrow.\n\n> What could Sergio Perez have been thinking at home on his couch in Guadalajara? Max Verstappen is currently burying his next Formula 1 teammate. The Chinese GP demonstrates Red Bull\'s full dilemma. Max Verstappen is at the front of the field, Liam Lawson at the back.\n\n> The numbers show it all. In the sprint qualifying (March 21), the world champion finished second, his teammate 20th. In qualifying for the main race, Verstappen finished fourth and Lawson last again. The gap between the two was an average of one second. Even though Lawson is new to the team and still learning, the gap is too large. The seat in the second Red Bull will likely remain the hot seat in Formula 1.\n\n> Voices are already being raised again that the New Zealander could soon be demoted to Toro Rosso, and Yuki Tsunoda could be promoted to the A team instead. In Shanghai, sporting director Helmut Marko used words we\'ve heard before before internal driver reshuffles. ""Lawson isn\'t delivering what we expect from him. We\'ll have to analyze this carefully. Everyone at Red Bull knows: For us, performance is what counts.""\n\n> Tsunoda also fails to solve Red Bull’s problem. Yuki Tsunoda may be in the form of his life, but even he wouldn\'t change much about the situation at Red Bull. He might be three-tenths closer to Verstappen, but he would suffer more mentally in the medium term than the still-fresh Lawson. And the same would happen to Isack Hadjar, Ayumu Iwasa, or Arvid Lindblad. Their careers would be over before they even began.\n\n> Red Bull must recognize that there\'s no ideal driver alongside Verstappen. Not in the current configuration. The Dutchman is too good and the car too bad. The RB21 still exhibits the weaknesses of its predecessor, perhaps a little less pronounced and a little easier to conceal. However, it still loses balance quickly, behaves differently from corner to corner, and therefore puts more strain on the tires.\n\n> Window too small for two drivers\nThe car has a tiny working window. Setting up the car is like a doctoral thesis. Verstappen and his technical crew usually hit the mark at some point. Sometimes sooner, sometimes later. Sometimes precisely, sometimes less precisely. But when it matters, the four-time Formula 1 World Champion is there, getting the most out of his package. Or he works around the problems that can\'t be solved.\nHis teammate has a doubly difficult time. Even if he could set up the car perfectly, he would be slower than Verstappen. However, he usually hits the window less often and less accurately. Because his window is probably somewhere else entirely. Perez always explained it like this: ""Then I would feel comfortable in the car, but it would be slower."" Red Bull would have to find a driver who demands exactly the same from the car as their star driver. Lando Norris would be one of them, but he wouldn\'t trade his McLaren for a Red Bull these days.\n\n> Lawson is no different than Perez. The new man in the second Red Bull admitted after another qualifying setback: ""The window of the car is extremely small. I can\'t find it. That\'s why I don\'t have 100 percent confidence in the car. I don\'t have the time to understand the car better."" We\'ve heard something similar from his predecessor before.\n\n> Where would Verstappen be in the Toro Rosso?\nAs long as the technical department can\'t build a Formula 1 car that\'s both docile and fast, Red Bull will remain a one-man team. It makes no sense to send other drivers from the pool into a battle they can\'t win. That would only burn out more drivers. The young drivers have one advantage over last year\'s solution: They\'re all cheaper than Perez.\nLawson probably secretly wishes he could get back to the Toro Rosso. The VCARB02 is the better car at the moment. Isack Hadjar was only two-tenths behind Verstappen. The same was true of Yuki Tsunoda in Melbourne.\n\n> If the Red Bull continues to prove to be a fickle car and its sister car from Toro Rosso proves to be a hit, then a completely different question soon arises: Would Verstappen have a better chance of defending his title in the B team? He wouldn\'t be the first driver to become world champion in two different cars. Juan-Manuel Fangio began the 1954 season with Maserati and finished it with Mercedes.\n\n> Two things stand in the way of this currently still audacious idea. Red Bull\'s potential to further develop its car is greater than Toro Rosso\'s due to its manpower and infrastructure. And without Verstappen, Red Bull would slip so far back in the Constructors\' Championship that it would cost the racing team a massive amount of money in terms of payouts from the rights holders.', 'During the quali, one of the commentators talked how Max likes loaded front and loose rear. That style of driving can be challenging. \n\nMany others prefer planted rear. Especially at slow corners, they steer a little strongly. The car turns when the fronts bite. For it to work you need some understeer and a stable rear. \n\nThe car that Max likes swings the rear more. That makes it pretty uncomfortable for the other driver.\n\nAnother thing visible in one lap analysis of Liam vs Max is that Liam  is braking too late. The footage from the car showed he was way too far from the apex of many curves. This again can be due to not being used to rear not pressing down hard. \n\nIt would be fun to compare how Lewis or Oscar drove Shanghai to Liam and Max.', 'When Marko talks about :"" For us, performance is what counts"", doe he include the design and engineering teams? Year after year they keep producing and running those cars, at some point they should be held accountable for their characteristics.', ""That's a belter of an article from AMuS, and a huge dilemma for Red Bull and also for Max."", 'Very good article. Red Bull for sure is failing to make a car that is fast but suits a good amount of drivers. Ferrari, McLaren and this year probably even Mercedes did that. For those teams it is the rare occurance that the gap between their drivers is bigger than half a second. For Red Bull it is the other way around. Yes there still is the Verstappen factor. He is probably the best for a while now. But not by over half a second. A Russell, Norris, Piastri, Leclerc or Hamilton all could get within 2 tenths most of the time. On occasion beating him. A Lawson with his skill should be able to get within 3 tenths most of the time. Which is a world between teammates already. For me it is clear that it is at this point a simple car problem. And I am afraid that it is not an easy one to fix.', ""Yuki said he wants it for Suzuka. Just do it. Give him the chance but dont give a guarantee.\n\nThe biggest problem i have with Red Bull's approach has been their inflexibility given their options.

The season has well and truly started now', 'The car looks good but not great. Its just fallen away in the races from the front pack and Charles was quicker than George at the end of the sprint. \n\nThey might nail an upgrade and could be really in the hunt though, so if George keeps getting consistent top 5s and podiums and then the car becomes a race winner it could get spicy.', 'The cars at the top all have the same characteristics. Very edgy with a narrow window to get the perfect output and it changes lap to lap on whether you’re in the top performance window. It’s going to be like this all season. One lap they are nowhere close then next lap they are on pole.', 'I kinda want a boring race tomorrow, without SC or VSC, just to see the real pace of the top teams and their tyre deg, even though I know the hierarchy could change again in Japan and Bahrain.', 'Translation:\n\n> George Russell will start the Chinese Grand Prix from the front row. The Mercedes driver is a prime example of the thin air at the top of Formula 1. The Silver Arrows are sensing a glimmer of hope.\n\n> Three sessions had already been completed on this Grand Prix weekend in China. Then it was George Russell\'s turn. In qualifying (March 22), the Mercedes driver conjured up a fabulous lap on the freshly laid asphalt of the Shanghai International Circuit, raising eyebrows among Formula 1 experts and fans alike.\n\n> Where did that come from? That was the question on everyone\'s mind. Mercedes had consistently finished in the top ten during the second Formula 1 weekend of the 2025 season, but based on previous impressions, few had expected a front-row start. In the sprint qualifying (March 21), Russell finished fifth, while his teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli raced from P7 into the sprint on Saturday morning (March 22).\n\n> In the end, the Mercedes drivers finished fourth and seventh. Not bad, but nothing earth-shattering either. Until qualifying, the main topics were Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari), Lando Norris and his mistakes in the McLaren, and Max Verstappen\'s daring performances in the Red Bull. There was barely any room for the former Formula 1 dominators, until the final lap of qualifying.\n> George Russell himself was surprised by the stroke of genius he had achieved in the closing seconds. ""I don\'t think anyone expected to challenge the McLarens. Third place would have been a good result, so second place is a great result,"" the Mercedes spearhead rejoiced.\n\n> Toto Wolff optimistic for the China race. His team boss, Toto Wolff, was equally enthusiastic about his protégé\'s performance in a Sky interview: ""George is one of the absolute fastest drivers in the field – if you give him the right car."" Russell delivered when it counted. A trait necessary in this tight Formula 1 world to score big points.\n\n> Wolff also believes that despite the high tire wear in Shanghai, Mercedes has a lot in store. Last year, the Silver Arrows suffered in the high temperatures. However, the W16\'s operating window has expanded. The good starting position could therefore help Mercedes. Wolff explained: ""If you take Lewis (Hamilton) out of the sprint, almost all the cars were equally fast and had similar tire wear.""\n\n> Nevertheless, the McLarens of pole-sitter Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, who will start from P3, are the favorites heading into the Chinese Grand Prix. Wolff agrees. ""We expect the McLarens to be strong, while the Ferraris had the edge in this morning\'s sprint. We\'ll start from P2 and try to assert ourselves at the beginning. Then we\'ll see where we end up.""\n\n> Antonelli dissatisfied with eighth place. George Russell performed brilliantly in qualifying. His rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli, on the other hand, was unhappy. ""I\'m a little disappointed. It was difficult to get the most out of the tires."" The 18-year-old was self-critical about his performance in the final qualifying segment. ""I had some good laps throughout the session, but my two attempts in Q3 weren\'t my strongest.""\n\n> Chief engineer Andrew Shovlin defended Antonelli. ""It was his first Q3 of his Formula 1 career. Of course, he\'ll be disappointed, but he can focus on tomorrow to attack in the race.""\n\n> There, it will be crucial to preserve the left front tire over the stints. Shovlin knows this too. ""In the sprint, we had more graining than expected. You have to be extremely careful: If you push, the tire will degrade immediately."" Qualifying champion Russell is aware of this. Nevertheless, the three-time Grand Prix winner wants to be part of the action on Sunday (March 23). ""Hopefully we can manage the tires well, utilize the car\'s pace, and achieve a strong result.""\n\n> If George Russell can confirm Saturday\'s performance and finish the Chinese GP in the top three, it would be the 300th podium finish in Mercedes\' Formula 1 history. Either way, Mercedes will be back at the front in Shanghai, making the premier class even more exciting.', 'George ""McLaren now more dominant than Red Bull ever was"" Russell', ""George is an underrated driver. I really like him. It's clear that Mercedes don't know how to market him. He is just so English and lacks presence, but he can drive. He could politely find himself a WDC if he stays consistent."", 'George will mind his business to a WDC', ""It's definitely too early to try make assumptions, but there is some data showing that Mercedes and Ferrari might have switched positions this year as far as you had the better car compared to last year.""]",99,64,0.87,99,861,861,0,0,0.0,0

Prior to 2023, I guess the two were very close to each other and Sainz used to always mention Alonso as his Hero.

After 2023, I don’t think I have seen Sainz talk about Alonso, at least publicly. For example, in 2024 when they asked the drivers to name 3 F1 world champions, Sainz didn’t mention Alonso. A week ago, when asked to choose between Senna and Alonso, he didn’t even waver in choosing Senna. The old Carlos Sainz I believe would’ve chosen Alonso in a heartbeat.

Just my observations. Did any of you sense something odd going on between these 2 since those incidents in 2023?

Mine are:

- Red Bull declines in 2026/7, transfers to a ""Marketing Partnership"" with Ford, effectively giving control of the entire technical department to Ford for rumoured 2028/9 reg changes. Due to a direct competitor in Cadillac (GM) being present and the heavy Americanisation of the sport with Liberty in charge, Ford will finally buy back its team from Red Bull if they decline too far.

- HAAS will do a similar transfer as above to Toyota and the Colonge facility if the rumoured 28/29 reg changes are true

- Max will leave Red Bull after 2026, as Helmut Marko has left the team and Horner has all control, probably to Ferrari to replace a retiring Hamilton, before retiring to join WEC.
Carlos Sainz would be in line for the RBR seat, as Jos Verstappen will no longer be there, fighting with Carlos Snr constantly.

- Audi will push hard for a reg change in 2028, realising they've failed on the engine program massively and underestimated their capability to catch-up with the aero regs. 

- Alpine will EXIT the sport due to ongoing financial issues and the imminent decline and death of Nissan (Co-owners with Renault), selling to Porsche, depending on the regs changes above and how engine favoured they are.

1jh5akm,A theory on Ferrari and Racing Bulls strategy.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jh5akm/a_theory_on_ferrari_and_racing_bulls_strategy/,2025-03-22, Discussion,"Over the last 5 years two teams have stood out as being very poor strategy wise. 

Ferrari, who arguably could have won or at least fought a lot harder for both the 2019 and 2022 titles had they had better strategy. 

The other is Toro Rosso/Alpha Tauri/VCARB/ Racing Bulls/ Red Bull B-team/RB/ whatever you want to call them. 
Though not as talked about as Ferrari (understandable given they are a midfield team) many fans have noticed how many points they have thrown away from bad strategies. 

I would also like to throw Sauber in here as well because in 2021 they threw away points with Raikkonen and in particular Giovinazzi on a good few occasions. Since then Bottas and Zhou have also lost positions in the pit stop phase in the last few years, thoigh it's hardly ever noticed because it tends to result in a drop from P13/14 to P15/16. 

What all three of the aforementioned temas have in common is that they are the only teams based outside the Uk and as a result have more of their engineers from countries such as Italy, where English is not the first language. 

The reason this is importnat is because all the teams have to communicate to their drivers jn English, mainly for our entertainment so we understand team radio's. 

Is it possible that this is hampering these engineers efforts to quickly communicate with their drivers.

 Take Max's engineer GP for an example of the opposite. He is English and is able to use as little words as possible but still get the point across crisply and clearly. 
In fact all but 6 driver engineers on the grid (according to my research) have English as their first language. The exceptions are a Haas engineer, A Sauber one, and both Ferrari and Racimg Bulls engineers. 

So is it a coincidence that the two teams that dont have either engineers with English as their first language are also the two teams with the worst strategy? And should temas be allowed to communicate with drivers in other languages? 

I'd be really interested to hear what you all think.","[""not speaking english as their main language doesn't have any effect on the decisions the strategy team themselves make."", ""Good theory. For example, McLaren last year were spotless in their strategy calls as they fought for the WDC and that's because they are not silly disorganized Italians. /s"", "">Is it possible that this is hampering these engineers efforts to quickly communicate with their drivers.\n\nI don't think Yuki's or Lewis' engineers communicating to them in Italian would improve communication."", ""To an extent. The 2 Italian teams do seem to have the biggest brain-farts when it comes to strategy. \n\nBut I'd also argue that really only rbr have, what I'd call, consistently good strategy calls, all other teams, over a season are mediocre at best, considering the level they're operating at."", 'where is that Sopranos meme\n\nThis is anti italian discrimination!!', 'If you go through the Merc dominant years you will find countless examples of them really not having a good strategy and relying on the car+driver combo to get them out of sticky situations.

They should be the brain of the live race ops (e.g. James Vowles\' ex-Merc role).\n\nWhile it\'s true that the driver has the best view on track, the garage has the big picture with more time and information to forecast and weigh decisions. \n\nI forgot which race but that infamous ""Stop inventing"" from Carlos where he was supposed to let Charles go ahead. The logic was that Carlos with better tires can protect both their positions. IIRC, that seemed very fictional because it will end in both of them being passed. \n\nIn any case, if your driver can consistently think of better strategies than your dedicated strategist/s, then what are they there for? \n\nThe ideal situation should have a strategist presenting clear choices that both the team and driver can easily weigh OR an already decided action plan to execute. \n\nPerhaps better said that all strategies presented (2-3 choices or a firm recommendation) should be so effective that no one second-guesses it. That should dilute most, if not all, language barrier issues.']",0,27,0.25,0,278,278,0,0,-0.030000000000000027,0
1jhdvff,Your theories on the second RedBull,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jhdvff/your_theories_on_the_second_redbull/,2025-03-22, Discussion,"I am counting on people bringing some facts based on track data and interviews.

I have several theories regarding why every single second RB driver just... falls off the wagon.

1. Ever since 2018, the car had been a nightmare to drive. I am considering here the perfectionism Max has and how he has forced himself through countless hours in the simulator to adjust his driving style to the peculiarities of the car. Or maybe, that is just his natural style and here is an interesting bit of speculation, beginning with 2018, the cars have only been built around him, that is why Ricciardo fell behind Max beginning with that year.   
  
2. Max was just better than everyone, but ever since Perez won in Azerbaijan in 2023 they have not run identical configurations on the cars to avoid driver conflict. This would fail to explain though why they would still keep this after Perez left. We are going down the rabbit hole of conspiracies now, as the only reason would be to make Max appear like God's gift to the motorsport and milk an undrivable car for every single drop of performance. 

3. The second RB is cursed and Marko's glass eye is the final horcrux. Slightly far fetched this one.

Now, if we go with theory number 1, which is the most feasible, that means Max has a very VERY peculiar driving style as of today, and the cars are built to respect his style and they couldn't give a rat's ass about the second driver. They say the greatest of them all would be able to drive a matchbox car into a title battle, however I would be curious if that applies to Max. If a car fit for his driving style is undrivable by literally anyone else, how would he do in a regular championship winning car, like this year's McLaren? Would he just dominate the field, would he be able to adapt? Or would he fall slightly behind the other driver in a car that has to be driven in a more conventional way?","[""3... it's 3."", ""The car was absolutely not a nightmare to drive in 2018. The Renault power unit was just fucking garbage and Danny's car."", ""Any theories about sabotage make no sense. Red Bull would love to have two drivers so they have better strategy options.\n\nPerez has been the only driver they've had with actually decent experience since the Ricciardo era. Obviously the car is extremely difficult to drive, but that's only compounded by sticking drivers who are barely not rookies(or in Albon and Lawson's case who were actually rookies).\n\nI wish RB would've taken a decent youngish driver like Sainz so we could finally see a representative gap."", 'There\'s a couple of interesting points of reference that we can use to draw an a likely conclusion of what\'s happening.\n\n1. Alex Albon gave an interview 1 years ago where he was asked about Max and about the red bull car and he responded by saying.  \n   1. ""The first thing is, a lot of people say that car is built around him, he’s kind of like the Michael Schumacher of Ferrari, he’s created this team around him. Truthfully, the car is what it is, he is very quick.""\n   2. So what he\'s saying is that people think the car is built around Max and that he\'s created this team around him (like with Schumacher at Ferrari), but in reality the car is just the car, he\'s just very quick.\n2. Newey gave an interview where he discussed Max Verstappen and designing the car.The car was designed to just be the fastest it could be. \n   1. Newey remarked how intelligent Max was and how much ""processing power"" he had and he said it gave him a massive edge.  While others were focused on keeping the car on the road and pushing, Max just could do that without using up much processing power.  \n   2. Thus, he could spend the race focused on managing tires, thinking about strategy, and just finding the optimal way to manage a race.  He also mentioned that was something that you saw with the greatest drivers (Hamilton, and Alonso were mentioned).\n3. Newey was not allowed to work on the car once he announced his departure from Red Bull.  \n   1. The Red Bull was modified by the team without his input and, while it\'s likely the improved overall speed, they likely lost a lot of the balancing they had before.  \n   2. Basically, they were adapting his design without Newey to offer suggestions which probably increased instability.\n4. It came out that Max had also been heavily complaining about the car.  \n   1. Max supposedly was very unhappy with the balance of the car as it was getting increasingly problematic to drive.  It also came out that the team sort of ignored his complaints because they saw that he was still putting the car on the podium so they assumed Max was complaining just to complain.\n   2. Checo was also complaining very heavily but the team saw Max was performing near the top of the field and assumed Checo was just not performing to the level he should be. \n   3. Basically, both drivers were complaining but because Max was finding ways to put that car up front, they were ignored. This suggests that Max\'s skill really hurt the development of the car because he was able to drive around most of the problems it had until it got to a point where those problems became insurmountable.\n\nSo.... In conclusion, the 2 most likely reasons on Red Bull\'s dropoff are...\n\n1. Max Verstappen\'s skill caused the team to continue developing the car in the wrong direction as he was able to adapt to whatever they threw at him (even if he wasn\'t happy).\n2. Or option 3 from your list.\n   1. The second RB is cursed and Marko\'s glass eye is the final horcrux. Slightly far fetched this one.', ""My theory is that Daniel Ricciardo made a horcrux in Helmut's eye as revenge and cursed the position of RB's 2nd chair. I heard the rumor back at Hogwarts."", '3 may not be as far fetched as you think.', ""It's not that complex, RedBull designs a car for the new regulations (2017/2022), the car works fine for both drivers. -> They make the car more aggressive to try to gain time, Max adapts but his teammate starts to struggle -> Since Max is getting good results RBR doesn't attempt to fix the car, because why waste time trying to fix something that isn't broken. \n\nIt also doesn't help that they keep moving up young drivers with only half a season of experience."", 'My theory is that Red Bull has never taken the time to actually find out what’s going wrong, and they have no idea why people turn to shit in it.\n\nThey had two prime opportunities to conduct exit interviews:\n\n1.

He almost immediately recovered from whatever went on in that seat, and he’s said publicly that he knows what it was but that Red Bull never asked. \n\n2. When Albon signed his 23 contract with Williams and they released him from his loan. Again, he’s contracted to another team, he’s not going to get his hopes up that he’s coming back, and he doesn’t need to fear offending people. Albon has the additional advantage that he’s spent an additional year in that seat plus the year as reserve, so likely has a better idea than Gasly.\n\nBut they seemed overconfident that they’d sorted it with Perez, until both of these guys were out of the Red Bull family and Perez went downhill….', 'the year that Albon was demoted to a reserve driver and helped develop the car, it was pretty good and Checo drove it wellS']",0,185,0.35,0,803,803,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0

Max likes his car set up in a way that nobody else has been able to handle, and Red Bull have completely given up on the idea of winning the Constructor’s Championship. 

Or

The Red Bull has over time become a very difficult car to drive, and in its difficult nature it actually falls into Max’s preferences in how a car handles and/or he is a once in a generation talent who can get the most out of it.

But does Lawsons performance (and literally every single driver before him now) show that the Redbull **IS** in fact built around Max?

Other commentators seem to be landing on this conclusion again too (including fans of Max this time), and it cant be a coincidence that nobody but Max seems to be able to drive the Redbull?

But if the car were faster with different characteristics, I‘m sure Red Bull would design it that way and it would be on Max to change his driving style.', 'Like many other here are saying: the short answer is no. The car is built to be the ‘theoretical’ fastest it can go. Often, however, this comes at attributes of a car that make it difficult to drive, which in turn is just costing laptime. Teams therefore need to find a balance between the theoretical fastest, and drivability that allows for a driver the actually extract any pace from it. \n\nWith Max, it just so happens that he seems to be better than others to drive a car that still contains those difficult attributes, meaning he can drive a car that is closer to the theoretical fastest than other drivers. This doesn’t mean the car is built around Max. It just means he is more capable of driving around ‘problems’, meaning the team doesn’t need to go to as great extends to make the car manageable than other drivers might need. \n\nThey could theoretically change the car to make it more drivable for Liam, but it would most likely mean they compromise overall pace of the car as they move away from the ‘theoretical fastest’.', 'what you’re seeing stems from the fact that max is one of the best drivers to ever grace the sport, not that the car somehow only responds to his command like its the elder wand fucks sake lol', 'Every engineer ever has said you can’t build a car around a driver. Newey himself said this as well. \nSo I’ve no idea why this is still a question.\n\nYou can only change a set up towards a drivers preference.\n\nYou can also visibly see Max struggling with the car himself and he was complaining about it nearly the entirety of last season.\nWhy would he want a car that’s hard to drive?', 'The ""debate"" has been around since 2018, where people basically thought Red Bull would change the car completely to suit Max because he was becoming their number one driver. \n\nIt only seems to exist around Red Bull though, simply because Max keeps stomping his teammates, as if Red Bull are doing some sort of satanic sacrifice of the second car to make his more powerful', ""Given a choice between two equally fast and viable development paths, they'd probably listen to the feedback of the guy who's driven for them for a decade and who can win them championships. \n\nIn reality that situation likely (almost) never happens, and the car is just designed to be the fastest possible and then each driver can adjust setup to try and make it suit them."", ""If you have a car that's too slow to fight for the championship but you can sacrifice driveability to make the car faster and you have a driver who can deal with that the choice is easy.

Technical Regulations and Car Damage

Formula 1’s technical rules require that cars comply with all regulations at all times during a competition. In principle, if a component falls off and creates a bodywork opening or configuration that would normally be illegal (e.g. an extra vent or movable piece), the car is no longer in its original compliant state. However, the FIA makes allowances for accidental damage. For example, the Sporting Regulations explicitly state a car may be disqualified for being under the minimum weight except when the weight loss is due to the accidental loss of a component. This means if a part breaks off and the car is lighter (a potential performance gain), stewards can refrain from penalizing provided the loss was clearly accidental and not a deliberate design. Historically, governing bodies have even noted that cars finishing a race with missing bodywork could be penalized if the loss conferred a performance advantage, but in practice modern F1 stewards examine such situations case-by-case.

From a technical legality standpoint, FIA scrutineers will consider whether the car remains safe and within regulations despite damage. For instance, Formula 1 rules mandate certain bodywork dimensions (wing endplates, mirror mounts, etc.), but if these are missing due to on-track incidents, officials typically treat it as force majeure rather than an immediate technical infringement. The FIA’s International Sporting Code empowers stewards to exclude a car deemed dangerously constructed, and this can extend to cars with damage that makes them unsafe. In summary, the letter of the technical law demands full compliance at all times, but accidental damage is recognized as an unavoidable part of racing – so long as safety isn’t compromised.

Sporting Regulations: Safety Flags and Steward Actions

The Sporting Regulations place heavy emphasis on safety when a car is damaged. Article 3.2 requires that “a car must be in a safe condition throughout a race”, and it is the team’s responsibility to ensure this. If bodywork is flapping or the car is shedding parts, it’s considered unsafe. Marshals or Race Control can signal the black-and-orange flag (also called the “meatball” flag) to warn a driver of a mechanical issue. This flag instructs the team to pit and fix the problem on the next lap, as the issue *“may endanger the driver or other competitors”*. In 2022, Haas F1’s Kevin Magnussen was shown the black-and-orange flag on multiple occasions for a loose front wing endplate, even though he felt “the car was perfect to drive, there was no effect” on performance. The FIA, erring on the side of caution, forced him to pit and replace the damaged wing to eliminate any risk of debris coming off.

In late 2024, the FIA further strengthened rules on damaged cars. A revised Article 26.10 empowered the race director to order a car stopped immediately if it has “significant and obvious damage to a structural component” that poses a risk to the driver or others. This change was prompted by incidents like Sergio Pérez limping a severely damaged car back to the pits to avoid a safety car period. Now, teams can be instructed to pull off a badly damaged car on the spot, rather than completing a full lap. In essence, the sporting rules focus on preventing unsafe situations caused by damage – flapping parts, debris on track, etc. – rather than on the performance implications. Stewards will intervene (via flags or direct orders) if a damaged component risks flying off or the car is deemed dangerous. If a team fails to address an unsafe damage, post-race penalties can apply. A notable example was the 2019 Japanese GP, where Ferrari left Charles Leclerc out with a broken front wing. Debris from Leclerc’s car struck Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes, and the stewards issued a 10-second time penalty to Ferrari for “creating an unsafe condition on the circuit” by not pitting immediately.

Performance Advantage vs Safety: How Stewards Respond

When accidental damage happens, any performance advantage it provides is generally viewed as incidental – the FIA does not typically penalize a driver simply for benefiting from unintended aero gains. Instead, officials ask: Is the car safe, and is it still within regulatory limits? If the car’s condition is safe and the team did not violate instructions, the driver is usually allowed to continue even if the new aerodynamics are favorable. For instance, at the 2022 United States GP Sergio Pérez lost his right-front wing endplate on lap 1, creating a gap in the wing that could reduce drag. The loose piece fell off on its own a few laps later, and race officials did not display the black-and-orange flag to Pérez. After the race, Haas protested that Pérez had been allowed to continue when their driver had been forced to pit for similar damage earlier in the year. The stewards reviewed the case and “opted not to act in the case of Pérez’s car,” as the remaining wing was deemed secure and not a safety hazard. In other words, Pérez gained a potential aero benefit (better straight-line speed with a missing endplate) without penalty because the situation was considered safe and accidental.

On the other hand, if damage is considered to give an unfair advantage and create an illegal condition, stewards could intervene – but usually via existing rules (safety or technical compliance) rather than a special “performance advantage” rule. Historically, regulations acknowledged this scenario (cars finishing with missing body parts *“may be penalized if the loss is a performance advantage”*), indicating stewards have discretion. In modern F1, this would likely come into play only if a team were suspected of intentionally benefiting from damage (which would blur into cheating). For example, if a team consistently engineered a part to break off to gain speed, the FIA would investigate and could deem the car unsafe or non-compliant. In practice, teams do not try to game the rules this way, as it would be obvious and heavily sanctioned. The FIA’s default stance: Accidental damage is not treated as an illegal modification. As long as the car remains safe and the team didn’t ignore directives, the drivers are not penalized for any inadvertent performance gains.

Notable Cases of Damaged Cars and FIA Decisions

Sergio Pérez (2022) – As mentioned, Pérez finished P4 in Austin with a missing front wing endplate. The car’s altered aero may have reduced drag, but stewards allowed it since the loose piece had detached cleanly and the wing was no longer a danger. The FIA later clarified that once the endplate was gone, the wing was considered safe, so no flag was needed. Haas’s protest was dismissed for Pérez’s car because the wing, after shedding the broken piece, was secure and the car was not unsafe.

Kevin Magnussen (2022) – Magnussen’s Haas suffered minor front wing damage (often a dangling endplate) in at least three races (e.g. Canada, Hungary, Singapore). Each time, the FIA quickly showed him the black-and-orange flag, forcing a pit stop for repairs. This ruined his race results, prompting Haas to complain about consistency. Magnussen argued the damage was insignificant – *“The car was perfect to drive… you’ve got to be able to finish the race with some scratches”* – implying no real performance loss (and possibly a gain in straight-line speed). Nevertheless, the stewards prioritized safety, not allowing him to exploit a damaged but faster configuration. (Notably, after the Haas protests, the FIA agreed to be more lenient with black-and-orange flags, only using them if truly necessary, and to let teams prove a part is secure.)

Fernando Alonso (2022) – Alonso had a high-speed collision in the US GP that broke his right-side mirror. Alpine repaired the car’s other damage but sent him back out with the loose mirror, which eventually fell off as Alonso battled for position. He impressively finished seventh on the road. After Haas protested, stewards gave Alonso a post-race 30-second penalty for driving an unsafe car, citing the lost mirror and Article 3.2’s requirement to maintain safety. They were “deeply concerned” no black/orange flag was shown during the race. (Alpine later successfully appealed on procedural grounds, reinstating Alonso’s finish.) Importantly, the penalty was for safety, not because the missing mirror gave an aerodynamic advantage – any drag reduction from losing a mirror is minimal, but the risk of it hitting another car was the focus.

Charles Leclerc (2019) – Leclerc’s Ferrari lost chunks of its front wing after an opening-lap clash in Japan. Rather than pit immediately, the team left him out trying to avoid the time loss. The car was still quick, but this was short-lived “advantage” – shards of wing flew off, one piece destroying Hamilton’s wing mirror. Race control eventually ordered Ferrari to pit the car for safety. After the race, Leclerc received a penalty for “driving an unsafe car” and Ferrari was fined for not pitting earlier. This case underscored that no performance gain is worth creating a hazard; the FIA will penalize teams that gamble on damaged cars in an unsafe state.

Other examples – There have been instances of drivers continuing effectively with damage (Jenson Button finishing a wet race without a front wing, various drivers missing bargeboards or engine covers in old races), but as long as debris wasn’t endangering others, they were typically allowed to carry on. In rare cases, if a damaged part inadvertently violates a specific technical test (for instance, a broken wing failing a deflection test or a car running too low due to damage), the FIA would consider if it was purely accidental when deciding on penalties. For instance, if a skid block (plank) wears down excessively because of damage or off-track excursions, the car can still be disqualified for a technical breach (since excess wear can indicate an unfair aero advantage) – unless the team proves it was an accident. The general principle is that post-race scrutineering will not punish accident damage if the team can demonstrate the car would have met the rules intact and gained no intentional advantage.


Determining Legality of Aerodynamic Gains from Damage

When evaluating whether a damaged car’s performance is “unfair” or illegal, the FIA looks at intent and rule compliance rather than the lap time gain itself. There is no blanket rule that nullifies a fortunate performance gain from accidental damage. Instead, stewards apply existing regulations in areas of safety and technical compliance: Was the car safe to continue? Did the damage cause a direct breach of a measurable rule (weight, dimensions, etc.)? If the answer to both is no (i.e. the car is still within acceptable parameters and no hazard), the damage-induced advantage is generally treated as part of racing. Teams cannot be expected to voluntarily give up a performance gain that fate handed to them, but they must ensure they aren’t breaking any rules in the process.

The FIA’s determination of legality hinges on these factors:

Safety: If the damage creates a safety issue, the car must be fixed or retired – performance advantage is irrelevant at that point. (Both the Leclerc 2019 and Alonso 2022 cases resulted in penalties because the cars were judged unsafe.) The black-and-orange flag and the newer directives to stop severely damaged cars mid-race are tools to enforce this. A car in an unsafe condition is ipso facto not legal to continue racing.

Technical compliance: If the car, as damaged, fails to meet a technical regulation (beyond just bodywork shape – for example, being underweight or having too much flex), the FIA will investigate. Usually, teams get the benefit of the doubt for accidental damage. In cases of weight, as noted, loss of a part is a valid excuse to avoid disqualification (the lost component can be weighed separately to prove the car was legal when intact). If a critical aero device is gone, scrutineers consider the car’s legality as if that part had been there as designed. Only if the damage is suspected to be intentional or the team took some improper action would it be considered “illegal.”

Intentional exploitation: The FIA will step in if they believe a team is deliberately using damage or loose parts to gain an aerodynamic edge (this would violate the spirit of the rules). For example, a moveable aerodynamic device is illegal, so if a wing is loose and fluttering (even if by accident), the team may be told to pit – not because they broke a design rule on purpose, but to remove the potential advantage and eliminate danger. The stewards in one case noted they were “too soft” on a driver who limped a damaged car to the pits to avoid a safety car, as it might encourage copycats to do the same. Thus, the FIA’s approach is also about deterrence: ensuring no one tries to manufacture an “accidental” advantage.


In summary, Formula 1’s regulations do cover scenarios of damage – primarily through safety mandates and general clauses about compliance. Stewards assess damaged cars on whether they pose a risk and still meet the regulations, rather than directly measuring if the car got faster. If a damaged car is deemed safe and within the rules, the driver is usually allowed to continue even if there’s a performance uptick. If the damage yields an unfair effect that crosses regulatory lines (safety or technical), the FIA will act – by calling the car in, showing the meatball flag, or even penalizing after the fact for an unsafe vehicle. The ethos is that unintentional damage is not treated as an illegal innovation. As long as teams don’t recklessly endanger others or willfully exploit loopholes, a bit of accidental aero help falls under racing luck rather than rule-breaking. All incidents are reviewed in light of the FIA rules, and if needed, the stewards will cite specific regulations (like Article 3.2 on safety) or issue directives to restore a level playing field and keep the race safe.
