1ninqcx,What could happen to Fornaroli if he wins F2?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ninqcx/what_could_happen_to_fornaroli_if_he_wins_f2/,2025-09-16, Discussion,"So even though there seems to be quite a close title fight for the f2 title, it seems none of the contenders will land an F1 seat if they come out as winners.

Jak Crawford, Aston Martin's academy driver would no doubt miss out on a seat next season, given Stroll's place in the team. Verschoor I doubt will win but is unsigned. But most of all the most upsetting and uncertain situation is Fornaroli's who is not part of any driver academy and is on-course to win back to back F3 and F2 titles.

Oscar sat out a year even after going back to back rookie champions, which Fornaroli is not."", ""The current grid is pretty much locked in after the new rookies this year. \n\nThe regular driver churn is Baby Bulls or Alpine. Marko wants to use his driver pipeline. If he is making exceptions it's for the next multi WDC potential. Fornaroli doesn't have that pace. Alpine has Aron if they want to do some change. I don't really think Fornaroli is better than Aron. \n\nCadillac is committed to Herta. Things have to go really bad for a seat to open there. \n\nLawrence wants a WDC + Lance at Aston.

For Spa we want to go with Gold 3, however the tickets are sold out from the cirucit organisers itself and only available from F1 so I saw on youtube it's a bit of a hit or miss.

For Monza we are going with 8B which looks like this (I'm a Hamilton fan so if we see him win in Monza it'll be crazy but the likelyhood of that is none)

1njabhz,Is pursuing sustainable fuel worth the unintended side Effects?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1njabhz/is_pursuing_sustainable_fuel_worth_the_unintended/,2025-09-17, Discussion,"I was listening to latest episode of the race podcast regarding some of the things Domenicali said lately. And they zoomed in on the sustainable fuel and all the extra consequences it might bring.. for one; not all teams get free fuel from their fuel sponsor. Sustainable fuel will be like much more expensive, where they pay for like 2-3 million for fuel per season, this could go up to 12-15 million per season with sustainable fuel. That's a serious increase in costs for smaller teams. Just to have ""cleaner"" fuel.

Also there are talks about the fuel being standardised and that would eliminate the r&d aspect and thus make it less interesting for partner ships..how important are these partnerships? Sometimes you hear they gained some power because of better fuel, but it's marginal.

And is it fair, some teams have to pay for fuel and others don't?

What do you guys think, are these unintended side effects / collateral damage worth pursuing sustainable fuel? Will it really trickle down to the consumer automotive? It's been a long time since we have seen any substantial contribution from F1 to the automotive industry, for normal people. Not the hybrid supercars with F1 style power trains. And should F1 be a test lab for consumer automotive? 

The plus side of the sustainable fuel idea is that it comes with the return of V8, (after there wasn't a consensus abot the V10) but that's only a plus if the V8 can be like in the old days and not muzzled like the V6. Because if the V8 is just as fuel flow / rev Limited the sound won't be much better. what benefits are there to a V8 then? Just more power? ","['There are over 1.5 billion cars in the world, so going electric is not the complete solution, as most people cannot afford to buy new cars. Sustainable fuels are a far better option for everyone. Yes, developing these fuels costs money, and some companies are further ahead than others. Nevertheless, if racing can introduce fuel formulas that clearly work, the benefits will eventually trickle down to the general population, making it a priority worth pursuing. Sebastian Vettel has already demonstrated this by running sustainable fuels in his McLaren MP4/8 and Williams FW14B (yes, he owns both), proving that racing cars can be driven at speed using them.', ""I don't personally care about sound. I respect that others do, but it's not my thing. I'd personally prefer F1 cars not be louder because of very easily proven hearing loss related to sound.

2014 grid is,

Mercedes - Sebastian/Nico
Ferrari - Fernando/Kimi
McLaren - Jenson/Lewis

I see it going something like this, Vettel doesn't initially gel at Merc so Rosberg wins his first championship 2 years earlier than real life. Lewis wants out of McLaren, due to them being woefully uncompetitive, and with Fernando's relationship with Ferrari deteriorating this means a seat swap happens.

2015 and 2016 grid is,

Mercedes - Vettel/Rosberg
Ferrari - Hamilton/Raikonnen
McLaren - Alonso/Button 

I can see Vettel winning the 2015 season, he was outstanding in real life that year and I can see this upsetting Nico to the point where 2016 playsout much the same. With Rosberg winning the championship and retiring as a 2x F1 champion.

This is where I'm going to ask the question, what do you think will happen from here. The driver market is the sane as real life with Button retiring, with Stoffel replacing him, and Bottas going to Merc as Nicos replacement.
