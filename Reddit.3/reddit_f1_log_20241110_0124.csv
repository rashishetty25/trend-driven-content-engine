1gnnzfy,"Into the Buxtonverse: following up on Will's predictions of the 2025 grid, four years later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnnzfy/into_the_buxtonverse_following_up_on_wills/,2024-11-10, Discussion,"During the 2021 summer break, Formula One published [a prediction](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/buxton-my-just-for-fun-prediction-of-what-the-2025-f1-grid-will-look-like.5ngS2W3xboKjYqmOubDVhM) by u/willbuxton of which drivers would form the 2025 F1 grid and where they would drive. Will assured the reader that it was just for fun and implored them not to take it too seriously, so I've decided to create an in-depth analysis.

First up, what he got right: 9 of the 20 drivers, with correct teams for 3 of them.

|Driver + Team correctly predicted|Driver correctly predicted to be on grid (predicted team)|
|:-|:-|
|Max Verstappen - Red Bull|Lando Norris (Red Bull)|
|Charles Leclerc - Ferrari|Carlos Sainz (Ferrari)|
|George Russell - Mercedes|Pierre Gasly (McLaren)|
||Liam Lawson (Aston Martin)|
||Esteban Ocon (Alpine)|
||Andrea Kimi Antonelli (Williams)|

The prediction of Ferrari keeping their LEC-SAI lineup for a 5th straight season deserves praise. That was a bold call given that Sainz had only completed half a season with Ferrari and had never spent even 3 full seasons with a team in his career, and it took a black swan event to keep it from coming true.

I also respect the predictions of Antonelli and Lindblad being on the grid, keeping in mind that both of them were still karting at the time. Antonelli will be on the grid in '25 while the Lindblad prediction may end up being off by only 1 year if Lindblad performs in F2 next year like he did in F3 this year. Also, by predicting Lindblad to be on the grid in '25, Will implicitly predicted that the 18-year-old age restriction would be relaxed or lifted, which did indeed happen in our timeline.

Finally, I think Seb's retirement took quite a few people by surprise in our timeline, while Will seemed to have seen it coming and was only off by 1 year in predicting it.

Okay, nice job with those predictions Will. Now let's take a look at some that didn't pan out:

|Drivers whose career ends were incorrectly predicted|Drivers predicted to be on the grid whose F1 careers ended prior to 2025|Predicted drivers who never entered Formula 1 as of 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fernando Alonso|Mick Schumacher|Pato O'Ward|
|Lewis Hamilton|Nyck De Vries|Theo Pourchaire|
|Lance Stroll||Dennis Hauger|
|Oscar Piastri||Jamie Chadwick|
|Alex Albon||Arthur Leclerc|
|Sergio Perez||Kyle Kirkwood|
|Yuki Tsunoda||Zane Maloney|
|Nico Hulkenberg||Arvid Lindblad|

As you can see, there are quite a few drivers whose careers ended by 2025 in the Buxtonverse but not here. While there was a brief ""rookie winter"" in our timeline where teams heavily valued experience, teams in the Buxtonverse were eager to give new talent a shot.

Another interesting note: Oscar Piastri's and Theo Pourchaire's fortunes are almost mirror images of each other's in the Buxtonverse. There, Alonso (still driving for Alpine) retires mid-season 2023 and is replaced by Piastri for the rest of the year, who also keeps the seat for '24. Meanwhile, Pourchaire drives for Alfa/Sauber in '23 and '24 and replaces Piastri at Alpine in '25 (it's implied that his French nationality plays a part), with Piastri failing to find a '25 seat. The two of them had finished 1-2 in F3, separated by 4 points, the year before the prediction was published and it seems Will put a lot of stock in Theo's youth and inferior machinery.

# Championship Predictions

|Year|WDC|WCC|WCC-P2|WCC-P3|WCC-P4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024|Lando Norris (Red Bull)|Red Bull|McLaren|Mercedes|Ferrari|
|2023|Max Verstappen (Red Bull)|Ferrari|Red Bull|?|Mercedes|
|2022|Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)|Mercedes|Ferrari|?|?|

Will was correct in predicting that the top teams of '21 would still be the top teams going into '25. But he didn't foresee Red Bull's utter dominance of the middle third of the new regulations or Mercedes' struggles with them.

# Miscellaneous Predictions

> Williams have regained momentum and form under the new regulations, picking up podiums and pride.

Not exactly.



>Aston Martin have had a rollercoaster few years. The change in regulation wasn‚Äôt kind to the team, dropping them to ninth in 2022, but steady progress in 2023 and 2024 has brought them back up to a competitive space for 2025.  
...  
In 2024 (...) fifth in the constructors‚Äô championship

This is kind of accurate?



>¬†Schumacher moved to Alfa Romeo in 2023 after a second season with Haas in 2022 failed to live up to expectations.

In a way, that 2nd part came true.



>AlphaTauri remained unchanged in 2022 and rocketed to 5th in the constructors‚Äô championship. At season‚Äôs end Yuki Tsunoda made way for Liam Lawson and another solid season brought the team home in sixth.

>But Gasly‚Äôs defection to McLaren for 2024 left an open door and into it stepped the impressive Dennis Hauger, fresh from the F3 title in 2021 and the F2 crown in 2023 to race alongside Lawson into 2024.

1gnczad,[RacingNews365.nl] Wolff again lashes out at Masi over Verstappen's controversial world title,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnczad/racingnews365nl_wolff_again_lashes_out_at_masi/,2024-11-09, News,,"['whoever share rn365 news rn is a fucking bot honestly', ""I mean he's not wrong but why are we still talking about it?"", 'Interviewer : How often does Wolff think back to that day?\n\n> ""There\'s definitely a moment every week that I think about it. But I mainly think about it because I think Lewis deserved to be the greatest of all time with eight world championship titles. You can keep arguing about that year, but I think Max and Lewis were both deserving champions,"" Wolff said on the High Performance Podcast .\n\n> ""There were times during that year when Max lost points that he shouldn\'t have lost. You look at Silverstone and the crash at Monza that the two of them had. They were both deserving champions on that particular afternoon in Abu Dhabi, but it was unfair.""\n\n> Wolff continues his story about the then race director, Michael Masi. ""I was angry, not even depressed or sad, just angry. One individual, by making a bad decision, was able to take an eighth championship away from the best driver in the world. Now you have to put that into context. There are dictators and crazy politicians all over the world who cause so much pain and so much damage. That is in no way comparable to Lewis losing his eighth title.""\n\n> ""It was just the anger at that moment towards one person and that was emotionally draining. Even Lewis needed a few days to get back to normal. It\'s still with us, given the unfairness of that day. But it\'s not like it\'s on our minds all the time and that it bothers us.""\n\n> Then Wolff elaborates on Masi. ""I really tried to talk to Michael and guide him throughout the year. I said to him: \'Listen, I\'ve been in the sport for a long time. Listen to the drivers. Don\'t be stubborn in making decisions and don\'t be arrogant\'. I tried to do that for the good of the sport and of course for us as a team. That way we wouldn\'t be vulnerable in situations that could be very bad. But in that sense it\'s just unforgivable what happened.""\n\n> The Austrian continued: ""I realise how he feels and I know that it\'s not good. It\'s bad. But he could have thought about it all year and some people, not just me, tried to support him in the right way. Sometimes you just have to realise that someone is just doing their own thing or making their own decision. So I don\'t care anymore. We\'re talking about it now, but we\'re actually wasting our time now. It\'s not relevant anymore.""', ""NGL, that whole situation still pisses me off when someone mentions it, but it's happened... it's history now. Focusing on it constantly isn't healthy at all. \n\nToto needs to just stop talking about it when asked in interviews."", ""i get it. i randomly lash out at masi too sometimes. i'll be driving all happy then remember what happened and yell fucking masi! day ruined"", 'ü•±', ""Ultimately Lewis lost it throughout the rest of the season, it never should have come down to AD, it only did because of Silverstone and Hungary.\n\nPlenty of other examples where Lewis and Max gained or lost due to race director decisions, it's silly to pretend AD was the only race in the entire season, had Lewis not messed up his brake magic in Baku he'd have won as well and that was for 25 points and not 7.\n\nIt's so easy to point fingers at Masi for losing you points instead of taking responsibility for their own mistakes that lost them even more."", '> ""I really tried to talk to Michael and guide him throughout the year.
