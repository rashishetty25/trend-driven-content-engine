1jp955g,"Continuing my post about underrated and unlucky drivers of F1, the first one of them being Chris Amon, here is Jean-Pierre Jarier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jp955g/continuing_my_post_about_underrated_and_unlucky/,2025-04-01, Throwback,"This man had it all to have a bright career in F1, talent and speed, he won  the 1973 Formula Two title with March and for 1974 he was rumoured to be signing with Ferrari, but due to Clay Regazzoni reccomending Niki Lauda to Enzo Ferrari, Jarier didn't get the seat and ended up in the new Shadow team, the team itself wasn't bad, they had a good designer on Tony Southgate and also they were very capable, but the main problem for the team was the poor reliability of the cars.

In 1974 he became the leader of the team after the death of Peter Revson, and he was able to get a podium (3rd) on the Monaco Grand Prix. In 1975, he started the season by being on pole on the first two races, it looked promising for Shadow, but he DNS'd on Argentina amd retired in Brazil due to a mechanical failure while standing strong in the lead (27 laps led in the race), while Tom Pryce overshadowed Jarier in race performance, the Frenchman was still a very capable driver, but Shadow's dip in performance during the second half of the 75' and whole 76' season and also Pryce outperforming him left Jarier without a ride for 77.

The next season he became the first driver ever for the backmarker German team ATS, where in his debut with them, he finished 6th. But the performance of the team went downards and he jumped from ride to ride, until in 1978 he got the golden chance in quite tragic reasons. Lotus signed him as a last minute replacement for Ronnie Peterson, after the Swede died from injuries suffered in the Italian Grand Prix. Jarier looked strong in his debut with the team on the US West GP, where he was running third before his car broke down.

But the saddest moment came in Canada, where he got his third pole in F1 and dominated the whole race for almost 50 laps when his car broke down again and he had to retire, basically his last chance to win a Grand Prix ended there. From then on he got 2 solid seasons with Tyrrell, getting 2 podiums in 1979 and being a consistent point scorer with them.

After that, he drove for backmarker team Osella and in his last year in 1983 with Ligier, where he became known as a moving chicane who ignored blue flags as much as he could. Overall, Jarier's career was one of pure bad luck and bad choices, which leaves a very underrated driver, who had massive potential and could have won a few races, but never got the shot to run a full season with a top tier team.","['Btw, sorry for making such a long post, I just love writing about racing memorabilia too much.', '“Jarier really is completely out of order, I mean he really shouldn’t be allowed to drive in Grand Prix racing, he is, well he’s got a mental age of 10 in the first place and that was absolutely disgraceful… he should certainly have a short suspension for that, and for being himself he should have a permanent suspension” -James Hunt, 1983 Austrian Grand Prix\xa0', 'You’re beautiful\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfuiuulbyase1.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8eb3e1048010951138d2b04ff43b622330de03e', ""Where's Montoya with that BMW that exploded every race?
