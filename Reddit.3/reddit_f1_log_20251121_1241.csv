That having been said, he has persuaded me that he has a real prospect of establishing at trial that the six year primary limitation period for the two tort claims governed by English law could be extended under section 32. \n\n> 215 In my judgment, Mr Massa is not entitled to claim declaratory relief for reputational or publicity reasons. The present claim cannot of course rewrite the outcome of the 2008  Drivers’ World Championship, but if declaratory relief along the lines sought were granted that is how Mr Massa would present his victory to the world and it is also how  it would be perceived by the public. The second declaration is in the terms that were it  not for the FIA’s breaches of duty, Mr Massa would have won the championship: in other words, that he should have won the championship. The FIA, as an international sporting body outside the reach of this Court, could and would simply ignore any such  declaration. That underscores its lack of practical utility, but the declaration comes too  close in my view to impinging on the right of the FIA to govern its own affairs. \n\n\ntl;dr: Massa is not getting the 2008 championship no matter what but he might have a valid case of tort against FIA, however unlikely."", 'this isn’t about the championship, it’s about the fact that ecclestone knew about the corruption and did nothing. run that man his money and get it over with.', ""Anyone commenting here should be ignored, there's no way they can read the full legal documentation in such a short amount of time, then write a comment"", 'Lol.

1p2av9p,Why do some people hate the new chassis for the 2026 season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p2av9p/why_do_some_people_hate_the_new_chassis_for_the/,2025-11-20, Discussion,"I've seen on multiple places online that some are calling the new regulations horrible and calling the new car design too small and saying it looks like the Formula E car and the F3 car even though it doesn't look anything like them. 

Are they complaining just to complain or is the design actually bad, I'm a new fan and I don't really know what to think, in my opinion it looks like the older 2004-2008 cars but safer making tracks like Monaco actually viable to drive on as the current cars are too wide for that old close racing. 

As I said before I'm a new fan and I didn't actually see how the racing used to be, if there are any long time fans who saw the older cars in action(Sorry if my question is unclear as English isn't my first language) ","[""If you keep clicking trash content over anticipating next year you'll get trash content over-anticipating next year."", 'It’s formula one.\xa0\n\nIf things change, you’ve got people complaining. If things stay the same, you’ve got people complaining. \xa0If the tires last forever, people complain. If the tires fall off quickly, people complain. If things are changed for literal safety reasons, people still complain.\xa0\n\nIt’s not worth paying attention to or trying to find reason behind.\xa0', 'Welcome to the madhouse!\n\nFolks like to complain is probably the biggest reason lol. We\'re going from establish regs, which people don\'t generally like, lol, to something totally unknown. \n\nThe fun part of the unknown is that..we don\'t know what\'s going to happen. There\'s been a lot of fearmongering narratives that the new cars will be ""slower than F2"" etc., and honestly - that\'s just not going to happen. The cars will probably have slower lap times to start off compared to the current cars, but honestly - that\'s OK. As a casual viewer, I can tell the difference between a quali push and a race lap speed, but honestly I can\'t tell the difference between a 1:15.00 lap and a 1:16.500 lap. If we\'re a few secs/lap slower, but the wheel to wheel racing is better? Hell yeah, sign me up.', 'As a formula 1 fan since the days it was shown on the BBC, you will always get people moaning and complaining about the regulations no matter what... Bit of advice, just watch the racing and enjoy it for what it is...', 'Dont let other people tell you if you should like it or not, keep an open mind and just wait and see. You dont have any influence on the ruleset anyways.', 'The cars are so damn big, 2026 is a love in the right direction and then we need another reduction of the same amount. \n\nThen we can see where we are at but even after that probably still need another reduction in length.', '90% of the internet is people complaining about random shit. 5% is people complaining about the complainers, and the rest is memes.', "">calling the new car design too small\n\nI didn't think I'd ever see anyone wanting larger cars in F1..."", ""I do not care how they look at all. I also dont want to see the race more about battery management over a lap than driver's ability to turn/brake/exit corners. So i also hate the 2026 cars because its 100% going to resemble formula e with the added negatives of the cars also not being balanced."", ""Anyone that knows anything about F1 would agree that these cars are too big. They're shrinking by a few percent only. It's a start, but it's not enough. Anyone arguing the 2026 cars will be too small is overestimating the change and is clueless about F1 in general. \n\nThere are other arguments about energy management that might be legitimate, but even then their effect on racing will be hard to determine until we see these cars driven in anger. Right now it's all theory and speculation. Basically, don't believe anything you read if someone's predicting anything concrete. Whatever problems an average fan can imagine are the same problems teams of highly-educated and experienced F1 engineers have been putting their minds to for the last year or two. Fans know nothing.""]",0,22,0.25,0,136,136,0,0,0.0,0
