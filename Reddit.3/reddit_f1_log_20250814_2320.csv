It really goes into detail about how they came to the decisions they did, for example it might detail the changes that needed to be made when McLaren switched from Peugeot to Mercedes engines in 1994, or why Sauber decided to stick with an outdated engine for 2017.\n\nEdit to add: It's not super technical though, if that's what you're after.
