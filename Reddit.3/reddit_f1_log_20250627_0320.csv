A new underbody is supposed to give the SF-25 a boost. The drivers hope it\'s pointing in the right direction, but doubt it\'ll be enough for McLaren.**\n\n> The unrest in Maranello was hushed up. Not a word about the fact that team principal Frédéric Vasseur and his engineers were being scrutinized, as was rumored in two Italian media outlets before the Canadian GP. Ferrari wants to answer all the doubters on the racetrack. Therefore, the aerodynamic upgrade planned for Silverstone was brought forward by one race to the Austrian GP (June 29).\n\n> The new underbody is intended to help open up the narrow window within which the Ferrari operates. This problem has been troubling Ferrari engineers since the beginning of the season. An initial underbody upgrade in Bahrain brought only minimal improvement. The Ferrari SF-25 remains a car that is difficult to drive at the limit, especially in qualifying.\n\n> According to Charles Leclerc, the third underbody version gives cause for cautious optimism: ""It\'s a significant step. Will it be enough for McLaren? I don\'t think so, because the gap is too big. Several small steps will be necessary."" Lewis Hamilton also expressed caution: ""I don\'t know the exact figures for how much more downforce the new underbody is supposed to provide. We hope it\'s heading in the right direction.""\n\n> **Qualifying weakness at Ferrari.**\nThe next development stage of the Ferrari is scheduled to take place before the summer break, possibly at Spa. This is the mechanical part of the rescue operation. A new rear axle is intended to keep the car\'s ride height more stable within the window where the aerodynamics work.\n\n> The goal is to make better use of the tires in qualifying without having to sacrifice careful tire management in the race. Better starting positions would make things easier for Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton on Sunday. ""It\'s easier for us to manage the tires than to drive at the limit with little fuel. We lose too much time there because we rarely manage to get the tires into their window quickly enough,"" explained Leclerc.\n\n> **Criticism of 2026 cars.**\nWhile the eight-time GP winner is hoping that the second half of the season will be better than the first, he has nothing good to say about the 2026 car. Leclerc has already driven it on the simulator. ""To be honest, it wasn\'t much fun. But we\'re still in the early stages of development.""\n\n> The loss of driving pleasure is more due to the long recuperation phases than to the reduced downforce of the 2026 cars.

1ll4gkg,Long shot Ferrari question,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ll4gkg/long_shot_ferrari_question/,2025-06-26, Discussion,"Hi Reddit,

Currently sat in a hot taxi feeling super gutted. We were supposed to go to Maranello tomorrow on the literal trip of a lifetime from NZ which has cost us $8000 to arrange.  Our flight has been canceled so now we can't go and my friend is GUTTED.

We happen to be going to Silverstone on Fri Sat next week. Does anyone know of there's any way I can get pit lane access or anything for her? I want to do something nice to make up for this.

Thank you","[""I don't know if I fully understand your question but yeah there are VIP packages that you can purchase."", 'Why not talk to airline and get a different flight arranged? Should be other flights to close by cities or connecting flights? Not sure how a paddock pass to a completely different race help you? You still need to reach there, right?

They might even throw some small upgrades your way to make up for it.', 'You can pay a lot of ££££ for the hospitality but pit lane ??

1llhosi,Driven is a better F1 movie than the new F1 movie,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1llhosi/driven_is_a_better_f1_movie_than_the_new_f1_movie/,2025-06-27, Discussion,"tldr: F1 is a Remake of what Driven wanted to be ...

It felt like the director for F1 took the Hollywood movie model from Driven (2001) - not necessarily a space odyssey about car racing - with [Kip Pardue](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0661164/?ref_=tt_cst_t_2) playing the new rookie driver and, Sylvester Stallone playing the old guy with something left in the tank.  25 years later, the new F1 movie follows a similar script - which was probably cheaper to do but sad to see on the screen - with team owner Burt Reynolds role played by Javier Bardem in the remake.

Driven was suppose to be about F1 but the governing body wanted nothing to do with Hollywood back then so we get CART cars with F1-like beauties played by Estella Warren => [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005535/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005535/) \- who actually threaded together the films two stories.

F1 feels like a remake of the movie Driven.  Check out Driven (I owned the disc) => [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132245/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132245/) but you can stream it everywhere!!

I ended up walking out of F1 movie.  Driven wasn't the greatest racing/driving movie ever made but after being an F1 fan for 15 years at that point - Driven was awesome!  It was something in the US market that felt like F1 at the time.  Yes, I know it was about CART.

Too bad the Megan the Stallion bouncer scene for some reason wasn't included and, more insights around contract negotiations (that would of been fun).

MY RATING: 72/100.  It will be a great film while folding family socks and doing laundry: You only need to look up during the driving scenes. The script and producers did a major disservice to Damson Idris in the early scene with muscle flexing scenes after a the worse possible race ending for an F1 team.  Damson is a spark on screen aka the orange sweater grid walk.  Oh, the volume shifts during race scenes were exhausting!  I hated the announcer remix bullshit.

PREDICTION: FIA and F1 are going to hate in two-years that every F1 related search is going to have this turd up in the top of the rankings for the brand.","[""I haven't seen F1 yet but I've seen Driven.\n\n\nDriven is trash."", '""I ended up walking out of F1 movie"" and then gives it a 7.2/10. That\'s a choice. Whatever, I went to the early press screening two weeks ago and really enjoyed it. Guess this film is just not for everybody.', 'I ain’t reading all that, but 7.2/10 is high for movie you walked out on.', 'Ain’t nobody going in to the F1 movie for the plot. We just want fun visuals.', 'You walked out but gave it a 7.2?\n\nEither you didn’t walk out and are lying, or are ragebaiting which is also lying. Whatever my dude', 'He didn’t walk out of shit, this dude just wanted to be edgy and complain.', 'I give this review a 2/10. The review does not explain what about the F1 movie is worse or no better than the Driven movie. Reviews based on comparisons are probably not a great approach either.\n\nWas the movie too plot heavy? Was the pacing too slow/too fast? Was there too much focus on spectacle/action without meaningful story? Did the movie mischaracterize the industry/subject in some egregious fashion? Was the acting bad? Was the script superficial or contrived? Was there no or poor character development or exposition? Were the characters insufficiently fleshed out to be relatable or were they too parodied or extreme to be believable? Did the movie lack humor/pathos/drama?\n\nOn a technical note, was cinematography poor? Color grading? Was sound design bad? Was the film scoring uninspired or overbearing? \n\nIf you want to write a review, then write a proper review.', '72 is high score, lol', 'F1 is going to hate a movie with a fresh rating in Rotten Tomatoes along with a 97% audience score?']",0,39,0.21,0,34,34,0,39,0.21,0
