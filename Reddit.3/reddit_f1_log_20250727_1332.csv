1ma0s2k,How much risk is involved with upgrading anything now compared to just focusing on next season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ma0s2k/how_much_risk_is_involved_with_upgrading_anything/,2025-07-26, Technical,"I genuinely thought that after a few races in we would not be seeing any more upgrades at all and only tweaks to previous components as well as the upgrades from the first few races. The only explanation I can think of related to the longevity of a teams perfomance is that these are upgrades that  let teams collect info for next year's car already and therefore act as testing for development, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if any components from this year's car can be reused/repurposed for next year to such a degree that it's worth it. It feels like it should be new concepts and cars like with the last regs but I'm not sure. 

It seems crazy to me to invest into this year's car unless you're red bull trying to get verstappen a title(since the constructors is decided anyway), and we have teams still slapping on new parts and spending budget on parts that won't even get to see a whole season instead of preparing for a whole new set of regulations. 

Is the squeeze of one extra constructors worth it perhaps? Since it's a few millions difference between constructors points maybe it's just worth it to spend a million or two in trying to secure another placement no matter what (or many if you're sauber squeezing out a few extra positions)? Is it to appease drivers or sponsors to not make them feel 'abandoned' for the season? 

It just feels like every dollar spent on the new reg is exponentially more valuable than the current one to me, and I'd love to see some discussion on what could make this strategy actually seem reasonable and effective rather than desperate which is how I feel about most of these upgrades right now.

Williams could just as easily finish P9 as P6 given how close everything is.  A million dollar investment in parts upgrades this season could pay out multiple times over if you can boost your WCC standings."", ""At this point I think a lot of the upgrades still coming are things they knew they needed from the start (wings made for certain types of tracks that aren't as represented in the early season as an example like most teams will have a monza wing) or things that carry over to next time that you are testing (ferrari's suspension upgrade). I don't think there are a lot of upgrades if any made purely to optimize performance this year that don't also fit one of the two categories I mentioned."", ""How do you know that every dollar spent on next year's regs will pay off?\n\n\nEvery team wants to do as well as they can every year. That means continues upgrades. Placing Ione point further up the WCC is worth tens of millions in prize money and helps you attract sponsorship and talent.\n\n\nHaving competitive cars means your engineering team thinks competitively, you don't want them to slack off for a year. Some goes for every other department and your drivers.\n\n\nThese cars are the end of years of development, you're bringing our parts that are they final version of an idea you've been working on for years, why throw away all that invested time and money?\n\n\nAnd as you said the data from upgrades this year helps with next year.\n\n\nThe new regs are a total unknown if you can grab say 5th place this year that's worth a lot more than 8th next year.\n\n\nFor McLaren this is there chance to grab both championships, it's literally impossible for them to do better next year. They'll obviously what to invest this year.\n\n\nThe nine other teams all have different reasons to keep pushing."", ""there's barely any development going on this season, most upgrades you're seeing are absolutely tiny changes, some of which probably have significant relevance to next season so they're just trying them out\n\nthe gaps between the teams are so incredibly small that even a small tweak to the fairing that leads to a suspension arm might bring you from q1 to q3 in some tracks, and if you can get data even tangentially relevant to 2026 from it, makes sense"", 'There‚Äôs money, prestige and drivers.\n\nFor a team like Williams or Haas the extra few millions from the constructors money is gonna make a huge difference.

It's all about the feeling you have with your car, though. \n\nBack in the day, teams would have unlimited testing, right now its just grand prix weekends.

I'm not sure how other people feel about this as seasoned viewers, but as a new viewer who doesn't know which driver/team I want to root for, it seems like the broadcast wants me to root for either McLaren, Redbull, or Ferrari. 

I understand these are the more popular teams, and their drivers are usually leading races, but the broadcast and camera seem to be split 90% those teams, 10% the other seven teams. 

There have been countless times that the broadcast focuses on someone like Piastri or Max cruising in 1st with no one behind them for 10 seconds, and in the meantime, there are 3 overtakes happening in the range of 12-20th place. 

I feel like they should be showcase the lower tier driver's more often, trying their best to capture all the overtakes and intense moments happening in that range, instead of only the top 5. That way, those drivers' skills and personalities get to be shown to more people. 

Additionally, it seems like the camera crew/operator often cuts to important moments right after they happen, causing the need for many replays throughout the match. This isn't detrimental, but is still very annoying, because I can see on the on-board cams that something is happening, but the camera crew doesn't show it. 

Just thought I would share my experience as a new F1 fan, would be interested to know if anyone else has had similar thoughts!","['I agree the midfield is very exciting this year and would love to see more of that action.', ""It's a race, the winner is the most important thing in any race. We're not here to see who finished 17th."", 'TV direction hasnt been great, thats definitely a common and shared complaint. They do focus on front runners, as you say even when nothing is going on and theres a real battle further back. Missing key moments by cutting away too soon or too late happens every race.\n\nAll that being said, its a mixed bag. We have had plenty of races over the last few years where the leader (often Max) is often invisible because he checked out ahead, so with no hope of action then the focus is elsewhere.\n\nIn short, there is lots of room for improvement, but TV direction will never be perfect, if for no other reason than different people want different things. Thats why using Multiviewer can really help, so you can at least have driver onboards up alongside the main feed', 'Just from personal experience and what I have seen online, so take with grain of salt. \nBut From what i understand they talk a-lot about the top teams[currently winning]. Like what i mean is, before McLaren started winning again they were also not talked about much. \n\nBut either way the broadcast does generally miss alot of action, but that is because it‚Äôs hard keeping everyone happy. \nLike when my favorite driver, is winning, i would much rather watch him cross the line is first than an overtake. But then on the other hand when a driver I am not invested in is winning I would rather see an overtake‚Ä¶ if you get what i mean, lol.', ""In the sprint the lead for the race was the most important focus. They don't normally focus on the leader of he's in front by a country mile. What gets my goat is that they cut critical video to a car stopped on a track or in the bleedin pits.

Does the car change that much from its counterpart based on driver preferences?,"[""For Red Bull specifically, they had to run a difference in spec at a number of races this year due to accident damage limiting their parts supply. Today they decided to put an update on Tsunodas car that was meant to only be on Verstappen's car this weekend (likely at the expense of not really having spares for it), so that's a topic.\n\nThis sometimes happens to teams, mostly due to accidents or because updates are introduced as soon as there are enough parts to support one car.\n\nTeams don't develop two different cars, though"", ""Every driver sets up the car according to their preferences. Some cars are harder to set up in a way that makes them fast. Some cars are only able to go fast on really sensitive setups. In cases like red bull one driver can handle those extreme setups better than the other. And because Max was winning, they didn't try to change the car in a way that makes it fast even with a less extreme setup until it was too late. \n\nI feel like people don't really understand the difference between car and setup. The car is developed mainly by the engineers and not the drivers. The setup is to make the car more comfortable for the driver, so it's gonna change according to the driver. Alex Albon has said that the car is the same and it's just Max's setups that are extreme in the past."", ""\n>Does the team prioritize that much more budget towards Max‚Äôs car?\n\nGenerally the driver further up the standings will always get priority for upgrades where only 1, or limited sets are available. This does mean Verstappen will essentially always have priority for updates.\n\nIn addition to this Yuki crashed which damaged update parts, due to the limited number of spares he was reverted to the older spec so both drivers would have spares available if required until more spares of the new spec could be manufactured. \n\n>Does the car change that much from its counterpart based on driver preferences?\n\nIn terms of actual component spec this isn't super common but it can happen sometimes. Piastri has been running some older spec parts than Norris because he, and his side of the garage prefer them for example.\n\nDrivers will however often differ on their setup according to their preferences. This can have quite a significant effect on how the car handles. Verstappen likes a relatively pointy sharp car, which a lot of drivers can't deal with. Yuki has been dialing in a bit more understeer for stability. A setup like that is theoretically slower but if it gives the driver more confidence they can wind up being faster with it than they would be with a more oversteery setup."", 'Sometimes there are differences between the cars if they only have upgrades finished for one of the two, or if there are setup differences between the two.\xa0\n\nBut I think in the context you are asking about, by number two car they mean the second team as a whole, which includes the driver skill as part of that.\xa0', ""They're the same cars, but Yuki crashed and wrecked the car several times so he didn't always have the new parts."", ""The cars start out the same at the start of the season.

We've gone through a number of format revisions and points systems in my time watching the sport and, whilst I thought the 10-6-4-3-2-1 system that ran from 1991 to 2002 worked well in making points feel like a big deal, being so few points paying positions, it also meant that most drivers were racing for no reward most weekends.

  
The 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 system that came in at the start of 2003 was an attempt to stop one dominant driver running away with the championship and winning it extra early, which is what happened the previous season when Michael Schumacher picked up his fifth world title with still a third of the season left to go. It also added two more points paying positions at the same not increasing the points for winning the race. Personally I did not like this system, for me winning a race should have more weight in terms of the championship. The difference between 1st and 2nd in this system in my opinion was too small, a 2nd and a 6th should not be worth more than a 1st, although it did achieve it's primary purpose of keeping championships close.

The biggest change to points scoring since, at least the 1991 season in which finally all race results counted towards the championship, came in 2010, to what we have now. This took in to consideration modern day F1 reliability and a larger grid (3 new teams came for the 2010 season), whilst increasing the gap between 1st and 2nd place again. Whilst I like that there are more points paying positions than any other system we have ever had, I still don't think this is enough. Consider that we have a clear top 4 teams at the moment that monopolise the top 8 points in a clean race, all that needs to happen is Aston Martin to step back up to  make it a big 5 and the other teams won't have a look in. Therefore, I believe that the points system should be changed again and **all** drivers that finish a race within 2 laps of the winner should be rewarded with points, except last position.

The suggested points payout runs from the winner with the top 3 at 75-50-40, all the way down to 1 point for 21st place. This means the points tables will be a lot higher than what we have now, but they increased massively with the change in 2010 and other increase doesn't really change things in this regard. This system means that every driver has something to fight for, as long as the car/driver package is fast enough to stay close to the front-running pace. This prevents the situation we saw in 2010 when the three new teams were so ridiculously slow getting rewarded with points, it also prevents drivers/cars that DNF getting points, ever moreso putting extra importance on consistency. This means that, should only 15 drivers finish within 2 laps of the lead driver, points will only be paid down to 15th place. For example, in the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix won by Olivier Panis, with only 3 drivers finishing the race on the lead lap and one more a lap behind, these would be the only drivers to receive points that race.

I really do not see any negatives to the point system I suggested. As I mentioned, it will inflate the points tables, but they are already inflated anyway, but it puts extra importance on the race win with a large points difference between 1st and 2nd, with a massive points difference between 1st and, say 11th and below. This still means that, despite having points to fight for in the lower positions, compared to what the front runners are going to get it is still night and day difference. Sure, I would be open to suggestions for the actual points payouts but the biggest thing for me is that all drivers, within reason, have something to fight for whilst ensuring the importance of winning the race over 2nd place.

What do you think? Do you think the points system needs a revision, if so what do you think of my suggestion?","[""Personally, I like the Moto GP points system.

The current system is too random for the slower teams, with a single 10th position being infinitely more valuable than consistently finishing 11th in terms of the standings. You see a similar problem when comparing points between teammates where single standout events skew the points drastically. A bonus for winning is good, but other than that I think the points system should be more proportional than it is today.\xa0', ""I just think it's stupid that there's no points past P10.
