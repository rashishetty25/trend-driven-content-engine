1jndvqa,The Curious Case of Nico Hulkenberg's Dominant 06-07 A1GP Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jndvqa/the_curious_case_of_nico_hulkenbergs_dominant/,2025-03-30, Throwback,"I would like to introduce you to the most interesting season driven by an F1 junior in recent memory.

When we think about the junior ladder to F1, we have known it for the last 2-3 decades to be a relatively standardized process. The natural progression of the ladder has generally been:

National F4 (\~150-200hp) -> Regional F3 (\~200-400hp) -> International F2 (\~400-600hp) -> F1

There have been variations over the years, competing series like Formula Renault 2.0/3.5, the introduction of GP3/F3 creating an international F3 step, and so on, but the general process has stayed consistent. There have been drivers who skipped steps (Verstappen skipping F4 and F2, or Antonelli skipping F3), but most drivers have followed this process as a tried and true method of getting to Formula 1.

If we look at Nico Hulkenberg's junior career through the feeder ranks, he followed a similar progression (Note: every series past German F3 has 1 qualifying per 2 races):

2005: Formula BMW ADAC (\~140hp) - 1st Place, 8 wins, 14 podiums, 9 poles in 20 races  
2006: German Formula 3 (\~200hp) - 5th Place, 1 win, 6 podiums, 3 poles in 18 races  
2007: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 3rd Place, 4 wins, 8 podiums, 2 poles in 20 races  
2008: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 1st Place, 7 wins, 8 podiums, 6 poles in 20 races  
2009: GP2 Series (\~600hp) - 1st Place, 5 wins, 10 podiums, 3 poles in 20 races

Nico followed a generally standard progression up the ranks, winning a title at a level before making the step up, and winning F3/F2 back to back, the classic marker of a top tier prospect. You may have noticed, however, that I omitted his A1GP season, so lets go ahead and give that an introduction. A1 Grand Prix (A1GP) was an international single-seater series that ran from 2005 to 2009, featuring teams representing nations. The series had a grid of professional drivers in identical cars with a Lola chassis and a Zytek 3.4L V8 producing \~550hp.

Lets add that series into the progression to see how it looks:

2005: Formula BMW ADAC (\~140hp) - 1st Place, 8 wins, 14 podiums, 9 poles in 20 races  
2006: German Formula 3 (\~200hp) - 5th Place, 1 win, 6 podiums, 3 poles in 18 races  
**2006 - 2007: A1 Grand Prix (\~550hp) - 1st Place, 9 wins, 14 podiums, 3 poles in 20 races**  
2007: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 3rd Place, 4 wins, 8 podiums, 2 poles in 20 races  
2008: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 1st Place, 7 wins, 8 podiums, 6 poles in 20 races  
2009: GP2 Series (\~600hp) - 1st Place, 5 wins, 10 podiums, 3 poles in 20 races

Yes, you are reading that right. **Nico Hulkenberg, a 19 year old F3 driver, during a random winter in the middle of his standard 3 year regional Formula 3 progression, was chosen to represent Germany in an international series with professional drivers in cars with \~550hp and double the downforce. And in only his second year racing cars, he absolutely DOMINATED the field.**

When I say dominated, I don’t mean that lightly. Here are some highlights from this season:

**Round 1: Netherlands (First Weekend, First Victory)**

In his first feature race at Zandvoort, Nico put together an absolutely incredible drive in dry to wet to dry conditions. In a car with more than double the power, and performing his first career pit stops, Nico drove a flawless race, making up 10 seconds in the final dry stint over USA's Phil Giebler to take victory by 7 seconds.

**Round 4: Malaysia (Best Drive...Possibly Ever?)**

After taking second in the sprint race to start the weekend, Nico Hulkenberg put together what you might be able to argue is his greatest career drive. In extreme wet conditions at Sepang, in a race full of professional drivers with identical cars, Nico Hulkenberg **won the race by 43 seconds**. Yes, 4 3. And the cherry on top? He stalled his car at the pit stop and lost 8 seconds. Absolute masterclass. Don't believe me? Watch this: [https://youtu.be/ePmM8Dipz-Q?si=Bnk8jrP9cUGxOCrz&t=4378](https://youtu.be/ePmM8Dipz-Q?si=Bnk8jrP9cUGxOCrz&t=4378)

**Round 6: New Zealand (Grand Slam #1)**

During his first trip racing in the southern hemisphere, Nico Hulkenberg put together an incredible run of form, starting at Taupo. Pole, Sprint Race Win/Fastest Lap, Feature Race Win/Fastest Lap. Another absolute slaughtering of the field, this time in dry conditions and by only a mere 20 seconds: [https://youtu.be/P1ZIQ7Vqd2E?si=kvg1blcZB2ziR1Hl&t=5774](https://youtu.be/P1ZIQ7Vqd2E?si=kvg1blcZB2ziR1Hl&t=5774)

**Round 7: Australia (Grand Slam #2)**

Back to back Grand Slams? Yes indeed. Another brand new circuit for Hulkenberg at Eastern Creek Raceway, another Pole, Sprint Win/Fastest Lap, Feature Race Win/Fastest Lap. The field ran him a bit closer this weekend but he still pulled out a 6 second gap in the feature race to drive home the point.

**Round 8: South Africa (Almost Grand Slam #3)**

Hulkenberg is on a fantastic run, but there's a new twist: street circuit. Racing on the streets of Durban proves no challenge for Nico, who's third Grand Slam in a row was only foiled by losing the fastest lap at the end of feature race. In another filthy display of dominance, Hulkenberg built a 22 second lead in the feature race, had his lead evaporate to a safety car restart with 13 laps to go, and still won by 10 seconds to take his **6th victory in a row**: [https://youtu.be/wbhHXcF7UyY?si=GIzPhXGFwunaRq2F&t=4682](https://youtu.be/wbhHXcF7UyY?si=GIzPhXGFwunaRq2F&t=4682)

**Round 11: United Kingdom (Perfect Finale)**

Having missed Round 9 in Mexico for Euro F3 testing, Hulkenberg returned at round 10 in Shanghai to take 2 third places and seal the championship. At the final feature race at Brands Hatch, Nico drove a phenomenal defensive race to retain the lead with the UK's Robbie Kerr breathing down his neck from start to finish, sealing his 9th victory and 14th podium in just 20 race starts. His victory cost the UK second place in the championship to New Zealand by 1 point.

**Result: Champions**

Nico's outstanding performance throughout this season singlehandedly won the 2006-2007 A1GP championship for Germany. His 9 wins in 20 starts set the series record for most wins and most laps led, which he held until Neel Jani finally surpassed his record to set the final A1GP record at 10 wins...in 60 starts. Nico's performance was a victory for his manager who placed him in the series, Willi Weber, who also happened to be the manager of Michael Schumacher. Weber's confidence in his young German talent was so much that Weber happened to miss Schumacher's final victory for Ferrari in Shanghai to be at Hulkenberg's first A1GP race at Zandvoort.

Curiously, Hulkenberg's performance in this championship did not accelerate his passage through the junior ranks as it may have today. Weber kept him on track, continuing the standard route of the 220hp F3 Euro series for 2007, leading to dominant championships in Euro F3 in 2008 and GP2 in 2009 before going on to have one of the most unique Formula 1 careers in history.

It was purely a teams championship.\nAlso, not every driver was a seasoned professional, many were up and coming amateurs trying to make a name for themselves.  \n\nMost of the professionals were at the end of their careers, not the peak of them, and most teams swapped drivers during the seasons, so in many cases drivers were trying to come to terms with the cars handling qualities, as opposed to maximising their lap speed.\n\nSome of the professionals were relatively inexperienced driving open wheel cars, or hadn't driven one in a decade or more.  Even rally drivers were in the cars, usually quite quick but not great at actually racing.\n\nHulkenberg did become a name I knew during that season, and he was really strong and it did look like he'd be a talent to watch out for on his climb to F1, but it wasn't a clear sign he'd even get there, let alone anything indicating he'd be particularly good in F1.\nCertainly GP2 was a better indicator."", 'Shocking bad luck in F1 to never have a podium.

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
