First time getting to experience F1 in person, and what an overwhelming first day it’s been! 

I’d love to hear all your first time experiences seeing F1 up close. Did you expect it to be so loud, the smell of rubber and exhaust to be so strong, and get that electrifying feeling when that rush of air comes towards you and growling engine to whiz past you? 

I never thought I’d be lucky enough to see some top tier engineering and skill up close like that, and I hope more people get to access things like this in life. Remember to say “yes” when experiences come knocking at your door, whether big or small 😄 

Thanks all ","['I hate that the broadcasts completely neuter the sense of speed in favor of sponsor closeups. This is awesome, thanks for sharing!', ""You didn't see anything 😅"", ""I've only seen it on TV. Congratulations man You are lucky. Don't forget to put the phone down sometimes."", 'You missed the V12 era. Unlucky', 'My first time was the USGP at Indy in 2004.  I’ll never forget that sound.  Standing along the end of the front straight, almost as close as this shot, with those V10’s screaming by at 20,000RPM in 6th gear and 200mph just to watch them drop anchor at the 50M board down to 50mph for turn one was a absolute thrill.  \n\nThen the next day watching from the top of J Stand outside the sector one turn complex.  The way those cars changed direction, accelerated, slowed, then zipped away again was incredible.  The only time I’ve seen something accelerate faster was Top Fuel and Funny Cars in NHRA.\n\nI was able to see them the next two years, including the infamous 2005 race with only 6 cars making the start.  I work in the automotive repair industry and have been lucky to get access that most don’t. At the 2006 USGP I was in the Shell Oil suite alongside not only their executives, but also top personnel from Ferrari. I’ve had garage access to multiple IndyCar and NASCAR events, including sitting on the pit box with Jr Motorsports at and Xfinity race at Indy in 2021.', '1981 Montreal in the pouring rain. Greatest day of my life at that point.', 'I was in Austria a few years back (the year Sainz\'s engine decide to blow up and catch fire). The first day me and my dad tried to get as near to the track as possible, but we saw basically nothign but a second of the cars, kind of like in your video clip.\n\nDuring raceday we took a more ""off-aproach"", a bit back, about 1/3 down of the straight after corner 3. It was the most surreal experience I\'ve ever had, seeing cars far away in corner 1, seeing the cars race past after corner 3, and also having full view of corner 6-7. It was amazing.\n\nWhat I remember best was looking at Sainz\'s car as he raced past, and seeing that initial ""poof"" from the engine. I immediately recognised that the engine had failed. Yet it took pretty much everyone else around me 5-10 seconds more to realise it, until they saw it on the big screen. At that point it felt truly special to have been there at the track, knowing it before everyone around me, and knowing it probably four times that before everyone on television and in the more expensive stands knew it.', 'Wow!', ""Oh man, I'm so sorry @OP - this makes me appreciate Albert Park so much.

There's an Excel and Numbers version. I've never used Limewire so I hope it works.

At the bottom, you can **toggle the results** of Max's, Lando's, and Oscar's final races to check all the permutations of finishes to see who becomes WC.

I hardcoded a few (unlikely) scenarios where:

* Max finishes P1 in all the remaining GPs and the Sprint, Oscar finishes all P2, and Lando finishes all P3. That one doesn't change the current standings.
* Max finishes P2 in all the remaining GPs and the Sprint. Oscar and Lando score 0 points. Max wins by 12 points.
* Max finishes P3 in all the remaining GPs and the Sprint. Oscar and Lando score 0 points. Max wins by 2 points.
* Max finishes P2 in one GP and P1 in the remaining races. Lando finishes in P2/P3/P7/P6. Lando still wins.
