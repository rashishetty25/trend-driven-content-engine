1ololgl,Do you think this year will be more closely contested than 2021?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ololgl/do_you_think_this_year_will_be_more_closely/,2025-11-01, Discussion,"Man, Norris and Piastri are very close, and then there's Verstappen who's slowly catching up... And there are only 4 more GPs left!
And that's just one point that differentiates Piastri from Norris! And if I'm not mistaken, since 2021 when we had Hamilton vs. Verstappen, we haven't had such a competitive season.","[""I don't see it being better than two drivers having equal points at the start of the last race.\n\nDepends if you put having three drivers still in the championship race above that, even if they aren't equal."", ""2021 was a 0 point difference between Verstappen and Hamilton going into Abu Dhabi, I'm not sure it can get more close than that"", 'Do I think two drivers will be level on points going into the final race of the year? No.\xa0', 'How can it be closer than a season that came down to the final race', 'Verstappen and Hamilton were both a level above the rest during 2021. More often than not they were P1 and P2 a long way ahead of the rest. Piastri and Norris performances just haven’t been similar to that.', 'This season mighr be close in points...but it\'s not really ""contested"". 2021 had drivers pretty much be 1-2 every race of the year. This year it feels more like a competition of who\'s trying to throw harder. There\'s almost no fighting between them, just alternating slumps with most races outcome decided by lap 1.\n\nFirst half of 2022 was far more competitive and engaging than this', '2021 felt like an actual fight. 2 cars with entirely different designs, the top 2 drivers consistently getting P1 and P2 in every race because that had to be done, constantly fighting each other in nearly every race (including that epic last lap), the teammates actually being useful (no infighting or big gaps) and that zero point difference in the final race. That is the closest you can get.', ""I'd be surprised if both McLaren drivers aren't within a shot of the title in the final race. It is *probably* more likely that Max falls out of contention the round prior.\n\nIt'll quote possibly be like 2010 where there were three drivers with a reasonable chance of the championship in the final race. I know where were four drivers still in contention at the start of the final race but Hamilton would have needed both to win the race with the Red Bulls and Alonso not scoring, extremely unlikely."", ""It can't be closer even IF they are all on the same points unless there are also literally right behind each other on the final lap"", 'No']",1495,218,0.91,1495,7883,7883,20,5,0.0,20
1olp3sq,Can F1 Drivers Guess The Circuit From Just The Steering Wheel?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1olp3sq/can_f1_drivers_guess_the_circuit_from_just_the/,2025-11-01, Video,,"[""The only one I was able to guess right was Singapore, but through Lewis' helment. But then again, that shiny thing would be visible from international space station, lol."", 'The editing of this is ATROCIOUS for playing along at home. Spa doesn’t start with a chicane. Montreal doesn’t have a single corner to start the lap. It really ruins the video for me and I enjoy/do pretty well at Grill the Grid videos.', ""Guessed Silverstone right, sweeping mids to a tight right hander to a left hairpin.\n\nBut the Spa didn't make sense at all. Right turn, about 90 which makes sense but  then immediately turning left? Like.. Bahrain."", ""I would imagine all do rather well here, the amount of laps with the sim they would've done at all these tracks haha"", ""It's really annoying to see them start in the corners *prior* to the start finish straight! To the point that Canada would be unguessable on the onboards!"", ""Its so annoying that they didn't do the ones at the end from the start, I only got Suzuka and Spa wrong before the final few. \n\nSim racing definitely helps for this sort of thing."", 'I agree with Nando, Spa feels wrong hahaha.', 'I got 4, with the tips and lots of replays lol. BUT, the clips did not start from the start/finish line. SPA is the one the broke most of them because of this', ""It bugs me that they're showing the end of the tracks and not the beginning. It's the beginning that the drivers are watching."", 'they said it would start at the start/finish line but Spa starts before bus stop and the next clip they start with the steering wheel completely upside down, no wonder people arent guessing correctly.']",197,23,0.9,197,543,543,4,0,0.0,4
