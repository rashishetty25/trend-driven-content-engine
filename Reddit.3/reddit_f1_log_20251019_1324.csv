1oa4sqv,It was a racing incident.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oa4sqv/it_was_a_racing_incident/,2025-10-18, Discussion,"So the divers involved in the T1 crash are Alonso, Hülkenberg, Piastri and Norris. 

Norris gets a bad start, Piastri gets alongside him, Norris brakes late into T1 so Piastri goes for the switchback and colides with Hülkenberg which results in the multi car crash.

1. Lando is completly innocent the only thing he did is having a bad start which puts Oscar in the positon of a switchback.

2. I also would say Oscar is innocent he leaves enough space for 1 car on the inside of T1 while going for the switchback to overtake lando. The drivers don't see a lot in these cars i would be suprised if oscar saw Nico going down his inside and he definetly didn't know alonso was on the inside of nico.

3. Nico has no fault he has to stick his nose down the inside of Piastri if he doesnt Alonso just drives past him once he's between alonso and Piastri he has nowhere to go.

4. Alonso also isn't at fault the inside is wide open and he is alongside Nico at the apex.

To summerise it's an unfortunate racing incident. The situation starts unfolding because lando had a slow start and the contact starts because Oscar goes for the switchback. With the benefit of hindsight Oscar shouldn't have went for the switchback but I think he did nothing wrong in the moment. I mean they are 4 wide at one point. (see picture)

To anyone saying oscar is at fault remember 2022 where Russel and Sainz had contact. Sainz also turned in harder than he had to and Russel runs into the side of him everyone blamed Russel for that one. Of course there are strong differences between the 2 incidents but I think you can draw some parallels. Lastly he has to go for it they are fighting for a championship and Lando is his main rival going past him also puts him in the optimal position to potentially attack Max later in the race and also makes sure that Lando can't go for the win. 

I would be interested in your opinions.","['its definitely the evil genius design of turn 1 that leaves it open for many incidents to happen like this', 'I think anyone sane would tell you it\'s a racing incident really, especially since we know F1 rules are (imo rightfully) a bit more easy on any lap 1 incident. I think that a lot of people see this incident with a ""papaya rules"" vision, because it has been the talk in the town for a few gp now, especially recently with the ""punishment"" on Norris, and if you punish Norris for what happened at Singapore (a racing incident in T3), you either remove his punishment or put one on Oscar here, but them putting the blame on Hulkenberg is kinda hilarious.', ""As far as the stewards are concerned it is a racing incident within the rules of racing. \n\nHowever. \n\nThere are places where you can put your car where it is more likely to be in a racing incident, and places you can put your car where it is less likely to be in a racing incident. \n\nPiastri put his car in a place where an incident was more likely, and the result cost both his and Norris' Championship battle against Verstappen, although chances are it won't make a difference."", ""Racing incident because it was lap 1, turn 1.. doesn't change that Oscar is the one going for a switchback with complete disregard for everyone else.. real ''I turn now, good luck everybody else'' vibes."", 'I’d say 100% stay where you are when doing that turn would have saved the day for all of them… Oscar was stupid for going for a switchback when he KNOWS there’s another 17 cars behind them trying to squeeze in that corner, its one thing to do it on lap 2 onwards when you have more clearance from the ones behind but not here on turn1 lap 1. Completely misjudged it and finished the race for all 4 basically. Much worse than what Lando did in Singapore (Which could have had the same fate but luckily didn’t). \n\nTrying to blame this on Hulkenberg when he clearly has a huge gap to fit in on the left of Lando and all of a sudden gets hit by Oscar’s switchback is just stupid, own your mistakes, shit happens, learn from it, apologize and move on.', 'r/formula1 owe Russell an apology apparently.', ""Gonna get massively downvoted for this but,\n\n\nIf this was Norris, you guys would call for his head\n\n\nEDIT: well, this doesn't pan out as I had written"", ""I sim race a lot in iRacing.\xa0\n\n\nNo matter what, the concertina effect is going to bunch up all the cars in turn 1, every single time, as the person in front will stop a little past their full speed braking marker, causing the car behind to brake before their ideal marker, moving the cars back, etc. It's why it's so easy to make up places in the first couple of turns on any track because while people are being forced to brake and take the corner way differently, you might find an opening to get on the throttle WAY before they can and get ahead.\xa0\n\n\nOne of the FIRST Turn 1 lessons you start to figure out in the sim Rookie series is that leaving a car width or more open on the inside will guarantee that a car appears there. You'll have to brake because of a car ahead of you, but you've allowed someone else to not have to brake, so they'll take the opening. If you move over into the door you've left wide open, you WILL hit someone. In any T1 that can fit more than 1 car wide, you HAVE to hold your line through it or assume someone will be there. You don't have the capacity to be within centimeters of the car ahead of you and be in your mirrors at the same time.\xa0\n\n\nOscar fucked up.\xa0"", ""Last week people were calling for Lando to be executed publicly for a love tap of the wheels on lap 1 in a blatant lap 1 standard racing incident, now everyone is couching their opinions on this?

1. Winning everything from now til AB, and even without being his fan I can totally see him doing it, the other part of this factor is the car, looks strong, but there is high variety on the remaining tracks, Mexico's altitude, Brazil rain, ME heat, etc. Demands the car to adapt and beat McLaren car in different conditions, and that's a big ask.

2. Finishing VERNORPIA every race till AB, the arrive for a triple header decider, but people is dismissing George Russell as a factor, he have the speed and the consistency to race for the remaining podiums, and in the right conditions like Vegas low grip, Mexico altitude and brasil cold could suit the merc car, so he will be in the mix for the top points effectively affecting the McLaren points intake, and changing the outcome of the WDC.

It would be so funny if George turns into the de-facto teammate for Max after all their headbutting. Max and Red Bull need to be smart to lure George into helping them, George want the best result possible doesn't matter who wins, so if they are able to make the race dynamics  VERRUS vs NORPIA instead of a 3v1 or McLarens vs Max, while keeping Max first George second when possible,  could be key for Max ambitions for the WDC.

In the weeks since his departure, The Sunday Times understands that Horner has been approached by several leading investors from around the world, keen to collaborate. Sources suggest he now has enough capital to buy anything from up to 100 per cent of a Formula 1 team, if and when the opportunity were to arise. Those funds would not be enough to buy any of the “big four” teams: McLaren, Mercedes, Ferrari or Red Bull.\n\nIt would mean, however, it was a possibility to buy one of several others on the grid — even the smallest teams are thought to be worth about £1.5billion. It has been reported that a Chinese-backed bid for Racing Bulls of more than £2billion was rejected by Red Bull GmbH recently. Despite Cowell’s comments, the possibility of Horner investing in Aston Martin is not entirely over, sources suggest.\n\nTherein lies the waiting game that Horner and his investors are playing. Having the funds to buy a stake, or an entire team, is only the first piece of the puzzle. The timing and the project need to neatly fit together. Finances are pivotal in Formula 1, but they are no guarantee, given the health of the sport and the number of people looking to invest.', 'Sounds like made up journalism because there isn’t enough real news for journalists to report on.', ""I'd like to see him buy into Haas and guide a possible future Toyota factory team.\n\nHaas in the current form feels pretty boring."", 'Rich Energy may be coming back to the grid!', ""I mean, do we really think it's a coincidence that Horner left and Red Bull is suddenly back on top?\n\nIf you believe AWS, it's not just Max.

Thursday- fp1 and fp2

Friday- sq and sprint

Saturday- fp3 and quali

Sunday- race

A few obvious things with this like you wouldn't be able to do this in back to back race weekends and you'd need to give teams more tyres, and some people would miss the sprint if its a Friday instead of a Saturday. Instead though this gives teams a full amount of practices and a practice before qualifying, as well as a short parc ferme for the sprint instead of teams not being able to work on the cars overnight. 

Everyone is at the paddock on thursday anyways for media, and maybe the sprints could be longer this way too. That way we could see actual tyre deg and maybe erratic one stops on softs. This is probably marginal but drivers could focus on the sprint without needed to save energy for qualifying later that day as well","['With the increased race schedule - F1 took a step back and reduced the weekend primarily to Friday to Sunday, to ensure the 80-100 people working trackside and traveling to most races would have a breather day in between.
