1nf2lo9,"Please be respectful to the race organizers and understand why Verstappen's Porsche is ""detuned""",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nf2lo9/please_be_respectful_to_the_race_organizers_and/,2025-09-12, Discussion,"There are several publications, among which Motorsport.com, claiming Max Verstappen won't be able to win the GT4 class in the Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie tomorrow, because his Porsche is ""detuned"".

First, the NLS doesn't have a GT4 class. GT4-spec cars are split up into a bunch of different categories, like SP8T for turbocharged GT4-cars with specially designed parts (i.e. Bilstein suspension on Jimmy Broadbent's car) and SP10 for SRO-homologated GT4-cars (SRO is the licenceholder of GT4).

Verstappen's Porsche is entered in the CUP3 GUEST class, which is a separate class for detuned Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport cars. He is not competing against other GT4 cars. If his Porsche were not detuned, it wouldn't be a Permit B car and to get his Permit A ('GT3 licence'), he has to drive a Permit B car first.

Due to articles like Motorsport.com wrote, there have been several hate comments directed towards the NLS organizers, because Verstappen fans think his Porsche is nerfed to slow him down and what not and that it's unfair. Please be respectful and do your research.","['Half the argument on here are between folks who don’t understand F1 rules. You want us to understand multi-classes?', 'I’m just glad the GT4 class is getting some love.\n\nSince you’re correcting bad “nerf” takes, can we call you a nerf herder?', 'Man, it would genuinely never strike me to get *angry* with the organizing body of another motorsport class that a particular driver has *chosen* to join, because I think it might not be showing his ""utter domination"" properly.

There is a SRO GT4 class, which is SP10, no other class is properly GT4.\n\nSP8T is for race cars with a turbocharged engines between 2.6L and 4L, which include non-homologated GT4 cars.\n\nCUP3 is for Porsche Cayman GT4 Trophy cars, which as you put it is separate, and doesn't use cars homologated for SRO GT4.\n\nAlso, theorically, there could be GT4 in other categories, with for example the A110 GT4(+) could be entered in the SP3T category with its 1.8L engine."", 'Not surprising at all.

The annual **Goodwood Revival** event has kicked off earlier today, and as per usual it features various retro era F1 machinery as well as numerous notable names from the sport. As such, I wanted to make a sort of PSA post, similar to the one I've made a few months back for the Festival of Speed, so people around here are made aware of the Revival and tune in for some nice classic racing

For those of you new to Goodwood - it's a large-scale event held in Chichester, England that covers all things ""speed"", hence the name of the *main* attraction, the Festival of Speed, dating back to the late 1990s. Over the years Goodwood has expanded beyond the scope of the FOS to two additional events: the Members Meeting, consisting primarily of the Goodwood Racing Club members gathering to drive cars, both fast and slow, new and old, and the Revival, dedicated to decades long gone, invoking the first half of the 20th Century, and this post is covering precisely that.

Unlike the FOS however you won't be seeing *all* kinds of F1 cars, instead giving the spotlight to vehicles ranging from pre-war Bathtubs on Wheels and up to the 1960s, but the action is still very much worth watching into even if you're not a petrolhead and check out F1 on occasion.

Here's how the scheduling for this year's Revival looks F1-wise:

Event Name | Main Theme | Featured Cars | Date & Time
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
**Goodwood Trophy** | Celebrating the post-war grids that lined up during the early years of the Motor Circuit in the late 1940s and early ‘50s, bringing together some of the oldest cars at the Revival | Grand Prix and Voiturette cars from 1930 to all the way to 1951, with an entry list that includes ERAs, Maseratis and Alfa Romeos that pre-date the F1 World Championship | Practice on Sept 12th @ 12:05 UTC // Race on Sept 13th @ 09:35 UTC
**Richmond & Gordon Trophy** | Bringing back to life a golden era of Formula 1 racing, and resulting in a mixed grid of differing approaches to the business of Grand Prix racing | A selection of 2.5-litre Grand Prix cars that raced between 1952-60, with machines hailing from a variety of manufacturers, including but not limited to the heavier Maserati 250Fs and Ferrari 246s, racing against the forward-thinking BRMs and Lotuses | Practice on Sept 12th @ 15:45 // Race on Sept 14th @ 17:10 UTC
**Glover Trophy** | Celebrating the proud history of Formula 1 racing at the Goodwood Motor Circuit, and a tribute to one of F1’s most popular non-Championship races with a grid evoking one of the most romantic eras of the sport. | A grid of 1.5-litre Grand Prix cars that raced between 1961-’65, such as the Lotus 25, as well as Cooper, BRM and Ferrari vehicles all making their mark on track | Practice on Sept 12th @ 16:50 UTC // Race on Sept 14th @ 15:55 UTC
**Jim Clark Tribute** | Paying tribute to the man who is often regarded as the greatest racing driver of all time on the 60th anniversary of his second World Drivers’ Championship victory. | DKW Sonderklasse,  Lotus Elite, Jaguar D-Type, Lotus 18, Aston Martin DBR1, Lotus 25, Lotus 49, Ford GT40, Lotus Cortina, and more | Track Parade on Sept 12th @ 11:40 UTC, Sept 13th @ 13:50 UTC, and Sept 14th @ 11:50 UTC
**Alfa Romeo Celebration** | Giving those in attendance the opportunity to experience many of the great stories across Alfa Romeo's rich racing and automotive history first hand, with a wide variety of machinery set to take part in a dynamic parade throughout the weekend | Alfa Romeo RL, P2, Tipo B, 6C, 8C, 158 Alfetta, Giulietta SZ, Giulia TZ and GTA,  Tipo 33, and more | Track Parade on Sept 12th @ 15:25 UTC, Sept 13th @ 16:10 UTC, and Sept 14th @ 16:40 UTC

Beyond that, various F1 personalities will also be present at the Revival, competing in the races held during this weekend, including (but not limited to) **Jenson Button, Jacques Villeneuve, Karun Chandhok, Max Chilton, Érik Comas, and Adrian Newey**

For the full timetable, you can visit [this link](https://www.goodwood.com/motorsport/goodwood-revival/plan-your-day/timetable/), and the official broadcasts can be accessed via YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd_wMcXJiGw)

Also, keep in mind that the livestream will be running all weekend-long, with a full replay of each day starting immedaitely as soon as the live coverage concludes, while the VODs for Days 1-3 will be uploaded separately on Goodwood channel at a later date (usually around 10-14 days after)

Of course the Revival itself isn't limited to *just* Formula 1, and in fact there's much more to check out from the same time periods but different racing series. Again, refer to the full timetable if you're interested

I absolutely love formula 1 and cars in general, and my dream is to one day become an F1 commentator. 

My English is close to native level, and I’ve been told I have great diction. But due to the current gender conflict/polarizations in South Korea, I started questioning my dream. Would being a woman be a barrier if I try to pursue commentary in F1? Or are there any similar examples? I’d really appreciate your thoughts and advice. ","[""Within Korea, or elsewhere? I don't think being a woman is a disadvantage, but its a long way up the ladder to do F1. If you can get invovled in broadcasting or any smaller, local events in your area that would be a start to get into the community and develop your skills."", ""Alex Jacques could be a good inspiration as he isn't like Coulthard or Palmer who were actual F1 drivers before.

Best of luck!"", ""F1TV's lead commentator is a woman, I don't think that's an issue anymore\n\nbut getting into F1 is very difficult, you need to go through many sports below that before even having a chance, like the drivers or marshalls would have to do"", ""Never say never but realistically its very slim chances to get to that point especially when you have no experience in racing or connections otherwise, you come from country with small F1 following and on top of that you're a woman.
