Someone else has already taken the fall so even if Tsunoda comes in and generates the worst outcomes like crashing the car every outing, we won’t put it on him as we know:

a) the car is problematic. 
b) He has had a good season start in another car. 
c) another driver has failed in it. 
d) It’ll be awful PR for Redbull to shop for another driver, they’ll have to give him time. 
e.) even if they wanted to shop for a new driver, they’re out of options as far as car development experience goes unless they want to extend an invitation to Daniel Riccardio (very unlikely i think he is done with F1) 

In summary, there’s no performance level that he can exhibit from here on out that threatens his seat till the end of this season at least.

2.	⁠He has nothing to lose, his contract with Racing Bulls runs out this year with no clear potential to join any other team on the current grid.

Hulkenberg completely lost the rear on seemingly normal acceleration on the exit of T3/4, having to save multiple severe oversteer moments that put him into the gravel, damaging his floor and effectively ending his race. Later on in the lap, Bortoleto was in a battle with Bearman, and turned in relatively normally into T8 and instantly lost the rear in a basically unsavable moment that put him into the gravel, taking him out of race contention as well.

Both of these moments can be viewed here: [https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z\_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68](https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68)

If one of these drivers had experienced this alone, it would be easy to put it down to driver error. However, the appearance of a similar issue on both cars in the first lap in seemingly innocuous moments when the drivers weren't even trying to make a move, leads me to believe that there was potentially some sort of issue on the car, or more specifically, the tyre preparation plan that the team had in place during the formation lap (ie number of burnouts, target tyre temp).

In terms of pure numbers, the 18-year-old hadn\'t really delivered a particularly outstanding performance. The Italian started in eighth place, and he crossed the finish line in eighth place as well. He was 53.7 seconds behind winner Piastri and 42.6 seconds behind George Russell in the sister car.\n\n> The disqualification of the two Ferraris subsequently pushed the youngster up to sixth place. After the race, the youngster revealed that he had sustained damage to the underbody somewhere, which was affecting his pace. Given this, the Silver Arrows driver\'s performance naturally had to be reassessed. The only question that remained was how and where the underbody was damaged.\n\n> After a detailed analysis of the TV images and an examination of the car, chief engineer Andrew Shovlin provided the solution a few days late: ""Leclerc had hit Lewis\'s right rear wheel. The end plate of his front wing broke off. Kimi saw this, but unfortunately he couldn\'t avoid it because other cars were next to him. He drove over the debris, which flew under the car and damaged the deflectors at the entrance to the underbody.""\n\n> Damage costs two to three tenths.\nThis sensitive area of \u200b\u200bthe car has a significant impact on aerodynamics and, consequently, performance. However, the loss of downforce was difficult to quantify, Shovlin regrets: ""It definitely cost a lot of performance. It would be easier to calculate how much it affected the lap time if we had already completed a few laps. But here it happened on the very first lap, so we can only estimate it. Based on the aerodynamic data, we estimate that the loss of downforce cost two to three tenths per lap.""\n\n> Another problem was that the damage affected only one side of the car. The loss of downforce was particularly noticeable on the rear axle. ""Kimi quickly got on the radio and complained that he had no grip at the rear. As a result, the tires started to slide, they overheated, and lost grip. He struggled with this problem for most of the race. During the pit stop, we were only able to alleviate it slightly with the front wing,"" said Shovlin.\n\n> There\'s more to come from Kimi. \nIn the end, the driver had to somehow deal with it himself: ""When you have that kind of damage to your car, it can result in inconsistent handling. Depending on the corner or wind direction, it\'s sometimes better or worse. The balance shifts in different directions. He really did a good job there. But of course, it was a bit frustrating when you saw his strong pace at the beginning of the weekend. He was battling with the two Ferraris and with Max.""\n\n> Overall, Shovlin gives his young protégé a glowing review for his start with the factory team: ""He\'s a brilliant fit for our team. It was quite difficult to succeed a driver as successful as Lewis. Everyone here in the team enjoys working with Kimi. And he\'s just having fun. Melbourne was particularly difficult with the rain in the first race. But he adapted well. I think there\'s a lot more to come from Kimi.""', 'So glad to let him play with puzzles.

Please [direct these to the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/formula1) instead.","['Do the engineers or pit wall people have any control over the cars while it’s out on the track or do they just receive data from the car?', ""So everyone is discussing Yuki's promotion, but I feel out of the loop; what happens to Liam?"", 'would Ferrari drop Leclerc if Verstappen said he would like to drive for Ferrari?', 'Bottas testing for Mclaren really flying under the radar', '**Am I the only one who thinks that everyone (including Red Bull) is overreacting about how ""bad"" Liam Lawson really is?**  \n  \nI feel like I keep seeing things where people are like ""oh Liam\'s about to do horrible in Japan, his career is over"" and just hate for Liam. Liam is a very quick driver, faster than other drivers that have been on, and are on, the grid. I think it\'s just the Red Bull being an extremely peaky car, which is very difficult to handle.\n\nMax Verstappen is by far the #1 driver at Red Bull. Every decision they make, with drivers and the car, they think about how that might affect Verstappen (e.g. not singing Carlos Sainz in 2024 for fears that he might be too much of an adversary for Verstappen). This also means, that the way the car is developed, and the way the setup is tweaked, all kind of revolves around Verstappen.\n\nMax Verstappen has a very unique driving style, which is different from most other drivers on the grid, where he prefers a very sharp car which tends to oversteer rather than understeer. Drivers like Sergio Perez prefer a understeering car, as it can be handled easier. The Red Bull simply tends to have more oversteer than understeer, which was detrimental for Perez\'s pace (among other factors). That just isn\'t very easy to fix with just a setup change.\n\nAlong with the more oversteering car, (which I believe is just simply not Lawson\'s driving style) the Red Bull is just simply, in general, a very knife-edge and unknown car. We saw this in 2023 and 2024, mostly from McLaren, as they also suffered from this, but we are now seeing it with the RB21. Anyone who watched onboards from Red Bull during testing, and FP1 and FP2 in Australia, could see how the car just understeers on entrance, and then oversteers on exit (or vice versa), and that ruined the car\'s pace. No one thought Red Bull would be quick in Australia after FP1/2, but then overnight, the mechanics seemed to have just found the golden setup, which transformed that Red Bull into a completely different car. For Verstappen.\n\nMy point is, the car is just very very difficult to drive. We can see and hear it from the drivers often. I think we\'re going to see Yuki Tsunoda suffering from the exact same issues as Lawson, but he\'ll probably still be able to extract a little more performance from the car. Verstappen himself has said that Lawson will probably do better in the RB than in the Red Bull. (no source sorry)\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I know I just gave a lot of yap and half of it probably either is wrong or not relevant, but please let me know what you think!', 'I have already asked a few questions about the MGUK, but I have one more.\n\nPersonally, I find it unfortunate that there is no energy recovery on the front wheels. But can the MGUK be made so energy-recovering/efficient that a front MGUK is not needed? Especially with the upcoming regulation changes in 2026.\n\nOr is this actually already possible but simply limited by regulations?', 'Obviously with Yuki now replacing Liam, could (in theory) any team replace their full-time driver with the reserve driver and can drive this switch teams mid season? (Apart from racing bulls to red bull)', ""So who's the red bull reserve driver now? Iirc yuki was RBR's reserve and Iwasa was reserve for VCARB"", ""Valtteri is a reserve for McLaren? Did everyone know that? I had no idea. I knew he was at WIlliams (and Merc obv), but McLaren too? He's doing a TPC test for McLaren at Barcelona today. \n\nYes, I know it makes sense because McLaren is a Merc customer team, but this is the first I've heard it made official."", ""I read through Lawson's messages with his engineer in China. He keeps mentioning he's using up too much of the tire to steer it into corners and how he can't follow close behind other drivers.\n\nIs he, like, incorrect about that, or is he driving the car in such a way that it causes him to use up more of the tire on each turn than Max does? \n\nI am aware Drive to Survive is staged TV. But they also had a bit in the show where they said he was 2 tenths off of Max in a test at Silverstone where they drove the same car, which seems difficult to fake. So what happened?""]",13,114,0.84,13,104,104,2,11,0.020000000000000018,2

Where only the Alien Verstappen can drive around a lot of those problems. Maybe also a couple of other top tier drivers in the sport. And even with that in mind it was the right choice to demote Lawson to a car that seems good to drive.
