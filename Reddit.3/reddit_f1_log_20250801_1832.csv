1mek52g,Hungarian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mek52g/hungarian_grand_prix/,2025-08-01, News,"Weather forecast for the weekend. This event in 2006 saw Button get his first F1 race win. 


The Hungarian Grand Prix in 2006 marked the last occasion the event was held in wet conditions. The track was already wet at the beginning of the race, making it a historic first for a wet Hungarian Grand Prix. 
All competitors started on intermediate tires, except for Barrichello, who opted for full wets. 

Early on, polesitter Kimi Räikkönen quickly established his lead. Both Alonso and Schumacher delivered impressive climbs through the field. Schumacher advanced from 11th to 6th by the first corner, while Alonso moved up from 15th with a notably aggressive and hard-fought opening lap. Alonso then engaged in a straight fight with Schumacher for several laps before executing a pass on the outside of Turn 5, securing 3rd place. He further progressed to take the lead after the McLaren drivers, Pedro de la Rosa and Räikkönen, made their pit stops. 

Traditionally, Bridgestone wet-weather tires were dominant in non-dry conditions, but in this race, the Japanese compound appeared to be an exception. All drivers using Bridgestone tires, including those from Ferrari, struggled with significantly reduced pace compared to their rivals. Schumacher found himself battling Giancarlo Fisichella for 5th place, ultimately losing his front wing in a mid-corner incident while fending off snap-oversteer, resulting in a forced pit stop that put him a lap down. Soon after, Jenson Button showcased remarkable overtaking prowess, passing Massa, Fisichella, and Schumacher in under two laps. Räikkönen, facing difficulties on his second set of tires, crashed into the rear of Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso, launching the car and necessitating a safety car period. This incident allowed Alonso to pit, enabling Schumacher to regain the lead lap. 
Another beneficiary of the safety car was Jenson Button, who chose not to pit and climbed to 2nd position behind Alonso. Following the safety car restart, Button challenged Alonso, but eventually had to pit for fuel. Alonso maintained the lead, but a subsequent pit stop for dry tires proved disastrous as his right-rear wheel nut detached, causing him to lose control and crash. 

Button inherited the lead and held it unchallenged for the remainder of the race. Schumacher made his way up to 2nd by remaining on intermediate tires as other drivers made further stops.

The dots represent the average speed delta (left axis) of the drivers compared to the fastest driver for each race, and the line represents the average speed of the team compared as a percentage the fastest team's speed (right axis).

It seems that most teams are still loosing ground to McLaren, with the exception of Sauber. Mercedes is hanging there without making much progress. Ferrari was the closest at the beginning of the season, but it's loosing ground as well.

Most changes on the sporting regulations are to largely bring them into line with the most recent updates (2025/04/30) of the 2025 regulations. Including the tyre regulations we had for Monaco this year.      
Some changes I did notice from a quick glance:       

* Grid drops at a driver's next race now have a 12 month period to serve them in. So Valtteri will be off the hook from his incident in the 2024 Abu Dhabi GP should he race next year.

* A document will be provided to all teams no later than the 30th June this year which details all the provisional information and limitations in regards to ERS-K usage and deployment for races, the following season. Any amendments will be confirmed by 15th September. Subsequent modifications may only be applied for new circuits or where this is a significant difference between vehicle fundamentals & FIA correlated values

* There is now a much easier to read list of Parc Ferme Permitted Works

I'm sure there are more. Same as well with the technical regulations.","[""\\>Grid drops at a driver's next race now have a 12 month period to serve them in.\n\nJenson Button return confirmed."", 'W for Bottas my fucking guy', ""What do you mean no later than June 30th?

The ERS-K power under full throttle must be above -250 kW instead of -100 kW', 'Adding a couple of points:\n\nThere are some changes to the limited components. Gearboxes have been made unlimited this year, and that will now be carried over to next year\'s cars. And there will be a new limited component group, PU-ANC (ancillary components), with a limit of 5 of each Power Unit ancillary component. So those should be specific components that are part of, for example, the ICE, but can now be changed without changing the ICE itself.\n\nAnd regarding energy management, I noticed that in the last issue of the regulations, **for qualifying only**, they increased the limit to the total allowable reduction of driver maximum power demand from 450kW to 600kW and the limit to the resulting electrical DC power of the ERS-K from above −100kW to above -250kW.\n\nWith this newest issue, the ""for qualifying only"" part has been removed.

1mf1y1e,Largest performance changes mid-season in F1 history,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mf1y1e/largest_performance_changes_midseason_in_f1/,2025-08-01, Discussion,"I wanted to discuss the largest shifts in performance midseason. In 2023, I recall how McLaren had a significant jump in performance mid-season, going from a midfield team to a consistent podium contender.

I’m curious if Ferrari, Mercedes, or Red Bull seem to have that in the cards this year, as it appeared that even McLaren in 2023 was not expecting the significant jump, which has also evolved into their dominance this year. I’m also cognizant that the regulation changes may mean that there is just less performance to get out of the car in 2025, than there was in ‘22 or ‘23.

Wondering if anyone else can point to other instances of this in F1 history, and share their own predictions for the rest of the season…","['mclaren is certainly one of the biggest ones in modern history, if not the biggest. They went from last to 2nd best\n\n  \nhowever, mclaren\'s improvement was not super unpredictable either, before the season start they already talked about how they went down the wrong path for the 23 car so they essentially just brought a 2022 car that had been modified to fit the new floor regulations, and that their actual 2023 car would come later in the year\n\nwhen that real 2023 car came, they went back to their usual place of ""best of the rest"" above aston martin. At that time mercedes and ferrari were still drinking industrial amounts of glue and sticking to their failed concepts so it also made mclaren and aston look a lot better', 'Mclaren did it before in 2009, Lewis went from 4 races basically finishing lapped to winning in Hungary after an upgrade they brought there', 'Brawn went from completely dominant and untouchable to 3rd quickest by the end\n\nJordan in 98 went from a point less slow team to one of the quickest mid season', 'This year it is highly unlikely.', 'Force india 2009 is one I remember.

It might be a coincidence but that's when the FIA reinforced the asymmetric brake ban, trying to cover every possible loophole. RedBull had a drop in performance and in driveability since then, and Max has started to feel uncomfortable with the rotation of his car.\n\nEdit : what I mean by this is that McLaren obviously improved, but as they were rising, the team that was dominating the sport also seemed to suffer a drop in performance - RB had won 42 out of 49 races before that.""]",28,35,0.91,28,33,33,21,20,0.09000000000000008,21

(Ignore the no. in title)

A lot of the times, the races are absolutely boring.

Some of them are continue to be as expected less entertaining like Monaco with minimal race action, others like Spa, even with wet conditions, unexpectedly and unfortunately didn't offer much either. 

Which races left on the 2025 calendar, do you now, still have the most expectations from? 

Name your Top 5 in order of how exciting or interesting to watch they wil be. 🏁
