The leaders doing their pace, trying to create a gap to the midfield to slot in after the first stop. In this case, one Mclaren will try to undercut Leclerc and the other will opt to go longer creating a tyre delta for later. In this scenario it will be very hard for Leclerc to keep the lead. The undercut here is extremly powerful and if they are within 2 seconds before the first stop, one Mclaren will pass him, so Ferrari themselves have to try and be the first to pit.\n\n2. Do a monaco train and keep the field close together, aka driving 1-2 seconds slower than what they normally could do. Therefore the chance of an undercut is reduced a lot since the Mclarens cant slot into some free air. \nWith Leclercs slightly lower downforce setup, the 5 kph top speed adventage could be enough to keep the lead on the two straights but its risky cause with one bad exit of the final corner and mclarens superior traction and grip there he could still be vulnerable and then once he is passed mclaren will drive away and the rest of the race will be hard to recover.

I am a first-year science teacher in a rural district in the US, and I plan on using racecars as a means of teaching physics. NASCAR is popular there and a lot of people do small-scale hobby racing, but as F1 is the pinnacle of automotive engineering I want to use it instead, to inspire the ones that are going to go on into mechanical engineering etc. 

I have found some good videos on the F1 YouTube channel that I plan on using. I also found the means to construct a miniature wind tunnel, although mine may be rather rudimentary compared to the ones I saw. (I'll have students build their own racecars and we'll test them in the wind tunnel).

Plus, I\'m betting that if your rural school is much like the one I went to, there\'s probably students who either drive some barely-held-together, no-muffler, souped up Civic or their older sibling does lol. So, being able to draw the line between those more close to home vehicles and F1 cars, which look so much different, may be helpful! \n\nIf you\'re looking to get into things like suspension, etc., there\'s also the fact that F1 cars have incredibly intricate, beautiful suspension set ups for what they do - but it would never work on, say, a WRC car, or vice versa. I can see a fun discussion there about utility-based design, too - so you don\'t necessarily put down Nascar, but focus more on the fact that every series of motorsport has its goals and a great deal of engineering and physics involved with reaching those goals.', ""I don't feel like you can for sure show this difference in small models, and I would want to make sure you didn't insult nascar.

1mh5lgr,MONDAY TRASH TALK THREAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mh5lgr/monday_trash_talk_thread/,2025-08-04, Discussion,"TRASH TALK 101 FOR ANYONE NEW HERE - BEACAUSE. TRASH. TALK. IS. A. GENERATIONAL. THREAD.

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

It's almost as if he wants the narrative to be that he's down and out, as it puts him in a better headspace.\n\nI'm sure his motivation and drive is still sky high - of course he desperately wants to win with Ferrari.

Since 2006 when a new 3-part qualifying system was introduced a margins between fastest race day and qualifying lap increased in contrast of those weekends before changes. Times of fastest qualifying laps after the system changes did not change as much as the times of fastest laps on race day. Why is that? A bit stretch because i did not analyze actual race paces but can we say that the race pace was slower after the 2005 season, or was the fastest lap on race day more important as it was later (for instance in this season is not important)?","['fuel', 'Q3 in 2006 they ran with their 1st stint race fuel onboard, so the pole times would be closer to the race pace than the fastest lap in quali itself.']",3,2,0.62,3,4,4,0,0,0.0,0
