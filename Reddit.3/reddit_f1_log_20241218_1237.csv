1hg9sh5,"Flavio Briatore: ""I am a democratic dictator.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hg9sh5/flavio_briatore_i_am_a_democratic_dictator/,2024-12-17, News,"Translation(**Credits to Alfus from Alpine subreddit for the translation**):

In an interview with auto motor und sport, Flavio Briatore reveals why he came back, how he wants to apply the old success model to Alpine and what he understands by a good management style.

**You decided to make a comeback to Formula 1 at the age of 74. Why return to retirement?**

> Briatore: I was never really away. In the meantime, I was an ambassador for the sport for Stefano Domenicali and worked with him on new races and marketing opportunities. And as Fernando Alonso's manager, I was always in contact with the scene. But I was mainly involved in setting up my restaurant chain. I started from scratch. We are now one of the largest groups in the luxury segment worldwide and employ 1,200 people. It pretty much runs itself by now. There wasn't much left for me to do. My son moved from Monte Carlo to Geneva because he is studying there. It was getting a bit lonely at home and I was bored. And Formula 1 never really lets you go. I admit, I missed it. And then I had a conversation with Luca de Meo. I've known him for ages. I told him that it was sad to see a former world champion team in this state.

**And how did it become a job?**

> Briatore: In the beginning, the idea was to help a little. I wasn't sure because so much has changed in Formula 1. We talked about the last few years of Alpine in a very non-committal way. Losing two drivers like Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri in one summer was a bit of an inability. Fernando wanted to stay because the season before wasn't that bad. We wanted to sign the contract in Canada. Then Laurent Rossi suddenly disappeared. We could no longer contact him. That was the moment when I started talking to Lawrence Stroll from Aston Martin. We even had an offer from Williams. I said to them: get your shop in order first. In the end, we signed with Aston Martin because we couldn't get on with Alpine's management. The faults lay with the management. That's when I said to Luca: if I get full responsibility, I'll do it.

**You became world champion with Benetton during your career and made Renault world champion in the 2000s. Is the situation today comparable to back then?**

> Briatore: It is comparable to 2002. But we are in a better position with Alpine than we were with Renault back then. The team was in total disarray in 2002. Everyone was arguing with everyone else. With Luca, I now have the opportunity to do everything we want to do in the next three to five years. The first step was to get rid of our own engine. That means we're saying goodbye to something that only costs us money but brings us nothing. Mercedes will give us the best engine and the best gearbox in the business in 2026. If you want to win, 80 to 90 per cent of your components have to be the best. You don't need handicaps. In 2002, Renault had a very good engine. It was so good that we were even able to sell it to Red Bull later on. And the gearbox? It can't win you any races, it can only lose you some.

*How do you want to turn Alpine around?**

> Briatore: I have clear and simple management structures. We have appointed Oliver Oakes as team principal because he is young and motivated and has motorsport experience. Running a Formula 1 team is certainly different to being a Formula 2 team principal. But Ollie learns very quickly. He is a great choice.

**Why didn't you want to be team principal yourself?**

> Briatore: Why? I have been for long enough. I want to take care of the big picture and not be at the factory in Enstone every day. I represent our president Luca. I don't need a title to do that. Everyone knows that: I make the decisions. You need a team principal and a technical director to implement them. I have my old Benetton team in mind. There were three or four people running the place. I had less experience back then, but fortunately I had a good technical team around me with Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds. Now we have a good team under our Technical Director David Sanchez, a mix of people from the past and young engineers. We have to build the new Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds from that. In the meantime, everyone can see the light at the end of the tunnel. With the Mercedes engine, we have the basis to win. That is the mission. Not just driving around in circles.

**How do you intend to achieve this?**

> Briatore: You need the right people in the management positions. They can do what they want in their area as long as they deliver results. If not, that's where I come in. I am a democratic dictator. I trust people as long as they return the trust. If they are bad, I change them. Bad people infect everyone who works under them. They then say to themselves: why should I work for someone who is worse than me?

**They say that people make the difference. Adrian Newey was on the market. Why did he go to Aston Martin and not Alpine?**

> Briatore: You'll have to ask him that. Adrian is an artist. We're not ready for someone like him yet. To benefit from him, you have to have the right team around him. Maybe we'll be ready in two or three years. That's why I've never spoken to him seriously.

**Can the solutions that worked in the 2000s still be applied today?**

> Briatore: I think so. Successful models survive the test of time. As a manager, I have to make sure that everyone in the team understands what it's all about. Everyone must always have the goal in mind. The past is part of the present. That's why I had the world champion cars from 1995 and 2006 and all the world championship trophies placed in the entrance hall at Enstone and the previous year's car taken out. On Monday, our people come to the factory, see what this team has achieved and are prepared to work an extra three hours. When success comes, you no longer ask how high your personal commitment is. The difference today is that the teams have become much bigger and spend more money. You have to recognize the good people and let them grow. The size of the teams means that responsibility in the individual areas is spread over several shoulders.

**Isn't it harder to keep 800 people happy instead of 400?**

> Briatore: It all depends on the management staff. That's maybe 20 people. Just like in my restaurants, actually. We have 37 establishments worldwide. The product is different, but the system of creating a good product is the same as in Formula 1. We have to find the best people for all departments, in the technical office and production. The technical director has the task of putting it all together and overseeing the final product. I see a lot of progress here. The mood and motivation are much better today than they were five months ago. You only have to look at the faces of the people in the factory. There is a completely different spirit than when I started. You motivate employees with two things: Money and success.

**How much time do you devote to Formula 1?**

> Briatore: About 60 percent. I will be at Enstone three days a week in the winter. That's enough. I'm not going there to show my face. Something has to come out of it. I meet with our department heads there and find out whether the targets are being met. In the end, I'm only responsible to Luca de Meo. I owe him success. And we are lucky with him. He is a fan of motorsport. He wants to win. Even more so than Louis Schweitzer and Carlos Ghosn, with whom I had dealings in the past.","['>Flavio Briatore: ""I am a democratic dictator.""\n\nIn that case, I\'ll look forward to his episodes on *Behind the Bastards*.', ""MBS: And I'm an authoritarian dictator!"", 'https://preview.redd.it/ag2xv8f9qe7e1.jpeg?width=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edda0fd3d031224c0f3f306151c0b2b15fe73ae4', 'This guy should be far away from the sport but the world we live in money talks and criminals walk.  Utterly disgusting tbh', ""Part 2:\n\n**Unlike in the past, we now have a budget cap. Is the price right and is the system fair?**\n\n> Briatore: The name budget cap sounds very good. The reality is different. If you want to do it right, the driver has to be included in the budget. And also expensive engineers. Adrian Newey is as expensive as a driver. That's a big cost factor. It makes no sense to take him out. So the rich teams will always have an advantage because they can afford the expensive drivers or engineers and don't have to suffer in other areas. If the driver were included, it would be a fair system. Then you can decide: Do I prefer to spend my money on the driver or the car?\n\n**You used to preach efficiency with Renault and criticized when teams had over 500 people. Now we're at 800 to 1,000, what do you think?**\n\n> Briatore: That's completely crazy. Why do we race? To entertain the spectators. The spectator doesn't care how many people work for the teams. The car doesn't look any different to them if 300 instead of 2,000 people are working on it. And if the gearbox was the same for everyone, nobody would notice. People don't care whether it has five or eight gears. It doesn't make the car any faster. It only causes costs. How many cylinders does the engine have? It doesn't matter, the main thing is that it makes noise for the local people. You can't even hear that on the TV. You only notice the engine when it breaks down. Just like it still happens to us. Then everyone talks about the engine. We'd be better off investing our money in the show. We need a battle of the gladiators and not an arms race of components that make no difference.\n\n**Don't think Alpine will lose its identity with a Mercedes engine. The French have always been proud of their products?**\n\n> Briatore: The French want to win. We don't win with our engine. It's as simple as that. If we want to win, we have to give up the areas in which we are not competitive. That's one less problem for us to worry about in the future. Let's focus on the car. McLaren becomes world champion with a Mercedes engine. How many times have you read or heard about McLaren-Mercedes becoming world champions? Never. Haas is Haas and not Haas-Ferrari.\n\n**Can you guarantee that the move to a customer engine is not the first step towards selling the team?**\n\n> Briatore: I don't understand this speculation. Since I joined Renault, the same questions have always been asked. When we won the world championship title in 2005 and 2006, I was asked whether Renault wanted to stay in Formula 1. The truth is: I always got what I needed for the job from Renault. They appreciate that I am careful with their money. I believe in efficiency. That's why I'm now saving money everywhere in the areas that don't make my car faster. I don't think about what I'll be doing in five, ten or 20 years' time. I decide what's important now.\n\n**How long did it take you to figure out where Alpine was and what was needed to get back to winning ways?**\n\n> Briatore: It didn't take a genius to figure out that Alpine was down. When I came on board, the team had two points on the board. What is needed? I think we have a recipe for winning with 30 to 40 percent less money than the others. At Benetton it was 50 percent less. I know this team. That's why I came back. I wouldn't have done it with anyone else.\n\n**Where will Alpine be at the end of the season?**\n\n> Briatore: We have taken a big step forward and improved to the same level as Haas and Toro Rosso. But that was already a step for 2025. It wouldn't have been worth the effort for a few races in 2024. We had actually already ticked off that year. That's why I told the engineers: we'll only bring the upgrade if it will help us next year.\n\n**They wanted Carlos Sainz. He signed with Williams. What went wrong there?**\n\n> Briatore: I spoke to Sainz. He was interesting for us, but only for four years. It makes no sense to take a driver like Carlos for one or two years. Either he believes in our program or he doesn't. I don't need a driver who costs me a lot of money and is looking to go to another team when the opportunity arises.\n\n**You are also interested in Franco Colapinto. Why is that? You already have a young driver in Jack Doohan.**\n\n> Briatore: I'm interested in any driver who is fast. Colapinto surprised everyone. But we have contracts with Gasly, Doohan and Aron for next season. If there was an opportunity to get Colapinto for 2026, you have to think about it. Nevertheless, you always have to be careful when assessing drivers. In this sport, you quickly get hyped up after a good race. Then the price rises and suddenly we're talking about 20 or 30 million dollars. The choice today is much greater than it used to be. Today, there are six to seven promising drivers in Formula 2 and Formula 3. We want to concentrate on the good ones in our academy and no longer run around with a watering can. It will probably come down to three drivers. Aron, Mini and Martins.\n\n**We have five rookies at the start next year. One at Alpine. Has time run out for the veterans?**\n\n> Briatore: It is now time for a generation change. Sainz is a very good driver. But when he was on the market, none of the top teams took him on. They prefer to go for young drivers. Toto Wolff on Antonelli, Christian Horner on Lawson. Young drivers are hungrier than someone who has a wife and two children and 30 or 40 million in the bank. Even Enzo Ferrari said that drivers slow down when they have children. I think the rise of Piastri has made people think. Bearman jumps into a Ferrari overnight and drives a great race. The young drivers are much better trained. And the competitive pressure is higher. In Formula 2, you're in first place today and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton or Rosberg used to win 70 percent of all races. When Schumacher came to us, he still lacked experience. We first sent Fernando to Minardi. Verstappen didn't even have a driver's license when he started at Toro Rosso.\n\n**How long can Fernando Alonso survive in this environment?**\n\n> Briatore: Fernando is the exception. I've been his manager for 22 years. He has money, but no children. And he is still hungry. If he finishes 14th, he wants to be 13th. Someone else his age would do his job by the book if it's only about 14th place. There are now two feelings in my chest. On the one hand, I wish Fernando could get off to another flying start with Adrian Newey at Aston Martin in 2026, but on the other hand, he's racing against Alpine. But still, would a World Championship title as a farewell be a brilliant story?\n\n**Where should Alpine finish next year, where in 2026 and 2027?**\n\n> Briatore: Alpine must always be in the top 6 next year. Maybe a podium every now and then. We have to improve our car to achieve this. That should be possible. Aerodynamically, we have much more leeway than Ferrari or McLaren. In 2026, we want to be on the podium in 50 percent of all races. Then you automatically win one or two races. In 2027, we have to be in a position to compete for the title."", ""Didn't he get a life-ban for crashgate Singapore 2008?

As a child and still to this day, ‘Our Nige’ is still my all time favourite. 

This documentary brought all my emotions back, feels very similar to the day I heard ‘is that Glock?’

Why did Ferrari sign him for 96?\n\nIt seems most people at the time felt there were better options for the Ferrari drive, but I have not been able to find any in-depth analysis on why Ferrari chose him. Was it simply that he was the best driver willing to sign a contract to be #2 to Schumacher? I feel like I have read/heard somewhere that Ferrari wanted to keep Berger but that he didn’t want to be Schumi’s team-mate.\n\nThe likes of Hakkinen, Barrichello, Frentzen and Coulthard all seemed to have better reputations than Irvine but I wonder if Ferrari looked at Eddie and saw a strong personality who wouldn’t be mentally fazed by Schumacher’s presence, and would instead just get on with the job as best as he could. \n\n2. How do we rate him overall? \n\nI ask this mainly in the context of his comparison to Barrichello. After a messy ‘94, Irvine was very closely matched with Barrichello in ‘95 and he seemed to mentally destabilise Barrichello a bit, or at least that is the general consensus and one that seems to be corroborated by Eddie Jordan himself.\n\nHowever, Barrichello went on to be a much better #2 to Schumacher than Eddie was. I said in my recent post on 1992-2003 that there seemed to be two versions of Eddie at Ferrari - one was a great competitive spirit that could take points away from Michael’s rivals and the other was miles off the pace. \n\nHowever, he started off at Ferrari with a car that was not particularly good and reportedly had very little opportunity to test in his first year or so at Maranello. How much do we think that skewed things against him? It seems to me he improved throughout his time at Ferrari and largely fulfilled his potential in ‘99, albeit the main factor in putting him on the verge of a title was the numerous mistakes and mechanical failures for Hakkinen & McLaren that year.', ""It'll happen by at maximum next week, patience everyone"", 'Mekies says: Give Yuki a fast car.\n\nHow about you doing that Laurent?

How many seconds per lap could that amount to?","[""it isn't anymore. light drivers have ballast to make it's equal. the minimum weight is 80kg\n\nalso this is a question for https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hg53d8/ask_rformula1_anything_daily_discussion_thread/"", 'the lighter drivers have added ballast to reach the 80kg minimum weight', 'Ballast to make weight up to 80kg must be placed under the drivers seat/cockpit so cannot be used to improve car balance.', ""Interestingly, in the 80s and early 90s, only the car had to be a certain minimum weight. The driver was excluded. This theoretically meant the lighter drivers had the advantage. \n\nIf I remember correctly Eddie Cheever was one of the heaviest drivers.. Yet he was also one of the quickest. In 1982, he went up against one of the lightest drivers on the grid, Laffite, and thoroughly outperformed him. He then went on to do reasonably well against the legendary (and another light weight) Alain Prost in 1983.\n\nIn 1995, the driver weight was included as well with the car for the first time, and their sum had to be a certain minimum weight. \n\nAnd .. Absolutely nothing changed with regards to the pecking order of drivers.

It was particularly bad problem in 2014 for example as all the cars were overweight, a lot of the tall drivers had go on strict diets to get closer to their teammates. Vergne for example was hospitalised because he passed out after a race due to dehydrating and starving himself.

1hge2iy,How important is it to have an F1 race in Africa and is it worth it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hge2iy/how_important_is_it_to_have_an_f1_race_in_africa/,2024-12-17, Discussion,"People for long have complained that a world championship doesn’t visit the second largest continent on the world. However, I don’t see how simply adding one race to this continent helps almost anything except for checking Africa off the list. I don’t think I need to say how vastly different every region of Africa is and when you look at the most likely candidates in my opinion this divide is clearly shown.

Obviously South Africa has always been the frontrunner since Kyalami used to host F1 but not only does the country seem unstable at times (I haven’t kept up but I remember protests at one point) but South Africa is very different to most countries. Then you have Rwanda who seem to be leading the race now and seem to be the most economically stable country in Africa and most realistic host. Watching football I’ve seen their advertising all over Arsenal and it seems they’re going a step further now but once again Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia. And the final option which is by far the least realistic but it’s just the reality of having a race in this continent would be an Egyptian GP but as you can imagine the divide is biggest at the North of Africa and it would be seen as another desert race. I only include it because it’s the most well known African country and has a history vastly greater than any desert race we currently have. Beyond these 3 options I can’t think of anything else, maybe a Moroccan GP since they seem to be hosting the WC with Spain and Portugal and at the most extreme push Senegal for being the closest possible option West Africa has.

 I think a lot of people have this idea that we can just start having races anywhere in Africa to represent the continent but it is beyond unrealistic to start hosting races in West Africa, East Africa and most of North Africa so why force one race to tick the continent off when it’s not really proper representation. I feel like only die hard Kyalami fans would be pushing for it otherwise there is little interest. Personally, I’d rather countries focus their efforts towards their people rather than paying ridiculous money to host an F1 event which is why I kept the options as realistic as possible. So for me it’s not worth forcing an F1 race here where one race can’t possibly please even a fifth of the continent (it’s not as simple as hosting Melbourne for Australia) and the options that exist mostly don’t exist apart from Kyalami yet the most realistic option still will be a soulless Rwandan GP. ","[""Personally I think that races should be awarded based on how much the host country/city can actually viably support the race and how many actual fans from the locality will get to see the race in person, as well as the general appeal of the race to the existing F1 fan base.\n\nMaybe hosting a race in Africa could bring in a large fan base, but if the race isn't likely to be run for more than a couple years and they stop because of the expense, then it's probably not a great idea to host a race there.\n\nAlso, with 24 races,  we are approaching the point at which we don't really have time for more races.

They should just add a race and see how popular it is. Popularity will determine if they add more races to the area.\n\nI would remind you that there is only one race in South America, and five in North America. (Two races in South America if we're going by Marko's reckoning.)\n\n>Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia.\n\nOmg who cares about 'representing all of Asia/Africa'?
