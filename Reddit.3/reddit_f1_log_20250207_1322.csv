1ij26ge,Did 1990 (or the era approx) mark the end of Formula One as it was known at the time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ij26ge/did_1990_or_the_era_approx_mark_the_end_of/,2025-02-06, Discussion,"A few months back I finished watching the seasons from 1992 through 2003, essentially completing the Schumacher era through to when I actually started watching F1 in 2004. I had some thoughts on that here, some of which I have wavered on through further analysis since: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/WgE30i5xEI

I have also watched back the 1990 and 1991 since making that thread, and I have to say I was very surprised by how different the sport felt in those years compared to those immediately after. 

It could be argued that the time around 1990 represents something of a high watermark for F1. The field as a whole was far less competitive than it is now, with the gaps from the front to the midfield and the front to the back being far bigger than they are today. However, the races were generally far less predictable in spite of that. Who saw Leyton House coming at the French GP? Who knew there would be a Benetton one-two and Aguri Suzuki podium in Japan? Who knew Jean Alesi would have Tyrrell in contention at certain races?

I would contend that the time around 1990 saw the sport begin to transform into what it is today. The cars first took on the same basic shape of today and innovations like the semi-automatic gearbox, driver aids and active suspension had in some cases been seen before, but really took over the sport in the years including and immediately after 89. This made the sport feel technology-driven and computerised in a way that much more closely resembles today than anything that had come before it. This can also be said of race strategies; 1990 feels like the last year where the majority of races saw certain teams steadfastly committed to not making a tyre stop even if it was obvious they should, with Benetton not making stops because they were best equipped to go without them and Williams seemingly much more scared than other teams of the potential pitfalls. By the end of 1991, race strategies began to become more uniform and much more similar to today than they had been even immediately before.

Also in 1990 we had a very strong talent pool with four great champions (I am starting to wonder if maybe Piquet and Mansell were overrated, but I’d never have questioned their greatness without a deeper dive) and several other accomplished drivers who had mostly come into the sport through streamlined processes that were propped up by big backers of the sport like Marlboro and Elf. Afterwards, several drivers - Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve, Eddie Irvine and even the likes of Kimi Raikkonen and Juan Pablo Montoya later on - took some highly unconventional routes into F1. I would argue this partially explains why the bulk of the 1990s saw a very weak pool of talent - there was a huge gulf between Schumacher and pretty much everyone else, whereas the 1980s saw several drivers being able to bridge the gap between the GOAT candidates and the occasional race winners. 

The years after 1990 also saw the death of many small garagista teams that had previously been thriving hand-in-hand with the Hondas, Renaults and Ferraris of the world, for whom I would argue the sport has transformed into more and more of a financial black hole since; it is safe to say that ‘win on Sunday, sell on Monday’ really isn’t a thing anymore other than for premium brand manufacturers and even that may be stretching things.

The garagista teams - along with past giants like Lotus and Brabham - were on their knees soon after 1990 and with that we saw an influx of pay drivers like Jean-Denis Deletraz, a shortlived response to the raised barrier to entry and the further raised barrier to success.

Add in the changes to circuits - with 1990 marking a farewell to the original fast Silverstone as well as the short Paul Ricard, and future years seeing the sport react to the events of Imola 1994 - and I would argue that by approximately 1996, the sport much more closely resembled the sport of today than the one of 1986. 

Obviously, there is a degree of hyperbole here as the sport saw significant changes after 1996 - for example, the Tilkefication of circuits largely took place in the early 2000s as a response to Greg Moore’s fatal crash in the 1999 Fontana CART race, and lap records at traditional circuits continued to tumble until approximately 2004. From that point I would argue the sport has only ever been able to be a version of the pinnacle of motorsport due to rising costs, the need to reign in excellence for the good of entertainment, the demand for environmental sustainability and the standardisation and homologation of specs and parts. 

It is also possible my opinions here are subliminally influenced by technological advancements throughout the world at the time, with race broadcasts arguably being the main beneficiary of this. The graphics introduced in 1994 made events so much easier to follow than anything from before and this is probably the context in which it is most true that F1 circa 1996 resembled today more closely than it did the decade prior.

It may also be worth noting the years after 1990 did not see the sport’s biggest sea change - that honour would probably go to the years immediately following 1967 due to sponsors, wings and the sea of political changes particularly regarding driver power increasing at the expense of circuit promoters.

All-in-all though, I can massively empathise (albeit not quite agree) with the rose-tinted perspective from which fans and observers view the era approx 1990. A lot of changes and the loss of a wild-west nature of sorts really feels like it can be traced back to that year or era. Am I onto something here? Am I making a degree of sense but being a little too hyperbolic? Or am I being completely crazy?","['At the time, no one noticed a turning point change. That’s only visible through time. You have the full history to analyze. Back then no one knew what the future would bring, thus changes were gradual. Basically, the boiled frog effect.', 'I think there were a few things going on that didn\'t all happen for the same time or the same reasons.\n\nThe Concorde Agreement had regularized F1 and thrown out privateers in 1981 (basically the start of the shift to ""modern F1"". The garagistes had been in trouble for a while in 1990. They had been actually competitive in the DFV era, but with budgets rising and expensive works turbo engines required in the 80s it became much harder.   \n  \nThe FIA started encouraging teams to join with cheaper 3.5 liter DFV-derived engines in 1987. At the time F3000 had 3.0L engines and free chassis competition, so the leap for F3000 teams to join F1 was not very big. The low-budget teams rushed in from 1987 and peaked in 1989 with almost 40 cars at some races. They mostly folded in a few years as anyone who couldn\'t get big sponsors, works engine deals, and high-tech driver aids couldn\'t compete. The field shrank down to only 20 cars by the end of 1996. Despite plenty of lucky podiums for smaller teams, the front of the pack separated itself during the turbo era and couldn\'t be caught. Over twelve seasons 1984-1995 only four teams won 94% of races, and every driver/constructor champion from 1983-2008 had a works engine!  \n  \nIt wasn\'t really until the 2000s that the car manufacturers muscled in. That change was very rapid--in 1999, Ferrari was the only one, but by 2006 the top six teams were five carmakers and McLaren, which was 40% owned by Mercedes. Along with the expansion of the calendar and new Tilkedromes built all over Asia and the Middle East, that\'s what marks the transition into our current F1 era.', 'For me, the Williams with the active suspension and the transition to high nose cars was the changeover.\xa0\n\n\nBefore that they were flat bottomed slot cars with absurd horsepower wrestling the cars around the track.\xa0', 'I can\'t comment on how it was as a fan at the time as I wasn\'t alive, but going back and watching the old seasons there\'s a definite vibe shift around that period. However, I think it was more of a gradual change happening over nearly a decade than a single year thing.\n\nI think it started around 1986 with the retirement of more old school drivers like Lauda and Rosberg. \n\nThen in 1987 you had Bernie Ecclestone getting full commercial control over the sport by setting up what\'s now known as FOM, and finally burying the hatchet with FISA / the FIA which was a pretty huge deal. You also had the start of turbos being phased out with the introduction of the boost restrictor valves, which eventually led into their total ban in \'89. Again, that was a pretty seismic change.\n\nI\'d say the process of transitioning over to what I\'d consider ""modern"" F1 finished in around 1994. You get the new graphics package like you mentioned which completely changed how you follow races, and also had the passing of a driver who was truly a talisman of his era in Senna.', 'Basically, the world of F1 changed almost overnight on May 1st, 1994. I guess if you would have been around back then, you would have known but that black weekend changed everything.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994\\_San\\_Marino\\_Grand\\_Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_San_Marino_Grand_Prix)\n\nEdit: Added Wikipedia link', 'The shift to aero and away from mechanical grip accelerated in the 90s and I think with it the randomness you speak of disappeared. That coupled with cost control has led to greater standardisation and therefore much lower failure rates in components.\n\nAll that combined has resulted in aero concepts that are nearly Boolean across a season, but the random failure rates of old are gone. \n\nAlso I think the journey to F1 now is on rails, and as such the gap between the top and the bottom is closer meaning most cars are having the maximum extracted of them evenly, whereas in the early 90s the delta between top and bottom drivers was much greater and led to things like Alesi in the Tyrrell.', ""Thinking esp. about backmarkers, they got barely any coverage in the early 90s. Maybe partly because there were so many of them, but overall people couldn't care less how a Dallara or a Larrousse finished. That definitely changed in the late 90s, when only 22 cars were on the grid and all the low-effort teams had disappeared. The level of quality (or professionality) across the grid has vastly improved and the gaps between front and back got a lot closer."", 'If I could split it in 2, I would pick 94 after Senna crashes. Then another inflection point would be year 2000. That marks the beginning of driver and team dominance; first Ferrari, then Red Bull, then Mercedes the Red Bull again. People tend to forget but before Schumacher, team dominance would last for a couple of years. Now that’s the norm.', ""There's a lot of comments about aero in here, but I don't agree with them. The shift to aero grip didn't start in the 1990s; it started from the moment that the wing cars first appeared, and became even more marked with the advent of ground effect. It then did have a bit of a lull after ground effect was outlawed and then the turbo era put a new emphasis on raw power, but that was only a temporary blip.\n\nLikewise, it's easy to be nostalgic for that period, but the hard cold reality was quite different. Teams would pop up and go bust on a regular basis; drivers were getting killed or badly injured on a regular basis; and Balestre was even more nakedly corrupt than MBS. Whilst some modern tracks aren't great, there were still plenty of tracks that were never suitable for F1 that popped up as well - Caesar's Palace, Dallas and Detroit just to name three.""]",148,52,0.85,148,434,434,1,0,0.0,1

1ijml6y,Why did it take so long for the HANS device to get implemented in F1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ijml6y/why_did_it_take_so_long_for_the_hans_device_to/,2025-02-07, Discussion,"Hey! I am writing a paper on how effective the FIA was in regard to safety advancements along the years. Something I cannot seem to find is why the FIA took so long for the HANS to be mandated and what caused that decision. Was it a specific accident? The HANS device was developed in the mid 1980s, but mandated in 2003. Any help is much appreciated! Also, if you know where to find that information (hopefully from a reputable source :) please let me know!!) Thank you!","['[https://www.thepitcrewonline.net/2018/07/30/safety-in-motorsports-week-the-hans-device/](https://www.thepitcrewonline.net/2018/07/30/safety-in-motorsports-week-the-hans-device/)\n\n*The Head and Neck System (more commonly referred to as the HANS device) is often overlooked in the world of modern Formula One. Its historical significance, though,\xa0should not be underestimated, not least because at the time of its introduction it was one of very, very few occasions in F1’s history up to that point where the FIA had reacted to a non-fatal accident. The accident in question occurred at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, hosted at the popular Adelaide circuit. At one of the fastest points on the track, a rapid tyre deflation sent Mika Hakkinen – then in his third season in F1 – hurtling into the barriers. The impact was so extreme that his neck hyperextended, his skull was fractured, he swallowed his tongue, and he suffered major internal bleeding. He spent over two months in hospital – a significant amount of that in intensive care – but he eventually made a full recovery and returned to F1 for the 1996 season.*\n\nThe crash: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwVpVLDWG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwVpVLDWG8)', 'Not specific to F1 but the HANS device was quite unpopular amongst drivers for a long time. A couple of factors for drivers not liking it was because it was easy to get the fit and setup wrong, which would cause the wearer major discomfort, and that it pins the driver down more than seatbelts alone, something that many drivers disliked. Dale Earnhardt Sr., who lost his life to a basilar skull fracture, the very injury that the HANS device is meant to prevent, famously referred to it as “that damned noose” and complained that it restricted his range of motion and limited his competitive advantage. His death was one of many, but arguably the most high profile, that led to the HANS becoming mandatory in major racing series.', 'If you’re writing a paper on FIA safety then I hope you’re including a section on Prof. Sid Watkins and all he did for the sport.', ""The HANS device was possibly accelerated by the death of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, considered one of the sport's all-time legends on a level akin to Senna, dying in a crash that was completely survivable if the the device was equipped; the sport made it available to drivers, but he utterly detested it, throwing it out of the car on every opportunity, until the largest race of the year, the Daytona 500 in 2001, when, on the final lap, he died in front of an audience of millions - this caused NASCAR to mandate it and quite possibly accelerated the moves of sanctioning bodies worldwide."", ""Safety isn't sexy.\xa0\n\n\nThe Halo was pretty widely condemned as ugly, but this has since been shut down by several instances where the driver was clearly saved by it, most famously Romain Grosjean.\xa0\n\n\nTyre tethers were only added after the death of Ayrton Senna. Marshals had been killed prior to this by bouncing tyres.\xa0\n\n\nJackie Stewart is a good person to look at for championing safety in motor sport. There was a time when a few deaths per year was just what happened."", ""The hans is uncomfortable, and even distracting to drivers sometimes. It's not a natural feeling to have your head tied to your chest. Some drivers even rallied that it would be dangerous. \n\nYou should look into Rubens Barrichello who had actually received special permission to forgo the Hans even after it was mandated. He only ran a single race in Australia 2003 before the FIA cracked down and told him either wear it, or they'd find a driver that would.\n\nAnd don't forget to mention, Dale Sr wasn't the only driver to suffer a deadly injury that the HANS would have protected from, there is also Roman Ratzenberger, Adam Petty, Blaise Alexander (who was fatally injured 7 months AFTER Earnhardt and was Nascars real final straw)"", 'Sports and humans in general are reluctant to change.\n\nF1 drivers in late 1980s and early 1990s had grown up seeing how much more dangerous F1 had been in 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, and were still willing to accept the risks and enter the sport. By the time they enter, F1 had become safer than what they were already willing to accept, so its not big issue for most of them.\n\nDont forget our bodies are millions of years old. Back in the wery olden days, most answers to problems would have been found from the elders and the past, and doing what you have always done has kept you alive. So without immediate and direct big enough danger, change was slow.', 'For the same reasons that it took years to even develop the Halo, despite the calls that were made immediately after the death of Henry Surtees; far too many people clinging to the bizarre notion of making the sport ""too safe"", plus aesthetic concerns and the fact it wasn\'t particularly comfortable.', ""Karting doesn't mandate neck braces, still at least in UK. Our daughter always wore one (a motorcross one) but it wasn't seen as a 'cool kid' thing & most stopped as they got older. This cool kid attitude to safety needs to be stopped in F1 & down through the levels of motorsport."", 'They talk about this in the USA 2002 episode of bring back V10s (or perhaps Austria), about how some drivers found it uncomfortable.']",24,14,0.77,24,14,14,4,3,0.010000000000000009,4
