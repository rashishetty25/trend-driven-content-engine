The leaders doing their pace, trying to create a gap to the midfield to slot in after the first stop. In this case, one Mclaren will try to undercut Leclerc and the other will opt to go longer creating a tyre delta for later. In this scenario it will be very hard for Leclerc to keep the lead. The undercut here is extremly powerful and if they are within 2 seconds before the first stop, one Mclaren will pass him, so Ferrari themselves have to try and be the first to pit.\n\n2. Do a monaco train and keep the field close together, aka driving 1-2 seconds slower than what they normally could do. Therefore the chance of an undercut is reduced a lot since the Mclarens cant slot into some free air. \nWith Leclercs slightly lower downforce setup, the 5 kph top speed adventage could be enough to keep the lead on the two straights but its risky cause with one bad exit of the final corner and mclarens superior traction and grip there he could still be vulnerable and then once he is passed mclaren will drive away and the rest of the race will be hard to recover.

I am a first-year science teacher in a rural district in the US, and I plan on using racecars as a means of teaching physics. NASCAR is popular there and a lot of people do small-scale hobby racing, but as F1 is the pinnacle of automotive engineering I want to use it instead, to inspire the ones that are going to go on into mechanical engineering etc. 

I have found some good videos on the F1 YouTube channel that I plan on using. I also found the means to construct a miniature wind tunnel, although mine may be rather rudimentary compared to the ones I saw. (I'll have students build their own racecars and we'll test them in the wind tunnel).

Since 2006 when a new 3-part qualifying system was introduced a margins between fastest race day and qualifying lap increased in contrast of those weekends before changes. Times of fastest qualifying laps after the system changes did not change as much as the times of fastest laps on race day. Why is that? A bit stretch because i did not analyze actual race paces but can we say that the race pace was slower after the 2005 season, or was the fastest lap on race day more important as it was later (for instance in this season is not important)?",[],2,0,0.75,2,0,0,2,0,0.75,2

F1 is like most venues in this world so this is not unusual. Most places have general admission, and paid reserved seats or special areas.

(Whether he will turn out to be right is a very different story.) But also, it was always sort of difficult to tell how much of Horner’s style was the panto villain persona and how much was him being genuinely very difficult to reason with. That “the higher you rise, the sharper the knives” line used to drive me up the wall—he seemed to have a very, very difficult time understanding that anyone could criticize him or his people for any reason except jealousy. It reminds me of that story DC tells about the time he got into an argument with Schumacher that went on and on, and eventually said, “Okay, you won’t admit you could be wrong about this. Can you admit you might have been wrong about anything—ever?” and Schumacher thought the matter over and said, “I can’t think of a time.” And Horner’s a very successful man (or was one for a while, anyway), but he’s no Michael Schumacher.']",0,27,0.47,0,26,26,0,0,0.0,0
