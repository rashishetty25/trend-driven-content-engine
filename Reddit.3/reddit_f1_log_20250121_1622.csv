However i wanted to test how true this actually is so i decided to see the data





For this test i've decided to use the data on driver ranking from the site F1 HOT or NOT.  After each race of the F1 calendar  teams and drivers were rated by fans. Worst ranking on a single weekend possible for a driver is -2.00. Highest ranking on a single weekend possible is +2.00. 





What I've decided to do is compare the rating of each driver between their 2023 and 2024 season and see how they compare  and see if there is correlation between the increase of their rating and increase of their car performance or vice versa. 2023 and 2024 are perfect seasons to compare asthere were no drivers changing teams and everyone remained with the exact same teammate except Tsunoda and Albon, the only thing that changed was car performance

RBR and AM drivers got their rating tanked massively because car regressed a lot while Haas was the opposite. Fans always have perception that big teams are good and small teams are bad even though that isnt always the case. I've seen Alonso getting worse rating than Hulk in 2nd part of the season and even KMag who he both outscored in in that part of the season especially Magnussen by a lot in what was a slower car. People had this\xa0 thing in their head that Haas is a small team so they must be shit and they kept AM as 5th fastest car in their head even though they were only faster than Sauber and Williams once they ran out of parts"", 'Than you!', ""Yep, it's as they think it's morel likely drivers vary by a ton season to season, or even race to race, than cars.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

There, they both still had a lot winning to do and they were somewhat still in the prime of their careers.\n\nHamilton, yes they'll be 101% focussed on winning and no doubt re commitment or fire - but there is a hint of epilogue to it all that the other two didn't have.
