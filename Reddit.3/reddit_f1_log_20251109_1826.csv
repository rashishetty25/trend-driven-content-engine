1osgskk,I looked at 800 overtakes from the last 30+ years at Interlagos. Here’s where you actually want to sit,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osgskk/i_looked_at_800_overtakes_from_the_last_30_years/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I’ve always heard people say the Senna S is the best place to watch the Brazilian GP, but I wanted to know if that’s actually true. So I went through data from the past 30+ years (roughly 1990–2023) and looked at around **800 on-track overtakes** at Interlagos to see where the action really happens.

**Main Straight / Start–Finish, Best overall**  
About half of all overtakes happen here. The long DRS zone and slipstreaming make it the busiest part of the circuit, and you see cars pull out to pass right in front of you. Plus you get the start, pit stops, and podium. **Grandstand A** is the go-to spot if you want overtakes and atmosphere in one.

**Turn 1 (Senna S), Pure action**  
Roughly a quarter of the overtakes happen here. Cars come flying down the straight and dive under braking. It’s chaotic on lap 1 and great throughout the race.  
**Grandstand M** sits right at the end of the straight with a perfect view into the Senna S, while **Grandstand B** is slightly further back but still sees the braking zone and the start of the corner.

**Turn 4 (Descida do Lago), Underrated gem**  
Around 10 % of the overtakes happen here. It’s the second DRS zone, downhill, and you often get side-by-side moves that carry through the corner. **Grandstand G** looks straight down the hill and gives a great sense of speed.

**Best spot**  
If you combine the main straight and Turn 1, you’re looking at roughly **80 % of all overtakes** over the past three decades, which matches what most F1 analysis sites say about Interlagos’ two DRS braking zones being where nearly everything happens.

**Turn-by-Turn Ranking (top 8)**

| Rank | Location       | Total Overtakes | % of Total | Avg/Race |
|------|----------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| 1    | Main Straight  | 471             | 53.2%      | 14.7     |
| 2    | Turn 1         | 227             | 25.6%      | 7.1      |
| 3    | Turn 4         | 80              | 9.0%       | 2.5      |
| 4    | Turn 2         | 24              | 2.7%       | 0.8      |
| 5    | Turn 6         | 19              | 2.1%       | 0.6      |
| 6    | Turn 3         | 13              | 1.5%       | 0.4      |
| 7    | Turn 10        | 10              | 1.1%       | 0.3      |
| 8    | Turn 12        | 9               | 1.0%       | 0.3      |

**TL;DR:**

* **Main Straight (Grandstand A)** – best all-round experience and most overtakes (~50% of overtakes)
* **Turn 1 (Grandstand M or B)** – most dramatic corner action (~25% of overtakes)
* **Turn 4 (Grandstand G)** – cheaper and still plenty going on (~9% of overtakes)

If you can get a seat that shows both the straight and the Senna S, you’ll catch almost all the overtakes live.

1osfra3,Lewis Hamilton & Ferrari - a discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osfra3/lewis_hamilton_ferrari_a_discussion/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I'm wondering in people are able to help me understand a little bit about the history of Scuderia Ferrari, the team dynamics, and whether it's realistic for Hamilton to be successful there before he retires. A few facts below.

* With respect to the Constructors and Drivers Championships, and in absolute terms, Ferrari are the most successful F1 team in history with 16 and 15 titles respectively. The second and third most successful teams are McLaren and Williams
* Ferrari's last Driver Championship is held by Raikkonen, won in 2007 and the last Constructors Championship was won in 2008. This means a Drivers title hasn't been won there for 18 years
* Since that period, 7 drivers have driven for Ferrari: Alonso, Massa, Vettel, Raikkonen, Leclerc, Sainz, and Hamilton. Out of those 7 drivers, 4 are World Champions and 3 are multiple World Champions
* Being a historic Italian outfit and almost a ""religion"" in Italy, Ferrari are based there, whereas most other teams (aside from a couple) are based in the UK
* Several individuals were instrumental in bringing Hamilton across to Ferrari including those with significant power i.e.,
   * Jon Elkan - Chairman and major stakeholder
   * Fred Vasseur - Team Principal
* Lewis Hamilton is now 40 years old however it was only 4 years ago (2021) when he finished 2nd in the Drivers Championship and 2 years ago (2023) when he finished 3rd with unprecedented dominance in front

I could lay out some more facts but based on the above I have some questions as I genuinely do not know the answers but hoping some folks can provide some more colour...

*  Why are Ferrari reluctant to shake up their team or are seemingly reluctant to take constructive feedback from their drivers (including a 7 time world champion) when what they have been doing for the last 18 years clearly hasn't been working?
* Hamilton has been in race winning cars since the start of career so why does it appear his feedback and/or constructive criticism isn't being well received? Drivers input is surely significant given that Schumacher is widely credited with helping drive forward the dominant Ferrari of the past
* Leclerc is of course a brilliant driver, however Hamilton is a champion. I know some people call him a rocket ship merchant but people have short memories and there are countless examples of Hamilton brilliance. His experience is second to none
* Why for example is Jon Elkan, the Chairman, top boss, and guy who brought Hamilton over not saying we need to listen to this guy, no exceptions? it appears to me that with the team consolidated in Italy, there isn't much wiggle room
* Why are some team members who are clearly not effective such as Adami not being reshuffled or sacked?
* Some people think that Ferrari wouldn't want Hamilton to break Schumacher's records or are embarrassing him in favour of Leclerc - how much truth is there to this?
* Why would Ferrari employ a 40 year old Hamilton if they think it wouldn't work? Some people state he is old and past his prime however we have seen that only 2 years ago he came 3rd in the Championship
* What are the realistic chances Ferrari will reflect on the errors of their ways and help Hamilton secure a title?
* What is actually going on here? Surely a team isn't arrogant enough to not want to WIN and are just trading off a historical brand name.

That’s how they are and they are not going to change."", 'My view of Ferrari is that their periods of success have always come when Italians aren’t running the team….', ""Ferrari doesn't really encourage the same culture as other teams, there is an element of fear still rampant throughout the team.   \nThey don't give any TP the time needed or the power needed to turn things around, they want to win but they don't understand how to.\n\nAlso, I'm not convinced the strat department is as bad as we all think, I tend to believe that someone in the back is overrulling a lot of calls.

Getting Lewis made fantastic marketing sense. In an ideal world theyd be winning too, but they have a driver more than capable of winning a title in Leclerc.

Absolutely bonkers.\n\nAlso, they could have hired LH to improve for the future. Ferrari wants to win now, but also knows that things take time. So why not listen, and get some perspective, from someone experienced and, more important, outside of the team?', 'It’s pretty obvious there isn’t just one reason, and honestly firing everyone like people keep saying isn’t gonna fix anything. A team needs some stability, and changing things too much or too often, especially in a reactive way like Ferrari’s done before, just makes things worse. I also find it kinda funny how everyone treats the team’s “Italian side” like it’s a problem, or the problem, but then you see some of those “incompetent Italians” doing great once they leave (Stella, Costa...) while a few of the so called foreign geniuses who joined just ended up failing or adding more confusion but I guess the agenda’s gotta keep “agending” lol.\xa0\n\nWhen it comes to Hamilton, it’s clearly just a legacy thing. I get the feeling a lot of people in the team would’ve rather stuck with Sainz, but the call came from the top so… whatever. Sure, the team should try to listen to him more, but it goes both ways, with the exception of some pr friendly statements, he hasn’t really done much to fit in. Basically he’s asking the team to\xa0fully adapt not to his prime version, but to what effectively seems like the fading version of himself (or at least is perceived as such). They are both stubborn, totally a doomed marriage from the start\n\n\nEdit: one thing I forgot, they’re also really weak politically. People often talk about the bonus they get from FIA, but it’s almost like that’s their only leverage. In recent years sporting rules, even midseason, have mostly followed the direction pushed by other top teams rather than theirs, add in that they’re slow to react and develop, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for failure.\xa0']",0,34,0.3,0,25,25,0,34,0.3,0
1orxtng,F1 needs better yellow flag/full course yellow systems,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1orxtng/f1_needs_better_yellow_flagfull_course_yellow/,2025-11-08, Discussion,"I’m constantly amazed at how slow f1 is sometimes at throwing full yellow flags for big incidents, and Bortoletto’s crash today was a perfect example. 

A driver has had a huge, high speed accident which triggers the medical car, and yet they allow everyone else to continue racing at full speed up until the final straight. What happens if there is a second incident that requires the medical car? (Im hoping they have a second medical car on standby, but I’m unsure on this, so correct me if you know please)

Looking at Indycar, full course yellows are thrown as soon as there is an incident. I do think they are sometimes too quick to throw these, and sometimes put them out for no reason, which can be frustrating. However, during obviously big incidents, Indycar are so much quicker at neutralising the race and ensuring safety. They also have the fantastic AMR safety team who are positioned all over the circuits, and are on the scene of accidents in far shorter times than f1. Just look at Max’s Baku crash in 2021 for example. Max gets out of the car by himself, and is stood on the track with cars passing him at high speeds (which is my next point) before the medical car gets to him. The AMR team in Indycar are almost always on the scene immediately to help a driver out of the car.

And as I said, my next point is just how fast drivers are still able to travel under yellow flag conditions. All a driver has to to to comply with a single yellow flag is to lift off the throttle, which does next to nothing in terms of reducing speed, although granted it does slightly reduce the chance of a driver losing control. Drivers are able to travel at well over 200kph through yellow flags without breaking the rules, which is frankly insane.

I think it’s about time f1/fia take a leaf from Indycara book, and look at improving their yellow flag and safety car procedures
 ","[""For starters if you look back. After the Bortoletto crash, what they did was viably the only real option. \n\nBy the time the crash happened everyone was already past him. So neutralizing the race (VCS) while no-one was gonna go past the crash site in race conditions would have been a weird move\n\nIt was the final lap of the race. A safety car wouldn't come on until the next lap so no chance for that, and pulling a red-flag would mean the race would end anyway. \n\nAnd the double waved yellows were flown from T14 to T2. Meaning that after T12, any form of drag-race to the start wouldn't have been possible anymore anyway. Mitigating any major risk that a car will shoot off and go into T1. \n\nNot saying it could have never happened. And maybe in hindsight cars could have been given a call to not enter the track at T15, instead drive through the pitlane across the finish line. But organizing that within seconds is incredibly hard to do. \n\nAlso in form of Yellow flags, you might have missed that they were waving double waved yellows. These have a bit more requirements than a standard yellow flag. Mainly meaning that the driver is to reduce speeds significantly. So you saying the can go past a crash as 200kph is unlikely as that would mean the driver has barely slowed down. And a driver should always be ready and prepared under yellow flags to stop the car if necessary. All cars in a double waved yellow zone were driving at speeds that they could stop the car almost instantly. \n\nAnd while I am not fully familiar with Indycar's methods. Remember the F1 logistics that compared to Indycar, F1 is Global. So having a team of lets say 50 specialists flown out to every race in case an accident happens on track. For 24 weeks out of the year. Is crazy to do. Also considering track length, Indycar needs less marshaling posts manned per race weekend. With their 3 longest tracks being 6,5km 4,3km and 4km. F1's tracks are on average much longer with every single track on the calendar, except for Monaco, being longer than 4km in length. Monaco, the shortest track on the F1 calendar, would be 8th longest track in Indycar. \n\nAnd those specialists and equipment would be need to shipped all over the world, to be standing next to the track in case something happens +24 weeks out of the year. While in the US the Indycar season is much shorter with the season starting in March and ending in August. And all their races being exclusively within the United States, Making transport and housing them much simpler to do."", ""> Looking at Indycar, full course yellows are thrown as soon as there is an incident.\n\nI think Marcus Ericsson disagrees with that one.\n\nF1 distinguishes between single and double waved yellow flags. Double waved yellow flags mandate a ''significant'' reduction in speed and preparation to stop if necessary. A single waved yellow doesn't specify the significant reduction and only demands a driver be prepared to change direction, not stop.\n\nThere is a distinction and the system works perfectly fine. It certainly works a lot better than leaving a race completely green with a car stranded on the entry into a blind corner so the leaders can make their pit stops."", ""meh, realistically it's  acrash after the finish at the end of a race where they can just finisht he race and everyone will naturally be slow after the line because they aren't racing.\n\nUltimately safety is key, but if the race is ending before they even get there again there is very little risk. They also have more than one medical car, the actual risk of multiple medical car needing crashes is beyond minimal and ruining the final lap of a race for fundamentally not much reason just isn't really worth it."", 'The fact you seemingly don’t understand the difference between single and double yellows, or that they even exist, kinda invalidates your whole post.', 'Well, Indycar is raced on ovals with significantly shorter tracks.... also the speed difference makes running into a dangerous sector a higher risk endeavor.', ""I'm surprised that people are disagreeing with you. \n\nF1 is absolutely horrible at putting out flags, and responding to incidents, so many other series around the world get to a driver within 30 seconds to a minute at most and put out a red flag within 10 seconds, in F1 it would be a miracle to respond that quickly and normally within a minute, most of the time it's 1-3 minutes which is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nIt's such a huge safety risk which I just don't understand at all. The group I'm with absolutely agrees to, it's just absolutely appalling their response time."", 'Valid points about the logistics of Indycar vs f1. I disagree with them not having any other options for gabi’s crash though. They really shouldn’t have had drivers entering turn 1, I forgot to mention that in my original post. They could have easily thrown a red flag, which requires drivers to enter the pit lane anyway. They do this during qualifying whenever there is an incident, but seem way too cautious to do this during a race. It was the last lap anyway, it should have been stopped with no restart', ""This is nothing to do with single Vs double waved yellows really, it's the reaction speed of F1 when dealing with an accident that is a huge issue.\n\nAfter a high speed crash like that the race should have been IMMEDIATELY red flagged or have a vsc within 5 seconds and the medical car released 10 seconds after that. I don't have the footage to check how long it took today.\n\nThere's been MANY incidents from big crashes where the driver has gotten out of the car and waited by the track for 2 minutes before the medical car got to him which is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nF1 has a real issue for how long it takes to respond to crashes."", 'How do I not understand single and double yellows?']",0,46,0.31,0,94,94,0,31,0.010000000000000009,0
