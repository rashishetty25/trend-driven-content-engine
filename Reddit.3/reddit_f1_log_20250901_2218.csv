1n5trk2,My Experience with Disabilities at the Dutch Grand Prix – Accessibility in F1 Needs Serious Attention,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n5trk2/my_experience_with_disabilities_at_the_dutch/,2025-09-01, Discussion,"Hi all,
I wanted to share my experience attending the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix as someone living with Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, in the hope it raises awareness around how inaccessible F1 events can be for fans with disabilities.
This was my first Grand Prix, and I was so excited to finally go. I’d booked the F1 Experiences Live Pit Straight package (not exactly a budget ticket) and reached out months in advance to explain my needs – mainly urgent toilet access and limited mobility when walking fast or through crowds. I made it really clear that I carry a ""Can’t Wait"" card due to my Crohn’s and need bathroom access urgently at times.

Here’s how it went:
Thursday – Track Experience Day:
No seating in the main areas during waiting times for the pit walk or guest appearances. I had to stand for hours, which caused joint pain.

No visible bathrooms near the food trucks, so I avoided eating altogether in case I needed the toilet quickly.
The pit lane walk was late in the day, and most garages were closing down due to curfew – it felt like others who went earlier got a more engaging experience.

Friday–Sunday – Race Days:
My grandstand seat (Row 2, Seat 134 on the Pit Straight Grandstand) was not near the extra care court, despite requests. I had to walk through heavy crowds to reach it – not ideal when you physically can’t move fast or stand comfortably.
On Saturday, I had an arthritis flare-up and couldn’t make it back to my seat. I spent most of the day in the care court instead.

The extra care court staff were amazing – they offered me a chair and even helped with ice for my knee. But I missed out on watching most of the race from my actual seat because it was just too far from the bathroom.
The bigger issue:

It honestly feels like basic accessibility at F1 events is tied to VIP ticket levels. If you want decent toilet access, seating support, or less walking, you have to spend thousands. That’s not right.

Accessible event planning shouldn’t be treated as a luxury add-on. I paid over £1,400 for my ticket and still ended up spending half the weekend worrying about whether I could reach a toilet in time.

As a fan, a content creator, and someone living with chronic illness, I want to enjoy the sport I love without feeling like I don’t belong at the track. And I know I’m not the only one.


Final thoughts:
F1 needs to do better. Accessibility shouldn't depend on how much you can afford. I’d love to see:
Clearly marked accessible toilets and seating near all grandstands.
Disability support staff onsite for guidance.
More flexibility in seating assignments for those who request help in advance.

Actual disability liaison contacts for fans planning to attend.
I’ll be sharing more content about my experience to raise awareness, but I wanted to start here. If you’ve had a similar experience or know of other venues doing accessibility well, I’d love to hear about it.


Thanks for reading – feel free to share or comment if you think this is a conversation F1 needs to keep having.

Edit: when I say private bathrooms I mean a disabled bathroom
I am also not asking for anything I am just raising awareness for other disabled guest who want to go to a F1 Grand Prix","['I sympathize with you because I was at the Dutch GP and it was very difficult to navigate the crowds and the foot traffic at times. \n\nHonestly though I can’t imagine trying to attend an event like this with Crohns. I grew up attending large sporting events (major league baseball, football, hockey, and basketball) and this is my second F1 GP. I’ve also been to Wacken Open Air festival in Germany with 90k people. Bathrooms are always a problem at any event of this kind. I personally felt that bathroom access at the Dutch GP was decent and better than at Suzuka. The problem wasn’t accessibility per se (we sat in the pit grand stands, row 1, pretty close to you actually) as we were able to reach them quickly. The problem is simply the sheer volume of people. Foot traffic was insane. It took forever to get anywhere and going from our section (126/127) to where the extra care court was located would have taken a bit outside of going when F1 was on track. \n\nHow could they have done this better? The only thing I can think of would have been simply having more bathrooms and perhaps keep some maintained strictly for folks with urgent needs. But I don’t think they did a poor job, it’s just the reality of events this size.\n\nI think the biggest thing they could and should do would be to manage foot traffic. There’s no gates, lanes, or anything to direct people either in the circuit or outside on the way to the train stations. Just a giant clusterfuck of people jostling their way through. Completely the opposite experience to Japan and it made the whole experience much less pleasant, especially since I get anxiety in large crowds.', 'Did you consider buying tickets for the extra care platform?\n\nMy experience there on Sunday was very good. True the seating was on ground level so not the best view. But near accessible toilets and with personel for care.\n\nAgree that accessible toilets should be available for every ticket option.\n\nAddition: The Netherlands is behind general accessibility. But F1 is regarded as one of the most accessible event of the country. They let an external party Handicap.nl organize it for them. Their only focus on people with disabilities makes it good / great.', 'Sorry that you had such a bad experience. Hope you comments reach the right people and they take it seriously.', 'Arent there toilets directly under those grandstands? At least last year there were', ""Can you go through this with us?\n\nhttps://dutchgp.com/app/uploads/2025/08/2025_F1-Netherlands-Wayfinding-Map_Negative_VISUAL.pdf\n\nhttps://oversteer48.com/ben-pon-grandstand-zandvoort/#:~:text=As%20the%20video%20shows%2C%20sitting,your%20view%20of%20Turn%201.\n\nThe pit grandstand (27) where you bought your ticket for (you didn't buy a main grandstand ticket which is nearer to the extra care court) seat 134, from what I can see, has toilets directly underneath it at that location, and there is a stairway access point directly down to it at the back, so you move to the back of the stand of where you are and make your way down to the toilets. Is that not urgent toilet access?\n\nOn the map, wherever there is a food icon, there is a bathroom icon nearby. You say you didn't see a visible bathroom near the food trucks and therefore didn't eat but if you followed the map, which you get with your F1 experience ticket, would you have found one very quickly?\n\nYou also say you are a content creater and you will be sharing more content about your experience and you are starting here, what else will you be sharing?"", 'From what I have read there was a special care zone with own bathrooms but on Saturday your knee played up (not the fault of the track), and on other days it was too busy to get past the crowd.. but what can you expect? It’s a Crowed event with crowded stands… \n\nI was there and was impressed with all the toilets (below every stand), with all the support staff, stands, a way to give an SOS trough the app, there were people using wheelchairs and getting special help, lots of medical and support stuff.\n\nIn my opinion you are generalizing the event and stating like you were entitled just because you paid more and are a content creator. It sucks you didn’t have a great experience, but I do feel like you are placing the event in a bad light for a situation they couldn’t have handled with everything going on.\n\nEdit: i also watched your VOD and it shows you streaming for 3+ hours multiple times without going to the bathroom once….', 'I’m seeing lots of Americans thinking we have this right, but as a disabled person at COTA a few years ago, I don’t think we should be resting on our laurels. \n\nIn my situation, I’m and older woman that struggles with mobility, but I wasn’t asking for anything other than what COTA said that it was providing - I knew there would be long walks, long waits and I planned accordingly. What I hadn’t planned on were shuttles that never came, or shuttles that so full from previous stops that certain locations on the track were without transportation options entirely for what turned out to be hours at a time. \n\nThere was a back-up! Armies of golf carts had been hired, but we learned that with one exception, the only way to get a ride was to bribe them - something they were explicitly not allowed to do. We were once told that “tips were appreciated”. Another said, “We are raising money for charity if you’d like to make a donation.” We actually were relieved by the honesty of one woman saying, “I’m charging $20 a ride.” \n\nAs with so many things pertaining to disability rights, improving conditions for the disabled improves them for everyone. Running more shuttles and taking time to ensure all stops have shuttles that can take passengers makes the experience better for everyone. Hiring the golf carts for those with extra needs is a good plan on paper, but when those drivers become extra independent contractors that broke down trust and confidence quickly. \n\nGood planning, good follow through and transparency aren’t limited to disability access - they are the hallmarks of good event planning. Disabled patrons are often the first to notice when that falls apart, but by the second day, it was evident to most.', ""As someone who also suffers from Crohns I just wanted to comment that I understand the struggle you faced more than most. \n\nI've been thinking about trying to watch a race live in the future but this made me question if that will be possible - thank you for sharing."", 'I’m sorry that happened and I completely agree they need to do better. I also had a poor accessibility experience in Melbourne attending with someone with mobility issues. It’s definitely not limited to one location, feels like accessibility is just not prioritised in the planning of fan experience.']",448,155,0.74,448,128,128,39,15,-0.010000000000000009,39

The soonest Piastri can clinch is COTA, if Norris scores 0 points and Verstappen scores less than 71 in the next 4 races. If Piastri were to win every GP, he would clinch in Vegas no matter what Norris does (even if Norris were to win the COTA and Brazil sprints, and Piastri scored 0 in them).

Even with Norris' DNF, McLaren can still break 1000 points, and owing to Ferrari's double DNF, they continue with more than double the points of 2nd place. 

The soonest McLaren can clinch is still Baku, which they will be guaranteed to do with either 2 1-2's or a 1-2 and a 1-3 in Monza and Baku.

I love all of that, and I love building teams, so it’s just a bigger team to put together as team principal than it was as a sporting director or mechanic.\n\n\nIt\'s the ""seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee. I love all of that.""', '100%.  The guy was arguably the real reason of their dominance.  \n\nThat\'s the problem with domination, and people have seen it in the Merc downfall.    Team dominates year after year, and no promotions for the key players.   Really showed that bad management style of Toto.  He kept key people in the same positions to maintain the status quo, to impress the board.   \n\nA lot of Toto fans will hate to read this, but Toto bought his way into the sport with Williams.  Lucked into a Merc role after Ross Brawn had to fall on the sword after the illegal tyre test.    In business, it would be called a ""hostile takeover"" by Toto.  No way the board got rid of Ross Brawn if someone wasn\'t earworming them behind the scenes.  Like the Mansour toppling Ron.  \n\nLauda and Toto were at loggerheads, which people forget, and only after Lauda\'s passing, the whole Toto <3 Lauda stuff came to appear.\n\nHaving someone like a Wheately, a James Vowles, or a Paddy Lowe, on a team, where the progression ceiling is just a dead end for years....\n\nAt least someone like Zak Brown recognised that career stagnation of the key people, is a fast course to failure.    Create different position names, where it\'s like a promotion to a new role etc.  Reward people and promote.   Stella for example.  Leaves Ferrari with Alonso, as he knows the Ferrari culture of modern times.   Works his way up from Race Engineer to TP.  \n\nRob Smedley should have been given Ferrari TP a long long time ago.  Long-term F1 key person, and he just left the sport because of that ceiling.\n\nOld school mentality, like Ron in McLaren, having Whitmarsh as the trainee to the crown.  Seasons pass, person still holds on, thinking ... the day will come... and then the day comes, and it\'s too late.  It\'s old school Independent Team mentality.  \n\nHorner shouled have stepped aside, given himself a new role description like Zak, and elevated Wheatley to TP.\n\nMuch like Toto showed that he wasn\'t a natural leader, trying to keep the status quo, rather than reward people to stop them from leaving.', ""Horner's reputation could be a factor but it is also a natural situation that people who have been in their position for quite a long time look for something new. The same happened at Mercedes, a lot of other teams and companies in general around the world. Wheatley could have been a logical successor just like James Vowles at Mercedes but the timing wasn't right. It took too long for the Red Bull HQ to find a way to fire Horner."", 'Why i this argument only ever made about red bull when Merc are in exactl the same situation?', ""It's the site Mike Spinelli put up after he sold Jalopnik, way back in the day."", 'Based on what was Wheatley the „real reason“, you really need to explain that.\n\nAlso how are the teams supposed to give those promotions what do you do with the people already in that position.\xa0', "">\xa0That's the problem with domination, and people have seen it in the Merc downfall.

Step down and promote JV to keep him?\n\n\nEvery NBA NFL AFL Soccer team has this problem year after year of dominating.

These rules of engagement are not conducive for actual racing. A driver can simply be ahead at the apex, know they have right of way, meaning they can just drive to the outside of the corner knowing they cannot be challenged, or if an accident occurs knowing they will not be at fault.

We need cars to go side by side to overtake, it’s just a fact. If a car can hold the outside line, for almost the entire corner, and be almost in line or at least half way up to the car alongside it, the inside driver should be required to leave one cars width in the exit. 

The current rules allow two cars in to a corner, but only one to come out. If two go in, two should come out. We are losing classic battles and excitement in the sport. 

Would really love to see something changed. Rant over!","[""The problem is trying to have a one size fits all rule.

Continuing on from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n197mv/what_if_f1_had_geographical_championships_in/) that I posted last week, here are the updated tables for the hypothetical 2025 F1 European Championship.

In the Drivers' table, there was a lot of movement in the Top 10. Oscar took over the lead from Lando, Max is now in third, and George is now in fifth. Isack's podium allowed him to go from 11th to eighth, and Lance got closer to the Top 10 with another 7th place finish. Meanwhile, a haul of eight points for Ollie saw him hit double digits.

In the Constructors' table, Racing Bulls, Williams, and Aston Martin all leapfrogged Sauber, while Haas was able to get out of the basement, and lock Alpine in.",['Antonelli with 1 point 😬'],8,1,0.72,8,1,1,3,0,0.08999999999999997,3
1n5a3ij,what are the little details/stories in f1 that make it more fun to follow?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n5a3ij/what_are_the_little_detailsstories_in_f1_that/,2025-09-01, Discussion,"hey everyone, i’m pretty new to f1 and i’ve been watching some beginner guides on youtube to get a feel for the basics. they’re super helpful for stuff like rules, points, drs, tires, etc. but i feel like they don’t really cover the other side of the sport.

i’d love to hear from people who’ve been following f1 for a while:
	•	are there any controversies, rivalries, or stories that shaped the sport that beginners usually don’t hear about right away?
	•	any small details you wish you knew earlier that made watching races more fun?
	•	stuff that’s not really “official” but more like insider knowledge or fan culture?
	•	even just tips for following along during race weekends or things that the broadcasts don’t always explain.

basically… anything you know that’s beyond the surface level guides. would really appreciate any insights :)","[""Especially this year, you'll hear a lot of reference to the 2016 title battle between rosberg and hamilton. There are quite a few parallels between mclaren now and clear lessons that have been learnt from that year.  2021 championship battle between hamilton and verstappen with the infamous abu dhabi race at the end is also key f1 lore."", 'If you enjoy reading, \xa0you should check out Senna V Prost by Malcolm Folley.

Aussie Grit is about Mark Webber’s rise to F1. His sports car stuff was really good as well as the insight into his battle against Sebastian Vettel during his Red Bull days. The Mechanic basically gives you insight into what it’s like working on the road crew for an F1 team. Has some really good stuff. Especially the epic 2007 season battle between Alonso and Hamilton. Also has some really good behind the scenes stuff about Kimi Raikkonen.\xa0\nLet me know if you have any questions or looking for other suggestions.\xa0\n\nPs: If you haven’t already, check out the movie Rush with Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl.\xa0', 'Check out a podcast or YouTube channel like P1 with Matt and Tommy.

A driver could finish 12th and it could be their drive of the season, or could have a mediocre race and finish 5th. There are championship battles and even career battles happening at all levels of the gird, not just the front, and a good finish or a strong race could be worth millions of dollars or a new contract."", 'To me it’s the history. I have been following F1 for over 50 years, saw the odd race here and there (I’m not frequent visitor, because, well, money), so I know a bit about every team, every driver. I have seen and sometimes met many young drivers before they were even in F1 (f.i. Senna in Formula Fords, Vettel in Formel BMW), and met a fair number of drivers/people involved in F1 throughout the years. It makes F1 alive and not as distant as you can sometimes feel as a spectator. Of cpurse, I can’t transfer this feel, but you can build it up as well. So to F3 races, you’ll see how close you can get and who knows you can also snap pictures of the next Norris, Russell, Schumacher and others as they step into their cars.']",0,5,0.44,0,5,5,-1,0,-0.09000000000000002,-1

Obviously F2 Pirellis aren\'t identical to F1 ones, but they\'re certainly closer than Indy Firestones.

Per an article on the Race, Pirelli gets sim data from all teams for tire development and they've raised a concern that they were seeing a 4s a lap field spread on the sim data. That's massive and not an encouraging sign for close racing. I'm sure we'll be a lot closer by the time the lights go out in Melbourne but a rule change of this magnitude usually leads to a few years of a single team dominating. If Mercedes crack the engine and fuel rules, expect to see McLaren's dominance continue because the works Mercedes team has given no signs they can be competitive under a budget cap. If Ferrari crack it, the works Ferrari team will dominate as none of the customers are good enough to be in the mix. RBPT, Honda and Audi acing it would all lead to single team dominance.
