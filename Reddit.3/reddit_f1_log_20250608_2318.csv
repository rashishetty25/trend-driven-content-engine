""I even sent him an Instagram DM once. A very long one where I told him all about it. But I didn't get a reply.

So, I worked very closely with a psychologist, a sports psychologist. Almost my entire career, especially in my world champion year. Sometimes I sat with him for up to 2 hours every other day, going through everything that was possible. Visualizing, repeating, meditating, everything. If I were his psychologist, the first thing I would say is, of course, that's wonderful for us. Yes, he makes himself very approachable. He shows his feelings, his doubts. That's great, of course. But for him, I would recommend that he doesn't repeat it over and over again, because in the repetition, at some point you also reinforce it in yourself.""

It almost seems like having no experience with the car ( and possibly not having to unlearn behaviors) is a larger benefit than experience. 

Do the current generation of cars have individual unique qualities that are more exemplified than in previous generations? 

I'm using Bearman/Ocon, Bortoleto/Hulkenburg, Sainz/Albon, Hamilton/Leclerc as examples. I also consider the Lawson/Hadjar Racing Bulls and Colapinto/Alpine in this bucket as well but there's not been as many races for them.","[""Apparently what confounds many drivers is that the current gen really don't react well to hustle.\n\nSo if you're not quick, your instinct is to give it a bit of stick, and they don't react well to that. \n\nAlonso was saying that often you can go slower when you push, quote unquote."", 'I don\'t know how it is compared to previous regulations, but you sometimes forget that the cars aren\'t just made by different manufacturers, they\'re also completely unique, no part is the same between teams.

Mostly to do with the fact that as they slow the cars, downforce doesnt bleed off linearly in a predictable manner. I think it was Ocon who put it best, there is one very specific way to drive these cars, not like previous generations where you would have 3 ways to get the maximum.\n\nNow every team handles the downforce issue a bit differently. Which is why Max can tame his car, while his teammates struggle, Leclerc and Sainz had moments where either did better when design philosophy went one way. Arguably a case can be made for Ham and Rusell. in 2023 when Ham got the car he wanted, he was p3 in the constructors, when (it can be argued) it was more towards Rusell, he struggled, Russel did beat him, but was only p6.\n\nBasically these gen cars are kinda shit, drivers dont like them, engineers dont like them either.

They booked their tickets from the dutch GP website, while I bought mine from the official formula tickets website. When I bought the ticket, the only option was to choose the section (eastside 2A-same as my friends), NO SEAT SELECTION was available. So I bought the ticket.\n\nA few days ago, my friends told me that they received info about their tickets being assigned to specific seat numbers, which was sent to them a couple days ago. This got me very upset, as I have not known about any automatic seat allocation (zero mention on the website). \n\nNot only that, since I bought from the formula tickets website, I won't have any info until two weeks before the race.\n\nAnd I just want to ask: Is that how it is? You buy a ticket, and even though they don't let you select a seat or inform you on it, they just assign a seat months after? I have no clue what I am about to do......\n\nIs it possible to just sit next to my friends when I go to the grand prix or are the seat allocations strictly enforced? I am asking because I've never been to a race before....\n\nWhat should I do?"", 'Will the new front wing regulations that were introduced for Spain potentially cause any upsets in other tracks, reducing the gap to the leaders, etc (as it didn‚Äôt seem to do much to the pecking order in Spain)?

I'm new to F1, so apologies if this is an obvious question.  \n  \nI know McLaren buys PUs from Mercedes, but given how dominant McLaren is right now, why wouldn't Mercedes stop selling to McLaren? I figure it could be for a lot of reasons: contractual obligations, Mercedes might be making a ton from it, it may look bad to stifle competition like this, etc. But was curious if anyone knows the main reason why.\n\nThis crossed my mind after Williams pulled their little stunt at Mercedes' expense in Monaco, and some people were saying Vowles had to finesse the situation since they're dependent on Mercedes PUs. Why wouldn't McLaren be subject to that same pressue?""]",11,73,0.76,11,90,90,0,2,0.0,0
