1jw1g8g,"Is it the consensus opinion that Hamilton was better/more talented than Alonso, at their peak?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jw1g8g/is_it_the_consensus_opinion_that_hamilton_was/,2025-04-10, Discussion,"I know people hastily point to 2007 as definite proof of Hamilton being better, even though I'd argue 2007 was Alonso's worst season. Had to adapt to new tyres, didn't like the brakes of the car, and let Ron's management and his own paranoia to reach his head.

Still, after Mclaren finally changed his breaks at Silverstone, he outqualified and outpointed Hamilton for the rest of the season. Still, it was a mighty fight and Hamilton remains the most impressive rookie season of all time.

But then from 2008 to 2014, I think it's arguable that Alonso was the better driver in most seasons. 

In 2008, Hamilton was weirdly doing mistakes he wasn't doing in his rookie season. Both him and Massa seemed to have been trying to gift the championship to eachother. I can't help but feel Alonso would have cruised to an easy championship if he stayed at Mclaren, he was incredibly consistent in 2008, but the Renault was an average car.

In 2009 they both drove well, better than Button or Vettel who were doing lots of mistakes. It's hard to tell.

In 2010 again both drove well, probably better than Vettel. Maybe Lewis takes it because I feel Alonso has more notorious mistakes like Spa.

In 2011 Alonso was definetely better. Hamilton had probably his worst year in F1.

In 2012 I can't really say Hamilton drove bad, he was really good when Mclaren weren't fucking him up, but Alonso also had his best season ever, next to 2006. Ferrari were more or less the 4th fastest car, though reliability probably take them above Mclaren as the 3rd best car of the season.

In 2013 again I think Alonso was better. Maybe some of you have different opinions. Hamilton was still accomodating at a new team.

After 2014 it's impossible to tell, mostly because Lewis would go on to enjoy probably the best run of cars in F1 ever, with a championship capable car every season, and 4 dominant cars, while Alonso will experience some of the worst, at least in the modern era, with the 2015-2017 Mclaren Hondas.

Still, for what it is worth, Alonso had a bigger %avg race page gap between him and Button than what Lewis did. His gap to Massa is also big enough to accomodate for the gap between Hamilton and Bottas and the gap between Bottas and Massa, for some cross comparison.

Both are actually consistent with the average %gap between Alonso and Hamilton in 2007. Hamilton enjoyed a -0.05% advantage in quali, while Alonso enjoyed a -0.05% in race pace. So they were both within half a tenth of eachother, just with different strenghts.

What's your opinion? For me these 2 guys are the 3rd and 4th best drivers of all time, though I switch them up depending on how I wake up on the day. One thing is clear, I think Alonso might have the biggest gap between his talent and level of achievements, maybe other than G. Villeneuve.","['In the f1 community, is there ever a consensus on anything?', ""It's F1 rarely is anyone competing on the same field.

Had to adapt to new tyres, didn't like the brakes of the car, and let Ron's management and his own paranoia to reach his head.\n\nThe whole adapt to new tyres thing is nonsense though- Whilst GP2 were supplied by Bridgestone they were completely different to the tyres in F1. F1 used Grooved tyres whilst GP2 used slick tyres, with different compounds made to different specs. If Alonso had to adapt to the Bridgestone F1 tyres so did Lewis. \n\nPlus its also worth noting that when Hamilton did his test session against Pedro de la Rosa where McLaren were deciding which driver to pick based on their lap times. they were still using the Michelin tyres back then, so Lewis did better lap times than the Mclaren test driver on the Michelin tyres.\n\nthis argument makes more sense for Kimi and Massa than it does Lewis and Alonso"", 'For me there\'s no comparison. Hamilton is the top driver in history, Alonso, top 10.\n\nHamilton, for me, stands alone. What makes him special is his ability to race hard but CLEAN. He raced at the level of Schumacher, Senna.

What made Schumacher a legend was the entire package. It wasn\'t about just his driving, he made \'racing driver\' into a professional athlete.

1jw23n1,Isn't Japan the way it is supposed to be?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jw23n1/isnt_japan_the_way_it_is_supposed_to_be/,2025-04-10, Discussion,"If you line all the cars up in order of how fast they go i.e. qualifying, and then barring any accidents, shouldn't they naturally finish in that order.

Japan has been deemed boring, yet it's quite surprising that more races aren't like this.

There were other issues such as on a damp drying track going off line made it even harder to pass.

If you want to spice things up, there's reverse grids, which is silly, qualifying 1st come last in Monacco. Or drivers trying to get the lowest qualifying time but within the 107%. So that's out.

Randomised grid order, everyone will start in 1 position once. Requires the same number of cars as there are races. Plus starting last is more of a hinderence at some tracks than others.
And its a literal lottery.

So here's my idea. 3 rounds of qualifying you must use soft, medium, and hard compounds. But once you use one in a round you can only use that tyre, unless it rains.

Teams at the back could start on soft and try to get to Q2 but will then have a disadvantage in the later rounds. It adds an aspect of strategy in to play, which will mix up the grids, but is still based on performance and team strategy.

Either it's fine as it is, or there needs to be a shake up. Anyone got a better idea?","['The only thing worse than a boring race is a race ruined by gimmicks.
