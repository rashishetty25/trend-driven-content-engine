Also worth noting: the first time Leclerc and Verstappen passed through the double-yellow zone, Verstappen gained nearly 4 tenths on Leclerc in the stadium by not slowing down as much. He almost passed Leclerc on the main straight by setting up the overtake (aka, racing) in a double yellow zone.

He basically demonstrated to race control that he wasnt going to properly respect a double-yellow, and use it to gain an advantage.  Totally understandable that race control will throw a quick VSC then let them race again.","[""What I found interesting was that there were local double yellows out for the final lap at this incident (after the VSC ended) but not the panels, and therefore the TV timing screen didn't show yellows in the final sector.

However in hindsight, now we have the details, it’s clear why they felt the need to put out the VSC. Safety needs to come first and double yellows do not always slow people down in the way they should. And I would imagine they were especially cautious after what happened earlier in the race with Lawson (which was the actual race control fuck up in all of this, not what happened at the end). People who are still arguing about this now we know the facts around it need to move on tbh.', ""I don't like it, especially the timing, but the VSC was 100% warranted over the double yellow.

1oh7gaq,Jenson Button's 2010 'Butterfly Effect' Rewrote F1 History,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oh7gaq/jenson_buttons_2010_butterfly_effect_rewrote_f1/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"A single driver move in 2010 changed the trajectory of multiple champions and the dynamics of the entire grid. When Jenson Button, fresh off his championship win with Brawn GP (the team that became Mercedes), opted for McLaren, he set off a chain of events that defined the next decade of F1.
What if Button had stayed?
Button at Mercedes (the dominant era): Button, with his smooth style and skill, would have had a second golden opportunity. He likely would have won multiple championships in the hybrid era, much like Lewis Hamilton.
Hamilton at McLaren: Without Button, Lewis's story with McLaren would have continued. He might have stayed longer, but it's unlikely he would have tolerated the McLaren-Honda disaster. His frustration would have pushed him to seek another top team, like Ferrari, completely changing his trajectory.
Vettel at Red Bull: Sebastian Vettel's frustration with Mercedes' dominance was the main reason for his departure to Ferrari in 2014. With Button at the wheel of the dominant Mercedes, Vettel might have hung on longer at Red Bull. This would have affected the rise of other drivers, like Sergio Pérez and Max Verstappen.
Verstappen's rise delayed: With Vettel still at Red Bull, the opportunity for Max Verstappen wouldn't have come so quickly. Max's meteoric rise, with his 2016 victory, would likely have been delayed by several years.
Ferrari and other teams: If Pérez had signed with Ferrari (a real possibility in 2013), the team's lineup would have been very different. Also, Nico Rosberg's retirement after the intense rivalry with Hamilton never would have happened, so Bottas wouldn't have arrived at Mercedes in 2017.


Without Jenson Button we would never have seen the dominance of Hamilton or Max Verstappen, nor Alonso in the Honda era, nor even Vettel at Ferrari, nor the retirement of Rosberg and the signing of Bottas at Mercedes.So obviously events from 2010 to 2025 would never have happened but anyway what do you think? 


","['Lot of assumptions in there. Would Button have retained his seat through the hybrid era? Especially if Vettel or Hamilton came knocking. Could Button have seen off the challenge from Rosberg? Verstappen was originally a Mercedes driver - Wolff had no place for him back when he had Hamilton-Rosberg in the team, but what if it was a Rosberg-Button lineup?\n\nFact is, Button had quite a few hiccups even during his 2009 run to the title. He was never as highly rated in the paddock as the likes of Hamilton, Alonso & Vettel - and the elite drivers will usually have a hotline to the best teams and vice versa.', 'A lot of big driver moves honestly do shake things up.

If and buts of the sport is what makes the sport so great to me.', ""and Michael wouldn't have gone on to that ski trip :("", ""Button would have needed to beat Rosberg during the run up to 2013. Button was a great driver, but Rosberg was elite. I just don't remember if Schumacher wanted to leave or Mercedes simply didn't extend his contract. If it was the latter, then Hamilton would have found his way into Mercedes for 2013 regardless."", 'Yeah well if, if, if. If my mom had balls…', ""If it's that obvious what would've happened, why didn't Button simply stay at McLaren???"", 'You can do that with a lot of big driver moves.', ""If Button wasn't at McLaren then Hamilton would have won a championship according to Button himself. He stated that if McLaren only supported one driver like Red Bull and Ferrari only supported Vettel and Alonso then McLaren would have won at least one championship during that time. He's very much of he mindset that supporting both drivers cost McLaren the chance to win titles."", ""Button beat Lewis 1 out of 3 years and Nico beat Lewis 1 out of 4 years so he has a slight edge, but neither him or Nico beat Vettel in 17/18. So maybe Button is a 3 time champ but then Nico is probably a 2 time champ. But might also be still racing as he doesn't get Abu Dhabi'd and bail.\xa0\n\n\nAnd vettel is now a 5 time as he still leaves RB for Ferrari because the 2014 car was a sack of shit.\xa0\n\n\nAnd Alonso still leaves Ferrari in this scenario as the 2014 car was a sack of shit, but since LH is still at McLaren he doesn't go there, so he goes to RB just as they shit their pants so that's pretty Alonso in of itself.\xa0\n\n\nSo LH is stuck at McLaren for the Honda years and probably retires around 2018 because there's no real options and he don't play back marker very well.\xa0"", ""Button signed with McLaren because he wasn't wanted by Mercedes.

- Right after this screenshot, Max got squeezed and pushed onto the curb which caused him to bottom out, lose all grip and go off

- Max immediately gave back the place to Hamilton in T4/5

- Max broke as early as the Ferraris did. 

- Max did not put himself in a position where “this was always gonna happen”. He had plenty of space when making it 3 wide. Cars have gone 3 wide there practically every race and it worked before. 

- If you still don’t believe me, watch his onboard. 


Max never gained an advantage. If anything he lost a chance to go around the outside of the cars on the inside and gain an actual position. Instead this put him at risk of being overtaken by Russel. ","['I think L1 T1 was fine for Max. He got ahead then gave them back. You could argue that the guidelines say keeping position when going off track will be considered gaining an advantage but given the totality of the circumstances I think this was okay.\n\nCharles though should have given the place to Lewis or been penalised imo.', 'That t1 area needs a gravel trap like Silverstone has at various points.', ""Watch from George's onboard. He broke at the normal braking point. Max did not which increased the gap between the two and meant he was never making the corner, especially with two Ferrari inside. George would absolutely have been in a position to have challenge max going into turn 2 and 3 if Max had attempted to make turn 1. Thats the advantage Max got, and kept. He was able to avoid any attempt of George making an overtake on him whilst he is on a compromised line. Thats an advantage \n\nMax absolutely gained an advantage by not having to take turn 1,2 3."", '3 cars were never going to make it round that corner, \n\n\nIf there was a wall or gravel trap Max would have had to brake earlier and slot behind Leclerc \n\n\nThis would have put him alongside (slightly ahead) of Russell, but Russell would have had the inside line. \n\n\nUltimately Russell would have been competing for T1 with Max (and given the state of the current rules would have been allowed to push him off) \n\n\nThis isn’t a criticism of Max, he know how to work the rules better than any driver, he knows as soon as he goes 3 wide that he is going to take the grass and avoid having to fight with Russell \n\n\nThis isn’t just an issue for Max, only a handful of the front half actually stayed on the track (I.e. good driving) for the first few corners and it didn’t help their positions at all.', ""1. Max was well in control of P4 and in front of Russel for over 400m before going into turn 1.\n2.

Russel wasn't fighting anyone of those 4 in front, only Kimi who almost overtook him going into T1\n4. Russel was slow and almost lost P5 if it wasn't for Kimi going wide.\n\nConclusion: Russel lost P4 fair and square because he couldn't keep up. And not because Max went wide and trough the grass.\n\nIf anyone should be penalised here, it should be Leclerc. He cut 2 corners, and had no reason to go over the grass because he was well in control of his car and couldve gone back on track but chose to grass instead. He only gave back the position to Norris, but Lewis was in front of him as well after T1 before he cut the corner."", 'If there\'d been a brick wall instead of tarmac, Verstappen would have needed to slow down far earlier and to a greater extent. The tarmac allowed Verstappen to gain an advantage by keeping the place.\n\nThen there is the second half of the turn 4 incident that wasn\'t picked up by the stewards. Verstappen squeezed Hamilton, pushing Hamilton wide causing him to lose all grip and go off (which in your book would mean everything Hamilton did afterwards completely fine). Subsequently Verstappen himself goes wide, comes back on track pushing Russell off the track allowing Verstappen to retain his place (again) even though it did allow Bearman to pass the pair of them.\n\nThe idea that Verstappen didn\'t gain a lasting advantage from both these incidents is for the birds.\n\nAlso ""love"" the use of the familiar \'Max\' versus the repeated misspelling of \'Russel\'.', 'The only reason he can take this line is, because he knew that he will not be punished for it. \n\nJust, for a moment, imagine there is a big, fat and deep gravel trap where the grass is right now. I bet that he will not overtake Russell in that world, because the cant risk not making the corner. \n\nAnd in the end that is the problem with all of this. Not that the didnt get a penalty or that he didnt give back a place to Russell (which i fully agree he wouldnt had to do), but that you can take a line that will most likely result in you not making the corner without being punished for it.', 'Max was entitled to go for the move, and it wasn’t some Hail Mary given he’s executed a very similar move before.\n\nHamilton was entitled to try to make a move past Norris, and Leclerc had no choice but to respond to that to avoid a collision.\n\nMax overshot the corner because of Leclerc squeezing him onto the kerb.\n\nGeorge was entitled to feel aggrieved that Max had gained an advantage.\n\nI think the most you can argue is that Verstappen should have anticipated Lewis and Charles moving over to go 3-wide, but Max committed to the move before Lewis had moved out from behind Lando.\n\nI don’t think it’s correct to say Max committed to that with the intention of going off-track if it didn’t work. He very nearly hit the barrier, and re-entering the track at that stage of a race is always extremely risky.', 'Max was also driving on a line that in no way could have ever made the corner even if there was no cars on the track.  He wasn’t aiming for the corner at all.', 'The more egregious one is his battle vs Lewis a few laps later. First he divebombs and makes contact in T1, next he keeps the position going way off track through T3, and then finally competes with Lewis into the next corner, forcing him off to where he gets the penalty when he should be letting him back through before the braking zone']",0,174,0.49,0,165,165,0,3,0.0,0

1ohbs3l,My train of thought after rewatching lap 6,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohbs3l/my_train_of_thought_after_rewatching_lap_6/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"- Lap 6 T1: Max tries to make a move on Lewis, it's hard racing, but it's a fair move. Lewis manages to keep alongside, they will take the battle to T2
- Lap 6 T2: Max, yet to complete the move on Lewis, goes wide and completes the move off track, cutting T3 in the process. Lewis stays within the track and lines up a move for T4.
- Lap 6 T4: Lewis tries to make the move around the outside on Max, goes off and completes the move off track. He then rejoins and doesn't give back the position.

Logical outcome in my opinion: both drivers get a 10 second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage.

Actual outcome: only Lewis gets a penalty...

Am I missing something or is this just bad stewarding?","['https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/Yn4g0c4q4B', ""Read the decision documents.\n\nThey say that, under the current rules, since Max is clearly (their word) ahead at the apex (i.e. having their front axle ahead of the other car's mirrors while overtaking on the inside), then Lewis should have yielded the corner.

Under the rules, it was completed. \n\nSo at the next corner, Lewis is attempting an overtake and pushes Max off track. Had Max not rejoined ahead, then it would have been a penalty for Lewis.

1ohapgy,F1 stewarding. Why is Max Verstappen assessed differently to other drivers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ohapgy/f1_stewarding_why_is_max_verstappen_assessed/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"Before I start, I want to preface this by saying I am not a Max hater, I think he is one of the best drivers to ever grace the sport, however, it amazes me how much he gets away with on track compared to other drivers, yesterday's race being a prime example.

Let's take each incident from yesterday's race. 

1. Lap one. Max makes a great start and is forced wide into turn one. Knowing that if he brakes at the appropriate point to make the corner he is most likely going to come out in p5, given the shape of the corner, he overshoots the corner and runs across the grass. Before people say he gave the places back, I would argue they weren't his places to begin with, as he was in overspeed whilst everyone else was braking so of course he was alongside at the apex. If there was a wall there he would be forced to tuck in and not have a risk free pass. I can't believe there wasnt a penalty for this. For the record I think Leclerc should have had one as well, Lewis seemed to get passed him and instead of staying on track he just cut the corner and took the place. 

2. The incident with Lewis. This one is perhaps even more egregious. He comes from a long way back and makes a lunge on Lewis. Lewis is banged into and is forced off track. Max then, on the outside for the next corner with Lewis on the inside, just cuts the grass and takes the place from Lewis. I can't believe this was not a penalty, it was a slam dunk penalty for forcing a driver off track and gaining an advantage. Cut and dry. Then Lewis gets a 10 SECOND Penalty for locking up at turn 4 and not giving the place back, which I think was incredibly harsh but it is what it is.

3. The VSC. This is an interesting one as I've seen alot of people saying the FIA screwed Max with the VSC, however before that during double yellows, Verstappen gained about 5tenths in the last sector by not lifting compared to Charles, which is the reason he was so close coming out of the last corner when the VSC was thrown. If it hadn't have been thrown and Verstappen would of got the move done, it would have been interesting to see what the stewards would've done.

I think this points to a wider conversation about f1 stewarding, and it's integrity. It feels to be like for some drivers they have incredibly harsh penalties but for others they can drive incredibly recklessly and no punishment is afforded. There is no consistency at all and it baffles me that these stewards are watching the same race as everyone else.

Anyway happy redditing and welcome opposing viewpoints and discussion :)","[""As for point number one, he did brake at the usual point, however he was forced off the track and onto the bumpy curb where he started bottoming out, at which point you cannot slow down at the normal rate.\n\n\nThe second incident was a messy bit of driving all around, however Chandok's Sky analysis said the stewards got it right.TLDR he was ahead at the apex of turn two and kept it on the track, he was ahead at the apex of turn 3 and Hamilton pushed him wide, thus he didin't need to give the place back, and Hamilton gained a substantial advantage with his off road driving which is why he got a penalty. As for my opinion, the whole sequence was on the edge of the rulebook and if he did get a penalty it wouldn't surprise me, same as it wasn't a massive surprise he didn't get one.\n\n\nAs for the yellow flag incident, the precedent was set in I think Miami, that even a slight lift is enough, so it could be the case that Leclerc lifted more than what was necessary but none of us can judge without the telemetry and I believe other teams would have brought it up if the brach was substantial.\n\n\nLastly, I find it funny that the most punished driver of the last 18 months is thought of having preferential treatment. Stewards rotate every race and while the consistency is lacking because of it, it also ensures no individual bias. And the only confirmed biased steward, who was later removed (Johnny Herbert) was, interestingly, anti-Max."", 'this is going to be a loooong break of useless repeated posts', 'the drivers agreed to these rules. he was not assessed differently.', '1. Stewards are typically lenient on lap one incidents and ultimately he left the track in P4 and rejoined in P4 so he didn’t gain anything \n\n2. Per the driving rules, Max had his mirror ahead at the apex and so long as he had control of his car and didn’t go off track he’s free to push Lewis wide. As for the following corner it’s just the nature of the circuit and the line Lewis was now on, Max couldn’t have stayed on track whilst avoiding contact. Then at the next corner where lewis locked up, the stewards found he gained and lasting advantage and didn’t give the position back hence the 10 second penalty\n\n3. Delta isn’t a good measurement for this kind of incident, you need to look at the telemetry to see if he lifted significantly. For example Charles might’ve lifted more than he needed to, which caused the delta to close up. That being said I haven’t personally seen the telemetry and there wasn’t an official investigation which was a bit surprising but I imagine that might’ve been different had he got past', 'It is cut and dry that he did not force Lewis off at T1 and then avoided him by cutting the next corner. Hamilton then left the track and gained a lasting advantage by doing an overtake like that. Hamilton is simply in the wrong according to the applicable guidelines, whatever your opinion about those might be.\n\nVSC was related to potential fire being reported and the following marshal intervention. Nothing to do with on-track battles. And no indication that someone didnt lift enough.\n\nWhen a T1 goes like yesterday its difficult for the FIA to assess exactly who is and is not in the right, and they tend to let things go especially on lap 1 and with multiple drivers involved. Again, think about it what you want, but i dont think Verstappen got any special treatment there.', ""because he knows the rulebook better than the stewards and is always pushing it to the limit, he's by far the hardest driver to steward"", '> Lap one. (...)  I can\'t believe there wasnt a penalty for this.\n\nHe was well ahead of Russell long before the corner, before he event went to the outside to attempt to overtake the Ferraris. Arguing that he wasn\'t is just disingenuous. \n\n> Before people say he gave the places back, I would argue they weren\'t his places to begin with, as he was in overspeed whilst everyone else was braking so of course he was alongside at the apex.\n\nWhat are you even talking about here? Yes, they weren\'t his places to begin with, which is exactly why he needed to give them back, which he did. Do you think the rules say you only need to give a place back if you *didn\'t* gain it off track? Your whole argument here makes no sense at all.\n\n> The incident with Lewis. This one is perhaps even more egregious. He comes from a long way back and makes a lunge on Lewis. Lewis is banged into and is forced off track.\n\nMax came from a long way back, but was ahead at the apex, in full control of his car, and able to make the corner on his own. Therefore he was entitled to space and it was Lewis to needed to make sure there was no contact. Lewis failed to do this, and the stewards actually investigated him for it (as they should), but they basically deemed the contact too insignificant to penalize, considering neither car got damaged.\n\nPhrasing a contact Lewis initiated as ""Lewis got banged into"" just shows how incredibly biased and dishonest you are being in your entire argument.\n\n> Max then, on the outside for the next corner with Lewis on the inside, just cuts the grass and takes the place from Lewis.\n\nAgain, complete nonsense. Max was ahead of Lewis at this point, and the only reason Lewis was still sort of alongside was because he went off track at the exit of turn 1. Max is obviously entitled to space at this point, but Lewis leaves him none, forcing Max off. At that point Max has no choice but to cut the corner.\n\nHe then rejoined the track ahead of Lewis, gaining the place, and immediately lost it again when Lewis cut the next corner and gained a few seconds from that.\n\nI\'d argue that if Max had stayed ahead, he clearly would not have had to give the place back. But that\'s not even relevant since he didn\'t.\n\n> I can\'t believe this was not a penalty\n\nFor what? Leaving the track and *not* gaining and advantage? People keep demanding a penalty for this incident, and I really wonder how they think the rules work.\n\nEven ignoring the fact that Max was clearly entitled to that space and so wouldn\'t have had to give the place back if he had stayed ahead, the fact is that he didn\'t. You can\'t get a penalty for gaining an advantage if you did not gain an advantage. How is that not obvious?\n\n>  it was a slam dunk penalty for forcing a driver off track and gaining an advantage. \n\nThe driver being forced off was Max Verstappen. Are you saying he should get a penalty for forcing himself off?', 'Do you guys watch races with eyes closed?', ""Did you watch the race last year? Then, both situations went against him and he got 2x 10 second penalty. And that was based on the rules of F1.\n\nBased on the rules of F1, Verstappen didn't deserve a penalty for either situation this year. Don't hate the player, hate the game. 19 drivers agreed to the rules of wheel-to-wheel racing."", '1 day later and the narrative still hasnt changed?\nu can argue that the rules are bad but the application was correct yesterday, only leclerc shouldve given a place back on lap 1']",0,139,0.34,0,115,115,0,2,0.0,0
