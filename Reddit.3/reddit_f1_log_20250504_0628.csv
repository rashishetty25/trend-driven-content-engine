The best racing I've had in many years of simracing, is when both parties give each other space in situations like Liam and Fernando in the sprint race today and many others recently.

I understand that this rule is one of very few possible ways of consistently stewarding and I also understand there is a difference in competitiveness between casual simracing and the pinnacle of motorsport , but I'd honestly rather have the inconsistencies from a few years ago back in exchange for giving the outside car more rights. **Ahead-at-the-apex should not give you 100% control of the corner**.","['I have a great idea\n\nTell the stewards that your allowed to tell drivers to give positions back', 'Both drivers should give room.

“ However, following the Sprint it was confirmed that Albon, Lawson and Bearman had all dropped out of the points, with the Thai racer handed a five-second time penalty for not staying above the minimum time behind the Safety Car while Lawson received the same punishment for causing a collision with Alonso.

Bearman was also hit with a five-second penalty for an unsafe release from the pits, with these changes promoting Russell to fourth and Stroll to fifth while Yuki Tsunoda, Antonelli and Pierre Gasly moved up into sixth, seventh and eighth respectively.”

They looked pretty low to the ground.', ""Although it's just a sprint pole, Mercedes look proper fast this weekend so he could very well get pole too"", 'Translation:\n\n\n> **It\'s only Andrea Kimi Antonelli\'s sixth GP weekend, and yet the prodigy placed his Mercedes on the ""small"" pole position. Despite not knowing the track, he had the confidence to take more risks than usual.**\n\n> The second sprint qualifying session of the year ended with a massive sensation. A Mercedes is at the front. No, it\'s not George Russell. Andrea Kimi Antonelli surprised friend and foe with pole position for the sprint. The 18-year-old Italian is driving in Miami for just his sixth Grand Prix.\n\n> Antonelli only knew the 5.412-kilometer Miami Autodrome from the virtual world. ""I did 70 laps in the simulator during preparation,"" said the hairy-haired driver from Bologna, who now lives in San Marino. The start to his first Formula 1 season was promising. After five Grands Prix, Antonelli is in sixth place with 38 points. You couldn\'t expect more from a rookie.\n\n> The team had prepared its rookie well for the big adventure. ""The speed was always there, whether in karting or the junior series. We told him to take it easy this season, gain some mileage and experience. Kimi stuck to that and managed the risk well,"" praised team principal Toto Wolff in retrospect.\n\n> **Antonelli deliberately waits until the end.**\nBut with steadily improving results, his confidence grew, too. This paid off in Miami. Antonelli immediately fell in love with the track. The fact that he had never driven on it before dampened his expectations. And he now dared to take more risks.\n> In both SQ1 and SQ2, the prodigy qualified in the top five with exhilarating ease. This gave him the confidence to wait for a final attempt in the top ten. His much more experienced teammate, George Russell, insisted on going out on track right at the beginning, thus guaranteeing a clear path.\n\n> Russell underestimated that the track would accelerate again within five minutes. Mercedes also decided not to give Russell\'s Mercedes four laps of fuel, allowing them two attempts with two cool-down laps in between, like Max Verstappen. ""We thought the tires would only provide optimal grip on the first lap,"" apologized chief engineer Andrew Shovlin.\n\n> **Tire temperatures in the green zone.**\nWrong thought. Verstappen improved again on his second attempt. It wasn\'t enough for Antonelli. The Mercedes driver was two and a half tenths faster. Red Bull blamed it on the new engines that all Mercedes teams received in Miami. ""Max lost four tenths on the straights. He had an old engine,"" lamented motorsport director Helmut Marko.\n\n> Antonelli himself was surprised that he ended up at the top of the rankings. ""It felt like a good round. I could have maybe done a little better in a few areas. But I\'m happy that I was on the music in all three sectors.""\n\n> Wolff believes Antonelli can maintain the lead if he gets off to a good start. Even though Verstappen, Norris, and Piastri had better long runs in the first practice session, if Antonelli takes the lead, everyone behind him will have to swallow the turbulent air.\n\n> The tire drama from Jeddah will not be repeated. Mercedes deliberately sent Russell and Antonelli on longer runs of 16 and 13 laps in free practice to ensure tire temperatures didn\'t skyrocket again. The result was positive.', ""Ok it's a sprint pole guys let's not get too carried away"", 'I really hope he does well, the italian anthem is too beautiful to not be a regular haha', '""Miracle""?? 😭', ""Mercedes was predicted to be fast here. Mercedes was fast here. George was on a stupid strategy in SQ3 that no one else was on for good reason. I can't imagine anyone in F1 thinking it was a good idea to do one lap at the beginning and then come in and sit in the pits.\n\nAlso, Kimi is very talented, and also the best prepared rookie in decades. Mercedes had him do more than 30GPs worth of testing of previous cars. They are probably why there is now a limit of the testing of previous cars now."", ""Let's get some perspective here: Its easy to be a child prodigy when your from an extremely wealthy and powerful family as Kimi Antonelli is. Powerful in the sense that Kimi's father owns multiple motorsports teams(some successful) and he has connections all over the F1/wider motorsports world. So Kimi already had one foot in the door from a very young age via his influential father.\n\n\nI mean there could be a poor working class lad whose even more talented and faster than Kimi(I guarantee there is), but you'll never see him in F1. Without money and the connections F1 is basically impossible to get into as a driver."", 'And so, the battle for being Verstappen’s new teammate begins']",16,29,0.59,16,248,248,1,0,0.0,1
