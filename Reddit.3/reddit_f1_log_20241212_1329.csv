HRC President Koji Watanabe and HRC Executive Advisor Takuma Sato spoke with high expectations about Tsunoda, as well as Ayumu Iwasa, who also took part in the test.\n\n**‚ö´Ô∏é HRC President Koji Watanabe: ""We were able to realize his request to participate in the test. I have heard that he is very satisfied.""**\n\n  \n""I returned to Japan from Abu Dhabi yesterday afternoon (Tuesday, December 10th), and on Saturday I had various discussions with (Red Bull F1 Team Principal) Christian Horner about the drivers for next season and beyond. As I always say, the team has the right to decide on the driver, so our opinion is merely for reference, but from the HRC side, we believe that Tsunoda has the ability to be promoted to Red Bull and should be one of the candidates. I think that what we can do is to provide an opportunity for him to show his abilities to the world, so I asked him to participate in this test, and yesterday we were able to make it happen.""\n\n""I only met (Tsunoda) before the test, and he said, \'I want to achieve good results. I\'m going to enjoy myself.\' He said these two things, and since then, all I have is the report from the site by HRC, but he has very clearly analysed the differences between the RB car and the Red Bull car, and has given the team very useful advice and comments on that basis. I have confirmed from the report that Tsunoda himself is very satisfied.""\n\n""After that, I don\'t know what will happen, so we\'ll have to wait and see the results, but if it goes well, that\'ll be great. In any case, (even if he can\'t drive for Red Bull), he\'s already been booked to drive for RB next season, so I expect him to perform well next season no matter which team he drives for.""\n\n**‚ö´Ô∏éTakuma Sato HRC Executive Advisor ""All we can do now is pray.""**\n\n  \n""From what I\'ve seen, of course, with regards to Yuki, he showed amazing speed from Q1 (second place) at the Bahrain GP (2021) when he made his F1 debut, and I think his growth as a driver has been steadily increasing over the past four years. I met him at Imola (test held in August) for the first time in a while, and he seemed very relaxed, so I thought he\'s become a really good driver. Including race management and race craft, Yuki now has speed, and I think he has grown a lot with age and experience, including his own self-control to manage well.""\n\n""So, as I just said, we are hoping that he will drive for Red Bull, but I think it\'s up to the team. Yuki spoke to the media yesterday, saying that his driving style and the Red Bull car, with its sharp front end, suit him well, so I think he must have had a very good test. Now, all we can do is pray.""\n\n""Naturally, I went (to the Imola test) not only to support Yuki, but also to support Ayumu, and about half of the RB staff there, formerly Toro Rosso, who I tested with in 2008, were still there. So there were a lot of familiar faces.""\n\n""As we talked, it turned out that the engineers on-site really valued Ayumu\'s extremely sensitive abilities, and the feedback they were giving him in the simulator was extremely appropriate. During the actual test at Imola, (Liam) Lawson wanted to show his speed so he was pushing hard, and in a sense he was overdriving, but Ayumu was driving with great control, so the feedback from the engineers on-site was at a higher level for Ayumu.""\n\n""Looking at it like that, both Yuki and Ayumu are becoming really good drivers, so I really want them to get into F1 in a good way. As a driver, I have high expectations of both of them, so that\'s how I see it.""Takuma Sato\'s advisor, Koji Watanabe, CEO, comments on Yuki Tsunoda\'s test at Red Bull and 2025: ""All we can do now is pray""', 'its insane they are considering anyone but yuki', 'they must really not want Yuki in the red bull if the Higher ups of have to have talks personally with Horner to somehow convince him', 'One of us!

Brought class and professionalism to the team that it desperately needed, and largely due to his driving Haas is in a much stronger position than it was when he got there.

Haas was 10th, 8th, and then in his first year, 10th, and calling their driver's lineup ""slapdash"" before Nico arrived would have been a compliment.

I don't know what role Nico had in helping to develop the improved Haas car this year, but I'm sure it was an important one, with his experience and professionalism allowing him to give very detailed feedback that helped the team figure out which way to move, which is probably the single biggest thing Haas lacked before he got there.  And then he drove that car to a very solid result considering what Haas has to work with.

Nico being a consummate professional salvaged the team's reputation, and I'm convinced his driving and ability to elevate his car helped Toyota to decide to take the plunge and invest in the team giving Haas access to greater resources than they could have achieved anytime soon on their own.  Certainly that was much less likely to happen when the Haas driver lineup was awash in mediocricy.  Now they sit at P7 with Nico having earned the lion's share of the points.  They're poised to make an assault on the midpack and Nico played a role in getting them there.

Haas is, in a word, a team with credibility now, which sure as heck wasn't the case when Nico first got there.

No knock on Kevin intended, but this was Nico's team for the last 2 years and he got it done.  I hope he does well at Sauber.  He earned his pay and owes Haas nothing.","["">Nico being a consummate professional salvaged the team's reputation, and I'm convinced his driving and ability to elevate his car helped Toyota to decide to take the plunge and invest in the team.\n\nI think it was the Silverstone weekend where we first saw some key Toyota people in the Haas garage. That was of course the weekend where Nico finished in P6 for the second race in a row. It was said that they were just some of Ayao's friends..."", '> No knock on Kevin\n\nHonestly, Kevin made things exciting and mostly in a good way.  The way he kept sacrificing his race to make sure Nico got points, in other races the fact that he wouldn\'t give up the fight even when it seemed obvious that there would be no positive outcome, his wheel to wheel battles. \n\nAs for Nico, I\'m happy about how things played out and I\'m always happy when ""one of the good ones"" finds success. He seems like an honestly good guy.', 'It annoyed me intensely when people were slagging off Haas and suggesting they be kicked because Andretti wasn‚Äôt getting in. These things take time and they‚Äôve been in a difficult spot. Give them half a chance and they‚Äôll go for it. The narrative that the team existed solely to advertise CNC and they didn‚Äôt care where they placed was obnoxious.', 'Haas is the highlight of this 2024 season for me, what a phenomenal comeback. I started the season thinking ‚ÄúOh boy, it couldn‚Äôt get any worse than Haas‚Äù (I was a Sauber fan). I was dead wrong. First half of the season, Haas were gatekeeping the top 10 from the Sauber drivers and for the later half of the season, Haas did get in the top 10 for God knows how many times (I lost count). Too bad that Nico and Kmag left after this season, I definitely can see them being the heroes (along with Ayao) who lead the team to the top of the midfield.', ""I'm always surprised when people are fans of teams and not drivers (except when it's Ferrari because they're almost an Italian national team). Pleasantly surprised though."", ""It's always difficult to judge just what caused a team to improve, there could be a bunch of factors with drivers, engineers, Komatsu taking over as team principal, changes to technical strategy and processes at the factory, etc.\n\nBut one of the biggest things that was noticeable about Haas in the years before Hulk joined was that they just couldn't fix their issues or be consistent from race to race. They had long running issues with tyres, so even if the car's aero etc may have been good, they destroyed tyres and couldn't find a good balance in the car. This issue seemed to keep up for multiple seasons with them just not being able to get to the bottom of how to solve it.\n\nSo it does somewhat fit with the idea that bringing in a strong development driver like Nico may have been a massive help to them. He's had plenty of experience at different teams, even in the years when he wasn't racing he was still a development driver with Aston. So there is a good chance that he was helpful in working through the issues that they were having with balance and tyre wear, and helping them solve those issues.\n\nBeing an experienced professional driver certainly helped too. It gave them a reliable benchmark to measure against - KMag is a great driver too but not always the most consistent, and rookies like Mick always make it harder to tell what's going on with the car and improve things, when you're not sure how fast they should be. Hulk is arguably the best driver Haas have ever had.\n\nHopefully he can go on to do good things at Sauber and help them improve too."", 'Top professional. Was instrumental at Renault in 2017 as well maximising the performance on track and providing very important feedback for continuous improvement just like he did at Haas.', 'Honestly felt like Haas was the perfect home for him. Will be a shame to see him in Sauber imo', 'Nico Hulkenberg is probably the biggest good surprise in F1 from the last two years that no one had seen coming.\n\nThe immense critique on Haas for selecting Hulkenberg starting 2023 was almost getting ridiculous. Every ""expert commentator"" and his mother blamed Haas for being overly conservative and not getting ""a more exciting driver"" in that seat. In their eyes, Hulkenberg in a main F1 seat was for sure a ship that had sailed away a long time ago. If it was up to them, he had his chance in F1 and now it was time to move on.\n\nAnd oh boy, did he prove them all wrong. From day one he was the faster driver in the team. And mind you, Kevin is no slouch who decisively beat F2 winner Mick Schumacher in his comeback year and before that had been in the Haas team for many years. Through out the two seasons Nico managed to qualify that Haas in Q3 positions it absolutely had no business being there. Starting this year, the Haas finally became competitive in long runs as well and he has made great use of it, scoring the vast majority of the points for Haas.\n\nThis guy will get his podium, it must be.']",653,70,0.95,653,803,803,8,1,0.0,8

1hbx78u,2024 World Constructors' Championship Alternative Standings,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hbx78u/2024_world_constructors_championship_alternative/,2024-12-11, Statistics,"  
From 1958 until 1978, the International Cup for F1 Constructors (as it was called at the time), only counted the points from the highest-scoring driver in each race for each constructor towards the Championship.

Using the same logic for the 2024 season, these are the standings (if I calculated them correctly, pardon any mistakes). The first table's results are the standings without counting sprints, as they didn't exist back in the day, or fastest laps, which not always awarded points:

https://preview.redd.it/9gv9sk3wu86e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d10da17ef4103eaa33d5f03a37a451da19b7d87e

The only major difference in the standings for this scenario is that Red Bull would finish ahead of Ferrari with McLaren only clinching the title on the finale in Abu Dhabi.

A funny tidbit, but Red Bull's points would actually be just Verstappen's points (no fastest lap points) + 10 (Checo's points in Australia, as Max DNFed and P√©rez never finished ahead of him any other time).

This method almost punishes you for both drivers doing well, as Alpine's double podium in S√£o Paulo wouldn't even ""help"" them as much, because only Ocon's 2nd place would count, and many other scenarios like these for the midfield and backmarker teams, as double points finishes wouldn't pay off as much as only 1 car finishing higher.

  
In the second table I've added sprint points using the same logic that only the highest scoring driver from each team counts:

https://preview.redd.it/e2s21au3v86e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=930922410ac5aef16b132f84a4cf70333b0c705d

The only difference in position here from the previous table above is that Haas jumps Alpine for 6th as they scored more points in sprints (again, Alpine's double podium has less relevancy in this scenario).

Something which I hadn't noticed before doing this, but besides Williams and Sauber (which I guess is understandable), I found that Aston Martin also didn't score a single point in a sprint.

With Verstappen's 4th WDC, there's been a lot of conversations online about how important/rare that number of (+ run of consecutive) championships are and discourse about whether or not Verstappen should be added to the list of ""GOATs"" yet. I generally think the GOAT discourse is nonsense, but it made me curious this time because: Why is Vettel not generally included when people talk about the greatest drivers?

To the best of my understanding, his stats are pretty good (like, consecutive championships are rare, he held the consecutive win record before Verstappen, 4 titles is *very* rare). Is there some context I'm missing? Is it just nostalgia bias where people are reluctant to induct a ""new"" guy into the ""good old days"" club? Are his titles less impressive than other champions' titles for some reason?

Thanks! Always looking to learn more about F1 :)","[""Getting matched by Ricciardo in 14 and then beaten by Leclerc in 19-20 really did a number on Vettel's legacy.

Add to that the perception of being a one trick pony (i.e. master of Newey's blown diffuser design) and you get the picture."", 'I saw Vettel race in 2004 in Formel BMW and he was already a class of his own there. In 2008 he jumped into the limelight with his superb win in Monza and he build from there. Now specifically in 2011 and 2013 there wasn‚Äôt much competition (like Max had last year), with Vettel in the best car and his teammate just not at his level. His 2010 and 2012 titles were fantastic. His ‚ÄòGOAT status‚Äô however got a hit in the seasons after, a bit like Lewis the last couple of years. In all, a fantastic driver, and he matured into a very likable guy the last years.', ""It didn't help that when he was at his most successful, he was also at his least likeable."", ""Vettel's not seen as a GOAT tier driver because he wasn't great when Ferrari had the car to challenge Mercedes in the hybrid era and then at Aston he was a shadow of his former self.\n\nHe was good in the V8 era with a good car, but he didn't show enough long term. He's like Ricciardo where he was fast when it suited him and then faded when it didn't. Drivers like Senna and Verstappen were always fast and that's why they're GOAT tier drivers."", 'As a newer fan (2017) who has done a ‚Äúfair‚Äù bit of research. Vettel seems like an A+ tier driver with S tier stats. \n\nSome forget that F1 is more than talent alone, but timing as well.', 'Fernando almost took 2 championships away from him in a much worse car, was beaten by Ricciardo in 2014, never really challenged Lewis in Ferrari (the way Max or Fernando did), was beaten by Leclerc, etc. He is a top historic driver, however Fernando, Max, and Lewis are just better (mentioning them cause they were the 3 best drivers‚Äúcontemporaries to Vettel‚Äù)', 'He was simply much more error prone than Max. He was a fantastic driver otherwise but if you‚Äôre comparing him to the GOATs it‚Äôs a pretty fatal flaw. I would recommend an F1TV subscription where you can watch the entirety of Seb‚Äôs career in full. \n\nYou‚Äôll see critical errors like how he took himself out in Turkey 2010 trying to pass his team-mate, throwing away an easy victory in Hungary by flouting the safety car rules and his absolute mare at Spa. \n\n2017 it was a big ask to win the championship but he let Lewis off the hook massively with his start line move in Singapore, a track where Mercedes were known to be weak. He had a great year otherwise but that was a basic, unforgivable error that wiped out any title hopes he had in an instant.\n\nIn 2018 his crash in Germany was huge and it felt like he unravelled mentally after that with the pressure Lewis put on him. Ferrari made huge gains with the PU from Spa onwards but he made an error at Monza understeering into the side of Lewis on the first lap, with Lewis going onto beat Kimi to the win. Lewis then had arguably the weekend of his life in Singapore and the mistakes kept flowing from Seb through 2019, which is arguably the main reason Leclerc beat him that year.\n\nSome people will point to Danny Ric beating him in 2014 as a reason why Seb isn‚Äôt one of the best but I think that was simply a down year for Seb. In his championship years he had this hyper aggressive counter intuitive driving style that the blown diffusers really helped him hone. When the 2014 reg changes took that away, he needed the time to adapt. He went on to (at times at least) thump Raikkonen almost as convincingly as Alonso had done and that tells me Seb had all the ability in the world, I just don‚Äôt see at all that Ricciardo was fundamentally better. It‚Äôs a shame we never got to see a rematch to prove this theory.', 'Lack of longevity I would say', 'hey, for me, hes one of those drivers thats really hard to rate. it often feels like hes a point of debate because hes almost between two groups, just below the so called GOAT‚Äôs, and above the so called number two drivers who are amazing on their day but lack consistency . On one hand, at his best, was was absolutely clinical, with unbelievable pace, race intelligence and consistency. \n\nOn the other, he was a victim of being in the best car, found himself in title battles that he probably shouldve wrapped up quicker, and had a few off seasons/ showed cracks in moments of pressure in certain seasons. He operated at such a high level during his title years and early ferrari career, but from then on his weaknesses became more apparent. Ultimately, the GOAT‚Äôs dont have off seasons, they perfom at least at a 9/10 almost every season. Vettel had too many seasons less than that to be rated so highly. Also, in his championship years he found himself in a car the suited him a lot, and only faced a challenge from one teammate. When the car changed and he went up against ricciardo, the drop off was just far too extreme.', ""There was a time when Vettel and Hamilton were about equal, success-wise, and Seb kinda flatlined from that point, while Lewis pulled away, amassing many more great wins & three more championships. \n\nI'm sorry to say that Vettel got a touch of the checos towards the end, which damaged his reputation somewhat. \n\nI don't really get the thing about 'consecutive championships'.

Unlike in sports like football or basketball, which are very easily accessible without having sponsors or rich parents, you can assume that we actually see a large proportion of the best and most talented people on the planet in this sport (of course there is still room for improvement, e.g. in China or India the potential is not even realised in these sports). The fact that very untalented people like Stroll, Mazepin and Taki Inoue were or still are able to compete in this class is unthinkable in the NBA, for example (Yes, there is currently a big exception with the Lakers, but apart from that there was no such thing). One of the reasons for this is that the teams drive cars of different strengths, so you often can't tell from the outside how good the driver really is.

It has definitely improved, I think the talent pool was way smaller 50 years ago than it is today, but even in 50 years nothing will change much, it is what it is.
