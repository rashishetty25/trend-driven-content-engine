Exactly the same way he learned from Lauda, Senna learned from him, although you could say Senna retained more of his distinctive driving traits. Hard to say about his mindset, but as I remember he was starting to mellow out and be more accepting of non-victories. Of course, he died at the start of his 11th season in F1, we will never know.
