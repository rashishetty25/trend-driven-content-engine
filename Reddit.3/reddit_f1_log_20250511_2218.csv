1kjn12p,Did F1’s Fastest Lap Point Rule Really Affect Strategy? Here's What I Found,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kjn12p/did_f1s_fastest_lap_point_rule_really_affect/,2025-05-10, Discussion,"So, F1 recently got rid of the fastest lap point, claiming it was all about strategy, not pure pace. They said drivers outside the top 10 were ""stealing"" the point, with some even affecting the championship. But is that really true? I decided to dive into the stats and find out if the rule actually made a difference.  
For context, the fastest lap point was introduced in the 2019 season till the 2024 season. When I say before 2019, I mean from 2011 to 2018.  
  
Here's what I found -  

**Before 2019**: The fastest laps were mostly set in the middle of the race. Only about **3% of races** (6 races) saw a driver in the top 10 pit late and grab the fastest lap. The **average laps remaining** when the fastest lap was set? **17.22**.

**After 2019**: Things changed. Fastest laps were set much closer to the end of the race, and it wasn’t just about pace anymore. **23% of races** (27 races) saw top 10 drivers pit late for that point. The **mean laps remaining** when the fastest lap was set dropped to **5.94**.

Here's a slide showing all the instances of drivers outside the top 10 pitting towards the end and setting the fastest lap - 

[Comparison of instances where drivers outside the top 10 secured the fastest lap, before and after the introduction of the fastest lap point in 2019.](https://preview.redd.it/o83j28mtd10f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e83b3163b3addc51b4f3ee9a2fb91ae52061d57e)

  
So, what else did F1 management expect? In close championship battles, teams would always take every advantage they could, whether that meant pitting late for the fastest lap or making strategic moves to “steal” the point. It was clear that the rule wasn’t just about pure pace, and in many cases, it became a tactical tool for those outside the top 10.

F1 scrapping the rule makes sense, but only time will tell if, from this year onward, teams return to the pre-2019 pattern where the fastest lap becomes more of an honorary achievement rather than a strategic goal.

What do you think? Did this rule give too much power to drivers outside the top 10?","[""The problem wasn't drivers outside the top 10, it was that getting fastest lap was more to do with how fast the driver behind you was (and therefore how close). It generally just boiled down to which driver in the top 10 had a pit stop gap behind them in the last 5 laps."", ""What I really like about Zhou's fastest lap at Bahrain 2023 is that it was done to take the point away from Gasly, which means that Sauber thought that they would be competing with Alpine for positions in the WCC. By the end of the year, Alpine had beaten them by 120 to 16..."", 'For chaos: a point for the fastest lap every lap.', ""The straw that broke it was a sister team tactically 'stealing' a point from a driver who was in direct competition with the parent team, wasn't it?\n\n  \nWithout that one Ricciardo fastest lap, I doubt they'd even have changed the rule."", ""Still think they should've switched to a pole position bonus point for GPs. It would serve as effectively the same thing but without the gimmick of some teams stopping for tires to steal it when others don't."", 'One point I would like is extra point for pole', 'Only race it genuinely affected the result, in my opinion, was Silverstone (70th anniversary?) race.

Did this rule give too much power to drivers outside the top 10?\n\n\nI don\'t know about too much power...\n\n\nIt certainly gave teams the ability to tank one drivers race to influence it... Which is a little silly out than straight swap the cars and I feel is bad.\n\n\nIt gave the appearance of red bull exerting undue influence to get Toro Rosso to steal a point. Which is bad. We\'ve all seen allegations suggestions about how RB tells TR to let their drivers through easier etc.\xa0\n\n\nIt\'s also a ridiculous thing when the only driver that goes for FL is P5 with a 30 second gap. It often felt like FL points were a matter of circumstances and not a genuine ""wow he tried hard and got it"". Which I\'d use for a good argument at removing it.\xa0', ""Fastest lap point was pointless to measure real pace order.\xa0As you noted, in quite a few cases it just resulted in a late pitstop for a semi-quali lap. The way it is now still doesn't reflect genuine pure pace given it's all about who has the better tyre management, but at least it gives other insides into it, rather than just showing driver X pitted onto the soft tyres near the end.""]",1660,306,0.96,1660,7283,7283,15,3,0.0,15

1kk8pzy,[AMUS] Is this the explanation for the McLaren mystery?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kk8pzy/amus_is_this_the_explanation_for_the_mclaren/,2025-05-11, News,,"['For those not quite completing how a material can have a “stop sign” at a specific temperature, here’s an example:\n\nYou can’t heat water hotter than 100°C (at atmospheric pressure), because the moment it hits 100°C it turns to water vapor via boiling. \n\nMcLaren may be using a solid that melts at a target temp to do the same thing. The solid inside the brake drum liner stops the tire receiving excess heat from the rim because it’s made of/coated in whatever material they’ve designed to melt instead of heating up beyond the target level. \n\nThere are lots of other technical difficulties to overcome, but maybe this comment simplifies some of the main scientific ideas from the article above.', ""Translation:\n\n> **Everyone is puzzling over the McLaren trick. A student may have found the key to the secret with his doctoral thesis. We explain this ingenious idea that could be used to cool tires.**\n\n> Formula 1 has rarely been so confused. The McLaren MCL39 is a fast racing car, but it's not far behind Red Bull and Mercedes in setting a fast lap. Yet it harbors a secret. It's already apparent during the qualifying laps, especially on tracks that put a lot of strain on the tires. The McLarens don't degrade over the lap because the tires stay within the temperature range.\n\n> In races, the Papaya racers are usually in a different league. They can conserve their tires and thus their lap times at a high level. When the tire temperatures of their rivals begin to rise, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris disappear into the distance with a lead of more than a second per lap. Regardless of the tire type. Here, too, the more the track layout, the asphalt, or the external conditions stress the tires, the greater the McLaren advantage.\n\n> This is a completely new quality of superiority. In the past, the competition searched for the key to why the fastest car was so fast. Now they have to figure out why this McLaren has so much endurance. One thing is clear to everyone after the Miami GP. More downforce and stable car balance may be ingredients in the cocktail, but the real secret lies elsewhere.\n\n> **Everyone looks at the brake ventilation.**\nMcLaren's opponents now know where to look. Photos of the brake ventilation systems are piled up on their desks. Sometimes closed, sometimes open. But they reveal nothing. Things only get interesting when the mechanics work on the extremely complex cooling system. But that's exactly when McLaren employees line up in front of the car like footballers at the free-kick wall, and you can't see anything.\n\n> The question of all questions is why mechanics always behave so suspiciously. That might be the answer. The solution might only be found if one could see what the mechanics are changing, adjusting, replacing, or checking. The regulations regarding brake ventilation are relatively clear. The so-called drum, which encloses the entire assembly and is located directly under the rim, is subject to strict regulations regarding its dimensions. However, the air flow inside and the materials used are free.\n\n> A small clue to solving the mystery may have emerged. It could, but doesn't have to, be the key. Eight years ago, a student researched the use of phase-change materials for his doctoral thesis at McLaren. Martin Buchan is now an aerodynamics engineer. He has now shared his knowledge in a\xa0YouTube video\xa0and drawn his own conclusions.\n\n> **Brakes hot and tires cool.**\nBrake vents have two functions. They are designed to cool the brakes, but keep them hot enough for optimal deceleration. They are also designed to quickly heat the tires via the rims, but then keep them within this temperature window for as long as possible. The challenge lies in balancing these two mutual requirements.\n\n> Even with the most skillful approach, the heat radiated by the brakes and the car will transfer to the tires. Especially during a race. Last year, Red Bull suspected that McLaren was filling its tires with water to keep them cool. The FIA \u200b\u200brefuted the suspicion. McLaren was subjected to several thorough inspections. The result was the same every time: This car is legal.\n\n> So there had to be some ingenious trick keeping the brakes hot and the tires cool. A trick that works without sensors, electronics, actuators, or the use of coolant. In other words, a process that runs passively and follows the laws of physics and chemistry. Presumably, McLaren's brake ducts aren't all that different mechanically from those of competitors.\n\n> **The miraculous heat storage.**\nInside the drum-shaped brake linings, there is usually a second sleeve with fins attached that influence the airflow. A channel runs between the two walls, which determines the temperature that the outer casing radiates onto the wheel rim. This is the case with all cars.\n\n> One could now imagine McLaren shielding this channel towards the inner panel with a very special material. A so-called phase-change material, which is also used in batteries, for example, as a heat storage device. The same requirements apply there as for tires. The temperature should rise quickly, but not exceed a certain target.\n\n> In the case of tires, it would work like this: The dissipated braking heat heats up the tire. According to this theory, McLaren would interrupt this process by having the insulating material change its state of matter, for example, from solid to liquid. During this transition, the temperature remains constant despite further external heat input.\n\n> The temperature in the outer drum triggers the phase change. The material used depends on the temperature at which the stop sign must be set. The amount of phase-change material used determines how long the heat is maintained at the desired level. A clever air distribution system can reverse the cooling direction. The brakes are then cooled to a point where the material has resolidified.\n\n> **Evidence for two-phase theory.**\nAdmittedly, this all sounds a bit otherworldly, but it's at least plausible. There's some evidence to support this. For example, Red Bull's disruptive maneuver with water in the tires. Team employees insist they saw moisture on the inside of McLaren's rims on several occasions. But the likely source wasn't the tire, but the brake drum. Perhaps fluid was sweating out during the phase transition.\n\n> It's also interesting to note that Red Bull complained at last year's Austrian GP that McLaren had been driving with temperature sensors on the brake drums. This is only permitted during free practice. According to Red Bull, McLaren did it at least once during the rest of the weekend. If this is true, it could be interpreted as the engineers trying to find out more about the temperatures inside the fairing during a race.\n\n> It's also noticeable that McLaren often performs aggressive long runs in the third free practice session, leaving the competition far behind. Perhaps they're trying to find out under extreme conditions whether everything is working as planned.\n\n> It's obviously no easy task to get this process working. A lot of development and testing goes into it. It looks like McLaren already tried out a precursor to the system after the 2024 summer break. Starting with the Dutch GP, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have excelled, especially in the second half of the races. The competition was already wondering how the two kept their tires in such good condition.\n\n> Even if rivals already know exactly what McLaren is doing, it's not that easy to copy the trick. Red Bull may already have a theory pointing in this direction. Recently, Max Verstappen has been complaining more and more frequently about mysterious braking problems. When asked whether this was related to tire cooling, team boss Christian Horner gave only monosyllabic answers."", 'This is the cool engineering shit that makes AP Calc worth it.', 'Good read! More information provided! It’s more and more likely phase-changing material is the trick. Let’s see how the whole thing develops. Fun time for the F1 tech world! 😄', 'It’s an interesting theory—slush definitely is a useful temperature buffer. I’m somewhat skeptical of the practicalities, however. This is all unsprung weight, and making it heavy should meaningfully impact traction. Can they afford enough buffet material not to saturate over the course of a race?', 'So... Is a heatpipe (Like the ones you see in PC coolers) but at a competitive, fast and more secret level?', "">It's also interesting to note that Red Bull complained at last year's Austrian GP that McLaren had been driving with temperature sensors on the brake drums. This is only permitted during free practice. According to Red Bull, McLaren did it at least once during the rest of the weekend. If this is true, it could be interpreted as the engineers trying to find out more about the temperatures inside the fairing during a race.\n\nThis has me a bit puzzled, if this is truly not allowed and they actually did it, how didn't a massive DSQ and sporting penalties follow. Just creating your own testing sessions is easily the biggest advantage you can have in a test deprived time like we are in now?\n\nEither the FIA took a massive shit on integrity or it's not true imo"", ""Interesting read!

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.
