For me it‚Äôs hard believe that we don‚Äôt have the tech available to fully transition to drones. 

I‚Äôve seen drones here and there, but looks like they‚Äôre only used for media shots and not racing really. 

It doesn‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre only use drones for races. 

If anybody has more information on this, please share?

Sounds ironical in today‚Äôs emission issues for a firm like F1 has choppers flying all around for hours and hours. ","[""Aren't drones - especially camera ones - pretty slow compared to a F1 car? I remember Red Bull had to make a special one for their video to be able to keep up and it barely did.\n\nMeanwhile a guy with a proper lens (that's also a few kilos of glass, so way above what can be mounted on a drone doing 300km/h on a straight) on a helicopter doesn't have to be as close as a drone to get a good shot."", ""I heard in a media podcast by one of the F1 team they can't have drones fly over the track at all during a race so it heavily limits their use"", ""Have you seen the camera equipment on those helicopters? You need a vehicle the size of a helicopter just to haul that stuff around. I'd imagine military grade stuff is out of the question, so it's cheaper to just use a helicopter instead of developing a drone that can carry the equipment and is fast enough to keep up with the cars."", 'drones dont have the performance to carry TV broadcast cameras at the speeds required for F1 coverage\n\nthey can (and probably do) use them for short tracking shots around slower parts of the track, but if you want to actually capture a car going down an entire straight you need the power of an actual helo\n\nalso i suspect that its just straight cheaper to have one camera mounted on a helicopter than a bunch of cameras mounted on drones to achieve the same coverage. broadcast quality cameras and lenses are *hilariously* expensive (100-200k USD), and buying and insuring a bunch more of them for drone use, plus paying for a bunch of drone operators (who arent exactly cheap either) probably just costs as much as renting that helicopter, and you get less cinematic shots', "">  I‚Äôve seen drones here and there, but looks like they‚Äôre only used for media shots and not racing really.   \n  \nHelicopters can stay in the air for 2 hours and fly around at 250kph and has enough spare power to power the camera and transmission signals.  \n  \nA drone battery may last 30 minutes, it's unpredictable, unstable in the wind, has transmission delays and hasn't been certified to fly over large crowds.  \n  \nTo be as stable as a helicopter and stay in the air as long you may just use a helicopter instead of a military grade UAV, to avoid the issues and have 2 people operating different aspects of it for safety reasons."", 'Honestly I don‚Äôt think either are great for f1, drones aren‚Äôt fast enough yet to keep up with the cars and helicopters aren‚Äôt manoeuvrable enough around a track where as in a situation like the WRC they are great as follow cameras.
