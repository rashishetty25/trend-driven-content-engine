1mp083y,Explained: How the FIA plans to avoid a repeat of Mercedes' 2014 scenario in F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mp083y/explained_how_the_fia_plans_to_avoid_a_repeat_of/,2025-08-13, Technical,,"['""There is no amount of money or special regulation that can overturn the disadvantage of incompetence.""\n\n-Ron Dennis', ""If there's one constant in F1, it's that a team will always find a way to dominate. F1 is defined by eras of pure dominance."", ""I dislike the desire to keep the engines so similar. The PU is just as big a part of a car's performance as the aero, but only one gets a push to keep equal.  \n  \nPersonally, I'd just figure out a way to roll engine development into the cost cap and variable testing restrictions, then let teams prioritize one vs the other. You find a way to increase HP by 10% but at the cost of your aero development, then you have that option."", 'There is no token system this time so even if someone runs away with their engine it should be easier to catch up', 'The worst thing that could happen to F1 right now is one team dominating for five to six years. Eventually it would lead to casual fans (those who have latched on through DTS, the movie, word of mouth) to drop off again. Ideally we need four or five teams that are regularly fighting at the front, with any of them able to win on any given Sunday if they hook up the car, the strategy, the execution - kind of like 2010, 2012.', 'Mercedes having a massive performance advantage come 2014 was partly down to the fact that at the time Engine Manufacturers didnt have to provide their customers with the same specification of engine. They could just hand them lower performance versions in order to avoid competition. This is where the whole ""you cant win unless you\'re a works team"" mentality came from \n\nThese days, its required for Manufacturers to give identical engines to their customers \n\nSo let\'s say Mercedes nails the engines again, McLaren, Williams and Alpine will all equally benefit from it', ""A team can still dominate; how many resources this year and last have gone towards this? For some teams, a lot more than in 2013. What Mercedes accomplished is still marvelous, but it's like tanking in any NA sports league to get a high draft pick, draft a player that'll be a corner stone for a title contending team for the next generation. But at the end of the day, if you've got a problem, fix your f$\\*()#\\* car."", 'I really have a feeling the 2026 rules will fail miserably and the entire fan base they have build up over the years will quickly dissappear... I hope i am wrong', 'Simple, provide info to all engine manufacturers at the same time instead of 4 years after you provide it to Mercedes who pitched and pushed for that specific engine formula in the first place']",1177,253,0.97,1177,232,232,78,9,0.0,78
