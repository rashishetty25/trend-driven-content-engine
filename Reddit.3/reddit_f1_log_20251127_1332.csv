However, the safety margin was negated by the unexpected onset of the large vertical oscillations, which caused the car to touch the ground.

Norris, Piastri, and Verstappen are currently all still in contention to win, however that can change in Qatar. No matter what, Norris cannot win in the sprint, but he can clinch in the GP if he:

* Outscores Piastri by 2 or more points (across the entire weekend) - unless Norris wins the GP, in which case he just needs to outscore Piastri by 1 point, and
* Outscores Verstappen by 1 or more points - unless Verstappen wins the GP, in which case Norris needs to outscore him by 2 points.

If Norris outscores only one of Piastri or Verstappen by the appropriate amount, that driver will be eliminated, even if Norris does not clinch the title.

**WCC:** Mercedes are getting close to clinching 2nd in the WCC, which they can do in Qatar if they:

* Outscore Red Bull by 4 or more points over the entire weekend, and
* Are not outscored by Ferrari by more than 10 points.

I’d figure that both drivers would get the same car, same build, etc… but recently we’ve been hearing about Max getting a brand new engine, and I didn’t hear anything about if Tsunoda got one as well.

Obviously Max is much better, so if they’ve only got one engine to give, they should put it in his car, but it generally got me wondering if the cars have to match, or if weaker drivers fall even further behind by a team giving upgrades to the favored driver.","['Both cars are the same basic design.

Teams may not have enough parts to have both cars on the same spec, they may want to run two different specs of a part of test purposes, or they may have minor differences for driver preference, like McLaren this year. But they generally won't develop two different cars for their drivers.\n\nEngine components are restricted, so teams can only use a certain number per season, and the limit is per car. So each car has its own pool of restricted parts they can use. Exceeding the limit comes with a penalty. They took that penalty for max in Brazil because they already got the highest penalty for another matter, so it didnt make a difference. And they later did the same with Yuki in Vegas because again, the effective penalty was almost none."", ""Usually is the same car, but there's some priority who gets the upgraded parts."", ""first off, the spec of car being the same or different completely depends on the team, some teams will give different specs of car to each driver if they prefer different things (mclaren, for example, brought a suspension change early in the season that oscar doesn't like, so oscar doesn't use it and lando does)\n\nwith the max engine change, each driver has a max number of engine parts they can take, so you only change it when you need to. Changing yuki's engine just because they changed max's makes no sense"", ""The same car.\n\nYou can't see it, but at Red Bull Yuki actually sits on Max's lap and Max lets him drive on the straights."", ""Only when the upgrades first hit will there be any major differences outside of it being setup related. That's just because when upgrades are first manufactured there might not be enough stock to outfit both cars, so it goes to whichever driver is seen as the number 1 with the team."", ""Yuki's car is made of lead.
