Jumped into the deepest end
Pushing himself to all extremes

Wanted to be a part of it
Pulled out some poor machinery

Quicker than the blinking of an eye

He's the master of going faster

Where there is nothing left to spare
Still the crowds came pouring in
Some had hoped to see him fail
Filling their hearts with jealousies
Crazy people with love so frail
