1jzint0,The new “Radio Rewind” series on F1’s Youtube channel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jzint0/the_new_radio_rewind_series_on_f1s_youtube_channel/,2025-04-15, Discussion,"There’s been a noticeable change in F1’s video format on YouTube. In the past couple of years, F1 consistently uploaded “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 Onboards” for every race weekend. It was a very good format and fans for the most part are enjoying it. However, this year they’ve completely dropped these two series in favor of “Radio Rewind.”

Now, “Radio Rewind” isn’t exactly new — it was typically used for classic races like Malaysia 2012, Canada 2011, Australia 2010, and Hungary 2006. But it seems like they now plan to make one for every race weekend.

Normally, I wouldn’t complain about it. I mean, it’s basically a combination of “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 (or even more) Onboards” in a single video. However, after the first few races, I have to say I’m not a fan of this new format.

First of all, it only focuses on the race (or the sprint, if there is one), completely leaving out practice sessions and qualifying. That’s a huge shame, because there are often a lot of interesting or funny team radios — or even crashes — that get missed.

Secondly, there’s the issue many fans have pointed out: the lack of subtitles for the team radio. Personally, I find this absurd. Formula 1 team radio has never been known for its clarity, so without subtitles, it’s really hard to understand what’s being said — especially when it comes to technical terms.

I’m not sure why they’ve chosen this direction. Maybe it’s to push out more videos per race weekend, but so far, it seems fans and viewers aren’t happy with it. The comment section under the latest Bahrain GP “Radio Rewind” video was filled with people asking F1 to bring back the old format — separating the onboards and team radio into two separate videos, just like last year.

So what do you think of this new format? Do you like it, or do you also want to go back to the old one?","[""Yeah it's bad. Seems like a cost cutting measure to me.\n\nBut 90% of the comments on those videos are people complaining, so I'm sure they know."", '""maybe it\'s to push out more videos per race weekend"" \n\nbut theyre doing the opposite? 2023 we used to get radio rewind, top 10 onboards and post-race radio of every driver. now it\'s condensed in one video.', 'And the captions were not just for better understanding, they would add fun little effects to it like shaking when driver was shouting, or text bouncing when the car was porpoising', 'I do miss the post-race radio of every driver.', ""I watched one - I don't think I even watched it to the end.

1jz4tzl,The 2025 Bahrain Grand Prix: In data,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jz4tzl/the_2025_bahrain_grand_prix_in_data/,2025-04-14, Technical,"Thought, I could do one of those after a GP.  
I left out the comparisons of AMR and Sauber because... not really much going on over there.

RBR is in a *bad* spot right now. Being slower than Alpine isn't any good. Comparing VER and GAS makes it visible, that Max absolutely had to give it all to overtake his old team mate. When looking over to the VER-TSU comparison: VER's Hard stint was absolutely awful. Which begs the question: Why did they not have enough Mediums left to go for a S-M-M strat? Many things going wrong right now at RBR.  
  
Piastri controlled the pace well enough to never be in any danger, but on paper, the Ferraris should have been in podium contention. Gasly told his RE, that Leclerc told him on the drivers parade, that they are looking at a one-stop. And LEC did ask to think about Plan Delta, when called to the box. Hülkenberg did a 30-lap-stint on Mediums, but I doubt, that would have been an option for the front-runners. Plus, the rather strange choice to put on Mediums again, which forces you to swap to a compound in the last stint, that you  might don't even want to put on.  
  
 Haas did everything right, with Bearman capitalizing on the SC-discounted pitstops, and having overall strong pace. Bearman was struggling at first, but then got his footing, being at times faster than his team mate.  
  
Antonelli got rather screwed over by the strategy department, with ditching the Mediums after just 15 laps and then having to pit again after just 5 laps. Turning a P5 into a P11 is not exactly spectacular.  
Russell was in serious trouble and, looking at the pace comparison between him and Norris, benefitted mostly by Norris' mistakes.","['Regarding the one stop. Those hards were so bad, they were probably the wrong option in any strategy.', ""If the hards weren't so bad I think the race could have been even better, best race so far tho"", 'Charles’ final stint pace was actually impressive comparing to Hamilton, considering he is also defending against Norris for most part of the stint.', 'The sc really screwed ferrari didnt it', ""Ferrari did an upgrade correctly.

Only reason that could make sense is if he had a massive lock-up in the first laps in his 3rd stint, but I don\'t think that\'s what happened, they would\'ve shown a replay. Putting him on softs for the 25 or so final laps was risky but he didn\'t have a set of mediums left, and as we saw the hard tyre was absolutely putrid.\xa0\n\n\nBefore the restart Norris\' RE told him Russell was already worried about having a soft on but Norris replied that he shouldn\'t be because the soft was ""mega"" and was a good tyre.\xa0\n\n\nRegarding his stint on mediums, I think the reason they pitted him after only 15 laps may be because he cooked his tyres pretty bad. Russell did about 20 laps on the mediums and was lapping in the high 1:37s / low 1:38s. Antonelli only did a single lap in the 1:37s and every other lap was in the mid or high 1:38s and his last 2 laps were even in the low 1:39s.\xa0\n\n\nAlso the fact that he lost several places at the start probably made him push a bit more than he wanted in his first stint to try and get those positions back, which also damaged his tyres. His pace on the softs wasn\'t horrible but wasn\'t great either', ""Cathartic to see red bull out of contention after the last 3 years.

Now that the dust has settled in Bahrain, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""George's drive yesterday should be the last slide in his powerpoint deck for contract renewal. Really brilliant race management considering the DRS problems. He was also showing race intelligence with lifting because he was aware of the DRS activation and it saved his P2. In the long term view of the season, if Mercedes brings good upgrades this save can be really important for his WDC bid"", 'It’s like all the action we missed in Japan just got postponed to Bahrain and we got double action. No wonder the TV directors couldn’t keep up. \n\nRegardless of any debates on drivers, direction, and championships, what a race!', 'Gotta say Antonelli really impressed me even though his race got ruined a few times lol. \n\nLooks like he’s the real deal just needs a couple seasons.', ""Yesterday was a great example of why it's important for the Hard tyre to always be the slowest, or at least not be be the obvious 'best' race tyre. We need more of that."", ""On a more positive note considering it would be nice for levity, let me redirect my attention to Haas\n\nIn the aftermath of Ocon's unfortunate crash around that turn and Bearman qualifying dead last, it seems like it is a race to be left in the pits. The sheer grit and consistency pulled off, alongside with the strategy that got their drivers climbing up the pack to take away double points for the weekend is so rejuvenating to watch! I am so, so thrilled to see Haas in this form, and I'm so glad to see Komatsu and the crew leading the charge. I really am rooting for these guys, through and through!"", '14 point spread between 1st and 4th for WDC, now this is fun.', 'Ferrari strategy was brilliant yesterday, they got screwed over by the SC. Should have ended Leclerc P2/P3 and Lewis P4/5.', 'The soft outperforming the hard over a 40% race distance stint is so crazy and makes so little sense. Fuck these tires.', ""McLaren - class of the field this race, especially Oscar. Hopefully just one of the stronger tracks for them. It missed a battle out at the front, but that's more down to Lando underperforming in qualifying and then having mistakes here and there in the race which meant he couldn't go on the attack.\xa0\n\n\nMercedes - strong car this weekend, with yet another brilliant drive from Russell. Too bad they decided to have a strategic blunder on Kimi's side. Loved to see all his overtakes though, even if he did get stuck in a DRS train in the final stretch of the race.\xa0\n\n\nFerrari - had a good strategy. Did something opposite their rivals and could have paid off had the SC not ruined it a bit. I think given the circumstances both cars maximised their result.\n\n\nRBR - they usually have one or two off races during the season where pretty much everything goes wrong (pitstops, strategy, no pace). Let's see if this was that outlier or a preview of more to come. Nice to see that despite all that Yuki managed to finish in the points too.\xa0\n\n\nAlpine - their strongest race to date. Well executed for Gasly. Didn't quite managed to hold on to P6, but P7 is also a very strong result. I'm not sure what happened to Doohan tbh. I guess the tyres fell off, but didn't pay too close attention to his race.\n\n\nHAAS - team of the day if you ask me. They managed to turn around a pretty poor quali into a double points finish. Also helps to have two quality drivers (they've come far since 2021).\xa0\n\n\nSauber - rather anonymous. I wouldn't be able to tell where they finished without looking at the results.\xa0\n\n\nAston Martin - also pretty anonymous. A better race for Alonso than the previous three, but that's all there's to say on my part.\n\n\nWilliams - quite disappointing, tbh. I don't know if the pressure to perform is getting to Sainz, but as someone else said in a comment, it felt like KMag was back on track. Albon didn't quite manage to impress either,\xa0 but at least he made up a few positions after being robbed of a Q2 appearance.\n\n\nRB - also quite disappointing. Just didn’t seem to have the pace. I'm not sure if all the penalties Lawson received were fair compared to some other incident going unpunished, but even without these, it didn't look like he was having a good weekend.\n\n\nOverall, the race was very enjoyable with lots of action up and down the field. It only lacked a fight for the win.\xa0"", 'Was a fun race, probably helped by the fact that the best team-driver combination of the current grind was suffering from issues with their car, but it was still fun to watch.\n\n\nPiastri in my opinion is using the relative lack of expectations towards him very well, probably helped by the fact that Norris is struggling a bit, either with the car, or mentally, but his usual advantages seem to be gone for now. Although even last year we had a few weekends where he seemed lost, but in the end and overall he was the stronger driver, so we will see. WCC seems like a lock for Mclaren either way.\n\n\nFerrari, Alpine, and Haas were the big positives for me as well, it was nice to see them performing above the expectations.']",46,190,0.9,46,1582,1582,1,7,0.0,1
