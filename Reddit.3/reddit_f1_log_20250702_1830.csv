How come we dont see any drivers from those series come and have a shot in F1 and F2? It feels like there is a lot of potential in those series that will never be able to shine on the international stage imo.","[""Super Formula races Suzuka. Indy has raced at COTA. Just compare the times\n\n2019 when Indy was at COTA the lap time was 1:49. F1 lap time was 1:32. F2 is about 15-20 seconds slower than F1. So Indycar and F2 are pretty comparable.\n\nF1 at Suzuka record: 1:30 \n\nSuper Formula: 1:37\n\nSuper Formula is in between F1 and F2. Indy is slightly slower than F2. But they're built for different specs. F1 isn't a spec series like the rest of them too."", ""Yes, SF is faster than F2. There's also an SF champion currently racing in F2, although most SF drivers will be happy racing in the prime racing series of Japan. People in Indy NXT aim for Indy, and/or lack the budget for F2, but the only single-seater series an IndyCar driver would want to go to is F1, and that's not a given (I'm sure people in the F1 paddock have called Palou). There's also the factor of IndyCar giving too few SL points for its level; just ask Colton Herta.\n\nRealistically, the pipeline mostly goes the other way. Look at how many IndyCar drivers started their careers in the feeder series ladder over in Europe, and then there are the ex-F1 drivers."", ""Bringing in a driver from Indycar is difficult. Deliberately so. \n\nMcLaren Indycar driver Pato O'Ward would need 40 super licence points to drive in F1, but his last 3 seasons in Indycar were 5th (8pts), 4th (10pts), and 7th (4pts) giving him a total of just 22 of the 40 points required. Had he got the same results in F2 they would have been 5th (20pts), 4th (30pts), and 7th (8pts) for a total of 58 points and a super licence. Fuck, he'd have got more points getting those results in F3, 5th (12pts), 4th (15pts), and 7th (7pts) for a total of 34 points. \n\nThe FIAs crappy assessment of Indycar results is near mirrored by their view of Superformula.\n\nThe FIA wants drivers to come up through their ranks."", 'IndyCar on Roads is quite similar to F2 in speed. Indy has more HP, but little less down force currently. On Ovals IndyCar reach 240 MPH. \n\nCurrently a good chunk of drivers from F2 move to Indy. There is no movement from Indy to anything but potentially F1 and that is pretty dead due to a lot of factors. \n\nSF is a bit faster than F2. There is some movement from F2 to SF and one SF champion is currently driving F2, with not much to show for after 1 1/2 seasons. \n\nIndy NXT is plenty fast for a feeder series. It has 450 HP (+50HP for P2P) and decent down force for what it is. It has 70 HP more than F3 and I would say comparable downforce. IndyNXT should be as fast or faster than F3. \n\nF4 is miles away from F3 and Indy NXT.', ""There's multiple reasons why drivers from non F-eeder classes aren't getting the same amount of shots as ones that are in the system.\n\n1: Points. Drivers in the other classes don't get the same amount of points as say, being a top 4 driver in F3 and/or F2 for a few seasons. A recent example being Colton Herta who just missed out on a superlicense despite having very impressive Indycar results.\n\n1.5: To add to that, Indycar (and most series with Americanized point systems) are inherently harder to succeed in. With a much bigger part of the grid getting points, as well as the points differentials being lower between winners and the rest of the top 5, as well as racing being much less prone to success monopoly (rd. one team/driver winning a majority of races due to superior equipment), it's much harder to consistently finish the season in high enough positions to accrue good license points, further exasperated by the lower license points.\n\n2: Feeder bias. The paddock is a small world, and being at the same race weekends as F1 teams has a significant effect on in-paddock perception of drivers and their talent. They're more scouted, there's more attention for them simply by being around major teams all the time. More often than not, many feeder drivers are also part of a young driver programme for one of the F1 teams (As well as often sharing sports agents that are 'in' with F1 teams), so F1 teams have a greater incentive to focus on their own youth than look to drivers outside of their own programmes.\n\n2.5: Also politically speaking, Liberty and the FIA want to prefer the feeder series because they are literally built to feed into F1. Teams structurally ignoring drivers from feeder series would hurt the prestige of the series, make it less marketeable, make young drivers less likely to go through the feeder series, and generally be seen as not being THE way to get into F1. There's a lot of money and corporate stakes at play who want the feeder series to keep its advantages.\n\n3: Level of competition. I won't claim F2 is a superior racing class with superior drivers to Indycar and Super Formula. But generally speaking they have a broader field of international talent, and there's definitely an inherent bias from teams and media towards Feeder series drivers as being better. Localized series with a heavy contingent of local drivers (for example, Super Formula only has 4 non-Japanese drivers this year) feeds the idea that there's less true talent, and thus drivers who don't utterly dominate are seen as inferior than drivers who have reasonable success in F2/F3. It's kinda unfair, but it's a pervasive bias that has existed for a long time.\n\n4: Car/track experience. Whilst Indycar and Super Formula have comparable open-wheel cars, they are very much their own class of cars with their own quirks and limitations. F2 and F3 have specifically been designed around being a ladder towards F1, with rulesets and cars (where reasonable) built around F1 specs. They also race on the same tracks (see point 2) as the F1 teams, so drivers have more track know-how, even though simulator work has become more prevalent, teams appreciate practical experience. It also leans into some of the earlier biases, but a top 4 F2 driver is seen as more F1-Ready than someone coming in from Indycar (where there's also a lot more oval racing that isn't present in F1)\n\nHonestly I agree with you that I would love to see F1 pull in more talent from outside their usual feeder series bubble, but F1 is nothing if not a world of politics and looking inward. The FIA and Liberty would love to see an American driver, but they want 'their' American driver, one they can in some form or fashion can mold as an F1 star and not necessarily one that cut their teeth in Indycar or elsewhere."", 'It is not necessarily speed that you use to measure the differences between races. For example, Indycar races on ovals and success there requires a skill set that is not developed in circuit racing.', ""I think when it comes to singleseaters and how the talent ranks you have:\n\n- Indycar/Formula E\n- F2\n- Super Formula\n- F3\n- IndyNXT\n- FRECA\n- F4\n\nThere's probably other categories that I've forgotten but I think thats the general order. Indy and FE I find tough to seperate. I think FE has more breadth of talent through the field as Indy has some weak pay drivers, but also Indy has brilliant guys in the top half. These two championships are clear 2nd options if you miss F1.\n\nI did think about putting SF ahead of F2 because it has more professional drivers but I do think it being so national lowers the level of talent in its field. Just not enough international drivers, and the ones we have seen tend to do really well. \n\nIn terms of speed though it goes:\n\n- Super Formula\n- F2/Indycar\n- F3/IndyNXT/FE\n- FRECA\n- F4"", 'Super Formula is typically considered a top-tier racing series, despite some teams treating it as a feeder for F1', 'If you want to adapt to go to F1, Super Formula is definitely the right way, for the championship IndyCar is definitely the right one']",48,56,0.79,48,215,215,3,0,0.010000000000000009,3

I'm aware he was the GP2 champ in 2012, and was the reserve driver for Lotus.

I also remember that a bunch of people said he should have been tapped to replace Raikonnen in the last couple of races in the season when he hurt his back (ie when he refused to race because Lotus wasn't paying him) but they pulled Kovalainen out of retirement instead.

After that Davide found himself without a drive, and didn't have any serious sponsors so he went to go race sportscars until the Italian media hired him.","['They often say a third year GP2/F2 champ is not good enough for F1.

They did him dirty"", ""Not as good as he is on the mic, but that's also a high bar."", ""Likely the worst GP2/F2 champion, only Fabio Leimer comes close. He didn't win in his fifth year on F2 level, but in his *seventh* as he did two years of F Renault 3.5 before going to GP2. In F1 he would've been probably somewhere between Chilton and Ericsson in terms of  performance."", 'He-a was-a good-e, destind for gereatness-a', 'Nowhere near good enough for F1.', ""A low mid tier young driver that stuck to F2 until he had enough experience and there was no one worth writing about the same year to win it.\n\nSo not really good, no one cared about him as far as F1 goes, the same way no one cared about Pantano or Leimer, these 3 were the textbooks examples of how some years the driver line up wasn't stellar and an old timer could win it (same thing would be said if Verschoor wins this year)"", ""Can't find the article, but I remember reading a piece in F1 Racing magazine about Valsecchi how he was a demon in karting, but it didn't necessarily transfer to cars.
