This is his memory about a practical joke pulled by Piquet against Charlie Whiting.

""Nelson was used to peeing himself on purpose before a Grand Prix. Frankly disgusting. After a few minutes on track, on the grid, some liquid started dripping from the car. Mechanics and technicians scrambled to find the origin of the leak. Piquet nods to Whiting. 'What happens? A leak? Is it oil?'. There is no time, the race is starting... Charles lay on the tarmac, touches the liquid, try to identify it, smells it, *tastes* it. And understands.

1mmr96j,Alternative History - Standings with Best of Counts,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mmr96j/alternative_history_standings_with_best_of_counts/,2025-08-10, Statistics,"Over the years we had close championship fights in Formula 1 history, but until 1991 not all races were counted. From 1981 to 1990 only 11 out of 16 races were counted, which corresponds to 68.75% of the races ran. This was why between 1988-1990 Japan (second to last race) was the decider, even though under modern system the challenger would still have a chance in Adelaide (last race).

But what if Formula 1 continued this policy to this day and adjusted counting races for driver standings according to the calendar size? I tried to find this by only adjusting best-of-race count corresponding to similar calendar percentages. For example for 18 races best of 13 would count, for 20 races best of 14 would count and so forth.

Here are the yearly changes (with race count and total race number):

1991- Senna's 9 points don't count, but nothing else changes. (11/16)

1992- Mansell's one podium doesn't count, nothing changes (11/16)

1993- Prost loses 7 points, nothing else changes (11/16)

1994- Hill loses 1 point coming into the last race (92-90), he can go to maximum 94 (11th best was 6 points) but Schumi had only 10 points finishes. Therefore even if Hill wins Schumi can be 2nd and win (theoretical 96-94). So championship doesn't change and we won't have that infamous collision. (11/16)

1995- Stays the same, Schumi has 12 points finishes. (12/17)

1996- First big change : By finishing second at Portugal , Damon Hill wins before the final race of the season (Jacques could only gain 6 points instead of 10). (11/16)

1997- Schumi's win at Japan ties them on points but Villeneuve leads by 2 wins, so conditions for Jerez are the same, Schumi gets excluded, no changes. (12/17)

1998- H√§kkinen and Schumi is tied with 2 races to go, then Mika wins and opens a 5 point gap (Schumi's 11th finish is 4 points). So situation in Japan is like real life, this time Mika can secure with 2nd place. Schumi retires, nothing else changes. (11/16)

1999- Irvine leads at final race by 2 points. If Schumi wins, Eddie can clinch it by finishing 3rd. Mika wins to make it double, nothing else changes. (11/16)

2000- Schumi can clinch the title by finishing 2nd at final 2 races, despite what Mika does. He wins at Japan anyway. Couple points drops for top 4 but everything else stays the same. (11/16)

2001- 9 wins, 3 runner-up places, Schumi was 12 points away from perfection. Same standings. (12/17)

2002- Even better, only 1 runner-up and 11 wins counted for Schumi, 4 points away from maximum. Everyone else (except Montoya) doesn't even have 12 points finishes. (12/17)

2003- Big points change bring massive competition. Coming into USA (Race 15) Schumi and Montoya is at 79, Kimi is at 75. Schumi wins, for last race it is Schumi 86, Kimi and Montoya 80. This time Kimi is mathematically out (can only gain 5) but Montoya can clinch it, if he wins and Schumi finishes lower than 4th. Barrichello wins anyway, so Schumi is still champion and Kimi is still 2nd. (11/16)

2004- First maximum points season over 40+ years, 13/13 for Schumi in second to last race. He wins the championship one round earlier, matching his record from 2002 (6 races to go). (13/18)

2005- Alonso still wins at Brazil, but his 11 points don't count so season finishes closer than real life (122-112) (14/19)

2006- Schumi's engine blow makes him go 6 points behind in Japan, but situation is not hopeless. If he wins and Massa finishes 2nd, he will be champion on countback regardless of what Alonso does (1 more win and Alonso's worst counted finish is 2nd). He faces problems, Massa wins, Alonso is the champion by 5 points (118-113). (13/18)

2007- Win in Japan makes Hamilton go 7 points clear but crashing out in China and win by Raikkonen makes an incredible final. Hamilton is on 98, Kimi and Alonso 95.

Kimi can win by finishing in top 2 and have Massa win, but Alonso has to win because he will be identical to Lewis if Alonso finishes 2nd. Lewis can finish in top 2 if Kimi doesn't win. Final race happens, and I take a personal liberty. Ferrari made Kimi go in front IRL because they needed it, but here 2nd is enough so they let Massa win. Alonso is 3rd so Lewis has no chance of improving his points (worst is 4th).

Final standings are Kimi 98 (1 more win), Lewis 98, Alonso 96, Massa 90. (12/17)

2008- FIRST CHANGE! Gap before the Brazilian race stays the same, but this time if Massa wins, Hamilton has to finish in top 3 (countback advantage Massa). Hamilton struggles, ""is that Glock"" is not important and Massa clinches the championship by 1 point because Lewis's 14th best finish (2 points) don't count (13/18)

2009- Button still wins in Brazil. However his 8 points don't count, so he finishes way way close to Vettel this time (87-84). (12/17)

2010- More points are distributed from this year. Before the final race Alonso is at 242, Webber 232, Vettel 231. Hamilton is already out at 222 (max 17 point gain in Abu Dhabi). Because of this, Ferrari focuses on leading Vettel. Alonso still bottles the start and still needs to pass Rosberg (like IRL) so in the end Vettel still wins. Final points are Vettel 250, Alonso 244, Webber 232, Hamilton 232. (14/19)

2011- 11 wins and 3 second places for Vettel (329/392), Button finishes second and closer, but biggest loser is Webber. He drops from third to fifth, Alonso and Hamilton (despite having 31 points less) jumps him. (14/19)

2012- Vettel goes 13 points in front at final race (255-242), but this time Alonso has to win or he's out. If he wins, Vettel needs to finish at least 4th for countback. Alonso comes really close but Button takes the victory in Brazil, Alonso loses it by 5 points (255-250). Hamilton jumps Raikkonen for third in WDC. (14/20)

2013- 13 wins, 1 second place, 7 points from perfection. Vettel clinches it one round before Indian GP (race 15), Raikkonen jumps Hamilton for fourth. (14/19)

2014- Despite double points, by finishing second in Brazilian GP Hamilton clinches on countback with one race to go. Nico was on 287 and at best he could achieve 319, which Lewis already was in. No other place changes. (14/19)

2015- 10 wins, 4 second places, Hamilton clinches the title one round before (hat throw doesn't happen at USA), Nico still finishes second. (14/19)

2016- Another change! At final race, Nico was on 327 and Lewis was on 324. Their worst finish was second place so whoever wins gets the championship. Lewis doesn't need to back Nico into the pack, he just files off and claims the third straight title (334-330) . Nico retires without one after chasing it for so long. (15/21)

2017- Lewis clinches one round early (at USA), his gap to Vettel shrinks to 34 points (209-275). Bottas is not so close to Vettel at 255, Ricciardo jumps Raikkonen for fourth. (14/20)

2018- After Vettel's awful results at Japan, Lewis claims fifth straight title with 4 rounds to go. Sadly Verstappen jumps Kimi for third so we wouldn't have ""drunk Kimi"" memes at FIA Gala. (15/21)

2019- Top 5 is so far ahead (because of Gasly/Albon switch), Lewis with 6th straight title, no position changes. (15/21)

2020- 11 wins, 1 runner-up, 14 points away from perfection (due to fastest laps). Lewis clinches 7th straight title before Turkish GP (4 rounds to go), Bottas barely edges Verstappen for 2nd place (215-214). (12/17)

2021- I added sprint race points to the race weekend results, so if a driver wins sprint + race (28 points) that would take priority. Verstappen leads Lewis by 5 points (350-345), and if Bottas wins & Lewis is P2, Lewis takes the title by 1 point. IRL situations happen so no change, Verstappen wins on final lap. Norris finishes P5, Leclerc P6, Sainz drops to P7. (16/22)

2022- 3 Sprint races but only best of 2 counts (66%, similar to race counts). Verstappen wins before Japan so we won't have that controversial event, with 15 wins and 1 second place. Sainz finishes in front of Russell on countback despite having 29 fewer total points (16/22, 2/3)

2023- 6 Sprint races, best of 4 counts. Verstappen maxes out stats with 19 wins and 4 sprints, clinching out the title with 6 races to go (equals the record). Only 8 fastest laps were missing. Alonso drops to P6 after missing 6 points from best-of finishes. (16/22, 4/6)

2024- No position changes, but there will be an epic event. In Brazil, from 17th on the grid, Verstappen clinches 4th straight title in heavy rain conditions, leading to an epic celebration in Sao Paulo. Before the race, Leclerc was already out with only Norris remaining in title challenge. (17/24, 4/6)

As you can see, we have two championship changing events, and many more historical events missing or created. I wonder how 2025 will play out?","['interesting read', 'On the one hand, interesting calculation. 9n the other hand, know that if point scoring would be different, some races also would end differently, due to risks being different (as you mentioned for ‚Äò94).', "">From 1981 to 1990 only 11 out of 16 **(15 in '81 and '83)** races were counted, which corresponds to 68.75% of the races ran.

The only time it was prevented from going down to the wire due to the points drop, was in '88.

1mn55uj,MONDAY TRASH TALK THREAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mn55uj/monday_trash_talk_thread/,2025-08-11, Discussion,"TRASH TALK 101 FOR ANYONE NEW HERE - BEACAUSE. TRASH. TALK. IS. A. GENERATIONAL. THREAD.

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

It just becomes a parade after T1. Especially 9th and back.\n\nThere's nothing the Sprints bring to F1 to increase action."", ""Well worth a read. Seems like there's more momentum than in the past to consider reverse grids like F3, F2 etc.\n\nThe current format is extremely conservative but because the field spread is so close we tend to see different results between Sprint and the race proper. I do think the current format will be much more predictable come next year as gaps between the teams increases though.\n\nI guess the issue for FOM is that for reverse grids to work, you'd only have one Qualifying session like in F2, F3, but they want to keep three days of action. Frankly I'd just bin Sprint Q, have two practice sessions on Friday.\n\nEdit. Recommend listening to the full exclusive podcast as well actually."", 'I never understand the desire for reverse grid.

But if you're going to add more races and in this case more sprintraces, make it worth it an do something completely different. For example, base the starting grid of the sprintrace on the current standing, but reversed. So let Piastri, Norris and Verstappen start the sprintrace in P18/19/20 and let them work their way forward. \n\nThis way the sprintrace might actually be worth it for the lower teams as well instead of being there to complete the field for even less points available."", 'As long as they keep being easy to ignore, they can do whatever they want with them', 'Having the faster cars at the back in a non spec series would just mean more crashes I feel like', 'If I were a team principle or investor in the sport, I would be seriously against this idea.
