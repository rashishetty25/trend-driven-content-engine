1ojui8q,Oscar Piastri is Scared of Flying (Probably),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ojui8q/oscar_piastri_is_scared_of_flying_probably/,2025-10-30, Is it off-season yet?,"Everyone is wondering about Oscar Piastri's dip in form. Well for me the explanation is very clear, he's scared of flying! Here is some data to back up my nonsensical theory:

Points scored at ""local"" Grand Prix:

GBR 18

HUN 18

NED 25

BEL 32

AUT 18

ESP 25

EMI 15

ITA 15

MON 15

Average: 20.11 per weekend.

  
Points scored at ""flyaway"" Grand Prix:

AUS	2

SIN 12

JPN 15

MXC 10

CHN 32

USA 10

MIA 32

CAN 12

BHR	25

SAU	25

AZE	0

Average: 15.91 per weekend.

  
As you can see, Piastri's points per weekend goes down by 4.2 points on average when at a ""flyaway"" Grand Prix. The **only** explanation for this is that Piastri is scared of flying! How else could anyone explain that dip in form? With the final four Grand Prix taking place far away from Piastri's home of Monaco, expect his performances to suffer as a result.

1ojuevd,This could be the first season that Lewis Hamilton doesn't score a podium since his debut,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ojuevd/this_could_be_the_first_season_that_lewis/,2025-10-30, Discussion,"Hamilton is currently the only driver to have stood on the podium at least once in every season he has raced. That's 18 consecutive seasons, an immense record. With only four races left and his best finish during the season being 4th (achieved at Imola, Austria, Silverstone and COTA), how likely is it looking that we'll see the 7-time champ complete his first podium-less season in F1, considering the tracks left to race on?

Is his performance this season a mark of his decline? Even in the notoriously unpredictable Mercedes cars since the 2022 regulations, he still achieved 9 podiums in the W13 (2022), 6 podiums in the W14 (2023) and 5 podiums in the W15 (2024), and he was exceptionally critical of all of those cars. Is this years Ferrari truly that unyielding that even Lewis Hamilton can't drag it to the podium, yet his teammate has achieved 7 podiums thus far in the same car?

2022 marked the first season that Lewis went without a single race win since his debut, a record of 15 seasons that he shares with Michael Schumacher.
