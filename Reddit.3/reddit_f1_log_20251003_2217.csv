More significantly, it became the first to demonstrate how the event could be more than just a sporting contest, with concerts featuring global stars, a clubbing stage and a showcase of local cuisine.\n> \n> Yet, Singapore was determined to make the race a success. The government paid 60 per cent of the total reported cost of about S$150 million, with S$33 million going towards the construction of the pit building. In recent years, the number has come down to S$135 million to S$140 million.\n> \n> This big bet seems to have paid off. Seventeen years on, Singapore remains one of the most prestigious races on the calendar. F1‚Äôs chief commercial officer Emily Prazer described Singapore as ‚Äúone of the most revered Grands Prix‚Äù earlier this year. Motorsport.com‚Äôs Europe, Middle East and Africa president James Allen said in 2018 that Singapore was the only venue besides Monaco that ‚Äúdoes more for Formula 1 than Formula 1 does for the venue‚Äù.\n> \n> But with Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and, most recently, Las Vegas now vying for the limelight with their own night races, the question is whether Singapore can continue to hold its crown.\n\n[...]\n\n> Singapore‚Äôs model has become the blueprint, with many other night races incorporating similar elements, particularly with the addition of concerts to the race weekend. Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia and Las Vegas had them integrated from their first races, while Bahrain and Qatar added them around 2014 and 2023, respectively.\n> \n> F1 itself has enjoyed an immense popularity boom, which has translated into almost a 250 per cent rise in its share price since Liberty‚Äôs takeover in 2017. It now trades at around US$100, compared to under US$30 at the time of F1‚Äôs sale.\n> \n> Singapore and the other night races have enjoyed a strong boost alongside it. The race weekend alone in the Republic brings in about S$130 million annually in terms of net spend, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in 2022, with S$2.2 billion collected from about 720,000 international visitors across 2008 to 2024.\n> \n> McKinsey & Company also estimated that the 2019 race generated S$70 to S$75 million in global media exposure.\n> \n> The hospitality sector saw a similar bump. Data from commercial real estate information company CoStar showed that Singapore hotels‚Äô revenue per available room (RevPar) increased to S$557 on race weekends from 2022 to 2024, up from S$448 from 2008 to 2019. The average daily rate also rose from S$513 to S$645, even as occupancy dipped from 87.3 per cent to 86.4 per cent.\n> \n> ‚ÄúOver the years, the Singapore Grand Prix has consistently driven strong hotel performance,‚Äù says a CoStar spokesperson, in response to queries from BT. ‚ÄúF1 remains a very popular event for inbound travellers.‚Äù\n\n[...]\n\n> Dr Chadwick also sees Singapore‚Äôs race as ‚Äúintegral to the national sport strategy‚Äù of the country. He describes the four Gulf night events as ‚Äútrinkets‚Äù in comparison, noting that their circuits and races do not integrate into the city the way Singapore‚Äôs does, particularly in terms of transportation.\n\n[...]\n\n> (Saunders) notes that the Singapore race has always felt ‚Äúahead of its time‚Äù in terms of successfully drawing a younger and diverse demographic that Liberty has been pursuing since its takeover of F1 in 2017.\n\n[...]\n\n> Saunders believes that given the race‚Äôs success, both Singapore and F1 will likely be keen to renew their deal. Miami has already signed a 16-year contract extension ‚Äì a sign, he suggests, of what may lie ahead for Singapore.', ""Singapore is overhated.\n\nThe 2022 and 2023 races were both bangers, and that wasn't the first time this race has been good, either."", ""The issue with Singapore isn't the night race, but rather the quality of the actual race.

Granted, there‚Äôs an unknown as to what will actually happen next season but I am hopeful for Cadillac to do well for a first-year team. \n\nI also am praying that Lockheed Martin becomes the title sponsor as I personally think it would be hilarious to have the ‚ÄúLockheed Martin Cadillac F1 Team‚Äù on the grid next year.', 'by intentionally crashing into people in the sim?', 'It will be hard for them to do as well as Haas did in 2016. They buy less stuff from Ferrari, and they are joining for a new regulation. Haas could sort of ""copy"" the others homework when they joined. Cadillac will be going into this completely blind with 0 idea about what works.', 'Skunk Works Cadillac F1 Team would be pretty cool too. Idk if they can use that name tho.', ""> This could be my American hopium, but GM has seemingly been investing more into the start of Cadillac F1 than Haas did when they started and it gets me excited.\n\nThe problem is Haas could essentially copy a lot of the Ferrari to the point where they were faster than multiple existing teams. \n\nCadillac aren't allowed to do that and it isn't their goal long term to be a customer team.\n\nIt should also be noted that the field of 2026 will be much, much stronger than the field of 2016 and with the budget cap they can't just throw money at it which both make it harder to be competitive immediately.\n\n\nEven if you just read between the lines from Lowden it's all about earning respect and building something as opposed to being competitive which tells you they know they'll be last.\n\nI think Cadillac will struggle a lot next year unless they have a clear PU advantage over another team. They'll probably in the region of 3 seconds off the pace and have a season like Williams in 2019 (again uless they have a clear PU advantage over someone else, in which case it's free lap time and will compensate)."", ""Haas managed to be as competitive as they were straight up because they cheaped out.\n\nThey spent next to no money on setting up any infrastructure or expertise and just outsourced everything they could.\n\nThey still don't build their own chassis, Dallara still build and do a considerable ammount of design work for Haas. They bought everything they physically could (including trucks) from Ferrari, took Ferrari staff on secondment and even have an office inside Maranello.\n\nThey have now added Toyota to their list of companies doing their job for them.\n\nCadillac are actually trying to be an F1 manufacturer doing this stuff for themselves, it is A LOT harder. Expect them to be seconds off the pace in year 1 but make rapid progress."", 'I understood this reference.', ""Initially Haas was building a HQ in Kannapolis, North Carolina, to have their F1 team based in the US and making almost everything inhouse. Then they got a deal with Ferrari to buy most parts from them, having a (small) department at Maranello and Dallara building the chassis. They only thing they made in the US were the some specific bolts and screws for their cars.\n\nNow they have 3 locations, in the US, UK (f1 team base) and Italy.\n\nSource: Ziggo Sport got a tour from Guenther Steiner when a few years back. I can't find the video and not sure if it's geoblocked or not.\n\n  \nFrom what I understood Cadillac will have eventually 2 US bases and 1 location in Silverstone, UK. For now the latter will be used as their HQ for their F1 team, but they want to move it to the US when their new facility their is finished in the future."", 'Haas intended to run many more things in the US at first. They have a very nice facility in North Carolina for NASCAR which now is mostly closed sadly but the F1 offices are still there along with a smaller NASCAR operation.  Part of their original application was their wind tunnel in NC. The FIA continued to push on them using their own wind tunnel all the way into the start of 2016. What happened was Ferrari offered them a massively favorable deal on everything and then when they started well, it never actually made sense to throw away what they had and build up their facilities for F1. The costs for that would be high, the wind tunnel they have for instance is full size. Too big for F1 regulations. It was going to require them to buy a module they could slide into it to downsize it just for F1. Once they were set up with Ferrari, why do any of that? Once the FIA accepted things, i think those doors closed.', ""I don't believe there is any plans to move the build and running of the cars to the states, doesn't make sense to do that.\n\nI believe US is gonna be design office and engine plant.""]",39,16,0.84,39,16,16,1,0,-0.020000000000000018,1
