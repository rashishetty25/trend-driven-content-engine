I got into F1 this year, courtesy of my friend, who has been a fan for longer. I got in right after Imola, so I didn't get to watch it (not yet anyway), but she caught me up on the basics. Monaco was the first race I'd ever watched, and my friend sincerely apologized (lol) because she said that the race wasn't a great introduction at all. Looking back after a few months of getting to know the sport more, I do agree that she was right. I've been watching every race since then, and I honestly think all the races so far have been entertaining. But yeah, other than a few clips from races from earlier in the year and past years, I haven't watched any full races from before Monaco 2025.

This now brings me to my question: Could you maybe suggest races (starting from 2015 preferably, I've grown to like Max and want to start from there haha) that are actually worth watching in full and/or maybe have significance of some sort? Like staple races that you just *have* to see unfold. I'm still open to races before 2015 though, especially if it's very monumental for F1.  
  
I was initially planning on binging everything, but watching 10 years' worth of races might actually burn me out, and I'd never touch F1 again, haha. So, maybe fan-favorite races from 2015-2024? Let me know what I should watch to be cultured!","['Here are the 100 best races from 2008 to 2024 as rated by our readers:\n\n[The Top 100 F1 Races as rated by RaceFans readers](https://www.racefans.net/rate-the-race/top-100-f1-races/)', 'Brazil 2024 and Germany 2019 definitely\n\nI liked Imola and Silverstone 2024 too', 'Outside of your time limits but no F1 fan’s life should be complete without watching the full race from Spa (Belgium) 1998.

It was an insane gap. Yes the Merc was the best car but it wasn’t that much better than anyone else. It was pure Hamilton rainmeister magic.  \n\nThe only other driver that looked in Hamilton’s class that day was Max, who is also a GOAT tier driver, who spun at the second to last corner on his final lap trying to keep up and even then he was 0.7s down on Hamilton when he spun. \n\nHamilton was 35 at that point and although he still had plenty of good performances since it was the last real moment of super prime vintage Hamilton where it was so clear why he was the best driver of his era and had a level of speed very few others in F1 history can match.']",25,34,0.9,25,220,220,1,0,0.010000000000000009,1
