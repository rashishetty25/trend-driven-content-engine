And Hamilton does not feel heard**\n\nby Daniele Sparisci and Giorgio Terruzzi\n\n***The bad start to the season is leaving its mark on Ferrari: even Vasseur is at risk. And for the first time Leclerc is in doubt despite a long contract***\n\nTwo podiums in a row, and in Canada the chase for the third on the track named after Gilles Villeneuve begins. The revival yes, but the results are far from the initial objectives: a disappointment that is having profound effects. Several fronts have been opened at Ferrari, Fred Vasseur's actions put under scrutiny by top management, Hamilton's outbursts, and above all the doubts, really present for the first time in Leclerc's head.\n\nThe French boss has been asked to account for the unsatisfactory performance, his position is no longer so firm, he is accused of knowing little about the internal environment, and it is curious that this weekend the trajectory of his Ferrari crosses at a distance that of the other Rossa, driven by the man who could replace him: Antonello Coletta, head of endurance, engaged in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in a World Championship that began with three wins out of three. In the past, the Roman manager had been consulted to lead F1, but had politely declined, and he reiterated this again recently, aware of the enormous difference between the two racing worlds. Now that he has won everything it would be harder to back out. His name (together with that of Horner, an old favourite of Elkann, who was visiting Juve yesterday) is at the top of the list if Vasseur were to part company.\n\nBehind the team principal's case is the disquiet of the drivers, Leclerc meanwhile. From his inner circle someone has let slip questions about the contract that binds him to Maranello until 2029, when he will be 31. A definitive marriage, characterised by continuous declarations of love. But his confidence no longer seems total, he is experiencing cyclical crises and it will not have escaped his notice that Piastri in one year, since McLaren returned to the top, has won almost as much as him in 7 seasons in red.\n\nNothing is set in stone, but the simple fact that he can look around without ruling out a move to another team (there are exit clauses in the agreement) seems related to the opportunities offered by 2026. His fear is to find himself in a struggling Rossa even in the new rule cycle. Mercedes, on the other hand, is credited with a technical advantage thanks to its engine. It has not yet renewed Russell's contract, it has pursued Verstappen but it is likely that Max will stay with Red Bull next year to choose who to settle with in 2027, unless he really decides to take a break, which only he could afford. Charles has also always been held in high esteem by Toto Wolff. Then there is Aston Martin in the midst of a revival with Adrian Newey but it would be a high-risk bet.\n\nFinally Hamilton: his entry has not produced the hoped-for effects, but it has increased the value of Leclerc, who is now not only very fast, but also a beacon on the track after silently putting up with talk of how much he could have learned from Lewis. Who in turn is in crisis. On the one hand he honestly admits his difficulties, on the other he suffers from a complicated relationship. As the GPs go by, there is a feeling that he is not being listened to or followed enough by the team. Which raises a whole series of questions since his signing was supported by reasons that go beyond competitive performance, just think of the enormous return in image that the whole of F1 initially benefited from. Distant memories, it was the Winter World Cup.\n\n12 June 2025"", ""What a beautifully united and healthy team environment where the higher ups use their influence over Italian media outlets to smear their employees publicly as a pressure campaign.

Brazilian driver was the victim of a crime while having dinner in Zurich, Switzerland.

Gabriel Bortoleto arrived in Montreal for the Canadian Grand Prix after dealing with some issues in recent days. The Sauber driver was the target of a theft in Switzerland, where the team’s headquarters is located, and ended up without his passport.

The information was first reported by Band. Bortoleto’s car was broken into while he was having dinner in Zurich during the week. Some of his belongings and documents were taken, but he managed to recover most of what had been stolen.

The driver had to quickly replace his documents and traveled to Canada using a second passport. Despite the setbacks, he made it in time to take part in the official Canadian GP schedule, including interviews this Thursday (12th).

“I had gone out to dinner one night in Switzerland, and someone broke into the car and took my backpack. I had my passports in there, my laptop, all my racing gear,” Bortoleto told reporter Mariana Becker.

“It was chaos, but we managed to find the guy. Everything worked out in the end—I have my passports back. We didn’t recover everything, but we did get some of it,” he added.

Gabriel Bortoleto is currently 19th in the Drivers’ Championship and has yet to score points. He finished 12th in the Spanish GP.

There is no apparent footage of this, but in the Canada Drivers Press conference he admitted he was annoyed and frustrated. Did not comment on whether he got physical and hit anything.  Lance said he wants to keep his medial private- totally fine too IMO. Except sky sports asked him which wrist and further mentioned he (Crofty) noticed he had not taken his right hand out of his jacket pocket. Walked in with it in his pocket and he never took it out. Lance looked a little surprised to be called out like that, but confirmed it was his right hand. He was never asked to pull it out and he never did pull it out of his jacket pocket. It was very odd. Lance says he’s fine now and has no wrist pain, but is not using his arm /wrist and hand and keeping it hidden. How is he going to do FP1?  Do you think he’s going to bail after qualifying again just to keep a reserve driver from getting in his car while he heals? What’s he afraid of?  It’s not like his dad is going to replace him. He literally spends his time visually acting and behaving like he has not a care in the world about racing. Second point- he was also (during the same driver press conference) overly sweaty.

Is Vasseur also under scrutiny?**\n\n***The Scuderia's results are not in line with expectations: McLaren is far behind and the promised developments are slow in coming. In Maranello they are looking for engineers of weight to shake up the Racing Department, but the silence of the top management suggests that even the renewal of Vasseur, who expires at the end of the year, may be in doubt.***\n\nFranco Nugnes\n\n12 Jun 2025, 12:25am\n\nFerrari is on the market: it is looking for engineers, and more, who can give consistency to the team, even if the trend that emerges is that the engineers contacted do not want to come to Maranello. A bad sign that makes it terribly difficult to strengthen a structure that, unfortunately, is showing too many cracks.\n\nThe concern is not so much about the overhaul of the SF-25 (the updates have been decided and will be seen before the summer break: a new underbody and the infamous rear suspension are expected), as it is about the birth of the 678, the red car that should bring the Cavallino into the new regulatory era of agile single-seaters.\n\nEvery bolt will be completely new: chassis, power unit, tyres, aerodynamics will have little that can be reproduced with today, because F1 will change face by pursuing a technological challenge that raises the bar considerably, opting for a 50% electric and 50% endothermic power unit. A pioneering choice that will put some of the Constructors in difficulty: paddock rumours once again give Mercedes ahead of the rest of the competition and, if that were the case, Ferrari would already be chasing the Star as it did in 2014 at the birth of the hybrid era.\n\nJohn Elkann and Benedetto Vigna had believed in Fred Vasseur's project: to return to winning the world championship in the last year of the ground effect single-seaters, before starting the new regulatory cycle. The 2025 season is proving to be a disaster: the SF-25 was born badly, but above all it cannot keep up with the pace of the competition's updates. This red car, completely redesigned from the SF-24, was supposed to offer the aerodynamicists development options that did not materialise. The objectives sought, therefore, have failed miserably. McLaren has a clear advantage: we are talking about almost four tenths per lap, an enormity that will not be made up between now and the end of the year.\n\nThe question to ask, therefore, is another: is this team sufficient to meet the 2026 challenges? Loic Serra is an excellent engineer: he arrived from Mercedes (where he was missed) to take on the role of technical director. A position he had never held and which Vasseur entrusted to him. It is one thing to follow a project and another to manage a technical department. The Frenchman does not have the necessary charisma to drag the team along. After Imola, the top management had asked for an acceleration in the arrival of the novelties: the coup de reniere did not take place, hoping in the meantime that the change in the rules on wing flexibility would play in Maranello's favour: with more rigid profiles there were those who hoped to bring the single-seater papayas closer. An illusion cradled for a long time in the GeS that Barcelona has peremptorily cancelled. This, then, looks like a Ferrari with blunt nails.\n\nIs the problem only of a technical nature or are the causes to be sought deeper down? Is it surprising that Vasseur's contract expires at the end of 2025, closing the three-year cycle, and that for such a strategic role for the future, there has not yet been a renewal discussion, giving stability to the team? It may be that the negotiations are being conducted in absolute silence, but the feeling of several observers is that for Fred a moment of ‘great coldness’ on the part of the ownership has begun, a situation similar to that which accompanied the exit of Mattia Binotto. The team principal is stubbornly chasing a potential from the car that has so far not been seen, while Lewis Hamilton, for example, advises to forget about 2025 in order to devote all energy to next year."", ""Unless they have reason to believe that his development of the 2026 car is already a disaster, then firing him would be the dumbest decision they can make \n\nThey brought him in at the end of a cycle and won't even give him a chance for a new one?"", ""Replacing Vasseur isn't going to change anything.

We\'ve gone in search of clues.**\n\n> The numbers speak for themselves. McLaren has won seven of the nine Grands Prix, three of them doubles. Oscar Piastri has taken pole position four times, Lando Norris twice. Seven of the nine fastest laps were set by one of the two McLaren drivers, who now hold a fairly comfortable one-two lead in the World Championship. Only Max Verstappen still has some visual contact.\n\n> The clearest evidence of the British racing team\'s superiority is the points tally in the overall constructors\' standings. McLaren has already collected 362 points, an average of 40.2. 43 points is the maximum for a weekend without a sprint. If things continue in this vein, McLaren will end up with more points than Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull combined.\n\n> So far, only Max Verstappen has coaxed the new power in Formula 1 out of its shell. This always happens where the corners are fast, the asphalt is smooth, and tire wear is minimal. So far, this has only been the case in Suzuka, Jeddah, and Imola.\n\n> **Dominance difficult to grasp.**\nEverywhere else, the McLarens are practically unbeatable. This isn\'t as noticeable as Verstappen\'s one-man show in 2023, though, because the gaps in qualifying are relatively small. In Q1, the 20 drivers are often separated by just a second. McLaren usually only shows its strength on Sunday. And then only subtly, because Piastri and Norris only do the bare minimum when they\'re in front. If necessary, they can increase the pace from one lap to the next at the push of a button.\n\n> It\'s a kind of dominance that\'s hard to grasp. The competition has a hard time getting to the bottom of the Papaya racers\' secret, because they have no clear strengths or weaknesses. They\'re not outstanding in any one area, but they\'re good everywhere. They handle fast corners just as well as slow ones, gaining no more on the brakes than at the apex or during acceleration. If anything stands out at all, it\'s the poor top speed. But there are reasons for this.\n\n> The most striking feature is how the McLarens manage their tires. They are the only cars that use the softest compound tire for the entire qualifying lap. The others have to decide whether to push hard in the first sector and lose grip in the last, or to hold back at the beginning of the lap to keep the tires within the temperature window until the final sector. Verstappen opted for the latter in Barcelona. He lost 0.195 seconds to Piastri in the first sector, 0.124 seconds in the second, but only gained 0.027 seconds by the end of the lap.\n\n> **Tire puzzle still not solved.**\nThis behavior is even more blatant in the race. The competition loses grip after a few laps because the tires overheat. At McLaren, the temperature remains stable. And this isn\'t just because the McLaren drivers at the front mostly drive in clean air. The car harbors many little secrets that are difficult to decipher. The flexible wings, front and rear, were not one of them. McLaren survived both testing intensifications unscathed. Max Verstappen commented almost resignedly: ""A good car is still a good car.""\n\n> Since summer 2023, McLaren has been building a car that has been optimized from nose to rear wing over a development cycle that includes six major upgrades and numerous detailed changes. Engineers Rob Marshall and Peter Prodromou have found the precise level of downforce at which downforce is just barely stable. Unlike its rivals, McLaren has expanded the window of ride heights at which the MCL39 delivers predictable downforce – for both slow and fast corners.\n\n> The front wing, the geometry of the front axle, its wishbones, and the Venturi ducts at the front are a combination that places the center of downforce centrally, precisely where the driver sits and the car touches down. This is why the McLaren has its own cooling circuit for the cockpit. Special fluid circulates through a system of cooling ducts. The underbody edges, sidepods, and rear brake vents are designed to create air vortices that effectively seal the gap between the diffuser and the rear wheels.\n\n> **Why do the rear wheels stay off?**\nThe cooling of the entire vehicle has been improved, eliminating the need for airflow-restricting exhaust gills in the fairing. The entire car radiates less heat, which also benefits the tires. The air duct between the two brake drums is designed to shield the brake heat from a certain point against the inner wall of the rim.\n\n> It\'s unknown whether low-phase-change metals are used as heat shields. McLaren hasn\'t commented on the matter. McLaren accepts that the high cost of cooling all the car\'s components results in increased drag. Those driving at the front can forgo top speed.\n\n> Also unexplained is why McLaren always pushes the limits in the essentially meaningless third practice session, shocking their opponents with fabulous times. Or why the mechanics line up in front of the car to shield them from view while they work on the brake vents. Or why the cars on the starting grid are the only ones lined up bare at the rear. The rear wheels are always fitted at the last minute. The competition still has a few mysteries to solve.', 'So is the article just: ""there are secrets that teams are still puzzled by""?\n\nYeah bro we knew, could you be more precise tho', ""What I'm more curious about is why their engine is unlike that of Merc or Aston?"", 'How much do you think the recently hired Redbull staff Rob Marshall had input in the current MCL-39? Was his input a key to their success?', ""I think these regulations more than previous ones reward superior knowledge of how the car functions as opposed to raw performance numbers. It's a big part of why Mercedes came unstuck because they chased numbers and looked for silver bullets when the numbers didn't equate to performance on track.\n\nIn the previous regs you could very much brute force more downforce and better drag efficiency and make your car faster, which when combined with unlimited resources and the most powerful engine made it very easy for Mercedes to waltz to championships every year. Now you can make the numbers better but it means nothing when the car is sensitive and can't use it most of the time and then you don't have the resources to really go into depth into finding out why.\n\nI think it's clear McLaren have a deeper understanding of operating windows, tyre behaviour and how the car behaves in general in a very natural and innate way and that isn't going to change this year, but fortunately for the rest of the grid, it probably wont be so important next year."", ""The most depressing thing for non McLaren or neutral fans is that even if teams know what and how McLaren is doing what they are doing, it probably would require some fundamental changes that can't be done mid season. Meaning that even if teams wanted to keep developing 2025 cars in order to try and get the title (Red Bull) there is just not enough performance to be found."", 'Thank you for your service.', 'Must be the water (in the veins)']",37,29,0.75,37,213,213,6,0,0.020000000000000018,6

The only permitted type of tyre heating devices are blankets that comply with the design prescriptions listed in Article C10.8.4.\n\n>e. Any other device, system or procedure (except for driving of the car) the purpose and/or effect of which is to heat, or maintain the temperature of the hubs, or brakes, above the ambient air temperature, or to maintain their temperature if they are already warm, is prohibited.”\n\n>This has led teams to suggest that this could lead, and has led, teams to exploit this, and at a meeting of the World Motorsport Council, the FIA decided to rewrite this section.\n\n>It now reads: d. “The only permitted type of tyre heating devices are blankets that comply with the design prescriptions listed in Article C10.8.4.\n\n>e. With the exception of air entering through the apertures defined in C3.16.6 and C3.16.16, and the blankets permitted in (d) above.
