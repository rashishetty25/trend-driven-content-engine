Kinda wish they switched earlier then.', 'Tldr: Gasly 0.375 seconds off pole despite engine deficit of 3 tenths.', 'Alpine ""not tractor"" status confirmed?', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Finally, Alpine has delivered, just as the test drives had promised. Pierre Gasly starts fifth in the Bahrain GP and lost only 0.375 seconds to pole position. Despite an engine handcap of three tenths.**\n\n> It’s a round birthday. Alpine chief renovator Flavio Briatore was 75 years old on the day of qualifying for the Bahrain GP. When Pierre congratulated Gasly in the morning, the eternally young Italian asked: “And, what did you bring me as a birthday present?” Gasly pointed to his right foot. A heavy gas foot should straighten it.\n\n> Alpine had arrived with zero points for the fourth round of the World Championship. The only team was still empty, and the French cars had left a very good impression during the winter test drives in Bahrain. But it seemed to be swept away in Melbourne, Shanghai and Suzuka.\n\n> Briatore stood in front of his troop: “We were not as bad as we looked. Our problem was that we never got what was theoretically possible out of the softest tire compound.” This resulted in poor starting positions and correspondingly difficult races. The team did not travel to Bahrain with a single point. This is not the claim that Alpine had before the 2025 Formula 1 season. They wanted to be “Best Of The Rest” and annoy the top teams McLaren, Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes.\n\n> **Engine costs lap time.**\nThe Renault engine is not a rocket with which you can win places. “We lose three to four tenths of the drive alone, depending on the route,” Briatore curses. It’s the old problem. The engine has to be into charging mode too early on the straights to fill the battery. For Bahrain, the loss according to the simulation is 0.3 seconds.\n\n> And yet, with 1.30.216 minutes, Gasly managed a time that was only 0.375 seconds above Oscar Piastri’s pole position. “Without the loss of the engine, we start from the front row,” Briatore is convinced. Gasly impressed especially in the second sector, where he was practically as fast as the McLaren drivers. It is the sector with the most curves in which time goes flutes. This is shown to the engineers: The car is aerodynamically healthy.\n\n> It could have gone better in the first three races, Briatore is annoyed. The error was that the engineers had tried to compensate for the power deficit elsewhere. For example, with the differential setting. “The experiments didn’t help,” says the master craftsman. “That’s why I told the team before the weekend: no more experiments. We’re driving like in the test.”\n\n> **Grace period for Doohan.**\nThe Alpine also kept its tyre temperatures in the window for the entire lap. Pierre Gasly and Jack Doohan did not lose a disproportionate amount of time in the last stretch, unlike some competitors. The fact that Gasly also took sixth place in the third training session in shearing heat is a good sign. Even there, the tire temperatures did not shoot through the ceiling.\n\n> Jack Doohan was also on his way to Q3. The Australian came in sixth place through Q1 and had a good chance of getting one lap further even after the first attempt in Q2. But then, in the last attempt, Doohan no longer brought all sectors together optimally. “He still has to work on that,” the team said. “Jack is fast, but not yet constant.” According to recent information, despite his two accidents in Melbourne and Japan, he still has a grace period until summer.', '“What did you bring me as a birthday present” and Gasly gives him a second row. He’ll be happy!', 'Would Ferrari go for gasly when Lewis retires?

Thus, PIA gets a better exit, and builds more speed through the T2&3 combination. When coming to T4, PIA lifts earlier and more gradual, coming to 0% at nearly the same point as NOR, who, brakes earlier and longer. Coming at nearly the same speed to the S-Combination of T5/6/7. Before T6, PIA brakes earlier, allowing for a better exit and not having to lift-off as much as NOR through T7. Approach to T8 is nigh identical, but PIA was earlier back on the throttle and NOR had to feather for a moment, costing him a bit of speed. Coming to the Tilke-Special of T9/10, NOR lifts later again and PIA brakes later, again. PIA gets a slightly better exit, capping at a higher top speed before T11. There, PIA lifts later, which lets NOR have a better exit and gaining back a bit on PIA. But T13: PIA lifts and brakes later, carrying more speed into the corner and having a slightly worse exit as NOR. T14 doesn't shake anything up, yet again, PIA lifts way earlier and more gradual than NOR, who is also braking earlier and longer.

Conclusion: Difficult. Their respective car control is remarkably similar. PIA brakes later and finds better exits, having overall a bit more confidence in the car. The approaches to T4 and T14 are quite extreme, with PIA starting to lift-off 90 and 60 metres, respectively, earlier than NOR (if the data of FastF1 is to be trusted). My guess: After seeing the live delta to PIA on his dash after T3, NOR went all in, staying on the throttle longer than usual, thus paying with worse exits, which cost him even more time. And if I may delve into the crystal ball: NOR was standing in his own way, starting to drive with a clenched jaw upon glancing at the live delta inbetween T3&4. Probably cost him the front row.","['Oh my days. Actual analysis instead of “mentality” talk.

It pretty much tracks with their statement to the press for the past two weeks or so. This only exacerbates my feelings that the expectations floating amongst viewers have unrealistically increased. This is in no way diminishing the returns provided by other drivers, but domination streaks have negatively warped people's perceptions on what a successful season trajectory can look like"", ""It's interesting that Norris apparently now struggles with the car whereas Oscar seems more comfortable, even if not fully from what Stella said.\n\nNgl, I'd find it kind of funny if norris, who beat ric because he could adapt better to the weird behavior and feedback of past mclarens, ended up losing to Oscar because the changes that finally turned the car into a title contender also had for consequence to make it more difficult for norris to extract its full potential."", ""For sure Piastri is quicker than Norris now and was also the case in China. Norris is up and coming and has an incredible car and teammate in Piastri.

I had a look at the history of safety cars in Bahrain. I didn't investigate why the data is so skewed, but we hardly saw the safety car for over a decade, and have seen it almost every year since 2017, including three times in each of the COVID double-headers here. 

Going by the most recent data, we will most likely see one, either late or early. If degradation is high enough for 2 stops, and there's a late safety car neutralising the field on equal tyres, the McLarens might be in trouble. 

Of course historical data is not predictive, but is this a risk, and is it one they needed to take?

It will be the first proper race with easy overtaking, and with Oscar/Charles/George staring top 3 and Gasly P4(!!!!) it will be really interesting. Kimi has a shot at his first podium as well.
