mistakes and victories and defeats are part and parcel of any sport, and just because of that doesnt mean we need to stick it up someones arse for winning, loosing, letting out a few rude words against competition in the heat of the moment. it's turning into the new ""IS THIS SUPERHERO STRONGER THAN THIS SUPERHERO"", because it's stopped becoming meaningful and started becoming pointless. sometimes stay respectful when you're talking about millionaires, even as stupid as that sounds, human decency isnt stupid. hope this post doesnt get downvoted and acts as a intervention for many passionate fans who do get unruly sometimes. we got to respect the sport and the people who make up the sport- lando, lance, lewis, max, fernando. they're all putting their time, effort, money and life into something we too enjoy, so lets try not to beat them down on it

if this reaches a wide enough audience, we may be able to hear less of atheletes like stroll behaving differently in media because of us- lando being emotional or apologising in the heat of moments because of us- drivers facing abelist and racist slurs because of us. we as a community have a large impact and we act together as one, so try to behave lads, its a sport, one that the drivers should enjoy as much as we do.","[""Honestly, I've spent the vast majority of my adult life since Coulthard and Webber retired NOT having a favourite driver or any particular team or driver I have wanted to win the most.
