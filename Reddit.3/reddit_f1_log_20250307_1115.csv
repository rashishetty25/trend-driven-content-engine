1j4trr4,The 'risky' McLaren F1 2025 choice that caught Red Bull's eye,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j4trr4/the_risky_mclaren_f1_2025_choice_that_caught_red/,2025-03-06, News,,"['Well this explains one reason for their improved slow corner performance compared to last year, at least during preseason testing. The front suspension of an F1 car is designed to keep the car stable under braking. One way teams achieve this is by using an “anti-dive” suspension layout (like in the MCL39), which reduces how much the car’s nose dips forward during braking. But this design choice comes with a trade-off. In a normal suspension setup, the forces from braking and cornering are spread out more evenly across the suspension components. Whereas with an anti-dive layout, certain parts of the suspension (higher-up) take on much greater forces because they are working harder to resist that forward movement of the car. This puts more stress on the components and the only way to make this design reliable is to use stronger materials potentially making it a bulkier setup.', '> In fact, Red Bull technical director Pierre Wache made an eyebrow-raising observation in Bahrain - in suggesting that McLaren may have taken a bit of a gamble with its front suspension.\n\n> Speaking to The Race, Wache said: “The suspension of the McLaren is very interesting – in terms of kinematics. And one aspect is the anti-dive. It is very high.\n\n> ""It is quite a risky kinematic for me. If they can make it work, it will be interesting.”\n\n> Asked what he meant by it being risky, Wache said: “In terms of the load on the suspension legs and everything.”\n\nThe Race then proceeds to explain what Pierre means in detail, key takeaway:\n\n> And it is this layout that Wache thinks could pose some risks – with the anti-dive layout perhaps exposing the individual suspension components to much greater structural forces than a more normal suspension layout would have.\n\n> This could pose headaches in terms of opening up potential reliability problems, but also perhaps require compromises in needing to bulk up individual components to make sure they are strong enough. That has weight consequences.', ""The question of suspension kinematics has something to do with structural integrity, but the biggest concern is driver feedback, wasn't it?"", 'So.... Something something car loses front wheels at the end of straight....\n\nPierre knows something about that I think.', 'I suppose I would trust the McLaren engineers who designed it and presumably tested it, over the Red Bull ones who simply got to look at it, but… we will see how it works out! The McLaren looked lightning fast in testing, hopefully reliability doesn’t take a step back.', 'That MCL38 vs MCL39 dissected comparison would make an amazing interactive compare view thing where you have the slider to drag back and forth over the car. Love the art they do every time.', 'Ngl the angle of that drawing makes it look like a tractor.', ""If there's one team I'd put my money on understanding composites and their ability to take dynamic forces well, it would be the team that introduced the first carbon fiber F1 chassis and 'mini-DRS'. Even if it's risky, you don't win in F1 by playing safe."", 'I feel like all of these suspension changes are to keep the ride height as predictable as possible. As soon as the floor gets out of whack that’s when you see all of the handling issues. I’d assume if you can keep the front of the car more level. You will generate more consistent downforce from the floor so whatever you lose by the aggressive anti-dive you benefit from the floor. Time will tell for sure.']",1300,89,0.98,1300,2119,2119,3,0,0.0,3

In addition, the new regulations stipulate that the two official drivers can complete a maximum of 1,000 kilometers accumulated in four days of testing, while the rest of the days can be taken advantage of with reserve or dedicated simulator drivers.\n\nFor Zhou, who was previously part of the Ferrari Driver Academy from 2014 to 2018 before following a different path, this is an opportunity to accumulate kilometers in preparation for the work he will have to do in the simulator during the season. The Chinese driver has taken part in 3 seasons in F1 with Sauber, the last of which was completed last year: for the Rossa it represents a good solution to have a driver with some experience behind the scenes on the ground effect cars, while for Zhou it is a chance to remain linked to the paddock of the top series, which he did not want to leave despite offers from other categories.\n\nAlong with Zhou, Antonio Fuoco has also been running, with the Italian driver remaining active on the Cavallino simulator on the F1 front as well because of his qualities and experience, complementing his activities behind the wheel of the 499P Hypercar in the WEC, where he recently scored a splendid victory in the season's opening round in Qatar."", 'Zhou finally driving the real Ferrari.

First two episodes are quite good even if the focus of the first one is largely off track and Horner's issues. Probably no point in worrying about spoilers as we all know how the season went.

Having discussed everything to do with 2024 during the break, I'm now waiting for 2025. If DTS was aired during January or early February when nothing is happening in F1 and before most of the usual car launches and testing I'd probably be more interested.

They\'re obviously limited by what footage they were able to get (they can\'t be in every garage every race), but I do like seeing them cover a major story of the season with extra bts footage. Well, as long as they don\'t totally abandon reality again. Which since a bunch of drivers threatened to refuse to appear on the show, dts have been better at. So I\'m optimistic.\n\nIt\'s like, I get that they\'re a docudrama rather than a documentary. I get that their target audience are potential f1 fans, not established f1 fans. I get that their job is to portray the drama and spectacle of f1 in an easy to digest way, not give us Season in Review. And a lot of the time I do feel they do a good job. \n\nBut as a long time fan of f1 I\'d like dts to more consistently show bts footage and expand on the events I watched on track.

Most boil down to either ""yes, I watched this happen but with less dramatic music"" or ""yeah that didn\'t happen like that, you\'re grasping here Netflix"".

Aside from the performance the hybrids are capable of, the biggest, most advanced series in Motorsport isn’t the place for technology everyone else has already moved on from.\nLooking into the future, there won’t be a car industry without EVs and hybrids. Even today barely anyone bothers to build anything bigger than a V8, so a series with V10 engines would be nothing more than a fun playground for people with money to burn.\nI know there is debate about how much “road relevancy” there is in F1 development, but in any case, none of the big car manufacturers are going to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on prestige Motorsport development for V10 engines, when all their other business is in smaller hybrids and EVs. It doesn’t make sense, and it’s not where the best and brightest minds in engineering want to go either. We have to keep in mind that F1 is the way it is, in part because it offers people the opportunity to work on cutting edge car technology, developing engines, batteries, etc. that are beyond what’s currently out there. These traditional engines are technologically less interesting to many of the people that will have to build them.\nIt’s really quite obvious when you listen to people who work with these cars, and it’s no surprise basically none of the proponents of going back to V10s are part of the technical community of F1.
