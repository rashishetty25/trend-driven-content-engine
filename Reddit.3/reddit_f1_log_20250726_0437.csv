1m8y3k9,[AMuS] Verstappen is commited to stay at Red Bull for 2026. But Red Bull agreed to let him go for 2027 in case he wants to leave the team,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m8y3k9/amus_verstappen_is_commited_to_stay_at_red_bull/,2025-07-25, News,,"['Great, now what are we gonna talk about over the summer break?', 'Would be interesting if George and Kimi only get 1 year contract extensions', 'This seems like a fairly smart move by Max. He might forfeit the chance at a 2026 title should Merc be capable of it, but he also eliminates the risk of being locked into a bad situation, be that Merc underperforming or committing to Red Bull only for their works engine to flop. \n\nAlso helps Merc avoid paying an enormous sum to buy him out right now.', 'This doesn’t fit my narrative', 'Google Translation \n\n> The Verstappen mystery is beginning to unravel. For months, the industry has been puzzling over whether the Dutchman will stay at Red Bull or join Mercedes. After Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff and Verstappen met during the break following the Silverstone race in Sardinia, rumors of a transfer were reignited.\n\n> The much-quoted exit clause will come into effect after the Belgian GP. According to this clause, Verstappen could leave if he finishes worse than third in the World Championship. With an 18-point lead over fourth-placed George Russell, this is rather unlikely, despite the points inflation on a sprint weekend.\n\n> It has since leaked out that Verstappen will stay with Red Bull in 2026. He still describes the team as his second family. And from his perspective, it\'s not about exit clauses or personnel matters, but about the team proving to him that it can build a competitive car. ""The last year and a half haven\'t been so good. Now we\'re looking ahead. We have to work on the car and improve it for this year, but also for next season.""\n\n> With this, the world champion is already confirming between the lines that he will definitely stay with Red Bull for another year. The defending champion\'s camp has realized that a hasty move will create more problems than it solves. As of today, no one can reliably predict who will have a good or bad chance next year. A fellow driver says: ""If you\'re going to make a mistake, it\'s better to do it with the team you\'re with. In 2026, you\'ll be able to make a much better choice with more knowledge.""\n\n> Verstappen would have to commit to Mercedes or another team long-term. Anyone who moves now can\'t immediately turn around a year later. At Red Bull, he would effectively be free at the end of 2026. Then the cockpits at Ferrari, Aston Martin, and Mercedes will also be filled.\n\n> Verstappen could, of course, continue driving for Red Bull if the team succeeds in challenging for victories, even under the new regulations. Verstappen\'s management has demanded this freedom. Team boss Christian Horner refused to accept it. This is said to have been the final piece of the puzzle for his disempowerment.\n\n> It would also be interesting to see what happens if Verstappen, contrary to expectations, slips to fourth place after the Belgian GP. Then Toto Wolff will have to consider the Verstappen option again.\n\n> In that case, Andrea Kimi Antonelli would probably have to leave and be parked at another Mercedes team. This is how one should interpret the statements of George Russell, who emphasized again in Spa: ""If you look at the facts, Mercedes can\'t get ahead of me.""\n\n> George Russell could live with Verstappen, even if the two drivers aren\'t best friends. ""I have respect, but I\'m not afraid of Max."" For Mercedes, it would be a fine line to form the two very different superstars into one team. That would almost be on the scale of what happened with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren. This speculation may already be history after the Belgian weekend. Then Mercedes will tell its drivers the truth.', 'There are so many conflicting reports about Verstappen’s contract and plans. Every story seems to be claiming something different\n\nI’m just waiting for August when Mercedes announce either a Russell contract extension or that they’ve signed Max. I honestly don’t think the people writing these articles know much more than the rest of us', ""Whichever team is quickest in 2026, that's where he'll go. Gambling on who'll rein in the new car at this point would be foolish. Prove it on the track and Max will come calling."", 'Plot twist: both Red Bull and Mercedes get fucked up by the rule changes', 'I think the speculation will continue until Mercedes or Red Bull make formal announcements', 'Now he gets to see how Mercedes, Aston Martin and Ferrari perform next year.']",3356,306,0.98,3356,6180,6180,60,3,0.0,60

He’s saying that he’s not humiliating George, because George is the one who made it public, and that George publicized it because he wanted the narrative to be “Merc respects me enough not to flirt without telling me first.” (Obviously, because the actual newsy part of that story is not “Merc is keeping George in the loop” but “there is something for Merc to keep George in the loop about”, this did not work.)\n\nAbsolutely loved Toto saying that Max and George would be a Prost-Senna lineup. We can only dream.', 'Interesting that Toto blames George for making the negotiations public. I get why George would want to create the narrative if it was going to come out anyway, but Max never said anything about negotiations of his own volition and I doubt Toto would have either. So he just increased the scrutiny on himself for no reason.\n\n>”I think he has now triggered the whole media avalanche. Sometimes I am naive but I try to be transparent with the drivers. I said to him: ‘I have the obligation of exploring what Max is going to do in the next two years’. He came out with it, wanting to show that ‘I am aware, nothing is behind my back, I’m alright with it’.”', ""“But obviously a Russell and Verstappen line-up?

One can only dream of what would have been if they had signed him for Mercedes at the time.', ""i think the most likely theory for Horner's depature is that the Thai side  have been wanting to sell for a while and tasked Horner with finding a loaded buyer, and if the sale went through, Horner would get a percentage stake as payment. Horner may have found an interested party and was slowly moving towards a deal but then the office scandal happened, so the Thais had no choice but to just side with Horner, but as the season progressed and the general slump of Red Bull performance probably gave the buying party cold feet so they backed out and thus Horner ended up getting the Red Bull treatment."", ""I'd be pretty upset if I was Russell, he has done everything right, he should be the team leader, he has proven himself and is a consistent performer.. he's no Verstappen but he's a high level driver, and when his teammate struggles to not DNF he should not be the one at risk."", ""It was interesting Russell said he only notices it on media day.

1m9gim9,[Miami GP] Has anyone been and can give me some insight about race weekend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m9gim9/miami_gp_has_anyone_been_and_can_give_me_some/,2025-07-26, Discussion,"I’m making it a goal to go to Miami for the 2026 race. This will be my first in person race weekend and I’m hoping someone can help me understand the city dynamic for the race.

1. I’m looking at the Kimpton up in Ft Lauderdale, am I right in thinking North -> South would be easier to navigate the masses? or is everything between South Beach and Ft L a zoo?

2. Brightline… it looks pretty viable. Knowing the massive influx of people, it’s it actually faster/better to just use public transport and the shuttle? I’m considering renting a car and paying for parking but I feel like i’ll sit in traffic longer than i’d sit on the train.

3. Turn 12 Beach grandstand or Turn 18? I’m taking my sister for her first race too and we’re going to be there all 3 days the entire day. Beach feels like the best ticket for a weekend experience, T18 for race day. Am i wrong?

4. Do’s and don’ts of Miami on race weekend?","['They sell a ticket that has a different section for each day. Highly recommend. \n\nIf you want same seats, Beach and Turn 18 are a tie. \n\nHave row 20 or higher anywhere to be in shade. \n\nPro Tip: If you uber to park and ride, it’s free.  Otherwise, driving and parking is no big deal. \n\nSource: I’ve been to every race in Miami.', 'r/grandprixtravel will probably be a more helpful place to ask', ""We stayed in a vacation rental for the race weekend, near the track. Traffic is a mess and you will not want to walk after being in the sun for a solid 8-9 hours if you stay for all of the sessions and the lower series, 3 days in a row. There were shuttle issues and confusion with them so beware of that. At least with the car, you got the aircon.\n\nDo bring hats, cooling towels, athletic wear so you can wick sweat and stay cool, stay hydrated, use the medical tents if needed as they have aircon too. Lots and lots of sunscreen.\n\nCan't really say which turn is best, both are right after DRS zones so should have good overtaking action."", 'The race isn’t in Miami, it’s in Miami Gardens, right on the border of basically Lauderdale, so stay up there. Brightline won’t take you anywhere near the race site, forget about that. Your best bet is the Hard Rock Hotel - they’ll have a shuttle. If you want to enjoy some actual beach on your trip too, look around FLL beach for options rather than Miami. Uber is your best bet for transportation, (public transport is awful). Be prepared for it to be very hot and humid. If you can get shady seats, do it - the sun is brutal. I live there and won’t go to that F1 race because of the time if year they have it.', 'beautiful response thank you. i’ve got some free nights and points racked up with IHG and can get the Kimpton for free 5 days during race weekend\n\nrenting a car and paying for premium lot parking worth it? any idea what that might cost?\n\nhydrate like it is my job heard \U0001fae1', 'the f1 miami site specifically says they run a shuttle on race weekend from Aventure to the Hard Rock stadium free of charge\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xCOyJMU\n\nPlan was the upper half of T12 or T18 to get the coverage', ""No way - Brightline has super efficient shuttles!! We parked at the Aventura station every day and hopped on the bus for free. You don't even need a Brightline ticket. Our first day there we parked in our assigned lot (granted, it was GA), walked to the stadium and took a pedicab back. It suuucked.\n\nDon't do that. Brightline all the way."", 'You mean Aventura? I mean ok, not much going on there but it’s fine, there’s a mall. Never spent any time there and wouldn’t really recommend it to anyone visiting but I’m sure it’s ok. The shuttle is nice to have but maybe look around for other areas/hotels before settling fir that?', 'yeah autocorrect got me\n\nthe goal would still be to stay up in Lauderdale or down on South Beach. I was just looking at possible transport options and saw brightline might be a decent shot - i snowboard a ton so hopping across public transport to get somewhere doesn’t bother me.']",7,12,0.64,7,9,9,3,0,0.030000000000000027,3
