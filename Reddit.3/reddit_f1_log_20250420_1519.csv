It shows how hard it might be for the McLarens to overtake here, as they have a below average speed in most sectors, except Oscar in Intermediate 1 and Lando at the finish line. Their overall maximum speed is below average for both drivers.

The second image is the same data and shows speed differential to the driver above them on the grid (Driver Ahead) for each sector and the speed trap, as well as where they sit within the field (Ave).

Oscar has no sectors in the green, which means his speeds are average or below average. Lando is solidly 14th in all sectors and the speed trap, apart from the finish line, where he is first.

Max and Yuki have all sectors in the green.

George only has one sector in the green, Intermediate  2 and Kimi is the same.

Charles has all sectors in the green, apart from the finish line. Lewis is green in all sectors, so it shows he is losing time in corners.

At no point on the track is Oscar faster than Max, though if he has DRS, it might change things.

For Lando, his maximum speed is slower than 7 of the 9 drivers ahead of him, with only Oscar and Kimi slower. As above, he is fastest at the finish line. In Intermediate 1, only Kimi is slower of those ahead of him, and in Intermediate 2, only Oscar is slower.

Hope you like this. Will be interesting to see if cornering speed and tyre management will be enough for McLaren to overcome their speed deficit.

He also spun off at Spa, his mediocre  performance in Argentina, and in France, where he let both Schumacher and Irvine through, after starting from pole, to finish 3rd in the race. But the most shocking thing for me was his advantage over DC, which really wasn't as big as I expected, because this is meant to be peak Mika Hakkinen.

Would not surprise me if he was reigned in last year given some of his articles were just anti Max rants, but unsure if his departure relates to this.

I know the Autosport/Motorsport business is/has been changing, and another reporter in Jon Noble recently moved on, so any insight would be great.

The outside shots looks ok, but the onboard shots look awful.

It looks like 360p video quality on YouTube.

It looks like the onboard cameras have very low resolution and bitrates from the artifacts. It should have at least a 1080p.

Ferrari was able to livestream an onboard shot at Le Mans WEC with better quality

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3XtGuEUb-k","['AV engineer here. You are comparing a trackside fullsize 4K broadcast camera with fiber uplinks to a lightweight, wireless, webcam style camera in the car.\n\nThe onboard cameras are 1080p, however these are tiny cameras, with very small sensors. Image quality is thus already lower. Now combine that with the fact that the car has to sent the images wirelessly it also sends this 1080p footage with low bitrates. \n\nThe quality of footage we‚Äôre getting is amazing for what it is.', ""I remember when all on board footage would cut out when there was a tall building or tunnel between the car and the antenna.\n\nAren't we getting a little spoiled, watching races live all over the world from multiple angles from cars doing 330 kph?"", ""I'm shocked we're able to wirelessly get video AT ALL from all 20 cars going around a 4 mile track at 200 mph."", ""> It looks like the onboard cameras have very low resolution and bitrates from the artifacts.  \n  \nThe onboard cameras themselves were 720p until F1TV Premium was introduced - as you're showing screenshots from Sky, maybe they're upscaling it from a different resolution?  \nhttps://f1tv.formula1.com/detail/1000008550/tech-talk-how-f1-s-onboard-cameras-work-"", ""[The Science Behind Onboard Cameras | F1 TV Tech Talk | Crypto.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDqdMyHxayU)\n\nAll onboard cameras share the wireless signal together with all the telemetry, radio, transponders and basically all realtime communication from the car to the pitbox. They are capped in bitrate because they reserve the rest for the more important stuff like things mentioned above.\n\nThe cameras themselves are 4K but they can't send that signal so they record it locally. That's why you will see replays on social media that are pristine in quality, as they use the recording from the car that they take after the race is done. \n\nThey also need to be incredibly light, as every extra milligram of weight means they need to take it from somewhere else. All in all these are about as high-tech as they can be.\n\nAnd let's not forget, the production and broadcast center is in Biggin Hill in the UK, no matter where the race is in the world. So at any time during the race, about 120 video feeds are sent in real time over dedicated fiber from any place on the planet to Biggin Hill where the signal is being produced and the World Feed is made."", 'Just how the fuck would you imagine you could get 8k or even 4k videos from small camera constantly traveling at very high speed LIVE?? Its not filming a rock take off. The amount of data traveling during a race is monumental. We have to glad about the quality we are getting now compared to the static mess from 20-30 years ago. Also inside helmet cams are incredible tech and will only get better.', '""The outside shots looks ok, but the onboard shots look awful.""\n\nThat expectation is exactly the problem. You cannot expect tiny, lightweight onboard cameras subject to wind, vibration, G forces, etc. that also need to transmit live wirelessly at 200 mph with no direct line of sight to the receiver at times with the signal distorted by all manner of obstacles (other cars, bridges, metal structures, concrete structures, etc.) to have the same quality as expensive, heavy, professional cameras mounted on expensive rigs and connected to stationary\xa0broadcast equipment.\n\nLet me guess: you probably complain that the front-facing camera on your phone is not as good as your rear-facing camera(s).', ""Like, okay ? Are you aware of the bandwidth limit they face for that stuff ? Kinda logical it's over compressed."", ""It's normal. Better imagine quality required better optics. Better optics required more space AND weight. The cars are sensitive to weight so the lenses in the cars are small and the quality is lower than dedicated TV cameras.\n\nP.S and not to mention the image sensor""]",0,50,0.17,0,47,47,0,0,-0.03,0
