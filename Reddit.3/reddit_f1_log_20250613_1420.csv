Brazilian driver was the victim of a crime while having dinner in Zurich, Switzerland.

Gabriel Bortoleto arrived in Montreal for the Canadian Grand Prix after dealing with some issues in recent days. The Sauber driver was the target of a theft in Switzerland, where the team‚Äôs headquarters is located, and ended up without his passport.

The information was first reported by Band. Bortoleto‚Äôs car was broken into while he was having dinner in Zurich during the week. Some of his belongings and documents were taken, but he managed to recover most of what had been stolen.

The driver had to quickly replace his documents and traveled to Canada using a second passport. Despite the setbacks, he made it in time to take part in the official Canadian GP schedule, including interviews this Thursday (12th).

‚ÄúI had gone out to dinner one night in Switzerland, and someone broke into the car and took my backpack. I had my passports in there, my laptop, all my racing gear,‚Äù Bortoleto told reporter Mariana Becker.

‚ÄúIt was chaos, but we managed to find the guy. Everything worked out in the end‚ÄîI have my passports back. We didn‚Äôt recover everything, but we did get some of it,‚Äù he added.

Gabriel Bortoleto is currently 19th in the Drivers‚Äô Championship and has yet to score points. He finished 12th in the Spanish GP.

The only permitted type of tyre heating devices are blankets that comply with the design prescriptions listed in Article C10.8.4.\n\n>e.

1la1rn9,The most recent published version (From 2024 but uploaded last month) of the FIA Driving Standards Guidelines from the FIA Drivers Commission,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1la1rn9/the_most_recent_published_version_from_2024_but/,2025-06-12, Technical,"Just to be very clear:  
**THESE ARE NOT 100%** **THE CURRENT RULES. THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES SINCE THESE WERE PUBLISHED.**

These are from the 2024 season.  
  
However these are as far as I am aware the most recent version of these guidelines that I have found as the FIA does not publish them on the FIA website. They claim that as of January 1, 2025 they are part of Appendix L of the International Sporting Code (They even do so within these Guidelines). But this has not happened, at all, in any capacity, whatsoever.

Before I found this document (Shoutout to [51GT3.com](http://51GT3.com) for randomly uploading it last month) as I understand it, the last time the FIA Driving Standards Guidelines were publically available was from Imola 2022 when it was published on the FIA website as an Formula 3 document for some reason.  
As far as I am aware, no version more recent than that has been posted for public viewing.

I hope that the FIA will make the current version of this document publicly available and go through with their promise to publish the relevant sections as part of Appendix L of the ISC.","['If anyone is curious, the only reason I found this was because I was reading through the FIA 2024 Activity Report where they claimed once again the Driving Standard Guidelines had been wrapped up into Appendix L and published.\n\nThat of course is a lie.
