1ojz8x5,Championship Standings and Eliminations - Mexico GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ojz8x5/championship_standings_and_eliminations_mexico_gp/,2025-10-30, Statistics,"**WDC:** There were no eliminations in the WDC this race, with Russell remaining in contention. To remain in contention after Brazil, he will need to outscore Norris by 15 points and Piastri by 16. For him to win the championship, he would need to win every race from now on, and hope that Norris scores no more than 17 points, Piastri no more than 18, and Verstappen no more than 53 over all remaining races.

Despite Norris retaking the lead in WDC by one point, Piastri remains ahead in number of wins. This means that whichever McLaren scores the most points in Brazil will walk away with the lead, even if Piastri only outscores Norris by 1 point. The singular exception to this would be if Norris scores 0 in the sprint and wins the race, while Piastri wins the sprint and is 2nd in the race. In that case, both drivers would end the weekend on 382 points and tied on 7 wins. Norris would then be ahead on 2nd place countback, with 8 to Piastri's 4.

It is not currently possible for a driver to clinch before Abu Dhabi simply by winning everything. If Norris were to win everything and Piastri come 2nd in everything, they would go into Abu Dhabi separated by 24 points, making it technically possible for Piastri to win in the final race.

**WCC:** Ferrari outscored Mercedes just enough to retake 2nd by 1 point, and while Red Bull did outscore Mercedes, it was only by 1 point (I'm sensing a 1 point theme here...). This means that once again, 2nd place is on offer for all three teams:

* Ferrari needs to outscore (or score the same as) Mercedes and not be outscored by 10 or more points by Red Bull to retain 2nd
* Mercedes needs to outscore Ferrari by any amount and not be outscored by Red Bull by 9 or more points to retake 2nd
* Red Bull needs to outscore Ferrari by at least 10 points and Mercedes by at least 9 to move up to 2nd

Williams is also officially out of the fight for 2nd, and will now have to settle for a best possible finish of 5th.

^(Note: the best and worst finishing positions are rough calculations, and assume that multiple drivers can finish in the same position. Obviously this is not possible, but there are) *^(670 billion scoring possibilities in each GP)* ^(and) *^(5 billion in each sprint;)* ^(so it's not exactly practical to figure out the true best and worst positions.

Rather than BoP, everyone stays under the same regulations; if a manufacturer is clearly behind after early-season reviews, the FIA may allow **extra test-bench hours**, small **cost-cap allowances** and limited **re-homologation** paths to close reliability/performance gaps.

The number of parts eligible for ADUO has also been expanded a lot and now includes most of MGU-K, ES and CE. Only drawback is that they now have to combine all changes into one package.\n\nThe threshold has also been changed, although I dont know exactly in what way. Instead of 3% down on average ICE power, it is now 2% down on the ICE performance index, but their methodology to calculate this isnt public, I think. So I dont know if it's ultimately lower than it was before. There are then further benefits for every additional 2% deficit up to >8%, which is quite a lot. I am kind of wondering who lobbied for some of these changes in the latest ruleset. The new reliability allowance in the cost cap also considers some extremely high numbers in terms of components used.\n\nI am not sure yet what to make of all of this. With the upgrade restrictions on the new PUs being the way they are, having a safety net appears necessary.

That's why I do not like the Balance of Performance in WEC or the sliding scale for aerodynamics in F1.\n\nThe ADUO system seems like a much better way to handle things. It remains to be seen how it will work in the real world, but on paper it sounds like music to my ears. I wish F1 would adopt a similar system for aero development, where all 10 teams start with the same amound of wind tunnel runs and CFD allocations rather than pre-emptively kneecapping teams by taking away up to 30% of the baseline wind tunnel and CFD opportunities simply because they built a good car."", ""Rubber banding for development is probably a good idea. A team might sandbag by hiding their power level and making it seem like they're behind with a subpar engine design, with the optimized blueprints in a safe somewhere, but then they're losing out on valuable points at the beginning of the season, so there's really no way to exploit this.\n\nTeams that get it right initially are rewarded with just points, and not snowballing through a season where other teams can't catch up.""]",53,31,0.86,53,308,308,0,1,0.0,0
1okpia8,List of good races to watch?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1okpia8/list_of_good_races_to_watch/,2025-10-31, Discussion,"Hi! 

I got into F1 this year, courtesy of my friend, who has been a fan for longer. I got in right after Imola, so I didn't get to watch it (not yet anyway), but she caught me up on the basics. Monaco was the first race I'd ever watched, and my friend sincerely apologized (lol) because she said that the race wasn't a great introduction at all. Looking back after a few months of getting to know the sport more, I do agree that she was right. I've been watching every race since then, and I honestly think all the races so far have been entertaining. But yeah, other than a few clips from races from earlier in the year and past years, I haven't watched any full races from before Monaco 2025.

This now brings me to my question: Could you maybe suggest races (starting from 2015 preferably, I've grown to like Max and want to start from there haha) that are actually worth watching in full and/or maybe have significance of some sort? Like staple races that you just *have* to see unfold. I'm still open to races before 2015 though, especially if it's very monumental for F1.  
  
I was initially planning on binging everything, but watching 10 years' worth of races might actually burn me out, and I'd never touch F1 again, haha. So, maybe fan-favorite races from 2015-2024? Let me know what I should watch to be cultured!","['Brazil 2024 and Germany 2019 definitely\n\nI liked Imola and Silverstone 2024 too', 'Outside of your time limits but no F1 fan’s life should be complete without watching the full race from Spa (Belgium) 1998.
