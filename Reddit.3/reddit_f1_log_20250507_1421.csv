1kgt8cf,Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess did he doing good anymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kgt8cf/yuki_tsunoda_is_currently_in_a_position_where_no/,2025-05-07, Discussion,"Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess whether he is fast or slow anymore.

Yuki began 2025 with excellent pace. In Australia, he steadily maintained P5 and even overtook Ferrari for P4 after the restart, but VCARB's wrong pit stop decision destroyed everything. In China, Yuki continued to maintain good speed and secured P6 in the sprint race, with abundant opportunities to claim P8 in the main race, but once again, VCARB made an incorrect pit stop decision, and then the front wing of his car exploded...

Clearly, Yuki with VCARB raced well and proved himself as the best of the rest, even holding off some cars from the BIG 4. RB also positively evaluated that performance and promoted him to the main team.

Continuing with Red Bull, after 6 consecutive years of struggling with their second driver, they and everyone else understood that their car is undrivable for anyone except Max. Their approach with Yuki has also changed. RB has agreed to let Yuki use a setup that is ""slower but more stable.""

This also leads to some questions: how much slower is this ""slower but more stable"" setup compared to Max's setup in an ideal lap? Can Yuki with this ""slower but more stable"" setup achieve better speed than Yuki with the fastest possible setup? Yuki himself lacks experience with RB's car, so setup issues may continue throughout the season.

Anyway, Yuki's speed was immediately better than Liam's. Yuki made a mistake in Japan quali Q2, but in subsequent races, he consistently made it to Q3. Interestingly, the race where he was closest to Max's pace (Bahrain) was when RB's car completely lacked pace, and even Max had to compete with Alpine and Haas. I've also noticed that Yuki's Q3 qualifying lap times typically don't improve compared to Q2 - perhaps he's playing it safe and avoiding crashes? Maybe Yuki doesn't know how to improve his speed further when he can't adopt Max's driving style? It's very difficult to assess.","['Yuki has been better than Lawson and miles off the mark from Max.

As for the SF25 it might end up scrapped as it's simply not worth it to invest too much time trying to catch a soon to be 200 point deficit when you have a regulations shift next season. They should have done this switch for last  year and then this year the car would be right up there to try and steal a title before the reg switches.\n\nEither way, it's easy to talk shit now, gonna be a long one boys, strap in and hope for some miracles :D"", 'Translation \n\nAt the sixth race, Ferrari hit the lowest point of this start to the season with a performance far from the top. Just to give an example, in qualifying the SF-25 was only 2 tenths better than the problematic SF-23 . Better tyres (softer), better aero after two years of work in the tunnel, good efficiency in terms of top speed and DRS, no sign of porpoising. Yet the car practically never came to life except in Jeddah. A series of performances never in line with expectations while the operation on the tyres remains unknown. The Maranello team had a bad weekend where only the sprint, thanks to the weather that mixed the cards, once again rewarded Hamilton after a desperation move. Leclerc did not even start due to the accident with the intermediates, a questionable move in terms of evaluating the conditions.\n\n\nMcLaren was untouchable, even Verstappen had to destroy his first stint to resist in vain . The Miami heat made the MCL39 more unbeatable than ever. The spectre of a summer domination that would wipe out the competition\'s motivation looms. Everything depends on the drivers\' ability to avoid making mistakes.\n\n\nFerrari\'s potential unusable, the simulator says it exists but the track doesn\'t, here\'s why Vasseur talks about it\n\n\nIt\'s not purely aerodynamic, the car is simply running with mechanical settings that are inefficient for the race, this is compromising the qualifying. For some reason the engineers can\'t get the rear suspension to work as it should. It could be a problem with the anchors or the travel. From what we understand there is a new suspension in the works that could be combined with the latest big package but the timing is unknown.\n\n\nIt is a very delicate and totally unexpected change during the season , not rapid, if nothing else it clearly indicates where the problem is and that it is not strictly aerodynamic in nature. The hope is that the corrections work as they did a year ago , after the technical direction was suddenly vacant due to the departure of Cardile (who will take up a position at Aston Martin next July). At that time Vasseur took the interim but was certainly caught off guard as we entered a delicate phase. This could be a delayed backlash, perhaps the cause of some assessments deemed insufficient on the courageous changes of the 677 project.\n\n\nHowever, Ferrari cannot endure a long season that risks seeing it at times even in fifth place.\n\nCurrently in Maranello there are already two teams, one dedicated 100% to the 678 project in the works . A phase where normally dozens of different designs are tested, some extreme, to establish where the areas of greatest profit are. DT Loic Serra was in Jeddah where things worked less badly, at least for Leclerc, he was not in Miami . On his shoulders the responsibility of a triple and burdensome commitment: thinking of a good car for next year, curing the SF-25\'s illness, implementing (a lot) the quality of the technical choices on the track.\n\n\nEveryone asks the same question and it\'s legitimate: couldn\'t the Ferrari SF-24 have been further refined instead of changing it ""99%""?\n\n\nChanging the aerodynamic balance to focus more on the front end required a completely different overall geometry. Tweaking the gearbox and reducing the overall dimensions of the rear suspension did not pay off . The trap was just around the corner but could not have been foreseen in the simulations that only gave gains without any drawbacks. For better or for worse, the Venturi cars will remain among the most unpredictable and unreadable in the history of F1.\n\n\nAfter the stormy (in every sense) American weekend, it is worth underlining the words of the seven-time world champion reported by the BBC which now perhaps seem clearer: ""I think this car has really good performance. Something is holding us back at the moment, it\'s there, we just can\'t use it .

Maybe not because he supported Doohan and wanted to keep him in the seat, though -- probably because Briatore wields a lot of influence behind the scenes. Oakes always felt like a temporary figure in the team, especially given the talk that Renault are looking to sell it. Given that he aligned himself with the Mazepins, I don't think Oakes is some paragon of moral virtue; rather, I think he's playing Pilate and washing his hands of it.
