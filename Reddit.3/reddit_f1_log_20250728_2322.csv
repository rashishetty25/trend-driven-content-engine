1mbaarm,Tyres continues to destroy the possibility of good races.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mbaarm/tyres_continues_to_destroy_the_possibility_of/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"I have posted previously that I find it incredibly frustrating that the (S) tyre is basically a qualifying tyre now and almost never gets any use in races.


But once again the race yesterday saw basically no variance in tyre strategy 


Most cars put the (M) tyre on around lap 13. 


By lap 20 
- Piastri 1:46:7
- max 1:46:8
- Leclerc 1:47:1 
- Russell 1:47:4


On lap 43 
- Piastri 1:45:7
- max 1:46:5
- Leclerc 1:46:5
- Russell 1:56:6


Now obviously the cars are carrying much less fuel at this stage, but how is the medium still performing this well after 30+ laps! 


There is no point in risking a tyre change when the delta doesn’t exist and overtaking is difficult 


","[""I actually thought Lando putting on the hards was a masterstroke because I didn't expect a medium to last 3 quarters of a race"", ""big factor is the low track and air temp that put way less stress on the tyres.\n\nProbably, in a 100% dry race with 25-26°C air temp and 40+°C track temp, Medium tyres wouldn't last 30+ laps."", 'Yeah, the mediums lasted longer than expected, I think the cold weather helped.', 'Pirelli skipping a compound theoretically meant that the Hard should have been too slow, and so would push everyone to a 2-stop race on the significantly faster Mediums paired with either a Soft or Hard. There should have been variety in strategy. \n\nThe problem was the wet start and shortened race (not just that we went racing on Lap 4, but that the slick tyre race started on Lap 11-13).\n\nThis resulted in a 32 lap dry race, which made the two-stop too slow and so all strategy pointed to managing the Medium to the end. That’s what ruined it. \n\nIn essence a super slow paced Medium was faster than a pushed Hard which was faster than a pushed Medium-Medium.', 'cold weather helped pilots keep those tyres usable last so long, only cars with excessive load were chewing through them.', 'The issue is more complex.\n\n\nPirelli has to provide three compounds but they need to cover a ton of scenarios based on the weather and in general during the year you have such different conditions in terms of temp, heat, surface that they just cannot have that many specific tires and they need to guarantee safety across all of these possible conditions.\xa0\n\n\nIf the tires are too different in performance then you force the same strategy ultimately.\xa0\n\n\nThe bigger issue at play here is that tires have become the only strategic tool and this makes races way more predictable. Refueling added so much dynamics to races as you could undercut heavily since less fuel also meant shorter pit stops.\n\n\nNow the difference between the slowest pit and the fastest is what, 1s? This makes it just so hard to use pits and number of stops as a viable strategy', ""Tyre management. Piastri drove exactly as fast as he needed to to stay out of range of Norris, and exactly as slow as he needed to to make the tyre last to the end. His 1:45.7s on lap 43 (so, low fuel) is a full five seconds slower than his fresh tyre SQ1 run.\n\nArguably the only one of the front runners who would going be flat out on slicks would have been Norris since he (we assume) didn't need to worry about making it to the end on his C1s.\n\nEdit: added low fuel to L43"", 'Track resurfacing also had an impact. Similar to Suzuka', ""The amount of races I've seen where the driver in second is several seconds behind but on a better tyre and just completely fails to catch up is unbelievable.

We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""Ultimately, Lando lost the race and Oscar won the race at the start. Oscar knew he needed to take his chance and he did, so credit to him. Would love to better understand the battery issue Lando had and how much of a role it played (and how much of it was in/out of his control), but not sure we'll ever know. \n\nOnce Lando was in P2, the tire offset was probably his only fighting chance. A shame they didn't/couldn't double stack, since he easily lost net time to Oscar by having to do another lap on inters and lost net time to Charles behind as well, but I also have a feeling that if they had double stacked they would've both ended up on the mediums since the call for the hard seemed to be a super last minute call from his engineer as he was coming in. The extra lap on inters + the slow stop + a much slower tire meant he was climbing a mountain just to put Oscar under pressure. I think his own mistakes cost him the chance to get into DRS range, but I'm not sure even if he had had 5-6 laps of DRS behind Oscar that he would've been able to make the pass, given what we saw in the sprint and with Max/Charles throughout the whole race.\n\nOverall, I think both Lando and Oscar can take away plenty of positives from this weekend.

That was a race that could've had potential, if not for the track drying up way too fast. In the end, it was sadly quite boring. \n\nLewis showed why a wet setup in the rain is worth a lot. Some great overtakes in the wet and then in the end the same setup screwed him over when it dried up and he didn't have the top speed to overtake Albon. In a similar vain, Max got stuck behind Charles as it dried up, no skinny wing, no top speed. Same with Yuki who got double screwed because the call to pit came a bit too late. It's a race of what could've been for a lot of drivers on wet setups. \n\nNorris with a rather bad restart. He went early, made a mistake into turn 1 and that sealed his fate. Piastri with a simple overtake. I don't think Norris had the pace to get past Piastri on track anyways. His mistakes later on in the race didn't help either.\n\nOn the bright side, everyone kept it on track when it was still wet. I'm still very impressed by Bortoleto. One of the best performing rookies for sure. \n\nAntonelli really is in a bit of a slump. For his sake I hope he recovers some confidence quickly. He's young, but if his performance doesn't have an upturn soon, the media is going to start the uncomfortable questions and I would hate that for him. \n\nNow my side note after the weekend. Can we just get rid of the wet tyres? It's not Pirelli's fault, but by the time the track conditions are bad enough for the full wets, visibility is too poor to race. Might as well just not bring those tyres to save on costs. No one uses them anyways. Maybe bring a third set of hard tyres instead, so teams can run them in practice if there's doubts about a two-stop race where the hard could be useful.""]",34,161,0.93,34,271,271,1,4,0.010000000000000009,1

1mb0hly,When the Car Hides the Talent Gap: Antonelli vs Russell,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mb0hly/when_the_car_hides_the_talent_gap_antonelli_vs/,2025-07-27, Discussion,"I understand Antonelli’s age and the fact that he managed a P4 in his debut race and even got a podium. But when you neutralize the fact that he’s in a top-2 car — which can even be the best in cold conditions — the data becomes extremely disappointing. He was completely outclassed by Russell. Finishing behind him in 100% of the races statistically means Russell is simply *much better* than him, because Antonelli couldn’t even beat him once by luck or by making fewer mistakes. Looking at it objectively, it even feels unfair to see Antonelli getting all the attention just because he has a faster car and ends up near the top, while Hadjar, Bortoleto, and Bearman seem far more interesting than him.

Edit: ""rookie vs veteran"". We never had a champion that lost all their races against their rival. Usually it's very balanced and many won as rookies.

1mb1wd2,2024 Sainz vs 2025 Hamilton: It's not really close,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mb1wd2/2024_sainz_vs_2025_hamilton_its_not_really_close/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"Last year Carlos Sainz ended up with 9 podiums for Ferrari. He won Australia and Mexico. And in addition to 7 other podiums for Carlos, he also had 5 5th place finishes and a 4th. 15 top 5 finishes.

Through 13 races last year Seinz had 190 points. Hamilton has 109 (no I didn't transpose the numbers).

And yet you hear very little about Sainz now, struggling along to do the best he can with Williams; he's getting beat there by his own teammate this year, so there's that. Obviously it takes a little time to acclimate to a new environment; a reason that Hamilton OBVIOUSLY is given the benefit of the doubt on, despite last year's results at Mercedes.

Today Sainz's own pit crew screwed him over. And they then decided on a 2 stopper, and it simply didn't go his way today. Hamilton had one of his better races; passing a bunch of guys with his updated equipment and getting up to where he's normally at.

I do not feel that Hamilton is ever a threat to win a race. LeClerc has been consistently outperforming the world champion. It doesn't really feel competitive. Just like last year didn't feel that competitive with George Russell at Mercedes. I feel that, of the 8 seats that make up McClaren, Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, Hamilton is at best 6th, with the jury being out as way too early on Antonelli. Only the 2nd RB seat doesn't compare to Lewis.

In hindsight, the manner in which Sainz was quickly ushered out of Ferrari seems sort of sickening at this point. He's left to one choice, no options. And he's done career wise, unless one of the big three/four invite him to a seat, and obviously Ferrari isn't in the cards for that.

This seems alot different from a driver CHOOSING to leave because he's not the number one driver and wants to go somewhere else to be the big dog, like what happened with Daniel Riccardo, who should probably never have left RedBull. He's the last great 2nd driver they've had in years.

Guys like Sainz and Botas, who was a pretty darn productive driver for Mercedes, they both got the short end. Watching Nico's 3rd place finish a few weeks ago got me really thinking about this. There are some pretty damn good drivers out there, without the equipment to show their talent, left hoping for inclement weather or a miracle for them to have a quality day.

I've always loved Alonso, and have watched his struggle for many years now. About half the time he's ""the best of the rest"". Not this year obviously. But you watch him and you see the talent after all these years, and you cannot help but wonder how he'd do in a number one seat at one of the best places. Like with Sainz.

  
PS: Will Hamilton get a podium this year? It feels like wishful thinking at this point.
