So it seems win win for everyone."", 'I feel like they just need to give Yuki a shot as a one year deal. \n\nIf heperforms well, amazing. If he doesn’t, it seems like they’ve been looking for a way to move him out of the way for better or worse (in my opinion worse). \n\nGives Lawson a full year to show his stuff and put pressure on the Yuki seat, opens up for Hadjar (or Colapinto which seems to be fading).', 'Does the hesitation come from their failures with Gasly and Albon?', 'Observe how Horner gives the drive to Lawson for some reason that are beyond my understanding.', 'Since when is F1 about what you deserve?', ""I'm a fan of Lawson, I've followed his career all the way through from junior series here in NZ. But even I would rather see Yuki in the Red Bull next year. If Lawson has the seat I can see him going the same way as Albon and Gasly, except probably worse because if he bombs out it's less likely there would be a seat at any other team for him to go to.\n\nAlso he's already attracted a bunch of flak for how the Ricciardo situation was handled and I can see if he gets put in the seat instead of Yuki it will only make him even more unpopular with a lot of F1 fans, unfortunately."", '“Yuki won’t get the drive because he is a Honda junior” \n\nbs excuse, colapinto was a Williams junior driver, before he kept crashing didn’t stop redbull trying to buy him out', ""I'm a Kiwi and a Lawson fan, but I agree. Give Yuki a go next to Max and give Lawson a year to either show his value or not, for RBR in 2026."", ""Without having read the article, I think putting Lawson in the RedBull next year is silly. He hasn't even had half a season in F1. \n\nHow Gasly after 1 and a bit seasons and Albon after 1 ½ seasons went when they were thrust into RedBull is a cautionary tale. To make a guy with 3x less experience at the same age they were, be teammates with Verstappen and (likely) be expected to be close to matching him from the offset is a bit of madness.\n\nNext year Tsunoda will be 25 and will have 4 seasons in F1 under his belt. I think if RedBull are looking for a competitive teammate with experience, from within their setup, he's the logical choice. \n\nMarko's comments about Tsunoda's temperament/consistency aside, the only caveat to that is it potentially leaves RB with essentially two rookie drivers (assuming Lawson is retained, Hadjar is promoted, or Colapinto is signed (looking unlikely now), etc, etc). RB may not want that, they may want a driver with some experience either to give them 'guidance' with car development or to gauge the other driver off of.\n\nThe other way they may want to go is to sign Bottas to either RedBull or RB. At RedBull he's a proven competitor, was more consistent at Merc than Perez has been this year and will most likely be good enough to help in the WDC but wouldn't usurp Verstappen. At RB he's an experienced driver who can aid in car setup/development and provides that gauge for the rookie teammate. \n\nKeep it like that for a season or two, let the rookie teammate get settled, get a definitive decision about Tsunoda and then make the changes that are being talked about now (i.e. Lawson up to RedBull for Tsunoda then if they don't want Tsunoda in there anymore, *or* Tsunoda to RedBull for Bottas if they feel like he's ready and a second young drive in to partner Lawson at RB, now that Lawson is more established))""]",3782,497,0.92,3782,8709,8709,69,10,0.0,69

It was a premature end to the relationship between the Enstone team and the Frenchman, who contested his final Grand Prix at Losail on Sunday. Although he had only just retired, the rumour was circulating before it was confirmed and then made official: Jack Doohan will take his place from next weekend at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the 2024 season.\n\nAccording to sources close to the team, everything happened very quickly, just a few hours before the start of the Qatar Grand Prix, when Flavio Briatore called Esteban Ocon into his office. The Alpine chief advisor told him that he would not release him for the season-ending test with Haas unless he gave up his seat early.\n\nHowever, the director of the Frenchman's future team, Ayao Komatsu, had already indicated at Interlagos that an agreement had been reached. However, Alpine never officially confirmed the news, postponing it until Esteban Ocon was presented with the conditions, he would have to accept to ratify it.\n\nWith preparations already underway for those tests, which will take place at Yas Marina next week following the final Grand Prix of the season, the Frenchman decided not to give up, even if it meant missing out on a proper farewell to Alpine, as was a priori planned for the final race of the championship.\n\nEsteban Ocon, for example, had planned to wear a special helmet at this final Grand Prix in honour of the team whose colours he has defended for the past five years. In the end, however, his relationship with the team ended abruptly in Losail on Sunday, in the very first corner, after a collision with Franco Colapinto that he could do nothing about.\n\nEsteban Ocon's early departure means that Alpine will be able to give Jack Doohan his racing debut before next season, against a backdrop of speculation that Flavio Briatore is genuinely interested in Franco Colapinto.\n\nWe know that the Australian rookie was evaluated in more detail a few weeks ago during a test session to which Pierre Gasly was invited to establish a benchmark. Sources in the paddock suggest that he was close to the times set by the Frenchman, who will be the natural leader of the Alpine in 2025.\n\n**“This is not the way I wanted it to end.”**\n\nThis evening, Esteban Ocon gave his first reaction to the issue, writing on social networks:\n\n>*First of all, I would like to thank the mechanics and engineers working on all the functions at the circuit, at Enstone and at Viry-Châtillon who have raced alongside me over the last five seasons. We have shared so much together, and I am proud to call many of you, my friends.*\n\n>*I leave Alpine/Renault with great memories and the pride of having been the driver with the team's best results since returning to the sport, taking the top two podium places in Bahrain, Hungary, and Brazil. It was also an honour to contribute to fourth place in the constructors' championship in 2022. I know how much all those moments meant to everyone and it is that sense of achievement and joy alongside the team that I take with me.*\n\n>*It has not been an easy year for the team and the second half of the season was particularly difficult. For various reasons. I have absolutely no regrets, because I gave 100% in every session. As I have always done.*\n\n>*To the hundreds of hard-working men and women at Enstone and Viry, I apologise for not being able to come and see you in person and bid you a proper farewell. As you know, the plan has always been to race one last time this weekend and to say goodbye to you personally next week. I was looking forward to both. It is not the way I wanted things to end. That said, it is a small world in F1 and I am sure I will see many of you again soon.*\n\n>*I'd also like to wish my friend Jack every success as he takes the next step in his career at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this week.*\n\n  \nPD: Thanks u/RumBlaze to share it in the comments in the previous post about Ocon IG post."", 'This is pretty typical Briatore bullshit.', 'I said this in another thread but I feel like it’s worth repeating…\n\nI cannot believe Alpine came out of the whole Oscar debacle and got *more* toxic.

I decided to look how many points both of them have scored in 2022-2024 seasons, where they have been teammates.

**George Russell:**

* 2022: 275 points
* 2023: 175 points
* 2024: 235 points
* Total: 685 points

**Lewis Hamilton:**

* 2022: 240 points
* 2023: 234 points
* 2024: 211 points
* Total: 685 points

So both of them have scored same amount of points across those three seasons!

What about number of wins between these two? Russell has scored three victories (Brazil 2021, Austria 2024 and Las Vegas 2024), whereas Hamilton has scored two (British 2024 and Belgium 2024).

In case Hamilton scores more points in Abu Dhabi, he will technically become third teammate to Russell who has outscored him over their time as teammates (Kubica did outscore him 1-0 in 2019 and if you want to count 2020, Bottas technically did outscore him 4-3 when they happened to be teammates for that one race).

And, if Russell scores more points, he will become the second teammate to Hamilton who has outscored him over their time as teammates (Button did outscore him 672-657 during 2010-2012 seasons)

So, who do you think will end up having more points in total across these three seasons?

Or do they both end up on same amount of points? This is only possible if either of these two scenarios occur:

1. Both of them end up outside the points (0 points for both) or
2. One of them finishes 9th in the race and the other one finishes 10th. And the one who finishes 10th in the race also drives fastest lap of the race. Both would end up getting 2 points from the race.
