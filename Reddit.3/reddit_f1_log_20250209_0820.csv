This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

I don't understand, how? Obviously it is unethical to risk a driver's health by asking them to crash hard enough to wreck their car, but that's not the main criticism I hear about Flavio. From a purely sporting perspective, I see nothing wrong with Crashgate. Telling one driver to put themself in a disadvantageous position to benefit the other driver? That's just race strategy. I don't see how it's any different from Turkey 2020, where Bottas blocked Verstappen. You could argue that crashing takes no skill, but I don't see how skill matters. Strategy is strategy.","[""1. You aren't putting yourself at a disadvantage, you are actively putting the driver at risk. You are exploiting safety rules for your oen gain.\n\n2. You are not achieving your result by racing in a certain way(such as a driver intentionally driving slow), but by preventing others from racing. They have no ability to prevent your strategy."", ""\\> From a purely sporting perspective, I see nothing wrong with Crashgate.\n\nAre you fucking joking?\n\nYou dont crash a car to gain an advantage.
