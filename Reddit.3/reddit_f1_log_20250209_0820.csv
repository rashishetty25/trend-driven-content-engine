I don't understand, how? Obviously it is unethical to risk a driver's health by asking them to crash hard enough to wreck their car, but that's not the main criticism I hear about Flavio. From a purely sporting perspective, I see nothing wrong with Crashgate. Telling one driver to put themself in a disadvantageous position to benefit the other driver? That's just race strategy. I don't see how it's any different from Turkey 2020, where Bottas blocked Verstappen. You could argue that crashing takes no skill, but I don't see how skill matters. Strategy is strategy.","[""1. You aren't putting yourself at a disadvantage, you are actively putting the driver at risk. You are exploiting safety rules for your oen gain.\n\n2. You are not achieving your result by racing in a certain way(such as a driver intentionally driving slow), but by preventing others from racing. They have no ability to prevent your strategy."", ""\\> From a purely sporting perspective, I see nothing wrong with Crashgate.\n\nAre you fucking joking?\n\nYou dont crash a car to gain an advantage.
