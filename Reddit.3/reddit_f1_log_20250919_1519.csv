Reading between the lines and using the context provided, you can pretty well infer what's happened and why the question's been blocked.\n\nYou can say what you want about the headline or the premise of the article or the state of the F1 media, which I agree has been sullied by clickbait, poor research, and drivel masquerading as op-eds. But this is a brave and important piece calling out the obstruction of the press, a trend that I've noticed is rising in motorsport in recent years and exacerbating the erosion of real journalism.\n\nThat PR teams increasingly view the press as something to be censored suggests a failure of two things: properly training their drivers to be able to answer challenging questions, and building relationships with the media that serve both parties.\n\nThis second part is jeopardized when public relations entities control access and narratives to an unreasonable degree, thereby limiting journalists' ability to work ‚Äì\xa0and yes, as Mat's article says, often by speaking on behalf of otherwise cooperative sources. It's all about image control. And while in some cases image control is prudent, it's counterproductive and absurd when taken to an extreme, as it often is in racing.\n\nI know several other reputable racing journalists these days who feel powerless to do real reporting because they'll be yelled at, chased out, or denied access for deigning to do their jobs properly, which sometimes entails asking tougher questions because they're the only ones charged with doing so.\n\nGood journalists generally aren't interested in engaging with this kind of coercive behavior, and many simply stop trying after a while ‚Äì\xa0which only invites more rubbish to the table. Mat alludes to the perils of this pretty well at the end, when he has to offer speculation instead of firsthand material.\n\nThe quiet protest of declining the invitation is exactly what should be done.
