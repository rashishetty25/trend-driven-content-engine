And for entertainment. There were 3 racing laps left (I think?), obviously not enough time for a racing finish. Why not red flag it to atleast have 2 laps of solid running?

What's the point in having safety features if youre not gonna use them? It's like people who buy those seatbelt ends so the car stops ding-dinging.","['I think they didn‚Äôt want the red flag delaying things with quali not too far away', 'The safety car is for when marshals and equipment  are on track.

All those marshals on track felt totally safe during this situation because everyone was following all the rules about track safety. Also the SC slowed down a lot in that sector and nobody could have even lost the car if he wanted to\n\nIn F1 there are really the best drivers in the world, you actually feel a lot safe when they pass by because they are extremely good at what they do. \n\nBesides that this would have been an SC in every single racing series i\'ve ever marshaled to\n\n  \nTo answer your question this wasn\'t absolutely a stupid decision, it was not only the correct decision but actually the only decision possible. What\'s more safe than the SC?', 'For entertainment yes but overall no way that‚Äôs a red flag. They were able to remove it easily.\xa0', 'Timetable is tight and red flag takes a lot of time.

In my opinion, you should be able to earn the right to some racing room on the outside and you shouldn't need to be ahead at the apex for it. The best racing I've had in many years of simracing, is when both parties give each other space in situations like Liam and Fernando in the sprint race today and many others recently.

I understand that this rule is one of very few possible ways of consistently stewarding and I also understand there is a difference in competitiveness between casual simracing and the pinnacle of motorsport , but I'd honestly rather have the inconsistencies from a few years ago back in exchange for giving the outside car more rights. **Ahead-at-the-apex should not give you 100% control of the corner**.","['Both drivers should give room. Simple. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are side by side or ahead. No pushing someone off.

There's always drag racing."", ""I think the rule is mainly used to put blame if something goes wrong. But its abused as 'I am first I can push you off' which is what needs to change."", 'Did you start watching F1 because of Netflix?   This kind of driving started way before Max even got into F1.', 'Completely agree, it‚Äôs idiotic. It‚Äôs awful for racing that they have sanctioned forcing drivers off the track. Nobody is breaking the rules by doing it, but the rules are horrendous. \n\nAnd the whole needing to debate different bits of alongside, and whether they were ahead (by not braking for the apex at all) is not interesting.\n\nJust make them leave racing room. Disallow forcing drivers off, and we‚Äôll see good battles for a couple of corners, we‚Äôll see overtakes round the outside, it will be much better. \n\nIt‚Äôs the final blow to racing rules that have slowly degraded in quality over the years.', ""Yes absolutely.

‚Äú However, following the Sprint it was confirmed that Albon, Lawson and Bearman had all dropped out of the points, with the Thai racer handed a five-second time penalty for not staying above the minimum time behind the Safety Car while Lawson received the same punishment for causing a collision with Alonso.

Bearman was also hit with a five-second penalty for an unsafe release from the pits, with these changes promoting Russell to fourth and Stroll to fifth while Yuki Tsunoda, Antonelli and Pierre Gasly moved up into sixth, seventh and eighth respectively.‚Äù

They also made a\xa0[youtube video on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbTAHyzkrY&t)\n\nBoth T1 incidents are cases of a driver overtaking on the inside of a corner, so these are the NON-BINDING guidelines that the stewards use\n\nThe overtaking car must:\n\n*i) Have its front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE THE MIRROR of the other car PRIOR TO AND AT THE APEX*\n\n*ii) Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex, and not have ‚Äòdived in‚Äô.*\n\n*iii) In the stewards‚Äô estimation, have taken a reasonable racing line and been able to complete the move whilst remaining within track limits.*\n\nSo provided the car on the inside is under control and takes (in the stewards opinion) a reasonable racing line, there is no requirement to leave space for the other car. You can't force them off, but you have the line, so don't need to leave space.\n\nThe-Race video also shows the changes for this year when overtaking on the outside, and it was implemented on the Lawson penalty. last season, I don't think Lawson would have got a penalty.\n\nTo be entitled to be given room when overtaking on the OUTSIDE, the overtaking car must:\n\n*i) Have its front axle AHEAD OF THE FRONT AXEL of the other car AT THE APEX*\n\n*ii) Be driven in a controlled manner from entry, to apex, and to exit.*\n\n*iii) Be able to make the corner within track limits.*\n\nThese changes, combined with the dirty air increases this season, are likely really bad for racing, but this is what the drivers want and the FIA has listened.\n\nImportant to note that Verstappen was penalised for leaving the track and gaining an advantage, which is also covered in the video. If he had given the place back it would have been fine."", 'In my view, Antonelli went wide so early in the corner that it\'s hard to justify that Antonelli was ""forced off track"" by Piastri.', ""Watch Jolyon Palmer's analysis.

In both cases comfortably. \n\nIn one case Max went off and gained an advantage by not giving back the position he'd lost: Penelty\n\nIn kimis case he went off and ended up worse for it. No advantage gained:  No penalty.\n\nOutside line: same but you need to be much further alongside. Which is fair because outside passes are next to impossible, clean, with sinilar cars.\n\nThe ruling on how far alongside in both cases varies depending on the current guideline.\n\nIMO they are about right at the moment.

1kelew7,[AMuS] McLaren calls on Red Bull to protest,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kelew7/amus_mclaren_calls_on_red_bull_to_protest/,2025-05-04, News,,"['Translation:\n\n\n> **Red Bull can\'t get to the bottom of McLaren\'s secret. Now a Netflix scene featuring team boss Christian Horner is further escalating the dispute between the title contenders.**\n\n> The Miami sprint has further heightened Red Bull\'s concerns that McLaren holds a potentially decisive championship-deciding trump card. The one-two finish by Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri and the simultaneous zero lap by Max Verstappen are one thing. But what happened in the first ten laps is much more worrying.\n\n> Verstappen was still able to keep a reasonable distance from the two McLaren drivers until lap six. Then, as if by magic, the two Papaya racing cars disappeared over the horizon. This happened precisely at the moment the track began to dry out and the intermediate tires became increasingly hot.\n\n> Who had the best control over tire temperatures? McLaren, of course. And that makes the mystery surrounding the MCL39 even greater. Red Bull has been trying to get to the bottom of the mystery since the start of the season, bombarding the FIA \u200b\u200bwith questions about what is and isn\'t allowed. This is a desperate attempt to draw conclusions from the association\'s answers.\n\n> **Netflix scene causes trouble.**\nBased on thermal imaging camera images, Red Bull has virtually black on white that the McLaren\'s brake linings stay cooler on the outside than on any other car. And that naturally affects tire temperatures. McLaren clearly has absolute control over this. And that could be the match winner, both for a single lap and for the entire race. Because the tires don\'t overheat and therefore don\'t lose grip.\n\n> Red Bull is convinced that it\'s impossible to cool its tires with air alone. Last year, suspicions arose that McLaren was filling its tires with small amounts of water. And this is precisely what\'s now causing McLaren CEO Zak Brown\'s displeasure.\n\n> The American was annoyed by a scene in a Netflix documentary series in which his Red Bull colleague Christian Horner mentioned in a conversation that they had evidence of water in the McLaren\'s tires. Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\n> **Protest fee must hurt.**\nThe McLaren boss is now calling on Red Bull to file an official protest. If, as claimed, they have evidence, it must be brought to light. So that the matter is settled once and for all. Brown suggests that the FIA \u200b\u200bshould set a precedent. ""The protest fee should be high enough that a team will carefully consider whether to actually file an appeal.""\n\n> Depending on the severity of the allegation, the fee should be between ¬£25,000 and ¬£50,000, and this amount should be part of the capped budget. The plaintiff then thinks twice about whether to denounce another team without sufficient evidence or develop a new front wing with the money. Brown considers the allegation untenable from a technical perspective: ""Water in the tires would mean additional weight, and tire pressures would skyrocket during warm-up.""\n\n> The FIA \u200b\u200balso considers the activism against McLaren to be excessive. Since the first rumors of the water theory circulated at the 2024 Brazilian GP, \u200b\u200bFIA technicians have double- and triple-checked the McLaren in the areas in question. There have never been any complaints. Of course, the brake linings and what\'s hidden inside are also in focus.\n\n> The regulations set clear limits on the exterior design. Under the hood, there\'s freedom with the airflow and materials. Cooling elements or heat exchangers in the wheel carrier area are prohibited. In the gallery, we show you the different solutions on the cars of the top teams.\n\n> Apparently, McLaren has somehow managed to separate the air so that the brakes (hot) and tires (cold) remain within the desired temperature range. The fact that McLaren is doing something different from the competition is also evident in the behavior of the mechanics. During certain work on the car, they form a wall in front of the car, thus forming a screen against curious photographers.', 'If its not true, why care so much to respond almost angry like this and wanting to raise prices of protests? Why wanting to create a situation where smaller teams can not afford to protest while hoping bigger teams get pushed off from doing it to save money? \n\nAt the same time, if you have nothing to hide, why get angry? Just let them try and waste their time and effort right? It kinda creates the idea you have something to hide. \n\nThey did find something, that is clear. Could be they are nervous that a protest could expose the legal thing they found for everyone to copy?', '>Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\nDidn\'t McLaren spend years protesting RBR and Merc? Protesting and shit throwing is nothing new in F1, Brown should know that better than anyone.\n\n>\n\n>\xa0""The protest fee should be high enough that a team will carefully consider whether to actually file an appeal.""\n\nAnd this is so backwards thinking, McLaren should be investigated just for saying this. That will just allow teams to cheat, and others would be too scared to protest. His orange friend from the visit last year holds the same beliefs.', '> Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\nIts cool to see a traditional team like McLaren back on top in F1 but holy fucking shit the team would be so much easier to root for if Brown would talk less. I want Horner vs Toto back that was way more fun.', ""I don't get why teams take it so personally when other teams think they might be doing something. \n\nAt the end of the day every team has a right to question other teams and maybe protest if they want. \n\nIf you've nothing to hide then who cares about a protest"", 'There is something insane with the Mclaren once the track is drying, same last year and they suddenly just pull a 20s gap after being on the same pace as other cars prior, both cases, Australia this year, it got negated by a safety car.', 'Why does it seem like only Red Bull cares about winning? Ferrari and Mercedes seem to have already accepted defeat. They just sit back and watch McLaren dominate. No questions, nothing.', 'Look it‚Äôs no secret McLaren have come up with something as evidenced by the drivers statements that they can‚Äôt fire the tyres up in cool conditions. \n\nThe question is whether it‚Äôs legal or not and it‚Äôs hidden within the duct so no one will be able to tell adequately. Red Bull is doing the only thing they can and that‚Äôs try to force it into the open to eliminate the advantage.', 'I‚Äôm not going to lie, I want to see what a full on fight between Zak and Horny would look like across a full season lmao \n\nI liked the Toto v Horner, but we can‚Äôt wait forever for Merc to finally catch up and actually challenge CONSISTENTLY (I said this for the people that are going to come and talk about good results) for championships and wins, so this is the best alternative']",33,46,0.9,33,41,41,33,46,0.9,33
