Vasseur said. Let us remember that in Hungary what the French TP called \'evolved bottom\' had debuted, with the first artificial corrections made thanks to CFD analysis and without spending hours in the tunnel , to correct part of the problems encountered with the Montmel√≤ package. ""This type of reaction will be fundamental for next year.

For this reason the 2025 car will be completely new , ‚Äù announced Fred Vasseur during the Christmas lunch in Maranello .\n\n\nA calculated risk according to the team principal of the Italian team, even if with the current regulation ‚Äúsometimes you have the feeling of not running any risks but then on the track you realize that there really were‚Äù. There will be important changes to the front , with the suspension that will become a pull-rod design, following the philosophy already used by McLaren and Red Bull. Linked to the important mechanical steps forward, the aerodynamic surfaces of the floor have also undergone a strong restyling since, as understood by AutoRacer , it will be quite different compared to the first spec 25 iteration seen on the track starting from Las Vegas s . Surprisingly, compared to the car that won 5 of the 24 races during the season just ended, 99% of the parts will change, given that Vasseur stated that the 2025 Ferrari will share ‚Äúless than 1 percent of the current car‚Äù, for what is in effect a truly different project designed to try to win at least one of the two world championships available.', ""The rules from 2024 to 2025 are as stable as they get in F1, and literally everything will change for 2026, so redesigning the entire car for what will be the final year will either end up being an amazing hail mary to get Lewis or Charles a(nother) championship, or it'll fail spectacularly.

1hh3bfn,How often do Pit Crews Practice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hh3bfn/how_often_do_pit_crews_practice/,2024-12-18, Technical,"Does anyone know where I can get a rough number for how many practice pit stops a team would do during a week before a race?

I figure it is the kind of info which is probably casually dropped in the middle of a YouTube video, but I wouldn't know how to search for it by itself.

For context, the reason I want to know is that the Ambulance Trust I work for loves to describe our approach to resuscitation as a ""Pit Stop"" approach, where everyone has a single role and they all come together to work as a team, but I would quite like to be able to point out the next time just how often Pit Crews get to practice working as a team, compared to the one afternoon every 18 months that my trust thinks is sufficient dedicated training time.","['At the factory the teams tend to short sessions with around a dozen stops twice a day. |  \nAt the track they will do a 30 min session every day each 30 min session would be around 50 stops.\n\nRed Bull article about this: [https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops)', 'Idk but Talking Bulls podcast had an episode with members of their pit crew, can probably find out there', ""Some of this information is second or third hand from some personal sources, and some of it is a few seasons old, so bear that in mind. The article u/Mysterious_Research2 also has some interesting tidbits about Red Bull's approach.\n\nThe actual training structure and volume varies a lot between teams, I think the differences in approach between a top team like Red Bull and a much smaller team like Haas would surprise a lot of people.\n\nYou can break the training/practice down into three separate blocks:\n\n1. Off-season (December - Feb/March). The crew are working almost exclusively from the factory, and the top teams will be training their pit crews for maybe 1 hour per day. Not all of that is pitstop practice, so some days may see dozens of pit stops while others might involve some strength training at the gym. For the smaller teams it will be more workload dependent, and also dependent on their facilities (not all teams have a Red Bull-style dedicated pit stop practice room). There may be weeks where the crew needs to spend time on other things and only have time to practice for 30 minutes on 1 or 2 days in a week.\n\n\n2. In-season at the Track (Wednesday-Sunday). Similar between the teams. Each team will spend 15-30 mins per day practicing pit stops. Due to travel and the time it takes to set up the paddock, there is usually no practice on a Monday or Tuesday of the race week.\n\n\n3. In-season Off Weeks. Depending on travel schedules, fatigue and rest days, the crew might not spend much time practicing back at the factory between races (the number of days in the factory will be team-dependent). At the top teams the training might be similar to off-season when the crew are back in the factory, since they have more support that lets them take time away from their normal duties. On the other hand, some top teams will offer their crew more rest days between events as a perk, so the practice volume might be very small. For the smaller teams, who don't have as many staff and so rely more on the trackside staff to fill in when they're back, it will be heavily dependent on their workload. A busy week might mean they don't train at all."", 'Typical race weekend practice sessions: \n\nThursday PSP \n10-15 stops \nMainly scenario based, inc nose changes, puncture, penalties and single crew \n\nFriday PSP\n8-10 stops \nStandard stops \n\nSaturday PSP \nUsually doesn‚Äôt happen, due to time constraints. \n\nSunday PSP \n4-8 stops \nLimit stop count ready for GP \n\nFP1/2/3 \n1-3 stops each session \nMixture of static pit stops and live stops.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: \nForgot factory sessions:\n\nDuring the winter build Jan-Feb practice twice a day 8-10 stops per practice.\n\nDuring the season, some teams come into the factory between races and have one half day doing some practice, but majority wait until they‚Äôre at the circuit due to freight constraints.', ""During peak race season I'd venture to say they're practicing daily - for hours a day."", 'Speed with Guy Martin did an F1 special that let him get a shot at being an F1 mechanic, including the pit stops.

My point is that all these arguments about Honda links tying down Yuki are unfounded hogwash used to justify not hiring the better VCARB driver. And make no mistake, Yuki is better than Lawson, but whatever myopic bean counting faction in Red Bull management does not want him there, irrespective of any engine manufacturer.

This is a guy who has an executive advisor role at HRC; they do not give a fuck about tying Yuki down for no reason, in fact, they would be thrilled for him to get the opportunity at the main team.

1hhpb3x,the Yuki bias?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhpb3x/the_yuki_bias/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"I don't get all the Yuki love. I mean sure he's lovable but is that enough to get the RB seat? Feels more like a train everyone had boarded, logic be darned. Not saying he's a bad driver or that he doesn't deserve the seat, as he did his time but Lawson just makes way more sense.

Trial by fire because the grid in 2025 is going to be tight. That's the RBR way, feels like a return to old ways. Lawson is going to have to be up to the task, swim or sink. If he swims they'll have a good partnership for 2026. If he sinks, they'll get another, more experienced driver off the market for 2026.

Also Yuki's contract has one more year on it, Honda and their weird decision (again) to leave F1 hurt Yuki more than anything. Getting Yuki, they'd have to get a fresh driver for 2026, an year of unknowns. Better to have someone next to Max that has had some lashes of the whip that is going to be 2025. If Honda had stayed and got on the RBRPT project, 100% Yuki would have gotten the seat.

Having said that and Honda going to Stroll. Yuki in an AM vs Lawson in RBR in 2026 is going to be spicy.","['I mean we‚Äôre saying ‚Äòtrial by fire‚Äô but that didn‚Äôt work for Gasly or for Albon then they went with the experienced driver and that worked for multiple years before going downhill. Other than Max it‚Äôs just not worked and do we think Liam is another Max? Even Max had a full year at Toro Rosso with some mega performances which showed everyone that he was something special. \n\nI think the frustration is that Yuki has always shown he‚Äôs quick but he had to tone down his temper and become more consistent which he‚Äôs shown to have done. Other than the one incident at the beginning of the year he‚Äôs remained calm and consistent since. He‚Äôs also consistently outperformed every teammate he‚Äôs had. I think people are frustrated about this in the same way they were frustrated at Checo‚Äôs poor performance being allowed to go on so long.\n\nI hope Liam does well but I also hope Yuki can get out of the RB circus and get a chance to shine.', ""Truth is that no one 'deserves' a seat in f1. There will always be factors outside that play a role in who gets the seat. Tsunoda is a pretty good driver, but he isn't what RBR want"", 'I mean I think one of the biggest arguments is that because Yuki would be out 2026, there‚Äôs no harm in putting him in for 2025. If he sucks then they can drop him anyways. And having Liam in vcarb gives him more time and experience to develop as a driver without the harm of having max as your teammate. It was a win win.', 'There are much more nuisances in this situation than what Yuki deserves and what Lawson does not deserve.\n\nOn Lawson, is he a good drive with more potential? Yes. Is he an immediate WDC contender that can challenge Max? We can quite confidently say no. Not able to beat an experienced driver like Yuki does not mean he is bad, but it proves he doesn‚Äôt show his potential yet. For this type of driver, there is no rush to promote him, and giving him time to develop in the junior team is the best scenario to shape him into a reliable rear gunner. Why can‚Äôt he do that in RBR? To my opinion, RBR is not really a team for development. Their patience is thin, and they expect him to perform immediately, in a car that in 2024 even Max said sometimes it is not easy to drive. The constant pressure to a driver who only drove 11 races is a lot. Lawson could navigate it very well, and that means he will be with Max long term. If it doesn‚Äôt go well, RBR WCC position takes another hit with only one driver delivering for the team again. Fast tracking Lawson could setback his career development.\n\nDo I support RBR to promote Yuki because he deserves it? No. Do I expect he would be competitive against Max? No. Do I think he could contribute more than Lawson in the immediate term? To some extent, Yes. Yuki is objectively more ready to take the RBR seat within the RB stable, given his performance and also experience, and also let Lawson to develop more. If he is really really good, RBR can keep him until they see the next Max regardless of the Honda deal. Honda was clear thst they will support Yuki even he is not driving with their engines. If he is not good, RBR wants to sack him anyway, there are no harms.\n\nThe only reason for RBR to pick Lawson over Yuki now is if they think Lawson will perform better immediately in 2025 alongside Max which I am not convinced. I am more inclined to say RBR wants to burn through their Junior drivers until they have Linblad ready to drive for RBR. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.', 'Its not ""Yuki Bias""... \n\nI saw it the other way, It is more like Tsunoda ""hate"" are more strange because people stuck in the past...

Liam Lawson was the obvious choice surely? Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he‚Äôs probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026 following either Alonso‚Äôs retirement or then finally dropping Stroll. I know he‚Äôs had a large majority of his career with the RB family but he‚Äôs only there thanks to Honda supplying the engine.

Knowing this, Red Bull don‚Äôt want someone who‚Äôll be there for a year then leave, they want someone young to potentially be Verstappen‚Äôs successor (Ricciardo to Vettel).

With Hadjar most likely getting the vacant VCARB spot, if Lawson pulls a Gasly, I can see RB going for Hadjar instead of Tsunoda too. 

No shade on Yuki, on his day he can be amazing. I just don‚Äôt think Red Bull will want to waste time and money on a driver they know won‚Äôt be there next year.","['Alonso has a contract 2026 and stroll has an infinite contract, there is no space for him at Aston?!', '> Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he‚Äôs probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026\n\nWell, no, because why would he do that if he has a race-winning car?', ""The biggest reason is experience. Maybe people wouldn't be as hesitant about Lawson being promoted if he had more than 11 GP under his belt, like a full season or 2.

It's such a weird idea that this would be the case, when for all other drivers we are open to movement between teams according to their performance.

If Tsunoda performed better than Lawson it would be very natural to give him an offer to drive in the Red Bull car."", ""I don't even think its about Honda. Red Bull have the power to buy Yuki away from Honda and make him a Red Bull driver. \n\nThey just think that he has reaches his ceiling and that this is his pace. Clearly it isn't enough.
