Why don't shorter, lighter drivers dominate in karting on up through F1? Why is there so much variation in F1 driver weights (and heights)?","[""Found Yuki's reddit account"", 'Driver weight is a very tricky subject if F1. There is a minimum weight for driver, seat, and kit. If a driver is under that weight, then ballast must be added. However the minimum weight has been adjusted up because the very tall drivers like Ocon and George have had to be so lean as to be almost unhealthy. The shorter drivers like Yuki can have more muscle, but even a shorter driver like Lewis has to be careful with where he puts on muscle (he has talked about this). In the past drivers have talked, usually after they leave the sport, about disordered eating caused by being a driver. Even current drivers often talk about food and weight and how it must be very very closely managed. Bottas has talked about his own struggles with an eating disorder. Max talks about his weight a lot as he’s naturally shaped different to someone like Lando. But Lando too talks about what he can and can’t eat and maintaining a certain weight. It’s something the sport has tried to change to allow drivers to be healthier.\n\nEdit: Also you ask about karting. Lando has talked about how being so small and light was actually not an advantage for him all the time. He has said at some course and in certain conditions it was, but in other conditions additional weight gives you an advantage. He had problems that he was so light the g force would throw him out of the kartso he had to Velcro himself to the seat.', 'The seat plus driver has a minimum weight, if its too light they have to add ballast. Currently all drivers are below the minimum weight. The teams used to have restrictions around what muscles the drivers could work out to save weight and it got dangerous.', 'F1 drivers get weighed after the race. There is a minimum weight and if below the teams need to add ballast near where the driver sits so it won’t be optimally placed giving smaller lighter drivers an advantage. \n\nOne of the rumors for why Nico Hulkenberg didn’t get a Ferrari drive is because of his size and weight. \n\nINDYCAR used to not count driver weight. That’s part of why Danica Patrick (98lbs) was so good on ovals in INDYCAR, but bad in NASCAR where driver weight was counted.', ""For 2025 the driver+gear+seat=82kg. It just raised from 80kg, which it had been since 2019. So, Hulk is probably usually the heaviest, because he says he's about 78kg on his website, and that was borderline okay at 80kg but will be fine at 82kg. Driver weight also changes through the season (and even through a race). George Russell and Alex Albon have talked about having to be very careful about their weight because of their height.\n\nThere was a time between i believe 2015 and 2018 where driver weight was very detrimental, and it was just a part of the sport at the time- not a very popular part of it. And before like... the mid 1990s it was also true. I'm not sure about each rules set over the years, but you can hear Mansell how the 50 pounds he was heavier than Prost were a big deal, and honestly it's just mathematically true. Prost was a much shorter, smaller boned, slimmer man, and that's obviously lots of lap timed saved."", 'There is a minimum weight set by the regulations, so ballast is used to equal the weight between all drivers. There might still be some advantage to weighing less, but the ballast position is regulated, so I believe the difference is minimal.', 'There is a 82kg minimum weight for the driver+seat. If your driver is lighter, you have to add ballast.', 'So there’s two parts here:\n\n1. In F1 there’s the weight minimum as others have mentioned. The minimum is for driver + kit + helmet. Most of the drivers have a lot of space, but the taller or beefier drivers (ex: Lewis, Hulk) have more work to stay under the minimum. \n\n2. For ALL drivers, they will want to maintain their weights within a close tolerance. It’s not good for the team to have to change the ballast each weekend if the driver’s weight fluctuates. So even the lighter drivers will need to keep their weight stable.', 'You don’t consider 5’3” short? lol', '£1 has little impact on a F1 car\n\nMost karting races use ballast to remove any weight disadvantage.

1ia1n64,The Drivers Should Threaten to Boycott 2026 Over the FIA’s New Rules,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ia1n64/the_drivers_should_threaten_to_boycott_2026_over/,2025-01-26, Discussion,"My initial feeling was that they should just strike for the first 3 races of 2025, but admittedly a lot of fans have already bought tickets, and while most real fans would understand why it was happening, some people may still be upset at the drivers. 

So instead the GPDA should issue a statement that says ‘If anyone is punished based on these ridiculous rules this year, we guarantee that NONE of us will race in 2026’. 

What, they’re going to risk the first season of their new regulations being made up of reserve drivers and F2 drivers? No one would buy tickets to next years’ races, and We all know F1 is about the bottom line. 

Realistically, I know there are contracts in place that make this difficult, but I’ve got to imagine that the teams stand behind the drivers more than the FIA. 

Even just say Max and Lewis doing it could be enough. Nevermind if Charles/Lando/George join in.

The drivers hold more power in F1 than FIA because people pay to see the drivers race, to hear their thoughts, see their personalities etc… not see what ridiculous rules the FIA can come up with next. The drivers can shut this whole thing down. 

I hope they flex the power they have. 

Edit: this isn’t about the swearing itself. It’s about how the FIA under MBS is overreaching and being controlling in a way that can only be detrimental to the sport over completely ridiculous things. 

They haven’t said that this only applies to press conferences. They are mic’d up and surrounded by people all the time, and their sport is subject to a ton of adrenaline. Are they going to get penalized if someone crashes into them at 350 kph and they go into the barriers and end their race and they say ‘shit’ over the radio? No guidance. Is it possible that the difference between someone being WDC and not will be the fact that they ‘took a knee’ to protest over something important to them? 

MBS decided to freak out over one swearing incident, they punished Max, ALL of the drivers (whether they swear or not) recognized this was too much, disagreed and submitted a statement about this. This is just the FIA trying to scare them into subservience over this and any future issues. 

I just think the drivers don’t need to and shouldn’t put up with this.

As I'm guessing he will know the tracks well enough, he can place better.

As I'm new to F1 can the brain trust educate me and give me their views on when oscsr might be a chance.

I think this year its lando, Max, Charles.  With a special guest appearance from oscar, George and Lewis. With guest stars, alonso and Lawson.
","['World championship is farfetched \n\nHe should first try to close up the 20-4 head to head in quali', ""It depends first and foremost on the car. If McLaren picks up where they left off, he's in a decent position, but then has to beat Norris consistently, which he has not yet done. He was outqualified by Norris 20-4, and out-raced 16-8 this past season. It's not impossible, but he needs to find another level. \n\nBut if it's a 4-way fight between Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, and Red Bull, he not only has to be better than Norris, he has to be better than Hamilton, Leclerc, Norris, Russell, and Verstappen (± Antonelli and Lawson)."", 'A real chance? Not in the foreseeable future. That’ll only change if he outperforms Norris AND has a car that could win the championship.

Both of his wins were dubious. He needs to improve in his one-lap pace, although I don't know how he'll do that."", ""Honestly?\n\nI think he's very talented but from what he has shown so far, he needs to be able to match or beat Norris regularly.

Jenson Button situation where he is paired with someone less skilled in a competitive car or b). a Nico Rosberg situation where he can match his teammate and has a little bit of good luck to go his way."", 'He had a chance this year, he had the fastest car for the majority of the year.

Yes they take over the Honda power train and become a constructor, but they lost the expertise of newey. As a new constructor I just think they are at a loss losing newey to aston.

With Aston in early 2024 showing they are up there, with newetu it may make Alondo thst much more competitive  as the car takes leaps and bounds to be a winning car that's to jewery.

Am im giving too much credit newey? Is he not actually that good?

Anyway I think redbull is on the decline. Max maybe a tops driver, but I think the 2025 car will struggle against McLaren and Ferrari due to the inexperience of being a new constructor and the lise of newery. Max's work is cut out for him, tho Liam will be a good now driver so might help Max  dive some, take out threats? As Liam knows his place and would want to keep his RB seat?

The 2025 season maybe epic... teams seem to be on equal footing as they lose and gain expertise.

The lol will be id Newey designs a car that puts Lance on the podium more often than not.
