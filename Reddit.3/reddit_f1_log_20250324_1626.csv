Let’s assume that Verstappen is (say) three tenths quicker than Lawson at this moment, intrinsically. Then add that this car is so difficult to drive that Lawson is yet to extract 3 tenths out of the car. Because he is driving this car both under and over the limit, the tyres are not in the right window, add an extra 3 tenths to that. So now you are facing almost a second of lap time difference between Verstappen and Lawson, and only three tenths of that gap is down to raw speed. The rest is about Lawson not being comfortable in the car. I know it’s just an estimate, but I don’t think that reality is vastly different. Theoretically the Red Bull is faster than the Racing Bull, but a confident Lawson in a Racing Bull is faster than a struggling Lawson in a Red Bull.\n\n>I get that the people at Red Bull say that the car is fastest the way it is set up now, but that seems a moot point if the driver is not able to extract that potential. I don’t understand that Red Bull cannot set up the second car more to Lawson’s liking (or Perez, Albon and Gasly before him).

Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were able to easily control the pace of the pursuers, no one had the pace to create great concerns. The degradation was under control on each compound, Andrea Stella confirmed that by monitoring the Stroll pace (departed with the hard) “we realized that a stop was the option to perform”. Haas also benefited from a winning strategy, diversifying and adapting to the conditions.\n\nVerstappen had an ineffective start but at least he was able to return to the distance, the RB21 seems a distant relative of the previous cars. Russell tried to stay around the cars of Woking with a good texture.\n\nThe Ferraris went close to disaster at the first corner, Leclerc fought well with a broken wing, despite a balance damage quantified in 2/3 tenths. For a long phase he could have been better than the seven-time English champion, which shows how well Hamilton’s settings had gone out of the window with high load.\n\nYet the worst was yet to come. The SF-25 remains a car with unknown reactions in terms of long run. From the sprint stars to the stables of the Fia sentence an hour and a half after the race. The inspectors of the Federation measured the cars and found them non-compliant. Leclerc’s SF-25 was disqualified for less than one net weight, Lewis Hamilton’s number 44 for excessive shoe wear that protects the bottom. As well as the Alpine of Gasly the riders have been removed from the standings. The rules in terms of compliance are not questionable and it has already happened that an auto-Venturi was found with excessive consumption of the underbody however suffering a double disqualification is an unacceptable episode for any team. In both cases, Ferrari cannot have benefited in terms of performance, they are both serious but venial errors, the adjustments are simply not working in the long race, unlike the sprint. This could not go unnoticed on a smooth track as the Chinese one is currently.\n\nTHE TECHNICIANS HAVE DISCOVERED THE ENIGMA THAT FOR THE OBSERVERS STARTED BY THE BAHRAIN TESTS.\nAS FAR AS I LEARNED, THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW DESIGN OF THE FRONT PULL ROD SUSPENSION, MUCH LESS WITH THE AERODYNAMICS IN THE STRICT SENSE SINCE IT IS COMPLYING WITH THE STABILITY REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe extra consumption of the plank is not a cause but a consequence. The structure of the rear air does not allow the expected stiffness, which obliges you to increase the height in a closed park to protect yourself with 100kg on board. The main clue is the rear suspension, approved in July last year, together with the new gearbox.\nThe Haas shares the mechanical parts and worked well after the Australian disaster, however it does not have the performance loading platform or the sophisticated Ferrari aerodynamics. In other words, the SF-25 struggles with the excessive softness that is compromising its operation. It looks like something already seen, for example, on the old Mercedes last year. The Red in the right conditions can generate much more load than the previous car, the sprint showed what the car could do with 35 kg of gasoline. The qualification after three hours canceled expectations again, less downforce in the curve and greater instability of the rear.\n\nLoic Serra arrived in October so relatively late on project 677. The French DT has returned to Maranello and is intervening to correct its effectiveness and reliability but clearly it is premature to formulate a solution or its timing. The problem is not easy to solve, the engineers are also working on some update areas that should be introduced new parts from Bahrain.', 'Knew it had to be the rear since haas didnt switch to the same front layout but they do get the rear end from ferrari.', ""I will give Ferrari credit for taking a risk by bringing a new car for the last season of a regulation change.

Do the current rules mean that every team is doing an estimate of how much rubber they will lose through a race and add some extra weight in their car? So if Ferrari's estimate is 500 grams and Mercedes's estimate is 700 grams, both cars start the race at different weights just because they estimate different tire wear?

Does it also mean that you have to add extra weight, just in case you want to go long on the same tire set in the end? So if you stay 30 laps on the same tires, you're legal, but if you stay out another 10 laps, suddenly you're not?

Does it also mean that a severe lockup or two during an intense battle can make your otherwise legal car illegal?

When someone crashes or has damage, we account for this weight loss by mounting a new part before weighing them or weighing them with the debris. I'm fairly sure the fuel also gets drained to account for different fuel use between cars. So why don't we account for tire loss when different cars will have different tire wear + drivers pick up different amounts of rubber marbles on their cooldown lap?

I understand why we can't remove the tires every time we use the weigh bridge in-session, but at the end of a race, we absolutely can afford to remove the tires and weigh the cars without them. So why don't we?

This feels really strange for a sport where we claim every gram matters... yet the weight of cars all over the grid can vary massively just on their estimate of how much tire they'll lose and also based on whether they stay long or not.","['The minimum of 800kg is car + minimum possible tyre weight when completely worn. So in any case a car is found to be underweight it’s the team’s fault.', ""> both cars start the race at different weights just because they estimate different tire wear?  \n  \nOr to read it another way - the team failed to consider their minimum weight based on their chosen strategies. They could have installed half a kg of extra ballast and they'd be fine.  \n  \nThe core rule is that car dry weight at any time during the competition shouldn't be below the set weight.

The consistency with which they adapt to ever-changing track conditions, car balance, and tire strategies is almost superhuman, especially for drivers with highly sensitive setup preferences.

Given the massive financial stakes involved—tens of millions for teams and potentially billions in sponsorships and branding—it’s hard not to wonder just how rigorous the FIA’s anti-doping protocols truly are. Are they genuinely strict, or is there a level of willful ignorance when it comes to substances that boost cognitive endurance and reaction times?

Also, a physiological observation: post-race footage often shows drivers with injected, bloodshot sclerae and facial flushing—classic signs of heightened sympathetic nervous system activity, catecholamine surges, or even potential stimulant use.

1jitemr,Why don’t we have “qualifying tyres”?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jitemr/why_dont_we_have_qualifying_tyres/,2025-03-24, Discussion,"Why don’t we have specific qualifying tyres? 


The Soft tyre is almost never used as a race tyre now as it’s hardly ever durable enough to be worthwhile, and without fastest lap I doubt we will see them used much at all. 


Would it not be better to have 3 useable race tyres and a separate set of qualifying tyres. 


The added bonus is you could design the qualifying tyres for whatever type of qualifying you want. 

- you could have a super durable set of tyres that allows cars to put in multiple fast laps, you could limit teams to 2 sets 

- you would have teams putting in far more laps during qualifying.


- or if you wanted a one lap shootout you could have a tyre that is designed that way. 


Teams would then be free to use any combination of the race tyres for the race 


To give some Context, using the e information from below, Soft tyres made up 13% of the dry tres used, with M and H splitting the rest almost equally 

In 2020 the Soft made up 30% 

In 2015 the soft made up 51%

And it seems that this motion is starting to gain traction. I don't know if this is naive or not but it doesn't seem fair to Liam that people who aren't in the team or who race the car should be able to put pressure on his team to replace him.
