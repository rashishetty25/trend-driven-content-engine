Then he rejoins the festivities. First, he says: ‚ÄúCould anyone else become champion in this car? I would say: I wish them good luck.‚Äù\n\nThere are emotions, there is relief and, above all, Max Verstappen is happy that it's over. At least, that with two races to go he has secured his fourth championship in a row. An incredible achievement. Especially when you consider that the Red Bull driver did not have the best material for months. He himself estimates that he has not had the fastest car for seventy percent of this season. Still, things are now decided. ‚ÄúI had thought we would have to fight until the last moment, but then luckily the rain came in Brazil. That worked out pretty well,‚Äù Verstappen said, referring to his fabulous victory at Interlagos, which indirectly meant the knockout for rival Lando Norris.\n\n**Proving them wrong**\n\nThe intermediate score, more than three and a half hours after he crossed the finish line in Las Vegas? ‚ÄúI've had four beers now and two gin tonics,‚Äù said Verstappen, now holding a can of Red Bull. ‚ÄúMost of all, I'm pretty relieved. The race wasn't great, but actually a little better than expected. It's nice that it's done now and we can go into the final races in Qatar and Abu Dhabi reasonably relaxed. There I still want to get some nice results.‚Äù By then he has already wittily taken revenge on McLaren boss Zak Brown, by rubbing his nose in his face that he can also become world champion in a non-dominant car. Referring to earlier statements by the American about Verstappen's titles in 2022 and 2023. ‚ÄúSuch things only motivate me. **If people are critical and think that I can only win in the best car, I prove them wrong. If I don't get credit for this now, I don't know what else I can do. Whether I would have become champion in the McLaren? Yes! And much sooner too. In 2021 in another car (the Mercedes, ed.) I would have taken the title as well. In 2022 it would have become more difficult, because Ferrari was perhaps a little too fragile then. And last year? Well, that would have been a bit trickier.‚Äù**\n\n**Not just shouting around**\n\nA roar of laughter followed, as Verstappen and Red Bull gave the concept of dominance a whole new dimension last season. At the beginning of this year, that's where things seemed to be heading as far as 2024 is concerned, too. But since early May, the panels have shifted considerably. The question is legitimate whether anyone else could have become champion in the RB20. Especially if you compare Verstappen's performance to that of teammate Sergio P√©rez. ‚ÄúWhether it could have been? We're in Vegas, so you can maybe bet on that. I would say I wish them good luck.‚Äù Verstappen acknowledges that he is happy with how he has handled disappointments this year. Intrigues were plentiful at Red Bull, both on and off the track. As recently as early September in Monza, he said that a world title was no longer realistic. ‚ÄúWe had quite a difficult time after a very good start. I am quite proud of how we got through that as a team. As a person it's important to stay calm and not just shout around that it all sucks. I wouldn't have been as good at that a few years ago. You learn that over the years, too. And a few championships help put it into perspective more easily.‚Äù\n\n**Never been desperate**\n\nIn Las Vegas, Verstappen stayed ahead of both McLaren drivers quite easily. Mercedes (George Russell won) and Ferrari had it better than Red Bull, though. It will be interesting next week in Qatar to see how the proportions are then. At that circuit, McLaren should normally come out well, as should Red Bull. ‚ÄúAnd we have to keep a close eye on everything...,‚Äù Verstappen is referring to the possible gimmicks McLaren might have used, at least according to Red Bull. ‚ÄúI'm very proud of this season, though. I never despaired, but we had a lot of conversations - including at the factory in Milton Keynes - about what we could do better. A lot has happened and it has been a tough year.‚Äù Now he stands at four world titles, as many as Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel. And one more than, among others, his ‚Äúfather-in-law‚Äù Nelson Piquet. ‚ÄúBut the first time I met him I had nothing at all... Now, fortunately, that's a different story. He also became champion in Las Vegas in 1981. He sure knows how to party here.

I'm not sure about redefining greatness. As long as the hardware contributes over 70% to the likelihood of a driver winning a race, we'll never truly know how good a champion was.

* No DNFs of any kind from Piastri, Bearman, or Lawson thus far

* Drivers are listed by DNF total, and then sorted by current WDC standing

Special cases:

* In an outlined box rather than fully filled 
* DNS is included where there is a clear mechanical (Gasly‚Äôs gearbox failure on the Britain formation lap) or non-mechanical (Stroll beaching himself on the Brazil formation lap) cause
* Pre-race withdrawal is not included (eg. Albon in Brazil) as it‚Äôd make it a pain to distinguish from those who also crashed out in qualy but whose garage managed to repair this in time (eg. Colapinto and Alonso in Brazil). Plus the whole Williams car switch drama lol. Obviously medical withdrawal is also not included
* Hulkenberg‚Äôs Brazil DSQ is counted as non-mechanical as it was a DSQ caused by the mechanics assisting him from beaching his car, which would have been a non-mechanical DNF
* Russell‚Äôs Belgium DSQ is counted as mechanical as it was caused by a technical infringement 

Observations: 

* 44 DNFs so far this year at Race 22. 2023 had 61 in its 22 race season 
* 18 mechanical DNFs vs 26 non-mechanical DNFs
* Most common mechanical DNF reason is - tie between gearbox and PU/Engine, with 3 DNFs each

I understand when teams discuss Plan A or Plan B. Ferrari, on the other hand, confuse me with what sound like additional strategies like Plan E or Plan H or Plan Z.

What are these strategies? Are they taking into account both cars, e.g. Car A on 2 Stops and Car B on 1 Stop? Or are they random names as some form of OPSEC?","['They are predetermined before the race. Usually the order is random to try and prevent the other teams from guessing. Ferrari may be using letters outside of the ‚ÄòABCDE‚Äô to prevent the tendency of putting the most obvious strat as A.\n\nBernie Collins says she always used to pick a predetermined, easily remembered number (so for example 20) and put that with a letter, for example E.

1gyiz32,"Should the FIA make provision in the cost cap for crash damage? If so, how much, 50% rebate? 1st $1M then zero after that amount?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gyiz32/should_the_fia_make_provision_in_the_cost_cap_for/,2024-11-24, Discussion,I ask this because of Williams run of bad luck. And in previous years Haas and other teams. Personally I think the FIA should allow a siding deductible based upon your previous season team points. Last place gets the most damage spending removed from their cost cap (to a rational level) while the championship winning team receives the lowest allowance for damage costs simply because of their championship winning income. The point wouldn‚Äôt be to reward crazy driving but to mitigate a force majeure situation such as happened to Ferrari at last years Vegas event or another car spearing into you and wreaking you.

This isn't a bad run of luck, these are all mistakes of their own making.\n\nIf you then get into what is crash damage and what is upgrades/obsolete parts, it gets way too complicated as well, very open to being exploited.

I have no problem with Jenson Button, he is great, but whatever misfit was alongside him he did not ask a single good question. (can anyone educate me where he raced in?).

Before this the drivers where moved by cars to the podium, why didnt the cars just park at the strip, or was this a problem with the track invasion? It just took way to long to get the drivers back to the Strip, it was boring.

  
Also the podium looked like it was on top Aarav's Shed (the Shed) there seemed to be no atmosphere at all, also there was no cooldown room, at least the trophee looked nice. The gimmic of the drivers being lifted up onto the podium was not impressive at all.

  
The race itself also has a lot of problems, from it being way to extravagant to the fact that the track looks like a pig upside down.
