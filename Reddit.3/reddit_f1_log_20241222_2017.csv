After that, we'll see as the season progresses\n\nAka if he doesn't impress quickly, he's out"", 'Zombie Benetton back from the dead.', ""DeepL translation:\n\nF1: post-Ocon, the end of Viry-Chatillon, the title in 2027... Briatore explains his plan to revive Alpine\n\nEXCLUSIVE. Newly appointed executive advisor to the French team for the past six months, the sulphurous Italian manager agreed to draw up an initial assessment of his return. Esteban Ocon's departure on bad terms, the Viry-Chatillon factory being put on the back burner, his activity in the transfer market... Flavio Briatore did not shy away from any hot topic.\n\nHe is the new man behind Alpine's ambitions in Formula 1. Having struggled with its 100% French project, the French team turned the tables last summer with the return of Flavio Briatore. A successful (Benetton, Renault) but sulphurous manager - banned for life from F1 after the 2008 ‚Äòcrashgate‚Äô (Nelson Piquet Jr's deliberate accident in Singapore) - the 74-year-old has changed everything in six months. At the cost of a fair amount of controversy.\n\nWhy did you choose to come back after fifteen years away from F 1?\n\nFLAVIO BRIATORE. Why not? I was already in the paddock as an F1 ambassador and I wanted to get more involved. I had the energy and the time since my son went off to college. At the start of the season, Alpine wasn't up to scratch. I called Luca de Meo (Renault Group Managing Director). I said to him: ‚ÄòIt hurts me to see my core team in such a state. We started talking to see what we could do. Formula 1 has given me so much. I wanted to offer my services to restore the team's image and put it back where it belongs. I want Alpine to become a real player in F1 again.\n\nYour comeback after the ‚Äòcrashgate‚Äô of 2008 came as something of a surprise. How do you respond to your critics?\n\nWhat always counts in F1 is results. I want to be judged on my results. I came back to Formula 1 to win. I didn't come here to be a tourist. I've already been around the world 20 times. That's not what amuses me. What excites me is to see my team win the championship or fight for it.\n\nWhat do you intend to do? And what have you done since you arrived?\n\nI arrived in June. We had two points in the championship. I started to implement the same thing I did at Benetton thirty years ago, that's all. F1 has improved in the meantime, we go to different countries and the market has grown. But the competition between the teams remains the same. Nothing has changed. We've refocused on team spirit. We've changed our main team with Oliver Oakes. We've also signed a charter with Mercedes so that we can use their engine. That's what will enable us to get back to the highest level.\n\nMercedes instead of an Alpine engine... Your arrival coincided with the team's departure from its historic factory in Viry-Chatillon. What are we to make of that?\n\nFirst of all, it's not quite over yet. Next year, we'll still have an engine from Viry-Chatillon (Essonne). We're still married to them (smiles). Now, this marriage comes with a divorce already planned. We've had a great relationship with them. We have a lot of respect for their work. As for Viry, I won several titles and 6 World Championships with them. I'll never forget that. At the time, I was at Viry every other day. The history of Viry is a history of success and championships won. But we had to change!\n\nYou've also been criticised for having made several hundred employees leave the group...\n\nIn F1, I don't think quantity equals quality. I've tried to change that. I don't enjoy reducing the workforce by snapping my fingers. Viry is not the only plant affected. We've also reduced the workforce at Enstone, on the British side. In return, we have signed people with a lot of F1 experience, and more will be arriving shortly. My mandate is to build a competitive team. I'm in the process of doing that.\n\nDo you have any targets in mind?\n\nToday, our objectives are clear: always do better. In 2024, we finished 6th. That's excellent news because it earns us a lot more money than a 9th place finish. Next season, we need to finish 5th in the constructors' standings, ahead of Aston Martin. In 2026, we should be aiming for podiums and victories. And in 2027, the title.\n\nShould we really believe it?\n\nFor the moment, we're on the right track. We haven't just corrected the mistakes for 2024, we've already developed the single-seater for 2025. We've improved the car by almost half a second per lap. For the future, we have a working group entirely dedicated to the 2026 single-seater with the future changes in regulations. Our employees are finally starting to believe in our project: to be in the World Championship in three years' time.\n\nThis quest for the constructors' championship title will be without Esteban Ocon. Why was he dropped before the last Grand Prix of the season?\n\nI have a different view of Esteban Ocon than the general public. We really have to thank him for what he did in Brazil with that podium. But after that race, his head was in his new Haas team. And we were playing for 6th place in the constructors' standings against them. I saw him completely demotivated in the last few races, with too big a gap to Pierre (Gasly). At the same time, I wanted to try out what I had in the pipeline as a driver for the future. It's not that I had a problem with Esteban or that I preferred Jack (Doohan). I don't look at nationality, whether he's Turkish, French, Japanese... I just have to find out who the best driver is.\n\nThere have been rumours in the paddock that Alpine is interested in Franco Colapinto. Can we be sure that Pierre Gasly and Jack Doohan will start the first Grand Prix of the 2025 season?\n\nThe only thing we can be sure of is death (laughs). We'll start the year with Pierre and Jack, I can guarantee that. After that, we'll see as the season progresses. I have to get the team in the right condition to get results. And the driver is the one who has to conclude the work of nearly 1,000 people behind him. Everyone works for just two people. If there's a driver who isn't making progress, who isn't bringing me results, I change him. You can't be emotional in F1.\n\nA quick word about Pierre Gasly?\n\nPierre has done an extraordinary job. He's surprised me enormously this year. He really is OUR driver. I really want to thank him. His attitude has changed completely this season. He's never had an accident. If we've managed to finish sixth, it's thanks to him. I'm sure that Pierre will continue his great work. And that Jack Doohan will be up to the challenge.\n\nAlpine also has another French driver in its Academy, Victor Martins. Will he one day get his chance under your orders?\n\nOf course it's possible! That's what the Alpine Academy is for. We've made a selection. We have the good drivers of the future in our hands. We look at everyone's performances. Victor is one of them. When someone is part of our academy, it's because he has a future with us. It's all a question of results.\n\nDoes this also apply to you? Will you still be here at the end of next season if the results aren't there?\n\nI have no doubt that we'll get results. Zero doubt. We have everything we need to succeed. The support of the Renault group, the engine, motivated employees... I know enough about F 1 to recognise a team that is going to work."", 'This is the beginning of renault resurgence.

VERY bold to start with the Imola crash.', ""Can someone explain the angle that's been trending that Yuki will overshadow Max and that's why Redbull chose Liam? \n\nSurely there's more to this than protecting *one*  driver's feelings?"", ""I'd say that Schumacher and Senna were the first ones to take it as a professional sport and started to push the physical limits for drivers to another level, but you really cannot compare drivers from such different eras to one another.  \n  \nCurrent drivers wouldn't take as many risks as they do now without many safety elements we have now that were not there, similarly they wouldn't take the risks of an exploding engine from the early years of the sport as they're not trained in a similar fashion to the physical demands of different eras."", 'The thing about Senna is that nowadays it\'s very hard to get a proper picture of his skills and as time goes on, it\'s getting harder and harder.\n\nDo you know the saying ""don\'t speak ill of the dead""? Nobody captures the meaning of that better than Senna. It is absolutely undeniable, that he was an insanely good driver. But exactly how good? Nobody knows, but it\'s 100% certain that he wasn\'t as good as people claim he was.\n\nFirst of all, it\'s easy to say ""well he was a 3-time world champion"", but 2 out of those 3 are extremely debatable. In 1988 he won because of some fucked up idiotic rule, Prost had far more points, but because of this rule Senna was crowned. And in 1990 he won by literally removing his opponent from the track. Deliberately crashing into him. And proudly admitting that he did. And people were like ""ok that\'s fine, no need for a penalty"". Not exactly how a ""goat"" wins championships, if you ask me.\n\nSecond of all, like I said, people just refuse to speak ill of the dead. The legend of Senna\'s greatness is similar to the fishing story your uncle always tells. Somehow that fish is bigger and bigger each time he tells the story. It started from a 50cm bass, then it was a 1m pike, last time he drank a bit too much and was mumbling something about it being a shark... so how big was that fish really? Nobody really knows, because the eye witness lies, always exaggerates and the level of exaggeration changes all the time. The same applies to how good Senna was.\n\nHe was good. He was well above average. But definitely not the goat. He\'s way overhyped by his fans which is like borderline a cult.
