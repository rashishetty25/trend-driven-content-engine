1mpt6qf,What an Oscar Piastri WDC would mean for Australian Motorsport.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mpt6qf/what_an_oscar_piastri_wdc_would_mean_for/,2025-08-14, Discussion,"If Oscar Piastri maintains a lead over Lando Norris to secure the 2025 Formula One Driver's Championship:

* He becomes the first Australian since Alan Jones in 1980 (45 years of F1's 75) to win the WDC
* He becomes one of just 3 Australians to do it, alongside Jones and Jack Brabham
* He wins only Australia's fifth ever WDC
* He defies his manager's Mark Webber's ""almost seasons"" at Red Bull
* He achieves it as an Australian surrounded by a British team

While everyone wants to see a fair battle between Lando and Oscar this season, with the best driver getting the win, the signs seem to point to Oscar's potential championship being the more historically significant of the two, since we know Britain has a long, proud but highly decorated F1 history.

Even if he doesn't he is still the first Australian to:

* Lead an F1 Driver's Championship since Mark Webber in 2010
* Secure more than 10 podiums in one season (and counting)
* Secure more than 4 consecutive podiums (his 8 in 2025 matches Senna in equal P2 for Mclaren)
* Win more than 5 races within a single season
