1o35wd0,"“ The next morning I was in the shower and I collapsed. I was peeing red , That was not great ! ” Esteban Ocon reflects on the most violent crash of his F1 career so far",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o35wd0/the_next_morning_i_was_in_the_shower_and_i/,2025-10-10, Quotes,,"[""Ocon's crash exposed a glaring safety issue that most newer street tracks appear to have (edit: I can think of at least one corner in each of the new street circuits that has the potential to cause a bad accident). I always questioned how tracks like Miami and *especially* Jeddah got approved by the FIA when their construction ended mere weeks before their scheduled races.\n\nThe latter's case is especially baffling, that whole track is made of high-speed blind corners, several of them with nothing except concrete barriers like the one shown above. That track is legitimately dangerous, and I think it's a disaster waiting to happen, especially on feeder series races."", 'I see Ocon is a man of class who also pees in the shower', ""I remember this crash vividly. You know why? \n\nBecause the f@@king FIA was busy pestering Lewis for his f@@king nose piercing!!!😡\n\nThe seriousness of this crash into a concrete wall wasn't even addressed."", '>“I took 42G – for people who want to see that crash, it’s not that impressive, but I hit a concrete wall. That was in Miami, in FP3, in 2022. I went off, I hit the wall.""  \n“I remember, the next morning I was in the shower and I collapsed. I lost my balance and fell, I was not well at all. I managed, starting from last, to finish eighth in that race. I was peeing red, that was not great!”\n\nI have nothing against Ocon, but participating in a 2h race in an F1 car **the same day** he had balance issues and was pissing blood is the dumbest, most irresponsible things I\'ve heard in a while.', 'Did he have beets the night before?\n\nBecause I want to share a very important public service announcement that if you eat beets and then pee/shit red you do NOT necessarily have internal bleeding.\n\nRelax, you good 😏', ""This is why I don't like that all the newer street circuits are bare concrete. It has very little energy absorption capability, so hit it at the wrong angle and/or where it's unprotected and the impact is really really nasty.\n\nArmco is less practical (has to be bolted down, sometimes has to be repaired after an impact), but deforms significantly to dissipate more energy. I'll take that any day on the sort of high speed street circuits we're seeing more and more of."", 'super safe race track that one', 'That track is Aladeen!', ""Because f1 and the FIA don't care about safety.

1o35a7h,How many titles would F1 drivers have using today's points?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o35a7h/how_many_titles_would_f1_drivers_have_using/,2025-10-10, Statistics,,"[""The thing is, drivers and teams make every decision based on the rules that existed at the time.\n\nIn the years that only your best x rounds counted, the psychology of everything was entirely different.\n\nIf you had to get top 6 to score points, each race would go entirely differently. You don't go for the safe 8th place and 4 points, you go for the crazy chance to get 6th or better, even if there is a 90% of the time it won't work and might even land you in 22nd place. Because 8th is worthless to you.\n\nThat being said, I like the current points system best, at least of the ones I’ve watched.\xa0"", 'Quick, hide this article from Jacques.', ""Always crazy to me that with today's points Prost has seven titles. Crazy."", 'Prost is the GOAT\n\nEnd of discussion\n\nEdit: I mean in this timeline', ""I get that this is all hypothetical and in the end, it doesn't really mean that much, but it is still interesting to read.\n\nProst joins Schumacher and Hamilton as a 7 timer, Irvine gets a championship, Damon Hill gets a 2nd and his dad gets a 3rd, Villeneuve never gets one if Schumacher isn't DSQ'd in '97."", 'Another great example of that is Jerez 97. Under the current points system Schumacher would have gone into that race with an unbeatable lead so would not have done what he did to Jacques in hopes they both DNF', ""Yeah it's a fun theoretical exercise but using this is a main argument for someone being the best (like we already see with some of the comments here) doesn't make any sense. Every single point system is subjective by default, and teams and drivers operate based on the rules agreed for the particular year in question.\n\nEven the Schumacher-Villeneuve case in the article is a good example of this. Schumacher would have no reason to crash into Villeneuve under the current point system so the title should go to him? But then shouldn't we look into every race of the season?"", "">That being said, I like the current points system best. I think most of the old systems didn't reward winning enough, with a points systems that were too flat. But, it was what it was.\n\nThe current system is, give and take, the 2nd least win rewarding points system, so I reckon you're not as informed as you might think you are."", 'Still a champion in CART and indy 500 winner.', 'Its insane to me that more people argue for Senna as the GOAT compared to Prost']",164,38,0.83,164,904,904,5,0,-0.010000000000000009,5
