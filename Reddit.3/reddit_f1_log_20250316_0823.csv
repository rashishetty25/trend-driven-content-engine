1jbrcyn,So is the Redbull that hard of a car to drive?

There’s no way all his past teammates are this bad. Gasly, Albon, Perez, Lawson all over 6 tenths or more slower than Max in the same car. Hell, Perez was closer in the 2020 RP than he was in 2021 RB, meaning RP was probably the 2nd quickest car in 2020, but Max is just an alien.

It’s very early; but Albon will probably be at least equal or very very close to Sainz. Obvs it his first quali session, but rarely did drivers close such a deficit over a season and then gain it on top. 

I’m genuinely starting to think Max might have spoken the truth when he said in 2020 “I’m 2 tenths faster than anyone else”.  And that “everyone else” included the likes of prime or at least very close to prime Hamilton.

I haven’t seen this level of domination since Schumacher in the 90’s. Just levels above everyone. That generation was also made to look bad by him, because great drivers like Barrichello or Irvine who beat almost all of their other teammates, including legends of the 80’s but also future talents(hell, old Rubens was matching a prime Jensen Button; who wasn’t that far off Lewis) were absolutely demolished by Schumacher. And the media couldn’t accept Schumacher was that much better than everyone else, so the entire generation was just deemed weak.

I think Max at this point has the same effect, however this generation is more proven because we’ll have direct comparison between Leclerc-Vettel, Norris-Ricciardo, Russell-Lewis,  Leclerc-Lewis, Albon-Sainz etc.

","[""Probably a mix of both. Max is an all time great calibre of driver but also the car is very difficult to find a balance with that gives the driver confidence. Max can live with that, his teammates haven't been able to and it widens the gap between them.\n\nIf the car was more compliant his teammates would be closer.

There's no way that he is that bad in the car, I've never seen him doing similar things in RB.

To make things even funnier, Will Buxton was there in Bahrain when he asked Norris if the car had been good to drive so he knew Norris hadn’t been underperforming, he knew about the upgrades.

McLaren didn't mess up their strategy and implemented team calls to prevent possible crashes. You might not like it if you're an Oscar fan, but in those conditions, that was the right call, IMO. 

Red Bull had a sound strategy.

Williams had good strategy scoring amazing points with Albon in P4.

Mercedes should be happy about a podium and a rookie who did incredibly well for a debut, great strategy.

Sauber with points in race 1 is incredible.

Haas didn't have pace but at least kept both cars on the track.

Alpine were... Alpine. Not great for sure.

Racing Bulls bottled their strategy completely messing up Yuki's race.

Ferrari decided to shoot themselves in the foot. The radio messages were funny, but as a driver, that must be frustrating.

2. Max: pure talent, man! A class driver —and Lando knows it. One mistake, and Max will be right there, ready to snatch away points from you. Especially when it rains.


3. Russell: He drives.


4. Norris vs Piastri is loading. Rivalry within house is gonna be fun for us, headache for Brown and opportunities for Max.


5. Hamilton is learning, so is Ferrari.


6. Williams and Vowles are cooking. Hope it doesn't end up like Aston Martin in 2023.


7. For me, the back-markers are still unclear. Ferrari, despite fighting with Williams and Alpine, will soon catch up to be among the front-runners or at least the lower front. Mercedes is in the upper midfield, and maybe Williams too. Alpine and the rest, including Aston Martin, seem more like mid to lower midfield teams. Sauber and Haas will probably eventually end up being the tail of the pack, but for now, I think they can still catch up to RB, Alpine, and Aston Martin. I'm not convinced yet on who will be the lapped cars.


8. Rookies are adapting among big shots. They'll deliver soon.


Edit: some additional points I should've added + elaborating few.

9. Lando deserved that win—he drove brilliantly, and praising Max or discussing mistakes doesn’t take away from that. But we all know how even a small mistake can cost him dearly. I agree with Crofty that he could have suffered the same fate as Oscar with that mistake, and no, that mistake wasn’t small—c’mon, guys. As for Max, it’s clear he can deliver even without being in a rocket ship.

10. Mercedes vs Ferrari: Many pointed out that Mercedes was faster than Ferrari, and I agree. However, Ferrari has the advantage of a seasoned (legendary) driver. Both Kimi and Lewis will need some time to settle in, and as I mentioned elsewhere, opinions might shift as the weeks and races progress. That said, we’re not quite at the point where we need to discuss Ferrari’s No. 2 driver—lol.

11. Piastri: Some people don’t see him as ready for a championship battle yet, but I believe he has the potential. In my opinion, he can deliver.

12. Kimi: He’s getting the hang of the car. I’d love to see him and Ferrari battle in the coming days.

13. Yuki: He had a great race—until he didn’t. We’ll often hear him and Liam in the same sentence this year.","['George:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1ihmdnn40pe1.jpeg?width=783&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69b5fb3771009894d07285ddb89c9785c5f2fb65', 'We have to give Lando credit for his restarts today.

1jbqvp6,Is the Racing Bull faster than the Red Bull,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jbqvp6/is_the_racing_bull_faster_than_the_red_bull/,2025-03-15, Discussion,"In Quali at Albert Park Yuki Tsunoda was less than two tenths off Max Verstappen which is closer than you'd expect between those two drivers. Also Hadjar was seven tenths quicker than Lawson in Q1 and Tsunoda was 8 tenths faster in Q1. Comsidering the gap between Lawson and Tsunoda was not that big last year when they were team mates it surely begs the question, at least in qualifying pace, is the Racing Bull faster than the Red Bull?! 
Comsidering Yuki was less than two tenths off Max you also have to wonder what time would Max out in in that machine? What he still be third? would he be lower? Could he even be better? 

Also imagine telling someone just one year ago that this is a genuine debate. What do you all think?

","['One quali session is way to early to call anything \n\nA sample of 3-4 races and then we can see the pecking order\n\nAlso it could be very possible that RB have a solid car over one lap pace but lacking Race pace \n\nSo way to early to call', ""Not the first time over the past years we see a Torro Rosso looking potentially as fast if not faster than Red bull over one lap producing similar lap times. Not the last I'm sure."", ""Definitely not. RB found the right setup overnight and, like last year, when it's in the right window, it's fast. \n\nThat also wasn't Max's potential fastest lap. He was down in one of the sectors on that last lap so the gap is actually a little bigger.\n\nThis shouldn't take anything away from Yuki though. Great performance."", 'No', 'Regardless, it would be insightful to see all 20 drivers drive that RBR at the end of the season before we completely scrap the car for new regulations. I wanna see if everyone but Max struggles to drive the car', 'Yep, starting in china Yuki will beat Max Verstappen every race..', 'Max isn’t outdriving the car, Max’s speed is representative of the car’s potential - as Max is extracting the most out of it.\n\nSo no, RB isn’t outracing the Red Bull, it’s just Liam’s going to take a lot more time and effort to get used to it.', ""It's just the first Q, relax. We haven't even raced yet."", 'Not Yuki stated he got a tow from Lando with definitely helped with his final lap time the VCARB miles worse than the RB. Lawson just isn’t that good of driver which makes the RB look slower than it should be.']",0,59,0.44,0,374,374,0,0,0.0,0
