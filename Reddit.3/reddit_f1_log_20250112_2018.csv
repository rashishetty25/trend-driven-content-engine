1hzm2mw,My Childhood F1 Board Game - from 1978!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hzm2mw/my_childhood_f1_board_game_from_1978/,2025-01-12, Throwback,"Recently found my childhood F1 board game, and thought you guys might enjoy it! I think the ‚ÄúBrief Idea of the Game‚Äô is well worth a read, because dice are not used to determine distance moved. It is for each played to decide how much to accelerate/decelerate, and still make the corner(!). Pit cards & tactical cards provide a further element of risk/reward. Tire & brake wear are significant factors, and are tracked via each player‚Äôs steering wheel indicators.
