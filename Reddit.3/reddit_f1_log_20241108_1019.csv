Same thing for ints, if wets weren't used, but someone bolts on ints, the whole race is 'int'. Otherwise it's 'dry'. But I can't correlate the data between the weather conditions, the tires and any red flags that occurred (e.g. it may have been heavy rain for half of the race, but the red flags may have occurred in the dry, for all I know). However:\n\nIn the last four years (2021-2024):  \n\\- There were seven GPs that had at least one red flag when only dry tires were used  \n\\- There were two GPs that had at least one red flag when ints were used at some point  \n\\- There were four GPs that had at least one red flag when wets were used at some point  \n\\- There were five GPs that had NO red flags, but where ints were used  \n\\- There was one GP that had NO red flags, but where wets were used\n\nSo yeah, statistically 4/5 times that the wet tires were used there was a red flag during that GP.  \nAnd 5/7 times that the int tires were used, there was a red flag during the GP.  \nSo 9/12 times that drivers moved off of the dry tires, there has indeed been a red flag (3/4s of the time). But that's 9/19 times that a red flag was shown in a GP in total (less than half), so how much the wet weather tires contribute to red flags is hard to interpret.
