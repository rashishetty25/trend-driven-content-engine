I did this to show the performance throughout the season. The higher up the line is on the graph, the higher finishing position the driver had. This is designed to show when the drivers have had good runs of form and also dips in there results. The first 4 races are just an average of all the races up until that point as a 5 race average is not possible. e.g. the ""average"" for Australia is just the race results for that race as there was no previous races. This graph also does not take sprint races into account and only the drivers' Grand Prix finishing position. DNFs are counted as the drivers' classified position. e.g. I put Lando down as P18 in canada as he was the last car to DNF but Oscar P20 in Azerbaijan as he DNFed on the first lap 

Lando in the dark orange had a very good start to the season winning the opening round. His average tailed off slightly losing the lead for the champion to Oscar after the Saudi Arabian GP. His results then stayed around the same until Spain where they dropped off heavily after a DNF in Canada. His average was then down after that race as even though he was getting podiums, the DNF skewed his average. This is then compounded by the DNF in the Dutch GP after which he hasn't got a win since.

Oscar didn't have a great start to the season finishing P9 in Australia but his performances picked up and as he won the next race in China, After which he only finished off the podium once up until Azerbaijan where he DNFed and has not got on the podium since which as brought down his average significantly.

Max had a good start to the season but his average finish was slowly declining until is dramatically dropped off after he was taken out by Kimi Antonelli on the first lap in Austria. His average then stayed low until the Italian GP after which it has been on a sharp incline. This shows that his form in recent races has picked up and that his is now closing the gap to Lando and Oscar in the championship.","['The hungry grand prix, yummy', 'Piastri completely dominated the European stretch in the middle of the season. \n\nYou can see the DNFs for Max at Austria, Norris at Canada, and Piastri at Baku.  \n\nWhat a tear Max has been on since Monza.', ""I don't think you should be counting the races where they didn't finish towards an average FINISHING position stat imo. \n\nAnd if you're talking about their CLASSIFIED position, then you shouldn't be counting Piastri's DNF in Baku and Verstappen's in Austria, as neither was classified."", 'If Max loses the Championship this year by less than 9 points, he‚Äôs going to regret that bone headed decision to crash into George in Spain.', 'How did Lando‚Äôs go so low?

And that even though Verstappen beat Clark in 5 of the 6 metrics. Clark leads Verstappen only in the relative championship lead, since he beat championship ""rival"" Graham Hill with 73 to 29 points, and so had Clark 152% the points of Hill in comparison to Verstappen's 101.8% lead to Teammate Sergio Perez.

Numbers for Win %, % of HPP, Avg. Finish, % Points Lead and % Podium come from the respective Wikipedia articles for the F1 championships from 1950 to 2024.  
Numbers for Laps Lead % come from [statsf1.com](http://statsf1.com) .

HPP stands for Highest Possible Points, so how many points you'd have if you won every race of the season.

The Numbers for the Average Finishing Position were calculated as following:

* Getting the Average of all Grand Prix Finishing Positions,
* Multiplying that Average by 10,
* Subtracting that number from 100.
