There was a two-week enforced holiday, as required by Formula 1 regulations. The premier class of motorsport returns to Zandvoort this weekend, which is why operations in Milton Keynes have resumed in recent days.\n\nNew team boss Laurent Mekies in particular has had a busy few days, as the Frenchman wanted to make the most of the time. ‘He has familiarised himself with the team, looked at the structures and staff,’ reveals motorsport boss Helmut Marko. Hardly a stone was left unturned after Christian Horner's dismissal. ‘In the medium term, we are working on a kind of decentralisation. The individual departments will have their own boss, who will then report to Laurent on the whole.’\n\nThe focus of the RB team boss will be on racing, although he will continue to have overall responsibility. Nevertheless, the individual roles of the department heads at Red Bull changed after Horner's dismissal. ‘The RB17 project is headed by Rob Gray, for example, and the engine department by Ben Hodgkinson. They were given a little more responsibility for their areas. This allows Mekies to concentrate more on the racing team. There has already been progress because he is simply an excellent engineer.’\n\nRejection of Alex Palou\nThere has been no progress on the driver market yet. By the end of October, those responsible want to make a decision on who will sit alongside Max Verstappen in the number one team and what the Racing Bulls duo will be called next year. Rookie Isack Hadjar has been a ‘positive surprise’ so far, and everything is going well with Formula 2 talent Arvid Lindblad. ‘We are right on schedule. He is fully integrated and will get several more opportunities with us this year.’\n\nThere is absolutely ‘no truth’ to the rumours that Red Bull is in negotiations with American IndyCar driver Alex Palou. ‘That's not true.’ However, the car's setup should be right again this weekend at the Dutch Grand Prix. The world championships are out of reach, so the goal for the rest of the season is clear: ‘We want to finish as far ahead as possible, but it's hard to say whether victories are possible.’ Cadillac is likely to take a similar approach for its entry next year. According to Marko, the US manufacturer has ‘chosen the conservative route’ with Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez. ‘You know what you've got.’ The Graz native has praise for his former driver from Mexico. ‘I spoke to him on the phone and he's motivated. If he's motivated and the car is right, then he'll certainly be back to the level he once was.’\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)"", 'Obligatory Fuck Helmut Marko, all my homies hate Helmut Marko', ""I'm not sure why anyone thought this was a serious possibility"", 'Saying there are no negotiations with Palou is so funny because the original article suggested nothing of the sort.', 'Palou is Spanish not American', 'Hear me out...
