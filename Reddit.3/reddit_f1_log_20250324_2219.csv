Let’s assume that Verstappen is (say) three tenths quicker than Lawson at this moment, intrinsically. Then add that this car is so difficult to drive that Lawson is yet to extract 3 tenths out of the car. Because he is driving this car both under and over the limit, the tyres are not in the right window, add an extra 3 tenths to that. So now you are facing almost a second of lap time difference between Verstappen and Lawson, and only three tenths of that gap is down to raw speed. The rest is about Lawson not being comfortable in the car. I know it’s just an estimate, but I don’t think that reality is vastly different. Theoretically the Red Bull is faster than the Racing Bull, but a confident Lawson in a Racing Bull is faster than a struggling Lawson in a Red Bull.\n\n>I get that the people at Red Bull say that the car is fastest the way it is set up now, but that seems a moot point if the driver is not able to extract that potential. I don’t understand that Red Bull cannot set up the second car more to Lawson’s liking (or Perez, Albon and Gasly before him). Maybe the car will be 2 tenths slower in theory, but according to my raw calculation above, a confident Lawson driving on the limit is 6 tenths faster than he is now.

1jipjgq,Ferrari in China hit rock bottom while the enigma of the SF-25 is revealed,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jipjgq/ferrari_in_china_hit_rock_bottom_while_the_enigma/,2025-03-24, News,,"['Focus on 2026 with immediate effect', 'If it’s truly the rear suspension design being inherently too soft and/or the new gear casing being too brittle to take the loads if the suspension is set to being harder, then Ferrari is completely done for the season, as neither change is something you can do fast, or even do at all without a chassis redesign.\n\nBy the way, article is signed by the three big names: Giuliano Duchessa, Piergiuseppe Donadoni, Rosario Giuliana - pretty much the closest we’ll get to an open admission bar a full-on statement by a team member.\n\nEdit: really the only hope is that with more kilometres racked up they might be able to find a setup that “clicks”, and that’s where Serra’s experience will be huge, but man it’s not looking good if they still got caught out by it on a super smooth track like China after the resurfacing.', 'Not the start of the season I expected, not the momentum being carried from 2024 that I too expected.\n\nThat seems like something that may not be fixed easily,...I don\'t know at the very least they must have a compliant car for the races (by that I mean a design that doesn\'t degrade the plank too much or the tyres) and that cannot wait as it would make them lose a lot of championship points and thus money AND hurt Ferrari\'s image like hell.\n\nI don\'t know how fast they can fix the rear design, depending on that complex answer, for sure, they would need to choose between an ""all in"" on 2026 or fixing their season if they believe a P2 or P3 in championship is reachable', 'Translation:\n\nMcLaren put the weekend back in place by dominating the Shanghai Grand Prix, while Ferrari got lost after a promising start, closing with a sensational double disqualification. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were able to easily control the pace of the pursuers, no one had the pace to create great concerns. The degradation was under control on each compound, Andrea Stella confirmed that by monitoring the Stroll pace (departed with the hard) “we realized that a stop was the option to perform”. Haas also benefited from a winning strategy, diversifying and adapting to the conditions.\n\nVerstappen had an ineffective start but at least he was able to return to the distance, the RB21 seems a distant relative of the previous cars. Russell tried to stay around the cars of Woking with a good texture.\n\nThe Ferraris went close to disaster at the first corner, Leclerc fought well with a broken wing, despite a balance damage quantified in 2/3 tenths. For a long phase he could have been better than the seven-time English champion, which shows how well Hamilton’s settings had gone out of the window with high load.\n\nYet the worst was yet to come. The SF-25 remains a car with unknown reactions in terms of long run. From the sprint stars to the stables of the Fia sentence an hour and a half after the race. The inspectors of the Federation measured the cars and found them non-compliant. Leclerc’s SF-25 was disqualified for less than one net weight, Lewis Hamilton’s number 44 for excessive shoe wear that protects the bottom. As well as the Alpine of Gasly the riders have been removed from the standings. The rules in terms of compliance are not questionable and it has already happened that an auto-Venturi was found with excessive consumption of the underbody however suffering a double disqualification is an unacceptable episode for any team. In both cases, Ferrari cannot have benefited in terms of performance, they are both serious but venial errors, the adjustments are simply not working in the long race, unlike the sprint. This could not go unnoticed on a smooth track as the Chinese one is currently.\n\nTHE TECHNICIANS HAVE DISCOVERED THE ENIGMA THAT FOR THE OBSERVERS STARTED BY THE BAHRAIN TESTS.\nAS FAR AS I LEARNED, THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW DESIGN OF THE FRONT PULL ROD SUSPENSION, MUCH LESS WITH THE AERODYNAMICS IN THE STRICT SENSE SINCE IT IS COMPLYING WITH THE STABILITY REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe extra consumption of the plank is not a cause but a consequence. The structure of the rear air does not allow the expected stiffness, which obliges you to increase the height in a closed park to protect yourself with 100kg on board. The main clue is the rear suspension, approved in July last year, together with the new gearbox.\nThe Haas shares the mechanical parts and worked well after the Australian disaster, however it does not have the performance loading platform or the sophisticated Ferrari aerodynamics. In other words, the SF-25 struggles with the excessive softness that is compromising its operation. It looks like something already seen, for example, on the old Mercedes last year. The Red in the right conditions can generate much more load than the previous car, the sprint showed what the car could do with 35 kg of gasoline. The qualification after three hours canceled expectations again, less downforce in the curve and greater instability of the rear.\n\nLoic Serra arrived in October so relatively late on project 677. The French DT has returned to Maranello and is intervening to correct its effectiveness and reliability but clearly it is premature to formulate a solution or its timing. The problem is not easy to solve, the engineers are also working on some update areas that should be introduced new parts from Bahrain.', ""Season is cooked. A situation where you can't even run the car properly without consequence is a fatal flaw. Impossible to fight for a championship like this."", 'Knew it had to be the rear since haas didnt switch to the same front layout but they do get the rear end from ferrari.', 'How do you end up in this kind of mess at the last year of regulation?', ""I will give Ferrari credit for taking a risk by bringing a new car for the last season of a regulation change. It is easy to criticize them, but they must have thought their previous car had reach it's celling.\n\nI am not going to write things off completely this season.

The consistency with which they adapt to ever-changing track conditions, car balance, and tire strategies is almost superhuman, especially for drivers with highly sensitive setup preferences.

Given the massive financial stakes involved—tens of millions for teams and potentially billions in sponsorships and branding—it’s hard not to wonder just how rigorous the FIA’s anti-doping protocols truly are. Are they genuinely strict, or is there a level of willful ignorance when it comes to substances that boost cognitive endurance and reaction times?

Also, a physiological observation: post-race footage often shows drivers with injected, bloodshot sclerae and facial flushing—classic signs of heightened sympathetic nervous system activity, catecholamine surges, or even potential stimulant use. Of course, this could just be from adrenaline and dehydration… but could it be something more pharmacological?

Personally I think that Max’s set up is a factor but perhaps not to the same degree that some people argue.\xa0\nI also think for example that Verstappen would have likely put more than two tenths on Hadjar Im China qualifying if both were in Racing Bulls. Thus Max would have set a faster time in the Racing Bull.\xa0\n\nThere is also the argument to consider that Verstappen could also make set up changes to suit him on the Racing Bull which would make it faster for him. \xa0\nSo overall I would say that in qualifying pace Max would set faster times were he in the Racing Bull. Race pace is harder to say because there is usually a bigger gap between Max and the Racing Bulls. In fact race pace has been Red Bull’s big strength since the new ground effect era began in 2022.\xa0\nEither way it would be so interesting to see and it would be very telling about the performance of the two cars and Max himself’s talents (Were he to jump into the Racing Bull and put a huge gap on Yuki and Hadjar, people could no longer argue Max is only good because he sets up his car so his team mate can’t drive it.\xa0', 'Does George Russel have a genuine shot at the driver championship if Mercedes bring the right upgrades?', 'Would you rather fight a 100 duck-sized Yukis or 100 Yuki-sized ducks?', 'Gentlemen, a short view back to the past.

Despite all the well-deserved criticism the F1TV app gets, I love watching old race recaps. The archive is a real treasure trove of long-forgotten F1 moments. I started with the 1989 season and, after many, many hours of watching, I’ve just begun the 2010 season.

There’s something so charming about those old recaps. They’re like a mini race documentary series. They featured insights about the circuit, weekend events so far, interviews, commentary on current rumors, the starting grid, and sometimes even more. They also provide important historical context.

Today’s race recaps, by comparison, feel so dull and cheaply made with the spliced up OG commentary. It genuinely hurts. Especially thinking ahead a few years, rewatching a season will give you just the race, instead of a holistic view of everything happening at the time: the drama, the fashion, the old tech, and so on.

Anybody else feel the same?",['What are these videos called in the service? I remember starting the 70s and they had a whole season review/recap.

""My dad actually used to promise me every year that he would take me to the Singapore Grand Prix, and in the end, we never went, but he's going to be coming to the Grand Prix this weekend, so actually I'm taking him!""

https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/liam-lawsons-rocky-road-to-f1-my-parents-sold-their-house-so-i-could-keep-racing/10658101/

But to get there in the first place, Lawson revealed his parents made a huge sacrifice. ""My parents and my whole family really gave a lot, especially in the early years through go-karts,"" Lawson told Red Bull's Talking Bull podcast. *""My parents sold their house so that I could keep racing. It's massive. They gave absolutely everything for me to be able to race, even just go-karts because it's so expensive.""*

Like McLaren's Oscar Piastri, who lived in boarding school in the UK as a teenager while trying to forge a racing career, Lawson's perseverance was severely tested while 11,000 miles from home. But that early sacrifice often proves a formative experience for the Australian and Kiwi drivers that do make it across and provides them with the steel and grit to survive in F1's often difficult environment.

""I didn't finish high school or anything,"" Lawson shared. ""Honestly, I was just excited to be able to go and chase my dream. And there are always hard parts about it, but there was never a question of whether it was too difficult and I wanted to go home.""

But while he showed promise by finishing second in his first season in Europe, Lawson didn't get picked up by an F1 junior academy right away, and he headed back home to New Zealand's famed Toyota Winter Series without a plan after that, and with his F1 dream on the verge of already being shattered at the age of 17.

""Being from New Zealand, trying to get the money to compete overseas is really, really hard,"" Lawson recalled. ""So, between a group of amazing people that have been behind me, sponsors and investors, we set up the structure to get enough money to go to Europe and do a season and try and get recognised by a junior team, because without it, there was no chance to get a Formula 1.

""I had a good season, but I didn't have any call-ups from any teams. And then I just did this championship in New Zealand's over the off-season, with no plan of what I was doing in 2019.""As a kid being into Formula 1, I would watch this series every single year and I dreamed of driving it. And to me, it was like the Formula 1 of racing at the time.""

Fortunately for Lawson, talent scouts were watching the opening round of the 2019 Toyota Racing Series. And not just any scout, but Red Bull's Helmut Marko, who was keeping tabs on Lawson's older team-mate Lucas Auer, who was part of the Red Bull junior programme at the time.

And even before he would go on to beat Auer, and fellow Kiwi Marcus Armstrong to the title, Lawson would get the news he dreamed of for so long.

""I guess Helmut was watching because of Lucas and I had a really good first weekend,"" he said. ""When I raced in F4 in Europe, Jack Doohan was a Red Bull junior at the time and we tested together somewhere. I remember seeing him walking around in his Red Bull suit and I remember thinking how cool it would be to be a Red Bull junior.

""And I got the call-up after that first weekend in New Zealand, I found out one or two days after the weekend. I was sitting in a cafe - I remember exactly where I was sitting. I got told and it was obviously pretty emotional. I basically got picked up at the perfect time and it saved my career. I had those four weeks left of that championship, and then I had no plan after that...""

Lawson then plied his trade in FIA F3 and F2, going head-to-head with Piastri, dovetailing his single-seater activities with a Red Bull-backed stint aboard a Ferrari GT3 car in the German DTM sportscar championship, that yielded him a runner-up spot.

Finishing third in the 2022 F2 championship landed him a Red Bull reserve role alongside a Japanese Super Formula campaign for 2023, and when Ricciardo broke his wrist in Dutch Grand Prix practice Lawson got the nod to deputise for the Australian for the next five rounds.

In typical Red Bull fashion, it was sink or swim for Lawson, but he kept his head cool and scored points in the extremely challenging Singapore Grand Prix.

Lawson's cameo performances complicated matters for Red Bull in the short term, with Yuki Tsunoda and Ricciardo still getting the nod over Lawson to start the 2024 season while Lawson returned to a reserve role.

But what Red Bull was really looking for in a driver for the renamed RB team is someone who could be a future Red Bull driver. And with it becoming clear Ricciardo isn't ticking all those boxes any more, it has handed Lawson the opportunity to battle Tsunoda for a Red Bull berth.

Following his family's sacrifice to give him a fighting chance, and Red Bull noticing him just when he was approaching a dead-end street, claiming a Red Bull seat would be the third miracle on Lawson's rocky road to the top.

1jj1bnm,Lawson's speed compared to Tsunoda,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj1bnm/lawsons_speed_compared_to_tsunoda/,2025-03-24, Statistics,"As yet another driver is struggling in the second Red Bull seat, narratives seem to be running wild that take some liberties with the nuances of formula 1. Particularly the ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"" narrative.


USA sprint - Lawson 0,029s faster  
USA - Lawson 0,456s faster  
Mexico - Tsunoda 0,033s faster  
Brazil sprint - Lawson 0,545s faster  
Brazil - Tsunoda 0,373s faster  
Las Vegas - Tsunoda 1,438s faster  
Qatar sprint - Lawson 0,017s faster  
Qatar - Tsunoda 0,047s faster  
Abu Dhabi - Tsunoda 0,053s faster

That means that although Tsunoda beat Lawson in qualifying last year, he was on average only 0,099s faster. Translate that to this year's Australian Grand Prix, and that difference still results in p19. Translate that to China, and you're still only looking at p18 in sprint/p19 in gp instead of p20.


Now don't get me wrong, the point of this post isn't to say Yuki Tsunoda didn't deserve that second Red Bull seat, or that he wouldn't have done (slightly) better. I think there's good reason to believe Yuki's experience could have made a difference. However, let's make that point based on good arguments and wipe bad arguments off the table; bad arguments such as ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"".","[""I don't think you can simply take their results from a different car and apply them to the current car, even though we're still in the same broad regulations.

The Racing Bulls car probably has less oversteer by nature and is closer to a balanced drive. Max by nature needs an oversteering car because that's how he naturally drives. He subscribes to the theory that less steering angle means more speed, so he wants a very oversteering car so that he can easily turn the car by releasing the brake too quick or getting on the gas too quickly. In other works, a balanced car like the Racing Bulls car would feel slower to turn than the Red Bull.\n\nIt's like giving a pro gamer a low sensitivity mouse.

1jij2ac,Is Social Media Putting Undue Pressure On Teams To Make Driver Changes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jij2ac/is_social_media_putting_undue_pressure_on_teams/,2025-03-24, Discussion,"I'd like to think that F1 teams aren't easily swayed by public sentiment in regard to how they run their driver lineups. But over the last few years it's become evident that they do, at the very minimum, see quite a bit of the social media comments and reactions to anything surrounding F1. Particularly when it comes to anything having to do with drivers. The most recent example of this being the current situation with Liam Lawson who is only 2 races into this season with people calling for him to be replaced by Yuki Tsunoda. And it seems that this motion is starting to gain traction. I don't know if this is naive or not but it doesn't seem fair to Liam that people who aren't in the team or who race the car should be able to put pressure on his team to replace him. I feel like as a young driver he should be allowed to develop like drivers are supposed to. And part of me has been wondering how much of that pressure to make changes it influenced or exacerbated by social media.

Edit: Okay, learning very quickly that F1 teams have just been utterly ruthless the whole time. For whatever reason I thought that drivers were able to stay with teams longer than they do now.
