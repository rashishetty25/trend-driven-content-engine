He did an interview where he basically said Lewis is not even a 7 time champion, Michael should hold that record. Here\'s the exact quote: \n\n>""I still feel sorry for Massa today. He won the final at his home race in Sao Paulo, did everything right. He was cheated out of the title he deserved, while Hamilton had all the luck in the world and won his first championship. Today, I would have handled things differently. That\'s why, for me, Michael Schumacher is still the sole record world champion. Even if the statistics say otherwise.""\n\nHe then went on to describe how he and Mosely knew about Crashgate sooner than previously known. \n\nAnd since this interview was published in 2023, Bernie has said: 1) he didn\'t remember doing the interview, and then 2) okay he did the interview but the reporter is German and misunderstood his English. Not mentioning he\'s given lots of interviews to that reporter in the past.', 'And yet, despite his cheating, Flavio is back in F1.', "">He isn‚Äôt explicitly seeking to overturn the results, but he is seeking over $80 million in damages, among other matters. Additionally, Massa is seeking ‚Äúa declaration that the FIA acted in breach of its own regulations in failing to promptly investigate the circumstances of the crash in 2008‚Äù as well as ‚Äúa declaration that if the FIA had not acted in breach of its own regulations, it would have cancelled or adjusted the results of the Singapore Grand Prix with the consequence that Massa would have won the drivers‚Äô championship in 2008.‚Äù\n\nJust putting this here because there's already people saying he's trying to change the result and that he's suing Hamilton/McLaren."", 'I don‚Äôt know enough about lawsuits to know if he has a case, but I fully understand that he‚Äôs giving it a shot. Bernie knowing Piquets crash was intentional but not doing anything about it is honestly quite disgraceful and a monetary compensation feels like the least Felipe deserves', 'Huge news for f1 podcasts', 'For me the main point of this is that the FIA had proff of wrong doing in time for the Ferrari to contest the race and they chose to hide it, therefore failing in their duty.\n\n\nWe dont know what kind of result should be valid from the Singapure GP and Felipe was robbed of his chance to find it out.\xa0\nGiven what was at stake he might be entlitled for compensation.', ""Even under earlier goals, I don't think under any logic you could declare the entirety of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix invalid even if a decision was taken back in 2008. At the very most, Renault could have been disqualified from the 2008 Singapore Grand prix with Alonso losing his win but to Massa that would have meant that Hamilton would have been classified as 2nd, making Hamilton win the championship by 3 points over Massa which of course would be against Massa's interests. It would also retroactively take away the dramatic moment of Hamilton passing Glock for 5th place as he'd have only needed to finish 7th (the same position finished to lose out on the 2007 championship).\n\nUnder the above logic, I don't think you could reward Massa compensation for this. Plus, fuel hose could have still got stuck anyway in a normal pit stop. Had it not got stuck and Massa finished in the points then sure, he may have become the champion by Brazil, but that's not on Renault or the FIA."", 'I would like to point out the complete stupidity of this case\n\nFirst off lets discuss Bernie as an unreliable witness. Its important to note that Bernie‚Äôs claim That he found out about crash gate in Brazil and the right thing to do was cancel the Singapore result completely but they covered it up, was first made by Bernie in I believe 2022/2023 to a  Journalist\n\nThe date is important here as it is after the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi result and subsequent FIA report that effectively said Hamilton was robbed of a World championship due to FIA mistakes .\n\nBernie hates Hamilton, he hates his liberal views and his stance to Human rights issues in places like Saudia Arabia. So it‚Äôs well within Bernies modus operandi to suddenly come up with a story that  delegitimizes one of Hamilton‚Äôs existing championships at a time when the Abu Dhabi controversy is still ringing high. if you read the Bernie interview the quote comes from there is a lot of Hamilton bashing\n\nWhat I am saying is Bernie lied because he did not like the near universal sentiment (that Hamilton was robbed) that Hamilton was receiving for 2021\n\nThat‚Äôs why, now there is a court case, Bernie is now backtracking and saying he can‚Äôt even remember saying it ‚Äì because it‚Äôs a load of baloney \xa0\n\nSecondly there is the fact that nowhere in any of the regulations or statutes does it say that invalidating an entire race and removing the results & points is the correct response to a deliberate crash like this. Bernie has plucked this from his own A\\*se.\n\nthe correct thing to do was disqualify Alonso ‚Äì which I would argue they should have done when it came to light ‚Äì Ironically this would give Hamilton even more points relative to Massa.\n\nIn Jerez 97 Schumacher deliberately crashed into Villeneuve ‚Äì Schumacher was disqualified ‚Äì but the race result still stands to this day.\n\nFinally lets note that the Staged crash by Renault did not intentionally or unintentionally benefit Lewis. To anyone outside of Renault the crash was as random and unexpected as a normal crash and affected Massa and Hamilton in the exact same way, in that they HAD to pit when the safety car came in\n\nHowever when they pitted one pit crew executed a flawless pitstop and one Pit crew majorly f\\*\\*ked up with Massa driving off with a fuel hose attached and this is what ruined his race', ""Massa's case is based purely on Bernie Ecclestone claiming that there's a regulation stipulating that the only course of action would have been to void the race but this claim by Ecclestone is absolutely baseless. He completely made it up and then denied he made this statement when he was asked about it again. The reality is that, if anything, an argument about simply disqualifying the team that cheated is the most appropriate action rather than taking points away from all the teams that didn't cheat.\xa0Piquet crashing had zero direct impact on the title fight between Hamilton and Massa. He literally kept his lead over Hamilton after the crash and only lost his lead over Hamilton because his team made a mistake that all the other teams did not make at the pitstop. You can't punish all the teams that didn't cheat for one team cheating just because you messed up which is essentially what Massa's is asking for here. If instead\xa0Ferrari didn't make that error then Massa would have kept his advantage over Hamilton and he wouldn't care at all about voiding the race.\xa0There were also 3 races left in the championship fight after Singapore so everything was still left to race for\xa0and, if anything, Spa 2008 was the biggest miscarriage of justice that year.\xa0\n\n\nAlso, if we are to use Bernie Ecclestone's own words then we should include everything he has said like the fact that, along with FIA President Max Mosley, they both actively helped Ferrari win so maybe we should consider disqualifying Ferrari from both the 2007 and 2008 championships when he was at the helm. Funny how Massa only selectively chooses to acknowledge what Bernie has said though.\xa0"", 'Paywall üôÉ\n\nLink in general message worked! Legend']",757,293,0.96,757,263,263,188,57,0.0,188

In 2022, the FIA‚Äôs audit found that Red Bull had exceeded the cost cap in 2021 by 1.6 percent, resulting in a $7million fine and the team losing a chunk of its wind tunnel test time for the following season.\n\nThe wait for the 2024 results to be approved led to speculation in Mexico that there could be a possible breach beyond Aston Martin. In the last two years, when all 10 teams complied with the regulations, the FIA announced the results in September.\n\nBut in a statement issued on Tuesday, the FIA confirmed that nine teams were found to be in full compliance with the financial regulations, with the only exception being Aston Martin‚Äôs minor procedural breach.\n\nThe FIA‚Äôs Cost Cap Administration (CCA), which completes the review of all team 10s, stated the Aston Martin had ‚Äúnot exceeded the cost cap level, and that the Procedural Breach was of a very minor nature, originated by unpredictable circumstances outside the control of the F1 team.‚Äù\n\n[As reported by\xa0*The Athletic*\xa0last week](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6746459/2025/10/24/aston-martin-f1-cost-cap-minor-breach/), Aston Martin still had to enter an Accepted Breach Agreement (ABA) with the FIA to recognize its late submission which resulted from extenuating circumstances beyond the team‚Äôs control.\n\nAs the team did not look to gain any advantage through the procedural breach, the CCA agreed these were mitigating factors and decided to award no sanction. Aston Martin will have to cover the administrative costs to prepare the ABA.\n\nBesides the 10 teams, all five F1 power unit manufacturers were found to have complied with their own regulations.\n\nIn its statement, the FIA said reviewing the teams‚Äô submissions was a ‚Äúparticularly time consuming considering both the complexities of the Financial Regulations and the necessity to assess technical aspects (and related cost treatment) of activities of development undertaken by F1 teams and power unit manufacturers.‚Äù\n\nLast week in Mexico, when asked about the length of the delay and the possibility of a breach by a rival team, Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur said it was ‚Äúnot a big deal‚Äù to have the results announced this late.\n\n‚ÄúWe have to trust the FIA that they are doing their job,‚Äù Vasseur said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs not an easy one, honestly. But we also have to avoid making any speculation or rumors. That would be a mistake.‚Äù\n\nSauber team principal Jonathan Wheatley was with Red Bull as its sporting director when it was found to have breached the cost cap, and said it was a ‚Äúvery, very difficult thing to balance‚Äù for teams.\n\n‚ÄúYou want to be competitive,‚Äù Wheatley said. ‚ÄúYou want to spend every last dollar up against your cost cap limit, of course you do.

","[""Lando's race performance has been excellent this season outside of the crash in Canada and his several mistakes in Spa.

You make it look like Oscar has done a horrible job for most of the year yet he was leading in the last 6 months.', 'Worth noting Piastri was dominant at Hungary (which is within that sequence) but was beaten in the race by Norris only because McLaren put Norris on a ""let\'s see if we can rescue something"" one-stopper that paid off. From memory Piastri made the point to his engineer in that race that he wasn\'t happy his strategy was being dictated by covering Leclerc and not Norris. Had Piastri been given the same strategy as Norris, that would be a Piastri win.\n\nThink it\'s also worth remembering we\'ve just been through a sequence of circuits that Piastri was poor at last year as well. Stella has said he thinks it\'s a driver style issue, where Piastri\'s style doesn\'t suit low grip circuits as well as Norris\' (with the reverse also true; Piastri is better in high grip).

He‚Äôs definitely doing worse but I feel people are exaggerating how poorly he‚Äôs doing. Since the summer break Lando has definitely been doing better and it‚Äôs obvious since he took the lead back. 

That being said Oscar still won in the Netherlands and finished on the podium in a race Max was always going to win I feel with how much better his car this season is on straights. In Azerbaijan yes he made plenty of mistakes and while they are reflective on his performance they aren‚Äôt reflective on how fast he‚Äôs been that being said it‚Äôs still his worst race of the season. Singapore he qualified ahead of Lando and though I do think Lando‚Äôs move was a bit stupid seeing how close he got to Oscar it‚Äôs a racing incident and there‚Äôs nothing McLaren should have done about it. Despite that Oscar still finished in p4 only dropping one place not amazing but not horrible. 

Austin I‚Äôll admit was another poor race especially with his collision with Lando and Hulkenberg in the sprint (though I personally feel sprints are a place where you make higher risks since there‚Äôs less you lose out on. Still a stupid move) in Mexico he once again hasn‚Äôt qualified greatly but I personally feel he did the best with what he was given. He could have overtaken Ollie in the end but with the circumstances of the race it definitely made it harder. These last two races especially I think are what we need to look at and in comparison to how he did at them last year he hasn‚Äôt improved much but also hasn‚Äôt gotten any worse. In Austin he finished in the same place (which isn‚Äôt as impressive considering how much faster he should be and how much faster his car should be) in Mexico he finished ahead of where he did last year. These two tracks last year weren‚Äôt his best for him so it‚Äôs not entirely surprising to see him do worse

I also haven‚Äôt touched on the slow stops McLaren has been giving out to both drivers or any other controversies which I have no real opinion on. With that being said I do think his performance has obviously declined but mostly in the past two races the four before that his pace didn‚Äôt take as bad of a hit with Azerbaijan being the only race I‚Äôd call. Personally I wanted to make this post because while I do think Oscar has taken a hit people have been coming at him especially for certain comments where he‚Äôs said he doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the car or him and people obviously comparing his performance to Lando‚Äôs.

On Max‚Äôs onboard, we can see that Max hits the inside red sausage kerb located on the apex of the corner with his front right tire. This kerb is further inside the track of the normal red and white curb and it‚Äôs also much more pronounced. 

As a result of that impact Max loses control of the car and has to take corrective steering action. As he is sawing at the wheel, his front left makes contact with Lewis‚Äôs front right. 

How is this not in violation of the quoted section of the guidelines? 

If it is not a violation of the guideline, then it implies that as long as the car on the inside is first to apex, they cannot be deemed at fault for any incident. Further implying that any car attempting to defend their position on the outside of a corner, should concede immediately. The steward‚Äôs incident report pretty much confirmed this as they investigated Lewis for this contact and not Max. 

While I understand that the drivers voted for this, I simply don‚Äôt agree with it and it think it makes the racing product dull. 

I would much rather have something similar to what Indy car does. 

1) The defending car must be proactive and choose its line of defense. 

2) The attacking car is then responsible for carrying out a clean overtake. 

Sections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 of the Indycar rulebook can be found here: https://epaddock.indycar.com/docs/default-source/rules-regulations-and-policies/indycar-rulebook.pdf

Their rules are significantly more clear and I feel that they allow for far more exciting racing than what we currently have in F1. They are also more in line with what is the norm in other series and what is taught in most racing schools and lower level of competition.

I think it‚Äôs also time for F1 to have paid, professional and permanent stewards. Not only for consistency but more importantly, precedent. The best drivers on the grid, like Max, tend to push the line of what is acceptable in the rules and those rulings define how all drivers behave after. This leads to a degradation of driving standards over time and we continue to find ourselves in situations where we are changing the rules over and over. I feel like this is not too much to ask of a sport with a valuation in the 10+ billion dollar range. 
","['Verstappen could have been at fault if the speed he took would have meant that he was not staying on track which would have made his passing attempt invalid. The reality is that Verstappen was ahead by the apex and stopped on track but Hamilton turned into the apex when he no longer had the right of way which meant that they had a slight collision.\n\nAccording to the rules Hamilton should have taken a wider racing line and given the corner to Verstappen. It is pretty clear and the drivers have agreed to the rules.', '> I simply don‚Äôt agree with it and it think it makes the racing product dull.\n\nSo you find races with only DRS passes more exciting?', 'Don‚Äôt worry guys, OP doesn‚Äôt like how the rules work and is getting to the bottom of this.', ""The main issue was that Hamilton was caught off guard with the attempt, which didn't allow him to change his approach to the corner. He could have gone defensive and fully blocked the inside line at the cost of some lap time. He could have anticipated the dive with a wide line and more speed into the corner, taking the advantage in the next corner. As he didn't see the overtake coming, he took the normal racing line, but was already overtaken on the inside of turn 1. That caused him to be at a disadvantage in the next corner as it was on him to provide space for the leading driver.\n\nUltimately, both drivers lost out in the whole sequence. Hamilton would have lost much less if he let Verstappen pass after cutting t4 and t5."", ""IndyCar doesn't always have clean overtakes though if you've seen an IndyCar race that is not on an oval. There's a lot of argy bargy. As for the contact, that's just racing, Lewis did this far more egregiously in his younger years. No one complained. This is also far more prevalent in lower series like Karting. As the stewards stated if they were being consistent with other results in the past, this shouldn't deserve a pen.\n\n>it implies that as long as the car on the inside is first to apex, they cannot be deemed at fault for any incident\n\nYou'll come to learn that stewarding isn't fully based off the actions itself but the outcome. Remember Lawson and Sainz in Netherlands, the only reason he got a pen and Lewis didn't was because the collision ended with a puncture for both cars. The reason Checo didn't get a pen in Abu Dabi 21 and Lewis didn't in Abu Dabi 2016 for driving unreasonably slowly, Lewis didn't crash into him and Nico didn't crash into Lewis Mitigating circumstances. I wouldn't give a car a 10 second penalty just for a slight correction which lead to contact. Maybe if the slide was bigger, like Russell in Spain then I would give them a 10 second penalty.\n\nAlso in the same document you linked to, it shows the stewards literally take into consideration kerbs and the type of corner. This is the second page.\n\n>vii) Did the type of corner contribute to the incident? (e.g. camber, kerbs, curve, apexes)"", ""OP, I only know that you are not allowed to overtake outside the track.  \napart from that....racing guidlines are terrible, and its application even worse.  \ncurrently you don't need to leave a space at all if you are ahead of apex and that is very dangerous and stupid. you can push out other car out of the track without consequences if you are ahead of apex."", ""Because you're wrong. Max did it to push Lewis wider because it would have left Lewis on the track if he maintained that line which would have left him in a much better position to attack Max on the next corner  \n\nOne day Ferrari will invent mirrors and he will see Max coming.""]",0,10,0.29,0,7,7,0,0,0.0,0
