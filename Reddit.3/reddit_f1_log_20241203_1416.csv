1h5b012,Sergio Perez should not be remembered for the past two years. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5b012/sergio_perez_should_not_be_remembered_for_the/,2024-12-03, Discussion,"
Yes, I know it‚Äôs extremely more easy to dunk on Sergio Perez right now, I‚Äôve been extremely guilty of that. The last two seasons (2023 and 2024) have been quite honestly, beyond awful.  But I think people are forgetting just how good Perez was in the midfield for almost a decade before joining Red Bull.

From his debut in 2011 with Sauber, it was clear Checo had talent beyond the normal pay driver. Who can forget his incredible drive to 2nd place in Malaysia 2012, almost beating Fernando Alonso in a vastly inferior car? Or his podiums that season in Canada and Monza? That year put him on the radar of the entire paddock and got him a seat at McLaren in 2013‚Äîa team that, unfortunately, was on the decline.

But after McLaren, he rebuilt his career at Force India/Racing Point, becoming the king of tire management. Perez consistently punched above his weight, dragging those midfield cars to results they had no business achieving. Baku 2016 was absolutely brilliant in my opinion. 

But his victory in Sakhir 2020 was a masterclass in perseverance‚Äîfalling to the back of the grid after an early collision and still winning the race. That win alone cemented his place as one of the most reliable and clever midfield drivers of the 21st century so far.

It‚Äôs sad to see how his time at Red Bull has overshadowed all of that.. But let‚Äôs not forget the Sergio Perez who kept the likes of Force India alive, paid the team members salaries when they went into administration, was renowned for saving tires that not many others could do (Portugal 2021) , and who delivered consistent results year after year when it mattered most.

It feels like people only remember the bad moments and have erased the years of brilliance he brought to F1‚Äôs midfield. Checo deserved his chances in a top team, even if in the end, it hasn‚Äôt worked out the way anyone hoped.

Whatever happens from here, I‚Äôll always respect Sergio Perez for what he achieved before Red Bull. He was the midfield driver of the 2010s, and that‚Äôs a legacy worth remembering.","['Checo and Hulk will always be the two absolute best midfield drivers of the past decade. They were brilliant together at Force India.', ""That's why his decline is so egregiously disappointing to me, really - I remember watching those early seasons at Sauber and thinking he had serious potential, definite race winner and maybe even a WDC. I thought the McLaren move was a season too soon though, he needed another year in the midfield before stepping into the pressure of a major team, and unfortunately not only was that true (in my view at least) but he joined them at the absolute worst possible time.\n\nIf you'd told me back then he'd end up at Red Bull I would've expected it to mean he was fighting for the title, and indeed early '22 it looked like he might have been, even in these recent years he kept a bit of a reputation for his brilliance around street circuits, it just makes it all the more dismal how far he's fallen, and how fast. We talk about drivers falling off the performance cliff but rarely has that cliff been so apparent, and it's largely because he came from very respectable heights."", 'He shouldn‚Äôt be, you‚Äôre correct but it will take a few years for the cream of his career to rise to the top in the fan bases memory', 'It‚Äôs a bit sad really because I don‚Äôt think you can blame an F1 driver for hanging on for as long as they can. It‚Äôs what they dedicate so much of their time and energy to do and I can‚Äôt imagine it is very easy to say, ‚ÄúI am clearly not as good as I used to be so I will leave now,‚Äù instead of them thinking, ‚ÄòI just need to get back in form, there‚Äôs still a chance to win, next year could be different,‚Äô etc. I bet for the bulk of them (as in, drivers who retire after a run of poor form), even when they aren‚Äôt enjoying themselves as much because of the constant poor performances and the endless criticism, they probably still love the sport and would not be able to easily come to terms with the fact that their last win is already behind them.', 'Most of us here know exactly how good Perez is when he\'s at his best. I mean, he didn\'t get the Red Bull seat in the first place because he was slinging it with the backmarkers. Many fans, myself included, were ecstatic when Checo got the seat a few years back because the dude was getting Force India/Racing Point into places it didn\'t belong.\n\nThe problem, however, is precisely that: when he\'s at his best, something he hasn\'t been for a *good* while now.\n\nAnd it has nothing to do with Max, at least not anymore. He\'s fallen into a slump that was partly justified earlier this year when Red Bull just...completely fell off a cliff. At that point it was like ""Oh, so this is what he\'s been dealing with? Max has just been...Alonso\'ing this turd into positions it probably doesn\'t belong in.""\n\nThen, Max continues to etch out performance after performance and Sergio is getting outqualified by Lance fucking Stroll.\n\nNah. \n\nYou have to remember the good and the bad, and unfortunately Sergio is firmly in the ""bad"" phase right now. Does it overshadow his prior performances? I\'d say absolutely not, but it has, at least in my opinion (which counts for naught in the grand scheme of things, let\'s be honest) certainly stained his legacy.', 'Maybe he should have left last year. \n\nI hate to say it...but he will be remembered for the last two years. His time at Sauber and Force India were brilliant. He was good enough for McLaren at one point. When they were still expected to be good. \n\nBut the theatrics of this year has just soured his legacy so bad.', 'I still remember Perez doing some giant killing in 2012 in that sauber. Funnily enough he was not a good qualifier even back then, he‚Äôd qualify behind kobayashi just outside the top 10 which allowed him to do some weird one stop shit which worked more times than it should have and netted him some crazy podiums.', 'But his performances also shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten, he had his time and now it‚Äôs over, it happens, he was a solid driver at certain times', ""I do agree, but when an athlete's decline drags on and on, and they don't retire, it's hard to not remember them for that. If Checo loses his seat and doesn't get another seat, that isn't him retiring because he knows it's time, it's because no one wanted to hire him. Checo would like to keep driving longer and has said that. He signed a two year contract extension that hasn't even started yet, and I believe he's indicated that he wanted to keep driving after that. At some point, the declining years are a significant portion of his legacy.""]",6710,707,0.87,6710,11066,11066,230,18,0.0,230

Team principal Fred Vasseur believes that his team did everything perfectly over the Lusail weekend and launches the challenge ahead of the Abu Dhabi GP that will close the season. In the press conference following the grand prix, the Frenchman returned to the strategy adopted in the race and then analyzed the possibilities of the Maranello team in view of the last appointment of the year.\n\n**VASSEUR: ‚ÄúTHE PLAN WAS TO GO EVEN LONGER AND IT WAS WELL EXECUTED‚Äù**\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about the fact that Ferrari was too conservative with its drivers, asking them to take care of keeping tires in the first dozen laps of the Qatar GP. Vasseur rejects the accusations, explaining that the puncture of Carlos Sainz and the subsequent Safety Car changed what were the initial expectations: ‚ÄúThe plan was to return even later, since on one car we did the pit-stop because it had a flat, while on the other because the Safety Car had entered the track. But the initial plan was to return even later. I think we will discuss the history of the VSC for a long time before or not, but the plan was to last longer and the reason for Carlos‚Äôs drilling is only the debris, not the excessive degradation‚Äù.\n\nThe Ferrari team principal believes that even in these conditions the drivers performed everything at their best: ‚ÄúThe initial conduct was too conservative if you know you have a Safety Car on lap 25, but the plan was to go a little longer than that and I think it was the right approach because when we decided to push from lap 12/15 the pace was there and I think we expected to do a long stint. Honestly the initial plan was executed very well by the two drivers and they did a great job‚Äù.\n\n**THE FINAL FLIGHT WITH THE MCLAREN**\n\nThe Qatar GP on paper was the most difficult appointment for Ferrari in this final triptych of races, but the course of the race allowed the Maranello team to shorten on the McLaren on the Manufacturers‚Äô ranking and at the same time Leclerc to arrive at only 8 lengths from Lando Norris. Vasseur underlines the positive surprise of this weekend, promising battle in the final appointment of Abu Dhabi: ‚ÄúWe would have signed before the weekend to score more points than McLaren. We are still alive for the championship and Charles is not far from Norris now. I also think that second place in the overall Pilots‚Äô standings is a good result. I‚Äôd rather have 20 points of advantage than 20 of offset, but let‚Äôs see. On paper I think the next circuit will probably be a little better for us. We fight until the last curve of the last lap‚Äù.\n\nFerrari will show up at Yas Marina with less pressure than McLaren, which instead has everything to lose. Vasseur explained that the Maranello team must continue to focus only on itself, as it has done so far: ‚ÄúIt is not a matter of pressure. The important thing is to do a good job and be fast, then we‚Äôll see. First of all you have to focus on yourself. We managed to make 1-2 on weekends during the season, we have to try to do our best to achieve this goal. But it‚Äôs true that even if we do 1-2, they can be champions. The most important thing is to focus on yourself, don‚Äôt start thinking about what others do. This weekend the approach was very good, because we stayed focused on our strategy without thinking too much about what McLaren or Red Bull were doing. It‚Äôs not said that we‚Äôll be in good shape next week in Abu Dhabi, but we‚Äôll have to put everything together. It‚Äôs always a challenge, but we will enter Abu Dhabi with enormous motivation‚Äù.\n\n**FAR FROM CONTROVERSY**\n\nThe result of the Qatar GP was strongly conditioned by the decisions of the Race Management. Vasseur believes that the discussions on the decisions taken by the stewards are nothing new: ‚ÄúIn the last 35 years of my life we have all always complained about the decision of the stewards and the Race Director. Maybe a little less with Charlie (Whiting) for different reasons. But it‚Äôs always been like that‚Äù.\nThe Ferrari team principal did not want to give a judgment either on the relegation of a position imposed on Max Verstappen on Saturday or on the 10-second stop&go set on Norris on Sunday: ‚ÄúHonestly, I haven‚Äôt even seen Saturday‚Äôs video, but it‚Äôs in the range of penalties to give a penalty position. Same for today, for Lando. It is at their discretion and they can impose this type of penalty. It certainly depends on the severity of the violation, if it was faster than the previous land in that mini sector, but it‚Äôs to allow me to focus on Abu Dhabi that I don‚Äôt want to start making controversy now. I‚Äôve tried to stay away from every single controversy throughout the season, I won‚Äôt start again before the last grand prix‚Äù.\n\nThe French manager also pushed away criticism about the performance of his next driver Lewis Hamilton in the second part of this season: ‚ÄúHamilton? Take a look at the 50 laps he did in Las Vegas starting tenth and finishing in the trail at Russell. I‚Äôm not worried at all‚Äù. The issue of Guanyu Zhou, approached Ferrari as a test driver next season and the protagonist of an excellent performance in Lusail where he finished eighth, was also liquidated in a few words: ‚ÄúZhou had a good race.

A huge setback for the team of Max Verstappen that was still so extremely dominant in 2023. According to Pierre Wache, however, it is not right to point the finger at the team with regard to the difficult season.\n\n>*The winter is coming and so it is time to look back with several prominent figures in Formula 1. During the Qatari Grand Prix we spoke with Pierre Wache, the technical director behind the car of Max Verstappen. Last year the Frenchman was praised, this year he received a lot of criticism because Red Bull Racing suddenly had a dominant car during the 2024. How was it for Wache to suddenly rarely win and did the totally dominant season of 2023 actually work as a ‚Äònithi for‚Äô in 2024?*\n\n>‚ÄúWe are here to do our job as best we can and it‚Äôs very annoying if we don‚Äôt win a race. Everyone in the paddock, I think, I have this vision in mind. We\'re all here to win. The last, successful season does not help us, since it is extremely difficult to win. Also internally it does not help that you win so much, since there are also many young people who also come into the team and they are actually only used to winning.""\n\n>‚ÄúThis will eliminate the sense of those people of how exceptional it is to win one race at all, let alone a championship. People forget that after such a season when we had in 2023 it is terribly difficult to continue to win races. Just ask Max Verstappen, he also knows how difficult it is to win in all those years. He won a number of races in 2016, but in 2021 came the title until 2021, which shows how difficult it is,‚Äù said Wache, who would like to clarify that after all these years in Formula 1 he still realizes how unique it is to win in the premier class of motorsport.\n\n>‚ÄúEvery good thing has to be right to win in Formula 1, everything has to be well tuned to make it possible. You also have to be a bit lucky and you also have to have a good police performance, haha (Wache refers to the stewards as being police, ed.). The problem of winning so much is that the police will pay even more attention to you, especially in relation to how much you look at the rest. That\'s how it works. It is like with brothers in a family, the smallest brother can do more because he is less followed"", laughs the always sympathetic Wache, but at the same time an important point seems to have been touched upon in his opinion. \n\n>Limit\n\n>*This year there was a lot of fuss about, shall we say, \'the gray area\' of the regulations. Do you think that will be the case again next year?*\n\n>""These cars are difficult to develop further. There are always gray areas, but that also appeals to you as an engineer. But if you look at McLaren\'s rear wing, sorry, but that is more than operating in a gray area. They have ""We also use that wing for several races, right? Without that rear wing earlier this season, they wouldn\'t win in Baku, for example, and if you put that together, the constructors\' championship would now look very different.""\n\n>*Is that just frustrating or also interesting, since you are also an engineer and are looking to improve the car?*\n\n>""I cannot deny the interestingness of it, but as an engineer you also have to respect the rules. The difference between the technical regulations and the sporting regulations is that with the technical regulations you have to prove that you are doing it according to the rules. With the sporting regulations it is the other way around. It is the reverse of, for example, a speed measurement by the police, where they can only estimate your speed at one point, but do not see the rest. With the technical regulations you have to show that you are fits well, because everything visible.""\n\n>*However, isn\'t the gray area also part of the game?*\n\n>""Yes, of course it\'s part of the game, but at the same time there are limits. If the police don\'t see it, it doesn\'t mean it\'s legal. Look at what happened in the past at Ferrari, for example, that\'s more than pushing the limits. It is therefore frustrating for us when the police do not do their work.""\n\n>*So you clearly have the feeling that other teams went over the limit too often this year?*\n\n>""Yes, quite a bit over the limit indeed. However, at a certain point it is what it is and that is the playing field on which it is played. If you have a good idea, you have a good idea, but when you go outside the playing field is simply not correct,"" Wache said clearly.\n\n>During the season the FIA \u200b\u200bintervened a number of times, for example by issuing new technical guidelines. However, given the competition between the four top teams that will undoubtedly continue in 2025, the FIA \u200b\u200bwill be able to prepare for an interesting 2025 season.\n\n>After the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the remaining articles of the interview with Pierre Wache will be online on RacingNews365.', ""Yes, Ferrari would be first.

If Ferrari wins the race, a tie on points should also result in win for Ferrari in the constructors due to more wins than McLaren. They are currently tie with 5 wins each. If they end both on tie in points and in number of wins, the number of second places will count, and Mclaren will win constructors.

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‚Äòround racing friend, for the latest batch of team updates, driver buzz, technical adventures, and trackside stats is ready and waiting for you‚Ä¶

[*Throttle & Tread‚Äôs*](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/) fifteenth edition of *Last Week in Formula 1* has arrived.

Now let‚Äôs get down to business‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# The Qatar Grand Prix



***Sprint Qualifying / Sprint Race:***

P1. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri

P2. George Russell / Lando Norris

P3. Oscar Piastri / George Russell



**Qualifying / Grand Prix:**

P1. George Russell / Max Verstappen

P2. Max Verstappen / Charles Leclerc

P3. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri



***Throttle & Tread‚Äôs Reaction:***

When you remove the order-jumbling facilitated by the FIA‚Äôs exceptionally poor handling of Albon‚Äôs discharged mirror into T1 (which could have been swiftly dealt with in a lap or two by a VSC) and the sudden resurgence of drive-through penalties, not much went on in this race. However, who doesn't love a little chaos, albeit controversial? Especially when the end result brings some stakes to Abu Dhabi.

***Personal highlights from Lusail include:***

* Zhou‚Äôs‚Äîand Sauberaudi‚Äôs‚Äîfirst points of the year!
* Valterri Bottas elevating himself from 23rd in the WDC
* Pierre Gasly continuing his strong run of form with a solid P5
* Ferrari keeping their WDC hopes alive (with a little help from Lando)
* Lewis‚Äôs absolute rollercoaster of a race: *He dropped 4 positions at the start, picked up a 5 second penalty, asked if the car was broken, got a puncture, pitted, received a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane, pitted, asked to retire, was told to stay out‚Äîthen told to retire, decided to stay out this time, then closed a 12 second gap, gained 3 positions, and finished in P12.*

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

*Welp, I can‚Äôt say I expected this heap of driver rumblings and rumours to hit the airwaves in Qatar:*

Desire for Young Gun Franco Colapinto has been cooled by his recent run of crashes‚Äîmeaning [his shot at a seat in the Red Bull stable is gooone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4plvs/thomas_maher_franco_colapinto_is_off_the_table/)¬†

So assuming there‚Äôs truth to the growing number of [reports that Checo will be let go and/or offered an ambassadorship role](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4uhiz/perez_red_bull_exit_likely_after_abu_dhabi_f1/) a la Danny Ric once the checkered flag waves in Abu Dhabi, Liam or Yuki will get the ride in 2025.

[Estie Besteban Ocon‚Äôs 2024 season came to an unexpected and premature end](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4raqi/alpine_goodbye_esteban_ocon/) in Qatar, [as a condition for him being able to test with his new team‚ÄîHaas‚Äîafter Abu Dhabi.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4bhsq/the_race_ocon_had_to_give_up_final_alpine_race_to/) In his place, [Jack Doohan will make his debut.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qvmd/alpine_team_statement_jack_doohan_will_race_at/)

And *maybe now* we‚Äôll get an end to the hopeful ‚ÄòMick Schumacher returns to the F1 grid‚Äô articles, [given he‚Äôs chosen to leave his Mercedes role at year's end.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uhjk/mercedes_amg_f1_we_can_confirm_that_mick/)

Speaking of reserve drivers, [Alpine has signed F2 rookie Paul Aron as their 2025 reserve](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h38p21/bwt_alpine_formula_one_team_paul_aron_signs_as/)‚Äîstepping in for Jack Doohan who is graduating to a race seat.

*However, Jacky D might be holding his breath,* [*as there have been rumours over the past couple weeks that Franco Colapinto could scoop that seat out from under him‚Ä¶*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3awow/thomas_maher_the_rumours_of_colapinto_switching/) *Which would be absolutely gut wrenching. We‚Äôll see!*

Departing Formula 1 for the second time, everyone‚Äôs favourite viking, [Kevin Magnussesn, seems set to join the BMW M Team WRT in WEC next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3algi/enduranceinfo_wec_kevin_magnussen_on_course_to/)

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

***The F1 grid‚Äôs most recent addition:***

As they‚Äôve asserted all along, ~~Andretti-~~Cadillac‚Äôs preparation for joining the grid in 2026 continues at pace, [with their latest hiring of former Renault engine tech chief, Rob White.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gznb3i/autosport_andretti_lands_former_renault_f1_engine/) But that‚Äôs not even close to all on the matter‚Ä¶

Thanks to some curious combination of Michael Andretti stepping back from the day-to-day operations, potential legal pressure applied by an American DOJ antitrust investigation, and ‚ÄúAndretti‚Äù¬† being dropped from the name‚Ä¶

The General Motors-supported [Cadillac F1 Team *will* join the grid in 2026.](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/gm-cadillac-2026-f1-team-andretti-absent/)

[So far we know that:](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0ajxt/mario_andretti_reveals_his_plans_for_americas_new/)¬†

1. Their ideal driver lineup consists of a ‚Äúyoung American talent‚Äù (with Colton Herta being the top candidate) and an F1 veteran ([Bottas?](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1yi0n/cadillac_f1_interest_2025_indycar_offer_bottas/)). 
2. The Andretti Global organization is building the chassis and running the race team, with GM being responsible for leading the engine side.  
3. Until said GM engine is ready for 2028, there‚Äôs an interim engine deal with Ferrari in the works for 2026 and 2027.

*Now roll up your sleeves for a few more dashes of drama‚Ä¶*

***Audi‚Äîa project in trouble before rubber meets tarmac:***

Thanks to being blue-balled for years and years‚Ä¶ The F1 fandom at large remains skeptical that Audi will follow through on joining F1, at least until they show up on the grid. And making moves like selling 1/3 of the team to the Qatar Investment Authority won‚Äôt help. However, arrangements like these aren‚Äôt unusual in Formula 1‚Äî*At the very least* Mercedes, Renault, McLaren, Aston Martin, and Cadillac don‚Äôt have full ownership of their teams either.

[More concerning than a partial sale are the rumours that their 2026 engine is behind schedule and they‚Äôre having trouble attracting skilled personnel‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h08try/audi_sells_a_third_of_its_formula_1_team/)

***Hot bananas, the FIA is a roaring dumpster fire right now:***

In yet *another* firing, Race Steward Tim Mayer [warns that the FIA is running out of people to fulfill their responsibilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1wax6/andrew_benson_fired_steward_warns_fia_is_running/)‚Äîalso sharing that he was fired because Doodyhead Sulayem was offended by a right of review document.

Further bringing shame upon the FIA and their frustrating leader, Janette Tan‚Äîpromoted to F2 Race Director just one week or so ago to take over for Rui Marques who was elevated to the F1 role‚Äî[has been let go before she could direct even a single race, with Marques now directing both series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uc7o/fresh_fia_upheaval_as_f2_race_director_janette/)

If you want all the details, my hopefully future friends at The Race penned [this article](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/fia-embarrassing-crisis-deepens-ahead-of-f1-qatar-gp/) catching up on ‚Äòthe FIA‚Äôs embarrassing internal crisis.‚Äô

Unfortunately, MBS‚Äôs shenanigans have continued by [removing two top level FIA bankers from office for questioning him on where money was going‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h2gnoo/top_duo_removed_from_office_after_querying_fia/)

More questions of the FIA‚Äôs competency piled up in Qatar after the poor handling of Albon‚Äôs dismembered mirror was left on track, hit and exploded into smithereens by Valterri Bottas, likely contributing to two punctures‚Ä¶

While there‚Äôs no argument about Lando, Lewis, etc deserving penalties for their infractions, the sudden doling out of stop-and-go and drive-through penalties has left teams and drivers frustrated at the lack of consistency.

*Plus* good ‚Äòol [Doodyhead Sulayem thinks that how he runs the FIA is none of the drivers‚Äô business‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h43xey/ben_sulayem_tells_f1_drivers_how_he_runs_fia_is/) Which seems an awfully silly take to this observer.

In closing, [Toto Wolff thinks the FIA could have its own reality show.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qtun/wolff_fia_could_have_its_own_reality_show_amid/)

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

In a classic Certified Alpine Moment, Pierre Gasly‚Äôs engine blew in Vegas due to a combo of DRS, slipstream, and dirty air from Yuki ahead‚Äî[his engine reached 12937 rpm in 8th gear, had enough, and went boom-bang-boom.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzpv8g/fdataanalysis_unbelievable_the_slipstream_made/)

1h5khol,Liam Lawson - Yes or No?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5khol/liam_lawson_yes_or_no/,2024-12-03, Discussion,"After the saga of getting Ricciardo replaced by Liam Lawson, I have got to say I have not been that impressed with him since being back on the grid. 

When he first came on the scene, replacing Ricciardo after breaking his hand last year, he looked great. But we have seen through De Vries, after a great debut with Williams, that what looked good initially doesn't always transpire. The most recent example is Colapinto. Came in, looked great, but with some recent errors and crashes, Red Bull aren't interested anymore

- I'm interested to hear your thoughts on Liam's performances 


 - and Yuki / Lawson aside, who would be your outside pick for the Red Bull seat?


Edit: we saw on Drive to Survive that Ricciardo got the nod to replace De Vries based on his testing for Red Bull. If Ricciardo did indeed do enough to score a front row seat in that testing, then he absolutely should have been given the chance to see what he could do for Red Bull just to close any doubts and questions left. ","[""The question is a different one imo - if Red Bull decide Perez is a busted flush, Ricciardo didn't do enough, Lawson's too raw and Tsunoda isn't somebody they deem worthy of the senior team, then what?"", ""Yuki has more experience, try him for one year. Swap if he doesn't deliver."", 'Max Verstappen has decided not to be in action during the final test in Abu Dhabi after the season. In addition to the Young Driver Test - for which Verstappen is obviously not eligible - there is also a Pirelli test, but the Dutchman has expressed no interest in that. On behalf of Red Bull Racing, Yuki Tsunoda will be in action.\n\nDuring the test, as mentioned, Yuki Tsunoda will get a chance to show himself to the leadership of the Austrian racing stable. Christian Horner and Helmut Marko are undoubtedly attentive spectators during the test, which could just be an audition for the seat next to Verstappen in 2025.', 'Not really anything conclusive yet. But his substitution races last year flattered him. Happened with De Vries, Colapinto, and Lawson. This year we are seeing his true level against Tsunoda. Not bad not great imo\n\nNext year I think Bearman‚Äôs skill level will be revealed and it‚Äôll be lower than what most everyone has been saying\n\nQuasimodo predicted all this', 'They will probably just run max solo next year save the money on the second car then worry about 2026', 'Agreed. It‚Äôs not Lawsons fault but anyone who thought he‚Äôd be ready to go up against Verstappen next year is out of their mind. There‚Äôs also the feedback issue- if as many say Max is so good he ‚Äúdrives through‚Äù problems, then surely RBR want someone who can provide them with good feedback to ensure they‚Äôre hitting targets and avoid another slump like we‚Äôve seen this year, which a rookie just simply couldn‚Äôt give you.\n\nThey either should‚Äôve gone outside of the stable, or put Ricciardo in there after summer. In the end they went for the worst option of all, and now have backed themselves into putting someone that if they were honest with themselves they‚Äôd not really want to in the seat.', ""Good enough for VCARB? Yes.\n\nGood enough for RedBull? More research needed.\n\nPut Yuki in the RedBull for a year and see how he does. Give Liam more time in VCARB to learn the prove himself. Stick or switch as needed. It's the obvious answer, and therefore the only thing RedBull won't do."", 'No. He was brought in because RBR thought he would perform better than Ricciardo, he‚Äôs gotten the same if not worse results. Lawson hasn‚Äôt done a single drive that‚Äôs made me think he has raw pace, unfortunately that‚Äôs just the truth. Lacklustre races, nothing special. \n\nCommon theme with these rookies who step in, perform above average first races and then are so overhyped, you start to see that they are mid-tier at best. \n\nYuki should get that seat.', 'Feels invisible almost outside of the little incidents with other drivers.\n\nLike a Zhou with drama']",0,137,0.44,0,128,128,0,7,0.020000000000000018,0
1h5nhtd,"Zhou deserved better, both from F1 and from fans",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5nhtd/zhou_deserved_better_both_from_f1_and_from_fans/,2024-12-03, Discussion,"Look, I get it, he's not the best driver to race in F1. He never lit up the field and he wasn't likely going to be the next Verstappen no matter what car he was in. But let's not pretend in his first season he didn't go toe to toe with Bottas, who is *far* better than the goldfish memory that dominates F1 fandom seems to give him credit for. He dipped following a massive, serious crash, which is a pattern other drivers have exhibited before, and even then didn't become crash happy.

He raced clean, in a complete junker of a car, and while he lost consistently to his much more experienced teammate let's not pretend Bottas wasn't hanging out at the back of the grid in that tractor, as well.

Zhou's consistency, as well as his ability to shove that Sauber where it shouldn't be on (an inconsistent) occasion honestly makes it seem like we potentially let a good midfielder slip through F1 without a fair shot. Consistency and lack of crashing is what got us Hulk on the grid so long, and it's hard to imagine that in *literally* any other car we wouldn't be rating him a bit differently.

Hope he ends up with a WEC career, since his consistency will do well in that discipline and it'll be good to see him get a fair shot in equipment that isn't the F1 equivalent of an F2 car.","[""Deserved better? He's been in F1 for three years, that's pretty good I would say. Some drivers aren't there to stay, Zhou's career has been pretty invisible and there isn't really any reason besides monetary that he should stay."", 'So many drivers ""deserve better"" than the situations they are thrown in. \n\nEventually, it\'s a sport of millionaires going round in circles. Don\'t take it too seriously.', 'This post comes up every time a mid field driver leaves F1.', ""I don't agree with you. He's been consistently last when Bottas in the same car was performing better (miles ahead) not only in race pace but also pulling some Q2s. He did score points this last weekend in Qatar but that was **arguably** one of his best races in F1 and everything turned out to be perfect for it to happen (clean race, good upgrades, lots of DNFs, etc). He's been in the grid for 3 years already. I think it's time for him to move on. Lots of rookies waiting for a chance to show off."", ""Nah.\n\nUnless I missed some major hate, he got a fair deal out of F1. Three years, one and a half of that with a somewhat capable car and never really came close to either troubling his teammate or embarrassing himself.\n\nThough I'm not sure about that consistency tbh. This season most races saw Zhou be terribly off the pace and a couple (Vegas, Bahrain, Qatar) had him beat Bottas with ease."", 'He consistently placed last. \n\nThere is nothing that he deserves from fans. \n\nThat is the nature of sport. Winners become legends and losers are thrown to the lions. He afforded no more respect than the other paid drivers which have been bood off the track', 'Meh. There are dozens of drivers at or close to his level every year that don\'t even get a chance to drive an f1 car. Being chinese with backing helped him get a drive for three years, he can be pretty satisfied with that imo. \n\nI like him and agree he has done fairly well and is a safe pair of hands, especially compared to so many other recent drivers we have seen. But I don\'t think he ""deserved"" better - he got a great shot and will likely find a solid career after this too. \n\nI appreciate him as a person too - never causing drama, never talking about anyone or saying anything negative. Just seems like a good dude and a solid driver. I wish him the best.', ""Dude had 3 seasons in F1.  Its a shame that the Sauber was so poor - and it made him look worse than he is but the fact that he hasn't had teams offering him a seat despite bringing in a lot of sponsor money, suggests that he isn't highly rated by other teams.\n\n  \nA shame for Zhou, as he seems like a good guy but I'm sure he'll find a seat in another class."", 'I disagree, he got away with being slow because people expected another Latifi or Mazepin and he wasn‚Äôt as bad as them, he‚Äôs been in F1 for three years and 85-90% of the time has been completely anonymous and way off the pace, the only reason you‚Äôre even speaking now is because he put in a single good performance this year\n\nNot to mention he came in with barely any pedigree, it took him three years in F2 to even manage a top 3 finish (compared to Pourchaire who won it in his third year but never got a chance)']",0,66,0.25,0,65,65,0,66,0.25,0
