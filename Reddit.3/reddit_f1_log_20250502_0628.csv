Along with some high-flyers, some problem children have already emerged. One of them is Lewis Hamilton. Even though his move to Ferrari was supposed to change everything.**\n\n> Revitalized. This is how Lewis Hamilton described his physical and mental state before the season opener in Melbourne in mid-March. Everyone who watched the record Formula 1 winner on television and in person sensed the Englishman\'s excitement about the new challenge. After twelve years in the Mercedes outfit, Hamilton had changed colors and joined the legendary Ferrari brand.\n\n> Few in the paddock could have imagined that Hamilton would seek a new challenge. The 40-year-old acted on a famous quote from Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize winner Fridtjof Nansen, who once said: ""We need courage to throw away the old clothes that have seen their best."" In Hamilton\'s opinion, Mercedes had seen their best days.\n\n> After disappointing seasons in 2022 and 2023, he decided to switch to Ferrari even before the start of the season last year. Although Hamilton won two more races for Mercedes, the man from Stevenage secretly hoped that the Ferrari engineers would build him a title-capable car.\n\n> **Ferrari slips.**\nThis hope was not unfounded. The Scuderia scored the most points of all Formula 1 teams in the second half of the 2024 season and missed the Constructors\' World Championship title by just 14 points. The goal for this season was clear: After the last title in 2008, the team wanted to finally bring a World Championship trophy back to Maranello. However, after five races, they are far from that. Ferrari, in fourth place, is 110 points behind leader McLaren. Hamilton himself has just 31 points, while teammate Charles Leclerc has 47. The energetic and revitalized Lewis Hamilton is already pass√© after five Grands Prix.\n\n> Even worse, however, were the star\'s statements following the Saudi Arabian GP. While Leclerc secured Ferrari\'s first podium of the season with P3, the seven-time world champion finished seventh, nearly 31 seconds behind the sister car. ""I lacked grip. I was fighting with the car in every corner. Everything I tried didn\'t work.""\n\n> It seems as if Hamilton is falling back into old habits at Ferrari. Even during his time at Mercedes, he was known as a driver who liked to have his car modified several times over the course of a weekend. Instead of concentrating on fine-tuning the setup, Hamilton got lost in the woods. The 105-time GP winner was caught off guard at the second race of the season in China. After his sprint victory ‚Äì the highlight of the season so far ‚Äì the superstar had been a force to be reckoned with again. But then the Ferrari technicians took a look at the SF-25. The disappointing qualifying was followed by an even weaker race, which ultimately ended in a disqualification. The skid blocks on the underbody were below the minimum value of nine millimeters.\n\n> **Too many setup changes?**\nTwo weeks later, Hamilton defended himself in Japan when asked about the changes to the car: ""What people from the outside don\'t see at all is that minimal changes have massive effects. In Shanghai, we only changed the setup very slightly, and the car was immediately different."" But things didn\'t improve in Suzuka, with P7. Hamilton showed a small sign of life with decent pace and fifth place in Bahrain. However, he messed up qualifying there. He made the same mistake in Jeddah. He couldn\'t keep up with his teammate Leclerc for a single fast lap.\n\n> The former regular world champion continues to blame the car\'s lack of comfort. ""I didn\'t feel comfortable for a second in Jeddah."" He took the blame himself. ""The car clearly has potential. Charles clearly demonstrated that with his podium finish. So I can\'t say it\'s the car\'s fault,"" he said after the defeat.\n\n> **Vasseur defends his superstar.**\nHamilton is already resorting to gallows humor. Regarding possible changes, he said laconically: ""The car still feels alien. I might need a brain transplant."" It won\'t come to that. He\'s assured of the support of his team boss, Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur. After Jeddah, the Frenchman took a protective stance against his transfer coup and defended it to journalists. ""I fully support Lewis. We will try to find the reasons for the problems and find solutions.""\n\n> The 56-year-old downplayed the hopeful\'s poor form. ""It\'s not dramatic. We\'ve completed five races so far. I know you want the big headlines; Fred said this and Fred said that."" Vasseur is aware that special attention is being paid to Ferrari and Hamilton. However, the performances of both sides so far have been disappointing. The demands are higher than top-10 results.\n\n> The Ferrari team boss wants to keep a cool head. ""We have to stay calm. For us as a team, we have to work step by step. Last year, it paid off that we continually improved in the hundredths range. We have to maintain this attitude."" There are no quick fixes in sight. Fans of Hamilton and Ferrari will probably have to show some patience.']",0,56,0.42,0,371,371,0,3,0.010000000000000009,0
