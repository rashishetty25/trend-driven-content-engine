And for people originating from elsewhere in Argentina, the journey was likely longer… it was a big deal.', ""I don't think they understand that these are not big distances for South Americans, especially for sport fans. Europeans can cross multiple countries in like two hours, so they can't get their head around South Americans traveling 28 hours for a game, which some people do regularly for Copa América and stuff."", 'And? What’s your point. That sounds like normal travel problems. lol.', 'Well, you said you didn’t get it, and that it was not like it was far. I’d say it is a pretty big deal for a big amount of people to be mobilising like that - and the distance is certainly not short. But if you’re just salty for no reason there’s nothing I can do!', 'It’s just fans going to a race. lol. It’s not that crazy.', ""Put it into perspective. Logan Sargent joined F1 and I doubt he brought 40k new fans from the U.S. into F1. \n\nFranco shows up in the middle of the season driving for a midfield team, and he has brought in over hundreds of thousands of new fans, and is so popular that nearly 40,000 people who didn't know who he was at the begining of the year, went to go see only him and nobody else. \n\nSome of those that went probably don't know who veratappen is, or that red bull has a second team, and they definitely have no idea why the team is called Williams. There are news stories about putting together rule guides for your family. Some  couple got their 15 minutes of fame in the news because he made a quick guide for his girlfriend who wanted to start following F1.\n\nTN news somehow got my dad's number after the race in Austin and interviewed him live for like 40 minutes to talk about what it was like for an Argentine to be at the race.\n\nWilliams made a full line of merch for a driver that doesn't even have a contract. Why? Because they're raking in the cash on merch sales. My family has been a diehard Ferrari family for literally as long as I can remember, but you bet your ass my dad has a Williams hat now, and it's signed by Franco.\n\nIt's all for him and nobody else. This isn't just fans going to the races. This is something formula one has never seen before.""]",68,16,0.77,68,15,15,-3,0,-0.010000000000000009,-3
