1l0qmxh,A 10 second time penalty for Max is not enough. The precedent for deliberate crashes was already set in 1997.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l0qmxh/a_10_second_time_penalty_for_max_is_not_enough/,2025-06-01, Discussion,"When Schumacher intentionally crashed into a driver in 1997, he was disqualified from the championship. I am not saying a penalty this harsh should be given here, but a 10s penalty is an absolute joke.

Max slowed down to let George ahead, then torpedo'd him. This is undeniably a deliberate crash by Max. This behaviour is absolutely unacceptable and should not be given such a lenient penalty. Such disgusting, reckless, and endangering behaviour should be given a race ban at minimum. The FIA needs to make it clear that intentionally crashing with other drivers is a step too far.

Edit: The circumstances are obviously different to my example. Schumacher crashed into his championship rival, Max didn't. That's why I don't think a championship DSQ is reasonable, but he still needs to be punished more than he currently is.

Edit 2: And the holy stewards decided it was a 10s penalty and 3 penalty points. Russell got a bigger penalty in Monaco for overtaking off track, and Kmag got banned for less. What an absolute joke.

1l0swi3,First To The Apex,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l0swi3/first_to_the_apex/,2025-06-01, Discussion,"I want to know what people‚Äôs thoughts and feelings are with the rule about owning the corner if you reach the apex first. For me, today‚Äôs race highlighted the issues, but it‚Äôs been like this for a while, I think it discourages racing. What I want, and what I think of, when cars are racing is a show of skill, talent and bravery. A recent example being Max around the outside of Oscar at Imola T1. Space should be left ALWAYS, inside or out, the person making the overtake should have to work for it and use their talent to pull off the move. What is becoming a real issue, and ruining racing in general, is the idea that because you get to the apex first, you have rights to the corner and can force another driver off. That kills all racing. You practically act as if the other car doesn‚Äôt exist, continue on your line and push them into the grass, gravel, or a wall. Racing can‚Äôt exist. You dive late on the brakes, get to the apex first, push the driver off. If anything, the guy being pushed off will get a penalty, damage, or told to give the position back. It‚Äôs formula 1‚Äôs equivalent of diving in football. I wish they‚Äôd change it so it would encourage better racing between all drivers. 

There have been plenty of moves where the drivers have raced fairly, Alonso around the outside of many drivers at T3 in Spain. Lando and Oscar fighting occasionally (yes they‚Äôre teammates but sportsmanship should shown throughout the grid, and encouraged). Moves where just enough room is given. 

Idk, it‚Äôs getting annoying seeing cars dive and others taking avoiding action off the road just for it to turn into an argument over the radio, rather than an on track scrap ü§∑


Edit : I don‚Äôt have enough comment karma to comment on here apparently so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs being seen and what isn‚Äôt. It appears to be 60/40 on the rule being utter nonsense. Which is nice to see. To the other 40% of you, what is it about this style of racing you enjoy? Someone asked what I would change, I think it‚Äôs fairly obvious. Both cars are responsible for looking after themselves, and their competitors. Therefore, you do not push a driver off track, you leave space at all times whilst in a fight for position, inside or out. This should be in the fibres of the sport, it‚Äôs not a spectacle seeing cars get shunted off track and it be classed as an overtake. This is the pinnacle of motorsport and should be treated that way, not like bumper cars","[""I think it's insanely dumb that you can divebomb, be pixel ahead at the apex, push the other driver off and happily continue on while the pushed guy has to concede because if he doesn't, he gets penalty.\n\nBut drivers themselves decided on this rule, so what I or anyone here think doesn't matter."", ""There shouldn't be such thing as owning a corner.

If the onside car tries to pinch, the outside car can jist hold their lane. If they come together, let the drivers settle it.
