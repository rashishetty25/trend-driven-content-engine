My take is, you do a mistake right? But like in the Sainz case it wasn't so fatal because both drivers continued the race and they still have a chance of improving or getting something out of it. But in the Kimi - Charles scenario, Charles is absolutely done. There is nothing that he can do to overturn the bad luck.

What is your take guys?

Watching Hadjar hold his ground in 4th today behind Verstappen (bumped up to 3rd with Norris' DNF) got me wondering this. Obviously, there's plently of jokes about the curse of the second Red Bull seat, and Hadjar getting threatened with a ""demotion"" to Red Bull if he keeps doing well. But honestly, is RB better right now?

I mean, Lawson got off to a miserable start in Red Bull. Then he got 'demoted' to RB and has looked much better since. Yuki looked like he was better off last year at VCARB than he is now at Red Bull (though he's looked a little better since Horner got sacked). Hadjar has looked better than Lawson and Tsunoda, and he's been able to stay at RB. We always hear Verstappen complaining about how shit his car is (sometimes before he pulls off a miracle). I can't help but wonder if Verstappen would look better in an RB car? I mean, what if RB has been the faster car for a few races now and Verstappen has just been working his usual Verstappen magic to make the Red Bull not look as horrible as it is? ","['RBR has a higher ceiling but difficult to drive', 'Most likely easier to drive, but with a lower ceiling. Max was nursing the softs and mediums as soon as it became clear he was no match for the McLarens.', 'Red Bull has a higher ceiling but a lower floor. A good driver like Max will extract everything out of the car and hit the ceiling, while others struggle to perform.', ""I feel like there's no way that Verstappen isn't at least 2 tenths quicker than a rookie and for that rookie to be clawing at the back of his car on harder compound tires means that the car Verstappen has is dragging him down. \n\n  \nI don't think there's any doubt that the RB car was the better one today."", ""No discredit to Hadjar, he drove a beautiful race under pressure from 2 very seasoned drivers in arguably stronger cars and managed to clinch his first podium in his debut season. \n\nBut Red Bull in P2 is all Max Verstappen. He did everything right but if it had been any other driver , that P2 wouldn't have been possible. And if it had 2 safety cars less, Hadjar might very possibly be P2 today. The deg on that car was so bad. Within few laps it was already losing pace after each tyre change."", 'Red Bull is the faster car but it is extremely sensitive to setup and driving style.\n\nWhereas the RB is a bit more tame but still a rapid car to ride.', 'For this track it was quite obvious it was faster.

I'm unfamiliar with it"", 'Fantastic interview, and well worth the read.  \n\nThere\'s a kid, handed a box of parts that was once a race car, jigsawing them back together, collecting fabricating skills to do it..  \n\n>I‚Äôve been tremendously fortunate in my career to work with John Barnard, Adrian Newey, Ross Brawn, Pat Symonds, Rory Byrne. I feel awful for leaving anyone out because there‚Äôve been so many. I‚Äôve worked with Flavio Briatore to Christian Horner; I‚Äôve seen both ends of the spectrum. And of course, you learn from all of those experiences and those people.\n\nThat quote speaks a lot.    Even mentioned and accredited Binotto.  \n\nOld school physical hands and knees, working from the bottom to the top, tutelage from 90% of the all-time greats, and also crediting some of the successful managers from the other side of the business and the lesson he learnt.\n\nPerfect marriage. \n\nAlso the quote:\n\n>I once had a very good conversation with Pat Symonds about my career aspirations and where I see myself, and I had to make a choice at that point: go down the managerial route and the people route, or stick with the cars and the engineering that I‚Äôd loved for years. And what F1 taught me more than anything was the power of a team‚Äîand I loved that. At Benetton, when we were fighting for a championship, everyone was looking for the last scrap of performance. I can‚Äôt tell you the energy that it gives you, and it keeps you young, so I made the decision to go into a management career. I‚Äôve never looked back, frankly.\n\n>I love the incredible creativity, the work that the engineering geniuses like Mattia Binotto can create with the right tools. But more than that, I‚Äôve loved managing people, building teams, guiding people in their career paths, seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee. I love all of that, and I love building teams, so it‚Äôs just a bigger team to put together as team principal than it was as a sporting director or mechanic.\n\n\nIt\'s the ""seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee. I love all of that.""', '100%.  The guy was arguably the real reason of their dominance.  \n\nThat\'s the problem with domination, and people have seen it in the Merc downfall.    Team dominates year after year, and no promotions for the key players.   Really showed that bad management style of Toto.  He kept key people in the same positions to maintain the status quo, to impress the board.   \n\nA lot of Toto fans will hate to read this, but Toto bought his way into the sport with Williams.  Lucked into a Merc role after Ross Brawn had to fall on the sword after the illegal tyre test.    In business, it would be called a ""hostile takeover"" by Toto.  No way the board got rid of Ross Brawn if someone wasn\'t earworming them behind the scenes.  Like the Mansour toppling Ron.  \n\nLauda and Toto were at loggerheads, which people forget, and only after Lauda\'s passing, the whole Toto <3 Lauda stuff came to appear.\n\nHaving someone like a Wheately, a James Vowles, or a Paddy Lowe, on a team, where the progression ceiling is just a dead end for years....\n\nAt least someone like Zak Brown recognised that career stagnation of the key people, is a fast course to failure.    Create different position names, where it\'s like a promotion to a new role etc.  Reward people and promote.   Stella for example.  Leaves Ferrari with Alonso, as he knows the Ferrari culture of modern times.   Works his way up from Race Engineer to TP.  \n\nRob Smedley should have been given Ferrari TP a long long time ago.  Long-term F1 key person, and he just left the sport because of that ceiling.\n\nOld school mentality, like Ron in McLaren, having Whitmarsh as the trainee to the crown.  Seasons pass, person still holds on, thinking ... the day will come... and then the day comes, and it\'s too late.  It\'s old school Independent Team mentality.  \n\nHorner shouled have stepped aside, given himself a new role description like Zak, and elevated Wheatley to TP.\n\nMuch like Toto showed that he wasn\'t a natural leader, trying to keep the status quo, rather than reward people to stop them from leaving.', ""Horner's reputation could be a factor but it is also a natural situation that people who have been in their position for quite a long time look for something new. The same happened at Mercedes, a lot of other teams and companies in general around the world. Wheatley could have been a logical successor just like James Vowles at Mercedes but the timing wasn't right. It took too long for the Red Bull HQ to find a way to fire Horner."", 'Why i this argument only ever made about red bull when Merc are in exactl the same situation?', ""It's the site Mike Spinelli put up after he sold Jalopnik, way back in the day."", 'Based on what was Wheatley the ‚Äûreal reason‚Äú, you really need to explain that.\n\nAlso how are the teams supposed to give those promotions what do you do with the people already in that position.\xa0', 'I think the sport is constantly evolving‚Äîboth technologically and socially.

These rules of engagement are not conducive for actual racing. A driver can simply be ahead at the apex, know they have right of way, meaning they can just drive to the outside of the corner knowing they cannot be challenged, or if an accident occurs knowing they will not be at fault.

We need cars to go side by side to overtake, it‚Äôs just a fact. If a car can hold the outside line, for almost the entire corner, and be almost in line or at least half way up to the car alongside it, the inside driver should be required to leave one cars width in the exit. 

The current rules allow two cars in to a corner, but only one to come out. If two go in, two should come out. We are losing classic battles and excitement in the sport. 

Would really love to see something changed. Rant over!","[""The problem is trying to have a one size fits all rule. A chicane in Jeddah where it's a quick turn in and quick change of direction are completely different to Tarzan at Zandvoort which goes on forever and potentially has multiple lines."", 'People are forgetting that it is still in every drivers benefit to avoid contact.  Just because you know it will be deemed the other drivers fault doesn‚Äôt mean there is no consequences for making contact.  That incident ended Lawson‚Äôs race just as much as it ended Carlos‚Äôs.  The 10 second penalty wouldn‚Äôt be relevant to either one of the drivers results because they were both about a lap out of any points anyway.', 'Lawson may have been in the right but it still cost him the race. No driver is just going to ram everyone who tries to pass them. Look at Verstappen vs Norris. Norris yields every time then just passes later when the tire deg hits.', ""Can I ask your opinion on the Russell vs Leclerc overtake that didn't get penalised?"", ""The problem is that you are obliged to give space only in some cases. But if you already gave space, you can't change lines to crash into someone and have them take penalty. Because giving space wasn't mandatory. \n\nLawson was inside and sainz was outside. Then Lawson just abandoned his line to crash into sainz.\n\nThe cleanest rule of engagement is that you can't force driver in front to abandon his own line to give you space. But if the overtaking car is along side, driver in front can't push him out.\n\nThe ambiguity comes from the definition of along side and definition of line in complex curves."", 'Yeah if anything the penalties arent harsh enough. They should make it so you lose championship points based on the position of the person you crash into. Take out 1st place? Lose 25 points. Anyone who finishes the season on negative points gets relegated to f2.', 'I thought Leclerc was overly optimistic and that many other penalties have been handed out for less. But it was no worse than Dijon \'79 that the ""purists"" love to have about.\n\nHowever, we continually complain about a lack of passing in the sport and then enact rules that make passing hard.']",6,9,0.58,6,7,7,1,1,0.010000000000000009,1

Continuing on from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n197mv/what_if_f1_had_geographical_championships_in/) that I posted last week, here are the updated tables for the hypothetical 2025 F1 European Championship.

In the Drivers' table, there was a lot of movement in the Top 10. Oscar took over the lead from Lando, Max is now in third, and George is now in fifth. Isack's podium allowed him to go from 11th to eighth, and Lance got closer to the Top 10 with another 7th place finish. Meanwhile, a haul of eight points for Ollie saw him hit double digits.

In the Constructors' table, Racing Bulls, Williams, and Aston Martin all leapfrogged Sauber, while Haas was able to get out of the basement, and lock Alpine in.",['Antonelli with 1 point üò¨'],2,1,0.58,2,1,1,1,1,0.019999999999999907,1

i‚Äôd love to hear from people who‚Äôve been following f1 for a while:
	‚Ä¢	are there any controversies, rivalries, or stories that shaped the sport that beginners usually don‚Äôt hear about right away?
	‚Ä¢	any small details you wish you knew earlier that made watching races more fun?
	‚Ä¢	stuff that‚Äôs not really ‚Äúofficial‚Äù but more like insider knowledge or fan culture?
	‚Ä¢	even just tips for following along during race weekends or things that the broadcasts don‚Äôt always explain.
