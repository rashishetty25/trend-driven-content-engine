It can't be, simply because the limit of the force applied is the limit of grip the tire has.\n\nIf the tire is slipping/locked up then that'll be the force exerted by the rubber in dynamic friction coefficient mode. If the tire is gripping the surface then it'll be static friction which is larger. Now, F1 cars operate normally in much higher grip situations than this particular spin; a dry track at high aero loads pushing the rubber against the track is the normal case. If the driver brakes hard, then the force will peak in static friction (i.e. not locked up) just before the limit is reached and then drop way down when the tire locks up and goes into dynamic friction i.e. sliding. The bottleneck will *always* be tire grip, and never braking pressure. This is true of any old car on the street, too. If you slam on the brakes then you'll always either slide (abs notwithstanding) or stop. It's just pretty easy to produce a higher force by pinching a brake disk than the force produced by friction in the short contact patch line/area of the tire with the road.\n\nEven in these high grip conditions, in a dry track with high downforce, going forwards, sideways, or backwards, suspensions don't just snap. They'd be very bad suspensions if they did because that's the standard environment they're expected to operate in. In a wet track, at a low speed, as in the incident, the grip is much lower. The maximum force that the tire puts on the suspension can't do more than tickle it. It doesn't matter if he accelerated or braked or reversed, the tire would start sliding way before the suspension flinched.\n\nIt seems much more likely there was a smaller defect there for a while, it grew larger as the track dried and Bortoletto started attacking kerbs more aggressively (and generally as fatigue added up), and the suspension snap is just an after-effect of the chain of failures that happened after the defect became a failure. \n\nHe had been getting brake failure messages on the dash pretty much the whole race too, and had to repeatedly do some settings on the wheel to reset the error message that came up. These messages became more and more common towards the failure. Brakes are right there close by the suspension, and if one were to speculate, perhaps the sensor errors were caused by a misalignment of something in that general area, and their becoming more frequent implies the misalignment could be increasing. And hey, there happened to be contact in the tire whose suspension snapped. Seems like a pretty clear picture to me that there was an issue brewing there for much longer up to the spin."", 'did the damaged suspension then went on to hold for 46 laps? seems unlikely', 'I think his suspension snapped before hitting the wall because his tyre suddenly started turning the opposite direction when he spun and hit the wall.

Rear wing main plane tests are in 3.15.9, rear wing flap in 3.15.10, slot gap in 3.15.15. So as the article says, just because the car passes the tests doesn't mean that it is compliant. If any rear wing could pass all the static tests but, during the event, bent like 50cm downwards, I believe that the FIA could DQ it anyway.\n\nIf any team wants to live in the edge by making their aerodynamic surfaces particularly flexible, they will stand out and the FIA is well within its rights to revise the testing procedure to hinder them."", ""This doesn’t mean what people think it means.

They might flex more than that in a crash for example, is that still a breach of the rules?\n\nThe rule is basically written to cover what the FIA wants to achieve, but if its not doing so then the rule needs to be changed.

That is, tracing which side of the garage a driver is on and finding out which one has the most driver's champions victories.

I know Max is in Vettel's old seat (both drove with Riccardo), so that seat has 8.

Kimi's seat has 6 for sure, but what about Button's championship, (if that counts), both drivers left Brawn when it went to Mercedes. Rosberg and Barrichello switched seats to and from Williams, so does that mean it was Button whose seat was taken up by Schumacher and later Hamilton, making it 7?

But it's got to be an old team, Ferrari or McLaren probably

Ferrari has 15 driver's titles, so at least 8 are in the same seat, McLaren has 12, so might beat Ferrari out?

Okay, so it probably can't be Ferrari *or* McLaren, neither has a clear 8 to beat Red Bull.

Oddly, the only other competitor is Mercedes, if you count Brawn and Tyrell then it should be feasible for Lewis's seat to beat RB

*Okay so by my calculations, the most successful seat I can track is Max's current seat, as 8 drivers championships have been won in it, second best is a tie between Raikkonen and Schumacher's Ferrari seat, Senna, Lauda, Hunt, and Fittipaldi's McLaren seat, and Lewis's Mercedes seat. All at six.*","[""Okay, so Raikkonen and Schumacher had the same seat, that's 6  \nScheckter is the other seat, with Lauda that's 4\n\nWhen Lauda and Regazzoni come in there is a complete driver replacement, I think Regazzoni took Ickx's seat, as Ickx leaves of his own volition mid season, and Regazzoni has to recommend Lauda.\n\nAand now it's 1971 and Ferrari has entered three cars in multiple races.\n\nThe way the cars and seats boil down, I think only Ickx can be followed further.\n\nI don't think I can follow this trail back further, from '70 to '69 all three drivers get changed out, and while I could say Ickx, who also drove in '68, is a good enough connection, the same issue occurs in '67.\n\nSo it probably can't be Ferrari, unless they're a strong case to tie the drivers together before there are only two.

Red Bull has made a habit of having an itchy trigger finger when young drivers make youthful errors, and to be very quick with the ""next man up"" rhetoric before young drivers really get a chance to show what they are. 

 It's the nature of the young to make mistakes, and it's apparently the nature of Red Bull Racing to fail to tolerate those mistakes and make knee jerk decisions that alter a young driver's entire career and ensure that whatever they produce later in life, won't be produced for Red Bull Racing..

Imagine if Red Bull had simply let Alex Albon learn and mature the position for a year or two back in the day.  They'd have saved themselves an awful lot of drama, and with a few years experience under his belt he would probably be a perfectly satisfactory driver for them by now.  They could definitely have used someone to put their second car into P5.

Red Bull has encountered a situation where they are a place veterans avoid going to.  There are literally multiple drivers not on the grid right now that are a better bet than Lawson to be productive in that second car, and there's no real belief that any of those drivers seriously considered, or were considered, for the open Red Bull seat, forcing one of the premium racing teams in the sport to throw a young replacement driver into what should be one of the most prestigious seats on the grid.

And the one driver they can find for that second seat who has even a small chance to stick there longterm?  He had one bad race in extremely adverse conditions and is suddenly on an ""improvement plan.""

One race...

Red Bull is reacting like they've got options for that second seat if Lawson fails.  In principle they do have Yuki Tsunoda at VCARB, but their established reluctance to actually bring the Japanese driver forward (and their repeated decisions that result in bringing white drivers forward over Asian ones at the drop of a hat despite an obvious quality and experience gap, Gasly over Albon, Lawson over Yuki), suggests that even if Yuki does wind up in the second Red Bull seat, Marko will learn nothing and continue to maintain his hair trigger. 

 And what's left in the Red Bull arsenal if they burn that last bridge?  Are they going to put Ayumu Iwasa in that seat?  Are they going to compound their bad habits by rushing Arvid Lindblad forward a full year before he's likely to be ready?  And likely STILL fail to realize that the reason the rookies aren't acclimatizing is substantially their own fault?

The bottom line for me is that while there is no ""curse"" on that seat in a superstitious sense, the attitudes at Red Bull, and Helmut Marko in particular, are cursing it plenty.  You can't just drop mandates on a rookie, and ratcheting up the pressure on a man like Lawson is more likely than not to make matters worse, not better.  you also can't wave a magic wand and make it so that young drivers don't make mistakes.  Especially if you insist on a car that is deliberately unstable with high oversteer and a super high skill floor.

this is a car that has eaten up every young driver not named Max who tried to take it on.  Once is a fluke, twice is coincidence, three times is a pattern.

Patience is required with any young driver , and simultaneously patience is anathema in the Red Bull inner circle.
