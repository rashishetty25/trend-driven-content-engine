a) the car is problematic.

Hulkenberg completely lost the rear on seemingly normal acceleration on the exit of T3/4, having to save multiple severe oversteer moments that put him into the gravel, damaging his floor and effectively ending his race. Later on in the lap, Bortoleto was in a battle with Bearman, and turned in relatively normally into T8 and instantly lost the rear in a basically unsavable moment that put him into the gravel, taking him out of race contention as well.

Both of these moments can be viewed here: [https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z\_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68](https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68)

If one of these drivers had experienced this alone, it would be easy to put it down to driver error. However, the appearance of a similar issue on both cars in the first lap in seemingly innocuous moments when the drivers weren't even trying to make a move, leads me to believe that there was potentially some sort of issue on the car, or more specifically, the tyre preparation plan that the team had in place during the formation lap (ie number of burnouts, target tyre temp). It seems likely that the team made a miscalculation that resulted in the rear tyres being out of the window on both cars to start the race.

1jkev3g,Verstappen driving style vs teammates,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jkev3g/verstappen_driving_style_vs_teammates/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"Is Yuki’s cornering technique in concept the most similar to Verstappens out of all his teammates since Riccardo left and development was focused on the dutchman?

I have read that Tsunodas driving style is sharp and quick preferring a pointy front end and loose rear. he is also very late and aggressive on breaking. The main difference is being that he lacks the smoothness and a robotic precision that Verstappen has but he has good reflexes. 

From what Ive seen, it seems like Yuki’s driving style is a more ""staccato"" version of of Verstappen. With that being said is Yuki not more well placed to develop into a better teammate? 

Because at least he follows the same philosophy, whereas other teammates would have had to change their whole way of thinking about a corner to adapt Tsunoda seemingly needs to """"just"""" smooth everything out. What were the driving styles of Verstappens failed teammates

Sidenote i dream of what Leclerc vs Verstappen in redbull would look like. ","[""I expect Tsunoda to struggle at least initially but I think he's Red Bull's best option at this point. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see just how far off Tsunoda is compared to Lawson on the Racing Bulls.  I still don't think the Racing Bulls car is faster (with Max behind the wheel) than the Red Bull but there is definitely a drivability difference."", 'We’ll find out soon enough- sink or swim time for TSU', 'A F1 car is designed to go as fast as they can design in around a track, without a driver in mind. \nThis car is “delivered” to the racing team that is going to set it up from circuit to circuit with automated and driver in the loop sims to find the fastest. Just at the last moment, a drivers preference is dailed in on track. \n\nThe difference between the tier of drivers get bigger when that car that is designed and setup by those 1000 people, has a small window of performance or is somewhat unpredictable. \n\nThis means that the RedBull car just isn’t a well balanced predictable car where anyone that’s not Verstappen, Hamilton or other top tier drivers can get that performance out. \n\nBut. The other way round, a driver maybe need a car to behave a certain way to get get his “mojo”. And if that’s not there, well, most of the times it’s just.. that’s a lost season or lost career.', ""A lot of drivers like the pointy front - Leclerc, Gasly, Albon, and Tsunoda as well. \n\nUsually, the issue is that Max sets up the car so extreme that it's borderline undrivable without being extremely good and accustomed to the car. There's a great interview with Albon about how the issue progresses. You set up your car less extreme than Max and you're slower a bit but then you want to compete with him, you push too hard and then you make mistakes and you lose confidence in the car and that's it for you\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ddEW\\_jHupA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ddEW_jHupA)"", ""If yuki brakes late then It's the complete opposite to verstappen who brakes early"", ""I think the whole driving style conversation is a bit played out. For example (looking at your last sentence), in one of the interviews where Albon talked about the pointiness of the Red Bull car, he mentioned that he prefers more oversteer even when compared to drivers like Leclerc. Does this mean Charles would perform worse alongside Max than Alex did? I seriously doubt it. \n\nIt likely just comes down to the Red Bull being unpredictable due to design flaws. That makes it difficult to wrangle into some good pace. Max has reported the car oversteers and understeers basically from corner to corner. Max has enough ability to catch these changes and adjust on the fly, maintaining a decent pace. The better the driver, the more likely they'll be able to do the same.\n\nWhether Yuki will be able to is less to do with his preference and more to do with his actual raw ability. Biggest test for a driver is likely that second Red Bull seat."", 'Only hopium is Yuki said last year [the car will suit him](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/tsunoda-sim-test-shows-red-bull-f1-car-suits-me/10677407/) after his first simulator experience at Red Bull', ""If he's late and aggressive on the brakes I don't think he'll get on well with the car.  Max is the opposite, he generally brakes early to get a feel for and stabilise the platform, then maximises the mid corner and exit to generate lap time.\n\nBraking late and aggressively will make the car even more pointy on corner entry than it already is."", 'I recommend to check ""B-Sport"" channed on YouTube by one former F1 engineer. He looks at this more simply: Adrian Newey, as a hobby driver and experienced designer, knew which areas he can sacrifice a little, to gain much better window of ""drivability"" for the car, so that the driver will more likely take 100% from the car potential. Other RB designers just use data and performance stats, which actually do not reflect on the drivability.\n\nSo it came to this, RB car on paper is the best, but no one can extract 100% potential from it. And it is fault by design, so no tuning, no small changes of bodywork will help much.']",0,53,0.44,0,455,455,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0
