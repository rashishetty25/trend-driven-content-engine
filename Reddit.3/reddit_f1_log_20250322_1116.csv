Ferrari's best result was a double podium in Austria 2022, with Leclerc in P2 and Sainz in P3. 

Hamilton and Leclerc have both scored multiple podiums but have never ended on the top step in this format. This will be Hamilton's second time starting a Sprint from pole, after Britain 2021 (finished P2 behind Verstappen). Leclerc also has one Sprint pole to his name, in Azerbaijan 2023 (finished P2 behind Perez).

Sprint Races wins:

11 - Verstappen (Britain 2021. Imola, Austria 2022. Austria, Belgium, COTA, Brazil 2023. China, Miami, Austria, COTA 2024). 

2 - Bottas (Monza, Brazil 2021), Piastri (Qatar 2023 & 2024). 

1 - Russell (Brazil 2022), Perez (Azerbaijan 2023), Norris (Brazil 2024).

In your opinion, can the Scuderia do it, and if not this weekend, later on in the season?

When you are on the outside, you‚Äôd obviously feel you could do better than anyone who‚Äôs in that dreaded second RB seat, but the reality is harsh, isn‚Äôt it ?

Max doesn‚Äôt seem to be overly fond of the balance  and pace of the car and I think it‚Äôs only going to get worse from here for Liam. As development and upgrades come in I expect the car to get father away from Liam as Max‚Äôs feedback will be more aggressive and in the direction that he likes.

I‚Äôm now inclined to believe that since Checo had so much more experience, we was able to nudge the development of the car in a more neutral way during the season break and used to be more comfortable with the car, often matching Max on pace in the earlier parts of the season. With Liam, with his inexperience it can‚Äôt imagine him having any say in the development direction and hence will feel more and more uncomfortable with the car as the season progresses.

It‚Äôs an unfortunate situation to be in, but I honestly don‚Äôt see him surviving a full season as it stands.

What do you guys think? ","[""Remember how we said last year to swap Checo asap because his replacement couldn't possibly do a worse job? Lmao."", ""Max is an incredibly skilled driver.

Albon's analogy on the Redbull car being computer mouse on highest sensitivity is on point. It's fast if you can take advantage of it, which Max can. Otherwise you would end up losing time and spinning, making the second seat seems to be cursed."", ""Thing is; if they swap him for Tsunoda or Hadjar, I can't see things changing that much. Hadjar or Tsunoda may get into Q2 more frequently and perhaps Q3 but a front-row lockout for Red Bull is basically impossible at this stage"", ""Checo was only really able to sort of match Max when the car had significant understeer, which basically limits what you can do with the car.

1jh5ion,I think the fact that the teams are even closer together than last year makes the Lawson situation look much worse compared to how P√©rez performed...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jh5ion/i_think_the_fact_that_the_teams_are_even_closer/,2025-03-22, Discussion,"So, a bit of a rant...

Sergio P√©rez had been with Red Bull Racing for almost three and a half years, when he suddenly started to fall off. The average gap between him and Max Verstappen in dry qualifying sessions between Imola and Abu Dhabi last year was 0.638 seconds - I'm not counting Silverstone, because P√©rez had only set one slow banker before spinning out, and I'm going with their lap times from Q3 if P√©rez made Q3 or with their lap times from the session in which P√©rez was eliminated.

The gap between Liam Lawson and Verstappen in qualifying for China today was 0.750 seconds and Lawson is only in his second race weekend with the team, and not his sixtieth or seventienth race weekend. That's a difference of just 0.750-0.638=0.112 seconds between P√©rez and Larson then. Because the field seems even closer now than it did in 2024, the same margin of sixth or seven tenths now costs a driver more positions.

Lawson is getting a lot of slander and people are immediately calling onto Red Bull to put Yuki Tsunoda in the seat alongside Verstappen, but let's be frank here. Tsunoda would not be doing any better, if he were with Red Bull Racing. You can't tell me Pierre Gasly who is now seen as a major talent for Alpine, Alexander Albon who is clearly the best driver Williams has had in many years, Sergio P√©rez who pulled off many miracles with midfielders Sauber and Force India, and Liam Lawson who is known for having been quick in many completely different cars throughout his career, are all *awful* drivers. Lawson and Tsunoda were consistently equal on pace at AlphaTauri in 2023 and at VCARB in 2024. You can't tell me Lawson's talent has just evaporated over the past winter.

A gap this relatively big can't be down to just the driver. Listen to everything Verstappen has said about the car in the last half of 2024 and now in 2025. The Red Bull car is slow and uncomfortable to drive.","['Yeah true to a certain extent. It also helped Gasly / Albon as there was a much bigger gap between top three teams and the rest. \n\nAlso made charging through the field a lot easier because you essentially need a 0.6-9s a lap advantage to pass often.', 'I think what would be really interesting is to see max on another team. The combo of him being a generational driver and his extreme style / red bulls complete focus on him makes it difficult to judge.', 'Yes, and the fact that Red Bull is entering this season already on their back foot, I would be shocked if he makes it even 5 races in if he doesn‚Äôt start delivering points now.', 'So, when is max getting promoted to RB, and who has to be dropped to red bull?', 'Sorry mate. Lawson is screwed already if we are measuring him with the low bar that is Perez. At least the bro sold many tshirts.', 'No that was actually more a case for Perez. Best example of that was Monaco qualifying last year, where he got knocked out of Q1 while being ""just"" 2 and a half tenths down on Max\'s time (this is not to say Perez wasn\'t performing horribly tho. He absolutely did, especially near the end of the year)\n\nEven accounting for the more closed up grid, the gap Lawson is losing to Max by is incredibly damning. What was it - almost a second between them? And the bigger problem is that, at least based on observations it is much worse in actual race pace\n\nStill, it\'s only been two races on the tracks he has not driven yet. It doesn\'t look good and the trend points to his immediate capitulation and collapse within that seat, but there is a relatively strong possibility he will perform better in Japan, it being a track he has on track experience with', ""Agreed re: Yuki floundering just like Lewis..\n\nWhat im not seeing are questions around Yuki, Hadjar is extremly close to Yuki's times and he's really only done 2x qualys and a sprint, isnt that more damning Yuki is not great?  He's been in this car quite awhile now."", ""Perez started out well with all his experience coming into red bull, but even that wasn't keeping him up there. It is coming to a point that if you're not Max driving the car, whether or not it is because of car being designed for him or him being able to drive around issues, you're not going to be up the top charts often enough.\xa0\n\n\nWe have seen Liam within Yuki's performances in the sister team, so it's not like he's Sargeant or even Mazepin level. Red Bull doesn't dare try their hands on a considered top driver, whether that is political or knowing they have a car fundamental issue."", ""> A gap this relatively big can't be down to just the driver.\n\nIt is down to the driver to most degree.

Back in the day, pre-internet, you had to call Duke Video in England, talk to a live person, and make sure they convert the tape from PAL format to the US-friendly NTSC standard (an extra fee). With shipping they were quite expensive. 

I'd wait weeks for them to arrive, then gleefully pop them into the VCR to enjoy.

1jgqugd,Every current F1 drivers best Quali performance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jgqugd/every_current_f1_drivers_best_quali_performance/,2025-03-21, Discussion,"In light of today's brilliant qualifying session I started thinking about what each driver on the current grids best qualifying lap is. Here is what I came up with. 

Max Verstappen - 2023 Monaco -
One of the most exciting Q3's in recent times was topped by this extraordinary effort from Max. Two tenths down going into the final sector it looked as thoigh we were getting an Alonso pole and probable win given that it's Monaco. Then Max pulled three tenths out of the bag by going oh so close and even touching some walls that had ruined his Monaco Grand Prix in his early years. 

Liam Lawson - Singapore 2023 - 
Not a massive amount of choices here but this one is great. At this point in the year it was Liams third race in F1 as he subbed in for the injured Danny Ric and he was racing for the Alpha Tauri team that had thus far scired just three points and reached Q3 just twice. Yuki was down in 15th but Liam set a lap that got him into Q3 and would lead him on a path to points. Best of all, it knocked the Red Bulls out as Max was demoted to 11th on the grid after having won 10 races running. 
This lap not only ended that streak but also was when a full time F1 drive became a serious possibility for him. 

Lando Norris - Spain 2024 - 
Lando has a few options as he excels particularly in wet weather Qualis. However it is a lap in Spain's sunny summer that stands out the most. 
It looked unlikely Max would be toppled however Lando managed to grab his first of 8 race poles in  2024 with a brilliant effort. 

Oscar Piastri - Saudi Arabia 2023 -
Yes I could have gone for one of his sprint poles or many front row laps but this lap, where he put his McLaren 8th on the grid is my favourite. 
It was Oscar's second race and his team mate Norris had gone out in Q1 in 19th. His first race in Bahrain had been disappointing as his McLaren has broken down on lap 13. But in one of the worst cars on the grid Oscar did something special under the lights in Jeddah to make Q3 and then put it 9th. Then he was promoted to 8th after Leclerc's penalty, speaking of whom...

Charles Leclerc - Sakhir 2020 -
""What?!"" I can hear you say, ""Leclerc has 26 poles and you have THIS lap as the best?"" 
Well Yes, this was only good enough for 4th on the grid, but he was in a 2020 Ferrari! And Vettel was down in 13th! Admittedly there were quite a few P4s for him that year but this stands out because when he put it in during the first runs it was good enough for second, and he had gone purple in sector one. 
The lap was so good that Charles himself got out of the car without even setting a final run and said it was an amazing lap, and Charles is usually very self critical. 

Lewis Hamilton - Singapore 2018 - 
A very highly rated lap among fans and I came up with a few contenders to beat it (Silverstone 2007, Monaco 2015, Italy 2017 Australia 2018, Styria 2020). However in Singapore 2018, it seemed Merc had only the third fastest car at a track they usually struggled at. Lewis had narrowly avoided elimination in Q2. Then suddenly he produced what Toto Wolff called the best lap he has ever seen in an F1 car as Hamilton went 1.3 seconds faster than any lap he had done so far that weekend. This was where it became evident that Vettel wasn't getting that title. 

Russell - Belgium 2021 - 
Russell's Quali laps in 2021 just keep getting better and better and after a series of Q3 appearances George blew the F1 world away by qualifying 2nd in torrential conditions that had taken out a rapid Norris.
Russell in the 8th/9th fastest car outqualified everyone except Max Verstappen and when Sundays race never started, this lap got George his first ever podium and Williams's only podium of the last 12 years.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli - China 2025 ( sprint Quali) - Yeah theres only two options and the other ones bad so moving on

Fernando Alonso - Britain 2012 - 
What a year this was for Fernando, and the best qualifying lap of his I could think of is here. It was a told turvy wet to dry session and Fernando put his upper midfield at best Ferrari on pole position by 5 hundredths if a second ahead of Mark Webber.

Lance Stroll - Turkey 2020 - 
Yeah this couldnt be anything else and is widely regarded as Lance's finest hour. On a slippery, wet, resurfaced Turkish track Lance Stroll beat Max Verstappen to go give Racing Point it's first pole since Fisichella in 2009 when it was Force India. Lance Stroll was on pole in Istanbul. (That rhymes well) 

Pierre Gasly - Las Vegas 2024 - 
Throughout 2020 and particularly 2021 Pierre Gasly put in some stunning laps but never did one impress me as much as last years third place in Las Vegas. This lap was enough to beat both Red Bulls, both McLarens, Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. And this is in a year where there was a fairly large gap between the top four amd the rest. 

Jack Doohan - China 2024 (sprint Quali) - 
Yeah only two options for Jack and this one was good as he beat Gasly. It's a shame for him Alpine seem to have been affected worse than anyone by new rear wing rules. 

Esteban Ocon - Monaco 2023 - 
The second time this fantastic qualifying has come up and this Ocon lap for P3 was special. It was the first/second runs in Q3 and you can hear the shock in commentator Alex Jacques voice when this lap puts Ocon onto provisional pole. Incredible effort that earned him a podium on race day. 

Ollie Bearman - Azerbaijan 2024 - 
Honestly today is a contender but this lap is more impressive imo. After a surprise Saudi weekend that I personally didn't rate as highly as most people Bearman was back when Magnussen got banned for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and after a messy crash in practice Bearman rebounded in stunning style to out qualify Hulkenburg and get into Q3! 

Yuki Tsunoda - Brazil 2024 -
Last weeks lap in Australia is certainly up there but I think last years lap that got him P3 on the grid on a wet and rainy Sunday morning in Brazil is his best. Yuki was incredible last season and this was the cherry on top. He seems to be driving perhaps even better this year. 

Isack Hadjar - Australia 2025 - 
Well out of the two qualifying sessions that he's partaken in being fastest of al the rookies and 11th on the grid is respectable. It will be exciting to see what he can do in the future. 

Alex Albon - Italy 2023 - 
I narrowed it down to Japan 2019 when he matched Max, and Britain, Zandvoort amd Italy 2023. 
Ultimately I went with the highest up of those in Zandvoort when Albon put it P4 on the grid. Brilliant lap in the Williams. 

Carlos Sainz - Italy 2023 - 
Qualifying on pole? in a Ferrari? in Monza?! It doenst get much better than that for a qualifying lap and Sainz sent the tifosi into ecstasy with a supreme lap to top Max Verstappen's effort and put it on pole for the race. 

Nico Hulkeburg - Brazil 2010 - 
Hulkenburg's only pole in F1 and on a drizzly day on track in Interlagos everyone wondered which of the 5 championship contenders would be on pole. 
In the end neither of the Red Bulls took pole, which was unusual in 2010, amd it wasnt a McLaren or even a Ferrari that usurped them. It was a bloody Williams. 
Rookie Hulkenburg was finding out he didn't have a drive for 2011, with Williams bringing in Maldonado for the cash. But Hulkenburg showed he belonged on that grid and set pole position. 

Gabriel Bortoleto - Australia 2025 -
Finally we arrive at Bortoleto's and his two qualifying sessions thus far have been marvellous. However getting into Q2 in Australia and knocking out Antonelli on debut reminded everyone that this Brazilian star of the future has just come off back to back F3 and F2 titles and is his best Quali so far in an F1 car though I imagine that will change many times in the coming years....

I'd be really interested to hear what you all think and what other laps spring to mind from our current grid.

\#4: Baku 2021. One of the craziest races I've ever seen got like 10 seconds of attention. I guess it doesn't REALLY fit into the narrative they built for that season, but they're not gonna be able to talk about a podium this crazy for a while!

\#6: Turkey 2020. One of the most legendary drives from one of the most legendary seasons of all time. You could have made an entire episode just about Lewis for that 2020 season. Netflix, how do you miss Silverstone AND Turkey, AND give him a shitty BLM bit at the end? Such an epic and noteworthy season from LH was done dirty.

\#8: Qatar 2024. Underrated pick, but Stake/Kick/Sauber/Alfa Romeo get no attention on DTS, so Zhou miraculously getting points to avoid a 0-point season for the team warranted some attention.

You could maybe squeak the Max-George drama in there, too, but I'm sure they'll cook with that later.

\#9: Azerbaijan 2024, specifically Williams' double points finish. I'm sure they had their hands tied with that race covering the frontrunner drama, but a DOUBLE POINTS FINISH for the team that finished 9th AND had a young driver in his 2nd ever F1 race should have been mentioned. (I get them not covering Bearman in Saudi because his race seat was all but guaranteed, so I bet they played it safe and figured they could give him more depth in Season 8, like they did with George Russell the year after Sakhir 2020.)

Ferrari and McLaren appear to have more pace overall than Red Bull and Mercedes.

But Piastri messed up in Melbourne, as did Ferrari in general. This weekend Norris has already slipped up and Ferrari is also up and down.

But Russell and Verstappen are basically maximizing every single possible outcome and picking up whatever scraps are available on Saturday and Sunday.

Is it possible for them to use this inconsistency from the 2 faster teams  to sneak the Championship without only consistent P2-3 Finishes?

Or will Mercedes and Red Bull fix their tyre deg issues soon enough to win a race or two?

1jh5akm,A theory on Ferrari and Racing Bulls strategy.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jh5akm/a_theory_on_ferrari_and_racing_bulls_strategy/,2025-03-22, Discussion,"Over the last 5 years two teams have stood out as being very poor strategy wise. 

Ferrari, who arguably could have won or at least fought a lot harder for both the 2019 and 2022 titles had they had better strategy. 

The other is Toro Rosso/Alpha Tauri/VCARB/ Racing Bulls/ Red Bull B-team/RB/ whatever you want to call them. 
Though not as talked about as Ferrari (understandable given they are a midfield team) many fans have noticed how many points they have thrown away from bad strategies. 

I would also like to throw Sauber in here as well because in 2021 they threw away points with Raikkonen and in particular Giovinazzi on a good few occasions. Since then Bottas and Zhou have also lost positions in the pit stop phase in the last few years, thoigh it's hardly ever noticed because it tends to result in a drop from P13/14 to P15/16. 

What all three of the aforementioned temas have in common is that they are the only teams based outside the Uk and as a result have more of their engineers from countries such as Italy, where English is not the first language. 

The reason this is importnat is because all the teams have to communicate to their drivers jn English, mainly for our entertainment so we understand team radio's. 

Is it possible that this is hampering these engineers efforts to quickly communicate with their drivers.

 Take Max's engineer GP for an example of the opposite. He is English and is able to use as little words as possible but still get the point across crisply and clearly. 
In fact all but 6 driver engineers on the grid (according to my research) have English as their first language. The exceptions are a Haas engineer, A Sauber one, and both Ferrari and Racimg Bulls engineers. 

So is it a coincidence that the two teams that dont have either engineers with English as their first language are also the two teams with the worst strategy? And should temas be allowed to communicate with drivers in other languages? 

I'd be really interested to hear what you all think.","[""Good theory. For example, McLaren last year were spotless in their strategy calls as they fought for the WDC and that's because they are not silly disorganized Italians. /s"", ""not speaking english as their main language doesn't have any effect on the decisions the strategy team themselves make."", "">Is it possible that this is hampering these engineers efforts to quickly communicate with their drivers.\n\nI don't think Yuki's or Lewis' engineers communicating to them in Italian would improve communication."", ""I'm always willing to blame things on Italians so sure."", ""To an extent. The 2 Italian teams do seem to have the biggest brain-farts when it comes to strategy. \n\nBut I'd also argue that really only rbr have, what I'd call, consistently good strategy calls, all other teams, over a season are mediocre at best, considering the level they're operating at."", 'where is that Sopranos meme\n\nThis is anti italian discrimination!!', 'That is plausible but you also have to consider that these teams have dedicated strategists inside the garage. They should be the brain of the live race ops (e.g. James Vowles\' ex-Merc role).\n\nWhile it\'s true that the driver has the best view on track, the garage has the big picture with more time and information to forecast and weigh decisions. \n\nI forgot which race but that infamous ""Stop inventing"" from Carlos where he was supposed to let Charles go ahead. The logic was that Carlos with better tires can protect both their positions. IIRC, that seemed very fictional because it will end in both of them being passed. \n\nIn any case, if your driver can consistently think of better strategies than your dedicated strategist/s, then what are they there for? \n\nThe ideal situation should have a strategist presenting clear choices that both the team and driver can easily weigh OR an already decided action plan to execute. \n\nPerhaps better said that all strategies presented (2-3 choices or a firm recommendation) should be so effective that no one second-guesses it.
