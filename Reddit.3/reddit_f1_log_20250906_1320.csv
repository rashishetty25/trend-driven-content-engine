Just wanted to share some frustration and perhaps also a warning. We bought tickets for an F1 experience at Monza that included a pit walk, trophy photo and a track tour.... So the starter package ü§£

Anyway long story short when we did the pit walk all the cars were covered and garages were basically closed. So you pay a lot of money.... Well for me it's a lot and you end up with this.

Anyway maybe I was expecting too much. But if you are planning doing some similar maybe ask them what time you will do the pit walk and if it will be open.

The season was also tinged with tragedy: Antonio Ascari, winner at Spa, lost his life just a month later in Montlh√©ry. The 1925 World Championship was the first world championship title assigned in the history of motorsport, and it was the first of five World Championships for Alfa Romeo, since it would be followed by the 1950 and 1951 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship and by the 1975 and 1977 World Sportscar Championships.

Fiat experienced a performance loss, culminated in the disaster of the French Grand Prix, and returned only in 1927 with the new 806.\xa0\n\n\nMercedes wasn't instead able to participate as Germany was not yet part of AIACR, they got included during 1925 so they could partecipate to the 1926 season, when they managed to win a couple of races.\n\n\nI've read a couple of explanations during the years about the reasons the San Sebastian Grand Prix wasn't included in the championship calendar. The main one is that Italy, as organiser of the championship (Arturo Mercanti, presidente of the Italian Club and founder of the Autodromo di Monza, was the one who dratfed the first regulations for the WMC), vetoed the inclusion of a grand prix in Spain in response to the ban received by Diatto and Alfieri Maserati the year prior during a hill climb race in Rabassada.\xa0""]",60,7,0.96,60,7,7,11,1,0.010000000000000009,11
