1kgt8cf,Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess did he doing good anymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kgt8cf/yuki_tsunoda_is_currently_in_a_position_where_no/,2025-05-07, Discussion,"Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess whether he is fast or slow anymore.

Yuki began 2025 with excellent pace. In Australia, he steadily maintained P5 and even overtook Ferrari for P4 after the restart, but VCARB's wrong pit stop decision destroyed everything. In China, Yuki continued to maintain good speed and secured P6 in the sprint race, with abundant opportunities to claim P8 in the main race, but once again, VCARB made an incorrect pit stop decision, and then the front wing of his car exploded...

Clearly, Yuki with VCARB raced well and proved himself as the best of the rest, even holding off some cars from the BIG 4. RB also positively evaluated that performance and promoted him to the main team.

Continuing with Red Bull, after 6 consecutive years of struggling with their second driver, they and everyone else understood that their car is undrivable for anyone except Max. Their approach with Yuki has also changed. RB has agreed to let Yuki use a setup that is ""slower but more stable.""

This also leads to some questions: how much slower is this ""slower but more stable"" setup compared to Max's setup in an ideal lap? Can Yuki with this ""slower but more stable"" setup achieve better speed than Yuki with the fastest possible setup? Yuki himself lacks experience with RB's car, so setup issues may continue throughout the season.

Anyway, Yuki's speed was immediately better than Liam's. Yuki made a mistake in Japan quali Q2, but in subsequent races, he consistently made it to Q3. Interestingly, the race where he was closest to Max's pace (Bahrain) was when RB's car completely lacked pace, and even Max had to compete with Alpine and Haas. I've also noticed that Yuki's Q3 qualifying lap times typically don't improve compared to Q2 - perhaps he's playing it safe and avoiding crashes? Maybe Yuki doesn't know how to improve his speed further when he can't adopt Max's driving style? It's very difficult to assess.","['at this point Yuki just exists', 'Yuki has been better than Lawson and miles off the mark from Max. At the end of the day that’s probably what RBR have come to terms with to accept. I reckon he’ll see the season out, because who else could they realistically throw in there at this stage?

Just to give an example, in qualifying the SF-25 was only 2 tenths better than the problematic SF-23 . Better tyres (softer), better aero after two years of work in the tunnel, good efficiency in terms of top speed and DRS, no sign of porpoising. Yet the car practically never came to life except in Jeddah. A series of performances never in line with expectations while the operation on the tyres remains unknown. The Maranello team had a bad weekend where only the sprint, thanks to the weather that mixed the cards, once again rewarded Hamilton after a desperation move. Leclerc did not even start due to the accident with the intermediates, a questionable move in terms of evaluating the conditions.\n\n\nMcLaren was untouchable, even Verstappen had to destroy his first stint to resist in vain . The Miami heat made the MCL39 more unbeatable than ever. The spectre of a summer domination that would wipe out the competition\'s motivation looms. Everything depends on the drivers\' ability to avoid making mistakes.\n\n\nFerrari\'s potential unusable, the simulator says it exists but the track doesn\'t, here\'s why Vasseur talks about it\n\n\nIt\'s not purely aerodynamic, the car is simply running with mechanical settings that are inefficient for the race, this is compromising the qualifying. For some reason the engineers can\'t get the rear suspension to work as it should. It could be a problem with the anchors or the travel. From what we understand there is a new suspension in the works that could be combined with the latest big package but the timing is unknown.\n\n\nIt is a very delicate and totally unexpected change during the season , not rapid, if nothing else it clearly indicates where the problem is and that it is not strictly aerodynamic in nature. The hope is that the corrections work as they did a year ago , after the technical direction was suddenly vacant due to the departure of Cardile (who will take up a position at Aston Martin next July). At that time Vasseur took the interim but was certainly caught off guard as we entered a delicate phase. This could be a delayed backlash, perhaps the cause of some assessments deemed insufficient on the courageous changes of the 677 project.\n\n\nHowever, Ferrari cannot endure a long season that risks seeing it at times even in fifth place.\n\nCurrently in Maranello there are already two teams, one dedicated 100% to the 678 project in the works . A phase where normally dozens of different designs are tested, some extreme, to establish where the areas of greatest profit are. DT Loic Serra was in Jeddah where things worked less badly, at least for Leclerc, he was not in Miami . On his shoulders the responsibility of a triple and burdensome commitment: thinking of a good car for next year, curing the SF-25\'s illness, implementing (a lot) the quality of the technical choices on the track.\n\n\nEveryone asks the same question and it\'s legitimate: couldn\'t the Ferrari SF-24 have been further refined instead of changing it ""99%""?\n\n\nChanging the aerodynamic balance to focus more on the front end required a completely different overall geometry. Tweaking the gearbox and reducing the overall dimensions of the rear suspension did not pay off . The trap was just around the corner but could not have been foreseen in the simulations that only gave gains without any drawbacks. For better or for worse, the Venturi cars will remain among the most unpredictable and unreadable in the history of F1.\n\n\nAfter the stormy (in every sense) American weekend, it is worth underlining the words of the seven-time world champion reported by the BBC which now perhaps seem clearer: ""I think this car has really good performance. Something is holding us back at the moment, it\'s there, we just can\'t use it . Until we have a solution for that, this is where we are"" signed Lewis Hamilton.', ""The only good takeaway from this is that Serra had nothing to do with the design of the SF25, so that gives me hope he may yet come good on the 2026. car. As for the SF25 it might end up scrapped as it's simply not worth it to invest too much time trying to catch a soon to be 200 point deficit when you have a regulations shift next season. They should have done this switch for last  year and then this year the car would be right up there to try and steal a title before the reg switches.\n\nEither way, it's easy to talk shit now, gonna be a long one boys, strap in and hope for some miracles :D"", 'https://preview.redd.it/xxxzywsvzbze1.jpeg?width=702&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d9866ea85ee53e9a14cc654d6aaac6bd584888e', 'Someone let Fred “potential” Vasseur know that it’s more than a small balance issue.', 'I will keep praying for upgrades that make Ferrari two seconds faster than everyone else 🙏', 'didnt they decide to redesign the car for 2025 precisely because of the suspension?\n\nthe unintentional comedy of ferrari cannot be understated', 'If this new suspension comes in Silverstone or Spa then what’s the point?

Maybe not because he supported Doohan and wanted to keep him in the seat, though -- probably because Briatore wields a lot of influence behind the scenes. Oakes always felt like a temporary figure in the team, especially given the talk that Renault are looking to sell it. Given that he aligned himself with the Mazepins, I don't think Oakes is some paragon of moral virtue; rather, I think he's playing Pilate and washing his hands of it.

They usually ignore his Lotus years which really put him on the map. He easily beat De Angelis and would have challenged for the title with better reliability.\n\nRosberg 1985 - Rosberg is frequently referred to as the worst champion ever, something I cannot get my head around. 1985 was him at his best, thrashing Mansell and similarly to Senna would have fought for the title with better reliability.\n\nSchumacher 1993 - Senna is frequently praised for his heroics in 1993, but I think Schumacher was almost as good. He thrashed Patrese by a far greater margin than Mansell or Piquet could and finished on the podium every race he finished despite driving the third best car.']",4,24,0.64,4,21,21,1,8,0.0,1

At least Schumacher had the H2H on his side versus KMag.\xa0\n\n\nI'd rather they go for drivers that haven't done basically pretty much a whole career already, but I understand that as a new team they need at least one experienced driver.\n\n\nThey could do like Audi and pair one veteran with a rookie or they could put two veterans in there and decide which of them is better suited for the long run.\xa0\n\n\nAs for Mick Schumacher specifically, I wouldn't mind either way. I think he didn't really get a fair shot the first time around (HAAS truly was a mess in his rookie season on pretty much all fronts),\xa0but I also think that we're three years on from when he left and his time might have simply just past.\xa0\n\n\nI guess no matter how many seats there are in F1 someone will still miss out."", ""He's doing pretty well in WEC, he should just sta there and focus on that."", 'If they pick both Checo and Mick, you know they are here for the marketing.', ""People keep downvoting the Schumacher articles like it's baseless speculation, it's not, reliable sources are saying he's holding talks.\n\nImo though, if Cadillac want safe, experienced drivers then it's very obvious you should put Checo and Valtteri in the car, you get good feedback from two very experienced drivers and their skillsets mean you'll know exactly how good the car is on it's tyres and in qualifying respectively because they're both very strong in those areas. But I'm guessing they don't want two older dropped drivers, it might give off a retirement home vibe."", 'Shumacher to Cadillac, Doohan takes his spot in WEC, \n\nUnlikely but hey, it’s something', ""Surely this is the last possible year where Schumacher has a halfway viable shot at a seat, right?\n\nHe'll have been out of F1 for 3 full seasons going into 2026. At some point, the gap (combined with his age and his performance in F1) is not going to worth it for teams, especially since he's been passed over multiple times already. \n\nWhy pick him when Bottas or Pérez are available? I like him a lot, but I just can't see what the upside would be.""]",0,77,0.34,0,573,573,0,0,0.0,0
