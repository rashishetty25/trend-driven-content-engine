McLaren: They have give us a close driver battle for a lot of the year, plus the team seems to have absolutely nailed car development considering this is the final year of these regulations. 

Mercedes: They have been fairly consistent throughout the season and I don't recall any major strategy errors. It's this sort of consistency that makes them a powerhouse and kept someone like George Russell in the running for so long.

Red Bull: Outstanding resilience and Max's resurgence has been absolutely incredible to witness. There was of course the huge controversy and turbulence with the Horner fiasco, but the team seems to have moved past it fairly successfully and swiftly.

Ferrari: The team has always tried to do something different and make something of a difficult year. There have obviously been some serious issues, but I respect the team throwing the dice on some strategies. 

Williams: What an amazing demonstration of team evolution and new organisation can achieve! JV should be incredibly proud of what has happened and looks set to continue happening. 

Racing Bulls: Always in the shadow of the bigger sister team, but has been punching way above its weight. The one-lap pace has been awesome and there seems to be a lot of effort behind the scenes to train the newer drivers. 

Aston Martin: I think their investments into new personnel this year will see them have a similar resurgence to Williams in the coming years. They just need to be cut-throat and efficient to make it happen as soon as possible with the new regulations. 

Haas: For a team that is notoriously small and underfunded, they are achieving some excellent results (especially with Bearman) and doing all this with new drivers and personnel has shown how well the organisation is blending behind the scenes. 

Kick Sauber: Another team that has managed to punch above its weight by taking advantage of some chaotic moments and utilising unorthodox strategies. Nico's podium obviously being a standout moment! 

Alpine: After a turbulent start to the year with lots of controversy around driver changes, personnel changes, and what seemed like a lack of cohesion, the French outfit has shown some flashes of brilliance in the second half of the year when they get everything lined up.
