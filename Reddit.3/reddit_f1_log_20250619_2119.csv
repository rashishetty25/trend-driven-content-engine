Before downvoting, note this is just a speculative discussion not a claim of absolute truth.

  
**TLDR:** Vettel‚Äôs peak was surprisingly short, his driving style was only perfectly suited to the V8 era. When the turbo-hybrid regulations arrived in 2014, he declined massively and this accidentally inflated the reputations of drivers like Ricciardo, Norris, and Leclerc.

**Vettel** had no wins in 2014, the car was not the best but still fast. His performance at Ferrari was inconsistent, and against Stroll he was very similar to Perez (both scored around 65% of team points).

When **Ricciardo** joined Red Bull in 2014 (beginning of turbo-hybrid) Vettel was a 4x WDC but not a top driver anymore, still Daniel's stock grew exponentially . Ricciardo did well in RB, but was outperformed by a teenage Verstappen (for context Max entered F1 at 17 Hamilton at 22).

  Ricciardo‚Äôs reputation stayed very high, so naturally when **Norris** destoroyed him, Norris became one of the hot shots of F1.

  With **Leclerc** I will be careful, he is undeniably fast, and he does look stronger than 40-year-old Hamilton now. But was his early reputation also boosted by beating a fading Vettel?

*Bonus Conspiracy Angle:* Lawrence Stroll knew about  the Vettel effect and signed him to Aston Martin to make Lance look better.



Q: Without Vettel would we rate Ricciardo, Norris, and Leclerc differently?","[""2015 is one of Vettel's strongest seasons and ruins your argument from the get go.\n\nVettel was also really good in 2017 and ultimately lost the title on a series of 4 coinflips those being the Silverstone tire failure, Singapore start calamity, Japan spark plug failure and Malaysia engine failure\n\nAs for Leclerc. No his reputation was high because he was one of the best young tallents to graze the junior ladder in a while. He also backed up that tallent in F1 straight away and more than proved himself already."", 'He didn‚Äôt decline massively. He was still great until mid 2018 and even after he had skme great flashes. We can see that with the results he had. \n\nEvent in Aston Martin he was putting some great drives ala Alonso now. He was the scapegoat in that Arivabenne/Binotto Ferrari and they fucked him over in so many occasions. \n\nActually, I think we can see how GOOD he was when we compare other drivers before and after him in that Ferrari as the team didn‚Äôt really change all that much. \n\nHe is one of the greatest drivers for sure and he was battling that insane Merc on his own during those super domonant years. \n\nLeclerc, Norris or Ricciardo were/are simply NOT on that level yet/never were.', ""I think you're massively downplaying his time at Ferrari\n\nHe was the only consistent challenger to Mercedes from 2015 - 2018\n\nNot to mention he had some brilliant drives at Aston, which proved he wasn't as washed as we believed he was"", ""Norris catching strays here.\nEveryone was shocked at how bad RIC performed in McLaren, but it was more about him being very poor in that team.\n\nNorris showed good pace from his first season, before being teamed up with RIC, and still does. There's people overestimating him, due to a very good car since last season, but it has nothing to do with RIC and much less so with VET.\n\nLEC proved he's fast in junior formulas, in Alfa, and in Ferrari, independent of VET.\n\nAs a certain driver would say, stop inventing."", ""Leclerc rinsed Sainz (look up their Ferrari career H2Hs, it's not far off 2:1 in both quali and races) and Sainz is rated *very* highly nowadays. If anything, people still chronically underrate Leclerc."", '> His performance at Ferrari was inconsistent \n\nMy friend if you only count his Ferrari stint he would still be top 20 in wins all time', ""You might have had a point if 2015 and 2017 hadn't happened lol"", 'No, I\'m not buying it. Daniel managed to keep up with Verstappen in 2017 and 18 just fine in the races where both finished. 19 and 20 with Renault showed it wasn\'t just the car for me. 21 and 22 were quite odd indeed, but we\'ve seen good drivers fuck up part of their career due to moving to the wrong team for their psychological needs in the past.\n\nNorris and Leclerc I both rate equally; Fast drivers, but make mistakes too often still despite their experience and then go to blame themselves too soon and seem like they\'re too harsh on themselves to be able to win championships. Not without a psychologist at least.\n\nThough you are right about Seb himself, he definitely struggled once the rules changed and the way to drive the cars fast got flipped on it\'s head. I believe this is what the youth call ""skill issue"" though, as other drivers can adapt their driving style around the car as opposed to vice versa', ""One thing I don't understand about many F1 fans is that they simultaneously understand that F1 success is primarily about machinery while also believing that when a driver no longer has the success he used to have it's because they weren't as good as they used to be.""]",0,33,0.3,0,28,28,0,11,0.010000000000000009,0
