How did Nico Hülkenberg pull off the Sauber sensation? Why did Red Bull opt for three stops? Did Charles Leclerc\'s strategy pay off? We answer the remaining questions in our race analysis.**\n\n> **Why did Red Bull choose a three-stop strategy?**\nAt the beginning of the race, things were going quite well for Max Verstappen. He overtook Lando Norris in the McLaren in the very first corner and moved into second place. But by lap 12, the Dutchman was already reporting that he lacked grip compared to the McLarens and was soon overtaken by Norris.\n\n> The first pit stop followed on lap 13, switching from soft to soft tires. ""We had already committed to a three-stop strategy,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. The next service was scheduled for lap 29, with Verstappen getting medium tires. The final scheduled stop didn\'t happen until lap 47. The four-time world champion returned to the track on soft tires.\n\n> ""We had to take some risks to have a chance. And that was the three-stop strategy,"" explained Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko. In terms of tire wear, they were inferior to McLaren in the 29-degree air temperature and 50-degree track temperature. It\'s the signature discipline of the Papaya racers.\n\n> In that respect, it was positive that they were on track until the safety car was deployed on lap 55 following the engine failure of Kimi Antonelli\'s Mercedes, and that they were projecting a podium finish. At one point, they even came very close to McLaren. ""We were closer than we thought until the safety car and did everything right,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner.\n\n> ""The problem was that our tires didn\'t last long enough, and McLaren\'s middle stint was very strong. Our only chance was the undercut with the soft tires at the end."" McLaren was alert and countered immediately. And then had racing luck on its side, as Horner explains. ""The safety car deployed at the worst possible time in terms of our strategy. Max was on eight-lap-old soft tires, which were worn out.""\n\n> The problem: He had no alternatives available. Although he had a new set of soft tires and three used sets of soft tires on his list, one of them had already been discarded due to use in qualifying and the drive to the starting grid. So, only a new set of the hard compound remained.\n\n> The decision: plague or cholera. Verstappen said: ""Maybe it would have been better to stay out. But hindsight is always 20/20."" According to Horner, they would have been eliminated. The hard option, however, was anything but ideal. ""He was really bad in the warm-up,"" analyzed Marko. ""If you take risks, things can sometimes go in the wrong direction.""\n\n> **Was Verstappen’s collision with Russell intentional?**\nAfter the restart on lap 61, things got heated for Verstappen and everyone he encountered on the track. First, the Red Bull driver slid off the track almost by himself in the RB21 on the hard tires. A few seconds later, he clashed with Charles Leclerc. The two touched.\n\n> The Ferrari driver explained the situation on the home straight as follows: ""It was a battle for position on the track, to get the slipstream of the McLaren. Max wanted to push me to the inside, and I didn\'t want to go there, so I tried to push him off. I tried to push him to the left. There was a little contact, but luckily without consequences. I knew he would have a tough time on the hard tires."" The incident was investigated, but no penalty was imposed.\n\n> Unlike the clash with George Russell in the Mercedes, which began with Verstappen having to leave the track to avoid the Briton, who had attempted to overtake in Turn 1. The team feared that the stewards would impose a penalty on him for gaining an advantage. So they asked Verstappen to relinquish the position.\n\n> But that really riled the 27-year-old. Instead of simply letting Russell through, he rammed into the Englishman\'s car at Turn 5. This resulted in a penalty: 10 seconds, meaning only one point for tenth place instead of a podium finish. Nico Rosberg even called for a disqualification on Sky UK.\n\n> Russell commented on the situation: ""I was just as surprised as you. I\'ve seen maneuvers like this in simulation games and go-karting, but never in Formula 1.""\n\n> Red Bull team boss Horner declined to comment immediately after the race because he hadn\'t yet spoken to his driver. Marko said: ""We didn\'t anticipate that the tires would be so bad during the warm-up phase. There was a certain amount of frustration, which was reflected in the driving style.""\n\n> What\'s annoying in retrospect from Red Bull\'s perspective: After the race, it turned out that Verstappen had been cleared by the stewards for the original offense of ""track leaving."" So, there was no need to order a swap at all. ""It would be nice if the referees would just say: Keep going or give the place back,"" Horner expressed his hope.\n\n> When asked about the intent, Verstappen replied: ""Does that matter?"" Strictly speaking, yes. Because that might have made a difference in the punishment. The Dutchman got off with a 10-second time penalty and three penalty points for his maneuver against Russell. If the stewards had ruled it intentional, it would have been four, and Verstappen would have received a one-race ban. As it is, he\'s still one point away from that. He now has to behave himself until June 30th.\n\n(1/2)', ""Man can steer perfectly around corners in quali mode and gets hailed a god, but cannot brake in time to avoid a collision after giving a place back.\n\nIt was intentional and we all know it, should have been a Black flag (said the same about Vettel Baku - you cannot do this in grass roots so why formula 1 (because it's a drama with less rules)) \n\nBut should be 4 points and race ban since he meant it...

1l1czlu,Built an F1 data dashboard as a side project – would love some feedback!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l1czlu/built_an_f1_data_dashboard_as_a_side_project/,2025-06-02, Technical,"Hi all,

I’ve been working on a side project over the past few months: an F1 data dashboard that pulls together various insights from the current season. I was looking for something that showed more than just the basic standings and helped visualise how the season is progressing. I thought others might find it useful too.

At the moment, the site includes:

- The most recent race weekend (pole sitter, pole time, race winner)

- The full race calendar with upcoming event dates

- Bar charts for driver and constructor championship standings

- Charts showing which drivers and constructors have taken the most pole positions

- The fastest pit stop of the season, including who set it and at which race

- A scatter plot showing average qualifying position vs race finish for each driver

- A line graph tracking finishing positions for the top 5 drivers across the season

The dashboard updates automatically after each race and qualifying session, so it stays current throughout the season. I’ve tried to keep the design clean and simple, aiming to make the data accessible without being overwhelming: it’s not trying to replace big analytics tools.

I’d really appreciate any feedback, particularly around what other insights might be interesting to include or ways I could improve the current layout.

Thanks for taking a look. Hopefully it adds a bit of extra context to race weekends.","['Looks nice but the charts are weird on mobile.
