1irvwr3,What if Bernie Ecclestone's medals idea was implemented for 2009 and beyond,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1irvwr3/what_if_bernie_ecclestones_medals_idea_was/,2025-02-17, Discussion,"I was curious to see if anything would change if Bernie Ecclestone's medals regulation was in place for 2009 and beyond, and after studying race results from 2009 to 2024, here are the results I found 

(P.S. I had to make up a tiebreaker on the fly for 2010)

2009: Jenson Button (5 wins)

2010: Tie between Vettel & Alonso (5 wins each, though Vettel is declared champion by having more 4th place finishes than Alonso)

2011: Sebastian Vettel (11 wins)

2012: Sebastian Vettel (5 wins)

2013: Sebastian Vettel (13 wins)

2014: Lewis Hamilton (11 wins)

2015: Lewis Hamilton (10 wins)

2016: Lewis Hamilton (10 wins)

2017: Lewis Hamilton (9 wins)

2018: Lewis Hamilton (11 wins)

2019: Lewis Hamilton (11 wins)

2020: Lewis Hamilton (11 wins)

2021: Max Verstappen (10 wins)

2022: Max Verstappen (15 wins)

2023: Max Verstappen (19 wins)

2024: Max Verstappen (9 wins)
