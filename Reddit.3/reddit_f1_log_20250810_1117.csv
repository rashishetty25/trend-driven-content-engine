1mlnh3q,"Now it’s summer break, how do you think Helmut Marko’s rookie report card panned out?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mlnh3q/now_its_summer_break_how_do_you_think_helmut/,2025-08-09, Discussion,"Ahead of Australia, Helmut Marko offered his assessment of the 5 rookies who begun the season to Servus TV.

As a reminder, he rated them as follows:

Kimi Antonelli: “He is clearly an elite driver, although he is under enormous pressure. His performance is impressive: he has already driven around 10,000 test kilometres, but he has also had two serious accidents. You can feel the pressure on him. And, of course, Toto Wolff wants to repeat the Verstappen story at Mercedes. However, going straight to an elite team will be a challenge for him. But in terms of potential, he is certainly a top driver.”

Oliver Bearman: “He is a very fast driver, although he had a lot of accidents in Formula 2 and Formula 3 because he takes big risks. He goes to the limit. Maybe he won’t get to the top as fast as Antonelli, but he’s definitely a standout.”

Isack Hadjar: “Hadjar lost the championship by only four or five points [sic]. Our data analysts calculated that he lost about 80 points due to technical failures and other problems. So he is very fast. I would say that if he continues to develop well and learn to control his emotions, he has A-level potential as well.”

Gabriel Bortoleto: “I would classify him as a ‘B’ driver. He’s a very intelligent driver: he won the Formula 3 championship, but with only one win and he usually stays out of trouble. In Formula 2 he only managed two victories. He is a driver who brings the car home safely, has a good command of strategy and tyre management, but I don’t see that pure speed in him.”

Jack Doohan: “He is a ‘C’. I don’t think he will complete the season.”

Obviously he was right about Doohan not completing the season, but what do you think of his assessments of the other rookies? They’re fairly detailed, which is why I think they warrant a bit of discussion now we’ve seen races from them all. ","['Bortelerto underrated by him and maybe Bearman overrated but otherwise accurate', ' Overall except for Bortoleto he was pretty spot on.', ""I mean great take on Hadjar. I think he's bang on the money - they've got an A class driver whose career they can ruin by demoting him to RB."", ""I think it's pretty spot on. And it's not like he's particularly off about Bortoleto either. Most were sleeping on him as well during the most part of the pre summer break stint.

I cannot find any information on how those specific crossings - the parts were the F1 track crossed the horse racing track - were managed.



There are only to options, both seem problematic: either the horse racing track was paved over or the GP circuit was covered with sand/earth/dirt/whatever it is that a horse racing circuit is made of.

If they paved it, they had to remove the asphalt after every Grand Prix to make it useable for the horses again.

If they put sand over persisting asphalt, wouldn't that still be noticeable during the horse races or maybe even be bad for the horse's legs?

  
Any information on this topic would be much appreciated!","['At Aintree the crossing points are actually public roads - Melling road which you can look up on Google maps is the road. \n\nThe horse racing has multiple layouts, the only one with crossover is the Grand National.
