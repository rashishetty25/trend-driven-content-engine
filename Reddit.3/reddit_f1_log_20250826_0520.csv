But I loved the strategies based on fuel. Light, slower cars could challenge heavy, better cars. More pit stops. More possibilities of mistake, but also unexpected advantage.

There were some accidents in the past but I’m sure it can be made safer and with possible electric direction. It should be safer I assume?

What do you think?","[""The big argument against refuelling isn't safety - though that certainly is an argument - it's that it kills the racing.
