1hmkuul,Trip to Modena and Maranello,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hmkuul/trip_to_modena_and_maranello/,2024-12-26, Discussion,"Hello, 
My wife and I are planning a trip to the Modena and Maranello museums soon. I know there have been many posts about visiting these museums, but I’m unsure how up-to-date the information is, and I still have a few questions.

1. How do we get from Modena to Maranello and back? We’ll be traveling by train from Bologna to Modena and back. I’ve seen that there’s a shuttle bus on the museum website, but the timetable seems a bit inconvenient. Are there any better options for getting between the two museums? And if there's a bus between them, how do we get the tickets?

2. Can we visit both museums in one day, or would you recommend dedicating a full day to each?

3. I read in another post that someone recommended taking a guide during the visit, but I didn’t see this option when booking tickets online. Is it possible to hire a guide on-site?

4. I’ve never used a simulator before—not even on a PC. Would the F1 simulator experience still be worth it, or would it likely be frustrating since I’m a complete beginner?

5. Are there any must-visit spots near the museums? This could be anything—great places to eat, nice walking areas, or other attractions in the vicinity.

6. Are there any must-buy souvenirs from either museum, or are there better shops nearby?
Is photography allowed in the museums, and are there any specific spots that are particularly great for photos?

Thanks in advance for your advice and tips!","['I did both this year in August.\n\n1.\tWe had a car so I can’t talk about transit unfortunately, we parked at Fiorano and got the coach in to Maranello. \n2.\tWe did both in the same day, it was just right, not too much to do at all. \n3.\tWe didn’t book a guide or feel like it was necessary.
