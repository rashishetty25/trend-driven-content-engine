1nr9x6b,"(ESPN) Alonso's first F1 title, 20 years later: 'He was just another level'",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nr9x6b/espn_alonsos_first_f1_title_20_years_later_he_was/,2025-09-26, News,,"['Really like those last few paragraphs.\n\n>  He is often framed as the unluckiest driver of this generation, although he takes a philosophical approach to that question.\n\n> ""Good luck, bad luck ... I think it\'s been 50-50, to be honest,"" Alonso said. ""The thing is that when you do 400-plus races, there are a lot of races with good luck and a lot of races with bad luck. But I think everything compensated, and even when I went to Le Mans, the second Le Mans, we were two minutes behind the leader one hour before the end and then they had a puncture, then they had a wheel that was not properly done, then they had a double pit stop ... then I won the second Le Mans. That was a lot of luck on our side. Everything compensated.""\n\n> But, in finishing that answer, Alonso said it better than anyone else could, something that he and many other Formula 1 fans will hope he has a chance to put right one day.\n\n> ""But [that it\'s been] over 20 years [since my championship] and maybe more than 10 years since I won my last F1 grand prix ... it doesn\'t sound right to me.""', 'F1 was a very different sport back then. While I agree Alonso has been unlucky not to win more championships, he was also fortunate to pick up the titles in 2005 and 2006. Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone never liked seeing one team dominate, and when Schumacher and Ferrari started winning almost every race in 2002, the FIA began looking for ways to rein them in. The qualifying format was switched to single-lap runs, which exposed Ferrariâ€™s weakness with tire warm-up and limited Schumacherâ€™s usual strategy of starting heavier on fuel. The points system was also revised to keep the championship battle closer for longer. Things got so extreme after 2002 that Mosley even floated ideas like adding ballast to the championship-winning car or reversing the starting grid.\n\nThe real turning point for Ferrari came with the one-tire rule in 2005. It was no secret that Bridgestones degraded faster than Michelins, and the regulation change effectively swung the advantage toward Micheli supplied teams. That allowed Renault and Alonso to capitalize, even though Ferrari still had a strong,if tricky car. Renaultâ€™s rapid engine development also paid off when V10s were banned in 2006. Had Ferrari been able to carry its early-2000s advantage forward, itâ€™s an open question whether Alonso would have still won those two titles.', ""The starts those Renaults had back then were crazy.  Alonso would make up 2-5 positions every race. \n\nThey're launch was twice as fast as every other team."", ""And he still is. Only Max and Russell are driving better this year. Can't wait for him to have a real car under him in 2026!"", 'It does seem fucked up that someone like Alonso has gone 10+ years without a win. Talk about wasted potential. Second McLaren stint ruined his latter half career. \n\nAt least with Ferrari, he fought and had chances to win championships.', ""> The qualifying format was switched to single-lap runs,\n\nNow now now.... are you really trying to say that was because of trying to limit Ferrari, and not the sponsors of teams having spent years complaining they got no TV time.  \n\nIf so, I've some Arizona beachfront property to sell you.  \n\nIt was even known at the time that single-lap quali was so the not so fast cars that never got TV time, got TV time for their sponsors.  \n\nI'm afraid to read past that point in fear of what other untruths you are selling."", ""The F2005 was probably  still a good car, even though Ross Brawn said they kinda underestimated the Technical changes for that year on the chassis side as well, but the car  could never show its potential thanks to the  Bridgestone tires. \nThe only time they got it working in the race  by luck was Imola when Ferrari had a catastrophic qualy, only for Schumacher to absolutely fly on Sunday ( Rubinho was nowhere again).\n\nIn Qualy Schumacher was capable to get some results, but it was obvious that the car didn't do what the drivers wanted. \n\nStill Schumacher beat one Renault and one McLaren in the championship , but in reality they never had a shot in the title fight to be honest.\n\nThe fact the FIA reverted that insanely dumb tire rule 12 months  later shows you how desperate they really were."", "">Alonso has gone 10+ years without a win\n\nAlthough I still can't believe we live in the timeline where Max stole Alonso's pole (and most likely win) in Monaco in the shortest sector on the entire calendar."", ""He's definitely a little infamous for having like an additional 3 championships just beyond his grasp"", ""It is fucked up, but he had to leave Ferrari. He was sick of finishing 2nd.\n\nI remember in a press conference at the time he said that if Ferrari finish 2nd in 2015 he has made the right move. Hindsight is a wonderful of course, but he couldn't keep doing the same thing and expecting different results. He just had to do something different.""]",475,23,0.94,475,595,595,41,3,-0.010000000000000009,41
