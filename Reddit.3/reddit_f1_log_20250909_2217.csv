I think the top teams besides McLaren seem to have drivers that are the clear favorite. Russel at Mercedes, Max at Red Bull, Charles in Ferrari. I think you could maybe argue Kimi next year and Hamilton might improve but that’s an interesting if.

Towards the midfield the Williams pair I think are a clear favorite. Albon and Sainz in a battle would be intense. I think it’s clear to say Albon has proved he is good enough to match and beat Carlos, now if in a title battle Albon might fall to pressure more than Carlos? I think that’s a question that still means a fight would go long between the two.

Honorable mentions, Haas I think would have some really interesting veteran versus fast young kid. We will see if 2026 has an underdog story or a top team nailing it or if we’re lucky a close front two teams and a title battle! :)","['I agree with your picks.

1ncomu6,Thought experiment with Oscar v Lando,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ncomu6/thought_experiment_with_oscar_v_lando/,2025-09-09, Statistics,"After last weekend, I decided to run a little experiment. It turned out to be more eye-opening than I expected, because I thought it would confirm something I already believed—but instead, it showed me something completely different.

With a little help from AI, I used random number generation to adjust Oscar Piastri’s form to reflect how he performed last year.

Looking back at all of his finishes from 2024, his average was 5.1 with a standard deviation of 3.0. So the idea was to simulate his current season as if he hadn’t improved, using last year’s stats as the baseline. I thought this would create a model where Lando was clearly McLaren’s number one driver.

My assumption going in was that, if Oscar wasn’t consistently near the front, Max Verstappen would be seriously challenging Lando and might be ahead. 

Here’s how I set it up: I left all other drivers’ positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spots based on that statistical profile, promoting the drivers ahead of him. For example, in my model he finished third at Spa instead of winning. There were a few other adjustments like that, but he still only finished outside the points once and even got two wins, which felt realistic.

What I actually ended up with was Lando leading Max by about 70 points. Behind them, there’s roughly a 60-point gap to George Russell, followed by Charles and Oscar close together, about 50 points ahead of Lewis, with Kimi and Alex another 50 points back.

So what I learned is this: Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar’s form stayed at last year’s level.

I’m Australian, so of course I’d love to see Oscar win the whole thing, but I’ll happily say this: Lando is fantastic this year. And unsurprisingly, even in this model, McLaren is running away with the Constructors’ Championship.","['There’s a reason people get degrees in statistics and other fields. \n\nWhat you’ve done is throw darts in the dark to draw a conclusion with no objective meaning. \n\nJust saying “AI” doesn’t make something meaningful or correct.\n\nOf course Lando has been good.

If you're cruising over your team mate, and winning against other teams comfortably, there isnt the pressure to find those extra 0.010's."", "">\xa0Lando has improved drastically this year\n\nHow did you conclude that Lando improved and not that McLaren's car did relative to the rest of the field?"", ""Lando hasn't improved on last year, McLaren have relative to RedBull.\n\nIn 2024 Verstappen won 7/12 of the first half of the season, but only 2/12 of the second half. Lando and Max drove pretty consistently at their respective levels across the season with the performance of the cars being what changed."", "">Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar’s form stayed at last year’s level.\n\nWhy would you make the assumption that Piastri's form has stayed the same as last year?
