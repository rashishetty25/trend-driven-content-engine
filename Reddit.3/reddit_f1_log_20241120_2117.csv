1gvlj3z,Liam Lawson Highlights Major issue with junior Formula categories,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gvlj3z/liam_lawson_highlights_major_issue_with_junior/,2024-11-20, News,,"['TL;DR: the F1 car and F2 car are so different that it’s hard to predict how good someone’s going to be, so rookie FP1s and tests are really important.', 'Logan Sargeant is a prime example of what he is saying', 'i remember him saying in a podcast that F3(?) is more similar to F1 than F2 is or something along those lines', 'Formula 2 is just a means for milking rich families and F1 academies at this point. The cars are hopelessly out of step with the characteristics of F1 cars and the discrepancies in car performance that exist due to a lack of testing and availability of spare parts will never be solved because that would require them actually putting their hand in their own pocket.', 'That is why Super Formula is seen as a finishing school. It has more downforce, power steering(F2 does not. Professional drivers(meaning you have guys in the series for a few years and know the thing inside out), and you need to learn new circuits so it also does not aid the F2 graduates.', ""The thing is that junior Formula series used to scale pretty decently. Every move up the ladder means a car that is faster, brakes harder, has more downforce and experiences more G-forces. The tech increases every step and so does complexity, but in the end setup works largely the same. Pretty clear cut.\n\nHowever, nowadays driving an F1 car is way more than just driving as hard as you can. Many of the younger drivers will quite easily be quick over a few laps in an F1 car. To do good in an F1 race tough, that's where the scaling between F1 and junior categories falls on its ass.\n\nMedia and social media pressure is immense, but that has, at least in some part, always been the case for the sport so I'm going to leave that out if it. What is incredibly different is that an F1 driver nowadays has to be able to read a car a lot better and a lot more than they used to.\n\nTake braking. Before the introduction of hybrid elements a driver could basically only modify their brake balance in the car. Nowadays it's brake balance, brake migration (the shifting of brake balance depending on the brake phase), the amount of energy harvesting / '(hybrid) engine braking' etc. Those settings don't exist in any of the other cars and can greatly mess with a drivers ability to be on the absolute limit (Ricciardo's McLaren comments for example).\n\nThan there's conservation of energy and tires. So much of F1 nowadays is centred around keeping the tires alive long enough without them falling off the infamous cliff and making sure you don't use too much fuel. In essence, the car does not carry enough fuel to go a full race distance on full-send mode, so they need to conserve that energy. For most (junior) drivers this is a rather foreign concept as during the junior races they can easily just fill the car up and go all-out for the full distance. Being able to feel the car, being right on the edge of what the tires can do and what fits your fuel target is something incredibly finicky and not all drivers are great at doing so. Combine that with either having to attack or defend for position on track and you've got a complex task that they aren't taught from an early age.\n\nDrivers like De Vries are great examples. He's shown that he's a fast driver in plenty of categories, but he lacks the skill-set a driver needs to perform in F1."", 'Pretty sure Yuki was never even given any FP session before his call up.', 'The major issue with the Junior Formulas is the lack of spaces and opportunity on the top category.\n\n\nYou have old and washed drivers holding on spots on mid-and-back field and some even on top teams...

1gvx4ox,Penalty point distribution analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gvx4ox/penalty_point_distribution_analysis/,2024-11-20, Statistics,"**Intro**  
After seeing a picture of the top 10 most penalized drivers circulating online, I was curious about the probability of the current penalty point distribution among nationalities. So, I did a small analysis of the current distribution. And found some interesting results I would like to share, mostly to ask for help in improving the analysis from the community. Please don't take this as an excuse to express gut feelings over bias. Some of the results may be highly unlikely but none of the results are beyond possible. I'm also no journalist, just an F1 nerd!

**Summary**  
I collected all data I could find about penalty points given per driver and the races they participated in per year. To this, I added the nationality they race under (Albon is Thai in the analysis). I then assumed penalty points to be normally distributed. I analyzed the result per nationality and took the variance from the mean as a measure. When you only take into consideration nationalities from which driver partook in at least 100 races you get the following results.

As many noted in the original post given the amount of races driven by British drivers they are quite absent in the top 10. The likelihood of this given this analysis would be around 14% (50% for the mean - 36%). Although highly unlikely not improbable. It could however be a signal of potential bias, yet I wouldn't go as far based on the current analysis.

Another interesting result is that both Russia and the Netherlands, have quite the variance from the mean. However drivers such as Kyvat, Mazepin, and Verstappen, who are more generally deemed aggressive drivers the results are more understandable.

**Discussion**  
I feel the analysis could be quite a lot better, and for that, I'm hoping some of the kind souls of r/Formula1  would be willing to assist. I'm yet to find a good index or database with all penalty points per race. I have found this up until 2021, but after that, I'm reliant on articles that don't specify where the points were given.

The results would also mean more if it would take into consideration all infringements investigated by the stewards. That would further improve the reliability of the analysis.

Beyond that assuming the results would be normally distributed is a stretch, even though the dataset is large, it fails to take into consideration all nuances of motorsport. This however is the best method I could come up with to check the results for potential bias.
