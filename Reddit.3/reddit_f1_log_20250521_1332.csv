What I know is that teams are required to use 3 tyre sets during the GP, not two pitstops, but the effect is the same.

What if a driver heads to the pits, changes its tyres and at the end of the very next lap they do so again. Would that constitute as 3 tyre sets used? They would never have crossed the start-finish line on track in this case. 

What if a team changes tyres twice during the same pitstop? After the first tyre change the driver moves 1cm and then they do the next change. 

What are other loopholes that may be exploited and are they closed by the regulations?","['I imagine if there were to be a safety car for multiple laps cars would pit once complete the lap and then pit immediately again whilst the safety car is still out.\n\nIt‚Äôs going to look ridiculous when this happens and Charles Leclerc somehow gets shafted again by it.', 'tyres are considered used once the driver leaves the pit lane\n\n>30.5 c) Tyres fitted in the pit lane will be deemed to have been used once the car‚Äôs timing transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane with these tyres fitted. Tyres fitted on the grid will be deemed to have been used when the car leaves its grid position under its own power with these tyres fitted.\n\nthe rule only requires 3 sets to be ""used during the race"". stops on consecutive laps are possible, and that sometimes happens', 'Doing a lap and diving into the pits again is probably allowed. Will mess up track position though.', ""Doing a single lap would be fine by the rules, but I'm unsure what benefit there would be as track position is key at Monaco.  I suppose you could arguably be able to put yourself in clear air if the timing is right and then slot back into the rest of the field later, but there's many things that can happen.\n\nPotentially, taking two early stops and then hoping for an SC could be beneficial."", '>What are other loopholes that may be exploited and are they closed by the regulations?\n\nIf you have your drivers next to each other, the 2nd one can easily lap 5-10 seconds slower, giving free pit stops to the one in front. The 2nd one would lose nothing since overtaking is impossible, and the first one gets free pit stops', ""Does changing under red flag count?\n\nI'd assume so but I haven't looked at it properly."", ""Think that something to consider is that despite the new rule, the teams do not get more tires from Pirelli whilst having to use an extra set.\n\nBut you could pit twice early on in the race if you're in the back, be in clean air to close to gap to the cars in front and gain places when they pit, you might leave yourself without new tires if an opportunity arises with an SC or VSC though, that's what happened with Piastri, although in Monaco that might not be as bad."", ""the start-finish line goes through the pitlane as well, so pitting 2 laps in a row would comply with this rule, yes, but I don't see many reasons why that would give a team any advantage vs doing a proper strategy\n\nno, changing tires twice would not comply as the driver did not complete a lap with a set of tires"", ""> They would never have crossed the start-finish line on track in this case.   \n  \nThere's a timing line in the pitlane for exactly the same reason. So they'll count as used and the team would lose quite a bit of time, as pitting costs ~30s, pitting 2 times just to fulfill the rule means a slower in & out lap 2 times besides the actual time it takes to pit.\n  \n> What if a team changes tyres twice during the same pitstop? After the first tyre change the driver moves 1cm and then they do the next change.  \n  \nI'm assuming it's the same with parc ferme and component allocation, once the car exits the team pit area and joins the fast lane - then the tires are registered as used, not before.""]",293,197,0.89,293,186,186,82,21,0.010000000000000009,82

He visits Monaco, a place where the AMR25 can test his health.\n\nMonaco F1 GP.  Aston Martin confirms improvement and looks to Monaco with optimism.\n\n""Can you be happy and sad at the same time?"" That\'s the question being asked right now by the vast majority of fans who follow Fernando Alonso. Of course, the \' premier category \' lands at the Monaco Grand Prix, a cult venue, and the memory of 2023 is everlasting. It was probably the high point of a tremendous start to the season, where the Asturian almost achieved an impossible pole position against Max Verstappen and could have fought in the race until two pit stops cut short his dream. Little of that hope remains in 2025, although one reality remains: the current Alonso maintains his skill and level, even if the results aren\'t forthcoming.\n\nIt\'s a repetitive thing , but it\'s still remarkable that Alonso continues to set extraordinary times race after race. It\'s in line with what I was saying about his form. ""I feel great, but the results are very bad,"" he said. It\'s a constant race after race, and something that continued even when Aston Martin took a step further in performance at the Imola weekend.\n\nHe\'s 43 going on 44, and the Asturian remains the driver on the grid with the best starts. He averages a 2.86-second reaction time (from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour) in dry starts , and no other driver on the grid is on par with him. Esteban Ocon (2.95), Alex Albon (2.96), George Russell (2.96), and Lando Norris (2.98) are in the same second. But they can\'t match the Oviedo native. He also maintains the pace in race and qualifying , with unusual performances such as the Miami sprint qualifying, the Imola qualifying , and what happened in the race on Italian soil.\n\nThe level is there, it seems clear. The next step is still needed for an Aston Martin that has improved in every way, but it faces a major challenge in the Monaco lap, just over a minute long. Its 19 corners and 3.337 kilometers leave little room for error, nor for overtaking, and it could be a real test for the AMR25.\n\nMonaco is the challenge, and Aston Martin has identified key points for finding performance in the Principality. In the magical 2023 season, the lap was changing due to Antony Nogh√®s\'s traction. Now, they\'re highlighting key points a little further away.

1kr7jkm,[AMuS] Can McLaren be destabilized?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kr7jkm/amus_can_mclaren_be_destabilized/,2025-05-20, News,,"['The lack of pace in the McLaren was certainly a bit strange, but it‚Äôs hard to tell if it‚Äôs due to the circuit or whether something else has had an impact. \n\nI personally don‚Äôt think the Spain TD will have much impact on them, but who knows. \n\nMax and Red Bull are definitely in the fight though, I hope it stays this close all year', 'The headline cracked me up, sounds like RBR is trying to initiate a papaya coup.', 'Red Bull plays with all the tricks.\n\nTranslation:\n\n> **McLaren has built up a respectable points lead in the first seven races. Red Bull is trying to dethrone its direct rival by any means necessary. Will their strategy work?**\n\n> Max Verstappen recently won four consecutive world championships. But it currently looks unlikely that the Dutchman\'s streak will end this year. The McLaren drivers have settled into the top two spots in the drivers\' standings. Even Verstappen\'s victory at Imola couldn\'t change the one-two lead held by Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris for the time being.\n\n> The Grand Prix in Emilia-Romagna also demonstrated that Red Bull is currently doing everything it can to prevent the impending change of power. With a major upgrade package, the engineers got the RB21 back on track. The setup window was enlarged. Verstappen praised the balance for the first time this year. This also helped keep the tires alive over the race distance.\n\n> Red Bull isn\'t just trying to increase the pressure on its rivals on the racetrack. Hardly anyone in the Formula 1 paddock is as adept at playing the political games off the track as team principal Christian Horner. The Briton is attempting to destabilize the Papaya competition at every level. The goal is to distract McLaren from the essentials and, if possible, artificially slow them down.\n\n> **Water affair hits nerve.**\nThe attacks began during the preseason. First, they tried to lobby the FIA \u200b\u200bagainst the flexible wings. This was immediately successful with the rear wing. After Oscar Piastri\'s victory in Baku, McLaren had to reinforce the flap on the tail unit so that ""mini-DRS"" could no longer occur on the straights. The Red Bull camp also put a lot of pressure on the referees regarding the front wing. However, the rules here will only be tightened in Barcelona.\n\n> Red Bull also tried to spread suspicion behind the scenes that McLaren was filling its tires with water to better control the heat in the rubber. This attempt, however, failed. Both Pirelli and the FIA \u200b\u200bdenied the allegations. There was no evidence of such a practice. But Red Bull at least managed to force McLaren to address the allegations.\n\n> The reaction of McLaren CEO Zak Brown demonstrated that Red Bull had struck a nerve. In Miami, he sat at the pit lane with a water bottle on which he had written the word ""tyre water."" Parallel to this mocking action, the racing team boss publicly complained that Red Bull always only makes allegations behind the scenes. He called on his opponent to lodge a protest. This would allow the accusations to be officially dismissed.\n\n> **Red Bull hopes for escalation.**\nSo far, McLaren hasn\'t been significantly unsettled by Red Bull\'s measures. At the end of last year, the storied team celebrated winning the Constructors\' Cup. And this year, as already mentioned, the Papaya Rockets came out of the starting blocks strong. But Red Bull is far from out of steam. The attacks off the track have continued in recent weeks.\n\n> After the Formula 1 race at Imola, Horner tried to evoke an impending clash between the two McLaren drivers: ""McLaren has two drivers fighting for the world championship. At some point, it always comes to a point where self-interest takes precedence over team interest. That\'s the conflict. They did well and didn\'t collide. It\'s commendable that they\'re fighting each other. But you could see how close it is.""\n\n> Red Bull, however, doesn\'t want to just wait until Norris and Piastri get at each other\'s throats. At the same time, engineers from both Red Bull and sister team Toro Rosso are bombarding the FIA \u200b\u200bwith inquiries about possible technical tricks on the MCL39. The focus remains on how McLaren manages to keep the rear tires within a moderate temperature window, which gives the drivers an advantage on the long runs.\n\n> **TD information released to the press?**\nThe FIA \u200b\u200bsent its answers to Red Bull\'s questions to all teams ahead of the Imola weekend. However, it is understood that the crucial clue was not included. The inquiries have so far gone unanswered. It is somewhat suspicious that the day after the Imola race, various journalists from Great Britain and the Netherlands reported simultaneously on two FIA ""technical directives"" that were sent to all teams before Imola.\n\n> Firstly, this was supposedly a clarification regarding the skid blocks on the underbody. Secondly, the aforementioned communication between the FIA \u200b\u200band Red Bull regarding tire cooling was leaked to selected media representatives. It is suspected that Red Bull itself is behind the story. The idea is apparently to create the impression that the rule changes had an impact on McLaren\'s performance.\n\n> Immediately after the Imola race, Horner had already teased that the team had been surprised by the weak pace of their opponents. However, the Englishman declined to speculate on the reasons. According to McLaren, the track layout, with its many fast corners, was primarily responsible for the fact that they weren\'t able to perform as dominantly as they did recently in Miami.\n\n> **Next dispute in Barcelona?**\nThe next round of the political battle is expected to take place in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhen the new front wing regulations come into force. Opinions on the issue have been divided even in advance. While Horner calls this a significant change, McLaren doesn\'t expect the balance of power to change.\n\n> Things will get especially exciting if the Papaya racers actually lose some of their pace advantage for a long time. Then the McLaren management will have to ask themselves further critical questions about whether the car was actually artificially slowed down. This could cause disruption to the previously smoothly running system. And that\'s exactly what Red Bull wants to achieve.', 'I believe McLaren will be the quickest car all year tbh', 'I think of Singapore vs Japan in 2023 about all the talks surrounding RBR. I would wait until after this triple header to have a conclusion on McLaren.', 'Yeah, they‚Äôre already starting to go down the Ferrari road of awful strategy decisions during races and slow stops', ""Verstappen has been absolutely exceptional since 2020. I can't think of another driver who literally makes all of 2, 3 mistakes tops per \\*season\\*. Just staggering consistency.  \n  \nPiastri should win this year (barring an exceptional Red Bull upgrade or the Flexi wing rules from Spain onwards seriously damaging McLarens car)"", 'Not sure what Red Bull wants to achieve with pushing the TD as the reason why McLaren lost pace in Imola. \n\nThe degradation in Imola wasn‚Äôt thermal. The tyres never had a risk of overheating so McLaren‚Äôs ‚Äòtrick‚Äô was not useful. Max said the deg was not thermal. Norris suggested the temperatures of the tyres affected them. That points to non-thermal deg. \n\nAdded to that, Imola is a front limited track and the design flaw of the McLaren has always been that it is a much stronger car on rear limited tracks. \n\nThose things combined together with Red Bull‚Äôs superior tyre management *when the deg is not thermal* and their characteristics on high speed front limited tracks, made it look like McLaren had been affected by a TD. \n\nTo all the world it would be a simple explanation and one that Red Bull were keen to push. \n\nThe issue is what happens *if* McLaren are *not* affected in Barcelona. I‚Äôm sure this will be brought up again with Red Bull and I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll have an explanation. \n\nIf they are affected then Red Bull can point to this TD and the front wing. But they probably hope it‚Äôll affect them.', ""my theory is that the McLaren has more to come from upgrades, they started the last 2 seasons behind, so likely started the design work of this year's car a little behind too, and spent a large amount of effort on the mechanical platform to give it the race day advantage it has and it's stable platform, probably focusing more on having that ready for the start of the year alongside some aero revisions, since aero can be upgraded in season easier than suspension. plus the front wing they started with this year is unchanged from last year, identical. I reckon the aero was improved but there may be more to come especially at Spain, a few months into the calendar so enough time for a big aero update and when the Flexi wing clampdown comes into force, so they can focus a package to improve the cars down force and cater it to a less flexible front wing. I think there is more to come from the McLaren but that's just my theory.\n\nedit- plus most other teams have bought some form of bigger upgrade this season, mclaren has only bought some circuit specific changes, a small floor test in saudi to confirm changes for bigger updates, and their suspension update this race which is more just reducing blockage and drag than a massive overhaul. so mclaren is yet to bring something big like redbull's changes this and last round""]",17,53,0.61,17,388,388,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
