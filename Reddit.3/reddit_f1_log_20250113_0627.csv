1hzx8er,I‚Äôm a brand new F1 fan for 2025. I don‚Äôt know where to start.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hzx8er/im_a_brand_new_f1_fan_for_2025_i_dont_know_where/,2025-01-12, Discussion,"I‚Äôve been a fan of cars and car racing ever since I played Gran Turismo on my PS1, but I never really gave watching the sport a shot. I know the basic rules for the season, but there are some concepts, I guess, that I don‚Äôt really understand.

- How do you, as a fan, determine if a team‚Äôs strategy is good/bad? I keep seeing videos pop up titled things like ‚ÄúFerrari keeps messing up‚Äù. Besides the obvious like forgetting a tyre for a pit stop, how do you discern if a team messed up or not during the race itself?

- Is it possible that one car is so much faster than the others? I remember seeing a race from 2024 where Max Verstappen won by like 20 seconds, which sounds insane. Is the Red Bull car really just that much better than the other cars? Or is this all down to the driver/strategy?

- What should I watch for, as a new fan, to maximize my enjoyment out of a race? Are there any specific storylines/rivalries I should look for in 2025? I know Lewis Hamilton moved to Ferrari, were there any other big moves that could impact the season?","['In brief!\n\n‚Ä¢ some strategy calls are obviously bad and you‚Äôll hear commentators say so. Many others are a gamble that looks bad when it doesn‚Äôt pay off. Hindsight is strong. Bad strategy is down to things like wrong tyre choice at the wrong time, but a lot of these things are affected by luck. \n‚Ä¢ yes, one car can be that much better if one team gets a design element right that others missed. Good car combined with great driver tends to lead to the kinds of gaps you‚Äôre talking about.  \n‚Ä¢ an interesting thing to watch this season might be that there is a relatively high number of new drivers, which is often interesting, and also some interesting team changes.\n\nI think the Sky commentators, on the international feed, are pretty deliberately beginner-friendly tbh and they are obviously mindful of explaining rules and procedures to new viewers. It‚Äôs easy to start watching and learn as you go along. \n\nHave fun!', 'Have you watched Drive to Survive on Netflix?\n\n1) Good or bad can be relative. I‚Äôd say good strategy is when a team takes a situation that is not ideal and turns it into a win or a podium finish. For example, if a driver qualifies in 10th due to an issue with their car, good strategy is pitting for new tires at the best times during a race based on weather or track conditions in a way that helps them move up to a higher position in the race. Bad strategy is when a team tries to pit based on the assumption that a safety car will come or a driver close to them in the race will perform a certain way but it doesn‚Äôt happen and your team is stuck pitting at a bad opportunity. Look up Max Verstappen‚Äôs performance in S√£o Paulo last year on YouTube to see good strategy and good driving. \n\n2) Some cars are faster than others. Some cars are faster but the drivers cannot handle the speed. Two examples: 1) Max Verstappen is very fast and had a fast car designed around him so he could be extra fast but his teammate (Checo) struggled with driving the car. 2) Lando Norris had the fastest car on the grid last year but couldn‚Äôt be the fastest driver due to pressure put onto him. \n\n3) Next year will be very interesting because there will be 5 rookies (6 if you count Liam Lawson). Lando is expected to put more pressure on Max Verstappen after a year of learning to drive his faster McLaren. Lewis and Charles Leclerc will be fun to watch. Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon will be interesting since they‚Äôre both good drivers in Williams cars (that are considered slower cars).', 'Strategy:\n\nBest way is simply to see if it worked. Strategy in F1 is primarily based around pit stops and tires, at least the strategy we are pivy to as viewers. Putting on the wrong or non optimal tires can completely ruin a drivers race and the tires are specifically made to degrade fast, so if it goes wrong you will start to lose a lot of time. But the best thing to do is just to watch the commentators will break it down for you.\n\nCar performance:\n\nA car can easily be 20 seconds faster than another over the course of race. F1 is an engineering series where a big part of the challenge is creating the best car. But the driver is also quite important as well. In 2023 Verstappen had the most dominant season in the history of the sport, he won races with 40 seconds down to second place, who was his team mate in the same car.\n\n2025:\n\nWell, there\'s always a lot of storylines to watch out for, you need to find out what you care about. If you haven\'t I would recommend watching Drive to Survive on Netflix. It\'s a bit over dramatic, but it is a good way to get to know the drivers and the ""storylines"" since 2018. And it is just entertaining. \n\nFor 2025 specifically there\'s 6 rookies coming in, the biggest number in a long time. So there\'s a lot going on there. In terms of rivalry, McLaren is the obvious one. Good chances there\'ll have the best car next year and their two drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, will stop playing nice and start having a true fight. The relationship was already starting to crack at the end of last year.', ""I know people are trying to help here but, honestly, just watch the races and see if you enjoy it. F1 has a lot of soap opera aspects to it, but if you don't enjoy watching car racing then what's the point? \n\nNow if you enjoy watching the racing, then you can start to learn the nuances of the thing"", 'As a new fan, I‚Äôd be watching the rookie drivers. There will be 6 this season and they will probably be a focus if this turns out to be a boring year', ""Once you have watched a few races and know basics, I'd seriously recommend watching chain bear so you can understand the race in a much detailed manner"", ""I think Rick'sF1Addiction (Yt channel) would be a great start. The guy's videos are informative and hilarious."", ""don't. we don't need more yanks around here to be honest"", 'Part of #2 is also the regulations changes they do. If OP reads this too, the regulations are set by the FIA and basically give a framework for how the car should be designed. Teams all interpret the rules differently which can lead to some teams being far ahead of the others. Red Bull has dominated the newest Regulations, but McLaren are catching up. 2025 is interesting because it is the last year before the new regulations come out and the 2026 car will be essentially brand new. This means teams who are confident will work on 2025 and 2026 cars, while some teams will go all in on trying to start 2026 strong.']",9,9,0.77,9,9,9,3,3,0.020000000000000018,3

1i03rdu,Landing a career in F1 industry ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i03rdu/landing_a_career_in_f1_industry/,2025-01-13, Discussion,"As stated on the subject line ‚Äì how can one make their resume and application stand out?

I‚Äôm wanting a career change, and obviously that‚Äôs getting into Formula 1. I‚Äôm looking into roles such as administration, assistant or coordinator because I don‚Äôt have any qualifications or previous work experience within the Motorsport or sport industry in general, so I thought I‚Äôd work my way up. 

Considering that it is very competitive, does anyone have piece of advice or resources that I could refer to, so I can improve my resume. 

Also, what are the chances for the Teams to do a Sponsorship Work Visa?","[""What country is your citizenship(s)? What's your level of education and field? What's your work experience? There are lots of jobs in motorsport. Generally, they are a lot of work and pay below similar jobs in other industries, because that's what you expect when entering a passion field. There are people who want the jobs anyway."", ""So firstly I don't want this to sound negative or anything, but framing that you need to be realistic about this.\n\nYou don't have racing experience, looking at a role that can be perceived as not requiring a unique skills and also require visa sponsorship to the UK, so you need to ask objectively what proven skills do you bring to the table, that others who have relevant industry experience don't have. This also applies to people that are based in the UK.\n\nLooking at how to turn this into a positive, Assuming (based on your post history) it seems that you may be NZ based? I would try to get a role in anything NZ motorsports as a start. \n\nThe other option would be to take a gamble, move to the UK on your own accord and try to find a back office role at one of the teams, suppliers or related companies.\n\nEdit: what is your current career and is this something that you could leverage?"", 'I have a feeling this is only a little more realistic than ""I\'m 16 and never karted, simraced, or driven a car of any sort,but want to become an F1 driver"", unfortunately.', ""So you want to work in a team? FIA? Trackside? Even if you manage to get into a team there's no assurance you're going to work immediately with the f1 team (as there's also WEC, f2 , f3, etc.). Unless you're a billionaire like Stroll Sr. you need to gain that motorsport knowledge and passion to climb up the corporate ladder so starting a career in a motorsport related organization nearest you that's funded by a big car company is a big help instead of taking a gamble going to the UK with barely any experience in motorsport isn't going to get you past the interview phase.\n\nThere are rare exceptions like if you're skilled enough in software there was this one guy featured in the local news here in the Philippines that he was chosen by his University to conduct his post graduate study concerning simulation in McLaren 2024 despite not even being a motorsport fan in the first place."", ""If you are Kiwi like another commenter said, you could try to get a job at Rodin. There's some slim chance they could even become an F1 team one day, and they definitely have great racing happening already. Also, Formula Regional Oceania is happening right now, and there's also supercars and other racing that happens in New Zealand. You might enjoy that just as much as you would F1 and it wouldn't disrupt your life as much."", ""Not even remotely close. There are lots of jobs in motorsports, and most of them have crummy pay and tons of hours, and yeah, there are a lot of people who want those jobs, but it's not like it takes millions and millions of dollars to finance the career path, and there are a lot more than 20 job openings.""]",0,6,0.27,0,6,6,0,3,-0.02999999999999997,0
