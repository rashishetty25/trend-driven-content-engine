And Hamilton does not feel heard**\n\nby Daniele Sparisci and Giorgio Terruzzi\n\n***The bad start to the season is leaving its mark on Ferrari: even Vasseur is at risk. And for the first time Leclerc is in doubt despite a long contract***\n\nTwo podiums in a row, and in Canada the chase for the third on the track named after Gilles Villeneuve begins. The revival yes, but the results are far from the initial objectives: a disappointment that is having profound effects. Several fronts have been opened at Ferrari, Fred Vasseur's actions put under scrutiny by top management, Hamilton's outbursts, and above all the doubts, really present for the first time in Leclerc's head.\n\nThe French boss has been asked to account for the unsatisfactory performance, his position is no longer so firm, he is accused of knowing little about the internal environment, and it is curious that this weekend the trajectory of his Ferrari crosses at a distance that of the other Rossa, driven by the man who could replace him: Antonello Coletta, head of endurance, engaged in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in a World Championship that began with three wins out of three. In the past, the Roman manager had been consulted to lead F1, but had politely declined, and he reiterated this again recently, aware of the enormous difference between the two racing worlds. Now that he has won everything it would be harder to back out. His name (together with that of Horner, an old favourite of Elkann, who was visiting Juve yesterday) is at the top of the list if Vasseur were to part company.\n\nBehind the team principal's case is the disquiet of the drivers, Leclerc meanwhile. From his inner circle someone has let slip questions about the contract that binds him to Maranello until 2029, when he will be 31. A definitive marriage, characterised by continuous declarations of love. But his confidence no longer seems total, he is experiencing cyclical crises and it will not have escaped his notice that Piastri in one year, since McLaren returned to the top, has won almost as much as him in 7 seasons in red.\n\nNothing is set in stone, but the simple fact that he can look around without ruling out a move to another team (there are exit clauses in the agreement) seems related to the opportunities offered by 2026. His fear is to find himself in a struggling Rossa even in the new rule cycle. Mercedes, on the other hand, is credited with a technical advantage thanks to its engine. It has not yet renewed Russell's contract, it has pursued Verstappen but it is likely that Max will stay with Red Bull next year to choose who to settle with in 2027, unless he really decides to take a break, which only he could afford. Charles has also always been held in high esteem by Toto Wolff. Then there is Aston Martin in the midst of a revival with Adrian Newey but it would be a high-risk bet.\n\nFinally Hamilton: his entry has not produced the hoped-for effects, but it has increased the value of Leclerc, who is now not only very fast, but also a beacon on the track after silently putting up with talk of how much he could have learned from Lewis. Who in turn is in crisis. On the one hand he honestly admits his difficulties, on the other he suffers from a complicated relationship. As the GPs go by, there is a feeling that he is not being listened to or followed enough by the team. Which raises a whole series of questions since his signing was supported by reasons that go beyond competitive performance, just think of the enormous return in image that the whole of F1 initially benefited from. Distant memories, it was the Winter World Cup.\n\n12 June 2025"", ""Leclerc's finally getting over his Stockholm Syndrome, love to see it."", 'I know Hamilton is probably retiring with Ferrari.

There a number of changes in the technical regulations, many of which are beyond my understanding with aero.      
Did notice however that in regards to the power unit that there will be some differences in harvesting between race sessions and quali sessions.

There is a limit on energy harvesting of 8.5Mj per lap. At some events this may be reduced to 8Mj where the FIA determines that you can't really harvest more than 8Mj per lap.         
**This limit may be further reduced to no less than 5MJ for Sprint Qualifying and Qualifying sessions at Competitions where the FIA determines that the harvesting strategies required to achieve the above limit are excessive, subject to the conditions specified in Article B7.2.**

Also:         

There is a total power reduction limit of 450kW maximum and the resulting electrical DC power of the ERS-K must remain above -100kW(i.e. 350kW deployment to 100kW harvest = 450kW power reduction)      
**These limits are changed respectively to 600kW and -250kW for the Sprint Qualifying and Qualifying sessions.**","['This is indirectly saying that qualifying will always be faster than racing.

GIVE HIM MORE TIME!!!\n\nStarting to slowly think that Vigna and Elkann are being paid to make sure their F1 team never wins..."", ""**F1 | Ferrari: the silence before the storm. Is Vasseur also under scrutiny?**\n\n***The Scuderia's results are not in line with expectations: McLaren is far behind and the promised developments are slow in coming. In Maranello they are looking for engineers of weight to shake up the Racing Department, but the silence of the top management suggests that even the renewal of Vasseur, who expires at the end of the year, may be in doubt.***\n\nFranco Nugnes\n\n12 Jun 2025, 12:25am\n\nFerrari is on the market: it is looking for engineers, and more, who can give consistency to the team, even if the trend that emerges is that the engineers contacted do not want to come to Maranello. A bad sign that makes it terribly difficult to strengthen a structure that, unfortunately, is showing too many cracks.\n\nThe concern is not so much about the overhaul of the SF-25 (the updates have been decided and will be seen before the summer break: a new underbody and the infamous rear suspension are expected), as it is about the birth of the 678, the red car that should bring the Cavallino into the new regulatory era of agile single-seaters.\n\nEvery bolt will be completely new: chassis, power unit, tyres, aerodynamics will have little that can be reproduced with today, because F1 will change face by pursuing a technological challenge that raises the bar considerably, opting for a 50% electric and 50% endothermic power unit. A pioneering choice that will put some of the Constructors in difficulty: paddock rumours once again give Mercedes ahead of the rest of the competition and, if that were the case, Ferrari would already be chasing the Star as it did in 2014 at the birth of the hybrid era.\n\nJohn Elkann and Benedetto Vigna had believed in Fred Vasseur's project: to return to winning the world championship in the last year of the ground effect single-seaters, before starting the new regulatory cycle. The 2025 season is proving to be a disaster: the SF-25 was born badly, but above all it cannot keep up with the pace of the competition's updates. This red car, completely redesigned from the SF-24, was supposed to offer the aerodynamicists development options that did not materialise. The objectives sought, therefore, have failed miserably. McLaren has a clear advantage: we are talking about almost four tenths per lap, an enormity that will not be made up between now and the end of the year.\n\nThe question to ask, therefore, is another: is this team sufficient to meet the 2026 challenges? Loic Serra is an excellent engineer: he arrived from Mercedes (where he was missed) to take on the role of technical director. A position he had never held and which Vasseur entrusted to him. It is one thing to follow a project and another to manage a technical department. The Frenchman does not have the necessary charisma to drag the team along. After Imola, the top management had asked for an acceleration in the arrival of the novelties: the coup de reniere did not take place, hoping in the meantime that the change in the rules on wing flexibility would play in Maranello's favour: with more rigid profiles there were those who hoped to bring the single-seater papayas closer. An illusion cradled for a long time in the GeS that Barcelona has peremptorily cancelled. This, then, looks like a Ferrari with blunt nails.\n\nIs the problem only of a technical nature or are the causes to be sought deeper down? Is it surprising that Vasseur's contract expires at the end of 2025, closing the three-year cycle, and that for such a strategic role for the future, there has not yet been a renewal discussion, giving stability to the team? It may be that the negotiations are being conducted in absolute silence, but the feeling of several observers is that for Fred a moment of ‘great coldness’ on the part of the ownership has begun, a situation similar to that which accompanied the exit of Mattia Binotto. The team principal is stubbornly chasing a potential from the car that has so far not been seen, while Lewis Hamilton, for example, advises to forget about 2025 in order to devote all energy to next year."", '>We sign Vasseur\n\n>We use Vasseur to help sign Hamilton\n\n>We sack Vasseur\n\n>We sack Vasseur?', 'They are second.\xa0\n\nAlso last season was literally their best year since 2008.
