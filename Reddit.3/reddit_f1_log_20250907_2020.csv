* The soonest Piastri can clinch is now Mexico, which could happen if he wins every race, and Norris scores no more than 22 points and Verstappen no more than 85 over the next 4 races.
* If Piastri were to win every GP (and score 0 in sprints), and Norris were to come 2nd in every GP and win every sprint, Piastri would fall one point short of clinching in Vegas.
* If the top 3 in Monza finish in the same order (Verstappen 1st, Norris 2nd, Piastri 3rd) in every remaining race (including sprints), then they would finish the championship in their current order, with Piastri winning on 462 points, Norris on 458, and Verstappen on 454.

* Outscore Ferrari by at least 10 points
* Are not outscored by Mercedes by 11 or more points
* Are not outscored by Red Bull by 32 or more points

I truly don’t understand why someone would offer this to their championship rival.

I saw on some other threads that some people were saying it was the team’s idea and not Lando’s. I went into Lando’s POV which sometimes included extra radio messages which didn’t make it into the main feed but nope, the main feed didn’t miss any context. It was Lando’s idea. Here is the transcript:

Team: Lando we will box this lap after the soft tire <more words I don’t understand>

Lando: do you want to pit the other car first?

Team: yep we’ll do that. We’ll swap it around so stay out

Lando: well only if he doesn’t undercut otherwise I’ll pit first

Team: There will be no undercut

So the team said “box this lap” then based on what Lando said they switched to “stay out”.

What was Lando trying to do? Did he just not want to risk a SC in the lap between the two stops?","['I think it was a way of not getting fucked over by a safety car if it happened after he pitted', 'It was clearly something Lando thought would benefit him, either 1 lap less on used tyres or to save against a safety car.

Going 2nd gave him the extra lap if it came out where he'd benefit.  That's it.  With the undercut not expected (only happened due to the pit issue), it made sense."", 'I don’t buy the story of them being worried about leclerc. Although the McLaren stop for Piastri was incredible, he emerged from the pits still around 4/5 seconds in front. Another lap wouldn’t bring Charles in front. They also offered the stop to Lando initially anyway. If they were so worried about it they would have told Lando they were pitting Piastri first and explain why. \n\nLando didn’t mention covering Charles in his radio message. My only guess is he wanted track position and fresher tyres. Lando will want as many cars between him and Oscar as possible to bring that points gap down. When they are so far in front in the teams championship I’m sure he doesn’t care about making sure they get 3 points over Ferrari if him teammate was to finish 3rd or 4th. \n\nI think McLaren didn’t want their pit crew to feel like they were influencing the championship. Oscar was reeling Lando in a few laps before they stopped to put himself in a position to capitalise on any errors and that’s exactly what happened. \n\nIf this championship somehow goes to the wire and it’s within a 3 point margin I would not want to be McLaren trying to explain this.', 'Either he was worried about a safety car (or hoping for one to challenge for the win) or he was worried about tyre life on the soft and wanted one less lap on them.', 'Because he wanted the advantages of pitting second.

Do the drivers swap when they know the championship depends on it? Racing is unpredictable and we saw that last week. Just let the boys race and do whatever you can to support them and if one driver gets a bit more lucky than the other than great they win the wdc.

1nak7iq,Why did Mercedes reveal the DAS system in 2020 instead of 2021?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nak7iq/why_did_mercedes_reveal_the_das_system_in_2020/,2025-09-07, Discussion,"I still don't understand to this day why Mercedes decided to reveal DAS during the 2020 pre-season test. We know today that the Mercedes W11 of 2020 is the most dominant, even the fastest car of all time. They essentially had both the WDC and WCC wrapped up weeks before the teams even headed to Melbourne for the season opener and based on pre-season tests like 2023, teams are highly aware when one team has a dominant car aka the Red Bull so Mercedes of all teams should've also been aware of the gap their 2020 challenger had over the competition.


Moreover, we know also from previous testimony from ex-Mercedes members like Paddy Lowe that in 2014, they deliberately ran low engine modes to hide their enormous gap they built in the new regulations to slow the FIA down from allowing the regulations to let the other teams catch-up.


This begs the question - why didn't they save DAS for the 2021 season? It's of course easier to say with hindsight after COVID happened and the 7 straight years of Mercedes dominance since 2014 that nobody expected Red Bull to produce a title challenger for 2021. Nevertheless, considering Lewis and Max were literally on equal points going into Abu Dhabi in 2021, DAS could've easily been the difference between Lewis winning the WDC and not had it not been banned for the 2021 season which Mercedes facilitated by revealing it in 2020.","[""Sry i stole the Crystal ball from Mercedes in late 2019\n\nThey simply couldn't have known they would be so dominant in 2020 and not 2021 without it."", 'Wasn’t 2020 supposed to be the last year of the regulations?
