1lje4ws,Ferrari: The first update to react to problems,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lje4ws/ferrari_the_first_update_to_react_to_problems/,2025-06-24, News,,"['Remove slow add fast', ""Translation \n\nFerrari is in a climate of media attention both on a technical and sporting level. The environment in Maranello is underpressure on the upper floors, with the post Canada that has put in the eye of the media attention Fred Vasseur of which it is not yet his near future within the walls of Via Abetone Inferiore. The Austrian Grand Prix next Sunday marks the return to Europe that leads to the summer break in a series of crucial events to be able to give a second part of the season growing after a dramatic first half, sportingly and technically.\n\n\nFirst block of updates in Styria: at the Red Bull Ring the new floor designed after the inconsistencies revealed in Australia. That‚Äôs why calling it ‚Äúminor upgrade‚Äù is an error, a fundamental macrocomponent with all the limits of the mechanics from which it is difficult to extract further load at the end of the regulatory cycle.\n\nSince the pre-season tests, the SF-25 has shown its limits, that is, those of a single-seater unable to operate in an operating window in which it can take advantage of the aerodynamic load. An unexpected, serious handicap, of which has now been talked about and re-discussed since the first race in Australia. Precisely the difficulties that emerged in Melbourne forced the engineers led by Diego Tondi and Loic Serra to review the initial development plans from virtually zero. The upcoming update at the Red Bull Ring is thus the first, true, attempt to complete the deep correction of the SF-25 project after months of work within the walls of Maranello, between technical meetings and choices on the budget to be allocated.\n\nIn Austria, however, a floor will debut, however, not definable as a simple ‚Äúrefinement‚Äù. Sudden miracles are difficult to expect them but in Austria, a short track, where a very compact group is expected, even a minimum gain will be fundamental especially on Saturdays. The new floor was deliberated some time ago after its natural tunnel development. Bringing the ‚Äúhealing parts‚Äù to the track was in fact possible before June: in Canada, for logistical and tuning issues, it was not concretely possible to bring new parts, so much so that, the new component was initially designed for Silverstone, a track that will be a bit ‚Äòfor all the grid of important news. His early arrival of a race represents ‚Äúan effort‚Äù of the technical department to speed up the recovery process.\n\n\nThe reason why the upgrade comes so late is tied to the time it took to understand and correct the conceptual errors highlighted in the first races. Serra and Tondi had to work behind the scenes to set up a new technical direction, more ‚Äúconservative‚Äù but functional to the initial ambitions. The delay in bringing developments was also an obligatory choice: children of past mistakes, these cars require you to stop, understand, and intervene with criteria.\n\n\nHamilton gave his support to Vasseur but wanted to abandon 2025 to give everything to 2026. A drastic change of course is not in the Ferrari style with the head of the GeS who reiterates an unexpressed potential. The numbers wouldn't blame him. Realistically, who will be right?\n\nIn this complicated context, Lewis Hamilton also has had doubts about the solidity of the SF-25 project, so much so that he considered himself to distance himself from a project with which difficulties have emerged for adaptation, as well as for technical limits. The seven-time world champion, who arrived in Maranello with high expectations, was faced with an unpredictable and difficult to interpret car. However, it was precisely the belief ‚Äî Vasseur reiterated several times ‚Äî that the potential of the machine was real, even if unexpressed.\n\n\nThe main limits have been identified in the rear suspension, unable to offer consistency to downforce and stability, limiting Lewis‚Äô style above all. Only in rare conditions, the SF-25 managed to express itself at its best. Despite everything, Ferrari, by his own philosophy, rejects the idea of throwing the entire season at the nettles: after the Monaco GP, the realistic goal has become the second place in the constructors‚Äô championship and some victories to be won with determination, to close 2025 with dignity. Hamilton gave his support to Fred but it is clear that the Englishman aims at 2026 to return to express himself at the levels he expected with a car that also follows his needs.\nIn Fiorano the SF-25 adapted to the 2026 tyres was with the front wing that will be at Monza in September.\n\nIt is not emblematic that the SF-25 has not been in the wind tunnel since mid-June: its space has been officially sold to the 678 project, the 2026 car that will have to be born under the new technical regulations. This signal highlights that in Ferrari, as mentioned, there has been no change of programming on the timing compared to that established in January, with the knowledge that the current season will still be long, even if compromised in substance. 2025, except for sensational surprises, will be remembered as a year of transition (yet another) and, perhaps, of reconstruction.\n\nMeanwhile, Ferrari also returned to the track in Fiorano for a Pirelli test session dedicated to the wet tyres of 2026. The SF-25 has turned in mule car configuration, but with the interesting unloading configuration to simulate the lower load of the next cars: Zhou and Leclerc have turned the front wing version, characterized by extremely exhausted profiles, designed for the low load that, from the confirmed collections, will be present Monza. The exhaust profiles were combined with the updated structure and the updated drifts after Spain."", ""This translation doesn't sound great but I hope this upgrade package works. Seems like this is the make it or break it point for the year. I don't think we're winning a championship at this point but it would be nice to see Lewis and Charles fighting for wins occasionally. All teams should be focusing on next year's car soon so this seems like the last shot at getting back in the mix."", ""So new floor in Austria... what about suspension? Wasn't that rumoured for Silverstone or is that no longer the case."", 'Ahhh Yes perfect time to also test out a rookie driver. \n\nRookie will be in Charles‚Äô car - money is on they bolt the floor to his and a minor accident either ruins or offers them no real feedback until fp2 which will probably red flag earlier on and Charles will get no long runs in. \n\nThis is the Ferrari way - I‚Äôm tired.', 'Next race‚Ñ¢', 'I fear Ferrari is going to be reason Lewis‚Äô Silverstone podium streak ends, unfortunately.', 'This weekend: \nCharles-my suspension feels bad\nFerrari engineer-must be the suspension', 'The updates before were developed in order to create problems']",279,34,0.95,279,594,594,0,0,0.0,0

1lk5qy4,Burning red Summer,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk5qy4/burning_red_summer/,2025-06-25, News,Is Fred cooked for good after this scathing editorial from the main racing magazine in Italy? (translation in the comments),"[""Ferrari has been through a half dozen team principals with the same results. The TP isn't the issue."", 'Ferrari should keep Vasseur\n\nI think he arrived to a team in ruin in 2023. Operationally they were appalling, slow pit stops, awful Strategy and poor reliability.\n\nIn 2023 the team slowly improved throughout the year\xa0and were second fastest by the end of it, they carried this through to 2024 and also fixed the main problem they had had in 2023, bad tyre wear. Suddenly in 2024 they had the best tyre wear on the gird bar maybe Haas. The first example of many of Vasseur identifying a poor area and improving it.\xa0\n\nAnd in 2024 Vasseur led them to what is in my opinion Ferrari‚Äôs best season since 2008! They looked like a different team and were the best on the grid operataionally.\xa0\n\nAnd now this season, while the car is not good enough to win, it is slowly improving, in the triple header they were the second fastest team for me and in Canada Leclerc said they had front row potential.\xa0\n\nBut also you can only blame the team principal so much for a disappointing car. He does not build the car, he hires the people who do, and Vasseur had made many high profile signings of successful designers up and down the grid.\xa0\n\nThe things the team principal is more responsible for, is how the team performs operationally. And Vasseur inherited a team that was woeful operationally and had not capitalised on a great car in 2022.\xa0\n\nAnd Vasseur has made this team amazing operationally, bar the outright pace, everything else about Ferrari is very good.\xa0\n\nIn the strategy department they were probably the best team in 2024, Japan, Netherlands, Monza, USA were all races where the strategy directly won places and Monza was the best example. At Ferrari‚Äôs home race everyone had rules out a Ferrari win after qulaifying, heck everyone had ruled them out by lap 30. But they rolled the dice, the Ferrari gambit. No one thought the one stop was on but Ferrari and Vasseur knew that it was the only way they could win. So they went for it and won at Monza!\xa0\n\nThe pit stops are another perfect example of Vasseur identifying a place where Ferrari were lacking, and improving it. It was ridiculous how often Ferrari from 2019-2022 would randomly have a long pit stop. But this year they have not only improved, but have been comfortably THE BEST team on the pit stop front, with the crew doing an incredible job under Vasseur‚Äôs leadership.\xa0\n\nAnd the bad reliability that plagued them and their customer teams throughout 2022 is all but eradicated. I don‚Äôt recall a Ferrari dropping out of a race due to reliability since Brazil 2023!\xa0\n\nFerrari have been a little disappointing this season, but they‚Äôre still third in the standings and not far off second.\xa0\nAnd Ferrari are always firing their team principals and things dont change when they do. Compare them to other teams, like imagine Red Bull had fired Horner after Red Bulls poor 2008 or after 2015. But they did not and they stuck with him and reaped the rewards. Like him or not yiu cannot deny that Christian Horner was a great team principal for Red Bull from 2005-2023.\xa0\n\nAnd let‚Äôs not forget that he masterminded the biggest and most dramatic driver transfer in the sports history. Even if Lewis is worse performing than Sainz (which id like to add looked unlikely after Lewis‚Äôs great season in 2023 that preceded Ferrari signimg him) this is an incredible move for Ferrari because Lewis brings so much good publicity to the team and has attracted the joint biggest sponsorship deal in F1 history, the HP deal. Like the blue or not this is gargantuan momey for Ferrari and Vasseur is again the guy that led the team to this deal. And I doubt Hamilton wouldve gone to Ferrari without Vasseur. Let‚Äôs not forget Vasseur worked directly with Hamilton in GP2 and they have always appeared to be friendly with each other.\xa0\n\nAnd Ferrari appears to be a much friendlier place than the cold team that it was before, shrouded in controversy every other year and now it seems very nice with a very fun man at the head and I would no longer compare it to the likes of Red Bull‚Äôs toxic environment but it‚Äôs also not too extreme in the other direction like the likes of McLaren who seem to be trying to win by the power of friendship and good vibes. I think Ferrari is a very healthy medium and a very healthy team.\n\nWhen I look at the team that Vasseur inherited, and then look at the team it is now, I think Vasseur should be proud of what he‚Äôs done and it deserves to be appreciated by both Ferrari themselves, who made the great decision to hire him, and F1 fans.\xa0', 'Getting rid of their team principal right before a new set of regulations would be absolutely stupid, especially as their new technical director has only just started', ""I still don't understand why they remade the whole car this year. They were so close to winning constructors last year"", ""**English translation:** \n\n**Scorching days in Maranello**\xa0‚Äî and not just because of the suffocating summer heat. Ferrari‚Äôs disappointing results in Formula 1 have inevitably put Fred Vasseur in the hot seat. The French team principal‚Äôs contract with the Prancing Horse is set to expire at the end of the year, and discussion around the matter has started to heat up. That‚Äôs always what happens when things don‚Äôt go to plan. There‚Äôs no point hiding behind a finger ‚Äî it‚Äôs just part of life. So we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised or cry scandal if the head of Ferrari‚Äôs F1 operations is now under the microscope, as senior management weighs up whether to continue with a relationship that began in 2023.\n\nEven if purists would argue otherwise, the role of Ferrari team principal has increasingly come to resemble that of a football manager. When the results stop coming, the bench starts to wobble. The timing is hardly ideal, with the countdown to 2026 ‚Äî a year of major F1 regulation changes ‚Äî already underway. But given how things have gone so far, it‚Äôs only natural that those at the top begin to question whether the man chosen to lead Ferrari into the future is still the right one.\n\nAfter ten Grands Prix, the verdict is clear. Ferrari sit third in the Constructors‚Äô Championship and have yet to show they can fight ‚Äî even once ‚Äî for a win. Monte Carlo was the exception, where the Scuderia looked capable of taking the top step of the podium, but overall, the picture has been bleak. The podiums Ferrari have secured have come more from the misfortunes of others than through any display of dominance from a team that continues to show flaws and has struggled to keep pace with its rivals.\n\nSo, should Ferrari stick with Fred Vasseur, or is it time to call it quits? This question is being discussed widely ‚Äî and especially at the top levels of the company. According to\xa0**Autosprint**\xa0sources, the future of Ferrari‚Äôs team principal depends on the results the team manages to achieve between now and the end of the season.\n\nBecause who knows ‚Äî perhaps from now on, Fred Vasseur will lead Ferrari to a thrilling 2025 F1 World Championship. Never say never. Even if, right now, that seems a distant prospect, you can't make calculations without factoring in the innkeeper. But maybe that‚Äôs precisely the problem. Trust appears to have been shaken ‚Äî or at the very least, thrown into doubt ‚Äî by a joyless season that‚Äôs served up too many bitter pills after a pre-season full of promise.\n\nIt‚Äôs now fairly clear that the French manager‚Äôs fate will also depend on how the SF-25 performs in the coming races. If the downward spiral continues, a day of reckoning will inevitably come. In the midst of all this debate, people have drawn (not always fairly) comparisons between Fred Vasseur and Jean Todt. Back in 1996, Todt found himself under fire. Just ten days after the French GP in which Michael Schumacher‚Äôs Ferrari engine blew up during the formation lap, the then team principal faced the criticism head-on:\n\n>\n\nHave you ever heard Fred Vasseur say it was his fault? You can go through every one of his statements ‚Äî there‚Äôs no trace of it. The blame is always on someone else. Yet he‚Äôs paid precisely to take on that responsibility. He has consistently pointed the finger elsewhere, never taking direct ownership. But that‚Äôs not how things work in the professional world. Leadership roles are paid more precisely because they carry that burden. Otherwise, it would be far easier for everyone.\n\nAs the F1 circus heads toward Austria, the debate continues. The hope is that results will allow Vasseur to silence all critics."", ""It sounds like a sixteen-year-old girl's private diary. Instead of talking about her period or school crushes, she tries to guess ‚Äî with no real facts ‚Äî what will happen to one of the top F1 teams.\n\nThe level of Italian journalism is just sad, and I'm saying this as an Italian who reads it."", '2 of the best drivers on the grid, most well liked TP with Vowles and plenty of fan goodwill.', 'Walls closing in on Fraud Vasseur.\xa0', 'Is this AI?

1ljfch0,[AMuS] This is Norris's great World Cup hope,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ljfch0/amus_this_is_norriss_great_world_cup_hope/,2025-06-24, News,,"['How sick would f1 be at the olympics though', 'Has there ever been a year where every single race is a drivers last hopes according to the internet like this one? \n\nDude won in Melbourne and people were like ""well if he doesn\'t win China the seasons over', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Lando Norris is relying on a technical upgrade for his duel against Oscar Piastri, which already showed signs of success in Montreal. We explain what it\'s all about and why it could help Norris in his World Championship battle.**\n\n> It was time to find a distraction. Just one day after the Canadian Grand Prix (June 15), Lando Norris, like many of his Formula 1 colleagues, traveled to New York for the premiere of the blockbuster ""F1."" There, the Englishman quickly regained his smile. On race day, things were different. On lap 66, the McLaren driver launched an attack on his teammate Oscar Piastri. The two drivers battled through several corners before Norris decided to overtake Piastri on the inside straight. There was no room, however, and Norris crashed into the rear of his teammate, slammed into the concrete wall, and was out.\n\n> With his head bowed, the 25-year-old trudged back to the pits. Norris took full responsibility for the crash and immediately apologized to his team and to Piastri. Piastri was fortunate in his misfortune and was able to finish the race unscathed in fourth place. Thanks to the twelve points for fourth place and Norris\'s zero, the gap in the World Championship standings has grown to 22 points. A bitter setback for Norris\'s ambitions.\n\n> Last year\'s runner-up in the world championship had entered the 2025 Formula 1 season as one of the top favorites for the title. His opening victory in Melbourne in mid-March seemed to confirm the experts\' assumptions. However, the Briton subsequently lost his rhythm. Piastri raced from success to success. The reasons for this lay partly in Norris\'s inconsistency and partly in his complaints about the handling of his McLaren. Since the start of the season, the Briton has justified himself by saying that he needed to adapt to the new car. The MCL39, he said, did not suit his natural driving style. The car was difficult to drive and did not give him the desired feedback. Such statements were not heard from Piastri.\n\n> **New front axle = new hope.**\nThe engineers at the storied Woking team listened to their driver. In Canada, they introduced a new front axle for the tenth race of the year. Team principal Andrea Stella explained: ""The new front suspension is designed to give our drivers more feel. We\'ve made minor changes to the geometry ‚Äì nothing dramatic."" Only Norris used the new design. Piastri opted for the older version. ""The changes are so minimal, it\'s difficult for the drivers to determine their effect. That\'s only possible once we\'ve done a back-to-back comparison,"" Stella explained the next steps.\n\n> This is now scheduled for Spielberg (June 29). Norris, in particular, is hoping for a positive effect. However, he will have to hand over his MCL39 to junior driver Alex Dunne in the first practice session. Oscar Piastri will likely also evaluate the new front axle there and then decide whether to use it as well. ""There were no negative surprises with Lando; he felt comfortable with it,"" Stella said happily.\n\n> **Norris pace convincing.**\nHis prot√©g√© showed the first positive signs in the Montreal practice sessions. Norris was fast from the start and handled the race better than his teammate ‚Äì right up until qualifying. In the third segment, the man from Bristol made two mistakes that dropped him to seventh place. But his pace was right: ""Compared to Oscar, Lando was competitive from the start. For us, that means the experiment with the front suspension was a success for him.""\n\n> Piastri remained flawless and secured third place on the grid in qualifying. In the race, Norris was again the faster driver. With good pace, he was able to close the gap to Piastri towards the end of the race. Despite the crash, this should give him a boost for the upcoming races. But what\'s next for McLaren? ""Both could continue to use different suspensions. It\'s up to the drivers to decide which specification they feel more comfortable with,"" said Stella in Canada.\n\n> This may be a small advantage for Norris in the World Championship battle. The new front axle could boost his confidence, which has been dented after the crash and the season\'s mixed fortunes. Furthermore, the knowledge of a supposed technical advantage over Piastri would give him a mental boost. The trick is just translating that into results on the track. That\'s been a problem recently, not just in Canada. The next chance to turn things around in the World Championship battle awaits in Spielberg.', ""World cup you say ?\n\n*It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, F1's coming home*\n\n\\- Lando, probably"", ""It seemed like the first time this year that Norris had a race pace advantage over Piastri, but it also showed that the car isn't the problem but the driver as he was not able to use that to it's full potential in quali nor in the race and left with nothing."", 'so why is a general mclaren update norris‚Äòs great hope but not piastris who is even in the lead. could it be biased?', 'Ive also heard people say their non dominant weekend at canada was because of the flexi wings td so quite contradictory media articles', ""I mean, Lando's only 26? Even if he doesn't win championship this year, it's still not end of the world for him."", 'But but but he crashed with that new axle. The car with the old axle made the corner just fine. :-D']",0,59,0.44,0,333,333,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0
