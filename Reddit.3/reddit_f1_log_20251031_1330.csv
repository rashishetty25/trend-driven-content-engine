I’m 40 now and I was 21 the first time I sat in an F1 car. To come from where I’ve come from, from watching F1 on TV, aspiring to race at the top level, to getting into an F1 car with the people around you, the mechanics and all the machinery… And then to be dropping myself into a red car 20 years later, **it was a lot more emotional**. **When I was 21 it wasn’t an emotional thing, it was ‘exciting’**, because everything was firing inside me. **When you get in the Ferrari, it’s love**.

He’s one of the true icons of our sport. Then he’s on the phone telling me why I should come to the team [Mercedes], and then when we finally met we had a really good conversation. He said, “You’re just like me, you’re a racer to the core.” It wasn’t until we had that meeting that those barriers came down, that the stereotyped view he may have had was dealt with. After that we would travel to races together and he’d fly us places all the time.***\n\n\n**FM: Did you educate him?**\n\n>**LH:** ***I think we educated each other. He had the best stories, and we used to laugh so much together. And he was a fighter, literally until his last breath. It was unbelievable for me to see how hard he fought. We’d send video messages to each other, and right to the end he was fighting, saying “I’m coming back…” I loved him for that.***\n\n\n**FM: What do you say to those who suggest that this extra-curricular stuff is a distraction? (referring to his off track passions like music and fashion)**\n\n>**LH:** *It’s not a question of distraction. Everyone can get distracted, one way or another. It’s about how you decide to deploy your energy and create a sense of balance. **You’ve got to have a creative balance, you can’t just work every hour of your life because you’ll be miserable.

Tapping into your creativity is one way.***\n\n\n**FM: Your Mission 44 Foundation is continuing to promote diversity and improve education and opportunities in schools. Are you happy with the progress that’s being made?**\n\n>**LH:** *The work never stops. (He pauses). I was fortunate to meet Nelson Mandela. He was pushing and fighting for others until his last day. **Lead with intention. Don’t lower yourself to some of the levels that some people like to stoop to. Like Michelle Obama said, “They go low, we go high”.** Every meeting I have with a potential partner, I ask what they’re doing about impact. It will be a challenge as long as I live and there will be other fights along the way, too.*\n\n\n**FM: Do you have a full slate of upcoming projects? (About his film production company, Dawn Apollo)**\n\n>**LH:** *We have some ideas. I’m in the process of figuring it out but storytelling is something I’m really passionate about. **More than ever, we need inspirational stories out there, given the dark times we live in. I love comedy and I’ve got a particular idea for a television show.

I got into F1 this year, courtesy of my friend, who has been a fan for longer. I got in right after Imola, so I didn't get to watch it (not yet anyway), but she caught me up on the basics. Monaco was the first race I'd ever watched, and my friend sincerely apologized (lol) because she said that the race wasn't a great introduction at all. Looking back after a few months of getting to know the sport more, I do agree that she was right. I've been watching every race since then, and I honestly think all the races so far have been entertaining. But yeah, other than a few clips from races from earlier in the year and past years, I haven't watched any full races from before Monaco 2025.

This now brings me to my question: Could you maybe suggest races (starting from 2015 preferably, I've grown to like Max and want to start from there haha) that are actually worth watching in full and/or maybe have significance of some sort? Like staple races that you just *have* to see unfold. I'm still open to races before 2015 though, especially if it's very monumental for F1.  
  
I was initially planning on binging everything, but watching 10 years' worth of races might actually burn me out, and I'd never touch F1 again, haha. So, maybe fan-favorite races from 2015-2024?

I’m going back through the Archives on f1tv and I’ve noticed they have old quali sessions and obviously sometimes they’re better than the actual race. I was just wondering if anyone can point me in the direction of some quali sessions worth watching. Off the top of my head I can think of spa 2021 as a decent one and Russia from same year but if anyone could help me with others that’ll be ideal.

Monaco 2023 too."", 'Styria 2020. Imo that was the last time Hamilton produced the one lap magic and wet race magic he was so famous for in his earlier career. \n\nIt was chucking it down with rain and he was 1.2s clear of the field on the shortest track of the year. It was an insane gap. Yes the Merc was the best car but it wasn’t that much better than anyone else. It was pure Hamilton rainmeister magic.  \n\nThe only other driver that looked in Hamilton’s class that day was Max, who is also a GOAT tier driver, who spun at the second to last corner on his final lap trying to keep up and even then he was 0.7s down on Hamilton when he spun. \n\nHamilton was 35 at that point and although he still had plenty of good performances since it was the last real moment of super prime vintage Hamilton where it was so clear why he was the best driver of his era and had a level of speed very few others in F1 history can match.']",3,5,0.8,3,5,5,3,5,0.8,3
