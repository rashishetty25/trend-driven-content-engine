And even if they could have, they’re never going to get any respect or acknowledgement if they don’t venture out on their own.\nBy and large, these kind of kids ultimately struggle tremendously mentally because they can not be proud of anything they achieved, because they can never be certain whether it was 100% due to their dad. In addition, they end up suffering years of online bullying and lack of respect. \nThe best thing to do would be to get on on your own, achieve something based on your own talents.

And restrictions are being studied...","['It’s Elf fuel and the early ‘90 again.\xa0\n\nIt was said that the Elf fuel used by the Renault engines in the early nineties which lead Williams to two championships gave them something like 60-80 hp, and only 3 employees knew the entire, secret formula.

We are talking about a chemical power that could be worth between 30 and 50 horsepower.\n\nAn enormity if we consider that Renault will leave the Circus because it pays a power deficit on the current unit of about thirty horsepower, that is to say the lowest value of the range. The teams are discovering that the oil companies (Aramco, Petronas, Shell, ExxonMobil, BP) are proceeding with a “rearmament” with dedicated budgets that for some are astronomical and others more limited. The effect is that important differences could be generated, moving what should return to being a championship of power units, a F1 of gasoline.\n\nThe search for chemical additives that can act as effective anti-knock agents, allowing for higher compression ratios in combustion engines, is leading some groups to seek partnerships with small, ultra-specialized centers capable of coming up with novel solutions.\n\nIt should not be surprising that in the budget cap of engines the cost of a liter of e-fuel was calculated at 200 euros. This figure is to be drastically reduced (150 euros?), introducing important bans on additive substances.

A lot of pressure on him but I loved the messages after the race that they will support him through highs and lows. \n\nDid giggle at “what a beautiful sight” [pans to flares].', 'I don’t get it. It’s not like it’s far or anything.\n\nYou’re just proving my point.', 'An estimated 30-40k Argentinians traveled to Sao Paulo. The majority of people traveled from Buenos Aires. That’s over 1500km, a 3 hour flight. All flights were sold out, so they had chartered flights, as well as many people going by bus (a multiple day journey, as it is over 28 hours to drive). And for people originating from elsewhere in Argentina, the journey was likely longer… it was a big deal.', 'And? What’s your point. That sounds like normal travel problems. lol.', 'Well, you said you didn’t get it, and that it was not like it was far. I’d say it is a pretty big deal for a big amount of people to be mobilising like that - and the distance is certainly not short. But if you’re just salty for no reason there’s nothing I can do!', 'It’s just fans going to a race. lol. It’s not that crazy.', ""Put it into perspective. Logan Sargent joined F1 and I doubt he brought 40k new fans from the U.S. into F1. \n\nFranco shows up in the middle of the season driving for a midfield team, and he has brought in over hundreds of thousands of new fans, and is so popular that nearly 40,000 people who didn't know who he was at the begining of the year, went to go see only him and nobody else. \n\nSome of those that went probably don't know who veratappen is, or that red bull has a second team, and they definitely have no idea why the team is called Williams. There are news stories about putting together rule guides for your family. Some  couple got their 15 minutes of fame in the news because he made a quick guide for his girlfriend who wanted to start following F1.\n\nTN news somehow got my dad's number after the race in Austin and interviewed him live for like 40 minutes to talk about what it was like for an Argentine to be at the race.\n\nWilliams made a full line of merch for a driver that doesn't even have a contract. Why? Because they're raking in the cash on merch sales. My family has been a diehard Ferrari family for literally as long as I can remember, but you bet your ass my dad has a Williams hat now, and it's signed by Franco.\n\nIt's all for him and nobody else. This isn't just fans going to the races. This is something formula one has never seen before."", 'It’s the first time in over 20 years that Argentinians have a F1 driver, so it is kind of crazy for them. Did you watch the video? They also organized a big “banderazo” moment in the city… that is very unusual.']",30,9,0.72,30,9,9,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
