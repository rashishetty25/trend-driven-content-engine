For example i definitely think that the Brazil second formation lap not being punished harshly was very dumb. To me, not only did it technically provide a possible sporting advantage but was definitely a safety issue, with cars going around a track in the wet with personnel on it who weren’t expecting drivers.\n\nEspecially considering a driver crashed on the formation lap.\n\nWhen it comes to red flag procedure, drivers should be punished harshly no matter the session. It is a safety issue, not a sporting advantage issue. However when it comes to these things, I think it’s important to note whether the driver did the safest things in the moment. IDK if it was Baku where something happened with Charles not slowing for double waved yellows in Free practice but Charles saw Pierre go down the escape route and was right at the corner. To do anything but brake as normal would’ve been far more dangerous.\n\nI have to wonder, would it be more dangerous for Ollie to brake harshly here to avoid overtaking? I think it’s very important for drivers to react in the moment what’s safest, rather than think about the guidelines. A major difference between the two incidents though is Charles was reacting to the hazard and knew exactly what he was dealing with it. With a red flag, Ollie had no idea if the hazard was right around the corner or the other side of the track.\n\nWhen it comes to safety though, it is hard to believe that it was 10x more dangerous for Ollie to finish the overtake and have slowed to red flag speeds before he completed the corner than it was for Lance at slow speeds to swing out in front of a car on a fast lap, directly leading to a collision.']",120,98,0.93,120,94,94,11,1,0.0,11

1ktu14e,Continuous accuracy of street circuits year after year,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ktu14e/continuous_accuracy_of_street_circuits_year_after/,2025-05-23, Technical,"So, obviously purpose built tracks don’t have this issue but, with Monaco GP being this weekend, it got me thinking;

How do they re-build street circuits year after after with such accuracy that they manage to replicate the exact circuit dimensions each time?

Like, Monaco for example; I can’t help it but to think with how fast they drive and due to the unforgiving nature of the circuit, a smallest discrepancy/inaccuracy of a barrier placed while re-building the track could mean a driver ends up in a wall, no? Like, even if it’s 1-2 cm off from last year(s). 

obviously unless I’m wrong and street tracks are in fact inconsistent with how accurate they get rebuilt each year. (Even in extremely small margins) ","['When I was in Monaco, many of the kerbs were permanent fixtures. There were also mounting points in the ground that were clearly intended for barriers. \n\nThere are changes to street circuits regularly - for example, Monaco is regularly resurfaced, the F1TV team said this morning.', 'The difference in conditions is way *way* bigger than the difference of a few centimetres at most for a barrier. Also, drivers don’t approach a weekend by trying to go to 100% on the first lap. They build up slowly, feeling out the track and the conditions. That’s how a driver who’s never driven a track before can be competitive straight away; knowing the track helps but everyone is learning it all the way through the weekend regardless of how many times they’ve driven it before. It’s subtlety different session to session, even lap to lap', ""Ignoring the racing answers, and going straight to the practical engineering one. \nA surveyor can set the track limits for barriers and kerbs to the mm pretty comfortably. There are surveyors that do this type of thing everyday all over the world for every road project. \nNow this is an especially fancy road project, but really, it's just road works. And with the money involved the engineering model would have been built hard so for accuracy of replication."", ""That's what Free Practice 1-3 are for. Three hours of driving to see how the real track differs from the simulator and from what you remember from last year."", ""Valencia has permanent features like some kerbs (which could act as tracker or positioned too I guess), so does Monaco. I guess it's similar for most city circuits."", ""Yeah, this is how kimi drove today, start conservatively, then gradually build up. Obviously, those who have run the circuit 5/10 + times need fewer trials to bed in.\n\nBut as you say, it comes down to confidence in what the car can do in any given situation. No team has the same car as last year, so every different corner offers a new unknown, even for those who've driven for the same team.\n\nIt's all about learning the limits, and some drivers are better at that (without having an incident) than others. \n\nNo one knows 100% how their car is gonna handle at every corner, so you've gotta push the limits (and hope you're on the right side of the wall). This is a general obvious rule for f1, but here, it's under a microscope of exactitude.""]",15,8,0.72,15,6,6,6,5,0.010000000000000009,6
