1loz83o,Query about car numbering system from 1974-,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1loz83o/query_about_car_numbering_system_from_1974/,2025-07-01, Discussion,"Car numbers from 1974 were based on the 1973 WCC standings. 

So lotus ran with 1 and 2. Tyrrell finished second in 73 so took 3 and 4 for 1974. Tyrrell kept those numbers until the 1990s. 

McLaren finished third and so took numbers 5 and 6 for 1974

And so on. 

Questions: at what point did Williams get car 5/6?

And why did Ferrari get numbers 27 and 28? Going by 1973 standings they’d get 11 and 12 in 1974

","[""The way this worked is that the WDC's team got #1 and #2 and gave its previous numbers to the previous year's WDC team.\n\nFerrari did start out with #11 and #12 in 1974. Scheckter won the WDC in 1979, stayed with the team so Ferrari had #1 and #2 in 1980. Williams (Jones) who had #27 and #28 won the WDC that year, so they were #1 and #2 in 1981 and Ferrari got #27 and #28 from them.\n\nInitially Lotus had #5 and #6 and exchanged those numbers with Brabham in 1979 (Lauda was #1 in 1978, Andretti in 1979). Williams (Jones) had #1 and #2 in 1981 and exchanged numbers with Brabham in 1982 after Piquet had won the WDC. Then #5 and #6 went back and forth between them again in 1983 and 1984."", ""I'm sure someone else will come in with concrete dates, but I believe there was a time when Ferrari paid lower positioned teams so they could run a consistent number, although I forget which years they did this"", ""I believe the 1-2 would always go to the team which had the driver's champion of the previous year and you would swap numbers with the other team if that changed.\n\nFor example:\n\nGoing into 1978 Brabham were #1-2 due Niki Lauda winning the 1977 title with Ferrari and then moving to Brabham.      \nMario Andretti won the 1978 title for Lotus driving number #5.        \nSo in 1979 Lotus took the #1-2 and Brabham inherited the #5-6.      \nIn 1979 Jody Scheckter won for Ferrari using the number #11.       \nSo in 1980 Ferrari took the #1-2 and Lotus inherited the #11-12     \nIn 1980 Alan Jones won for Williams driving number #27.     \nSo in 1981 Williams took the #1-2 and Ferrari inherited the #27-28."", ""The numbers would usually only change depending on what team the reigning WDC drove for, which was usually the same team they won with. The dethroned champion team would take the numbers of the new champions for the following season.\n\nFerrari had 11/12 for 1974, though they gave those to McLaren following Lauda's WDC win in 1975. Of course Hunt won in 1976, so for 1977, Ferrari were 11/12 again and kept those until the end of 1979 as Lauda took 1/2 to Brabham for 1978.\n\nIn 1979, Ferrari won the WDC and WCC with Jody Scheckter and so were 1/2 in 1980.\n\nWilliams, as a relatively new team, were 27/28 in 1980, but won both championships that year, and so swapped with Ferrari for 1981. That's how Ferrari ended up with 27/28.\n\nFerrari kept those numbers until 1990 when the reigning WDC Alain Prost joined them so they got 1/2, with 27/28 being swapped with McLaren (who had 1/2 in 1989). Senna and McLaren took both titles in 1990 and so for 1991, McLaren and Ferrari swapped back, with the red cars being 27/28 again.\n\nWith Prost swapping teams with Berger for 1990, and the two teams swapping numbers too, Berger drove the #28 Ferrari in 1989 and then the #28 McLaren in 1990.\n\nI do find it funny 27/28 are associated with Ferrari when both Williams and McLaren won championships with those numbers but Ferrari didn't.\n\nI'm sorry I've made this a confusing mess.\n\nAs for Williams. They got 5/6 in 1982 when Nelson Piquet won the WDC in Brabham, so Williams took Brabhams numbers. Funnily enough, the two teams swapped between 1/2 and 5/6 for three consecutive seasons in 1982, 1983 and 1984. \n\nWilliams keeping the 5/6 from 1984 right up to the end of 1992. Though Piquet won the WDC for them in 1987, he moved to Lotus for 1988 and took 1/2 there, and so Williams kept the 5/6 for that year.\n\nTheir next WDC was Nigel Mansell in 1992, but he left F1 to race in CART for 1993, but despite there being no reigning WDC on the grid for 1993, Williams were given top-billing anyway but took 0/2 instead of 1/2. \n\nWith Prost winning the 1993 WDC and immediately retiring, Williams kept 0/2 into 1994 as well, before taking Benetton's 5/6 in 1995 following Schumacher's 1994 WDC win."", ""And Damon Hill used #0 at Williams in 1993 and 1994 as the previous year's champion left Formula 1 (Mansell? then Prost) who were both with Williams."", ""They did get 11 & 12 for 1974.  \n  \nThe 27 & 28 happened in 1980 if i recall correctly, as in 1979 Scheckter won the championship, so Ferrari got 1 & 2 for 1980.  \n Williams was '27' and '28'. But Williams won the championship in 1980, so they swapped with Ferrari. (Williams 1 & 2 for 1981 - Ferrari 27 & 28).  \n  \nSame happened with Prost moving to Ferrari in 1990 - meaning Ferrari swapped 27&28 with McLaren to 1&2, and after Senna won with McLaren they swapped it back."", ""From 1974 to 1996 the car numbers were permanent. The team with the reigning WDC would swap their numbers with #1 and #2 from the previous WDC team. The old WDC team would keep those numbers forever as long as they didnt have the reigning WDC on their team for the next season.\n\nFerrari initially got #11-12 in 1974. Then the history was more or less like that:\n\n* 1976 - Ferrari gets 1-2 due to Lauda winning the WDC in '75, they swap #11-12 with McLaren who had the '74 WDC (Fittipaldi)\n* 1977 - Hunt won in '76 with McLaren, they swap their numbers again\n* 1978 - Lauda won in '77, but he moves to Brabham, therefore Ferrari kept the #11-12\n* 1980 - Schekter won in '79, so Ferrari now gets #1-2\n* 1981 - Alan Jones won the WDC in '80 for Williams, who ran #27-28. Ferrari being the team of the previous WDC gets Williams numbers. Ferrari never won a WDC again for a long time so they kept it.\n* 1990 - Ferrari signs reigning WDC Alain Prost, so they get #1-2 swapping numbers with McLaren\n* 1991 - Just like in '77, McLaren wins the WDC straight away, this time with Senna, so Ferrari gets their old numbers back\n* 1996 - Ferrari signs the reigning WDC again, this time Schumacher, they get #1-2\n* 1997 - Numbering system changed, now changes every year based on previous WCC position. Ferrari finished second, so they get #3-4.

It felt that way anyway but then they only won one WDC between 1982 and 1992 and Piquet went to lotus the year after that, so they stick with 5/6. \n\nMeanwhile every year McLaren won the WDC (which they did once or twice between 84 and 91), they took numbers 1/2 the following year and so Williams stuck with 5/6 for quite a while \n\nThat would answer the Williams question I guess', 'Thanks, that’s interesting.

The Vegas romance between her and Sonny was so unnecessary and she somehow failed to make the car into anything other than a shitbox for more than 2 years until Sonny basically gave her a breakthrough idea in like his first month there.', ""I think this is emblematic of the biggest issue in the film: it is simply trying to do too much and so it does not really give itself the opportunity to do any one thing well. Here are all of the subplots that the film is trying to juggle:\n\n* Sonny's habit of racing despite his injuries.\n* Sonny's hostile relationship with the press.\n* Pearce trying to make a name for himself as quickly as possible.\n* Ruben's efforts to manage the relationship between the drivers.\n* Banning's attempt to hijack the team.\n* Kate's struggle to make it in Formula 1.\n* Jodie's lack of confidence potentially letting the team down.\n\nThere are just so many subplots that the film's only solution is to work through them as quickly as possible. Take the team itself -- APX is clearly able to attract world-class talent, since Kasper was a team principal at Ferrari and Kate worked at Lockheed-Martin. The film seems to be aiming for the idea that APX has everything it needs for a breakthrough, but they just cannot get the stars to align. However, it then gets distracted by off-track -- and worse, off-camera -- politics that threaten to undermine the team. Its solution to this problem is to have Sonny say a few words of encouragement to Jodie and then have the team go for a run together and suddenly they all work well. Check that box and then move on to the next subplot that needs to be resolved. Sometimes these things fit together pretty well; Sonny's relationship with and management of the team is in contrast to Pearce's, which fuels the tension between them. But because another subplot comes up, the film has no time to breathe.\n\nA character like Kate had the potential to be interesting. She gave up a career working for Lockheed-Martin to join Formula 1, chasing those few tenths of a second that could make the team great. It costs her everything, but she persists because she loves it, even though she cannot explain why. She is probably the person who can come closest to understanding Sonny's feeling of flying, and she is the person who can take that ephemeral feeling and turn it into a physical thing. There is a natural relationship there, but it should not be a romantic one. The film really wobbles in the pub scene because it presents Sonny's charm as flirting. It should have reframed it as him trying to persuade her into supporting him because he thinks Kate has to work *for* him when in reality he needs to work *with* her.\n\nWe know the film went through some reshoots because they were filming at Silverstone in 2023 and 2024. I suspect that the Banning scenes were a late addition -- the framing of the shots on the grid where the cars are behind the camera make me think that this was filmed separately and then spliced in. A lot of the complaints about the film stem from people not really understanding the Banning subplot, probably because it comes up so late. He goes from a goofy supporter of Ruben to a cutthroat board member in the blink of an eye, and the transformation happens off-camera, so I suspect the character was added in or rewritten at the last minute because the film felt the need for a third-act villain. The unintended consequence was that it compressed everything else that the film did, and characters like Kate and Jodie copped the worst of it."", 'Yeah having Jodie being schooled by Sonny immediately on how to do her job and the pit girl being useless had me rolling my eyes.', 'It didn’t really pass the bechdel test in spirit even though it might have literally.

They cut her role at the end to a few seconds and no lines', 'a lot of people in the comments are missing the point. women want representation done properly, not just for the sake of it. the real danger of the way they portrayed kate is enforcing the idea that women “have to” sleep their way to the top to be taken seriously or to achieve something, that their achievements are not valid on merit alone. you can literally write out their romance and it will still be the same movie. you can give sonny a different love interest and it will still be the same movie. so why make it his engineer of all people, that they even write in a little context that she was encouraged to stay away from him? they initially present kate being this smart woman, but turns out they write her as not smart enough to design a car properly until sonny comes into the picture, that she’s not smart enough to think through the risks of having a one night stand with someone she works for, that she shows little remorse or regret when she gets caught in sonny’s hotel room by their boss. it’s all very male-gaze in an era when women in real life are doing the most to break the old-fashioned, very masculine barriers in motorsport.', 'Could’ve been written by AI. Pretty atrocious dialogue throughout', 'It could have meant so much for women in motorsport… yet they created something thats just a setback for women, objectiving them and dumbing them down to be saved by men. \n\nIts just poor writing and gives the impression that no woman was in the room during the writing process\n\nWhat coulve been… they could’ve done justice to the intelligence, professionalism and capability of the real women working in motorsport.']",0,74,0.42,0,68,68,0,6,-0.010000000000000009,0
