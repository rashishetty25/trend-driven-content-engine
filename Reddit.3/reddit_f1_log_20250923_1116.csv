1nnmk9j,A look at 2025 McLaren's dominance in a world without Max Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nnmk9j/a_look_at_2025_mclarens_dominance_in_a_world/,2025-09-22, Statistics,"I wanted to see how dominant the MCL38 really is. Normally you‚Äôd compare its results to the F2004, RB7, W11, RB19‚Äîbut those teams weren‚Äôt challenged by the grid‚Äôs best driver in a weaker car, and that‚Äôs making the field seem closer to McLaren than it really is. So I asked: how dominant would MCL38 be if Verstappen fucked off to race GT cars this season?

I compared the best-performing McLaren (Oscar or Lando) each GP against the field, then re-ran the numbers with Verstappen removed. The difference is highlighted at the bottom. (Extreme outliers that skewed the averages are removed in the ‚Äòfinal‚Äô numbers.)

**TL;DR**

* **Avg. quali margin:** ‚Äì0.106s ‚Üí ‚Äì0.187s without Max (**77% difference**). McLaren now has 14 poles.
* **Avg. race margin:** ‚Äì7.727s ‚Üí ‚Äì12.453s (**61% difference**). McLaren now has 15 wins.
* **Avg. fast lap margin:** ‚Äì0.241s ‚Üí ‚Äì0.304s (**26% difference**). Same total fastest laps.
* **Points:** 623 ‚Üí 666 (**+7%**) (likely the least meaningful stat of the bunch)

*Take from that what you will. Obviously, this is not an exact science, but interesting data nonetheless. The only thing I know for sure we‚Äôd be bored to tears without Max this year. If people are interested, I‚Äôll compare these numbers to other dominant cars once the season‚Äôs over.*","['I mean yeah the top team would look even better if you take the best other competitor out of the equation, you can do this with any sport. This doesn\'t really show ""how dominant the McLaren *really* is"", it shows the season without Verstappen.\n\nThis also assumes that McLaren was faster than RB in all of the races they lost to him and thats not really true. Monza and Baku faster than MCL and imo equal in Imola.', ""Now imagine if that same McLaren was being driven by Max, which would compound it's already big advantage.\n\n\nWe'd be talking about how it's one of the most dominant cars of all time or perhaps the most dominant ever, just like the RB19. Even if there have been cars, even in the recent past, with a greater pace advantage to the rest of the field."", ""I know it's a very big IIF but.........\n\n\nIf max somehow manages to win the championship from this far back this year he will become THE greatest of all time"", 'Right and Albon would win every race if no one else was on the grid.', ""It's not that dramatic. Apart from Imola, Monza and Baku, the gaps are mostly consistent with reality (race pace)."", ""Do not get me wrong Max is the best driver on the grid by some margin & is probably the GOAT (or will be when all is said and done).\n\nBut the fact they keep sticking unproven drivers from midfield next to him year after year really has been amazing for his legacy and reputation. \n\nThey, more often than not, have 0 podiums and 1 or 2 seasons experience. We can see after this weekend with Piastri, even the prodigies are not the finished article when they have done only a year or 2 of F1.\n\nIt's easy to understand why some drivers push for this if they are able to."", ""It also ignores that RBR wouldn't just roll out another midfield driver in that seat, they'd be going after a top driver who may not be as fast as max but would certainly be competitive in a clearly capable car."", ""With the benefit of 24 races though.\n\nIt would be crazy, but he wouldn't have had a chance to come back decades ago as the season would already have been over by now."", 'The goat debate is the most useless and harmful in any sport, I wish at least F1 fans would stop with that bs.', 'Last capable driver next to him was probably Albon 2019 which was also the last time a Red Bull driver got satisfactory results']",71,13,0.72,71,91,91,-4,0,-0.010000000000000009,-4

This is a F1 Fastest Lap Simulator Project. Built with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, OpenF1 API and Vercel)

* It lets users simulate fastest laps and compare car telemetry data across all Formula 1 sessions since 2023.
* Since the data source is updated for every session, so my project is up to date with today's race as well (Azerbaijan 2025)
* Deployed using Vercel with GitHub CI/CD pipeline
* Users can compare drivers‚Äô speed, gear, DRS, throttle, brake, RPM, and lap times as they do the lap.

1no0vla,I think the 10 second penalty for Albon shows a deeper problem of the current stewarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1no0vla/i_think_the_10_second_penalty_for_albon_shows_a/,2025-09-22, Discussion,"I think this incident highlights the problems of the recent limit on penalties. Only handing out 5 or 10-second penalties for the vast majority of incidents means that incidents like this, which cost Colapinto 25+ seconds, kind of make it worth it (obviously not really, as it also costs Albon and penalty points). Introducing 15-second penalties, and actually using drive-throughs and stop-and-go's. 

The current stewarding process needs fixing in general. I think a selection of professional stewards is needed, but even stuff like this shows they need to go back over a lot of the guidance and really have another look.

They have pretty much sorted the extending track limits, which was a massive talking point a few years ago, by just using the B&W black, which is what it was there for, but wasn't used for ages. It shows that a lot of these stewarding problems do come from the guidance issued to them.","[""Penalties are not meant to repair the damage done, just to disuade drivers from doing certain things. I don't think it was worth it for Albon, even if it was way worse for Colapinto."", 'Bad take. Penalties aren‚Äôt there to vindicate the driver that got crashed into, but to punish the driver that caused the crash.

Penalties are also already handed out based on result often, so smaller penalties suffice.   \n  \nThe current drivers are also keeping it rather clean, so there is no need to penalize missteps as harshly"", 'I agree with you - Fornaroli on Dunne in the F2 race is another example.\n\nOn Russell at Monaco - it‚Äôs not good race direction IMO if the guidance allows drivers to profit from purposefully taking a penalty, which is entirely why the standard one moved up to ten seconds from five in the first place.', 'Penalties should penalise the action and not the outcome. Which has been heavily discussed before with the Ham/Ver incident in Silverstone. \n\nPeople said a race ban would be appropriate, because Verstappen crashed with 50G and Hamilton was able to continue and score points.', ""been saying it for a while. Driving standards have tanked a few years after the 5/10 second penalties. They were introduced to have less severe options for minor shit but they very very quickly became a replacement for almost all penalties. So many insane things done on track and rarely a drive through, stop go or black flag. Max shoulda got the black flag in mexico for sure. IN brazil again max should have gotten a drive through probably for how egregious that shove off was, but instead no penalty at all but that's because over hte years worse and worse behaviour went from a drive through, to a 10 second penalty, to a 5 second penalty to often being ignored.\n\nF2 is a heavy result of this. Kids coming through having never really watched/remembered f1 before the 5 second penalties were introduced. dive bombing being rewarded, cutting corners being rewarded is just the f1 they would have gone from like 5-15 yrs old watching and now those kids are in f3/f2 driving like maniacs."", ""Penalties aren't meant to copy the impact you had on the other driver. They are there to make it unattractive to do naughty stuff. \n\nThings would get very weird when you make a penalty the same as the impact on the other driver.
