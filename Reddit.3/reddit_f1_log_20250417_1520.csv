1k0yqbd,Explanation of Aerodynamics in F1 Cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k0yqbd/explanation_of_aerodynamics_in_f1_cars/,2025-04-16, Discussion,"Hi - I am an aerospace engineer with almost 2 decades of experience in rocket engines, missile systems, and aircraft. I have never worked on formula 1 cars, or any car for that matter. However, I know aerodynamics and the core principles remain the same across applications.

In these first few weeks of the season, I have seen a lot of talk about the Red Bull car in particular. In a lot of these discussions (including articles from journalists...) people seem to falsely equate how hard the car is to drive with it's speed. What I hope people take away from this post is that a car that is hard to drive can still be very fast. In fact, a worse ""window"" can actually make a car faster when inside that window (speaking purely in terms of aerodynamics).

As a side note, this is not about drivers. There is no question that Max is amazing. There is also no debate that the McLaren is fast, but I do think that some people are underestimating how fast the Red Bull actually is just because it is hard to drive.

So into the explanation (trying to make it ELI5):

Let's start with airfoils - airfoils are one of the main ways to create aerodynamic structures. Airfoils are a 2D shape that look like a tear drop - if you look at an aircraft wing, it is an airfoil that is extruded to 3D. 

Camber is the degree to which the airfoil is bent. Typically, if you camber an airfoil more the lift/downforce will increase, but so will the drag. Think about holding your hand out of the window while driving - a flat hand has no camber and a cupped hand is more cambered. You can also do a lot with how ""sensitive"" an airfoil is - meaning, there are some airfoils that are ""twitchy"" when it hits a gust of air (colloquially referred to as turbulence). In something like a commercial jet, they design their airfoils to be very stable - this makes them easier to fly safely, less prone to ""turbulence"", etc. The downside is that these more stable airfoils are very slow for maneuvering by design. So in contrast, they design combat aircraft (e.g. F-15)) with much more unstable, but also much more responsive aero surfaces. Engineers put a lot of time into optimizing these aero surfaces to be both responsive and stable, but it is always a trade off on some level.

The other important concept for people to understand is stall. Ideally you want air to ""stick"" to your airfoil, so you generate maximum lift with minimal drag - however when you angle the airfoil (say turn an F1 car) you increase the amount of flow that starts to separate - which if it gets bad enough is called ""stall"" and the surface loses most of it's lift (or downforce in F1 terms). Similar to the camber, some airfoil designs can be more sensitive to stall, but typically these have the lowest drag in ideal conditions.

In an F1 car you have literally thousands of individual aerodynamics surfaces. Not all of them are airfoils, but  they all follow the same principles. Engineers need to balance drag, downforce, responsiveness, and risk of stall on each surface in a variety of speeds, turns, temperatures, winds, etc.  Not to mention how suspension, stiffness, dirty air, etc. can also impact aerodynamic performance. Unfortunately, if you increase downforce (all else being equal) you also increase drag. If you lower drag to go faster you can cause some surfaces to stall in a corner. If you are quickest in clean air, it's possible you are compromising your speed in dirty air (think the McLaren in Japan).

I think if you read this far, the issues with Red Bull's car are pretty obvious. It has a very narrow window of conditions where it has optimal aerodynamics. They clearly have gotten ""spoiled"" by having a driver like Max who can consistently keep it in the proper window for peak performance - and thus have gradually opted for a faster car rather than a car that is easy to drive. Unfortunately, even if Max drives perfectly there are things outside of his control like temperatures, track layout, wind, etc. I do think that when the Red Bull is in the window, it is probably faster than the McLaren, but that window is a lot smaller than McLaren's so you rarely if ever get to see it. 

Of course McLaren could have discovered some kind of black magic that allows them to be the fastest, most responsive, and easiest to drive all in one package. It is possible, but in my opinion based on the races so far, it is more likely that they just struck a better balance between those various factors that provides better performance across the all of the tracks. And I would wager that, that McLaren is also quite hard to drive even if it is not as bad as the Red Bull.","['r/F1technical would probably enjoy this write-up as well', ""Your point about stability in clean air vs. dirty air is a really good one, and of the things that is overlooked the most in my opinion. Everyone knows that dirty air is a thing, but it's often underestimated how important it is and how the magnitude of the impact varies with the car design.\n\nIt's one of the things that irked me about all the Lando vs. Oscar comparisons last year. Was Lando really so much faster in Zandvoort and Singapore, or was it just the benefit of clean air? Was Oscar really faster in Spa and Hungary? The McLaren seems particularly sensitive in this regard. I remember in one of the last races in the year (I forget which one), Lando had great pace, until he reached the backmarkers and commented on how much harder it was in dirty air.\n\nIt makes it very difficult to get an honest gauge comparative pace sometimes. It's all part of the fun, but the engineer in me desperately wants every driver to drive every car at every track in every condition, purely so I can scratch the itch of having a proper dataset."", 'I was thinking about a lot of this myself, but it’s nice to hear a more professional perspective on the matter. And indeed there is overlap between a hard to drive car, and a fast car. One does not exclude the other.\n\nOn your end conclusion though… I mean, we’ll see how it turns out, but I do not believe Red Bull are in this without significant (and correct, can’t be understated) upgrades, either for the actual speed of the car, or the capability of setting it up correctly. In that regard they are behind and/or too dependent on outside conditions, which is also part of the game. Can’t build a car that only works when it’s rainbows amd sunshine.\n\nGreat technical insight though, loved the read!', 'so basically people misconstrued speed and cornering', 'https://preview.redd.it/hcn1ga9efave1.jpeg?width=552&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2900abaa3638975d4b1f6459bcc991326dccee28', "">Of course McLaren could have discovered some kind of black magic that allows them to be the fastest, most responsive, and easiest to drive all in one package.

And I would wager that, that McLaren is also quite hard to drive even if it is not as bad as the Red Bull.\n\nThere's more to car handling than aerodynamics.  It's already known what is making the McLaren so fast -- they're running a more radical anti-dive angle on the front suspension than other teams are, which makes them more stable under braking, which has a wide variety of benefits.  Other teams are afraid to copy this because apparently the anti-dive angle that McLaren is running is more structurally fragile -- it's apparently seen by the other teams on the grid as a bold and risky move, which is not what you usually do in the last year of a regulation cycle."", '![gif](giphy|JohcFDGT1HwBdcb0w2|downsized)', 'I’m having a hard time following the discussion of a “stable airfoil”.  While there are angular moments resulting from lift generation this pales in comparison the resulting moments from other primary control surfaces (horizontal tail/canards, etc) in creating stable responses to disturbances. A key difference being that these are purely aerodynamic effects in airplanes but are tied more to physical structure (how the wing is connected to the body, suspension, and eventually the ground) of automobiles.  Any change in this relationship is solely due to aero elasticity.   The F-15 is also a remarkably stable aircraft it just has tons of pitch authority due to absolute units on a horizontal stab.  The wing has camber optimized for an elliptical lift profile at a wide variety of angles of attack while also being remarkably efficient at area ruling for supersonic flight.  Not bad for 1960s slide rule toting engineers!', ""[*...this bit here is what Adrian Newey sees in his mind's eye when he's on the drawing board...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlDnd3B1rhs&ab_channel=wickedender)""]",365,44,0.92,365,274,274,7,0,0.0,7

Or is it not that and I'm misunderstanding?     \n* Why did they include Hülkenberg talking about his front wing (58 seconds in)? It doesn't seem to be significant within the context of the video; is it a reference to something else I'm not aware of?     \n* At 3 minutes 3 seconds, Alguersuari's engineer is *clearly* giving him the same kind of team orders that Ferrari got busted for earlier in the season (ffs, they say the literal exact same words).

So here I am, and I hope my takes will spark some debate.\n\nNote : this script was written right before Bahrain's Grand Prix.\n\nHave a good read!\n\nWhat if the 2025 season was bound to become the most boring season of the aero regulations era?\n\nDISCLAIMER : I am not talking about the championship title race! This year's title race could be the most exciting one since 2021.\n\nIt's been 3 races only, however there is a trend that is starting to emerge : the races are boring (if not for some gimmicky situation like in Australia).\n\nIf it was only that, I mean there wouldn't be much reason to be alarmed only after 3 races, but the thing that is worrying me is something else : the reason why the races were boring is exactly the same - there are no overtakes, no close racing, no excentric strategy...\n\nThere are 2 things that made me realise these issues : the recently reposted 2018 Bahrain Highlights and the 2022 Bahrain Highlights.\n\nEverything that made these 2 races so pleasant to watch are the reasons why the races this season feel so tame : can we imagine someone this season do what Vettel did in Bahrain 2018, forced to make the soft do 40 or so turns after Raikkonen's DNF, while being hunted down by Bottas till the last turn? can we even come close to the midtable action that was happening in 2018? can we ever see battles like the one Leclerc and Verstappen gave us in Bahrain 2022, overtaking one another relentlessly turn after turn?\n\n2022 was so promising of what this era regulations would give in terms of wheel to wheel racing. From what I heard, it seems that this aero regulations that was built to create close racing was corrupted slowly over the years, through upgrades that shouldn't have been allowed but that were allowed anyway like the front wing upgrade (from 2023/2024 Mercedes I think?) that was creating vortex, i.e. dirty air.\n\nAnd now here we are : every single driver complained about dirty air in Japan and not being able to chase even slightly close the driver in front of them. I am afraid that we are at a point of no return, where there is just too much dirty air to deal with.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the tyre issue, the ultra domination of the 1 stop strategy AND the seemingly constant resurfacing of all tracks making degradation non existant are making everything worse.\n\nI pray that I am wrong and that this year will be the best of this era regulations in terms of racing. \n\nBut beside all of that : What are your thoughts on the matter? Do you think the dirty air problem will not be that much of an issue this year? Or do you think the problem stems from somewhere else?""]",8,47,0.69,8,45,45,0,6,-0.040000000000000036,0
