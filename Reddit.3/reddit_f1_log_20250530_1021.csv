1ky7p64,This is what 'Platinum' actually means for Max Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ky7p64/this_is_what_platinum_actually_means_for_max/,2025-05-29, Discussion,"I see a lot of misconceptions about what this 'Platinum' thing means that Max Verstappen has since yesterday, so this is what it actually is.

Platinum is a *rating* from the FIA, it's not a *licence*. As a driver you request to be rated by the FIA, you do not ask to be given a specific rating. The FIA decides what rating you get. It's like a tool or a guide for racing organisations like the SRO (GT World Challenge etc.), so they know where to place this driver into a certain category (like Pro, Pro-Am etc.), depending also on the rating of the driver's teammates.

Being rated by the FIA does not ""bring Verstappen closer to competing in WEC and ELMS"", because it's not a licence. Being Platinum is not a requirement at all to race in those championships nor did Verstappen need to do anything extra to be given a rating apart from just asking for one.

Also, not all F1 drivers are Platinum-rated. As a driver you only ask to be rated, if you intent on doing sports car racing. Only 6 current F1 drivers (including Max) actually have a Platinum-rating: Alonso (WEC champion and Le Mans winner), Colapinto (ELMS race winner and Spa 24H competitor), Norris and Stroll (Rolex 24 at Daytona competitors), and Hülkenberg (Le Mans winner). Edit: I didn't wanna forget about Friday drivers Drugovich, Hirakawa and Vesti, who too have a rating.

Alongside the facts listed above, my personal expectation is Verstappen might try and do the KW 6h ADAC Ruhr-Pokal-Rennen, the sixth round of the Nürburgring Langstrecken Serie on August 16. He is definitely not doing WEC or ELMS.

Edit: you don't even technically need to ask to be rated, but it is very common to do. As somebody who's been working in the sports car racing industry for a while now, I've seen cases of drivers set to make their debut without having requested to be rated. The FIA will then scramble to find out who this driver is and what their career history is to rate them asap 😅","['I believe after you turn 50 the FIA takes away your platinum status.

It\'s an interview and Oscar has always been a decent interviewee. What\'s he supposed to say? ""I\'ll crash into Lando if I have to""?', '“I think, going into the year, we knew that it’s impossible to have your own personal goal directly in parallel with the team’s,” Piastri told media, including PlanetF1.com, in Barcelona.\n“And that’s something we’ve both been very frank about, something that the team has been very aware of.\n\n“Because, at the end of last year, we felt that if we went into this year with a car as strong as we finished with, we’d be in this situation. I think we’ve been very good at being open about it, just talking about it.”\nWhile he and Norris are aiming for a maiden title win this season, McLaren’s current level is such that the Australian reckons several more title fights are on the horizon – meaning maintaining harmony between the pair is a top priority.\n“We’re never going to do anything that’s unsportsmanlike or puts the team in a bad light or puts ourselves in a bad light. I think that’s just not who Lando and I are,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we want to go out and beat each other every weekend, but we’re never going to cross that line that’s going to cause damage that can’t be repaired. Because, I’ve said it a few times now, we don’t want just one opportunity at this.\n\n“We’re both at McLaren for a very long time after this year, and we want to fight for the championship every single year. I think we both understand it’s pretty unwise to try and win one championship and bring the house down with it.”\n\nIt’s a unique situation, as Piastri acknowledged. It’s not so long ago since Mercedes encountered fallout between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg as the former childhood friends fell out in similar circumstances, and the Australian praised McLaren for its hands-off handling of things.\n\n“I don’t think every team would handle it as we are, no,” he said.\n\n“At the same time, there are not many teams in our situation with a car and drivers that are strong enough… we’ve got a very good lead in the Constructors’ Championship at the moment and, whilst we’re continuing to build that gap, I think it’s the right thing to do to let us both try and fight for a championship.”\n\nThere will come a point where he believes the team should start imposing team orders as it closes in on the titles – but only if one of the pair develops a big enough lead to warrant some level of support.\n\n“I think, once it’s mathematically impossible, probably,” he said.\n\n“But no, I think we both want to win or try and fight for this championship and score our own points.\n\n“Of course, if there becomes a time, later in the year, where it is genuinely impossible – or very close to it – then, then, yes, maybe that will change, but I don’t see that happening for a very long time.”\n\nHaving had a run of momentum that saw him take wins in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, Piastri was beaten by Norris at Imola and Monaco, and said he suspects this pattern of momentum switching will continue through the year.\n\n“It’s going to ebb and flow a bit through the whole year,” he said.\n\n“But, I mean, I’m confident we’ve analysed what went a little bit wrong in Monaco.\n\n“I mean, it still wasn’t a terrible weekend, but just not as good as some of the weekends have been this year for me. So we’ve looked at what we can do a bit better, and we’ll try and put that in action.”\n\n___________________________________________\n\nPiastri’s comfort with the dynamic at McLaren will be welcomed by Zak Brown, who outlined his position on his driver’s assured equality during an exclusive interview with PlanetF1.com.\n\n“For us, it’s quite an easy thing to work through,” Brown explained.\n\n“Our drivers aren’t asking for favouritism, they’re asking for fairness, and that’s what they get.\n\n“I think they’re very comfortable; may the best man win.\n\n“Hopefully we give them a car in an environment where you’re going into the last race and it’s the two of them competing, and they didn’t take points off each other to the point where it lets Max [Verstappen] or someone else get in there.\n\n“But if so, then whoever wins the Drivers’ Championship has done a better job.”\n\nsacrifice [Yuki] Tsunoda’s qualifying because he’s giving Max a tow or whatever.“I get compromising the second car at Red Bull because it’s not competing for the Drivers’ Championship, so it’s an easy decision to make.\n\n“But when you’ve got two drivers first and second in the championship and are separated by less than one second place finish, how do you possibly even consider standing one down into a supporting role?\n\n“There’s just no way we will.”', ""This seemed pretty clear just by his behavior.\xa0 He seems totally happy trying to win but taking second if Lando can pull it off.\xa0 At least for this year.\xa0 He's a great sport."", 'I hear what Oscar is saying but I find it unlikely that these two aren’t going to have a DNF this year due to a collision.']",1427,226,0.95,1427,439,439,85,13,0.010000000000000009,85

Or you are too slow on the straights compared to your team-mate and he recommends reducing downforce. So the work on the setup could be so intensive without you having to make any adjustments yourself.\n\n3. development work would have to look different. As a driver, the most you can do is express wishes (e.g. I need a more stable front end) and the team implements them. The better the reputation and the position in the world championship, the quicker the team listens to your wishes. And provide feedback on new parts so that developments can also be discarded.\n\n4. the budget cap must be taken into account. The more damage you cause as a driver, the slower the pace of development should be.\n\nand so on...\n\nBut of course you could also give the license to the worst publisher of all time, who has no interest in good games, but only in their own margins.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

In fact, we previously ran this new front wing as a test item in Imola with Lando [Norris] and saw a negligible performance impact, in line with our simulations.\n\nStella laying out that any performance shift this weekend is probably more because it genuinely suits RBR.', 'Red Bull Collision Azerbaijan 2018. \nThis race was the first I ever watched and instantly got me hooked to the sport. But one thing I’ve wondered for a long time is why the double DNF came after the collision between the 2. Wouldn’t some new tires and a front wing made at least Daniel able to continue racing. No videos or photos I’ve seen have ever shown any irrepairable damage. Can anyone explain to me? I feel like drivers have recovered from much worse', 'Which cars are suited best for Barcelona?', ""Thanks to u/Blanchimont, u/No_Cauliflower7877, u/djwillis1121 for answering my long list of questions. I have a few more:\n\n\n\n1. Why did Hamilton go to Ferrari, I understand Ferrari is a great team, correct me if I am wrong, but Ferrari is not looking like a winner or having even a good environment currently.\n\n2. Why did Sainz and Albon go to Williams (and when). I am asking cause the 2019 season was very good for both of them. Did something drastic happen in the 5 years since?\n\n3. Why is Alonso in Aston Martin, he can get podiums and win races, so why don't other teams try to get him.\n\n4. Lando Norris, what's up with him? Like a general question.\n\n5. How big of a difference is between a McLaren and say a Redbull or Mercedes purely on basis of car. Redbull, Ferrari and Mercedes have enough expertise to build a strong car, so how come McLaren has such a strong car that they are currently winning a lot (ofcourse they have good drivers, but other than that).\n\n6. What is DRS, does it mean that you can overtake the driver in front, how do you calculate that?\n\n7. Do teams have tactics to promote one driver over the other? For example in qualifying in Monaco, they can have the number 2 driver go slow preventing drivers Piastri or Hamilton etc from having a good position (took example of Monaco cause overtaking is difficult)."", 'Is practice on today ? And if so does anyone know what time ?', 'First time watching F2, who’s the Sky commentators for the practice?', ""I made a simple web app to compare qualifying performance of drivers with their teammates. You can see how well a driver did (H2H, mean and median gap) against their teammate\n\n* over a season\n* over all qualifying sessions they took part in as teammates \n* against all his teammates at a particular circuit\n\nI compared times from sessions both drivers participated in. I.e. if driver A made it to Q3 and driver B got out in Q1, then their Q1 times were used. This means results such as Norris v Piastri in 2025 Saudi went to Norris because he crashed and couldn't set a Q3 time but was faster in Q2.\n\nThere is also a fourth feature where you can see how far off a driver's best time is from the fastest driver for every quali session in a season. I thought it would be interesting to see how the gap to the fastest changes over a year (like how Verstappen got closer and closer to Mercedes in 2020, or how Alonso got further away in 2023).\n\nData was fetched from the Jolpica (formerly Ergast) API. Only data from the 1994 season onwards is available (so unfortunately no Prost v Senna). There is also a lot of data from the late 90s and early 2000s seasons missing, so you may find it weird that only 32 results for Coulthard v Hakkinen across their career are shown.\n\nI am planning to make a post here about it but wanted some feedback first. I'm not a frontend guy so excuse the basic layout and style, but if you could suggest a change that is simple enough and would improve the look of the site I'll do it.\n\nhttps://www.f1teammatequali.com/"", 'Worst is probably Keke in 1982 as someone else said.\n\nOther cases of someone winning with the second best car or worse, in my opinion.\n\nProst 1986\n\nSenna 1991\n\nMSC 1994, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2003\n\nAlonso 2006\n\nHamilton 2008, 2018\n\nVerstappen 2021, 2024', 'Keke Rosberg in 1982 had the fourth best car after Ferrari, Renault and McLaren.']",2,23,0.6,2,18,18,0,14,-0.030000000000000027,0
