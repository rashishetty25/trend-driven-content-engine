1guz22f,Why is George beating or matching Lewis for 2 seasons out of 3 so overlooked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1guz22f/why_is_george_beating_or_matching_lewis_for_2/,2024-11-19, Discussion,"Seriously, unless we agree that Lewis is basically nowhere near his prime level, then why is Russell not getting any credit for what he’s doing.

Yet people act like he’s merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about “experimental setups” or “Lewis is just unmotivated”, but, I’m sorry, that’s just a cop-out. Then we can just argue endlessly that basically no driver is worse than another driver, since there could always be intangibles like that, “oh, he just doesn’t care about driving in midfield cars”. really? 


I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it’s just that people overlook George because they don’t like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance.

Good to hear that they are also considering to raise the weight limit to accommodate the cooling system into the adjustments. I wonder if they will make it mandatory to wear during specific weather or anybody could wear it at any time *(given Mercedes' overheating issue, it seems like the heat comes on for them even in overall weather conditions that are not necessarily the worst in comparison, so I am trying to figure out how it works, especially for them)*\n\nThe previous idea of an AC unit in the car in of itself does seem rather tacky, but given the introduction of this cooling system, I would argue that I don't think drivers, whom are highly trained athletes, should be close to passing out in high temperatures, especially with what we saw in Qatar 2023 and Singapore 2024.

1gv408r,Should penalties consider consequences?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gv408r/should_penalties_consider_consequences/,2024-11-19, Discussion,"It's often argued that F1 penalties are applied based on the bahavior but not the consequences. But that makes no sense. 

A very minor collision can have catastrophic consequences, or very minor ones. A deliberate lunge at a hairpin can miss another car or skewer it. Moving several times under braking might have no impact but might cause another car to slide off into the barriers. 

Sometimes actions are premeditated e.g. ""I'll knock him off at the first corner to win the championship"" but the punishment is only for the collision, not the loss of a championship.

If you have a driving offence on the road, the actions and the consequences are considered. Drinking and driving crimes and sentences are different if you just wobble in your lane or if you kill 3 people. Murder is different if premeditated or in the heat of the moment or even in self defence.

It's not enough that they punish for the simple action and nothing else, intent and outcome should be considered too.","[""The intent of penalties is to dissuade driving in a way that the sport (thru the rules) has agreed is unwanted/unsafe. Whether or not the action kills someone, causes minor damage, or has literally no impact at all doesn't change the fact that the sport wants to discourage those actions, because they COULD cause injury/damage in other instances. If there are niche stipulations for each rule you'd never have consistency in stewarding (I know I know, we already don't) and you'd make penalties become perceived as more personal than procedural. \n\nI get the intent of your question but I think we're better off with cut-and-dry flat penalties based on the actions, not the consequences. The flip side is something like the penalty on Bearman in Brazil when he tapped the back of Colapinto, Colapinto was fine and had no (evident) damage but Bearman spun and went to the back, then still got a penalty for causing a collision. But no solution will ever be perfect."", ""It will promote more reckless behaviour. Someone might try a lunge with the mentality that if they manage to miss, they will they'll be clear of a penalty, even if the move was dangerous."", 'Because penalties are supposed to be quick. If we start evaluating intent and outcome you need a whole court case every time. \n\nOutcome should not be considered. It’s the right way. Intent is always established as you are only allowed to drive in a controlled manner. Intent to crash can be provided after and result in a race ban. Very hard to prove though.', ""I mean, it's a tough one, even for the FIA. Even if they say they don't, they already give out penalties based on the consequences. There are so many examples. Ideally every incident should be treated in isolation, but drivers don't drive that way. Drivers know the consequences of their actions, whether it's a championship battle or a fight for P16, and maybe there is some merit in considering that."", '>But that makes no sense.\n\nNo. What makes no sense is to wait and see what the consequences are to be able to mete out a proper penalty. If you cause a collision, like Alonso did in Austria, he needs to get a penalty that causing a collision entails, which is 10 seconds, which he got. That it made no difference for either driver is completely irrelevant if causing a collision is not allowed.', "">It's not enough that they punish for the simple action and nothing else, intent and outcome should be considered too.\n\nIt's difficult to speak to intent. You can't really know what's going on in a person's head, least of all in the heat of the moment of a race.\n\nAs for outcome, it frequently figures into the penalties. If you cause an avoidable accident that leads to another driver retiring or losing positions, then you will typically get a more severe penalty than if you cause an avoidable accident where the other driver doesn't lose any positions as a result.\n\nThis sounds like another attempt to re-litigate the Austin and Mexico penalties."", ""Yes.\n\nIf a championship is on the line, the penalty factors in consequences, as they stated before Abu Dhabi 2021.\n\nIf you need to throw the old rules out the window when things get serious, it's a clear indication that the old rules are terrible and not fit for purpose.\n\nThe entire point of penalties is to have consequences, if they don't have meaningful consequences and don't change behaviour and drivers would rather take penalties than not do what they did, then clearly the rules have failed."", 'Penalties should balance actions and consequences.

And he didn't stop there, and had an amazing 2021 season, racking podiums after podiums.

He still has consistent top10 finishes and another podium...

Sainz certainly deserves a top 4 team spot, I even think he deserves the Ferrari seat ahead of 40 year old Lewis. I'd also say Albon was very unlucky - if he hadn't been punted off track by Lewis at Austria in 2020, he'd have won the race and would probably still be at Red Bull as Max's teammate.
