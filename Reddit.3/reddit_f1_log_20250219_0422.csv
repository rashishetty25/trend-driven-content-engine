While he will start the championship with rookie Jack Doohan as a team-mate, he will discover another collaboration, but looks forward very positively to 2023 and 2024.\n\nDespite some tense moments, right up to the controversial collision at the Monaco Grand Prix last May, the French driver considers that Alpine was lucky to have this duo, particularly in the way it salvaged an unexpected sixth place in the constructors' championship last year.\n\n“It's true that we haven't really had the opportunity to say goodbye,” confided Pierre Gasly on Tuesday in London, when Esteban Ocon had left Alpine for Haas prematurely, not taking part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. “I think it was, when you think about it, the kind of story that we'll find hallucinating in twenty or thirty years' time. When we were told it was impossible to make it in F1, we both made it, in the same French team. It's a very beautiful story, with the podium in Brazil that will remain memorable.”\n\n**Fortunately, there were two drivers like us, both talented and motivated.**\n\nPierre Gasly also believes that the 100% French duo, while explosive on paper, proved the most skeptical of the pairing wrong.\n\n“We've proved that we're professionals,” he insists. “Everyone told us it would be a mess with both of us on the team. But it's a good thing there were two drivers like us, talented and motivated, because in-house competition allows us to give it our all. We never gave up, and if we managed to turn around what was a very complicated season last year, it's also partly thanks to the work we did together. We can be happy about that.”\n\nFrom now on, Pierre Gasly will cross paths with his compatriot on the track, but in the colors of Haas, which doesn't necessarily change his state of mind.\n\n“The rivalry has always been there,” he admits. “I've got 19 rivals on the grid, whether it's Esteban, Charles \\[Leclerc\\], Lewis \\[Hamilton\\]... After that, there are animosities between everyone and it's up to us to manage that. I'm a professional, I fight hard on the track but with respect, no matter who I'm up against.”"", 'The final straw for me with DTS was them trying to spin it into being a disaster. \n\nAlpine might be a mess, both those guys did just fine together.', 'I remember joking that it was going to be ""dinamite"". I\'m happy they had Brazil as a goodbye as team mates, they both looked really happy.', ""Let's be real here.  The problem at Alpine isn't Ocon and Gasly.  It's fucking Alpine.   I think they made the best out of a very bad situation.  Yes, they had a couple of dust ups  (all the teams do, now and again, don't they?), but they were \\*not\\* the problem."", 'Gasly’s F1 career could be a blockbuster movie trilogy at some point\n\nPart 1: Having arrived to the sport as a hot up-and-coming talent, he gets a shot at the front of the field next to one of the most talented drivers to ever exist. The pressure mounts, he flounders in comparison to his teammate, and winds up getting demoted back into the midfield. Around the same time, one of his best friends tragically loses his life. Determined as ever, Gasly puts up some of the best midfield performances ever, climaxing at his Monza 2020 win and continuing through 2021.\n\nPart 2: Gasly decides that after seeing AlphaTauri’s struggles in 2022, it’s time for a change of scenery. He winds up getting pitted against a childhood rival whom the media attempts to paint as his enemy. Their first year together is marred with collisions in Australia and Hungary, and the start of their second year sees them floundering at the tail end of the field. However, they have some stellar performances at the season end, highlighted by the double podium in Brazil, and wind up way higher up the WCC order than they anticipated at the start of the year.\n\nPart 3: ???', ""Between Gasly and Ocon it really wasn't. Melbourne 2023 was a freak accident for which there didn't appear to be any real animosity between them, and Monaco 2024 was silly by Ocon but the team reaction was extremely irrational and made it Wade worse than it had to be...\n\nI think in some ways it was probably easier for them to work together in a professional manner given they weren't trying to preserve any personal friendship while also competing directly against one another.\n\nBrazil 2024 was a really nice send-off for their partnership honestly."", ""It might have been a mess. If the car wasn't so bad."", 'Ocon has the win at all cost attitude of a champion.

In Brazil, he made a pitstop judgement error during the 1st SC period, otherwise would've potentially beaten DC in the race. In Spain and Canada, he crashed out in qualifying. In Spain, he crashed out at the start, but it was an unfortunate incident. In Canada, he came from the pitlane to finish 6th, but would've finished 7th instead, if not for the car problems that DC had, when DC was running a net 5th. \n\n2005 - Raikkonen Vs Montoya - 10-6 in races, Raikkonen was 0.362 faster than Montoya on average in qualifying. \n\nRaikkonen - Malaysia, Spain, Monaco, Canada, France, Germany, Turkey, Spa, Japan, China\n\nMontoya - Australia, Europe, Silverstone, Hungary, Monza, Brazil \n\nMontoya beat Raikkonen in Australia, Brazil and helped Raikkonen win in Spa, was slightly better than him. Montoya was better than Raikkonen in Canada as well, but got black flagged because of missing the red light, as Raikkonen got preferential treatment in the last pitstop phase with SC. In Europe, he got ahead because Raikkonen had his self-inflicted suspension failure. In Silverstone/Monza, he got helped by Raikkonen's 10 place grid penalty, otherwise would've been beaten, no question. In Hungary, he again got helped by Raikkonen going out first on the track in qualifying, in dusty conditions. He also had his tennis injury early on, so missed Bahrain/San Marino, where Raikkonen was better than both De La Rosa and Wurz."", 'Anyone else totally uninterested about today’s livery launch event ?', 'Will MBS appear at F1 75 tonight?

Actually not just memes, but their comments in general. Like today I saw a post of Max in the event and the caption is "" Max really does not want to be there"" and then someone commenting Max doesn\'t like these type of events. But we know, we\'ve known for a decade it\'s so low effort. It\'s the same as if Max wins a race, "" He\'s world class, generational talent"". And if you think I\'m using the example of Max for a reason, I\'m not. Lewis can finish 3rd place in one race with a good drive and there comes the ""That\'s what champions do, or he\'s still got it"". He had it 2 weeks before it didn\'t go elsewhere. Or max with a regular run of the mill win and it\'s ""A champion\'s drive"". With memes it\'s always the same same same Ferrari bs that keeps getting recycled, anything about Ferrari is mentioned and it\'s"" As long as they don\'t mess up the strategy "" or ""We are checking "" and the other nonsense like "" My tyres are gone Bono"" and honestly it\'s same ol same ol with all the teams and drivers. If McLaren loses a race, "" Norris choked again he\'ll never be champion"". Like it\'s so dull now everything with F1 in terms of fans reactions and comments. Growing up in the 90s and 2000s, things were a lot more professional to say and it wasn\'t so boring and cheap as it feels like now. And not every race resulted in a debate between two drivers or calling one driver the goat and another finished. No one thought that Schumacher could win in a Minardi but today people would say put Max in a Sauber and he\'d win or whatever. People were realistic. It just all feels so off right now. I\'m so tired of seeing the same stuff again. And another thing, why are people so defensive of their favourite drivers? I wouldn\'t be as defensive of my family nevermind my favourite drivers the way people are on here. You cannot say a word against certain drivers without being called out for it and also apparently certain drivers are perfect all the time']",9,68,0.77,9,121,121,-3,1,-0.09999999999999998,-3

1isqpvu,Overall Event Thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1isqpvu/overall_event_thoughts/,2025-02-18, Discussion,"We are littered with posts on all the specifics for the event but what are peoples overall thoughts on it?

**My thoughts:**

Ultimately I think it was a waist of time and it really was a ""spot the difference"" event on the livery for most of the cars. I am not apposed to the idea of some from of season launch event, but it needs work.

\- Jack Whitehall made it not boring and I like his work but I also think he does fit the sport. The event would have been worse without him but it needed someone else that fits better.

\- There has been far to much confusion on event day and leading up to it. Seeing ""F1"" based TikTok accounts where the ""fans"" talking about car shakedown stealth liveries thinking they final etc.

\- I just think it was odd with some 2024 cars, some with a version of the 2025 car in livery was messy

\- The drivers, wether in suits or not and everything not consistent just felt messy

\- Clearly some drivers did not want to be there. I am not sure how you handle it next time but not like that.

\- It has to be an event that has more, news, break down, help new fans with season summary and not just a spot the difference on livery design with awkward interviews and comments.

**Things to change for 2025:**

\- It needs to be rebranded as a the ""F1 season launch event"" where it does show off the teams and cars but more generalised to represent it as an event getting ready for the season  
\- Teams shakedowns if before event need to be behind close doors  
\- Cars have to be new car (or close to) with new livery  
\- No livery or outfit reveals of any kind by the teams before the event  
\- Drivers need to be on stage in race gear with hermit's  
\- Team marketing and press information releases after the event  
\- Set better date for the event considering the other points  
\- Presenter who has energy but has more connections with the sport

Otherwise it really is pointless","['whitehall was hilarious and ramsay was heroic', ""Overall it wasn't bad, but it's a bit silly when half the teams don't have a new livery so what is really the point."", 'to me, wasnt that bad, was doing other things with it in the background, wouldn’t pay to go, but don’t really swhy people wanted it to be bad, Its better than having 10 separate corporate events everyone hated last year, but ig people likes things they hated when they no longer have the choice to hate it', ""But there's not enough time F1 season is ending in late December and after that everyone needs 1 month's break minimum so i dont think you can push this event to an early date"", 'How do you propose they do a shakedown behind closed doors? Do you know of any indoor races tracks suitable for an F1 car?', 'I thought it was far better than it had any right to be. Jack Whitehall was great, it was fun seeing what different teams did with the slot (Williams, VCARB and Aston Martin especially good, Alpine dreadful) and I liked it as a season launch. Lots to refine for next year (maybe some better interviews, set up the storylines for the year ahead) but I can see this becoming a calendar staple.', 'I don\'t think it was bad at all for a first event. As far as I know this has been a ""one off"" with the potential of making it permanent in the future. Obviously a lot of improvement could be done so it actually has a bit of meaning, but overall I think it was quite nice.\n\nNot everyone has to be exactly the same, I kinda liked that AM did whatever they wanted to do and we won\'t have 10 times just a car with 2 drivers coming on the stage and have the same stuff. It also fits their branding to come in a smoking instead of race suits and all. Imo there should be a nice balance between some serious ""reveals"" and have whatever the teams etc want to do. That way it\'s nice and fun to watch, and it doesn\'t feel like you are watching an FIA PC or something.', 'I may be biased. I just want to see cars doing what cars do. Going around a track.', 'The event was awesome. As with most of the “bells and whistles” stuff, if you’re not into it and just want to watch cars race, tune out. Nobody is forcing this stuff onto you. People demanding this stuff be declared a waste of time and getting into heated debates about why it shouldn’t be done this way are the F1 equivalent of “old man yells at cloud”.']",0,58,0.35,0,49,49,0,5,0.02999999999999997,0
