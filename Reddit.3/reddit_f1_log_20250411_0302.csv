1jw23n1,Isn't Japan the way it is supposed to be?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jw23n1/isnt_japan_the_way_it_is_supposed_to_be/,2025-04-10, Discussion,"If you line all the cars up in order of how fast they go i.e. qualifying, and then barring any accidents, shouldn't they naturally finish in that order.

Japan has been deemed boring, yet it's quite surprising that more races aren't like this.

There were other issues such as on a damp drying track going off line made it even harder to pass.

If you want to spice things up, there's reverse grids, which is silly, qualifying 1st come last in Monacco. Or drivers trying to get the lowest qualifying time but within the 107%. So that's out.

Randomised grid order, everyone will start in 1 position once. Requires the same number of cars as there are races. Plus starting last is more of a hinderence at some tracks than others.
And its a literal lottery.

So here's my idea. 3 rounds of qualifying you must use soft, medium, and hard compounds. But once you use one in a round you can only use that tyre, unless it rains.

Teams at the back could start on soft and try to get to Q2 but will then have a disadvantage in the later rounds. It adds an aspect of strategy in to play, which will mix up the grids, but is still based on performance and team strategy.

Either it's fine as it is, or there needs to be a shake up. Anyone got a better idea?","['The only thing worse than a boring race is a race ruined by gimmicks.
