So at the peak of the winter break, I ask your predictions on how the 2025 season will end in terms of rivalry of Williams pair Sainz and Albon. 

You can predict any statistics you want, from race&quali H2H to WDC points if you feel lucky.

I'll start:
Race Head to Head: 14-9 in favor of Sainz (I reckon there will be 1 race they'll both DNF'd)

Qualifying Head to Head: 13-11 in favor of Sainz

WDC Positions: Sainz P8, Albon P11

Best of luck and a very Happy New Year to everyone!","['Williams finishing 8th and 11th is a bold prediction ill give you that', ""I reckon Sainz will do similarly to Hülkenberg this year. Best of the rest, benefitting of top teams taking each other out. \nJudging from the way he locked in during the post season test I don't think Albon stands a chance.\nI'd say it will be something like 15-7 for Sainz, as for drivers standings, who knows what Williams will be able to put together for next year, so I'll only guess that Sainz will be 3 places up.\n\nEdit: can't do math, but a 2:1 race finish ratio essentially."", ""I won't predict stats, but I will predict that Carlos will pull a McLaren-era level of team work, sharing data with Alex (like he did it with Lando) so they can both maximize their performance and squeeze every last tenth from the car.

My hope is that the pace Albon showed in his first races at RB (and started to recover towards the end of 2020) is more of who he is up against the best, rather than the pace he had in most of 2020. Not sure if that makes sense, but I think about those races where he got punted from a probable win and a probable 2nd place and am always wondering what if? He’s talked a lot about how everything that happened at RB really messed with his head over time and he seems like he’s in a much stronger place mentally now.\n\nIf he gets his clock cleaned then he’s probably done in F1 after his current contract (and I suppose before if it’s really bad, but I think that would take a lot), which would be sad as I really like him as a person, but I don’t think he has enough stock to survive that when Williams has Colapinto (who I think is overhyped, but is promising) in the wings.', 'Sainz is going to have him for a light supper', 'I disagree with basically every prediction. First of all, I think Williams will be much lower. I don’t predict they’re higher than 7th, but more likely 8th or 9th. I also don’t think race will be close.

Williams has been at times fast but an unstable platform, bad on tyres, whereas the Ferrari has been able to be pushed right to the limit (both Sainz and LeClerc have been able to recover big slides)\n\nIf Williams get their stability sorted out then Sainz and Albon will be well-matched, with Sainz shading it. If they don't, I expect Albon to lead the way and Sainz to come back towards the end of the season, with Albon ending up leading driver because of a fast start.\n\nTo be honest, as to who scores the most points, that will probably be down to luck and retirements.\n\nAs a pairing, it's very, very strong, and probably more than Williams' performances deserve""]",83,148,0.81,83,1551,1551,4,0,0.0,4

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.
