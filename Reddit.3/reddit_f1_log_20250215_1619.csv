But to arbitrarily discard Leclerc, Hamilton and Piastri (and potentially Russell) before the season begins seems slightly premature.', 'What is the worst car to be dragged in championship contention? My pick is the 1997 Ferrari, barely beating the 2012 car.', 'I thought the season was starting today and I’m now gutted 😭', 'Will Max be slower because he is a father?', ""Which would you say was Button's best season? I guess the 3 contenders would be 2006, 2009, and 2011."", 'Do you feel that this start of the leason is lackluster or is it business as usual?', 'They aren’t discarding Leclerc or Piastri, the social media accounts are even making posts about them winning their first championships this year. Lando vs Max will obviously get more focus because that was the big story last year. Piastri is also being hyped by sky with those interviews', '1998 and 2010 Ferrari were even worse than those two relative to the best car. Schumacher took the title down to the last round in 1998 against a completely dominant McLaren car. Alonso did the same in 2010 against Red Bull.\n\nI would call the 1997 Williams and 2012 Red Bull the best cars, but not dominant cars.', 'I think you’ve got the two best examples there. 1998 Ferrari were perhaps further off the leaders than the 1997 Ferrari and 2012 Ferrari, but they were also solidly second fastest (so would always be on the podium), whereas in 1997 and 2012 there was a really close midfield which meant they could be pushed back even further down the order. \n\n1982 Williams is also a good shout. Of course there are mitigating circumstances with both the Ferrari drivers’ accidents, but Rosberg still did really well to beat the McLarens and the Renaults. \n\n2010 Ferrari and McLaren are also up there. Not necessarily bad cars, but they had no right taking it to the final race against the much quicker Red Bull.']",8,20,0.78,8,18,18,1,1,-0.039999999999999925,1
