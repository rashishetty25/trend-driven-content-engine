1hk8x55,Why did Mika Hakkinen take a sabbatical from Formula 1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hk8x55/why_did_mika_hakkinen_take_a_sabbatical_from/,2024-12-22, Discussion,"I know for a fact that he took a sabbatical, but a sabbatical is considered a sabbatical given that he/she returns. But Mika did not, instead he went to DTM. Was Mika too old for F1 or did other teams did not want Mika in their car? I dont recall Ron & Mika having a fallout which lead to his sabbatical. Also, how good or bad was his DTM career? I saw some stats on Wiki it said 5th 8th and 11th, but I dont know if Hakkinen's cars were top tier or just mediocre which was unable to deliver good results, or that he was bad in DTM.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the awesome responses.","[""My understanding was that he didn't feel he could commit anymore since the birth of his child, effectively putting his family before the sport.

Watch his incar video to see pure, pure fear in his body language then total mute shock as he walks away. \n\nHe didn't want to get into a car at all after Brazil. Dennis convinced him to continue. Then he decided to retire, and again Dennis convinced him to pitch it as a sabbatical, but it never was as far as MH was concerned.\n\nThese aren't my opinion - they're what he's said.\n\nHe's been asked if Spain 2001 was the final straw and he said no, that just sucked.

1hkqm89,Women liking F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkqm89/women_liking_f1/,2024-12-23, Discussion,"so I'm a teen (f) and I've been watching F1 since I can remember. I literally grew up watching every race, my father being a hard-core fan. Hell I saw some of these ""big"" races, like I remember watching anxiously as Romain Grosjean spun off, the car catching fire and I even remember then the feed being cut off cause they did not want to show anymore incase he didn't make it out alive. 

Anyway, I've been a core ferrari fan all my life. It's not because of any one thing in particular and I don't support all of the teams decisions, but because it was a team my father once supported. I fell in love with RED and the emotions attached with the teams previous driver like Räikkönen and Vettel. 

But now, it's become so insanely mainstream. Drive to survive has made it into this insanely big thing where there are so many people who now all of a sudden care about motorsport only cause the drivers look good. There's no issue with being a new fan, however my issue is that so many people talking only about the drivers looks invalidates the skill and people who care about the racing aspect, especially as a woman.
The moment you talk about F1 with men who don't know you, the first assumption is that we only watch the sport cause of the men. I had to mention the ferrari thing earlier now because it happens a lot more when you saw you're a ferrari fan.

Now, obviously certain men are the issue but it's genuinely becoming increasingly common to have a view point as such and I wanted to know of other women who watch F1 have experienced a similar outlook.

Disclaimer, I'm not talking about all men or only men but it's simply an observation.","[""For every gate there's a crappy keeper that wants to deem people not worthy. Never feel the need to prove your f1ness to some asshat.

People that are worth your time will come to realize that you love F1 for the racing, and those that don’t, just don’t waste your time worrying about them. \n\nI’m sure your dad knows that you like the racing, and your close friends probably do too.

You don't have to justify yourself to some insecure bozo. \n\nMy personal opinion is that people are free to enjoy a sport however they please. If they go for a driver for looks, that's their choice.

I've been to the USGP in Austin 3x with GA tickets. Generally seen some good racing but with the attendance levels and heat in TX even in October, we decided next year to pull the trigger on an experience package at a race in Europe.

We have it narrowed down to the Austrian, British, or Belgian GP, and before we book I wanted to check here to see if what first-hand experience with any of these races folks might have that could factor into our decision.

Right now my preference is ranked:

- Austria - great scenery, good racing, have never been to this country 
- Belgium - always has the potential to be an epic race, also have never been
- GB - historic race, home race for many drivers, easy to get to, but always packed

Any Other Current Drivers Interested in Trying It?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkkp0q/will_max_verstappen_go_for_the_triple_crown_any/,2024-12-23, Discussion,"With Max Verstappen dominating F1 in recent years, there’s been growing speculation about whether he could pursue the prestigious Triple Crown of motorsport — winning the Monaco Grand Prix, the Indy 500, and Le Mans 24 Hours. Given his impressive versatility and success, do you think Verstappen would take on this challenge, or is he more focused on F1 titles?

Also, are there any other current drivers on the F1 grid who might be interested in pursuing the Triple Crown? Could we see other stars like Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, or someone else try their hand at this iconic feat?

Would love to hear your thoughts!","[""Max has said before he's not interested in running ovals for safety reasons.\n\nIt's not impossible his attitude changes eventually, Grosjean said similar when he went over to the states but wound up running them anyway as an example. But at least for now that rules the 500 out."", 'Don’t think he’s interested in being in the Indy 500 but he’ll absolutely do Le Mans eventually.', 'Alonso would be the closest. I doubt Max will do an oval, but totally going to do LeMans I think.\n\nWhen Hamilton is done with F1 he will get lost in his other ventures.\n\nDanny Ric is the only past winner of Monaco I could maybe see doing it.', ""Villeneuve and Montoya are both an le mans win away from the triple crown. Montoya has won the 24 hours of Daytona a few times and won classes at least mans, just not it overall. He last did le man's in 2023"", 'Well Fernando has tried and won Le Mans and was close at Indy 2019. I’m sure once he retires for real he will go and attempt to win the Indy', ""Fernando is the one closest to getting it, as he's won both Monaco GP and LeMans twice. He's only missing out on Indy 500 which he's actively been trying to win but didn't manage. There's another version of the triple crown, which doesn't include the Monaco GP but an F1 championship instead, which Alonso also holds.\n\nOther than that, Hamilton has never shown any interest in racing in other series so he's pretty much out of the question. Max could do it and has certainly expressed a desire to race in WEC so LeMans would definitely be on the table, but I'm not sure he's interested in the Indy 500. Most of the rest of the field doesn't have a single leg of the either triple crowns yet, with only Leclerc having won Monaco now that Pérez is gone. And outside the grid, only Montoya and Villeneuve have two of the three crowns (Monaco GP win and F1 championship respectively), with both being a bit too old now to have any hope of getting the third one. So it's pretty much on Max and Alonso now."", 'I do see Max running the 24 Hours of LeMans, but he has ruled out an Indianapolis 500 attempt over safety concerns', 'If Max accomplishes the Triple Crown, I don’t think it’ll be for the reason that he’s “going” for the Triple Crown. \n\nMax has said before he’s not a stat chaser. Even the elusive 8 world championship stat doesn’t seem intriguing to him. So I think if he were to achieve the Triple Crown it’d be because he’s just that good at every racing series and has had the opportunity to do all of them.\n\nI think at least if he were to go after the Triple, he’d have to either fully retire or take a sabbatical from F1 within the next 4 years or so.', 'Sorry if this is a rookie question, but are ovals generally considered more dangerous than F1 tracks or why is max thinking this?', 'Why do you think max isn’t interested in the Indy 500?']",0,18,0.3,0,18,18,0,1,0.03999999999999998,0
