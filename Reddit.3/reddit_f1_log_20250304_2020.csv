The employee who accuses him of inappropriate behavior is going to the British employment court. This is reported by De Telegraaf. In the meantime, English media are not allowed to report on the case.\n\n\n\nThe 51-year-old Horner was acquitted after an internal investigation by the Formula 1 racing team. The case came to light in early February 2024. At the end of that month, it was announced that he could stay on as team boss, after completion of the investigation. The female employee appealed, but Horner was acquitted again.

""The message was that I was not allowed to use anything from the email, otherwise legal action would be taken. The tone was quite intimidating. I was addressed as the recipient of the email.""\n\nAt the time, the team boss did not want to answer any questions about the matter after the successful opening race in Bahrain, in which Verstappen and then teammate Perez scored a \'1-2\'. ""He blamed it on a private situation and only wanted to answer questions about the racing. He even gave compliments when a journalist asked a question about the sporting situation on the track after a while.""\n\n""During the past season, the British media asked fewer and fewer questions about the incident and eventually it went quiet,"" Dekker concludes.', ""Surprising that it will take until January for the case to be heard, effectively making it 2 years since the story initially broke.

1j2t5n9,A brief history of the rumours of Lewis to Ferrari…,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j2t5n9/a_brief_history_of_the_rumours_of_lewis_to_ferrari/,2025-03-03, Discussion,"In a new article with Autohebdo (sadly paywalled, I will post a link in the comments) Fred Vasseur says the following:

 *""We both started talking about it at the Monaco GP 2023, on May 28, my birthday to be precise. I quickly realized that it could happen. I knew that the desire was there on his side, that it had always been there in fact. It wasn't possible on our side for 2024, because we had both our drivers under contract. Lewis had always had Ferrari in the back of his mind, and I thought the planets were aligning. For me, having Lewis associated with Charles was one more stone in the edifice.""*

I remembered vaguely that there were some rumours about this at the time, and looking back there were indeed rumours - but crucially, these were *before* the May 28th date that Vasseur gives.

Daily Mail’s Jonathan McEvoy initially reported this on the 22nd -

*“EXCLUSIVE: Ferrari are set to offer Lewis Hamilton £40MILLION deal to race in red next season and the chance to eclipse hero Michael Schumacher - with chief John Elkann already in close contact with the British driver”*

With plenty of subsequent discussion on this by various outlets - opinion pieces as to whether Lewis should consider ditching Mercedes, whether he would be right to move to Ferrari, 

Lewis denied the rumours on the 25th, in the press cons before Monaco:

*Hamilton answered with a blunt and unhesitant “no” when asked if he had been approached by Ferrari.*

And Fred also denied this on the 25th:

*Asked if he had talked with Hamilton, or would he, Vasseur answered: ""We didn't have discussions. I think every single team on the grid would like to have Hamilton at one stage, it would be bull**** to not say something like this.*

On the 28th, Toto suggested the story was planted to influence negotiations that were then ongoing around the renewal of Lewis’ Mercedes contract:

*""We've had a pact - and we've had that since many, many years - that we wouldn't talk to any other driver before we have taken a decision to stay together or not, so I was never a millimetre in doubt that there were any discussions,"" Wolff said. ""Someone just placed that (story), maybe to, in a way, to play a role in what seemed to be negotiation, but it is not negotiation, it is sitting at a table and saying, 'what is it we need to adapt to in the contract?' So there's nothing to it.”*

However, now Fred says this is the day they began talking!

I wonder if the discussion about it made them decide to pursue ;)","['this was the weekend of the infamous “hello lewis” from charles in the presscon LMFAO', 'Also at the Monaco Pres Cons, they asked Charles about what he looks for in a teammate, and he thought for a second, before he started giggling and turned to Lewis, who was with him.

The 2010 Abu Dhabi GP might be one certain example. While there was a legendary 4-way championship going on, the on track action was terrible. Combine the fact that this was before DRS was a thing, and it was pretty much evident that the only way you could get over someone was through pitting.

I am a long-time racing fan (the first F1 season I followed was 1994, yet in my childhood) and a great lover of history, my other passion. Soon, I became an avid reader of both and somebody who had always wanted to explore the rich past of motor sport. Later, I started doing serious research and writing.

Are there more history enthusiasts? I'd love to discuss their interests and know any communities where it's possible to deepen my knowledge and also contact with more racing-related people, as well as understand what the target audience expects to read in an every-changing world (I confess I'm not too keen on the digital side of things).
