In any case, I don\'t think anyone is close to Ron (was the TP from 81 to 09) in that regard. How do you measure how good is a TP? For me, it\'s how well one does through multiple iterations of the team (drivers, designers, CTOs) and rulesets/eras.\n\n\nToto has won titles in, essentially, 2 eras (14-16 and 17-21), both under one common regulation set (the engines), with 2 drivers. Throw in any other name, and there\'s a ""but"" in the argument. Horner? Always had Newey. Todt? Always had Schumi, Brown, Byrne. The only other name worth mentioning is Chapman, but his success is more to do with him being the designer/CTO rather than the TP. \n\n\nRon has won titles in the early 80s turbo, the late 80s NA, the late 90s v10 era, and the spaceship late 2000s era. He\'s won titles with multiple drivers, under multiple designers/technical teams.', ""I always question the validity of the claim that Toto is the best team principal.

The first major rule change under Toto's tenure has been a failure by all stretches of the imagination.  \n\nToto to me has always been a money guy. I see Horner as a die-hard, he will retire at RBR.

He explained that they unfortunately couldn\'t provide any special glue (no surprises there!) but he was happy for my support and suggested that modelling glue used on model planes might work well. He also included a signed photo of David Coulthard and apologised that they\'d run out of Mika\'s. I grant a secretary or someone might have written it, but it was signed in ink by the man himself.\n\nThis was during the off season between 1998/1999, obviously a very busy time for the team, so to think he made the effort to write back to a child asking for carbon-fibre grade glue is quite wonderful.', 'It has to be called Fifty Shades of Grey.', ""Matt Bishop has said Ron is indeed writing a book but it's not especially rapid because he's a pretty old man by this point, and he's not rushing anything."", 'Chapter 3 - Clean Desk Philosophy\n\n""Yes.""\n\nChapter 4 - ...', ""If could choose one moment in F1 history, to be the fly on the wall, it would be the moment that Mosley said certain something into Ron's ear.

1imyulw,Am I the only one actually optimistic for the F1 Movie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1imyulw/am_i_the_only_one_actually_optimistic_for_the_f1/,2025-02-11, Discussion,"Title. I feel like any post about the movie has half the comments being unneccessarily pessimistic. Calling it Driven on a higher budget. I feel like judging a movie from less than 3 minutes of promotional material is a bit odd, especially since just last year we had Transformers ONE which convinced everyone the movie would be terrible based on the marketing only for it to be a great film. Claiming a movie will be bad preemptively is just a little sad.

F1 fans in general seem to be under the impression this movie should only be for the extremely passionate fans who know every inch of the sport,otherwise it won't be good, when that's clearly not the case. Like any good fandom movie, it's designed to be something casual fans, experts, and people who vaguely know a guy named Lewis Hamilton can watch and enjoy. 

There's a lot of positives to take in my opinion. The Top Gun Maverick director is working on this one, so at the least the racing scenes should be fantastic and with Lewis helping out with production, they will try to maintain some degree of accuracy. They've also got the writer from the Transformers movies and Hans Zimmer working on it. I saw people whining about some of clips they've been recording, but we don't even know how those will look in post or if they'll even be in the movie, given they recorded clips of both Brad Pitt and Damson Idris winning in Abu Dhabi. They could always scrap or heavily edit them.

As for the plot, will it be like Rush or FordVFerrari? Absolutely not, because they aren't making a biopic, they're making a relvatively original plot that needs to not dumb it down too much to deter passionate fans nor make it so niche that casual viewers and the secondary audience aren't confused, which anybody would know is much more difficult than it sounds, especially with a fanbase as fickle as this one. Will there be some Hollywood cheesiness in it as a result? Of course there will be! But you can't disagree even some seasons in real life played perfectly straight with zero inaccuracies (something even Rush can't claim) would be accused of being ripped from Hollywood.

All I'm saying is, have a little faith. I will probably make a follow up to this with a review for the movie where I HOPE I'm not wrong.
