Giles Villeneuve’s friend and biographer, Gerald Donaldson, described Ron as the most successful team boss in F1 history. Maybe this is now Toto Wolfe but he’s unlikely to write his bio just yet.  ","['“When faced with any decision, I always ask myself - does this come in grey? If the answer is yes, I always choose that. \n\nAnd no funny haircuts.

Maybe this is now Toto Wolfe\n\nI was actually thinking, recently, who the most successful TPs were in F1 history. I know the quote says owner, but owners don\'t have the impact TPs have. In any case, I don\'t think anyone is close to Ron (was the TP from 81 to 09) in that regard. How do you measure how good is a TP? For me, it\'s how well one does through multiple iterations of the team (drivers, designers, CTOs) and rulesets/eras.\n\n\nToto has won titles in, essentially, 2 eras (14-16 and 17-21), both under one common regulation set (the engines), with 2 drivers. Throw in any other name, and there\'s a ""but"" in the argument. Horner? Always had Newey. Todt? Always had Schumi, Brown, Byrne. The only other name worth mentioning is Chapman, but his success is more to do with him being the designer/CTO rather than the TP. \n\n\nRon has won titles in the early 80s turbo, the late 80s NA, the late 90s v10 era, and the spaceship late 2000s era. He\'s won titles with multiple drivers, under multiple designers/technical teams.', ""I always question the validity of the claim that Toto is the best team principal. Like him or loathe him, I personally put Christian Horner ahead as he successfully built Red Bull from the ground up. \n\n1. Toto effectively elbowed Ross Brawn out after Brawn had done all the hard yards to establish the framework of Mercedes entering the turbo era.\n\n2. Most people credit Nikki for bringing Hamilton to Mercedes. \n\n3. This success was also maintained in the pre-cost cap era when Mercedes could\xa0build a B-spec car if the first one was shit. \n\n4. The first major rule change under Toto's tenure has been a failure by all stretches of the imagination.  \n\nToto to me has always been a money guy. I see Horner as a die-hard, he will retire at RBR. Toto (IMO) will wind up as CEO of F1 or some other such post."", 'Do many people loathe Ron Dennis?

He explained that they unfortunately couldn\'t provide any special glue (no surprises there!) but he was happy for my support and suggested that modelling glue used on model planes might work well. He also included a signed photo of David Coulthard and apologised that they\'d run out of Mika\'s. I grant a secretary or someone might have written it, but it was signed in ink by the man himself.\n\nThis was during the off season between 1998/1999, obviously a very busy time for the team, so to think he made the effort to write back to a child asking for carbon-fibre grade glue is quite wonderful.', 'It has to be called Fifty Shades of Grey.', ""Matt Bishop has said Ron is indeed writing a book but it's not especially rapid because he's a pretty old man by this point, and he's not rushing anything."", 'Chapter 3 - Clean Desk Philosophy\n\n""Yes.""\n\nChapter 4 - ...', ""If could choose one moment in F1 history, to be the fly on the wall, it would be the moment that Mosley said certain something into Ron's ear.

1imyulw,Am I the only one actually optimistic for the F1 Movie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1imyulw/am_i_the_only_one_actually_optimistic_for_the_f1/,2025-02-11, Discussion,"Title. I feel like any post about the movie has half the comments being unneccessarily pessimistic. Calling it Driven on a higher budget. I feel like judging a movie from less than 3 minutes of promotional material is a bit odd, especially since just last year we had Transformers ONE which convinced everyone the movie would be terrible based on the marketing only for it to be a great film. Claiming a movie will be bad preemptively is just a little sad.

F1 fans in general seem to be under the impression this movie should only be for the extremely passionate fans who know every inch of the sport,otherwise it won't be good, when that's clearly not the case. Like any good fandom movie, it's designed to be something casual fans, experts, and people who vaguely know a guy named Lewis Hamilton can watch and enjoy. 

There's a lot of positives to take in my opinion. The Top Gun Maverick director is working on this one, so at the least the racing scenes should be fantastic and with Lewis helping out with production, they will try to maintain some degree of accuracy. They've also got the writer from the Transformers movies and Hans Zimmer working on it. I saw people whining about some of clips they've been recording, but we don't even know how those will look in post or if they'll even be in the movie, given they recorded clips of both Brad Pitt and Damson Idris winning in Abu Dhabi. They could always scrap or heavily edit them.

As for the plot, will it be like Rush or FordVFerrari? Absolutely not, because they aren't making a biopic, they're making a relvatively original plot that needs to not dumb it down too much to deter passionate fans nor make it so niche that casual viewers and the secondary audience aren't confused, which anybody would know is much more difficult than it sounds, especially with a fanbase as fickle as this one. Will there be some Hollywood cheesiness in it as a result? Of course there will be! But you can't disagree even some seasons in real life played perfectly straight with zero inaccuracies (something even Rush can't claim) would be accused of being ripped from Hollywood.

All I'm saying is, have a little faith. I will probably make a follow up to this with a review for the movie where I HOPE I'm not wrong.

I am sure there are some optimistic folks around here, like you as well."", 'I’m not optimistic because I don’t like Brad Pitt and he’s the lead.', ""I think it's going to be great, two hours of action and drama in a world that looks a lot like Formula 1.\n\nPeople get hung up on the accuracy of these things far too much in my view."", 'I’m excited, I’m going into it with the expectations of a fun drama f1 movie, not expecting it to be accurate or anything', ""I'm excited for the movie!\n\nMy only major gripe is it having the dumbest, most lazy movie name in the history of sports movies.\n\nIt's literally just F1 movie and the F1 logo...

With the launch of Reiss Season 2 Mclaren release (Some stuff looks really cool) one of the jackets has a couple of clear kiwi's on the front.  
Another Jacket I am really keen on. I was talking to my friend about it. Not an F1 fan as long as myself but big fan for over a decade himself.

I said ""Its nice to have the clear representation, the kiwi in the logo is to simple.""   
And he was like ""whaaaat?""  
While he knew Mclaren origins were New Zealand he did not know the shape in the logo was a kiwi. I had to show him the older logo's for him to get it.

So it got me thinking, how many people do not know what that shape was?

It was designed by Raymond Loewy as a gift from\xa0one of the team's sponsors and evokes a chequered flag.  \n\n>1991-1997: As our ambition on the track converged with our\xa0nascent road car division, the three chevrons merged into one, and the font became more modern and sophisticated. The logo may have changed but our cars remained as successful as ever.  \n\n>1997-2006: The revamped logo that first appeared in 1997 featured a streamlined speedmark that bares similarities to the vortices created by our rear wing. It appeared on the top of our cars’ side-pods.
