I am writing a paper on how effective the FIA was in regard to safety advancements along the years. Something I cannot seem to find is why the FIA took so long for the HANS to be mandated and what caused that decision. Was it a specific accident? The HANS device was developed in the mid 1980s, but mandated in 2003. Any help is much appreciated! Also, if you know where to find that information (hopefully from a reputable source :) please let me know!!) Thank you!","['[https://www.thepitcrewonline.net/2018/07/30/safety-in-motorsports-week-the-hans-device/](https://www.thepitcrewonline.net/2018/07/30/safety-in-motorsports-week-the-hans-device/)\n\n*The Head and Neck System (more commonly referred to as the HANS device) is often overlooked in the world of modern Formula One. Its historical significance, though,\xa0should not be underestimated, not least because at the time of its introduction it was one of very, very few occasions in F1‚Äôs history up to that point where the FIA had reacted to a non-fatal accident. The accident in question occurred at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, hosted at the popular Adelaide circuit. At one of the fastest points on the track, a rapid tyre deflation sent Mika Hakkinen ‚Äì then in his third season in F1 ‚Äì hurtling into the barriers. The impact was so extreme that his neck hyperextended, his skull was fractured, he swallowed his tongue, and he suffered major internal bleeding. He spent over two months in hospital ‚Äì a significant amount of that in intensive care ‚Äì but he eventually made a full recovery and returned to F1 for the 1996 season.*\n\nThe crash: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwVpVLDWG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwVpVLDWG8)', 'Not specific to F1 but the HANS device was quite unpopular amongst drivers for a long time. A couple of factors for drivers not liking it was because it was easy to get the fit and setup wrong, which would cause the wearer major discomfort, and that it pins the driver down more than seatbelts alone, something that many drivers disliked. Dale Earnhardt Sr., who lost his life to a basilar skull fracture, the very injury that the HANS device is meant to prevent, famously referred to it as ‚Äúthat damned noose‚Äù and complained that it restricted his range of motion and limited his competitive advantage. His death was one of many, but arguably the most high profile, that led to the HANS becoming mandatory in major racing series.', 'If you‚Äôre writing a paper on FIA safety then I hope you‚Äôre including a section on Prof. Sid Watkins and all he did for the sport.', ""The HANS device was possibly accelerated by the death of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, considered one of the sport's all-time legends on a level akin to Senna, dying in a crash that was completely survivable if the the device was equipped; the sport made it available to drivers, but he utterly detested it, throwing it out of the car on every opportunity, until the largest race of the year, the Daytona 500 in 2001, when, on the final lap, he died in front of an audience of millions - this caused NASCAR to mandate it and quite possibly accelerated the moves of sanctioning bodies worldwide."", ""The hans is uncomfortable, and even distracting to drivers sometimes. It's not a natural feeling to have your head tied to your chest. Some drivers even rallied that it would be dangerous. \n\nYou should look into Rubens Barrichello who had actually received special permission to forgo the Hans even after it was mandated. He only ran a single race in Australia 2003 before the FIA cracked down and told him either wear it, or they'd find a driver that would.\n\nAnd don't forget to mention, Dale Sr wasn't the only driver to suffer a deadly injury that the HANS would have protected from, there is also Roman Ratzenberger, Adam Petty, Blaise Alexander (who was fatally injured 7 months AFTER Earnhardt and was Nascars real final straw)"", ""Safety isn't sexy.\xa0\n\n\nThe Halo was pretty widely condemned as ugly, but this has since been shut down by several instances where the driver was clearly saved by it, most famously Romain Grosjean.\xa0\n\n\nTyre tethers were only added after the death of Ayrton Senna. Marshals had been killed prior to this by bouncing tyres.\xa0\n\n\nJackie Stewart is a good person to look at for championing safety in motor sport. There was a time when a few deaths per year was just what happened."", 'For the same reasons that it took years to even develop the Halo, despite the calls that were made immediately after the death of Henry Surtees; far too many people clinging to the bizarre notion of making the sport ""too safe"", plus aesthetic concerns and the fact it wasn\'t particularly comfortable.', ""Karting doesn't mandate neck braces, still at least in UK. Our daughter always wore one (a motorcross one) but it wasn't seen as a 'cool kid' thing & most stopped as they got older. This cool kid attitude to safety needs to be stopped in F1 & down through the levels of motorsport."", 'Not-Invented-Here\n\n  \nIIRC, it was invented by Jim Downing (IMSA Kudzu Mazda fame) and a colleague.', 'They talk about this in the USA 2002 episode of bring back V10s (or perhaps Austria), about how some drivers found it uncomfortable.']",48,35,0.82,48,35,35,1,0,0.0,1
