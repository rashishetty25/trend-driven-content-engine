1ninqcx,What could happen to Fornaroli if he wins F2?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ninqcx/what_could_happen_to_fornaroli_if_he_wins_f2/,2025-09-16, Discussion,"So even though there seems to be quite a close title fight for the f2 title, it seems none of the contenders will land an F1 seat if they come out as winners. With Williams having the two drivers on multi-year contracts, Browning for sure has no chance of making the grid next year. Jak Crawford, Aston Martin's academy driver would no doubt miss out on a seat next season, given Stroll's place in the team. Verschoor I doubt will win but is unsigned. But most of all the most upsetting and uncertain situation is Fornaroli's who is not part of any driver academy and is on-course to win back to back F3 and F2 titles. What do you think will happen to him IF he ends up taking the F2 title in his first season? Feels like a prodigy might go unsigned and disappear into the chaotic world of motorsport.","[""The thing is, everyone who watches F3 and F2 knows that Trident F3 and Invicta F2 are the best teams by far. I can go on about this point for a while.\n\nFornaroli and Bortoleto were rookies in F3 Trident together. Bortoleto was the F3 winner, Fornaroli was 11th place in the same team.\n\nIf points were only given away in features, not in reverse grid races, Browning would be leading the championship, not Fornaroli. Fornaroli's gotten a bunch of reverse grid points, which F1 teams don't favor as highly for good reason.\n\nIf Fornaroli does win this year, I think he might get an F1 seat, but I think he might have to sit out a year first, and that wouldn't be anything unusual. Oscar sat out a year even after going back to back rookie champions, which Fornaroli is not."", ""The current grid is pretty much locked in after the new rookies this year. \n\nThe regular driver churn is Baby Bulls or Alpine. Marko wants to use his driver pipeline. If he is making exceptions it's for the next multi WDC potential. Fornaroli doesn't have that pace. Alpine has Aron if they want to do some change. I don't really think Fornaroli is better than Aron. \n\nCadillac is committed to Herta. Things have to go really bad for a seat to open there. \n\nLawrence wants a WDC + Lance at Aston. So that seat isn't really going for a rookie."", ""No disrespect to Fornaroli but he's not a prodigy in the F1 sense. He had one win in his entire single seater career prior to entering F2, won F3 without a  win, and is now driving for the best team on the grid. And even then, as others have mentioned, he's ahead because of reverse grid wins. It's great that he's a consistent driver but F1 teams value raw pace much more. Plus anyway it's difficult for him to get a seat, the only options are Alpine and RB, and both have Aron and Lindblad respectively waiting in the wings"", '>\xa0Feels like a prodigy might go unsigned and disappear into the chaotic world of motorsport.\n\n\nI\'d wait before labelling him a prodigy.\n\n\n*How* you win F2/F3 is just as if not more important than winning it.\n\n\nHis F3 season was great but he won no races.

For Spa we want to go with Gold 3, however the tickets are sold out from the cirucit organisers itself and only available from F1 so I saw on youtube it's a bit of a hit or miss.

For Monza we are going with 8B which looks like this (I'm a Hamilton fan so if we see him win in Monza it'll be crazy but the likelyhood of that is none)

1njabhz,Is pursuing sustainable fuel worth the unintended side Effects?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1njabhz/is_pursuing_sustainable_fuel_worth_the_unintended/,2025-09-17, Discussion,"I was listening to latest episode of the race podcast regarding some of the things Domenicali said lately. And they zoomed in on the sustainable fuel and all the extra consequences it might bring.. for one; not all teams get free fuel from their fuel sponsor. Sustainable fuel will be like much more expensive, where they pay for like 2-3 million for fuel per season, this could go up to 12-15 million per season with sustainable fuel. That's a serious increase in costs for smaller teams. Just to have ""cleaner"" fuel.

Also there are talks about the fuel being standardised and that would eliminate the r&d aspect and thus make it less interesting for partner ships..how important are these partnerships? Sometimes you hear they gained some power because of better fuel, but it's marginal.

And is it fair, some teams have to pay for fuel and others don't?

What do you guys think, are these unintended side effects / collateral damage worth pursuing sustainable fuel? Will it really trickle down to the consumer automotive? It's been a long time since we have seen any substantial contribution from F1 to the automotive industry, for normal people. Not the hybrid supercars with F1 style power trains. And should F1 be a test lab for consumer automotive? 

The plus side of the sustainable fuel idea is that it comes with the return of V8, (after there wasn't a consensus abot the V10) but that's only a plus if the V8 can be like in the old days and not muzzled like the V6. Because if the V8 is just as fuel flow / rev Limited the sound won't be much better. what benefits are there to a V8 then? Just more power? ","[""It's not unintended side effects, it's unintended consequences. And yes it's worth it."", ""If you can't pay you can't play. I'm sure there will be some sort of cost cap exemption or the likes to offset the fuel costs. No team goes racing by not spending money. The fact they spend millions on fuel is just the cost of going racing if they can't pay they need to find a different sport to compete in or find a sponsor to pay."", 'There are over 1.5 billion cars in the world, so going electric is not the complete solution, as most people cannot afford to buy new cars. Sustainable fuels are a far better option for everyone. Yes, developing these fuels costs money, and some companies are further ahead than others. Nevertheless, if racing can introduce fuel formulas that clearly work, the benefits will eventually trickle down to the general population, making it a priority worth pursuing. Sebastian Vettel has already demonstrated this by running sustainable fuels in his McLaren MP4/8 and Williams FW14B (yes, he owns both), proving that racing cars can be driven at speed using them.', ""Sustainable fuels are new, actively being researched, and expensive. Using them in a global competitive environment should increase the pace of development, and thus reduce the time for them to become cost effective enough to reach the consumer market. If they are better for the environment that is a *huge* win for the planet's health."", ""I don't personally care about sound. I respect that others do, but it's not my thing. I'd personally prefer F1 cars not be louder because of very easily proven hearing loss related to sound. But I'm interested in sustainable fuel.\n\nThe first lab created diamond was ridiculously expensive to make. Early ones were still expensive. Now, it's much cheaper to make them. Profit motive can be harnessed for good things."", 'What unintended side effects?', ""Yes consequences is the word i was looking for.\nWhy is it worth it? For racing ir doesn't matter what kind of fuel is used, I very much doubt we will get V8's (unless next year's rules turn out to be very bad for the spectacle) and if we get them, they won't be like before. And F1 contributing to consumer automotive, that's what they said with the current power units and that didn't happen. There's no correlation between the current electric or hybrid vehicles and F1 tech, other than in supercars."", ""Sure, but if the costs go 6x or more up just because the gov body wants to pretend they are involved in the solution of climate change, you have to wonder if that's fair.
