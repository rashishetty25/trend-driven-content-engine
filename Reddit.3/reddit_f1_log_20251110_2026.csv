I'm just giving my opinion on ‘Do I think it's going to be as easy?’ I won last weekend by 30 seconds, very, very easy. I won today by pushing a lot more, only 10 seconds, and Max was probably the quickest out on track today.

Do I think that at a track that we've never been good at, we were very good here two years ago, we almost challenged Max for the win, we've never been good in Vegas. So why am I going to think, ‘Yeah, it's going to be fine, whatever?’ I'm giving my opinion, I'm giving my honest opinion on how I think we're going to be.

Maybe I'll win, then we'll see. But I'm not going to lie and say ‘Yeah, I'm very confident and I think it's going to be an easy weekend’ because I don't think that's how it's going to be.

2025 - Antonelli has scored 122 points in 22 Grand Prix races and 4 Sprint races - 110 points from GPs and 12 from Sprints. This is in a season where championship points are awarded from 25 to 1 for the top 10 finishers in GPs, and  8 to 1 for the top 8 finishers in Sprints. In GP races alone, he is averaging 6.47 points per race.

2007 - Hamilton scored 109 points in 17 Grand Prix races; there were no Sprint races. In 2007 points were awarded 10 to 1 for the top 8 finishers. In those races Hamilton averaged 6.41 points per race. If the 2025 points system were in place for 2007, Hamilton would have totaled 263 points that year, averaging 15.47 points per race.

I think it's fair to say Kimi's rookie season has been very good, but isn't anywhere near as good as Lewis' rookie season in 2007.

Hopefully, this will foster more **detailed and thoughtful discussion** than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters are to be avoided. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""Great race. Maybe some thought needs to be put on the type of tarmac used in other tracks because seeing real tyre wear and 2 stoppers is such a game changer.\n\nThe only downside is that the title fight is starting to simmer down with these results, Lando found his groove in a massive way and it's gonna take a small miracle from Oscar or a MAJOR miracle from Max to stop him."", ""Lando is getting a lot of well-deserved credit for his run of form, but I want to specifically point out the improvements he's made on his starts from pole. He's now converted every single standing start from pole position (7) to victory in the last 365 days and has done so without losing the lead at the start for any of them, something that seemed unthinkable for him last season: Abu Dhabi, Australia, Monaco, Austria, Mexico, and Brazil (gp and sprint). The one pole he has failed to convert to victory in the last year was Spa, which had a rolling start.\n\n*(Yes, he made a mistake in turn 1 and Oscar capitalized, but considering the unique circumstances \\[rolling start, wet\\] and the factors working against him \\[pole being notoriously difficult to hold onto at Spa, plus whatever role his battery issues played\\], I don't think it's unreasonable to look at that one as an outlier and not fully representative for his current form).*\n\nHis starts and SC restarts were perfect this weekend including in the damp conditions of the sprint, and last race out in Mexico he held onto pole at a track where leading into turn 1 from pole is notoriously difficult. His starts are still not perfect and he has plenty of room for improvement, as we've seen this season in races where he's starting P2/P3 etc, but it's clear he's absolutely worked on this achilles heel that plagued him for much of last season and it's nice as a fan to see the tangible improvements he's made and the results that come with it. I think the same could be said for Oscar, as much as his current slump is the topic right now, it's clear he knew qualifying was a weakness of his last year and took huge strides to improve going into this year, and it paid off for him for much of the season."", 'I have to keep reminding myself that rookies and younger drivers are more often than not going to be wildly inconsistent.

Alonso fortunately managed his race well, even after conceding the position in a *(never seen ever)* tussle with Leclerc. Stroll had a decent one as well. But Christ, them going on the hards in the main race definitely killed some of the momentum that they have had.

I might be wrong, but at this point it feels more likely that Max takes P2 in the championship than Oscar wins it. And yeah, McLaren’s strategy for him was a bit weird... they kept him out forever in the first stint only to go for a two-stop anyway.\n* Those final laps between Max and Kimi were amazing.

When your long-staying employee was taken out through no fault of his own during a race, and your decorated 7-time world champion has a car that is looking like it\'ll break under the weight of its grip and stability issues, how are they able to work with those? Funny that the comparison to the WEC team came about, because the latter *(that is under AF CORSE by the way)* actually had everyone working in sync to ensure maximum potential was extracted DESPITE the BoP issues plaguing them. It is the effort of both team and driver that got them there, not this *""we must stay united and i demand maximum results""* malarkey\n\nFrankly, it seems that everytime I talk about Ferrari\'s lows, I keep circling back to the same fundamental issue.

1otgqka,A visual analysis of Piastris Penalty,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otgqka/a_visual_analysis_of_piastris_penalty/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"The basis for any analysis has to be the Driving Standard Guidelines obviously, which say:

>A. Overtaking on the INSIDE of a corner:

>To be entitled to be given room when overtaking on the INSIDE, the overtaking car must:

>i) Have its front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE THE MIRROR of the other car PRIOR TO AND AT THE

>APEX

>ii) Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex, and not have “dived in”.

>iii) In the Stewards’ estimation, have taken a reasonable racing line and been able to complete the

>move whilst remaining within track limits.

As well as:

>Chicanes and S-Bends:

>i) The above guides for INSIDE and OUTSIDE may apply for each element of the combination.

>Generally, priority will be given to the first corner element.

That being said, the FIA does not further clarify what overlap the overtaking car has to have inbetween the not further specified ""prior to the apex"" and the apex on it self.  
The interesting question is how they deal with cases were the overtaking car has an overlap of the frontaxle with the other cars mirrors.   
Because when you have to brake for the inside line, you have to brake earlier than for the outside line. Oscar Piastri braking earlier than Kimi Antonelli can be ovserved on his onboard.

What I did was look up at what point Piastri initiated his braking from the onboard and then cross-referenced it to the camera shot from above. I then drew some parallel lines through the front axle of Leclercs and Piastris car as well as Piastris and Antonellis rear wing.   
[The resulting picture is this](https://imgur.com/a/GYAkbFq).  
They all matched up pretty precisely, so unless all three of them had the same deviation from going straight, they should be a pretty precise 90° angle to the direction of the straight.

So from the line going through piastris front axle, it looks like Piastris front axle, at the point of braking, where you have to decide if you go for the move or not, is in fact overlapping Antonellis mirrors. Although of course the image is tilted, so the different height of the axle and the mirrors shift the perspective a bit. but even then, the picture shows a bit of safety margin.

So what the FIA is basically claryfying with their decision is:  
Even if you have an overlap on the straight and at the start of the braking zone, you are NOT entitled to a line if you have to brake harder and therefore do not have the overlap anymore.

From here on I'll quickly talk about why the other points of the sporting section do not (fully) apply.

1. ""Overlap at the Apex"" - pretty easy. They did not reach the Apex before coliding, so this can not apply. 
2. ""Be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex"" - While many argued that his lock up shows that he is not in full control, I refuse this proposition. The front left tyre which he locks up is unloaded in the first corner and has a far lower friction coefficient than the right front which he does not lock up. Which means, that even though the front left locks up, he still is very close to the braking optimum (albeit flatspotting his front left). Behind him, Russell locks up in exactly the same way and is still able to turn in normally despite the lock up.
3. ""and not have “dived in”."" - A divebomb is when a car brakes later than the car in front to reach an overlap. It might include not being able to take the inside line with the resulting speed. Piastri did in fact brake earlier than Antonelli.

So the only thing left to penalize Piastri for is losing the required overlap inbetween the braking zone and the apex.  
Which should sound wrong to anybody, as it means that braking later to have that overlap and force the other driver into a wider line is fine. While braking earlier means you are left with no way out, if the outside driver does not give you room.","['Good in depth analysis.\n\nWorth noting that there is historic precedent (several incidents last year) for the idea that the overtaking car needs to have the overlap and maintain the overlap all the way to the corner, so it is not unreasonable that they applied that same logic here.\n\nWhether or not that logic is sensible to be encoded into the guidelines in the first place is another thing.', ""\\>So from the line going through piastris front axle, it looks like Piastris front axle, at the point of braking, where you have to decide if you go for the move or not, is in fact overlapping Antonellis mirrors.\xa0\n\nThat's why I was saying for firstly that it is perfectly legal by current guidelines move, but they clearly judged next moments after braking began and Piastri started a little earlier because being inside. And still it was very close to being legal in current guidelines, like 1 m close after a heavy braking."", 'It says right there that the overtaking car must have its front axle at least alongside the mirror of the defending car prior to the apex. It says the exact same thing in the decision document. \n\n>""PIA did not establish the required overlap prior to and at the apex, as his front axle was not alongside the mirror of Car 12"".\n\nThat\'s the required overlap. \n\nWhether he managed to get alongside on the straight well before is pretty irrelevant. \n\n>So the only thing left to penalize Piastri for is losing the required overlap inbetween the braking zone and the apex.\n\nHe didn\'t manage to safely arrive at the apex. Therefore collision is on him since they didn\'t even reach the point (apex) where it could be assessed if he is entitled to the corner.', ""Honestly, I hate the rules and I also complained on reddit earlier about his penalty.

After an interesting brazil grand prix, Norris who does Piastri and Piastri who does Norris... Verstappen who comes back from hell and rejects Norris' coronation. I felt it was the right moment to share something I've been working on for the past few months.

I'm thrilled to introduce [metrikdelta.com](http://metrikdelta.com) a comprehensive F1 data analysis platform that I've developed with one core mission: making high level telemetry and race analytics accessible to every F1 enthusiast and complete features for new fans.

The platform is free to use I believe F1 data should be accessible to the community that makes this sport so special. There's an optional premium tier (€4.99/month) for Studio Pro content creation tools, but all analysis features remain completely free.

The site is fully mobile-responsive but I recommend desktop experience, and covers all recent seasons. Data is sourced through FastF1, And Jolpica F1

This is a passion project, I would genuinely appreciate your feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism. What features would make this more useful for you? What analyses would you like to see? How can I improve the experience? I know the site is not perfect I have a lot to do but I will do my best

I hope metrikdelta can add value to your F1 experience.

1otchep,Proposed Regulation Overhaul for Overtaking and Racing Room,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otchep/proposed_regulation_overhaul_for_overtaking_and/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"Hello dead F1 fans! Following the Piastri penalty I see a lot of chatter on the overtaking rules once again and how people think they are, simply put, not that good. It's too easy for the defending driver to be entitled to space and too hard for the attacking driver to get alongside to be eligible for a move (especially from the outside). 

  
This is simply a problem because I for one, enjoy a lot overtaking attempts on the outside and two these rules some times seem to be opposite of what we call the racing spirit. For these reason and many more I want to share with you a rule concept I thought of that could make side to side racing easier to exist and judge for fans and stewards alike.

**Determination of Racing Rights at Corner Entry**

1. **Establishing Overlap** A driver attempting to overtake is entitled to racing room if, at the moment the defending driver commits to turn-in, the front axle of the attacking car is at least alongside the rear axle of the defending car.
2. **Definition of Turn-In** “Turn-in” occurs when the defending car begins a sustained steering input that causes the car to start cornering. Brief or minimal steering movements that do not result in the car turning are **not** considered turn-in.
3. **Responsibilities**
   * When overlap exists at turn-in, both drivers must leave at least one car’s width of track for each other through the corner.
   * When no overlap exists at turn-in, the defending driver may take the normal racing line.
   * The attacking driver must remain under control and keep within track limits; loss of control cancels their right to space.
4. **Applicability to All Corners** For long or multi-apex corners, the overlap status at the initial committed turn-in applies for the duration of the corner.



# Key points

* **One clear moment of judgment:** the committed turn-in.
* **No numeric thresholds in the text:** FIA can set technical detection criteria (like steering-angle % and minimum lateral-G) in a separate appendix.
* **Works everywhere:** from Monaco’s hairpin to Monza’s Parabolica.

\---

  
So pretty much the idea is simple. When the defending driver actually commits to the corner that's when we judge whether the attacker should be allowed space or not. I think this is the easiest way for everyone to intuitively know where that moment is as the drivers and viewers alike pretty much understand which moment the defender starts cornering and if the stewards have to be involved they have to look at simple 3 data parameters and then check if the attacking car was alongside the defender the moment the defender committed to the corner. 



Thank you for reading and if you have any ideas please leave them below!

\*Bonus info\*

In this segment I want to simply clarify more when the moment of commitment actually happens;

# 1. Conceptual meaning

In racing terms, *turn-in* is the **moment a driver stops braking in a straight line and begins steering the car into the corner.**  
It’s the commitment point where the car transitions from longitudinal control (braking/acceleration) to lateral control (cornering).

At that moment:

* The driver has chosen a line and braking point.
* The car’s direction begins to change measurably.
* The defending driver’s ability to react or adjust line drastically reduces — which is why this instant is critical for judging overtaking rights.

# 2. Why this matters for rules

All overtaking rules depend on when both drivers have *committed* to their lines.  
The attacker must be alongside **before** that commitment — otherwise, the defender can’t be expected to leave space safely.

# 3. Technical definition (as used by telemetry or stewards)

>

# a. “Transition from neutral to sustained steering input”

* **Neutral** steering means the car is still moving roughly straight (minor corrections only).
* **Sustained input** means the driver holds a steady steering direction rather than quick flicks or wheel twitches.
* This prevents drivers from artificially triggering “turn-in” early with a fake steering blip.

# b. “Sufficient steering angle”

* The steering angle must reach a *meaningful percentage* of the typical angle required for that specific corner (about **30–50%**, depending on geometry).
* This ensures the car is genuinely beginning the turn, not just being adjusted in the braking zone.

# c. “Initiate lateral acceleration consistent with the corner”

* Lateral acceleration (side G-force) is the physical proof that the car has actually started turning.
* For an F1 car, anything above **0.4–0.6 g** indicates real cornering has begun.
* Combining this with steering data ensures turn-in is *objective*, not opinion-based.

# d. “Consistent with the corner being approached”

* Each corner has a characteristic radius and therefore a normal expected steering load.
* The telemetry comparison is relative to that corner’s geometry (so Parabolica and Monaco hairpin are judged differently).

# How it prevents abuse

* **Fake early steering:** doesn’t generate enough G or sustain → ignored.
* **Late divebomb:** attacker not alongside before turn-in → no right to space.
* **Fair inside move:** attacker has overlap before or exactly at turn-in → entitled to room.
* **Outside pass:** same logic — if overlap exists when the defender commits, the defender must leave room.","['The problem with any attempt to make a hard and fast rule about overtaking is that there are simply too many variables, it is always destined to fail. The idea of turn in point falls apart because every driver has a slightly different turn in point and way of doing it, the idea of the apex collapses because there are so many corners with multiple apexes or can be early or late etc.\n\nThe solution is simple, get a consistent group of permanent stewards made up of 3 drivers permanently so it’s not just 1 persons opinion carrying weight. If 2 of the 3 agree it’s a penalty, if all 3 agree then it’s the larger penalty (ie the difference between a 5 or 10 second as a slam dunk) and also allow them to issue a penalty for dangerous or unsporting defending without needing to prove moving in the braking zone.\n\nMost of all, cut out the “it’s been referred to the stewards” rubbish, they can intervene and issue a penalty without needing the race director to give them permission to look at it first, and hopefully will be much faster to get a decision.', ""Part of the reason for the existing rules is because it's simply not possible to be looking in the mirrors at predefined points to figure out if there's a car alongside while also trying to navigate the turn. \n\nThe current rules put an emphasis on the attacking car to ensure they're sufficiently alongside so the defending driver can see him from his cockpit whilst making the turn. \n\nThe thinking is, that the attacking driver can see the defending driver in his peripheral vision, but the defending driver can't have eyes in the back of their head, so the onus is put on the attacking driver to fairly make themselves visible to the defending driver's cockpit, so that safe racing can occur.\n\nYour suggestion is puts the onus on the defending driver to check where the car is \\_behind\\_ them, whilst also trying to spot their turn in and handle all the car control, which is exactly what the current rules are designed to avoid."", ""Not interested in chatGPT's 'ideas'."", 'I like where this is going', ""So until the axles line up, the front car can do fuck all?

1otby45,Red Bull Should Keep Tsunoda For 2026,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otby45/red_bull_should_keep_tsunoda_for_2026/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"I hope they keep Tsunoda.

Yes, he finished dead last, but keep in mind that he had *two* penalties, the second of which was caused by the team.
 
Without those extra 20 seconds he would have finished P8, having started P19. That's pretty solid.

I know it's popular to bash whoever happens to be in the second RB seat, but it seems that Tsunoda is improving, and is working better with the team. I am not sure whether that is down to Mekies.

For next year, the rules change completely so everyone starts from zero.

Would it not be more beneficial to continue with a driver that is known to the team and that right now is talking and working with the same people who are designing and will be developing next season's car?

The other option is of course Hadjar. He has been an amazing rookie. But is he mature and experienced enough to help develop next year's Red Bull, especially when he has no established rapport with Red Bull engineers and, as a rising star, will be under tremendous pressure next to Max in a car that is expected to win?

As much as I like Yuki, I have to admit that it's a tough decision. Laurent Mekies has worked with both drivers, so I suppose that he already has an opinion on the matter, and a well-educated one at that.

Personally, I'd err on the side of caution and keep Yuki for '26, and let Hadjar mature in the lower pressure environment of the second team. ","['With 2026 being the start of new regulations, there is absolutely no need to keep Tsunoda if they don’t think he is their future.', ""Tsunoda has gotten 25 points in the Red Bull car. 25 points over pretty much a whole season. He's out."", 'Why do you exclude the 10s Yuki caused himself from the timings? Surely you’d only exclude the penalty the team caused?', 'I get your argument but he just hasn’t performed at all, P17 in the standings is shameful for a Red Bull driver', ""The only argument for keeping Tsunoda is the potential damage it will do to Hadjar throwing him in that seat so soon.\n\nTsunoda has been dreadful and his performances do not warrant a seat at a top team, they didn't before he was promoted and they haven't done since he was promoted either.\n\nMy kids have a joke that Red Bull try to sandwich as much of the field as possible... last couple of races Tsunoda has been trying to keep up his end of the bargain and Max has let the side down."", ""To decide whether to keep him or not, you have to know what the team expects from a driver in his position. I suspect that RB may be searching for the next big star like they always did. That'd make even more sense now when Verstappen's commitment beyond 2026 is murky. In this regard, Tsunoda is clearly not the driver that can replace Max Verstappen, and hence he's not worth keeping."", ""the general ask for RBR second driver is that he should be useful for the WDC. Checo in Qatar sprint last year was literally a testing mule for Verstappen. Their car was awful that sprint but with his sprint they were able to get Verstappen a working car for the race and he won it. That's kind of their requirement: feedback for car development, help with tyre selection, help with setup. Yuki hasn't been able to do that and there are a few races in 2025 Verstappen could have finished higher if they had been able to use Yuki as a second driver. So he won't keep that job."", 'Whatever decision Red Bull make will look like the wrong one.\n\nThe question is whether they want to give Hadjar more time to develop.', ""yuki is not good enough in the second car to keep the main team seat. he was barely ahead of a rookie lawson last year, and barely ahead, if at all, of rookie hadjar this year. he was put in the seat this year almost certainly because they didn't want to damage the confidence of the young drivers that they will have going forward.""]",0,102,0.31,0,95,95,0,2,-0.010000000000000009,0
