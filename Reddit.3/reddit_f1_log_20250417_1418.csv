1k0yqbd,Explanation of Aerodynamics in F1 Cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k0yqbd/explanation_of_aerodynamics_in_f1_cars/,2025-04-16, Discussion,"Hi - I am an aerospace engineer with almost 2 decades of experience in rocket engines, missile systems, and aircraft. I have never worked on formula 1 cars, or any car for that matter. However, I know aerodynamics and the core principles remain the same across applications.

In these first few weeks of the season, I have seen a lot of talk about the Red Bull car in particular. In a lot of these discussions (including articles from journalists...) people seem to falsely equate how hard the car is to drive with it's speed. What I hope people take away from this post is that a car that is hard to drive can still be very fast. In fact, a worse ""window"" can actually make a car faster when inside that window (speaking purely in terms of aerodynamics).

As a side note, this is not about drivers. There is no question that Max is amazing. There is also no debate that the McLaren is fast, but I do think that some people are underestimating how fast the Red Bull actually is just because it is hard to drive.

So into the explanation (trying to make it ELI5):

Let's start with airfoils - airfoils are one of the main ways to create aerodynamic structures. Airfoils are a 2D shape that look like a tear drop - if you look at an aircraft wing, it is an airfoil that is extruded to 3D. 

Camber is the degree to which the airfoil is bent. Typically, if you camber an airfoil more the lift/downforce will increase, but so will the drag. Think about holding your hand out of the window while driving - a flat hand has no camber and a cupped hand is more cambered. You can also do a lot with how ""sensitive"" an airfoil is - meaning, there are some airfoils that are ""twitchy"" when it hits a gust of air (colloquially referred to as turbulence). In something like a commercial jet, they design their airfoils to be very stable - this makes them easier to fly safely, less prone to ""turbulence"", etc. The downside is that these more stable airfoils are very slow for maneuvering by design. So in contrast, they design combat aircraft (e.g. F-15)) with much more unstable, but also much more responsive aero surfaces. Engineers put a lot of time into optimizing these aero surfaces to be both responsive and stable, but it is always a trade off on some level.

The other important concept for people to understand is stall. Ideally you want air to ""stick"" to your airfoil, so you generate maximum lift with minimal drag - however when you angle the airfoil (say turn an F1 car) you increase the amount of flow that starts to separate - which if it gets bad enough is called ""stall"" and the surface loses most of it's lift (or downforce in F1 terms). Similar to the camber, some airfoil designs can be more sensitive to stall, but typically these have the lowest drag in ideal conditions.

In an F1 car you have literally thousands of individual aerodynamics surfaces. Not all of them are airfoils, but  they all follow the same principles. Engineers need to balance drag, downforce, responsiveness, and risk of stall on each surface in a variety of speeds, turns, temperatures, winds, etc.  Not to mention how suspension, stiffness, dirty air, etc. can also impact aerodynamic performance. Unfortunately, if you increase downforce (all else being equal) you also increase drag. If you lower drag to go faster you can cause some surfaces to stall in a corner. If you are quickest in clean air, it's possible you are compromising your speed in dirty air (think the McLaren in Japan).

I think if you read this far, the issues with Red Bull's car are pretty obvious. It has a very narrow window of conditions where it has optimal aerodynamics. They clearly have gotten ""spoiled"" by having a driver like Max who can consistently keep it in the proper window for peak performance - and thus have gradually opted for a faster car rather than a car that is easy to drive. Unfortunately, even if Max drives perfectly there are things outside of his control like temperatures, track layout, wind, etc. I do think that when the Red Bull is in the window, it is probably faster than the McLaren, but that window is a lot smaller than McLaren's so you rarely if ever get to see it. 

Of course McLaren could have discovered some kind of black magic that allows them to be the fastest, most responsive, and easiest to drive all in one package. It is possible, but in my opinion based on the races so far, it is more likely that they just struck a better balance between those various factors that provides better performance across the all of the tracks. And I would wager that, that McLaren is also quite hard to drive even if it is not as bad as the Red Bull.","['r/F1technical would probably enjoy this write-up as well', ""Your point about stability in clean air vs. dirty air is a really good one, and of the things that is overlooked the most in my opinion. Everyone knows that dirty air is a thing, but it's often underestimated how important it is and how the magnitude of the impact varies with the car design.\n\nIt's one of the things that irked me about all the Lando vs. Oscar comparisons last year. Was Lando really so much faster in Zandvoort and Singapore, or was it just the benefit of clean air? Was Oscar really faster in Spa and Hungary? The McLaren seems particularly sensitive in this regard. I remember in one of the last races in the year (I forget which one), Lando had great pace, until he reached the backmarkers and commented on how much harder it was in dirty air.\n\nIt makes it very difficult to get an honest gauge comparative pace sometimes. It's all part of the fun, but the engineer in me desperately wants every driver to drive every car at every track in every condition, purely so I can scratch the itch of having a proper dataset."", 'I was thinking about a lot of this myself, but it’s nice to hear a more professional perspective on the matter. And indeed there is overlap between a hard to drive car, and a fast car. One does not exclude the other.\n\nOn your end conclusion though… I mean, we’ll see how it turns out, but I do not believe Red Bull are in this without significant (and correct, can’t be understated) upgrades, either for the actual speed of the car, or the capability of setting it up correctly. In that regard they are behind and/or too dependent on outside conditions, which is also part of the game. Can’t build a car that only works when it’s rainbows amd sunshine.\n\nGreat technical insight though, loved the read!', 'so basically people misconstrued speed and cornering', 'https://preview.redd.it/hcn1ga9efave1.jpeg?width=552&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2900abaa3638975d4b1f6459bcc991326dccee28', "">Of course McLaren could have discovered some kind of black magic that allows them to be the fastest, most responsive, and easiest to drive all in one package.

And I would wager that, that McLaren is also quite hard to drive even if it is not as bad as the Red Bull.\n\nThere's more to car handling than aerodynamics.  It's already known what is making the McLaren so fast -- they're running a more radical anti-dive angle on the front suspension than other teams are, which makes them more stable under braking, which has a wide variety of benefits.  Other teams are afraid to copy this because apparently the anti-dive angle that McLaren is running is more structurally fragile -- it's apparently seen by the other teams on the grid as a bold and risky move, which is not what you usually do in the last year of a regulation cycle."", '![gif](giphy|JohcFDGT1HwBdcb0w2|downsized)', 'I’m having a hard time following the discussion of a “stable airfoil”.  While there are angular moments resulting from lift generation this pales in comparison the resulting moments from other primary control surfaces (horizontal tail/canards, etc) in creating stable responses to disturbances. A key difference being that these are purely aerodynamic effects in airplanes but are tied more to physical structure (how the wing is connected to the body, suspension, and eventually the ground) of automobiles.  Any change in this relationship is solely due to aero elasticity.   The F-15 is also a remarkably stable aircraft it just has tons of pitch authority due to absolute units on a horizontal stab.  The wing has camber optimized for an elliptical lift profile at a wide variety of angles of attack while also being remarkably efficient at area ruling for supersonic flight.  Not bad for 1960s slide rule toting engineers!', ""[*...this bit here is what Adrian Newey sees in his mind's eye when he's on the drawing board...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlDnd3B1rhs&ab_channel=wickedender)""]",358,44,0.92,358,272,272,20,0,0.0,20

So here I am, and I hope my takes will spark some debate.\n\nNote : this script was written right before Bahrain's Grand Prix.\n\nHave a good read!\n\nWhat if the 2025 season was bound to become the most boring season of the aero regulations era?\n\nDISCLAIMER : I am not talking about the championship title race! This year's title race could be the most exciting one since 2021.\n\nIt's been 3 races only, however there is a trend that is starting to emerge : the races are boring (if not for some gimmicky situation like in Australia).\n\nIf it was only that, I mean there wouldn't be much reason to be alarmed only after 3 races, but the thing that is worrying me is something else : the reason why the races were boring is exactly the same - there are no overtakes, no close racing, no excentric strategy...\n\nThere are 2 things that made me realise these issues : the recently reposted 2018 Bahrain Highlights and the 2022 Bahrain Highlights.\n\nEverything that made these 2 races so pleasant to watch are the reasons why the races this season feel so tame : can we imagine someone this season do what Vettel did in Bahrain 2018, forced to make the soft do 40 or so turns after Raikkonen's DNF, while being hunted down by Bottas till the last turn? can we even come close to the midtable action that was happening in 2018? can we ever see battles like the one Leclerc and Verstappen gave us in Bahrain 2022, overtaking one another relentlessly turn after turn?\n\n2022 was so promising of what this era regulations would give in terms of wheel to wheel racing. From what I heard, it seems that this aero regulations that was built to create close racing was corrupted slowly over the years, through upgrades that shouldn't have been allowed but that were allowed anyway like the front wing upgrade (from 2023/2024 Mercedes I think?) that was creating vortex, i.e. dirty air.\n\nAnd now here we are : every single driver complained about dirty air in Japan and not being able to chase even slightly close the driver in front of them. I am afraid that we are at a point of no return, where there is just too much dirty air to deal with.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the tyre issue, the ultra domination of the 1 stop strategy AND the seemingly constant resurfacing of all tracks making degradation non existant are making everything worse.\n\nI pray that I am wrong and that this year will be the best of this era regulations in terms of racing. \n\nBut beside all of that : What are your thoughts on the matter? Do you think the dirty air problem will not be that much of an issue this year? Or do you think the problem stems from somewhere else?"", 'Is Max leaving for Aston Martin?.\n\nhttps://www.gazzetta.it/motori/red-bull-racing/17-04-2025/verstappen-lascia-la-red-bull-f1-aston-martin-in-vantaggio.shtml?refresh_ce', 'Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were friends growing up (unlikely friends as well considering one grew up in riches in Monaco and the other was a black kid from England). They even celebrated the first podium they ever had together with hugs and jubilation in 2008.\xa0https://youtu.be/cjyXzoGf19Q?si=58r5XTCJ2PuRUvFj\xa0.\n\nThen in 2013 they became team mates, a dream come true.\xa0\n\nThen in 2014 their team, Mercedes, built easily the fastest car. It was so fast that no one else stood a chance even on their best days. So from the start of the season both knew that one of them would win.\xa0\n\nAnd it got competitive.\xa0\n\nRosberg won the opener in 2014 but only because Hamiltok had engine problems. Hamiltok then won the next four races in a row and Rosberg knew he had to do something. And so in a very controversial moment he went off the track in Momaco qualifying. This caused warning flags that meant Hamilton couldn’t improve his time and Rosberg would start first and win. It can be argued that it was a genuine accident, but personally, based on how the atmosphere within the team changed after, I think it was on purpose.\xa0\n\nOver the next few races the championship stayed very tight, and in Belgium they had their second coming together. The blame probably lies more on Rosberg for this one and it ended Hamilton’s race.\xa0\n\nBut Hamilton ended up winning the 2014 championship in the end.\xa0\n\nThen in 2015 they had the best car again but this time Hamilton was in a league of his own. Winning most races. As he made his way towards wrapping the title up early there were a few incidents at starts in Japan and particularly USA where Hamilton shoved Rosberg off the road to get ahead. The latter of these was the race Lewis won and sealed the title and also led to the infamous hat incident in the cooldown room.\xa0https://youtu.be/xEbhO7qZyK8?si=NWqwCSKInz_Ewsu9\xa0BasicallyHamilton threw the the number 2 hat to the unhappy Nico who threw it back.\xa0\n\nAfter sealing the 2015 title early Hamilton relaxed for a few races while Nico knuckled down and won all of the last 3 races. This momentum would be carried through to the following year when Mercedes again built easily the best car.\xa0\n\nRosberg won all 4 of the first 4 races in 2016 as Hamilton ran into various problems such as bad starts and engine failiures. This gave Rosberg a big championship lead but even at that stage not many thought Nico Rosberg could possible beat the great Lewis Hamilton. But by race 5, Spain, Hamilton was getting desperate. He was 43 points down in the championship and he fell behind Rosberg at the start. He had to get by. He couldt afford to lose any more points, and this led to the most famous of all their incidents\xa0https://youtu.be/gCzkaX2DL7w?si=JzQlu0FIAJKOsBHh.\xa0\n\nThis was in my opinion Hamilton’s fault though there is an argument it was Rosberg’s. Either way, this championship had just got serious.\xa0\n\nFollowing the incident it was Hamilton who began to claw back the advantage until Austria. It was the last lap and the first time they had gone wheel to wheel since Spain. And they came together again,\xa0https://youtu.be/ixmGVL4dedI?si=A0ud2ixdwgmdmKtK, now this one is entirely on Rosberg he got desperate on the last lap and seemed to try the only thing that could keep him the lead, this backfired and Hamilton won. In fact Rosberg now entered a rut in form for a few races and Hamilton won in his home race in Britain, Rosberg’s home race in Germany, and also in Hungary. So now Hamilton was the chanpinship leader at the summer break and Rosberg was the chaser. I think that Nico knew he didn’t have enough energy to fight for the chanpinship with Lewis forever, and he went to some extraordinary measures to try and gain subtle advantages over a driver that was more naturally talented than him.\xa0\n\nRosberg stopped exercising his legs to lose some weight there, he got mental coaches and psychologists and began to remove paint from his helmet to make his car mere hundredths of a second lighter and thus hundredths of a second faster. Tiny amounts, but he had to win. He \xa0basically seemed to neglect his wife and family to concentrate, and he blanked out the media mentally. He slept in a different room to his wife all season to get perfect sleep and even practiced meditation.\xa0\n\nSo we came back from the summer break and Rosberg won back to back to back races in Belgium, Italy and Singapore. But then in Malaysia he was hit from behind at the start and dropped to last. All hope seemed lost, the championship he was fighting so hard for, hung on a thread. And then it happened.\xa0\xa0https://youtu.be/H0XT6n4OuSY?si=mY4vn-ArhkuEaPmL. After leading the race by a big margin Hamilton was out Rosberg recovered to second place and then in Japan those extra thousandths of a second he found by removing paint from his helmet and muscle from his legs, may well have helped him get pole as the gap was down to about a hundredth of a second. Then at the start of the race Hamilton had a poor getaway and Nico thus won in Suzuka.\xa0\n\nAnd so now Nico realised that with four races to go all he had to do was come second in every one if Hamilton won to be champion. And that he did. It was difficult though with being forced wide in Mexico and torrential conditions in Brazil but he now just had to come in the top three in Abu Dhabi to be champion of the world, his dream. Hamilton led away and Rosberg was second. And then Hamilton realised that this was not enough and so he started to back Nico up. This forced both into the clutches of Vettel and a young Max Verstappen. Rosberg had to be perfect because while Vettel was a respected driver wheel to wheel, Max at this stage had quite the reputation for being both very fast and very chaotic. He had had a fair few incidents over the year and Rosberg was in big danger if Vettel got past.\xa0\n\nBut Vettel did not go for a lunge. Perhaps there was never a gap, perhaps Seb’s car wasnt fast enough, or perhaps he knew this wasnt his battle and that it was his fellow German’s day in the sun, day of \xa0days and Nico Rosberg became chanpion of the world for the first time in 2016 and as his wife congratulated him on the team radio Nico emerged from his car victorious….\n\nAnd he never got in the car again.\xa0\nA few days later he announced his shock retirement. His life’s dream was complete. He had won, and now he would spend time with his family. He has since made a YouTube channel and appears on Sky Sports broadcast from time to time while Lewis won the next four titles back to back to back to back from 2017-2020 and did not face a challenge like Rosberg’s until Max Verstappen was finally given the car to fight him in 2021.\n\nBut that’s a story for another day.']",8,41,0.73,8,39,39,0,4,0.0,0
