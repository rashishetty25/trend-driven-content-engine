How good was the coverage of SkyF1 yesterday. A sensible take on what was a great race on a circuit that probably has hosted its last race under Liberty Media.

So, a petition to SkyF1 team, see you can do better. It’s very simple, just hire the best people based on their merit and not appeasing to a box ticking exercise.

The commentary duo of Harry Benjamin & Anthony Davidson was so welcoming, none of the usual bias or snarky digs on particular teams/driver. Very engaging, for once you lot were on par with the commentary of CH4 (Whisper Media). Pre-race and  post analysis punditry were spot on with Jac Villeneuve (no frills) and Jamie Chadwick (please, you should offer her the gig on permanent basis, Jamie is a serious talent unlike your other Mickey Mouse club presenters.

Hope this was not a one-off. As a paying customer we need to see quality telly and not some PR platform for that spews drivel and bias narratives. Simples","[""If anyone ever says criticism of Danica Patrick is sexist, I'm just going to point to the fact that Bernie Collins and Jamie Chadwick are brilliant additions to the Sky F1 team. Plus Natalie Pinkham does a great job at anchoring the whole show. I'm always happy when Naomi Schiff is doing analysis too. I can take or leave Villeneuve tbh."", ""It's nice to have a change from Crofty.\n\nNothing against him but hearing a different voice can be a good thing \n\nBernie is always good and imo should be at more races, Villeneuve is fine in small doses and compared to the alternative I'll rather listen to him \n\nI'd love to see more of Rosberg and JB but It's probably hard to get them to commit to races often"", 'Bernie is absolutely top notch.', ""Thankfully Danica Patrick was off talking drivel about the Indy 500 qualifying.

Which is like 30% of the time.', 'I like Harry.

I found the sky commentary to be quite dull. I usually prefer Sky commentary because Crofty and Martin tend to be a little more colourful and ""edgy"" with their style - sure, Crofty is quite mistake-prone with driver names and sometimes they can get caught up in their own little world of biases and hyping up unlikely scenarios, but : Crofty is amazing for hype moments and bringing a little light heartedness to uneventful races and Martin is easily the best play-by-play commentator in the sport. \n\nAnthony is good when used sparingly, but he doesn\'t really have the flow or charisma to be a full time commentator imo, and it really showed yesterday. I dont mind Harry, he\'s less mistake prone to Crofty but lacks a bit of x-factor. I also noticed he repeats the same thing a bit too many times, like I swear he pointed out the aston martins starting in the top 10 like 3 times within the time span of 5 minutes. He\'d be much better paired with Martin imo.', 'I just want Martin Brundle, Palmer, and Rosberg to be on the same pundit team, then life would be complete. None of the others are necessary.

What he’s doing in that car is special.', 'Was he ever out of it? The Red Bull likes high speed front limited tracks. I’m expecting him to be somewhere in midfield in Monaco.', 'when did he leave the championship???', 'Translation and full article:\n\n> **Max Verstappen turned the tide in the World Championship battle with his second win of the season at Imola. How did he manage that? In our race analysis, we answer the most important questions about the Emilia Romagna GP.**\n\n> **Why was Red Bull so good?**\nAfter dominating the Miami race, McLaren had to concede defeat to Red Bull in the seventh race of the season. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri finished second and third, respectively, behind Max Verstappen, who controlled the entire race. Verstappen once again laid the foundation with his brilliant overtaking maneuver in the Villeneuve chicane. Overall, however, Red Bull also had the better pace than McLaren and was clearly the stronger force. This put them back in the fight for the World Championship.\n\n> Red Bull was on par with its arch-rivals in the 400th Grand Prix in precisely the discipline where McLaren usually excels – tire wear. Despite the warm temperatures, they managed to keep their tires alive. Another bonus: Like in Suzuka, they were in the lead and had a clear path and clean air. The pit stop just in time for the Virtual Safety Car, which was deployed due to Esteban Ocon\'s stranded Haas, played into the Bulls\' hands.\n\n> But even afterward, it became clear: Verstappen had everything under control. He extended his lead to 18 seconds before the safety car neutralized the race due to Kimi Antonelli\'s damaged Mercedes. In other words, he controlled the race from start to finish. ""He was never under pressure,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. After the safety car, he opened up a lead of 6.1 seconds over ten laps.\n\n> This strength is primarily due to the car being brought into a better setup window. This also allows for better tire temperature management. This is partly due to the upgrades that have been made to the RB21 since Miami. These included a different underbody, and in Imola, a different cooling intake and new brake ventilation.\n\n> Although Friday didn\'t look so promising, Horner reports that Verstappen was happy after the third practice session on Saturday. A typical picture of the difficult Friday – but they still needed time to evaluate and understand all the data. Horner even went so far as to say that they were at the same level as last year in Brazil. After all, Verstappen crossed the finish line 6.1 seconds ahead of Norris and 12.9 seconds ahead of Piastri.\n\n> Horner finds the current development very encouraging. ""We\'re building momentum, which is very important at this stage of the championship."" Verstappen is now third in the World Championship, just 22 points behind Piastri. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella sees two reasons why Red Bull was superior. ""They\'ve improved and made progress,"" he says. He was almost certain that the dominance they showed in Miami wouldn\'t be replicated to the same extent in Imola. ""The type of corners here are completely different from those in Miami. Here we have more fast corners.""\n\n> **Did McLaren expect the strategy with Oscar Piastri?**\nHowever, the question also arose as to whether there might have been more to gain if the McLaren command post had chosen Piastri to pursue a different strategy. The Australian and current World Championship leader made his first pit stop on lap 13 and switched from medium to hard tires. In doing so, he followed the example of Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari, who was the first of the leading group to adopt this tactic.\n\n> Piastri dropped from second to twelfth place, but then had to plow his way through the field. By lap 28, he was back in fourth place. But then came a gift for all those who hadn\'t yet stopped – including Verstappen: the Virtual Safety Car deployed due to Esteban Ocon\'s stranded Haas. Piastri also used the opportunity to switch back to medium. At his second opportunity, when the Safety Car was deployed on lap 46 for Kimi Antonelli, he stayed on the track and was later unable to defend himself against teammate Norris with the older tires.\n\n> ""It was unclear before the race whether it would be one or two stops,"" said McLaren team principal Andrea Stella after the race. ""And when Oscar came into the pits, that was exactly the moment to decide."" In his opinion, the problem was more that the hard tires didn\'t perform much better than the old medium tires. ""If that had been better, the two-stop strategy would have been a very good one – even if he would have had to overtake a few drivers,"" Stella said. ""That\'s why we have no regrets.""\n\n(1/2)', ""Excellent share and translation, thank you.\n\nRedBull's aero and brake cooling upgrades helped, but Max perfectly positioning himself to take the outside of T1, to get clean air, was his masterstroke."", 'He never left.', ""All depends, right now the McLaren works at every track.

Low-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

You can absolutely put everything together but luck also has a small part to play in how your race is going to go. It is what I thought of when I thought about some of the drivers that got their opportunities squandered after the VSC, particularly Sainz\n\nWilliams is on a roll! Strong as hell qualifying and a formidable race. A lot could have gone differently, most notably Sainz pitting right before the VSC was thrown into the mix. But it is a good thing he managed to recover it fairly well, with the pace that he had. Albon himself had a strong race as well. Minus the incident with Leclerc and being caught in dirty air, I think there was a real possibility of him ending up in podium places. From an overview glance, this team in this season is such an improvement over the last, and years that followed. What JV has managed to do with the team is commendable, with two drivers that are able to challenge each other and a group of trustworthy personnel back in Grove to get the job done, they are ending their weekends on a solid and maximising on what they can *(all without upgrades considering development is going towards the FW48 but if the FW47's performance window maintains and they can keep themselves ahead, then hell yeah)*\n\nOnward to the next few races! These results show promise and I am thrilled to see what else they have in store"", 'I predict we will see huge turn 1 crash between max and piastri within 2 weeks', 'Not the dull race I feared, but a bit of an odd one. Oscars poor start then choosing to block of George rather than Max (who was far more of a threat to the race win). Safety cars taking out most of the intrigue over the podium fight. Stewards decision over Charles and Albon made no sense, either it’s an acceptable move or it has to be a penalty. You can’t allow pushing someone off, allowing other cars through (especially the offenders teammate) but it’s all good because you gave the place back a few laps later. \n\nThe switch to even softer compounds did lead to some interesting mixups in both qualifying (some on mediums) and the race (mediums dying a bit in the middle of a stint, so some pitted mixing up strategies). I’m not sure the race effects would continue if this happened again (teams would learn to push through) but it did make a normal DRS train race a bit more exciting.', ""As much as how much I love how Monaco is just 6 days away, I feel bad for team Mercedes. Gonna spend the next couple of days having a closer look at what went wrong with Antonelli's car as well as how did Russell finish out of the top 5 also in the broader context of how did he get pushed out by the Ferraris and Albon, happy for them though especially Albon and Williams. This was a pretty good race weekend nonetheless."", 'If i was alex albon i think i would go insane, drive of a lifetime only to be throen away by charles', 'I actually think McLaren were still faster than Red Bull in Imola\xa0\n\nMcLaren qualified on pole position. If Max hadn’t made such a great move at the start (the one time in the race where car performance doenst matter) I doubt he would’ve won.\xa0\n\nThen Piastri made an early stop after seeing how the mediums seemed to be degrading and how powerful the undercut was with Leclerc. This backfired for two reasons.\xa0\n\n1, the mediums which appeared to have fallen off were actually just going through their graining phase, and in the end of it they were back to being as fast if not faster than the fresh hards again.\xa0\n\nAnd 2, Other teams realised that this was happening and stayed out far longer than McLaren had expected them to when they stopped Piastri. This meant that Piastri had to make on track moves on 7 cars, Tsunoda, Bearman, Colapinto, Hulkenburg, Hamilton, Antonelli and Hadjar. All of these lost him small amounts of time that added up, particularly because there was only one overtaking place for him. Furthermore this took a lot out of his tyres, losing him yet more time.\xa0\n\nVerstappen on the other hand did not have to pass a single car on track after lap 1. And on top of this tbe pit stop phase is often McLarens biggest strength and where they find a lot of their time. That didn’t just disappear today but was nullified by the factors I mentioned above.\xa0\n\nAnother thing we have to consider is that the timing of both the VSC and the full SC was extremely well placed for Max to make his two pit stops.\xa0\n\nMeanwhile McLaren were monumentally screwed by the VSC’s timing with Norris having just missed it by pitting a lap before, and Piastri who would’ve been two or three seconds off Max without the VSC, ended up over thirty seconds behind because they both stopped and thus after the VSC Max had made 1 stop and it was under VsC conditions and Oscar had made 2, one under VSC conditions and another normal stop. Effectively he had lost a pit stop to Max at the track with the longest pit lane in the calendar. The safety car for Antonelli then removed this gap but the damage was done.\xa0\n\nAnd then after the safety car came in Piastri was on old tyres while both Verstappen and Norris on new ones thoigh Norris’s weren’t as fresh as Verstappen’s). The McLarens had their own battle with each other, and the time Norris spent in Piastri’s dirty air, and him having to make an overtake will have taken life out of his tyres, which explains why Max was marginally faster than Norris in the five laps after Norris made his move on his team mate.\xa0On top of this Norris’s tyres, while newer, weren’t brand new like Verstappen’s were.\n\nI also believe Max is a better driver than the two McLaren drivers. This explains some of the gap as well. Were he in the McLaren I think he would have won by more than he did.\n\nBut I’m open to hearing your opinions!\xa0', ""Imola was a much better race than I expected at the start of the weekend. First of all hats off to Pirelli. The tyres actually made this weekend interesting. There was doubt between a one and a two stop (leading to Piastri pitting early). And also we had qualifying in which two different tyres could be used, which then had consequences for the race itself. I'm actually sad that Imola is going to disappear from the calendar next season. After four races Pirelli finally seems to have found the right compound mix. \n\n  \nI don't really understand what McLaren did with Oscars strategy. I've seen people comment that he went through his tyres too quickly, but he wasn't really much slower than Max or Lando at the time that he pitted. McLaren couldn't really pit Lando before Oscar, because he had already been undercut by Charles. Maybe they just panicked with the undercut from Charles being rather powerful, but Max and Oscar had like a 10s gap to Charles. They could've waited a little longer. After that Oscar was unlucky with the timing of the VSC/SC. The first gave Max a nice pitstop window and the second Oscar didn't have any new tyres left to put on the car. I will add that Max also could've just done a normal stop and have around a 4s margin to get out ahead of Oscar in fresh air.\n\n  \nWilliams once again with a great weekend. I'm not completely certain yet, but it seems like we can put Williams into a top 5 team discussion. They seem to be quite close with Ferrari and Mercedes (and Red Bull depending on the track). Speaking of Red Bull, it seemed like they actually had a race pace advantage and they didn't go through their tyres too quickly. I wonder if that's the track or if the new upgrades that they brought also played a part in that. I hope it's the last part, because Red Bull being closer to the McLaren is a lot more fun to watch for the remainder of the season. \n\nHadjar is still the most impressive rookie this season for me. Helmut has always spoken highly of him when he was in the junior categories, and so far it looks like Helmut was right. I hope Hadjar keeps it up. He's been entertaining both on and off track."", 'The drivers championship fight is shaping up very nicely, but with Red Bull closing up the way they are then McLaren, and their two drivers, need to be on top of their game. If the car performance is close enough, Max has the capacity to outrace both McLaren drivers; maybe not every single time but enough to keep his championship hopes alive. That move at turn 1-2 was epic but I was surprised that Oscar got caught out like that, I think it was a combination of him braking a bit early and placing his car very close to the inside to defend from George, who was himself shocked that Oscar allowed that to happen.']",9,59,0.74,9,58,58,4,53,-0.12,4

1kq9kug,My tire idea.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kq9kug/my_tire_idea/,2025-05-19, Discussion,"My idea was, bigger gaps between the tire compounds for an grand prix, and maybe bring a 4th compound. (or just give them free option to choose from all) But teams can only choose 3 for the weekend. 

So lets say Pirelli brings C2, C3, C5 and C6 to a weekend. Now each team can choose 3 compounds from these.

This way teams could put more strategy into their weekends. So lets say they bring C2 and C3 and C5. While a other team could bring C3, C5 and C6.

I think this could really spice up the strategy, and also be interesting in qualifying.... We could see maybe teams do more 2 stop strategies, or they might go hard and try to go super long one stop. 

It would be a bit of a logistical challenge, and maybe a nightmare to follow for the fans. But at least if they use C1-C6 Its somewhat logical. (not like a couple of years ago with Super soft, Ultra Sort, Hyper soft XD)","['Tires are not the problem. Bigger tire differences will only enlarge the performance gap between teams.
