1j7w9un,[AMuS] Silver Arrow loses test race clearly,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j7w9un/amus_silver_arrow_loses_test_race_clearly/,2025-03-10, News,Translation in comments. ,"['I never trust Mercedes in pre-season', ""Last season, weather conditions influenced the cars' behaviour a lot. We'll see this year, but I wouldn't take the Bahrain testing results as a gospel of truth"", '> Mercedes analyzed the data from the test drives in Bahrain. The engineers found that the McLaren was significantly faster. But not all questions have been answered yet.\n\n> The Groundeffect era has not gone according to plan for Mercedes so far. With the introduction of the current regulations in 2022, the great series of successes ended after eight constructors\' cups in a row. For three years, the factory team searched in vain for a way back to success. George Russell and Lewis Hamilton did manage four victories last season. In the team standings, however, they were defeated by McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull by a relatively clear margin.\n\n> With the new AMG W16, they finally want to attack at the front again. The car has some aggressive changes - for example, the sidepods have ultra-narrow air intakes. On the front suspension, the track rod has been placed behind the wishbone, as was the case with McLaren last year. To do this, the engineers tested two new noses in Bahrain, which were used alternately. However, the team kept a secret how the two variants affect the handling and which nose will be used in Melbourne.\n\n> In general, the technicians drew a positive conclusion after the three days of testing. There were no concerns about reliability. The new W16 rolled around the desert circuit like clockwork. Only in the last morning session did the Silver Arrow suffer a small hiccup. A battery change meant that almost an hour was lost in the pits. Afterwards, it turned out that the change had not been necessary at all. A small electrical gremlin had led to an error message.\n\n> Otherwise, the engineers carried out the planned program almost completely. Because Mercedes did not hold the usual shakedown in Silverstone this year, it was not necessarily expected that the W16 would even secure the weekly best in the distance classification with 458 laps - just ahead of Haas (457) and Toro Rosso (456).\n\n> Expectations were also basically met in terms of performance. The data collected on the track corresponded to the values \u200b\u200bpreviously calculated in the simulations. The feedback from both drivers was accordingly positive. The engineers also expressed cautious optimism that the new W16 would no longer show the major fluctuations in form of its predecessor, which, depending on the conditions, sometimes drove all opponents into the ground and then lagged hopelessly behind again.\n\n> ""The team worked hard over the winter to improve the weaknesses of the W15. Judging by the first signs, we seem to have made good progress in these areas,"" said chief engineer Andrew Shovlin with satisfaction. In Bahrain, the drivers could not see any major outliers either up or down. The working window seems to have become larger, and the handling a little more stable. However, the temperature fluctuations on the three days in Bahrain were more moderate. It was never as cold as it was in Las Vegas last year or as hot as it was in Budapest. So it is still too early to give the all-clear.\n\n> But even if the internal performance targets have been achieved, that doesn\'t automatically mean that the new Silver Arrow is a World Championship candidate again. Formula 1 is a relative business. If the others develop even better, your own progress is of little use. In this case, McLaren seems to have pulled well ahead of its direct competitors. The Mercedes engineers were shocked to discover that the gap on the long runs was between half a second and a whole second.\n\n> In a direct comparison of the race simulations, George Russell would have finished 20 seconds behind Oscar Piastri, who was driving parallel on the final day. Andrea Kimi Antonelli shared the track with Lando Norris in his test race on the second day. In the end, he was half a minute behind. These are worlds of difference in Formula 1 that are not easy to make up.\n\n> It is only a small consolation that Mercedes was able to keep up with Ferrari and Red Bull in the chasing pack. All three teams hope that the changeable and sometimes very windy conditions in Bahrain were not representative and that the gap will automatically be reduced somewhat.\n\n> Ferrari also used the excuse that the SF-25 was carrying a lot of excess weight because of the many sensors. At Red Bull, the setup was not yet right. In addition, Max Verstappen did not use a comparable racing simulation. So there is still some room for improvement here.\n\n> Mercedes also did not appear to have a perfect set-up during its long runs. The engineers\' aim during the test drives was not to adapt the car to the Bahrain track as best as possible, but to try out as many settings as possible with a view to the rest of the season. In order to gain experience, they also went in extreme setup directions, which did not always lead to a positive result. The question is how close McLaren was to the ideal performance. The pursuers should not assume that the papaya racer has already reached its best form.', 'The only certainty is that McLaren are the quickest. My how much? Not certain. Who’s behind them? Even less certain. \n\nCan’t help feel the cool temperatures flatter Merc. When that was in play last season they were outright quickest. Otherwise they were 4th at best.', "">The data collected on the track corresponded to the values \u200b\u200bpreviously calculated in the simulations\n\nReal world data finally correlating to the simulations is Mercedes' version of Next Year"", 'His big a lead do we think Lando could build by the time the flexi regulation changes hit?\n\nCould be like last season but with max and co chasing Lando’s early lead down?', ""Didn't everybody think McLaren was doomed after testing last year?"", ""It was never realistic to expect them to fight the top 3 even with alot of positive changes. It's been a recurring theme now over the last 3 seasons that Merc don't know why their car isn't up there, and when it is up there, they don't know why it is up there. Like they know the 2024. car liked cold weather, but why exactly did it like cold weather so much it was useless without it remains a mystery and it seems like it's still the case for this year's car.\n\nThough it would be idiotic to take testing times for granted, or even other team's statements. Everyone likes to play underdog, everyone kind of writing off Ferrari already and saying it's McLaren's championship to lose, but Ferrari haven't really commented on the matter, just said it's all going in the right direction on all fronts. I'd wait until after Suzuka to make some educated predictions for the season.

1j7ztsj,Enough about the best drivers to never win a championship...

Some may say Stirling Moss, others say Ronnie Peterson. But that's not what I wanted to talk about today.

I wanna ask you, who do you think is/was the best team to never win the world constructors championship?

Was it BAR who came 2nd in 2004 and to this day hold the record for the most podiums without a win as a constructor?

Or was it BMW Sauber who looked genuinely competitive at the beginning of 2008 but really dropped the ball in 2009 and then pulled out?

Was it Jordan who had a shot at the 1999 title despite their funding being far off the one from Ferrari and McLaren?

Was it Ligier who came home in 3rd and 2nd in 1979 and 1980 respectively?

It's boring, incomplete, leaves so much to be desired, the pacing sucks, key events are left out entirely. It feels like a lame exercise in marketing. 

My question for veteran fans is, has it always been this bad, or was this just a shitty season of DTS? Am I finally beginning to understand the hate? At first I thought it was just declinining in quality, as most shows in their 7th season do, but I had the realization that maybe this is what it's always felt like for fans who have been following f1 for longer. I'm interested in hearing what others think about this! ","[""DtS works if you don't follow F1, but the moment you start following it, DtS stops working. This is because the Netflix program is not designed for enthusiasts but for a more general audience. On top of that, I got the feeling that teams have gotten the message and are starting to play along a bit, giving Netflix what Netflix wants."", ""I really liked Seasons 1 and 2, but it went downhill fast from there. Kept getting worse year on year.\n\nHaving said that, I watched all 7 seasons so I guess I'm part of the problem"", 'Nah, it’s always been like this. It just changes significantly when you already know the narratives and results and the *actual* stories, instead of the shoved down your throat “here’s an overly dramatized version of what kind of happened”. \n\nWelcome to the land of the converts. I still watch DtS, it’s interesting to see, and it keeps my wife kind of vaguely interested in the sport, but it’s *wild* explaining to her what actually happened after each show.', 'Meh idk I’ve been watching F1 since 2008 and I have always liked and continue to like DTS. If nothing else, it’s a great way to get hyped about the upcoming season about 1 weekend before the first race.\n\nThat said, I think it’s lost a bit of the “wow” factor since season 1. I feel like when the first season came out, most F1 teams had still not really learned social media and thus a lot of the behind the scenes was still mostly a large mystery. Then come DTS and it’s like wow.\n\nNowadays every team pretty much has social media presence and as one example Charles leclerc’s own YouTube channel had a behind the scenes for his Monaco weekend this year that sort of made his Monaco episode in DTS have less impact for me. In some ways I felt his YouTube video showed the behind the scenes even better. And that would not have happened in 2018 and was why DTS was such magic imo.\n\nNow with all that said, I still enjoyed this season. I’m not sure what you mean by boring and incomplete. Its goal has never been to provide a race by race recap of the season.', 'It started good in the first couple of seasons, then I think they just turned the drama dial to 10 in hopes to attract as many casual interest fans as possible. This season though is utterly ridiculous, notably that Mercedes episode which completely ignores George being disqualified, glosses over Hamiltons heroic Silverstone win whilst also staging weird animosity between Hamilton and the team.  \n\nAs Charles said, they are the Kardashians of Formula 1.', ""I definitely feel like it's got a bit worse. The first seasons had some weird bits but felt like you learned something. Current seasons have bits that seem pretty scripted or reenactments or stuff that would never be on camera. Also Will Buxton is so annoying!"", ""I've been a fan since I was a kid and have watched all 7 seasons, I found this year they were trying to make things way more dramatic than the first few seasons. On saying that I get desperate for anything F1 at this time of year so I'll probably never not watch it."", 'DtS has always been like this. You on the other hand have been on a journey.', 'It’s always been like that. The narrative of the first season with the Ricciardo vs Verstappen thing was cringey. Fake narratives with random footage from races.\n\nI get why Max stopped doing it. I stopped watching during season 4. A real documentary would be cool (especially with the access they have).']",300,234,0.91,300,221,221,300,234,0.91,300
