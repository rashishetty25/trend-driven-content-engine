In an interview with auto motor und sport, Flavio Briatore reveals why he came back, how he wants to apply the old success model to Alpine and what he understands by a good management style.

**You decided to make a comeback to Formula 1 at the age of 74. Why return to retirement?**

> Briatore: I was never really away. In the meantime, I was an ambassador for the sport for Stefano Domenicali and worked with him on new races and marketing opportunities. And as Fernando Alonso's manager, I was always in contact with the scene. But I was mainly involved in setting up my restaurant chain. I started from scratch. We are now one of the largest groups in the luxury segment worldwide and employ 1,200 people. It pretty much runs itself by now. There wasn't much left for me to do. My son moved from Monte Carlo to Geneva because he is studying there. It was getting a bit lonely at home and I was bored. And Formula 1 never really lets you go. I admit, I missed it. And then I had a conversation with Luca de Meo. I've known him for ages. I told him that it was sad to see a former world champion team in this state.

**And how did it become a job?**

> Briatore: In the beginning, the idea was to help a little. I wasn't sure because so much has changed in Formula 1. We talked about the last few years of Alpine in a very non-committal way. Losing two drivers like Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri in one summer was a bit of an inability. Fernando wanted to stay because the season before wasn't that bad. We wanted to sign the contract in Canada. Then Laurent Rossi suddenly disappeared. We could no longer contact him. That was the moment when I started talking to Lawrence Stroll from Aston Martin. We even had an offer from Williams. I said to them: get your shop in order first. In the end, we signed with Aston Martin because we couldn't get on with Alpine's management. The faults lay with the management. That's when I said to Luca: if I get full responsibility, I'll do it.

**You became world champion with Benetton during your career and made Renault world champion in the 2000s. Is the situation today comparable to back then?**

> Briatore: It is comparable to 2002. But we are in a better position with Alpine than we were with Renault back then. The team was in total disarray in 2002. Everyone was arguing with everyone else. With Luca, I now have the opportunity to do everything we want to do in the next three to five years. The first step was to get rid of our own engine. That means we're saying goodbye to something that only costs us money but brings us nothing. Mercedes will give us the best engine and the best gearbox in the business in 2026. If you want to win, 80 to 90 per cent of your components have to be the best. You don't need handicaps. In 2002, Renault had a very good engine. It was so good that we were even able to sell it to Red Bull later on. And the gearbox? It can't win you any races, it can only lose you some.

*How do you want to turn Alpine around?**

> Briatore: I have clear and simple management structures. We have appointed Oliver Oakes as team principal because he is young and motivated and has motorsport experience. Running a Formula 1 team is certainly different to being a Formula 2 team principal. But Ollie learns very quickly. He is a great choice.

**Why didn't you want to be team principal yourself?**

> Briatore: Why? I have been for long enough. I want to take care of the big picture and not be at the factory in Enstone every day. I represent our president Luca. I don't need a title to do that. Everyone knows that: I make the decisions. You need a team principal and a technical director to implement them. I have my old Benetton team in mind. There were three or four people running the place. I had less experience back then, but fortunately I had a good technical team around me with Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds. Now we have a good team under our Technical Director David Sanchez, a mix of people from the past and young engineers. We have to build the new Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds from that. In the meantime, everyone can see the light at the end of the tunnel. With the Mercedes engine, we have the basis to win. That is the mission. Not just driving around in circles.

**How do you intend to achieve this?**

> Briatore: You need the right people in the management positions. They can do what they want in their area as long as they deliver results. If not, that's where I come in. I am a democratic dictator. I trust people as long as they return the trust. If they are bad, I change them. Bad people infect everyone who works under them. They then say to themselves: why should I work for someone who is worse than me?

**They say that people make the difference. Adrian Newey was on the market. Why did he go to Aston Martin and not Alpine?**

> Briatore: You'll have to ask him that. Adrian is an artist. We're not ready for someone like him yet. To benefit from him, you have to have the right team around him. Maybe we'll be ready in two or three years. That's why I've never spoken to him seriously.

**Can the solutions that worked in the 2000s still be applied today?**

> Briatore: I think so. Successful models survive the test of time. As a manager, I have to make sure that everyone in the team understands what it's all about. Everyone must always have the goal in mind. The past is part of the present. That's why I had the world champion cars from 1995 and 2006 and all the world championship trophies placed in the entrance hall at Enstone and the previous year's car taken out. On Monday, our people come to the factory, see what this team has achieved and are prepared to work an extra three hours. When success comes, you no longer ask how high your personal commitment is. The difference today is that the teams have become much bigger and spend more money. You have to recognize the good people and let them grow. The size of the teams means that responsibility in the individual areas is spread over several shoulders.

**Isn't it harder to keep 800 people happy instead of 400?**

> Briatore: It all depends on the management staff. That's maybe 20 people. Just like in my restaurants, actually. We have 37 establishments worldwide. The product is different, but the system of creating a good product is the same as in Formula 1. We have to find the best people for all departments, in the technical office and production. The technical director has the task of putting it all together and overseeing the final product. I see a lot of progress here. The mood and motivation are much better today than they were five months ago. You only have to look at the faces of the people in the factory. There is a completely different spirit than when I started. You motivate employees with two things: Money and success.

**How much time do you devote to Formula 1?**

> Briatore: About 60 percent. I will be at Enstone three days a week in the winter. That's enough. I'm not going there to show my face. Something has to come out of it. I meet with our department heads there and find out whether the targets are being met. In the end, I'm only responsible to Luca de Meo. I owe him success. And we are lucky with him. He is a fan of motorsport. He wants to win. Even more so than Louis Schweitzer and Carlos Ghosn, with whom I had dealings in the past.","['>Flavio Briatore: ""I am a democratic dictator.""\n\nIn that case, I\'ll look forward to his episodes on *Behind the Bastards*.', ""MBS: And I'm an authoritarian dictator!"", 'https://preview.redd.it/ag2xv8f9qe7e1.jpeg?width=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edda0fd3d031224c0f3f306151c0b2b15fe73ae4', 'This guy should be far away from the sport but the world we live in money talks and criminals walk.  Utterly disgusting tbh', ""Part 2:\n\n**Unlike in the past, we now have a budget cap. Is the price right and is the system fair?**\n\n> Briatore: The name budget cap sounds very good. The reality is different. If you want to do it right, the driver has to be included in the budget. And also expensive engineers. Adrian Newey is as expensive as a driver. That's a big cost factor. It makes no sense to take him out. So the rich teams will always have an advantage because they can afford the expensive drivers or engineers and don't have to suffer in other areas. If the driver were included, it would be a fair system. Then you can decide: Do I prefer to spend my money on the driver or the car?\n\n**You used to preach efficiency with Renault and criticized when teams had over 500 people. Now we're at 800 to 1,000, what do you think?**\n\n> Briatore: That's completely crazy. Why do we race? To entertain the spectators. The spectator doesn't care how many people work for the teams. The car doesn't look any different to them if 300 instead of 2,000 people are working on it. And if the gearbox was the same for everyone, nobody would notice. People don't care whether it has five or eight gears. It doesn't make the car any faster. It only causes costs. How many cylinders does the engine have? It doesn't matter, the main thing is that it makes noise for the local people. You can't even hear that on the TV. You only notice the engine when it breaks down. Just like it still happens to us. Then everyone talks about the engine. We'd be better off investing our money in the show. We need a battle of the gladiators and not an arms race of components that make no difference.\n\n**Don't think Alpine will lose its identity with a Mercedes engine. The French have always been proud of their products?**\n\n> Briatore: The French want to win. We don't win with our engine. It's as simple as that. If we want to win, we have to give up the areas in which we are not competitive. That's one less problem for us to worry about in the future. Let's focus on the car. McLaren becomes world champion with a Mercedes engine. How many times have you read or heard about McLaren-Mercedes becoming world champions? Never. Haas is Haas and not Haas-Ferrari.\n\n**Can you guarantee that the move to a customer engine is not the first step towards selling the team?**\n\n> Briatore: I don't understand this speculation. Since I joined Renault, the same questions have always been asked. When we won the world championship title in 2005 and 2006, I was asked whether Renault wanted to stay in Formula 1. The truth is: I always got what I needed for the job from Renault. They appreciate that I am careful with their money. I believe in efficiency. That's why I'm now saving money everywhere in the areas that don't make my car faster. I don't think about what I'll be doing in five, ten or 20 years' time. I decide what's important now.\n\n**How long did it take you to figure out where Alpine was and what was needed to get back to winning ways?**\n\n> Briatore: It didn't take a genius to figure out that Alpine was down. When I came on board, the team had two points on the board. What is needed? I think we have a recipe for winning with 30 to 40 percent less money than the others. At Benetton it was 50 percent less. I know this team. That's why I came back. I wouldn't have done it with anyone else.\n\n**Where will Alpine be at the end of the season?**\n\n> Briatore: We have taken a big step forward and improved to the same level as Haas and Toro Rosso. But that was already a step for 2025. It wouldn't have been worth the effort for a few races in 2024. We had actually already ticked off that year. That's why I told the engineers: we'll only bring the upgrade if it will help us next year.\n\n**They wanted Carlos Sainz. He signed with Williams. What went wrong there?**\n\n> Briatore: I spoke to Sainz. He was interesting for us, but only for four years. It makes no sense to take a driver like Carlos for one or two years. Either he believes in our program or he doesn't. I don't need a driver who costs me a lot of money and is looking to go to another team when the opportunity arises.\n\n**You are also interested in Franco Colapinto. Why is that? You already have a young driver in Jack Doohan.**\n\n> Briatore: I'm interested in any driver who is fast. Colapinto surprised everyone. But we have contracts with Gasly, Doohan and Aron for next season. If there was an opportunity to get Colapinto for 2026, you have to think about it. Nevertheless, you always have to be careful when assessing drivers. In this sport, you quickly get hyped up after a good race. Then the price rises and suddenly we're talking about 20 or 30 million dollars. The choice today is much greater than it used to be. Today, there are six to seven promising drivers in Formula 2 and Formula 3. We want to concentrate on the good ones in our academy and no longer run around with a watering can. It will probably come down to three drivers. Aron, Mini and Martins.\n\n**We have five rookies at the start next year. One at Alpine. Has time run out for the veterans?**\n\n> Briatore: It is now time for a generation change. Sainz is a very good driver. But when he was on the market, none of the top teams took him on. They prefer to go for young drivers. Toto Wolff on Antonelli, Christian Horner on Lawson. Young drivers are hungrier than someone who has a wife and two children and 30 or 40 million in the bank. Even Enzo Ferrari said that drivers slow down when they have children. I think the rise of Piastri has made people think. Bearman jumps into a Ferrari overnight and drives a great race. The young drivers are much better trained. And the competitive pressure is higher. In Formula 2, you're in first place today and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton or Rosberg used to win 70 percent of all races. When Schumacher came to us, he still lacked experience. We first sent Fernando to Minardi. Verstappen didn't even have a driver's license when he started at Toro Rosso.\n\n**How long can Fernando Alonso survive in this environment?**\n\n> Briatore: Fernando is the exception. I've been his manager for 22 years. He has money, but no children. And he is still hungry. If he finishes 14th, he wants to be 13th. Someone else his age would do his job by the book if it's only about 14th place. There are now two feelings in my chest. On the one hand, I wish Fernando could get off to another flying start with Adrian Newey at Aston Martin in 2026, but on the other hand, he's racing against Alpine. But still, would a World Championship title as a farewell be a brilliant story?\n\n**Where should Alpine finish next year, where in 2026 and 2027?**\n\n> Briatore: Alpine must always be in the top 6 next year. Maybe a podium every now and then. We have to improve our car to achieve this. That should be possible. Aerodynamically, we have much more leeway than Ferrari or McLaren. In 2026, we want to be on the podium in 50 percent of all races. Then you automatically win one or two races. In 2027, we have to be in a position to compete for the title."", ""Didn't he get a life-ban for crashgate Singapore 2008?

The firm will invest 400 million euros - over these ten years - in luxury services and exclusive experiences, in addition to the construction, assembly, operation and marketing of these areas.\n\nThe Swiss company Match Hospitality, belonging to the Byrom group, has been selected to economically exploit the Spanish Formula 1 Grand Prix, which will be held in Madrid from 2026, imposing itself against competitors such as Legends and the Atlético de Madrid football club.\n\nThe award of the operation is an important step forward in the organization of the event that, let us remember, will extend until the year 2035. The winning firm will invest 400 million euros in the development of the project and will join forces with IFEMA Madrid to get the most out of the VIP and Hospitality areas.\n\nThe agreement with Match Hospitality contemplates a progressive economic injection during the ten years that the contract lasts. These resources will be focused exclusively on luxury services, such as hospitality programs and VIP tickets, leaving out standard tickets for amateurs.\n\nThe goal is to transform the Spanish Grand Prix into a complete experience, following the model of other high-caliber events such as the Miami Grand Prix or Las Vegas, where the car competition is complemented by musical events and cultural activities that extend for a whole week.\n\nIFEMA Madrid, promoter of the event, led the bidding process with three internationally renowned participants. Legends, a company associated with Real Madrid, and Neptuno VIP Events, linked to Atlético de Madrid, presented solid proposals, but Match Hospitality stood out for its financial capacity and experience in high-level sporting events. The Swiss firm has an impressive record, having managed services in the World Cups of South Africa, Brazil, Russia and Qatar, in addition to Formula 1 and MotoGP events such as the British Grand Prix of both disciplines.\n\nDespite the intensity of the negotiations, the financial and strategic advantages of Match Hospitality tilted the scales. Atlético de Madrid’s proposal included initiatives such as the total transfer of a parking lot and synergies with its sports city project, while Legends stood out for its experience in projects linked to Real Madrid. However, IFEMA prioritized investment capacity and direct experience in Formula 1 as key factors for its decision.\n\nThis strategy reinforces the commitment of the Community and the City of Madrid to organize an economically sustainable and internationally attractive event. Representatives of IFEMA, who recently visited the paddock of Abu Dhabi during the last event of the season, are already finalizing the details of this ambitious Spanish Grand Prix in Madrid.

We’ve all watched ‘Drive to survive’ and some of us enjoy a good old documentary….

I was 9 when I first saw F1 and being a Brit I was drawn in by the emotions of a win by a British driver at a time when so many drivers from other nations were so strong and capable. Statistics said it had been 10 years since our last British champion so I was hopeful that I could see a new winner soon.

As a child and still to this day, ‘Our Nige’ is still my all time favourite. 

This documentary brought all my emotions back, feels very similar to the day I heard ‘is that Glock?’

Put it on your watch later list and give it a go. Personally, it brought a few tears to my eyes…

1hgpmlr,My 2025 F1 Prediction,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hgpmlr/my_2025_f1_prediction/,2024-12-18, Discussion,"My prediction for the 2025 F1 Season is as follows:
Constructors: McLaren  
World drivers championship: Lewis Hamilton 
Williams: becomes a mid team with the addition of Sainz. 

I think McLaren is just on fire right now and I think Oscar and Lando make a very good and consistent dual threat. I do however think it will be closely battled with Ferrari again. 

I think Lewis Hamilton was just put in a great position to break his tie with Schumacher and for this 1 reason alone I refuse to count him out while having 1 of the 4 best seats. I do think it will be a battle with Lando especially if Lando improves his starts and consistency, but Lewis has the experience and the real opportunity to accomplish a championship with his dream constructor it would be dumb to count him out.

As for my opinion on Max I think he will be in the top 3 drivers I just don’t think he will be able to top Lando and Lewis next season for 1 he will be a new dad and will likely be distracted a bit with that, and I think Red Bull is a mediocre car.

What’s your thoughts on my predictions agree or disagree? And why?
","['Momentum seems to be with Ferrari and McLaren but I think Hamilton will split more points with Leclerc than Norris will with Piastri.\n\nI also think Red Bull aren’t as far out of it as people think. And to the same point, won’t split points with Lawson at all.\n\nI think it will be Norris for WDC unless one of the Ferrari’s becomes the number one driver early on.\n\nThen Ferrari for WCC', ""I can see a three way fight between Verstappen, Leclerc and Norris with two of those splitting away for a direct title fight towards the end. Hamilton, Piastri and Russell will probably fight just behind them. Antonelli and Checo/Liam/Yuki will be at the bottom of the top 8. \n\nConstructors will be a fight between McLaren and Ferrari. I can't see Mercedes being as fast as the others in front and while I can see the second Red Bull driver improving on Checo's points tally from this season, Max will definitely have a lot more work to do at the front so expecting a slight drop in points meaning Red Bull won't have quite enough to fight with McLaren and Ferrari.\n\nMidfield will be insanely competitive and unpredictable, especially with the amount of driver lineup changes. I expect Alonso, Gasly and Sainz to fight for points fairly regularly. \n\nAll in all, can't wait for next year. Things I would love to see are Hamilton getting a win in red, Sainz getting Williams back on the podium and a potential new winner in Antonelli or Liam/Yuki (if they get a Red Bull seat)."", 'Hard to tell with Lewis. Leclerc is operating at an extremely high level and knows how to get the most out of a Ferrari F1 car better than anyone alive. You can’t replace having 6 years in the same seat. Not only that, but he’s just about in his prime, while Lewis is on the downward side of his career.\n\nSo I’ll take Ferrari for WCC.\n\nWDC is tough. I don’t expect Max to have competition in the other garage so I could see him winning #5 if the car is there. Maybe Norris rocks up to the party with some fight next year. Who knows. The Ferrari drivers will take too many points from each other to win. \n\nWilliams might be better than people expect. Pat Fry and Matt Harman are no slouches and this will be the first car they’ve actually had a significant hand in. Their technical team is solid. With the best driver lineup in the midfield, it would not surprise me if Williams was P5-P6 next year, but only if they have a car to fight from Day 1 and develop at least semi-frequently.', 'I think it’s bold to predict that Lewis will be better than Charles, let alone better than Max and Lando', 'While I appreciate your fortitude to make this public, you are quite wrong. \n\nLEC is going to smoke HAM just like he smoked VET in his first and second years in the Ferrari.  \n\nMcLaren will be in the mix for WCC but without the questionable rear flexi wing, I would not assume they will be dominant.', 'My pessimistic prediction is that the relative parity between constructors won’t carry over. Pretty much all teams have made comments about knowing where their design errors lie and waiting for the winter break to implement costly rebuilds. Undoubtedly some of them will get it right and some of them won’t. Consequently there’s a good chance at least one team will be clear fastest at the beginning of the next season.\xa0\n\nNow I do hope this turns out to be wrong. The way this season turned out has me hopeful that the cost cap does indeed work and we’ll see more parity or at least teams being able to to catch up\xa0quickly. In the end if being a longtime F1 fan has taught me anything then that you really can’t reliably predict how a season will turn out. For all I know fucking Mercedes will rock up with a working no-sidepod concept and Russell cruises to the WDC.\xa0', 'I honestly think Leclerc beats Hamilton but Norris is gonna win the WDC comfortably…', ""Max as WDC is the prediction until it become obvious he won't be.\n\nWCC is another story. That could be a royal rumble."", ""> I think it will be Norris for WDC unless one of the Ferrari’s becomes the number one driver early on.\n\nEven if they decide who is #1 I don't see the drivers respecting that. If Leclerc loses to Hamilton he is finished, there is no recovering from that. And Hamilton is fighting for his legacy. I am sure he doesn't want to leave F1 defeated by his team mate and in a supporting driver role."", ""I think for Ferrari's sake they're gonna have to establish the Merc method when it comes to WDC (let them race until one is clearly ahead and has the greater chance of winning the championship unless of course they are both close the whole time).\n\nUnless Ferrari completely fumble their car I'm in agreement with you about WCC, it's their's.""]",0,40,0.24,0,33,33,0,6,0.06999999999999998,0
1hge2iy,How important is it to have an F1 race in Africa and is it worth it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hge2iy/how_important_is_it_to_have_an_f1_race_in_africa/,2024-12-17, Discussion,"People for long have complained that a world championship doesn’t visit the second largest continent on the world. However, I don’t see how simply adding one race to this continent helps almost anything except for checking Africa off the list. I don’t think I need to say how vastly different every region of Africa is and when you look at the most likely candidates in my opinion this divide is clearly shown.

Obviously South Africa has always been the frontrunner since Kyalami used to host F1 but not only does the country seem unstable at times (I haven’t kept up but I remember protests at one point) but South Africa is very different to most countries. Then you have Rwanda who seem to be leading the race now and seem to be the most economically stable country in Africa and most realistic host. Watching football I’ve seen their advertising all over Arsenal and it seems they’re going a step further now but once again Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia. And the final option which is by far the least realistic but it’s just the reality of having a race in this continent would be an Egyptian GP but as you can imagine the divide is biggest at the North of Africa and it would be seen as another desert race. I only include it because it’s the most well known African country and has a history vastly greater than any desert race we currently have. Beyond these 3 options I can’t think of anything else, maybe a Moroccan GP since they seem to be hosting the WC with Spain and Portugal and at the most extreme push Senegal for being the closest possible option West Africa has.

 I think a lot of people have this idea that we can just start having races anywhere in Africa to represent the continent but it is beyond unrealistic to start hosting races in West Africa, East Africa and most of North Africa so why force one race to tick the continent off when it’s not really proper representation. I feel like only die hard Kyalami fans would be pushing for it otherwise there is little interest. Personally, I’d rather countries focus their efforts towards their people rather than paying ridiculous money to host an F1 event which is why I kept the options as realistic as possible. So for me it’s not worth forcing an F1 race here where one race can’t possibly please even a fifth of the continent (it’s not as simple as hosting Melbourne for Australia) and the options that exist mostly don’t exist apart from Kyalami yet the most realistic option still will be a soulless Rwandan GP. ","[""Personally I think that races should be awarded based on how much the host country/city can actually viably support the race and how many actual fans from the locality will get to see the race in person, as well as the general appeal of the race to the existing F1 fan base.\n\nMaybe hosting a race in Africa could bring in a large fan base, but if the race isn't likely to be run for more than a couple years and they stop because of the expense, then it's probably not a great idea to host a race there.\n\nAlso, with 24 races,  we are approaching the point at which we don't really have time for more races.

They should just add a race and see how popular it is. Popularity will determine if they add more races to the area.\n\nI would remind you that there is only one race in South America, and five in North America. (Two races in South America if we're going by Marko's reckoning.)\n\n>Rwanda to me is like having the Singapore GP represent all of Asia.\n\nOmg who cares about 'representing all of Asia/Africa'?
