However, the ultimate goal never materialized with the Prancing Horse.\n\nDespite never having won the World Championship with Ferrari, the Heppenheim native still doesn't regret his move to the Maranello team. “I don’t regret that step itself,” the 38-year-old said on the ORF Sport am Sonntag podcast. “I think it gave me a lot in that sense, in terms of experience and understanding of what I had back at Red Bull at the time.”\n\nHowever, the way he left Red Bull wasn’t entirely ideal. “I think the human element got a bit lost,” Vettel admits, pointing to the confidentiality of his Ferrari contract as the main reason.\n\nSince “he stuck too closely to certain agreements,” the transition from Red Bull to Ferrari ended up being a bit abrupt. Today, he would handle it differently. “But overall, I had a great time and I still have a fantastic relationship with everyone I worked with back then.”\n\n“I think it would’ve been more dignified to talk about it openly and maybe not stick so strictly to that clause,” the four-time world champion admits in hindsight. His time at Ferrari was certainly enjoyable, he says, but it couldn’t surpass the winning era at Red Bull.\n\n“The people and the moments we shared, and how much it bonded us”—Vettel says, suggesting he never experienced anything quite like it again. “Even though I later spent a really good time at Ferrari, a big part of me still identifies with Red Bull and Red Bull Racing.”"", 'Horner and Marko out and having Mekies and Seb in, would be so wholesome for RedBull ngl.', 'The opposite would have been weird', 'Mateschitz was quite furious with Vettel because of the way he had left RBR.', ""It's all about performances lol.""]",27,6,0.92,27,5,5,27,6,0.92,27
1m1863b,"Toyota: Strong synergy with Haas, signs of growing interest in F1?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m1863b/toyota_strong_synergy_with_haas_signs_of_growing/,2025-07-16, News,,"['Translation:\n\nUntil last season, the idea of organizing a test during the championship had always been considered ""too much"" for the small Haas. Significant expenses, difficult to sustain for a team that only finished 12 points in the 2023 constructors\' championship. Then came the rebirth. Today, the American team – which nevertheless had to abandon its NASCAR program last year – has already collected 29 championship points but, above all, continues its important partnership with Toyota . And it is precisely thanks to the bond with the Japanese manufacturer that the team founded by Gene Haas will be driving at Fuji on August 6-7 as part of a new TPC test .\n\nTHE DRIVERS ON THE TRACK AND TOYOTA\'S INFLUENCE: HERE\'S WHO WILL BE THERE\n\nThe star of the show on the track – as per the regulations – will be the 2023 single-seater, the VF-23, which will be entrusted to reserve driver Ryo Hirakawa and reigning Super Formula and Super GT championship champion Sho Tsuboi , making his debut at the wheel of an F1 car. The choice of two Japanese drivers mirrors that made in the January tests at Jerez and the tests organized in June at Paul Ricard, with Ritomo Miyata and Kamui Kobayashi, respectively, taking the lead. In this sense, Toyota\'s influence in the choice of the drivers involved is evident , with the Japanese manufacturer having never hidden its desire to help the Japanese drivers gain greater experience in Formula One.\n\nTHE RETURN TO FUJI AND TOYOTA\'S GOALS:\n\nTo celebrate the return of Formula One to Fuji Speedway – a venue first visited in 2008 – Toyota, the facility\'s owner, has chosen to allow public access to the two-day test, also providing its own technicians on the track. Masaya Kaji, Director of TGR Global Motorsport , explained that the technical partnership between Haas and Toyota is based on improving three pillars: "" people, operations, and product ."" "" In this sense ,"" Kaji added, "" these TPC tests are part of our people efforts , as we will focus on human resource development. I believe that Sho [Tsuboi], a former Super Formula champion, will not only contribute to the development of his skills, but will also provide great motivation for the other TGR drivers. In addition, mechanics and engineers from Toyota Motor Corporation will be present, making this an invaluable opportunity for them as well . Experiencing first-hand the technologies and skills required on the world\'s highest stage, F1, will certainly be an important experience for their growth .""\n\nA test, therefore, that sees a strong commitment from Toyota, which is in some way returning ""actively"" to the world of F1. And who knows, it could also be a preparation for the future. The Japanese group is still involved in the WEC world, but for months there have been rumors and hypotheses of a possible farewell to the world of endurance , at least temporarily, pending new regulations or a more ambitious project that would revolutionize the current car, which is now rather dated. And it is not out of the question that Toyota is considering a return to the world of F1 as well. At the moment there is no confirmation , but behind the scenes things are moving between the WEC and other commitments that suggest some movement is afoot, but we will have to see what it will lead to. In the meantime, however, in what would be a simple partnership, we see a rather active commitment from Toyota , in terms of drivers, engineers and more.\n\nRecently in the Austrian paddock, Andrea De Zordo, Haas Technical Director, spoke about another important contribution the Japanese manufacturer will have for Haas. “ The relationship with Toyota currently focuses mainly on TPC testing and the development of our own simulator . We don\'t have one at the moment, and it will be important for us in preparing for the races. Arriving with good preparation on the simulator would allow us to start the weekends better and get better use of the driver.” According to the Italian engineer, one of the reasons Haas is lagging behind the others is the delay in arriving on track. “ By starting the weekend better, the driver is freer to focus on building confidence or working on balance details. And the same goes for updates. Having a simulator where we can work would be a great thing for Haas .” An advantage that De Zordo defines as even more significant with a view to 2026 and the next-generation cars.\n\nA positive and stimulating collaboration, which Haas Team Principal Ayao Komatsu also spoke about. “ I am very excited that in our first season running a TPC program, we will be able to run for two days at Fuji Speedway in Japan ,” Komatsu explained. “ The importance of racing our car at Toyota’s home circuit, where we first announced our partnership with Toyota Gazoo Racing last October, is truly special . ” Looking back at the test\'s protagonists, the team principal explained: “ Giving Sho Tsuboi his first time in a Formula 1 car is equally satisfying , considering his reputation as a multiple champion. We obviously already know Ryo\'s talent and we look forward to him continuing to make his contribution to our program. The fact that we will be using the VF-23 and that the test is open to fans is also great . We know the passion Japanese fans have for Formula 1, so to have a second test in the country this year, after the Japanese Grand Prix in April, is fantastic.”', 'I kinda like the current arrangement Haas has (ha) where they essentially have both Toyota and Ferrari co-parenting.']",5,2,0.86,5,2,2,5,2,0.86,5

This is just plain wrong. Prost was 16 points ahead of Senna going into Suzuka and back then the point system was:
- 1st - 9 points
- 2nd - 6 points
- 3rd - 4 points
- 4th - 3 points
- 5th - 2 points
- 6th - 1 point
Senna winning the final two races doesn't guarantee anything. In Suzuka Prost could have let Senna pass him and then finish 4th or better and still win the championship there and then. The crash was absolutely pointless, just unnecessary stubbornness to not let the other guy pass by any means necessary.","['You’re failing to take into account that only the best 11 results counted.\n\nProst’s best eleven results were all wins or second except for one third place. So if Senna wins both races with Prost second, he only gains two points by switching out a third place for a second. Meanwhile, Senna gets eighteen points for two wins (which would take him only up to nine points finishes, so they would all count). At that point, Senna and Prost are even on points, Senna wins on countback with more wins.\n\nNot pointless.', ""Not quiet. In '89 only the best 11 results counted towards the championship. Prost already had 11 scores but Senna only had 9. Prost would have had to finish second (dropping his third from Spain) to increase his total by two points.
