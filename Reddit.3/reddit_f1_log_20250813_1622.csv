1mp083y,Explained: How the FIA plans to avoid a repeat of Mercedes' 2014 scenario in F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mp083y/explained_how_the_fia_plans_to_avoid_a_repeat_of/,2025-08-13, Technical,,"['""There is no amount of money or special regulation that can overturn the disadvantage of incompetence.""\n\n-Ron Dennis', ""If there's one constant in F1, it's that a team will always find a way to dominate. F1 is defined by eras of pure dominance."", ""I dislike the desire to keep the engines so similar. The PU is just as big a part of a car's performance as the aero, but only one gets a push to keep equal.  \n  \nPersonally, I'd just figure out a way to roll engine development into the cost cap and variable testing restrictions, then let teams prioritize one vs the other.

They could just hand them lower performance versions in order to avoid competition. This is where the whole ""you cant win unless you\'re a works team"" mentality came from \n\nThese days, its required for Manufacturers to give identical engines to their customers \n\nSo let\'s say Mercedes nails the engines again, McLaren, Williams and Alpine will all equally benefit from it', ""A team can still dominate; how many resources this year and last have gone towards this? For some teams, a lot more than in 2013. What Mercedes accomplished is still marvelous, but it's like tanking in any NA sports league to get a high draft pick, draft a player that'll be a corner stone for a title contending team for the next generation. But at the end of the day, if you've got a problem, fix your f$\\*()#\\* car."", 'I really have a feeling the 2026 rules will fail miserably and the entire fan base they have build up over the years will quickly dissappear...

Also, the strat made him lose positions in races like Miami and Silverstone.\n\nAdditionaly, he has been in the group of most consistent qualifyers on the grid. And you would ask why do I say that? He is the only driver in the entire grid to have outqualified Stroll during the last 26 races. In this time, Stroll outqualified the following drivers:\n\n- Stroll 0-26: ALO\n- Stroll 1-25: NOR, PIA, RUS\n- Stroll 2-24: MAX, LEC\n- Stroll 5-21: ALB\n- Stroll 6-20: HAM\n\nI know sometimes it's a matter of luck, but I think it is representative when he is doing that in a much slower car than the top dogs.

I personally think its the 2nd best car in general, with Antonelli massively underperforming and Russell getting out what you'd expect, solid but not spectacular results, but he's also doing it without any sort of pressure on him, he's got a nobody team mate and any time he underperforms but still beats Antonelli (Saudi or Suzuka for instance) fans can blame the car. \n\nI personally think its Verstappen or Leclerc as the best drivers, maybe slightly towards Leclerc because other than Silverstone, he's consistently ahead of his highly rated team mate and challenging for podiums in arguably the 4th best car.""]",25,50,0.73,25,48,48,11,17,-0.020000000000000018,11
