Hulkenberg completely lost the rear on seemingly normal acceleration on the exit of T3/4, having to save multiple severe oversteer moments that put him into the gravel, damaging his floor and effectively ending his race. Later on in the lap, Bortoleto was in a battle with Bearman, and turned in relatively normally into T8 and instantly lost the rear in a basically unsavable moment that put him into the gravel, taking him out of race contention as well.

Both of these moments can be viewed here:¬†[https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z\_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68](https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68)

If one of these drivers had experienced this alone, it would be easy to put it down to driver error. However, the appearance of a similar issue on both cars in the first lap in seemingly innocuous moments when the drivers weren't even trying to make a move, leads me to believe that there was potentially some sort of issue on the car, or more specifically, the tyre preparation plan that the team had in place during the formation lap (ie number of burnouts, target tyre temp). It seems likely that the team made a miscalculation that resulted in the rear tyres being out of the window on both cars to start the race.

1jkoyvo,"OPINION: The Red Bull RB21 Is Not a Bad Car, but a Top Car Struggling with Incapable Drivers",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jkoyvo/opinion_the_red_bull_rb21_is_not_a_bad_car_but_a/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"Recently, given Checo performances and the surprising Lawson results, I have seen a lot (like, A LOT) of comments on social networks and here, with the idea that the RBR RB21 is just ""a shit car"", that needs fixing or that Max is ""overdriving it"" so he, overachieving, just helped to hide the car problems.

IMO, this is just a not right conclusion or even realistic. Why?

* No driver can ""overdrive"" a car, only try to extract up to 100% of its possible performance. That's just as easy as that. When Max puts the car P2 in Australia, it's because the car allows for it and can be as fast as that or even more (who knows the ""physical limit"" in perfect conditions over a race length).
* Teams, in theory, prioritise their car design to be the fastest possible (yeah, shocking). Then, they try to make them more driveable or of their driver(s) liking, and start to get driver output to either help him extract more % of the available theorical performance, or find more speed. Sometimes, they have to concede and accept theorical slower setups/designs because the driver can work faster with it (better to ""extract"" 90% of performance of a top-2 car, than 60% performance of a top-1 car - just like when Checo asked to drive a older spec to be faster).
* The car has been able to end P2 in Australia (+0.895s), qualy P4 in China, P3 in Sprint, and end up P4 in the race.
* Meanwhile, Lawson ended up DNF, P20, P14 and P12.

What's clear, is that the 2¬∫ seat problem, isn't a car problem, but a driver skill issue. Yes, maybe Red Bull pressured a lot their drivers and 2 races are not the best number of sessions to value a development, but still, is not the car problem.

It's about how much % of performance available can the driver use and profit from.

And yeah, the car can be difficult to drive, but then, again, is a driver issue. If the driver can't extract at their current design the full potential of the car, and they need to change it, then it's on them to adapt the car to their driver capabilities and likings because the driver needs it, is not about the car being bad from the start.

Also, IMO, we can't be sure about ""how bad"" the situation is. The pool of drivers with experience in this iteration of RBR cars, in the current regs, is literally just composed of Checo and Lawson for 2 races (not accounting for the private 1-day practice sessions RBR hold with other drivers, of course). People overreacting like ""wow, nobody can do it, only Max, this is crazy"" are just blowing this problem out of proportions.

Not to speak about how Checo had brilliant times in his peak at RBR (considering he's not a ""once in a generation"" driver in the slightest), the nosedive came mainly after some iterations and changes to the development path of the car, making him to lose the touch of the car.

So, IDK what do you think, but I feel a big chunk of fans are just overblowing all this and coming to conclusions that are just not true or even nonsense.

Also, I hope Tsunoda can do a good job all things considered (lack of ""normal"" preparations, huge pressure, all eyes on him, yadda yadda yadda), but if he fails, people are going to be full crazy about this I feel lol.","[""If a car can only deliver in the hands of a Verstappen/Hamilton/Schumacher tier talent, then that car is a liability.   Especially if the car is no longer capable of winning even for that driver and he starts looking at all those cars in front of him that he could be driving instead.  It's already cost RBR a constructor's championship last year - if Max leaves, they are in serious trouble."", 'that\'s a lot of text to pretty much say ""i think the last 2nd rb drivers were bad"" based on no evidence other than vibes. Which is fine, you are allowed that opinion, but i doubt people care how you feel.', 'No one can outdrive the theoretical limits of the car, but drivability can make a big difference in how close to the limits any particular driver can take the car. A car with an excellent theoretical limit that no one can drive anywhere close to that limit is a bad car, period.\n\nIt also shouldn‚Äôt be controversial that Verstappen is able to extract more out of extremely sensitive cars than his teammates. That isn‚Äôt some Reddit speculation; it has been repeatedly claimed by a number of people with first-hand knowledge. Moreover, Perez was a very solid driver before joining RB, and Albon and Gasly have held their own after leaving it; I think ‚Äúaverage drivers struggle with RB‚Äôs cars of this era‚Äù is more plausible than ‚Äúall of Verstappen‚Äôs teammates since Ricciardo are slow in any car‚Äù.', 'Your reasoning has two primary faults.\n\n1-If you have to be a Max level driver to get a car to work, it\'s so difficult it\'s essentially a shit car no matter how fast it could be.     \nEvery team on the grid could make an amazingly fast car that no human being on earth could drive, a car only a computer could drive is not nearly as difficult as what they actually have to do.   \n\nMaking it drivable for an actual human being is part of the challenge.\n\n2-Yes you can argue that ""max gets 100% out of the car"", but how many of the other drivers on the grid are getting 100% out of their cars?     \nHe\'s very easily arguably the best driver currently on the grid. The list of drivers you can argue were at his level even historically is very very short.   \n\nSo okay, let\'s say ""the car is capable of p2 if Max gets 100% out of it"".     \nSure, but if Lando is getting p1 getting 95% out of the McLaren, and Charles can be right behind Max while he\'s only getting 90% out of the Ferrari...    \n\nOr look at qualifying in China, Hadjar was 2 tenths off Max.     \nIs he getting 100% out of the Racing Bull? \n\nIf Max has to get 100% out of his car just to hang on to others who definitely are not getting 100% out of theirs, what happens if they can find an extra percentage or two?', 'A car is definitely bad if only the greatest drivers can drive it', 'The only reason max put that car second in Australia was cause Piastri went through the grass.

Max is the best driver on the grid currently, he says the car is shit and if you watch onboards, he‚Äôs working a lot harder in the cockpit than the cars he‚Äôs racing\n\nLawson can‚Äôt extract the performance of the car cause even Max is struggling to drive it‚Ä¶ and when theres a second between 1st and 20th in qualy, it means you‚Äôre last if you drive without experience in a hard to drive car\n\nAdapting to a car takes time‚Ä¶ even for Hamilton who needed a weekend and for Sainz who isn‚Äôt happy yet‚Ä¶ so thats especially true for a rookie. \n\nOn testing in older cars, Lawson came really close to Maxs times‚Ä¶ so its not like Lawson can‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ he just hasn‚Äôt been able to show it in this car. \n\nDemoting a driver after 2 races, especially a young and inexperienced driver who has so much potential to learn still (perez obviously wasn‚Äôt a young and inexperienced driver, not even in a redbull as he drove it for 4 years)‚Ä¶ is just horrible and not how you treat drivers', 'Albon couldn‚Äôt get near Max and he‚Äôs beaten every teammate he‚Äôs had since, including beating Latifi by a much wider margin than George was capable of and currently holding Sainz at bay\n\nGasly couldn‚Äôt hold a candle to Max and he‚Äôs gone on to be a race winner and beaten all of his other teammates. \n\nPerez was a proven race winner who always performed and got the best out of every car he had, but was miles off Max‚Äôs pace\n\nLawson had potential and just a few months ago everyone was screaming that he should be in the car and criticising Red Bull for not sacking Perez mid season and bringing him in, only for Max to leave him for dust once he got the chance. \n\nBut yes, clearly there is nothing special about Max and it‚Äôs just all of these drivers are terrible and mysteriously stop being terrible whenever they drive any other car', 'üëç', 'https://preview.redd.it/c1yi1dx474re1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=120623d13ace3e35426b7b84bf27f689a47bfcf7']",0,93,0.17,0,87,87,0,7,0.0,0
