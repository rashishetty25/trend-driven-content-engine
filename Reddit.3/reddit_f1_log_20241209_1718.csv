1ha3cii,The statistic about Pierre Gasly finishing the season with no crash damage cost isn't quite right...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ha3cii/the_statistic_about_pierre_gasly_finishing_the/,2024-12-09, Featured,"Thought it was a bit strange that a [post on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h9ku0x/pierre_gasly_finishes_with_no_crash_damage_cost/) with upward of 20k upvotes, several media outlets. and [F1's official social](https://x.com/f1/status/1859527924946440328) media channels have talked about how Gasly is the only driver to not have cost his team any money in terms of damages, but this is not quite true. Seems like all of these posts go back to this one source on the r/formula1 subreddit, a post talking about the [World Destructors Championship](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gndkl5/world_destructors_championship_after_brazil_20/). But, examining the data points to some omissions and mistakes. To start off:

* Gasly did get[ floor damage in Suzuka](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/gasly-rues-costly-floor-damage-from-ocon-contact-in-f1-japanese-gp/10596991/), when he and Ocon came together on the first restart lap. Ironically enough, F1 themselves have a [interview pen video](https://www.formula1.com/en/video/gasly-damage-from-contact-with-ocon-meant-it-was-game-over-from-lap-1.1795661874949227703) of Gasly talking about said damage costing him about >30 points of downforce. We don't know if this floor was completely replaced or just fixed, but this alone makes it so that Gasly did cost his team some money in repairs.

* But if we ignore minor floor damage, Gasly did have a precautionary front wing change in Monaco after his clash with Ocon during lap 1, and there were some repairs ongoing to the front right side of his car. But, as there was no visible damage to the front wing or the front right side of the car, honestly this one shouldn't count.
* Finally, if we do ignore minor floor damage completely, there is one other driver with no damage sustained through the season: Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton did spin in Austin, but besides gravel rash on the underside of the car, the car itself was completely fine and nothing was replaced. His only other incident was in Austria lap 1 turn 1, when he was ushered wide by Sainz onto the sausage kerb on the exit of turn 1, which resulted in floor damage that cost him about 0.25s/lap. Lewis did say in the post-race interview that he felt that there was a [touch from Sainz on his sidepod](https://www.formula1.com/en/video/hamilton-reveals-he-had-damage-after-lap-1-clash-with-sainz-in-austria.1803300339355415341), but looking at the replays of the onboards, they never came close enough to touch. The original World Destructors Championship post also noted Hamilton got about 320k worth of damage in Austria, 225k worth of floor damage and presumably, 95k worth of sidepod damage (which is not true). The same post also ignored Gasly's floor damage in Japan for some reason.
* Over a full season, Bottas almost came close to then being technically the driver with the least damage with just 125k worth of damage according to the same post, but well, we all saw what happened in Abu Dhabi 2024.

(None of these damage estimates count reliability issues, which I think is completely fair).

I know it doesn't really matter, I mean it's just a random statistic, but feels odd for a post from Reddit to go mainstream and then end up back on Reddit, and for the said random statistic to still be wrong. Feels like journalists should be doing a bit more research before they publish things.

FYI: I could've missed damage for any of the drivers mentioned, so don't take me as gospel.","[""You are perfectly right. Every online F1 media has been taking Reddit's Destructor Championship as gospel. To make the matter worse, they don't even bother to mention the creator or the source.  \nAs its creator said many times, it is a fan created estimation, it lacks many data points and should not be taken for an ironclad statistic.\n\nBut because F1 media is lazy and unprofessional, it goes on and on."", 'Gasly floor was deemed irreparable as far as I remember the team had used spare floor until the upgrades\xa0', 'Good post, hopefully this makes it half as far as the original.

James Allison explained that Lewis went over some gravel that got ""ejected by the wheel like sort of a machine gun bullet, and it threw that gravel through the sidepod, damaged a bunch of the carbon bodywork there, hurt the leading edges of the floor a little bit. And it was costing upwards of .2 a second a lap [...]"".

Which drivers have you changed your opinion on after this season? Good, bad or otherwise?

For me

The Mclaren drivers- I expected Oscar to be closer to Lando this year but Lando has proven to be quicker than I thought and Oscar has not made the overall improvement I expected.

Yuki- I expected Yuki and Daniel to be close but Yuki has proven to be a much more rounded driver than I previously thought.

Colapinto- Never really seen or heard much of him,but despite some late crashes he showed some good pace out there this season



","[""Piastri - After last season, I thought he would be a lot closer to Norris but Norris had a consistent pace advantage the entire year. I feel he needs a big improvement next season in order to fight for WDC one day.\n\nHulk - I've always known Hulk is a good driver, but he put in some mighty performances this season once Haas upgraded their car to fight in the midfield.\n\nSainz - This has been his best season in F1 by far. Still lacks that extra something compared to the top tier, but he's still super quick and Williams are lucky to have him.\n\nBearman - I've been following him since F3 and have been a fan, but this season, his F1 races showed he is definitely F1 quality. He outqualified Hulk twice, beating him in Baku as well."", 'Hulk and really all of Haas.  Now that Guenther is gone,  they have really improved so much as a team.  I didn’t expect that at all.  And without Alpine master class in Brazil,  they had 6th!  \n\nI hope they can keep the momentum with Ocon and Ollie.', ""Yuki really impressed me with his growth on and off the track. Red Bull not giving him the second seat beside Max is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI think I've become a bigger fan of Hulk and KMag after this season. They were both so solid for Haas all season. Hopefully Nico gets a great car with Audi and Kevin carves out a successful career in whatever discipline he chooses next."", ""Leclerc - I did believe he was a very fast driver, but he stepped up quite a bit, especially with his race management. The engineer change seems to have helped him out a lot too. Now I believe he's a champion in waiting.\n\nPiastri - Peaked during the European leg but was disapponting after that. His qualifying is rough to watch compared to Norris. \n\nBottas - Thought he was washed last year when Zhou was close, but he did a better job this year regardless of the standings."", 'Charles Leclerc - he was the “fast but inconsistent” one for me, but this season he’s proven that he’s matured to a more rounded driver.', ""Oscar is my second favorite driver but hes been very disappointing this season. Outqualified 20-4 with one of those winnings being in Baku where Lando had to lift. 0 poles to Lando's 8 and made a lot of mistakes in both races and qualifying.

He hasn't had a horrible season but after 2 long seasons he hasnt really improved his baseline pace compared to lando which is notoriously something you either have or don't.

This rule, which was in place for most of F1's history (1950-1991), means that to count points towards the World Championship, you only count points from your 11 best results, leaving the rest as 0s on your tally. This created interesting scenarios where a driver might be driving 4th, but because all his best results were podiums, he would not gain any points and he was incentivized to go risk it for 3rd place.

  
The most famous case of this rule was probably 1988, Senna's first WDC, where Prost outscored the Brazilian handsomely (105 vs 94) but lost the championship (87 vs 90) when applying the 'best of 11 rule'.

  
I was curious to see how this rule would have impacted the 2000s championships, so I went ahead and calculated the points tally with this new system. Here are the most interesting outcomes.

  
NOTE: ""Best of 11"" was adjusted from time to time in F1 and it was based, naturally, on the number of total races. For example, in the 60, 70s they used 'best of 8' and 'best of 9'. The number of races has increased exponentially since then, especially in the 2010s, but for simplicity's and entertainment's sake, we will maintain the 11 threshold.

# 2008: Massa's lawsuit works out

Felipe's lawyers need to find out who was responsible for dropping the 'best of 11' rule.

# Bonus: 2009 goes to the wire

Button's 2009 title gets even more exciting, with him and Vettel tying on points, but Jenson winning on 6 race wins vs 4 for Sebastian.

and as you see all of the rookies coming next year (including this year’s f2 champion), besides kimi, are getting a bottom/midfield team. to be fair ive only really watched kimi in f2 this year bc im pretty sure he skipped f3, but can anyone give any insight into how good kimi is? additionally, i do remember a lot of people being upset that drivers like paul aron, zane maloney, and other reserve drivers weren’t being considered for seats given their driving experience or current form as an f2 rookie. so my question is, do all the teams see kimi as being on par with max’s junior career considering he’s getting a similar treatment or it toto just anxious about possibly losing out on generational talent again? in that same regard, was max only really seen as a “must get” talent to redbull? if anyone has any insight i would love to hear! 

**side note: but even max started in toro rosso which makes me even more interested in kimi’s positioning at mercedes so early in his career**","['There’s no one reason, but rather a combination of several factors:\n\nIf Mercedes could have placed Kimi in a second team (like Max at Toro Rosso or like they did with George at Williams) they probably would have. But Williams is more financially stable these days and sees more value in an established second driver than in getting some cash from Mercedes to fill a seat. \n \nThough Mercedes won’t admit it publicly, they’re far enough off the top teams right now that they’re unlikely to be fighting for anything next year. As that is the case, they have a “free” year to put Kimi in before the reg changes. \n\nThere is the Max comparison too. Toto wants his own Max. How close Max really was to joining Mercedes we’ll probably never know, but it was close enough for Toto to not want to miss out again. \n\nThere are very few, if any, options for an established driver to fill that seat on a one year or a 1+1 deal. Sainz probably wouldn’t have signed on for that. Guys like Bottas/KMag probably would. But those guys probably aren’t moving the needle enough next  year, so you might as well just give Kimi the year.\n\nETA: Re: Max. The ability of Red Bull to put Max in an F1 car immediately was reportedly critical in getting him to the team. Red Bull has the luxury of 4 seats and an entire extra team to mess around with. This is one of the criticisms of allowing RB to have two teams, which is its own discussion.\n\nAnd Mercedes clearly rates him as a generational  talent. As they have little to lose, they roll the dice.', '>""but can someone genuinely explain kimi getting a top seat as a rookie?""\n\nToto wants his very own Max Verstappen. And he wants him now not latter.', ""Mercedes doesn't have a junior team. They've paid teams like Manor, Sauber, and Williams to take their juniors before, but there wasn't a team interested in being their training grounds for Kimi for a year or two. Mercedes wasn't thrilled that they had to leave George in Williams the full three years when they wanted to retrieve him sooner, but Williams only accepted a three year contract, and forced them to see it to the end. So, their options were to not put Antonelli in a seat, or to put them in their seat. We don't know if they had any extra pressure to put Kimi in a seat or lose him to another team, because we don't know contract details.\n\nOther teams wanted Max, but none of the other teams were going to offer a 17 year old an F1 seat, so Max signed with Red Bull."", ""McLaren hasn't been shy to put rookies in. When they were a great team or when they were a midfield team. Lewis, KMag, Stoffel, Lando, Oscar. Sometimes the car has been great, sometimes not so much. Sometimes the rookie has worked out amazingly, sometimes not so much. Red Bull solved the issue by making a junior team. Other teams like Ferrari and Mercedes- and even some others have tried- have sometimes used other teams as proving grounds via a loan, and sometimes they can't get a contract like that."", 'i\'m sure the current kimi situation wasn\'t toto\'s first preference and he would\'ve much rather had max drive for him while kimi developed in williams for at least a year.\n\nbut james vowles did not want to incubate merc juniors and pursued carlos instead and max simply didn\'t want to join mercedes leading to this snowballing effect. in toto\'s head it\'s probably better to give kimi a shot nonetheless instead of storing him away as a reserve.\n\nof course all of this seems to be heavily hinging on kimi being ""the next verstappen"" which is an insanely tall order.', 'Check out which team Lewis Hamilton debuted in.

And why?

Mine

1. Verstappen- I think that's clearer after this season
2. Leclerc- Quick and has made gains in racecraft and consistency 
3. Hamilton- It is hard to rank Lewis. He lost to George in qualy but seemed faster in race trim.
4. Russell- Ran Lewis very close during their time as team mates. Has that dog in him that could win a WDC
5. Norris- Quick but lacks some intangibles at present
6. Sainz- Well rounded. I think he's in the same tier as some above but less potential
7. Alonso- At the backend of his career but still very good.
8. Piastri- It feels harsh but right now I think he's a tier below the top 6
9. Hulk- Would do a job in a top team. Good qualifier
10. Gasly- Impressive midfield driver, looked very good at the end of the season
11. Ocon- Not much to separate between him and Gasly
12. Bottas- I really don't know how good Bottas still is because his car was terrible 
13. Tsunoda- Has shown growth this season
14. Albon- Some stellar drives but Colapinto might have shown his true level?
15. K mag-
16. Perez- Terrible season. Not sure how washed he is though
17. Stroll- Shouldn’t be on the grid but he isn't a disaster. Capable of a good drive on occasion.
18. Zhou- Hard to rank given this  years car


Colapinto and Lawson have a small sample size to judge so I didn't include them. But I would rank then in and around 15th based on what we have seen. Ricciardo in a similar position ","['Checo 1st, he is responsible for giving us some extremely unique stats', 'Mostly agree but a few small changes\n1. Max. No real question here. Probably the most complete driver I have ever seen.\n2. Charles. WDC material with newly found consistency and ruthlessness.\n3. Lando. Leveled up this year and can be dominant situationally. Some mental question marks but no doubting the pace.\n4. George. Another level up this year. Seems to be able to manage tires better. Still a bit error prone but is ready to lead Mercedes\n5. Carlos. Tragedy he lost his place at a front runner. Nearly as fast as Charles and still one of the most cerebral drivers. Little less consistent but still very good. Red Bull will regret not signing him.\n6. Lewis. The pace has started to fall off and errors are more numerous but can still pull out the old GOAT occasionally.\n7. Oscar. Amazing progress in year 2 to solve his tire management issues. Quali h2h vs lando is misleading because the average gap between them was among the closest on the grid. Needs a bit more consistency and better overtaking skills to challenge Lando next year.\n8. Fernando. If he was in a top 4 car, he would have won races. Still one of the best but some signs of errors creeping in.\n9. Gasly. One of his best seasons ever. Hope it’s enough for tempt another shot at a winning team.\n10. Hulk. Amazing pace and consistency. Still got it.\n11. Yuki. Fast and consistent. Still some errors and hot flashes. Deserves the Red Bull promotion over Liam.\n12. Alex. Got a bit found out once Sargent wasn’t in the picture. Needs to be competitive to Sainz next season.\n13. Ocon. Very inconsistent but could have been his situation. Brazil suggests good upside next season.\n14. Liam. Consistent but lacks pace vs Yuki and overdrives the car. Could struggle at Red Bull.\n15. KMag. Flashes of pace but no consistency and some poor racecraft.\n16. Bottas. Was so far back the only benchmark was zhou who he was consistently faster than.\n17. Franco. Has pace but overdrives the car and made repeated errors. Much better than Sargent tho.\n18. Checo. Just not fast, consistent or adaptable enough for this era of car. Still mega on a handful of street circuits.\n19. Stroll. Bit better this season but still wouldn’t be there if it wasn’t for his dad.\n20. Zhou. With the exception of Qatar he just didn’t do anything of note this season and was destroyed by Bottas on pace. Bartoleto is getting Piastri levels of hype and this is a much better use of the seat.', 'There is no way you can rank Hamilton above Russell or Sainz. Otherwise I see nothing to out of place.', '>3.

Verstappen - He's still clearly the best driver on the grid but he wasn't as flawless as he was last year. Makes me optimistic that he can be beaten if the opponent has a slightly stronger car.\n\n2. Leclerc - Improved massively in consistency and only fell off when the car fell. His only issues are strategic decisions and rain, where he's clearly a step below Verstapped. \n\n3. Norris - The speed is there but the consistency and mentality isn't quite yet. He's definitely capable of winning a WDC in the future and I dare say if the car performance was the same he'd win this year if he could do it again. \n\n4. Russell - He has all the qualities of a champion but races like Australia or some tyre degardation issues show why he isn't yet. Still WDC calibre.\n\n5. Sainz - He's brought the fight to Leclerc and was beaten. That's a fairly apt comparison so I'd say he's capable of performing well in a WDC fight but I wouldn't back him for a win. He just has these weekends where he's missing the edge or just crashes out unnecessarily.\n\n6. Alonso - His age is finally showing I'd say. There was a mid-season slump and sometimes he just randomly goes off the track and loses a couple of second. That said, his pace and racecraft are still incredible and he is undoubtedly limited by his machinery.\n\n7. Hamilton - Similar story to Alonso. The consistency doesn't seem to be there anymore. He can be the best driver on the grid by a good margin one race and then get eliminated in Q1 in the next one. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if he finds his footing again next year.\n\n8. Piastri - The biggest letdown of the season imo. He's clearly capable but Norris dominated him most weekends. The margins are smaller than they look in the H2H but there were way too many weekends where Piastri just wasn't there.\n\n9. Gasly - Best midfielder this year imo. Very few incidents and the moment the car became good, he capitalized.\n\n10. Hülkenberg - Has shown incredible qualifying pace but there were also some very clumsy incidents and races that make him less solid than Gasly imo. \n\n11. Ocon - Very hard to rank since the Alpines usually had different upgrade packages but I think he was a bit flattered by Gasly's bad luck early on. \n\n12. Tsunoda - I think there's a decent gap between 11 and 12 and now there a few very close ones again. There was some incredible driving from Yuki this year but there were also plenty of annonymous weekends.  \n\n13. Magnussen - He seemed very willing to play the team game and that reflected poorly on his points. There were some very weekends but at this point everyone has them.\n\n14. Albon - A bit of a disappointment to be honest. The car wasn't great but Colapinto was uncomfortably close to him and more importantly, he got into way too many accidents this season. Though, I do think Albon is fully capable of being the best driver in the midfield. Just not this year.\n\n15. Bottas - He's a great qualifier but the races this year have been rather terrible for him. Obviously the car was terrible but he's been close with Zhou in the races and I don't particularily rate him. I'd imagine he would still do a decent job in a better team though.\n\n16. Stroll - Stroll is overhated because he can be pretty good on his day. Still, he gets into these clumsy incidents that really do not do him a favour. \n\n17. Perez - Perez isn't a terrible driver. His midfield days are proof of that. The Red Bull is a difficult car to drive and Perez is apparently terrible at driving that particular car. \n\n18. Zhou - I don't think Zhou is bad. He's just a capable pair of hands that's not particularily fast. But in a grid this stacked being average results in being last.

1ha8ben,It's past time to re-evaluate the narrative of the 2024 season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ha8ben/its_past_time_to_reevaluate_the_narrative_of_the/,2024-12-09, Discussion,"The prevailing narrative on social media this season has been ""McLaren are bottling the WDC/WCC"" or ""Lando is bottling the race/championship"" or - when they have won - ""McLaren should have won this earlier"".  Even now that they've completed their best season in literal decades with a championship win, the narrative still seems to be focused on the fact that McLaren are not perfect.  As if any team is.

It is my view that RBR has broadly escaped criticism on social media for their dramatic drop in form in 2024. with the exception of Checo Perez, who I think is often the scapegoat that takes all (or most) of the blame for the failings that belong to the team as a whole.

Both the WDC and the WCC were RBR's to lose this year.  The only team that *bottled* anything was RBR in falling so spectacularly hard after the season had started, especially after coming off of several years of complete dominance.  The WDC this year was won by Max Verstappen, but with one hand tied behind his back and an entire Formula One team strapped to his back as he pulled himself over the line by sheer force of will and unbelievable skill.

Maybe it's a reaction to British Media, which I'm largely unexposed to, but the narratives on social media to me seem completely out of touch with reality.

If you're wearing Papaya or ""Rosso Corsa"", you should have nothing but pride for how your season went - even if you have plenty of opportunities still to improve upon for next season.  But if you're with Red Bull (and your name isn't Verstappen), you need to be going into the off-season with some humility and some organizational soul-searching, because this was a bad, bad season for you and 2025 is fast approaching.","[""You have a team that has lost it's way in terms of car development with a car that is difficult to setup and drive (RBR).
