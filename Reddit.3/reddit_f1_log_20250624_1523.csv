Piastri needed 2 whole seasons until he started to beat Lando consistently, Tsunoda also needed around 2 years until he wasn\'t so crash prone and hot-headed anymore. Franz Tost who worked with junior drivers for over a decade claimed that a driver needs around 3 seasons in order to show what he\'s truly capable off.', ""His junior record is comparable to Russell and Piastri. People shouldn't be writing him off yet"", 'Leclerc was the last sauber driver whose career survived that team. Let that settle in and judge him accordingly. If they would swap seats with Hadjar suddenly he would be the star rookie of this season.', 'According to Brazilian fans he hasnt scored any points because Sauber actively sabotages him while prioritizing Nico since obviously Nico is a German driver and Audi is German, so check mate, Gabriel is obviously Max level. \n\nOn a more serious note, hes decent in quali so far, which is the minimum as a young driver to stay in F1 but struggles in the race which isnt too surprising. Nico is a brilliant driver, Oscar took 2 years to get to Lando, ofc Lando is plenty faster than Nico but even the perhaps 2025 world champion in Piastri needed some time to know what hes doing in a race.

Him and Nico have the closest pace delta. So he's on the right track. As for Sunday's he'll only get better with experience. \n\nHulk is no slouch and is a good benchmark to have. Gabi can also watch and learn from Hulk in terms of how he works with the engineers. The man is well regarded for his technical know how. Engineers have praised his technical feedback and Gabi can learn a lot from him."", 'Regardless of how they slice it, it still looks pretty bad on Bortoleto that he has zero points while Hulkenberg has 20 points. It seems like this is heading towards Esteban Gutierrez 2016-esque season for him.', ""He is much better than the point table makes him look and I think Sauber/Audi is aware of that. Put Antonelli or Bearman in that car and they would also struggle to score a point. Being close to Hulkenberg in quali at this stage is a sign of serious potential.

Recently I’ve been doing a fair bit of research on driver’s styles. I’m trying to see who was fastest no matter what really. For example:

Ayrton Senna - extremely fast in his era. Unique style was akin to how traction control works, and enabled him to stay on the edge. Great longevity going from twitchy turbo cars to NA V12s, but difficult to predict how this would have fared in the TC V10s era. Was showing adaptability at Williams in 94, however. 

Schumacher - preferred understeer contrary to popular belief, however after his time at Benetton he adapted to a pointy oversteer setup which kept him at the limit more consistently than other drivers. But in the V8 era he struggled: he couldn’t use his ‘rallycrosser’ style to its full potential, and it’s also important to factor in age, he wasn’t as sharp. 

Fangio - the master of the four wheel drift. Only drove as quick as was necessary, demonstrating so at the 1957 German GP. Perfect style for his time.

Jean Alesi - one of my personal favourites, however less of an efficient style, more entertaining. Often took the car far over the limit. Right places, wrong times in the peak of his career. 

These are just some off of the top of my head, I know I’m missing out many massive names. In your opinion, how was the penultimate example for how to go fast, or the best all round driver?

With an exploding engine, Piastri's McLaren retires before Q1 is over. His first and only flyer puts him in 16th. Norris gets through to Q2, but gets stuck in the gravel of T4, bringing out the red flag. He starts 12th for the race.

Verstappen does a bonker of a lap in Q3 that puts him half a second in front of second place, Lewis Hamilton. The Mercedes is nowhere, finishing 9th and 10th. Who starts 3rd? Nico Hülkenberg.

**RACE**

Hamilton, with a better launch, pushes Verstappen wide out of T1. Verstappen, now livid, catches up by T3, overshoots the corner, and crashes into Hamilton, taking them both out.

After the safety car has come and gone, Hülkenberg leads the race. Unfortunately, he has Leclerc behind him, who eventually overtakes him. He manages to fend off Alonso for several laps, before losing out to him, too. Around the last 20 laps, Hadjar has gotten past Ocon and is chasing down Hülkenberg, as well.

Will the German's podium hopes be vanquished once again?

Hadjar gets past into T3, the Sauber's tires deteriorating. The current podium: LEC-ALO-HAD

But! Leclerc has a puncture! A piece of Lance Stroll's brittled front wing - after colliding with a lapping Alonso on lap 65 - has stuck itself into the Monegasque’s wheels, and the latter has to retire. Alonso, post Stroll collision, limped back to the pits with a puncture of his own.

This means Hadjar leads the race!

A late safety car means we get a final two laps of racing. The current podium: HAD-HÜL-RUS (Ocon is 10th at this point)

Norris and Piastri are 4th and 5th.

Hadjar restarts, but both Hülkenberg and Russell get better traction. Into T3, and Hülkenberg launches up the inside! He is back in the lead! Russell passes Hadjar into T4, he is now in 2nd.

Norris and Piastri manage to pass Hadjar into T1 and T3 on the next lap, but fighting each other along the way, they’re too far from the top two.

Sadly, the Merc of Russell is dominant over the Sauber, and he passes Hülkenberg with ease on the straight into T4 of the last lap.

BUT HE HAS TOO MUCH SPEED.

HE HITS THE GRAVEL, AND RUSSELL IS BEACHED.

Final top 3 over the line: HÜL-HAD-ANT

If it reaches a point where Qatar and the UAE are basically off limits due to a wider regional conflict - airlines aren't flying in, ships aren't getting in, etc. then F1 would obviously not be able to race there and it may start to affect other races on the calendar too.\n\nHowever, as others have noted, if the conflict gets to that point there will obviously be a heck of a lot affected outside of F1 and we'll probably be more concerned with other matters than whether the Qatar GP is going ahead or not."", 'This is F1 we’re talking about.

If another Canadian GP happens, then a conversation needs to be had. However, if they take each other out a la Rosberg and Hamilton, then they'll probably need to institute some kind of order.
