Monza has always been the ItalianGP and has been on the F1-calendar since the start in 1950. Whereas Imola was added to the calendar in 1980 and only hosted the ItalianGP in its first year.

He saw Franco race more than most of us and a big part of the press and knows what he can do. \n\nI completely agree with his take, the only one of Colapinto¬¥s crashes from last year that was 100% on him as a rookie mistake was the Qualy in Vegas putting absurd pressure on getting a perfect fast lap on a car that wasn¬¥t meant to be in Q3 trying to ""overperform"" to ensure a seat in 2025, and ended up horribly. Considering he is fast and has a kinda aggressive driving style the worst thing he can do is do the same this year thinking he has 5 only races to ""prove"" himself and therefore attempt suicidal overtakes in Monaco without space or wild stuff like that.\n\nI trust he will do well at least to keep his seat for the remainder of the season.', ""I aint worried about Franco.

1kn963u,[AMuS] Does anyone ever reach the limit?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kn963u/amus_does_anyone_ever_reach_the_limit/,2025-05-15, News,,"[""I hope they don't change the minimum weight ever, let them figure it out in due course, at least there will be a third front where teams can duke it over and not just in engine and aerodynamics"", 'Dispute over the 2026 F1 minimum weight.\n\nTranslation: \n\n> **Weight will become a factor that could make the difference in 2025. Experts predict that no Formula 1 car will reach the lower limit.**\n\n> We\'ve already written extensively here about the new F1 rules for the 2026 season. The focus has mostly been on the new hybrid engines, which will massively increase the electric component. The associated aerodynamic reform, with the movable wing elements at the front and rear ends of the cars, has also already sparked much discussion. The double DRS is intended to make the racing cars zip through the air more energy-efficiently.\n\n> But there\'s a third important pillar that\'s currently causing the engineers headaches. The new regulations stipulate a drastically reduced minimum weight. And as if the technical regulations weren\'t complicated enough, a further differentiation has now been introduced in this regard. A distinction is made between the minimum weight in qualifying sessions (726 kilograms) and the races (724 kilograms). This is intended to compensate for the drivers\' fluid consumption and weight loss.\n\n> Added to this value is the weight of the tires, which according to current plans should be 46.4 kilograms. This means that the complete cars in qualifying trim would have to weigh at least 772.4 kilograms. By comparison, the current generation has a minimum weight of a whopping 800 kilograms. And even now, the engineers are fighting for every gram to somehow reach the limit.\n\n> **Tires lighter, car heavier**\nThe designers get some help from the more compact dimensions of the race cars: The chassis is ten centimeters wider, and 20 centimeters are subtracted from the maximum permitted wheelbase. The new Pirelli tires, which are 25 millimeters narrower at the front and 30 millimeters narrower at the rear, save almost five kilograms per set.\n\n> However, this is offset by new elements that increase weight. The FIA \u200b\u200bhas further tightened crash test requirements for 2026. This means that teams will have to laminate additional carbon layers in many areas for safety reasons.\n\n> Even with the elimination of the MGU-H, no savings can be made in the drivetrain. The increase in electrical power from 120 to 350 kW and the amount of energy available per lap from four to nine megajoules require significantly larger batteries. By comparison, the current regulations stipulate a weight window of 20 to 25 kilograms for energy storage units. In the future, there will only be a minimum weight of 35 kilograms. And even that, experts describe as extremely ambitious. The increased load and higher energy density could make batteries a real performance factor by 2026.\n\n> **Weight vs. Performance.**\nBut even with new storage technology, hardly any of the cars will reach the minimum weight. ""They simply plucked a number out of thin air and established it as the minimum weight. We\'re getting engines that weigh significantly more, and the minimum weight of the car will go down,"" complained Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. The teams now have to decide how to use their development resources. With weight reduction, the time savings are automatically reflected on the clock. Ten kilograms less results in approximately 0.35 seconds per lap. The effect of aerodynamic upgrades is much less precise to calculate.\n\n> The engineers have to consider where they can save weight most efficiently. ""If you want to become lighter, it may come at the expense of other parts that are important for performance,"" points out Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff. However, the Austrian is generally a supporter of the new regulations: ""The reason for reducing weight is to make the cars more agile again. I think that\'s important. We have to start somewhere. Of course, the first step is difficult. But everyone is affected equally.""\n\n> The engineers faced a similar dilemma before the 2022 season. Here, too, the introduction of the new regulations brought with it more ambitious weight requirements. At the start, only Sauber managed to push the limits. The reward was a strong first half of the season. As the other cars also continued to slim down over the course of the year, the Swiss race car fell further and further down the field.\n\n> **Aggressive benchmark.**\nBut the 2026 limit seems out of reach for anyone: ""The bar has been set quite aggressively. But we like the challenge,"" says Alpine\'s technical director David Sanchez. Paul Monaghan, chief engineer at Red Bull, also emphasizes the appeal of the task: ""We\'ll see next year in March how far everyone is over the minimum weight. The whole thing is relative: If we\'re x kilos over and the others are x kilos over, then it\'s fine.""\n\n> According to Monaghan, the course must already be set: ""A lot depends on the design decisions that are made in the coming weeks and months. If we make all parts five percent lighter, then the entire car will be five percent lighter. And then five percent is suddenly no longer a small number. It will be an expensive task to get the weight out.""\n\n> As a result of the aggressive diet, the cars will likely wear less paint, as was the case at the beginning of the current regulation cycle, when bare carbon dominated the face of the premier class. Furthermore, engineers cannot install extra ballast to compensate for balance issues. A third disadvantage of the excess weight is that drivers will only wear cooling vests when the FIA \u200b\u200bdeclares official heat-resistant races. Only then will all teams be forced to install counterweights if a driver is not using the air conditioning.\n\n> Haas boss Ayao Komatsu firmly believes that weight can make the difference next season: ""As long as the factors of weight, aerodynamics, and powertrain are reasonably balanced, it\'s fine. But if we notice at the first race that, for example, the power unit accounts for 90 percent of the performance, then that\'s not good. All factors should have a noticeable impact on performance.""', "">‚ÄúClearly it will still be a challenge for the teams to achieve that low weight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey're not going to have an easy ride there.\n\n>‚ÄúBut we are going to stick to the weight limit we're going to impose, and we won't be inflating upwards again.\n\n>‚ÄúThey \\[the teams\\] will just have to push harder to reduce the weight if they can't make it.‚Äù\n\n\\- Nikolas [Tombazis](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-wants-to-avoid-weight-haggling-with-f1-2026-rules/10561970/)\n\nThis is from the beginning of 2024, but I assume that view hasn't changed.\n\nI just hope they can sort out the liveries"", 'So 22 all carbon cars next year. Great.', 'Charles reaches his limit of sanity every season', 'Yep. I like it, gives teams the ability to push in different ways. One team has the lightest car, one team has the best engine, one team has the best downforce... hmm! Plus - pushing for lighter materials has a unique risk - very fast to cut kgs, but flimsy front wings or aero bits... and you have to be careful...', ""I'm afraid that's not realistic. I think it was 2022 or 23 when they raised the minimum weight shortly after winter testing because Apart from Sauber all teams were above it (as in, Sauber was able to reach it with extra ballasts,which of course is favourable over the car itself being heavier on its own).\n\nI still think it was bullshit."", ""> A third disadvantage of the excess weight is that drivers will only wear cooling vests when the FIA \u200b\u200bdeclares official heat-resistant races. Only then will all teams be forced to install counterweights if a driver is not using the air conditioning.\n\nSo you get better performance if you don't wear the cooling vest?"", 'The problem with this area is that the teams will likely try to save weight by compromising on safety. If they will find a grey area within those requirements and testing procedures, you sure as hell know they will exploit it. And that is a problem for obvious reasons.']",26,14,0.79,26,12,12,4,3,0.0,4

He also wasn‚Äôt up against a great set of drivers, with Lauda falling off after 78 and Prost still green through around 82 and possibly longer.\n\nHowever, a lot of mathematical models don‚Äôt really back up my (admittedly very basic) assessment and rank him as quite clearly the top driver overall during his time in the sport. Why is this? Specifically‚Ä¶\n\nIs he thought to have outperformed Scheckter in 79 despite losing the title to him? Is it understood that the Monaco mechanical failure, Zandvoort tyre blowout and having to stay behind at Monza - and to some extent an unavoidable incident at Zolder forcing him to burn through his fuel in an effort to rescue a result - cost him compared to Scheckter, whose only real setback was a DNF at Watkins Glen after the title was won?\n\nIn 1980, some believe that being given the worst Ferrari of all time caused Scheckter to check out. Is this possible? Or can we draw no other conclusion than Villeneuve being simply that good?\n\nIn 81, how much do those two wins distort the true picture of Villeneuve relative to Pironi?
