1n0gwl2,"Looking at mid-season ratings, do you still think that results from 2024 F2 are not representative of rookies performance?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n0gwl2/looking_at_midseason_ratings_do_you_still_think/,2025-08-26, Discussion,"I will preface by saying that I know it has been just 14 races and things could change in the future. At the same time however, it is enough to draw some conslusions.

In 2024 there were many discussions about how we shouldn't look to much into 2024 F2 results. This notion applied almost exclusively  to Prema, because both of its overhyped drivers had underwhelming rusults. (in comparison to expactations). Also both of their drivers were set to join F1 basically from the beginning of that year. So it seemed easier to blame the team than to acknowledge that the Prema boys might have been underperformimg. Meanwhile rookies like Bortoleto and Hadjar were barely talked about. 

As for now, after 14 races it seems that the F2 2024 standings generally reflect the order, in which rookies are rated on F1 grid. Moreover I still kinda don't understand, how some people are surprised that Bortoleto (literally F3 and F2 back to back champion) is doing that well. ","[""Your first mistake is assuming that people know Bortoleto was a back to back champion. Most people watching F1 turn the TV on just before the race starts, and maybe just before qualifying starts and that's it, and that extends to people posting on here"", ""Yes and no. Bortoleto and Hadjar, were top two last year, and are arguably the two best rookies this season so far, so in that regard, this was extremely representative. But I can't sit here and pretend that Bearman was only the 12th best driver, especially after his performances at Haas and even his sole outing for Ferrari. It's a bit frustrating, really, how inconclusive that championship often is."", 'It‚Äôs way too soon to say. I think you can‚Äôt really judge the quality of a F2 grid until 5 years later when you see what they all went to achieve elsewhere. \n\nHadjar is actually a good example of F2 results not always being representative of talent. He finished P14 in his rookie F2 season behind his teammate who was also a rookie. At the time many people questioned why Red Bull didn‚Äôt drop him, especially since his teammate was also a RB driver and he did get dropped. He changes teams and there‚Äôs a new car and suddenly he challenges for the title. Now he‚Äôs doing a great job in F1 and those same people who questioned him are now applauding him.\n\nOllie and Kimi were also not the only favourites underperforming last year. Victor Martins was a F3 champion and had a good rookie year, yet last year he was absolutely nowhere. Taylor Barnard was highly rated and yet got comprehensively beaten by his teammate who people didn‚Äôt rate that highly. He left to go do FE and did an amazing job there.\n\nSo the flaws of the F2 championship were somewhat exaggerated last year because favourites weren‚Äôt doing well, but that doesn‚Äôt mean those flaws don‚Äôt exist. The truth is that there is no objective way to judge junior drivers against each other, so it often comes down to right place right time. I don‚Äôt think any of the rookies are drowning right now, so I don‚Äôt think there are any that shouldn‚Äôt be there. Of course you can question how someone else would be doing in their shoes, but those what-ifs have always been there and will always be there.', 'look at how the status of the 2018 F2 title challengers in during the mid season break in 2019\n\nF2 champion Russell: languishing in the back in a Williams\n\nF2 Runner up Norris: showing strong potential in a Mclaren against Carlos Sainz\n\nF2 3rd place Albon: Promoted to Red Bull Racing\n\nmaybe its still too early to know, all three drivers have done well but the pecking order between them is more clear now 5 years later', ""I do think people really underestimate how representative F2 can be, especially last year. In general because it was a new car we didnt really have a best team, some teams figured out the car quicker but it was peaky from many. So that aspect did make it hard to truly understand the order, though I think people did over blow it just because the pre-season favourites in Kimi and Bearman struggled.\n\nI think generally the top drivers in any given season are the top drivers for a reason. Many can say its car and team setup, but you still need to be good enough to make sure you maximise that chance. This is the same in every category, its naive to think everywhere is completely equal. For sure that can make it easy to dismiss certain results, but its unfair to really downplay a driver when they are performing in my opinion.\n\nWhat Hadjar and Bortoleto have shown this season is there's a good reason why they were the ones that fought for the title. So yeah, I do think it adds some weight to the championship when they are performing."", ""Yeah it was unrepresentative imo. Anyone who was convinced Bortoleto would fail wasn't paying attention, but that's not really an argument for F2 being representative. He's 1 driver, you can easily make the opposite argument with Bearman. Bearman finished 12th in F2 last year, he was nowhere near the 12th best driver on that grid. He's currently very close to Ocon and last year as well had strong performances in F1 while to some extent floundering in F2"", ""Watching f2 last year, it was so clear to me that Bortoleto was the best driver. Kimi might have more potential because tbh, I don't know how to judge that without access to data etc, but Bortoleto was definitely the stand out. \n\nI'm ready for that audi to be good next year"", ""In a good way, what appears to have happened is that the F2 and F3 have become really good development grounds for F1. Even the 'worst' rookie in 2025 is perhaps only 1.5% slower than the fastest driver and almost certainly within 0.5% of their counterpart in the same team.\n\nPerhaps this is due to the technology of simulators that allow F2 and perhaps even F3 drivers so much more 'time' experiencing F1 like conditions."", 'Yes, I still think the results were unrepresentative, with Bearman as a prime example. He has been quietly excellent this year; his points tally is mediocre because he keeps finishing 11th but he has been matching the far more experienced Ocon on pace. \n\nBear in mind that Bearman was regularly getting poles and wins in his debut F2 year in 2023, and was probably the fastest driver on the grid in terms of qualifying pace, but then was suddenly nowhere in 2024 despite staying at the same team. This makes no sense from a driver perspective; I find it impossible to believe he just got way slower for no reason in the space of a few months. The issue was clearly with the team.\n\nNone of this is to say that I am surprised by Bortoleto, by the way. He absolutely deserved the championship last year and has been fantastic so far this year.']",107,73,0.82,107,739,739,-2,0,0.0,-2

**2012:** Ricciardo, Vergne, Grosjean, **Pic**: Bit unfair to give this one to Pic as he was stuck driving a Manor all year, but the other three were consistently good to great (albeit Ricciardo and Vergne‚Äôs Toro Rossi was awful for most of the season).

**2013:** Bottas, **Gutierrez**, Bianchi, Chilton, Van Der Garde: An undertalked about driver in my opinion when it comes to discussing the 2010‚Äôs worst drivers. Gutierrez was in point scoring cars for two of his three seasons in F1, and he finished in the points a grand total of once.

**2014:** Magnussen, Kvyat, **Ericsson**: I don‚Äôt want to be too mean on Marcus, because he is a reasonable driver in F1, and has had more convincing performances than he gets credit for, especially in his last season. Having said that, him being overtaken by Bianchi in Monaco of all places costed his team dearly.

**2015:** Sainz, Verstappen, Nasr, **Stevens**, Mehri: For some reason every time I look up driver ranking lists, Stevens is always ranked over Mehri, despite Mehri finishing higher than him in the standings. Granted, Stevens beat him in more races, but it was hardly Verstappen team mate dominance.

**2016:** Palmer, Ocon, **Haryanto**, Wherlein: I feel for this lineup, because all of them were driving terrible cars. To Haryanto‚Äôs credit, he did occasionally beat Wherlein in qualifying, but he never beat him in the races.

**2017: Vandoorne**, Stroll: As much as people like to hate on Lance Stroll, even in this season alone, his accomplishments were a lot higher than Vandoorne‚Äôs.

**2018:** Gasly, Leclerc, Sirotkin, **Hartley**: Always looked out of his depth, despite driving a points scoring capable car. Whenever he qualified well, he would tumble terribly in the race. Only scored four points, all of which came down to crazy races or shocking disqualifications.

**2019:** Russell, **Giovinazzi**, Norris, Albon: By far the worst interesting of the three. Had no standout moments all year and was easily beaten by an aging Raikonnen.

**2020: Latifi:** He‚Äôs the only rookie in this particular year, but considering the quality of his performances, I think calling him the worst rookie of the year suits him far more than being the best.

**2021:** Tsunoda, **Mazepin**, Schumacher: No words are required here.

**2022: Zhou:** Unlike Latifi, Zhou‚Äôs rookie year was alright. Nothing spectacular, but I would say his rookie year was the best rookie year of all the worst rookies on this list.

**2023: Sargeant**, De Vries, Lawson, Piastri: Close between Sargeant and De Vries, but ultimately went with Logan due to De Vries having occasionally out qualified Tsunoda.

**2024: Colapinto**: Really the only driver who can be called a full time rookie in 2024, but he still did alright. Shame he didn‚Äôt show the promise from this year currently at Alpine.

Agree with my picks or disagree with them? Let me know in the comments below.","['Mazepin exists on this list to make all of the other worst feel better.

He averaged almost a second a lap slower in qualifying against Massa, and the only reason it was close in points was due to Massa suffering a cartoonish amount of bad luck.
