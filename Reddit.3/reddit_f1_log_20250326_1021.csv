Some big names with great primes that come to mind for me are Ricciardo and Massa. Granted, I haven't been watching as far back as their primes so I wouldn't know, but it truly feels like we have another uncrowned Champion in the making. 

Charles might have had mistakes earlier in his career but it really feels like he ironed them out last season and performs every race week. It's only early in his career but its possible we'll never see him lift the WDC Trophy despite being apparently more deserving than other names like Russel, Norris, or Piastri.

I know they raced each other in the junior series but I wasn't really following that level too closely.","['From Yuki about 2 weeks ago: \n\n“I wouldn’t say I’m happy for him. Like, that’s kind of a lie. He has done definitely what he should do and, he gave his best. He gave definitely a 100% performance, and, also, I gave 100%. It was in the end up to Red Bull how they’re going to do it.”\n\n“We’re still friends for sure, and we still chat each other, and I like to talk to him. And, yes, since 2020, before that, actually, we had a lot of time that we are teammates, driving in the same categories.”\n\n(via: GPblog)\n\nThey are used to competing with each other and have been rivals for many years. Lawson’s been more defensive in his recent comments about deserving the seat “he’s had his time, now it’s my time” and saying he beat Yuki in the junior series, he has no sympathy for Yuki getting passed over but I think that’s just due to the pressure and him trying to be all like i’m not here to feel bad for others/make friends i’m here to win etc.', 'They were actually good friends a while back. Red Bull puts their juniors up in the same block of flats in Milton Keynes, so you’d see them on stream together (same with Vips before his gamer moment). \n\nI think a lot of the shit talk is media saying half of a quote to them mixed in with the obvious conflict over both wanting that seat. \n\nTsunoda was asked whether he’s ready to take the seat. He said 100%. Reasonable question, reasonable answer. He was asked if he’d do better than Lawson in the RB21 in China, he said he didn’t drive in it in China so he doesn’t know but he didn’t feel he was too far off Max in his Abu Dhabi test.\n\nLawson was told ‘Yuki is saying he’s ready to take your seat’ and Lawson has hit back saying ‘Well actually I beat him in juniors and F1 so he can say what I want’. Lawson was probably a bit sensitive considering everyone was talking about him coming P20 twice and clearly struggling and the reporters have used the exact thing that would provoke him.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how they go.
