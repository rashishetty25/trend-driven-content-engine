I was sitting in the grandstand at the final corner, just one corner after where Lando and Oscar went off and only about 100 metres away, and there were barely even a couple drops of rain when they went off, and it took probably about 2 more minutes before it started to properly rain. The rain that took Lando and Oscar off was extremely localised.', '**Q: Alright, very well done to you. Max, let\'s come to you now. You ran Lando very close at the end. What were you thinking? Just one more lap?**\n\nMV: No, not so much, to be honest. I just tried my best, tried to be close, tried to put a bit of pressure on, but it\'s very hard to pass around here. There was only one line. Even if I had gotten a run into whatever, Turn 9, you have to go onto the wet part, so you can\'t really do a lot. But at least it was close. It looked good on TV.\n \n**Q: Can we talk a lot more about the rain? Tell us about the call to stay out one more lap?**\n\nMV: Two more laps! We were on the Medium, and of course, you never know how that\'s going to work out. But I thought it was quite a sensible call with 15, 16, or 20 laps to go when the Safety Car came out. Then, of course, it started to rain. I saw them go off in front of me, kept it clean, and when I saw Oscar rejoining, I thought, ""Well, let\'s stay out,"" because it was only those three corners. The rest was still dry. When I continued, basically, the first two sectors were fine – it was just if I could survive the final sector. I think that lap I did was okay. If there wasn\'t much more rain coming, I thought it could work. You also have to factor in that even if they caught me on an Inter, they’d have to box again for slicks, if it’s not going to rain anymore. So, it was fine. I thought, ""Yeah, we\'ll do another lap,"" but then, unfortunately, on that lap, the first sector was still okay-ish, but then in Sector 2, it started to rain a bit too much and we had to box. But in hindsight, it wouldn\'t have mattered. If I’d boxed with Lando, it would have been P2. If I’d boxed the next lap, it would have been P2. And the lap that I did box, I was also P2. So, we tried something else—it might have worked. In a way, it didn’t work, but we didn’t lose any position, so it’s fine.\n \n**Q: Max, when you think where you and the team were at the start of the weekend on Friday after practice, how satisfying is this P2?**\n\nMV: I think it\'s good compared to the teams behind us. But if you look at the first stint, we were quite a bit off. As soon as the tyres started to overheat, we had no chance. McLaren just took off. So, we still have a lot of work to do to fight for a win. But yeah, I’m happy that we are second here. It\'s basically one place better than we should have been. And it\'s 18 more points than I had last year at this race.', ""Very fair. I had a feeling that the best he could manage and clutch was P2 anyway, no matter what they had tried to do. I forgot that the overheating of those tyres had played a part in scaling back the overall car performance. His race management was fantastic. Verstappen, as a driver in tricky conditions and a competitor to the front, should not be dismissed easily in the slightest. \n\nI am pretty interested in seeing how Verstappen can extract the most out of the car this season. He seems to have a mighty knack for it, and he can give the frontrunners a run for their money. This season is Norris' to lose so if Verstappen manages to bring the fight to McLaren, it is going to be peak"", 'The thing is that if Verstappen had pitted the lap after (instead of two laps after), he could have overtaken Norris. In the first half of his outlap, Norris was struggling to keep up with Lawson, so he was losing time.', 'It was the reverse Sochi 2021 I feel, where back then Lewis pitted immediately when things went south but Lando decided to stick out and then faced the consequences.\n\nWhile in this case Max didn’t pay as much of a consequence, Lando made the earliest call to pit in before anybody else and turned out to have made the right decision. As that race was one of the biggest heartbreaks since I started watching F1, this was a very, very rewarding moment for me. Your favorite driver is learning from the mistake he’s made 4 years ago! Sochi 2021 died so Melbourne 2025 could live.', ""Staying out was the right call IMO, do the opposite of what Lando did. There was a high chance of a shunt in the in-between conditions, it just happened one lap too late for Max. If Lawson/Bortoleto's crashes were one lap sooner, Max gets a cheap safety car stop and comes out in P1.\n\nPeople galaxy brain the hindsight of these decisions all the time. Hell, even in Brazil last year, Lando and George pitting for new tires was technically the right call on the basis of probability, and it literally took Colapinto binning it during a safety car for Max + the alpines' gamble to stay out to pay off, and binning it during a safety car even in the rain is still statistically quite rare, even though anecdotally we've seen it at the past two wet races now.\n\nSometimes you have to just accept that these decisions are mostly probability based gambles from the lead driver, and that it's also acceptable for the non-lead driver to do the opposite thing even it's statistically less likely to work out for them, because it's their best chance of overtaking the leader."", 'Possibly, but that’s when you only look at Lando. At that point, they still thought that he might be able to stay out on slicks, so if he pitted, he would lose out to the Ferrari’s. In hindsight, this wasn’t the case, but still. \n\nAnd that is assuming he actually had a big enough gap. I remember seeing Norris 21 seconds behind as the biggest gap. Would that have been enough?', 'Correction, Lewis wanted to stay out but Mercedes forced him to pit while McLaren was talking in riddles to Lando.', ""Lando was bugging his engineer to pit early instead of late as soon as he found out that the rain would be Class 3. He even reiterated the plan before the safety car restart. Then, maybe about half a lap before he went off, Lando said that they should pit because he was starting to struggle a bit. You could see the extremely localized spits of rain on his onboard camera. It's almost good that he went off in sector 3 and could pit immediately because McLaren really didn't want to pit too early and that forced everyone's hand and made their decision for them.\n\nI agree with you. I was getting Sochi flashbacks, and I wasn't even the one in the car! This felt like a redemption race for that day. \n\nI stand by the fact that Lando is and has always been very good in the wet, but it felt like the first time he was able to show that he could hold his own in wet/changing conditions while the spotlight was on him.\n\nIn fact, I feel like this race was a small answer to a lot of the criticism he gets. Bad in the wet? Wet race. Poor starts? Kept P1 throughout multiple restarts. Falters under pressure? Keeps it together with a charging Verstappen right behind him in the wet. Emotional communicator? Was extremely calm and clear on the radio.\n\nI was already happy for him even before the win was secured. There's been a lot of growth all around."", 'Plus, 9/10 times you see someone beaches it like Piastri did on wet grass, they don’t manage to rejoin so that’s at least a VSC.']",326,18,0.95,326,457,457,-5,1,0.0,-5

I know it’s busy, pls don’t crucify me. I think that time interval and tire strategy are two parts of the same story, so I added a tire progress bar lol. I also added number of laps on the current tire, and changed the time to green if within 1 second of the driver ahead (as suggested in the comments of my last post). 


Pic 2:

For the “it’s too cluttered imo” folks, I removed the progress bar and just added each driver’s previous tires as little dots :) Tbh I prefer it to pic 1. 

Would love any other suggestions of ways to depict both past tires and tire life (ideally without cluttering it all up). 


Pic 3: 

Bonus update to my sector times post. Changed the sectors to vertical bars which pop out like the pit square. I muuuch prefer this to my original one, so thanks for all the suggestions and discussion. 

I also switched back to the original purple color. Long live purple, down with usurple. #fuckusurple #allmyhomieshateusurple



Loved all the comments and feedback in the last post, so would welcome more of the same. Haha even if it’s just to say you bloody hate it.

The technical issue the FIA has been focusing on since the end of 2024 continues to be the monitoring of wing deflections, with the Paris technical office having embarked on a sort of battle against the teams to put an end to the issue. Red Bull’s technical director, Pierre Waché, had not entirely misspoken in Bahrain on the matter. “We see that some are still using the mini-DRS,” said the French engineer. \n\nRegarding what was seen in Melbourne through high-resolution cameras mounted on the cars during the Friday practice sessions, the FIA now has no doubts that the teams have already bypassed the static tests imposed with the previous limitations. The monitoring of the rear wings in Australia left no room for doubt. In the morning, the teams were informed of another technical directive coming soon in China.\n\nStarting from the Australian Grand Prix, the updated Articles 3.15.17 and 3.15.12b came into effect, relating to the movement of the rear wing-beam wing group, with stricter static tests. The checks on the beam wing did not cause particular problems for the cars, but already during testing in Bahrain, the Federation took action to put a stop to the Mini-DRS issue. The additional cameras that focused on the rear wings left no doubts for the team led by Jan Monchoaux, who has been heading the FIA's technical department since 2024. In the morning, they informed the teams that they would proceed with an additional revision of the technical directive, starting from the Chinese GP, to counter the excessive deflection of the rear wings noted in Australia. Article 3.15.17, which pertains to the test related to the slot-gap between the mainplane and the movable wing, will be updated, with the gap not exceeding 0.5 mm when a 750N load is applied at the wing tips (with the car stationary), compared to the 2 mm allowed until Australia. The test is conducted by applying the vertical load to the left and right in an area between the mainplane of the rear wing and the movable flap.\n\nExclusive mini-DRS FIA\n\nA 75% reduction from the previous tolerance value, leaving very little movement in the carbon structure.

Apparently, no specific team is being targeted by the Federation; rather, it is a generalized issue of wing deflection abuse that has angered the FIA's technical office, which found itself dealing with the spread of the phenomenon despite continuous actions taken.

1jcut88,Why was it that Piastri had to be in the reverse gear for the car to get going.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jcut88/why_was_it_that_piastri_had_to_be_in_the_reverse/,2025-03-16, Technical,"Under normal circumstances where it’s not raining, I suppose it’d be easier to get the car back on track after running into the grass ? 

I also noticed that he tried the forward gear multiple times but to no avail, before switching to the reverse gear. Only then was he able to get the car moving. What’s the reasoning behind this?

Now that the dust has settled in Melbourne, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post-race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyze the results.

Low-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks","['Marko sucks. I really hope the sport turns on him over his Hadjar comments.  Probably won’t happen, but a man can dream.', 'The most curious thing for me was how similar to the end of the past season everything was, in terms of performance. McLaren being the much faster car when the tires drop, Max being able to hang in there at the beginning until that point, Ferrari apparently compromising their setup, Mercedes being a sort of unremarkable good team... it seems like things only shook up a little at the back of the grid (mostly Haas...).\n\nObviously this is the first race and we should see teams making leaps as they adjust to new packages and all that, but it was weirdly underwhelming despite a very eventful race.', ""Well that was an entertaining race to start the season.  I feel a bit sorry for all the rookies in their first race having such a difficult race. \n\n* **Haas** wtf? I really thought they would be able to continue their upwards trend from last season.\n* **Williams** on the other hand are actually on an upwards trend? Shame that Albon lost the P4 in the end, but that he even managed to hold onto that in the first place was amazing. Very nice start of the season for him and the team.\n* **Toro Rosso/Alpha Tauri** or whatever should just overhaul their whole strategy team. What a disgrace. And it has been a disgrace for quite a while now. It was the same last season as well, Yuki or Daniel in a good point scoring position? Nooooooo, watch us strategize them into the back of the field. HOW!?!?!? They are frustrating me even more than Ferrari and that is saying something.\n* **Alpine**, honestly not much to say. I feel a bit sorry for Doohan. Didn't really see much from Gasly. Really have no idea where they are in terms of pace.\n* **Aston Martin**, hats off to Stroll. Somehow in a wet race with so many people crashing, he manages to get into the points. The duality of Stroll. Beach yourself on the formation lap in Brazil, somehow survive this race. I just don't understand it lmao very happy for him though. Hopefully this is the start of a better season for him.\n* **Sauber** starting this season a lot better than last year. It seems like at the very least they are free from being the last place team in terms of their pace. Hulk rewarded their trust in him right away with some nice points on his Sauber debut. \n* **Ferrari**. Well Ferrari is doing Ferrari things. First of all I really expected more from them. Especially after Friday. It thought they'd have had the pace to take the fight to McLaren. Maybe they just went wrong in their setup. I hope that them having to raise their ride height isn't going to be a recurring problem this season... Also they really should've followed Max into the pits. \n* **Mercedes** had the driver that impressed me the most yesterday in Antonelli. Yes, he had his spin, yes George was P3 in front of him. Still for his very first race in F1, that was mighty impressive. I'm looking forward to seeing what more he can do in F1. It looks like Mercedes have a bright future with a very talented young driver. George an anonymous in P3 in the end, I don't mean that in a bad way btw. I just don't remember the tv direction showing him at all. He just drove a clean race in no mans land between the McLarens and Max on the one hand and the pack behind Alex behind him. \n* **Red Bull** really should've pitted Lawson a lap earlier. Why do you leave the inexperienced guy out on the mediums that long when McLarens have already skated off track? On the other hand they tried to gamble with Max. It didn't pay off, but it also didn't cost them. The right choice to make at the time. Max got mighty close to Lando in the end due to Lando making an error in turn 6. Like Max said, I don't think he could've gone for an overtake because there really was only one dry line. But it was fun to look at. \n* **McLaren** really are the class of the field. Although I really hope that Australia is an outlier in terms of pace for McLaren. If they are as far up the road in terms of pace and tyre management as it seems, we're in for 2023 part 2 Orange edition. They almost lost the win when both cars went off, but Lando managed to hold on. Oscar also did great to keep his head down and salvaged some points in the end. You never know how close it will be at the end of the season, so maybe those few points will come in clutch in the end."", 'For years we the fans, along with many comentators, pundits, drivers, ex-drivers, and team members have been saying ""just let them race"" when it comes to wet weather racing. After the death of Bianchi, there was a major swing too far in the other direction, and we\'ve had years of knowing the moment there\'s a slight bit of rain it\'ll be red flagged until it\'s almost time for dry tires again, and it\'s been crap.\n\nYesterday seemed like a reversal of this trend, finally. Yes, it wasn\'t as wet as Spa 2021, but we actually saw wet weather racing, and the race wasn\'t red flagged multiple times like it would have been in previous years. When there was a crash, the safety car was released, the track cleared in a few laps, and off we went again. No red flag, no extended delays as they don\'t want a standing start during a 2 lap burst of rain, no arguments over ""he should be able to change tyres under a red flag"", just straight up traditional racing.\n\nPersonally I loved it, and hope race control keep up this trend. I\'m just amazed at the sheer volume of comments in the race thread, and post race thread, about how unsafe everything was, how it should have been red flagged. We can\'t have it both ways, and I definitely prefer the more measured risk acceptance model of racing we saw yesterday.', 'Very impressed with Antonelli.

He wasn't even ahead going into the braking zone! That's got to be up there with his move against Leclerc at Spa last year, and his overtake on Lando at Monza. \n\nA couple of minor points / complaints, but not major:\n\n\\- I wish the inters showed a bit more degradation. Not just in terms of the ability to clear water but actual deg. A lot of races where we race on inters give us very long stints on that tyre. I can only think of Suzuka 2022 where we had drivers box for new inters quite quickly, but perhaps that was because we had consistent rain?\n\n\\- It's a shame we lost so many laps behind the SC's each time, but well done to the marshalls for doing an excellent job clearly up."", 'Credit where credit is due, Lando drove like a champion imo.\n\n\nI said months ago (like others) that I thought Lando couldn\'t get a WDC any time soon. Happy to eat my words now!\n\n\nI think he did a brilliant job in the absolute chaos and pressure that was this weekend. He had to handle all the safety car restarts perfectly, all the rain on track, all the comms with the pit wall, and that very last stretch with a damaged floor. All factors that really limit the advantage of ""just having a fast car"".\n\n\nHope he keeps driving like this for the rest of the season! I\'m becoming a big fan.', ""I can't get over how badly Ferrari fumbled it. Of course they should have come in with the rain, but as soon as they didn't they needed to commit to it. By coming in they just resigned themselves to a low points finish - staying over would have been a gamble but it was like 4 points at stake"", 'I don’t know very much about race direction or how to run a track or what it’s like to be a marshal, and I definitely don’t mean any disrespect toward any of these roles, but I can’t help but feel that the overall management of the weekend was average. It wasn’t just in F1, either. I noticed that the response time for incidents, getting recovery vehicles out, clearing the track, etc. was slow during the other Formula series and the Supercars events as well. Marshals seemed almost lackadaisical at times, standing around or moving slowly, like they weren’t sure what they were supposed to be doing. I can only assume this is some sort of leadership issue since it was happening across the whole weekend. Maybe the people calling the shots didn’t know what they were doing, or communication between areas wasn’t great, or it was particularly difficult to manage getting recovery vehicles onto the circuit due to its layout. I have no idea, so I’m just speculating. It would be great to hear some insight if anyone has any experience working Albert Park.\n\nOverall, I’m appreciative as we all should be to the people who work up to and over the course of the weekend to make the GP happen, but it feels like at times slow decision making delayed us from being able to get back to racing as early as we should have, and that’s never a good thing.']",8,34,1.0,8,32,32,8,34,1.0,8
