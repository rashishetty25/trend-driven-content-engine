Though could it also just be some drivers are better at managing tyres than others which is why someone like Martins or Fornoroli is lower on Quali pace than race pace?\xa0\n\nAs for Formula 1, Lindblad and Dunne are the only guys on the current F2 grid that look like F1 quality drivers. I would go as far as saying Lindblad is 90% gonna have a race seat next season because he‚Äôs next in the wings to go to Racing Bulls and I cannot see Verstappen, Tsunoda and Lawson all being in the Red Bull camp next year.\xa0\n\nIf Max stays Yuki‚Äôs out as they‚Äôll put Hadjar in Red Bull and I doubt Yuki is going back to the b team. And Lawson‚Äôs been the worst performer out of the four this year.\xa0\n\nIf Max goes then theres a spot available. If he replaces Russell it may be a straight swap. But if I was George I‚Äôd got to Aston over RB. If Max replaced Kimi then Toto could try and get Kimi into the Alpine or as a reserve driver. Theres question marks over whether Kimi and his camp would want to keep ties with Toto if he got replaced after 1 year.\n\nTLDR - Lindblad‚Äôs almost defo gonna have \xa0an F1 spot next year.\xa0\n\nNow for Dunne. Dunne has impressed me more than anyone in F2 this year. Yes he makes mistakes but F1 teams prefer a rookie who makes mistakes but is super fast than a rookie who is consistently solid but doesn‚Äôt have that pure pace like Zhou.\xa0\n\nBut Dunne has a few things out of his control that are going against him. He‚Äôs arrived in a season where nearly all the F1 teams seem nailed down for 2026 and those who aren‚Äôt have other options. It‚Äôs sort of the opposite of last season Im F2 where anyone who had a good year could get into F1. This season is a case of right place wrong time.\xa0\n\nAnother problem for Dunne is that I‚Äôve read an interview with him where he‚Äôs said that he probably won‚Äôt have the funds to do another year of F2. This year might be his only shot. \xa0\n\nSo if he‚Äôs not in F2 next year (which could be a year of more change on the F1 grid) he might be forgotten, similarly to Pourchaire, though he did not do it in his first season (If Pourchaire was a year later he‚Äôd probably be in F1).\xa0\n\nI hope for Dunne‚Äôs sake, as an Irish fan who‚Äôs never seen someone from my country in F1, that he gets a shot. However let‚Äôs see if he‚Äôs able to keep up the good form.', 'Yeah it feels like Lindblad is 99% confirmed for a F1 seat next year. And Dunne has impressed me the most as a rookie when also considering that he has dealt with possible funding issues in previous years before joining McLaren‚Äôs academy last year. There is no place for Dunne on the grid next year but hopefully he can continue to make a strong challenge for the championship, and then get more opportunities next year as McLaren‚Äôs reserve driver with more FP1s. Then by 2027 potentially get a full time seat secured somewhere. Piastri himself won F2 as a rookie in 2021 and didn‚Äôt have a seat in 2022 but it seems to have worked out well for him. \n\nThose two definitely have the most potential to become credible F1 drivers, but the rest of the grid isn‚Äôt that bad imo. Martins is the most prominent one for me because I believe he has the raw pace to get into F1, but his funding hasn‚Äôt been that good which held him back a few years and he isn‚Äôt able to consistently convert that qualifying pace into good points whether it‚Äôs due to tire management, racecraft, or sheer back luck (taken out by Dunne when he took the lead at Monaco as one example). His opportunity has passed unfortunately but Martins is definitely talented enough to have a good career in another category even if it isn‚Äôt F1.', 'Lawson so far has been better than Yuki wtf are you talking about? üòÇ', 'Im not saying the rest of the grid is bad, just no one stands out as F1 worthy. It‚Äôs probably not the worst grid ever, how do you think it compares to 2020-2023?', 'Oh that specific comment wasn‚Äôt directed at you, but I did see a few comments in previous F2 posts saying this year‚Äôs grid is the worst in a long time just cause Verschoor who is in his 5th year and is honestly an above average F2 driver is leading the championship. \n\nI only started following F2 in 2021. I would say 2021‚Äôs grid is definitely better, 2023‚Äôs grid is slightly better, and 2022 is comparable to this year‚Äôs grid. \n\nSo the grid overall might not have that many top end talents, but I think part of that is also determined by hindsight bias because we know that there are hardly any available seats for 2026. I do feel so far this year‚Äôs grid is rather aggressive and we‚Äôve seen some crazy incidents already, some of which have also included Dunne.']",88,6,0.95,88,41,41,4,0,0.0,4

I'm aware he was the GP2 champ in 2012, and was the reserve driver for Lotus.

I also remember that a bunch of people said he should have been tapped to replace Raikonnen in the last couple of races in the season when he hurt his back (ie when he refused to race because Lotus wasn't paying him) but they pulled Kovalainen out of retirement instead.

After that Davide found himself without a drive, and didn't have any serious sponsors so he went to go race sportscars until the Italian media hired him.","['They often say a third year GP2/F2 champ is not good enough for F1. Valsecchi won it in his fifth season...', 'Not very good. Only won GP2/F2 in his fifth season.', 'Far better at the time than modern takes on the past care to recall. \n\nPeople will argue fifth year champion, and base an argument on simple statistics. But they never give the full story of who he was, how he raced, or who he raced against. \n\nThe years he competed in GP2 were ultra competitive and incredibly exciting. I got to commentate on them, and they were genuinely incredible. \n\nHe began with Durango, who were never a top team and took a win in his rookie season, in a field where every other race winner either had or would go on to race in F1 save for Conway who had a stellar Indycar and WEC career and Parente who as F3 and World Series champion was highly regarded at the time. \n\n09 was all about H√ºlkenberg, Maldonado, Grosjean and Van der Garde. He won the Asia series over the winter but 10 ended up being all about Perez and Maldonado. 11 he didn‚Äôt have the team. And so it was 12 where it all came together. \n\nHe won 4 races. 3 at the early double header in Bahrain where he was ridiculous. His final win didn‚Äôt come until the end of the year at Monza. His success came from consistency. And from an innate ability to feel the tyres, conserve them and then blast the end of races. Something which was of deep importance in that generation of F1. \n\nBut it was how he raced that left the greatest impression. You could feel his joy extend through every turn of the wheel. He was electrifying. Always thrilling, always at the limit. When Davide was on track the potential for magic always existed. He was an utter joy to watch race. \n\nHe took the reserve drive at Lotus, at the height of the team‚Äôs mess. And the team‚Äôs decision to pick Kovalainen over him at season‚Äôs end was both a surprise and, to many in the paddock, a disgrace. He had done his time and earned his chance. \n\nWas Davide a mega? Few were or are. In that era of GP2, Grosjean was. Hulkenberg was considered to be. I will argue to my last breath that Pantano was beyond exceptional. But was Davide on the same level as Maldonado, Perez, Van der Garde? You bet he was. \n\nDavide was one of the rare few who made you feel something when he raced.

The development package‚Äîincluding a new floor designed to widen the set‚Äëup window‚Äîproved successful, with the car responding well and emerging as the second‚Äëstrongest force, while Mercedes and Red\u202fBull fell further back. ‚ÄúIt was important to see on track what we had studied in the Maranello wind tunnel,‚Äù Jerome\u202fD‚ÄôAmbrosio confirmed, referring to what he called an ‚Äúauxiliary‚Äù upgrade for the SF‚Äë25‚Äîthough it is more accurately a precursor to later evolutionary steps, among them the introduction of an updated rear suspension. ‚ÄúWe shall see,‚Äù Jerome concluded, hinting at the forthcoming mechanical changes. In any case, Ferrari‚Äôs technical department already has a plan for fitting the new parts.\n\nJuly is likely to bring the team‚Äôs second filming day of the year, a savvy move that will allow them to test the revised rear suspension: 200\u202fkm of running to evaluate five months of work.\n\nThe true structural issue around which Ferrari has re‚Äëoriented the SF‚Äë25 project is the rear suspension, whose new configuration has been in development since the start of the season. Lo√Øc\xa0Serra‚Äôs decision to devote resources to a flawed concept stems from his belief in the car‚Äôs ‚Äúuntapped potential‚Äù, which the new mechanical component is chiefly intended to unlock. It is no simple task and has required re‚Äëexamining several upstream design choices‚Äînever trivial when trying to straighten out a technical package. As we analyse in our dedicated YouTube video, it has demanded extensive deliberation and time, all while working within the constraints of the technical and financial regulations and persisting with a car that is nearing the end of its regulatory cycle. Validating the new suspension architecture is essential yet far from straightforward, which is why Ferrari has already scheduled a 200\u202fkm filming day at Mugello in July, running the SF‚Äë25 fitted with the new rear hardware.\n\nThe test will call for a critical, in‚Äëdepth study of real‚Äëworld data gathered on track and will serve as a genuine validation examination of the new component. Only after this filming day will Ferrari decide definitively whether‚Äîand when‚Äîto introduce the new suspension. Choosing the other company‚Äëowned circuit, Mugello, rather than Fiorano, is clearly strategic: the Tuscan track offers technical characteristics that more closely represent a race circuit, with high‚Äëenergy corners like the Arrabbiata 1 and 2 and altitude changes that stress the car‚Äôs platform more realistically. Such conditions will provide data that are far more useful for mechanically calibrating the new suspension layout‚Äîdata that would be less meaningful at Fiorano. As team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur has hinted, if all goes to plan, the change should help the SF‚Äë25 keep the rear under better control, ensuring a more stable aero‚Äëmechanical platform and a broader operating window‚Äîone of the major weaknesses at the start of this season.\n\nThis strategy explains why Silverstone is not a suitable window for the race debut of the new rear suspension. Nor will the SF‚Äë25 receive significant novelties in Britain; instead, the team will continue to study the new floor and aim to extract maximum potential from that package. Ferrari has chosen a measured approach to introducing the new component‚Äîparticularly as, in Mercedes‚Äôs case, an updated rear suspension did not immediately yield an optimised upgrade. Moreover, being overly aggressive and relying solely on theory‚Äîif not blind faith‚Äîcould do more harm than good.']",43,4,0.96,43,3,3,43,4,0.96,43

""The irony is that results do not appear to be that important at the moment as the value of F1 teams is skyrocketing because there is huge demand and a limited supply. The investment world seems to be convinced that live sport will flourish forever and that the value of teams will follow the same trend as NFL, NBA and MLB franchises that are now getting astonishing valuations.  I have heard of at least five groups that have expressed interest since de Meo departed in buying the team. It makes sense as it would rid Renault of a big headache ‚Äì and put some money back into the balance sheet.

I hear that Red Bull recently turned down someone‚Äôs bid of $1.5 billion to buy Racing Bulls.

1lqikat,About the Redbull and Verstappen situation..,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lqikat/about_the_redbull_and_verstappen_situation/,2025-07-03, Discussion,".. I struggle to comprehend the main critics I see everywhere about that.

Let me explain; 
Everyone says that next year Redbull without Verstappen Will be a mid tier team AT BEST and that Redbull failed to give verstappen a decent car in the past 2 years.


Fine.

I can understand this critic if, for example, max leaves tomorrow and is replaced by anyone.
Then yes, Redbull is a low tier team because it has built a car that only Verstappen che drive.

But next year? Next year everything changes, completely.
He'll, I even expect that, since the driving technique changes, the top 10 list of drivers won't be the same as this year for the simple  fact that everyone will have to learn a new and different way of driving.

I can even expect a, let's say, Ollie Barman best on the grid because he grasped more than anyone else the new driving hybrid style. (That's an example).

But the main thing is: next year everyone will have a completely new car. How do we know that we won't have a RB19 2.0? Why is everyone so sure that the aero of the car will suck?

I can understand the speculations about the engine but, they are, in fact, speculations.

Another thing is: Redbull has a poor car mainly because of Verstappen, everyone says that, even them.

They saw that Verstappen was doing good and didn't address problems that, for example , Perez noticed.

If Verstappen is not on the team I doubt they will build a Verstappen car, they'll build a more ""standard"" and balanced car.

He'll, I'd even dare to say that Merc would probably face the problem that Redbull has now with the Verstappen style car.


Those are my 2 cents.

(For context, I'm an avid Redbull and Verstappen fan, i love F1 because of them, I'm trying to not be biased on neither of them)

EDIT: I am not saying it's Verstappen's fault if the car sucks this year, it's a team problem, and the championship won last year is solely because of Verstappen's skills.

Not doubt in that!","['> the top 10 list of drivers won‚Äôt even be the same\n\nExtremely doubt.', ""I don't think his intention is to leave. It might be a plan B, but I don't think it's the intention.\n\nAccording to AMuS, the Verstappen camp is unhappy with the wide-ranging power wielded by Horner and would like to move toward a more decentralized structure. Horner is supported mainly by Chalerm Yoovidhya, a Thai billionaire who owns 51% of Red Bull. \n\nI believe that these rumours are mostly to put pressure on Chalerm to curtail Horner's power which seems in line with the reports by AMuS.\n\nBut we'll see."", ""I think you've placed too much emphasis on 'driving style changes'. Conceptually the cars are similar, and throughout F1 history there's not been these huge shakeups in who is a quick driver when there are regulation changes. I'd also caveat that by saying we have one of the strongest grids in years, given the right car everyone on the grid could win a race right now.\xa0"", ""I take it you are relatively new to F1?\n\nWe've been through many of these changes before, and the best drivers before a change of regulations are the best drivers after a change of regulations. The order of teams may get shaken up to start with, but the top drivers are the top drivers.\n\nThe Red Bull is unforgiving, and for years has needed all weekend to fine tune it to make it a leading car. Brain drain has made it harder to prep the car ready for Qualifying each race, and when you have a car that will snap your hand off if you push it too far, you need a great driver to get close to the limit, and keep it there for a full race."", "">\xa0Another thing is: Redbull has a poor car mainly because of Verstappen, everyone says that, even them.\n\n\nThey don't have a poor car because of Verstappen.\n\n\nThey have a poor car that only Max can drive.\xa0"", ""The 2026 car didn't start development yesterday, It's been designed with the thought that Max is staying till 2028. So it will be a complete do over in that regard. Regulation changes are the most interesting times in F1, so we're bound to be surprised by someone regardless."", ""Max knows everything there is to know about the Red Bull project. I think if he doesn't go to Mercedes we can assume that Red Bull are probably going to be alright in 2026."", 'well what do you know about the car?', '> If Verstappen is not on the team I doubt they will build a Verstappen car, they\'ll build a more ""standard"" and balanced car.\n\nThey built the car this way because its the only way they can get it to be fast. If they could make it nice and balanced while still getting the performance they would do so.\n\nMaybe they will strike gold again next season, but if you had to make a prediction there are many more reasons to predict they won\'t. Lots of brain drain over the past few years, they\'ve been struggling with development the last few years. They\'re also first time engine constructors.\n\n> He\'ll, I\'d even dare to say that Merc would probably face the problem that Redbull has now with the Verstappen style car.\n\nAgain.
