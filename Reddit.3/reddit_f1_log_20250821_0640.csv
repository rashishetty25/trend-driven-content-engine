1mv96jx,Looking back at the criticism regarding Sauber promoting Zhou into F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mv96jx/looking_back_at_the_criticism_regarding_sauber/,2025-08-20, Discussion,"It seems like a long time ago, but I remember back in 2021 when the rumours that Zhou would be promoted to Sauber began. I remember the fury that people possessed in this very sub that he would be getting the drive over other drivers.

To be fair, it wasn't without reason. 2020 saw Nicholas Latifi get promoted to Williams, whilst 2021 saw Mazepin get promoted to Haas. Pay drivers in F1 is nothing new, but here we have two drivers severely underdeliver in their rookie seasons, and the prospect of a third rookie driver there to yet again underdeliver spectacularly wasn't very promising.

What makes it even worse were that other drivers with more convincing resumes weren't being considered for F1 at all. The most obvious example being Oscar Piastri not getting the seat, despite him winning F2 in his rookie year. People were furious that Zhou got the Sauber seat over him. Granted, by Piastri's own admission, he was never in contention for that seat, but you could certainly understand why people were annoyed.

It wasn't just Piastri though. I remember people being disappointed that Theo Pourchaire wasn't given a crack at the whip, with many people touting him at the time of being a star of the future. Nick De Vries was also a name that came up a bunch in the initial Sauber 2022 rumours, and I remember people really hoping that he'd get the seat over Zhou.

The point being, Zhou getting promoted to Sauber wasn't a very popular decision, and many expected him to be on the level as Latifi and Mazepin. I even recall a few comments on this sub predicting him to be *worse* than Mazepin. All of this made me all the more happy for Zhou when he scored a point in his very first race, and proceeded to be a perfectly competent driver for the rest of his career.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not touting Zhou to be a wonder kid or anything, but he was nowhere close to being considered one of the worse drivers in F1, and he was miles better than Mazepin and Latifi. Zhou was able to score points in all three of his seasons for Sauber, which isn't anything to snub at considering the quality of the car in 2024 in particular, and whilst Bottas was definitely better than him, he didn't completely annihilate him the way a bunch of us were expecting.

I think another thing to point out is that a lot of the fury of all the other drivers not making it to that Sauber seat doesn't really exist anymore. Piastri made it to F1 the following year with McLaren with very little else needing to be said about that move. De Vries did eventually make it to F1, but he undeniably underdelivered, and whilst Pourchairre sadly didn't make it to F1, I'd argue he never really grew as a driver as much as he was expected to, following his initial F2 season. Yes he was talented enough for F1, but I'd argue he wouldn't have been the superstar that everyone at the time was predicting him to be.

Throughout Zhou's career in F1, the quote ""he's proven that he deserves to be in F1"" was spoken out a lot, and the main reason for that is that prior to his debut in 2022, a lot of people didn't believe that. He may not have been the very best, but for China's first F1 driver, he did a remarkable job representing his country, and he was a whole lot better than many other drivers that proceeded and succeeded him, which had far more compelling resumes.","[""It's difficult if you aren't part of an academy to get a good seat in F1."", 'If you want to go and read something funny, in 2020 people here were pissed that Renault picked Alonso instead of Zhou to replace Ricciardo.', ""It also helped him that he is geuinely likable person and having Bottas guiding him in all areas...  Bottas 2.0 was in full swing, his media game is strong and a lot of that spilled over to Zhou's corner, they were popular driver pairing.\n\nI think he did just fine, not stellar but fine job. He was instantly hired as reserve driver by Ferrari too."", 'I think disappointment at Giovinazzi not working out drove some of the anti-Zhou commentary, and sinophobia was likely an element with some people. As an Alfa supporter I was happy to be a Zhou supporter.\n\nSomehow his last year was the most disappointing, although hard to disentangle that from how awful the team was between Vasseur and Binotto.', ""People just really, really dislike pay drivers. A lot more of the latest batch rookies are well received because they performed highly in junior series as well as F1. Getting promoted after finishing away from the top in F2 while the champion barely gets a free practice session just doesn't feel right.\n\n\nZhou has been very fortunate. Drivers have been sacked for way less."", ""Did Latifi and Mazepin under deliver? Sure they weren't good at all - Mazepin especially seeming to not even understand certain things about the sport - but that era Williams and that era Haas are likely the two worst cars we've seen on the grid since contraction to 10 teams. What exactly were they expected to do? I think they were exactly what was anticipated, which were unproven drivers who didn't belong spinning out and crashing in some of the worst cars the sport has ever seen."", ""Zhou was solidly mid. He probably wouldn't have gotten there without money (that's true of many drivers), but he didn't embarrass himself while he was in the sport. Certainly not the worst driver of the last few years. Ultimately he replaced Giovinazzi, who had multiple years in the sport and the only thing I remember him doing is spinning at Spa for no obvious reason, I can see why Sauber went for average+money over average"", 'He exceeded the very low expectations in his first two years, sure. But, for whatever reason, he was as bad as people thought he initially would be last year. He qualified 3 tenths off 19th at Monza, two tenths at Miami, half a second at Monaco, 3 tenths in Canada, two tenths in Austria, half a second at Spa, half a second at Singapore, 4 tenths at Mexico, 6 tenths at Brazil. He qualified more than half a second off Bottas on\xa0**NINE**\xa0occasions.', 'I’m sorry but being slightly better than Latifi does not prove that he was good enough for F1.

No boring drs overtakes, no overheating tyres, just two drivers at the top of their game fighting for lap after lap.\xa0\n\n\nThis is the race I often use as example of why the number of overtakes is not important.\xa0', '...how do you think Michael got up to P2..? \n\nYes, overtaking was incredibly hard back then, maybe even harder than today due to even more dirty air and no drs but the reason why this race is so special is because Michael was 100% on it, overtaking cars on track and having demonic pace while Fernando was able to hold him up somehow.', 'The Ferrari was so much faster, it looked inevitable that day', ""Alonso's engine had been damaged in Bahrain, and was effectively running with [one cylinder down](https://youtu.be/vUMYzXiSgH0?feature=shared&t=47).    His qualifying lap that weekend was only his 11th lap that full weekend, as they were looking after the engine, and the car was never flat out that weekend."", 'Michael got up to P2 because of a powerful overcut that made him vault up from 12th to 3rd after the pit stops. He was stuck behind his brother for what, 20 laps? Who are the cars that Michael overtook on track?']",75,15,0.97,75,14,14,28,4,-0.010000000000000009,28
1mvx6am,Sauber cannot morally show up with a Kick livery at Zandvoort.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mvx6am/sauber_cannot_morally_show_up_with_a_kick_livery/,2025-08-21, Discussion,"We're talking about driving around with the colours of a website that platforms human torture, literal livestreamed death of people, and on top of that the physical abuse of homeless people and animals. The list of offenses that the lack of moderation on this website has produced was already too long before Sauber signed this deal, but certainly it is now beyond the pale.

Where is the discussion about this on the F1 sub? Where is the outrage? As an F1 fan for almost 10 years now, I can do no more than insist on a discussion because it is important to me that people in this sport care about more than how fast the car goes. Where the money comes from has to matter. And I get that it hasn't mattered often. I get that Kick is not the first questionable sponsor in the history of F1. But among questionable sponsors, it is certainly among the worst, if not the literal worst.

A man was tortured to death on stream. When he died, his chat laughed. Are we gonna force Hulk and Bortoleto to drive around in the colours of a platform like this?","['Boy wait til I tell you about Saudi Arabia...', 'We race in countries that fund/execute genocide my guy', ""Formula One has never and will never care where the money comes from. They take money from actual dictatorships. They take money from countries where gay people get thrown off of buildings. They take money from people that have journalists chopped up in embassies. They. Don't. Care. \n\nIf you DO care then it's best just to not support them at all"", 'Sauber cars are covered in paint manufactured by R-M, a subsidiary of German chemical giant BASF, who during WWII made a chemical called Zyklon-B, which was used in gas chambers to murder millions of people.\n\nAnd then there’s ARAMCO, state-owned by a country that continually violates human rights, plastered at every racetrack.\n\nAnd DuPont.\n\nAnd Palantir.\n\nAnd Marlboro.\n\nAnd a shit ton of shady organizations that F1 continues to get into bed with. They won’t care until we stop watching.', ""I'm afraid that's just a drop in the bucket for F1 sponsors. DuPont, which was linked with multiple deaths and various other cases, sponsored Renault. Saudi Aramco sponsors Aston. Hell, fucking Palantir sponsors Ferrari. That's just a few off the top of my head. Hell some of us called Checo the King of the (human rights violation) streets. \n\nPersonally I'm glad to see the concern though, and I think we should not be discouraged from calling out these dubious partners. But yeah there is a long, long way to go for human rights in F1."", 'Will Kick be gone next year when Audi takes over?', 'Did something specific cause you to single out Zandvoort, or is this a general stance?', ""Sorry OP, but bad news for you. Kick will be the main sponsor in Zandvoort. Sauber have to remove Stake from the livery and team kits because gambling advertising is not allowed in the Netherlands. Last year they were asked to remove it but didn't, this year it is a requirement. Per Erik van Haren:\n\n>Stake is an online betting company, and advertising for it is no longer permitted in the Netherlands. Therefore, Sauber will not use that brand in its advertising at Zandvoort, neither on the car nor on the team kits. Next week, the name Kick, the team's other major sponsor, will be most prominently displayed."", 'You know, I think you are right that it is fucked up. 100%\nHowever I can’t see them hiding their title sponsor']",0,125,0.46,0,112,112,0,5,0.0,0
