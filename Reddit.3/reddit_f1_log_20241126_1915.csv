They argue that if Formula 1 really was worried about the Department of Justice investigation, then they probably would have bowed sooner and the bid would be much closer to what Andretti originally proposed. Instead, Michael Andretti is out, Mario Andretti is relegated to a non-executive board position, and GM have agreed to pay more than double the original anti-dilution feed. Formula 1 got practically everything they wanted, which doesn't make much sense if they were running scared from the Department of Justice.\n\n*Autosport* have put forward [this piece](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/why-general-motors-has-got-the-green-light-that-andretti-did-not/10676534/) explaining why the team got in, and this part stood out to me:\n\n>Autosport understands that key to getting F1 interested was in Towriss working with General Motors to change the nature of the deal. So where originally it was an Andretti car that would eventually hope to run a General Motors engine, but would have customer Renaults to begin with, the project being put on the table now is nothing like that. This is now for a General Motors car, that would likely become a full works team from 2028 ‚Äì even if initially it means customer\xa0[Ferrari](https://www.autosport.com/team/ferrari/36466/)\xa0or Honda engines in the interim.\n\nIt sounds to me like Andretti and GM weren't as close as we were lead to believe, though whether we were intentionally mislead or if we just believed what we wanted to is a) unclear and b) beside the point. It sounds like Andretti wanted to enter his team and GM had the option of developing an engine to supply them with from 2028, but they weren't obligated to provide it. So if the Andretti team wasn't doing as well as expected or if they could get a better deal from an existing supplier, then GM would be able to write off or repurpose whatever engine development they had done. If I'm being charitable, then I have to say that that feels a bit misleading because Andretti's complaint was that they were being frozen out, but giving GM the option of engaging means that they weren't being completely honest. At worst, it sounds like a bit of a Trojan horse where Andretti uses the promise of an GM engine to enter the sport in 2028, but they never have the intention of using a GM engine -- and they get to keep their entry even when the GM engine never materialises.\n\nThat might sound like splitting hairs, but it would go a long way towards explaining why Formula 1 never really responded to the investigation and how they were able to broker a new deal with GM directly instead of capitulating and letting Andretti in on his terms."", 'Fom always stated that a entry of GM would maybe be successful. They dumped andretti and made it a full gm team‚Ä¶ thsts why they succeeded. The rejection of andretti had a paragraph saying that a future bid of an gm worksteam or more heavy involved team would maybe change the outcome']",22,59,0.72,22,46,46,3,1,0.020000000000000018,3
