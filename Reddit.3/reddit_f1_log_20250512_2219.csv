1kkr2e5,Court documents appear to confirm Peter de Putron is Williams' real owner,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kkr2e5/court_documents_appear_to_confirm_peter_de_putron/,2025-05-12, Discussion,"A few years ago, the F1 journalist Joe Saward wrote [an article](https://joesaward.wordpress.com/2022/05/31/green-notebook-from-solarium-beach/) in which he identified Peter de Putron, an extremely reclusive financier and investor, as the ultimate owner of the Williams F1 team. Saward wrote:

>Back in the summer of 2020, when the Williams team was sold to Dorilton Capital, there was much interest and speculation about who was behind the mysterious investment firm. It was based in New York, but was clearly not an American firm. It was identified only as being a private investment office for an unidentified high worth family.

>I got a tip that the buyer was a Jersey-based entrepreneur called Peter de Putron, but no-one in the team would talk about whether these stories were true. De Putron is so reclusive that there does not seem to be a single photograph of him on the Internet, which makes it quite hard to identify him. ‚Ä¶

>Anyway, to cut a long story short I am certain that de Putron is the man behind Dorilton ‚Äì and I‚Äôll not post any pictures of him because he does not want to be famous.

Saward is a divisive character and it seems some people were suspicious as the source of his 'tip', but I recently came across a [court transcript](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2025/2025-ny-slip-op-30605-u.html) which does appear to prove him right. These court documents relate to an [ongoing lawsuit](https://archive.is/97mXe) brought by Williams' former marketing director, Claudia Schwartz, against [James Matthews](https://www.williamsf1.com/team/james-matthews), another financier and Williams board member (and Pippa Middleton's husband, if you're interested in that sort of thing).

Schwartz's lawyers (based on, among things, testimony from Jost Capito, Williams' former team principal), reveal that:

* de Putron approves (or at least approved) all budgets for Williams Grand Prix Engineering
* Capito was told never to use de Putron's name in discussions about Williams, being informed by the board that ""Peter De Putron is in the background and doesn‚Äôt want to be known or seen that he‚Äôs the owner of Williams""
* Despite this, de Putron is referred to as ""ODL"" (Our Dear Leader) internally
* de Putron is publicly the owner of another Williams-related company, Williams IP Holdings LLC
* The plaintiffs (Dorilton and Williams) tried to prevent de Putron's name being revealed by arguing he is merely ‚Äúan outside investor‚Äù and not the owner

They further conclude that de Putron makes ""all significant decisions‚Äù for both Dorilton Capital Management and Williams Grand Prix Engineering.

The court documents are [freely available](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2025/2025-ny-slip-op-30605-u.html) if you want to dive in further.

De Putron himself seems like an interesting and well-connected character with all kinds of links to politicians and various high-flyers. He is the brother in law of Andrea Leadsom, the former UK health minister, and was at Wharton business school with Matthew Savage, the founder of Dorilton.

It should be noted that Dorilton denies de Putron being involved with Williams in any way, despite Jost Capito's testimony.","[""It's been a minute since we've had a genuine mystery man in F1 at such a high level.

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.
