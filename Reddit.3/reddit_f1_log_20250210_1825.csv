This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our¬†[guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our¬†[FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H√§kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

My picks would be Jerez 86 and Monaco 89', 'I‚Äôve only seen his races from 1990 onwards and a handful from before, but Hungary 91 must surely rank highly on either a post-89 or full career basis. He simply had to have that race as the Hungaroring seemed like the only remaining circuit where McLaren could realistically compete with Williams. To put the car on pole by 1.2 seconds and then manage the race as well as he did - in a manner more commonly associated with Prost, dare I suggest - was absolutely tremendous.', ""I am almost positive that Pirelli assigns the dates for the tyre tests, so I wouldn't include them, really. A lot of teams have rookies this year, or at least drivers changing team, and Aston doesn't. McLaren also doesn't, and I heard about them doing testing, but I think it was an assigned tyre test? Though I wouldn't be surprised if they did some TPC just because. \n\nI don't recall either Red Bull team doing TPC except with Yuki involved. I heard that Honda charges a lot fr those engines. Lawson's only half a rookie, and they are sometimes sink or swim anyway.\n\nI don't think Haas has ever done TPC before this year, but Toyota is covering it now. Antonelli's got about 10,000km in the Mercedes now- obviously almost all of it last year, since current drivers are limited to 1000km a year.""]",13,22,0.82,13,18,18,-1,1,-0.040000000000000036,-1
1imb98k,We are expanding the r/formula1 moderator team. Applications are now open!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1imb98k/we_are_expanding_the_rformula1_moderator_team/,2025-02-10, Meta,"Hey r/formula1,

It has been a very long time, almost 4 years, since our last round of moderator recruitment. Back then we were only at 1.5 million members. Since then not only has the subreddit tripled in size, but after the 2023 Reddit Blackout multiple members of the mod team had left and since then the rest of us had also come close to being burnt out. So with all that and with an exciting 2025 season on the horizon it's time for a new round of moderator recruitment.

The qualifications to become a moderator are very simple:

* be a motorsports fan
* use reddit

The expectations for the new moderators are to be transparent, to be communicative and to be reasonably active. We have a guideline of 300 mod actions per month, but don't let this stop you from applying. **Real life always comes before Reddit** and just let the rest of the team know if you need a break.

After the form is closed we will evaluate the applications, compile a shortlist and invite those candidates to an interview. The interview will be conducted as an audio or video call. After the interview we will make the final selection of moderators and we hope to be able to onboard them by the Japanese GP at the start of April.

The applications will close on the 22nd of February at 23:00 UTC

[**Link to the application form**](https://forms.gle/gHS5HKHDWNbpJzXs8)

If you have any questions or doubts feel free to ask in the comments.

   * Yes. It has been 4 years!
* **Do you need to have moderation experience?**
   * No, it's not an issue if you don't have moderator experience yet.

* **Is there any compensation for moderation?**
   * Absolutely none. This is a volunteer role","['Hey Mods, please change ‚ÄúHonda RBPT‚Äù flair back to just Honda. \n\nThere are lots of Honda fans, and maybe two Honda RBPTs fans. \n\nThanks.', 'Not applying for this, but taking the opportunity to thank you all for the hard work you put into this community.', '6 upvotes on a pinned comment after 50 mins is crazy', 'I am one RBPT fan']",6,4,0.6,6,4,4,6,4,0.6,6
