In other words, Hadjar\'s career shouldn\'t be cut at the root either. ""But Isack is different,"" Marko replied.\n\n> The 82-year-old top adviser says he saw the latter again during the racing weekend in the Netherlands. ""On Friday he had engine problems. One session was completely missed and the other average. But I wasn\'t worried at all. He even said to me, \'I\'ve got the speed, I\'ll rank in the top five.\'"" Hadjar has kept his word and that, according to Marko, marks the mental strength of the sister team driver. So when asked if the 20-year-old talent will be able to withstand the pressure of Red Bull\'s second seat, Marko nods affirmatively.\n\n> However, Red Bull are in no hurry to make a final choice and do not want to do so with excitement now. Marko has already indicated that he will wait until October anyway, with the Mexican Grand Prix as a possible point of reference. Yuki Tsunoda can still prove his worth until then, and Marko has been clear after being asked what exactly he expects from the Japanese: ""Consistency and performance.""\n\n> In Zandvoort, Tsunoda had exactly the same specification as Verstappen, but failed to turn that into a position in Q3. During the tumultuous race, the Japanese had to settle for the P9, although Marko does not want to judge too harshly. ""He had bad luck with the security car. Yuki had just changed his tyres and two laps later the safety car left. That put him in the grid tail, but otherwise he didn\'t do anything wrong either.""', ""Bold statement from him, considering that he's still under RB"", 'I feel like he would have given more time if it looked like there was a better chance of seeing that progress.\n\nAt the very least he should have been given until Japan and let him race on a track he has actually been to before.', 'I mean, very naive, no?

1n5trk2,My Experience with Disabilities at the Dutch Grand Prix – Accessibility in F1 Needs Serious Attention,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n5trk2/my_experience_with_disabilities_at_the_dutch/,2025-09-01, Discussion,"Hi all,
I wanted to share my experience attending the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix as someone living with Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, in the hope it raises awareness around how inaccessible F1 events can be for fans with disabilities.
This was my first Grand Prix, and I was so excited to finally go. I’d booked the F1 Experiences Live Pit Straight package (not exactly a budget ticket) and reached out months in advance to explain my needs – mainly urgent toilet access and limited mobility when walking fast or through crowds. I made it really clear that I carry a ""Can’t Wait"" card due to my Crohn’s and need bathroom access urgently at times.

Here’s how it went:
Thursday – Track Experience Day:
No seating in the main areas during waiting times for the pit walk or guest appearances. I had to stand for hours, which caused joint pain.

No visible bathrooms near the food trucks, so I avoided eating altogether in case I needed the toilet quickly.
The pit lane walk was late in the day, and most garages were closing down due to curfew – it felt like others who went earlier got a more engaging experience.

Friday–Sunday – Race Days:
My grandstand seat (Row 2, Seat 134 on the Pit Straight Grandstand) was not near the extra care court, despite requests. I had to walk through heavy crowds to reach it – not ideal when you physically can’t move fast or stand comfortably.
On Saturday, I had an arthritis flare-up and couldn’t make it back to my seat. I spent most of the day in the care court instead.

The extra care court staff were amazing – they offered me a chair and even helped with ice for my knee. But I missed out on watching most of the race from my actual seat because it was just too far from the bathroom.
The bigger issue:

It honestly feels like basic accessibility at F1 events is tied to VIP ticket levels. If you want decent toilet access, seating support, or less walking, you have to spend thousands. That’s not right.

Accessible event planning shouldn’t be treated as a luxury add-on. I paid over £1,400 for my ticket and still ended up spending half the weekend worrying about whether I could reach a toilet in time.

As a fan, a content creator, and someone living with chronic illness, I want to enjoy the sport I love without feeling like I don’t belong at the track. And I know I’m not the only one.


Final thoughts:
F1 needs to do better. Accessibility shouldn't depend on how much you can afford. I’d love to see:
Clearly marked accessible toilets and seating near all grandstands.
Disability support staff onsite for guidance.
More flexibility in seating assignments for those who request help in advance.

Actual disability liaison contacts for fans planning to attend.
I’ll be sharing more content about my experience to raise awareness, but I wanted to start here. If you’ve had a similar experience or know of other venues doing accessibility well, I’d love to hear about it.


Thanks for reading – feel free to share or comment if you think this is a conversation F1 needs to keep having.

Edit: when I say private bathrooms I mean a disabled bathroom
I am also not asking for anything I am just raising awareness for other disabled guest who want to go to a F1 Grand Prix","['I sympathize with you because I was at the Dutch GP and it was very difficult to navigate the crowds and the foot traffic at times. \n\nHonestly though I can’t imagine trying to attend an event like this with Crohns. I grew up attending large sporting events (major league baseball, football, hockey, and basketball) and this is my second F1 GP. I’ve also been to Wacken Open Air festival in Germany with 90k people. Bathrooms are always a problem at any event of this kind. I personally felt that bathroom access at the Dutch GP was decent and better than at Suzuka. The problem wasn’t accessibility per se (we sat in the pit grand stands, row 1, pretty close to you actually) as we were able to reach them quickly. The problem is simply the sheer volume of people. Foot traffic was insane. It took forever to get anywhere and going from our section (126/127) to where the extra care court was located would have taken a bit outside of going when F1 was on track. \n\nHow could they have done this better? The only thing I can think of would have been simply having more bathrooms and perhaps keep some maintained strictly for folks with urgent needs. But I don’t think they did a poor job, it’s just the reality of events this size.\n\nI think the biggest thing they could and should do would be to manage foot traffic. There’s no gates, lanes, or anything to direct people either in the circuit or outside on the way to the train stations. Just a giant clusterfuck of people jostling their way through. Completely the opposite experience to Japan and it made the whole experience much less pleasant, especially since I get anxiety in large crowds.', 'Did you consider buying tickets for the extra care platform?\n\nMy experience there on Sunday was very good. True the seating was on ground level so not the best view. But near accessible toilets and with personel for care.\n\nAgree that accessible toilets should be available for every ticket option.\n\nAddition: The Netherlands is behind general accessibility. But F1 is regarded as one of the most accessible event of the country. They let an external party Handicap.nl organize it for them. Their only focus on people with disabilities makes it good / great.', 'Arent there toilets directly under those grandstands? At least last year there were', 'Sorry that you had such a bad experience. Hope you comments reach the right people and they take it seriously.', ""Can you go through this with us?\n\nhttps://dutchgp.com/app/uploads/2025/08/2025_F1-Netherlands-Wayfinding-Map_Negative_VISUAL.pdf\n\nhttps://oversteer48.com/ben-pon-grandstand-zandvoort/#:~:text=As%20the%20video%20shows%2C%20sitting,your%20view%20of%20Turn%201.\n\nThe pit grandstand (27) where you bought your ticket for (you didn't buy a main grandstand ticket which is nearer to the extra care court) seat 134, from what I can see, has toilets directly underneath it at that location, and there is a stairway access point directly down to it at the back, so you move to the back of the stand of where you are and make your way down to the toilets. Is that not urgent toilet access?\n\nOn the map, wherever there is a food icon, there is a bathroom icon nearby. You say you didn't see a visible bathroom near the food trucks and therefore didn't eat but if you followed the map, which you get with your F1 experience ticket, would you have found one very quickly?\n\nYou also say you are a content creater and you will be sharing more content about your experience and you are starting here, what else will you be sharing?"", ""As a track owner who needs to spend millions to get an F1 race, I can see why they do what they do.

I can not think of a situation where there are special bathrooms limited to a select group. They have handicapped bathrooms,  but they don't prohibit others from using them.  \n\nI empathize with your situation,  but I am not sure I agree that this level of special needs facilities should be mandated."", 'From what I have read there was a special care zone with own bathrooms but on Saturday your knee played up (not the fault of the track), and on other days it was too busy to get past the crowd.. but what can you expect?

The soonest Piastri can clinch is COTA, if Norris scores 0 points and Verstappen scores less than 71 in the next 4 races. If Piastri were to win every GP, he would clinch in Vegas no matter what Norris does (even if Norris were to win the COTA and Brazil sprints, and Piastri scored 0 in them). If Piastri were to win every race (GP and Sprint), he would clinch in Brazil provided Norris finishes 3rd in at least two races or 4th or below in at least one race.

**WCC:** there were no eliminations in the constructor's championship this race, with half the field being eliminated last time out in Hungary. Even with Norris' DNF, McLaren can still break 1000 points, and owing to Ferrari's double DNF, they continue with more than double the points of 2nd place. 

The soonest McLaren can clinch is still Baku, which they will be guaranteed to do with either 2 1-2's or a 1-2 and a 1-3 in Monza and Baku. As Baku is the 17th round, they would clinch 70.83% of the way through the season, which would be the 6th fastest ever, behind 1961 Ferrari, 1988 McLaren, 1960 Cooper, and 1963 and 65 Lotus; and ahead of teams like 2004 Ferrari and 2023 Red Bull.","['My boy Albon keeping himself in the title fight.', ""Albon being the only midfield car still in the championship really highlights just how good and consistent he's been, ina  season where no midfield team really stood above another for a consistent amount of time\n\nHe's really, REALLY good!"", 'Phew Albon still in contention 😮\u200d💨', 'You are telling me alpine is out of it ? :(\xa0', 'hadjar getting eliminated with a podium is crazy', 'Great weekend for Lewis, didn’t lose ground to Charles 😢', ' So you’re saying there’s still a chance…', 'Total of VER + RUS + LEC who are in 3rd, 4th, 5th is still like more than 40 points behind the top two.

I feel awful for leaving anyone out because there’ve been so many. I’ve worked with Flavio Briatore to Christian Horner; I’ve seen both ends of the spectrum. And of course, you learn from all of those experiences and those people.\n\nThat quote speaks a lot.

And what F1 taught me more than anything was the power of a team—and I loved that. At Benetton, when we were fighting for a championship, everyone was looking for the last scrap of performance. I can’t tell you the energy that it gives you, and it keeps you young, so I made the decision to go into a management career. I’ve never looked back, frankly.\n\n>I love the incredible creativity, the work that the engineering geniuses like Mattia Binotto can create with the right tools. But more than that, I’ve loved managing people, building teams, guiding people in their career paths, seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee. I love all of that, and I love building teams, so it’s just a bigger team to put together as team principal than it was as a sporting director or mechanic.\n\n\nIt\'s the ""seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee.

He kept key people in the same positions to maintain the status quo, to impress the board.   \n\nA lot of Toto fans will hate to read this, but Toto bought his way into the sport with Williams.

It could be an absolute master piece of a season or it could be total chaos. 

- new engine regulations
- new power unit supplier (RBPT)
- 11th team added (Cadillac) 
- new works team (Audi)
- new circuit (Spain)
- change in power unit supplier ( Aston and Alpine)



I mean wow! I’m excited to see how things turn out!
","['There is a reason why the first round of testing is closed to media and public.\n\n🍿🍿🍿🍿\n\n/s', ""Yeah, because that's a great topic for the off season. I promise we'll beat the topic to death by the start of 2026."", 'Just correcting a few things:\n\n- Two new power unit suppliers (RB-Ford and Audi)\n- New works team (Audi), new works partnership (Aston Martin-Honda)\n- Several more changes in power unit supplier than you mention (Aston Martin, Alpine, Audi, Red Bull and Racing Bulls)', 'RBRE/Ford DNF the first 3 races.', ""It could be exciting or it could be a complete snooze fest if one team cracks the regulations. Per an article on the Race, Pirelli gets sim data from all teams for tire development and they've raised a concern that they were seeing a 4s a lap field spread on the sim data. That's massive and not an encouraging sign for close racing. I'm sure we'll be a lot closer by the time the lights go out in Melbourne but a rule change of this magnitude usually leads to a few years of a single team dominating. If Mercedes crack the engine and fuel rules, expect to see McLaren's dominance continue because the works Mercedes team has given no signs they can be competitive under a budget cap. If Ferrari crack it, the works Ferrari team will dominate as none of the customers are good enough to be in the mix. RBPT, Honda and Audi acing it would all lead to single team dominance. The odds on it being competitive at the front are low imho."", ""Yeah, I think people are waiting for the season to finish or at least be close to the end before starting speculation on the next season, but there’s quite a few things to talk about.\n\n\nNot least the most fun, yet least predictable part in who's going to be the best and worst adapted drivers, and as teams who's going to nail the new regulations."", ""I just hope that one team doesn't dominate again and leave everyone else behind like Mercedes did in 2014. A championship battle between two teams/drivers right up to the last race of the season would be fantastic"", ""That's why we have a winter break."", ""There's plenty of time during the off-season which is why it probably hasn't been spoken about much yet.\n\nMercedes engine is rumoured to be a rocket ship but we don't know for sure yet what everyone will have. It could be like 2014 with Mercedes engined cars having a serious advantage. Equally power isn't everything, one small mistake elsewhere could destroy that advantage.\n\nPossible examples, its super powerful and super fragile. Or it requires so much extra cooling that the larger radiators and their size / weight outdoes any advantage in power.\n\nAt least one team will be the clear winner, we just don't know who yet."", 'It feels like it’s the first regs change in awhile where you aren’t completely confident in one team to likely have it nailed down and be a front runner \n\n2022 folks were hugely confident in Mercedes, and it didn’t come off, but they had the pedigree from the previous 7 years. Red Bull too, with Newey and a good engine, you had the feeling they’d be right up there. \n\n2014 Red Bull were in the position Mercedes would be ahead of 2022, and there was also lots of smoke and belief that Mercedes were going to be near the front at minimum \n\nI guess 2010 would be the last time there was some doubt? The defending world championship team was a patchwork put together for one year and was Mercedes’ return to being a full works team. Ferrari and McLaren both had a poor 2009. Red Bull were ascending, but nowhere near what they’d become \n\nRight now, Mercedes seems optimistic but they’ve gone the entire last 4 years without producing a contending car. Red Bull have lost the entire main infrastructure of their dominant period. McLaren are in the ascendancy but it’s shifting up right as they’ve hit their peak. Ferrari you kind of always assume will be right there but not the best, but maybe there’s a 2014 around the corner. Aston have put in tons of $ and got the right personnel, but it’s still more unproven. \n\nDoesn’t mean we’re going to get something like 2010 as opposed to 2014 or 22-23, but I do agree it feels like more of a coin flip this go around']",0,51,0.42,0,263,263,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
