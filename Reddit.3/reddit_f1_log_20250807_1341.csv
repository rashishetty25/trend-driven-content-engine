Ferrari is the best of the rest at the moment."", 'It doenst need much explaining,\n\nFerrari should keep Vasseur\n\nI think he arrived to a team in ruin in 2023. Operationally they were appalling, slow pit stops, awful Strategy and poor reliability.\n\nIn 2023 the team slowly improved throughout the year\xa0and were second fastest by the end of it, they carried this through to 2024 and also fixed the main problem they had had in 2023, bad tyre wear. Suddenly in 2024 they had the best tyre wear on the gird bar maybe Haas. The first example of many of Vasseur identifying a poor area and improving it.\xa0\n\nAnd in 2024 Vasseur led them to what is in my opinion Ferrari‚Äôs best season since 2008! They looked like a different team and were the best on the grid operataionally.\xa0\n\nAnd now this season, while the car is not good enough to win, it is slowly improving, points became podiums and now they have a pole.\xa0\n\nBut also you can only blame the team principal so much for a disappointing car. He does not build the car, he hires the people who do, and Vasseur had made many high profile signings of successful designers up and down the grid.\xa0\n\nThe things the team principal is more responsible for, is how the team performs operationally. And Vasseur inherited a team that was woeful operationally and had not capitalised on a great car in 2022.\xa0\n\nAnd Vasseur has made this team amazing operationally, bar the outright pace, everything else about Ferrari is very good.\xa0\n\nIn the strategy department they were probably the best team in 2024, Japan, Netherlands, Monza, USA were all races where the strategy directly won places and Monza was the best example. At Ferrari‚Äôs home race everyone had rules out a Ferrari win after qulaifying, heck everyone had ruled them out by lap 30. But they rolled the dice, the Ferrari gambit. No one thought the one stop was on but Ferrari and Vasseur knew that it was the only way they could win. So they went for it and won at Monza!\xa0\n\nThe pit stops are another perfect example of Vasseur identifying a place where Ferrari were lacking, and improving it. It was ridiculous how often Ferrari from 2019-2022 would randomly have a long pit stop. But this year they have not only improved, but have probably been THE BEST team on the pit stop front, with the crew doing an incredible job under Vasseur‚Äôs leadership.\xa0\n\nAnd the bad reliability that plagued them and their customer teams throughout 2022 is all but eradicated. I don‚Äôt recall a Ferrari dropping out of a race due to reliability since Brazil 2023!\xa0\n\nFerrari have been a little disappointing this season, but they‚Äôre still second in the standings.\nAnd Ferrari are always firing their team principals and things dont change when they do.\xa0\n\nAnd let‚Äôs not forget that he masterminded the biggest and most dramatic driver transfer in the sports history. Even if Lewis is worse performing than Sainz (which id like to add looked unlikely after Lewis‚Äôs great season in 2023 that preceded Ferrari signimg him) this is an incredible move for Ferrari because Lewis brings so much good publicity to the team and has attracted the joint biggest sponsorship deal in F1 history, the HP deal. Like the blue or not this is gargantuan momey for Ferrari and Vasseur is again the guy that led the team to this deal. And I doubt Hamilton wouldve gone to Ferrari without Vasseur. Let‚Äôs not forget Vasseur worked directly with Hamilton in GP2 and they have always appeared to be friendly with each other.\xa0\n\nAnd Ferrari appears to be a much friendlier place than the cold team that it was before, shrouded in controversy every other year and now it seems very nice with a very fun man at the head. I think Ferrari is a very healthy medium exemplified by 2024 when they worked themselves into a title fight they shouldnt really have been in. But Red Bull had such a toxic environment and McLaren seemed to be trying to win the title by the power of friendship. Ferrari had a very healthy team.\n\nWhen I look at the team that Vasseur inherited, and then look at the team it is now, I think Vasseur should be proud of what he‚Äôs done and it deserves to be appreciated by both Ferrari themselves and the fans.', 'I think Ferrari need some change higher up than Fred. \n\nExtending him was a no brainer.', 'Fred is definitely the right TP for the new regulations especially with Loic Serra finally getting to show what he‚Äôs capable of in leading the chassis design going forward.', ""The chances of Fred being able to make Ferrari challengers was ridiculously small in the first place. He has a lot of things working well. Don't remember the last time Ferrari were this good at pitstops. Leclerc is, imo, the second best on the grid so they've got their driver sorted. Strategy could be better and honestly their race engineers aren't the greatest, but they do seem to be on the right track. Ferrari under Binotto just made good cars and the rest of the team was a mess."", ""Elkann - ‚Äú*We‚Äôve had a rough season, and that is why it is really important to ensure that we end well and we start the second half very strong and full of energy,*‚Äù he expressed.\n\nThe seeds of the destruction are right here. It's every team's purpose to win, or at least do well, but wanting to do well for the sake of saving face isn't productive for them. They don't have enough time or resources to meaningfully turn the car around, but there's so much they need to do in terms of how they operate and communicate to set the foundation for the future. Ferrari is that runner who never does a proper long-slow-run day because they are always trying to beat the time on the stopwatch every run."", ""So they have a fall guy for being 4th or 5th fastest next season and don't have the new TP start with the burden of that next summer."", 'Good, now make some changes.\n\nUnless they stop resisting changes like Williams did when Vowles came in, Ferrari will never see the light of day.\n\nLH is a good marketing boost, but an F1 team cannot survive on Marketing boost alone.

Comparing drivers across different teams is never straightforward, especially with all the mid-season shuffling that goes on. To keep things fair and avoid car-based bias, I‚Äôm only looking at how each rookie performed compared to their teammate on the exact weekends they both raced. So for cases like Doohan and Colapinto, each rookie gets matched against Gasly‚Äîbut only using Gasly‚Äôs stats from the races they shared. It‚Äôs basically like splitting Gasly into two drivers, one for each rookie stint.

On the flip side, with Lawson and Hadjar, who had different teammates during the season, each one‚Äôs ‚Äúteammate‚Äù is a blend of stats from whoever was alongside them at each race. This way, the comparisons always line up with who was actually on the other side of the garage at the time.

Also, since lap times can vary wildly from track to track, I compare lap time gaps as percentages, not raw numbers, where the baseline is the teammate's time. That way, the results reflect true performance differences, not just circuit quirks.

  
**Clarification on the third plot**

How can BOR be slower in average than his teammate and yet have a better average qualifying position? He outqualified HUL by 12 positions twice. If we ignore those two weekends, his mark would be very close to BEA's. However, those two amazing Q's pull him to the left *way more* than they pull him down.","['Personally I would remove the first 2 races for Lawson. I would rather just see how he compared to Hadjar.', ""Fun post and interesting data. For instance, I knew that COL was closer to GAS on race pace than DOO had been, but I didn't know he was also closer to his team mate on that metric than BOR (rookie of the season so far, IMO)."", ""Great post. The race pace delta kinda deals a blow to the idea that COL has not been better than Doohan. That's a very wide margin in favor of Colapinto."", 'I think this comparison between Hadjar and Lawson is a bit unfair, since Lawson can be considered a ""rookie,"" and his time at Red Bull destroyed his confidence. If it were Hadjar and Yuki, Hadjar would probably be losing. I believe Hadjar, Bortoleto, and Bearman are the best this year. \n\nFor everything they\'ve sold about Antonelli so far, he\'s failing to deliver while driving the second- or third-best car on the grid.', 'The thing is that only Antonelli is up against a championship quality driver.

We tried to solve one problem, and it made something else significantly worse. That\'s now been fixed.""*', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **As soon as the old rear axle was returned, Mercedes drivers regained confidence in their cars. The new rear axle will likely never be seen again.**\n\n> This result sounds familiar. At the Miami GP, McLaren celebrated a one-two finish. George Russell took third place on the podium. Back then, he was 33 seconds behind the winners. This time, it was only 22 seconds. Between those two races, there were eight races and three upgrades. Or one win and six disappointments.\n\n> At Imola, Mercedes aimed to solve a long-standing problem with its first major development step. A new rear axle with more anti-lift was intended to keep the rear of the car more stable during load changes, within the window where aerodynamics work best. But the debut turned out to be a failure. The drivers complained about an unstable rear end, which promptly led to increased tire wear.\n\n> In the subsequent races, the Mercedes engineers tried to find the problem, sometimes relying on the old rear suspension, sometimes on the new one. In retrospect, it must be considered unfortunate that the new rear axle was in the car for the victory in Montreal. It wasn\'t the new rear axle that led to the brilliant moment, but rather the special track layout.\n\n> **The unsuspecting front wing.**\nAfter Mercedes drifted into the midfield at Spielberg, Silverstone, and Spa, the engineers decided on the most radical solution possible: back to the starting grid. In Budapest, the old rear axle was back in service with a few new details that had been introduced in the meantime, but weren\'t suspicious.\n\n> Take the front wing, for example. Chief engineer Andrew Shovlin explains why the front wing was ruled out as the cause of the problems, despite its reduced flexibility. ""The data shows that the stiffness of the wing has an impact on the car\'s handling and balance, but not as dramatically as the drivers felt. We were able to correct this with the setup and, at most, we\'ve experienced a bit more understeer.""\n\n> George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli had barely completed their first laps at the Hungaroring when they thought they were driving a different car. ""The rear end is stable again when turning,"" Russell praised. His young teammate rejoiced: ""The confidence in the car is back.""\n\n> **Progress through regression.**\nTeam principal Toto Wolff summarized: ""We\'ve given our drivers a more stable platform. Their increased confidence has been reflected in their lap times."" Russell missed pole position by 0.053 seconds. Antonelli completed 50 laps on one set of tires, defending his tenth place.\n\n> But Wolff also had some critical words: ""We rebuilt the car to its pre-Imola state and made it better. It shouldn\'t happen that an upgrade can mess everything up like that. With all the smart people on the team, all the simulations, and the infrastructure we have, you don\'t expect a car architecture to confuse you like that. We tried to solve one problem, and it made something else significantly worse. That\'s now been fixed.""\n\n> Anti-lift suspensions aren\'t a bad idea per se, but for Mercedes, the concept didn\'t deliver the desired result because too many compromises were required to install them. ""It wasn\'t planned for us. Retrofitting is never ideal in such cases. If this type of suspension works better for Ferrari or McLaren, it\'s perhaps because they weren\'t as restricted in their installation as we were,"" Shovlin laments.\n\n> **Is Mercedes still celebrating victories?**\nAfter the result at the Hungarian GP, the Mercedes drivers are looking more positively toward the ten races following the summer break. ""It\'s not just the World Championship point that feels good after so many disappointments,"" Antonelli said with a sigh of relief. ""As long as I was able to drive in clean air, my speed was good. I now know that I can fight for points in every race again.""\n\n> Russell nevertheless cautions drivers to keep their feet on the ground and not assume that Mercedes will finish on the podium every time from now on. ""Apart from the McLarens, there were a lot of surprises in Hungary. The Astons were better than expected, and Max was further back. But in terms of speed, with the exception of Canada, it was our best Grand Prix in a long time. And that was on a track type that doesn\'t suit us that well. We can now look ahead to the remaining races with a little more confidence.""\n\n> At a time when Mercedes has regained a solid starting position, it\'s almost frustrating that everyone in the field has stopped their arms race. ""We don\'t have any major upgrades planned, but we can still make small adjustments and optimize the car\'s setup,"" Wolff hopes.

1mjy169,Why don‚Äôt modern cars produce visible vapor trails from the exhaust like older ones used to?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mjy169/why_dont_modern_cars_produce_visible_vapor_trails/,2025-08-07, Technical,"I remember seeing older cars with visible exhaust vapor pretty regularly, just a faint white trail coming out of the tailpipe, even during normal driving. But with newer cars, that seems to be almost nonexistent.

Has something changed in engine design, emissions systems, or fuel combustion that prevents this? Do modern catalytic converters or mufflers affect how water vapor is expelled? Or is it simply that newer engines burn fuel more efficiently, leaving behind less moisture?

Just curious what specific changes have made visible exhaust vapor so rare on today‚Äôs vehicles. Anyone have insight into the technical reasons?
","[""I don't think that has anything to do with the exhaust and I always believed it was just vortices from the aero. \n\nI've been wrong many times in life before so there is no reason for that to suddnely change now."", ""That's not from the exhaust. It's vortices from the corners of the rear wing.\n\nYou still see these vortices in particular climatic conditions."", ""those are not from the exhaust, those are condensation trails from the vortices that come from the rear wing endplates\n\npost-2022 F1 cars don't produce those because they don't have endplates, so the vortices are much larger and don't condense water like that\n\nthe 2026 rear wings might produce them, but because there will be active aero you probably won't see them much"", ""The trails in that picture aren't from the exhaust. They're vapor trails agitaged by the rear wing.\n\nIn general, the addition of the ~~MGU-K~~ MGU-H will likely have removed any possibility of visible emissions from the exhaust, as it re-absorbs the heat as much as possible. If there was water vapor in the exaust to generate visible smoke, the engine probably wouldn't be anywhere near efficient enough to compete."", 'Fia contract for spreading chemtrails ended', ""It wasn't that common tbh, mostly happened in damp conditions in the older days. The car in the pic is the MP4-26 from 2011 which has exhaust at the floor so the vapor has nothing to do with the exhaust in this case. Why it doesn't happen these days? Not sure, might be because rear wings don't have similar end plates like they used to have."", ""Where on earth is it coming out of the exhaust here?

1mjvpme,Does the scoring system in F1 need changing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mjvpme/does_the_scoring_system_in_f1_need_changing/,2025-08-07, Discussion,"In any other league,  a difference,  at the half way point of a season,  being 20 and 70 points would leave you very bored as you know who is going to win.  

F1 has a difference of 559 and 20 with only 10 teams.  There is almost no drama with this scoring system.  

Its also high skewed by almost random events like rain.  A lower ranked team get lucky with a pit stop, rain or crash and suddenly they leap from a few places.   

Is that really rewarding a years worth of team engineering and strategy? 

  
I know this one will be a bit controversial but I'd be interested to see some alternatives that different leagues use to keep things looking a bit more interesting for the audience.
