And everytime there are 2 sides with great arguments. Yet the stewards very clearly only see it as black or white. 

  
The ahead of the apex rule absolutely needs to go, the only thing it does is create confusion. space should always be given if someone is alongside. You shouldnt be able to squeeze them off just because you were 10 cm in front. As a driver thats very hard to see. This not only kills the racing. but also gives us anti climax races. Another problem this rule creates, is that it gets abused alot. ''im in front? i better just push the other driver off cuz its legal anyway'' 

it also creates scenarios where drivers are fully alongside but still need to bail out in awkward spots or risk a penalty or it kills the battle entirely.  take today for example. what could max have done different? Just not turn in? Just brake so hard that he makes a switchback? But that cant be because there are cars behind. the only thing he couldve done is cut the track and give the position back. But thats just bad racing. That someone can win a battle simply because they were the car that was slightly in front. at that point its not really racing anymore.

im pretty sure there isnt another series outside of formula that uses this format of wheel to wheel rules. Its stupid, outdated, confusing. And every incident is different. So why is it so black and white. You dont own a corner, its that simple. you share it.

And there is a very simple solution. When 2 cars are going side by side at the turn in of a corner (front axle near rear axle) space should be given by both sides.

Corners have multiple apexes, depending on the line you're taking. In a situation such as this, where a car is on the inside, while the other is on the outside, the apexes will differ. So this is not a good benchmark to begin with. \n\nNot only that, but chicanes are actually a nightmare in this situation. Same scenario - two cars alongside each other. The one on the inside has ths entry. Fine. The problem is that the car on the outside upon entry has the better line for the exit out of the chicane. And that's what I hate the most about this situation. Everybody, from the fans to the stewards act like this ain't actually a thing. \n\nThe rulings they always dish out in these scenarios clearly indicate that they expect the car that has the worse line upon entry to yield the whole chicane. But nobody has the guts to actually lay it out in writing. To actually turn it into a rule. Because how the hell would you tell racing drivers to yield two corners based on a relative benchmark?\n\nNow with regards to the Verstappen-Piastri situation.  Please don't come at me with the 'Max would've never made the corner' nomsense. That's the single dumbest take I've seen within the F1 community since 2021.\n\nHe obviously did make the corner. He didn't go out because he had too much speed. He went out because Oscar took the optimal line throughout the whole chicane. Now, yet again, if the standard for chicanes is indeed that the car with the optimal line upon entry is entitled to the whole thing, then fine. I don't agree with it, but turn it into a rule. We don't even have this. We only have rulings that act as if this is what the regulations say, but they don't.\n\nI think Max was a bit too ambitious, however I really dislike how Oscar acts as if the chicane was entirely his. The fact is that he wasn't actually ahead at the apex, which is why people keep spreading around the whole 'Max wouldn't have made the corner nonsense'. They are aware of it, they just pretend that Max was alongside/ahead simply because he bombed into the corner. It's clearly not the case. \n\nIf you don't like Max's behavior in t1, which I can see why, then you shouldn't like Oscar's behavior in t2 either. He clearly had not intention to leave any space and acted as if he was a full car length ahead.\n\nIf they didn't take any action against Hamilton in Abu Dhabi 2021, then they shouldn't have taken any here as well. \n\nThe truth is that Max has a solid case in claiming that he was pushed out.

1k3zqmf,Has the ground effect era been a success?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k3zqmf/has_the_ground_effect_era_been_a_success/,2025-04-20, Discussion,"Given this is the last season before another shift in regulations, the question is simple, but also rather complicated at the same time. Most ‚Äòcasual‚Äô F1 fans would look at the question at face value, and probably come to the conclusion that no, it has not. The simple reason being Red Bull‚Äôs dominance since the introduction of the regulation changes. 

However, there is also the argument to be made that Max‚Äôs dominance could mislead opinions. It was only in 2023 that the Red Bull managed a 1-2 in championship standings, 2022 saw Perez finishing 3rd on a similar points tally to Charles, with George not miles behind. 2024 seeing Perez all the way down in 8th. Which suggest as everyone understands, the Red Bull certainly has had its struggles in terms of drivability. 

F1 isn‚Äôt just about championships though, so what about the rest of the field? I think the best measure for this is to look at average overtakes per season, given the whole reasoning behind the reg changes was to promote better racing, with cars being able to follow closer to the car in front, and for longer without their tyres being cooked. So, let‚Äôs look at the numbers:

2014: 45.2
2015: 33.1
2016: 52.2
2017: 25.5
2018: 35.7
2019: 45.2
2020: 36.9
2021: 36.7
2022: 45.2
2023: 50
2024: 38.8

It‚Äôs actually interesting to see that bar 2023, numbers were somewhat similar, with similar fluctuations to preceding seasons. 

For me it comes down to two questions:

1) Did it break a one team dominance?
2) Did it promote competitive racing throughout the grid?

For the first I‚Äôd say again, a complicated answer. Yes, Red Bull were dominant. However, the overwhelming reason behind this was Max‚Äôs pure dominance. With the second seat looking more in line with the other top teams. So, I would argue that whilst on the face of things the answer would be a no, if you take the Max factor into consideration it‚Äôs actually a yes. 

For the second, I think as the numbers support, we didn‚Äôt see a suddenly more competitive mid to lower pack, with it seemingly staying around the same in terms of competitive performance.

I also think we‚Äôre now seeing with multiple years of development of cars under the regs it‚Äôs becoming less competitive. The joke of this season being more of a qualifying championship than a racing one, popping up far too frequently than we‚Äôd like.

Interested to see other people‚Äôs perspective on this topic.
","['Mixed bag really. At the start it was a 2 horse race, then 1 horse collapsed.\n\nIt then had the most one sided championship in F1 history. \n\nBut then, a year later, 7 drivers had multiple race wins, a new record, and a new WCC after 15 years. \n\nNow it looks like a tight WDC between 2 drivers, but Max is always there, and George is 1-2 upgrades away from becoming a shadow contender himself.', ""Following is significantly easier compared to before but the FiA's refusal to police teams for adding more and more over body down force has led to similar issues with being able to actually pass.\n\nSo in some cases its a success and in others its a failure."", 'At first it looked like it, but then overtaking became much more difficult.\n\nFor me the size of the cars is the real problem, on some circuits there is not even space for two cars next to each other. They need to make them smaller and more agile again.', 'I would say no. From memory the idea of ground effect was to allow cars to race more closely and be less troubled by dirty air. It‚Äôs pretty obvious that dirty air is still a huge issue. \n\nI feel like the regulations change a lot rather than evolve. Maybe if they evolved then they could find ways to mitigate dirty air etc and have closer racing. Every time regulations reset we seem to end up with the one team dominance you mentioned.', 'People often get confused about the purpose of the massive regulation changes coming from the 2021 Concorde Agreement.\n\nThe aero regulations were designed purely to improve the racing, to limit the amount of dirty air created by the lead car and the following car\'s sensitivity to that dirty air. They did that. It wasn\'t perfect, with the bouncing and requirement to run so stiff, but they were successful in achieving this goal. Cars were able to get much closer and race for far longer than any recent regulation allowed. F1 stated that the rules worked better than expected for 2022, but these gains were lost more than expected in \'23 & \'24. Some believe that the FIA did a very poor job of policing the developments and allowed certain things that were clearly against the regulations like not having the front and rear wings be continuous pieces. To be clear, dirty air is still nowhere near as big a problem as it was in 2021, but it\'s worse than it needs to be. With how close the field now is, overtaking is much more difficult, so it\'s not an apples to apples comparison when looking at overtakes in \'21 & \'24.\n\nThe other changes - cost cap, sliding scale ATR and restructured prize money were implemented to aid convergence and level the playing field. This was NEVER intended to have an immediate effect. The advantages of the big 3 teams was so ingrained that it was believed it would take 5-10 years to take effect. By that measure, those changes have been incredibly successful, but nothing to do with the ground effect regulations. We have the closest F1 grid in history and 7 teams that have the capability to ""win"" the next regulation reset in 2026. \n\nSo, I don\'t think your 2 criteria for judging the success of the ground effects regulations are good way to assess it. Overtakes weren\'t the goal; better, closer racing and longer battles was, and that was achieved. The overall vision for these regulations from Ross Brawn, Pat Symonds and Rob Smedley was for this be the first step and a proof of concept for the next regulation change to improve upon. Unfortunately, this was handed off to Stefano Domenicali, Nikolas Tombazis and then had to be scraped to accommodate the \'26 PU regulations. We\'ll see if the smaller cars, push to pass and active aero can produce good racing, but that isn\'t the focus of these regulation changes. Improving the racing was the sole purpose of the ground effect regulations and they were successful in achieving that goal.', ""not really. in 2022 it was good. but once teams developed their cars again. dirty air came back. now 2025 it's close to 2021 levels again. not quite but we see in the times how cars stay around 1.2 sec away to get away from the dirty air.\n\nmaybe 2026 it will get better with the inwash concept but I dunno."", 'DRS, 18"" rims, massive cars, overly complex hybrid powertrains, letting teams outwash the front wing again...ground effect is just one facet of the current formula\'s disappointment.', 'was only one good season during it', 'For a brief moment yes but the loopholes allow outwashing to return and we are back to square one.\n\nI think formula 1 needs to take a step back and think about what it wants to be as a racing series.']",10,62,0.62,10,345,345,2,0,0.020000000000000018,2

I think it is easy to dismiss it as the start-of-the-season woes like we saw with Alpine last year, but how much of it is down to the car, the pitwall *(because one of Gasly's races, as far as I can remember, was squandered slightly by the strategy, I think, or I might be getting amnesia somewhere)* and the drivers?"", 'The moment of the weekend for me was the Red Bull Q3 strategy masterclass.

Now that makes me wonder, how would Sainz handle the SF-25? The car's balance seems to be pretty similar to the early-form F1-75, a car that Sainz had difficulties extracting performance from.

Considering Charles usually can comfortably out-qualify Carlos in Bahrain and Saudi, my guess is the qualifying gap in Bahrain would‚Äôve been around two tenths but bigger again in Saudi     \n\nAnd then I think Charles would have the clear advantage in race pace, I think that‚Äôs where he actually had more of an advantage over Carlos.\n\nOn tracks Charles likes, when he‚Äôs comfortable with the car and not making small mistakes in qualifying, it‚Äôs very unlikely Carlos would be a real threat to him.

1k3sk0b,The Verstappen and Piastri incident today have highlighted that the overtaking/defending rules in F1 need to change,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k3sk0b/the_verstappen_and_piastri_incident_today_have/,2025-04-20, Discussion,"The title speaks for itself, these overtaking rules in F1 are ridiculous. All this ""ahead at the apex"" stuff is utter BS. In every other motorsport in the world, the rule is that if 2 cars are side by side going into a corner, both cars must leave a cars width of space for the other car throughout the duration of the corner. It doesn't matter who got to the corner first, if they are side by side under breaking, they must leave space. Piastri didn't do that.

The way the rules are currently makes F1's racecraft look like a joke despite being the pinicle of motorsport. And I should know, the driving standards in Nascar right now leave a lot to be desired, but this is ridiculous.

Not only are the current rules stupid, but they actively hurt the racing product because drivers can't race side by side for an extended time because one of them will be forced off track. This isn't even the only incident of this manner. Look at Verstappen and Norris at Cota last year, or Verstappen and Lewis at Abu Dhabi in 2021. This has been a problem for a long time. 

These rules need to change, and the penalty for it also needs to be substantial to discourage drivers from doing this. I'm thinking it should be a drive through like you see in Imsa for similar incidents.","['I think that it shows how poorly this track is designed.
