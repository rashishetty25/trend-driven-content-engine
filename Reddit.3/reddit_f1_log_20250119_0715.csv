But, McLaren might not give him a good enough car.', ""If he puts in performances like Abu Dhabi and Baku last year he'll easily be in the fight, it's just about cutting down on the needless mistakes that were present in Brazil and even the double yellows in Qatar if Lando can get on top of that he really has no reason not to be a contender, and even win this season, I don't think his wheel to wheel racing is actually as poor as people make it out to be, it's just when you're going up against the greatest wheel to wheel racer on the grid right now it'll undoubtedly be tougher then racing anybody else. If Lando also keeps Oscar in check throughout the year which he's done pretty well over these past two seasons he'll probably have a shot against either Leclerc or Verstappen both of whom I expect to be his main competitors.""]",0,112,0.28,0,94,94,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0
