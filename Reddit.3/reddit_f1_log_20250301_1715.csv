1j0jgb4,A stat I never heard before - 1x World champions that never won a race as World Champion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0jgb4/a_stat_i_never_heard_before_1x_world_champions/,2025-02-28, Statistics,"I was watching Josh Revell's latest video, and he made a point I’d never considered: Jacques Villeneuve won his last Formula 1 race *before* becoming world champion. This got me thinking—who are the other drivers that never won a F1 race as a World Champion? Here’s what I found:

* **Nico Rosberg (2016, Suzuka)** – He secured the title four races later, in Abu Dhabi.
* **Jacques Villeneuve (1997, Luxembourg)** – He won the title two races later, in Jerez.
* **Jody Scheckter (1979, Italy)** – He won the championship in that race.
* **Mario Andretti (1978 Zandvoort)** (thanks to u/TheRoboteer!) - The title was assigned one race later in Monza
* **Jochen Rindt (1970, Germany)** – The title was mathematically sealed at the penultimate race (USA).
* **Phil Hill (1961, Italy)** – He won the championship in that race, with the title being mathematically sealed due to the death of Von Trips, who then was just one point behind him.
* **Mike Hawthorn (1958, France)** – The title was mathematically sealed at the final race (Morocco).

1j0syme,What the team were paid in 2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0syme/what_the_team_were_paid_in_2024/,2025-03-01, Statistics,"Liberty Media released their [Q4 and 2024 EOY Earnings report](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/557/liberty-media-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year) on Thursday which included the financial results of Formula 1.

It was another record breaking year for F1 with revenue of $3.4B (\^$189M), **Adjusted EBIT of $2.07B** (\^$169M) and declared income of $492M (\^100M).

Nobody publishes these breakdowns anymore, so here is the maths sourced from Liberty media earnings calls, reputable journalists and corroborated by checking against the financial records of F1 and the teams.

The team payments pool is [calculated from adjusted EBIT based on a scale that tips more towards Liberty as the profits increase](https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/formel-1/f1-aktie-hoehenflug-liberty-media-teams-kauften-nicht/#:~:text=The%20amount%20of,just%2030%20percent).  below is the scale of how much the teams get for each band of F1 earnings

|$0-$1B|         | 75% |      |$750M|

|next $500M|  | 60%|       |$300M|

|Next $300M|  |45%|      |$135M|

|Over $1.8B|    | 30%|       |$81 (in 2024)|

This makes the total prize pool [(team payments) $1,266M](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/557/liberty-media-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year#:~:text=(-,1%2C266,-)) up from $1,215M in 2023.

From this, [Ferrari still gets the Longest Standing Team Bonus](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ferrari-set-to-keep-bonus-payment-in-new-f1-concorde-agreement-but-now-capped/10613517/) which is said to be 5% up to a prize pool of 1.1B, then increases by 1% for every $100M extra in the prize pool (6% to 1.2B etc. like tax brackets). for 2024 this is $65.6M.

Then there is a Past Performance pool, awarded to teams based on a matrix of placing in the top 3 of the WCC over the past 10 seasons and a bonus for teams that have won single or multiple WCC in the sports history. This pool is [believed to be 20% of the total pool, over $650M](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/who-wins-from-f1s-new-concorde-deal-and-how-itll-work/#:~:text=Title%2Dwinning%20teams%20and%20teams%20that%20finished%20in%20the%20top%20three%20in%20the%20past%20decade%20are%20eligible%20for%20this%20pot%2C%20which%20is%20derived%20from%20a%20percentage%20of%20F1%20revenue%20above%20a%20certain%20threshold%20%E2%80%93%20reportedly%2020%25%20of%20what%20F1%20makes%20over%20%24650m). for 2024 this is $123.2M.

This leaves a WCC pool of $1,077M to be split between the teams based on their place in the 2023 WCC. 6% for last, then equal increments for each place up to 14% for the WCC.

So that gives the following table for what each team was paid (in $M).

|Team|Prize Money|PPM|Bonus|Total|% of total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Red Bull|150.8|31.6||182.4|14.4%|
|Mercedes|141.2|47.4||188.6|14.9%|
|Ferrari|131.7|25.3|65.6|222.6|17.6%|
|Mclaren|122.1|6.3||128.4|10.1%|
|Aston Martin|112.5|||112.5|8.9%|

I think the best part was definitely the car designs, the were absolutely phenomenal. Great job on the design team for that one. The acting was quite good to, especially from Senna, Prost, and Lauda.

The race scenes were pretty decent. Most were nothing special, just your average high adrenaline camera shaking scene, but there were a couple of outliers, like 1984 Monaco, 1989 Japan, and 1994 Imola.

I think one thing they could've don't better was the Senna-Prost rivalry scenes. I know this is Senna's show, so obviously it's going to be more focused towards him, but I feel like it portrayed Prost as this big annoying villain when I'm sure in real life Senna was probably just as annoying too. I think Prost getting his own show would be nice.

I'd say an 8/10 is a fair rating. What do you think?

He just overcame every possible problem with 110% determination, skill and confidence and never looked back… Of course, everyone who stood even slightly in his way was portrayed as pure evil, as well. Might as well have been eating babies at all the FIA meetings.\n\nOther thing that bugged me is that it felt like someone gave a Hollywood script writer the cliff notes of Senna’s life and said “idk anything about the guy, string it together.” And they did. It’s more like a montage than a coherent story, IMO. I didn’t feel any sense of connection with Senna, it was more like being a fly in the room.\n\nOverall, it’s a “take it or leave it” for me.

1j0k5e9,Flexi Rear Wings - Was it legal when it happened last year? what changed in the regs this year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0k5e9/flexi_rear_wings_was_it_legal_when_it_happened/,2025-02-28, Discussion,"There seems to still be a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding regarding the infamous ""Baku Wing"" on the McLaren last year.

People keep throwing around phrases like ""the wing was illegal"" or ""it was illegal because the regs say the DRS has to stay closed"" 

The technical regulations in F1 are complicated and worded very specifically. I've formatted the specific regulations pertaining to changes made this year to make it much more difficult to achieve a ""Baku Wing"" effect. Simply the ""Baku Wing"" was legal. The FIA said it was legal, they just didn't appreciate it, said they would ban it and McLaren pulled it back because it was clearly going to become a problem if they continued to use it long term. 

(See strikethru bold vs. bold, Changes approved by WMSC on 11/12/24)

**3.10.1 Rear Wing Profiles** 

* Bodywork declared as “Rear Wing Profiles” must: 
   * a. Lie within RV-RW-PROFILES. 
   * b. In any Y plane: 
      * i. Contain exactly two sections. 
      * ii. The rearmost section, which will be known as the “RW Flap”, must have a chord smaller than the chord of the adjacent section. 
      * iii. With the exception of minimal modifications to permit attachment of the actuator system described in 3.10.10 to the RW Flap, the sections may not contain any concave radius of curvature smaller than 100mm 
      * **~~iv. The distance between the two sections must lie between 10mm and 15mm at their closest position.~~** 
   * **Furthermore:** 
      * **c. At all points along the span, the rear wing profiles (as defined under Article 3.10.1) must have a minimum gap of between 9.4mm and 13mm. This will apply when the DRS is not in the state of deployment (as defined under Article 3.10.10) and will be measured with a spherical gauge.** 
      * **d. Outboard of Y100, the normal to any point of the profiles surface must not subtend an angle greater than 20° to a Y plane.** 
      * **e. Once the RW Flap is fully defined, a Gurney of up to 20mm may be fitted to the trailing edge. This Gurney is considered to be part of the Rear Wing Profiles and must satisfy the provisions of this Article with the exception of sections b (iii) and (c)(d).**

**3.15.15 Rear Wing Slot Gap Deflection**

* **With the hydraulic system active and the DRS deployed, a spherical gauge must not pass through the gap between the two elements within RV-RW-Profiles. The gauge will have a diameter of 85mm +0.00 / -0.05mm and a load of** **~~10N~~** **30N will be applied during the test.**

  
In simple terms: 

The language defining how the rear wing elements are allowed to move along planes angularly has been specified, as it was not before (310.1,b,iv being struck out and re-thought)

The test load of the Slot Gap Deflection has been tripled to more easily flesh out any kind of manipulation that could occur and be explained away as accidental or conditional. 

  
Thanks for reading ","['There is a fundamental tension at the heart of the regulations between the strict rule and ensuring the rules are being complied with.\n\n3.2.2 is pretty clear about rigid secure and immobile components/bodywork.\n\nHowever everyone is well aware that this in a strict sense simply isn’t possible. So there is some tolerance introduced during the tests for these rules such as in 3.10.1. And that tolerance is what tends to lead to arguments. The rules do say that bodywork can’t flex, but also essentially says it can as long as it is not too much. \n\nBut since the tests aren’t perfect, there is sometimes gaps where there isn’t a test which actually checks the rules in a specific way. If there isn’t a specific test then it becomes unclear if it is legal or illegal since there is no specific defined tolerance, but complete rigidity isn’t possible.', 'IIRC the ban on flexy wings is in the ""no moveable aero"" part. So it\'s pretty open ended.', 'DRS opening beyond the maximum gap when closed has never been legal. \n\nIf teams play around neither it again this season a sporting punishment should be handed out', ""So, are you trying to justify McLaren's mini-DRS?"", ""Isn't there another rule outright banning movable aero devices?"", ""It was a grey area for which they've since added language to the rule book to make it illegal, so the standard isn't entirely just about the static test anymore.\n\nSo although they may have violated the spirit of the rule, they were (correctly) not DQ'd because they didn't blatantly break the rules because of how reliant the regulation was on the test, which McLaren had passed.\n\nIf they did the same thing this year they would get DQ'd from the race result, plain and simple."", 'The regulations don’t contain the technical directives, which are the ad hoc rulings from the FIA for the juicy stuff such as “mini DRS”. They are not released to the public.', ""Like you said, 3.2.2 is clarified by the further, more specific articles which do permit deflection and flex. \n\nIf the articles permit deflection, deflection will occur. \nThe articles have been tightened up like I detailed in my post. However deflection is still permitted to some degree. So everyone seeing deflection occur during testing should put their pitchforks down and wait. It's extremely unlikely these 2025 rear wings are being tested for the entire weekend while not being already cleared by the FIA."", 'I don\'t believe the rear wing is specifically controlled in that section, at all. Can you show me?\n\nAll ""movement"" of elements of the car are either defined or not defined as relative movement or deflection.\n\nAll the tolerances for movement, deflection, flex etc are defined where felt necessary and none of those tolerances are 0. \n\nThere is no open-endedness that results in a ""ban"" currently. The only open-endedness that exists allows for further workarounds to take place.']",3,27,0.52,3,84,84,3,0,0.020000000000000018,3
1j0vg9x,What caused Mercedes to have a bulge next to the car number and above the suspension?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0vg9x/what_caused_mercedes_to_have_a_bulge_next_to_the/,2025-03-01, Discussion,"I don't know much about the technology. Judging from the size of the damper and other elements, this bulge doesn't seem to be necessary. 

My guess is that if there is no bulge, the anti-roll bar of the car will rotate when the car turns, causing its rocker arm to contact the suspension cover. 

It seems that Mercedes started to replace a larger anti-roll bar rocker arm at the Austrian Grand Prix last year? How does this upgrade work? It seems that Mercedes kept the bulge design because it don't want to increase the height of the suspension elements?
