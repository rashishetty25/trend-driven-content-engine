1i2p8a7,O'Wards' story on his French denied Super License.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i2p8a7/owards_story_on_his_french_denied_super_license/,2025-01-16, Discussion,"Recently Pato O'Ward went to a Mexican podcast called ""Creativo"", one of the clips that went kinda viral or at least gained some notoriety is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZShqdZPECbg). Pato had previously talked about it, mentioning that only that the FIA did not wanna give him his SL, but in this podcast he expanded.

O'Ward says that after getting P8 with Carlin in Indycar, Helmut got in contact with him an gave him a Formula 1 contract for what would have been 2020. Patricio says that he was on his way to F1, that Charlie Whiting gave the green light and all. Charlie dies and a new team arrives, referred by O'Ward as ""the French team"", they block O'Ward's SL due to a lack of points by not counting his Indy Lights points due to the number of cars not meeting the minimum to reward full points. This is the part when he is sent to Japan to get points, that he does not receive because he does not complete the season. In the end, O'Ward claims that the FIA did it on purpose to protect ""A Frenchman"" from losing his seat (honestly, just should have said Gasly, with the timeframe is very clear).

While I don't doubt there were politics involved because FIA, I find interesting that depending on who he talks to, his tone changes. In both english and spanish he is kinda hostile to the FIA, but in english has claimed ""Red Bull let me go"", while in spanish verions (i've seen) of the story is ""I cut with Red Bull"" (as if he was the one leaving, not Marko telling him to go).

Other thing I find interesting is what would have been Red Bull's structure for 2020, I asume VER-ALB in RBR and KVY-OWA in AT with Gasly dropped.","['I like Pato a lot but the way he‚Äôs told this story over the years is clearly pretty BS.

Is this a result of costly tickets or low salaries? Can locals even attend these races or are they for tourists? Are these races a tourist attraction boosting tourism in these countries?

1i2vke8,Could Ford take over VCARB?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i2vke8/could_ford_take_over_vcarb/,2025-01-16, Discussion,"Ford hasn't liked to be left behind whenever GM does a thing.  They'll have an interest into climbing back into F1 if GM does.

I think it's quite possible that Ford intends to counter Cadillac's entry into Formula 1 by attaching their branding to the Baby Bulls and buying part ownership in Red Bull's second team.

With VCARB crying out for a longterm sponsor and brand identity, and Ford already in a technical and professional partnership with Red Bull Racing, I think the stars align for them to become the primary sponsor and part owners of the junior team, perhaps under its Lincoln brand since Jaguar's relationship status  with Ford is officially ""It's Complicated"" these days.

I don't think this move would necessarily sacrifice the purpose of VCARB as a driver development development team as Ford has no drivers lined up right now that it's desperate to put in those seats.  They have nothing to lose from continuing that relationship, and something to gain in terms of a steady flow of cost-controlled drivers.  Sure, they'd be no threat to compete for championships, but likely Cadillac isn't either, and they'll be able to make potential profits from being in the grid, on the cheap.

And it will take away some of the accusations Red Bull constantly gets of sneakily double stacking its wind tunnel hours to try to get the most out of their top team's car at the junior team's expense.

Let me know your Top 3.

My predictions:

1. WDC Champion: Charles Leclerc
2. WDC Vice-Champion: Lewis Hamilton
3. Third Place: Lando Norris

I do believe that if Ferrari provides a Championship level car (or even close), Charles & Lewis are both the favorites (I believe they will provide a very good car hence my top 2 but they are interchangeable). 

I think McLaren will have a very very good car but Lando isn‚Äôt ready yet to challenge and same goes for Oscar, he is to inconsistent.

Regarding Redbull and verstappen, unfortunately I don‚Äôt see them delivering a good car for max to be able to challenge for the title next year.

Finally, concerning Mercedes It‚Äôs been 3 years and they still don‚Äôt seem to understand the current regulations and haven‚Äôt show the capacity to build a championship level car. So Goerge won‚Äôt be anywhere near the top, tho he might win 1 or 2 gps.","[""Here's my unpopular opinion, but i don't think Lewis will be very close to charles at all. \n\nLewis has been neck and neck with George, after George just got into the team.

I don't think Lewis will be as quick initially. \n\nBut Carlos was as quick as charles in 2021, so who knows"", ""I don't see how you can have Leclerc and Hamilton 1-2 and say McLaren will have a very very good car.

I think the car last year was temperamental when pushed to the level of competition that was occurring...but the car is fast. And Max has no teammate to worry about.\n\nI think Norris has the most straightforward path if he can keep Piastri under control and they commit to WDC early on.

I suspect the others will be too busy beating their teammate while Max should be comfortably the driver taking the most points for his team.
