The reality? Bigger batteries, more weight, and slower cars.\n\n# Heavier cars, slower racing (just like the SUVs nowadays, a modern BMW SUV is over 2 tonnes...)\n\nTripling the electrical power means you need more energy storage. More storage = heavier batteries.  \nThe FIA says the cars will be “lighter overall,” but that’s mostly wishful thinking. Energy recovery will play a much bigger role, so drivers will be juggling deployment and regen instead of just driving flat out.\n\n**If people want to watch battery management and energy strategy, there’s already Formula E for that.**\n\n# The CO₂ comparison is kind of a joke...\n\nHere’s the thing: an F1 car over an entire race weekend burns roughly **220–250 kg of fuel**, or about **300 liters**.  \nThat’s roughly **700 kg of CO₂** for the whole weekend.\n\nNow compare that to Max Verstappen’s private jet — a Dassault Falcon 8X.  \nOne flight from Europe to Austin for the US GP burns around **12,000 kg of jet fuel** (about **15,000 liters**).  \nThat’s around **36 tons of CO₂** — about **50 times more** than his race car produces in a weekend.\n\n**And that’s one flight. Add up all the private jets, freight planes, and trucks that move the paddock around, and it’s obvious where the real emissions come from. The race fuel itself is barely a rounding error.**\n\n# The “green fuel” part isn’t what it sounds like\n\nSynthetic e-fuels can technically be carbon-neutral, but they take an insane amount of energy to make, and they still release CO₂ when burned.  \nThe only thing that makes them “green” is if the production process uses renewable energy and captured carbon — which is nice in theory but doesn’t make the cars any cleaner in practice.\n\n# So what’s the point?\n\n**The 2026 regs make the cars more complicated, more expensive, and likely slower — all for a “green” headline.**  \n**It doesn’t fix the real environmental footprint of F1, which comes from freight and travel, not what’s burned in the cars.**\n\n  \nAnd more boring races...', ""Why did they strike out Max's eyes?"", 'My thinking as well.

I think it’s continuing to build on the relationships, continuing to build on communication.\n\n“Ultimately, everyone back at the factory really deserves a good result and that’s the sole focus – to get good results, try to maximise, squeeze every point we can out of our performances on the weekends, and I really, really believe that we can do that, so we just stay focused.”\n****', 'I know the prancing horse on that car just wants to gallop right off it out of shame.', 'Ferrari should set out their expectations for Lewis more like. \n\nA podiumless season is unacceptable.', 'angry upvote', 'only ferrari to win any race this season though']",3,6,0.56,3,6,6,2,0,0.040000000000000036,2
