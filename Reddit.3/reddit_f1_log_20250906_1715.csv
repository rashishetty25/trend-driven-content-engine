Just wanted to share some frustration and perhaps also a warning. We bought tickets for an F1 experience at Monza that included a pit walk, trophy photo and a track tour.... So the starter package ü§£

Anyway long story short when we did the pit walk all the cars were covered and garages were basically closed. So you pay a lot of money.... Well for me it's a lot and you end up with this.
