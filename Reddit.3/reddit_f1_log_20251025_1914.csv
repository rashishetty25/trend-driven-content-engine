1oflyo6,The WDC may go down to the wire in Abu Dhabi. Again.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oflyo6/the_wdc_may_go_down_to_the_wire_in_abu_dhabi_again/,2025-10-25, Discussion,"The championship might get decided in Abu Dhabi as we could end up with a 3-way tie in Qatar. I came across this nice website and played around with it a bit: https://ykstv.com

Current points (gap): 
* Piastri: 346
* Norris: 332 (14)
* Verstappen: 306 (40)

Let’s assume we have VER 1st, NOR 2nd and PIA 3rd in the next 4 races. Also, in the sprints we assume that Oscar goes 2nd and 4th, Lando 1st and 3rd, and Max 2nd and 4th.

Projected points:
* Piastri: 346 + 60 (race) + 12 (sprint) = 418
* Norris: 332 + 72 (race) + 14 (sprint) = 418 
* Verstappen: 306 +100 (race) + 12 (sprint) = 418

It’s a very specific scenario that gives us 3 drivers tied going into the last race. Not very likely but not out of the question either.

More likely is that we have something similar play out where their points are not exactly equal  but are close enough that the winner of Abu Dhabi will be crowned WDC.

Hopefully 2025 will not be mired in controversy like 2021.  But who knows? It might be something worse than that. This sport does not lack for drama, on track or off track.","[""Has had to win everything to get close, or McLaren needs to even more fuck up, and then still he has to win everything.
