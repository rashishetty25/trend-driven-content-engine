Let\'s see how it goes.""\n\n> Had it been a normal qualifying session, Antonelli would have beaten Sebastian Vettel\'s pole record by a full two and a half years. However, because it wasn\'t the right qualifying session, the Heppenheim native retains the age record. If Antonelli\'s learning curve continues to climb steeply, it\'s only a matter of time before the teenager starts from the front of the field in a proper Grand Prix.\n\n> With his lap, Antonelli even managed to keep the two more highly rated McLarens behind. Oscar Piastri, in the faster of the Papaya racers, ended up 45 thousandths of a second short of pole. Lando Norris couldn\'t beat Antonelli\'s time either. A tenth of a second behind means third place on the grid. Alongside the vice world champion, champion Max Verstappen will start the sprint from fourth place.\n\n> **H√ºlkenberg narrowly misses top ten.**\nThe two Ferraris were unable to compete for the top spots in Miami. Ultimately, the Scuderia drivers had to settle for sixth and seventh place. Charles Leclerc once again won the internal battle against Lewis Hamilton. Alex Albon, Isack Hadjar, and Fernando Alonso were at the bottom of the top ten.\n\n> Nico H√ºlkenberg narrowly missed the top ten finale, finishing 11th. Still, in a Sauber, that must be considered a success. The road to points in the sprint is long. In Saturday\'s 100-kilometer race, points are awarded only to the eight fastest drivers.', 'YEAHHHHH KIMI!!!!!', 'Anyone have a video of the actual lap?']",41,8,0.83,41,7,7,41,8,0.83,41
