1mqs6kw,Lawson blames set-up gamble for Red Bull demotion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mqs6kw/lawson_blames_setup_gamble_for_red_bull_demotion/,2025-08-15, News,,"[""The demotion actually has given him a chance to save his career. If he stayed the entire year and did significantly worse than Checo (which he already was), his stock would've completely fallen and his confidence would've been shot.\n\nBeing demoted early and then seeing Yuki not do much better has shown that the biggest problem is the car, not the driver.

Liam’s merch was mysteriously delayed for half a year and was set to “release” in June. \n\nBut then you also look at the optics of a Japanese driver in Yuki, sponsored by a major Japanese company, and right before the Japanese Grand Prix. I think they used and abused Lawson, scapegoated him for 2 races and then when Honda waved the big cheque they pounced because they knew it was the only way they could get significant funding this year with how terrible the car actually is.\n\n“Saving” Lawson as they put it was very much an afterthought quip to justify what they did.

Lawson should have performed better than he did regardless. Red Bull were also too quick to demote him and should have put more faith in someone they apparently believed in. The demotion for Lawson was actually a promotion and Lawson is on good form now, which he wouldn’t have shown in that second seat. Yuki’s career is now hanging on by a thread as a result of performing so well in the opening two rounds. \n\nI do think that second seat situation will improve in the next ten races.
