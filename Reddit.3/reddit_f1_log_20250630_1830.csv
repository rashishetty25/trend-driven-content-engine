Turnout was especially big at IMAX locations, where tickets sell for a premium.\n\nThe well-reviewed sports movie led the weekend box office derby in North America, giving Apple a much-needed win in theaters after several misfires, including “Argylle” and “Fly Me to the Moon.” Last year, Apple canceled the wide release of “Wolfs” at the relative last minute, debuting it instead on the Apple TV+ streaming service.\n\n“Apple finally has a big theatrical hit,” said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a leading newsletter on box office numbers. “A lot about this movie looks easy, like a surefire hit, but it’s not. Racecar films and sports dramas have a long and mixed track record.”\n\n“F1” collected an additional $88.4 million overseas, where it played in about 32,400 theaters. Warner Bros. distributed “F1” on behalf of Apple, which used Apple stores, Apple Music, the Apple Maps app and its annual developer conference to promote the film. The marketing campaign was aggressive even by Hollywood standards: Apple also used its Apple Pay system to notify iPhone users about “F1” and offer a $10 discount at Fandango for anyone buying two or more tickets.\n\nApple’s entertainment programming is overseen by Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg. “We’re thrilled by the global response to ‘F1’ and grateful to the audiences who’ve embraced the film with such enthusiasm,” Mr. Erlicht said in a statement. Mr. Van Amburg called the debut “outstanding” and gave shout-outs to the filmmaking team, which included Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time Formula 1 champion.\n\nThe catch: “F1” was expensive, costing nearly $250 million to make and at least another $125 million to market worldwide, analysts said. (Some estimates are even higher.) For Apple to make money, the movie will need to attract substantial crowds in the weeks ahead, when it will face formidable competition in the form of “Jurassic World: Rebirth” and “Superman.”\n\nDomestic ticket buyers gave “F1” an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls. The Rotten Tomatoes audience score stood at 97 percent positive on Sunday, boding well for word-of-mouth.\n\nApple declined to comment on its “F1” spending. Tax incentives and roughly $40 million in product-placement fees helped defray some costs.\n\nCar-racing movies, as Mr. Gross noted, have a mixed track record at the box office. “The Fast and the Furious,” for instance, took in $40 million over its first weekend in 2001, or about $73 million after adjusting for inflation, and started an 11-movie series. (It cost about that much to make.) But “Ford v Ferrari” was less successful in 2019, and the mid-budget “Gran Turismo” sputtered in 2023.\n\nWarner Bros. and Apple had positioned “F1” as a land borne “Top Gun: Maverick,” which thrilled audiences in 2022 and starred Tom Cruise. Both films were directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Ehren Kruger, who wrote the “F1” screenplay, was among the “Top Gun: Maverick” writers. Mr. Cruise helped promote “F1” despite having nothing to do it, turning up at the film’s London premiere and posing with Mr. Pitt in front of a Formula 1 car.”']",115,82,0.86,115,78,78,28,12,0.020000000000000018,28

And if Christian survives that, it only boosts the chances of him getting to sign Max, the driver he’s dreamt of having for more than a decade. \n\nHe must be savouring watching Christian getting slowly stitched up like this with his help and knowing he’s choosing between a decent win and an enormous one.', '> In principle, the world champion would like to stay with the brand that paved his way into Formula 1 and for which he\'s now in his eleventh year. In the future, apparently, only under one condition: The team must reposition itself strategically. This is said to include the demand that team boss Christian Horner either be replaced or have his powers curtailed.\n\nMarko might yet win after all.\n\nMark Hughes wrote this a year+ ago that fundamentally the question posed to RBR\'s owners was: take short-term pain and lose Verstappen but keep Horner, or lose Horner, the fundamental architect of RBR as we know it. Verstappen could be gone from F1 in 5 years, or another generational talent comes along, whereas Horner could still be in F1 in 10 years, and without him RBR are truly...who? What? \n\nI think Wolff\'s slightly backed into a corner that okay Russell is doing absolutely sufficiently to be kept, but even the possibility of *not having Verstappen as a rival* is critical.\n\nI genuinely believe various rumours have been true in the past but changed with time, e.g. Jon Noble said a while ago the AM/Verstappen rumours *were* true, but they\'re just so down in the dumps that all of that cooled off. Similarly a month or two ago the story seemed to be that Verstappen was going to see how things looked mid 2026 and decide then - fine, sensible - but the Merc being ahead stories are *so* prevalent that he might as well get on with it. The engines are in the 3rd trimester at this point. \n\nVerstappen to Merc 2026 would be only halfway down the wild driver transfer stories, over the years.\n\nI liked the point someone made ages ago, like: if you subtract the Dutch/Verstappen, who here is a *Red Bull* fan per se?\n\n> Horner believes that Mercedes has long since reached an agreement with its drivers, but is holding back on an official announcement to lull Red Bull into uncertainty. ""Furthermore, George isn\'t researching the market intensively enough. If he was worried about his place, he would look for alternatives."" Russell confirms this: ""There have been inquiries from other teams, but I\'ve told everyone that Mercedes is my first choice.""\n\nI do personally think that the extent to which Horner has been happy to badmouth Russell in the last year or so, implies he\'s not expecting to phone him any time soon.\n\n> In principle, the world champion would like to stay with the brand that paved his way into Formula 1 \n\nInteresting line from the Dutch guy on The Race recently, that a) there was a sense going into 2025 that we\'d see if RBR could correct the slide from 2024, or rather that their fundamental level is now kind of 4th, and b) that Verstappen is worried that their slide is not merely speed, but operationally they\'re not what they were in 2023.', 'Nothing like a statement headline with a what if opening line.', 'The fall of Red Bull is lovely… simply lovely.', ""I really hope Max joins Merc.

1lo4vqd,Esteban Ocon – The Hidden Midfield Maestro of 2025?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lo4vqd/esteban_ocon_the_hidden_midfield_maestro_of_2025/,2025-06-30, Statistics,"If you’ve been casually checking the race results this season, you might think Esteban Ocon’s performances have been a bit erratic. Haas hasn’t been grabbing headlines, and Ocon’s final race positions often put him mid-pack at best.

But if you dig into the numbers – like his +7 gain at the Austrian GP yesterday – a very different story begins to unfold.

Ocon’s race day consistency has actually been one of the most impressive in the midfield this year – it’s just masked by Haas’s weaker qualifying pace. Across all races so far in 2025, Ocon has gained an average of +3 positions per race, with a median gain of +5. That means more often than not, he’s making solid progress through the field regardless of where he starts.

He’s only lost positions in two races this season (Miami and Emilia Romagna), and in all others, he’s finished higher than he qualified. That kind of consistency shows real race craft – smart decisions, clean overtakes, and the ability to manage tyre and pace well during the race. It also suggests Haas might be making the most of race-day strategies, capitalising on clean air, undercuts or well-timed stops to help their drivers gain ground.

It suggests that qualifying is where Haas – and Ocon – are struggling most. But come Sunday, he’s one of the sharpest tools on the grid in terms of navigating through traffic and maximising opportunities.

He's not in the spotlight much, but maybe he should be. There’s something quietly impressive about drivers who maximise what they’ve got, and Ocon is quietly becoming one of the most dependable racers this season.

Would love to hear what others think – has he been under the radar, or are the midfield margins just too tight to stand out?","['absolutely wild way to orient a chart.', 'SO happy he left Alpine. He seems much happier', 'You can\'t really assess his ""race finish"" position in Emilia-Romagna, mostly because he didn\'t finish.\n\nOcon seems to be struggling in qualifying, but that\'s possibly due to three major factors:\n\n* Midfield is really tight, last week in Q1 there was only 0.312s between 3rd Lawson and 16th Stroll (first driver dropping out in Q1), with P17 Ocon (+0.347) and P18 Tsunoda (+0.352) also being really close. For comparison, 3rd Lawson was +0.345 slower than fastest Norris. Sure, on longer tracks gap seems to be relatively bigger, but even on ""longer"" track like Jeddah, between 5th Sainz and 16th Stroll, there also was only 0.4s gap.\n* Haas doesn\'t look like a good qualifying car in general. During *Steiner Era*, they often shone in qualifying, but later struggled with tyre wear in the race. That started to change with last year\'s car, focusing more on keeping tyres within operating temperature range. That cost them with qualifying performance, as it makes more difficult firing up the tyres. \n* Ocon struggles to keep up his quali pace compared to Bearman. Ollie often looks great in qualifying, especially with performances like Japan. This could be related to their driving styles, because...\n\nOcon looks like better tyre preserver of two Haas drivers. After the race, he was pretty convinced that they could\'ve gone for 1 stopper, but they would have to make 1st stint longer. Ollie seems to be struggling in that area a bit more, which is understandable, as he still is a relatively unexperienced driver, at least compared to a driver that\'s hanging around for like 9 years, having completed 150+ races.\n\nAnd one more thing - obviously, you\'re more likely to gain positions when you\'re starting P18 rather than when you\'re starting P7, but that\'s not changing one simple fact. He\'s sitting P9, ahead of faster cars in inexperienced hands (Hadjar), or experienced hands having even more inconsistent car (Alonso). Question remains how long will he be able to stay on that P9, as Sauber\'s form is significantly improving (Hulkenberg scored in last 3 races, including a cracking race in Spain), and Sainz at one moment will definitely get more luck and start scoring bigger points.', 'This data visualization is absolutely diabolical 💀', '“Maestro” feels like a bit of an overstatement', 'The chart just seems like his results vary up and down each race. Including his starting position might have helped with establishing some sort of pattern.', 'He has been very impressive in races but not seen much by the camera. A bit of a more subdued version of what Sainz used to be in 2019.\xa0\n\nThe fact that Bearman often outqualifies him and sometimes by a lot of places is worrying for Esteban, but he’s usually better in races. \xa0Haas as a team seem much much better in races than qualifyings.\xa0\n\nOcon’s performances in both China and Monaco are two of the best of the season. In China he got P5 after the Ferraris were disqualified and he made one of the best overtakes of the season on Antonelli.\xa0\n\nAnd in Monaco I do not think the car was as good as he made it look. Ocon’s always been really REALLY good around Monte Carlo and he’s a specialist around those streets.\xa0\n\nOverall he’s for sure in the conversation for a top ten driver this year. For me he falls somewhere in the 6-12 region, probably towards the bottom half of that.\xa0\n\nI feel as though Gasly and Ocon are a bit like the Perez and Hulkeburg of the 2010’s.', 'Pele in ""Escape to victory""?']",48,29,0.71,48,27,27,2,1,-0.020000000000000018,2

Now that the dust (and smoke) has settled at the Red Bull Ring, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more **detailed and thoughtful discussion** than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Please avoid low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').","['There were a lot of comments in the Race Thread and Post-Race Thread from people who were unhappy with Oscar\'s strategy and with the radios from McLaren about Oscar\'s flatspot. They thought that McLaren should have called Oscar in immediately after the flatspot. There also seems to be a bit of confusion about the sequence of events, so I went on the onboards to have a look and listen. \n\nLando and Will begin discussing their pit options on Lap 19. At the beginning of Lap 20, Will signals to Lando that he will pit soon. In the middle of Lap 20, Lando gets explicit instructions to box. \n\nImmediately after that, Oscar tries the (at best, ambitious) maneuver that gets him his flatspot. The McLarens continue on for the rest of the half lap. While Lando approaches the pit entry, Oscar gets told that Lando will pit and to see how he does in free air. \n\nSome might say that Oscar could have been told to pit immediately after he got the flatspot. That doesn\'t make sense though. His situation wasn\'t a dire one that necessitated an immediate pit. Furthermore, the mechanics were already in place with Lando\'s tires. Pitting Oscar first would increase chances of a mix-up.\n\nNow, Oscar doesn\'t respond until he gets to the end of the lap. As Tom reiterates that he wants best pace until target lap, Oscar tells him about the flat spot. Tom tells him to see how he does in clear air. \n\nIn the second sector, Tom tells him that the flatspot doesn\'t seem bad on the data and tells Oscar to ""let him know."" In the third sector, Oscar says that it\'s not pleasant but okay. They then do not pit at the end of Lap 21. \n\nThis is supported by the data that shows Oscar go faster than the previous laps and also faster than Lando\'s inlap. \n\nI assume that if Oscar had said or performed otherwise, they would have pitted on Lap 23. Remember that McLaren was also not ready to double-stack since they were presumably already in front of the box with Lando\'s tires when Oscar made his move. Thus, Lap 23 would have been the earliest (safest) time for them to pit.\n\nOn Lap 22, Oscar gets asked the 4 with delta vs. 1.5 behind question. He answers it at the end of Lap 22: 4 with delta.\n\nFor me, McLaren\'s actions seem very reasonable.', 'McLaren are handling it all ok so far, but if Oscar and Lando remain this close up to the last races, it will be all out war.', ""On a positive note, Racing Bulls are finding their footing in several places. It is fantastic to see Lawson get those points, and it bodes well for the sister team, knowing that not only Lawson does have his star moments for solid drives, but he and Hadjar can respectfully work on those collectively, whilst building up confidence and experience on their own as an individual driver. \n\nI don't normally agree with terms branded by the viewers of the sport, but in this instance, there is very little wonder why people are labelling a move to Red Bull from the sister team as a *demotion*. \n\nMore of this from VCARB, please! Sauber and VCARB picking up the pace is fun for the midfield battle in the standings, and I am excited to see them hop into the mix"", 'I know there have been some complaints about the message to Oscar about the move in turn 4 being too marginal, but I genuinely think/wonder if this is something they\'ve talked and agreed about as a team (either at the start of the season, or at the very least after Canada) that they will receive that kind of feedback in race if the situation warrants it. Andrea Stella has said in interviews that they have ""written our racing principles together with our drivers"", so it seems to me Lando and Oscar feel a strong sense of responsibility to be able to have such freedom to race and they take that responsibility seriously. I think Oscar and Lando know exactly how unique the situation they\'ve found themselves in with such freedom to race (without the need for the team to be too worried about other teams/drivers) and they don\'t take that lightly.', ""That was a decent race. First part of the race with Piastri actually being in the DRS of Norris was really fun. I just felt a bit disappointed after the race that Piastri never got back into DRS after the first round of pitstops. I really wanted a close drs battle till the end but we never got it.\n\nI've already mentioned it in another thread yesterday, but backmarkers are frustrating me this season. Watch your mirrors! Listen to your race engineer! Why do they have to almost take the race leaders out?\n\nAlso can I just say that the Red Bull Ring is one of the best tracks we currently have for racing? There isn't just one overtaking opportunity. There are only a few real corners, but the track gives the option for battles to go on for multiple corners and makes the drivers have to actually think about where they overtake another car. I'm happy that it got renewed until 2041. And if we need to have sprints, can we please have it in Austria again next year? It's one of the best places for it."", ""On a different topic I haven't really seen discussed too much, Williams had an absolutely terrible weekend. To multiple problems with Carlos's car starting in quali (I think he damaged it in a trip through the gravel), his car blowing up before the race, and Alex having a mechanical failure while he was P6, forcing him to retire. Hoping they rebound and have a good home race for Silverstone."", ""something is seriously wrong with the Alpine car. Last 2-3 races I think an argument could be made it's legitimatley the slowest car on the grid."", ""I may be mistaken, but at one point toward the end of the race, I thought there was a situation where Lando was lapping a group of three cars, and when he got by the final one, that car then looked to be trying to overtake Lando again and the commentary said that driver does have the right to try to unlap himself.\n\nAm I misremembering and/or misunderstanding something? It seems nonsensical that a car overtaken under a blue flag would be allowed to (immediately) pass the lead car again, since then you're right back into the blue flag where he has to let the leader by."", ""My memory just got jogged by another thread.\n\nBut did anyone else hear Lando's pitwall coach Lando on his lines 'to make it harder for the car following'.\n\nPiastri was running very different lines to Lando in order to keep temperatures down and increase downforce whilst following so close for so long.\n\nDid anyone else find it strange that Lando was getting that style of coaching?\n\nDid Piastri get told of the Lando radio messages about his own pace?"", ""A weekend that is emblematic of Germany 2019, except that it happened to Red Bull. In the kindest way possible, I will never understand [Horner's thought process](https://www.racefans.net/2025/06/29/red-bull-need-to-understand-cause-of-tsunodas-horrible-race-horner/) and unless it is a part of a larger plan, I do not understand how this is not a consequence of a larger problem surrounding Red Bull's outfit, because I am starting to feel like it is\n\nIt is unfortunate that Verstappen's weekend basically ended with sheer bad luck all around. That car had the pace to go to P3 during qualifying, but the fact that both Verstappen and Tsunoda are both reporting lack of grip, especially towards the front in car control, that has to account for something, right? Or is Horner adamant on shrugging it off lightly, like he did with Pérez and Verstappen last year? \n\nIn 2023, the minor problems that their car had were concealed by the ability of a talented driver in going all the way, alongside the other teams finding it difficult to catch up. The same can be said for 2024, except the writing was already on the wall. Alongside the alleged brain drain, 2025 is the hubris from everything that has happened, and now the rumours that Verstappen is considering a Mercedes move is garnering steam, and understandably so this time\n\nVerstappen cannot save their skins all the time. If Horner is really not interested in finding out the core problem behind their string of negativity for all these years, and try to give some thought towards the upcoming regulations, which I am hearing reports that it isn't going too well, then he would just have more of Austria 2025 to follow, and moreso.

Baku, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi, Abu Dhabi (5 races)

China, Japan, Singapore, Australia (4 races)

Canada, Mexico, Brazil, US x3 (6 races)

These now look like 4 logical race series that make up the world championship. A European series, an American series, a Pacific Series, and a West Asian series.

There would be 4 end-of-series races that are much more likely to be a down-to-the-wire points shootout than the final race of the season is.

1lo20vs,Bit of a philosophy question: The next Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lo20vs/bit_of_a_philosophy_question_the_next_verstappen/,2025-06-30, Discussion,"From the surge of the new rookies, one thing we are hearing all the time: He could be the next Verstappen. Antonelli, Lintblad and most recently Dunne. Effect of Max is pretty obvious on F1. But his start of the career wasnt that much different to other recent champions. Few years getting established and then win several titles. Senna, Schumacher, Alonso, Vettel all did it. Hamilton came 2nd in his 1st season and won the next one (but had to wait from more championships few years afterwards).

The real difference is the age. Max came in as 16yo. Unheard of. 

He opened the door to teenage drivers in F1. Every teenager will now be compared to him.

So my question is: What will be required from the future driver to be hailed the next ""Supertalent""? What will it take to change to question from ""Is he the next Verstappen?"" to ""Is he the next Robin Raikonnen?"" (replace Robin with whoever will be the next big thing)

Toto Showed he is willing to give the top seat to a rookie. This might open the door for the opportunities. In my opinion it would have to be a driver that comes very young, under 20 years old and starts challenging the top driver the 1st/2nd season. Like Max did to Hamilton once he was in Red Bull. And he will need to beat Vettels record of youngest champion. 

  
Is this just my recency bias? Before Max, was this being done to everybody? Was Max hailed as next Vettel/Alonso? Was Hamilton hailed next Schumacher? Schumacher next Senna? Senna next Lauda?","['There\'s always the ""exciting rookie"" in F1, although it\'s more rare to have hype for a ""future GOAT rookie"" prospect.\n\nI probably will miss a few names in the time I watched, but Schumacher was definitely propped as ""GOAT rookie"" in 1992, while his few races in 1991 left more of a ""exciting rookie"" vibe.\n\nVilleneuve was ""exciting"", but never really viewed as GOAT stuff, even when winning the title in his 2nd year.\n\nThe next hyped ""GOAT"" rookie was probably Raikkonen.

1lnwr1r,McLaren tactically avoided a fight between Piastri and Norris,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lnwr1r/mclaren_tactically_avoided_a_fight_between/,2025-06-30, Discussion,"As the title suggests, I think McLaren very smartly avoided a fight between its two drivers.

If McLaren knew it was going to be a two-stopper, there was no need to give a delta on tyres. At all times, you’d expect both drivers to have tyres in good condition. In fact, staying within DRS range was more critical, as it could gain you about 0.7 seconds per lap.

They fitted the hard tyres — the most durable — and with McLaren being easy on tyres (even Hamilton noted they could last to the end), they likely knew that once a gap was built, there was no way Piastri could close it, especially since both drivers are similar in pace.

They told Piastri: “1.5s gap now, or 4s with the delta.” This is where Piastri may have made a mistake. He should have realized that staying close to Norris was more important than holding the delta.

Also, once Piastri had the delta, he might have considered avoiding the second stop. After his second stop, Norris was 17 seconds behind with 17 laps to go — yet Piastri and his engineer never even discussed staying out until the end.

Anyway, I hope Piastri becomes smart enough to take strategic calls into his own hands when needed.","[""Piastri was going to drop out of DRS even if he stopped a lap later. I would've liked to see him extend his second stint too, then fit the softs he only did that last Q3 prep lap on. Maybe that would've dropped him even further back though."", 'Tyre delta can be critical for making an overtake work. He had a go for the entire first stint on the same tyres and it didnt really work for him. There was a big risk either way that he would drop out of the DRS after the stop. Same tyre 1.5 Behind isnt really a promising option.\n\nThe idea of going for tyre delta definitly made sense. In hindsight, it probably cost too much time, which may also be related to the fact that he couldnt use clean air after Norris pitted to go faster. The DRS is extremely strong on this track, so whilst he got clean air he also lost that benefit and its not like he saved tyres for this either.\n\nMcLaren left the choice to Piastri and he made a reasonable decision at the time, seeing that doing something slightly different could be his best chance', 'Piastri did take strategic calls into his own hands. Just instead of the 4s gap the team said he will have, it was close to 7', ""The reason Piastri ended up behind Norris after the pitstops was his own decision.\n\nIf McLaren hadn't given him the choice then I'd agree with you but they did and if he'd decided to stay close and put more pressure on Lando it could ahve been very different"", ""Lol you should watch more races with fights between teammates. Try the Mercedes era.\n\n\nThere's an ideal lap to stop and they can't stop both at the same time, so they'll always give priority to the car in first. McLaren then gave the option to Oscar, Oscar was the one that knew how it was to drive close to Lando in similar tyres and made the choice to not do that again. It was Oscar that made the decision not the team.\n\n\nIt's funny, when a team makes a call it's bad because they should've listened to the driver, when they ask the driver it's bad because the team is the one that should know.\n\n\nBattles between teammates a lot of times can become boring because after the first pitstop it's over, since the car ahead will have priority and build a gap in the pits."", "">yet Piastri and his engineer never even discussed staying out until the end.\n\nI really don't think they'd try to maneuver strategy like that to aid a driver on P2 to overtake a teammate on P1.
