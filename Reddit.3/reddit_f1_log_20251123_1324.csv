The accumulated marbles and grease and gunk that come off road cars are usually washed away by precipitation in a place like, say Miami. Las Vegas gets so little precipitation that the gunk and grease builds up to make roads noticably sloppier in wet conditions. The longer you go between baths, the more disgusting your bathwater is.\n\nLas Vegas is not hot and has little precipitation because it\'s in a desert. To be clear it very much is in a desert but importantly, it\'s in a valley and on the dry side of a major mountain which creates a heat dome and disrupts weather patterns. The predominant mountain that looms over Vegas is Mt. Charleston and is often snowcapped half the year, including right now.\n\nLess than 1 hour away from Vegas is a ski resort on Mt. Charleston and it opened it\'s season this week with 30"" (76cm)+ of fresh snow over the last 3-4 days.

McLaren: They have give us a close driver battle for a lot of the year, plus the team seems to have absolutely nailed car development considering this is the final year of these regulations. 

Mercedes: They have been fairly consistent throughout the season and I don't recall any major strategy errors. It's this sort of consistency that makes them a powerhouse and kept someone like George Russell in the running for so long.

Red Bull: Outstanding resilience and Max's resurgence has been absolutely incredible to witness. There was of course the huge controversy and turbulence with the Horner fiasco, but the team seems to have moved past it fairly successfully and swiftly.

Ferrari: The team has always tried to do something different and make something of a difficult year. There have obviously been some serious issues, but I respect the team throwing the dice on some strategies. 

Williams: What an amazing demonstration of team evolution and new organisation can achieve! JV should be incredibly proud of what has happened and looks set to continue happening. 

Racing Bulls: Always in the shadow of the bigger sister team, but has been punching way above its weight. The one-lap pace has been awesome and there seems to be a lot of effort behind the scenes to train the newer drivers. 

Aston Martin: I think their investments into new personnel this year will see them have a similar resurgence to Williams in the coming years. They just need to be cut-throat and efficient to make it happen as soon as possible with the new regulations. 

Haas: For a team that is notoriously small and underfunded, they are achieving some excellent results (especially with Bearman) and doing all this with new drivers and personnel has shown how well the organisation is blending behind the scenes. 

Kick Sauber: Another team that has managed to punch above its weight by taking advantage of some chaotic moments and utilising unorthodox strategies. Nico's podium obviously being a standout moment! 

Alpine: After a turbulent start to the year with lots of controversy around driver changes, personnel changes, and what seemed like a lack of cohesion, the French outfit has shown some flashes of brilliance in the second half of the year when they get everything lined up.

That time gap grew so quickly that my first thought was motor issues?

If this turns out to be a motor issue, will we see Lando taking a grid penalty next race? Could we see a pit start?

I also think about the alternate reality where that happened on lap 35-40 of 50…then this could have REALLY been championship on. 

So; what happened? Do we know?

Heck spa is in the woods and they break over 100k. I get they want to make money but Americans who might want to go to f1 don't want to pay $1,000+ for somthing they can see at home.  The hotels, flights, food are all insane. I get it's cool but no average person can afford that for a hobby. Heck not even for a fun vacation. The fia would be better if they made had some one build a track outside of Lincoln Nebraska. Heck thats crazy but lowkey is sounding amazing now thst i say out loud. 

Cheap hotels everywhere, 5 star hotels, 2 amazing airports, great interstate (auto ban) connecting all this. Wide open land that is cheap as hell. Open building laws. Ridiculous low population outside of the cities. Labor 

Look you laugh but you will have more people visit if it was in Nebraska than in Las Vegas. Not because there is stuff do there, Vegas literally has the most stuff to do than any city, but because in Nebraska there is absolutely nothing to do and because of that everything is cheaper.  Yes there is stuff to do there, alot of awesome stuff actually. Chad Kroger of nickel back said that omaha is the coolest place no one has ever been too. That makes it ideal. Heck it has the ""American museum of speed"".

The state of 2.7 million people has filled a 82,000 football stadium for over 400 games...And the team hasn't been since 1995.  So you have a baked in population that will show up yo things.  yes Vegas has that but clearly half the people didn't show, I dont blame them most Vegas residents barely tolerate the the shenanigans.  

Nebraska would be the combination of having a track in the middle of nowhere (spa, Bahrain) so you can do exactly what you want, but also have a built infrastructure 10 minutes away, (dutch gp) this is Exactly what F1 and more importantly what f1 fans needs. They don't need empty seats, nor do they need to pay billions to build a single building. ","['This is a wild post.
