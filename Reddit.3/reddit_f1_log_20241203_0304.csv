Team principal Fred Vasseur believes that his team did everything perfectly over the Lusail weekend and launches the challenge ahead of the Abu Dhabi GP that will close the season. In the press conference following the grand prix, the Frenchman returned to the strategy adopted in the race and then analyzed the possibilities of the Maranello team in view of the last appointment of the year.\n\n**VASSEUR: ‚ÄúTHE PLAN WAS TO GO EVEN LONGER AND IT WAS WELL EXECUTED‚Äù**\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about the fact that Ferrari was too conservative with its drivers, asking them to take care of keeping tires in the first dozen laps of the Qatar GP. Vasseur rejects the accusations, explaining that the puncture of Carlos Sainz and the subsequent Safety Car changed what were the initial expectations: ‚ÄúThe plan was to return even later, since on one car we did the pit-stop because it had a flat, while on the other because the Safety Car had entered the track. But the initial plan was to return even later. I think we will discuss the history of the VSC for a long time before or not, but the plan was to last longer and the reason for Carlos‚Äôs drilling is only the debris, not the excessive degradation‚Äù.\n\nThe Ferrari team principal believes that even in these conditions the drivers performed everything at their best: ‚ÄúThe initial conduct was too conservative if you know you have a Safety Car on lap 25, but the plan was to go a little longer than that and I think it was the right approach because when we decided to push from lap 12/15 the pace was there and I think we expected to do a long stint. Honestly the initial plan was executed very well by the two drivers and they did a great job‚Äù.\n\n**THE FINAL FLIGHT WITH THE MCLAREN**\n\nThe Qatar GP on paper was the most difficult appointment for Ferrari in this final triptych of races, but the course of the race allowed the Maranello team to shorten on the McLaren on the Manufacturers‚Äô ranking and at the same time Leclerc to arrive at only 8 lengths from Lando Norris. Vasseur underlines the positive surprise of this weekend, promising battle in the final appointment of Abu Dhabi: ‚ÄúWe would have signed before the weekend to score more points than McLaren. We are still alive for the championship and Charles is not far from Norris now. I also think that second place in the overall Pilots‚Äô standings is a good result. I‚Äôd rather have 20 points of advantage than 20 of offset, but let‚Äôs see. On paper I think the next circuit will probably be a little better for us. We fight until the last curve of the last lap‚Äù.\n\nFerrari will show up at Yas Marina with less pressure than McLaren, which instead has everything to lose. Vasseur explained that the Maranello team must continue to focus only on itself, as it has done so far: ‚ÄúIt is not a matter of pressure. The important thing is to do a good job and be fast, then we‚Äôll see. First of all you have to focus on yourself. We managed to make 1-2 on weekends during the season, we have to try to do our best to achieve this goal. But it‚Äôs true that even if we do 1-2, they can be champions. The most important thing is to focus on yourself, don‚Äôt start thinking about what others do. This weekend the approach was very good, because we stayed focused on our strategy without thinking too much about what McLaren or Red Bull were doing. It‚Äôs not said that we‚Äôll be in good shape next week in Abu Dhabi, but we‚Äôll have to put everything together. It‚Äôs always a challenge, but we will enter Abu Dhabi with enormous motivation‚Äù.\n\n**FAR FROM CONTROVERSY**\n\nThe result of the Qatar GP was strongly conditioned by the decisions of the Race Management.

1h5b012,Sergio Perez should not be remembered for the past two years. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5b012/sergio_perez_should_not_be_remembered_for_the/,2024-12-03, Discussion,"
Yes, I know it‚Äôs extremely more easy to dunk on Sergio Perez right now, I‚Äôve been extremely guilty of that. The last two seasons (2023 and 2024) have been quite honestly, beyond awful.  But I think people are forgetting just how good Perez was in the midfield for almost a decade before joining Red Bull.

From his debut in 2011 with Sauber, it was clear Checo had talent beyond the normal pay driver. Who can forget his incredible drive to 2nd place in Malaysia 2012, almost beating Fernando Alonso in a vastly inferior car? Or his podiums that season in Canada and Monza? That year put him on the radar of the entire paddock and got him a seat at McLaren in 2013‚Äîa team that, unfortunately, was on the decline.

But after McLaren, he rebuilt his career at Force India/Racing Point, becoming the king of tire management. Perez consistently punched above his weight, dragging those midfield cars to results they had no business achieving. Baku 2016 was absolutely brilliant in my opinion. 

But his victory in Sakhir 2020 was a masterclass in perseverance‚Äîfalling to the back of the grid after an early collision and still winning the race. That win alone cemented his place as one of the most reliable and clever midfield drivers of the 21st century so far.

It‚Äôs sad to see how his time at Red Bull has overshadowed all of that.. But let‚Äôs not forget the Sergio Perez who kept the likes of Force India alive, paid the team members salaries when they went into administration, was renowned for saving tires that not many others could do (Portugal 2021) , and who delivered consistent results year after year when it mattered most.

It feels like people only remember the bad moments and have erased the years of brilliance he brought to F1‚Äôs midfield. Checo deserved his chances in a top team, even if in the end, it hasn‚Äôt worked out the way anyone hoped.

Whatever happens from here, I‚Äôll always respect Sergio Perez for what he achieved before Red Bull. He was the midfield driver of the 2010s, and that‚Äôs a legacy worth remembering.","['Checo and Hulk will always be the two absolute best midfield drivers of the past decade. They were brilliant together at Force India.', 'He shouldn‚Äôt be, you‚Äôre correct but it will take a few years for the cream of his career to rise to the top in the fan bases memory', ""That's why his decline is so egregiously disappointing to me, really - I remember watching those early seasons at Sauber and thinking he had serious potential, definite race winner and maybe even a WDC. I thought the McLaren move was a season too soon though, he needed another year in the midfield before stepping into the pressure of a major team, and unfortunately not only was that true (in my view at least) but he joined them at the absolute worst possible time.\n\nIf you'd told me back then he'd end up at Red Bull I would've expected it to mean he was fighting for the title, and indeed early '22 it looked like he might have been, even in these recent years he kept a bit of a reputation for his brilliance around street circuits, it just makes it all the more dismal how far he's fallen, and how fast. We talk about drivers falling off the performance cliff but rarely has that cliff been so apparent, and it's largely because he came from very respectable heights."", 'It‚Äôs a bit sad really because I don‚Äôt think you can blame an F1 driver for hanging on for as long as they can. It‚Äôs what they dedicate so much of their time and energy to do and I can‚Äôt imagine it is very easy to say, ‚ÄúI am clearly not as good as I used to be so I will leave now,‚Äù instead of them thinking, ‚ÄòI just need to get back in form, there‚Äôs still a chance to win, next year could be different,‚Äô etc. I bet for the bulk of them (as in, drivers who retire after a run of poor form), even when they aren‚Äôt enjoying themselves as much because of the constant poor performances and the endless criticism, they probably still love the sport and would not be able to easily come to terms with the fact that their last win is already behind them.', 'Maybe he should have left last year. \n\nI hate to say it...but he will be remembered for the last two years.

The gap is 21 points, since McLaren has 640 and Ferrari 619. This is not all the scenarios, but a few to give you a picture of how well Ferrari has to do this weekend, and how bad McLaren has to be. Extra point for fastest lap is not taken into account here, but important not to forget. 

If Ferrari wins the race, a tie on points should also result in win for Ferrari in the constructors due to more wins than McLaren. They are currently tie with 5 wins each. If they end both on tie in points and in number of wins, the number of second places will count, and Mclaren will win constructors.

Entertaining, but a mess. \n\nFirst of all it's so interesting how big of a difference lifting parc ferme after the sprint has made to my enjoyment of sprint weekends. It solved one of my biggest issues last season, with the race basically being a foregone conclusion after knowing all of the teams racepace from the sprint. Now the setup changes can completely flip the top teams around again. In this case it meant that Red Bull went from slower than a Haas on Saturday, to winning on merit on the Sunday. Also a nice showcase just how important finding the right setup is. \n\nNow onto the race direction/stewards decisions. I still really do not understand what happend with the Max grid drop. I'm a bit afraid of the precedent that the stewards have set with it, and I'm not looking forward to people like Alonso and Max exploiting it in the future. \n\nThat mirror probably should've been a VSC a lot earlier. It was also a bit of a mess with the yellow flags. I'm not really sure I like the FIAs explanation but the top 3 during the presser said that it happens more often with debris off the racing line. As far as I know we haven't had confirmation from Ferrari and Mercedes that the debris caused there punctures, but if it did that really screwed over both Lewis and Carlos. \n\nI was a bit surprised at seeing the 10sSG and the DT penalties, but after reading some posts here yesterday apparently those were in line with earlier precedent so I can't actually complain too much about that."", 'Gasly was superb. Zhou had a great race too. Hulk caused 2 DNFs and no penalty even though a race incident should be the responsibility of all drivers involved. He locked and drifted in T1 causing chaos. \n\nRace direction sucked. \n\nThere is so much at stake this extended weekend \n\n- F1 WCC\n\n- F2 championship\n\n- Drivers‚Äô last chance to show off\n\n- Tests on Tuesday\n\nFun times!', ""Spent a lot of time watching track maps and onboards today on the mirror saga. Here are my takes:\n\n* Unless there was already carbon fiber bits on the track, Sainz's puncture is unrelated to the mirror. Sainz was complaining on radio before he got on to the straight. \n* Lewis definitely hit debris from mirror. I think his front left wasn't in the best condition and as soon as it hit that part of track, Lewis felt the vibration and was on radio even before the 1st turn. \n\n* Bottas caused a lot of unintended mayhem, just because he was being lapped. When he hit the mirror, he wasn't racing. He was moving over for Charles. He didn't hit it with his tyre but rather his car's underbody scooped it up. Interestingly Bottas didn't feel anything like a hit. Nor did his pitwall say anything. He did the lap after hitting it, just like the one before with his engineer giving him basic updates. \n\n* Lando not noticing flags seems to be a combination of: his engineer started talking on the radio, just before the flags and the signalling post before the flags being a basic yellow. Max noticed it because he was in clear air and from his onboard, he has like a couple seconds more to notice it. \n\n* I didn't follow it very well but it seems like GP made Max aware of the ground Lando has made up on him with DRS (DRS he got I think by lapping Bottas). Max who did lift for double yellows immediately put 2 and 2 together. \n\n* In my opinion, there were 2 large enough gaps to VSC and get the mirror away. Front 3 had a decent gap to Kmag and there was a gap between Lewis and Gasly I think. The way I read the track map, in each case the front car was about to exit the straight and back car hadn't turned the final corner. The space was there for 2 full laps. Afterwards, I think people upped their speed expecting a safety car and the gap closed up. \n\n* Nobody actually responded to George about why he got put on hards. He yelled it on the radio and his engineer didn't acknowledge it. Just went on giving more diff and balance recommendations. George, to his credit, out his head down as soon as he realised the team wasn't gonna respond."", 'Another great performance from Gasly. He had a  bit of a slow start to the season but he‚Äôs been really on it since ~Spain. His performance relative to Ocon this season has been every bit as good, if not better than what Alonso managed across 2021-2022. He might even sneak inside my top five drivers this season.', ""From the looks of it, seems the marshall on the straight decided to put out double yellows when he saw the mirror on the track, then directors told him to pull them back.  The mirror falls off Albon's car and the flags are out less than 20 seconds later when Max hits the straight, then 30 seconds after when Perez and Hamilton go by, no more yellows.  The double yellows were only waved for 6 drivers.\n\nBased on the FIA statement, this is the most likely explanation, and the punctures forced them to deploy the safety car.\n\nI wonder if this is why the confusing signals were being sent to the board.\n\nEdit: This really should have been a single yellow followed by a VSC to remove the debris.""]",37,119,0.85,37,799,799,-3,1,-0.020000000000000018,-3

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‚Äòround racing friend, for the latest batch of team updates, driver buzz, technical adventures, and trackside stats is ready and waiting for you‚Ä¶

Now let‚Äôs get down to business‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# The Qatar Grand Prix



***Sprint Qualifying / Sprint Race:***

P1. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri

P2. George Russell / Lando Norris

P3. Oscar Piastri / George Russell



**Qualifying / Grand Prix:**

P1. George Russell / Max Verstappen

P2. Max Verstappen / Charles Leclerc

P3. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri



***Throttle & Tread‚Äôs Reaction:***

When you remove the order-jumbling facilitated by the FIA‚Äôs exceptionally poor handling of Albon‚Äôs discharged mirror into T1 (which could have been swiftly dealt with in a lap or two by a VSC) and the sudden resurgence of drive-through penalties, not much went on in this race. However, who doesn't love a little chaos, albeit controversial? Especially when the end result brings some stakes to Abu Dhabi.

***Personal highlights from Lusail include:***

* Zhou‚Äôs‚Äîand Sauberaudi‚Äôs‚Äîfirst points of the year!
* Valterri Bottas elevating himself from 23rd in the WDC
* Pierre Gasly continuing his strong run of form with a solid P5
* Ferrari keeping their WDC hopes alive (with a little help from Lando)
* Lewis‚Äôs absolute rollercoaster of a race: *He dropped 4 positions at the start, picked up a 5 second penalty, asked if the car was broken, got a puncture, pitted, received a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane, pitted, asked to retire, was told to stay out‚Äîthen told to retire, decided to stay out this time, then closed a 12 second gap, gained 3 positions, and finished in P12.*

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

*Welp, I can‚Äôt say I expected this heap of driver rumblings and rumours to hit the airwaves in Qatar:*

Desire for Young Gun Franco Colapinto has been cooled by his recent run of crashes‚Äîmeaning [his shot at a seat in the Red Bull stable is gooone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4plvs/thomas_maher_franco_colapinto_is_off_the_table/)¬†

So assuming there‚Äôs truth to the growing number of [reports that Checo will be let go and/or offered an ambassadorship role](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4uhiz/perez_red_bull_exit_likely_after_abu_dhabi_f1/) a la Danny Ric once the checkered flag waves in Abu Dhabi, Liam or Yuki will get the ride in 2025.

[Estie Besteban Ocon‚Äôs 2024 season came to an unexpected and premature end](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4raqi/alpine_goodbye_esteban_ocon/) in Qatar, [as a condition for him being able to test with his new team‚ÄîHaas‚Äîafter Abu Dhabi.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4bhsq/the_race_ocon_had_to_give_up_final_alpine_race_to/) In his place, [Jack Doohan will make his debut.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qvmd/alpine_team_statement_jack_doohan_will_race_at/)

And *maybe now* we‚Äôll get an end to the hopeful ‚ÄòMick Schumacher returns to the F1 grid‚Äô articles, [given he‚Äôs chosen to leave his Mercedes role at year's end.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uhjk/mercedes_amg_f1_we_can_confirm_that_mick/)

Speaking of reserve drivers, [Alpine has signed F2 rookie Paul Aron as their 2025 reserve](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h38p21/bwt_alpine_formula_one_team_paul_aron_signs_as/)‚Äîstepping in for Jack Doohan who is graduating to a race seat.

*However, Jacky D might be holding his breath,* [*as there have been rumours over the past couple weeks that Franco Colapinto could scoop that seat out from under him‚Ä¶*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3awow/thomas_maher_the_rumours_of_colapinto_switching/) *Which would be absolutely gut wrenching. We‚Äôll see!*

Departing Formula 1 for the second time, everyone‚Äôs favourite viking, [Kevin Magnussesn, seems set to join the BMW M Team WRT in WEC next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3algi/enduranceinfo_wec_kevin_magnussen_on_course_to/)

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

***The F1 grid‚Äôs most recent addition:***

As they‚Äôve asserted all along, ~~Andretti-~~Cadillac‚Äôs preparation for joining the grid in 2026 continues at pace, [with their latest hiring of former Renault engine tech chief, Rob White.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gznb3i/autosport_andretti_lands_former_renault_f1_engine/) But that‚Äôs not even close to all on the matter‚Ä¶

Thanks to some curious combination of Michael Andretti stepping back from the day-to-day operations, potential legal pressure applied by an American DOJ antitrust investigation, and ‚ÄúAndretti‚Äù¬† being dropped from the name‚Ä¶

The General Motors-supported [Cadillac F1 Team *will* join the grid in 2026.](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/gm-cadillac-2026-f1-team-andretti-absent/)

[So far we know that:](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0ajxt/mario_andretti_reveals_his_plans_for_americas_new/)¬†

1. Their ideal driver lineup consists of a ‚Äúyoung American talent‚Äù (with Colton Herta being the top candidate) and an F1 veteran ([Bottas?](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1yi0n/cadillac_f1_interest_2025_indycar_offer_bottas/)). 
2. The Andretti Global organization is building the chassis and running the race team, with GM being responsible for leading the engine side.  
3. Until said GM engine is ready for 2028, there‚Äôs an interim engine deal with Ferrari in the works for 2026 and 2027.

*Now roll up your sleeves for a few more dashes of drama‚Ä¶*

***Audi‚Äîa project in trouble before rubber meets tarmac:***

Thanks to being blue-balled for years and years‚Ä¶ The F1 fandom at large remains skeptical that Audi will follow through on joining F1, at least until they show up on the grid. And making moves like selling 1/3 of the team to the Qatar Investment Authority won‚Äôt help. However, arrangements like these aren‚Äôt unusual in Formula 1‚Äî*At the very least* Mercedes, Renault, McLaren, Aston Martin, and Cadillac don‚Äôt have full ownership of their teams either.

[More concerning than a partial sale are the rumours that their 2026 engine is behind schedule and they‚Äôre having trouble attracting skilled personnel‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h08try/audi_sells_a_third_of_its_formula_1_team/)

***Hot bananas, the FIA is a roaring dumpster fire right now:***

In yet *another* firing, Race Steward Tim Mayer [warns that the FIA is running out of people to fulfill their responsibilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1wax6/andrew_benson_fired_steward_warns_fia_is_running/)‚Äîalso sharing that he was fired because Doodyhead Sulayem was offended by a right of review document.

Further bringing shame upon the FIA and their frustrating leader, Janette Tan‚Äîpromoted to F2 Race Director just one week or so ago to take over for Rui Marques who was elevated to the F1 role‚Äî[has been let go before she could direct even a single race, with Marques now directing both series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uc7o/fresh_fia_upheaval_as_f2_race_director_janette/)

If you want all the details, my hopefully future friends at The Race penned [this article](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/fia-embarrassing-crisis-deepens-ahead-of-f1-qatar-gp/) catching up on ‚Äòthe FIA‚Äôs embarrassing internal crisis.‚Äô

Unfortunately, MBS‚Äôs shenanigans have continued by [removing two top level FIA bankers from office for questioning him on where money was going‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h2gnoo/top_duo_removed_from_office_after_querying_fia/)

More questions of the FIA‚Äôs competency piled up in Qatar after the poor handling of Albon‚Äôs dismembered mirror was left on track, hit and exploded into smithereens by Valterri Bottas, likely contributing to two punctures‚Ä¶

While there‚Äôs no argument about Lando, Lewis, etc deserving penalties for their infractions, the sudden doling out of stop-and-go and drive-through penalties has left teams and drivers frustrated at the lack of consistency.

*Plus* good ‚Äòol [Doodyhead Sulayem thinks that how he runs the FIA is none of the drivers‚Äô business‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h43xey/ben_sulayem_tells_f1_drivers_how_he_runs_fia_is/) Which seems an awfully silly take to this observer.

In closing, [Toto Wolff thinks the FIA could have its own reality show.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qtun/wolff_fia_could_have_its_own_reality_show_amid/)
