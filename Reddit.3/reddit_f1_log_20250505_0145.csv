Instead Albon continued after the Mercedes' and left Sainz behind. It's unclear if Albon was given this message though.\n\nFrom Albon in his post race interview:\n\n>“I think it’s just that there’s a point where you get told it, and I didn’t get told it. I think there was a point where I got told my engine was running hot during the straight where I overtook Carlos. So, um, there’s always a delay—and there was more delay in that moment. Literally, as I was going past Carlos, I was getting the radio message: “The engine’s getting a bit hot.” So it could’ve been a little bit of that. But I’m sure we’ll talk about it.\n\n>Interviewer: Yeah. Have you seen Carlos since, or…?\n\n>AA: I have not, no. At that point, no.\n\n>Interviewer: Were you feeling like, hey, I’ve got lots more pace in this car, I can really go? Because, of course, the two of you worked very well together in Jeddah, sitting in position. But did it feel like there was a big difference to that?\n\n>AA: Um, not a big difference, no. But I think we were just quicker in different parts of the race. I think the first three laps, Carlos was quicker than me—he got past me. I thought I had damage from Turn 3, and I was kind of a little bit in limbo about what was going on with the car. I kind of got into a rhythm, and then I think Carlos used up his tyres, and I knew I had pace.\n\n>We were under threat from the Ferraris behind us, and I just wanted to get on with it. I knew I could catch up to Mark in front of him, and once I got past, I could settle into my own race. So I think Carlos and I were very evenly matched—we’re just quicker in different parts of the race. Jeddah, we worked well together. This weekend, I just felt like I had the pace to get past the cars in front of Carlos. And arguably, I think George got a little bit lucky with the VSC.

That aside, Carlos was asked to open a gap to prepare a double stack for yellow intensity rain in the first stint, leading to a 3 second deficit by the time they told him they wouldn’t need inters after all. This led to him ending up after hulk when he first pitted, then the Ferraris behind him got a free pit stop with Ollie’s VSC. He had just overtaken Charles and built a gap when the second VSC happened due to Bortoleto.

1kelew7,[AMuS] McLaren calls on Red Bull to protest,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kelew7/amus_mclaren_calls_on_red_bull_to_protest/,2025-05-04, News,,"['Translation:\n\n\n> **Red Bull can\'t get to the bottom of McLaren\'s secret. Now a Netflix scene featuring team boss Christian Horner is further escalating the dispute between the title contenders.**\n\n> The Miami sprint has further heightened Red Bull\'s concerns that McLaren holds a potentially decisive championship-deciding trump card. The one-two finish by Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri and the simultaneous zero lap by Max Verstappen are one thing. But what happened in the first ten laps is much more worrying.\n\n> Verstappen was still able to keep a reasonable distance from the two McLaren drivers until lap six. Then, as if by magic, the two Papaya racing cars disappeared over the horizon. This happened precisely at the moment the track began to dry out and the intermediate tires became increasingly hot.\n\n> Who had the best control over tire temperatures? McLaren, of course. And that makes the mystery surrounding the MCL39 even greater. Red Bull has been trying to get to the bottom of the mystery since the start of the season, bombarding the FIA \u200b\u200bwith questions about what is and isn\'t allowed. This is a desperate attempt to draw conclusions from the association\'s answers.\n\n> **Netflix scene causes trouble.**\nBased on thermal imaging camera images, Red Bull has virtually black on white that the McLaren\'s brake linings stay cooler on the outside than on any other car. And that naturally affects tire temperatures. McLaren clearly has absolute control over this. And that could be the match winner, both for a single lap and for the entire race. Because the tires don\'t overheat and therefore don\'t lose grip.\n\n> Red Bull is convinced that it\'s impossible to cool its tires with air alone. Last year, suspicions arose that McLaren was filling its tires with small amounts of water. And this is precisely what\'s now causing McLaren CEO Zak Brown\'s displeasure.\n\n> The American was annoyed by a scene in a Netflix documentary series in which his Red Bull colleague Christian Horner mentioned in a conversation that they had evidence of water in the McLaren\'s tires. Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\n> **Protest fee must hurt.**\nThe McLaren boss is now calling on Red Bull to file an official protest. If, as claimed, they have evidence, it must be brought to light. So that the matter is settled once and for all. Brown suggests that the FIA \u200b\u200bshould set a precedent. ""The protest fee should be high enough that a team will carefully consider whether to actually file an appeal.""\n\n> Depending on the severity of the allegation, the fee should be between £25,000 and £50,000, and this amount should be part of the capped budget. The plaintiff then thinks twice about whether to denounce another team without sufficient evidence or develop a new front wing with the money. Brown considers the allegation untenable from a technical perspective: ""Water in the tires would mean additional weight, and tire pressures would skyrocket during warm-up.""\n\n> The FIA \u200b\u200balso considers the activism against McLaren to be excessive. Since the first rumors of the water theory circulated at the 2024 Brazilian GP, \u200b\u200bFIA technicians have double- and triple-checked the McLaren in the areas in question. There have never been any complaints. Of course, the brake linings and what\'s hidden inside are also in focus.\n\n> The regulations set clear limits on the exterior design. Under the hood, there\'s freedom with the airflow and materials. Cooling elements or heat exchangers in the wheel carrier area are prohibited. In the gallery, we show you the different solutions on the cars of the top teams.\n\n> Apparently, McLaren has somehow managed to separate the air so that the brakes (hot) and tires (cold) remain within the desired temperature range. The fact that McLaren is doing something different from the competition is also evident in the behavior of the mechanics. During certain work on the car, they form a wall in front of the car, thus forming a screen against curious photographers.', 'There is something insane with the Mclaren once the track is drying, same last year and they suddenly just pull a 20s gap after being on the same pace as other cars prior, both cases, Australia this year, it got negated by a safety car.', '> Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\nIts cool to see a traditional team like McLaren back on top in F1 but holy fucking shit the team would be so much easier to root for if Brown would talk less. I want Horner vs Toto back that was way more fun.', ""I don't get why teams take it so personally when other teams think they might be doing something. \n\nAt the end of the day every team has a right to question other teams and maybe protest if they want. \n\nIf you've nothing to hide then who cares about a protest"", '>Brown lost his temper. ""This is clearly going too far. There\'s a team that\'s constantly trying to destabilize us with accusations along these lines.""\n\nDidn\'t McLaren spend years protesting RBR and Merc? Protesting and shit throwing is nothing new in F1, Brown should know that better than anyone.\n\n>\n\n>\xa0""The protest fee should be high enough that a team will carefully consider whether to actually file an appeal.""\n\nAnd this is so backwards thinking, McLaren should be investigated just for saying this. That will just allow teams to cheat, and others would be too scared to protest. His orange friend from the visit last year holds the same beliefs.', 'I’m not going to lie, I want to see what a full on fight between Zak and Horny would look like across a full season lmao \n\nI liked the Toto v Horner, but we can’t wait forever for Merc to finally catch up and actually challenge CONSISTENTLY (I said this for the people that are going to come and talk about good results) for championships and wins, so this is the best alternative', 'If its not true, why care so much to respond almost angry like this and wanting to raise prices of protests? Why wanting to create a situation where smaller teams can not afford to protest while hoping bigger teams get pushed off from doing it to save money? \n\nAt the same time, if you have nothing to hide, why get angry? Just let them try and waste their time and effort right? It kinda creates the idea you have something to hide. \n\nThey did find something, that is clear. Could be they are nervous that a protest could expose the legal thing they found for everyone to copy?', 'Interesting topic, but I have a gut feeling moisture inside the tyres isn’t the trick making McLaren that much easier on the tyres.\n\nIf it was, the FIA would’ve caught it by now, with the extra inspections done late last year and perhaps also this year.\n\nI do think the idea McLaren is much better at cooling the brakes or brake lining has merit, but they might be able to do it differently than what’s assumed (by Red Bull).\n\nI don’t know if its possible to use the brake fluid itself as an ‘accidental’ coolant or heat absorbant.

From the Formula 1 Miami Sprint Report:

“ However, following the Sprint it was confirmed that Albon, Lawson and Bearman had all dropped out of the points, with the Thai racer handed a five-second time penalty for not staying above the minimum time behind the Safety Car while Lawson received the same punishment for causing a collision with Alonso.

Bearman was also hit with a five-second penalty for an unsafe release from the pits, with these changes promoting Russell to fourth and Stroll to fifth while Yuki Tsunoda, Antonelli and Pierre Gasly moved up into sixth, seventh and eighth respectively.”

Issue #1 - Cutting away at critical moments.
China - Max vs Norris pit exit they cut away to show Leclerc's regular pit stop.
Bahrain - Instead of showwing Piastri crossing the finish line in 1st they showed Norris and Russel who weren't fighting that close.
Miami - Max vs Norris on lap 16 cutting to a replay of the previous overtake.
(So many more examples)

Issue #2 - The timing board not showing the intervals or just not working at all.
Issue #3 - The unnecessarily long shots of someone in the Crowd/VIP section in the middle of the race.
Issue #4 - Taking too long to show a replay of something we missed.
Issue #5 - The lack of Radio Replays & often times the extreme delay of them (Ex. Miami Qualifying- It wasn't until 10 minutes later, after doing the interviews did we get a replay of max's reaction to him getting pole).

This issue wouldn't be much of a problem if all I had to do was switch broadcasting channels, but F1 doesn't work like that because the same display is given to every channel world wide and the best thing I can do is open up all the tabs from multiviewer and make my own version of a TV Directing with the onboards.","['There has been a notable, marked change for the worse.

In Miami the SF-25 was fifth force on the track, slipping even behind Williams, with only small flashes of light with the Sprint Qualifyng of Charles Leclerc (however with a 3 tenths gap) and above all the Sprint Race with the strategy call of Lewis Hamilton. It was certainly the worst performance offered by the Rossa in this championship, which will arrive at Imola with its world championship dreams already compromised and a very deficient car. Frederic Vasseur in the post-race analysed the Ferrari race from pure performance, to problems, to driver management and the near future. \n\n**Vasseur: \'We have to solve the problems in Qualifying. McLaren in race on another planet. Right strategy, we followed our whole rulebook"".**\n\nThe race reads 57 in 57 laps for Ferrari compared to McLaren and this testifies to a very tough time, with a poor performance. ‘McLaren was definitely on another planet, our performance was similar to that of Red Bull and Mercedes’ commented Team Principal, Frederic Vasseur ‘Max tried to stay with them but he totally ruined his tyres’. The Frenchman was asked again about the famous potential of the SF-25 that has been talked about so much, but he has a different idea for this weekend. ""We didn\'t find the best balance. Yesterday we struggled a lot and our best lap in Qualifying came on used tyres; it\'s the first time this has happened in 2 years. This is frustrating. We have to work and fix our problems, one by one, and improve.""\n\nThe pace of the Rossa was significantly lower than that of the MCL39, as mentioned, but Vasseur\'s main focus is on the exploitation of the tyres to make the car run at its best. ""It\'s much more a question of the tyres than the characteristics of the car. At times we were able to extract much more potential from the tyres than this weekend, and from that comes the performance."" Going into the substance of the race, given the lacklustre pace and the fifth force on track - with one Williams in front and the other just behind the two SF-25s - the focus was on the drivers\' team radios and Ferrari\'s race strategy. ""We were the only team to swap on track today, but I think it was the right choice. Lewis had a softer tyre and we wanted to try to catch Antonelli. We followed our internal rules. When we saw that he could not catch Antonelli, we did the swap again,‘ said Vasseur, who defended the team\'s choice. ’It is never easy to ask drivers to give up their position, but they obeyed and I think it was the best choice.\n\nNow there will be a week\'s break and then Formula 1 will return to Europe, with the first of the two Italian races, and Ferrari will have to try to redeem itself at Imola, where Frederic Vasseur is convinced we will see a better SF-25. Will it also be supported by developments? ‘We will have something to take a small step forward and then there will be another step in Barcelona,’ he told Sky Sport F1\'s post-race microphones, but the focus should not be on developments. ‘We have to find the best compromise with the car and put everything together.’', 'Is this step forward or backward?

That said, I still have gripes. The chicane under the bridge is awful, clumsy and out of place and I really wish there was some grass or gravel to punish mistakes. The ever-present concrete runoff strips the track of consequences and character.

Only 6 times in the most dominant period the sport has ever seen did Mercedes have as big a gap as this at the end of a race,

Spain 2014, Brazil 2014, Spain 2015, Canada 2015, Belgium 2015 and China 2016.

And in all of these races Mercedes were on pole and led going into the first corner.

The McLaren's were 3rd and 6th after lap 1 today and still pulled this gap. ","['The McLaren was absolutely dominant today.\n\n\nThat said, I would be interested to know how many races were impacted by SC/red flags, and whether that changes anything for these teams. Also pitting for fastest lap.', 'A little side note: Mercedes had the engine turned down for the majority of 2014. Especially at the start of the season. They actually thought they would lap the field if they didn’t turn it down. Which isn’t a crazy thought considering how much better the engine was than Renault and Ferrari.', ""That's because they didn't want the FIA to find out how strong their engine was.\n\nMercedes pulled 24 seconds in ten laps in Bahrain 2014 while fighting around every corner, including 4.6 seconds in the very first lap after the safety car restart. They could have lapped the entire field every week if they wanted to.\n\nThis was a huge victory for McLaren but that Merc was something we might never see again."", ""McL was dominant today but still not the most dominant we have seen in this period. It's pretty important that they both had to push because they were racing each other and not managing the race comfortably, and the race had no SC/Red flag to close the gaps unlike others, while the VSC gave them 5-10s of racetime to their nearest competitor (VER), who was compromised by RUS a bit at the end as well. Still a scary display, but Merc's equivalent was ridiculous."", 'Thanks for updating this stat. The fact that Max is in contention at all given how 2014/2015 Merc were compared to the rest of the field is incredible', 'This is so hard to determine though because most dominant teams build a gap and then cruise to the finish. Turning down the engine and just managing the race comfortably. \n\nLook at Bahrain 2014 as an example of just what Mercedes were capable of when they really wanted to. After that late race safety car Hamilton and Rosberg were battling each other fiercely costing each other time and yet they were still pulling out seconds per lap over the 3rd placed car. \n\nOr look at 2021. Hamilton and Verstappen pushed each other all the way and so they were often 1-2 and close together but some 30-40 seconds ahead of their team mates who would be 3rd. This shows just how much they would keep in reserve during their dominant eras and how much they could have crushed the field if they really wanted to push all the way when there wasn’t another driver/team to fight with. \n\nSo ultimately this stat is meaningless because we never see the best of what dominant teams/cars are capable of because they keep it hidden unless someone comes along to push them into revealing their true pace.', 'One team winning %90 of the races is not a fun watch.

You can't force them off, but you have the line, so don't need to leave space.\n\nThe-Race video also shows the changes for this year when overtaking on the outside, and it was implemented on the Lawson penalty. last season, I don't think Lawson would have got a penalty.\n\nTo be entitled to be given room when overtaking on the OUTSIDE, the overtaking car must:\n\n*i) Have its front axle AHEAD OF THE FRONT AXEL of the other car AT THE APEX*\n\n*ii) Be driven in a controlled manner from entry, to apex, and to exit.*\n\n*iii) Be able to make the corner within track limits.*\n\nThese changes, combined with the dirty air increases this season, are likely really bad for racing, but this is what the drivers want and the FIA has listened.\n\nImportant to note that Verstappen was penalised for leaving the track and gaining an advantage, which is also covered in the video.

1kenwnb,[AMuS] The great Pirelli puzzle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kenwnb/amus_the_great_pirelli_puzzle/,2025-05-04, News,,"['Translation:\n\n\n> **Max Verstappen beats both McLarens. Andrea Kimi Antonelli misses pole position by 67 thousandths of a second, leaving teammate George Russell in the dust. Ferrari is nowhere to be seen. Even experts struggled to explain the qualifying result in Miami.**\n\n> McLaren is dreading a fast qualifying lap. The slightest mistake is enough to lose pole position. For the third time after Suzuka and Jeddah, Max Verstappen is taking advantage of this. In the first two cases, it could have been attributed to the track layout. Suzuka and Jeddah feature mainly fast, flowing corners.\n\n> The Miami Autodrome is different. Only the first sector is Red Bull territory. The rest is almost exclusively made up of tight corners that require a lot of maneuvering. Not exactly Red Bull\'s specialty. Until Q2, things were fine. Verstappen pulled away from everyone in the first sector. The McLarens made up the deficit in the other two sections.\n\n> Only in Q3 was everything different. For the first time, Verstappen lost less time in the second half of the track than he gained at the beginning of the lap. There were three reasons for this. Verstappen managed a nearly perfect lap, apart from a small wobble in Turn 1. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri made too many mistakes.\n\n> **Unusual result.**\nFinal fine-tuning of Red Bull\'s setup minimized the damage in the slow corners. But the most important factor was the track temperature, which had dropped from 44 to 38 degrees Celsius by the end of the session. McLaren couldn\'t exploit its strength of keeping the tires in the window throughout the entire lap as much as it had in Q2. The opposition suffered less, however.\n\n> With the minimal gaps in the field, the condition of the tires determines the lap time. Small things have a big impact. If the tire is too cold or too hot, it provokes mistakes. Verstappen, Piastri, and Antonelli in the first corner. Russell, Norris, and Hamilton in the hairpin at the end of the straight. When, like Andrea Kimi Antonelli, they\'re only 0.067 seconds behind the fastest time, it\'s doubly frustrating. ""I was too greedy in the first corner.""\n\n> At least it was enough for the rookie to once again win the team battle at Mercedes. George Russell only started from P5: ""Qualifying has actually been my strength this season. But whatever has worked so well so far isn\'t working here in Miami. Kimi did a great job. He drives a little differently than I do. This obviously puts the tires in a better window. I didn\'t find confidence. It went from one extreme to the other. It was the worst qualifying of the year. In the end, fifth place – it could have been even worse.""\n\n> **Are used tires faster than fresh ones?**\nSometimes things get really complicated, as in the case of Ferrari. ""We were faster on used tires than on new ones,"" puzzled team principal Frédéric Vasseur. Lewis Hamilton saw things somewhat differently. He would have liked to have had two new Pirellis in the Q2 session instead of just on the second run. ""If we\'re already having trouble getting into Q3, it would probably be better to try it twice with fresh tires. We\'ll have to discuss that again.""\n\n> Charles Leclerc couldn\'t pull himself out of the fire in eighth place either: ""Something was strange today. We need to analyze it. I was completely outside the window of the car. From Q1 to Q3, we had to make a lot of changes. That\'s unusual. But it never felt good. It hurts when you\'re doing your best and your best in a Ferrari is only P8.""\n\n> The Monegasque lost four of the seven tenths to the opposition in the first corner alone. The Monegasque set the fastest time in the final sector. This isn\'t the first time Ferrari has struggled with this problem. ""We also gave away three tenths in the first corner in Jeddah,"" Vasseur reveals.\n\n> This clearly indicates that the tires are heating up too slowly. In qualifying, this is a killer. In the race, it can be a wildcard because it reduces tire wear over the distance. Then a Ferrari is almost as good as a McLaren. The difference is that the Papaya races can do both: fire up the tires quickly and keep them alive over the distance.', 'Why don’t they have a tire that’s somewhere between the intermediate and wet, or even a hard/soft intermediate. I feel the full wet is worthless, unless it’s quasi-undriveable conditions.', 'What was Lewis talking about two set of new tyres for Q2 for him to get through? He took two new sets in Q1, and you need to keep one set of new soft for Q3 or if you don’t get to Q3 it will be for the race, so he only has one new set for Q2. He doesn’t have two new sets for Q2. Or he is implying the team should only use 1 set of new in Q1 but it risks him not getting through Q1…', ""The inter is just an incredible tyre. There's no need for a tyre in-between the wet and inter because the inter can cope with a wide variety of conditions already. \n\nThe wet is just super slow. The inter is multiple seconds a lap faster."", 'They should have only 1 wet weather tyre. WEC for example only has a ""full wet"" equivalent and it works perfectly fine.\n\nSave money, avoid wastes, make it really hard to simply race a wet tyre into a dry track so that strategy and driver\'s abilities are even more important.', 'BRING BACK THE GROOVES!\n\nBut only as a special inter-intermediate compound!', ""I think he meant that if you're unsure if you're going through to q3, it's better to use two new sets in q2 to make it through, instead of saving one set but then not making it through. If you need to, you can do q3 on the used sets"", 'Exactly, the irony us that Pirelli designed a very great tyre with the inters meanwhile the full wets having such a narrow window between too dry to use and too wet to race for the cars that it only works on a flat track and when the race has been started.', ""Yeah. Realistically we just scrap the wet tire. \n\nCall the intermediate wet. They won't run in conditions that a wet tire will be the choice. It looked like it in Brazil last year.

However I do think saying the success of Red Bull in the ground effect era is due to Newey is very overstated. I think Rob Marshall was the key to the RB18’s and especially the RB19’s success. Red Bull’s first upgrade package after Marshall left Red Bull late May 2023 was I think the first upgrade where they claimed they made a misstep. Furthermore, Marshall’s new team is McLaren. After gardening leave he got to work on the MCL38. The first upgrade package was the Miami upgrade. The race which Lando won, and the first race where McLaren made arguably the quickest car. His first full fledged McLaren is this year’s MCL39. While it’s no RB19, it’s eerily similar in high deg tracks.

Rob Marshall being the chief of car design and implementer of his vision (which I think is the opening anecdote of Newey's memoir) can easily fit the vision of both of them being integral to Red Bull's run of dominance. \n\nI'd also say that the real way to test this would be to see Red Bull having a prolonged run with Newey but without Marshall, and we just don't have that data. The reporting on the Christian Horner sex-pest fallout makes it very clear that Newey was checked out at Red Bull for sometime before the announcement (at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix, which is your inflection point for Marshall at McLaren) that he was leaving Red Bull and that Red Bull technical leadership had been shifting for sometime to the rest of the team.\n\nTo put it differently, I think there's a very strong case to be made that Rob Marshall is an elite designer in the Ground Effect Era, but that's not zero-sum with Adrian Newey not being elite and it's going to be incredibly hard to disentangle the effects (hah) of Marshall from Newey at Red Bull. The best way to test this is to see how next year's Aston Martin (which should be a Newey product) compares to its McLaren competitor, and how they develop from there."", 'Newey might not be the miracle worker some think (watch Aston Martin become championship contenders next year) but the guy still left an huge impact on red bull', '100% agree', 'Wasn’t Grand Prix Driver the doc that was shown in.']",13,15,0.61,13,13,13,13,15,0.61,13
1kex0hm,Should Ferrari have swapped the cars earlier?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kex0hm/should_ferrari_have_swapped_the_cars_earlier/,2025-05-04, Discussion,"I feel like a lot of the discussion around this topic is being heavily influenced by Sky sports coverage and Lewis’s radios. But from my perspective, it’s not as clear cut as it seems

But why didn’t Ferrari swap them?

First of all i’ve seen some people saying ‘they kept him behind for 10 laps’ ‘should’ve swapped before they overtook Sainz’. So why didn’t they swap before they overtook Sainz? Lewis just wasn’t close enough. 

The VSC cut Charles’s advantage over Lewis and Charles pit a lap later.

Lap 31: Charles is on one lap old hards that are not properly up to temperature, Sainz gets past and Lewis 2.3 behind.

Lewis does gain about a second that lap on Charles, but Charles is now behind the williams and it’s cold hards vs a lap older mediums, and since Ferrari in particular have faced issues warming up hards, a pace difference is expected

For the next almost lap, the gap lingers around 1.2-1s, but Lewis doesn’t properly break DRS until the VSC is called.

So between lap 30 and the end of the VSC on lap 34, there was no opportunity and Charles uses the VSC restart to get past Sainz and Lewis comes along with him.

The way the overtake happened meant Lewis was instantly in Charles’s DRS. Which means he never actually got into Charles DRS on his own. He had one lap where he was much faster but even over the next lap before the VSC, he couldn’t do much to get into DRS.

But now he’s in it, seems to have the better tires and better pace. Why didn’t Ferrari swap them on lap 35? Well, by the back straight, Sainz is in Lewis’s DRS and Lewis is 0.6 behind Charles at the point where DRS would open. No question that they could not risk a swap then.

What about lap 36? Well back straight, Lewis is almost 0.8 behind and Carlos is still within DRS. No question that they couldn’t do the swap that lap.

What about lap 37? On this lap, Lewis does manage to lose DRS to Sainz but by the back straight? Again over 7 tenths back with Sainz less than 1.2 back. Still way too risky.

What about lap 38? Starting to look more viable as Sainz fell back a bit in the lap but by the back straight he caught up a bit and it’s Lewis 0.6 back and Sainz 1.2 behind again. That’s still a very uncomfortable margin for Ferrari to mess with, considering that Sainz proved that the Williams has the pace to keep a Ferrari behind it. Last thing they want to do is risk losing p8.

What about lap 39? Well that’s when they finally did swap.
Lewis 0.7 behind at the point where DRS opens and Sainz now over 1.6 behind.

By the start of the pit straight Sainz is 0.9 behind Charles. If that’s done a lap earlier that’s 0.5 by the start of the pit straight at least, leaving Charles incredibly vulnerable. 

So I truly don’t think there was an opportunity to swap the cars before the lap they did it on. They maybe could’ve done it, but it’s an unnecessary risk. It’s one thing to tell Charles not to fight if Lewis has the pace to overtake. But this required Charles to slowdown and they did not have enough of a margin behind for that to be comfortable.

I want to add that i’m not an expert, i’m just a fan giving my insight and all my information is from youtube live timing not any official source. Also the lap is based on where the leader is so when it’s lap 36 but i’m talking about the back straight then the drivers are probably actually on lap 35  ","['Imagine being paid to be a strategist and the most obvious scenario wasn’t planned out. People are questioning the indecision more than the timing.', ""Yes, he was on faster tires and the hard was at that point known to be shit early on.

It’s probably pretty low. I can see them opposing this, I get the sentiment there.\n\nWhat is the overlap between white wealthy people and formula one? Probably higher than the previous comparison. In fact I bet it’s probably one of the bigger demographics for F1 in US given that it’s been historically perceived as a European and elitist sport. Something those of wealth regardless of background or race are way more likely to watch I would assume. Why wouldn’t they want the race to be in nice places, they have them in Monaco and many other wealthy areas they’re likely familiar with.\n\nProbably because there’s truly a massive logistical difference between hosting a street course IN MIAMI vs. using a semi dedicated area that already exists for a purpose built track and already has procedures and infrastructure in place for large gatherings and mass exodus’ post-event. \n\nThere’s definitely a lot more to say here, but I don’t want to speak in generalities and I don’t want to provide an opportunity for any racist dog whistling so I’ll just say this: they’re making a lot of jumps that  don’t really line up to me as someone from south west Florida and with good general knowledge of this area.', 'No worse than a football game and it brings wealth to the area.', ""Oh, F1 is gaining popularity in America?

1kewbbl,Best Piastri fan I have ever met so far.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kewbbl/best_piastri_fan_i_have_ever_met_so_far/,2025-05-04, Discussion,"Hello All, I got to say this. I am in Munich right now, and was wondering how to watch F1. The internet suggested me to go to Killian Irish Pub (I am no sponsored by them), the environment is very vibrant. I have been to a couple Irish pubs for football matches when I was in US, but did not get a chance to meet a lot of fans of my team.

This time for the Miami Race, I met this Australian guy, who was cheering on for Oscar since the beginning of the race, and made it a festival as Oscar overtook Max. He bought a bunch of drinks too.

Apparently his kid used to race with Oscar back in the day. A bunch of us from different nations, randomly started chatting with him and got to know more about him, and basically had a lot of fun. I barely at my phone as I was mostly was either chatting or listening to the stories through out the race, and missed how Ferrari screwed the strategy yet again. And there was one Polish guy among the group, I think who does the drink I got (Heineken) and suggested me a great beer. 

I guess what I want to ask is, you guys have any such stories with you. I bet back in the no internet days, you had more time most of us had the time to talk to people. Have you had any such fun stories? Met random guys who can rally the people and make it a joyful occasion?

Also, I am a Ferrari Fan and United Fan, so I hope some of you guys might understand that this is one the best things happened during race or match days lately. So, for this year, I am an Oscar suporter.","['I was at Silverstone 24, when Lewis won his first race in a few years. There was a lady in her 80s nearby in the stand, all decked out in her Lewis gear, who was over the moon. We got her phone number, legged it to the fanstage to get a good spot near the front, then called her when Lewis was coming on to get her to come find us.\n\nLewis crowd surfed right over us, and we got her up to the barrier to see him the best she could.

1kez2sn,Let’s discuss Yuki Tsunoda and RB's performance today — P10 but only matched Hadjar’s pace in the VCARB,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kez2sn/lets_discuss_yuki_tsunoda_and_rbs_performance/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"So Yuki grabbed P10 today, but looking at the lap times, his pace was almost identical to Isack Hadjar in the VCARB, who’s a rookie.

That’s... a bit concerning, right? You’d expect a seasoned F1 driver in a full-spec RB to comfortably outperform a junior driver in a less developed car. I am not sure what to make of it.  Sure Max is outperforming the car but is the VCARB actually the better car? What happens if we put max in vcarb? Is the other side of RB garage just simply worse? What's going on!","['We have seen the same movie for the past 4 years at this point', 'No matter who you put in RB 2nd seat, it’s gonna be hard for them to adjust or be better than who they were.

Max can get the best out of it, and no one else is max\n\nAs simple as that', ""I don't get why the same discussion has to be had after every race.  \n\nThere's a reason some folks genuinely wondered if this was a step up for Tsunoda.  The VCARB is a good midfield car, much easier to handle than the Red Bull.  Getting 100% out of the VCARB will put you on pace with a Red Bull at 80%, as we're seeing.  \n\nThe question is - can anyone besides Verstappen get more than 80% out of the Red Bull?  The answer may be 'Nope'."", ""Yuki gets a free pass til the end of the year. Putting Hadjar in would just be Lawson 3.0. Wait til the end of the season to see how he's doing"", ""He kept the car on the road and ended in the points, that's already a massive step up from what they had as the 2nd driver since Checo lost all confidence with the car."", '![gif](giphy|kZD8cN1MycfKw)', 'As max said at last year’s Miami GP\n\n“If if if, if my mom had balls she’d be my dad”', ""Ahh the classic 2nd RB driver mid performance post.\n\nLooks like it's Yuki's turn this time.

From the team's point of view, the penalty was inevitable and that exact penalty was expected. Now obviously it is/was in Red Bull's interest to get the penalty sooner so that they could serve it sooner (say if the SC at the end doesn't happen). However that applies to every team in any situation involving penalties. Also, from a racing point of view, getting penalties sorted out sooner rather than later is generally considered to be a good thing. This particular thing resulted in a penalty being announced when they were finishing under a SC but the fact that nothing could be done about it makes it pretty much equivalent to a post-race penalty or a penalty handed out in the final few racing laps. What do you think?","['The penalty was given pretty fast, the timing of the SC was just pure unlucky.', ""so you mean the team admits fault?\n\nstill wouldn't work, always have the delay of a referee needing to check, maybe they did something worse"", 'I don\'t think any kind of way for teams to affect the process of aplying a penalty should be allowed outside of formal appeals and things like that\n\nif the case is so eggregious that you know 100% sure that a penalty is coming the penalty might be more severe than standard, so teams ""requesting"" the penalty to cut the investigation short could also benefit them', 'Because teams should not be allowed to be in any way involved in the penalty decisions. 2021 exposed the problems with this.\n\nThere are incidents where they can give the place back though to save a five second penalty.

They also often might not feel like they are wrong even if it is black and white. Its also just a dumb idea to even let teams do this."", ""It would still need to be checked. Maybe the incident is actually worse than what the teams admit to. So it wouldn't really make a difference."", 'Because penalties are not cut and dry. \n\nUnsafe release from a pitstop was 5 seconds for Bearman. It was 10 seconds for Verstappen.

That way you wouldn\'t need communication between the team and race control/stewards, and if the actual penalty is harsher than expected and what the driver has already served, you just add the rest afterwards.', 'Giving teams any mechanism to attempt to negotiate or meta-game their penalty is a bad idea.']",0,31,0.24,0,30,30,0,0,0.0,0
