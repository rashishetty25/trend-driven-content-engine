1j91lec,Race wins coloured by constructor and driver,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j91lec/race_wins_coloured_by_constructor_and_driver/,2025-03-11, Statistics,,"[""When you take into consideration that the vast majority of Mercedes' and Red Bull's wins took place within the last 15 seasons, it does put into perspective just how massive their sucesss has been."", ""Isn't Renault the same as Alpine?"", 'I think splitting it up by competing name was a bad move. Alpine and Renault were more or less the same given they are both the Enstone team.', 'Hi everyone!\n\nThis is an updated version of a post I did some years ago ([here](https://reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/gnce67/race_wins_colored_by_team_improved_version/)). All data comes from [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/) (thanks!).\n\n### Constructor Race Wins I\n\nTo start: constructors/teams [1] race winners (with at least 20 wins). Dots inside of the squares are used instead of similar colours to more easily identify the teams. I tried to choose the most famous historical colours of the team, but sometimes I had to pick other colours to make the image more readable - for instance, McLaren got the more recent orange rather than the traditional red/white/silver. Indianapolis 500 winners are marked separately because, despite being part of the F1 WDC, most F1 teams did not participate in it and vice-versa.\n\nMercedes dominance between 2014-2020 creates a very visible teal mark, but we can also see other teams with strong year(s): Mclaren in the end of the 80s, Ferrari in the 50s and 00s, Red Bull last years (2021-2024). The legacies of Ferrari, and McLaren are clear: the largest interval between wins was 4 years (!) for Ferrari (1990 - 1994) and 9 years for McLaren (2012 - 2021). Williams was also very impressive in the 80s and 90s, but since then they\'ve had only a few wins in the early 2000s and their last win in 2012 (by Maldonado).\n\n### Constructor Race Wins II\n\nWe can expand this plot to all race winners, and also add columns with the WCC winner and the team with the most wins. There are some years where multiple teams have the same number of wins, and in those cases the WCC, if one of them, is selected (otherwise it\'s random).\n\nThere are some solitary wins from many teams, usually a mixture of brilliant racing and a great share of luck, more recently Toro Rosso (2008), Alpha Tauri (2020), Racing Point (2020) and Alpine (2021). And there are also some ""one-season wonder"" teams with amazing (but short) performances like Brawn (2009) and Renault (2005/6). It\'s also interesting to see that, alongside the periods of the stronger teams (Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes in the last decade), we have legendary teams popping up, having some good seasons, and disappearing again: Alfa Romeo (the first champions), Vanwall, Lotus, Tyrrell, Brabham and even Maserati.\n\nThere are some seasons where the WCC is not the team with most wins (e.g. just a couple of years ago, in 2021), usually because the second driver falls short of the competition. Amazingly, in 1982, the WCC was Ferrari with 3 wins, despite both McLaren and Renault having 4 wins each! Reliability is important!\n\n### Driver Race Wins\n\nWe can also look at which drivers won races. Added all drivers over 20 wins and 2 others: Sir Stirling Moss, the driver with the most wins without a WDC and Sir Jack Brabham, the legendary driver/team owner that won a WDC and WCC driving his own car (1966). The years in the legend are for the first and last wins.\n\nThe sheer number of Schumacher and Hamilton wins is just breath-taking. Every year from 1992 to 2021, one of them won at least one race, together winning around 36% of all races in those years. The fact that Schumacher\'s last win was in 2006 and Hamilton\'s first was in 2007 makes it look like a passing of the flame. Schumacher\'s 2004 is probably the most impressive start of any driver with 12 wins out of the first 13 races.\n\nThere are many other impressive drivers: Vettel, with his third most wins and the current record for consecutive wins (9! in 2013); Clark, the driver with most wins for 4 years, despite only 2 WDCs; Lauda, with wins across more than a decade. The rivalry between Prost and Senna is also notorious, with both drivers trading wins most years, and fighting for WDCs.\n\nAs with teams, it is not always the case that the driver with most wins is the WDC winner. The most recent example is 2016, where Rosberg won the WDC with a win less, due to better consistency (aka more 2nd places). Reliability was incredibly important also: in 1958, Moss had 4 wins (and a 2nd place) to Hawthorn\'s 1 win (and 5 2nd places), but every other race was a DNF. There are also cases where the WDC was decided by the best N results and not total number of points, e.g., in 1964, both Surtees and G. Hill had 2 wins, Surtees won the WDC with 40 points, despite Hill having scored a total of 41 points, since only 39 counted for the WDC.\n\n### The Complete Mess - Driver & Team Wins\n\nNow for a completely incomprehensible graphic, we can join both the teams and the drivers. I tried to pick colours and shapes that allowed to distinguish both the teams and drivers, but it\'s still quite confusing.\n\nThere isn\'t much new here. We can see Brabham\'s glory year (1966), where he won WDC and WCC as driver and team owner. We can also see Fangio\'s WDCs with 4 teams: Alfa Romeo (1951), Mercedes (1954/55), Ferrari (1956) and Maserati (1957). The different teams Prost won in while Senna mostly won at McLaren. The winning combos of Ferrari+Schumacher and Mercedes+Hamilton.\n\n1: The difference between ""team"" and ""constructor"" is a bit fuzzy, so I\'ll use them interchangeably, despite not being the same thing, for simpleness.\n\n### Extra Plots\n\nI also did a bunch of other, not as interesting, plots that you can find [here](https://imgur.com/a/X1iwA93). It includes similar plots for team with the most points, pole positions, fastest lap. It also includes more general plots like number of unique winning teams in a year (2012 with the record of 7 different teams!) and how consistent are the top teams.\n\nPlease feel free to ask for any plots you would like to see!', 'I\'m very grateful for putting the 2 ""Lotus"" wins as other. Too many of these things include them with Team Lotus.', 'I think you dont understand tetris!', 'Damn. The Lewis/Merc era was something else‚Ä¶', ""I know, online, many folks say that the teams constructors doesn't matter much, especially for team like Red Bull, but man losing last year's constructors to McLaren must really sting them."", 'Others! Others! Others!']",549,31,0.98,549,115,115,34,2,0.0,34
