Given their times are not great, I suspect they're frantically trying different setups to find something that works.  A lot of people are pointing out that Liam doesn't appear to be doing well but I don't think we can judge that until Quali since RB likely are having him test some weird setups.  \n   - **Mercedes:** Despite a lot of hype, they don't seem to be up with the top teams.  Although it is still FP so they might be testing out random setups like RB.  \n   - **Aston Martin:** They seem to be doing ok considering they were expected to be doing much worse.  Newey only just started so his influence likely won't be felt until late 2025, early 2026.  \n   - **Williams:** They appear to be doing very well with Sainz appearing to be extremely comfortable in the car.  Albon is going to be really tested this year as his earlier years there looked much stronger because he had bad teammates.  \n   - **Racing Bulls:** they appear to have their shit together and are looking very solid.  If Yuki performs well and Liam does poorly this might open the door for Hadjar to join Red Bull.  \n   - **Alpine:** Alpine appears to be ok but seem to have fallen behind vcarb and Williams (although it might just be testing).  However, much like HAAS during the reign of Russian Influence, I can't support Alpine under the reign of Flavio Briatore.  I know Doohan will be booted from the team in ~5 races so I just wanted to wish him safe travels and hope he enjoyed his time in F1.  \n   - **Sauber:** Is not a complete tractor..... that doesn't sound right.  I wonder if everyone else is just sandbagging because that doesn't make sense.  \n   - **Haas:** I don't know what curse Haas is on but things couldn't get much worse.  Both drivers at the bottom of the chart in both sessions and 1 of their cars already hitting the wall and sustaining decent damage.  Did Williams find the cursed item hidden under their floors and throw it over the the Haas garage?"", 'Another year with Red Bull just not getting the real life results they expect based on their simulator and wind tunnel results while they have only one car to seriously finetune settings and see what works and what not.

This was an event where he pressured Renault\'s second driver to crash his car at a specific point in the race in order to force a red flag and give them enough time under the safety car to pit the other driver.

1jaie35,What is each current drivers best F1 season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jaie35/what_is_each_current_drivers_best_f1_season/,2025-03-13, Discussion,"So this popped into my head and I got thinking and wrote a list. But I'd love to hear what you all think. 
Here's my list. 

Max Verstappen - 2023 
What more is there to say. Yes you could make arguments for all his championship winning seasons for different reasons and usually I would pick winning a fight over domination but his donination was more than has ever been seen from a driver and statistically the greatest season in F1 history. 

Liam Lawson - 2023
Only tow choices and neither are full seasons, 2023 was so impressive when he came in, particularly Singapore. 2024 USA was just as good, but he wasn't beating Yuki as often in 24 so 23 it is. 

Lando Norris - 2021
Ok so Lando is an odd one in that all his seasons I'd rank pretty similar and he's never had a bad year. I chose 21 because of how impressive he was in the first half of the year (at summer break I think he was 3rd in standings) He also could have won a few races post summer break had things home differently. 

Oscar Piastri - 2024 
His run from Austria to Baku was truly incredible and his end of the season was nowhere near as bad as lots of people on here seem to think. He also had bad luck in a few races but still ranked fourth. 

Charles Leclerc - 2024 
This was actually a pretty clear winner. He did not make any of the mistakes that had blighted his previously great seasons and without the bad Ferrari summer run he could have won the championship. Winning in Monaco and Monza is amazing. 

Lewis Hamilton - 2020
His stretch from 18-20 is great but he never seemed quite as unstoppable as he did in 2020. He also beat Bottas better than in 2018 when Bottas had so much bad luck, and 2019 where both of them were on it. 

George Russell - 2024
So 2021 and 2022 are both strong contenders but his drives in Spa and Las Vegas as well as his qualifying demolition of the man with the most poles in F1 puts this first.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli - N/A

Fernando Alonso - 2012 
Fighting for the championship all the way to the end in what was usually the fourth best car is incredible and he deserved that title so much. 

Lance Stroll - 2020 
So Stroll was good in 17 but 2020 was different. He was fourth in the championship at mid season before he had a poor run until his finest hour when her got pole in Istanbul. He also got two podiums. 

Pierre Gasly - 2021 
How did he constantly qualify in the top six week in week out? He battered Yuki and git a podium in Baku as well as really strong P4s in Netherlands and Mexico 

Jack Doohan - 2024 (doesn't really count though) 

Esteban Ocon - 2017 
So Ocon actually had a few contenders, with 22 and 23 (which he got a fair bit of bad luck in) being strong. However 2017 takes it as he was really good in his first full season in F1 and looked like a driver who could challenge for a title in the future. He also could have got a podium in Canada of not for Perez.

Ollie Bearman - 2024 
Only did three races, and two of them were very good, Baku and Saudi. Though I don't rate Saudi quite as highly as most do. 

Yuki Tsunoda - 2024 
After an inconsistent 21 and a poor 22 he improved a lot in 23 before really coming on strong in 2024, topping the midfield numerous times at the start of the year and getting consistent points to the end.

Isack Hadjar - N/A 

Alex Albon - 2023 
Getting great points out of that car and destroying his team mate. His P7's were great as well as qualifying fourth in Zandvoort 

Carlos Sainz. Jr - 2019 
IMO he was easily a top three driver  that year with his constant best to the rest finishes earning him a thoroughly deserved sixth place in the standings spot following his podium in Brazil which is the second best midfield performance I have seen these last five years 

Nico Hulkenburg - 2014
So Hulkenberg is really difficult because loads of his seasons are solid but not spectacular. 2013 was great and I was really tempted to put 2018 here because he was best of the rest that year. But his mistakes in Baku and Spa held me back  and ultimately I think 2014 is his best. 
He finished in the top six in all but one of the first seven races in a force India and at one point he wa third in the championship standings. Only Hulkenburg could be third in the standings without a podium..

Gabriel Bortoleto - N/A
","[""In my opinion, Hamilton's best seasons are 2018, 2014 and 2015 in no particular order.\n\nI also think Leclerc's 2022 year is becoming a little bit underrated in hindsight. He had more pace than in 2024 IMO."", ""Good list, IMO Hamilton best season was 2018 (clearly the best driver that season despite not having the clear best car, unlike 2020), Ocon's best was 2021 (won a race, had worse luck than Alonso but was close to him in points despite that), Nico's was probably 2013 (51-6).\n\nAlso, for some drivers multiple seasons can apply (Max, Lando, Carlos, could even argue about Gasly with 2020) but the seasons in the list are probably the best ones IMO (or at least tied for that)."", 'I think 2008 and 2018 is better for Lewis Hamilton', 'Aside from 2006 and 2012, I wanna add 2014 for Alonso. Dragging the sixth(?) best car of the grid within a couple laps of a race win in Hungary and nearly getting fifth in the championship is absurd.', ""Hamilton has had so many great seasons. It is hard to pick just one. I think 2018 will be the one for me. \n\nFor Max, I actually pick 2021 over 2023. He didn't have a completely dominant car and had to fight all season to beat Hamilton and Mercedes. All while dealing with the pressure of getting that first championship."", 'What is with the love for Lewis‚Äô 2008? It‚Äôs one of his weakest seasons. For everyone saying ‚Äòit was only his second season‚Äô it would obviously be a great year by ordinary second season standards, but that glosses over his rookie year literally being better.\n\nAs great as he was at times - and he did hit some staggeringly high heights at races like Monaco, Silverstone and Hockenheim - we have to consider he got himself a grid penalty in Malaysia, the Alonso incident in Bahrain was really his fault for misjudging the closing speed, he had a lucky escape en route to winning Monaco, suffered complete brain fade in Canada and completely messed up the start in Japan. Aside from 2011, this is as patchy as a Lewis season gets. He ended up winning the title because it was arguably the weakest season of the last 20 years from a driving calibre perspective.', 'Call me crazy but I thought Fernando was pretty good when he beat Schumacher to two world titles..', 'Max - 2021, Lewis - 2018, Fernando - 2012', ""I'd say 2008/2018 and 2021 were better for Hamilton and Verstappen respectively. I'm not an F1 driver, may I shock you, but I assume it's much less pressure when you're far ahead of your mid-at-best teammate in a dominant car than when you're actually going wheel-to-wheel for the title against somebody. Dominant seasons are also impressive, but for me not as much as close battles.""]",37,143,0.69,37,748,748,0,0,0.0,0

It feels like we have a good chance to see a new world champion which is great. For me it‚Äôs between Lando and Charles, but Piastri could be the dark horse. He‚Äôs ruthless enough. Obviously writing off Verstappen and Red Bull is daft.\n\nI‚Äôm also really looking forward to seeing how Carlos gets on at Williams. They look like they have a decent car and it would be great to see him do well.\n\nFinally, I‚Äôm interested in how Verstappen takes on the challenge of not having a dominant car, now that he doesn‚Äôt have a significant lead. He can‚Äôt afford to take the risks he was towards the end of last season and I think there‚Äôs an exciting storyline there', 'Why is the length of Oscar‚Äôs contract a secret?', ""Melburnian who follows our weather pretty closely here, I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre all getting to enjoy the wonders of the infamous Melbourne ‚Äò4 seasons in 1 day‚Äô. You guys might be looking forward to rain for the chaos, I‚Äôm looking forward to the rain because it‚Äôs pretty much our first proper rain in multiple months. We've been slowly approaching [drought-like conditions over the last 12 months](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/maps/rainfall/?variable=rainfall&map=decile&period=12month&region=nat&year=2025&month=02&day=28) in this part of the country so any rain is good rain.\n\nThe weather in Melbourne is largely dictated by the direction of the wind, hot when the wind is coming from the deserts in the middle of the country to our north and cold when the wind is coming from the Southern Ocean and Antarctica to our south. Saturday is currently forecast to be 34¬∞C as we get the hot northerly desert winds ahead of the approaching Antarctic cold front. The cold front is then forecast to hit by Sunday morning, swinging the winds around to the S/SW and dragging up a much cooler air mass from down near Antarctica with the temperature forecast to be 20¬∞C and dropping for the start of the race.\xa0The winds are also likely to be reasonably gusty for the race with a fairly steep pressure gradient as the ridge of high pressure behind the front moves over the Great Australian Bight and pushes through into Melbourne.\n\nThere‚Äôll be rain and possible storms as the front passes through but we also quite often get fairly heavy intermittent showers for a few hours after the front passes as the cold Antarctic air interacts with the warmer waters of Port Phillip Bay, so I would say at this point it's likely that we're going to have at least a partially wet race. The showers behind the front can be pretty intense with occasional small hail but it was also a similar cold front setup around this time last year that brought severe storms and caused power outages that affected 500,000 homes and businesses so anything is possible.\n\nSome interesting links to keep track of our weather:  \nOffical forecast for Melbourne - [http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml)  \nOffical rain radar for the Melbourne region - [http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR024.loop.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR024.loop.shtml) (Albert Park is directly between the dots for Melbourne and St Kilda)  \nLatest official observations for the Melbourne region - [http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/melbourne.shtml](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/melbourne.shtml) (Melbourne (Olympic Park) is the closest station to Albert Park for most observations but St Kilda Harbour RMYS is marginally closer for wind observations)\n\nIt's definitely a weekend filled with the notorious 'Melbourne' weather that we're known for at least!"", 'so with a possibility of rain on sunday, how do teams go on about setup for quali?', 'On F1tv, how do I get cockpit audio from e.g. Verstappen?

1jaag7x,How Will the 2025 Drivers Perform (F1 Mathematical Model),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jaag7x/how_will_the_2025_drivers_perform_f1_mathematical/,2025-03-13, Discussion,"Since 2025 has such a big rookie class, I thought it could be interesting to speculate (based on my mathematical model) on how well they will perform, using all the references we have and comparing to similar candidates in the recent past.

# Let's Speculate

The model only predicts the potential ceiling or pace of the drivers (in parenthesis). Based on previous performances relative to their ceilings, I am estimating the drivers' performances in 2025 to look something like this (barring any major outliers):

Verstappen 92 (93)

Leclerc 90 (92)

Norris 87 (89)

Russell 84 (85)

Hamilton 82 (84)

Sainz 81 (83)

Albon 80 (83)

Piastri 79 (84)

Alonso 79 (81)

Ocon 77 (81)

Gasly 76 (80)

Tsunoda 74 (78)

Hulkenberg 63 (68)

Stroll 62 (74)

Now, let's look at the incoming drivers and see where they might fit in, going from most known to least. To make this perfectly clear: This is going to be highly speculative, especially the further down you go.

**Liam Lawson**

Lawson will be going into his first full season with 2 quarter seasons under his belt. That makes it a bit blurry to predict how exactly he will develop, but it also provides a clear baseline not present for most rookies. Based on his performances against Yuki Tsunoda, and assuming his current experience accumulates to that of one full rookie season, his ceiling for 2025 would be \~71. While he hasn't shown any signs of being mistake prone, making the step to a top car can be a bit much sometimes (especially next to someone like Verstappen), resulting in a relative step back. Based on similar examples a rating in the low to mid 60s would then make sense, so I'll go with 63.

**Franco Colapinto**

While he isn't technically on the grid right away, it seems like everyone's already expecting him to swoop in for Doohan at some point; and sooner rater than later. Colapinto looked really promising next to Albon and could have a ceiling of around 78 for 2025. He also seemed to be prone to overdriving, making it likely that he wouldn't score particularly close to his ceiing. Mid to high 60s might be reasonable. With a bit of improvement concerning his consistency I could see him at 68.

**Oliver Bearman**

Bearman's junior career isn't very telling but his 3 race weekends in 2024 are a bit of an easy out. While it's definetly not enough to predict anything concrete, he looks to be situated somewhere between Gasly and Russell in terms of his ceiling. Carlos Sainz might be an appropriate comparison. Sainz' rookie season is rated 62 by the model. Considering that Bearman will be a year younger than Sainz at the time but has a minimal leg up experience wise, I'm landing just below 60, so that'll be 59 with a low 60s ceiling for 2025.

**Jack Doohan**

He might not take part in enough races for a rating. Hopefully, his Abu Dhabi result wasn't entirely representative but if it was, he has no chance of holding on to that seat. His F2 and F3 record deosn't properly aleviate this fear either but at least it suggests that he migtht just not be quite that bad. Far below 50 is still the most likely outcome in my opinion. He'll likely settle somewhere ahead of Hartley (25) but worse than Zhou (42).

**Kimi Antonelli**

Kimi is heralded as the next Max Verstappen and his F2 season against the slightly older and more experienced Ollie Bearman does at least not refute that notion. Even though his record isn't quite as intimidating as Verstappen's, if he is that good, Max Verstappen's and Charles Leclerc's rookie seasons would be the best leads we have to speculate on how good Antonelli will be. Verstappen's 2015 was 73 (78), and Leclerc's 2018 was 76 (81). Antonelli is a year older than Verstappen was and 2 years younger than Leclerc. If Antonelli is that guy, he'll likely score in the mid 70s. I'm going with 74 (80). If this is true, he'll be pretty much matching and then overtaking George on pace from 2026 on.

**Gabriel Bortoleto**

Although there are no direct reference points for Bortoleto, his path and age are somewhat reminiscent (if slightly less impressive) of George Russell. Russell's rookie season is rated at 66. Their situations are probably going to be relatively similar as well, driving the worst car in Formula 1, so a similar performance relative to their ceilings is not too unlikely. Low to mid 60s might be where Bortoleto will be rated in 2025.

**Isack Hadjar**

Hadjar seems like a pretty typical lower midlevel F1 rookie, somewhere in the realm between Zhou and Logan Sargeant which would leave him around 50. Hadjar is a bit younger, meaning you would expect him below 50. It is also possible, since parallels have been drawn, that he will end up following his new teammate who had a very poor first year in F1 (46) due to overdriving and inconsistency. I'll go with \~47.

Verstappen 92 (93)

Leclerc 90 (92)

Norris 87 (89)

Russell 84 (85)

Hamilton 82 (84)

**Bearman 59 (63)**

**Hadjar 47 (51)**

**Doohan 30 (40)**

Historically, around 65 would be the middle of the pack, but the current grid is absolutely stacked, meaning that some drivers who would actually be considered pretty good might at the same time be below average. For Example, according to the model, Verstappen debuted as the 6th best driver in 2015. He would have been 12th with the same score in 2024. Of course, it's also very possible, even likely, that at least one driver will underperform uncharacteristically for whatever reason, just like Hamilton did in 2024.","['What is your methodology and maths to come up with these numbers?', ""Obviously speculative, but I assume this can be used for teammate battles and if it can there are some interesting results.\n\nI think people would probably put Ocon and Bearman a bit closer based on Ollie's brief outings last year, even if most agree that Ocon should beat Ollie overall.\n\nOther interesting estimates put Hulk and Borto very close, which is quite bullish on Bortoleto I'd say (even if I agree and I think Bortoleto has quite a lot of potential).\n\nLastly, Albon and Sainz are rated similarly, idk if this is kind on Alex or harsh on Carlos, but I think the general consensus is that Carlos should beat Albon with a bit of a gap at least."", 'Nice work.

We don't give this leeway to other drivers (outside of rookies) and don't hear other drivers moaning about it.

Sainz is striaight up to speed at Williams, Ocon and Hulkenberg are expected to be straight on it with their new teams.

But all we hear about and from Hamilton is how hard the transition is and how it is going to take him time to get upto speed.

What is going on here? We didn't hear this when Hamitlon went to Mercedes in 2013, he was on the pace right away beating Rosberg.
