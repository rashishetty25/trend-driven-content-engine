1msj9qv,Russell: Fresh start in F1 2025 was good for both Mercedes and Hamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1msj9qv/russell_fresh_start_in_f1_2025_was_good_for_both/,2025-08-17, News,,"['TLDR he says the change was good for Lewis, doesnâ€™t elaborate why, reflects on Mercedesâ€™ challenges, insists Kimi will be better after the break and that heâ€™s close to George in terms of performance.', 'His assesment of Kimiâ€™s performance is very accurate.
