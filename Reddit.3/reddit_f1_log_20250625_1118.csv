1lje4ws,Ferrari: The first update to react to problems,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lje4ws/ferrari_the_first_update_to_react_to_problems/,2025-06-24, News,,"['Remove slow add fast', ""Translation \n\nFerrari is in a climate of media attention both on a technical and sporting level. The environment in Maranello is underpressure on the upper floors, with the post Canada that has put in the eye of the media attention Fred Vasseur of which it is not yet his near future within the walls of Via Abetone Inferiore. The Austrian Grand Prix next Sunday marks the return to Europe that leads to the summer break in a series of crucial events to be able to give a second part of the season growing after a dramatic first half, sportingly and technically.\n\n\nFirst block of updates in Styria: at the Red Bull Ring the new floor designed after the inconsistencies revealed in Australia. That‚Äôs why calling it ‚Äúminor upgrade‚Äù is an error, a fundamental macrocomponent with all the limits of the mechanics from which it is difficult to extract further load at the end of the regulatory cycle.\n\nSince the pre-season tests, the SF-25 has shown its limits, that is, those of a single-seater unable to operate in an operating window in which it can take advantage of the aerodynamic load. An unexpected, serious handicap, of which has now been talked about and re-discussed since the first race in Australia. Precisely the difficulties that emerged in Melbourne forced the engineers led by Diego Tondi and Loic Serra to review the initial development plans from virtually zero. The upcoming update at the Red Bull Ring is thus the first, true, attempt to complete the deep correction of the SF-25 project after months of work within the walls of Maranello, between technical meetings and choices on the budget to be allocated.\n\nIn Austria, however, a floor will debut, however, not definable as a simple ‚Äúrefinement‚Äù. Sudden miracles are difficult to expect them but in Austria, a short track, where a very compact group is expected, even a minimum gain will be fundamental especially on Saturdays. The new floor was deliberated some time ago after its natural tunnel development. Bringing the ‚Äúhealing parts‚Äù to the track was in fact possible before June: in Canada, for logistical and tuning issues, it was not concretely possible to bring new parts, so much so that, the new component was initially designed for Silverstone, a track that will be a bit ‚Äòfor all the grid of important news. His early arrival of a race represents ‚Äúan effort‚Äù of the technical department to speed up the recovery process.\n\n\nThe reason why the upgrade comes so late is tied to the time it took to understand and correct the conceptual errors highlighted in the first races. Serra and Tondi had to work behind the scenes to set up a new technical direction, more ‚Äúconservative‚Äù but functional to the initial ambitions. The delay in bringing developments was also an obligatory choice: children of past mistakes, these cars require you to stop, understand, and intervene with criteria.\n\n\nHamilton gave his support to Vasseur but wanted to abandon 2025 to give everything to 2026. A drastic change of course is not in the Ferrari style with the head of the GeS who reiterates an unexpressed potential. The numbers wouldn't blame him. Realistically, who will be right?\n\nIn this complicated context, Lewis Hamilton also has had doubts about the solidity of the SF-25 project, so much so that he considered himself to distance himself from a project with which difficulties have emerged for adaptation, as well as for technical limits. The seven-time world champion, who arrived in Maranello with high expectations, was faced with an unpredictable and difficult to interpret car. However, it was precisely the belief ‚Äî Vasseur reiterated several times ‚Äî that the potential of the machine was real, even if unexpressed.\n\n\nThe main limits have been identified in the rear suspension, unable to offer consistency to downforce and stability, limiting Lewis‚Äô style above all. Only in rare conditions, the SF-25 managed to express itself at its best. Despite everything, Ferrari, by his own philosophy, rejects the idea of throwing the entire season at the nettles: after the Monaco GP, the realistic goal has become the second place in the constructors‚Äô championship and some victories to be won with determination, to close 2025 with dignity. Hamilton gave his support to Fred but it is clear that the Englishman aims at 2026 to return to express himself at the levels he expected with a car that also follows his needs.\nIn Fiorano the SF-25 adapted to the 2026 tyres was with the front wing that will be at Monza in September.\n\nIt is not emblematic that the SF-25 has not been in the wind tunnel since mid-June: its space has been officially sold to the 678 project, the 2026 car that will have to be born under the new technical regulations. This signal highlights that in Ferrari, as mentioned, there has been no change of programming on the timing compared to that established in January, with the knowledge that the current season will still be long, even if compromised in substance. 2025, except for sensational surprises, will be remembered as a year of transition (yet another) and, perhaps, of reconstruction.\n\nMeanwhile, Ferrari also returned to the track in Fiorano for a Pirelli test session dedicated to the wet tyres of 2026. The SF-25 has turned in mule car configuration, but with the interesting unloading configuration to simulate the lower load of the next cars: Zhou and Leclerc have turned the front wing version, characterized by extremely exhausted profiles, designed for the low load that, from the confirmed collections, will be present Monza. The exhaust profiles were combined with the updated structure and the updated drifts after Spain."", ""This translation doesn't sound great but I hope this upgrade package works. Seems like this is the make it or break it point for the year. I don't think we're winning a championship at this point but it would be nice to see Lewis and Charles fighting for wins occasionally. All teams should be focusing on next year's car soon so this seems like the last shot at getting back in the mix."", ""So new floor in Austria... what about suspension? Wasn't that rumoured for Silverstone or is that no longer the case."", 'Ahhh Yes perfect time to also test out a rookie driver. \n\nRookie will be in Charles‚Äô car - money is on they bolt the floor to his and a minor accident either ruins or offers them no real feedback until fp2 which will probably red flag earlier on and Charles will get no long runs in. \n\nThis is the Ferrari way - I‚Äôm tired.', 'Next race‚Ñ¢', 'I fear Ferrari is going to be reason Lewis‚Äô Silverstone podium streak ends, unfortunately.', 'This weekend: \nCharles-my suspension feels bad\nFerrari engineer-must be the suspension', 'The updates before were developed in order to create problems']",276,33,0.95,276,540,540,5,0,0.0,5

There, the Englishman quickly regained his smile. On race day, things were different. On lap 66, the McLaren driver launched an attack on his teammate Oscar Piastri. The two drivers battled through several corners before Norris decided to overtake Piastri on the inside straight. There was no room, however, and Norris crashed into the rear of his teammate, slammed into the concrete wall, and was out.\n\n> With his head bowed, the 25-year-old trudged back to the pits. Norris took full responsibility for the crash and immediately apologized to his team and to Piastri. Piastri was fortunate in his misfortune and was able to finish the race unscathed in fourth place. Thanks to the twelve points for fourth place and Norris\'s zero, the gap in the World Championship standings has grown to 22 points. A bitter setback for Norris\'s ambitions.\n\n> Last year\'s runner-up in the world championship had entered the 2025 Formula 1 season as one of the top favorites for the title. His opening victory in Melbourne in mid-March seemed to confirm the experts\' assumptions. However, the Briton subsequently lost his rhythm. Piastri raced from success to success. The reasons for this lay partly in Norris\'s inconsistency and partly in his complaints about the handling of his McLaren. Since the start of the season, the Briton has justified himself by saying that he needed to adapt to the new car. The MCL39, he said, did not suit his natural driving style. The car was difficult to drive and did not give him the desired feedback. Such statements were not heard from Piastri.\n\n> **New front axle = new hope.**\nThe engineers at the storied Woking team listened to their driver. In Canada, they introduced a new front axle for the tenth race of the year. Team principal Andrea Stella explained: ""The new front suspension is designed to give our drivers more feel. We\'ve made minor changes to the geometry ‚Äì nothing dramatic."" Only Norris used the new design. Piastri opted for the older version. ""The changes are so minimal, it\'s difficult for the drivers to determine their effect. That\'s only possible once we\'ve done a back-to-back comparison,"" Stella explained the next steps.\n\n> This is now scheduled for Spielberg (June 29). Norris, in particular, is hoping for a positive effect. However, he will have to hand over his MCL39 to junior driver Alex Dunne in the first practice session. Oscar Piastri will likely also evaluate the new front axle there and then decide whether to use it as well. ""There were no negative surprises with Lando; he felt comfortable with it,"" Stella said happily.\n\n> **Norris pace convincing.**\nHis prot√©g√© showed the first positive signs in the Montreal practice sessions. Norris was fast from the start and handled the race better than his teammate ‚Äì right up until qualifying. In the third segment, the man from Bristol made two mistakes that dropped him to seventh place. But his pace was right: ""Compared to Oscar, Lando was competitive from the start. For us, that means the experiment with the front suspension was a success for him.""\n\n> Piastri remained flawless and secured third place on the grid in qualifying. In the race, Norris was again the faster driver. With good pace, he was able to close the gap to Piastri towards the end of the race. Despite the crash, this should give him a boost for the upcoming races. But what\'s next for McLaren? ""Both could continue to use different suspensions. It\'s up to the drivers to decide which specification they feel more comfortable with,"" said Stella in Canada.\n\n> This may be a small advantage for Norris in the World Championship battle. The new front axle could boost his confidence, which has been dented after the crash and the season\'s mixed fortunes. Furthermore, the knowledge of a supposed technical advantage over Piastri would give him a mental boost. The trick is just translating that into results on the track. That\'s been a problem recently, not just in Canada. The next chance to turn things around in the World Championship battle awaits in Spielberg.', ""World cup you say ?\n\n*It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, F1's coming home*\n\n\\- Lando, probably"", ""It seemed like the first time this year that Norris had a race pace advantage over Piastri, but it also showed that the car isn't the problem but the driver as he was not able to use that to it's full potential in quali nor in the race and left with nothing."", 'so why is a general mclaren update norris‚Äòs great hope but not piastris who is even in the lead. could it be biased?', 'Ive also heard people say their non dominant weekend at canada was because of the flexi wings td so quite contradictory media articles', ""I mean, Lando's only 26? Even if he doesn't win championship this year, it's still not end of the world for him."", 'But but but he crashed with that new axle. The car with the old axle made the corner just fine. :-D']",0,58,0.46,0,313,313,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
1lj96hn,Who was the greatest all around driver in terms of driving styles?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lj96hn/who_was_the_greatest_all_around_driver_in_terms/,2025-06-24, Discussion,"Hey everyone! Recently I‚Äôve been doing a fair bit of research on driver‚Äôs styles. I‚Äôm trying to see who was fastest no matter what really. For example:

Ayrton Senna - extremely fast in his era. Unique style was akin to how traction control works, and enabled him to stay on the edge. Great longevity going from twitchy turbo cars to NA V12s, but difficult to predict how this would have fared in the TC V10s era. Was showing adaptability at Williams in 94, however. 

Schumacher - preferred understeer contrary to popular belief, however after his time at Benetton he adapted to a pointy oversteer setup which kept him at the limit more consistently than other drivers. But in the V8 era he struggled: he couldn‚Äôt use his ‚Äòrallycrosser‚Äô style to its full potential, and it‚Äôs also important to factor in age, he wasn‚Äôt as sharp. 

Fangio - the master of the four wheel drift. Only drove as quick as was necessary, demonstrating so at the 1957 German GP. Perfect style for his time.

Jean Alesi - one of my personal favourites, however less of an efficient style, more entertaining. Often took the car far over the limit. Right places, wrong times in the peak of his career. 

These are just some off of the top of my head, I know I‚Äôm missing out many massive names. In your opinion, how was the penultimate example for how to go fast, or the best all round driver?
