1lgr28q,Is Verstappen still an issue?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lgr28q/is_verstappen_still_an_issue/,2025-06-21, News,,"['Writers and fans online seem to be more concerned about George Russell‚Äôs future than he is.', '# Is Verstappen still an issue?\n\n*Mercedes and George Russell take their time. Many believe that the new contract could already be announced at Silverstone. Or is Max Verstappen still an issue after all?*\n\nNot much will happen on the transfer market for 2026. Most of the drivers have a valid contract for the coming season. Max Verstappen too. And yet the world champion stimulates the imagination of observers: Verstappen can leave Red Bull in a certain constellation. And at Mercedes, there is a vacancy on paper.\n\nGeorge Russell\'s contract expires at the end of the year. So far, there have only been non-binding oaths of loyalty from both sides. Team boss Toto Wolff says that Russell has been part of the family for a long time, and that even without the recent successes, his qualities as a driver are known. Russell insists that he is only talking to Mercedes. He explained to all other interested parties that his stay in the Silver Arrows team was a priority.\n\nAnd yet Wolff and Russell are asked questions about the current water level every weekend. And because there is no definitive ""yes"" word yet, every reaction, every word, every action of those involved is weighed on the gold scales and interpreted. It is noticeable that Wolff avoids any criticism of Verstappen and builds a bridge to the Dutchman even in controversial scenes such as in Barcelona. Analogously, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner praises Russell for his performances conspicuously often. You just don\'t mess up with drivers you might need for some reason.\n\n**Russell: ""Why change anything?""**\n\nHowever, there is much more to suggest that Mercedes and Russell will continue their marriage and that they will take their time until the British GP in Silverstone to report completion. In Montreal, Wolff explained: ""There is no update on George. He\'s a member of our family, and he\'s performing. We never doubted him. He has the speed, the winning mentality, the work ethic. We don\'t need wins or pole positions to confirm his qualities. Everything is developing as it should."" Which could be interpreted as a continuation of the cooperation.\n\nRussell also downplays the urgency of negotiations: ""We are in no hurry to negotiate. We want to win together. Kimi \\[Antonelli\\] and I are both Mercedes junior drivers. We both do our job. Why change something that works?"" Then he adds: ""The victory in Montreal certainly didn\'t hurt. But as I\'ve said many times, I\'m not worried about next year. I know that I will have a place in the field.""', '> A voice from the Red Bull camp: ""If Wolff takes Verstappen, he\'s swapping two drivers. That would also destroy Antonelli.""  \n  \nThe most interesting part of the article, in my opinion. While fans have speculated about this, I‚Äôve never seen an insider even hint about it before.', ""If anyone read the article it looks like Russell staying is a done deal. Please stop with the Mercedes Max combo now guys.. it's getting very tedious."", ""In the championship? Always. For George's seat? No chance. George is performing at an amazing level."", 'It‚Äôs very simple. If Max is available you send George somewhere else.\n\nIf there is even a chance they can get Max not having some kind of option or clause with which they can replace George would be malpractice', ""The hard truth is that loyalty and contracts near appear optional when a team decides to rearrange its driver lineup.\n\nVerstappen is the hottest commodity on the grid and every team would like to have him in their team if they could afford and get him.\n\nI doubt there is a single team principle that wouldn't can one of their existing drivers if verstappen becomes an option. Maybe with the exception of maclaren, but Brown would enjoy rubbing that in Horner's face.\n\nThere are probably four teams that could entice verstappen; red bull, mb, Ferrari and maclaren. Each with its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThen there is next years regulations and the race to see which team comes out on top. Verstappen has a contract for next year and is guaranteed a contract somewhere on the grid in two plus years. Logically his best option would be to see out his contract, see which team nails the new regulations and then make a decision.\n\nTeam principles like Wolf likely position themselves to capitalize on this. Russell becomes a pawn in this game.\n\nThe real question is why MB doesn't favor Russell over Antonelli, which really ought to cause Russell to reflect on his future."", '**The best Russell ever**\n\nThe Montreal winner now has the confidence not to be afraid of Verstappen. He can even understand that his personal nemesis is at the top of the list everywhere. ""Is there any team that wouldn\'t be interested in Max? If all drivers were free of contract, Max would be the preferred candidate for every team. But there are always two cockpits per team. I know that my position will not be called into question if I continue to deliver such performances. That\'s why I\'m in a good starting position.""\n\nThe longer the season progresses, the more difficult it would be for Mercedes team management to explain why they don\'t want to continue with Russell. The 27-year-old Englishman is driving the season of his life, getting more out of the car than is in it. In ten races, he has been on the podium five times and, like Verstappen, still has a title chance against the all-powerful McLaren. Verstappen and Russell are separated by only 19 points.\n\n**Loyalty from both sides?**\n\nThe victory and pole position in Canada were further proof that you can celebrate the title with the Russell if you give him the right car. The four-time GP winner advertises himself: ""I feel like I\'m riding better than ever. And I feel that I have even more in the tank. I\'m ready to fight for the title. Results like here in Canada or in Bahrain show that. If you only give me a half-chance of a good result, I\'ll deliver.""\n\nAt the same time, the fourth in the World Championship affirms: ""I don\'t talk to any other team. To those who have shown interest, I have said that it is my intention to stay with Mercedes. That was always clear. I\'m loyal to Mercedes. They gave me the opportunity to get into Formula 1.""\n\nRussell also demands loyalty from his team. It\'s not just about him. For Andrea Kimi Antonelli, an alpha animal like Verstappen would come at least a year too early. A voice from the Red Bull camp: ""When Wolff takes Verstappen, he swaps two drivers. He would also destroy Antonelli with that.""', 'Tbf is from Red Bull camp so maybe he/she exaggerated a bit that']",0,36,0.22,0,30,30,0,5,-0.03,0
