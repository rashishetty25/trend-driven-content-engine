Hey everyone,
I’m trying to find a Formula 1 video I saw on Instagram a while ago and can’t track down again.
It was a really slick edit, the cars were speeding by, and it kept freezing and switching between different teams (like McLaren -Alpine -Ferrari etc.) showing each car for just a moment in a freeze frame before changing to the next.
Then, after all the quick changes, one car breaks out of the freeze frame and drives away. I remember it being done by an ad agency (or maybe the F1 media team) and ending with something along the lines of: “We only had 90 seconds to show all the cars.”
(or something similar: that was the general idea).
​
I’ve tried searching but can’t find it anywhere. Does anyone recognize this video or know who made it?
Thanks in advance!",['https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQNH_EdkRj9/\n\nThis one ?'],4,2,0.61,4,1,1,0,0,0.0,0
