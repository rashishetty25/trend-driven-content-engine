Either he doesn\'t pit and ask for clarification so he can decide for himself (knowing that pitting even 1 lap later could cost him), or he pits first and asks questions later.\n\nHe did the latter, and you could hear him on the radio asking for the times of the drivers who didn\'t pit and realizing, in real time, that the call was wrong.\n\nThis is a ""shit happens"" situation, and imo more palatable because tons of drivers got screwed and many teams got it wrong. Add to that the VSC and the full safety car and you get a total mess.\n\nThat said, I do also think Carlos is currently evaluating the skills of the Williams strategy team, and we\'re not far from another ""stop inventing"", but it\'s still early days. \n\nAnyway.

1kr1qzm,Ferrari is conducting wind tunnel tests on a new suspension system. They are losing half a second per lap in qualifying. Here's how to recover it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kr1qzm/ferrari_is_conducting_wind_tunnel_tests_on_a_new/,2025-05-20, News,,"[""Not the same exact aspects as noted in this article, but McLaren's suspension has seemed superior to everyone else's in terms of how much curb they're able to take on slow corners."", 'The regular ""the Tuesday after"" hopium dose.', 'Potential', ""Translation\n\n  \nImola comeback doesn't cover up trouble: Ferrari can't fight for the World Championship but it can't give up either. Without developments, it risks finishing even behind Williams\n\n\n\nThe show of character at Imola helps ‚Äúbreathe,‚Äù brings morale (more to Hamilton than Leclerc) but cannot hide the serious troubles of a Ferrari, called this weekend to the Monte Carlo test, on the dreaded slow corners. Focusing on 2026, with rule changes and new superhybrid engines that few like, is crucial. But giving up the fight in the current championship could have devastating consequences on the standings and prestige. That is why developments are essential. Among the most important and long-awaited is the modified rear suspension. It has passed dynamic dyno testing and is being tested in the wind tunnel with different aerodynamics, it will change especially in the attachment area. The goal is to unlock ‚Äúpotential,‚Äù a topic that generates disagreements between team principal Fred Vasseur and the drivers.\n\n\n\nWorld Championship still long: you can't win but neither can you give up\n\n\n\nThere are 17 races and four sprints left in the World Championship. The gaps for those like Ferrari who travel far from the frontrunners (McLaren and Verstappen) have shrunk to the point where even teams that previously were not are now a threat. Williams, a team on the rebound, with Albon's fifth-place finish at Imola: 51 points collected, fifth among constructors behind the Cavallino, last year at the same stage of the championship was at zero.\n\n\n\nFerrari, on the other hand, took the reverse route: the average gap from the McLarens was 4-5 tenths, while at the end of 2024 it was around a tenth. The figure takes into account tire differences; this season Pirelli introduced softer compounds. Almost all the teams have met the performance increase forecast, not Ferrari.\n\nSome examples? If the 2024 Rossa had faced qualifying at Imola instead of the current one, it would have been half a second faster.  An enormity that cannot be explained only by errors in the preparation of the launch lap (Vasseur's thesis), by general difficulties in warming up the tires. \n\nThe compromise on heights\n\n\n\nIn Maranello, technical director Loic Serra is juggling two tasks: directing the 2026 group and correcting the SF-25's mechanical problems. It is not an easy job nor one that is quickly solved. Hamilton in recounting Sunday's comeback said the ‚Äúcar came to life.‚Äù What does that mean? That it starts going fast when the gasoline in the tank drops below 70 percent. The car's fundamental conundrum is a mechanical one: when the downforce (the force that crushes the car to the ground) shifts back, coming out of corners, the trim adjustments are not sufficient to cover its limits. Compression damages the bottom if the height is too extreme in qualifying, and so one must accept compromise solutions that lose 15-20 load points on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe 2024 wing for Monte Carlo\n\n\n\n The fix is forced, the revised suspension is expected by the British GP at Silverstone (July 6). But first the most decisive Saturday of the season must be faced, in Monte Carlo where something winning will be seen again: in fact, the rear wing of the SF-24 with which Leclerc took pole and then triumphed in the race twelve months ago will be used. It will also be Adrian Newey's first time in an Aston Martin uniform. They tell us in Maranello that someone regretted not taking him. Market research is wide open-the problem is convincing the brains to come."", 'Ferrari had great pace in last race but..... what I can see in race that the car still feels sluggish at tight corners, the rear end is way too slippery and it hasn\'t improved much since Aus. We can only hope that this new setup helps in reducing it.\n\nAnd the Article is right, they can\'t give ip the development on 2025 as Williams is improving every race. This not only risks their position in WCC but also can harm their reputation as a brand because of them losing to supposedly a ""midfield"" car. It would have not mattered in 90s but now things are different.

Red Bull is trying to dethrone its direct rival by any means necessary. Will their strategy work?**\n\n> Max Verstappen recently won four consecutive world championships. But it currently looks unlikely that the Dutchman\'s streak will end this year. The McLaren drivers have settled into the top two spots in the drivers\' standings. Even Verstappen\'s victory at Imola couldn\'t change the one-two lead held by Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris for the time being.\n\n> The Grand Prix in Emilia-Romagna also demonstrated that Red Bull is currently doing everything it can to prevent the impending change of power. With a major upgrade package, the engineers got the RB21 back on track. The setup window was enlarged. Verstappen praised the balance for the first time this year. This also helped keep the tires alive over the race distance.\n\n> Red Bull isn\'t just trying to increase the pressure on its rivals on the racetrack. Hardly anyone in the Formula 1 paddock is as adept at playing the political games off the track as team principal Christian Horner. The Briton is attempting to destabilize the Papaya competition at every level. The goal is to distract McLaren from the essentials and, if possible, artificially slow them down.\n\n> **Water affair hits nerve.**\nThe attacks began during the preseason. First, they tried to lobby the FIA \u200b\u200bagainst the flexible wings. This was immediately successful with the rear wing. After Oscar Piastri\'s victory in Baku, McLaren had to reinforce the flap on the tail unit so that ""mini-DRS"" could no longer occur on the straights. The Red Bull camp also put a lot of pressure on the referees regarding the front wing. However, the rules here will only be tightened in Barcelona.\n\n> Red Bull also tried to spread suspicion behind the scenes that McLaren was filling its tires with water to better control the heat in the rubber. This attempt, however, failed. Both Pirelli and the FIA \u200b\u200bdenied the allegations. There was no evidence of such a practice. But Red Bull at least managed to force McLaren to address the allegations.\n\n> The reaction of McLaren CEO Zak Brown demonstrated that Red Bull had struck a nerve. In Miami, he sat at the pit lane with a water bottle on which he had written the word ""tyre water."" Parallel to this mocking action, the racing team boss publicly complained that Red Bull always only makes allegations behind the scenes. He called on his opponent to lodge a protest. This would allow the accusations to be officially dismissed.\n\n> **Red Bull hopes for escalation.**\nSo far, McLaren hasn\'t been significantly unsettled by Red Bull\'s measures. At the end of last year, the storied team celebrated winning the Constructors\' Cup. And this year, as already mentioned, the Papaya Rockets came out of the starting blocks strong. But Red Bull is far from out of steam. The attacks off the track have continued in recent weeks.\n\n> After the Formula 1 race at Imola, Horner tried to evoke an impending clash between the two McLaren drivers: ""McLaren has two drivers fighting for the world championship. At some point, it always comes to a point where self-interest takes precedence over team interest. That\'s the conflict. They did well and didn\'t collide. It\'s commendable that they\'re fighting each other. But you could see how close it is.""\n\n> Red Bull, however, doesn\'t want to just wait until Norris and Piastri get at each other\'s throats. At the same time, engineers from both Red Bull and sister team Toro Rosso are bombarding the FIA \u200b\u200bwith inquiries about possible technical tricks on the MCL39. The focus remains on how McLaren manages to keep the rear tires within a moderate temperature window, which gives the drivers an advantage on the long runs.\n\n> **TD information released to the press?**\nThe FIA \u200b\u200bsent its answers to Red Bull\'s questions to all teams ahead of the Imola weekend. However, it is understood that the crucial clue was not included. The inquiries have so far gone unanswered. It is somewhat suspicious that the day after the Imola race, various journalists from Great Britain and the Netherlands reported simultaneously on two FIA ""technical directives"" that were sent to all teams before Imola.\n\n> Firstly, this was supposedly a clarification regarding the skid blocks on the underbody. Secondly, the aforementioned communication between the FIA \u200b\u200band Red Bull regarding tire cooling was leaked to selected media representatives. It is suspected that Red Bull itself is behind the story. The idea is apparently to create the impression that the rule changes had an impact on McLaren\'s performance.\n\n> Immediately after the Imola race, Horner had already teased that the team had been surprised by the weak pace of their opponents. However, the Englishman declined to speculate on the reasons. According to McLaren, the track layout, with its many fast corners, was primarily responsible for the fact that they weren\'t able to perform as dominantly as they did recently in Miami.\n\n> **Next dispute in Barcelona?**\nThe next round of the political battle is expected to take place in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhen the new front wing regulations come into force. Opinions on the issue have been divided even in advance. While Horner calls this a significant change, McLaren doesn\'t expect the balance of power to change.\n\n> Things will get especially exciting if the Papaya racers actually lose some of their pace advantage for a long time. Then the McLaren management will have to ask themselves further critical questions about whether the car was actually artificially slowed down. This could cause disruption to the previously smoothly running system. And that\'s exactly what Red Bull wants to achieve.', 'I believe McLaren will be the quickest car all year tbh', 'I think of Singapore vs Japan in 2023 about all the talks surrounding RBR. I would wait until after this triple header to have a conclusion on McLaren.', 'Not sure what Red Bull wants to achieve with pushing the TD as the reason why McLaren lost pace in Imola. \n\nThe degradation in Imola wasn‚Äôt thermal. The tyres never had a risk of overheating so McLaren‚Äôs ‚Äòtrick‚Äô was not useful. Max said the deg was not thermal. Norris suggested the temperatures of the tyres affected them. That points to non-thermal deg. \n\nAdded to that, Imola is a front limited track and the design flaw of the McLaren has always been that it is a much stronger car on rear limited tracks. \n\nThose things combined together with Red Bull‚Äôs superior tyre management *when the deg is not thermal* and their characteristics on high speed front limited tracks, made it look like McLaren had been affected by a TD. \n\nTo all the world it would be a simple explanation and one that Red Bull were keen to push. \n\nThe issue is what happens *if* McLaren are *not* affected in Barcelona. I‚Äôm sure this will be brought up again with Red Bull and I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll have an explanation. \n\nIf they are affected then Red Bull can point to this TD and the front wing. But they probably hope it‚Äôll affect them.', 'Yeah, they‚Äôre already starting to go down the Ferrari road of awful strategy decisions during races and slow stops', ""Verstappen has been absolutely exceptional since 2020. I can't think of another driver who literally makes all of 2, 3 mistakes tops per \\*season\\*. Just staggering consistency.  \n  \nPiastri should win this year (barring an exceptional Red Bull upgrade or the Flexi wing rules from Spain onwards seriously damaging McLarens car)"", ""my theory is that the McLaren has more to come from upgrades, they started the last 2 seasons behind, so likely started the design work of this year's car a little behind too, and spent a large amount of effort on the mechanical platform to give it the race day advantage it has and it's stable platform, probably focusing more on having that ready for the start of the year alongside some aero revisions, since aero can be upgraded in season easier than suspension. plus the front wing they started with this year is unchanged from last year, identical. I reckon the aero was improved but there may be more to come especially at Spain, a few months into the calendar so enough time for a big aero update and when the Flexi wing clampdown comes into force, so they can focus a package to improve the cars down force and cater it to a less flexible front wing. I think there is more to come from the McLaren but that's just my theory.\n\nedit- plus most other teams have bought some form of bigger upgrade this season, mclaren has only bought some circuit specific changes, a small floor test in saudi to confirm changes for bigger updates, and their suspension update this race which is more just reducing blockage and drag than a massive overhaul. so mclaren is yet to bring something big like redbull's changes this and last round""]",16,53,0.6,16,394,394,-1,1,-0.010000000000000009,-1

Some of them prefer hotter temperatures, some cooler, some perform better in dirtier air than others, some get their tyres up to temperature quicker, some are kinder on their tyres over longer runs etc.\n\nA car having a ""bigger window"" means the conditions for it to perform well in are broader and so the drivers have an easier time getting the most of out it.

Rb21 is apparently a car like that, where unless you set it up with the highest sensitivity, it\'ll be the midfield car. \n\nThe bigger window now means that the mouse sensitivity is now slightly lower, so you have more room with your control and inputs, and still be fast enough to be top of the field.']",4,34,0.7,4,30,30,1,6,-0.010000000000000009,1
