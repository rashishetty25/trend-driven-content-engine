1huk9hn,Jacky Ickx 1970,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1huk9hn/jacky_ickx_1970/,2025-01-05, Discussion,"Many agree Jacky Ickx was an outstanding talent and absolute top liner in the early 70s, but he unfortunately never won a championship. After some thinking I realised how his 1970 season was actually spectacular and he was arguably the best driver that year.

That year was marked by Jochen Rindt death, despite him eventually winning the WDC posthumously. Rindt is another outstanding talent and perhaps one of the most underrated drivers ever, back to Ickx, I think the important thing to consider is that year Lotus had the 72, which you can't even begin to describe how much more technically advanced and efficient it was compared to Ickxs 312B. It's an entirely new platform of car and a generation ahead, torsion bar suspension massively improved grip and ride, not to mention the inboard brakes which reduced unsprung mass, and importantly, the amount of downforce the car produced compared to the rest. Yes it was finicky and fragile but there's no doubt is was in a class of its own, yet Ickx was still blazingly fast. In France he led the early stages and set the pace likely in contention for a win before mechanical trouble, and in Britain was absolutely rapid leading Branhan and Rindt before differential failure, Rindt was quite slow that day and only lucky to win because of Brabhams last lap misfortune. Ickx had already lost more points at that point in one during the year retiring from Monaco with mechanical troubled and getting torpedoed by Jackie Oliver in Jarama. Ickx and Rindt then put on a stunning display in Hockenheim changing the lead 7-10 times race long and we're always separated by a car length or two, with Rindt eventually taking the win and Ickx second,  however it's just important to note what Ickx was doing in a car that was so much less capable than the Lotus. Ickx then took a dominating win in Austria then Monza is where the tragedy occurred with Rindt on the Saturday. Nevertheless Ickx put the car on pole and led the early stages befote more mechanical trouble and another win lost. He then won the Canadian Grand Prix, but needed to win the U.S Grand Prix to win the title, but a fuel line issue dropped him to 4th hindering his closing up to the front and eliminating him from contention, Jochen Rindt winning the title posthumously. Ickx ended the season with a dominant win in Mexico. Ultimately looking back it's a tragic year and Ickx is glad he didn't win the title against a dead man who couldn't defend it. There are rumours his mechanic purposely sabotaged his fuel line on Ickxs own will so that he wouldn't win the title, with this theory stemming from an old clip that resufaced on a Belgian TV special on Ickx, although that's a story for another time. 


I just think it's important to consider Ickx was possibly the best driver of the 1970 season and absolutely had the talent to have won a world championship in his career but unfortunately that never turned out to be the case. Still arguably the most complete racing driver of all time!

","['His le mans record tells you how good he was', 'Meh, Ickx was all right. He did perform decently with some great drivers, but overall, his advantage over his teammates was moderate. Rindt, on the other hand, was incredible, and unfortunately, his career was cut short because of his death. Rindt is in good contention of being the greatest one-time champion of F1 (Along with N.Rosberg/Button/Raikkonen). Ickx was beaten quite easily by Laffite and Peterson (Although with Laffite, it happened in the late 70s, when I think he was past his prime). And beat 43-year-old Jack Brabham, who was quite possibly the worst multiple-world champion of F1.', 'He was not much better than Regazonni and got destoyed by Peterson.

1hupd7z,Why do people keep making up that the F2012 was the 4th fastest car?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hupd7z/why_do_people_keep_making_up_that_the_f2012_was/,2025-01-06, Discussion,"Like in terms of race pace it was just barely behind McLaren (the fastest car based on raw pace), it was the most reliable car on the grid and it only real big issue was the inconsistent Qualifying pace. At the very least it was not worse than the Lotus. And also Massa made it look far worse than it actually was with his atrocious first half of the Season. ","['Because Alonso should have won the championship in every season he has ever competed in', 'It was, very early in the season. At times even slower than 4th but they made big steps forward fairly quickly.', ""Because the Red Bull and McLaren were clearly faster that year, I'd say also the Lotus was overall superior.\n\nEven when they improved the car it was still generally off the pace of Red Bull and McLaren.\n\nIts rare to challenge for a title in a car that is practically never the best on the grid, let alone to the final race."", 'I remember someone from sky asking Alonso about his prospects early in 2014, Alonso himself said that he would always strive to be the 2012 version of himself \n\nSo probably 2012 is his best performance in F1 regardless of the championship', 'Nah, this is way off course. I agree the car was generally better than portrayed from the Spanish GP onwards, but would still agree with the general consensus it was fourth fastest.\n\nThe simple matter of fact is that in the four weekends where rain fell in qualifying or the race, Alonso won two and was second in the other two. He outscored Vettel in these weekends 86-33. That tells you a lot of what you need to know.\n\nYou agree yourself the McLaren was the fastest car, and there is no way the Lotus was slower unless you somehow believe Kimi‚Äôs performance approaches that of Alonso‚Äôs, which cannot possibly be true given what happened in future years + the comparison with Massa both directly and relative to Alonso', ""I wouldn't say it was the 4th fastest, but he should have never been in the title race in that car. Imo Alonso extracted the maximum from that car in pretty much every race and was better than any other driver that season. It still is the single best season I've seen from a driver."", ""At best it was the third fastest car. It's debatable whether Ferrari was slower than Lotus (I don't think it was). Either way it was one of the best performances of all time.\n\nI do think his 2010 season is massively overrated though. He made several mistakes that year and was only in contention because Vettel suffered from unreliability and made a few mistakes himself. Out of his 5 wins he inherited 2 from Vettel's unreliability and was gifted a win by Massa."", 'It was the 4th fastest in the first 2-3 rounds and somewhere around the last 3. Aside from that it was a great Sunday car with incredible reliability.\n\nMassa being shit made the car look worse than it was.', 'The Quali Pace was the real pace.
