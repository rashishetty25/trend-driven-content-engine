- Norris finishes anywhere P2-P7, Piastri must finish at least 2 places behind Norris, and Verstappen anywhere behind Norris.

F2 cars are usually parked elsewhere."", ""On the tracks I have been to, the F1 teams have their garages, but they do not share them with the other support series.\n\nThe other support categories are in the support paddocks nearby and will wheel their stuff (tyres and their kit on trolleys) over to the F1 pit lane just before their event. And set up in the area outside the F1 garages, where the F1 cars would stop where they pit.\n\nThen as soon as their event is done, they will wheel their stuff out. Everything they need fit onto the trolleys. The support categories would use the screens on the pit wall, but as far as I know they can't operate the equipment on the pit wall. They use their own walkie-talkies.\n\nIt's like how the F1 team move their stuff on track and off the track on the main straight for the race.

1p9bb0s,Pirelli hasn't learned a thing from past experiences,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p9bb0s/pirelli_hasnt_learned_a_thing_from_past/,2025-11-29, Discussion,"2023 we had tyre issues caused by tyre construction 
2024 we had tyre issues caused by tyre construction 
And now 2025 we are having the same old repeat.
In 2 years they haven't learned a thing.
At some point you gotta question maybe it's time to either delay the homologation to account for final races or have measure in place to address the issues with mid season changes.
That's the only excuse I can come up with this mess caused by Pirelli incompetance. They are forcing teams to run 25 laps stint because they don't want a failure which is a side affect of having a single tyre supplier that they become complicit in innovation and pushing the boundaries. In 4 years of these new tyres we haven't really had any serious improvements nor have we learned from the mistakes. They have continued to fail in making the racing exciting with the failed C6 tyre which is going to be axed for 2026 and they have failed to fix the issue of tyre construction seen in Qatar. FIA has got all the data that Pirelli could need regarding gravel being used and the curbs being used because they are all FIA grades certified. But still we running into the same old problem. 
F1 should really look into opening up the grid to at least 1 more tyre supplier because the argument of costs doesn't hold up when you consider the fact we have got systems in place to regulate tyre suppliers and cost caps. They could treat them as a option for all teams and regulate the suppliers ensuring they are like what Pirelli is now. It would be like different brake suppliers but obviously much more integral to car performance.
This would at least mean that we have motivates for each supplier to do there best and we could see real push for innovation with tyre suppliers having a benchmark in form of other suppliers.
I am not saying we need to regulate it but we do need to offer a option for all teams.
We can a small set of rules for tyre suppliers basically along the geometrical shape limits for car design consistency and ensure that the tyres are easily interchangable. Maybe in 2000s it didn't work well but with current set of regulations and also mechanism on a sporting level we could make it work. Something to also add is that last Pirelli initially blamed debris for tyre punctures it's interesting to see how they have change the notion coming to this week and also I didn't mention that they had 2021 even though even they had tyre failures because they were different construction also the curbs that are used are something FIA has certified so clearly something that is not track's issue but a fundamental flaw that hasn't changed for Pirelli","[""I aint reading that wall.

Many people blamed specific debris last year because it was an easy conclusion from just watching the race.
