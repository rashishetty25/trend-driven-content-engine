How does a team decide whether they need it at the start or the end of the pit lane?

What factors are taken into account to make this decision? (time lost during pits, the width of the pit straight, etc)

He comes in to pit and Lewis follows at that same gap.

1juilz6,Concept Convergence: The one thing that is not being brought up in the “difficult to overtake” conversations this season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1juilz6/concept_convergence_the_one_thing_that_is_not/,2025-04-08, Discussion,"In Adrian Newey’s 2017 autobiography, “How to build a car”, Newey brings up how the 2016 grid was almost a monolith, and how the racing became less exciting because “all cars looked the same”. He cites “concept convergence” as at times inevitable, but also a sign of a bad cycle of regulations. This has been the persistent problem of the post-2023 regs and why overtaking has been so difficult this season. The cars are the most identical they have been, and that’s a problem.

Some things that I noticed when browsing about discussions as to why the Japanese Grand Prix was a parade, is that people bring up the usual suspects of weight, dirty air by outwash, tyres lasting too long, and the cars just being too large in general. While dirty air will always be a contributor to bad racing, it is important to remember that the first half of 2022 had some of the best racing we’ve ever seen, with cars being the same size they are now, and the heaviest they’ve ever been (the 2022 cars are F1s all time heaviest cars), with tyres lasting much longer than they do now as well.

The reason why the first half of 2022 had exciting racing was plainly and simply, concept divergence. We had three functional concepts: The Red Bull downward sloping sidepod concept, the Merc “zero-pod” or “hide-pod” concept, and the Ferrari Bathtub concept. The Red Bull had great straight-line speed, the Ferrari was great in high-speed corners, the Merc was great in the low-speed corners and in tyre preservation. However, with TD39, and the 2023 floor edge regulations, everything changed.

By mid-2023, Ferrari abandoned the bathtubs, and Merc also joined the Red Bull concept in 2024. The cars more or less look the same now, and while some cars have different qualities than others (McLaren having a high-speed corner advantage last season and a tyre advantage this season), the characteristics of the cars are broadly the same, and the field spread is the lowest it has ever been. This, understandably, makes overtaking difficult, even with DRS. In 2021, while dirty air was still a problem, concept divergence was very strong with three different concepts pioneered by the three major engine manufacturers. Different cars still had different driving characteristics (like the Red Bull high rake concept vs the Merc low rake concept), while having roughly the same pace. This is not the case this season, as the variance in driving characteristics is extremely low.

In conclusion, this regulatory cycle has run its course, and the racing is not going to get any better. Hopefully, the 2026 regs allow for more concept divergence, which in turn will improve the product we see on track. While dirty air, weight, and the size of cars contribute to bad racing, concept convergence is the death knell for a regulatory cycle and what signifies the need for change. I am curious to know if anyone else had any thoughts on this. Thanks for reading.","['>In 2021, while dirty air was still a problem, concept divergence was very strong\n\n...and overtaking was still difficult, so...', 'Spec series literally have identical cars and still far more overtakes than F1. If anything, the smaller the difference between cars is the closer the racing is.', 'Spec series has the best racing though, so all teams being very similar would be ideal.', ""This is a bastardization of what Newey said, and doesn't make much sense from any perspective you look at it. \n\nDo you know what season had better racing than the first half of 2022? 2024. This was because the cars were much closer in performance to each other than at any other times in theses regs. 2022 was more exciting from a car development perspective, because of the concepts being different. In addition, there's something to be said about cars being better in quali or in the race making things more exciting. However, it doesn't make sense to say the racing is not going to get any better this year, after three races, and it really doesn't make sense to blame concept convergence for the poor race in Japan. \n\nIf you looked at the first couple races of 2024, you would have thought we were going to be in for a terrible season. If we followed your hypothesis, it would have been. But we had a genuinely good year of racing overall, with lots of tight battles. \n\nThis year, we've had a fantastic race and a couple of boring ones, what is looking to be a genuine title fight, and four cars within three tenths in both quali and race pace on most circuits. It's very hard to predict, but there is no reason to think this will be a bad year."", 'The issue is mainly the change to the floor edge in 2023. Raising this was done to remove porpoising but ended up forcing teams to try and seal the floor with a bunch of complex structures that created tons of outwash and vorticities.', '2024 was a banger- wtf are you talking about?', 'I think design convergence and performance convergence can be separately analysed. One thing I really liked about 2022 ground effect regulations is that we had three distinct designs from the top 3 teams - Red Bull Racing, Mercedes, and Ferrari (as you mentioned). With time as teams saw performance benefits in one design over the other (Mercedes abandoning zero sidepods), and teams running into FIA TDs (Ferrari with flexi floor) we eventually see everyone settling into more or less a similar design concept. It just happens to be that McLaren have nailed all the critical parts - suspension geometry as well as sidepods and floor design. It’s not a coincidence that eventually all cars start to look alike as we get closer to end of current regulations. \n\nNow on the difficulty in overtaking part, it’s more about teams being closer to one another than ever before (qualifying gaps are a good indicator of just how close the field is) in terms of *performance*, since more or less every team now has a good understanding of current regulations. In Suzuka, Pirelli having an oversight in expected tyre deg due to track resurfacing led them to use same compounds instead of going a step softer which would’ve produced better racing. \n\n2026 regulations are shaping up to be similar to start of turbo-hybrid era in 2014 i.e. [a power unit formula](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/big-chance-f1-2026-is-engine-formula-adrian-newey/). Aero will have little role to play, at least initially, and eventually we will see design as well as performance convergence with time, just like we always do.', 'Yeah I don’t think this is the issue, this wouldn’t account for 10 car DRS trains when the guy in front is so much slower than the cars behind but he still can’t be overtaken. The biggest issue is aero wash and the second biggest issue is the size of the cars.', ""Brundle many years ago: the problem is the cars are about 2-3 metres long, and braking distances are usually 100m or less, so you need to be 1-2% better to be halfway alongside. That's tough. Apparently in Suzuka it was 1.5%, so very little in absolute terms. \n\nFine by me personally.  Some races are good and some are bad. \n\nAlso Brundle: overtaking should be like a goal, not a point in tennis.""]",82,38,0.7,82,455,455,7,2,0.0,7

I might be stereotyping here, but are there manga, anime, magazines, games, technology, food products, endorsements etc that we don't really see outside Japan?

I was a big fan of the Initial D series as it was being produced and there was a lot of hype around Keiichi Tsuchiya and the drift driving on hill climbs etc that seemed to produce a lot of fandom and commercial spin offs.

Some of the Yuki merch the fans were wearing was a few years old, so unlikely driven by the recent news. They were probably supporting throughout his career. Also, obviously, some really cool fan made outfits supporting Yuki. There was also a Yuki themed gachapon in one of the shops. But outside of that, just saw the type of merch you would see at any Grand Prix, I didn’t see anything uniquely different for Yuki.

","['I wonder if the ""straight"" after the hairpin and before the spoon curve could be used as a DRS zone.

That\'s more than can be said for Liam or even Checo at some points.\n\nHe messed up somewhere in Q2 and wasn\'t able to put in a solid lap there, and was further off Max\'s pace than he had been up until that point. It was an error on his part on the lap that mattered, on top of a bit of a difficult tyre call from the team. Getting into Q3 needs to be his goal and he fell short there, but getting deeper into the top 10 is going to be a bit of a stretch goal when the top 4 teams are so competitive, with the upper midfield not being far off.\n\nThe bad qualifying pretty much put the nail in the coffin for the race. It was very hard to overtake and very few people managed any in race overtakes. He got past Lawson on lap 1, and he managed to pull an undercut on Gasly in the pit window. Not exactly amazing feats for an RBR, but then few others managed to make any gains in the race either way, so it\'s something. He didn\'t go backwards and he didn\'t make any errors, which again is a step up from Lawson, if faint praise.\n\nIt\'s hard to say how much he could or should have been capable of in the race, given that none of the other top team\'s drivers were ""out of position"" on the grid. I feel like Max, or even the Ferrari/Mercs would have managed to gain some more places and get past the likes of Alonso and Bearman, the only data point we have is that Hamilton got past Hadjar in a few laps. Maybe it was harder for Yuki to make moves in the midfield train, but maybe he should have managed to gain more places and grabbed a few points.\n\nIt was always going to be difficult for Tsunoda to jump into a new car with no practice, one which is notoriously hard to drive. He didn\'t do amazing but he didn\'t do terribly, and there are positive signs. It\'s always going to be hard to say how well Lawson would have done given a few more races at more comfortable tracks for him, but for now at least, Yuki does seem to have been the better choice.
