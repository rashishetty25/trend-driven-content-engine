He cut it down to 9 seconds, but it would have made things more interesting during the SC if Max didn't have a free stop or if Lando didn't have to lose a place to Oscar to begin with. \n\nMcLaren could have waited because Lando's pace was fairly steady.

Charles tried valiantly to get a conversation going, but the vibes were off in the room that day. \n\n6) Miami GP - The highlight reel here was weirdly short. This cooldown room could have been an email.\n\n5) Japanese GP - The ""expensive lawnmover with a special floor"" discussion between Lando and Max was memorable. Oscar\'s ""That\'s all that happened in the race?"" was so real. Possibly more eventful than the race itself. \n\n4) Imola GP - The vibes were good but there were no memorable lines. We find out that the tarmac is just THAT bad and bumpy, as expressed by Lando whacking his own hand. Could maybe be switched with Japan but gets a position up for being a way better race. \n\n3) Chinese GP - A fun one with all of Lando\'s references to teammate battles, including Multi 21 and the throwing of the cap. We also get the McLaren drivers imitating Andrea Stella who apparently reminisces a lot about the Schumacher era in Ferrari. Extra amusing because George is way more chill here than in Australia.\n\n2) Bahrain GP - We start out strong with a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek, self-deprecating comment from Lando, immediately followed by a  half-naked George Russell. We have Oscar poking fun at Lando. Lots of jokes from Lando about himself. George becomes Lando\'s sympathetic hype man. Should probably be switched around with China but gets extra points for George being on brand and shirtless.\n\n1) Australian GP - Lando\'s mum\'s swearing being part of the highlights makes up for the slightly awkward vibes between Max and George (and their mutual friend Lando who is thankfully in the middle).
