1nf2lo9,"Please be respectful to the race organizers and understand why Verstappen's Porsche is ""detuned""",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nf2lo9/please_be_respectful_to_the_race_organizers_and/,2025-09-12, Discussion,"There are several publications, among which Motorsport.com, claiming Max Verstappen won't be able to win the GT4 class in the Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie tomorrow, because his Porsche is ""detuned"".

First, the NLS doesn't have a GT4 class. GT4-spec cars are split up into a bunch of different categories, like SP8T for turbocharged GT4-cars with specially designed parts (i.e. Bilstein suspension on Jimmy Broadbent's car) and SP10 for SRO-homologated GT4-cars (SRO is the licenceholder of GT4).

Verstappen's Porsche is entered in the CUP3 GUEST class, which is a separate class for detuned Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport cars. He is not competing against other GT4 cars. If his Porsche were not detuned, it wouldn't be a Permit B car and to get his Permit A ('GT3 licence'), he has to drive a Permit B car first.

Due to articles like Motorsport.com wrote, there have been several hate comments directed towards the NLS organizers, because Verstappen fans think his Porsche is nerfed to slow him down and what not and that it's unfair. Please be respectful and do your research.","['Half the argument on here are between folks who don’t understand F1 rules. You want us to understand multi-classes?', 'I’m just glad the GT4 class is getting some love.\n\nSince you’re correcting bad “nerf” takes, can we call you a nerf herder?', 'Man, it would genuinely never strike me to get *angry* with the organizing body of another motorsport class that a particular driver has *chosen* to join, because I think it might not be showing his ""utter domination"" properly. Jeepers.', "">First, the NLS doesn't have a GT4 class.

There is a SRO GT4 class, which is SP10, no other class is properly GT4.\n\nSP8T is for race cars with a turbocharged engines between 2.6L and 4L, which include non-homologated GT4 cars.\n\nCUP3 is for Porsche Cayman GT4 Trophy cars, which as you put it is separate, and doesn't use cars homologated for SRO GT4.\n\nAlso, theorically, there could be GT4 in other categories, with for example the A110 GT4(+) could be entered in the SP3T category with its 1.8L engine."", 'Not surprising at all.

""Come watch Max compete for 9th!"" is not what they want on their marketing. I would entertain a conspiracy that they over-tuned his car a million times easier than that they hurt his chances on purpose. And I wouldn\'t get that the time of day either. \n\nPeople are so quick to anger. Not asking ""Why is the car detuned? Oh, that\'s just how the category works? Ok,"" and instead jumping straight to ""They don\'t want the object of my parasocial relationship to succeed!

I’ve been watching him for over 20 years covering F1 and I’m finding this book to be a really great and engaging read.  
  
He explains a lot about what he does and how he does it. Gives some really interesting backstory into how he first got in to working in F1 and who he learned from along the way. There’s some great stuff about learning from Murray Walker and also some interesting stuff about Martin Brundle when he was starting out. His love and respect for the sport is obvious also, he talks about Suzuka 2014 and how tricky reporting that weekend was.  
  
He’s a proper trained journalist so the way it’s written makes it an engaging read and not one I’m struggling through at all. If you like F1, Ted or both, can strongly recommend picking this up for yourself or for a Christmas present.  
  
Though if you can, head to a local bookshop instead of Amazon. May cost a couple of dollars more, but if we don’t support these places then we may lose them.","['Two sec, Ted', ""Must say, that's a tacky cover."", 'Thanks ever so much, Ted', 'Holy fucking airbrush that looks nothing like him', ""As a bookseller, the amount of books that have come out in the last 1-2 years by F1 personnel is fascinating.

They clearly shouldn't have lost the knowledge or data on how the car exactly worked.

I absolutely love formula 1 and cars in general, and my dream is to one day become an F1 commentator.

My English is close to native level, and I’ve been told I have great diction. But due to the current gender conflict/polarizations in South Korea, I started questioning my dream. Would being a woman be a barrier if I try to pursue commentary in F1? Or are there any similar examples? I’d really appreciate your thoughts and advice.
