There's not a lot of options available when track position is so important and the best strategy is a one stopper."", 'The first races of the new reg were so great. Verstappen and leclerc batteling it out in barain swapping positions every lap basicly was fantastic. We went into the completly wrong direction from there sadly', ""He's 100% right. The racing is not good, in my opinion. I know it has been close in terms of standings, and while that is wonderful to hear, this season has been absolutely shocking based on the quality of racing. Amongst the seasons under these regulations, this personally has to be one of my lowly rated seasons of the bunch\n\n\nEverything seems to be decided in qualifying and Turn 1, the cars are large, so close wheel-to-wheel racing is risky for drivers to make attempts and Pirelli's tyres are godsent. I am hesitant to criticise them as well because it is a difficult task. But they have made the tyre wear aspect so durable, that it becomes a non-factor in strategies already"", ""Its pretty much how the 2010 season was:fantastic title battle but very boring actual races. The pole sitter usually ran away with the win if he didn't have reliability problems or wet weather shenanigans. \n\nTyres are too durable and overtaking is extremely hard,track position is crucial."", 'Most of these races feel like Monaco this year. Qualifying and subsequently free air is just king.', ""Think the drivers are more or less frustrated than the spectators? \n\nI watch most races on DVR. Watch the first five laps while they shake it out and then bump five minutes forward, check the positions are unchanged. Bump forward again. Positions unchanged...  etc etc. Even the manic enthusiasm of the commentators can't disguise the dullness of the sport."", 'Just look at yesterday with Norris. He had DRS for lap after lap and still couldn’t pass. You almost have to be 0.200 behind to even have a chance at overtaking with DRS.\xa0\n\nI’m glad this is almost over though. 5 more races. This year is almost as bad as 2023 right now. But even honestly I think these regs have been terrible and haven’t delivered what they promised.\xa0', 'F1 is a very science/data driven sport. A driver can\'t just show up one day, ""give it their all"", and perform massively better in the race than the data suggests they can.\n\nIf you push the car harder, you burn through tyres faster. The best tradeoff for race time/track positioning is already known by the teams before the race begins.\n\nIf the data suggests that coming out of Lap 1, in 6th, the wear you\'d have to put on the tyres to get up to 5th would probably come back to bite you later in the stint/pit stop strategy, then you just hold position. And the guy in 5th holds position. And everyone just holds position. You\'re probably roughly where you should be in the running order unless you massively underqualified, at which point it\'s a bit optimistic that you can jump 3 positions further up the order, even if you are slightly out of position, pace wise. You\'re not out of position by *enough.* Again, it\'s not a sport where a driver can just get a good night\'s rest and be a second faster per lap. Everyone is very much limited by physics.\n\nThe closer the field is, you will have less overtaking in a series where tyre degradation is a real thing (especially when following). You need meaningful differences between the cars/drivers to create enough of a gap to make overtakes easy enough to pull off (for the faster cars), that you may want to use up a bit of rubber to push for track positioning, or go for a two stop strategy despite coming out behind slower cars, because you\'ll be able to fly past them with your faster car + fresh tyres.\n\nIf you want overtakes, you need to stop people saving tyres. Driving seconds off the pace intentionally because it works out in a net race time gain means that everyone is driving massively under the limit, and when drivers of this level are driving massively under the limit, the chance for a significant mistake is close to zero. If your car is only a few tenths faster a lap, and the driver in front makes zero significant mistakes for 1.5 hours, then you\'re not getting past.', 'This is the first year I’ve followed the full season since the 90’s. It’s been a tough watch, sadly. When cars can’t get past on a track like COTA, with a nice DRS zone, something needs fixing. Sports are entertainment. I will eventually find something else to do with my time if I’m not being entertained.', ""Here's the deal: \n\nThe cars are very close to each other in terms of performance, its tough to pass under that situation. \n\nThe DRS zone could have been a bit longer I think, that would have fixed most of what we were seeing. COTA is a track which is really great for racing when you can make it so cars can stick close to each other leading up to the back straight and through the final sector. A longer DRS zone on the back straight would have induced more battles.""]",1059,262,0.96,1059,254,254,412,65,0.0,412

I feel like Austin really showed how Mercedes and Ferrari can become the ""kingmakers"" in this season. You have some of the best drivers on the grid driving absolute shitboxes, acting as on track roadblocks for anyone trying to get a podium. They also seemingly don't understand their own cars, so it's not like Red Bull or Mclaren can easily plan around them. Despite all this, both teams have non-zero shots at podium positions and so they really have the chance to cause upsets.

For me, the extra exciting part is that Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull are in their own constructors fight for second. Every point matters all the way through the top 8, not just for the 3 championship drivers.

I'm wondering if we'll even see a podium with all the championship contenders on it before the end of the season. I feel like it's definitely possible.

He’s exceptional at positioning his car, you can see it from his starts as well. I’m also just relieved he’s getting praise from the general fanbase for this, because there have been a few performances this season where I felt he did a top-class drive but didn’t get recognition from casual fans for it because of the car being unremarkable or overshadowed (Saudi Arabia, Spa, Monza.)\n\nThe moves and pace Antonelli had after pitting were brilliant and I wonder if he could’ve had his first on track fight with his teammate had things gone another way. If he had this level of performance at the European tracks, his stock would be much higher - it’s strange how the moment they leave Europe, he’s the fiery rookie I remember from F4. I hope he can end the season on a good note.\n\nI’m disappointed in Sainz, but also not surprised? This year has been a rollercoaster and with him becoming more comfortable in the team, we can see him trying old tricks. The problem is, he shouldn’t trust rookies to make space for him like that. To me it seems like Sainz still has the mentality that everyone he’s racing is a top driver with years of experience. But he needs to reel back in his expectations for how other drivers will react to his moves. Other than that one silly mistake though, I’m pleased with his pace and continued improvement with this car.\n\nAnother underrated weekend from Bearman. He is just so quick when he’s feeling confident, and nobody can say he doesn’t have the willingness to risk moves. I’m excited to see how he grows and one day how he does in Ferrari.\n\nI wouldn’t say Norris had a good weekend because he didn’t complete the sprint (not by his own fault, but we have no idea how he would’ve done) and he was stuck behind Leclerc for almost 90% of the race. But compared to Piastri, Norris looks like a real WDC contender. As in... Piastri was absolutely nowhere this weekend. With this being the 4th weekend in a row he’s struggled to make an impact, it feels like he’s on a mental spiral downward. I know he had this problem last season too but his improvement from the end of last season to the start of this one seemed so big that I didn’t think he’d have the same issue. Even though I’m not rooting for him to win it all, I do hope he can find some good results again just to make it a three-way race rather than a two-way race between Norris and Verstappen with him slowly dwindling away.\n\nI’m surprised people thought of this race as boring. There was action all over the field and Leclerc vs Norris alone had me on the edge of my seat. COTA is my home track and I’m always proud when we come here because it never fails to deliver excitement in some way.', 'Another Pirelli masterclass in the books.

I was very skeptical of the call for Leclerc to start on used softs in particular, but I was proven dead wrong with the combination of how well the stops and calls were well-timed, and how well Leclerc made that strategy work. P3 and P4, for everything that has happened to them, is magnificent and I'll take this immensely\n\n\nSpeaking of Leclerc, this has been one of my favourite Leclerc-centric races since Suzuka 2024, and another race to add to my list of reasons on why Leclerc is fierce and precise when it comes to defending. Dude usually goes to the end of his means when he does so, and without too much LiCo-related issues hindering his race, he was able to hold Norris off for very long. Even when Norris overtook him in those two instances *(and cheers to Bozzi)*, Leclerc still applied pressure to Norris whose race can go so wrong if he doesn't take caution. Driver of the day for me, and I'll be damned if this drive goes under the radar when detailing his accomplishments as a driver\n\n\nSmall shoutout for Hamilton for retaining P4 with a strong drive, and for successfully giving me a heart attack for that puncture.

It’s a privilege to be watching this in front of our eyes', ""F1 needs to sort out its tire situation. We consistently are having weekends this year with very low deg and very consistent performance regardless of compounds, which isn't amazing. I understand that Pirelli doesn't love the optics of their tires blowing up or failing or whatever, but there needs to be something changed for the future seasons to make tire strategy more consequential, if at all possible.\n\nLando looked very strong today compared to Piastri. Max looked like 2023. Oscar has had three stinker weekends in a row and is looking rattled- he needs to pull off a win in the next couple weeks to claw back what he's lost.
