Also worth noting: the first time Leclerc and Verstappen passed through the double-yellow zone, Verstappen gained nearly 4 tenths on Leclerc in the stadium by not slowing down as much. He almost passed Leclerc on the main straight by setting up the overtake (aka, racing) in a double yellow zone.

He basically demonstrated to race control that he wasnt going to properly respect a double-yellow, and use it to gain an advantage.  Totally understandable that race control will throw a quick VSC then let them race again.","[""What I found interesting was that there were local double yellows out for the final lap at this incident (after the VSC ended) but not the panels, and therefore the TV timing screen didn't show yellows in the final sector.

However in hindsight, now we have the details, it’s clear why they felt the need to put out the VSC. Safety needs to come first and double yellows do not always slow people down in the way they should.

There's a maximum of 43 points available each weekend (25 for the fastest stop, 18 for the second fastest stop), which means that McLaren can only earn 4x43=172 points at most, which isn't enough to close the 204-point gap, even if Ferrari failed to score a single point at the next four races.

‘’Must bring’’ -

- *Electrolytes* -> Reached 35 degrees, the water stations are easily accessed, but electrolytes really saved the day and kept us feeling well, we got a tube of 24 tablets which was the perfect amount for 2 of us https://amzn.eu/d/6C9X4Rb
- *Cooling towels* -> Keep you cool during the day, fill up pouches using water from the water station and wear them when you get to hot, we got a pack of 4 between 2 of us allowing you to switch when one dries out https://amzn.eu/d/dbJnYl3
- *Portable misting fan* -> Great at keeping you cool when you’re sat down in the sun for a long period of time and great when on the bus transport back to the city https://amzn.eu/d/gHBIZPO
- *Bleacher seat* -> Turn 12 stands are metal bleachers with no back support, these seats provide cushioning and a back, the bleachers are 11 inches deep so some brands are way too big impacting the leg room of people behind, best I could find was 13 inches which was perfect and even had a drinks holder https://a.co/d/6SWin68
- *Hat*/*Sunglasses*/*Portable charger*/*Ear plugs* (if you don’t have an Amex radio)/*Light rain jacket*/*Sun cream*/*Refillable water bottle* are all items I would highly recommend

What not to bring (suggested on some forums to bring but useless in 2025) -

- *Cash* -> COTA has been cashless since 2021 so cash is useless, ended up spending our cash at restaurants instead and for fuel as cash prices were cheaper
- *Lanyard with plastic sleeve* -> All tickets are now on mobiles with no screenshots allowed, you need to show your phone each time for access to the stands
- *Water in a insulated metal cooling flask*/*Snacks* -> The metal sets off the detectors at the entry, this sends you for bag screening and they order you to empty your drinks onto the floor, my brother had a plastic water bottle and got through each time with no search allowing him to keep water and anything he had in his bag, snacks aren’t allowed but only if you get caught

Useful information -

- *Mobile data* was invaluable, we got this whilst at baggage reclaim from an app called Airalo, £15 for unlimited data, £2.50 off for both people if you share your personal code when purchasing
- *F1 organised coaches* were brilliant, well worth the money, huge number of buses so queue was always moving and nice being driven out after a long day
- *Renting a car* was very useful as staying in an Airbnb south of the river, saved us taxi money, parking right next to Waterloo park (where the shuttles are) for $20, a taxi back on the first day cost us $35 one way, also useful in the evenings for parking at restaurants
- *Amex card holders* get free race radios at the circuit, you can collect on any day and keep, the same commentary as you would hear in the UK and kept you in the loop, also acted as ear plugs
- *Turn 12 grandstand* was the best turn in my option, you could see 2/3rd’s of the track including turn 1 and we saw all the major action that happened, there was a TV in front of blocks 6-8 which was very useful (you can see it from all blocks at turn 12 but closer the better to see timing tower), the higher up you are the better, but I don’t think it’s worth paying for the last two rows, we were row 32 and it was perfect for the price
- *Food prices* - Expect to spend €40-60 a day on food/drink at the circuit, very expensive, but can save money on drinks/snacks by purchasing them at the small self checkout vendors

*Disclaimer - This is all my opinion based on my experience, feel free to comment with what you found useful and ask any questions and I might be able to help, will ignore/delete any unhelpful/negative comments*","['Wow, thanks for the info!\n\nHope you had a good time.', 'They were also giving out free electrolytes at guest services. \nAlso, saw several people freeze water bottles and bring in.', 'Pretty much spot on. We like T15. Better actual seats, about three more inches of leg room, shorter walk to just about everything, actual toilets and not porta potties.

If you have experience in this kind of business, it's basically lead generating. I assume they did the same this year?\n\nI'd suggest ear plugs even if you have the radio.

So this is based on my experience and may not be valid for you. \n\nYou should think about what you want to do other than being at the track. You may spend as much or more time away from the track as at it. Even though every time I have gone to COTA I spent every minute I could at the track, I spent almost as much time awake and away from the track. \n\n1. Make sure you get the right info about where you need to enter and exit, COTA doesn’t always post or provide the correct information. \n\n2. Be ready for lines. Everywhere. Getting to the track, at the track, trying to leave the track, after leaving the track. Not as bad as at Spa, but they’re everywhere. \n\n3. Be prepared for a LOT heat and a LOT of sun, but also check the forecast for rain. Normally it is hot and sunny, brutally so if you’re not accustomed to Austin weather. But when it rains it can be nasty. Check out this year’s WEC race on YouTube to get an idea. \n\n4. Pay off your credit cards ahead of time or get your credit limit raised. It’s expensive for F1. I spent less for the VIP lounge at a WEC race than I did for a bleacher seat at Turn 6 for the F1 race. \n\n5. DO NOT take local taxis. I have heard horror stories about the “approved” taxis and seen pimps that looked more trustworthy. \n\n6. Uber in Austin is weird but will get you where you want to go. In 2024 I only had one Uber that  didn’t have a broken windshield and a really strange driver. One guy was talking about handing out free booze to potentially underage people for some events, another was watching anime with subtitles while driving. That being said, I would take an Uber over one of those “taxis” any day.\n\n7. Get a hotel as close to the track as possible and book way in advance. You will be competing with not just F1 teams, but teams from support races and suppliers, plus people in town for non-racing business. Austin is the capital of Texas. \n\n8. Go to dinner and sightseeing in downtown. Austin is a fantastic place. Spend extra time there to enjoy it. For any really good restaurant, make reservations way in advance for the same reason as booking hotels early.\n\n9. If you like beer, there’s lots of local breweries, check them out. Also, if you like cigars there are good cigar shops in town. \n\n10. At the WEC race in 2024 they ran out of beer on race day BEFORE THE RACE STARTED. COTA doesn’t always plan well, so be prepared for disappointment. \n\n11. If you have bleacher seats, bring something to sit on. Your ass will thank you.\n\n12. Cargo pants and jackets with lots of pockets are a helpful. COTA security scans you and checks your bags when you enter. Pockets, not as much. Also, bags can be a pain in the ass to carry and watch. \n\nThis became longer than I expected and is based on my experience but hopefully it’s useful to someone.', 'You should also post this in r/grandprixtravel :)', 'Ill save this I dont think it is everything but they are some great shouts', 'Good tips, hoping to go next year 🤞🏻 so thank you', 'Have they introduced new metal detection devices in the last couple years?

Never looked like being overtaken by either Merc, and when George had to defend from Oscar he built enough of a gap to just stay clear of Oscar at the end. Max did eventually finish ahead, but he was on a different strategy.\n\nIt's one thing gaining positions due to shenanigans of others, but then holding back multiple faster cars for 60+ laps was incredibly good."", 'I don\'t think most F1 fans know what the word ""cheater"" means. And it\'s a little concerning to me how many fans genuinely think a driver must be a terrible, morally bad person because they did something ""dirty."" This is a competitive sport... hate the FIA for not enforcing the rules correctly, not the drivers taking advantage of everything available. \n\nAnyway, onto the actual discussion: another mixed weekend for me as a fan, with Sainz going through the nine layers of hell and Leclerc having another amazing outing. It really does feel like only one of them can do well at a time. I\'m not too upset about Sainz\'s DNF as his race had already been ruined ten times over by various other issues. \n\nThe VSC at the end was disappointing but after reading why they called it, completely understandable. I\'m pretty sure Leclerc would\'ve held Verstappen off as he\'d been keeping Verstappen just out of DRS range for 3 laps prior and he seemed to have quite a bit of tire life saved up just for that reason. I\'m actually more sad we didn\'t get to see Piastri finish hunting down Bearman - I was really curious about whether Piastri would get there before the last lap and, if so, if he\'d be able to make the move. I\'m inclined to say no because Bearman was truly on top of things yesterday, but now we\'ll never know. :(\n\nNot as terrible a weekend for Piastri as I expected, but still not enough. Every weekend I\'ve been thinking to myself ""this is the weekend where Piastri will bounce back,"" and then... he doesn\'t. Maybe I should give up on that now? While Norris had a middling start to the season, his second half has been stellar and the WDC would be well deserved. He\'s bounced back to his pre-2025 qualifying form which is a treat to watch. He\'s my favorite driver to watch qualifying along with Leclerc, when they put together a lap it just feels electric to me... though in different ways. Leclerc\'s laps always make me nervous, Norris\' laps feel buttery smooth.\n\nConsidering how much those P3 and below were battling, a one-stopper was never in the cards. The top three having clean air for most of the second stint was the deciding factor in them being able to do it at all. But coincidentally, the top three in this race are also the top three I would consider at managing tire wear (albeit not in this order). I can name quite a few races this season where their ability to stretch their tire life has given them more strategic freedom. For McLaren in particular, Piastri is going to find it difficult to make any gains on Norris if he both qualifies behind *and* can\'t match his race pace. \n\nExtremely unfortunate weekend for Hamilton, most of it being no fault of his own. Hopefully he has another podium opportunity in the next few races; I\'d still really love to see him and Leclerc get one together before the end of the season. It\'d be a huge morale boost for him and the team going into 2026, which I\'m worried will be a difficult year for them. Personally, I always dread when Ferrari qualify beside each other as they rarely interfere with things and it always causes a commotion in the community from people who expect them to (and sometimes even between the drivers themselves). And as we know, stewarding can\'t be relied upon to enact penalties correctly.\n\nAntonelli had a great weekend. Is titanium dioxide legal in Mexico? And was this his first weekend being quicker than Russell on race pace? If there were others, I can\'t remember them. Russell\'s weekend wasn\'t as bad as people are making it out to be, but it definitely wasn\'t one of his best this season. Bortoleto also had a great race - while not as flashy as Bearman or Antonelli\'s, he\'s quietly continuing to do his job. Really hope Audi comes out of the gates next season half-decent so he can continue to fight for points.\n\nSomething else that got overshadowed yesterday was Albon and Williams. I\'m very glad to hear Albon call Williams out, his garage\'s handling of the last few weekends has been terrible. Hopefully Vowles and the team will take his frustrations to heart and work with him to communicate better. \n\nFinally, I\'m still baffled about the marshals and Lawson incident. As Lawson said, he could have literally killed them! All three of them must have had a life flashing before their eyes moment. Some serious reflection needs to occur from race control and I hope VCARB is pressing the FIA on it. They shouldn\'t rely on the driver\'s quick reaction time to save the marshals. What if it was a blind corner? What if he locked up? What if he was one-hundredth of a second too late in slowing down? Nothing came out of it thankfully, but just because they avoided consequences doesn\'t mean they should be let off the hook. To me, this is a million times bigger of an issue than the VSC at the end and it\'s annoying me that the VSC is taking up most of the discussion - though I understand that they didn\'t air the Lawson incident so a lot of fans probably don\'t even know what happened.', 'I just realized how bad I feel for the Sauber guys being P9 in the constructers at 60 fucking points with 4 weekends to go.\n\nCrazy results all around this year minus Alpine.

It is over regulated. I prefer Indy way of regulating rather than F1. \n\nWe should have rules like if you run wide on the first corner, you can only rejoin at the back of the grid. I believe indycar did that in Indianapolis.', 'This batch of rookies is absolutely incredible. It feels like every single one of them has had some incredible breakout drives this season and are all absolutely holding their own to their experienced teammates. I’m super excited to follow the progression of each of their careers, it feels like there’s every reason to believe they’ll be here for a while. \n\nOllie was phenomenal yesterday, I couldn’t believe when he went from P9 to P4 in the first (I think?) 10 laps. Bortoleto going from P16 to points was another storyline that got missed in the chaos of the front but was absolutely well done. And Kimi holding his own towards the front with a McLaren baring down towards him, another solid weekend from him. It’s funny how a lot of these rookies seem to have stellar weekends in tracks where they would have never raced before, and super impressive.', 'After Zandvoort, things looked super grim for Lando and Oscar seemed to have one hand on the WDC. Five straight McLaren wins (would have been 5 straight 1-2s if not for the mechanical DNF), Max a hundred points back, it looked like McLaren were going to run the table with wins for the rest of the season and the odds of Lando pulling out enough wins over Oscar to claw back a 34 point deficit looked downright impossible. Many people were (rightfully) saying he’d need to go on a run of consistency he’s never shown before to do it. \n\nSince Zandvoort, he’s been 5-0 over Oscar in races and 4-1 in qualifying. There has been no other stretch this whole season where either of them have outscored the other more than three weekends in a row. He’s outscored Oscar by an average of 7 points per weekend over those 5 races—which is the exact amount he would have outscored him by if he won 5 straight with Oscar finishing P2 every time, something that seemed impossible to imagine a few months ago. While everyone was focusing on Max’s incredible run (and well deserved, he’s had some amazing performances the last 5 races) and Max’s chase of Oscar’s lead, Lando has been seemingly almost quietly just chipping away every weekend at whatever he could get. He hasn’t been perfect, he’s had his mistakes in Baku and in Singapore qualifying, but he’s just kind of kept his head down and done what he needed to do each weekend. \n\nThere’s still a long way to go and this WDC could truly go any direction, but you’ve gotta give credit to Lando for how he’s shown a ton of resilience this season. To bounce back from Canada by winning 3 of the next 4, and to bounce back from Zandvoort by retaking the championship lead just 5 races later is super impressive and something I don’t think many people expected him to be able to do.']",47,403,0.92,47,2008,2008,-2,2,-0.019999999999999907,-2

When Jenson Button, fresh off his championship win with Brawn GP (the team that became Mercedes), opted for McLaren, he set off a chain of events that defined the next decade of F1.
What if Button had stayed?
Button at Mercedes (the dominant era): Button, with his smooth style and skill, would have had a second golden opportunity. He likely would have won multiple championships in the hybrid era, much like Lewis Hamilton.
Hamilton at McLaren: Without Button, Lewis's story with McLaren would have continued. He might have stayed longer, but it's unlikely he would have tolerated the McLaren-Honda disaster. His frustration would have pushed him to seek another top team, like Ferrari, completely changing his trajectory.
Vettel at Red Bull: Sebastian Vettel's frustration with Mercedes' dominance was the main reason for his departure to Ferrari in 2014. With Button at the wheel of the dominant Mercedes, Vettel might have hung on longer at Red Bull. This would have affected the rise of other drivers, like Sergio Pérez and Max Verstappen.
Verstappen's rise delayed: With Vettel still at Red Bull, the opportunity for Max Verstappen wouldn't have come so quickly. Max's meteoric rise, with his 2016 victory, would likely have been delayed by several years.
Ferrari and other teams: If Pérez had signed with Ferrari (a real possibility in 2013), the team's lineup would have been very different. Also, Nico Rosberg's retirement after the intense rivalry with Hamilton never would have happened, so Bottas wouldn't have arrived at Mercedes in 2017.


Without Jenson Button we would never have seen the dominance of Hamilton or Max Verstappen, nor Alonso in the Honda era, nor even Vettel at Ferrari, nor the retirement of Rosberg and the signing of Bottas at Mercedes.So obviously events from 2010 to 2025 would never have happened but anyway what do you think? 


","['Lot of assumptions in there. Would Button have retained his seat through the hybrid era? Especially if Vettel or Hamilton came knocking. Could Button have seen off the challenge from Rosberg? Verstappen was originally a Mercedes driver - Wolff had no place for him back when he had Hamilton-Rosberg in the team, but what if it was a Rosberg-Button lineup?\n\nFact is, Button had quite a few hiccups even during his 2009 run to the title. He was never as highly rated in the paddock as the likes of Hamilton, Alonso & Vettel - and the elite drivers will usually have a hotline to the best teams and vice versa.', 'A lot of big driver moves honestly do shake things up.

I just don't remember if Schumacher wanted to leave or Mercedes simply didn't extend his contract. If it was the latter, then Hamilton would have found his way into Mercedes for 2013 regardless."", ""If Button wasn't at McLaren then Hamilton would have won a championship according to Button himself. He stated that if McLaren only supported one driver like Red Bull and Ferrari only supported Vettel and Alonso then McLaren would have won at least one championship during that time.

- Right after this screenshot, Max got squeezed and pushed onto the curb which caused him to bottom out, lose all grip and go off

- Max immediately gave back the place to Hamilton in T4/5

- Max broke as early as the Ferraris did. 

- Max did not put himself in a position where “this was always gonna happen”. He had plenty of space when making it 3 wide. Cars have gone 3 wide there practically every race and it worked before. 

- If you still don’t believe me, watch his onboard. 


Max never gained an advantage. If anything he lost a chance to go around the outside of the cars on the inside and gain an actual position. Instead this put him at risk of being overtaken by Russel.

And not because Max went wide and trough the grass.\n\nIf anyone should be penalised here, it should be Leclerc. He cut 2 corners, and had no reason to go over the grass because he was well in control of his car and couldve gone back on track but chose to grass instead.

Verstappen squeezed Hamilton, pushing Hamilton wide causing him to lose all grip and go off (which in your book would mean everything Hamilton did afterwards completely fine).

Lewis manages to keep alongside, they will take the battle to T2
- Lap 6 T2: Max, yet to complete the move on Lewis, goes wide and completes the move off track, cutting T3 in the process. Lewis stays within the track and lines up a move for T4.
- Lap 6 T4: Lewis tries to make the move around the outside on Max, goes off and completes the move off track. He then rejoins and doesn't give back the position.

Logical outcome in my opinion: both drivers get a 10 second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage.

Actual outcome: only Lewis gets a penalty...

Am I missing something or is this just bad stewarding?","['https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/Yn4g0c4q4B', ""Read the decision documents.\n\nThey say that, under the current rules, since Max is clearly (their word) ahead at the apex (i.e. having their front axle ahead of the other car's mirrors while overtaking on the inside), then Lewis should have yielded the corner. It was a legal overtake. The reason you say that the overtake wasn't completed, is because Lewis, incorrectly, failed to yield. Under the rules, it was completed. \n\nSo at the next corner, Lewis is attempting an overtake and pushes Max off track. Had Max not rejoined ahead, then it would have been a penalty for Lewis. Actually this corner might be considered still part of the previous corner, and since Max was ahead at the first apex, he was entitled to this corner as well.\n\nThen Lewis makes a mistake while attempting another overtake on Max. He gains the place and doesn't give it back. It's a clear penalty. Doesn't matter what occurred behind with Russell and Bearman. \n\nUnder the current rules (which I don't think are right by the way), it was correct that Lewis got the penalty and Max didn't get any. \n\nI think this has always been the problem between Lewis and Max going back to 2021. They seem to be driving under different racing rules/guidelines.

But other than that Max could not return position anymore as Hamilton cut a whole corner, so Hamilton was infront again, so no advantage gained.', 'In addition to what others have said, that Max was ahead at the apex and therefore entitled to the corner while Lewis was not, another critical difference is that Lewis gained a position by going off track while Max did not (since he immediately lost it to Lewis again on the next corner).\n\nYou obviously are not going to get a penalty for ""leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage"" if you did not gain a lasting advantage. People are saying that Max didn\'t give the place back, but you cannot give a place back that you don\'t have. And while the rules are sometimes poorly written, they aren\'t so poorly written that they require drivers to do logically impossible things.\n\nIt really feels like people just understand the rules poorly and think that any gaining of a position while off track immediately yields a penalty, regardless of what happens after. That is not the case, and has never been the case. Drivers are always given a while (not sure if there\'s an exact time limit, but it\'s at least a lap or so) to give a place back.

Let's take each incident from yesterday's race. 

1. Lap one. Max makes a great start and is forced wide into turn one. Knowing that if he brakes at the appropriate point to make the corner he is most likely going to come out in p5, given the shape of the corner, he overshoots the corner and runs across the grass. Before people say he gave the places back, I would argue they weren't his places to begin with, as he was in overspeed whilst everyone else was braking so of course he was alongside at the apex. If there was a wall there he would be forced to tuck in and not have a risk free pass. I can't believe there wasnt a penalty for this. For the record I think Leclerc should have had one as well, Lewis seemed to get passed him and instead of staying on track he just cut the corner and took the place. 

2. The incident with Lewis. This one is perhaps even more egregious. He comes from a long way back and makes a lunge on Lewis. Lewis is banged into and is forced off track. Max then, on the outside for the next corner with Lewis on the inside, just cuts the grass and takes the place from Lewis. I can't believe this was not a penalty, it was a slam dunk penalty for forcing a driver off track and gaining an advantage. Cut and dry. Then Lewis gets a 10 SECOND Penalty for locking up at turn 4 and not giving the place back, which I think was incredibly harsh but it is what it is.

3. The VSC. This is an interesting one as I've seen alot of people saying the FIA screwed Max with the VSC, however before that during double yellows, Verstappen gained about 5tenths in the last sector by not lifting compared to Charles, which is the reason he was so close coming out of the last corner when the VSC was thrown. If it hadn't have been thrown and Verstappen would of got the move done, it would have been interesting to see what the stewards would've done.

I think this points to a wider conversation about f1 stewarding, and it's integrity. It feels to be like for some drivers they have incredibly harsh penalties but for others they can drive incredibly recklessly and no punishment is afforded. There is no consistency at all and it baffles me that these stewards are watching the same race as everyone else.

Anyway happy redditing and welcome opposing viewpoints and discussion :)","[""As for point number one, he did brake at the usual point, however he was forced off the track and onto the bumpy curb where he started bottoming out, at which point you cannot slow down at the normal rate.\n\n\nThe second incident was a messy bit of driving all around, however Chandok's Sky analysis said the stewards got it right.TLDR he was ahead at the apex of turn two and kept it on the track, he was ahead at the apex of turn 3 and Hamilton pushed him wide, thus he didin't need to give the place back, and Hamilton gained a substantial advantage with his off road driving which is why he got a penalty. As for my opinion, the whole sequence was on the edge of the rulebook and if he did get a penalty it wouldn't surprise me, same as it wasn't a massive surprise he didn't get one.\n\n\nAs for the yellow flag incident, the precedent was set in I think Miami, that even a slight lift is enough, so it could be the case that Leclerc lifted more than what was necessary but none of us can judge without the telemetry and I believe other teams would have brought it up if the brach was substantial.\n\n\nLastly, I find it funny that the most punished driver of the last 18 months is thought of having preferential treatment. Stewards rotate every race and while the consistency is lacking because of it, it also ensures no individual bias. And the only confirmed biased steward, who was later removed (Johnny Herbert) was, interestingly, anti-Max."", 'this is going to be a loooong break of useless repeated posts', 'the drivers agreed to these rules. he was not assessed differently.', 'Do you guys watch races with eyes closed?', 'It is cut and dry that he did not force Lewis off at T1 and then avoided him by cutting the next corner. Hamilton then left the track and gained a lasting advantage by doing an overtake like that. Hamilton is simply in the wrong according to the applicable guidelines, whatever your opinion about those might be.\n\nVSC was related to potential fire being reported and the following marshal intervention. Nothing to do with on-track battles. And no indication that someone didnt lift enough.\n\nWhen a T1 goes like yesterday its difficult for the FIA to assess exactly who is and is not in the right, and they tend to let things go especially on lap 1 and with multiple drivers involved. Again, think about it what you want, but i dont think Verstappen got any special treatment there.', ""because he knows the rulebook better than the stewards and is always pushing it to the limit, he's by far the hardest driver to steward"", '> Lap one. (...)  I can\'t believe there wasnt a penalty for this.\n\nHe was well ahead of Russell long before the corner, before he event went to the outside to attempt to overtake the Ferraris. Arguing that he wasn\'t is just disingenuous. \n\n> Before people say he gave the places back, I would argue they weren\'t his places to begin with, as he was in overspeed whilst everyone else was braking so of course he was alongside at the apex.\n\nWhat are you even talking about here? Yes, they weren\'t his places to begin with, which is exactly why he needed to give them back, which he did. Do you think the rules say you only need to give a place back if you *didn\'t* gain it off track? Your whole argument here makes no sense at all.\n\n> The incident with Lewis. This one is perhaps even more egregious. He comes from a long way back and makes a lunge on Lewis. Lewis is banged into and is forced off track.\n\nMax came from a long way back, but was ahead at the apex, in full control of his car, and able to make the corner on his own. Therefore he was entitled to space and it was Lewis to needed to make sure there was no contact. Lewis failed to do this, and the stewards actually investigated him for it (as they should), but they basically deemed the contact too insignificant to penalize, considering neither car got damaged.\n\nPhrasing a contact Lewis initiated as ""Lewis got banged into"" just shows how incredibly biased and dishonest you are being in your entire argument.\n\n> Max then, on the outside for the next corner with Lewis on the inside, just cuts the grass and takes the place from Lewis.\n\nAgain, complete nonsense. Max was ahead of Lewis at this point, and the only reason Lewis was still sort of alongside was because he went off track at the exit of turn 1. Max is obviously entitled to space at this point, but Lewis leaves him none, forcing Max off. At that point Max has no choice but to cut the corner.\n\nHe then rejoined the track ahead of Lewis, gaining the place, and immediately lost it again when Lewis cut the next corner and gained a few seconds from that.\n\nI\'d argue that if Max had stayed ahead, he clearly would not have had to give the place back. But that\'s not even relevant since he didn\'t.\n\n> I can\'t believe this was not a penalty\n\nFor what? Leaving the track and *not* gaining and advantage? People keep demanding a penalty for this incident, and I really wonder how they think the rules work.\n\nEven ignoring the fact that Max was clearly entitled to that space and so wouldn\'t have had to give the place back if he had stayed ahead, the fact is that he didn\'t. You can\'t get a penalty for gaining an advantage if you did not gain an advantage. How is that not obvious?\n\n>  it was a slam dunk penalty for forcing a driver off track and gaining an advantage. \n\nThe driver being forced off was Max Verstappen. Are you saying he should get a penalty for forcing himself off?', ""Did you watch the race last year? Then, both situations went against him and he got 2x 10 second penalty. And that was based on the rules of F1.\n\nBased on the rules of F1, Verstappen didn't deserve a penalty for either situation this year. Don't hate the player, hate the game. 19 drivers agreed to the rules of wheel-to-wheel racing."", '1 day later and the narrative still hasnt changed?\nu can argue that the rules are bad but the application was correct yesterday, only leclerc shouldve given a place back on lap 1', '1. Stewards are typically lenient on lap one incidents and ultimately he left the track in P4 and rejoined in P4 so he didn’t gain anything \n\n2. Per the driving rules, Max had his mirror ahead at the apex and so long as he had control of his car and didn’t go off track he’s free to push Lewis wide. As for the following corner it’s just the nature of the circuit and the line Lewis was now on, Max couldn’t have stayed on track whilst avoiding contact. Then at the next corner where lewis locked up, the stewards found he gained and lasting advantage and didn’t give the position back hence the 10 second penalty\n\n3. Delta isn’t a good measurement for this kind of incident, you need to look at the telemetry to see if he lifted significantly. For example Charles might’ve lifted more than he needed to, which caused the delta to close up. That being said I haven’t personally seen the telemetry and there wasn’t an official investigation which was a bit surprising but I imagine that might’ve been different had he got past']",0,147,0.34,0,1417,1417,0,1,0.010000000000000009,0
