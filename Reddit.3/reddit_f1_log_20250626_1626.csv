It also lets people who have talent but not experience in F1 get used to how to drive an F1 car so when they get to your latest car they are up to speed quickly.\n\nThis is something a lot of the rookies that have come into F1 and done well from the off have had. Hamilton notably had a lot of testing time (might have been current gen back then as well as rules were looser) but Kimi had a lot of miles on previous F1 cars before he ever touched the wheel of a modern Merc.\n\nAlso the engineers can probably draw links between the current car parts and previous and may be able to learn things that are relevant to the current or next gen car."", ""Well they get data which they always love to have, and get to scope out talent.

I'm sure they hoped they had one with Miyata, but he hasn't adapted to F2, which, even though they are very, very different cars, is a large strike against him.\n\nHaas benefitted more directly when Ocon and Bearman also got to drive the car, which has happened. With Ocon changing teams, even driving a 2023 Haas is helpful, especially since it's still in the same regulations. And a little off season test always helps keep the neck strength up too. Driving an F1 car is really the best neck exercise, better than they can do in the gym.

Lots of teams have old cars sitting around, and that doesn't mean they do anything with them.
