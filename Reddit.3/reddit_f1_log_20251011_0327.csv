1o2xajq,What the F1 Singapore GP meant for Red Bull's 2026 driver decision,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o2xajq/what_the_f1_singapore_gp_meant_for_red_bulls_2026/,2025-10-10, News,,"['Probably not much more than the previous races.', 'With Horner gone, Yuki had a better chance of surviving.

While not a great qualifying, another example of delivering consistently.

Of course, nobody saw the anonymous FIA official carrying a portable directed energy weapon that was more advanced than anything any standing military had at the time, nobody reported any electronic interference from the electromagnetic pulse despite being nearby, the rest of Hamilton's car was completely unaffected, and the weapon was somehow able to target -- and hit -- from a distance a part of the car that was roughly the size of a trade paperback book which was travelling at close to 300km/h.
