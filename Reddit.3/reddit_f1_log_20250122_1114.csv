We urge all journalists, creators, photographers and other F1 personalities to also make their content available on alternative platforms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i78lvs/starting_today_we_are_banning_twitterx_content_on/,2025-01-22, Meta,"**TL;DR:** For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter, with the intention to make this ban permanent in some form.

Hey everyone!

After [yesterday’s proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6lm2v/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/) we discussed within the mod team whether a full ban on Twitter content would be feasible. We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers & FOM have not. But we also realize that it’s a *chicken or the egg problem* and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a non-trivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news

In the end we’ve settled on the following approach:

* For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter with the only exception of screenshots of relevant posts by teams, drivers & F1 that are **not available on any other platform**. Even in case of major breaking news, we ask you to post links to the press releases or a screenshot of the post from Instagram, with a link in the comments.
* We hope that this trial period will provide a nudge for F1 journalists, creators and teams to make their content available on alternative platforms as **we intend to make this ban permanent in some form.**

Why a trial period? First of all, sometimes mods make bad decisions even if with the best intentions. (For example in 2015 this subreddit banned images & gifs, which caused a controversy that was only resolved after [Will Buxton stepped in to mediate the situation](https://redd.it/3jmslx).) Second of all, this is one of the strictest approaches to Twitter content and strict bans like this can have unintended consequences, so we might need to later refine this ban. We intend the trial period to last at least until the first races of the new season, after which a final form of the ban would be implemented.

This subreddit has had restrictions on what content can be posted for a very long time. We’ve had the source rating system that labeled the quality of news sites and is still used for removing sensationalist and unoriginal articles. We’ve also had limitations on Instagram due to its requirement for an account to view posts. There’s no doubt that over the past years Twitter has become a low-quality source: the login requirements, the flood of bots, the prioritization of content from paying users and promotion of sensationalist content. But unlike with news sites in our source-rating system, for Twitter there wasn’t really an alternative. But now that viable alternatives are emerging and the proposal thread from yesterday has shown that the community prefers those alternatives, **we think it’s time to try and see how the subreddit works without content from Twitter.**

# For journalists, photographers, creators & other F1 personalities

Our preferred alternative platform is Bluesky and to help avoid impersonations we have created a [list of verified F1 related accounts on Bluesky](https://go.bsky.app/57f6geP). This list is used both for feeds & starter packs on Bluesky, but also for AutoModerator here on Reddit. We are adding new verified accounts whenever we come across them, but please contact us on Bluesky or send a modmail here on Reddit to accelerate this process. We want to assist with this transition and we also want to hear your feedback throughout this trial period, so please get in touch.","[""Twitter was such a a low bar quality news anyway.

I'm sure there are situations that can change the number so I'm basically asking, right now, how many teams you feel F1 should grow/shrink to for maximum health of the sport.

In my opinion F1 should look to target 12 active teams if possible.  I think that's a good number to allow 3-4 to struggle at any given time without majorly impacting the competitiveness of the entire grid and ensuring a competitive midpack, which as we saw in 2023 and  2024 can be vital for the longterm viability of the sport with McLaren and Aston Martin emerging from the midpack to challenge for top positions (and then Aston Martin falling back, but it was still fun while it lasted).
