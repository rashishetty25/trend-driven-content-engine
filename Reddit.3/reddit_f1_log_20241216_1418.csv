Who to support now ?\n\nHello everyone! Well first of all, I am happy that 2024 was my first season watch F1. Have always been a car guy and finally decided to watch a sport related to it. Was initially a bit iffy about it. Thought what would happen if Max wins everything like the last 2 years but this was one heck of a season! Don\'t just want to watch for the fun of it but actually be a ""fan"" of a team and driver. Thought I will watch the whole season and then decide who I want to support. I love Football as well and am a Real Madrid fan, a club with history, prestige and above all, most trophies. I want something similar for the team I support in F1. Ferrari and McLaren come to mind for ""historical"" teams. Ferrari were good initially and in the end but fell off mid season. McLaren were shit to start off but were brilliant after Miami. And I know this is a sport with a lot of nuance. I mean Ferrari haven\'t won a championship for so long, Mercedes were well on to till 2021 and how they have fallen.\n\nSo I do understand that a team will have dominating season but also mid seasons. As for the driver, I\'ll be honest, Carlos was the reason I started watching because he himself is a Real Madrid supporter. He had a decent season, am sad that he is going to Williams but let\'s hope he has a Brawn x Button season. I will support Carlos but I want another guy who can win a championship. (Carlos can win but doesn\'t have the car)\n\nI have narrowed down to Charles and Oscar. I like Max but idk don\'t feel like supporting him or Hamilton in fact because I just feel like it\'s a rivalry before I started watching F1. Russell seems a bit of a Karen. Norris idk he\'s good but everyone talks about his mentality and I agree with that. I mean Charles, Carlos, Hamilton anyone is winning the championship in that Car.\n\nHelp me guys!!!

I‚Äôm planning to attend Silverstone next year, traveling from the US, and I‚Äôve got a few questions.

Where‚Äôs the best place to buy tickets? The F1 website, Silverstone‚Äôs site, or StubHub/Ticketmaster/etc?

From what I‚Äôve seen, Silverstone‚Äôs site seems to be the best deal‚Äîit was about ‚Ç¨200 cheaper than the F1 site. Plus, the F1 site only allowed me to purchase tickets for all three days, while Silverstone‚Äôs site offered single day tickets.

Would it be better to buy tickets for all three days, or just for the race itself?

How‚Äôs the general admission experience? Is it worth upgrading to a grandstand seat, or is GA good enough?

I‚Äôd love to hear any tips or tricks you might have for a first-time racegoer!

Thanks in advance!","['Go for a grandstand.

I had a great time but you need to be prepared.\n\n* Firstly, buy from the Silverstone website.\n\n* Assuming GA, arrive early. I think gates open at 8am, but you should aim to arrive before then, otherwise your chances of finding a good place to sit are slim.\n\n* I don't know how you plan to get there, but the roads will be rammed and the Park & Ride is a bad idea. Parking at the circuit is expensive but worth it unless you like the idea of spending 4 hours waiting in a queue for the bus after the race (maybe it'll be better next year, but that's what happened to us this year)\n\n* In terms of seating, if you go GA, bring camping chairs. You don't want to be sat on wet grass if it rains. We sat on the grass area by the Vale chicane and had a good view of the action, and they have a massive broadcast screen as well. It also meant we were able to get on the track to see the podium since the only entrance they open is there.\n\n* Grandstand seats will be a better experience, but for me personally it's not worth the massive cost.

Kudos to F1 for doing a great job marketing to the teenagers living in my house.

Should we buy our tickets nice and early?  (This is my preference.)
