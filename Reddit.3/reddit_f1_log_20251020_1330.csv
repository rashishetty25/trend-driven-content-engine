1oasmoj,Is Fernando Alonso worth of the hype he has?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oasmoj/is_fernando_alonso_worth_of_the_hype_he_has/,2025-10-19, Discussion,"I fully acknowledge he has 2 titles and both being against some of the best drivers of that time and one of the best drivers of all time. And please take into consideration that I started watching F1 since 2023 mainly. 

However, to me, I feel like Fernando is an over-hyped driver. Of course, he has a sheer brilliance in terms of driving skills, but overall considering him, I feel like he gets more hype than he should be. 

He hasn‚Äôt had a single race win since 2012. Now a lot of people will blame his teams, but we‚Äôve seen drivers improving the whole team & the car. Schumacher did it, Hamilton did it as well. Red Bull developed their car around Max and turned him into a champion. Vettel also did it. However, I cannot see Fernando doing it ever. 

In 2023, he said the car feels a lot better and that car was developed mostly when Seb was in the team, not Alonso. By the end of 2023, the AMR23 couldn‚Äôt keep up with Ferrari & Mercedes. 

In his Ferrari days, the car was decent, however he still couldn‚Äôt overpower the surge of Red Bull and Seb, which is fair to me. In his 2nd time McLaren days, he couldn‚Äôt do much due to the car. In his first McLaren days, he couldn‚Äôt do much due to team preferring Lewis. However, we‚Äôre watching this season, Oscar is still on more points than Lando. 

So yeah, he did have some bad luck, maybe the worst luck as well. But the hype around him seems a little too much. Is he a great driver? Of course. Is he one of the best? In terms of skills, yes. 

However, just blaming on his luck constantly seems a little wrong. I would like to be proved wrong of course, and have a peaceful and constructive discussion. 

TIA","['Overhyped by his own fanbase but only by a tiny bit. Most casuals don‚Äôt appreciate him nearly enough because ‚Äúhe only has two titles‚Äù', 'One of the funniest things I\'ve seen regarding Alonso was Sam Collins from F1TV talking about him, I think in his first year at Aston.

To keep that quali streak in particular alive for that long, in so many different conditions, tracks, etc, is seriously impressive. His race craft is nearly unmatched too, imo. So yes, I think he should still be rated as one of the top drivers on the grid.', 'I think he‚Äôs pretty incredible. He can make a slow car fast for a lap better than almost anyone. I CANNOT wait to see him in next years car.', ""It's not possible to judge a driver accurately by reading through his results on Wikipedia.
