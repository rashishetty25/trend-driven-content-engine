I guess working for Haas really prepares you for the grind."", ""There's something very amusing about that specific photo choice of Hulk celebrating being used to represent him still having a career."", 'Heres to Hulk getting a podium.', 'Yeah, people forget but Haas has been the team where careers (in F1) go to die, not just drivers but mechanics, management, everyone.\n\nI remember one of their driver (I think Magnussen?) mentioned on DTS that Haas is like the “family” team, people don’t tend to move to other teams once they are at Haas. Of course he meant it endearingly but it goes to show other teams probably don’t poach from Haas very often.', 'Hopefully, Bearman will be the second', 'Well theres a reason for that.\n\nTraditionally bottom teams did not have access to drivers like Hulk. \n\nI would call Hulk an upper midfield driver from a talent perspective and bottom teams simply did not have access to that. In the past those drivers for the most part had better offers, Hulk finished 7th in the drivers standings in 2018, so you can imagine he wasnt awfully interested in the Haas offer he got in 2019 to join them in 2020 because he thought he was better than that and took a year off (which turned out to be 3 years off) and wait for better offers. \n\nMagnussen being a tier below Hulk was sort of the best driver a team like Haas can possibly hope for. Somebody faster than the cars pace, somebody whos a known quantity and isnt so fast that other teams would have any interesting in him. in that sense kmag was the perfect driver for Haas. If Haas somehow got their hands on a faster driver, he would likely get better offers which is what happened here with Nico, altho Sauber/Audi is a long term project ofc and not an immediate upgrade. \n\nMany drivers in bottom teams are plenty worse than Kmag, some of them paydrivers because bottom teams obviously didnt have great finances as F1 used to be one huge positive feedback loop which changed in recent years with the budget cap, so if Kmag cannot get better offers and Kmag beats a driver in the same car, you can imagine that no other team will be interested in whoever is kmags teammate. If Mick for instance beat Kmag, hed still be in F1 today and likely in a better team than haas. \n\nCircumstances favored Haas and credit to Gunther because 2 years ago due to Mick underperforming, Gunther took the risk of signing an upper midfield driver. Now it was a risk because Hulk had been out for quite some time and hes not exactly the youngest anymore. Plenty of drivers lose their talent by that age and fall off a cliff straight into retirement. \n\nWhy did an upper midfield driver accept a contract from a bottom team? Circumstances. Hulk was waiting for a better offer after the Haas one in 2019 which he officially rejected due to salary demands not being met but inofficially he obviously wasnt too keen in joining a bottom team. Being this many years out is career killing, from hoping for a good contract to hoping you get any offer at all, Hulk probably made peace that his F1 career was about to end due to a lack of interest from teams, until that Haas offer. I remember during the years he wasnt driving full time, he participated in a GT3 practice and it was evident that he hated those cars and really missed F1. Regardless, he showed that he still is an upper midfield driver and with a lot of experienced driver quickly leaving the sport, he finds himself in that position he is right now, a teambuilder, probably the best possible driver for that role. Lewis was never awfully enthusiastic about the technical and strategic side of the sport while Alonso isnt awfully enthusiastic about driving a shitbox. And the next youngest driver I believe is Sainz and much younger.\n\nNow a lot of things have changed the past few years. First off the budget cap and a thriving F1 now has effective negative feedback loops that allowed bottom teams to catch up in terms of resources, one reason why Haas signed Hulk is because Haas no longer needed paydrivers. If you look at Williams the past 15~ish years, they loved their paydrivers, some seasons they even had two of them, many they had one and 2025 sees a year with Williams having zero paydrivers. \n\nOn top of that we have an explosion of young talents which makes upper midfield drivers suddenly realistic signings for bottom teams. It is no longer unique, I would consider Ocon an upper midfield driver, most of the time at least and he is now at Haas. Sainz is at Williams and Nico is obviously now at Sauber. Bottom teams never had such talented drivers as right now. Its an exciting development because it slowly leads to an overall closer Formula 1. Like, Haas was never going to achieve much with mazepin and schumacher but with Nico or Esteban? On a good day, a freak result is possible even with a subpar car. \n\nThese are exciting times in my opinion, the budget cap has done wonders to the sport and we may just enter a new golden era of F1.', ""I would also say he is the best driver Haas ever had.

1j646yd,Ferrari and HP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j646yd/ferrari_and_hp/,2025-03-08, Discussion,"How effective is this advertisement, really? It’s clear that Ferrari fans aren’t happy with it—at least when it comes to the livery. The backlash online has been immediate and harsh, with many longtime supporters of the team feeling like the iconic Ferrari aesthetic has been tainted by the sheer size and placement of the massive HP logo. The bright blue and white branding clashes in an almost comical way with the classic Ferrari red, making it feel less like a seamless integration and more like a last-minute corporate sticker slapped on for maximum visibility—at the expense of the car’s elegance.

But beyond the visual offense to Ferrari fans, does this kind of sponsorship actually work? Who is seriously looking at this F1 car, seeing that huge HP logo dominating the sidepod and the uniforms, and thinking, “You know what? I was about to buy a MacBook, but this just convinced me to go with an HP laptop instead.” Is there a single consumer out there who will make that connection? Formula 1 sponsorships make sense for industries like automotive, energy, or even luxury goods—things that align with the sport’s image and audience. But HP? It feels like a forced marriage, one where the branding is so aggressive that it actively pushes fans away rather than drawing them in.

Instead of subtly associating HP with cutting-edge technology and performance, this approach just makes them look like an intrusive corporate entity barging into a space where they don’t belong. The logo isn't sleek or tastefully incorporated—it’s just there, loud and unavoidable, like a pop-up ad you can’t close. If anything, it’s making people more aware of how out of place it is, which seems like the opposite of what good advertising should do.

Mission accomplished."", ""People can't seem to stop talking about HP, so I think it's pretty effective"", 'If you’re willing enough to write a college paper on HP, it seems it is working.', ""Wait, people care about this? I couldn't even tell you where it is on the car lol"", 'Jesus why would you give your opinion on the internet if you cant even write it yourself', 'Hi HP marketing team!', 'Was this written by ChatGPT?']",0,45,0.13,0,39,39,0,2,-0.03,0
