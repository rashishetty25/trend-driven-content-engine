1mhccb8,Alex Brundle's theory on Leclerc's Ferrari problem at Hungary,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mhccb8/alex_brundles_theory_on_leclercs_ferrari_problem/,2025-08-04, Technical,,"['The pace drop-off was shocking.

This was an amazing weekend from them, and one that I have been waiting for quite some time for them to have! The fact that the track fits with the high downforce setup paid off immensely\n\nQualifying saw them being consistently quick in a one lap pace, maximising their time efficiently to go out and set great laps *(the one from Alonso at Q3 stands out for me)*, and then effectively slotting themselves in good positions, given the limitations of overtaking in Hungary\n\nAlonso, in particular, keeping everyone at bay to conserve his own race was fantastic.

It might not be the wild race we are expecting from a sly fox like him, but it is the race he needed to maximise the points that he could for the weekend\n\nStroll, as well put in some really fine laps during qualifying. He also pulled the tyre degradation management off very well well, which is a feat when factoring in the bit where he was on scrubbed tyres in the dirty air.

But it's also pretty apparent that McLaren as a team are going to prioritize getting both cars as high as possible this year--even if that doesn't necessarily make the most sense for a driver in terms of the WDC fight.\n\nHeck, Silverstone wasn't that long ago, and they were pretty open about how they would have double-stacked during a safety car despite Oscar's penalty to preserve the one-two. It doesn't surprise me that they would be more focused on trying to get ahead of Charles than making sure they're covering Lando in 4th.\n\nNow whether or not they'll be able to keep that mentality as the season goes on is another thing."", 'Is it really impossible for some folks to comprehend that what is deemed as the best strategy can sometimes play out in the opposite manner, while fortune favours the bold in a twist of circumstances? Is it also impossible to comprehend that strategies being played out completely straight, especially when drivers are in the middle of a championship battle is not the most ideal, providing that the aim is to provide fair opportunities for both drivers to go for the title bid? It has always been in McLaren\'s best interest to let **BOTH** drivers fight, instead of prioritising one over the other. And given the gap has been consistently lesser than the amount of points the winner of a Grand Prix would get, it will be the stupidest thing to do. \n\nSome of the takes surrounding McLaren and the strategies executed by the garages of both drivers have been absolutely asinine over the past year, but this weekend is simply exceptional based on the aftermath of the vitriol that I have stumbled upon. The situation that has played out yesterday was incredibly reminiscent to Spa 2024, where the driver with nothing to lose, given the circumstances of his race up until that point, chooses to go onto a lesser-suggested strategy and manages to make it work. What is believed to be the better strategy eventually did not unravel in the way that is expected. Stuff like that happens in Formula One, similarly to the weight of luck in races and well-timed strategies. It happens. And some folks should be open into accepting that it is a thing, rather than drum up baseless conspiracy theories of their own. \n\nFor the record, this race was a blast to watch for myself. Both of them had me on the edge of my seat as they maximised their points and took home the good haul to set up a fantastic final stretch for the season between their fight.

1mhyrn9,How do this season's constructors compare now that we're half way through?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mhyrn9/how_do_this_seasons_constructors_compare_now_that/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"Obviously McLaren have the best car this year, but it seems so hard to judge outside of that. The Aston Martin seemed like a tractor and then suddenly had both in the top 7. The Red Bull appears to (have) been capable of winning races for the first third of the season, while the second car can't get inside the top 15. The Merc also seemed competitive for the first third of the season.

The RB has been consistently able to be just inside the top 10 with three different drivers. The Sauber is a tractor that both of its driver's have been able to drive into the top 6. The Ferrari seems all over the show, the only vehicle that seems consistently shit is the Alpine, but even then Gasly has had it inside the top 10 a few times. 

So, given all that, how are we ranking them? I guess taking an average across the first half of the season I'd say:

1. McLaren 

2. Mercedes? This felt like an easy pick up until the last three races

3. Ferrari? Again, so all-over the place that it's hard to assess this car

4. Red Bull - It has been competitive at times in the hands of a generational talent, but worst on the grid while Yuki/LL have been piloting

5. Aston Martin - Stroll has been in and out of the points all season in the AM, and lately Alonso has been accumulating even more points than Stroll in it. Hungary in particular it was strong

6. Racing Bull - Doesn't have the pace to compete at the top, but is reliable and has been consistently in the 8-12 placings

7. Williams? - Has shown the ability to have pace, but has also been inconsistent despite having two very good drivers

8. Sauber? - Everyone labels it a tractor, but it has been on the podium and has scored points under both drivers

9. Haas - Seems harsh as it has scored points under both drivers hands too

10. Alpine - Gasly has regularly taken it into the points, but both second drivers have struggled to drive it out of the bottom quarter.

  
What are your feelings/rankings so far, I'm interested to see and have something to talk about while I wait for the Netherlands :)","['Tie between Mercedes and Ferrari as there have been races where one has been clearly better than the other.\n\nAnd I would order the middle and lower class of the grid like this: Williams, Aston Martin, Sauber, Haas, Racing Bulls & Alpine', ""I personally believe that a car is only as good as its fastest driver. With that in mind, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd rank the teams based on overall pace in the first half of the season:\n\nMcLaren ‚Äì No notes. \n\nMercedes ‚Äì It‚Äôs been pretty tight between them and Red Bull. They‚Äôve both taken turns being the second or third fastest team, occasionally slipping to fourth if Ferrari shows up. But on average, I‚Äôd give Merc the edge.\n\nRed Bull ‚Äì Pretty much the same story as Merc. I know there‚Äôs probably a case for putting them fourth and I get that. I think that argument mainly comes from the gap between Max and Yuki. But like I said earlier, I‚Äôm judging based on what the car is capable of, so I‚Äôm giving weight to the fastest driver.\n\nFerrari ‚Äì Similar vibes. Flashes of performance, but just not consistent enough to crack the top three. They've been better in the last couple of races though. So, that could very well change.\n\nWilliams ‚Äì Reliability‚Äôs been a pain, but in terms of raw pace, I think they‚Äôve been ahead of the rest below them.\n\nRacing Bulls ‚Äì Quietly solid. They've been around the points more often than not, and haven‚Äôt had the wild ups and downs that Haas or Sauber have.\n\nAston Martin ‚Äì They started the season off terribly, but they‚Äôve finally begun to find some form. Curious to see if they keep climbing.\n\nHaas ‚Äì Bit of a toss-up between them and Sauber, could go either way.\n\nSauber ‚Äì They‚Äôre picking up lately, which is nice to see.

And we super sensitive tyres that change their performance with just a change of the ambient temperature by few degrees kelvin. \n\nSuddenly Mercedes is the fastest car in Canada, only to go for a spell of mediocre results for Russell and terrible results for Antonelli. Suddenly the Williams finds itself nowhere, only to be somewhere the next race. The drives to P19 and starts from the pitlane only to start P5 next race. \n\nIn the past these up and downs of 0.5s of lap time due to a fitting track did make you jump like 2 or 4 positions maximum. Now you jump halve the field. Hitting the tyres gives you another 0.5s compared to teams that miss it. \n\nMy current order is: McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull, racing bulls, sauber, Williams, Aston, Haas and Alpine. \n\nThe order 10 races ago might be quite different.
