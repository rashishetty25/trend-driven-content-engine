1ov4dx7,How likely is it that we see a struggling McLaren in 2026?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ov4dx7/how_likely_is_it_that_we_see_a_struggling_mclaren/,2025-11-12, Technical,"Since the season is almost over (both in terms of results and in terms of races) I thought a bit about the next season. With the new regulations coming in in 2026 there will probably be some shuffling in performance between the teams. What I wonder specifically, is how this will affect McLaren.

As we all know, one of the advantages of making your own engine is that the architecture and general construction can be adapted to the kind of car your team wants to build. Now, I assume (maybe wrongly), that the engine freeze from 2022-2025 also more or less locked in the architecture of the Mercedes engine, allowing McLaren to eventually overtake them in performance.

So I wonder (and I hope there is someone more technically versed than me), if there is a chance that the new Mercedes car goes into a different direction than the McLaren and that the McLarens will struggle (at least in the first season) to come to terms with the new engine.","[""As likely as it is for any team. Mercedes was a top team in 2021 and almost won both championships, yet in 2022 they got the regulations wrong. There's no certainty as to which team will actually nail the new rules."", ""Isn't Mclaren have some kind of special relationship with Mercedes? Like they are not a simple customer iirc"", 'Imagine if somehow ferrari builds a rocketship 😭🔥', 'Gasly did an instagram live last night with Canal+. It was in french, so hasn’t been picked up by much media.\n\nHe said there are teams that are going to struggle massively purely due to the engine (but wouldn’t disclose which) - and he also said that from what he understands the Mercedes engine is absolutely the benchmark.\n\nSo I think it’s extremely unlikely that McLaren struggle. Maybe they’re not going to win again, but if Gasly is right they’re not going to struggle.', 'Idc, I just want Ferrari to have a competitive car next season...😫', ""My guess is we don't really know until the races start and we'll see who has found the best ways to implement the changes."", 'In the first half of the season the story was that the Merc engine was very strong. Then later, there were rumblings that Ferrari\'s engine was good, then Ford, and now former Alpine workers hired at Ferrari are apparenly ""shocked"" at how poor it\'s performing. Point is we won\'t know until testing ends and teams qualify for race 1. And even then, the strongest package can be the least reliable. \n\nSo will McLaren be struggling? To use Max\' odds here: 50%. They either will or they won\'t. That makes next year so exciting.', 'Obviously, no one knows until the cars hit the track in Australia, but i feel like in addition to them having the Merc engine and being a semi-works team due to the deal they made with Mercedes on that, another thing they have going for themselves is whatever they are doing with development/wind tunnel/correlation has been absolutely working for them for the last 2+ years. I think someone made the point on here that McLaren haven’t brought an upgrade that failed to perform as expected (if not better) since at least the beginning of 2023 . Compare that to Mercedes who tossed their suspension upgrade at the end of the summer because it wasn’t working or Red Bull who have struggled a bit with nailing their upgrades as of recently.', 'It’s impossible to know but McLaren has done really well with upgrades since they got their new wind tunnel up and running. I think we can expect a competitive McLaren next year based on how the last two years went. Rumors of Merc having the strongest PU will help as well.', 'Its a new rules set with a new motor.\n\nAny team could struggle or he excellent.\n\nEspecially true for customer teams.  If Merc.

""F1 prize money: How much do teams earn in the Constructors' Championship?

The team that secures the highest position in the Constructors' Championship receives the largest share of prize money, and the team in 10th place receives the least.

McLaren is estimated to have [received approximately $161 million](https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/f1-prize-money-how-much-do-gp-teams-and-drivers-really-make/) – an estimated 14 per cent of the prize pool – for securing victory in the 2024 Constructors' Championship. 

Last-placed Sauber, meanwhile, took home $69 million.

Prize money constitutes just one aspect of revenue generation for the teams as significant income streams also stem from sponsorships, merchandise sales, and commercial partnerships.""

There are some significant changes to regulations and everyone is pretty much starting from scratch. My bold prediction is that Aston Martin will make a big leap with Newey at the Helm.

Maybe even an unorthodox design like mercs zeropods.\n\nReliability is going to be a mess, so I expect every team to score at least a few points, maybe we’ll even see a few new grand prix winners.\n\nNewey is a ground effect genius, but we are going back to flat floors, with wheelbase and rake being highly regulated. Honda engines also have a reputation of being a bit of a wildcard.\n\nI don’t expect Cadillac to hit the ground running but with solid drivers that Perez and Bottas are they might end up in the midfield mix. Somewhere around Williams.\n\nAs for drivers, the next year is going to be important for this year’s rookies, especially Antonelli and Bearman. With whatever is happening in with Scuderia lately they might put their names on the map.', 'Russell vs Norris vs Piastri for the WDC.\xa0', 'Williams will be closer but still will be too far to consistently podium. Aston will be the exact same. Cadillac won’t be as bad as people expect.', 'Its ALL on the engines. I suspect they will settle out on along those lines, so its just a matter of who nails it.\n\nThe rumour is Merc nailed it, so McLaren and Mercedes should be the favourites. Williams and Alpine could hugely benefit and be top ten contenders, at least for a while.\n\nFerrari are Ferrari, they rarely get it totally wrong, so I suspect they will be second tier next year behind and overlapping the Merc runners. Haas should be behind them, then Cadillac.\n\nAston are likely to have a great chassis since Newey rarely gets it totally wrong, but the question is the Honda Engine. If its good they could be top ten regulars.\n\nRed bull are having to make their first fully non-Newey car, it could go either way, and their engine will be all new from scratch with no IP from the current engine. VCARB will be behind them but the engine dictates where. Where they both fall is anyone guess, they could be contenders or backmarkers, no way to know.\n\nAudi are the dark horse. They arent stupid, they know how to win racing series and they have Saubers experience, but their is no way to know where they are.', 'Red Bull are actually good with the PU and win the opening race.', 'Stroll 26,27,28']",0,99,0.49,0,384,384,0,0,0.0,0
