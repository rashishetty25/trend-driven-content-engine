1odel9t,Norris is a particular bad starter: the numbers,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1odel9t/norris_is_a_particular_bad_starter_the_numbers/,2025-10-22, Discussion,"https://preview.redd.it/67gqcyy45pwf1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=19074f8c188fdf5639e61217cb9199d328c08e0c

When Norris starts from the front two rows he loses an average of 0.65 positions, the worst among top drivers in recent memory. He’s also the most likely to lose positions (40% of races vs Max at 16%) and the least likely to gain (10% of races, vs Max at 28%).

Note that this analysis only considers starts from the front two rows, which naturally biases the results toward losses (since there’s more room to move backward than forward). Even so Max still manages to gain positions on average. Alonso And Leclerc also perform strongly across these metrics.

**Methodology:**

* \~15 years of data analyzed
* Only races where the driver started in the front two rows
* Lap-1 position changes capped at ±4 to limit the impact of outliers

Edit: [updated](https://i.imgur.com/EGQQaUO.png) with data back to '96. Mark Webber hahahaha!

Tsunoda hasn’t really been helping Verstappen or Red Bull strategically this season – there’s been no teamwork when it could’ve mattered.

There’s literally nothing to lose.

It could actually be a win-win situation:
1.	Talent evaluation: Red Bull gets to see how Hadjar performs under real race pressure.
2.	Strategic upside: A hungry rookie might be able to snatch a point or two from McLaren.

Lawson also did poorly in his first 2 races in the RBR, but is also doing well in the Racing Bulls - that car is fast and easy to drive.\n\nNo point in running Hadjar's confidence, putting him under more pressure (considering he is supposed to help Verstappen) and I don't think he will be that much of an upgrade. \n\nAlso, considering that Honda paid for Tsunoda to be in that seat....

It’s not worth potentially floundering Hadjar for a couple more points which they aren’t guaranteed. \n\nDon’t forget that Yuki probably would be doing much better if he was in the VCARB instead of the RB21. I think out of all the options Red Bull had, promoting Yuki was the best option for this year. If you look at Checo’s form at the end of 2024 it’s very similar to Yuki’s performance save for a few outliers. It was mostly 10ths or lower or DNFs with a few decent positions spattered about.
