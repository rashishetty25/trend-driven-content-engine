BUT,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ityyp4/drive_to_survive_made_me_a_fan_but/,2025-02-20, Discussion,"I (31M) as a kid was too young to understand F1, but I always watched the Hungarian Grand Prix (because I'm from Hungary) when Schumacher was still active. However, in 2021, I got back into the world of F1 through the Drive to Survive documentary, which my girlfriend (now wife) introduced me to. The 2024 season was the first one we watched live together, and it was an incredible experience. I got hooked on F1!

So much so that I started watching retro races from the 2000s, where Michael Schumacher won his first championship with Ferrari. Now I'm at the 2001 season, where he started breaking old records one by one (he secured his 49th victory at Nürburgring, which is where I’m at). Even though I know he will go on to win four more consecutive titles, it's still a joy to watch the battles between him and Mika Häkkinen, Kimi Räikkönen scoring his first career points, and Rubens Barrichello taking his first-ever win at Hockenheim. It's never too late to be a new fan of this sport.

All this is just to say that while the overly dramatized Netflix-style storytelling and fan culture may not be for everyone (the F1 75 was sometimes painfully to watch) without Drive to Survive, I wouldn't have gotten so deeply into the world of Formula 1.
I love this sport and I just wanted to share it with all of you. 😊","[""I don't believe in gate keeping so whatever brings more fans into the sport I am all for.

As long as you enjoy it that's all that matters."", ""I do appreciate that DTS opened the door for so many to become a fan of the sport, but I don't appreciate how artificial it can feel once you do start exploring all the nuances and getting yourself up to speed. \n\nI understand it's for entertainment, and it does a reasonably good job of it, but I feel like if your F1 documentary largely depends on its viewers being uninformed or turning their brains off, it doesn't succeed at being a documentary."", 'Hey DTS got my wife to go from groaning whenever I turned on F1 to actively following the sport and watching races with me, so it will forever have my appreciation for that.\xa0', ""I've been watching F1 since Lewis Hamilton walked on to the grid so I'm watching it already a long time and I do enjoy Drive to Survive.

1itwzxz,All the race suits scrutinized,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1itwzxz/all_the_race_suits_scrutinized/,2025-02-20, Discussion,"What the title says. Purely subjective of course, but I found last years McLaren diagonal split orange/black design to be incredibly unflattering to even these highly trained athletes, so seeing them stick with it made me scrutinize all suits.

Race suits ranked:

Kick Sauber 5/10
Incredibly simple, their graphic designer is paid by the hour and this is what they could deliver.

Haas 6/10
This is a good suit, harkening back to the Haas maverick glory days, but also doesn't take much risks, hence a conservative rating.

Williams 6/10
An average suit and they get the extra point for incorporating the yellow name tag. It's a fine looking suit, but also doesn't provide any iconic feature. 

VCARB 6/10
By all means an ugly suit imo, but I appreciate how they incorporate the cashapp green. It's different and sort of recogniseable, which I appreciate but let's not get too excited, it's still in essence as exciting as a 2007 puma teamwear football jersey. 

Alpine 7/10
For whaf they're working with this is their cleanest suit of the BWT years imo. They do themselves no favour by not just simply going all pink. Matching the black/blue alpine vibe with BWT's pink will forever be a middling at best look. In light of that 7/10 is as high as they could go. 

Aston Martin 7/10
They made only small changes but it's a clean suit with some detail.

Mercedes 5/10
Now this is harsh, but I had to punish the stripes on the legs that look like they're wearing boots, in a bad way. The adidas stripes make sense but ended up too thick and look clumsy. Remember that I'm a self-declared expert. 

Red Bull 7/10
Never change a winning team (too much at least). I appreciate how they make small changes every other year to give some indication of what year we're in once we look back at Max' dominance in a few decades. It's not their best, tho. 

Ferrari 5/10
In the grand scheme of Ferrari suits it's ok. Better than 2022 & 2023 but worse than 2024. I thought they'd go a bit iconic/classier for Hamilton's arrival, but they just regurgitated last year's with a somewhat oddly weighted white stripe on the leg to balance the white on the car I presume. Feels rushed. 

McLaren 4/10
I can understand why they hold on to a WCC winning car livery, but the race suits? C'mon give the poor boys a break. In their defense, their race suits have been bad since they dropped the blue ones in 2022. The diagonal feature irks me so much. Why?? It's not even curved so we could say - oh! it's the mcl logo sort of?! No it just seems like a stupid design idea that will not age well and now we have it for another year. 

Making a nice race suit with orange and black/gray colors should not be too hard. ","['You missed Alpine and Ferrari.', 'I guess Ferrari and Alpine do not provide race suits for their drivers? Bottas would love that.', 'Thanks for letting me know', 'It’s a race suit, its only focus is to protect the driver as much as it can.
