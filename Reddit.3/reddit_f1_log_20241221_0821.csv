Maybe one of your guys had the random idea of a double diffuser while showering and you look like a genius for a season. But what he says about Sauber completely losing sight of the present definitely tracks. They made big leaps in the final fifth of the year:\n\n>""When I joined in August, really, it was like a team that was almost frozen,"" added Binotto. ""So while making sure that we had the proper plans in our journey to become a top team in the future, we really needed to boost the team for improvement and possibly already during the current season.\n\n>""How important the current season was was not only about not finishing with zero points, because finishing 10th with zero or 10th with four points does not change much.\n\n>""But it was more for us to make sure that we have defined the proper direction of development for next season as well – and being energised through the wintertime.\n\nI agree that you have to keep the tension to improve every season because otherwise when ""your year"" comes you won\'t have the right processes to compete. Strategizing long-term is of course the main job of Audi in their position, but you can\'t ignore continuous development and the meaning of fighting (even if it\'s for random points) because you will grow a culture of passivity.', ""To everybody who usually only reads the headline read the interview, its a really good and insightful one.\n\nToto Wolff once said that success in F1 is all about the long term. You cannot be an impatient team. Binotto saying Audi isnt winning championships before 2030 must have been tough to hear for Audi but if Audi agrees with Binottos assessment, that's at least something going in the right direction because too much priority on the short term and you end up as Aston Martin or Alpine and never make it to the top.\n\nAs a Hulk fan, the 2030 number hurts. Makes his podium all the less likely. Although Binotto is making sure there are already improvements this season and the next. I mean that Sauber in the last 3-4 races was reasonably fast and got them their first few points. And he doesnt talk much about 2026 because he knows the team isnt at a point where it can design a winnint car despite new regulations.

Not at all, because we will not have the people in place, we will not have the facilities in place and all the tools required.\n\nSome really good insight by Binotto here. Sounds like Seidl took the same approach he did at McLaren which led to them underperforming until Stella took over.', 'I am more surprised by the lack of sims and measurement for wind tunnel data. How can the previous management who focus on longer term doesn’t think those need development?

They need to hire veteran aerodynamicists and engineers in addition to graduates, from F1 or Airbus or whatever, it’s freaking hard F1', ""Seidl was always highly regarded but to be honest his work kinda looks bad in hindsight. Seems like he didn't do much in Hinwil except hiring his underperforming buddy James Key and his other buddy Nico Hülkenberg to a multi-year contract until he is over 40 years old. Don't get me wrong, Nico is a great driver but signing a driver into his 40 is always a huge risk unless your name is Alonso or Hamilton.

To illustrate how unreliable cars could be, literally anyone else who completed 75% race distance got 4. 5 for those over halfway, 6 for quarter distance and 7 for lining up. Wake up late? To encourage participation, absentees or disqualifiers got a full 8 points. \n\nThe table shows how that might look today. To be fair, it's not an awful way of determining the top eight.

1hirou1,Rwanda’s F1 Bid: Should the plans go ahead?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hirou1/rwandas_f1_bid_should_the_plans_go_ahead/,2024-12-20, Discussion,"On paper, the Rwandan proposals sound fantastic: a state-of-the-art circuit in a stunning location, with a fast, flowing nature. It would be a refreshing contrast to some of the lifeless, run-off-laden tracks we see today.

But as exciting as this sounds, I can’t help but feel sceptical. Rwanda would have to build everything from scratch—not just the track but also grandstands, transport links, and all the infrastructure required to host an F1 event. This is a hugely expensive undertaking, and F1’s track record with new venues (think India and South Korea) doesn’t inspire confidence. Both countries invested heavily in new tracks, only for the races to disappear from the calendar after just a few years.

There’s also the sustainability angle. F1 has ambitious net-zero goals, but building a new circuit in Rwanda, when options like upgrading Kyalami in South Africa exist, raises questions about how serious the sport is about its environmental commitments. Wouldn’t working with an existing venue be a more responsible choice?

At the end of the day, Rwanda’s decision to pursue this project is their call. But F1 has a responsibility too. If the sport greenlights this project, it needs to ensure the plans are viable in the long term—not just a flashy but short-lived investment.

What do you think? Should F1 prioritise a return to Africa no matter what, or should it focus on sustainability and long-term viability?","["">There’s also the sustainability angle.

Plus, I didn't realise construction is bad for the environment."", 'no reason the sustainability angle would apply more here than anywhere else, and just because some venues failed to be successful or long-lasting doesnt mean new ones shouldnt be built. plenty of successful venues built in the modern times as well. so your points to me are largely moot.\n\nthe real questions about it to me are the humanitarian and funding questions. i am not familiar enough with the country to know much about it, but on a glance looks like a country with great amounts of poverty among other issues. so that seems like where some potential actual moral questions lie.\n\nthen again, how much does F1 care for all that?', ""A return to Africa would be great but I just don't see Rwanda as being close to the best option.\n\nThis is a country that's 33rd in GDP in Africa. They have other things they need to spend money on rather than this."", "">Wouldn’t working with an existing venue be a more responsible choice?\n\nThat's assuming that the existing venue is being responsible. There have been multiple attempts to get Formula 1 to return to South Africa over the years, and all of them have failed. There have been problems with funding, with the ownership, with local politics; at every possible roadblock, they have run into a problem that they cannot resolve.\n\n>F1’s track record with new venues (think India and South Korea) doesn’t inspire confidence. Both countries invested heavily in new tracks, only for the races to disappear from the calendar after just a few years.\n\nThat's a bit of a misrepresentation. The Korean Grand Prix fell apart because of the Global Financial Crisis. Formula 1 was trying to lure Hyundai into the sport, but the recession his Hyundai hard. The decision to build the circuit in Yeongam was based on the expectation that there would be more investment in the region -- compare the Shanghai circuit in 2004 to the circuit today and you'll get a sense of what they were aiming for -- but with the economic downturn, the investment never materialised.\n\nAs for the Indian Grand Prix, the sport got caught up in a taxation dispute between the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments. The circuit is technically in Uttar Pradesh, but it was sold to audiences as being in Delhi because the circuit is practically on the boundary between the two regions. The Uttar Pradesh government felt that they were on the hook for all of the expenses, but Delhi was the one getting all of the benefits. They reclassified the race as entertainment rather than sport because that would allow them to tax the teams directly, although they never actually intended to do that -- they were just trying to force the Delhi government to back down."", ""No because I don't care for F1 going to Africa when it contributes nothing to F1. If they wanna throw money at it to make it happen then let them, but it doesn't deserve to get a place for any other reason."", 'Construction is definitely bad for the environment. Anything that relies on fuels and materials that hurt the environment is bad for it.', "">on a glance looks like a country with great amounts of poverty among other issues. so that seems like where some potential actual moral questions lie\n\nI always find this argument to be deeply flawed. The implication is that Rwanda should not have a Grand Prix until such time as they address the issue of poverty. How, exactly, are they supposed to do that? There is only a finite amount of money circulating in the Rwandan economy, and programs to eradicate poverty are expensive and take lots of time to begin with. There is a very good chance that if they poured every single Rwanda franc that they have into a poverty eradication program, then they'll still come up short. So this becomes less a question of the ethics of hosting a race in a developing country and more about making sure fans and competitors are comfortable with where the sport is going.\n\nConsider this: it will likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build the circuit. Where do you think that money is going to go? Sure, some will be spent on hiring the architects who design the layout of the circuit and the facilities, but most of the money is going to be spent on acquiring materials, renting equipment and hiring workers to actually build the venue. That's money that's being injected directly into the local economy as well as creating jobs. When the Rwandan Grand Prix takes place, people will likely be flying into the country to see it, which means that they're going to be spending money on food and accommodation and injecting more money into the economy. And when the race is broadcast to the rest of the world, the government is no doubt hoping that investors will see that this tiny African nation has a modern developing economy, is able to complete a major infrastructure project and organise a global sporting event, and that that will be enough to convince foreigners to invest in Rwanda.\n\nBut no, we're so hung up on the ethics of having a race in a developing nation that we're apparently not willing to have a race there."", ""Rwanda is most well-known for its genocide, but it's made great strides in the 30 years since then. They don't have any worse human rights issues than any other country at the moment."", "">They have other things they need to spend money on rather than this.\n\nWhere are they going to get that money from?\n\nActually, now that I think on it, here's something that they could do: they could host a major international sporting event and use that to attract foreign direct investment -- the kind of sums that they will need to address these issues -- by showing their country to be a modern economy. This will be especially helpful because, judging by a lot of the comments in various threads on a race in Rwanda, most people only really know that it's a small, somewhat impoverished country in Africa that went through a genocide thirty years ago.\n\nAnd do you know who else had this idea?\n\nThe Rwandans!"", 'What do you think the other tracks contribute to the sport that the continent of Africa would not?

1hiygpa,American F1 fans share their thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hiygpa/american_f1_fans_share_their_thoughts/,2024-12-21, Discussion,"**Now that the dust has settled on the 2024 Formula 1 season, we’ve firmly entered a time of reflection — and, as F1 continues to pursue an American audience, it’s time to ask if the sport is on the right track.**

To find out, we spoke with 23 different American fans about their experiences with Formula 1 and their hopes for the future. Some fans rode the Drive to Survive wave into a new fandom, while others had been dedicated F1 viewers for decades. Though all felt the 2024 season was deeply compelling, these fans raised some critical points about the growth of F1 in America.

[https://www.planetf1.com/features/what-american-fans-want-formula-1](https://www.planetf1.com/features/what-american-fans-want-formula-1)","['I can’t even read the whole thing without being bombarded with ads I can’t close… but this stood out to me…\n\n*Most of the fans I spoke to expressed their desire for an F1 broadcast dedicated to the American viewership experience. Doing so would allow for a kind of “translation” of F1-specific racing terms into a more general language designed to attract the ever-growing slate of American fans, and would also do wonders in making those new fans feel more at home.*\n\nWhat the fuck? I’ve never met anybody who wanted F1 translated into “American”… F1TV provides everything, digestible enough for noobs and comprehensive enough for longtime fans. Maybe I should be glad I can’t read the rest of the article because I’d just get more annoyed lmao', '*“F1 has priced itself out of the market and is now an elite sport that only elites can afford,” he said.*\n\nThis is something FOM is comfortable with, their revenue is strongly linked to promoter payments and promoters who are forced to pay more have to charge fans more (excluding the state sponsored ME races…).\n\nI would suspect FOM sees attending a race as akin to attending a Super Bowl, a one off, very special event, that is expected to be expensive whereas watching on TV is the ‘norm’. I don’t think FOM sees attending a race like a football/soccer match would be, where frequent attendance is planned.', ""As an American F1 fan, I have a lot of thoughts on this article.

But then conversely, the Americans are just as guilty trying to create the show (see nascar). And I find the point associating the lack narrative of the season (why sauber desperately needs points) and a full-American coverage is questionable, I'm pretty sure the narrative is pretty well-articulated (maybe overwhelmingly to the point of being annoying)"", "">*Americans are perceived negatively*\n\n>“I have always thought F1 has the attitude towards America of ‘this is our product, we are better than your racing, take it or leave it,'” our aforementioned motorsport professional told PlanetF1.com.\n\n>“This dates back to when F1 came to IMS and wouldn’t credential local media. There were reporters who covered 20-30 Indy 500s and weren’t allowed into the gates for F1.”\n\n>Another common theme among the fans we spoke to was the feeling that F1 was treating American fans with disregard.\n\n>“I have noticed that European F1 fans tend to look slightly down on American fans, at least online,” a fan named Mandy told PlanetF1.com.\n\n>“I’ve had more than one tell me there shouldn’t be any US F1 races since we have IndyCar — which is nice, but it’s a different sport!”\n\n>A fan named Preston agreed, pointing out that he feels F1 is trying to appeal more to entertainment fans than motorsport fans, to the detriment of American fans.\n\n>“[F1 doesn’t] seem to think we are ‘sophisticated’ enough to appreciate the technical ability or the amazing travel that happens with the sport,” he said./div>\n\n>Another fan, Jessica H., argued that “There is an attempt at showmanship that is incredibly basic, and a clear indicator that the F1 corporation doesn’t understand their audience [in America].\n\n>“You can really see that with their attempts to bring in celebrities and influencers. People don’t care about them, especially if they haven’t previously expressed a sincere enjoyment of F1.”\n\nThis is pretty much 100% spot on"", '“It’s time for an American f1 broadcast” \n\nNO!!!!!!!!
