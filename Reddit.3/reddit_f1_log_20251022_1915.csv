We have three all time greats (Max, Hamilton and Alonso), a few drivers that with the right car could be at least multiple time WC (Leclerc, Russell, Piastri and Norris), a midfield packed with race winners, consistent point scorers and future race winner drivers, and one of the best rookie class we've ever seen. Arguably the worst drive in the grid, Stroll, already has 3 podiums and 1 pole. 

If we think that not so long ago we had paying drivers like Latiffi, Mazepin, Sirotkin and so many others, and that in the early 90s almost half of the grids were paying drivers of this level, I can't think of a season that had a better grid. Not saying that it couldn't be improved of course, but how much better could it be?","[""Every generation is better than the generation before. Before Schumacher, most racing drivers started in the early teens. Today everyone on the grid was racing karts since around the time they started primary school if not before. They've gone through years of development and training, and get specialist support to hone their fitness and reactions. The standards just get higher.\n\nEven recent pay drivers were better than the pay drivers of the past. All three of those you mentioned won things at the level below, and managed to do enough to get the needed Superlicense points. We used to get drivers who were just rich playboys having a jaunt.\n\nSo, yeah, this is probably the best grid in history. It'll soon be beaten."", '2012 grid was the best by far.
