The new US racing team will replace Ferrari\'s customer engines with its own powertrain starting in 2029. We reveal how far the project has progressed.**\n\n> Things are moving fast at General Motors. On March 7, the new US racing team, operating under the Cadillac flag, received FIA approval to compete as the eleventh team in the Formula 1 World Championship starting in 2026. Exactly 47 days later, the International Automobile Federation gave the project a second green light. General Motors Performance Power Units will be allowed to compete with its own engine starting in 2029.\n\n> This gives the American dream a face. For the first three years, Cadillac will still be using Ferrari customer engines. Then, the heart of a US engine will beat in the two factory cars. It\'s an ambitious project that will be built in a newly built factory in Charlotte over the next three years. The factory is scheduled for completion this year and will be equipped with ten state-of-the-art test benches from the Austrian specialist AVL.\n\n> FIA President Mohammed bin Sulayem takes pride in the success story: ""Over two years ago, the FIA \u200b\u200bapproved the addition of an eleventh team to the Formula 1 World Championship, guided by my vision to expand the field with new talent. While the process has been challenging at times, the progress we have made demonstrates that it has been worth the journey. It is another step in the sport\'s global expansion and underscores the growing interest from world-class automakers like General Motors.""\n\n> **Greatest possible challenge.**\nGeneral Motors has set itself the most difficult task imaginable for its entry into the engine market. Instead of waiting for the next regulatory cycle starting in 2031, the Americans are investing heavily in an engine concept that may only last for two years. The technical challenge of the drive system has never been greater than with the regulations that will take effect in 2026 and remain in effect until 2030.\n\n> Manufacturers are faced with a V6 turbo that must run on climate-neutral fuel and a significantly higher proportion of electrification. Whether the planned 55:45 power split between combustion engine and electric power will be maintained will be discussed at a meeting of the Formula 1 Commission on Thursday (April 24).\n\n> The mere fact that Ferrari and RB Powertrains, two of the five engine manufacturers currently in the field, are pushing to reduce the electric component, at least in racing, demonstrates how difficult the task is. With General Motors\' approval, the rebel club gains another member. Anything that reduces the complexity of the drivetrain helps a newcomer.\n\n> **First engine to run in summer.**\nThe team led by engine boss Russ O\'Blenes has ambitious plans. They must first focus on designing a powertrain that meets the current rulebook. They can\'t rely on backroom politics for success. Just as the attempt to switch to a ten-cylinder naturally aspirated engine by 2029 at the latest has already failed. Mercedes, Audi, and Honda reject this.\n\n> General Motors had already been preparing to build its own engine before final approval. Single-cylinder tests have been underway for some time. The first prototype of a six-cylinder turbocharged engine is scheduled for completion this summer. The project is now subject to the budget cap for engine manufacturers.\n\n> Each newcomer is granted three years of development time. GM is subject to the same limits as Audi between 2023 and 2025. In the first two years, GM is allowed to invest $105 million each in the development of the powertrain. In 2028, this will be reduced to $100 million, but in total, $25 million more than the established manufacturers such as Mercedes, Ferrari, and Honda were granted. Once the engine is in use, a limit of $130 million per season applies to all.', ""GM isn't a stranger to making race motors."", 'Wish my dad was still here.

1. While on average, everyone is finishing lower than their quali (DNS, Ret etc. skewing the results), those starting P12 are frequently finishing P11 (probably due to the P11 ret curse). 
2. Exactly 50% of races were won from P1, really showing that clean air advantage. 
3. With the exception of Max's killer 2024 Sao Paulo Grand Prix (P17 to P1) all wins were from individuals starting P1-P5. Shout out also to Charles on his P19 to P3 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

[FIA Deputy President Robert Reids Resignation Statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jvtyw4/robertreidwrc_fia_deputy_president_robert_reids/)

In [today's post on his Substack](https://robertreidwrc.substack.com/p/time-on-my-hands) he makes some comments that jumped out to me:

>(...)

>In motorsport, we could do more here. We have legends, incredible figures whose stories shaped the sport. But too often, we focus only on the now. We race forward, literally and figuratively, without stopping to look back.

>Imagine a formal way to recognise past champions at key events. A way to connect generations. A way to remind everyone, drivers, fans, organisers, that what we do stands on the shoulders of those who came before. That history isn’t a weight, it’s a foundation.

>(...)

>Motorsport has always faced the challenge of governance, across series, regions, and levels. That’s a conversation for another time (and one I plan to return to). But it’s worth noting that strong leadership doesn’t have to mean rigidity. It means purpose. And when that purpose is clear, whether you’re running a golf club or a world championship, the sport benefits.

>(...)

>Motorsport can feel global but disconnected. Fans don’t always feel close to the sport, even when they’re passionate about it. The sense of intimacy is sometimes lost in the noise of the big show. If we could make events feel more felt, more human, I think we’d find new ways to build loyalty, storytelling, and belonging. That’s not about making everything smaller. It’s about making everything matter more.

>Stepping back from day-to-day responsibility has allowed me to reflect more freely on the sport I’ve loved for a lifetime. Watching the Masters this year reminded me of what great sport can feel like when it’s confident in itself, quiet, precise, meaningful.

>Motorsport has so much going for it. Incredible talent. Iconic events. A truly global reach. But sometimes, to move forward, it helps to look sideways. To see how other sports create meaning and how we might do the same.

It's too soon to assume he will be a FIA presidential contender in December, but when reading all this, I still hold out some hope.
