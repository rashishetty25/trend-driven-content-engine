1n6i3d2,Let's look back at Vettel's penalty in the 2019 Canadian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n6i3d2/lets_look_back_at_vettels_penalty_in_the_2019/,2025-09-02, Discussion,"A bit of context for all you whippersnappers who joined F1 during the 2021 season. 2019 was built up as the year of Ferrari. All the preseason testing all pointed towards Ferrari being THE team to beat during the season. What we actually got was Mercedes being as dominant as they've ever been. Every race up to Canada has either been an easy Mercedes 1-2, or a race where Ferrari shot themselves in the foot (Bahrain and Canada). Yes new viewers, we were all making fun of Ferrari before 2022.

The Canadian Grand Prix was one that many were enjoying during the race, mainly because as long as Vettel didn't suffer an engine blowout like Leclerc did in Bahrain, he would win the race. Unfortunately during the last ten laps or so, Vettel made an error. He went off the track, onto the grass, and rejoined the track in such a way that Hamilton had to brake in order to avoid a collision.

This resulted in Vettel receiving a five second penalty. A penalty that resulted in Hamilton and Mercedes winning yet another race. At this point in the season, none of the races were won by a different constructor, and Canada was only the second race where P2 wasn't Bottas.

I suspect this played a large hand in the massive backlash over the decision to give Vettel a penalty. Not just online, but the Sky F1 pundits, Channel 4 pundits, TV personalities, it was a wildly despised penalty. This led in turn to the FIA introducing a yellow card like system, where drivers were basically let off with a warning if they committed minor five second penalty offenses. This meant that certain driver on driver duels such as Verstappen v Leclerc at Austria and Hamilton v Leclerc in Italy resulted in the winner forcing a driver off the track and getting away with it, so the FIA quietly reverted back to the old way of doing it.

Personally speaking, I believe the only way Vettel doesn't deserve a penalty is if you don't believe that Hamilton was allowed to take the standard racing line at standard racing speed whilst Vettel sorted himself out, and nowadays the backlash has softened massively. What do you think of the penalty? Are you still mad about it?","['>2019 was built up as the year of Ferrari.\n\nLike every year, really.', ""What's the point of this thread?
