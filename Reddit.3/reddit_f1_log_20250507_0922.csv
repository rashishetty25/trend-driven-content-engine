1kg24st,2025 Miami GP - Day After Debrief,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kg24st/2025_miami_gp_day_after_debrief/,2025-05-06, Day after Debrief,"Welcome to the Day after Debrief discussion thread! Yes, we know we're a day late...

Now that the dust has settled in Miami, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""The RB21 performance varies so much from track to track it's insane... Max was on par and maybe even faster than Piastri in Saudi and here he was 8 tenths slower."", ""I am as disheartened as everybody else to see Ferrari going back into the disorganised, lost figures of themselves in the team, but in my opinion, demanding for Fred Vasseur's exit from the team is simply absurd\n\nDating back to when Luca Di Montezemolo destabilized the Holy Trinity of Ferrari itself, it seems that the team is unable to find middle ground with their values and the prospects to win on certain aspects in a cultural sense. Whether it is the unwillingness to break out of traditional norms to take risks in exchange for chances of winning or the organisation of the fold crumbling under pressure, changing team principals on a constant basis will not solve the problem at hand, especially since Vasseur was the man who narrowly led Ferrari to the top, had it not been for the middle stretch of the races. There is a case to be made with Binotto, but constantly being in the cycle of  shifting, blaming and replacing would only send the organisation back to square one, and fumbling over themselves\n\nThat being said, I also believe Vasseur needs to iron these issues out if Ferrari wants to salvage the rest of their season. Miscommunication between drivers and engineers are not the most unheard of, but for it to be a recurring theme is insane. Neither Leclerc nor Hamilton had adequate pace to catch Antonelli, and they barely kept Sainz at bay in a car believed to be much weaker than theirs. The issue that the drivers are figuring out the car's strengths and weaknesses, and trying to salvage what they can with its characteristics is concerning at this stage of the season. By changing the car's philosophy *(which I get the reasoning but I wouldn't have particularly been on board with)*, the gamble did not pay off well\n\nWith the race where they can bring upgrades coming in, I hope they find something. If that doesn't work, then I can only hope Vasseur would use the time and his efforts to fix the team. It will not be easy, if my understanding of Ferrari's rigid rules are factual, but if the team wants to win, then the bigwigs really need to consider these aspects first before anything. A lot of Ferrari's future is on them"", 'Interesting race that would have become a melee if it had actually rained.\n\nOscar seems to have better wheel to wheel racing instincts than Lando while Lando seems to optimize lap time in clear air better than Oscar. Looks like this year is going to be a battle between which teammate can learn the others skills more quickly in order to grab the WDC.\n\nFerrari remain a baffling mix of good and bad things. Their car needs development and strategy department needs a full overhaul. The pit crew is really good though.\n\nRed Bull, Merc and Williams seem to be the ones vying for the second best car at the moment. Maybe one or more will find an upgrade that will allow them to take the fight to McLaren.\n\nDirty air seems to still be a very big issue for following cars, lots of drivers complaining about it on radio.I doubt it will get any better this year, hopefully next year with the new regs there will be noticeable improvement in this area.', 'From my second time attending this race (or any F1 event) in person:\n\n1) Turn 18 is a better spot to sit than turn 12. Glad I tried something different this time but I’d do another spot before sitting at the ‘beach’ in Miami again. \n2) But, my vantage point made the gap in the field even more outstanding in the last third of the race where Lando and Oscar would come around 11, 12 and 13 and disappear and their sound would disappear. Like… quiet on the track except for piped in commentary. Then came George and his sound would lessen and then Max and his engine noise dissipated and then… everyone else. The McLarens were just in a different universe. \n3) I recognize Max as an incredible talent and I’m a big Lewis fan but I also like having many winners and contenders so I think this year has been fun. I’ll be just as bored if McLaren walks away with all the wins  this year (could be likely!) than I would be if Max did it again or if we were in the Lewis/Merc dominant era . So, I like the dominance shifting and the fun that brings to us, the fans. \n4) Last for me was seeing Albon punching in the top third and every time I saw him go by I was impressed with his chasing of Max and then Ferrari. I like him and I particularly like Vowles and so I think it’s super cool to see Williams showing a spark and have a resurgence.', 'I think Miami as a circuit is decent, however, that stupid chicane into a tight corner has to go. So many times drivers got to 3-4 tenths behind the guy in front, just to lose a few tenths due to having to follow through there is insane. It just kills any battles through the middle sector.\n\nHopefully at some point before 2041 they change the layout', ""With the rumours of Doohan possibly getting replaced I can't help but feel sad for him. For some reason there is this huge ((social) media?) pressure on the rookies to perform almost instantly while veterans get their excuses for needing time at their new teams. It feels incredibly unfair towards the rookies."", 'Still don’t know why Haas left Ocon out for one more lap, as soon as Hamilton got around him at the hairpin he should have been in. Would have covered off Hadjar instead of being undercut. Would have had an outside chance of picking up a point due to Tsunoda’s penalty.', 'I think the reason Oscar was able to force a mistake from Max is that he has a proven history of being able to make a move stick around the outside.\n\nOscar has shown he can hang it around the outside on multiple occasions, so if Max defends the inside line into the corner he also has to go deep, allowing Oscar to switchback.\n\nLando kept taking the outside line but he won’t get the move done on the outside, which Max also knows. Lando kept trying the switchback instead of going outside so Max didn’t have to brake so hard and was able to carry more speed through the corner and keep the position.\n\nLando really needs to try something new when battling Max because it’s just so predictable and Max is completely in his head.', 'Someone should host a barbeque next to the circuit next time. Guaranteed rain then.', 'This is the first time watching Miami that I came away really impressed with the track. I love that you mostly had to use the long straight to force the car to defend and take a weird line into the chicane, and then have to nail those corners to get the chance to overtake into Turn 1.\n\nIt made the overtakes difficult and you had to work for them, but possible. It also made a great viewing experience to watch how the end of the long straight goes to see how far the leading car has to defend offline, and builds your anticipation for Turn 1.\n\nThe race settled down quite a bit after the VSC as the cars were mostly sorted in order of performance, but the Lando/Piastri/Verstappen battles was probably my favourite part of this season so far.']",40,145,0.86,40,777,777,-6,3,-0.030000000000000027,-6
