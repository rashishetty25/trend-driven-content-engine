On the one hand, it allows teams to integrate the FIA\'s intervention into their early season development cycle, with a circuit like Barcelona often the scene of big upgrade packages in the past.\n\n> On the other hand, some smaller teams who haven\'t fully caught on with flexing front wings feel like the delayed change bakes in the advantage of those who are at the forefront of a practice the FIA clearly sees the need to clamp down on. And while not forcing teams to make changes from race one can be seen as a way to help teams by not having them throw away carryover designs, some of those midfielders will actually have fewer changes to make than the likes of McLaren and\xa0[Mercedes](https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/), and therefore would have benefitted more from a clampdown right from the start.\n\n> How much will this affect the teams, and the 2025 title race?\n\n> That depends on who you ask, but one senior team source called the change ""proper"" and was adamant the teams involved - which along with McLaren and Mercedes is also believed to include the likes of Aston Martin and\xa0[Alpine](https://www.motorsport.com/team/alpine/24858/)\xa0\\- will have to make significant changes in order to comply, not just to the front wing but also to the all-important floor as the front wing design impacts anything downstream.\n\nSome interesting bits here from the article that claims Red Bull wasn\'t surprised about the change, while the senior team source they heard from suggests that McLaren, Mercedes, Aston Martin, and Alpine will be the most affected by this. \n\nI do worry that this midseason change could affect the championship, and I just hope if there is any effect caused by this it ends up making the championship closer for multiple teams rather than widening the gap like the midseason TD did in 2022.', ""They should apply this rule to all new front wings, but all teams must be in compliance no later than Barcelona. I understand not forcing flexi-wing folks not to make a new wing for Day 1, but if you're developing a new front wing, it better comply with the new regs."", ""I can't wait for The Race to parrot all of this info but worse"", 'At least there is a lot of excitement to see what happens from Barcelona onwards, whether it was important to make hay in the first races or if nothing really changes.', ""> significant lobbying from some teams who had already developed flexi-wings to delay the introduction of the new test, initially until Imola and then until Barcelona.\n\nIf this was mid season, I would understand (good example being clamp down on oil burning in 2017), however this has been discussed for quite some time if I remember correctly. It's ridiculous to postpone it until 1/3 of the season is done. You went into a grey area of the rule book, it got slammed, deal with it. You took the risk, got some advantage out of it, now you gotta move on."", ""This is horseshit. The rules are not a grey area to be interpreted at will depending on who's leading the championship and how strongly people lobby."", 'The change itself is not the issue. The timing is.
