1ls2kgt,Let‚Äôs speculate possible driver changes for next year,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ls2kgt/lets_speculate_possible_driver_changes_for_next/,2025-07-05, Discussion,"So, let‚Äôs assume Max goes to Mercedes. That would be the first piece to fall in a long domino train, in my opinion. What are the possible changes in your opinion?  
  
I believe these are the only logical moves:    
  
Max -> Merc  
Russ -> RB  
Hadjar -> RB  
Limblad -> RacingB  
  
I don‚Äôt see Stroll being asked to leave. We always expect that move but we know it‚Äôs daddy‚Äôs team and won‚Äôt happen.   
  
I believe Audi doesn‚Äôt need to change Hulk/Bortoletto. They are finding their way to the top.   
  
Lando/Oscar: If it‚Äôs not broken don‚Äôt fix it.   
  
Thoughts? What are your theories or scenarios?  
  
Edit to add:  
I don‚Äôt know what the real deal is with Ferrari. Lewis is always sad/disappointed and his engineers screw him over all the time. And Leclerc being anxious he can‚Äôt win a  championship. Not sure if this situation will also trigger more moves. ","['I hope Stroll retires.

However, we do know that there was some contact between him and Horner in the past (but he turned Horner down).\n\nSince around April, we've repeatedly heard about Toto's intention to re-sign him which has led to some interesting quotes. In an interview around a month ago, George said that 2026 would be his 5th season with Mercedes only to be reminded by the interviewer of the lack of contract. In Austria, Toto said that the talks with Max had no impact on the talks with George, and this weekend, George has repeatedly suggested being teammates with Max and said that Toto never lied to him."", ""I cannot see GR to RBR happening for the simple reasoning being that you don't replace your outgoing driver with the driver he's replacing.
