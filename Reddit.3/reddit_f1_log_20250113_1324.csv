Given how well attended it is I wonder how they are losing so much. I always wonder how places like Rwanda aim to make any money at all.', ""Me and my dad have been coming to Spa for almost 35 years now, only missed 2 F1 races due to family stuff (not counting the 2 times where it was excluded from the calendar in the 00's). Spa has the most beautiful scenery for any GP you could ever visit. However, Spa has the worst overall experience you could have at any GP.\n\nThere's the issue with getting there, parking, going to the circuit. It taking 45 minutes to an hour to get out of your car and walking to the circuit on badly managed roads is already bad. But imagine when it's raining, you're standing in the middle of a patch of farmland which you need to pay 30 euro for (if you're lucky), sogging away into the grass. Then walking to the circuit over a mud-ridden road. Coming to the circuit there are way too few entrance points, so the crowd takes a long time to enter the circuit. The experience greatly varies (as with all GP's) whether you have gold, silver or bronze tickets. Food and drink prices are crazy, on some spots on the circuit it's a long walk to either a food or drink vendor and there's thousand of people pissing all over the place because of toilets being either too far away or way overcrowded. \n\nYes, Spa is the most beautiful race you will ever visit with it's nature and track scenery. The sound of the engines (today much less so than the 90's and 00's) roaring between hills of the Ardennes forest is A-MA-ZING. But you better come prepared. Take a decent raincoat with you, prepare for +25 and +5 temperatures with your clothes. Be aware that the sun can be very bright and you'll burn easily. Prepare to walk, A LOT. And if you want to leave the circuit, just wait, wait until almost everyone is gone. Because if you're parked more closely to the entrance of the circuit, you'll probably have to wait at least 5 hours before you can leave with all the traffic going out at only one spot.\n\nReason I'm writing this up is because the news that the track is making a loss doesn't surprise me. Spa has done very little the past 3 decades to make the track more appealing in terms of accessibility, entertainment, modernization. It very much is a relic at this point, but of course it should still be on the race calendar. But where tracks like Silverstone and Barcelona have had upgrades in terms of the fan-experience, Spa has done very little, at least imo. \n\nDoesn't mean we're not going to go each year it's on the calendar of course, it's only a 3 hour drive and with my dad's age you never know which year you're going together for the last time."", 'Spa needs to really look at why it‚Äôs losing money. I‚Äôve been to Spa, and when you compare it to Silverstone (which turns a profit) there‚Äôs a few key differences:\n\n1. They do not charge enough for certain seats. I sat at Eau Rouge - Gold 3 - and trust me when I say it‚Äôs one of the best seats on the calendar, looking down the hill and some of the most on the limit driving happening in front of you. It‚Äôs a covered grandstand with its own toilets underneath which you can only get into if you have tickets, with its own food outlets underneath. This is a luxury in european F1 terms. Charge more for this and similar stands - they are worth it because they‚Äôre more luxury than anything aside from hospitality at Silverstone. GA? No, don‚Äôt increase that. But Gold 3, Gold 2, Gold 8? Up that price.\n2. They make it incredibly hard to spend money. Why do I have to buy a card, go pay to top it up, and then your range of food I can buy with it is basically fries, terrible nachos, and crap burgers? They had me taking tupperware down to hotel breakfast to pack my lunch because it‚Äôs not worth it. Something Silverstone does really well is turning the place into a festival feel, there‚Äôs a variety of food stands and not having this card shit made it super easy for me to go and impulse buy a korean corn dog, or gyros, or a massive belgian waffle, and Silverstone got a cut of those profits. What‚Äôs easier to buy - a load of cheesy chips for ¬£6 where I can just use my phone contactless, or a load of cheesy chips for 3.7 spa coins where I have no clue what that is in real money and have to go find a stall to top it up.\n3. They don‚Äôt seem to understand how to manage the fan stage. They have almost all the driver interviews in a single day, with everyone packed in there, and then nothing. So that central area with the most food stalls and merch stalls is very full at one point and then basically empty and not making money. Silverstone spreads the interviews through the weekend, so people are repeatedly drawn to the biggest money making zone of the track.\n4. Their extras are a bit shit. When I went you had the option to request a ‚ÄòVIP lunchbox‚Äô but it was a bit of crudit√©s and cheese. Nobody can be arsed with that in the pissing rain and definitely not for ‚Ç¨50.\n5. Blocking routes for people with Bronze tickets is shit and inconvenient. It makes people with bronze tickets not feel like coming again, rather than making them think ‚Äòfuck, I loved Spa, maybe I‚Äôll go for a Grandstand next year‚Äô.\n\nSpa is excellent. The racing is good, the fans are friendly, and the staff work really hard - it‚Äôs incredibly clean, they‚Äôre friendly, they‚Äôre a credit to the track. But it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve stuck someone who‚Äôs never been to the race in charge of fan experience.\n\nAnyway tirade over, enjoy the view that they didn‚Äôt charge enough for:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmnsfcjwiqce1.jpeg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2217048b3625136822d22001c983b0c4115d5afb', 'Grim reading.', 'Can/does FOM pay Historical tracks type of heritage bonus they pay to Mclaren,Ferrari etc?', 'Australia loses about $100M a year iirc.

1hzx8er,I‚Äôm a brand new F1 fan for 2025. I don‚Äôt know where to start.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hzx8er/im_a_brand_new_f1_fan_for_2025_i_dont_know_where/,2025-01-12, Discussion,"I‚Äôve been a fan of cars and car racing ever since I played Gran Turismo on my PS1, but I never really gave watching the sport a shot. I know the basic rules for the season, but there are some concepts, I guess, that I don‚Äôt really understand.

- How do you, as a fan, determine if a team‚Äôs strategy is good/bad? I keep seeing videos pop up titled things like ‚ÄúFerrari keeps messing up‚Äù. Besides the obvious like forgetting a tyre for a pit stop, how do you discern if a team messed up or not during the race itself?

- Is it possible that one car is so much faster than the others? I remember seeing a race from 2024 where Max Verstappen won by like 20 seconds, which sounds insane. Is the Red Bull car really just that much better than the other cars? Or is this all down to the driver/strategy?

- What should I watch for, as a new fan, to maximize my enjoyment out of a race? Are there any specific storylines/rivalries I should look for in 2025? I know Lewis Hamilton moved to Ferrari, were there any other big moves that could impact the season?","['In brief!\n\n‚Ä¢ some strategy calls are obviously bad and you‚Äôll hear commentators say so. Many others are a gamble that looks bad when it doesn‚Äôt pay off. Hindsight is strong. Bad strategy is down to things like wrong tyre choice at the wrong time, but a lot of these things are affected by luck. \n‚Ä¢ yes, one car can be that much better if one team gets a design element right that others missed. Good car combined with great driver tends to lead to the kinds of gaps you‚Äôre talking about.  \n‚Ä¢ an interesting thing to watch this season might be that there is a relatively high number of new drivers, which is often interesting, and also some interesting team changes.\n\nI think the Sky commentators, on the international feed, are pretty deliberately beginner-friendly tbh and they are obviously mindful of explaining rules and procedures to new viewers. It‚Äôs easy to start watching and learn as you go along. \n\nHave fun!', 'Strategy:\n\nBest way is simply to see if it worked. Strategy in F1 is primarily based around pit stops and tires, at least the strategy we are pivy to as viewers. Putting on the wrong or non optimal tires can completely ruin a drivers race and the tires are specifically made to degrade fast, so if it goes wrong you will start to lose a lot of time. But the best thing to do is just to watch the commentators will break it down for you.\n\nCar performance:\n\nA car can easily be 20 seconds faster than another over the course of race. F1 is an engineering series where a big part of the challenge is creating the best car. But the driver is also quite important as well. In 2023 Verstappen had the most dominant season in the history of the sport, he won races with 40 seconds down to second place, who was his team mate in the same car.\n\n2025:\n\nWell, there\'s always a lot of storylines to watch out for, you need to find out what you care about. If you haven\'t I would recommend watching Drive to Survive on Netflix. It\'s a bit over dramatic, but it is a good way to get to know the drivers and the ""storylines"" since 2018. And it is just entertaining. \n\nFor 2025 specifically there\'s 6 rookies coming in, the biggest number in a long time. So there\'s a lot going on there. In terms of rivalry, McLaren is the obvious one. Good chances there\'ll have the best car next year and their two drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, will stop playing nice and start having a true fight. The relationship was already starting to crack at the end of last year.', 'How about you just start to watch the highlights of all of last season‚Äòs races?\xa0\n\nIt will already explain a lot of things and will make you familiar with the teams and drivers.\n\nBesides that, most people here don‚Äôt have much knowledge about strategy and the technical side anyway. Me included.\n\nThe commentators are calling things out usually and some things are just obvious. E.g. if everybody pits but one car that is having worse and worse lap times stays out. Or wrong tyre choice. Etc.\xa0', ""I know people are trying to help here but, honestly, just watch the races and see if you enjoy it. F1 has a lot of soap opera aspects to it, but if you don't enjoy watching car racing then what's the point? \n\nNow if you enjoy watching the racing, then you can start to learn the nuances of the thing"", 'Watch drive to survive to understand, a lot of people are gonna talk shit on this but drove to survive is a great crash course on modern f1', ""Ferrari hasn't been THAT bad this season actually."", ""Once you have watched a few races and know basics, I'd seriously recommend watching chain bear so you can understand the race in a much detailed manner"", '1. Honestly it just takes time and experience watching to be able to intuit what strategy decisions feel right or wrong. Like another commenter said hindsight is very strong so risky decisions always have a bit of genius-if-they-work type things so when they go wrong there can be a lot of criticism. But you‚Äôll get the hang of it. \n\n2. Yes, some cars are stronger than others. If the car is WAY better, then a single team or driver can win a majority of the time (2023 is a good example). However, even with a dominant car it‚Äôs not always a given. There‚Äôs a lot that can go wrong and it‚Äôs not easy to put it all together with no mistakes weekend after weekend. Some races this past year were great examples where McLaren had the best car on occasions and struggled to convert to wins. Everyone is hoping 2025 is a bit like the second half of 2024 where it was unpredictable who‚Äôd show up with the best car each race. \n\n3. F1TV is the best broadcast (by far) in my opinion, however, I do think Sky has the best commentary for beginners. They tend to break things down more often (over cutting, undercutting, tire deg, strategy calls, etc.). To me, nothing can be beat Jacques, Palmer, and Coulthard on F1TV but they tend to not explain every detail so you‚Äôll have to choose. \n\nAs much as it can be made fun of at times, DtS does a good job going over the basics and introducing you to teams. Overall though I‚Äôd recommend just start watching sessions and races. You‚Äôll get the hang of it and over time you‚Äôll gradually gravitate to a team or driver and become a fan. It‚Äôs an addictive sport that‚Äôll hook you with time. Once you get hooked it‚Äôs hard to give it up. Welcome to the fanbase!', 'First of all welcome. If you\'re not an inherently toxic person, you will have difficulty understanding why some people do some things, for example - why some fans have to make every and any story about their favourite driver/team (this occurs more often than you\'d expect and you\'ll quickly realise which team I\'m talking about :D).\n\n\\- Strategy is heavily dependent on car performance - the better the car, the more VIABLE strategic options you have, the worse the car, the less POSSIBLY viable options you have and you\'re forced to take more risks. That\'s why dominant teams will more often get the strategy ""bang on"" and can afford to be reactive instead of proactive. Slower teams, almost always have to be reactive or do something vastly differently and have it work well in order to gain positions. You mentioned Ferrari, and I don\'t blame you. For what seems to be an eternity, they were always plague by ridiculous strategy errors to an extent where you\'d wonder wtf just happened. They\'ve replaced their chief strategist Ignacio Rueda at the beginning of 2023. and their strategy/communication problems have since been fixed. The few that did occur since then have been nowhere near as bad and were all the result of having to take more risks because of a slower car. Pit stop errors can be a result of bad communication where they mechanics are not notified in time, but often times it\'s just either error on the mechanics part of the equipment fails you which leads to slower pit stops or sometimes even DNFs. I\'ve used the Ferrari example but the general concept applies to all teams, it\'s just that Ferrari have been so disgustingly bad at strategies in the 2010.-2022. period it\'s ridiculous to an extent.\n\n\\- Yes, it is possible for one car to be mind blowingly faster than others if the circuit suits it and it\'s otherwise a dominant car. See most of the 2023. races to  get a good example - that year\'s Red Bull was a rocket with wheels. Same in the 2nd half of 2022. pretty much. Another good example were the Mercedes cars in the following periods 2014.-2016., 2019.-2020. In 2016., there was one race that after a safety car (all cars get bunched up after a safety car so it\'s sort of a flying start) - it took the Mercedes duo 2 or 3 laps to build a 7.5 second gap over the closest followers. That is some different racing series type of shit. Some of it comes down to driver and strategy but under normal racing and weather conditions, no more than 10% which is usually not enough. When it rains and is a circuit with difficult overtaking like Monaco, then the driver and strategy can make more of a difference, but largely the car will dictate how well a team performs at what circuit. That\'s where the predictions ""x team is supposed to be the team to beat at Y track"" come from. I will say though, since 2022., these predictions have often shown themselves to be wrong, especially in 2024. Lots of surprises in that way.\n\n\\- Too many things happened in 2024. to list them all here, there are articles that sum it up on most relevant F1 media pages. I would advise not to trust any media outright (british media are most often blowing things out of proportion, but others do it too, germans, italians, etc.) Always keep tabs on multiple different media pages and then the truth will often be somewhere in between. Good page to stay in the loop is Motorsport. Get the F1 app even though it\'s rubbish, it will give you breaking news when they happen, you can check the standings, race calendar etc.\n\nTry not to support drivers but rather teams, find a favourite one and go from there. Honestly though, you will have the most fun if you don\'t support anyone and just enjoy the racing which has somewhat improved since 2022. and the new ground effect rules came in. There is another rule change coming up in 2026. so 2025. is poised to be even better than 2024. which has been the best since 2010. because final year of rules always facilitates great competition for many reasons.\n\nI sincerely hope you enjoy :)\n\nEDIT: regarding strategy, I read someone suggested ""commentators will call out a bad strategy call"". I can\'t stress enough how often they misinterpret it themselves and then later act like it\'s some sort of revelation. Use commentators to help you identify drivers until you learn to do so yourself, nothing more. In time, if you\'re serious about sport and love racing, you\'ll see bad strategies outright by yourself 95% of the time. There is that 5% when teams mask what they\'re doing so well that it\'s hard to anyone from the outside to see it straight away.', 'Have you watched Drive to Survive on Netflix?\n\n1) Good or bad can be relative. I‚Äôd say good strategy is when a team takes a situation that is not ideal and turns it into a win or a podium finish. For example, if a driver qualifies in 10th due to an issue with their car, good strategy is pitting for new tires at the best times during a race based on weather or track conditions in a way that helps them move up to a higher position in the race. Bad strategy is when a team tries to pit based on the assumption that a safety car will come or a driver close to them in the race will perform a certain way but it doesn‚Äôt happen and your team is stuck pitting at a bad opportunity. Look up Max Verstappen‚Äôs performance in S√£o Paulo last year on YouTube to see good strategy and good driving. \n\n2) Some cars are faster than others. Some cars are faster but the drivers cannot handle the speed. Two examples: 1) Max Verstappen is very fast and had a fast car designed around him so he could be extra fast but his teammate (Checo) struggled with driving the car. 2) Lando Norris had the fastest car on the grid last year but couldn‚Äôt be the fastest driver due to pressure put onto him. \n\n3) Next year will be very interesting because there will be 5 rookies (6 if you count Liam Lawson). Lando is expected to put more pressure on Max Verstappen after a year of learning to drive his faster McLaren. Lewis and Charles Leclerc will be fun to watch. Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon will be interesting since they‚Äôre both good drivers in Williams cars (that are considered slower cars).']",28,64,0.65,28,53,53,-5,7,-0.039999999999999925,-5

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.
