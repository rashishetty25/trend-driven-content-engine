While Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko previously mentioned the team’s 2025 challenger needing a wider operating window, Wache explained the predominant issue was correlation: the CFD and simulator data did not match what happened on the track.\n\n“There are multiple aspects to that story,” the Frenchman elaborated. “The first one is the correlation, that the car had some different characteristics than what we expected in terms of aero.\n\n“Another aspect is that we didn’t expect some elements would affect the car performance as much as they did. They were not there by desire, but maybe we didn’t focus enough on them. Those elements were still there at the end of the season and we have to fix them for 2025.\n\n“We had a loss of downforce in some areas of the [downforce] map and therefore we didn’t perform on track as we thought we could based on the wind tunnel, so there were some holes. That is a correlation issue and in terms of delivery on track it was mainly a balance issue.”\n\nTLDR: Balance and aero issues', ""I'm not sure they made the fastest car in Qatar as he claims.
