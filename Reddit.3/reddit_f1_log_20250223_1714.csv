Have there been any prolonged upticks in form similar to Grosjean's second half of 2013?

It honestly still boggles my mind that on a grid with drivers like Hamilton, Alonso, Rosberg and Raikkonen that Grosjean of all people consistently outdrove them all in the back half of 2013 and was seemingly the only guy who could actually challenge the mighty Red Bull/Seb for wins. Was the 2013 Lotus really strong in the back half of the year, or was Grosjean in the form of his life outperforming every driver on the grid not named -ettel?

Edit: I'm probably underselling the Lotus' performance in the second half. For the record I do think it was clearly the second strongest car after the break, but that it wasn't *that* much quicker than the Mercedes and the Ferrari.","[""Lotus was the second best car in both halves of the season. Raikkonen was clearly better in the first half when the tyre management was absolutely crucial. After the change in tyres Grosjean's performance improved while Raikkonen's slipped back (although the saga with Lotus not paying him probably didn't help his motivation either). \n\nGrosjean was indeed performing at his best (although the next two seasons in a much worse car were also very solid), but I don't think he was the second best driver in F1 even in that period with Alonso and Merc drivers being better at the very least"", ""Lotus had the 2nd best car in 2013. Grosjean was driving decently in the 2nd half of the season and Raikkonen was underperforming a bit due to various issues (back injury, wasn't being paid). \n\nHowever, across 2013 overall, Grosjean was still the worst driver of the top teams."", '2013 Lotus was just a lot quicker than people originally thought. Same could be said as the 2012 lotus which I‚Äôm sure the engineers said that if Hamilton or Alonso were in, could‚Äôve challenged for the WDC. \n\nThe car was crazy quick and great on the tyres, it was unfortunately under driven by essentially a rookie Grosjean and a Kimi who was no longer elite from 2007 and who came from a 2 year break. \n\nCoupled with the fact that Kimi was destroyed by Alonso in 2014 and comfortably beaten by Vettel from 15-18 and it‚Äôs clear he was not a top driver. Grosjean himself was never amazingly quicker than Magnussen and I‚Äôd put them both in the solid midfield category.', ""That Lotus was very fast in the later stages. Grosjean finally stopped crashing and drove the car as he should have. Raikkonen's back caused him problems and he fell off a bit and missed a few rounds.\n\nGrosjean was still the worst or second worst driver in the top 4 teams."", 'IMO, Lotus was a very strong car from 2012-2013 but the drivers at the time were meh. He just had a purple patch and the car suited him + other teams were not as competitive.', ""It was great but it felt like in the second half or the vibes was at the time that pretty much everyone had waved the white flag and full focus was on 2014 especially when Seb was winning everything it didn't even feel like the drivers you mentioned were even giving it 100% imo."", ""Lotus brought a longer wheelbase car for Monza which Raikkonen didn't seem to get on as well with. That coincided with the car being very competitive at that time (not at Monza though). Raikkonen went back to the shorter wheelbase car for Abu Dhabi and was planning to keep it before he decided to miss the final two races for surgery. Raikkonen's performance relative to Grosjean also got worse when Pirelli changed the tyres too."", 'Perez in the second half of 2020 was so much better than in the first half and maximised the result nearly all the time.', 'Shame what happened to Lotus.
