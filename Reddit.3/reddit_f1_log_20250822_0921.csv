According to reports in the German press, the Argentine will not be staying on at Enstone in 2026, with Sergio Pérez and Valtteri Bottas being named as the main alternatives. However, the list of potential replacements does not seem to be very long.\n\nColapinto joined Alpine on loan from Williams at the start of the year. He began the season as a reserve driver and, after six races, replaced Jack Doohan at Imola.\n\nHowever, the Colapinto who impressed when he first arrived in Formula 1 with Williams is not the same driver we have seen at Alpine so far. It is true that the car has not helped him; he has had to contend with one of the least competitive machines on the grid. It should also be noted that he did not participate in pre-season testing or the first six races of the year.\n\nAlpine have expressed dissatisfaction with Colapinto's performance from Imola to Hungary, prompting them to reconsider the Argentine's future with the team. According to the German website AMuS, Franco is in serious danger of losing his seat for 2026.\n\nThe publication states that Colapinto's time at Alpine will end at the end of the season, but he still has ten races left to change the team's mind. They don't have many alternatives, and the names of Pérez and Bottas have been mentioned again.\n\nIn Bottas' case, the Dutch press reported yesterday that he had signed with Cadillac to return to Formula 1 in 2026, meaning he would not be an option. Pérez is also well positioned to drive for the American firm, although there is currently no agreement in place.\n\nThis could make him a real option for Alpine to replace Colapinto, although the French team does not seem to have many alternatives. They have Paul Aron, their current reserve driver, but he would be a similar gamble to the Argentine driver. According to the test times at Monza in March, Franco was consistently faster than Aron.\n\nWith just a week to go until the return of Formula 1, the Silly Season is heating up once again after Max Verstappen confirmed that he will be staying at Red Bull until 2026.

1mwmhfo,Finally got round to watching the F1 movie today (me being a seasoned F1 fan),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mwmhfo/finally_got_round_to_watching_the_f1_movie_today/,2025-08-21, Discussion,"And I will go as far as saying it's woken up something in me that's been lacking between me and motorsport these past couple of years. 

I've been a bit down on the sport in recent times, a combination of not finding the racing as fun as I used to, of being ground down by DTS-focused media coverage and the shitty football-style fan factions. Having followed the sport for 40 odd years and spending a lifetime's fortune watching and reading it, I was getting to the point of jacking it all in.

Yet I watched this today, expecting another cynical Liberty money grab, and I was delightfully surprised. Sure, it's a movie and must be taken as such. But it is a very good movie. The best I've seen this year, and I watch a hell of a lot of movies. 

I felt, at one point, that the use of Martin Donnelly's accident was crass. But I am thrilled they sought him out and had his blessing. I didn't expect to see the special thanks dedicated to him at the start of the credits, and this put a little tear in my eye.

And then, very early in the credits too, seeing Craig Dolby down as a stunt/driving coordinator made we leap with happiness. He deserved so much more from his racing career and I am thrilled he is so highly thought of in this field. Craig, if you're reading this, well done mate. It makes a change from driving lorries at Tenerife Airport! 

In short they made F1 look great which it really is. Sure, it had buxton in it (ffs), but even that low is irrelevant when compared to all the highs. It's an 8 out of 10 for me, Clive.

1mw9qp4,Which F1 season did you find to be the most boring?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mw9qp4/which_f1_season_did_you_find_to_be_the_most_boring/,2025-08-21, Discussion,"I'll offer my suggestions over the topic

**2013:** People often say that 2013 was amazing in the first half and boring as hell in the second where Vettel won everything with only Grosjean of all people coming remotely close, but that second half of the season was such a drag.

It didn't help that Webber had no answer to Vettel's race pace. He occasionally out qualified him, but he never beaten him to the win once in the year where the Red Bull won every race in the second half of the season. I remember begging and praying for rain in that time so that something interesting would happen, but if memory serves me correct, the only wet session for the remainder of that year was a single practise session in Brazil. A practise session that Red Bull topped anyway, so it probably wouldn't have made any difference.

I know people always say to focus on the midfield when the same person is winning all the time, but the racing in the midfield wasn't any good either for the most part. The biggest culprit for this were the tyres. Way too many races this year had massive stints where the drivers were simply trying to nurse the tyres to safety. I remember the American grand prix in particular was aggravating as it felt that all the racing halted so that the drivers could all parade around managing the tyres.

**2015:** I will now provide a list of everything I remembered from this season:

* Rosberg throwing his cap at Lewis after he won the title.
* Vettel winning at Malaysia.
* The Hungarian Grand Prix.
* Mercedes' pace vanishing in Singapore
* Felipe Massa's duel with Felipe Nasr in Canada

That is it. Max Verstappen debuted in 2015, and I can't remember anything he did.

  
**2016:** This was supposed to be the year where Ferrari really took the fight to Mercedes, there was so much hype around the Mercedes vs Ferrari battle prior to Melbourne, and then Ted Kravitz says this. *""Ferrari reckon the reason why they're not catching Mercedes, is because Mercedes is simply better than them.""* I will never forget the disappointment in his voice when he said that.

But it was the midfield racing that cemented this season's spot here. Manor being at the back was the norm, but Sauber were just as bad as them this year, and Renault too weren't much further ahead of them. Haas were good in the first half of the year, but were nowhere in the second, not to mention that Gutierrez didn't score any points at all.

Probably not the worst season in F1, it had its moments, but the gaps between the cars were still way too big, and too many teams we want to see fighting for points were simply unable to.

**2020:** I'll admit that a lot of the races in 2020 were fun to watch, but I would argue that they were fun to watch because this year had plenty of chaos. If it didn't rain or if somebody didn't crash, the actual racing itself wasn't that great. People remember the first Silverstone race for Hamilton somehow winning on just three wheels, but tend to forget that the race was pretty dull beforehand, and this was not the only case of this happening.

One of the biggest disasters this seasons had was Ferrari dropping back massively, which meant that only Mercedes and Red Bull (Max) were at the front. People joke about this year being HAM BOT VER for a reason. No one could catch them, let alone beat Hamilton. Only eight races the entire year didn't have that podium lineup and none of them were based on genuine pace.

But I think the biggest problem with this year was with just how one sided the teammate battles were this year. Lance Stroll vs Sergio Perez was genuienly one of the closer team battles, because Hamilton thrashed Bottas, Verstappen thrashed Albon, Leclerc thrashed Vettel, Ricciardo thrashed Ocon, Gasly thrashed Kvyat and Russell thrashed Latifi.

2020 season, fun for chaos, boring for actual competitive racing.

**2023:** Red Bull were ridiculously dominant all year long, and Verstappen crushed Perez into the dirt. It didn't matter what upgrades everyone else brought, none of them worked in the slightest. It got really tiring after two races, and honestly the one race Red Bull didn't win (Singapore) wasn't a particularly good race, and really Las Vegas was the only one where Red Bull even had to fight for it.

Not every race was terrible, but I'd argue that none of them were exciting, mainly because that there was never any competition for Red Bull. It was cool to see Aston Martin and McLaren make a step forward, but all that really did was make it less likely for everyone else to score points.

Another thing to point out this year was that every single driver was kept for the exact same team for 2024. There was no transfer at all. No discussions, no rumours. As boring as 2013 got, at least the transfer gossip was fun.

**My own thoughts:** Personally since watching F1 since 2012, the most bored I've been with it was the first half of 2024, but once the Red Bull domination ended, it was fun to watch. For me the worst has got to be 2023, simply because of how nothing the whole season ended up being, but if 2013 started how it ended, it would've been number one instead, simply because of how bad the actual racing got at times.

Then again I barely remember 2015 at all, so maybe that's the most boring?","['2002 - Shumi won it in the 11th round in France, finishing the season with double the points of the secondo who was Barrichelo in the other Ferrari.\n\nFerrari won 15 out of 17 races...', '2023 Verstappen won 19 of 22 races and RB 21 races in total', '2015, with 2013 not very far behind. \n\n2020 was interesting because of the covid track chaos and just general weirdness. \n\nThe silver war in 2016 made it very interesting imo, the tension was palpable most races.\n\nAll subjective of course.', 'How could you include 2016?

The Ferrari returned to front row competitiveness in 2006, so what on earth happened in 2025?","[""They changed the tyre rules so you couldn't change your tyres during the race, and from memory also had to qualify on these tyres."", ""regulation changes that were designed to slow down ferrari and advantage the michelin tyre runners, in the process improving the racing by reducing the dirty air effect.\n\nthese included changes to the front and rear wings, the diffuser, and the introduction of a rule mandating that engines had to last for two race weekends, instead of manufacturers dumping new engines in each race.\n\nhowever, the biggest change was the rule surrounding tyre changes. the FIA literally made it a rule that you were only allowed a single set of tyres for qualifying and the race, meaning you weren't allowed to pit for tyres unless there was a puncture or rain started to fall.\n\nthis encouraged the usage of harder compounds which massively favoured the michelin runners, in turn screwing over ferrari who used bridgestones."", 'F1 introduced some of the dumbest rules ever.', 'They changed the tyre rules so that you had to do the full race on one set. That rule was 100% made to stop Ferrari/Bridgestone’s dominance, and it worked.', 'Short answer: FIA', 'Besides the one tyre rule, Michelin and Renault also started to work closer together and sharing their knowledge for both tyre and car suspension design. \n\nThis collaboration started to shine in 2005', 'There were both Bridgestone and Michelin tyres. \n\nGenerally speaking, Bridgestones were faster, but didn\'t last as long. (Nothing much faster, but maybe a tenth or two in exchange for shorter stints) Michelin tended to be more race pace over qualifying pace. Bridgestone also specifically built for Schumacher/Ferrari, so by this point only the Jordan/Minardi were on them as well, the rest were on the more ""Fair"" michelin.\n\nAs usual with rule changes, the fia want to nerf the best team. They tried to find ways to make the Ferrari itself slower, but they were just better everywhere that they did themselves. So the only thing left? Something out of their control. Tyres. \n\nMichelin were better at longer runs in general, so they thought to play to that strength, and to them the best way was to use one set for both qualifying and the race. It worked, Ferrari won once, because Michelin screwed up and they all pulled out.\n\nThe aero did also change, but it didnt majorly affect much for Ferrari, they were still nearish to the front and in races the tyres worked properly, they were exceptionally quick, such as Imola.', 'You should read Ross Brawn’s book total competition to get a good insight to how and what happened.', 'The FIA happened.']",75,41,0.89,75,40,40,12,7,0.010000000000000009,12

From the current field, Which driver pairings do you think will seal both championships in the fastest car ?
Now I understand the fastest car is a very vague terms, but let's assume this car will have superior qualifying performance and race pace by a decent margin. But not so good that it will just pull a 20 sec gap to 3rd position. (something the McLaren this year has been able to do.)","['I mean we’re about to watch Norris and Piastri in the McLaren do that this year lmao', 'Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean\xa0', 'Im pretty sure most lineups in the grid can win both titles in the Mclaren\n\nDefinitely : Leclerc and Hamilton\n\nEasy WDC but needs to carry the second driver: Verstappen and Tsunoda, Russell and Antonelli, Alonso and Stroll\n\nCompetent duo but could lose the WDC to a one driver team: Albon and Sainz\n\nThe rest are a question mark', 'Assuming the second fastest is not ""left in the dust"" slow by comparison:\n\nI\'m not sure Yuki could hold down the WCC if the Red Bull was fast but as tricky to drive as it is now.\n\nNot sold on Liam Lawson.', ""That's usually what happens, since they started giving out a constructors trophy in 1958 only 12 times has the drivers champion not been in the car that won constructors"", ""Albon and Sainz really could. Look at what Albono is doing in the Williams this year, and with a faster car that is to his liking, unlike the red bull, even though it was a top car, could definitly have a good shot. And even though Sainz has been underperfoming this year, look at what he was able to do when he was at ferrari.  \n\nLeclerc and Hamilton also could. Hamilton for obvious reasons, and Leclerc since he easily could have had a good chance in 2022 if Ferrari didn't fuck up every other race. That shows he was the skills to contend for a championship.\n\nAnd then finally, Lando and Oscar, since they already have basically sealed up both championships, its just a matter of which one wins the drivers championship. \n\nMost of the driver lineups this year could win the championship (Aston martin due to a certain driver) but these three have the best shot in my opinion."", 'Have you not been watching this year?', 'From the pairings currently on the grid?\n\nAbsolutely no question about Charles and Lewis. Max and Yuki - the car needs to be only a bit better to allow Yuki to regurarly score...\n\nOverall, with the exception of Alpine atm (Pierre is not good enough to offset the inexperience of his teammates), every single team could. For the pair from Hass or Sauber it would need to be a bit more dominant than for the rest of them though.\n\n\\-- edit\n\nForgot about Racing Bulls. Those two not yet either.', 'In the fastest car pretty much any driver pairing would do very well.
