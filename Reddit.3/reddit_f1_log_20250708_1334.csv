I think Stroll had a lot less to lose being further back so he pit first for softs on lap 7 during the VSC, a very bold call that no one else on the grid did.\n\nSo I agree with you that Alonso was more so unlucky that he lost out because Aston Martin were playing it safe as he was already high up in P6, whereas they gambled with Stroll and actually benefited massively. \n\nBut they later also took a gamble with Alonso as he was the first car to pit from the second set of inters and switch to slicks on the mediums, which turned out to be several laps too early. \n\nOverall Alonso was just unlucky when it came to the strategy calls.

1ltwsx8,Should the F1 rain light stay on constantly in heavy spray instead of blinking?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ltwsx8/should_the_f1_rain_light_stay_on_constantly_in/,2025-07-07, Discussion,"During the British GP, Hadjar crashed into Antonelli in extremely poor visibility. Afterward, he said he only saw the red rear light at the last moment—too late to react.

**That made me wonder: why do F1 rain lights still blink during heavy spray?**

In light rain, blinking might help grab attention. But in dense spray, the off-moments make the car ahead briefly invisible, which is exactly when you need to see it. A solid, constantly lit rain light would likely be more visible through the mist, even if less “attention-grabbing” on paper.

According to older threads and technical docs, the rain light flashes at ~4Hz in wet conditions and ~2Hz during ERS harvesting, but a solid mode does exist (like during pit limiter). Why not use it when visibility is at its worst?

With wet races becoming more common, shouldn't the FIA consider making the rain light stay on instead of flashing in extreme spray?","[""A blinking or strobing light demands your attention, a single continuous light would eventually start being ignored because it's there constantly. It's why every emergency vehicle has strobing lights."", 'Having two lights side by side in each of the three ""points"" of the triangle, that flash on and off alternately, would possibly help.\n\nThat way there\'s a light visible all of the time, but the flashing makes the light move to still draw attention to it.', ""I've raced in rain worse than this weekend. You can't see any of the lights whether they're blinking, solid or anything. When it's that bad you have no choice but to drive as if you're all running race pace. If someone spins or slows down dramatically you are hitting them 100% of the time. Nothing you can do about it. That's why race directors stop races or pull out the safety car. If you can't stop in half the distance you can see ahead to be clear, it is not safe to race.\n\nTLDR, it doesn't matter in the slightest. By the time you see the light you are incapable of stopping."", 'That light was off more than it was on. It needs to blink way more frequently than it does.', 'On Missed Apex they were talking about giving drivers an infrared HUD. I want this now.', ""When you have zero visibility it doesn't matter if the light is solid or blinking, you can't see anything."", 'Id like them to use those blue tyres now and again bit I think blinking is easier to notice than it being on all the time', 'Thanks for all the great responses — some really insightful points from different sides!\n\nI see the argument that blinking lights draw more attention (like emergency vehicles), and that a solid light could get mentally ""filtered out"" over time. That makes total sense in general visibility conditions. But I still feel like dense spray during wet races is a different beast entirely.\n\nWhen you have 0.5 seconds to react and the light is ""off"" during the one moment you need it — that’s when the blinking works against you. It’s not about visibility over time, it’s about instant detection through walls of water spray.\n\nThat said, I really liked the hybrid suggestions people brought up:\n\n* Split array – top half always on, bottom half blinks (u/laluneodyssee)\n* Alternating lights – multiple LEDs flashing in sequence so there\'s always one lit (u/gazchap)\n* Blinking on straights, solid under braking (u/Broala__)\n* Some LEDs blinking, others solid – similar to some road car configs (u/Zinthar)\n* Visibility might still be zero regardless – fair point from u/vacon04\n* Past version may have had constant+brighter strobe – noted by u/_salmonellensittich\n\nSeems like there’s room for innovation here without abandoning the core principle of attention-grabbing light behavior.\n\nWould be interesting to know if FIA ever tested any of these setups, or why they switched from earlier solid-light configs (as some mentioned).', 'Why not blinking in straight line and fixed under braking']",19,49,0.62,19,427,427,-2,3,-0.010000000000000009,-2

One of the big take aways I had was Martin Brundle, ex F1 driver, experienced, knowledgeable driving the most up to date F1 you can drive without being an F1 driver and his comment about the visibility.

I think we take it for granted and we see people getting in the way of flying qualifying laps or hitting each other on track but his point is really a valid one.

Current F1 drivers of course adapt and are used to the current setup but the visibility of a modern F1 car compared to the past is clearly very limited.

I am a long term big F1 fan but for me I will take this and always consider this a bit more now though.

It's in their DNA from Enzo's days. The driver is just a tiresome burden.  \n\nThe last time the driver commanded respect was Schumacher and thats ONLY because the core team leaders came with him when he joined the team. \n\nThey have very unimaginative race strategy, slow to react to changing weather or race conditions.
