1objc5p,"Russell frustrated by current F1 racing: ""It's a race to Turn 1""",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1objc5p/russell_frustrated_by_current_f1_racing_its_a/,2025-10-20, News,,"[""The races also being a one stopper makes it worse. There's not a lot of options available when track position is so important and the best strategy is a one stopper."", 'The first races of the new reg were so great. Verstappen and leclerc batteling it out in barain swapping positions every lap basicly was fantastic. We went into the completly wrong direction from there sadly', ""Its pretty much how the 2010 season was:fantastic title battle but very boring actual races. The pole sitter usually ran away with the win if he didn't have reliability problems or wet weather shenanigans. \n\nTyres are too durable and overtaking is extremely hard,track position is crucial."", ""He's 100% right. The racing is not good, in my opinion. I know it has been close in terms of standings, and while that is wonderful to hear, this season has been absolutely shocking based on the quality of racing. Amongst the seasons under these regulations, this personally has to be one of my lowly rated seasons of the bunch\n\n\nEverything seems to be decided in qualifying and Turn 1, the cars are large, so close wheel-to-wheel racing is risky for drivers to make attempts and Pirelli's tyres are godsent. I am hesitant to criticise them as well because it is a difficult task. But they have made the tyre wear aspect so durable, that it becomes a non-factor in strategies already"", ""Think the drivers are more or less frustrated than the spectators? \n\nI watch most races on DVR. Watch the first five laps while they shake it out and then bump five minutes forward, check the positions are unchanged. Bump forward again. Positions unchanged...  etc etc. Even the manic enthusiasm of the commentators can't disguise the dullness of the sport."", 'Most of these races feel like Monaco this year. Qualifying and subsequently free air is just king.', 'F1 is a very science/data driven sport. A driver can\'t just show up one day, ""give it their all"", and perform massively better in the race than the data suggests they can.\n\nIf you push the car harder, you burn through tyres faster. The best tradeoff for race time/track positioning is already known by the teams before the race begins.\n\nIf the data suggests that coming out of Lap 1, in 6th, the wear you\'d have to put on the tyres to get up to 5th would probably come back to bite you later in the stint/pit stop strategy, then you just hold position. And the guy in 5th holds position. And everyone just holds position. You\'re probably roughly where you should be in the running order unless you massively underqualified, at which point it\'s a bit optimistic that you can jump 3 positions further up the order, even if you are slightly out of position, pace wise. You\'re not out of position by *enough.* Again, it\'s not a sport where a driver can just get a good night\'s rest and be a second faster per lap. Everyone is very much limited by physics.\n\nThe closer the field is, you will have less overtaking in a series where tyre degradation is a real thing (especially when following). You need meaningful differences between the cars/drivers to create enough of a gap to make overtakes easy enough to pull off (for the faster cars), that you may want to use up a bit of rubber to push for track positioning, or go for a two stop strategy despite coming out behind slower cars, because you\'ll be able to fly past them with your faster car + fresh tyres.\n\nIf you want overtakes, you need to stop people saving tyres. Driving seconds off the pace intentionally because it works out in a net race time gain means that everyone is driving massively under the limit, and when drivers of this level are driving massively under the limit, the chance for a significant mistake is close to zero. If your car is only a few tenths faster a lap, and the driver in front makes zero significant mistakes for 1.5 hours, then you\'re not getting past.', 'The regs were promising but are absolutely terrible. Basically 8-10 laps of racing, then everyone starts parading within 2-3 seconds of each other.', ""I'm in no place to give an educated opinion on this, but I wonder if bringing back the full suite of tyre compounds could help with this problem.  Let teams decide their tyre strategies even more, and even build their car around what compounds they'd like to worth it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I mean by this, if others reading this aren't aware, is FIA truncated the tyre options for a weekend.  Before 2019 they had the full suite available to them.  Pink and Purple were even softer than Red.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, these compounds already exist today and is why you see C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and Pirelli decides which compound is going to be used for the race weekend, but I wonder if they removed this limitation and allowed the teams to decide.  It could absolutely introduce some spicy elements to racing.  Imagine if Mercedes is able to build a car to keep Purples lasting longer while Ferrari can retain decent delta on a hard... its a cool theory to introduce.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI understand the reasoning to simplify the process for manufacturing and viewership, but at the same time it wasn't that complicated to understand.  Again, I think there's a lot of vectors in why racing is the way it is today - especially with aero and dirty air, but this could be a decent change in how tyre strategies could work."", 'yeah true, after first 2 mins i know who are top 3 finish, kinda boring']",3600,570,0.98,3600,12689,12689,614,83,0.010000000000000009,614

Really happy he got a good weekend in points. \n\nI had a lot of fun watching Kimi Antonelli. Super fun, happening drive.\n\nNorris also did a great race. He is 14 points behind and he can definitely get this done with his current form.  His car also had a lot of pace. I don't think Verstappen was getting away without Leclerc doing what he did _twice_. \n\nGreat drive from Verstappen. He needed it to power the hopium train and he delivered.

And especially when they are in the Latin American stint of the season.\n\nIf anything, Franco followed Briatore’s advice of “the only important thing is being faster than your rival”, which in this case is Pierre.', ""Fuck, I hope my comment goes through haha\n\n\nFerrari were on a roll yesterday with their split strategies, a play that I will put in a good word for, so as long as I watch Formula One. I was very skeptical of the call for Leclerc to start on used softs in particular, but I was proven dead wrong with the combination of how well the stops and calls were well-timed, and how well Leclerc made that strategy work. P3 and P4, for everything that has happened to them, is magnificent and I'll take this immensely\n\n\nSpeaking of Leclerc, this has been one of my favourite Leclerc-centric races since Suzuka 2024, and another race to add to my list of reasons on why Leclerc is fierce and precise when it comes to defending. Dude usually goes to the end of his means when he does so, and without too much LiCo-related issues hindering his race, he was able to hold Norris off for very long. Even when Norris overtook him in those two instances *(and cheers to Bozzi)*, Leclerc still applied pressure to Norris whose race can go so wrong if he doesn't take caution. Driver of the day for me, and I'll be damned if this drive goes under the radar when detailing his accomplishments as a driver\n\n\nSmall shoutout for Hamilton for retaining P4 with a strong drive, and for successfully giving me a heart attack for that puncture. From what I know, he was told to LiCo mid-race so it is evident those issues are still existent. Looks like it is a race-by-race case, and they need to figure out what track specifics can suit their car to maximise the most results!"", 'I’ve already sung a thousand praises about Leclerc and so have others; I don’t have much to add other than that watching him defend is such a joy. He’s exceptional at positioning his car, you can see it from his starts as well. I’m also just relieved he’s getting praise from the general fanbase for this, because there have been a few performances this season where I felt he did a top-class drive but didn’t get recognition from casual fans for it because of the car being unremarkable or overshadowed (Saudi Arabia, Spa, Monza.)\n\nThe moves and pace Antonelli had after pitting were brilliant and I wonder if he could’ve had his first on track fight with his teammate had things gone another way. If he had this level of performance at the European tracks, his stock would be much higher - it’s strange how the moment they leave Europe, he’s the fiery rookie I remember from F4. I hope he can end the season on a good note.\n\nI’m disappointed in Sainz, but also not surprised? This year has been a rollercoaster and with him becoming more comfortable in the team, we can see him trying old tricks. The problem is, he shouldn’t trust rookies to make space for him like that. To me it seems like Sainz still has the mentality that everyone he’s racing is a top driver with years of experience. But he needs to reel back in his expectations for how other drivers will react to his moves. Other than that one silly mistake though, I’m pleased with his pace and continued improvement with this car.\n\nAnother underrated weekend from Bearman. He is just so quick when he’s feeling confident, and nobody can say he doesn’t have the willingness to risk moves. I’m excited to see how he grows and one day how he does in Ferrari.\n\nI wouldn’t say Norris had a good weekend because he didn’t complete the sprint (not by his own fault, but we have no idea how he would’ve done) and he was stuck behind Leclerc for almost 90% of the race. But compared to Piastri, Norris looks like a real WDC contender. As in... Piastri was absolutely nowhere this weekend. With this being the 4th weekend in a row he’s struggled to make an impact, it feels like he’s on a mental spiral downward. I know he had this problem last season too but his improvement from the end of last season to the start of this one seemed so big that I didn’t think he’d have the same issue. Even though I’m not rooting for him to win it all, I do hope he can find some good results again just to make it a three-way race rather than a two-way race between Norris and Verstappen with him slowly dwindling away.\n\nI’m surprised people thought of this race as boring. There was action all over the field and Leclerc vs Norris alone had me on the edge of my seat. COTA is my home track and I’m always proud when we come here because it never fails to deliver excitement in some way.', ""F1 needs to sort out its tire situation.

However, everything can always be better ... these are my realistic thoughts (mostly realistic in any case...) to improve the show. What do you think?

1. Points system should be expanded maybe down to 15th. Easy and a total no-brainer IMO. Would give the backmarkers more to race for.
2. Sprint race qualification. Nice enough with more racing / show, but right now its a carbon copy of the race and IMO thats a missed opportunity. Some say reverse grid. I'm not really for that. Instead I would bring back the one lap shootout for qualifying. That would bring enough randomness into the game (track conditions, track evolution). Order = championship position, let the leader go first.
3. Sprint race. This is harder reg. the setup ... but I think it should be doable in our time and computer age: many tracks has different configurations. Change it between sprint and race, so that the sprint has a different configuration. I know sectors will have to be changed for timing. And track will have to be modified, maybe with some paint and curbes worst case scenario. But think that would bring something extra.
4. Would love to see an extra race between the formula 1 drivers - maybe on none-sprint-weekends? - in equal machinery. Could be sponsored locally per event: In germany GT4 porsches, in US some Chevy stock car etc. etc. Expensive and difficult to do maybe ... but think it would create a huge interest. Here qualifying could be an oldfashioned 1 hour test session (to let the drivers learn the machinery) and the grid determined by the sessions order.

1obylse,Piastri chances are still strong - I built a Python Monte Carlo F1 Simulator to predict the WDC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1obylse/piastri_chances_are_still_strong_i_built_a_python/,2025-10-21, Statistics,"With the title fight tightening up after the US GP (Piastri P5, Verstappen P1), I got tired of guessing, so I built a Python-based Monte Carlo simulation to project the final Drivers' Championship outcome.

How real are Verstappen's chances? 

  
1. Track-Specific Performance Weights (Adjustable)

I created a custom system that applies a performance multiplier (a weight) to each driver for the specific characteristics of the remaining tracks (Mexico, Brazil, Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi).

* **Example:** Verstappen gets a `+20% likelihood boost` for Mexico City's high-altitude/high-downforce circuit. This addresses the fact that some cars simply perform better on specific layouts.

# 2. Deterministic ""What If"" Analysis

The script automatically runs a hard-math check to see what happens if Verstappen wins out. Which outside of 2023 - is pretty unlikely even given his current form.

Right now even if Max wins out and Piastri gets 2nd, Piastri takes the championship. 

`--- Deterministic 'What If' Analysis ---`  
`SCENARIO: If VER wins EVERY remaining race/sprint:`  
   `PIA CAN still win the WDC.`  
   `PIA Max Points (if 2nd every time): 450`  
   `VER Guaranteed Points: 447`  
`-------------------------------------------`



The chances for winning a race are the big question. You can run the script and change them. The reality is Max needs a good run + some bad luck from McLaren. 

With these default weights:   
  
`--- World Drivers' Championship Simulation Results (Track-Adjusted) ---`  
`Total Simulations Run: 10,000`  
  
`--- Championship Win Probability ---`  
`Driver | WDC Chance`  
`------ | ----------`  
`PIA    | 74.33%`  
`NOR    | 25.57%`  
`VER    | 0.10%`

  
It does not take a DNF into account - although there is a chance the driver does not score. 

You can play with code and change the weights here:

I know F1 is trying to come up with new ways to bring in more fans and Lee more fans interested. F1 has a unique team and constructor element to its sport that you don’t see in American racing series. F1 is always rumored to be going in the direction of more sprints and more short action events to not lose the attention of fans, they think the only way to gain new viewers is to be able to make a race short enough to post on TikTok, Reels, & YouTube Shorts. But I think biggest complaint is often the lack of action, especially for 1st place. So what if instead of adding races to calendar and/or adding sprints what if a few weekends out of the year they did a tag team “endurance” style race.

You could still do qualifying a similar way. 
Session 1, each team picks a number 1 driver to do a Quali run.
Session 2 the number 2s go out, then session 3, is the best driver from each team in Q1 and q2 go out again for final q3 starting grid. 
Then race day you pick which driver to start and  they drive a full race or maybe only 2/3-3/4. And you still require 1 mandatory pit for each driver, then when they finish their full race instead of crossing finish on last lap, they enter pit lane and 2nd driver leaves their garage once pit crew gets the first car jacked up and wheeled into the garage. Then the 2nd driver goes out and does their 50+ laps through the finish line. Nobody gets individual points just team points maybe only for top 5 or top 7 teams. And if you want to add individual element, you could pair it with a sprint weekend to score individual points
