1n8mfjm,Is Racing Bulls actually outpacing Red Bull in qualifying?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n8mfjm/is_racing_bulls_actually_outpacing_red_bull_in/,2025-09-04, Discussion,"Since Yuki joined the main Red Bull team, his qualifying form has actually dropped compared to his time at Racing Bulls. Meanwhile, Lawson seems to have bounced back after being demoted to the sister team. Max looks like the only one who can truly tame the Red Bull car.  

Hadjar showed in the last race that Racing Bulls aren‚Äôt just strong in qualifying ‚Äì he carried that pace into the race as well.  

[The season qualifying results](https://f1.top-app.eu/season-results/qualifying/2025) give a good picture of how Yuki‚Äôs form dipped after joining Red Bull, while Lawson‚Äôs has improved at Racing Bulls.  

It also makes me wonder ‚Äì what would Max be able to show if his contract allowed him to jump into a Racing Bulls car for a weekend? Even Alonso joked in Zandvoort that Max would probably already be champion if he drove the Racing Bulls.  

So my question is: **are Racing Bulls actually faster than Red Bull in quali, or is the car just easier to drive while Red Bull still has the higher potential pace?**","[""Hadjar has said the car is very east to drive and that it suits him. The team are open that it has a big setup window. I really don't think it'd be competitive enough over the course of a race versus McLaren, though. I don't know how much more pace Max could get out of it in qualifying, he'd probably be at least consistent second row and better?"", 'Difficulty to drive =/= peak pace', 'How many times has the Racing Bulls car challenged for pole position?', ""I don't think using Tsunoda as the baseline of quali performance is a good comparison.\n\nLooking at the little data we have from direct comparison: While Tsunoda beat Lawson 6:0 in quali last year, it's not like Lawson was crushed if you look at the delta. And Lawson managed to beat Tsunoda in sprint qualifyings. In 2023, it was 1:4. In both cases it was basically a rookie thrown in in the middle of the season against a team veteran.\n\nFor Hadjar, there's only two race weekends, but he pretty much held his ground. Missed out on Q3 in Australia by half a tenth (being a tenth down on Tsunoda), made a mistake in Q2 in Sprint quali in China (after being faster than Tsunoda in Q1) and beat him in the normal quali in all three quali phases.\n\nI believe that Hadjar is just quicker than Tsunoda (especially now when Hadjar has some race weekends under his belt). Lawson needed some time to adjust and bounce back.\n\nTsunoda got thrown in into a car in the middle of the season that certainly has its peculiarities. And while he got some OK quali results in at the start of his RedBull stint, I think not getting a good points haul out of that made it harder for Tsunoda mentally (and the mental factor has been a point of criticism for Tsunoda's whole career).\n\nThe Racing Bulls aren't bad this season and not miles behind the RedBull, but they are behind. The upside is that it's likely easier to setup the Racing Bull to get a decent performance out of it."", ""At this point of the season, I'm not sure it is an accomplishment to beat Yuki in a session"", 'RBR is faster.  Max is the true representation of the cars potential.  He would not be more successful in the RB.\n\nThe RBR is just really fucking hard to drive.  If max could win the championship in the RB he would be in the RB willingly.  It has undoubtedly been considered.', ""They're outpacing Yuki, not Red Bull.\n\nVRB is barely in the top 10."", ""The only way to know the true pace of the RB car is to swap Hajdar and Max for a few races to see the comparison between VCARB and RB. \n\nIt's too hard to tell the actual pace when you have one of the best drivers ever outdriving the car."", ""No, not even close.\n\nC'mon man!! They got third place because Norris car combusted itself, both the Ferrari crashed out of the race, Russell car had damage, and Antonelli got like 15 seconds from penalties.\n\nZandvort's race isn't a good measure for the results it had multiple safety cars, accidents. Any race strategy had to adapt to the circumstances, multiple cars were out of place due to the safety cars. The circuit has few overtaking opportunities. \n\nThey are fighting with Haas, Williams for the middle of the pack.
