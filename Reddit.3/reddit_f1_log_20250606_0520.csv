Although he's outperformed his predecessor Liam Lawson—who failed to score any points—Tsunoda himself has struggled to break into the top ten, securing just seven points while Max Verstappen has taken two wins and a podium in the same period.\n\n>To help him adapt better to the car, Red Bull is giving Tsunoda two additional test days this week at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. One is part of a TPC (Testing Previous Cars) session using a modified RB19 from 2023. The second is a Pirelli tyre test, during which the RB19 will be adapted to simulate the aerodynamic characteristics of the 2025 cars."", ""Everyone thought Perez was shit when he was driving the car, so they fired Lawson into it and he couldn't get a foothold. Then they put Yuki, in his 5th year of Formula 1, into the car, and even he cannot come to grips with it. It is now abundantly clear that it is a car problem. There is no point in changing the driver, as it won't resolve the issue. \n\nHadjar is the only other driver Red Bull can put in the car. As brutal as the Red Bull brass are, they're not stupid enough to crush another rookie's spirit by throwing them into the grinder. The car is too difficult to drive, and they're under too much pressure in their rookie season to deliver. I don't think any driver that young, inexperienced and with that many eyes watching them is going to survive that situation, at least with any form of positive mental health.\n\nMax was given an easier car to drive, in an era where crashing was much more acceptable (no cost cap), Red Bull were not title contenders, and he was a generational talent. Now, rookies are being put in a car in which Perez,  [the 8th most experienced driver of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Total_starts), couldn't make work for him. This is inevitably going to lead to tears, and there is nothing they can do about it other than fix the car. They're fucked."", 'I kinda feel like they are giving Yuki a lot more time, understanding and support than they did Lawson tbh', ""Sorry, am I reading this right.  He isn't driving the same car he races in?  Is that going to help much?"", 'Perez on hindsight, did a really good job.', ""Thank god!! I think he could have done better with pre-season testing.
