1kj5t2q,McLaren's Brake (phase changing) Context,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kj5t2q/mclarens_brake_phase_changing_context/,2025-05-10, Discussion,"The videos on phase changing materials are complex and I see many people disregarding it because it seems far-fetched as the discussion has an air of ""ground breaking technology"" which attracts valid scepticism. But there is a more ""simple"" side to it which relates to Red Bull's rumoured ""water in the tyres"" claim. It might not be as unlikely as you think. 

Whether they are using a solid or not in F1, phase changing cooling has been a staple in mobile/small devices for decades as it is basically the only way to efficiently cool such a small device without a pump. If youre using a phone or laptop right now, you are using a phase changing coolant system. Heat pipes or vapor chambers in your device transition water into gas, then back into water when the temp drops. If you've ever had a hot laptop on your lap, its fighting for life to keep the temperature below 100 degrees by constantly changing state. Similar to how an engine circulates coolant to a radiator, except this is pumped so there is no need to rely on a state change to circulate the coolant. 

If a team suspects brakes have heat pipes to regulate brake and tyre temp, a state change and liquid is involved for circulation, hence the water rumour. The high temperatures involved mean they could be using a solid to liquid change as the videos discuss, or it could be a high temp liquid.

The point is that while it is an innovative motorsport idea, its not a scientific breakthrough. Which imo makes it more believable.","['Liquid cooling is strictly prehibited in any form for the brakes though, and the FIA wouldn’t have cleared it if that was the case.\n\nSSPCMs (shape stabilized phase changing materials), are a more likely candidate, but they are not as effective for this use case.\n\nThere’s also a lot of regulatory constrains in the form of legality boxes around the drums, which make the implementation really difficult.\n\nIt’s s cool idea definitely, and could end up being what they’re doing, but its far from being conclusively proven.', 'There was an engineer on here that said its more likely that they use memory metals (Shape Memory Alloys) in their brakes. \n\nAfter researching it, it seems more likely the case since its already used in other car applications and there is research being done on potential applications in car brakes.', 'This post has a no yapping by just the glamour part of f1 fans.

The purpose of the phase change in heat pipes is so that convection can be used to transfer heat more efficiently. The PCMs rumored* have been the solid to liquid type, not the liquid the gas type. The applications of this type are more in line with the constant temperature thermal battery idea, though it’s still unclear to me how that results in the behavior that we see with the McLaren.\n\n* rumor is a strong word here, it’s a hypothesis from a former f1 engineer. It isn’t alleged to come from within the paddock so it’s basically meaningless.', ""It's a good theory, but I'm apprehensive about it. You generally want to minimise unsprung mass. How much of this material would you actually need? I'd love to see some estimates."", 'My 2 cents is: \n\nducts in the brake pads closed by bimetallic foils. When the pad is cold the foil closes the ducts and heat is retained. \n\nWhen heat builds up the foils warp and open the cooling ducts.\n\nIMHO these should be considered illegal moving surfaces, but I see how this could be validated just as they approved bending wings with some limitations.', ""The materials will only absorb so much heat before it essentially become deadweight.

It's also not an issue if there's too many zones like in Australia, because it's not free lap time gain.

The understeer is particularly annoying. But the engineers fear the problem won\'t be completely resolved, even with upgrades.**\n\n> In Bahrain, the first warning sign had already been given. And in Miami, Max Verstappen was unable to compensate for his car\'s deficiencies. In the end, the world champion crossed the finish line just 40 seconds behind winner Oscar Piastri. ""Max was able to pull off a magic trick on one lap in qualifying. In the race, we saw that we were losing an average of seven-tenths to a second per lap to the McLaren,"" calculated Motorsport Director Helmut Marko.\n\n> Verstappen had already complained about his car\'s steering behavior in free practice. As has often been the case this season, the rear end initially feels light when braking and turning. Towards the apex, the balance shifts increasingly toward understeer. It\'s difficult for the drivers to adjust to this shift in balance. The lack of confidence leads to frustration and lost time on the clock.\n\n> To alleviate the problem, the engineers brought a new underbody to Miami. The upgrade was originally planned for Imola, but a sample was finally ready in time for the Florida trip. Naturally, it was installed on the number 1 race car. It\'s rare for such a major change to be used on a sprint weekend, where there\'s only one free practice session for testing and data collection.\n\n> **Underbody alleviates problem.**\nAccording to chief engineer Paul Monaghan, however, the risk was limited. ""We saw in the wind tunnel that the stability of the airflow was unchanged compared to the old underbody. Therefore, we weren\'t worried about it suddenly becoming aerodynamically unstable. The new underbody simply produces a little more downforce,"" the Briton explained.\n\n> The car\'s sensors then spit out the expected values. But it wasn\'t a cure for the problems: ""We know the areas where we need to improve. They\'re the same after Miami as they were before Miami,"" explained team principal Christian Horner. ""The new underbody delivered what we wanted. It\'s part of a series of upgrades that will come over the next few races.""\n\n> Helmut Marko also hopes that the engineers have something more up their sleeve: ""The understeer problem isn\'t solved yet. It improved somewhat with the new underbody, but we still have work to do. I hope that a solution will be ready by Imola so that the car can finally find balance.""\n\n> **No one-stop solution.**\nChief Engineer Monaghan tries to temper expectations somewhat in this regard: ""There\'s no one-size-fits-all solution. It\'s only possible with small advances in many areas. We know what\'s happening to the car, but finding a cure isn\'t so simple. It may never even go away completely. But we should at least be able to mitigate the extent of it. We have a lot of clever people in Milton Keynes working hard on it. I\'m sure it will get better.""\n\n> The question is whether it won\'t be too late for Verstappen\'s title dreams until the engineers finally cure the RB21\'s mood swings. With a current 32-point deficit, Horner sees the situation as already tense: ""The World Championship is over 24 races. The road is long. But McLaren looks very impressive in Miami. Things can change, of course. But we should start reducing the points deficit in the next few races.""\n\n> **Hope for Barcelona turnaround.**\nRed Bull\'s own upgrades aren\'t the only thing intended to bring them closer to McLaren. Hopes are also pinned on the new front wing regulations being introduced for the Spanish Grand Prix. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200bthe front end of the car is no longer allowed to flex as much under load. All top teams need to make improvements here to pass the more stringent FIA tests. This could potentially hit McLaren harder.\n\n> ""It\'s difficult to predict at this point what the impact will be,"" Horner pondered. ""But it\'s not just a small adjustment; it\'s a fundamental change. It will definitely affect all cars, in many areas. It\'s just a question of the extent.""', 'if rbr are still banking on the spain td knowing that the front wing isnt what makes the mclaren go brrr, they are truly lost.

Then he was dropped by Hass for Mick and mazespin for ‘21 he the drove in IMSA for 21 and did fairly well as well, then he returned to f1 for 22 through 24 and beat Mick, and got beaten by Hülkenberg, but even though Magnussen was loads of places behind in qualifying(getting g out in Q1 and Hülkenberg in Q2/3), he was most of times just a couple of places behind Hülkenberg at the end of the race.\n\nSo for me it’s no surprise that he is doing well in WEC', 'Never been an issue of skill with KMAG']",46,9,0.93,46,8,8,46,9,0.93,46

1kilzqv,When did F1 become more standardized and professional?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kilzqv/when_did_f1_become_more_standardized_and/,2025-05-09, Discussion,"For context, I would like to build a hobby project where I try to predict the results of F1 races.

I am now deciding when it makes sense to cut off historical data for my training, because I imagine that the first years, or even decades, of the sport, were a bit too heterogeneous to be really useful.

  
When would you say could be a good point in time for this? I was thinking maybe around the 1980s, I feel like the regulations started being a bit more stable, there were always 2 drivers per team, etc.","['1991 was when the points system changed such that all races were to be counted for the WDC, not just the top X. That and it being the start of a new decade seems like a good enough place to start imo.', ""Even in the 80s you had teams running 1 car or 1 car in some races 2 in others, some teams running the occasional third car.\n\nI'd probably class the professionalised era of the sport when pre-qualifying was dropped and you had a set field of top line teams that were more stable. So around 1993 for me."", ""I'd say 1998 rules set a base of which the current cars still are somewhat derived of. Pre-1998 was much more free for aero and engine configuration."", 'The Concorde Agreement was signed in 1981, mostly confidencial document, but we know that it guaranteed signatory teams entry to every race, and obliged them to enter. It also brought more stability in rules, which you mentioned. I think it is a pretty good point for cut-off.', 'If you want to predict the outcome of modern F1, start collecting data after 2009.', ""I think I would draw the line at '94, and specifically That race day, even though Ratzenberger died during qualifying, they still went ahead for the race, and then the unthinkable happened... I was 14 at the time and I remember it shook everyone and they probably realized that loose rules are not rules, it's not everyday when 2 sportsman dies in 1 weekend, and they need to invest into driver's safety. Rules were there before so it was somewhat standardized when it comes to cars and pit routines and what not, but after that day many things have changed...\n\nI might be just sentimental, but I think that race was a turnaround and if they didn't make changes then the sport would not be around either nowdays..."", 'I\'m not going to bother paraphrasing so I\'ll copy it from the 1981 Formula One World Championship Wikipedia page.\n\n> The 1981 championship was the first to be run under the FIA Formula One World Championship name,[2] replacing both the original World Championship of Drivers and International Cup for Constructors. Under the influence of Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone and the FOCA organisation, teams were asked to sign the first Concorde Agreement, which would set Formula One on course to become a profitable business.[3] The agreement required teams to lodge entries for the entire championship rather than individual races, while the FIA would also set the prize money.[2] A standardised set of rules would be in place at every race and, from 1982 on, the entrants had to own the intellectual rights to the chassis that they entered, as such the distinction between the terms ""entrant"" and ""constructor"", and hence also ""team"", have become less pronounced.[a]\n\nSo 1981 is a good cut-off point if you are going to have one.', ""It's definitely in waves rather than just one moment in which it got more professional. By no means do I know enough to give a proper answer to this, especially pre 80's. But McLaren and Williams from the 80's onwards increased the bar to say it like that. Then from the early 2000's it became even more corporate and therefore professional. And then I'd say that late 10's it became even more professional with academies, teams actually putting a lot of effort in team culture, every small detail etc."", ""I think it was in the 90's""]",0,26,0.29,0,110,110,0,0,0.009999999999999953,0
