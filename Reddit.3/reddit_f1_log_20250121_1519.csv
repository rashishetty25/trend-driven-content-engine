Like, I know it’s a Spanish publication, but there’s nothing about Alonso’s teammate doing well, or a constructor’s championship.', 'It seems like a wishful thinking ngl', 'The British team has revolutionized its top management to face a 2025 of growth and land in 2026 with full options to fight for everything\n\n\n\nWith names and surnames. Without cutting a hair . Aston Martin will no longer return to Formula 1 as a mere supporting actor, something that seemed disappointing at the end of  2024. The factory took off in 2023 and Fernando Alonso came close to winning (Monaco, perhaps, was the great opportunity). But in 2024 it hit rock bottom, only the miracles of the Asturian were the lifeline  of a stricken ship. It is not acceptable. Neither for the driver who has shown the best hands in the Grand Circus nor for an ambitious factory in every corner. For this reason, its revolution has taken shape. Melbourne, at the beginning of 2025, is the first test. And in 2026, the dream and the objective arrive. ""To be a team that wins the World Championship,"" repeat its main names. \n\n\n\nThe ambition is full. Something logical from the vision of the multimillionaire Lawrence Stroll as director. His obsession is for his son Lance to be champion, and before that comes being able to give Fernando Alonso the best results with the green. To do this, the Silverstone team reinforced the weakest positions, seeking progression and a dream that no one hides with the 2026 regulations to be exploited. ""Expectations will be high,"" said Alonso himself on Dazn. It should be remembered that in the new reality of the premier category, more freedom will be allowed in aerodynamics, there is a lot of difference in the wings compared to the current ones and it has a more powerful MGU-K.\n\n\n\nFirst and last names\n\nNo change at Aston Martin is as important as the arrival of Adrian Newey. The most prestigious engineer of all time arrives as a great technical guru, capable of revolutionising any team, as he demonstrated in his last stage at Red Bull. Although he will not start working in a real way until March, more or less, his vision will be key to understanding the evolutions of the 2025 car, the work with the wind tunnel that is already in an advanced calibration phase and the search for success in 2026. There he will try to design a winning car, exploiting the new regulations to the limit and working with the modifications that will mark the new cars. In addition, his word is law. Without his support, few things (or nothing) are done.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewey is the backbone from which the other new features are born. One is Enrico Cardile, who has arrived from Ferrari as the new technical director. He comes after leaving the Italian factory in clear progression during 2024 and will be in charge of creating the car of the future. ""He will oversee the architecture, design and construction,"" they said in their official statement. The mission is, with the addition of Honda as a supplier of the power unit, to quickly adapt to the new regulations. Without neglecting 2025.\n\n\n\nThere is more. The visible heads of the last project (Mike Krack, Dan Fallows or Tom McCullogh) disappear from the front line. And they add another expert, inside and out, on how to make a winning team, the British engineer Andy Cowell. He will be the team boss after his success with Mercedes. There he was the great leader of the success of the team with the star in the hybrid era, as he was fundamental in the creation and development of their engines. On the track, there was dominance with Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg. ""Building a team that wins the World Championship is our only objective,"" he says. There is no limit.', 'Anything is possible IF the other teams sit out the season...', 'I don’t see it. He will be lucky to get another win', ""I see we're still pretending Alonso is in his prime and hasn't aged a day. All good with me I like him, but dude is mid 40's, stop inventing."", ""If that's true, why Lance is still there...."", 'I mean, any primary team has this goal. I doubt it’s ever going to be a goal for a team like VCARB but people are not in this sport to be mid fielders.']",779,117,0.97,779,1988,1988,-6,0,0.0,-6

However i wanted to test how true this actually is so i decided to see the data





For this test i've decided to use the data on driver ranking from the site F1 HOT or NOT.  After each race of the F1 calendar  teams and drivers were rated by fans. Worst ranking on a single weekend possible for a driver is -2.00. Highest ranking on a single weekend possible is +2.00. 





What I've decided to do is compare the rating of each driver between their 2023 and 2024 season and see how they compare  and see if there is correlation between the increase of their rating and increase of their car performance or vice versa. 2023 and 2024 are perfect seasons to compare asthere were no drivers changing teams and everyone remained with the exact same teammate except Tsunoda and Albon, the only thing that changed was car performance

Conclusion: 9 out of 10 teams's drivers rating correlated to car improving and regressing which shows the affect of car performance on the perception of driver rating.
