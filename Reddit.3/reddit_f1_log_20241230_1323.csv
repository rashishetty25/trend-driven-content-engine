Only races where the driver started are included - a WD does not break the streak, or count towards it, so Sargeant in Australia 24 didn‚Äôt make his stint an extra race longer, but also didn‚Äôt stop the streak.

Additionally, if the streak is equalled by another of the same length, the most recent is used (this only affects Sainz, who had another 6 race stint from Canada 2015).

Non rookies who had their longest streak during the most recent season are:

* Stroll (ongoing)
* Bottas (ongoing)
* Hulkenberg (Ended in Saudi)
* Albon (Ended in Monaco)
* Gasly (Ended in Monaco)
* Ricciardo (Ended in Canada)
* Zhou (Ended in Qatar)

Drivers with 1+ full season on the grid who had their longest streak occur partially during their rookie season are:

* Verstappen
* Ocon 
* Sargeant
* Piastri
* Leclerc
* Russell (his first points were for Mercedes in 2020 Sakhir, and he has the honour of being 3rd on the list of most races before scoring points).

Plus obviously the 2024 rookies! This was fairly interesting to me as I assumed most streaks would be in the poorer cars rookies typically end up in.

I‚Äôm working on a university project about how to spark more interest in this exciting feeder series to Formula 1, so your insights would be super helpful. What ideas or topics do you think would encourage more fans to discover and follow F2? Let me know your thoughts!
