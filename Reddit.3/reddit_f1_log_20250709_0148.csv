In the past days we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating Hulkenberg's podium.

So in order to properly commemorate this historic event we decided to create a limited edition flair, featuring a limited edition emoji made by u/Blanchimont.   
  
This flair can only be claimed in the next 27 hours. So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance. If you change your flair back after the 27 hours you will not be able to recover the limited edition flair.  
  
To claim this flair all you have to do is to send a comment under this post including the words ""Hulkenpodium"" or ""Hulkengoat"" (and pray that AutoModerator doesn't crash and burn)

Alonso was in points, so they decided to get Alonso on a more conservative strategy. The only bad thing about the inter-to-slick pit was that it was too soon, they should have pitted Alonso two or three laps later, but at the same time it was time to take some risks with Alonso as he could be out of the points.\n\nI see it more as a stroke of good luck for Stroll than Alonso being unlucky again. I can only wish he could get more of those strokes', 'The biggest problem was that when his inters were dead they pitted Lance instead of him gifting him track position over Alonso making him lose a huge amount of time\n\nNot just that the slick call was way too early', 'For not the first time this season, the lower qualifying positions use a gamble strat and wins big. Haas has done it a few times.\n\nUnfortunate for Alonso, but they’re always going to play it safer for the driver who’s starting in the top 10.', 'I love Fernando in F1 but he could be winning in other categories with teams that actually value him.', ""Stroll was just in the absolute perfect position to swap onto softs under the second VSC, since they knew he wouldn't lose too much track position (did he even lose any positions?) and would come out ahead of the existing slick runners. And then he was in the exact right place when the rain started to fall, to get off the slicks and onto new inters. I think frustration at how well that worked out led to the Alonso-onto-mediums gamble, which was just way too early at that point."", 'As much as I loved seeing a Hulk podium, I reckon Alonso could have held the P3 much more convincingly to have had the outside podium chance.\n\nWhilst I also get that Stroll\'s strategy was more of a ""fuck it, we\'ve got nothing to lose""; it\'s baffling that they wouldn\'t listen to their lead driver on strategy calls.\n\nIt reminds me of some of Vettel\'s final races; granted the circumstances were a bit different, but the Aston strategy calls when he was the lead car almost appeared to be in favour of getting Stroll a point, instead of consolidating the 8 / 10 / however many points that Seb was running in at the time', 'Got absolutely screwed. Same as when Gasly threw gravel on the track just ahead of him in Australia in low visibility conditions and when his engine expired in Monaco.\xa0', 'Stroll gets ""experimental"" strategies actually more often than people probably realize - he tends to qualify significantly behind Alonso / way too far away from points. It doesn\'t always work, in fact it doesn\'t most of the time but when it does it yields some very good results. \n\nFor Alonso, the big problem is, I noticed, is that the team is just very slow to react. Undercuts almost never happen, Alonso is often left out 2-3 laps longer than he should be, the tyre dropoff is also brutal on the aston which makes things much worse.', 'Alonso was basically given the same strategy as the frontrunners staying out and then pitting for fresh inters on lap 11 which most of the grid did. Hulkenberg was the first driver to pit for inters on lap 9, then Stroll and Hadjar both pit for inters on lap 10, before everyone else followed on lap 11. \n\nAt the time Alonso was up in P6 only behind both McLarens, Verstappen, Hamilton, and Gasly. I think Stroll had a lot less to lose being further back so he pit first for softs on lap 7 during the VSC, a very bold call that no one else on the grid did.\n\nSo I agree with you that Alonso was more so unlucky that he lost out because Aston Martin were playing it safe as he was already high up in P6, whereas they gambled with Stroll and actually benefited massively. \n\nBut they later also took a gamble with Alonso as he was the first car to pit from the second set of inters and switch to slicks on the mediums, which turned out to be several laps too early. \n\nOverall Alonso was just unlucky when it came to the strategy calls.

Max can stick it in pole sometimes but actually holding the McLaren's attack is a whole different deal. The races he actually won were in tracks where overtaking is way too difficult if you know what you're doing (like Suzuka).\n\nSo we'll probably see more poles from Max this season, but I wonder if we'l actually get more wins from him. While the 2nd driver will always struggle. Max knows what to expect from the Rb but Liam/Yuki won't be able to predict or know what's the actual limit of the car in a single season."", 'I think people tend to undersell the importance of time in the car. Max has been in the RB for almost 10 years, he’s driven it for every iteration as they’ve developed toward the car now. So it’s hard to drive for everyone, but Max hasn’t had to adapt so much. Whereas it must be jarring for other drivers joining the team.\n\nBut also idk 🤷\u200d♂️', ""It's pretty clearly a mix of both.\n\n\nThe car is hard to drive, even max has said this, but they have also bungled every driver decision for the last half decade. They keep pushing unprepared young drivers (albon, gasly, Lawson) into the seat before they're ready or using below average midfielders (tsunoda, perez) as stopgaps. \n\nIt takes a true #1 driver to use the car, but none of the other ones on the grid want to play second fiddle to max. They're in a situation where their primary driver is too good and leaves them with shit choices for a #2"", 'Max is a superb driver. He can extract a lot from a good car. The Red Bull is a good car, just needs a lot to unlock it. \n\nThe McLaren is a great car.\n\nPut Max in the Haas or Alpine, he isn’t sticking it on pole around Silverstone I don’t think.']",0,129,0.48,0,119,119,0,23,0.02999999999999997,0
1luxkb3,In equal machinery which driver do you think would win at each track?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1luxkb3/in_equal_machinery_which_driver_do_you_think/,2025-07-08, Discussion,"For some reason this thought popped into my mind while I was trying to get to sleep last night.

So I decided to go through each track this morning and who I thought would be most likely to win each race.

This is what I came up with,

Australia - Verstappen - tight with Norris. Albon and Alonso.

China - Russell - Prime Hamilton might win here, but Russell is quite underrated in China imo.

Japan - Verstappen - And it's not even close. 

Bahrain - Leclerc - He is spectacular in Bahrain. Shoutout to Gasly too.

Saudi Arabia - Piastri - This was a really hard one. Verstappen, Piastri, Leclerc and even Russell are all very good here. Piastri just beats Leclerc for me.

Miami - Verstappen - Very hard one to pick. Nobody seems to have always been clean in Miami. 

Imola - Verstappen - Verstappen has basically dropped a 10/10 performance every race he's driven in Imola. 

Monaco - Leclerc has been unlucky in the past  but is rapid around his streets. Shoutout to Ocon.

Spain - Verstappen did have a mad moment this year but it's not for a lack of pace. Prime Lewis might beat him but he was underwhelming this year so Max takes it.

Canada - Verstappen - Russell is good in Montreal, but this is a battle between he three world champions on the grid. Verstappen, Hamilton and Alonso. I'll give Max the edge because he's in his prime and he does not beat his team mates here, he destroys them.

Austria - Verstappen - I really wanted to give this one to Lando but Max's record here is incredible.

Britain - Hamilton - Verstappen and Norris are really good in Silverstone, but I have to pick Hamilton. 

Belgium - Verstappen - He seems to be driving on easy mode every time we come to Spa. Hamilton and Piastri are both very good here too.

Hungary - Hamilton - Lewis has been great here every race since 2017. Verstappen is very good too.

Netherlands - Verstappen - He's won here in 2021-2023 and then got a strong 2nd in 2024. Gasly is also very very good around Zandvoort. Lando and Fernando too.

Italy - Leclerc - Hamilton, Sainz, Leclerc, Russell. A good few very good drivers around Monza. I narrowed it down to Leclerc vs Hamilton. I guess we'll find out who's better this year. I'll go Leclerc (Shoutout to Ricciardo when he was in F1)

Azerbaijan - Leclerc - Perez not being on the grid makes this an easier choice. Leclerc is fabulous around Baku, especially in qualifying.

Singapore - Norris - Lando is fantastic around Singapore and every year he has raced in Singapore he's maximised his performance. 

USA - Verstappen has been incredible here ever since his rookie season. Norris and Hamilton (bar last year) are very good too.

Mexico - Verstappen - Another one of Max's great tracks. In fact Max has won by 12-20 seconds 5 seperate times in Mexico. (Shoutout to Ricciardo again when he was in F1, he was great around here)

Brazil - Verstappen - This is an interesting one. Hamilton used to be great here but he hasn't had a good race in Brazil since 2021. Verstappen is great in Interlagos, Russell is very good too, as are Norris and Sainz. 

Las Vegas - Leclerc - We've only had two races in Vegas so it's hard to choose. Gasly is great in Quali but had terrible race pace in 2023. I'll go with Leclerc as the best overall. His performance in 2023 was fabulous and he was still alright in 2024. 

Qatar - Verstappen - Verstappen and Russell are great around this circuit . Shoutout to Gasly again. Max just pips George for me courtesy of his race here last season.

Abu Dhabi - Verstappen - Leclerc, Hamilton, Verstappen, Sainz, Norris and even Tsunoda Quite a few drivers tend to impress in the final race of the year. Peak Hamilton might win here but as for right now it's between Verstappen and Norris. Max had an incident last year but it wasn't for lack of pace. He also won 4 races in a row from 2020-2023. 

So what do you think? I had a blast writing this and would love to hear your thoughts.","['Hulkenberg of course', 'Equally bad or equally good?', 'On their current form? Max would sweep', 'I’m glad to see so many Hulkenpodium flairs\U0001fae1', 'The obvious answer is Max, but this scenario would give us highly motivated Hamilton and Alonso.', 'Definitely Stroll', 'I think you might be underestimating the liked of Alonso and, of course, Hülkenberg\xa0', 'Equal cars Verstappen would be the favorite for every track.', 'Highly depend on wich machinery. If they all compete on a RB, Max win every single gp.']",0,57,0.41,0,42,42,0,4,0.009999999999999953,0
