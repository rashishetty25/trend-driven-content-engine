We can talk about reflexes, feel, spacial awareness and intuition, mechanical comprehension, strategic foresight, and plain old courage. All of those together, and quite a few more (charisma, team mentality), go into the mixture of a ""good"" driver. Add into that the fact that the driver is only half of the equation. They must also have a car that allows them to use their talents to the maximum, which adds a type of career intuition/savvy into the mixture of being ""good.""

It's the ability of a driver to adapt to and 100% maximize the grip available to them at a particular moment in time, corner by corner, lap by lap. It's as simple as that. No two corners are ever taken exactly the same. The track conditions change, the air temp changes, the tires change, the car changes, it's a constantly variable and dynamic situation. The very, very best drivers are able to maximize what they have every single corner every single time. This extends to their racing. Lots of guys can run the race line at 99.9% but when there's a car beside them they can't maximize. The very best can.\n\nBut one thing to understand is that the margins are RAZOR thin. On a typical 3 mile lap the difference between first and tenth can be as little as 0.5 seconds a lap. That means the 10th place guy is racing at 99.5% the pace of the leader.
