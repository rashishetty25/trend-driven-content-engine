I have heard that he is very satisfied.""**\n\n  \n""I returned to Japan from Abu Dhabi yesterday afternoon (Tuesday, December 10th), and on Saturday I had various discussions with (Red Bull F1 Team Principal) Christian Horner about the drivers for next season and beyond. As I always say, the team has the right to decide on the driver, so our opinion is merely for reference, but from the HRC side, we believe that Tsunoda has the ability to be promoted to Red Bull and should be one of the candidates. I think that what we can do is to provide an opportunity for him to show his abilities to the world, so I asked him to participate in this test, and yesterday we were able to make it happen.""\n\n""I only met (Tsunoda) before the test, and he said, \'I want to achieve good results. I\'m going to enjoy myself.\' He said these two things, and since then, all I have is the report from the site by HRC, but he has very clearly analysed the differences between the RB car and the Red Bull car, and has given the team very useful advice and comments on that basis. I have confirmed from the report that Tsunoda himself is very satisfied.""\n\n""After that, I don\'t know what will happen, so we\'ll have to wait and see the results, but if it goes well, that\'ll be great. In any case, (even if he can\'t drive for Red Bull), he\'s already been booked to drive for RB next season, so I expect him to perform well next season no matter which team he drives for.""\n\n**⚫︎Takuma Sato HRC Executive Advisor ""All we can do now is pray.""**\n\n  \n""From what I\'ve seen, of course, with regards to Yuki, he showed amazing speed from Q1 (second place) at the Bahrain GP (2021) when he made his F1 debut, and I think his growth as a driver has been steadily increasing over the past four years. I met him at Imola (test held in August) for the first time in a while, and he seemed very relaxed, so I thought he\'s become a really good driver. Including race management and race craft, Yuki now has speed, and I think he has grown a lot with age and experience, including his own self-control to manage well.""\n\n""So, as I just said, we are hoping that he will drive for Red Bull, but I think it\'s up to the team. Yuki spoke to the media yesterday, saying that his driving style and the Red Bull car, with its sharp front end, suit him well, so I think he must have had a very good test. Now, all we can do is pray.""\n\n""Naturally, I went (to the Imola test) not only to support Yuki, but also to support Ayumu, and about half of the RB staff there, formerly Toro Rosso, who I tested with in 2008, were still there. So there were a lot of familiar faces.""\n\n""As we talked, it turned out that the engineers on-site really valued Ayumu\'s extremely sensitive abilities, and the feedback they were giving him in the simulator was extremely appropriate. During the actual test at Imola, (Liam) Lawson wanted to show his speed so he was pushing hard, and in a sense he was overdriving, but Ayumu was driving with great control, so the feedback from the engineers on-site was at a higher level for Ayumu.""\n\n""Looking at it like that, both Yuki and Ayumu are becoming really good drivers, so I really want them to get into F1 in a good way.

1hbvnwd,"Thank you Nico Hulkenberg, from a Haas fan",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hbvnwd/thank_you_nico_hulkenberg_from_a_haas_fan/,2024-12-11, Discussion,"Dude did absolutely everything we could possibly have expected of him.  Brought class and professionalism to the team that it desperately needed, and largely due to his driving Haas is in a much stronger position than it was when he got there.

Haas was 10th, 8th, and then in his first year, 10th, and calling their driver's lineup ""slapdash"" before Nico arrived would have been a compliment.

I don't know what role Nico had in helping to develop the improved Haas car this year, but I'm sure it was an important one, with his experience and professionalism allowing him to give very detailed feedback that helped the team figure out which way to move, which is probably the single biggest thing Haas lacked before he got there.  And then he drove that car to a very solid result considering what Haas has to work with.

Nico being a consummate professional salvaged the team's reputation, and I'm convinced his driving and ability to elevate his car helped Toyota to decide to take the plunge and invest in the team giving Haas access to greater resources than they could have achieved anytime soon on their own.  Certainly that was much less likely to happen when the Haas driver lineup was awash in mediocricy.  Now they sit at P7 with Nico having earned the lion's share of the points.  They're poised to make an assault on the midpack and Nico played a role in getting them there.

Haas is, in a word, a team with credibility now, which sure as heck wasn't the case when Nico first got there.

No knock on Kevin intended, but this was Nico's team for the last 2 years and he got it done.  I hope he does well at Sauber.  He earned his pay and owes Haas nothing.","["">Nico being a consummate professional salvaged the team's reputation, and I'm convinced his driving and ability to elevate his car helped Toyota to decide to take the plunge and invest in the team.\n\nI think it was the Silverstone weekend where we first saw some key Toyota people in the Haas garage. That was of course the weekend where Nico finished in P6 for the second race in a row. It was said that they were just some of Ayao's friends..."", '> No knock on Kevin\n\nHonestly, Kevin made things exciting and mostly in a good way.  The way he kept sacrificing his race to make sure Nico got points, in other races the fact that he wouldn\'t give up the fight even when it seemed obvious that there would be no positive outcome, his wheel to wheel battles. \n\nAs for Nico, I\'m happy about how things played out and I\'m always happy when ""one of the good ones"" finds success. He seems like an honestly good guy.', 'It annoyed me intensely when people were slagging off Haas and suggesting they be kicked because Andretti wasn’t getting in. These things take time and they’ve been in a difficult spot. Give them half a chance and they’ll go for it. The narrative that the team existed solely to advertise CNC and they didn’t care where they placed was obnoxious.', 'Haas is the highlight of this 2024 season for me, what a phenomenal comeback. I started the season thinking “Oh boy, it couldn’t get any worse than Haas” (I was a Sauber fan). I was dead wrong. First half of the season, Haas were gatekeeping the top 10 from the Sauber drivers and for the later half of the season, Haas did get in the top 10 for God knows how many times (I lost count). Too bad that Nico and Kmag left after this season, I definitely can see them being the heroes (along with Ayao) who lead the team to the top of the midfield.', ""It's always difficult to judge just what caused a team to improve, there could be a bunch of factors with drivers, engineers, Komatsu taking over as team principal, changes to technical strategy and processes at the factory, etc.\n\nBut one of the biggest things that was noticeable about Haas in the years before Hulk joined was that they just couldn't fix their issues or be consistent from race to race. They had long running issues with tyres, so even if the car's aero etc may have been good, they destroyed tyres and couldn't find a good balance in the car. This issue seemed to keep up for multiple seasons with them just not being able to get to the bottom of how to solve it.\n\nSo it does somewhat fit with the idea that bringing in a strong development driver like Nico may have been a massive help to them. He's had plenty of experience at different teams, even in the years when he wasn't racing he was still a development driver with Aston. So there is a good chance that he was helpful in working through the issues that they were having with balance and tyre wear, and helping them solve those issues.\n\nBeing an experienced professional driver certainly helped too. It gave them a reliable benchmark to measure against - KMag is a great driver too but not always the most consistent, and rookies like Mick always make it harder to tell what's going on with the car and improve things, when you're not sure how fast they should be. Hulk is arguably the best driver Haas have ever had.\n\nHopefully he can go on to do good things at Sauber and help them improve too."", ""I'm always surprised when people are fans of teams and not drivers (except when it's Ferrari because they're almost an Italian national team). Pleasantly surprised though."", 'Top professional. Was instrumental at Renault in 2017 as well maximising the performance on track and providing very important feedback for continuous improvement just like he did at Haas.', 'Honestly felt like Haas was the perfect home for him. Will be a shame to see him in Sauber imo', ""I think having Hulk there really helped highlight some issues, especially in 23 with the tyres. If they didn't have Hulk doing wonders in quali and falling like a stone in the races, they probably never really get on top of that tyre issue as it becomes less prominent. If it was just Mick and Kmag qualifying and finishing 16/15th most weekends, they wouldn't really know that the car had underlying speed. Just makes a bit tougher to drilling to certain issues.\n\nHis feedback as well is meant to be really good and precise. I know Bearman was saying that the way he would describe certain details of the car to the engineers was really good, like Bearman could feel the same details but not able to word it the same way. Small stuff like that just makes it a bit easier to work on improving the car.\n\nIt's a two way street though. Komatsu always felt even though the car had a clear weakness in tyre management, so did Nico. So their tests at the start of the season were as much for the team figuring out the tyres as much as it was for Nico to improve that side. And honestly he really has, I actually think his race pace this year has been a lot better than his quali pace - Nico's just felt a lot more well rounded as a driver.""]",429,60,0.93,429,45,45,16,1,-0.009999999999999898,16

1hbx78u,2024 World Constructors' Championship Alternative Standings,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hbx78u/2024_world_constructors_championship_alternative/,2024-12-11, Statistics,"  
From 1958 until 1978, the International Cup for F1 Constructors (as it was called at the time), only counted the points from the highest-scoring driver in each race for each constructor towards the Championship.

Using the same logic for the 2024 season, these are the standings (if I calculated them correctly, pardon any mistakes). The first table's results are the standings without counting sprints, as they didn't exist back in the day, or fastest laps, which not always awarded points:

https://preview.redd.it/9gv9sk3wu86e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d10da17ef4103eaa33d5f03a37a451da19b7d87e

The only major difference in the standings for this scenario is that Red Bull would finish ahead of Ferrari with McLaren only clinching the title on the finale in Abu Dhabi.

A funny tidbit, but Red Bull's points would actually be just Verstappen's points (no fastest lap points) + 10 (Checo's points in Australia, as Max DNFed and Pérez never finished ahead of him any other time).

This method almost punishes you for both drivers doing well, as Alpine's double podium in São Paulo wouldn't even ""help"" them as much, because only Ocon's 2nd place would count, and many other scenarios like these for the midfield and backmarker teams, as double points finishes wouldn't pay off as much as only 1 car finishing higher.

  
In the second table I've added sprint points using the same logic that only the highest scoring driver from each team counts:

https://preview.redd.it/e2s21au3v86e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=930922410ac5aef16b132f84a4cf70333b0c705d

The only difference in position here from the previous table above is that Haas jumps Alpine for 6th as they scored more points in sprints (again, Alpine's double podium has less relevancy in this scenario).

Something which I hadn't noticed before doing this, but besides Williams and Sauber (which I guess is understandable), I found that Aston Martin also didn't score a single point in a sprint. You would think at least in the sprint races in the first half of the season they may have had the pace for it, but they never did. Maybe shows they struggled with setting up the car with only 1 practice session in sprint weekends.

Just made this for fun, hope I can be forgiven for any mistakes here and there.","['Nice nugget of knowledge. Thanks OP for sharing', 'Mr. V? Is that you?', 'now do this for WDC i want to see where perez would end up', 'Now do one where you count the points of a driver only if they finished ahead of their teammate.

1hbor7c,Requirements of minimum amount of fuel left for lapped cars.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hbor7c/requirements_of_minimum_amount_of_fuel_left_for/,2024-12-11, Technical,"Cars are required to have a minimum of 1.0 liters of fuel left after the race. But are there modified rules for cars that have been lapped? Do they need to have an extra   % of fuel after the race?

I already did the quick search but couldn't find the answer, and to be fair I don't want to read through all technical regulations.


","[""Nope, if a team is confident they're going to be lapped, it's a completely legitimate move to under-fuel the car by a lap.\n\nOf course, if you're unexpectedly on the lead lap at the end you have to make that back up through the race, so there is a risk-reward trade-off for teams who are more marginal."", 'No, they don’t.\n\nStrategists can use this to their advantage. If they’re anticipating being lapped they’ll put less fuel in the car.', ""Lapped cars don't need extra fuel but in current F1 it would be stupid to underfuel to the point where you need to be lapped for it to work out."", 'They just need to have the 1l for fuel testing, thats all.', 'Normally, you want as little fuel in it as possible to go faster. If you are expecting to be lapped then objectively you are doing it wrong. This is the racing equivalent of “buy high, sell low.” As others have stated, the main reason for minimum fuel is to test the fuel. This is to ensure your fuel conforms to the rules. The only reason to break the rules is to go faster, score points, and believe you won’t be caught. Being lapped is a good indicator that you will not score points… so why bother trying to game the system with a slow car.', 'youre assuming lap cars use less fuel while running the same amount of time. faster cars often use less fuel for a given lap time while slower cars can use more for a given lap time. \n\nexample: running a car with more downforce often means more drag. a draggier car is slower on the straights and thus is on throttle longer burning more fuel. also, a car with more downforce can brake later and thus be on throttle longer. \n\nbetter cars are often more efficient with their drag/downforce and will use less fuel doing so.', ""Can I piggyback on this to ask about end of season donuts in Abu Dhabi? Doesn't that use fuel and reduce the amount of tread on the tyres a not insignificant amount? Do they get a grace/allowance for this?"", 'The purpose of the rule is for fuel testing, no matter when you exit the race or even qualifying. \n\nWhat has this to with lapped cars?', ""Especially if you consider that lapped cars can return to the leader's lap under the SC."", 'Fuel no, tyres yes.']",2,13,0.53,2,85,85,0,0,0.0,0

Unlike in sports like football or basketball, which are very easily accessible without having sponsors or rich parents, you can assume that we actually see a large proportion of the best and most talented people on the planet in this sport (of course there is still room for improvement, e.g. in China or India the potential is not even realised in these sports). The fact that very untalented people like Stroll, Mazepin and Taki Inoue were or still are able to compete in this class is unthinkable in the NBA, for example (Yes, there is currently a big exception with the Lakers, but apart from that there was no such thing). One of the reasons for this is that the teams drive cars of different strengths, so you often can't tell from the outside how good the driver really is.
