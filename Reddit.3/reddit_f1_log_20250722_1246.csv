While the immediate impetus for the renovations is the arrival of MotoGP in 2027, the ultimate goal is far more ambitious: to return the pinnacle of motorsport to Argentinian soil after an absence of over two decades from the calendar.\n\nThe project\'s master plan has been designed by Hermann Tilke, the renowned German engineer responsible for numerous modern Formula 1 circuits. His proposal, selected from several alternatives, foresees the construction of a new track measuring almost five kilometres, incorporating contemporary safety standards and significant design modifications.\n\nWhile the new circuit will achieve FIA Grade 2 homologation — a prerequisite for hosting top-level international competitions — this is still insufficient for the immediate return of Formula 1, which requires Grade 1 certification. Nevertheless, the authorities view this as a stepping stone towards achieving that goal in the near future.\n\n\'We have a two-phase plan. The first phase is for MotoGP in 2027, and the second phase is for Formula 1. This involves upgrading to a full A licence for the FIM and achieving Grade 1 status for the F1. It\'s not just about technical issues and all the requirements we have; it\'s also about the walls and the fenders. All of this should result in a very good and exciting circuit,"" Hermann Tilke explained at the official announcement event, which SoyMotor.com attended via our Latin American correspondent, Daniel Panelo.\n\nThe remodelling will have a profound effect on the appearance of the Buenos Aires layout. Historic bends such as Vivorita, Cajón, Ombú, Tobogán Traverso and the S for Senna will be redesigned and removed to create a safer, more fluid design. However, the names of these bends will live on, as they will be used to christen curves and sections of the new course.\n\nThe Curvón Salotto and Chicana de Ascari area, on the other hand, will remain unchanged, preserving a part of circuit number 12 which is familiar to fans of national motor racing.\n\nThe project is being led by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires in collaboration with private promoters such as the OSD Group. In addition to the layout modifications, improvements to infrastructure, safety and access will be made, including new kerbs, optimised drainage, tyre protection, electrical upgrades and grandstands with a capacity of up to 120,000 spectators.\n\n\\[...\\]', 'No giant lake turn?

Tested in FP1, removed for the race and reintroduced in Singapore. Rear wing in Zandvoort was added to the cars later in the season.

There are only 12 races left — just halfway through the season — before everything changes completely. Everyone will start from scratch, and the progress made so far will count for little or nothing.\n\nHowever, some teams are devoting more effort than others to the coming season. However, the reality is that what we see on the track today will not necessarily correspond to next year. We are on the verge of a twist in the script.\n\nIn the latest video published by the F1-Insider website, Ralf Bach analyses the future of single-seaters in the run-up to 2026. He suggests that Honda is taking a different approach to the rest of the manufacturers when it comes to the battery circuit. If so, this will set them apart from the other manufacturers: Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull\'s partnership with Ford.\n\nBach made it clear that Honda is going its own way when it comes to the battery circuit.

Furthermore, it has closed the door on the energy drinks team: if the 2026 engine fails, there will be no going back, warns HRC president Koji Watanabe. The reason? There is speculation in the paddock that the power unit in partnership with Ford may not perform as well as expected.\n\nThere are still a few months to go before the best-kept secret is revealed: the performance and reliability of next year\'s power units. Only time will tell if Honda will take a different approach with batteries and, above all, if Aston Martin will be able to combine the Japanese manufacturer\'s expertise with Adrian Newey\'s input.', 'They look very good on paper to me.

Roughly 90% of Corvettes are sold in North America with the car only available in a few non North American Markets.  In addition to the Corvette being iconic at least in the US, the only competition the car really has for a new, mid-engined, sports car in a similar price range is the Porsche Cayman which while slightly more expensive is still roughly the same starting price at base trim.  Any other mid-engined sports car available has a significantly higher starting price.  Even the highest trim level Corvettes like the ZR1 have n MSRP of $175,000 which is significantly less than the starting price of the least expensive models of mid-engined car for brands like McLaren and Ferrari which start at roughly $225,000 for the McLaren GTS with most other mid-engined models from those and similar brands starting at $300,000 or much more.  \n\nGM wants to get into F1 as Cadillac to elevate the perception of the Cadillac brand and make it more appealing in both the US and globally as an alternative to brands like BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. It's roughly the same idea as Renault rebranding their team name to Alpine with the major differences being that GM is not renaming a team but starting a new one from scratch and that that Cadillac actually has more than one model of vehicle for sale."", ""my guess is that Chevy is such a well known brand and promoted brand that they put Caddy there just to remind folks that they have a luxury brand.
