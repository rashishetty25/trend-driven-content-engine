Part 2 coming up soon.","['Just paid 7800ish USD for Azerbaijan - Legends 3 Day Package. Seemed cheaper than Vegas and other venues.', ""Ticket prices aren't the issue in most cases. Its the travel and accommodation and food/drink all combined.\n\nIts basically the price I would pay for 1 Adult to go away on a resort holiday for a week with the family. Or go away for 3/4 nights on my own to watch a race."", ""Mexico and Brazil have low salaries that I know from knowing people who were incredibly happy that they managed to get American jobs that paid in US Dollars. Brazil in particular was having insane inflation, and with being paid in US Dollars, he was able to buy a house outright, because the inflation is so crazy that mortgages are not given out. I guessed that Azerbaijan had low salaries as well, and a quick google check confirmed it. Monaco just doesn't look right, but you can dig into it and it makes a bit more sense. There are very normal people in Monaco who are citizens and can only afford to live there because they get housing discounts or allowances or something. But there are also lots of multi multi millionaires and some billionaires. I guess if it's median, it knocks those out. It's also noteworthy that a lot of Monaco's citizens just watch from their balcony or from a friend's balcony. Young Charles Leclerc would go to a friend's balcony. So yeah in Monaco probably a huge percentage of paying attendees are foreign. In other races, there are a lot of people from inside the country, though also a fair number of foreigners. Baku I think also has some areas where locals can sneakily watch for free though I don't think as many areas like Monaco. Mexico will have mostly Mexican people though, and it sells out the first day tickets are on sale, so they don't have any difficulty finding people who are willing to pay for it."", ""I went to the Qatar Grand Prix last year (first time, and it's what got me into F1). Booked as a package deal through a small travel agency. Cost ¬£1600 for five nights at a really nice hotel (same one that Verstappen, Norris, Gasly and I believe some other drivers stayed at), flights from London, and tickets to the T16 grandstand.\n\n Seemed like a pretty decent deal, hence why I went despite not being a fan of F1 at the time."", ""The cheapest race to attend was always Hungaroring. I went to Hungaroring 2024 and I don't regret anything. Tickets were 150‚Ç¨ at a bronze grandstand.\n\nIn Europe, flights are really cheap if you go with a budget airline, so a trip to Budapest wouldn't really break the bank for anyone.\n\nIf you factor in the cost of tickets+travel+accommodations most European races will cost you over 1400‚Ç¨. Monza was one of the races I wanted to go to, but any grandstand tickets became unattainable when they were charging 400‚Ç¨+ for a grandstand ticket.\n\nI think with being frugal you'd probably spend about 400-500‚Ç¨/person if you go to the Budapest race (but that if you find cheap flights and rent out an Airbnb during the race weekend and you're from Europe). Food and travel costs around Budapest and to the circuit are pretty cheap. They have a pretty good network of metros, trams, buses and trains that make it easy for you to reach the circuit."", 'but this is comparing ticket prices as a % of local monthly income, not about comparing ticket prices of races against each other', 'This. The ticket is one thing, actually being there is another.', 'Yep. Looked at doing the Canadian GP last season. It was going to be $600 a night for a shit motel 45min away from the circuit. We went to Chile and Argentina for 3 weeks instead.', ""Yes, that's a very good point. The costs would double/triple depending on the time of booking. However, I wanted to compare these costs for locals so flights are hotels are out of the scope of this analysis. For tourists, these costs would certainly affect the affordability.""]",14,14,0.82,14,11,11,14,14,0.82,14
