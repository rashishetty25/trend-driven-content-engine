1k97pcw,[AMuS] Is there help for Verstappen?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k97pcw/amus_is_there_help_for_verstappen/,2025-04-27, News,,"['Translation and full article:\n\n> **Red Bull tries to hit the window of its car every weekend. Sometimes it\'s faster, sometimes not at all. It depends on the track. If the setup is right, only Max Verstappen benefits.**\n\n> This Red Bull remains a mystery. Its operating window is as narrow as a mailbox slot. Every weekend, drivers and engineers strive to hit that magic window. If they find the perfect setup, Max Verstappen has a car with which he can win. Sporting Director Helmut Marko laments: ""This car has great potential, but it\'s difficult to unlock.""\n\n> How difficult depends on the track layout and conditions. Fast corners like those in Melbourne, Suzuka, or Jeddah help. Medium-fast or slow corners, where you have to turn the car sharply, are poison. If the asphalt is rough, the tires overheat too quickly. If it\'s smooth and offers plenty of grip, that helps Red Bull. Heat is a through ball for McLaren. As it gets cooler, the window opens up for Red Bull. Therefore, Marko is demanding: ""We can no longer rely on such randomness.""\n\n> On tracks like Shanghai and Bahrain, even Verstappen had no chance. The car\'s fundamental problem slows him down. Wherever the front wheels are turned sharply or the car rolls along its longitudinal axis, the balance shifts between turn-in and the apex. The car slides, and the tires heat up. This then punishes the driver in the subsequent corners, even if their profile would be better suited to the Red Bull. Over a race distance, the problem is exacerbated.\n\n> **More downforce is not a panacea.**\nRed Bull\'s peculiarities are nothing new. ""We\'ve been struggling with them since the Imola race last year,"" recalls Marko. That was the moment when Red Bull had to react to McLaren\'s offensive, a moment when Ferrari and Mercedes also grew stronger.\n\n> The engineers responded by increasing downforce. But that\'s a double-edged sword with these ground-effect cars. More downforce often comes with side effects like instability or indifferent balance. Once you\'re caught in this vicious cycle, it\'s hard to get out.\n\n> In 2022 and 2023, Red Bull was largely spared these phenomena because the car was vastly superior. The aerodynamicists didn\'t even have to push the limits, allowing them to operate on safe ground. When they took it to the extreme for the first time with an underbody upgrade at the 2023 Spanish GP, Verstappen immediately noticed that the rear end became light when turning, and the car began to understeer toward the apex.\n\n> But it was still subtle enough that the champion was able to overshadow it with his class. The bottom line was that the lap time was faster. That\'s what counted. So the engineers cautiously continued to move in that direction. Until at some point, the pendulum swung, and even Verstappen found the handling annoying. Former driver Sergio Perez was already lost by then.\n\n> **The teammate\'s problem.**\nLiam Lawson discovered the same thing. The New Zealander found the car undrivable. As soon as he was back in the Toro Rosso, Lawson regained his old speed. In Jeddah, he had the pace of Isack Hadjar. Now Yuki Tsunoda has to contend with the Red Bull. It helps him that his driving style leans more towards Verstappen.\n\n> Nevertheless, it\'s noticeable that Tsunoda is closer to the world champion while the drivers and engineers are still in the discovery phase and everyone is complaining about the car. When Verstappen is finally satisfied with the car, the gap widens. In Jeddah, from four to nine tenths. This suggests that a car that suits Verstappen only very rarely benefits his teammate.\n\n> The four-time world champion has an extreme driving style. He wants a front axle that steers on command. He controls the rear with his reflexes or the accelerator pedal, as long as the tendency to oversteer remains within limits. With the level of downforce that has now been achieved, it may no longer be possible on certain tracks and under certain conditions to tune the car so that it remains stable with Verstappen\'s driving style.\n\n> Lando Norris is currently experiencing this phenomenon at McLaren. Although the new MCL39 is a better and faster race car than its predecessor, Norris complains that it no longer suits his driving style as well as the 2024 model. Norris is the closest to Verstappen\'s driving style. His problem is that McLaren will be hesitant to tailor the car to the Englishman. They have a driver in Oscar Piastri who is just as fast. So the engineers will always look for the happy medium.\n\n> Verstappen and Norris need a lot of downforce on the front axle to turn in. Transferring the downforce to the rear in fast corners would require the front wing to flex more under load than is possible or permitted. This could become an even bigger problem for some with the new rules starting with the Spanish GP.', 'Interesting. Makes me wonder just how much the change in Spain will change things.\n\nLike imagine we roll up and Ferrari are the fastest car.', 'RBR investing in cloud seeding bigtime.', '""If we could just unlock it\'s potential""... if that wasn\'t said by Toto every weekend from \'22 through 24', 'Spain TD will be an interesting one…. However, I still think Merc is the most brittle one. If it Happens, WDC will be in Piastri’s pocket.', 'Can’t say if Max really needs help since he’s doing better than other drivers who have tried the seat. I would think given all the issues at Red Bull, Max is pushing the car to its best potential. \n\nNow if Red Bull did get the car in a broader window it would be nice but as I understand it, it’s been the car’s characteristic for along time dating back to Gasly and Albon’s stints.\n\nHowever if anyone did help them figure out that narrow slot better it was likely Newey on the pitwall and race operations - he understood the car better and could guide the team to optimizing the setup. Now he’s not there, Red Bull finds it difficult to tame the bull they made.', 'Thanks for the translation.\xa0', 'Ditto the thanks for the translation.\n\nInteresting to read this last paragraph that both Max and Lando need a lot more downforce on the front wing. \n\nRemoving the ability to transfer downforce from the front to the rear in fast corners, that a flexi front wing (from Spain onwards) could mean we see yet more quali and race drama.', ""Thanks for the translation.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

But others don't seem to have a direct connection – so what’s the real reason behind this sudden Miami hype? Is it just because it's a flashy US race, or are teams seeing it as a big opportunity for sponsors and brand exposure? Or maybe something more corporate-driven?

Feels like there's a bigger push for teams to stand out in Miami than in any other race (even Vegas last year didn't seem *this* extra. I am not counting 2023, as it was the inaugural race). I am not complaining, I love special liveries.

They’ve done it for every US race every year. It’s why they come here. US consumers.', ""Because American fans tend to spend more on merch, especially if it's different and unique.\n\nIt's also a marketing tool to promote the brands and teams even further.\n\nMiami Grand Prix is an expensive race that sees a lot of well-paying attendees who will spend more.\n\nMiami is also a more profitable market than Austin, that's why you see teams and companies invest in this race and not the one at COTA (which has a different vibe in general)."", 'Partly because Miami has its own vibe with teal and pink and ocean colors. I always think of Grand Theft Auto Vice City when I see these. It is easier for design decisions with this palette.
