I have read that Tsunodas driving style is sharp and quick preferring a pointy front end and loose rear. he is also very late and aggressive on breaking. The main difference is being that he lacks the smoothness and a robotic precision that Verstappen has but he has good reflexes. 

From what Ive seen, it seems like Yuki’s driving style is a more ""staccato"" version of of Verstappen. With that being said is Yuki not more well placed to develop into a better teammate? 

Because at least he follows the same philosophy, whereas other teammates would have had to change their whole way of thinking about a corner to adapt Tsunoda seemingly needs to """"just"""" smooth everything out. What were the driving styles of Verstappens failed teammates

For example (looking at your last sentence), in one of the interviews where Albon talked about the pointiness of the Red Bull car, he mentioned that he prefers more oversteer even when compared to drivers like Leclerc. Does this mean Charles would perform worse alongside Max than Alex did? I seriously doubt it. \n\nIt likely just comes down to the Red Bull being unpredictable due to design flaws. That makes it difficult to wrangle into some good pace. Max has reported the car oversteers and understeers basically from corner to corner. Max has enough ability to catch these changes and adjust on the fly, maintaining a decent pace.

Vettel was the absolute KING of this with the blown diffuser. They are all very good off throttle mid corner stage, fast entry - get the car planted and pointed right then punch it out of the corner. The vaunted fast in, fast out style Schumi was known for. I think Max and Vettel had a lot of issues with the Renault engine and the way it behaved off throttle and fed power back in. Ricciardo has a somewhat similar style, but he trail brakes a lot more and blends the entry and mid corner phase on the brakes, and doesn't need as pointy a car as Max.\n\nYuki has bit more of an oversteer style as well, and likes to rotate car on the apex, but similar it is to Max or how well he will do in the RBR if it comes to it, remains to be seen."", 'When Yuki was against Gasly, he used to want a less pointy car than Gasly did.', 'Peter Windsor has a great take on this, along with his take on other driving styles.

Like, that’s kind of a lie. He has done definitely what he should do and, he gave his best. He gave definitely a 100% performance, and, also, I gave 100%. It was in the end up to Red Bull how they’re going to do it.”\n\n“We’re still friends for sure, and we still chat each other, and I like to talk to him. And, yes, since 2020, before that, actually, we had a lot of time that we are teammates, driving in the same categories.”\n\n(via: GPblog)\n\nThey are used to competing with each other and have been rivals for many years. Lawson’s been more defensive in his recent comments about deserving the seat “he’s had his time, now it’s my time” and saying he beat Yuki in the junior series, he has no sympathy for Yuki getting passed over but I think that’s just due to the pressure and him trying to be all like i’m not here to feel bad for others/make friends i’m here to win etc.', ""Both competing for the same competitive seat and a little bit of history from their junior days. No real 'bad blood' per se - also Yuki hasn't really said anything asides from the fact he deserves a crack at the Red Bull seat."", 'Yuki has never talked negatively about Lawson. Lawson recently claimed he was better than Yuki in the junior categories, without looking at the context of the car they had under them.', ""There is no real drama between then. It's all media-manufactured BS like the Norris/Verstappen stuff last year."", 'Nobody’s come to Liam’s defense in the paddock, so he’s made some relatively harmless statements of confidence pointing back to how he’s bested Yuki in the past.\xa0\n\nIt’s a mountain out of a molehill, IMO.\xa0\n\nRB screwed up and put both guys in a bad situation. Hopefully Yuki makes the most of this opportunity.\xa0', 'Doubt theres any bad blood. Just weird fans being weird.', 'Yuki doing his own thing. Got asked if he was ready for redbull, he said 100%. \n\nLawson felt a type of way after he was announced to RB. Nobody texted him congrats besides Ricciardo. After poor performances,  gets bombarded with questions: including what Yuki said and his response to that- he beat Yuki before. I would say the same, you need to be confident in yourself to drive an F1 car. \n\nThere’s no bad blood, just question and answers. The media is just blowing it up as usual.', 'They used to be teammates in the junior categories and I’m sure Redbull gmbh is stirring up drama for the media, because who doesn’t like a bit of drama? I’m sure it’ll look great on the next season of DTS']",0,100,0.4,0,1450,1450,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
