""Can you just tell me how tricky the car was to drive out there today?""

""Uhm, same as always""

""\[you\] Tried the higher downforce wing, no better for you at all in that session?""

""hmm, no""

""Anything positive you can take into tomorrow? Will it be able to have a testing session for you there at the sprint race, do you feel?

""The weather's nice""

He carried a clear look of defeat and frustration, and there were moments where it even looked like his eyes were starting to water. I've never been a Hamilton fan, but it's breaking my heart the way all of his confidence and pride as a world champion just seemed to vanish completely in less than a year. He went from always being articulate, fired-up, and solutions-oriented… to giving these flat, defeated answers.

Is this kind of visible burnout or loss of confidence something we’ve seen happen with other top drivers before? It really feels like a last season or retirement.","[""He's also responded in a similar way during the more difficult times at Mercedes, this isn't unique to his career with Ferrari. It's obviously been a terrible year for him but I wouldn't blow it out of proportion and think he's retiring now, that wouldn't make sense with the new regulations coming in 2026."", ""Personally, I think he's just doing what his Boss told him.

I'm sure he'll quit if 2026 is not competitive...\n\nFerrari hired him to be a leader and help putting the team in the right direction with all his experience, like Schumacher did, but that's not remotely happening.\n\nAs a Lewis fan it's heartbreaking to see him completely defeated."", ""They've broken Sir Lewis in under a year.

If there was a Sprint-specific tire that wasn't part of the C-series which was both high grip and high durability, then drivers would have to be flat out and no tire management would be necessary or desired. This would be a tire more like what we had back during the tire wars.

What are people's thoughts on that?

Of course, we could also just get rid of the Sprints completely, I would be fine with that as well.

I imagine it would not be easy to develop a single tyre and compound that lasts and has high grip everywhere. I also doubt it would be worth development time, for at the moment, only six sprint events and certainly no more than 12 in the near-mid future. I think we are better off putting that effort into a C range that overall works better than now on all tracks, sprint or not."", 'As much as I would like this. Give them the option of driving with actual tires that have no stop off to create an actual sprint race. \n\nThe sprint itselfs are just garbage for everyone. I understand the feeling of having a race on saturday for the people on track. And having a qualifying session on friday. And in return being able to charge them more for ""more on track action"" \n\nIt\'s a worse deal overall. A support series race gets removed because of the build-up and cooldown after a sprint race.   \n30 minutes of on track time gets removed for a 30 minute sprint-race. \n\nSo a worse deal overal. \n\nAnd no-driver/team is going to risk their chances of joining in on qualifying for a single meagerly point. Sure there is some on track-action, but most of the time it just becomes more boring. To a point where for most sprint races nowadays i just look at the highlights. \n\nI\'m more a fan of Verstappens idea.   \nJust make every weekend 1 free practice session, quali and race.']",66,34,0.74,66,31,31,66,34,0.74,66

Verstappen must outscore Norris by any amount of points to remain in contention. If Norris finishes ahead, or neither score points, then Verstappen cannot win the title.

For Piastri things are a little more complex. Norris must outscore him by 4 points or more to wrap up the title. Note that 3 points would leave Piastri 25 points behind, but if Piastri wins the final race then he wins the title on countback of total wins if Norris scores no points.

**All permutations which give Norris the title:**

- Norris wins the race
- Norris finishes anywhere P2-P7, Piastri must finish at least 2 places behind Norris, and Verstappen anywhere behind Norris.
- Norris finishes P8, Piastri must not score points (i.e. P11 or lower) and Verstappen must finish anywhere behind Norris.

P9 or P10 points for Norris would not be enough to get it done

2024 we had tyre issues caused by tyre construction 
And now 2025 we are having the same old repeat.
In 2 years they haven't learned a thing.
At some point you gotta question maybe it's time to either delay the homologation to account for final races or have measure in place to address the issues with mid season changes.
That's the only excuse I can come up with this mess caused by Pirelli incompetance. They are forcing teams to run 25 laps stint because they don't want a failure which is a side affect of having a single tyre supplier that they become complicit in innovation and pushing the boundaries. In 4 years of these new tyres we haven't really had any serious improvements nor have we learned from the mistakes. They have continued to fail in making the racing exciting with the failed C6 tyre which is going to be axed for 2026 and they have failed to fix the issue of tyre construction seen in Qatar. FIA has got all the data that Pirelli could need regarding gravel being used and the curbs being used because they are all FIA grades certified. But still we running into the same old problem. 
F1 should really look into opening up the grid to at least 1 more tyre supplier because the argument of costs doesn't hold up when you consider the fact we have got systems in place to regulate tyre suppliers and cost caps. They could treat them as a option for all teams and regulate the suppliers ensuring they are like what Pirelli is now. It would be like different brake suppliers but obviously much more integral to car performance.
This would at least mean that we have motivates for each supplier to do there best and we could see real push for innovation with tyre suppliers having a benchmark in form of other suppliers.
I am not saying we need to regulate it but we do need to offer a option for all teams.
We can a small set of rules for tyre suppliers basically along the geometrical shape limits for car design consistency and ensure that the tyres are easily interchangable. Maybe in 2000s it didn't work well but with current set of regulations and also mechanism on a sporting level we could make it work. Something to also add is that last Pirelli initially blamed debris for tyre punctures it's interesting to see how they have change the notion coming to this week and also I didn't mention that they had 2021 even though even they had tyre failures because they were different construction also the curbs that are used are something FIA has certified so clearly something that is not track's issue but a fundamental flaw that hasn't changed for Pirelli","[""I aint reading that wall.

Learn to write a coherent post.   \n  \nI did not read it all, but I'm pretty sure these tires are made to exactly what is wanted. They're not made to just be the best and last a whole race.

Many people blamed specific debris last year because it was an easy conclusion from just watching the race. But the cause was identified to be very high wear, which makes the tyre vulnerable to all sorts of things. \n\n2021 was a different track. Literally. They reworked the track between then and 2023, and it was classified as a new track in 2023. The rework included a new surface and a change of curbs.\n\n  \nAlso, try this paragraph thing, please."", 'I just wanted to point out that the current Pirelli F1 tires might be the most stressed racing tire of all time, certainly in F1. The current cars are heavy as fuck (around 900 kg at the start of the race, compared to 600 or so in the early 2000s) and, amazingly enough, quite a bit faster, especially in the corners.\n\nThe tires take an absolute beating.', ""It's the same for every team. So why do you care so much about this?"", ""Yeah..no... I don't think I'd want another tire war. Also, the tires that pirelli makes for F1 nowadays are incredibly durable compared to the ones they made in the early 2010s...check out the  2013 British GP, that was wild. \nIt's a balance between durability and performance, and they can't make a different compound or structure for each circuit... \nWhat I'd like to see is having 7 tire options for the the teams at each race.

The last thing F1 needs is a tyre war. \n\nWe've finally got a close grid with teams well matched at least on the car engineering side, leaving the question open on engine performance next year. I for one do not want to add a question about the best tyre supplier to that equation. \n\nFact is, very few people care about innovation or pushing the boundaries when it comes to tyre technology. The Pirelli tyres are more or less fine - if there are some restrictions at the Qatar GP, so be it, its not a big deal.\n\nIf a Ferrari finally wins a title, it ought to be because they were the strongest team, not because Bridgestone has a team at Maranello customizing their development for the SF26."", ""Were you a small yappy dog in a previous life?
