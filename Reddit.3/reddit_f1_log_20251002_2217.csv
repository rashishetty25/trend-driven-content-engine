(Some tracks don't have showers and drivers have to use the public toilets.)"", '>many drivers instinctively reacted to the cooling vests as a threat to their masculinity.\n\nMen will ne men\n\nReminds me of the nasa pee thing where they had to change the size from small/medium/large  to large / giant / humongous because every astronaute said they needed the large one.']",185,28,0.95,185,28,28,25,0,0.0,25

It caught Bruno completely off-guard, because *nobody* would go for a run there, for Massa to do so, position his car in the perfect place to avoid a crash, save himself from spinning out, and complete the overtake?
