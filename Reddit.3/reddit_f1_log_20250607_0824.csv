Some interesting bits I found:
The 80‚Äôs are the only decade the UK didn‚Äôt win a title and that they have been first or tied for first in 4 of the 7.5 decades. Ironically in the 80‚Äôs every driver who won the title did so driving a British car, but none of the drivers were British. The UK in the 60‚Äôs was the most successful any nationality has been in a decade with 6 titles.

Germany were nowhere before Schumacher but since his first title they have been the most successful country with 12 titles since then ahead of the UK with 9 titles since then. Germany also were first or tied first three decades in a row from their first appearance but it‚Äôs looking like they may not even appear this decade at all as things stand.

Before 2000 South American countries were first or tied first for titles in 3/5 decades and were second in another decade, only missing out on titles in the 60‚Äôs. After 2000 however, they have failed to win a single title. It goes back further though with Senna‚Äôs 1991 title being the last South American title. No one from outside of Europe has won a title since Villeneuve‚Äôs 1997 title.

Argentina and Italy were first and second for title wins in the 50‚Äôs but haven‚Äôt won titles since 1957 and 1953 respectively. Since then however, Ferrari has won 16 constructors titles so it‚Äôs not all bad for Italy. Argentina on the other hand, hang in there maybe Franco can turn things around.

Asia is the only continent (not counting Antarctica) that has never had a driver win a title. Africa has 1 thanks to Scheckter in 1979, which also happens to be the last Ferrari driver‚Äôs championship of the 20th century, North America has 3, Australia/Oceania has 5, South America has 13, and Europe has 53. Not really close on the continent level for the most titles.

The 90‚Äôs were the most competitive decade in terms of titles per nationality, with no country having more than 2 titles. All around though the sport was more competitive as a whole from 1958-1999. In that time period no driver won more than 2 titles in a row (you can technically extend that to 2001, before Schumacher won his 3rd in a row in 2002). In fact, from 1960-1985 no driver won consecutive titles. Prost in 1986 was the first driver to retain the title since Brabham. Compare that to 2000-2025 where 4 drivers have won 4 consecutive titles, and one of those, Schumacher, won 5. In the first 50 years of the sport only 1 driver did that and now in the last 25 years 4 have done it. As much as I loved when Vettel did it, I sincerely hope this era of drivers dominating for long periods of time ends and we go back to different drivers winning the title each year. 

Finally, the most titles any driver has won in a single decade is 5 and 3 drivers have done it (Fangio, Schumacher, and Hamilton). Verstappen has this year and 4 more after it to try to become the first to win more than 5 in a decade and if he wins this year, though it seems to be getting more and more unlikely, it would guarantee the Netherlands finish the decade in at least tied first for most titles. Hamilton may not win another title in his career, (though if he wins the title with Ferrari he would be the first Brit to do so since John Surtees in 1964) but he is the only driver to win titles across 3 decades, the 2000‚Äôs, 2010‚Äôs, and 2020‚Äôs.

To anyone still reading thanks for going through my ramblings and I hope the post was enjoyable. I personally find all the stats involved with F1 fascinating and will go through them for hours. While reading stats or watching old races I‚Äôll sometimes come upon interesting stats and then I‚Äôll go down the rabbit hole to find out everything about that stat, so this is me sharing what I found so you guys can learn about it faster than I did. This was me just doing this from my head cause I know all the champions so hopefully I didn‚Äôt get anything wrong. I‚Äôm sure this stat is already tracked somewhere too but part of the fun for me is building the list like this so I guess there could be multiple sources for the stat now.
