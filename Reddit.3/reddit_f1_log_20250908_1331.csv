* The soonest Piastri can clinch is now Mexico, which could happen if he wins every race, and Norris scores no more than 22 points and Verstappen no more than 85 over the next 4 races.
* If Piastri were to win every GP (and score 0 in sprints), and Norris were to come 2nd in every GP and win every sprint, Piastri would fall one point short of clinching in Vegas.
* If the top 3 in Monza finish in the same order (Verstappen 1st, Norris 2nd, Piastri 3rd) in every remaining race (including sprints), then they would finish the championship in their current order, with Piastri winning on 462 points, Norris on 458, and Verstappen on 454.

**WCC:** still no more eliminations in the constructors, but it is still very much possible for McLaren to clinch next race Baku, provided McLaren:

* Outscore Ferrari by at least 10 points
* Are not outscored by Mercedes by 11 or more points
* Are not outscored by Red Bull by 32 or more points

They are guaranteed to achieve this with either a 1-2 or a 1-3, no matter what the other teams do. Other finishing positions would be possible, but are not guaranteed (depending on the results of other teams).

It is also still possible for McLaren to break the 1000 point mark, but the margins are getting tighter, as their maximum tally is now only 6 points above 1000. This means they would have to win every race (including sprints), and have all 1-2 finishes except for either two 1-3's or one 1-4 or worse.","[""Albon in 7th is mental.

1nbjq85,A reminder that Albon making it to F1 at all was nothing short of a minor miracle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nbjq85/a_reminder_that_albon_making_it_to_f1_at_all_was/,2025-09-08, Discussion,"For me at least, Albon has been the best driver of 2025. More than any other, he's been the one to constantly get the results, even when the car wasn't at its best. But I think it's important to remember that there was a time where Albon making it to F1 at all was incredible.

In case you didn't know, Albon was good in the junior series, but not in a way that indicated that he was an F1 prospect (granted that's mainly down to him not having the budget to race for the biggest teams). For me at least, Albon wasn't even on my radar in any way until the 2016 GP3 series, where he finished runner up to Charles Leclerc, but I never expected him to be in the running for an F1 seat.

F2 in 2018 was a massively competitive and hyped up driver lineup, with Lando Norris and George Russell in particular getting most of the hype, with Nick De Vries being the most hyped up veteran. Alex Albon had very little hype, most likely down to him not even being signed up until the last minute (and even then it was on a race by race basis).

F2 2018 starts off, and Russell and Norris were two of the main title contenders. With them being both rookies and British, Sky F1 hyped them up a lot, but with all that said, Alex Albon never let them disappear. It was always fairly close between Russell, Norris and Albon, yet the former two always had a lot more hype than Albon did.

In fairness to Sky F1, a bunch of their pundits did eventually realise that Albon did deserve to be in the same conversation as Russell and Norris. I remember Martin Brundle tweeting to the effect of *""We hyped up Russell and Norris a lot, but why not Albon? He's right up with them two in the standings, why aren't we talking about him more?""*

Eventually that did indeed happen, and on the F2 broadcast at least, Albon was discussed a lot more, especially by the end of the season. But despite all this, F1 seemed all but impossible for him. So much that he signed up for Formula E for the 2018-19 season.

But fortunately for Alex, all the right dominos fell into place. Ricciardo moved to Renault for 2019, which saw Red Bull promote Gasly into Red Bull. Even then though, Gasly was replaced with Kvyat, and it was obvious that Red Bull wanted to replace Hartley with Ticktum, however Ticktum lost to Schumacher in European F3, which meant he couldn't earn his superlicense for 2019. All of this had to happen in order for Alex Albon to get the 2019 Toro Rosso seat, and even then a bunch of Hartley fans were unhappy at the announcement.

There were still rumblings online about how well Albon would do at Toro Rosso. I remember some predictions placing him dead last for 2019, but seeing him now, in his sixth year in F1, and performing to a better and higher standard than ever, it's amazing to think that there was a time where nobody thought he'd even be close to an F1 seat.","[""Owes a lot of it to Jean-Paul Driot of DAMS who could see the potential and supported him for that 2018 season so they could get him in the Nissan e.dams team.\n\nUnfortunately for JPD, Helmut came calling at testing and he knew it would be pointless to try and stand in Alex's way."", ""Albon is as British as Norris, he just races under a Thai flag because it's beneficial, while Norris has a rich parent.\n\n\nBoth have one parent from the UK and one parent from overseas, both have dual nationality.\xa0"", ""Albon just goes to show how fine the margins can be to getting that F1 chance.

I truly don’t understand why someone would offer this to their championship rival.

I saw on some other threads that some people were saying it was the team’s idea and not Lando’s. I went into Lando’s POV which sometimes included extra radio messages which didn’t make it into the main feed but nope, the main feed didn’t miss any context. It was Lando’s idea. Here is the transcript:

Team: Lando we will box this lap after the soft tire <more words I don’t understand>

Lando: do you want to pit the other car first?

Team: yep we’ll do that. We’ll swap it around so stay out

Lando: well only if he doesn’t undercut otherwise I’ll pit first

Team: There will be no undercut

So the team said “box this lap” then based on what Lando said they switched to “stay out”.

What was Lando trying to do? Did he just not want to risk a SC in the lap between the two stops?","['I think it was a way of not getting fucked over by a safety car if it happened after he pitted', 'Lando didnt want to get caught out if a safety car came out after he pitted.  He didn’t care about oscar getting beaten by leclerc and honestly leclerc wasn’t a threat.', 'Is lando\'s "" do you want to pit the other car first"" a suggestion or a question?', 'It was clearly something Lando thought would benefit him, either 1 lap less on used tyres or to save against a safety car. No way was it for Oscar’s benefit', 'I don’t buy the story of them being worried about leclerc. Although the McLaren stop for Piastri was incredible, he emerged from the pits still around 4/5 seconds in front. Another lap wouldn’t bring Charles in front. They also offered the stop to Lando initially anyway. If they were so worried about it they would have told Lando they were pitting Piastri first and explain why. \n\nLando didn’t mention covering Charles in his radio message. My only guess is he wanted track position and fresher tyres. Lando will want as many cars between him and Oscar as possible to bring that points gap down. When they are so far in front in the teams championship I’m sure he doesn’t care about making sure they get 3 points over Ferrari if him teammate was to finish 3rd or 4th. \n\nI think McLaren didn’t want their pit crew to feel like they were influencing the championship. Oscar was reeling Lando in a few laps before they stopped to put himself in a position to capitalise on any errors and that’s exactly what happened. \n\nIf this championship somehow goes to the wire and it’s within a 3 point margin I would not want to be McLaren trying to explain this.', 'Either he was worried about a safety car (or hoping for one to challenge for the win) or he was worried about tyre life on the soft and wanted one less lap on them.', ""The only hope they had of a win was a safety car.

Oscar Piastri opened up after a challenging race at Monza, where McLaren opted to swap positions between teammates. While not thrilled, Piastri called the decision ""fair,"" acknowledging Lando Norris had been ahead all race. He reflected on handling struggles in the first stint and accepted that the car lacked the pace to challenge Red Bull. The young Aussie is focused on learning and improving from here.","['Going for the diplomatic approach, I see.\n\nIt is probably a smart move on his part. The numbers current favour him in the championship fight -- all he needs to do it win one or two more races and he can finish second to Norris in every other race and still be champion. It would not be worth incurring the ire of the team for the sake of a few extra points. I cannot say that I like it, but McLaren seem to have shot themselves in the foot and Piastri comes out of this looking mature and magnanimous while Norris gets booed on the podium. It might mean playing politics, but with any luck Piastri can parse this into some kind of additional support from the team since the team seem to be hypervigilant about how the public perceive them.', 'In the objective sense of the word yes it was fair, the question is if McLaren were obligated to be fair in this scenario; to which most people would answer no, but that’s what they seem to have chosen and this isn’t the first example. For better or worse this is consistently how they do things.\n\nThe biggest take away is that’s this is two races in a row that they’ve made race ruining bad stops, they just got lucky that they made them under the safety car last weekend otherwise they’d have been in deep doodoo then as well. Something needs to be looked at there', 'The reporter misrepresented the discussion - there was no reference made to protecting from Charles. Norris decided by himself that he wanted the second pit, as long as there was no risk of undercut.\n\nWJ: And Lando, the gap to Verstappen is now 11.1. Lando, we will box this lap onto the soft tyre and come up one \\[on the front wing\\].\n\nLN: Did you want to box the other car first?\n\nWJ: Yep, we’ll do that. We’ll swap it around so stay out.\n\nLN: Well, only if he doesn’t undercut, otherwise I’ll box first.\n\nWJ: There will be no undercut. Confirming we are staying out\n\nLN: Yeah, confirm.', ""I see people saying this is the right approach but it is not and might hurt Piastri more in the long run. I will explain:\n\nA strategic choice was made to let Piastri pit first due to the chance of a possible SC(non-controllable). This is a clear advantage for Norris. The risk for Norris is that he might get undercut. He had a clear time advantage, so the choice was made with the idea he won't get undercut.\n\nThe pitstop was too long (non-controllable) and made Piastri undercut Norris. Not strategy or planning.\n\nSo this was the deal: the non-controllable circumstances are ONLY in favour of Norris and never in favour of Piastri. If Norris got the SC advantage it would be him in front of Piastri but never Piastri in front of Norris. Terrible deal isn't it?\n\nSo why does this hurt Piastri? \n- Getting played: his team is taking the Mick out of him with this bad deal.\n- The team gets away with it. Next time they will do the same and not feel the pressure of a mad Piastri.\n- Self worth: Piastri is a great driver worthy of the #1 driver in a team. Your devaluating your worth and be the guy that is taken advantage of. That is not the position you wanna be in and worth fighting for to not be in."", 'Piastri is great. Doesn’t want to air drama.', ""All I wish is that this doesn't come back to bite him in the ass. Behind close doors, I hope Mark Webber smacks some sense into him and we get the ruthless Oscar we've been accustomed to see.\xa0"", 'Hopefully when the moment comes to return the favour, it will be a swap for 1st place, so there will be more points gained :)', 'And it sets a precedent if Oscar loses a position due to a slow stop later. \n\nFans will be writing Papaya law books once the season is done.', ""Yeah seems like the better decision. But there's a possible outcome that Oscar loses the wdc by a handful of points and that decision could come back and haunt him.\n\nAnd nobody guarantees you'll get another shot at wdc.

Now that the dust has settled in Monza it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""This season had so much potential and I really can't describe how angry and disappointed I am that the tyres are consistently far too hard."", ""McLaren attempting to be as fair as possible to both their drivers could backfire on them and put them in a corner when something arises in the future.\n\nAs Toto said (remember, he is the one TP who has had to deal with his two drivers fighting each other for the WDC), what if the positions of the drivers get swapped by something that's not a pit stop and isn't the fault of the lead driver?\n\nFor example, if the trailing driver gets a free stop under SC/VSC or red flag? Or if a driver from another team pushes the lead McLaren off and thus allows the second driver to get ahead?\n\nPersonally think that Oscar gave up the position without any complaints so that he can use this as leverage for the future. If he's leading on track and anything outside of Lando overtaking him or him getting a penalty results in the positions being swapped, he can mention this on the radio and request for the original positions to be reinstated.\n\nEspecially since in yesterday's race, they were fighting over P2 and P3, so it would only be a 6 point swing. In the majority of the remaining 8 races, they should be battling for P1 and P2, which would be a 14 point swing. And he can try and use this to his favour in a race later on if something out of his control costs him track position to Lando.\n\nBoth McLaren drivers are downplaying this in public, but Max's amused reaction and Toto's opinion on this make it clear it's not something that would happen at other teams and that they find it strange."", ""I will throw an early monkey wrench to the discussion. My apologies to the dudes who manage the place in advance\n\nFrom my understanding, the events took place as follows:\n\n• Norris has stated, when asked, that he is alright with Piastri stopping first, so as long as he does not end up behind him, essentially an undercut. It is affirmed that nothing of the sort will take place. It is also understood that McLaren's general rule is to let the leading driver pit first\n\n• Piastri proceeds to pit with 1.9 seconds without a hitch\n\n• Norris proceeds to pit. There was an issue with the front left tyre. The pit took 5.9 seconds and he ends up behind Piastri instead, which was not a part of what was agreed upon\n\n• McLaren proceeds to go on the radio and asks Piastri if they could swap back. Piastri was understandably confused, but he decides to honour the request\n\nNorris agreeing to the stop with conditions in the attempts of protecting his position while also ensuring the security of the team's 2-3 position in that manner is understandable. Even though I understand the strategy fully, but ultimately *(and this is admittedly under hindsight)*, McLaren should have stuck to the original agreement provided, or maybe provided risk assessments for the leading driver to take. Reasons being that you do not confuse and alienate the drivers later, and you are also preparing for any misfortunes from taking place, considering how risky it all is\n\nHowever, the gamble did not pay off and the blunder happened *(neither you, me nor a deity can change that)* and McLaren asks Piastri to make the swap, the same way that Norris was asked to make the swap in Hungary 2024. I am of the opinion that bad stops are a part and parcel of the race but not only does McLaren seem to have stipulated procedures about a potential situation like this, given their advantage in the WCC, but the drivers themselves displayed sportsmanship in regards to their team when the other alternative is just as present for the taking. They both acknowledged the team mistake and the difficulty of the other being stuck in this position. I think it is handily established prior that radio messages are not a great indicative of true sentiments, given the lack of full context to the drivers and I don't see why this should be different here.\n\nDo I think the call to swap is understandable? Yes. \n\nDo I think this was a highly unnecessary situation for McLaren to put their drivers into? Also yes. \n\nDo I think this is a warrant for some of the most ridiculous outcries and complaints I had ever seen from the likes of social media users who follow Formula 1? Absolutely not.\n\nTo me personally, the line between fighting for your points and regarding the team dynamics for a team that values themselves more makes the battle interesting. I am curious to see where it goes from here for them. But McLaren definitely needs to sort this out, especially when they want a fair championship fight"", ""Since every discussion here will be about papaya rules, let's not forget the performances of Albon, Hadjar and Gabi.\n\nAlbon has been amazing this season. Going from P14 to P7 is just amazing and he's now ahead of Kimi in the WDC. The battle goes on till Abu Dhabi as he said and right now I'm backing Albon to finish ahead.\n\nHadjar is easily the rookie of the season. Pitlane to P10 is a brilliant effort. Really pleased for him given how it all went wrong in Melbourne. Is he going to get the Red Bull seat for next season? \n\nGabi has also really picked up his race performances. His qualifying performances are getting all the praise and for good reason. Hulk is no slouch on Saturday's and Gabi is beating him fair and square. What's more impressive is that he is improving in races all the time. Now a consistent points finisher, I think he's really setting himself up nicely to lead Audi once Hulk retires."", ""The first few laps were probably the best race start we've had all season.\n\nA set of mediums holding up for a whole race is just silly, something really needs to be done about the tyres. The more grip-less durability to less grip-more durability trade off from softs to hards just doesn't work far too frequently.\n\nI see no issue with what happened with the McLaren drivers.

So I'm not fan of anyone, no biases, just pure interest in racing and what racing right now is in F1 and what it maybe should be ?  
  
Considering what we have seen lately with these penalties to now Bearman vs Sainz and last race Sainz vs Lawson.

I feel like as racing we are entering kind of weird area, I dont know the exact ruling, but whatever it is it needs change or adjustment ?

The thing is if we aren't allowing drivers to go into corners wheel to wheel, then overtakes are not going to happen as often, see in my opinion when Bearman had half of his car alongside Sainz, then Sainz should give that room to allow this fight to happen, same goes to Liam though it was more of like racing incident imo, but still Liam shouldve propably leave bit more space before closing.

Another thing I wanted to discuss is the turn 1 in Monza, like Norris and Verstappen are alongside one another and Norris kind of doesn't turn (turns late/has too much speed) and instead goes more forward which pushes VER out of the track as he just cannot turn otherwise they crash and its like so who is first at that apex ? If we go by centimeters we might find the answer but is that racing ?   
  
The thing I heard on broadcast is Lando is on the racing line and he is entitled to it but is he ? Was he on racing line ? He barely made the turn imo, he was carrying too much speed and it shows on the line he had to take in that case. Going over the curb having only his right wheels slightly over the track limits line. Thats not racing line is it or rather not the optimal racing line (its shit line that would lose time every lap) but then it begs the question whats stops you from turning late in every turn and leaving the car on the outside not able to turn, with this current scenario it seems you can do that everytime and imo it just promotes unhealthy racing. Like everytime it seems  you want to be on the inside, slightly ahead and then just turn late so the car on outside cannot do shit and has to either crash you or leave track and thus overtake outside of track.

What's your thoughts on these scenarios, what would be the ideal way to ""fix"" or let me know why you think its good the way it is now. Whatever feels right to you.   
  
Just bring no biases into this discussion pretty please, let's keep it healthy for F1 and racing in general so we can all enjoy the best of both worlds.","['Good job on catching that Norris was a bit wide on T1, so Max went wide to give more space which led to the runoff, then he had to give it back.\n\n\nMost new viewers (and old viewers) have not noted that nuance, usually just hurr durr max agression, etc.', 'So the important context to remember is that the guidelines as they currently exist were agreed upon by, and developed with, the drivers. This is the ruleset they wanted. \n\nAs a fan, though, I agree that it\'s...not great as is. Another good example from this weekend was an incident in the F2 sprint. Dunne pulled a massive move, came from very far back into T1 on the inside and got to the apex first, and essentially ran Megatounif out of track. Meg then had a lot of momentum, came across and hit Dunne on the outside of T2. Meg was penalized for rejoining unsafely and causing a collision, but the scenario in general was caused by Dunne a) playing the rules well and b) somehow controlling a wild divebomb.\n\n But there was also generally nothing Meg could have done to avoid contact - it was a low probability move from Dunne, but should Meg have braked earlier as the first into the corner, to just let Dunne by? That\'s the only way that I can see that contact could have been avoided by the defending driver. \n\nIn general, I think we all want to see hard, controlled wheel-wheel racing. We want overtakes to be encouraged, but still difficult to do. If the car ahead at the apex can run the other car off of the track at will, it doesn\'t make for great overtakes. \n\nIt may not help, or it may cause other, larger issues that I\'m not thinking of, but I\'d be curious how changing the definition of ""alongside"" to represent the literal position of the car would impact racing. Essentially, say, if the front tyre is beside the rear, then the lead car has to provide at least a half car length or a tyre\'s width of room on track - something, to give the trailing driver a chance to not crash or run off track, while still likely losing out on the position.', 'And that\'s why we have the term ""racing incident"", because there are many times were both drivers can be in the right and yet something still happens. I don\'t know how to make it better, but the only suggestion so far that seems to be the best is the idea of having a fixed team of stewards instead of having them switched up every race. Some more consistency is needed, but other than that, racing will always be a very tricky thing to monitor and penalize correctly all the time.', 'Online sim racing has it pretty simple. As Alonso said, all the time you have to leave the space. Works well. Been asking for years why it can‘t also work like this IRL.\n\nIn cases like Lando T1, if you don‘t leave the space and therefore force the other car off track, there is no issue with cutting the chicane since you were basically forced to cut it.', ""Lap 1 should be on Norris for pushing a car off the track, but ultimately the stewards didn't make a call on it.\n\nNorris was behind going into the corner, he was behind in the corner and he was behind coming out of the corner so at no point was he entitled to that corner.\n\nBut the fact that RBR felt the need to give up the place regardless speaks volumes about how rules are either to vague and open to interpretation, or the lack of trust in the stewards making the right call."", ""The drivers asked for this level of detail in the guidelines and it's been dreadful.\n\nAs Mark Hughes at The Race suggested recently, the best thing for them to do would be to scrap 80% of the guidelines, because they can never cover for 100% of racing scerarios."", 'The main issue I think everyone agrees on is that the ""First at Apex"" rule they are currently following is bad.\n\nFormula 1 has the big downside of cars being very fragile. This has improved with the 2022 regulations, but contact still means parts break off, leading to loss of downforce and therefore pace.\n\nThis fragility means that I personally feel overtakes more often than not turn into ""either you move out of the way, or we crash"" moves.  \nThis is only increased by the ""First at Apex"" Guideline for Stewards. It rewards reaching the apex first by any means necessary. It doesn\'t matter if you push the outside car on the grass, it\'s legally your corner now.\n\nWe don\'t need NASCAR levels of overlap to be allowed space, but front axle ahead of the rear axle would be a start for both defender and attacker', ""Basically Dijon '79.

1nbabp4,[Opinion] The drama surrounding McLaren’s swap is due to their strategy and garages being unable to react live to race events,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nbabp4/opinion_the_drama_surrounding_mclarens_swap_is/,2025-09-08, Discussion,"As a fan, and seeing how McLaren operates today (very different from the 2000s), the drama over today’s swap seems to stem from the fact that, while the car is now a race winner, the team still falls short of a championship team level in some areas. Unlike Mercedes or Red Bull, McLaren struggles to maximize every situation live during races.

On several occasions, the team hasn’t been able to adapt or respond quickly enough to unfolding race scenarios, often failing to counter rival strategies. Don’t get me wrong, sometimes their approach works out, but they don’t seem to be as “clinical” as RBR with strategy for example, with all respect for McLaren team.

Today’s swap issue, in my view, arose from a calculation error and slow reaction to live race events. The logical plan was simple: if Lando (running in front) chose to pit second, it would give Piastri the chance of an undercut, so if Piastri then took the lead due to pit stops, McLaren would swap them to keep the order. Easy to understand from their POV (“Piastri, if you undercut because the strat order, you must give back because it was _gifted_ to you”)

However, what really happened was that an unexpected event (the slow stop for Lando) was the true cause for the position change. Without the +3s added to the stop, Lando would have come out in front of Piastri.

Fairly, Piastri should have stayed ahead as he only benefited because of the slow pit stop, not  because the strategy of who pits first. So the swap clause shouldn’t have been “activated”, as he wasn’t in front because strategy. 

In the end, McLaren stuck to a plan rather than reacting to real circumstances, showing the team still has ground to cover to act like a true championship contender. And this is just another time of them doing this, watching the race in delay and going too hard by their pre-race scenarios, without ability to adapt to the moment.","[""We will get these posts a lot those two weeks, don't we"", ""> if Piastri then took the lead due to pit stops, McLaren would swap them to keep the order.\n\n\nThis is exactly what happened - only it was a slow pit stop, not an undercut, that caused the issue. Piastri was still 'gifted' the position.\n\n\nWe can say it was 'fair' for Piastri to keep the position as he wasn't responsible for the slow pit stop, but we can say the exact same thing about Hungary 2024 - Norris was not responsible for the team's decision to pit him first which led to the undercut. Norris wasn't in much danger of being undercut, so they could've just pitted Piastri first and avoided the issue.\xa0 Yet, he was told to give the position back to Piastri.\xa0That was back when Norris was the leading McLaren and was still aiming for a WDC.\n\n\nMcLaren has made the decision that a swap due to a team error has to be rectified by the drivers.

He doesn\'t owe him anything, Norris should have swapped back immediately then, instead of trying to argue for keeping the position for so long. In this case, Norris gained a position directly and actively by the team\'s strategy (pitting him first). His gain was Piastri\'s direct loss. A swap rectifies the specific action the team took.\n\nPiastri gained a position passively because his teammate had a problem. Norris lost time, but Piastri did not actively take the position from him; he inherited it due to Norris\'s delay. The ""gift"" came from misfortune, not a specific team action against the other driver.\n\nTreating these two distinct scenarios as if they demand the exact same outcome ignores their crucial contextual differences. A team\'s policy might rightly treat an active strategic intervention differently from a passive gain from an error.']",0,14,0.34,0,12,12,0,1,-0.009999999999999953,0

Do the drivers swap when they know the championship depends on it? Racing is unpredictable and we saw that last week. Just let the boys race and do whatever you can to support them and if one driver gets a bit more lucky than the other than great they win the wdc.
