1jnachh,Robert Kubica’s 2010 Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jnachh/robert_kubicas_2010_season/,2025-03-30, Discussion,"Yesterday on the Daily Discussion thread somebody asked who was the best driver in 2010? 
I love looking at questions like that and so I got out a book I have that reviews the 2010 season and took a little look at it and the results and race reports and was myself fully expecting to go with Alonso or Hamilton. However Kubica stood out to me so much that I not only think this was his best season in F1 and that he was the best driver that year, but it is maybe the most underrated season from a driver of all time. I think it deserves to be appreaciated more and spread to newer fans. His 2008 was great too but probably a little overrated. This season is amazing.

It’s insane how consistently good he was. You have to remember that Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren were very far clear of everyone else. Mercedes were fourth fastest and Kubica was in a Renault. Yet he put in so many great performances. 

This is his season in full.

Bahrain - Qualifes P9 Behind the Red Bulls, Ferraris, McLarens and Mercedes. Then he’s taken out on lap 1 and drops to last but is one of the only drivers able to overtake in a fairly boring race and beats his team mate to finish P11. 

Australia - Has amazing race with no mistakes in the rain. He had a great first part of the race going from 9th to 3rd which became 2nd when Vettel went out. Then he held off Hamilton and the Ferraris for the ENTIRE race. 

Malaysia - qualified in 6th and finished 4th. Again in the 5th fastest car. 

China - Another great intelligent drive in mixed conditions gets him a very respectable P5 ahead of both Red Bulls.

Spain - qualifies best of the rest behind top 6 and finishes P8

Monaco - Puts in one of the greatest most underrated Quali laps of all time to qualify second. In a Renault. https://youtu.be/qbYMoKxif6I?si=py8cesIs3LvZqMJ_ 
Please watch it it's outstanding. On the limit, kissing walls, pure magic.  Then in the race he finishes third behind the faster Red Bulls. He outqualified and held off both Ferraris and both McLarens. 

Turkey - Qualifies P7 finishes P6

Canada -Qualifies P8 finishes P7. 

Europe - qualifies P6 finishes P5. On lap 1 he made an incredible double overtake on Webber and Button. 

Britain - qualifies P6 and is unlucky his driveshaft fails in the race while he’s running P4. He even got up to P3 at the start. 

For context after 10 races he is now on 83 points while his closest comparison his team mate is on 6. Kubica has about 14 Times the amount of points as his team mate. And while his team mate Vitaly Petrov isn’t great he’s not Mazepin or something. Like the following year he gets a podium and he had a respectable junior career. 

Germany - Starts best of the rest in P7. Finishes best of the rest in P7. He could not have done any more than he did. 

Hungary - Qualifes P8 but is team releases him into the path of another car in the pit lane and they crash. Not Kubica’s fault. Probably would have finished P5 or P6 without the incident.

Belgium - Qualified third! And finishes third! Was P2 for most the race until he made pretty much the only costly  mistake of his season and overshot his pit box. Finishing P3 in a race you made your first mistake of the season is not bad at all. This mistake isn’t even that bad compared to what the other drivers in contention to be best of the season did in this race and the next. Alonso crahsed out in Belgium and Hamilton likewise in Monza. 

Italy - Starts P9 finishes P8.

Singapore - Starts P8 finishes P7. 

Japan - Qualifes P3 ahead of both Ferraris and both McLarens! For comparison Petrov is P13. In fact after that lap Robert was white faced and could not speak. He could not belief what he'd just done. Then at the start Kubica gets into P2! But in his most unlucky moment of the year his wheel comes loose and he has to retire on lap 3. 

South Korea - Qualifes P8 and finishes P5 in treacherous conditions. 

Brazil - Qualifes P7 finishes P9. 

Abu Dhabi - Qualifes P11 but finishes P5! Makes a couple of great overtakes. 

I am not excluding races where he did poorly because there are none. Every single race is on that list and he had was impressive in every single one. 

An incredible season from Robert. He finished on 136 points while his team mate Petrov finished on 27. Single Handedly gets Renault P5 over Williams and Force India. Beats Michael Schumacher by over 60 points in a lesser car. 

He had three podiums in the third best car. He finished in then  top 7 in 12 out of 19!races. He finished in the top 6 where he had no right to be in 9 out of 19 races. He also would have probably finished P5 in all the races he didn’t finish. None of those retirements were his fault. Had he not had any of those unlucky DNF’s he would have finished within 100 points of the winner of the championship for goodness sake!  For context in 2024 nobody except Lando and Charles finished within 100 points of the championship. 

In fact this 2010 season from Kubica has to be one of the most underrated seasons from a driver of all time.

A think it deserves to be appreciated and I want to spread this to newer fans who only remember Kubica from that 2019 season for Williams.  

The next year at the start of 2011 pre season testing he was fastest in the Renault. Then a few days later in a tragic twist of fate he was severely injured in a rally accident that he spent the next 8 seasons recovering before his fairytale return with Williams in 2019. This was a disaster as the car was the worst in the field by a giant margin. Kubica also wasn't the same driver he was before and he was outpaced by rookie George Russell in nearly every race. In 2021 he also got a couple of substitute races when Kimi got Covid and he finished P14 and P15. 

He left F1 as one of its biggest what ifs and is now 40 racing well in endurance racing. 

I really hope some newer fans see this and find a new appreciation for Robert and his masterful 2010 season.

1jndvqa,The Curious Case of Nico Hulkenberg's Dominant 06-07 A1GP Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jndvqa/the_curious_case_of_nico_hulkenbergs_dominant/,2025-03-30, Throwback,"I would like to introduce you to the most interesting season driven by an F1 junior in recent memory.

When we think about the junior ladder to F1, we have known it for the last 2-3 decades to be a relatively standardized process. The natural progression of the ladder has generally been:

National F4 (\~150-200hp) -> Regional F3 (\~200-400hp) -> International F2 (\~400-600hp) -> F1

There have been variations over the years, competing series like Formula Renault 2.0/3.5, the introduction of GP3/F3 creating an international F3 step, and so on, but the general process has stayed consistent. There have been drivers who skipped steps (Verstappen skipping F4 and F2, or Antonelli skipping F3), but most drivers have followed this process as a tried and true method of getting to Formula 1.

If we look at Nico Hulkenberg's junior career through the feeder ranks, he followed a similar progression (Note: every series past German F3 has 1 qualifying per 2 races):

2005: Formula BMW ADAC (\~140hp) - 1st Place, 8 wins, 14 podiums, 9 poles in 20 races  
2006: German Formula 3 (\~200hp) - 5th Place, 1 win, 6 podiums, 3 poles in 18 races  
2007: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 3rd Place, 4 wins, 8 podiums, 2 poles in 20 races  
2008: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 1st Place, 7 wins, 8 podiums, 6 poles in 20 races  
2009: GP2 Series (\~600hp) - 1st Place, 5 wins, 10 podiums, 3 poles in 20 races

Nico followed a generally standard progression up the ranks, winning a title at a level before making the step up, and winning F3/F2 back to back, the classic marker of a top tier prospect. You may have noticed, however, that I omitted his A1GP season, so lets go ahead and give that an introduction. A1 Grand Prix (A1GP) was an international single-seater series that ran from 2005 to 2009, featuring teams representing nations. The series had a grid of professional drivers in identical cars with a Lola chassis and a Zytek 3.4L V8 producing \~550hp.

Lets add that series into the progression to see how it looks:

2005: Formula BMW ADAC (\~140hp) - 1st Place, 8 wins, 14 podiums, 9 poles in 20 races  
2006: German Formula 3 (\~200hp) - 5th Place, 1 win, 6 podiums, 3 poles in 18 races  
**2006 - 2007: A1 Grand Prix (\~550hp) - 1st Place, 9 wins, 14 podiums, 3 poles in 20 races**  
2007: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 3rd Place, 4 wins, 8 podiums, 2 poles in 20 races  
2008: Formula 3 Euro (\~220hp) - 1st Place, 7 wins, 8 podiums, 6 poles in 20 races  
2009: GP2 Series (\~600hp) - 1st Place, 5 wins, 10 podiums, 3 poles in 20 races

Yes, you are reading that right. **Nico Hulkenberg, a 19 year old F3 driver, during a random winter in the middle of his standard 3 year regional Formula 3 progression, was chosen to represent Germany in an international series with professional drivers in cars with \~550hp and double the downforce. And in only his second year racing cars, he absolutely DOMINATED the field.**

When I say dominated, I don’t mean that lightly. Here are some highlights from this season:

**Round 1: Netherlands (First Weekend, First Victory)**

In his first feature race at Zandvoort, Nico put together an absolutely incredible drive in dry to wet to dry conditions. In a car with more than double the power, and performing his first career pit stops, Nico drove a flawless race, making up 10 seconds in the final dry stint over USA's Phil Giebler to take victory by 7 seconds.

**Round 4: Malaysia (Best Drive...Possibly Ever?)**

After taking second in the sprint race to start the weekend, Nico Hulkenberg put together what you might be able to argue is his greatest career drive. In extreme wet conditions at Sepang, in a race full of professional drivers with identical cars, Nico Hulkenberg **won the race by 43 seconds**. Yes, 4 3. And the cherry on top? He stalled his car at the pit stop and lost 8 seconds. Absolute masterclass. Don't believe me? Watch this: [https://youtu.be/ePmM8Dipz-Q?si=Bnk8jrP9cUGxOCrz&t=4378](https://youtu.be/ePmM8Dipz-Q?si=Bnk8jrP9cUGxOCrz&t=4378)

**Round 6: New Zealand (Grand Slam #1)**

During his first trip racing in the southern hemisphere, Nico Hulkenberg put together an incredible run of form, starting at Taupo. Pole, Sprint Race Win/Fastest Lap, Feature Race Win/Fastest Lap. Another absolute slaughtering of the field, this time in dry conditions and by only a mere 20 seconds: [https://youtu.be/P1ZIQ7Vqd2E?si=kvg1blcZB2ziR1Hl&t=5774](https://youtu.be/P1ZIQ7Vqd2E?si=kvg1blcZB2ziR1Hl&t=5774)

**Round 7: Australia (Grand Slam #2)**

Back to back Grand Slams? Yes indeed. Another brand new circuit for Hulkenberg at Eastern Creek Raceway, another Pole, Sprint Win/Fastest Lap, Feature Race Win/Fastest Lap. The field ran him a bit closer this weekend but he still pulled out a 6 second gap in the feature race to drive home the point.

**Round 8: South Africa (Almost Grand Slam #3)**

Hulkenberg is on a fantastic run, but there's a new twist: street circuit. Racing on the streets of Durban proves no challenge for Nico, who's third Grand Slam in a row was only foiled by losing the fastest lap at the end of feature race. In another filthy display of dominance, Hulkenberg built a 22 second lead in the feature race, had his lead evaporate to a safety car restart with 13 laps to go, and still won by 10 seconds to take his **6th victory in a row**: [https://youtu.be/wbhHXcF7UyY?si=GIzPhXGFwunaRq2F&t=4682](https://youtu.be/wbhHXcF7UyY?si=GIzPhXGFwunaRq2F&t=4682)

**Round 11: United Kingdom (Perfect Finale)**

Having missed Round 9 in Mexico for Euro F3 testing, Hulkenberg returned at round 10 in Shanghai to take 2 third places and seal the championship. At the final feature race at Brands Hatch, Nico drove a phenomenal defensive race to retain the lead with the UK's Robbie Kerr breathing down his neck from start to finish, sealing his 9th victory and 14th podium in just 20 race starts. His victory cost the UK second place in the championship to New Zealand by 1 point.

**Result: Champions**

Nico's outstanding performance throughout this season singlehandedly won the 2006-2007 A1GP championship for Germany. His 9 wins in 20 starts set the series record for most wins and most laps led, which he held until Neel Jani finally surpassed his record to set the final A1GP record at 10 wins...in 60 starts. Nico's performance was a victory for his manager who placed him in the series, Willi Weber, who also happened to be the manager of Michael Schumacher. Weber's confidence in his young German talent was so much that Weber happened to miss Schumacher's final victory for Ferrari in Shanghai to be at Hulkenberg's first A1GP race at Zandvoort.

Curiously, Hulkenberg's performance in this championship did not accelerate his passage through the junior ranks as it may have today. Weber kept him on track, continuing the standard route of the 220hp F3 Euro series for 2007, leading to dominant championships in Euro F3 in 2008 and GP2 in 2009 before going on to have one of the most unique Formula 1 careers in history.

It was purely a teams championship.\nAlso, not every driver was a seasoned professional, many were up and coming amateurs trying to make a name for themselves.  \n\nMost of the professionals were at the end of their careers, not the peak of them, and most teams swapped drivers during the seasons, so in many cases drivers were trying to come to terms with the cars handling qualities, as opposed to maximising their lap speed.\n\nSome of the professionals were relatively inexperienced driving open wheel cars, or hadn't driven one in a decade or more.  Even rally drivers were in the cars, usually quite quick but not great at actually racing.\n\nHulkenberg did become a name I knew during that season, and he was really strong and it did look like he'd be a talent to watch out for on his climb to F1, but it wasn't a clear sign he'd even get there, let alone anything indicating he'd be particularly good in F1.\nCertainly GP2 was a better indicator."", 'Shocking bad luck in F1 to never have a podium.

1jnt9b2,My suggestions for F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jnt9b2/my_suggestions_for_f1/,2025-03-31, Discussion,"First of all, I would like to say this is not a vent post. I'm a big fan of formula racing. For a bit of background, I used to watch F1 in the late 90s until 2008. I stopped watching after that but have followed NASCAR my entire life. In 2022, my girlfriend got me back into F1 and I've watched every race since. That being said, there's certain aspects of the sport that I feel could benefit from some minor tweaks.

Firstly, I'm not a big fan of teams changing their tires during a red flag. This can swing the outcome of a race drastically. We seen this last year when lando pitted at Brazil before the red flag came out, allowing Max to get a free stop. I recently watched a race from 2020 or 2021(can't remember) when Lewis pitted under a safety car, giving first place to max, who then got a free stop after the red flag came out. In these situations, I like to consider Nascar's policy for red flags. Under a red flag, a team can change tires, but must go to the back of the grid on restart. This obviously wouldn't work for F1, as going to the back of the grid is too much to overcome. I think it's fine that teams can change tires under a red flag, but it shouldn't count as a true pitstop. What I mean by this is if a driver hasn't gone to pits yet and a red flag comes out, they still should be required to make a regular pit stop. This would eliminate a great deal of chance, so that the winning driver can have a better reflection of what team was truly best prepared.

The other issue I have is the cost cap. As a hockey fan, I've seen first hand how great a salary cap can improve the product the league puts out. That being said, this is F1, the Pinnacle of motorsport. Implementing a cost cap stunts innovation, and innovation is important for F1 to cement its status over other forms of motorsport. I think F1 should follow MLBs model of a salary cap. MLB uses a soft cap with a luxury tax. Bigger market teams are able to go over the salary cap, but must pay a luxury tax on every dollar they go over the cap. That money then goes to smaller market teams. If F1 used this model, bigger teams could spend more to build even better racecars, but would also be giving money to smaller teams through luxury tax. This would raise the floor, rather than lower the ceiling. Something to consider here would of course be the presence of sister teams in F1. Perhaps teams paying luxury tax shouldn't see the tax go to sister teams.

My 3rd idea is probably gonna be the least popular, but I'm genuinely curious to see what people think about it. This idea involves lapped cars. In some races, a huge number of drivers get lapped. I recall watching a 2021 race when Lewis, max, and bottas were the only drivers on the lead lap. I think it would be interesting to see points only go to drivers who finish on the lead lap. This allows a driver to obtain more than just the points given for winning, by also taking points away from other drivers. I think this would work better under f1s old scoring system though, where the winning driver receives only 10 points. Perhaps this would allow drivers to fight for the lead lap, rather than get blue flagged.

Sorry for the length of this post, and thank you to whoever took the time to read it. This is just one fans opinion but I am curious to see if others agree, and if they disagree, why. Also curious to see other ideas that you folks have to throw in the pot. Looking forward to a great season, cheers.","[""ykw maybe mbs isn't so bad after all"", 'We used to not have this cost cap, and all it did was entrench the gap between the teams that could spend heavily and those that couldn’t.
