Anyone with a short summary?"", 'From an article on telegraaf.nl: \n\nMcLaren team boss Andrea Stella says he is not particularly surprised. “We see a clear pattern,” said the Italian. “On circuits that are hard on the brakes, combined with bumps and kerbstones, we don\'t have the best car. You saw that in Canada, in Baku, and now also in Singapore. We mainly gain time in corners, but they are rather short here. Here it\'s more about braking and traction.”\n\n\nStella sees two main reasons for the loss of dominance. \n\nThat\'s the technical side of the story. Stella also thinks that the competition, especially Red Bull, has further developed this season\'s car and gained a better understanding of it. ""We stopped developing the car some time ago and focused entirely on 2026. Red Bull brought a new floor to Monza and came here with a new front wing. So there are two sides to the story: our development and also the characteristics of the circuits we have driven on in recent weeks.“\n\n\nWhich circuits still suit McLaren?\n\n\nStella also thinks that the next race in Austin could be ”a bit of a struggle"" for McLaren, because the corners there are tight in many braking zones. ""At the start of the season, we had an advantage on many circuits, but the field is now closer together. Although I think that in the remainder of the season, the circuits in Brazil, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi will suit our car well. It\'s no surprise to me that Red Bull is also doing well here in Singapore, on a circuit where they have often struggled. It\'s still Red Bull, an extremely capable team. And then there\'s Max Verstappen. He needs no further introduction. We would have liked to have made Formula 1 boring this year, but that\'s not how it works.
