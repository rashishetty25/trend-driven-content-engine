1p8gtrm,What’s at stake!? WDC Points Breakdown,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p8gtrm/whats_at_stake_wdc_points_breakdown/,2025-11-28, Statistics,"Current standings: 
1. Lando Norris 390
2. Oscar Piastri 366
3. Max Verstappen 366

Breakdown: 

Lando needs to piece together 35 points out of a possible 58 available. Why? Because if Max or Oscar takes all 58 that would give them both a possible 424 total points. By taking all 58 I mean they win the Sprint of Qatar, the Grand Prix and then Abu Dhabi. So if you’re rooting for Lando he just needs 35 points which would give him 425. If you want Oscar or Max to win you hope Lando can’t scrounge out 35 points and scoop as many points as you can. ","['Thanks!
