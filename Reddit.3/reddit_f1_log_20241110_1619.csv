1gnnzfy,"Into the Buxtonverse: following up on Will's predictions of the 2025 grid, four years later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gnnzfy/into_the_buxtonverse_following_up_on_wills/,2024-11-10, Discussion,"During the 2021 summer break, Formula One published [a prediction](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/buxton-my-just-for-fun-prediction-of-what-the-2025-f1-grid-will-look-like.5ngS2W3xboKjYqmOubDVhM) by u/willbuxton of which drivers would form the 2025 F1 grid and where they would drive. Will assured the reader that it was just for fun and implored them not to take it too seriously, so I've decided to create an in-depth analysis.

First up, what he got right: 9 of the 20 drivers, with correct teams for 3 of them.

|Driver + Team correctly predicted|Driver correctly predicted to be on grid (predicted team)|
|:-|:-|
|Max Verstappen - Red Bull|Lando Norris (Red Bull)|
|Charles Leclerc - Ferrari|Carlos Sainz (Ferrari)|
|George Russell - Mercedes|Pierre Gasly (McLaren)|
||Liam Lawson (Aston Martin)|
||Esteban Ocon (Alpine)|
||Andrea Kimi Antonelli (Williams)|

The prediction of Ferrari keeping their LEC-SAI lineup for a 5th straight season deserves praise. That was a bold call given that Sainz had only completed half a season with Ferrari and had never spent even 3 full seasons with a team in his career, and it took a black swan event to keep it from coming true.

I also respect the predictions of Antonelli and Lindblad being on the grid, keeping in mind that both of them were still karting at the time. Antonelli will be on the grid in '25 while the Lindblad prediction may end up being off by only 1 year if Lindblad performs in F2 next year like he did in F3 this year. Also, by predicting Lindblad to be on the grid in '25, Will implicitly predicted that the 18-year-old age restriction would be relaxed or lifted, which did indeed happen in our timeline.

Finally, I think Seb's retirement took quite a few people by surprise in our timeline, while Will seemed to have seen it coming and was only off by 1 year in predicting it.

Okay, nice job with those predictions Will. Now let's take a look at some that didn't pan out:

|Drivers whose career ends were incorrectly predicted|Drivers predicted to be on the grid whose F1 careers ended prior to 2025|Predicted drivers who never entered Formula 1 as of 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fernando Alonso|Mick Schumacher|Pato O'Ward|
|Lewis Hamilton|Nyck De Vries|Theo Pourchaire|
|Lance Stroll||Dennis Hauger|
|Oscar Piastri||Jamie Chadwick|
|Alex Albon||Arthur Leclerc|
|Sergio Perez||Kyle Kirkwood|
|Yuki Tsunoda||Zane Maloney|
|Nico Hulkenberg||Arvid Lindblad|

As you can see, there are quite a few drivers whose careers ended by 2025 in the Buxtonverse but not here. While there was a brief ""rookie winter"" in our timeline where teams heavily valued experience, teams in the Buxtonverse were eager to give new talent a shot.

Another interesting note: Oscar Piastri's and Theo Pourchaire's fortunes are almost mirror images of each other's in the Buxtonverse. There, Alonso (still driving for Alpine) retires mid-season 2023 and is replaced by Piastri for the rest of the year, who also keeps the seat for '24. Meanwhile, Pourchaire drives for Alfa/Sauber in '23 and '24 and replaces Piastri at Alpine in '25 (it's implied that his French nationality plays a part), with Piastri failing to find a '25 seat. The two of them had finished 1-2 in F3, separated by 4 points, the year before the prediction was published and it seems Will put a lot of stock in Theo's youth and inferior machinery.

# Championship Predictions

|Year|WDC|WCC|WCC-P2|WCC-P3|WCC-P4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024|Lando Norris (Red Bull)|Red Bull|McLaren|Mercedes|Ferrari|
|2023|Max Verstappen (Red Bull)|Ferrari|Red Bull|?|Mercedes|
|2022|Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)|Mercedes|Ferrari|?|?|

Will was correct in predicting that the top teams of '21 would still be the top teams going into '25. But he didn't foresee Red Bull's utter dominance of the middle third of the new regulations or Mercedes' struggles with them.

# Miscellaneous Predictions

> Williams have regained momentum and form under the new regulations, picking up podiums and pride.

Not exactly.



>Aston Martin have had a rollercoaster few years. The change in regulation wasn’t kind to the team, dropping them to ninth in 2022, but steady progress in 2023 and 2024 has brought them back up to a competitive space for 2025.  
...  
In 2024 (...) fifth in the constructors’ championship

This is kind of accurate?



> Schumacher moved to Alfa Romeo in 2023 after a second season with Haas in 2022 failed to live up to expectations.

In a way, that 2nd part came true.



>AlphaTauri remained unchanged in 2022 and rocketed to 5th in the constructors’ championship. At season’s end Yuki Tsunoda made way for Liam Lawson and another solid season brought the team home in sixth.

>But Gasly’s defection to McLaren for 2024 left an open door and into it stepped the impressive Dennis Hauger, fresh from the F3 title in 2021 and the F2 crown in 2023 to race alongside Lawson into 2024.

Both AlphaTauri and Dennis Hauger long for the Buxtonverse.","[""Is crazy to even try to guess who'll be on 4 years on the grid. Some of those people are very well around 14 years old.

1go16ny,Why can't I watch last weeks race on ESPN?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1go16ny/why_cant_i_watch_last_weeks_race_on_espn/,2024-11-10, Discussion,"Couldn't watch the race last weekend because of work, but I've never had a problem watching on ESPN On Demand.  Now, I go on [ESPN.com](http://ESPN.com) on ANY device (TV, phone, laptop) and click on the ESPN2 version, log into my cable TV provider (which it allows me to do) and I get this error:

I have no other option to watch the race and I'm not a sports guy, I ONLY watch F1, so I'm not about to pay for an ESPN+ subscription.

Worried that something has now changed to force you to pay for a subscription, even though technically I'm already paying for the ESPN services because I'm paying through my cable provider.

Anyone had success watching last weekend's race in the US?  Or, is anyone else getting this error?","['A lot of comments here are missing the point that OP is getting ESPN through their provider and not currently paying extra for ESPN+. I get the same error for the ESPN2 version but the ESPNU version should work.\xa0 The start time of the GP was moved so it started on ESPNU instead as the NY marathon was on ESPN2.\n\n\nEdit: just saw OPs other comments about not getting ESPNU, sorry you might be SOL here.\xa0\xa0', ""Get an [F1TV-Pro subscription](https://f1tv.formula1.com/) and watch any race/practice/quali/etc. to your heart's content."", 'When I tried to watch on my youtube tv (which should grab it from whichever espn or basic access channel it is on) it started up in the middle of the race. This was on Sunday and is probably because the race was not at the time it was originally scheduled to be at. I believe it was moved a bit earlier because storms were expected later. But my youtube tv account just grabbed it from where it was supposed to start.\n\nBut, I also have f1tv, so I just opened it up and watched from there instead.', 'I don’t have an ESPN subscription through a cable provider so I can’t help with your question, but I am impressed with your patience with the barrage of “just get F1TV” comments that are just not helpful. It seems from the few commenters who actually read the post that maybe you’ve been screwed over by the change in the ESPN channel carrying the race, in turn due to the change start time. If so, that’s a bummer.', 'Try the ESPNU version if you have access to that (I’m seeing both as options on the app on my phone). The ESPN2 version gave me an error but the ESPNU version worked\xa0', 'I would second the commenter who said to subscribe to f1 tv pro, but if you have kids or others in the house who would watch the content, Disney+ has a bundle that incudes Hulu and EPSN+.', 'There was probably something else slotted at that time.

1go1ra3,Obvious answer but imma ask anyways.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1go1ra3/obvious_answer_but_imma_ask_anyways/,2024-11-10, Discussion,"So the manufacturers that have lmgt3,wec, etc teams in racing for manufacturers such as ferrari with there af corsa and McLaren with there united autos ports, do you think they relay track information back to the manufacturers to implement on there f1 strategies? If so why don't other teams and manufacturers invest in other class races since they usually hit the track before f1 does?","['No considering those cars are completely different in everything. From obviously power units, aero, chasis, suspension, TIRES, eeeeverything. Obviously another thing is f1 extreme downforce car while for example GT3s are way less downforce class, therefore their style of driving and overall approach on the track is way different. Hypercars/lmdhs are slightly closer but still its night and day. Tires are massive difference so any pace testing is worthless and even if they would be the same weight difference between classes would polute the data. Only data they could get is maybe temps? But that is such a unreliable day to day variable that is different per weekend.', 'Maybe they release track data, but doubtful anything performance centric is shared. Different cars, different tyres, different weight and measures.', 'There is nothing to be gained from a Hypercar or GT3 programme that relates in any way, shape or form to an F1 project. Absolutely nothing.', ""That's what I was thinking. Wide data that'd be implemented and multiplied for the f1 cars. I mean every little bump or so forth on a track surface I'd be looking at since that would effect downforce and so on.

As much data goes intonf1 cars you'd think they'd take whatever they can get and multiply it."", 'I do mean literally track characteristics and not track handling of one sport of cars to another. Other series take various lines, they brake differently, hit apices different, drive on different segments of track. Suspensions are vastly different. Tyre footprints are much different.\n\n\n\nI\'m talking about whether the track is abrassive against all tyres, or lap times improved at certain track temperatures, or if venue maitenance modified the surface anywhere. Tracks like CotA where they patch and grind and lay asphalt seasonally because the summer to winter heat changes the track so much. It\'s not relative for the WEC groups to give car performance to an F1 team, but if they want to say, ""They set new tarmac from turn 4 to 5,"" that would be relevant.', 'That’s all public knowledge', 'Yeah but all of those you can find on the internet lol.', 'Agreed. I live 30 min from Cota. Shit is crazy since they redid the track with my e36. It was just a honest question.']",0,12,0.13,0,11,11,0,1,0.03,0
