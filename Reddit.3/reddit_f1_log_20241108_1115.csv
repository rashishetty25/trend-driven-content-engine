But bear in mind that, while I have the data for e.g. when wet tires were used during a GP, and how many red flags occurred, the rule we have for tracking tire usage is that if a single driver leaves the pits on wet tires, the whole race is flagged as 'wet' in our data.  Same thing for ints, if wets weren't used, but someone bolts on ints, the whole race is 'int'. Otherwise it's 'dry'. But I can't correlate the data between the weather conditions, the tires and any red flags that occurred (e.g. it may have been heavy rain for half of the race, but the red flags may have occurred in the dry, for all I know). However:\n\nIn the last four years (2021-2024):  \n\\- There were seven GPs that had at least one red flag when only dry tires were used  \n\\- There were two GPs that had at least one red flag when ints were used at some point  \n\\- There were four GPs that had at least one red flag when wets were used at some point  \n\\- There were five GPs that had NO red flags, but where ints were used  \n\\- There was one GP that had NO red flags, but where wets were used\n\nSo yeah, statistically 4/5 times that the wet tires were used there was a red flag during that GP.  \nAnd 5/7 times that the int tires were used, there was a red flag during the GP.  \nSo 9/12 times that drivers moved off of the dry tires, there has indeed been a red flag (3/4s of the time). But that's 9/19 times that a red flag was shown in a GP in total (less than half), so how much the wet weather tires contribute to red flags is hard to interpret.

Webber fumbled 2010. People love to judge drivers who are super fast, but make occasional errors, rather than slightly slower drivers.\xa0', ""If you've followed the sport for even just a few years, you know that he's obviously not. His WDC challenge fell off a cliff and he made some mistakes, but he's hardly out there Maldonadoing himself out of races, four top teams are all relatively close in terms of performance (which is double the norm), and he's up against *Max Verstappen*. Lando entered new territory for himself this season, and while it didn't ultimately go the way he wanted it to, I think he'll come back stronger from it if McLaren can continue this momentum into 2025. Of course, he'll have to worry about Piastri then as well since he'll up his game a lot in his third season as well."", ""I think Perez in 2023 was the worst title contender.\n\n(I'm responding to journo bullshit with more journo bullshit)\n\nHe was declared a title contender in 2023 after his Miami win and then got utterly crushed for the rest of the season and the entirety of 2024 and he's still getting battered with barely making it into Q2 and fighting for 1 or 2 points every race."", ""That's not really a question you can realistically answer. What is a championship contender? There's no objective ruling. And there's almost an obligation to mention Kiki Rosberg winning one race in his championship season. \n\nI do question the quality of Lando and whether he fits alongside Max/Lewis/Charles but it's a silly way for someone to say it."", 'No, he’s not even close. In recent years Vettel’s 2018 was poor, Webber’s 2010 was mediocre, Massa was incredibly error prone in 2008, as was Montoya in 2003. Hakkinen won in 1999 but made really hard work of it.\n\nI don’t even particularly like Norris, but the hate towards him has been so overboard lately. For all his flaws (racecraft, starts), he’s still easily outperformed Piastri, and he hasn’t made too many huge errors. The fact he’s 60 points behind in the championship is more down to Verstappen being outstanding than Norris being especially poor.', ""No, but he's not a great either"", 'Personally I felt this article was a good bit too harsh on a driver who hadn’t even won a race going into this season. When we look back beating Max Verstappen during his peak WDC years will look to have been as difficult as it is - almost impossible, even in a second-best car. It’s been a tough end to the chase under intense scrutiny but overall I think Norris can be proud of the season, though I would say he needs to secure P2 and McLaren the WCC in order to be really happy with it.', 'Bit of an extreme take to say ""worst championship rival ever"". If he helps McLaren win the Constructor\'s, it\'s still a good season and I think the team haven\'t helped with their own variety of strategy errors. But I agree he\'s made missteps in what was a very competitive field where 4 teams have had race winning cars in the last 6 months and that now it\'s all-but over, he needs to go away and be better for 2025 to capitalise if McLaren still have a grid-leading car']",0,80,0.31,0,77,77,0,80,0.31,0
