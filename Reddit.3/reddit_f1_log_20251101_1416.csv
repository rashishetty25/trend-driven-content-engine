1oky2j2,"Lawson ""not at fault"" for marshal incident says FIA following criticism from Mexico's OMDAI",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oky2j2/lawson_not_at_fault_for_marshal_incident_says_fia/,2025-10-31, News,,"['I have seen a lot of stuff saying he should have steered to avoid:\n\nHim not moving off his line was unironically the smartest thing he could do. Moving in a predicable way is the best way the Marshalls could avoid him.', 'Rare FIA W', 'For the few that needed to hear it\n\n>“Having analysed the telemetry from the incident, we can confirm that the driver of car number 30, Liam Lawson, slowed appropriately and reacted correctly to the double yellow flags displayed in the area, braking earlier than in other laps and passing significantly slower than racing speed into turn one. He is not at fault in this incident.', 'Blaming Lawson for this incident was always plain stupid and evidence of shirking responsibility for a major safety breach. \n\nFigure out what happened, who is responsible, hold them accountable and improve the process so this never ever happens again.', ""Look, I'm rarely a conspiracy theorist, but 100% OMDAI did it to take the blame off themselves and put it on someone that the Mexican general opinion already sees as an enemy easy to hate for taking Checo's seat."", 'No shit . Crazy people even think it was his', ""Wait were people really suggesting that Lawson was at fault for this? That has to be one of the dumbest takes I've seen in all my years following the sport"", ""It was a massive reach from OMDAI in trying place the blame on Lawson when there was a clear miscommunication on circuit with the marshalling. While marshals can be working under a double waved yellow, they're usually tending to a stricken vehicle, or remaining stationery when cars are passing through the area. Don't think I've ever seen them, the modern era, running around like headless chooks, crossing the circuit. Lawson did everything right, he slowed right down, and held a predictable line."", 'Cleared by the FIA, yet so many people were adamant he did not slow enough or that the Mexican federation was right… oh well. I guess some people really take anything they can to justify the hate on a driver they already dislike. That federation should be ashamed of their own accusation tbh, that situation could have been horrifying.', 'Yeah, no shit. But yesterday when the first post about this came out, there were intellectuals actually that it is his fault.']",2346,88,0.99,2346,5973,5973,39,3,0.0,39
1okxpml,McLaren garages continue to share data with each other amidst championship battle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1okxpml/mclaren_garages_continue_to_share_data_with_each/,2025-10-31, Video,"Tom Stallard, Oscar Piastri's race engineer says in an interview: ""All the data is available to both cars.

Not great from a fan perspective but great from a team perspective.', 'All teams share data 100% of the time. This will always be the case in the modern era. It would be impossible not to share data across drivers for any given team in F1. I’m unsure why this notion arises from time to time. I’ve worked in F1 for many years across multiple teams and data sharing is always the standard of operation. \nData is also shared across different F1 teams within the PU manufacturers. In the PU scenario, this is primarily concerning PU data but chassis data is also shared in many cases (gearbox is considered chassis).', 'where are all the guys who came up with 1000000 reasons convincing people here they are not sharing anything?', 'I mean they literally asked Norris for advice on what tires to use for Piastri, there is more rivalry between 2 babies fighting over a toy than between these 2.', ""I know there's some speculation that they stopped doing this after the constructors' was wrapped up but I kind of always assumed they were still sharing the same amount of information between garages, for better or for worse. Maybe neither one of them is completely showing their full hand in practices, but to me they just seem like they have different ways of operating. Lando seems to dive right in to finding the limit of the car, I think it's why we see him topping FP1 so often. Oscar seems to work by building up marginally throughout the weekend. Neither approach is right or wrong, it just seems to be what works for each of them. It will be interesting to see how they both manage the very fine margins in these last 4 races, especially given that two of them are sprint weekends with limited practice time."", 'I mean. Duh.
