Slow down and ready to stop the car"", but it doesn't indicate how serious it may be. It may be a car stopping on run off area, or just a mirror on the other side of the track. To be honest, if it's very serious, it would have been instantly red flagged.

As we know, drivers needs to lift ""significantly"" when they saw double yellow, or it will be 10s stop-and-go penalty. However, F1 cars (or even F2) are still travelling at 250kph or higher even if you lift.
No one can stop the car at 250kph or even react to human on track if they exist at blind spot. At this point we are just waiting for disasters to happen.
If you think Lawson today is close to hitting marshalls, go to watch how Victor Martins nearly missed 2 marshalls in F2 Monaco 2023, that's literally an inch away from disaster. Yes I know Martins ignored double yellow there, but had he know there are human on track he will definitely slow down massively.

Next corner Turn 4, Hamilton tried to take back the position (*legally*) on track, tried to overtake him from the outside, but ran out of road and space, locked up and then took the escape route but not correctly - ***which not one would be able to do because of the nature of that route. It\'s way too narrow and you cannot expect a driver to break, turn and follow that narrow path like that*** \\- another unfair review (*even though dismissed as no further investigation later*) noted by the stewards claiming that ""***Car 44 failed to follow the race directors instructions on Escape route***"".\n3. Justification from the stewards for the penalty?! - ***He gained an advantage leaving the track. Another Bullshit from the stewards***. **Yes he gained about 2 secs over the pack behind, but why - Verstappen again was not able to keep the car on track for Turn 5 and tried to cover up Russell but forced him off-track as well (*****again neither a penalty nor a review for this*****)** and this opened door for Bearman to take a place, which he took rightfully and legally on track.\n\n**Fuck your FIA 😤😡🤬🤦🏻\u200d♂️**']",51,81,0.72,51,80,80,6,12,0.010000000000000009,6

1oh7gaq,Jenson Button's 2010 'Butterfly Effect' Rewrote F1 History,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oh7gaq/jenson_buttons_2010_butterfly_effect_rewrote_f1/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"A single driver move in 2010 changed the trajectory of multiple champions and the dynamics of the entire grid. When Jenson Button, fresh off his championship win with Brawn GP (the team that became Mercedes), opted for McLaren, he set off a chain of events that defined the next decade of F1.
What if Button had stayed?
Button at Mercedes (the dominant era): Button, with his smooth style and skill, would have had a second golden opportunity. He likely would have won multiple championships in the hybrid era, much like Lewis Hamilton.
Hamilton at McLaren: Without Button, Lewis's story with McLaren would have continued. He might have stayed longer, but it's unlikely he would have tolerated the McLaren-Honda disaster. His frustration would have pushed him to seek another top team, like Ferrari, completely changing his trajectory.
Vettel at Red Bull: Sebastian Vettel's frustration with Mercedes' dominance was the main reason for his departure to Ferrari in 2014. With Button at the wheel of the dominant Mercedes, Vettel might have hung on longer at Red Bull. This would have affected the rise of other drivers, like Sergio Pérez and Max Verstappen.
Verstappen's rise delayed: With Vettel still at Red Bull, the opportunity for Max Verstappen wouldn't have come so quickly. Max's meteoric rise, with his 2016 victory, would likely have been delayed by several years.
Ferrari and other teams: If Pérez had signed with Ferrari (a real possibility in 2013), the team's lineup would have been very different. Also, Nico Rosberg's retirement after the intense rivalry with Hamilton never would have happened, so Bottas wouldn't have arrived at Mercedes in 2017.


Without Jenson Button we would never have seen the dominance of Hamilton or Max Verstappen, nor Alonso in the Honda era, nor even Vettel at Ferrari, nor the retirement of Rosberg and the signing of Bottas at Mercedes.So obviously events from 2010 to 2025 would never have happened but anyway what do you think? 


","['Lot of assumptions in there. Would Button have retained his seat through the hybrid era? Especially if Vettel or Hamilton came knocking. Could Button have seen off the challenge from Rosberg? Verstappen was originally a Mercedes driver - Wolff had no place for him back when he had Hamilton-Rosberg in the team, but what if it was a Rosberg-Button lineup?\n\nFact is, Button had quite a few hiccups even during his 2009 run to the title. He was never as highly rated in the paddock as the likes of Hamilton, Alonso & Vettel - and the elite drivers will usually have a hotline to the best teams and vice versa.', 'A lot of big driver moves honestly do shake things up.

If my mom had balls…', 'You can do that with a lot of big driver moves.', ""If it's that obvious what would've happened, why didn't Button simply stay at McLaren???"", ""Button would have needed to beat Rosberg during the run up to 2013.

1ogkagc,Data Analysis & Prediction for 2025 Mexican GP (Showing the Work This Time!),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ogkagc/data_analysis_prediction_for_2025_mexican_gp/,2025-10-26, Technical,"Hey everyone,

After my last analysis on Sainz's Singapore stint got some (deservedly) critical feedback here about not explaining the ""how"" and using ""voodoo math,"" I wanted to share my prediction attempt for the **2025 Mexican GP** using a more transparent, data-driven approach.

This isn't a fancy ML model, just core data analysis using Python/FastF1 to calculate key performance factors and simulate a prediction based on weighted scores. The goal is to show the data behind the ranking.

**Data & Features Used:**

1. **Adjusted Grid:** Used official Quali results + applied the confirmed **+5 place penalty for Sainz**. 

https://preview.redd.it/8nu1o7nzegxf1.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2313fe74f661e5811dab258fa45aa14eddef7b3

1. **FP2 Long Run Pace:** Calculated average pace from FP2 Medium tyre stints (5-10 laps), making sure to filter out in/out laps (`pick_quicklaps`). 

https://preview.redd.it/4rs1drstegxf1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4e6b591ca7189b6d9670b20a1cb40d6e08469bc

1. **FP2 Tyre Degradation:** Calculated the linear degradation slope (s/lap increase) for the same FP2 stints using `numpy.polyfit`*.* 

&#8203;

    Average Tyre Degradation Slope per Driver (s/lap):
    HAM   -0.248982
    ANT    0.101776
    VER    0.155473
    LEC    0.241527
    RUS    0.382383

1. **Track History:** Average finishing position at this track (2021-2024), excluding DNFs.

**The Numbers:**

    NOR                   32.6%  
    HAM                   25.7%  
    LEC                   21.3%  
    RUS                    7.7%  
    VER                    6.7%  

**Why the Simulation Ranks Them This Way:**

* The data simulation points towards **Lando Norris (NOR)** as the favorite (32.6%) mainly because **starting on Pole Position gives him a significant advantage** according to the weights used. While his FP2 long run wasn't long enough to calculate specific pace/degradation, the model imputes competitive median values, which aren't enough to overcome the benefit of starting P1.
* **Lewis Hamilton (HAM)** looks strong (25.7%) primarily due to **showing the potentially fastest average long-run pace in FP2**. However, the simulation slightly penalizes him for starting further back (P5) compared to Norris. *(Note: His FP2 degradation data also looked unusual with very short stints, adding some uncertainty).*
* **Charles Leclerc (LEC)** is predicted third (21.3%), benefiting from a **strong P3 start**. His main limiting factor in the simulation is his **higher expected tyre degradation** based on the FP2 analysis, potentially forcing a less optimal strategy compared to the leaders.
* **Worth noting:** **Carlos Sainz (SAI)** put in a solid qualifying effort (P7), but his **+5 grid place penalty** significantly impacts his starting position (P12) and therefore heavily lowers his predicted win probability in this simulation, despite potentially decent underlying pace metrics.

Crucially, this ranking explains the ""how"" the prediction was reached: it's the result of **combining these specific, calculated metrics** (Adjusted Grid Position, FP2 Avg Pace, FP2 Avg Degradation, Historical Finish) using the described weighted simulation. Different weights or models would yield different results, but this shows the logic based on *this* analysis.

**Limitations:** Obviously, this doesn't account for the start, strategy genius/blunders, safety cars, reliability, etc. It's purely based on the performance data we have *before* the race.

Let me know what you think of the data and the approach this time! Did I miss anything obvious? Who's your pick? Suggest any platforms for publishing blogs/ advices welcome on how to write blogs since I didn't do very well last time.

Here's the link: [MexicanGP'25](https://github.com/gantayat03/MexicanGP-25)","[""I'm not seeing the value here. You've grabbed the qualifying positions and some FP data, made up a few weights, and calculated win probabilities? That doesn't show anything -- I can add up whatever values I want and predict a winner.\xa0\n\n\nWhere's the work to show that there's any efficacy in this approach to begin with?\xa0Surely the first step would be to take these same parameters, and then apply the model to every completed race in the season and then compare your prediction versus the actual result.\xa0"", 'Cool stuff. Any reason to use Pip instead of uv? uv is superior these days imo. I took a quick look at the code, looks good. Bit of AI agent code going on here? few things looked odd.

As for the model stuff, id have to think about it. Idk the best way to do this  with this data. ive tried it before and wasnt ever happy with it', 'Bro is competing with AWS for which is the more useless graphic \n\nAnd i think bro is winning!', ""I agree, there just isn't enough data points in this. Model has no clue how good (or bad) these drivers are on race starts, driving style (who is more aggressive wheel to wheel), what weather is gonna be like, what are race strategy options, what are the top speeds of different cars, how easy/hard it is to overtake on this track etc..."", 'Sure, but all that is secondary to the bigger point that the model has no clue how accurate it is, which is easily tested by applying it to any previous race.\xa0', ""No model will have this. Even the best state of the art models that teams are using won't have all of this information."", ""Of course, which is why if you did want to do this (admittedly imperfect) exercise you'd start by applying your predictions on past races and use the deviations to point you in the direction of which data points are more accurately predictive.\xa0\n\n\nOP is skipping all the work and just producing meaningless charts and numbers.\xa0""]",7,7,0.61,7,27,27,1,0,0.010000000000000009,1
