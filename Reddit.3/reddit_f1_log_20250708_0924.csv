Yesterday's British GP, the twelfth out of twenty-four scheduled, confirmed that the World Championship is a matter between the two McLaren drivers\n\nThe Race had a good story on RBR, that throughout 2025 they've (on the ground, in person, off the record) been very bullish that the Spain TD would bring McLaren back down to earth, and the title was still on - and as the year's gone on, that bullishness has gotten consistently more modest. \n\nIt seems a lot like RBR (and others) hopes were pinned on Spain, and clearly that was a non-story ultimately, as McLaren continue to chalk up *30 second victories*."", 'Ferrari have been Ferraris biggest issue.

Consistency is needed: hiring Lewis – who has won seven Drivers' World Championships since 2008 while Ferrari has won zero in the meantime – means accepting, and therefore embracing, his vision of work and the car. Those who want everything immediately, and don't understand how F1 works, consider his difficulties with a car that's too inconsistent in its behavior as a consequence of the decline of a former champion. But what the Englishman has been preaching for a while – since he assessed the situation at Maranello – is a change of philosophy, a less extreme future project, with a good aerodynamic base capable of making life easier for the drivers, who are not lacking in talent. This would be as essential as bread for Leclerc too, who through frustrations and suffering has come to humiliate himself (Saturday after qualifying)\n\nDont think this is an unreasonable take, Lewis has been talking for weeks now how theres a lot of things that need to change at Ferrari to become championship contenders,  that they need to have a solid foundation and that hes working with fred to see that happen. Also talked about it yesterday too after the race on the fan stage that theres a lot of work being done behind the scenes at Ferrari and wishes he could tell people whats going on"", 'finally... i genuinely thought Hamilton was going to be vilified byt the Italian media.... im so glad they are accepting that ferrari can ""be at fault"".\n\nfirst step... get rid of Hamiltons radio man', 'Should go without saying.

Afterward, he said he only saw the red rear light at the last moment—too late to react.

**That made me wonder: why do F1 rain lights still blink during heavy spray?**

In light rain, blinking might help grab attention. But in dense spray, the off-moments make the car ahead briefly invisible, which is exactly when you need to see it. A solid, constantly lit rain light would likely be more visible through the mist, even if less “attention-grabbing” on paper.

According to older threads and technical docs, the rain light flashes at ~4Hz in wet conditions and ~2Hz during ERS harvesting, but a solid mode does exist (like during pit limiter). Why not use it when visibility is at its worst?

With wet races becoming more common, shouldn't the FIA consider making the rain light stay on instead of flashing in extreme spray?","[""A blinking or strobing light demands your attention, a single continuous light would eventually start being ignored because it's there constantly.

I see everyone is comparing George's 30 psi (in the dry) to Oscar's 60 psi (in the wet) and saying Oscar 'stopped twice as quick'. From my understanding, this is not accurate. I am under the assumption a better metric that the FIA would use as a baseline or threshold would be to look at the deceleration values?

Obviously Oscar shedding the 100mph was significant, but the timing in which he does so should be mentioned also and used as part of the baseline.

Typically, when a car needs to brake for a corner, the driver slams on the brakes quite hard and then gradually releases. That\'s kinda the opposite of what you (should) do in a road car.\n\nI can\'t find good data on how much psi F1 brakes do, but apparently it can be up to 2000 psi? So 30 or 60 really is not much, definitely not proper corner braking, more like gentle slowing down like in a road car.\n\nI guess that\'s why the McL people were saying it just looks more dramatic on TV due to how fast the cars are and how the brakes work.\n\nIn that context, Russell\'s 30 psi makes even more sense that he was just warming them up, even if it looked like hard braking to us.\n\nAs for the rain, I\'m not too sure but I\'d guess that\'s the same like in a road car. If you brake too hard, the guy behind you is more likely to ram you even if the overall braking distance is longer, so braking inherently carries more risk. I also imagine F1 drivers are more gentle on the brakes in the rain to keep better control, so maybe even 60 psi is into the ""don\'t do that"" territory in the rain.\n\nBut I\'ve also seen an explanation that the main difference between Russell\'s and Piastri\'s situation was that Russel was still behind an active SC with its lights on, while Piastri was essentially under racing conditions with him controlling the speed, not the SC. So it was his responsibility to not do anything that can be seen as erratic.\n\nNote: I\'m not an F1 driver', 'Just have to let the Brit win. \n\nHe literally got the same penalty Max got for banzaiing into another car on purpose.']",0,17,0.38,0,93,93,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0

1. Mercedes - Even without verstappen merc look strong and with the new regs looking engine focused they may well be top of the field.

2. Aston Martin - Aston will unquestionable have the best chassis thanks to newey but honda look to be struggling slightly with the new regs although they are very good at making hybrid engines so may be pushing for title (alonso 3rd wdc???)

3. Ferrari - Will have a strong package like always, not having to switch to single turbo will give them slight advantage

4. Mclaren - Strong podium contender but given there extreme development to secure title this year it may be hard for them to compete for titles in coming years however the merc engine will work well for them

5. Williams - will be close with mclaren due to williams ignoring this year to focus on next regs and also having the merc engine, will have disadvantage due to lack of funding

6. Red Bull - Implosion for red bull with verstappens departure seeming iminent, newey wheatley leaving and horner may be out aswell, the switch to full works team may disadvantage them.

7. Alpine - Merc engine will be only saviour of this car

8. Haas - probably will have better aero and chassis than alpine but the new regs are mainly engine focused

9. Cadillac - New team so has catching up to do although will be working all throughout this year to try and catch up

10. Audi - Already struggling with engine will make them slow to start the new season

11. VCARB - just a worse version of the red bull
