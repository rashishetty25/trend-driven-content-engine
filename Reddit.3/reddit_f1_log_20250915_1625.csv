There goes his only good race in the last 20...', 'This was such a painful thing to watch.  Carlos could‚Äôve had a podium after a bad streak and Checo could‚Äôve had an amazing performance to ‚Äúsave‚Äù his season but they both were too tunnel-visioned on staying in Charles‚Äôs slipstream to get P2 that they forgot they were racing each other.  At least Carlos finished the season strong with some podiums but damn poor Checo.\n\nSo many people were like ‚Äúso-and-so turned into each him‚Äù but in reality neither of them did.  Their lines were straight but not parallel, so they inevitably hit.  The problem was that Carlos started slowly drifting towards Checo (I don‚Äôt think Carlos was trying to be aggressive, his confusion on the radio makes me think he just had a lapse of judgement and was too focused on following Charles‚Äôs slipstream), and Checo had more than enough time to react but didn‚Äôt.  Carlos started the incident, and Checo finished it.\n\nI wish Carlos was more patient and didn‚Äôt try to overtake Charles at the moment because it jeopardized his exit out of the turn, making him end up ahead of Checo but not fully in front where he could defend better.  With how much Charles‚Äôs tyres were degraded it would actually have been good for Carlos to pass Charles, but that was not the right moment to do so.  At the same time, I do think there was a brief opportunity for Carlos to pass Charles but Charles ended up veering to the right to complete the turn and squeezed Carlos a bit (not Charles‚Äôs fault, just purely circumstantial).\n\nAnd ngl, the sun on that straight looked horrible for visibility.  I wonder if that played a role in their slow reactions.', 'We‚Äôre heading into the wall!', 'Such a silly thing that both drivers could and should have avoided.\n\nEspecially painful for Perez with his one good performance in many months that could have been a bit of light in his depressing stint, which turned out to be even more depressing than usual.', ""Still wondering whether checo could've been given another year had he got that podium."", 'Baku never disappoints‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like Monaco‚Äôs chaotic cousin.', 'Forgot the Red Bull was actually good there last year', 'Leclerc and Piastri fighting cleanly for half the race and then these two did this within three turns. \n\nThe one race where Perez was going to outperform Max. Was 50/50, racing incident that will happen with stuff like sunlight, etc.', 'Leclerc not defending and Carlos crashing with Perez is more than enough point swing that could have earned Ferrari their 2024 WCC title.']",35,20,0.93,35,19,19,35,20,0.93,35

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

I‚Äôm planning to go to my first F1 Grand Prix with my family, and we‚Äôve decided that Hungary looks like a great one to visit.   
  
Since it‚Äôs our first time, I‚Äôm not too sure which experiences are genuinely worth it versus just overpriced extras or even if using the official website is the best choice.

Obviously, the prop car isn‚Äôt going to compete with real F1 cars‚Äîthe R&D is nowhere near the level of even the worst F1 car, the engine isn‚Äôt as powerful, etc. But how do you think it would compare to an F2 car? Like, I read that the bodywork was primarily carbon fibre, and the fact that they were trying to build bodywork to look like an F1 car and at least somewhat fit with FIA F1 aero regulations makes me wonder if maybe it had superior aerodynamics to the average F2 car? And that combined with having the same engine makes me wonder if it would perform above the level of an F2 car, at least around the corners.","['They fitted plenty of cameras in it, that is the reason they choose F2 cars over F1 cars.\n\nSo probably, AXGP cars will much slower than regular F2 cars', 'It would be slower. While the aero they added was ""real"" (i.e. it generated useful amounts of downforce), it was not remotely optimized to reduce drag. So the net result is a car that is heavier and draggier than an F2 car, but using an F2 engine.\n\nSam Collins did an interesting interview with the vehicle coordinator for the movie talking about how they built the cars (including the electric version they used for the pit lane shots).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tv\\_W8ZLndM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tv_W8ZLndM)', ""I reckon it'll be slower.

I would be shocked if the APX car had properly executed ground effect like current gen F2 cars, and the overbody aero is much less thought through than the 2018 gen F2s\n\nand even if the APX did have more downforce than current F2s, there's no telling how well it handles aero in corners, dirty air or cross winds, or if it has too much drag for what that engine can pull"", 'If you‚Äôre ever near an Apple Store, go do the Vision Pro demo where they have a ride along with Brad Pitt driving the car.
