The effect is that important differences could be generated, moving what should return to being a championship of power units, a F1 of gasoline.\n\nThe search for chemical additives that can act as effective anti-knock agents, allowing for higher compression ratios in combustion engines, is leading some groups to seek partnerships with small, ultra-specialized centers capable of coming up with novel solutions.\n\nIt should not be surprising that in the budget cap of engines the cost of a liter of e-fuel was calculated at 200 euros. This figure is to be drastically reduced (150 euros?), introducing important bans on additive substances.
