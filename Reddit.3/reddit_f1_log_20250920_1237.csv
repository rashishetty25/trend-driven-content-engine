1nlt8gr,Can someone explain to me why Bearman was considered at fault in Italian GP Lap 41 and not Sainz?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nlt8gr/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_bearman_was/,2025-09-20, Discussion,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm new to F1 and didn‚Äôt quite understand this.

So I assumed Sainz was at fault until I heard about the 10-second penalty given to Bearman. Could someone please explain why the stewards decided this way?","[""So the racing guidelines are quite clear on who's entitled to space when. The car that gets to the apex of the corner first is entitled to all the space they want. Since Sainz got to the apex first, or in the mind of the stewards, was ahead going to the apex, any contact will be the fault of the other car. \n\nMost people, myself included, think this is an awful way to police incidents and racing in general.
