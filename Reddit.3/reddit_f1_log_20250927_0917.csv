1nqwrcl,[Lewis Hamilton on Instagram] Update on Roscoe‘s health; full caption in the body of this post,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nqwrcl/lewis_hamilton_on_instagram_update_on_roscoes/,2025-09-26, Social Media,> Please keep Roscoe in your thoughts. I want to keep you all updated. Roscoe caught pneumonia again and was struggling to breathe. He was admitted into hospital and sedated to calm him while they did checks on him and during the process his heart stopped. They managed to get a heartbeat back and now he's in a coma. We don't know whether he will wake from this. Tomorrow we'll try to wake him up. I'm by his side and want to thank you all for your prayers and support.,"[""That's one lucky dog, no doubt getting the best care possible. You can tell Lewis adores him, when I saw him at Silverstone after he won in 2024 he brought Roscoe out onto the stage to celebrate with him. Was always checking on him to make sure he was okay on stage.\n\n\nIf he sadly never wakes, that dog has had a life most humans would envy. While it'll be devastating for Lewis, hoping he can take some solaces in knowing how much of an amazing life he gave to him."", 'I remember when he lost Coco, unbelievably devastating for Lewis now Roscoe is like this.
