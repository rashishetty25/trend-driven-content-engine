Who do you think performed better between these two over the season?\n\nSimilarly, in 2003, the championship came down to Raikkonen vs Schumacher. Which driver performed better?\n\n2006 was a titanic battle between Schumacher and Alonso. One of my fave seasons. Same question: who do you think performed best between these two?', 'Is Monaco the hardest circuit?', 'Is there any yt vid that explains the differential, brake bias etc...?', 'this is such a long shot but i‚Äôm honestly a bit desperate lol, does anyone know if there‚Äôs somewhere i can access the channel 4 race coverage from 2016-18? specifically the races with susie wolff as an analyst lol? if anyone has any leads, ideas or links i would be forever grateful \U0001fa77', ""Bit of a random question but life circumstances meant I wasn't able to see the final two races of the year until today, and as such was unable to follow the discussion about them. How were they generally received? The penalty decisions seemed very extreme and the AD race felt like the best showing I had seen on that circuit."", 'Sooo when will we see lewis in rosso corsa for the first time?', 'Is there no alternative to a generator that would allow cars to recover energy through the front wheels? This way, energy could still be recovered without an increase in weight.', '\nI‚Äôll answer 2006 first as its easiest: Alonso was better. Both hit absurdly high heights as shown by Fernando in Hungary and Michael in China and Brazil. The difference is that over the course of the season, Michael made three critical mistakes, or two in Australia and Hungary and then Monaco qualifying you can describe as you wish if ‚Äòmistake‚Äô does not fit. Alonso basically made no mistakes at all aside from Hungary practice, which he completely cancelled out with IMO the best drive of his career. It‚Äôs incredible to think Michael is the one who made the mistakes despite the mass damper ban and the Monza farce applying enormous pressure on Alonso. It‚Äôs probably safe to say the Renault was the quicker car before the damper ban and Ferrari the quicker after it, particularly given how Alonso couldn‚Äôt match Massa at several mid-to-late races. People will always talk about Japan, but to me, that race simply gave back what Hungary took away.\n\n2003 is a hard year to assess on the basis of there being so many moving goalposts. To me, that is Raikkonen‚Äôs best year and Schumacher‚Äôs worst championship-contending year. Even then, Kimi made two critical mistakes in qualifying in Spain and Canada, with the former leading to a start-line crash that was arguably avoidable. I think if we look at Kimi‚Äôs career in general we can see circumstances made him look better than he really was at McLaren and it is hard to see any reality where he beats Michael in anything approaching an equal car, but I need to go back and really dissect 2003 in isolation, which I‚Äôve yet to do since watching it for the first time a few months back.\n\n1999 is the hardest to answer - warning, lengthy dissection incoming‚Ä¶\n\nComparing Hakkinen and Irvine on any basis is tough because there‚Äôs no reliable basis on which to compare them. They were never team-mates nor shared any common team-mate besides Herbert, and Mika was alongside him in a year where he was absolutely rubbish in the first half of the season as he was seemingly still learning his craft. So all you have to go on is the eye test and your perception of car performance.\n\n1999 is even harder to assess because there were variables similar to those in 2003 - the driver widely perceived as better had a down year and the one perceived as inferior had arguably their best year. But that‚Äôs not the only variable in 1999. For all Irvine looked like he improved, it‚Äôs really hard to say how much he improved because Schumacher wasn‚Äôt around for a good chunk of the races. Reliability and luck also played an enormous role - Hakkinen had three failures while leading and a fourth race where he got punted by his team-mate at the first corner. Assuming Hakkinen would have gone on to win those races, that‚Äôs a 46-point swing that fell in Irvine‚Äôs favour. If just two of those four races occur differently, you‚Äôre no longer asking the question.\n\nOf course, the hypotheticals don‚Äôt make the question any less legitimate - all they mean is that Hakkinen missed out on the chance to win races in the fastest car, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make him the superior driver to Irvine that year. So at that point, you really have to rely on a wider context and your general perceptions from other years to form an opinion on 1999.\n\nMy take on Irvine is that his time at Ferrari was unkind to him. He looks a good chunk worse than Barrichello relative to Schumacher, but if you compare him to Barrichello both at Jordan (mainly in 1995) and relative to Herbert in 1999 and 2000, Irvine looks much closer to Rubens than their Ferrari careers indicate. \n\nMy understanding that Eddie was hampered by a lack of testing early on and the team‚Äôs reliance on Michael to help get them back on track after the disaster that was the F310. To me, this checks out with Eddie‚Äôs form throughout his four years - there were two versions of him; one was miles off the pace and the other looked much more like an asset as a #2 to Michael. 99 to me we saw more of the latter than in any other year, only in Brazil and Japan did Michael throughly trounce him in the manner seen much more often in prior years.\n\nThe problem with assessing Eddie from Silverstone onwards is we have no reference point for him until Michael came back in Malaysia, so we have no idea if the fluctuations from him were due to him or the car. Take Hungary where he was 35 seconds behind Mika before he fell off the road and handed second to DC. Was he doing an exceptional job holding that place or would Michael have showed the car was actually a bit better? I could argue Eddie was the variable on the basis he gave Mika a hard time at a similar circuit earlier that year in Monaco, but the general trends of 1999 would say otherwise. There is absolutely no proof either way. I can‚Äôt prove if Michael would‚Äôve been sailing into the distance at Silverstone while Eddie was keeping Mika honest early on, so do I just assume Eddie had a really good day? I can‚Äôt prove how bad Eddie finishing behind Frentzen at Spa looked, so do I just assume he had a bad day?\n\nI think the fact I‚Äôm asking these questions of Eddie in what I consider to be his best year tells me all I need to know. If we look at his Jordan years, we know he fluctuated in performance relative to Barrichello, there were a fair number of races even in 95 he was quite far behind. I rarely asked questions like this of Mika; for his mistakes in 99, he had two seasons with several less errors either side of that year and even if you don‚Äôt think he was that great and he was flattered by his car, he very much took his opportunity to look great, which we simply can‚Äôt say about Eddie. I guess 99 specifically I would give to Mika on a benefit-of-the-doubt basis.', '1999 H√§kkinen - neither of them deserved to win the championship that year tho. frentzen, barrichello and ralf schumacher all drove much better seasons that year.\n\n2003 R√§ikk√∂nen - both of them had amazing pace but schumacher did a number of mistakes (crashing into trulli in malaysia, crashing out in brazil, spinning at the n√ºrburgring,‚Ä¶). at the end of the season kimi was 2 points away from the title with the 3rd-best car. i think kimi‚Äôs performance that year is incredibly underrated.\n\n2006 Alonso - both of them were great that season but alonso was incredible throughout. renault only really had the best car for the first few races but alonso always got the maximum out of the car. schumi had a couple of races where he genuinely underperformed or made mistakes (australia, malaysia, hungary, turkey, monaco quali if you want to count that)', 'In 1999 Irvine was better and I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs particularly close. Even with the reliability issues McLaren were the better car.\n\n2003 is closer but I‚Äôd say Schumacher. Made some errors but his best drives were excellent and I‚Äôd say McLaren had the slightly better car across the season, although both were behind Williams.\n\n2006 I‚Äôd say Alonso. Both drivers performed at an extremely high level but Schumacher had a few mistakes or off weekends (Malaysia, Australia, Monaco, Hungary, Turkey) that Alonso didn‚Äôt really have bar USA and Hockenheim. I‚Äôd say Ferrari were very, very slightly ahead of Renault taking the whole year into account (although it was basically a season of two halves, with Renault well ahead in the first and Ferrari well ahead in the second).']",6,24,0.75,6,22,22,3,3,0.13,3
