Two experienced drivers are on the wish list. Nationality is not important for now. An American driver is no longer a requirement. General Motors has decided that performance is the priority. Only then will the goal of being a truly American team come into play.”\xa0\n\nPerez/Bottas all but confirmed them. I think that is the right decision. The last thing a new team needs is rookies crashing and especially in the era of the cost cap. And the main thing they need is experience on how to set up a car and getting two drivers who are not just experienced but have won every constructors championship from 2017-2023 between them is great for Cadillac.', 'Are they building their car for combat?', 'Audi and Cadillac occupying 19-22 grid spots at Melbourne 2026', 'Translation and full article: \n\n> **The clock is ticking for Cadillac. The new Formula 1 racing team is mobilizing on all fronts. The US team is growing. The engineers are developing the 2026 car, and the race crew is preparing for front-line action in the tactics room. We\'ll keep you updated on the latest developments.**\n\n> Cadillac has to face one question again and again: Why so early? Why is the American automaker launching its car in 2026 and not a year later? Why is General Motors launching its own engine in 2029 when it could wait until 2031, when the regulations might stipulate less complex drive systems?\n\n> The answer to the question is simple. Formula 1 wanted it that way. It\'s clearly a bit of a dig at the Americans, after the approval process cost so much energy. It\'s based on the motto: If they really want to be there, they should do it as soon as possible with the start of the new Concorde agreement.\n\n> Time pressure is the biggest problem for the newcomer. Cadillac only received the final approval from the FIA \u200b\u200bon March 7. Now, in almost exactly twelve months, a team must be built, the necessary infrastructure created, the processes synchronized, and a car developed and produced. That\'s an extremely tight deadline.\n\n> **First car is built in England.**\nAs of May, the Silverstone branch had 300 employees on the payroll. By the end of the year, that number is expected to rise to 500 to 600. It doesn\'t help that Audi is seeking the same specialists from the same catchment area for its Bicester branch. It\'s also a problem that poachers from other teams have work bans and won\'t be available until the fall.\n\n> General Motors currently employs around 100 people at its engine factory in Charlotte. This number will also have to expand rapidly, as three years of development time for such a complex powertrain passes in the blink of an eye. Russ O\'Blenes\' team can\'t build on past experience. Therefore, Cadillac engineers stepped on the gas with the prototype of the V6 turbo. The first example was already tested on the test bench the week after the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\n\n> The Cadillac F1 Team\'s new headquarters in Fishers near Indianapolis is scheduled to be operational by the second quarter of 2026 at the latest. To align the tight schedule with the factory\'s completion, the following master plan was established: The 2026 car will be built entirely in England, the 2027 car half in England and half in the USA, and from 2028 onwards, production will take place entirely at the headquarters in Fishers.\n\n> **Weight as a joker for Cadillac?**\nFor Cadillac, the 2026 Formula 1 season has already begun. All stress and crash tests have already been conducted on a test monocoque. The findings will then be incorporated into the carbon fiber tube that will form the basis of the 2026 car. Technical advisor Pat Symonds reveals that they plan to have most components ready two months earlier than usual to avoid taking any risks. Participation in the first test in January 2026 is mandatory for the newcomer. Every kilometer of experience counts.\n\n> The easiest way to gain ground against the established teams would be weight. Lowering the minimum weight to 770 kilograms opens up a third area, alongside aerodynamics and engine power, where you can differentiate yourself from your opponents. Hardly anyone will make the weight limit in the first year. Every kilogram less guarantees a better lap time.\n\n> The Ferrari engine is a constant. Compared to aerodynamics, weight seems like a more manageable area. But Symonds warns against underestimating it. ""As a newcomer, we have no reference point when it comes to weight. The established teams know how far they can go with every component because they\'ve done it hundreds of times before.""\n\n> **Problem with short-term rule changes.**\nAs with all other teams, the aerodynamic development is expected to be a precision landing. They\'re taking enough time to ensure the components are just ready for the first test and the season opener on March 8. Last-minute rule changes hit a new team harder than the well-established technical teams.\n\n> For example, this spring, the FIA \u200b\u200breduced the size of a fin in the lower section of the rear brake vents. A small change with a big impact. The fin helped seal the underbody between the rear wheel and the floorboard. To compensate, the ground clearance must be lowered again.\n\n> This means new wind tunnel test runs and new computational models for CFD simulation. Small teams with limited simulation tools are more severely affected by such short-term changes in direction than teams with 400 engineers and a fully equipped infrastructure. The lack of experience continues in other areas. The greatest need for improvement lies in aerodynamic elasticity – the keyword being flexi-wings – and the issue of how to control tire temperature via brake ventilation.\n\n> **Cadillac drives along in the factory.**\nIn parallel with the car\'s construction, Cadillac is working on its processes. Since the Spanish Grand Prix, a team of strategists has been based at the Silverstone factory, virtually driving through each race as if they were actually there. This is designed to refine the strategy programs and prepare the people at the control center for their tasks.\n\n> This fall, Cadillac plans to borrow a 2023 car from Ferrari and simulate races as part of TPC testing. This will allow the racing team to prepare for the future task and the mechanics to practice tire changes in real-life conditions.\n\n> The driver question is expected to be resolved this summer. Two experienced drivers are on the wish list. Nationality is not important for now. An American driver is no longer a requirement. General Motors has decided that performance is the priority. Only then will the goal of being a truly American team come into play.', ""Does anyone know what kind of relationship they'll have with Ferrari for those first few years? Is it just the PU or will it be closer to a HAAS type of thing? Haven't really kept updated with what's going on at Cadillac, except for the drivers' line up.\n\n\nThe fact they'll borrow a 2023 Ferrari hints to a closer relationship, no?"", 'They are preparing Badly', 'A new era begins for another backmarker team.', 'Americans in general only care if a driver is good. Like Perez got massive support as a midfield driver that wouldn’t have happened for an American driver', 'Watch Perez/Bottas be signed, then lead the destructors next year hahaha.\n\nIn all seriousness though, even if that did happen it would still be worthwhile to have two experienced drivers, with extended experience at top/WCC teams, giving feedback in between crashes. There aren\'t many downsides to that driver lineup that I can see. F1 isn\'t a finishing school, and any rookie going into a brand new team is likely going to heavily struggle - Neither Checo nor Bottas will have their careers particularly ""destroyed"" by struggling with Cad.']",102,37,0.94,102,35,35,5,0,0.009999999999999898,5

It's still struggling to find its feet, even 30 years post-apartheid.\n\nThe last time that South Africa had the GP was in 93, a year before apartheid was dismantled. Like many (not all) countries that have a GP, they were autocratic, had some money to spend (with little oversight), and needed some good PR. Since South Africa ended apartheid (which is a good thing, obviously), the government can't just throw money at events without having some backlash. A country that 32% unemployment watching a government shell millions for races is likely not going to be very popular. Now that the government isn't repressing 70% of the population, there would be political repercussions for spending that would be seen (rightfully, IMO) as wasteful.\n\nCompare this to Rwanda, who are seen as the frontrunner for an African GP.

While it\'s called the international release and F1 is claiming it\'s available ""across the globe"", it seems there are very few countries where [it\'s actually in cinemas today](https://www.f1themovie.com/ticketing/).\n\nIn most of the world (including large parts of Europe & Asia) it will only be released on the 27th of June^(which is called the North American release for some reason)', 'Driving scenes in Imax are pure cinema.\n\n\nThe story itself though is just servicable at best.', 'Did they get Flavio to write the first half of the film? All the intentional accidents as strategy really took me away from the immersion.\n\nThe racing scenes are great and the second half of the story was decent but man that first half was hard to swallow.\n\nI loved that they had a Murray commentary cameo. And the overall design of the team and the personnel was cool.', ""Just got back from the cinema. It's decent with great cinematography. Lots of fun cameos from F1 people.\n\nMy racing-related comments: Sonny Hayes deserves alllll the penalty points. 😂 Also, qualifying just...doesn't exist, I guess.\n\nI feel like we might get another jump in popularity soon. Hope the next few races are good enough to keep the new blood interested."", 'The driving scenes were unreal. I knew Joseph Kosinski was gonna cook with those. He’s one of the best directors when it comes to speed and perspective. That scene near the end with the sweeping POV of Yas Marina was epic. Overall a fun movie and great spectacle', ""So... lewis can't catch a break at Abu Dhabi even in his own movie huh ? that too in the final laps..."", 'The only nitpick I had was the Monza crash, on a relatively small sausage kerb. Apart from that, I was really blown away by this film', ""All I wanted from this movie was Top Gun: Maverick with Formula 1 cars and that's exactly what I got. What I loved most about this movie is that it's not about winning a championship for driver or constructor but instead it focuses on the thrill of getting points and chasing for a podium finish. From a branding perspective it's a smart decision to try and attract people to the sport without focusing on who the overall winner is and from a storytelling perspective it means a more realistic story where the stakes are raised especially when someone Brad Pitt's age couldn't be consistently competitive to that level. It was smart of the movie to openly use this to the advantage of the story rather than pretending it isn't something that raises questions.\n\nWhile it's not explicitly laid out I do like the protagonists arc on being a nomad and learning to be part of a team but I do wish the rivalry between the two leads was a bit more fleshed out with more meaningful moments between the two before they start working together. I also think the story plays things a little too safe considering the drama and controversy that often comes from F1 but I understand as this movie is purely advertisement for the sport that the filmmakers hands may have been tied on how far they could go.\n\nThis is up there as one of the best sports movies I've ever seen with an attention to detail in visuals and branding that is unparalleled, and I already can't wait to rewatch it. I'm not sure if a sequel is planned but if it is then I'll be ready to support the Apex Grand Prix team wherever they go next."", 'Loved the camera shots, especially the helmet cams + daytona ( - which for me hit more than any of the F1 footage). The story was... questionable, as expected.   \n  \nWould maybe have been more realistic if they had Flavio Briatore in that movie doing strategy, because I am sure Sonny Hayes/Brad Pitt would have been banned after the first few races for all the crashing/holding up as a backmarker/spreading gravel onto the track that he did to cause yellow flags to help out his teammate.\n\nA few nice moments for those of us that know F1 well like Guenther\xa0being pissed off at the Apex GP TP (already forgot his name), Verstappen flipping off Sonny, Roscoe. and as a Lando fan just nice seeing him up on a big screen.', ""Sonny Hayes might be the biggest terrorist in F1 history.

1lk5qy4,Burning red Summer,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lk5qy4/burning_red_summer/,2025-06-25, News,Is Fred cooked for good after this scathing editorial from the main racing magazine in Italy? (translation in the comments),"[""Ferrari has been through a half dozen team principals with the same results. The TP isn't the issue."", 'Getting rid of their team principal right before a new set of regulations would be absolutely stupid, especially as their new technical director has only just started', 'Ferrari should keep Vasseur\n\nI think he arrived to a team in ruin in 2023. Operationally they were appalling, slow pit stops, awful Strategy and poor reliability.\n\nIn 2023 the team slowly improved throughout the year\xa0and were second fastest by the end of it, they carried this through to 2024 and also fixed the main problem they had had in 2023, bad tyre wear. Suddenly in 2024 they had the best tyre wear on the gird bar maybe Haas. The first example of many of Vasseur identifying a poor area and improving it.\xa0\n\nAnd in 2024 Vasseur led them to what is in my opinion Ferrari’s best season since 2008! They looked like a different team and were the best on the grid operataionally.\xa0\n\nAnd now this season, while the car is not good enough to win, it is slowly improving, in the triple header they were the second fastest team for me and in Canada Leclerc said they had front row potential.\xa0\n\nBut also you can only blame the team principal so much for a disappointing car. He does not build the car, he hires the people who do, and Vasseur had made many high profile signings of successful designers up and down the grid.\xa0\n\nThe things the team principal is more responsible for, is how the team performs operationally. And Vasseur inherited a team that was woeful operationally and had not capitalised on a great car in 2022.\xa0\n\nAnd Vasseur has made this team amazing operationally, bar the outright pace, everything else about Ferrari is very good.\xa0\n\nIn the strategy department they were probably the best team in 2024, Japan, Netherlands, Monza, USA were all races where the strategy directly won places and Monza was the best example. At Ferrari’s home race everyone had rules out a Ferrari win after qulaifying, heck everyone had ruled them out by lap 30. But they rolled the dice, the Ferrari gambit. No one thought the one stop was on but Ferrari and Vasseur knew that it was the only way they could win. So they went for it and won at Monza!\xa0\n\nThe pit stops are another perfect example of Vasseur identifying a place where Ferrari were lacking, and improving it. It was ridiculous how often Ferrari from 2019-2022 would randomly have a long pit stop. But this year they have not only improved, but have been comfortably THE BEST team on the pit stop front, with the crew doing an incredible job under Vasseur’s leadership.\xa0\n\nAnd the bad reliability that plagued them and their customer teams throughout 2022 is all but eradicated. I don’t recall a Ferrari dropping out of a race due to reliability since Brazil 2023!\xa0\n\nFerrari have been a little disappointing this season, but they’re still third in the standings and not far off second.\xa0\nAnd Ferrari are always firing their team principals and things dont change when they do. Compare them to other teams, like imagine Red Bull had fired Horner after Red Bulls poor 2008 or after 2015. But they did not and they stuck with him and reaped the rewards. Like him or not yiu cannot deny that Christian Horner was a great team principal for Red Bull from 2005-2023.\xa0\n\nAnd let’s not forget that he masterminded the biggest and most dramatic driver transfer in the sports history. Even if Lewis is worse performing than Sainz (which id like to add looked unlikely after Lewis’s great season in 2023 that preceded Ferrari signimg him) this is an incredible move for Ferrari because Lewis brings so much good publicity to the team and has attracted the joint biggest sponsorship deal in F1 history, the HP deal. Like the blue or not this is gargantuan momey for Ferrari and Vasseur is again the guy that led the team to this deal. And I doubt Hamilton wouldve gone to Ferrari without Vasseur. Let’s not forget Vasseur worked directly with Hamilton in GP2 and they have always appeared to be friendly with each other.\xa0\n\nAnd Ferrari appears to be a much friendlier place than the cold team that it was before, shrouded in controversy every other year and now it seems very nice with a very fun man at the head and I would no longer compare it to the likes of Red Bull’s toxic environment but it’s also not too extreme in the other direction like the likes of McLaren who seem to be trying to win by the power of friendship and good vibes. I think Ferrari is a very healthy medium and a very healthy team.\n\nWhen I look at the team that Vasseur inherited, and then look at the team it is now, I think Vasseur should be proud of what he’s done and it deserves to be appreciated by both Ferrari themselves, who made the great decision to hire him, and F1 fans.\xa0', ""I still don't understand why they remade the whole car this year. They were so close to winning constructors last year"", '2 of the best drivers on the grid, most well liked TP with Vowles and plenty of fan goodwill.', ""It sounds like a sixteen-year-old girl's private diary. Instead of talking about her period or school crushes, she tries to guess — with no real facts — what will happen to one of the top F1 teams.\n\nThe level of Italian journalism is just sad, and I'm saying this as an Italian who reads it."", ""**English translation:** \n\n**Scorching days in Maranello**\xa0— and not just because of the suffocating summer heat. Ferrari’s disappointing results in Formula 1 have inevitably put Fred Vasseur in the hot seat. The French team principal’s contract with the Prancing Horse is set to expire at the end of the year, and discussion around the matter has started to heat up. That’s always what happens when things don’t go to plan. There’s no point hiding behind a finger — it’s just part of life. So we shouldn’t be surprised or cry scandal if the head of Ferrari’s F1 operations is now under the microscope, as senior management weighs up whether to continue with a relationship that began in 2023.\n\nEven if purists would argue otherwise, the role of Ferrari team principal has increasingly come to resemble that of a football manager. When the results stop coming, the bench starts to wobble. The timing is hardly ideal, with the countdown to 2026 — a year of major F1 regulation changes — already underway. But given how things have gone so far, it’s only natural that those at the top begin to question whether the man chosen to lead Ferrari into the future is still the right one.\n\nAfter ten Grands Prix, the verdict is clear. Ferrari sit third in the Constructors’ Championship and have yet to show they can fight — even once — for a win. Monte Carlo was the exception, where the Scuderia looked capable of taking the top step of the podium, but overall, the picture has been bleak. The podiums Ferrari have secured have come more from the misfortunes of others than through any display of dominance from a team that continues to show flaws and has struggled to keep pace with its rivals.\n\nSo, should Ferrari stick with Fred Vasseur, or is it time to call it quits? This question is being discussed widely — and especially at the top levels of the company. According to\xa0**Autosprint**\xa0sources, the future of Ferrari’s team principal depends on the results the team manages to achieve between now and the end of the season.\n\nBecause who knows — perhaps from now on, Fred Vasseur will lead Ferrari to a thrilling 2025 F1 World Championship. Never say never. Even if, right now, that seems a distant prospect, you can't make calculations without factoring in the innkeeper. But maybe that’s precisely the problem. Trust appears to have been shaken — or at the very least, thrown into doubt — by a joyless season that’s served up too many bitter pills after a pre-season full of promise.\n\nIt’s now fairly clear that the French manager’s fate will also depend on how the SF-25 performs in the coming races. If the downward spiral continues, a day of reckoning will inevitably come. In the midst of all this debate, people have drawn (not always fairly) comparisons between Fred Vasseur and Jean Todt. Back in 1996, Todt found himself under fire. Just ten days after the French GP in which Michael Schumacher’s Ferrari engine blew up during the formation lap, the then team principal faced the criticism head-on:\n\n>\n\nHave you ever heard Fred Vasseur say it was his fault? You can go through every one of his statements — there’s no trace of it. The blame is always on someone else. Yet he’s paid precisely to take on that responsibility. He has consistently pointed the finger elsewhere, never taking direct ownership. But that’s not how things work in the professional world. Leadership roles are paid more precisely because they carry that burden. Otherwise, it would be far easier for everyone.\n\nAs the F1 circus heads toward Austria, the debate continues.
