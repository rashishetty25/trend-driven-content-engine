1nzdv3y,Why Piastri fans are rightfully upset,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nzdv3y/why_piastri_fans_are_rightfully_upset/,2025-10-06, See comment,"*Obligatory note that this is a long discussion of the so-called ""fair Papaya Rules"" that have been implemented so far, if it's not your cup of tea you can sit out.*

I think the main reason why a lot of fans, specifically Piastri fans, are so frustrated with what happened in Singapore isn't because of the move itself - it is because of the precedent that McLaren have set this entire season with their meddling in the driver's races.

Before the season, the team had explicitly stated that if they are the top running team, they will be ""letting the drivers race"" so long as they adhere to the ""Papaya Rules"". As of this point, both drivers and the team have stated this means basically **""**[**do not make contact with each other**](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/brown-opens-up-on-papaya-rules-and-mclaren-team-orders-debate-as-norris.5y1UmREKJB6qZCNmQM9Zdt)**""**

**R1 - Australia:** However, in the first race of the season, there is already a team order being implemented to have Piastri hold position during the wet-dry transition just as he was entering Norris' DRS. We can say that it was justified due to the conditions, but a team order is a team order. This is the first marker that the team was already backtracking on their pre-season ethos.

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOAXze2VkaU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOAXze2VkaU) start from 10:53

Between Australia and Monaco, Piastri loses out in the Miami sprint to Norris after he benefits from a last minute safety car. In Imola where a trigger-happy early pitstop strategy forces Piastri, who qualified ahead, to pit far too early and into traffic. A consequential second early pitstop allows Norris to extend and end up behind Piastri with a 20 lap tyre advantage at the safety car restart. Norris overtakes and ends up P2. Part of racing, but Norris' pitwall was allowed to attack.

**R8 - Monaco:** to summarize, Piastri's entire race and strategy is to ensure that Norris' victory is protected by preventing an undercut from Leclerc. This is confirmed by team personnel and by Norris himself. Since it is Monaco, overtaking is a distant myth, but Piastri could have attempted an undercut on Leclerc himself had his strategy been allowed to do so, but Piastri plays the team game.

**R10 - Canada:** A new suspension specifically designed for Norris is implemented on his car. Piastri still qualifies ahead. However, once again a strong strategy from Norris' pitwall allows him to catch Piastri near the end of the race. He ends up crashing into Piastri and ending his own race, with Piastri luckily escaping a DNF. Norris rightfully takes immediate blame and the situation is diffused.

[This is how the situation was addressed by Stella](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/stella-says-norris-and-piastri-collision-not-acceptable-as-he-admits-briton.5I2G0joimFftevHuEeJDjj):

https://preview.redd.it/tzx7unil4gtf1.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4c9c7af9cdee3d14e0ee03d71b9a9fc75fd9b59

**R11 - Austria:** The first aberration in how these intra-team pressure points are addressed occurs. Piastri has a close call after a lock up whilst battling Norris for 1st place during the opening 20 laps. Note that after this lock up, an [immediate reprimand](https://youtu.be/Wj6DHG0X66k?si=PetzvPX8NrPepGcC) is given to Piastri from his engineer. Piastri even apologises for this after the race. Note that no contact has been made between the cars. [Stella addresses](https://racingnews365.com/mclaren-explains-why-it-felt-oscar-piastris-move-was-over-the-top) the scenario with the same severity and tone as Norris' **collision.** 

https://preview.redd.it/rrkr5qir5gtf1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=00646d24c036915c3322caa9290214a06f8311ad

**R12 - Silverstone:** Piastri receives a 10s penalty for erratic driving, allowing Norris to win the race. Piastri immediately questions his team. We can go round-and-round about the validity of that penalty, but McLaren, although agreeing that the penalty was unfair, do not even bother to contest it with the FIA. 

https://preview.redd.it/x4fqwtkp6gtf1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d608732953eae874b5b9125ca464abc0428eed

[Note that both Stella and Verstappen have agreed the penalty was harsh. ](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mclaren-lays-out-factors-on-why-it-felt-piastris-british-gp-penalty-was-very-harsh/10740013/)At the time, Piastri's request is dismissed as desperate and absurd, but I hope recent events can shed a new perspective on this. It is less about the penalty and more so about backing your driver when a perceived injustice has occurred.

**R13 - Belgium:** Piastri overtakes Norris to inherit the lead on lap one. Piastri is placed onto medium tyres. Norris in contrast goes on a hard-tyre strategy aiming for a one-stop and forcing Piastri to commit to the one-stop as well. Note that this is a two-step harder compound, giving Norris a major advantage. Once again, Norris is fairly allowed to try and attack for the lead, but Piastri holds him off.

**R14 - Hungary:** Piastri qualifies ahead and is committed to the two-stop strategy, which was assumed to be the 'optimal strategy'. Norris, after a rough lap 1, commits to a one-stop which turns out to be the better one. Piastri has to remind his team that he is racing Norris, not Leclerc, and manages to catch up to Norris. Once again, he is reminded before even attacking to [""remember how we go racing""](https://imgur.com/a/onboard-piastri-almost-running-into-norris-WSTosxT). A subsequent lock up happens, **but no contact is made**. 

At this point in the season, it is clear that Norris is fully allowed to attack and try and get ahead with no intervention from the team. **This is not the issue, as it is part of racing and he is entitled to do so.**

**R16 - Monza:** I think this race has been dissected enough times, but this is where the second major aberration occurs. 

First, **Piastri is asked to provide a tow to Norris** to ensure that he will pass into Q3. I don't believe this mattered in the end, but **why is Piastri being asked to help out his direct rival once again?** Not to mention how Norris tried to get a sneaky tow from him in Spain as well?

https://preview.redd.it/0iavnvifagtf1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf599d53ec7bcaa684bdbbe9b1c83acc649ea2e8

Into the race, Norris falls behind Piastri after willingly giving up his pitstop priority to ensure no threat of Piastri overtaking him under a safety car and a presumable ""threat"" of an undercut from Leclerc. A slow stop means Piastri comes out ahead, the team requests a swap, Piastri obliges **after explicitly stating that a slow stop was deemed to be ""part of racing"" by the team.**

What people are missing here is that **Norris was** **guaranteed that Piastri would not undercut him**. Keep in mind all those previous races where Norris was fully allowed to attack and use alternate strategy calls to successfully get ahead of Piastri, yet somehow he is able to dictate both his and Piastri's strategy and be **guaranteed by the team** that his position will remain? Moreover, why does the team care if Piastri would be undercut by Leclerc? They were over double in points ahead of the second team in the WCC, a 2 point loss would not have made even a fraction of injury.

**R18 - Singapore:** This leads us to Singapore. Keep in mind that up to this point:

* Norris has been fully allowed to try alternate strategies to get ahead of Piastri even though he was often the car behind during qualifying and the race.
* Norris has collided with Piastri
* Piastri has been publicly reprimanded for two lockups which have been given the same severity as Norris' collision
* Piastri has received several requests to help out the team and his rival, even though he is the championship leader.

After Piastri has qualified ahead once again (I hope you can see the pattern now), Norris takes an aggressive and opportunistic move in the opening turns, making contact with Verstappen and subsequently colliding with his teammate and nearly forcing him into the wall. Note several things:

* No reprimand is given to Norris over the radio whatsoever.
* Piastri is rightfully upset and requests team intervention as this is a clear violation of the most explicit ""Papaya Rule"". No intervention is done, and Piastri explicitly calls it unfair.
* In contrast to Canada, Norris has not taken any responsibility for this collision nor shown any remorse.
* Most pertinent, [Zak Brown calls it ""fair and clean racing""](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/clearly-just-hard-racing-mclarens-brown-and-stella-give-verdict-on-norris.1cEdvCBHmLSoFPKF73dmAW)**.**

https://preview.redd.it/3o2fy3jocgtf1.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e0daad85e1918ea9e4b823f804be44d3f2e372

On top of that, **Norris is once again able to dictate Piastri's pitstop strategy**, with no sign of the pitwall making any attempt to get Piastri ahead (by a potential undercut etc..). Piastri receives an equally slow stop as in Monza, increasing his gap to Norris from 4s to 9s. Piastri is able to reduce the gap to Norris to 2s by the end. Do the math.

My point with this post is to highlight the contrasting nature of these team interventions by Mclaren. Norris is now responsible for two teammate collisions that could have had disastrous consequences, yet Piastri is made to apologize for two lockups with the same intensity. Norris' pitwall is fully allowed to try and get ahead when he is behind, but Piastri's strategy becomes ""team focused"" and redundant.

I am not calling out or placing blame on any driver, but rather to illustrate that this bullshit ""two number one drivers"" ethos does not work when this team is so hellbent on contradicting themselves. Mclaren has tried to make this seem as ""impartial"" of a fight between the two drivers, but their actions do not follow. And the ""unconscious bias"" that may or may not exist for one driver is becoming less of a fallacy and more so reality.","[""Obviously this is a controversial topic, but OP has made an effort to present their point of view and it could be a good starting point for a discussion.\n\nIn order to make sure this thread doesn't derail, please keep in mind the following rules:\n\n* Fair criticism of teams and drivers is permitted, but don't let it turn into blind hatred.\n* Don't attack or generalise fanbases.

It made me think about what this actually means for racing.

2026 F1 cars will have a 9 MJ battery powering a 350 kW electric motor, but the battery can‚Äôt be fully recharged every lap even with all the energy recovered during braking.

Even top tracks with strong braking zones only give back about 7-8 MJ to the battery, less than what the 9 MJ pack needs. Drivers can‚Äôt rely on using maximum electric power all the time without draining the battery.

On long straights, the battery drains quickly and regen can‚Äôt keep up. Teams will have to manage energy carefully and save electric power for key parts of the lap instead of using it continuously.

This limitation makes the new hybrid systems more strategic in racing, when and how you use electric power could decide battles and lap times.

Will this energy management create more strategy and uncertainty, or just become standard race management?","['Even as it is, it takes a lap to build up to have a shot at overtaking every 2nd lap. This will make it every 3rd.', ""They obviously won't deploy maximum power all the time and will have to get used to managing when they want to use all the power they have and when they don't.   \n\nOne thing that interests me more is if the massive amount of electric torque available now makes the motor mapping a sort of back-door traction control, or if the FIA has already thought around it."", ""It'll be like Top Gear. Where you have to save the nitro boost for the best parts of the track."", 'there will probably be a lot of clipping', 'ferrari practicing lift and cost this year to be ready for next year :3', 'they will be using the mgu-k to generate on throttle too - possibly out of corners for TC of sorts but mostly towards the end of straights like the mgu-h does already - some tracks they will definitely not have enough fuel to do this every lap though.', 'Not sure I understand this correctly, but the battery delta SOC should be 4MJ whilst the energy recovery limit is at most 9MJ, usually 8.5MJ.\n\nIt could indeed be challenging to recover enough energy under braking, they will likely burn some fuel for that as well. There are also a number of regulatory deployment limitations to manage the battery around the lap. things like limits to how much power they can deploy at what speeds, how fast they can reduce that power and how much they can recharge under full throttle.', 'Drivers will need to relearn how to drive with this PU regulation.\n\nNo more full throttle all the time, instead they‚Äôll have to manage power across an entire lap to get it right. In a way it will be interesting to see who can adjust best to this new reg change.', 'Also the qualification will be more difficult, especially in Rainy situations.\nA recharge of two laps can cost a lot of time and you need more fuel(=weight)', 'Drivers have been saying this since this was first revealed that the ice has to be used even more aggressively than now to charge the battery, which will mean even more engine clipping.']",316,102,0.92,316,1101,1101,4,6,0.0,4

1nyz4cu,George Russell redemptions arcs in Singapore 2025 and Canada 2025. Do you think it shows how much more has he improved as a driver?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nyz4cu/george_russell_redemptions_arcs_in_singapore_2025/,2025-10-05, Discussion,"Just wanted to share an appreciasion post and start a discussion about George Russell, because I don't think many people notice how much he has matured and improved as a driver over the course of the last 18 months.

Singapore 2025:

After 2 years it seems like George Russell finally got rid of his ""last lap curse"".
2023 - Russell crashed on the last lap from P3
2024 - George drove into the wall in FP2, then finished the race in P4, suffering from heatstroke afterwards.
2025 - inserted himself into the wall once again in FP2. Got pole position with one of his best quali runs imo. Then executed flawless and dominant drive to win.

Canada 2025

2024: He got amazing pole position with the same time as Max. Beacuse of some mistake didn't capitalize on it fully and finished P3
2025: Got Pole position second time. Drove dominant race and finished P1.

In summary, in contrary to what many says Russell proves once again that he is able to analize his mistakes, learn from them and don't allow failures to get to his head too much.

Another telling thing is that after both Canada 2025 and Singapour 2025 he said sth like ""It is a payback for ...."" so these failures must have meant a lot to him 

I will probably get downvoted for this but I think that George this years can handle pressure very well ( better than Norris, Charles  and maybe even Oscar) especially in quali. Yesterday was not the first time that he wasn't super competetive in Q1 and Q2 but when it matters he got his shit together and got pole after 1st lap. Looking back this is a recurring pattern with him.","['Not sure how many podiums and poles he got last year but he‚Äôs defintely done well this year in a car that isn‚Äôt as good as McLaren‚Äôs.', 'What\'s funny is Leclerc and Russell have swapped places this and last season.\n\nRussell in 2025 and Leclerc in 2024 = uber consistent in a decent car to maximize podiums, rightfully receives a lot of praise\n\nLeclerc in 2025 and Russell in 2024 = in a less competitive car or team and so people think they\'re bad due to less podiums\n\nEdit: to be clear I rate them both very highly. Russell last season deserved far more praise than he got, my point is that people are acting like Leclerc suddenly got worse or Russell randomly became a top 3 driver this season when their performance has been pretty much the same across both. \n\n2023 was the last ""rough"" year for both of them, since 2024 they\'re both been super consistent.', 'I‚Äôve always been a fan of George. I like him as a person and I think he‚Äôs an excellent driver. Most fans underrate him, imho. Not really sure why. Even the incidents people cite for the reason they hate him seem to be fairly mild and quite infrequent compared to some of the others.\n\nEither way, I was thrilled for him this weekend. He deserves all of the praise coming his way.', ""He's always been a top tier driver *and* he is still improving and learning from mistakes. If he was in any of those 2 McLarens he'd have the WDC in the bag already imo.\n\nI don't get why Mercedes hasn't locked him with a multi-year contract already when he's always been a Merc driver, he's still young but experienced and he's so consistent and good. They should just give him what he wants and not risk losing him because as soon as they give him a car that can consistently fight for wins he's getting that championship."", ""I think Russell has been proving for a while that he's good enough and has enough grit to win a championship with a good car. Dsq or not, what he did last season at Spa was ridiculous."", ""If everyone was given the same car, Russell would be competitive. I stand that Mercedes has not looked great at the same time Russell has been there. You can look towards the 2020 Sakhir GP to see him always having race craft. I didn't need 2025 Canada and Singapore to see that. Any team would do well with Russell."", ""I think most people are coming around to him being one of the top drivers. He's definitely in the top 3, maybe even top 2 behind Verstappen."", ""He seems more like a winner to me than Lando and Oscar. Russell doesn't back off from a fight with Verstappen."", 'I think Georges off track personality is not as likeable as Charles, and not as much ""racer"" as Max.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""I want to start with a rant about the TV direction. No, we don't care about family/crowd shots/non racing related footage while the race/qualifying is happening. Maybe if it's a particularly good reaction from say a mechanic. That could be fun in a *replay*. Stop showing me the drivers girlfriends when on track action is happening. I like cars going vroom vroom. If I wanted to see models, I'd tune into a fashion show or something. \n\nHow did we not see any of the overtakes from both Alonso and Sainz at the end? It could've been a fun story line to follow. Norris wasn't overtaking Max unless Max made a mistake. And guess what? If that happened, YOU CAN SHOW A REPLAY! As long as Lando didn't get within 0,5s, he wasn't overtaking Max. It was interesting when they wrestled the backmarkers to lap them. That could've resulted in enough chaos for an overtake, but even that could have been in the tiny box.  \n\nI'm quite frankly baffled that we didn't get to see anything from first of all Lewis charging up towards Antonelli on new softs and then nothing from him having lost his brakes at the end. Cutting the track while Alonso is gaining rapidly. That would've been really fun to follow for the last few laps. \n\nIt's been an ongoing issue this whole season. At the top the race is basically over after the first corner. The tyres are lasting too long and overtaking is too difficult. But the midpack footage could be used way more. There's almost always some sort of battle happening on track. I'm willing to say that most of us here aren't only watching to see who wins in the end, we want to see on track action between all cars."", ""At this point, it feels like the title might just be decided by whoever gets a bad pit stop from McLaren in the coming races. They really need to fix whatever the issue is.\n\nWith 6 races to go and a 22 point gap, I do wonder if we'll get a moment where one driver tells the pitwall to stop yapping on about papaya rules."", 'Next year we have a sprint race ‚òπÔ∏è', 'Piastri/Norris was definitely a racing incident, memes aside, but McLaren have managed to get themselves in a complete mess with this and it is *exactly* what people said would happen after Monza.', ""I know I'm beating a dead horse, but the TV direction is an absolute disgrace. If you're not in the Top 5, you might aswell not exist. Driver in the back does repeat overtakes? Not interesting, not even a replay. Hamilton massively loses time, cuts corners and is about to be overtaken by Alonso? Hey, maybe a replay if you're lucky. \nInstead we spend several minutes watching Norris tailing Verstappen because the TV director is extremely optimistic and thinks anything of note is gonna happen. Lando tried once, maybe twice, and that was it, other than that he was just driving behind like Trulli was in front. I don't know why we have to cover that when there's much more interesting things going on elsewhere.\n\nAnd for god's sake, stop showing people in the garages unless there is something to show.

He cut multiple corners in a row on purpose. The only reason you should be allowed to do that is if you are going to retire the car and this is the fastests and safests way to get the car to the pitlane.\xa0\n\n\nTo me this was very obviously on purpose, since he was fully able to slow the car down enough to make the other, uncuttable corners. He also just could have stayed at lower speeds and he clearly gained time compared to if he stayed on the track as usual.\n\n\nSince he was still racing and not retiring, he should be subject to all the normal rules that apply to drivers in a race.

I'll not stop giving my flowers to George Russell for a beautiful qualifying where he managed to wow my socks off with his impressive lap, and a race where he held P1 with an iron grip and pulled away notoriously. I think he was having difficulties with the grip or his brakes throughout the race *(someone check me on this)* but he managed those skillfully! Mercedes letting him as a free agent will be a mistake, in my eyes, given the amount of potential he has. I harbour these sentiments for a long while now but he is a driver with immense talent! Pass him a championship winning car and I am intrigued to see what he can do with those. Also, someone tell Toto Wolff to sign the man with the terms and conditions that Russell requires already. \n\nI also believe Antonelli's race went under the radar from some eyeballs for him obtaining a relatively good position. This track is notorious for being somewhat physically demanding, and it is easy to slip up and make mistakes. Although he had lost positions towards the start *(a factor he would know that he could work on, no doubt)*, the way his race panned out was controlled, something needed to bring home a haul of points as well! I find it as a job well done\n\nMercedes this weekend demonstrates the unreliability of free practice towards an overall performance for the race, something which people tend to neglect at times. 33 points helps them surge forward in the WCC for P2. They are having a season that goes slightly above my expectations for them thus far, and I am really glad to see them getting on their feet after their turbulent time for the past few years"", 'While the Red Bull car was not mighty in Singapore, it was still very competitive on what is generally considered their worst circuit in this generation of cars.

The 1989 F1 season finished in top notch drama with McLaren teammates Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna, with Prost leading Senna by 16 points, with 2 races to go (Japan and Australia). In their 2nd season together at McLaren, the teammate rivalry was at a maximum and no niceties were given between the two.

On lap 47, Senna attempted an overtake at the Casio Triangle chicane, resulting in a collision that took both cars off the track. Prost retired, but Senna rejoined after a push-start and won the race. However, the FIA disqualified Senna for cutting the chicane and receiving assistance, handing Prost the championship.

Will we see a repeat of this?
