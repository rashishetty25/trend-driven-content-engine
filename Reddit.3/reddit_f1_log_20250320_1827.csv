Obviously to win in an underpowered car you'd want the safety car and rain on your side. But for a team like Jordan GP where in 1998 they barely started getting points 5 rounds prior, they pulled through with insane strategy, and secured a 1-2 as a first win.

Fly high, Eddie. You did an unbelievable amount to get Ireland into motorsport.

Yeah, obviously I\'ve only got myself to blame, tried to push too much in those conditions, but yeah, the other 56 and three quarter laps were very strong."" That first part sounded like him saying that he had bad luck, and his mistake wasn\'t that bad, and then there\'s a humble part in the middle, and it ends with him talking well about himself again.

Oscar made more mistakes than that one. He was catching Lando at one point, and they told him not to fight while they got through the backmarkers (which is never fun for fans to hear team orders, but three cars maneuvering around each other in those conditions is a recipe for a triple DNF). By the time they were past and McLaren was ready to let them fight again, Oscar was more than two seconds back. That wasn\'t because of team orders, it was because Oscar made a mistake that wasn\'t on the main broadcast. Oscar\'s a great driver. He\'s getting better for sure, but that wasn\'t one of his best races. I\'m not sure it was one of anyone\'s best F1 races except maybe Yuki\'s, and technically Kimi\'s since it was his first F1 race. And that Haas is so terrible, I couldn\'t say for sure about Bearman.

1jfh220,Which is the most successful current seat in F1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jfh220/which_is_the_most_successful_current_seat_in_f1/,2025-03-20, Discussion,"Inspired by u/akastus's question about the most successful race engineer, I was wondering which F1 seat has had the most world championships won in it? That is, tracing which side of the garage a driver is on and finding out which one has the most driver's champions victories.

I know Max is in Vettel's old seat (both drove with Riccardo), so that seat has 8.

Kimi's seat has 6 for sure, but what about Button's championship, (if that counts), both drivers left Brawn when it went to Mercedes. Rosberg and Barrichello switched seats to and from Williams, so does that mean it was Button whose seat was taken up by Schumacher and later Hamilton, making it 7?

But it's got to be an old team, Ferrari or McLaren probably

Ferrari has 15 driver's titles, so at least 8 are in the same seat, McLaren has 12, so might beat Ferrari out?

Okay, so it probably can't be Ferrari *or* McLaren, neither has a clear 8 to beat Red Bull.

Oddly, the only other competitor is Mercedes, if you count Brawn and Tyrell then it should be feasible for Lewis's seat to beat RB

*Okay so by my calculations, the most successful seat I can track is Max's current seat, as 8 drivers championships have been won in it, second best is a tie between Raikkonen and Schumacher's Ferrari seat, Senna, Lauda, Hunt, and Fittipaldi's McLaren seat, and Lewis's Mercedes seat. All at six.*","[""Okay, so Raikkonen and Schumacher had the same seat, that's 6  \nScheckter is the other seat, with Lauda that's 4\n\nWhen Lauda and Regazzoni come in there is a complete driver replacement, I think Regazzoni took Ickx's seat, as Ickx leaves of his own volition mid season, and Regazzoni has to recommend Lauda.\n\nAand now it's 1971 and Ferrari has entered three cars in multiple races.\n\nThe way the cars and seats boil down, I think only Ickx can be followed further.\n\nI don't think I can follow this trail back further, from '70 to '69 all three drivers get changed out, and while I could say Ickx, who also drove in '68, is a good enough connection, the same issue occurs in '67.\n\nSo it probably can't be Ferrari, unless they're a strong case to tie the drivers together before there are only two.
