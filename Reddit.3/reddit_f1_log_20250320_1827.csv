Obviously to win in an underpowered car you'd want the safety car and rain on your side. But for a team like Jordan GP where in 1998 they barely started getting points 5 rounds prior, they pulled through with insane strategy, and secured a 1-2 as a first win.

Fly high, Eddie. You did an unbelievable amount to get Ireland into motorsport.

That first part sounded like him saying that he had bad luck, and his mistake wasn\'t that bad, and then there\'s a humble part in the middle, and it ends with him talking well about himself again.

Oscar made more mistakes than that one.

By the time they were past and McLaren was ready to let them fight again, Oscar was more than two seconds back. That wasn\'t because of team orders, it was because Oscar made a mistake that wasn\'t on the main broadcast. Oscar\'s a great driver. He\'s getting better for sure, but that wasn\'t one of his best races. I\'m not sure it was one of anyone\'s best F1 races except maybe Yuki\'s, and technically Kimi\'s since it was his first F1 race. And that Haas is so terrible, I couldn\'t say for sure about Bearman.

1jfh220,Which is the most successful current seat in F1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jfh220/which_is_the_most_successful_current_seat_in_f1/,2025-03-20, Discussion,"Inspired by u/akastus's question about the most successful race engineer, I was wondering which F1 seat has had the most world championships won in it? That is, tracing which side of the garage a driver is on and finding out which one has the most driver's champions victories.

I know Max is in Vettel's old seat (both drove with Riccardo), so that seat has 8.

Kimi's seat has 6 for sure, but what about Button's championship, (if that counts), both drivers left Brawn when it went to Mercedes. Rosberg and Barrichello switched seats to and from Williams, so does that mean it was Button whose seat was taken up by Schumacher and later Hamilton, making it 7?

But it's got to be an old team, Ferrari or McLaren probably

Ferrari has 15 driver's titles, so at least 8 are in the same seat, McLaren has 12, so might beat Ferrari out?

Okay, so it probably can't be Ferrari *or* McLaren, neither has a clear 8 to beat Red Bull.

Oddly, the only other competitor is Mercedes, if you count Brawn and Tyrell then it should be feasible for Lewis's seat to beat RB

*Okay so by my calculations, the most successful seat I can track is Max's current seat, as 8 drivers championships have been won in it, second best is a tie between Raikkonen and Schumacher's Ferrari seat, Senna, Lauda, Hunt, and Fittipaldi's McLaren seat, and Lewis's Mercedes seat. All at six.*","[""Okay, so Raikkonen and Schumacher had the same seat, that's 6  \nScheckter is the other seat, with Lauda that's 4\n\nWhen Lauda and Regazzoni come in there is a complete driver replacement, I think Regazzoni took Ickx's seat, as Ickx leaves of his own volition mid season, and Regazzoni has to recommend Lauda.\n\nAand now it's 1971 and Ferrari has entered three cars in multiple races.\n\nThe way the cars and seats boil down, I think only Ickx can be followed further.\n\nI don't think I can follow this trail back further, from '70 to '69 all three drivers get changed out, and while I could say Ickx, who also drove in '68, is a good enough connection, the same issue occurs in '67.\n\nSo it probably can't be Ferrari, unless they're a strong case to tie the drivers together before there are only two.

We may have lost Eddie, but we at least have that to look forward to.

People who knew him, or even those who had never met him, will be keen to add to what he said, or who he was, or what he did for them.

Indeed, there was no boundary between his exterior and his interior. Eddie was unashamed of who and what he was. We all envied him his lack of restraint, even though it could make you wince with embarrassment on most occasions.

Eddie was a Tigger, ‘T-I-G-G-E-R!!!!’. He bounced from place to place, never resting. He had the energy of a nuclear power station. He was to social convention what a wrecking ball is to a tower block. He just didn’t care for stupid rules and niceties. He’d cut the ‘crap’ right out and be alarmingly direct and familiar without ever being impolite.

Max also gets criticized/ over-analyzed for his radios.\n\nEdit: Hungary instead of Austria."", 'Yeah, but did he use k1? It was available….', 'I kinda agree with Hamilton that the Ferrari bit is getting overplayed here simply because we think it’s a recurrence of some past bad radio conversations with the team and driver.\n\nAt the same time, I don’t think calling out Max was needed, maybe it was just the first name that came up when trying to find a similar situation- but Max and GP have their own groove and they have been successful because of it.', '- Make a valid point about radio messages being harshly criticised by the media\n- Try to insinuate the other guy that also gets a lot of scrutiny for his radio messages by the media doesn’t actually get any scrutiny for his radio messages by the media\n\nHamilton I’m not following your logic there.', 'Is he right about Media over-exaggerating his radio? DAMN YES  \nIs he right about Max getting away? Hell Nah, If you just check post-race media articles about Max radio in Hungary, you can get a clear picture.  \nIs he right about Max-GP abuse? If its called abuse, i think we need to talk abt the definition of Brothers.\n\nI love Lewis, but this is not correct', 'Obviously, Lewis never reads F1-related articles that are not about himself. Otherwise, he would know about the constant criticism Max got for his radios over the years.\n\nWeird way to deflect from his own struggles, which - I agree - are massively overblown in the media currently.', 'We talk about toxicity amongst the fan bases with the increasing presence of social media, and how F1 should counter this. Statements like these are not helpful and unnecessary/petty.', 'He did say Max’s name but not in the interview everyone is watching. He did later on at Sky Sports when expanding on his point. \n\n“Go and listen to the radio calls with others and their engineers\xa0– far worse,” he said. “The conversation that Max has with an engineer over the years, the abuse that the poor guy’s taken and you never write about it, but you wrote about the smallest little discussion I had with mine.”\n\nThis is the quote according to Sky sports and Autosport (and the one OP is referring with “abusive”)']",0,217,0.48,0,192,192,0,8,0.010000000000000009,0
