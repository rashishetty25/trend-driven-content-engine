1ilbcs0,Mark Hughes: Why Michael Schumacher's F1 comeback failed,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ilbcs0/mark_hughes_why_michael_schumachers_f1_comeback/,2025-02-09, News,,"[""It's crazy how much changed in the few years he was gone. You're looking at no tyre management to heavy tyre management, Bridgestone to Pirelli, unlimited testing to heavily restricted testing, refuelling to no refuelling etc.\n\nAdapting to all that when you're on the wrong side of 40 with a few years off must have been very hard."", ""Wouldn't call it failed. In 2012 he was pretty much up to speed, just incredibly unlucky. He did it because he enjoyed it, not because he had anything to prove.\xa0"", 'Schumacher’s quotes about the tyres of 2012 sum up why I feel that season is overrated despite the different number of winners we saw at the start of the season:\n\n“The main thing I feel unhappy about is everyone has to drive well below a driver’s, and in particular, the car’s limits to maintain the tyres.\n\n“I just question whether the tyres should play such a big importance, or whether they should last a bit longer, and that you can drive at normal racing car speed and not cruise around like we have a safety car…\n\n“Formula 1 has always been a meritocracy; in the end the best engineers and drivers will always succeed. I just think that the tyres are playing a much too big effect because they are so peaky and so special that they don’t put our cars or ourselves to the limit. We drive like on raw eggs and I don’t want to stress the tyres at all. Otherwise you just overdo it and you go nowhere.”', 'Schumachers Management and PR firm did a stellar job playing down his motorcycle accident in 2009.\nIf you saw the   pictures you just knew that shit was more than serious.\n\nI firmly believe   that crash had long term consequences that hampered him even when he came back with Mercedes a year after the accident \n\nBut F1 also completely changed between his retirement in 06  and his comeback.\n\nCompletely different tires  and cars, only the engines were similar ( but more restricted), also more simulator work instead of on track testing.\n\nI still think he would have gotten more competitive in 2013 and beyond if he continued. \nIn terms of raw performance he was  on Rosbergs level in 2012, at least in my opinion.', 'Probably it didn’t went the way he expected and the way people expected, but after all there was a constant improving curve, in his final season he fully matched Rosberg in [H2H](https://pitwall.app/drivers/michael-schumacher/2012) and we saw in the following few years how strong Nico was.\n\nIt’s a pity that he didn’t stay at least until 2014, I don’t know if he would have competed for the championship but he certainly would have won some races with such a car and it would have been cool to see.', ""Crazy to see his motorcycle injury would've been a lot more dangerous if he didn't have the F1 drivers neck and the amount of damage it still managed to do to his skull and arteries.\n\nSchumacher's abject hatred of Pirelli and having to drive them on egg shells well below peak performance makes me wonder how on earth Hamilton and Alonso have managed to transition so well into this new slower era of F1 and have managed to tolerate it for.so long. Driving flat out stints on those Bridgestones suited both of them very well as it did Schumi."", ""That Monaco pole lap in the Merc was sublime. Shame he had a penalty and couldn't convert it to a win.\n\nI remember the press conference vividly.   He confidently stated he was going to qualify on Pole and then win the race.  People laughed.  He was totally serious.  That pole lap was electric.\n\nMy opinion is that it was all about tyres.  Ross Brawn directed tons of R&D into understanding the tyres and it started to pay off after Schumi left.  Had they had this knowledge before he joined I think it would have been more successful.  Sure he wasn't quite as sharp as before and seemed to drift mentally a bit during races but I would take that all day long against a middling younger driver."", ""He laid the groundwork for the future success Mercedes enjoyed. Not exactly the most conventional success, but Schumacher's comeback was by no means a failure"", 'As much as I loved watching Schumi in the Ferrari, I have a hard time liking the team after pushing him out. \n\n\nI just wish his career was longer.']",728,153,0.9,728,148,148,66,4,0.0,66
