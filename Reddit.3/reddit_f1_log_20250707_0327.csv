During the second safety car, it's very hard to see, but it looks like the lights go out on the safety car right before it goes under the bridge on the Hangar Straight (@54:04).

1lsr6so,A Couple Questions From a New Viewer,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lsr6so/a_couple_questions_from_a_new_viewer/,2025-07-06, Discussion,"Recently got into watching F1 and had a few questions about the dynamic of the competition for a chance to learn about some implied truths I might be missing out on.

\-Is it just a given that some teams will have no chance at podium finish all year and that they're more focused on finishing as close as they can to top 10? What I'm picking up from the dialogue is that some cars just outclass others and no matter how good of a driver you are you're not beating the regular top finishers.

\-Leads me to my second question, is it just an known objective fact by everyone involved that McClaren has the best car right now? I don't know anything about the tech behind these cars. Is it normal to expect them to continue to be dominating or are the modifications teams make between races a big enough game changer for it to be back and forth.

\-Lastly, if the answers to the above are yes, question to you guys as fans but how do you stay engaged throughout the season if you're a fan of a backmarker team or driver? Not that that stops me from watching but it seems like it'd be disappointing to not get much coverage during a race of specific drivers if I'm a fan of drivers who are always finishing outside of top 10 or someone who might DNF early.

edit: forgot to say thank you for taking your time to read this at the end of post so doing it now. appreciate all the insightful comments!","[""* Yes. Other than the top 3-4 teams, others almost never make it onto the podium, barring external factors like rain or other yellow/red flags.\n* Yes, it is known. In any other seasons, other teams would still try to improve their cars to match or beat McLaren. However, since next year brings new regulations, most teams are shifting their focus there and are not spending more technical and financial resources on this year's car.\n* Not really. The truth is, more often than not, it's actually more fun following mid and lower-level teams from a championship perspective; they're usually fighting for a single point difference. And that can mean millions of dollars in price money."", 'Others will probably give you better answers but I‚Äôll try to answer all 3 of these:\n\n1. Pretty much yes, for an Alpine or Sauber or Haas to finish on the podium this season it would require a minor miracle (although Alpine got one in Brazil last year and managed to finish with a double podium, but that was about as hectic a race as you‚Äôll ever see in F1). Even if the slowest car on the grid was only 0.5 seconds per lap behind the fastest car, over the course of a 60 lap race that‚Äôs half a minute in time and literal miles behind. So small gaps in pace can become insurmountable over the course of a race distance.\n\n2. McLaren currently have the best car by a large margin, although there are some tracks that suit other cars better (such as Mercedes in Canada). They will probably continue dominating, but it is possible that other teams will upgrade their cars enough to close the gap or even surpass McLaren. We saw this last year when Red Bull dominated the first 8ish races then had the 3rd fastest car by the end of the season because McLaren and Ferrari made better upgrades.\n\n3. Like in many sports, if you‚Äôre a fan of a team/player that simply isn‚Äôt capable of competing for championships, you take the small wins. A double points finish for Haas is probably about as exciting for their fans as a double podium is for McLaren fans. What‚Äôs been nice about this season is that every team has been able to score points on several different occasions, as opposed to years past when teams like Sauber will go all year without even sniffing the top 10.', ""1) yes, mostly though last year alpine was probably the worst on average but did manage a 2nd and 3rd in a rain race with a lucky strategy and good wet pace\n\n2) on average McLaren does,  but there's been a few times they missed setup and legit may not have been faster. They can upgrade the cars throughout the season and the pecking order can change. Last season redbull was way ahead for 5 or 6 races then for the entire rest of the season McLaren was faster.\n\n\nFollow up q\n\nYou pick a driver or two to watch and see how they do how the strategy fall in place where they are. The entire show isn't who wins. F1 historically isn't very race exciting. It's the engineering and raw speed."", ""\\> Is it normal to expect them to continue to be dominating\n\nYes, but the summer break can be a huge turning point. it won't, but it can be.\n\n\\> how do you stay engaged throughout the season if you're a fan of a backmarker team or driver?\n\nDue to the nature of the sport, we basically have several races going on at the same time, so the midfield battles are as valid as top ones, and more often than not they are more fierce. Like multiclass in GT, but everyone is still a competitor. It also opens up a possibility to a genuine miracle (Alpine in Brazil 2024), and even if not, it's still very cool to see what really good drivers can do with the cards dealt to them."", 'Enough people have answered your first two so I don‚Äôt need to repeat. But for the enjoyment part, I‚Äôm an Oscar fan (being an Aussie) so it‚Äôs obviously easy following the pointy end of the drivers championship.\xa0\n\nIn saying that, what drew me to F1 recently was that I love following the storylines up and down the grid. Such as:\n\n-Watching with interest how Lewis does at Ferrari\n\n-The interactions between rookies & veterans this season has been really nice to watch\n\n-Antonelli‚Äôs first pole and podium\n\n-Bortoleto getting his first point last week & the on track battle with Alonso.\xa0\n\n-Following Williams‚Äô progress to see if they can get back to competing, it‚Äôs been a rollercoaster so far.\xa0\n\n-Watching the dumpster fire that is currently Alpine and seeing where they go from here etc.\n\nAs much as I want Oscar to win it all, I‚Äôm a fan of the sport and appreciating every race weekend for what it is and whatever storylines it throws up each week.', ""First and foremost, it's an engineering competition."", 'I guess what makes this interesting as a post is you‚Äôre trying to get at what makes F1 interesting during a race.\n\nWhen it comes to on track action the level of interest ranks from most to least as follows: crashes/spins, overtaking, retirements, pit stops, lone cars lapping.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that I want crashes to happen but they are the most sensational part of racing, and they usually have an impact on the outcome of a race. If you talk about races from the past, crashes are often key to them being memorable.\n\nYour issue is if the driver you support is lapping on their own and down the leaderboard, then you‚Äôre not going to see them much. But isn‚Äôt it somewhat similar to a team ball sport where your player isn‚Äôt the key player so they‚Äôre playing support and not really in the action most of the time?\n\nI guess you‚Äôre lamenting that once a driver is in a team for the season, your fate is sealed as to what you can expect due to the car‚Äôs performance?\n\nAnd then I stop and wonder that even if I‚Äôm a fan of a driver, do I delight in just watching them lapping. There is a way I do but that‚Äôs not usually in the context of a race, it‚Äôs more for analysis afterwards.\xa0\n\nThe hard part of F1 is being able to understand the athleticism and skill as it‚Äôs the opposite of showy, like a great dunk or a bicycle kick, drivers are usually trying to be as clean as possible, more like a train. So just seeing a driver lapping on their own doesn‚Äôt do much for me during a race as what I want to see during a race is things that impact the outcome.\n\nThis is when you get into tyre/pit strategies and following that for all the drivers. So I don‚Äôt support one driver and vary my hopes from race to race,\xa0caring about them achieving their own goals.\n\nProbably motorsport‚Äôs biggest problem is that most of the time the most exciting and outcome variable moment of a race is the start. It‚Äôs the time that a crash is most likely and the chance for the most overtakes. So it‚Äôs often downhill from there for excitement and you‚Äôre relying on a big crash to cause a red flag for a standing restart or two drivers that are tight at the lead on the last lap to exceed the race start for tension.', 'I‚Äôve been watching since 1984.  There have always been dominate teams and cars.  Watch long enough and dynasties will fall and others will rise.  Mid fielders like Williams have stories to tell from an era gone by, and they may still have a new winning era in front of them.  The current dominate team was becoming an afterthought not long ago, and we may soon see the end of the Red Bull era(s).  You battle for 10th until you can battle for 5th, then you‚Äôre knocking on the door again.', 'My take on it:\n\n1. Some teams do a better job than others. Driver can make a difference (see Verstappen vs his teammates), but the performance of the car has massive impact. Big regulation changes can sometimes change the order. And many teams, that have no chance to catch up, will switch to the next season and hope that they get the next car right.\n2. Pretty much yes. Not on every track, but in the grand scheme - Yes.\n3. On Sky for example, you can follow one driver, if you want. Overall, i think that it is reductive to focus only at the top 3. Other teams and drivers can still do a good job, relative to their ranking. And on occasion, luck can have a big impact.']",63,64,0.82,63,295,295,-3,0,0.0,-3

Do people believe that racing should carry on unless conditions are exceptionally wet i.e torrential thunderstorm, monsoon like conditions?

Personally, I'd like to see racing continue in most circumstances because it allows the ""wet weather specialists"" to shine, giving them an opportunity to level the playing field against cars they may not be able to compete with in more ideal weather conditions.

1lt8gv5,Piastri‚Äòs penalty undeserved?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lt8gv5/piastris_penalty_undeserved/,2025-07-06, Discussion,"Edited see below

During the race, it looked quite clear that Piastri just tried to surprise Verstappen to give him a penalty. I just had a look at the telemetry from the live timing, and it paints a different picture. 

During the first safety car, Piastri decelerated from 207 to 65 kph in 3.3 sec (3.3 sec of hard braking). Verstappen went from 219 to 75 kph in 3.5 sec, they started braking at ca. 1/5 of the straight and basically simultaneously. 

During the second SC, Piastri went from 215 to 70 kph in again ca. 3.2 sec, for Verstappen it was 221 to 60 in 3.1 sec, so similar to the first SC. But Piastri started braking at 1/2 of the straight (so quite a bit later), the key here is that Verstappen only started to break 1.5 sec after Piastri. Piastri had already decelerated to 120 kph when Verstappen reacted. 

Looking at Verstappen‚Äòs onboard also gives a bit more additional information. During the acceleration down the straight, there was a lot of spray from Piastri and the safety car, so his visibility was reduced and he received a radio call that the SC is ending. I think both of these factors have contributed to his delayed reaction, which then in turn led to a very high closing speed, which forced him to evade Piastri. That obviously looked quite extreme off-board. 

I think, given that the call for the ending SC came relatively late and then Piastri‚Äôs need to allow the SC to go into the pits and the track to go green before he hits turn 15, gave him cause to decelerate quickly. It is not his fault that Verstappen didn‚Äôt notice him braking for almost 1.5 seconds. Just to be clear, I don‚Äôt think Verstappen is at fault here either, it‚Äôs just that his delayed reaction makes Piastri‚Äòs braking look quite extreme. From Piastri‚Äôs on-board (which faces rear) his braking doesn‚Äôt seem quite so strong and it looks like Verstappen just doesn‚Äôt brake. 

We can also compare this to the Russell incident in Canada. There Russell had no cause to brake (SC not ending or other), they were at lower speeds and Russell only decelerated to ca 85 kph so not as hard braking required (Russel 30 psi vs Piastri 60 psi). Russel did not receive a penalty.

Watching the race I thought the penalty was deserved but now I think Oscar got quite unlucky with it.

Edit: I stand by the conclusions I made due to the data but I agree that he shouldn‚Äôt have braked this hard this suddenly given the conditions. But if race control has an issue with him driving this way they should have reacted the first time he did it during the first SC restart. The way it happened he thought he was in the green to do it again","['Please keep the discussion focused on the (technical) details of the incident itself.\n\nFan wars, whataboutism or hatred targeted at any team, driver or official will result in bans.', ""The braking might have seemed reasonable to OP, but to everyone piled up behind him with low visibility it wasn't. \n\nI thought he stopped on track watching it live."", 'It was reckless given the conditions and very deserved. Even Hulk in the cool down room told him how it impacted him and other drivers.', ""Piastri wasn't thinking about Verstappen at all.\n\nHe was trying to warm up his brakes and tyres. That's all. He just did it in a way that wasn't reasonable. That's all there's is to it.\n\nIt had nothing to do with Verstappen."", 'Terrible race direction, he had one corner to let the safety car get ahead, of course he is going to slow down', ""The Race's video on it was interesting...Piastri did the exact same thing on lap 17, on the first safety car restart, and it wasn't even noted by the stewards. I do think a 150 mph sudden deceleration is a bit excessive but the stewards have been rather poor at being consistent about this stuff, particularly when looking back at the end of the Canadian GP"", 'Zero question whether he deserved a penalty. 10 seconds can be argued but no penalty at all would have been bullshit, stupid from him\xa0', 'The way the rules are today it‚Äôs a penalty, harsh or not. But I think the FIA needs to look at when they call a safety call in this lap and the drivers should be asking for that. Piastri was reacting to a very late call and as such caused the situation. Had they call it before maggots/beckets then this whole incident doesn‚Äôt happen as Oscar can back off in enough time in the ‚Äúacceleration zone‚Äù of the straight. Half way down the straight is too late!', 'The fact that the safety car had been called in makes it way worse, and that is what warrants the penalty imo. That is also the reason why Russel did not get a penalty: it was during normal SC period. Not after it has been called in.\n\nThe rule is clear : \n\n"" When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car the message ‚ÄúSAFETY CAR IN THIS LAP‚Äù will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system and the car‚Äôs orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors and drivers that it \r\nwill be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.\r\nAt this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall \r\nmore than ten (10) car lengths behind it.\r\nIn order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the \r\npoint at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves \r\nno erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other \r\ndrivers or impede the restart.""\n\nPiastri was in breached of it. Russell wasn\'t. \n\nPiastri also did it under the rain, and it was a consequent breach. So they went for the harsher penalty. \n\nI honestly completely understand the logic of the steward. And comparing their decision with the Russell one doesn\'t make much sense as it is not the same rule. One if for normal SC conditions, where people are expected to warm up the tyres, and the other is during the actually restart procedures, when drivers are supposed to be lined up and predictable to get back to racing safely.\n\nLike yes it is unlucky for Piastri, but he should have seen the ""SC in pit this lap"" light on time, and eased off instead of keeping doing it.']",0,230,0.35,0,183,183,0,4,0.0,0
