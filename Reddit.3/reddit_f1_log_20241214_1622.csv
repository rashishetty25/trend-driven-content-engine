Red Bull outscored Mercedes by 121 points in the constructors. Checo finished the season on 152 points, meaning so long as he gave a 32 points swing over Mercedes, Red Bull would still outscore Mercedes.

His first 2 races were 2nd places, meaning he scored 36 points in those 2 races. In the remaining 22 races, he prevented 18 points from going to Mercedes via his finishing results. This means  Checo would have had to race Australia (where he scored 10 but didn't affect Mercedes who finished 17 (RUS) and retired (HAM)) and also Japan where he scored 18 points to secure the constructors bronze medal for Red Bull.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.

Edit: To do the math, assuming teams pay their full bonus, McLaren employees got a 20% increase in bonus compared to last year, and Red Bull employees got a 16.67% decrease. Now, teams might not choose to pay this much in bonuses. Individual teams might have goals they have to meet to get their bonuses by their individual employee contracts. Just like teams don't have to spend the whole budget cap in the first place. For instance, it might be in Red Bull's employee's contracts that they have to place top 3 in the WCC or no bonus at all. But they might have something much more lenient. Just like driver contracts, we don't know what are in employee contracts.

Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors‚Äô Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors‚Äô Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""

He is only talked when, ‚ÄúYuki deserves the RB seat‚Äù instead of him. But I want to talk a bit about ‚Äúhis‚Äù carreer. He drove only 5 races in 2023 and 6 in 2024. He did not even completed a whole season worth of races, two seasons combined. He lacks of experience especially compared to Yuki‚Äôs ‚Äú4 full seasons‚Äù of experience. I believe he is a decent driver and can be a regular top 10 if he gains experience. For now, of couse if there‚Äôs somebody to be promoted, it is Yuki. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that Liam is a bad driver. He didn‚Äôt even have a full season worth of drive (11 races in total, correct me if i‚Äôm wrong), so it is not reasonable to compare the two and saying Lawson is bad.  He should gain experience to avoid RBR‚Äôs Gasly & Albon situation.  Also, even though how much I want Yuki to promote to the dark blue car, I don‚Äôt think Red Bull would gave one of the seats to a Honda driver considering Ford engines will come in 2026. But maybe they do, who knows right?? Anyway.. Any comments about Lawson? ","[""He has potential, but he needs to be given a proper season with winter testing included.

I can‚Äôt really fathom an opinion on him because of this short period of time. Also he has had an unremarkable junior career but of course that can vary because of different factors', ""I think he's a very adaptable driver who gets up to speed quickly - as evidenced by his record of winning first race out in almost every junior category he competed in, as well as his solid first F1 showings when thrown in the hotseat. However, I don't personally think he has a particularly high ceiling in terms of ability.\n\nHe deserves a place in F1 based on current form, and if things go his way he can probably have a solid career as something of a journeyman, but I don't think he's the right guy to put next to Verstappen."", ""The worst thing that could happen to Lawson right now, is to get promoted to being Max's teammate. We've seen experienced drivers like Ricciardo and Perez, and rookies like Gasly and Albon, either meltdown or not live up to the absurd expectations of that seat. Lawson needs to be aware of that, because his performance at the start WILL be subpar, but that awareness will help him properly improve his racecraft in time, and also convice Horner that everything is progressing in its proper time. If he does all that, by the late season he could be right behind Max, which would already be enough for Red Bull.\n\nAnd yes, the exact same applies to Tsunoda."", 'The problem with saying that Lawson should be put into that rbr seat, because he has the potential to develop into a better driver than Tsunoda is, that this is not what the second rbr seat is for.

1hdwpvp,I hate the HUD from back in the day ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdwpvp/i_hate_the_hud_from_back_in_the_day/,2024-12-14, Discussion,"Hey, guys!

New fan here, started watching F1 last year.

I‚Äôve been doing some ‚Äúresearch‚Äù for a while now. I‚Äôm currently watching every race from the 2012 season.

I simply hate how they used to display the gaps between drivers. You need to check the time really fast as it will soon disappear and show the gaps for the next group of cars.

I find it hard to follow on how the race is at that exact moment, comparing to nowadays where the times are always visible.

There are other things I don‚Äôt like, such as the radio messages, which have bad audio quality and that‚Äôs understandable, but providing subtitles doesn‚Äôt require that much technology.

The way they show the starting grid is also horrendous.

AND YES! I KNOW THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO AND IT MAKES SENSE TO BE WORSE!

With a lower resolution and less horizontal space on screen, having a vertical timing tower at all times would take up way more space, and they never changed that even after going widescreen in 2007 and eventually HD in 2011.\n\nThe fact that this finally changed in 2017 after Liberty took over suggests that this weird presentation style was something Bernie was still in charge of, which seems strange."", 'Yeah, people love to hate on Liberty but it was when they took over in 2017/2018 that the telemetry and presentation had a huge boost.', 'However many times I watch quali now, I just cannot get used to the double reference times on the new graphics.
