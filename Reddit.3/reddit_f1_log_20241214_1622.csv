Charles ran Norris close for P2 not mainly because the heroic drives he's known for (although he had a few of those this year), but by maximizing the weekend as much as he can. I think he's a little more consistent this year, and a lot more patient. He's much more willing to let the race come to him instead of overdriving the car like he has done a few times in the past. Those are all traits people used to, and still do, praise Carlos for.\n\nCarlos, on the other hand, I think has learned from Charles how to extract more from the car. Carlos has always been a rapid driver but if I'm not wrong, in terms of pace, this year Carlos has been closer to Charles than ever. This year he did his best quali performance against Charles, and I don't think there were a lot of times where Charles left him in the dust (with 20s+ gaps) in the race, like there were in 2021-2023.

Red Bull outscored Mercedes by 121 points in the constructors. Checo finished the season on 152 points, meaning so long as he gave a 32 points swing over Mercedes, Red Bull would still outscore Mercedes.

This means  Checo would have had to race Australia (where he scored 10 but didn't affect Mercedes who finished 17 (RUS) and retired (HAM)) and also Japan where he scored 18 points to secure the constructors bronze medal for Red Bull.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.

Edit: To do the math, assuming teams pay their full bonus, McLaren employees got a 20% increase in bonus compared to last year, and Red Bull employees got a 16.67% decrease. Now, teams might not choose to pay this much in bonuses. Individual teams might have goals they have to meet to get their bonuses by their individual employee contracts. Just like teams don't have to spend the whole budget cap in the first place. For instance, it might be in Red Bull's employee's contracts that they have to place top 3 in the WCC or no bonus at all. But they might have something much more lenient. Just like driver contracts, we don't know what are in employee contracts.

Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""

He is only talked when, “Yuki deserves the RB seat” instead of him. But I want to talk a bit about “his” carreer. He drove only 5 races in 2023 and 6 in 2024. He did not even completed a whole season worth of races, two seasons combined. He lacks of experience especially compared to Yuki’s “4 full seasons” of experience. I believe he is a decent driver and can be a regular top 10 if he gains experience. For now, of couse if there’s somebody to be promoted, it is Yuki. But it doesn’t mean that Liam is a bad driver. He didn’t even have a full season worth of drive (11 races in total, correct me if i’m wrong), so it is not reasonable to compare the two and saying Lawson is bad.  He should gain experience to avoid RBR’s Gasly & Albon situation.  Also, even though how much I want Yuki to promote to the dark blue car, I don’t think Red Bull would gave one of the seats to a Honda driver considering Ford engines will come in 2026. But maybe they do, who knows right?? Anyway.. Any comments about Lawson? ","[""He has potential, but he needs to be given a proper season with winter testing included.

However, it is a shame that RB doesn’t want to give Yuki a chance and hence Liam is getting hate from the crowd that would like to see Yuki given a chance.', 'I don’t think he’s anything exceptional but he’s definitely alright? I can’t really fathom an opinion on him because of this short period of time. Also he has had an unremarkable junior career but of course that can vary because of different factors', ""I think he's a very adaptable driver who gets up to speed quickly - as evidenced by his record of winning first race out in almost every junior category he competed in, as well as his solid first F1 showings when thrown in the hotseat. However, I don't personally think he has a particularly high ceiling in terms of ability.\n\nHe deserves a place in F1 based on current form, and if things go his way he can probably have a solid career as something of a journeyman, but I don't think he's the right guy to put next to Verstappen."", ""The worst thing that could happen to Lawson right now, is to get promoted to being Max's teammate. We've seen experienced drivers like Ricciardo and Perez, and rookies like Gasly and Albon, either meltdown or not live up to the absurd expectations of that seat. Lawson needs to be aware of that, because his performance at the start WILL be subpar, but that awareness will help him properly improve his racecraft in time, and also convice Horner that everything is progressing in its proper time. If he does all that, by the late season he could be right behind Max, which would already be enough for Red Bull.\n\nAnd yes, the exact same applies to Tsunoda."", 'The problem with saying that Lawson should be put into that rbr seat, because he has the potential to develop into a better driver than Tsunoda is, that this is not what the second rbr seat is for. It is there to secure the WCC and help Verstappen to win the WDC and for that the only thing that matters is how good a driver is now. \n\nAnd right now Tsunoda still has an edge over Lawson. So if they drop Perez, he should get the chance. And let Lawson develop in VCARB for a season or two.']",0,44,0.42,0,42,42,0,9,0.02999999999999997,0

New fan here, started watching F1 last year.

I’ve been doing some “research” for a while now. I’m currently watching every race from the 2012 season.

I simply hate how they used to display the gaps between drivers. You need to check the time really fast as it will soon disappear and show the gaps for the next group of cars.

I find it hard to follow on how the race is at that exact moment, comparing to nowadays where the times are always visible.

There are other things I don’t like, such as the radio messages, which have bad audio quality and that’s understandable, but providing subtitles doesn’t require that much technology.

The way they show the starting grid is also horrendous.

AND YES! I KNOW THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO AND IT MAKES SENSE TO BE WORSE!

With a lower resolution and less horizontal space on screen, having a vertical timing tower at all times would take up way more space, and they never changed that even after going widescreen in 2007 and eventually HD in 2011.\n\nThe fact that this finally changed in 2017 after Liberty took over suggests that this weird presentation style was something Bernie was still in charge of, which seems strange."", 'Yeah, people love to hate on Liberty but it was when they took over in 2017/2018 that the telemetry and presentation had a huge boost.', 'However many times I watch quali now, I just cannot get used to the double reference times on the new graphics.
