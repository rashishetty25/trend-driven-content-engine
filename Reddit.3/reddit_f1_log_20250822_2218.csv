1mwxb2u,What happened to Ferrari in 2005?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mwxb2u/what_happened_to_ferrari_in_2005/,2025-08-22, Discussion,"I’m in the middle of F1TV’s story of the season (the best thing on F1TV from 2000-2016), and while it does an amazing job of describing the F1 season week to week, I find it does a spotty job of describing the Ferraris’ step back in 2005. The story of the season focuses on Fernando’s rise but doesn’t spend much time on the decline of the Ferrari as a car, instead making Michael and Ferrari a secondary story on the season. The Ferrari returned to front row competitiveness in 2006, so what on earth happened in 2005?","[""They changed the tyre rules so you couldn't change your tyres during the race, and from memory also had to qualify on these tyres."", ""regulation changes that were designed to slow down ferrari and advantage the michelin tyre runners, in the process improving the racing by reducing the dirty air effect.\n\nthese included changes to the front and rear wings, the diffuser, and the introduction of a rule mandating that engines had to last for two race weekends, instead of manufacturers dumping new engines in each race.\n\nhowever, the biggest change was the rule surrounding tyre changes. the FIA literally made it a rule that you were only allowed a single set of tyres for qualifying and the race, meaning you weren't allowed to pit for tyres unless there was a puncture or rain started to fall.\n\nthis encouraged the usage of harder compounds which massively favoured the michelin runners, in turn screwing over ferrari who used bridgestones."", 'F1 introduced some of the dumbest rules ever.', 'Besides the one tyre rule, Michelin and Renault also started to work closer together and sharing their knowledge for both tyre and car suspension design. \n\nThis collaboration started to shine in 2005', 'They changed the tyre rules so that you had to do the full race on one set. That rule was 100% made to stop Ferrari/Bridgestone’s dominance, and it worked.', 'There were both Bridgestone and Michelin tyres. \n\nGenerally speaking, Bridgestones were faster, but didn\'t last as long. (Nothing much faster, but maybe a tenth or two in exchange for shorter stints) Michelin tended to be more race pace over qualifying pace. Bridgestone also specifically built for Schumacher/Ferrari, so by this point only the Jordan/Minardi were on them as well, the rest were on the more ""Fair"" michelin.\n\nAs usual with rule changes, the fia want to nerf the best team. They tried to find ways to make the Ferrari itself slower, but they were just better everywhere that they did themselves. So the only thing left? Something out of their control. Tyres. \n\nMichelin were better at longer runs in general, so they thought to play to that strength, and to them the best way was to use one set for both qualifying and the race. It worked, Ferrari won once, because Michelin screwed up and they all pulled out.\n\nThe aero did also change, but it didnt majorly affect much for Ferrari, they were still nearish to the front and in races the tyres worked properly, they were exceptionally quick, such as Imola.', 'F1 changed the rules specifically to fuck Ferrari over, primarily the no tyre changes during a race rule and you had to start the race with the fuel you qualified with. This was back when Ferrari had the best pit crew and pitstops on the grid and had Bridgestone making their tyres around Ferrari\'s needs. This is also why Indy 2005 happened too. If 2005 was a normal year with in race tyre changes, that fiasco doesn\'t happen.\n\nThere was no standardization in the tyre compounds between Bridgestone and Michelin so in general, Michelin tyres were harder and lasted longer compared to the Bridgestones, so the Bridgestone runners (IE Ferrari) got absolutely fucked by the new rules.\n\nI think the straw that broke the camel\'s back for the FIA to think ""We need to do something about this"" was that race in Magny-Cours where Schumacher made a 4 stopper work and won.\n\nThe fact that these rules were ditched the very next year says everything you need to know about them.', 'Short answer: FIA', 'Tyre rules have changed to specifically battle Ferrari and their tyre supplier Bridgestone.']",255,70,0.92,255,1411,1411,5,0,0.0,5
