In one of many introspective moments, revealing both Wolff’s struggles with mental health and his endearingly literal way of expressing himself in his second language, he explains: “Susie’s emotionally much more resilient than I am. She’s mentally stable, somebody I can rely on. I have episodes where I’m really depressed. So I say, ‘I’m a bit like an Arabian thoroughbred.

With Interlagos on the calendar this weekend, I’ve been feeling a bit nostalgic. I went back through the history of Formula One season finales since 1990, and it reminded me how much the end of the year used to feel different.

1985 - 1995: Australia (Adelaide) closed the season

1996 - 1999: Japan (Suzuka or Jerez in ’97)

2000 - 2005: Mostly Japan or Malaysia/China

2004 - 2008: Brazil’s Interlagos - the golden run of finales

2009 - 2025: Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina Circuit has taken over ever since


For me, Interlagos just has something no other circuit can replicate. The atmosphere is electric, the weather unpredictable, and the fans make it feel like the whole sport’s heartbeat is right there in São Paulo. Those finales gave us so many iconic moments - Raikkonen’s 2007 title shock, Hamilton’s 2008 “Is that Glock?!” drama, Vettel’s 2012 charge through the field.

Abu Dhabi has its glamour, but Interlagos always delivered chaos, emotion and pure racing theatre. I sometimes wonder if my fondness for it is just nostalgia - because so many emotional memories are tied to it being the last race - or if it’s genuinely the perfect place to end a season. It's just such a great track in any case.  

What do you all think?
Do any of you miss Interlagos as the finale, or has Abu Dhabi earned its place?","['Absolutely: Interlagos is a great track with tremendous atmosphere, Yas Marina is a terrible circuit with no atmosphere. It reflects so badly on F1.', ""2016 would have been a lot more interesting with Hamilton slowing down in sector 3 and Rosberg having to pray Vettel of Verstappen didn't try any unconvential overtaking spots.\n\nInterlagos was the perfect ending and instead they replaced it with a track that perfectly represents the FIA."", 'I am biased but I would rather have the gran finale in a tradicional circuit rather than those petro ones.

Obviously you're not gonna void the results of an entire GP just because 1 team cheated. You'd just disqualify the cheating team.\n\nYes, F1 and the FIA handled the 2008 cheating scandal terrible. This is a fact. But if they had handled it appropriately Lewis would still be world champion that year.\n\nMassa's entire argument is just bad."", ""No race would ever get voided if a team deliberately cheated and affected the outcome, the team/driver would just get disqualified.

Its a pointless chase for money. And the chances he gets even a cent are 0.1%\n\nCrashgate played no part in Massa losing the title. They can retroactively DSQ Renault or annul the race and it changes nothing."", 'This just gets more and more embarrassing as time rolls on.\n\nWhile it\'s completely ridiculous that Briatore is back in F1 today, along with others who were involved, the facts are really simple:\n\n* The results of the 2008 Singapore could not be annulled, because that would have unfairly affected every other driver on the grid.\n* Even if retroactive penalties were issued and Renault were disqualified from the 2008 WCC, and their drivers from the 2008 WDC, Hamilton still would have won the title.\n\nI can appreciate Massa being angry about missing out on the title and the money, but in the same respect why would the FIA annul the results of a race and penalize people who weren\'t even involved. They\'d effectively have been stripping Rosberg and Hamilton of podiums, as well as Glock, Vettel, Heidfeld, Coulthard and Nakajuma of points.\n\nI\'d be really interested to hear more on the fact that the FIA apparently knew about cheating before it became public, but asking for anything more than ""give me a whole truckload of money"" is ridiculous, and even then it\'s a stretch.', 'fernando is faster than you.']",139,77,0.88,139,75,75,139,77,0.88,139

It was a disastrous day for Williams as both drivers, David Coulthard and Damon Hill, spun out. Hill’s race went from bad to worse when he slid into the gravel while attempting to return to the pits to serve a stop-go penalty for speeding. Just recently, Hill had signed a £5 million contract with Williams for 1996, but rumours were already surfacing that Frank Williams was reconsidering. Reflecting on his season, Hill admitted, “I’ve never felt this bad. I’ve made mistakes this season, I can’t deny that. Just when you think it can’t get worse, it does.The McLaren of Mika Hakkinen came home in second, with Schumacher’s teammate, Johnny Herbert, finishing in third.

This is the first season in at least a decade where two drivers on the same team were consistently in the running for the WDC.  In previous years, it was clear that either Max or Lewis was going to win, so even if their teammate could beat them in a race, it makes sense that the team would want to hold them back to avoid jeopardizing the title. 

In this case, in contrast, there isn't an obvious frontrunner - it's been relatively close all season, and they are now within one point of each other. 

I see a lot of talk about Papaya rules, so I am curious how Mercedes and Red Bull (and I guess Ferrari, not that they've been in contention recently) would handle this.

I've seen people post sector times and other data, and I've looked at OpenF1 and similar projects, but to the best of my knowledge:

1. There's no information on car setups and internals (like tire temps, body temps—is that even a thing? Does lower temp improve driver performance? At the very least, in Singapore and Qatar the effect of ""bad"" climate is clearly felt)

1oiv4k6,Hamilton’s Ferrari Struggles Mirror Vettel’s 2020 Decline,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oiv4k6/hamiltons_ferrari_struggles_mirror_vettels_2020/,2025-10-29, Discussion,"No disrespect to Lewis, but his situation right now is like that of Vettel in 2020 and both battle to even get on the podium and Leclerc is out-qualifying and out-racing both. Lewis's record against Leclerc existed below Vettel's achievement against Leclerc in 2020.

His interviews are negative and resigned after every race. The SF25 has taken a step backward from the SF24, but it's still not as disastrous as the SF1000 had been when Vettel had been forced to spend his final season at Ferrari in 2020. And let us not forget, Leclerc is no easy teammate; Vettel's form went off a cliff after those two years, and he often fell behind Stroll.

Should Lewis choose to continue past 2026, the same attern may well unfold with the Britton","['I think Lewis suffered with overinflated expectations compared to what was realistic for him.\n\nCharles is a fantastic driver and in most people’s top 3 on the grid, and time waits for no man, even Lewis Hamilton, so there’s no shame in being slightly slower at this stage in his career.\n\nHe had a slump mid-season but early on and in the past few races he’s been right where Ferrari want him and where Carlos was last season, slightly slower than Leclerc but nowhere near the gap that Tsunoda or Antonelli have to their teammates.\n\nAnd Ferrari still could get P2 in the WDC which would reflect really well on the drivers considering the car they have to work with.', ""After wasting Kimi, Seb, years off Charles' career and now Lewis, it's absolutely bonkers to me that people still suggest that it isn't the team's fault.\n\nNone of these drivers forgot how to drive. The team refuses to listen to criticism because of dumb politics and egos. That is all."", 'Bad comparison.\n\nLewis is actually improving the gap between him and a prime Leclerc rather than declining as the season goes - you only need to look at the stats', ""nah. lewis is slower but in qualy it's a tenth or two since the rear suspension came and in race it's like 2-3 tenths in clean air. not as bad as vettel for sure"", ""I don't agree at all.\n\nHamilton's form has been steadily improving. He's also fresh into the team (although of course we are late into the season now) with his teammate in his 7th year with the team.\n\nVettel's form, I can't precisely recall. But 2020 was his 5th year at the team, with his teammate only on his 2nd year and his 3rd year in F1.\n\nSo I would say actually the situation is the polar opposite of Vettel vs Leclerc, although there may be similar results and attitudes."", 'I’ve been fairly impressed with Lewis if I’m honest. Like Sainz he seems to be progressively improving and getting closer his team mate as he gets to grips with the car. \n\nAlonso is still kicking around so no reason Lewis can’t still be very competitive. \n\nIf Ferrari has a dominant car next year. I think Lewis may even stand a chance of a championship as I’m not sure if Charles can stay consistent under the type of pressure a championship brings.', ""No, no it doesn't. Lewis form is actually improving quite a lot and he's adapting to the Ferrari. People had expectations on both Ferrari and Lewis such as fighting for the WDC, which is why it looks as if he's had a bad year. But yeah, he's doing quite well lately pace wise."", ""2020 Seb was a result of an awful divorce. His lack of performance was further fueled by Ferrari's incompetence and politics reaching the lowest ceiling of each parties. Lewis is still far from that."", 'i think if ferrari is fast enough in 2026 he will fight for wins\n\nmight as well compete for the wdc for some races\n\nbut winning it seems unlikely', 'At least Vettel could get a podium.\n\nAnd that was in the 6th or 7th fastest car, not the 2nd or 3rd fastest car.']",0,34,0.27,0,31,31,0,5,0.07,0
