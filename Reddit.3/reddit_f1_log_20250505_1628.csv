1kex55f,TV Directing this Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kex55f/tv_directing_this_season/,2025-05-04, Discussion,"Straight to the point, the TV Directing this season is insane and very unlike the last few years. 

Issue #1 - Cutting away at critical moments.
China - Max vs Norris pit exit they cut away to show Leclerc's regular pit stop.
Bahrain - Instead of showwing Piastri crossing the finish line in 1st they showed Norris and Russel who weren't fighting that close.
Miami - Max vs Norris on lap 16 cutting to a replay of the previous overtake.
(So many more examples)

Issue #2 - The timing board not showing the intervals or just not working at all.
Issue #3 - The unnecessarily long shots of someone in the Crowd/VIP section in the middle of the race.
Issue #4 - Taking too long to show a replay of something we missed.
Issue #5 - The lack of Radio Replays & often times the extreme delay of them (Ex. Miami Qualifying- It wasn't until 10 minutes later, after doing the interviews did we get a replay of max's reaction to him getting pole).

This issue wouldn't be much of a problem if all I had to do was switch broadcasting channels, but F1 doesn't work like that because the same display is given to every channel world wide and the best thing I can do is open up all the tabs from multiviewer and make my own version of a TV Directing with the onboards.","['There has been a notable, marked change for the worse.

Personally, I think comparing it to Sochi or Valencia is a bit over the top. Today‚Äôs race was pretty solid, especially the first 20 laps with Max going at it with the McLarens. There was genuine tension and some real overtaking opportunities across the track.

That said, I still have gripes. The chicane under the bridge is awful, clumsy and out of place and I really wish there was some grass or gravel to punish mistakes. The ever-present concrete runoff strips the track of consequences and character.

At times we were able to extract much more potential from the tyres than this weekend, and from that comes the performance."" Going into the substance of the race, given the lacklustre pace and the fifth force on track - with one Williams in front and the other just behind the two SF-25s - the focus was on the drivers\' team radios and Ferrari\'s race strategy. ""We were the only team to swap on track today, but I think it was the right choice. Lewis had a softer tyre and we wanted to try to catch Antonelli. We followed our internal rules. When we saw that he could not catch Antonelli, we did the swap again,‚Äò said Vasseur, who defended the team\'s choice. ‚ÄôIt is never easy to ask drivers to give up their position, but they obeyed and I think it was the best choice.\n\nNow there will be a week\'s break and then Formula 1 will return to Europe, with the first of the two Italian races, and Ferrari will have to try to redeem itself at Imola, where Frederic Vasseur is convinced we will see a better SF-25.

Only 6 times in the most dominant period the sport has ever seen did Mercedes have as big a gap as this at the end of a race,

Spain 2014, Brazil 2014, Spain 2015, Canada 2015, Belgium 2015 and China 2016.

And in all of these races Mercedes were on pole and led going into the first corner other than China 2016 where Ricciardo led into first corner but got a puncture a couple of laps later.

The McLaren's were 3rd and 6th after lap 1 today and still pulled this gap. ","[""That's because they didn't want the FIA to find out how strong their engine was.\n\nMercedes pulled 24 seconds in ten laps in Bahrain 2014 while fighting around every corner, including 4.6 seconds in the very first lap after the safety car restart. They could have lapped the entire field every week if they wanted to.\n\nThis was a huge victory for McLaren but that Merc was something we might never see again."", 'A little side note: Mercedes had the engine turned down for the majority of 2014. Especially at the start of the season. They actually thought they would lap the field if they didn‚Äôt turn it down. Which isn‚Äôt a crazy thought considering how much better the engine was than Renault and Ferrari.', 'This is so hard to determine though because most dominant teams build a gap and then cruise to the finish. Turning down the engine and just managing the race comfortably. \n\nLook at Bahrain 2014 as an example of just what Mercedes were capable of when they really wanted to. After that late race safety car Hamilton and Rosberg were battling each other fiercely costing each other time and yet they were still pulling out seconds per lap over the 3rd placed car. \n\nOr look at 2021. Hamilton and Verstappen pushed each other all the way and so they were often 1-2 and close together but some 30-40 seconds ahead of their team mates who would be 3rd. This shows just how much they would keep in reserve during their dominant eras and how much they could have crushed the field if they really wanted to push all the way when there wasn‚Äôt another driver/team to fight with. \n\nSo ultimately this stat is meaningless because we never see the best of what dominant teams/cars are capable of because they keep it hidden unless someone comes along to push them into revealing their true pace.', 'Thanks for updating this stat. The fact that Max is in contention at all given how 2014/2015 Merc were compared to the rest of the field is incredible', ""McL was dominant today but still not the most dominant we have seen in this period. It's pretty important that they both had to push because they were racing each other and not managing the race comfortably, and the race had no SC/Red flag to close the gaps unlike others, while the VSC gave them 5-10s of racetime to their nearest competitor (VER), who was compromised by RUS a bit at the end as well.

However I do think saying the success of Red Bull in the ground effect era is due to Newey is very overstated. I think Rob Marshall was the key to the RB18‚Äôs and especially the RB19‚Äôs success. Red Bull‚Äôs first upgrade package after Marshall left Red Bull late May 2023 was I think the first upgrade where they claimed they made a misstep. Furthermore, Marshall‚Äôs new team is McLaren. After gardening leave he got to work on the MCL38. The first upgrade package was the Miami upgrade. The race which Lando won, and the first race where McLaren made arguably the quickest car. His first full fledged McLaren is this year‚Äôs MCL39. While it‚Äôs no RB19, it‚Äôs eerily similar in high deg tracks. Newey was famous for the suspension design of the RB18, but I think the aerodynamic prowess of especially the RB19 was due to Marshall. ","['Adrian Newey was in F1 when MSC was smashing everyone with Ferrari. He was also in F1 when RBR got smashed by everyone all the time. He is a genius, but it takes more than 1 person to win a WDC/WCC.', ""So Marshall is the water in the tires guy and Christian knows he's doing it because he did it for them - confirmed."", 'Case against Newey? No.\n\n\nCase that Newey wasn\'t the only great man at Red Bull? Absolutely.\n\n\nThere have probably been other great people over the years. But just for one moment people might know. When McLaren realized in front of the DTS cameras they\'d had a terrible miscommunication so the Honda engine didn\'t actually bolt to the chassis correctly.\n\n\nIt wouldn\'t matter if Newey was a total wizard, if he didn\'t have a support staff who could translate that to reality. And I\'m sure in many case, take his general input, and actually iron out the details.\n\n\nIf Marshall has been the magic at McLaren. Zak did a lot to make the team ready to take advantage of it. New facilities, great people, seemingly a good atmosphere. It means a lot.\n\n\nThe old quote that goes something like, ""The more preparation I do, the luckier I seem to be"".\xa0', ""I don't think the two ideas explored here (Rob Marshall was/is a core component of Red Bull's success in the GE era and Adrian Newey is the Maestro who made RBR tick) are mutually exclusive, nor do I think we can weigh the two against each other per se.\n\nNewey has talked repeatedly about how he views himself as leading a team of engineers and designers while still very much being *the*  architect of the cars he's in charge of. Rob Marshall being the chief of car design and implementer of his vision (which I think is the opening anecdote of Newey's memoir) can easily fit the vision of both of them being integral to Red Bull's run of dominance. \n\nI'd also say that the real way to test this would be to see Red Bull having a prolonged run with Newey but without Marshall, and we just don't have that data. The reporting on the Christian Horner sex-pest fallout makes it very clear that Newey was checked out at Red Bull for sometime before the announcement (at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix, which is your inflection point for Marshall at McLaren) that he was leaving Red Bull and that Red Bull technical leadership had been shifting for sometime to the rest of the team.\n\nTo put it differently, I think there's a very strong case to be made that Rob Marshall is an elite designer in the Ground Effect Era, but that's not zero-sum with Adrian Newey not being elite and it's going to be incredibly hard to disentangle the effects (hah) of Marshall from Newey at Red Bull. The best way to test this is to see how next year's Aston Martin (which should be a Newey product) compares to its McLaren competitor, and how they develop from there."", 'Newey might not be the miracle worker some think (watch Aston Martin become championship contenders next year) but the guy still left an huge impact on red bull', 'I‚Äôve always thought that. The bloke is a genius but it isn‚Äôt just a one man thing. People can‚Äôt discredit the team of brainiacs working alongside him.

I read that somewhere around the time he was moving. I don\'t think he is responsible for the car concept. But his joining McLaren does coincide with them coming up with lots of flexible wings.\n\nI think this might be a case of ""correlation does not equal causation"". He is one part of the equation for sure. Without the flexi wings, I think McLaren would have scored fewer points last season and possibly this season.

It seems nowadays (maybe because of social media) that the young guns like Kimi Antonelli and Piastri had a lot of buzz around them when they were starting out.

Was it the same for Lewis when he started out? Was he considered some generational type of prospect? He seemed pretty competitive his first year and I believe won a WDC in his second year with McLaren.
","['He got signed to Mclaren at what 13? so yes I‚Äôd say he was hyped, and is a generational talent', 'he had the same amount of points as his teammate, the reigning world champion, and missed out on one point in his rookie year for wdc. i assume that everyone knew that he‚Äôs the next best thing then', 'At the time is was basically unheard of for a rookie to join a top team. Even Verstappen with all his hype joined the RB junior team. Hamilton went straight into McLaren with equal status to Alonso because they knew how good he was. That told us how good he was.', 'To answer your question, yes, Lewis was indeed a generational talent.\n\nIn his debut year with McLaren, alongside a seasoned Fernando Alonso (let\'s just call him the ""Schumacher Slayer"" for all intents and purposes), he not only outshone his veteran teammate but lost the championship *in his rookie year* by one point.\n\nAs you point out, he went on to win in his second year and would then absolutely *dominate* during the hybrid era while at Mercedes.', 'he would‚Äôve won a wdc on his first try if it weren‚Äôt for him getting stuck in a pit entry', 'By people not blinded by race, Lewis was considered generational.

Before my time but massive hype in GP2, was even better than expected as a rookie.', 'People knew Lewis was going to be good. He blew away very strong fields in Formula Renault UK and Formula 3 Euro, and won the GP2 title (as F2 was then known).

Andrea Kimi Antonelli misses pole position by 67 thousandths of a second, leaving teammate George Russell in the dust. Ferrari is nowhere to be seen. Even experts struggled to explain the qualifying result in Miami.**\n\n> McLaren is dreading a fast qualifying lap. The slightest mistake is enough to lose pole position. For the third time after Suzuka and Jeddah, Max Verstappen is taking advantage of this. In the first two cases, it could have been attributed to the track layout. Suzuka and Jeddah feature mainly fast, flowing corners.\n\n> The Miami Autodrome is different. Only the first sector is Red Bull territory. The rest is almost exclusively made up of tight corners that require a lot of maneuvering. Not exactly Red Bull\'s specialty. Until Q2, things were fine. Verstappen pulled away from everyone in the first sector. The McLarens made up the deficit in the other two sections.\n\n> Only in Q3 was everything different. For the first time, Verstappen lost less time in the second half of the track than he gained at the beginning of the lap. There were three reasons for this. Verstappen managed a nearly perfect lap, apart from a small wobble in Turn 1. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri made too many mistakes.\n\n> **Unusual result.**\nFinal fine-tuning of Red Bull\'s setup minimized the damage in the slow corners. But the most important factor was the track temperature, which had dropped from 44 to 38 degrees Celsius by the end of the session. McLaren couldn\'t exploit its strength of keeping the tires in the window throughout the entire lap as much as it had in Q2. The opposition suffered less, however.\n\n> With the minimal gaps in the field, the condition of the tires determines the lap time. Small things have a big impact. If the tire is too cold or too hot, it provokes mistakes. Verstappen, Piastri, and Antonelli in the first corner. Russell, Norris, and Hamilton in the hairpin at the end of the straight. When, like Andrea Kimi Antonelli, they\'re only 0.067 seconds behind the fastest time, it\'s doubly frustrating. ""I was too greedy in the first corner.""\n\n> At least it was enough for the rookie to once again win the team battle at Mercedes. George Russell only started from P5: ""Qualifying has actually been my strength this season. But whatever has worked so well so far isn\'t working here in Miami. Kimi did a great job. He drives a little differently than I do. This obviously puts the tires in a better window. I didn\'t find confidence. It went from one extreme to the other. It was the worst qualifying of the year. In the end, fifth place ‚Äì it could have been even worse.""\n\n> **Are used tires faster than fresh ones?**\nSometimes things get really complicated, as in the case of Ferrari. ""We were faster on used tires than on new ones,"" puzzled team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur. Lewis Hamilton saw things somewhat differently. He would have liked to have had two new Pirellis in the Q2 session instead of just on the second run. ""If we\'re already having trouble getting into Q3, it would probably be better to try it twice with fresh tires. We\'ll have to discuss that again.""\n\n> Charles Leclerc couldn\'t pull himself out of the fire in eighth place either: ""Something was strange today. We need to analyze it. I was completely outside the window of the car. From Q1 to Q3, we had to make a lot of changes. That\'s unusual. But it never felt good. It hurts when you\'re doing your best and your best in a Ferrari is only P8.""\n\n> The Monegasque lost four of the seven tenths to the opposition in the first corner alone. The Monegasque set the fastest time in the final sector. This isn\'t the first time Ferrari has struggled with this problem. ""We also gave away three tenths in the first corner in Jeddah,"" Vasseur reveals.\n\n> This clearly indicates that the tires are heating up too slowly. In qualifying, this is a killer. In the race, it can be a wildcard because it reduces tire wear over the distance. Then a Ferrari is almost as good as a McLaren. The difference is that the Papaya races can do both: fire up the tires quickly and keep them alive over the distance.', 'Why don‚Äôt they have a tire that‚Äôs somewhere between the intermediate and wet, or even a hard/soft intermediate. I feel the full wet is worthless, unless it‚Äôs quasi-undriveable conditions.', 'What was Lewis talking about two set of new tyres for Q2 for him to get through? He took two new sets in Q1, and you need to keep one set of new soft for Q3 or if you don‚Äôt get to Q3 it will be for the race, so he only has one new set for Q2. He doesn‚Äôt have two new sets for Q2. Or he is implying the team should only use 1 set of new in Q1 but it risks him not getting through Q1‚Ä¶', ""The inter is just an incredible tyre. There's no need for a tyre in-between the wet and inter because the inter can cope with a wide variety of conditions already. \n\nThe wet is just super slow. The inter is multiple seconds a lap faster."", 'They should have only 1 wet weather tyre. WEC for example only has a ""full wet"" equivalent and it works perfectly fine.\n\nSave money, avoid wastes, make it really hard to simply race a wet tyre into a dry track so that strategy and driver\'s abilities are even more important.', 'BRING BACK THE GROOVES!\n\nBut only as a special inter-intermediate compound!', ""I think he meant that if you're unsure if you're going through to q3, it's better to use two new sets in q2 to make it through, instead of saving one set but then not making it through. If you need to, you can do q3 on the used sets"", 'Exactly, the irony us that Pirelli designed a very great tyre with the inters meanwhile the full wets having such a narrow window between too dry to use and too wet to race for the cars that it only works on a flat track and when the race has been started.', ""Yeah. Realistically we just scrap the wet tire. \n\nCall the intermediate wet. They won't run in conditions that a wet tire will be the choice. It looked like it in Brazil last year.

But as soon as McLaren takes the lead in the race, Piastri and Norris disappear over the horizon. It\'s as if they could drive every lap like they did in qualifying. After 57 laps, their lead over third-placed George Russell was 37 seconds and over world champion Verstappen was almost 40 seconds. ""They\'re in a league of their own,"" team principals Toto Wolff and Christian Horner had to admit.\n\n> The match winner was the same on Saturday as on Sunday. The McLarens kept their tire temperatures within the desired range. All the other cars\' tires eventually overheated. In the sprint, the McLaren drivers broke away from the field at the exact moment their intermediates became too hot on the drying track. In the main race, the game was over when Piastri and Norris prevailed against Verstappen. The Red Bull\'s tires were already so close to the red that Verstappen\'s bag of tricks was no longer of any use in defending his position.\n\n> **A completely legal trick.**\nToto Wolff marveled: ""They demonstrate their superiority on every tire type. We have a similarly fast car to them, but only on one lap. McLaren can reproduce that every lap."" His colleague Horner sees differences depending on the track and outside temperature. ""Their advantage is always greatest where the tires are most stressed. That\'s why we looked much worse in Miami than in Jeddah.""\n\n> Conclusion: McLaren must have something beyond high downforce and balanced car balance. Wolff praises the rival: ""They\'re not doing anything illegal. We have no doubt that they\'re operating within the rules, whatever they\'ve found."" It\'s becoming increasingly clear that the McLaren engineers have a clever solution for keeping the tires cool. ""Five degrees makes a huge difference,"" explains Wolff.\n\n> This is precisely what\'s troubling the opponents now. ""We don\'t know,"" asserts the Mercedes team principal. ""But we\'re working hard on it. We\'re not just sitting back and watching, but trying to find the key through experimentation and development work."" According to Wolff, the McLaren secret isn\'t some kind of brainwave, but the product of continuous improvement of the car since the major turnaround at the 2023 Austrian GP.\n\n> **Find the key as quickly as possible.**\nRed Bull is taking a different approach. The dethroned class leader is firing on all cylinders at McLaren in the hopes of eventually hitting the mark. Somehow, people in Milton Keynes don\'t want to believe that everything is above board. But they also have no idea what could be causing McLaren to let its tires caress themselves like that.\n\n> After the Miami GP, team principal Christian Horner initially expressed his conciliation: ""Hats off to McLaren. They taught everyone a lesson today. They\'re doing a better job with tire management than the rest of the field."" On one point, he agrees with colleague Toto Wolff: ""We need to find out as quickly as possible what McLaren is doing. Whatever it is, it could be a match-winner next year as well.""\n\n> Clearly, the trick has nothing to do with the current ground-effect cars. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella, of course, offers no explanation. He only says: ""We have to thank our engineers for creating factors that allow us to keep the tires within their window."" The Italian admits that some aspects can be carried over into the new era of Formula 1, while others need to be adapted to the 2026 cars and their aerodynamics.\n\n> **A clever air circulation.**\nStella also denies that her exceptionally good tire management in the race has nothing to do with the problems that sometimes make it difficult for drivers to set the perfect lap in qualifying. ""We don\'t pay a price per lap for caring for the tires better than others. It\'s no problem for us to get the tires into their working window quickly."" In qualifying, drivers are more likely to complain about a lack of feel for the front axle.\n\n> The opinion is now gaining ground in the scene that the engineers in Woking have found a particularly clever solution for circulating air in the brake ventilation drums, keeping the brakes hot while keeping the tires cool. The external shape of the drums is standardized. Inside, you have complete freedom. You\'re not allowed to install any explicit cooling elements, but you\'re not restricted in the choice of materials.\n\n> An insider speculates: ""Perhaps they circulate the air in such a way that it stays cool in the crucial areas and shield the heat through the use of certain materials."" Chief Technical Officer Rob Marshall is said to be the father of the system. He has been carrying the concept around with him for years, but has only now made it work. That would be bitter for Red Bull. Marshall was at Red Bull for 17 years before moving to McLaren in early 2024.\n\n> Stella also made an interesting statement. ""Even when it gets hot, our car stays cool. We\'ve developed a very efficient cooling system."" This also affects tire temperatures. If the car as a whole gets too hot, it radiates to the tires. Stella\'s statement also explains why the McLaren is near the back in terms of top speed. More cooling reduces efficiency.', '9 other teams HATE this one simple trick.', 'So basically McLaren could keep dominating into the new regulation unless the others figure out what the magic trick McLaren are doing with the tyres.', 'Signing Rob Marshall was a big coup for McLaren.', 'TLDR: McLaren keep their car cooler, how? ü§∑', '>If the car as a whole gets too hot, it radiates to the tires. Stella\'s statement also explains why the McLaren is near the back in terms of top speed. More cooling reduces efficiency.\n\nWould be hilarious if the actual solution is ""we wrapped the power unit in a few extra layers of insulation""', 'Time for the other teams to hire some mclaren engineers', 'How much of their dominance comes from finding this ‚Äúmagic trick‚Äù versus them finally having use of a new wind tunnel?', ""1) Be fast\n\n2) Don't be slow \n\nTruly revolutionary.

1kfdtuo,Audi gives Binotto new role in F1 project,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfdtuo/audi_gives_binotto_new_role_in_f1_project/,2025-05-05, News,"In just under ten months, the time has come: Audi will enter Formula 1 as a factory team. Behind the scenes, hard work is being done to get the adventure off to a flying start, and to ensure that things go smoothly, Audi has adjusted the team's structure. In the new setup, Mattia Binotto has been given a new role. The former Ferrari team boss was previously chief technical officer and chief operational officer, but he has left those positions.

Binotto is now responsible for the overall development of Audi's 2026 Formula 1 car. The Italian has been tasked with optimising the coordination between the chassis and the powertrain. According to the German manufacturer, Binotto must do this by tightening up existing processes so that the development of the technology and the various departments within the organisation run more efficiently.Until now, the chassis and engine were overseen by different managers, but now everything falls under Binotto. It is no easy task, because Sauber has locations in Hinwil in Switzerland and Neuberg an der Donau in Germany, while a development centre is currently being built in England. Binotto is therefore tasked with ensuring that all locations work well together.

Newly appointed team principal Jonathan Wheatley is now solely responsible for the running of the racing activities. Wheatley and Binotto must jointly manage the transformation of Sauber into the Audi works team.

The F1 project falls under Audi Formula Racing GmbH and that branch has undergone further changes. CEO Adam Baker is leaving, making that position redundant. Experienced engineer Christian Foyer is the new operational boss and will focus on the development of the hybrid powertrain. Chief technical officer is Stefan Dreyer, who will also take on the role of spokesman.","['He‚Äôs a damn good engineer but just isnt the leadership type. For NFL people think Norv Turner is offensive coordinator vs Norv as head coach.', 'Again the Audi livery is so sick...

1kfb055,Where did drive through penalties go? Time penalties are often not appropriate/enough of a disadvantage. +10 should be minimum time penalty.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfb055/where_did_drive_through_penalties_go_time/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"The last drive through penalty I remember was ~~Hamilton at Silverstone 2021~~. It feels like in the last few years they have been abandoned in favour of +5 time penalties.

We have seen several times drivers not really be affected by a +5. Max has shown them to be worth 'tanking' to get clean air, protect tyres, and pull a gap to neutralise the penalty. He's even gone as far as to laugh them off over the radio. We also saw Haas in Saudi Arabia use the second car to block the following pack to neutralise a penalty.

I just don't think these +5s are enough of a deterrent for the incidents they are usually being applied to.

Thoughts?","['Hamilton got a 10s penalty that race, not a drive through.\n\nAlso, the current regulations require 10s penalties for those incidents, rather than 5s', ""This was discussed last year - and actually the drivers successfully lobbied last year to have the baseline penalty increased to +10, for the reasons you stated. The KMag/Haas battle worked because they essentially tanked KMag's race for him to hold back the others from Hulk - even though he dropped way down, Hulk was protected, so the team net gained from the penalty, regardless of the length of the penalty.\n\nIt has been odd to see more +5s penalties this year. Max's penalty in Saudi was 5, and not 10, likely because it was the first turn in the first lap, so there's usually leniency anyway. \n\nI agree that drive throughs etc. should be used more, and that if you're going to have a penalty system, it needs to be stringent enough to actually deter the behavior it's intended to deter. But I don't know that we're seeing a new trend toward lighter penalties this year, or an overall issue within the penalty system that there has been movement to correct in the last year or so, but the implementation isn't great."", 'Norris received a drive through penalty in Qatar 24 for failing to lift under yellow', 'Yup, we are in a very uncanny valley with respect to penalties at the moment.\n\nThe fix I think is to have permanent stewards so that we get consistent penalties.', 'I fully concur - 10s or more, minimum. Absolutely. Also, I\'d love to see substantially more disqualifications for driving standards.\n\nI don\'t at all buy the argument that strategic acceptance of penalties is ""just driving to the rules the way they are."" That\'s BS. They\'re *rules*. If you\'re playing the game, you\'re agreeing to *rules.* You don\'t just break them when it suits you because you can handle the consequences, you follow the rules because it\'s the sporting thing to do. Taking any kind of penalty because you think it\'ll be a net positive is very, very bad sport. If you like watching that sort of thing, then you must be really enjoying racing that\'s adjudicated off the track and after the race. For me, I\'d rather people drive with intellectual honesty and in the spirit of good competition.\n\nThe cars are still going to go 300kph. Let\'s not pretend like holding people to higher standards won\'t still result in good racing. 90% of the overtakes in Miami were very clean and thrilling to watch.', ""I'm pretty sure that Alonso and Hamilton both got drive throughs last year, and Norris got a stop-go which is even worse.\n\nI do think that in situations like Jeddah the penalty should be that they have to give up the position, and if they don't do so in a couple of laps they get a drive through."", 'Indeed, FIA race penalties are much like government fines for corporation misdeeds (in the US at least).  Just the cost of doing business where the benefit gained is greater than the cost of the punishment.', 'It\'s a bit difficult topic.\n\nWhen DT and stop/go were the only available options, a lot of time, fans lamented that DT was clearly too harsh for some minor infringements, we have to remember that gaps are much narrower and SC more frequent than when the penalty system was devised.\n\nBut now we have +5s penalties, there\'s the issue of the penalty being an actual benefit if the driver manages to complete a pass he wouldn\'t have without it.\n\nMaybe they should switch to a system of ""drop x positions ASAP"" as the penalty, but even with this one, there would be the obvious issue of it being way too harsh to someone who got their 4th track limit strike while being 40 seconds ahead of next competition.', 'Yeah it used to be that every penalty was a drive through.\xa0\n\nHamilton got one in Qatar last year for speeding in pit lane (race director and stewards went crazy that race) but other than that they are very rare.

I am in Munich right now, and was wondering how to watch F1. The internet suggested me to go to Killian Irish Pub (I am no sponsored by them), the environment is very vibrant. I have been to a couple Irish pubs for football matches when I was in US, but did not get a chance to meet a lot of fans of my team.

This time for the Miami Race, I met this Australian guy, who was cheering on for Oscar since the beginning of the race, and made it a festival as Oscar overtook Max. He bought a bunch of drinks too.

Apparently his kid used to race with Oscar back in the day. A bunch of us from different nations, randomly started chatting with him and got to know more about him, and basically had a lot of fun. I barely at my phone as I was mostly was either chatting or listening to the stories through out the race, and missed how Ferrari screwed the strategy yet again. And there was one Polish guy among the group, I think who does the drink I got (Heineken) and suggested me a great beer. 

I guess what I want to ask is, you guys have any such stories with you. I bet back in the no internet days, you had more time most of us had the time to talk to people. Have you had any such fun stories? Met random guys who can rally the people and make it a joyful occasion?

1kex0hm,Should Ferrari have swapped the cars earlier?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kex0hm/should_ferrari_have_swapped_the_cars_earlier/,2025-05-04, Discussion,"I feel like a lot of the discussion around this topic is being heavily influenced by Sky sports coverage and Lewis‚Äôs radios. But from my perspective, it‚Äôs not as clear cut as it seems

But why didn‚Äôt Ferrari swap them?

First of all i‚Äôve seen some people saying ‚Äòthey kept him behind for 10 laps‚Äô ‚Äòshould‚Äôve swapped before they overtook Sainz‚Äô. So why didn‚Äôt they swap before they overtook Sainz? Lewis just wasn‚Äôt close enough. 

The VSC cut Charles‚Äôs advantage over Lewis and Charles pit a lap later.

Lap 31: Charles is on one lap old hards that are not properly up to temperature, Sainz gets past and Lewis 2.3 behind.

Lewis does gain about a second that lap on Charles, but Charles is now behind the williams and it‚Äôs cold hards vs a lap older mediums, and since Ferrari in particular have faced issues warming up hards, a pace difference is expected

For the next almost lap, the gap lingers around 1.2-1s, but Lewis doesn‚Äôt properly break DRS until the VSC is called.

So between lap 30 and the end of the VSC on lap 34, there was no opportunity and Charles uses the VSC restart to get past Sainz and Lewis comes along with him.

The way the overtake happened meant Lewis was instantly in Charles‚Äôs DRS. Which means he never actually got into Charles DRS on his own. He had one lap where he was much faster but even over the next lap before the VSC, he couldn‚Äôt do much to get into DRS.

But now he‚Äôs in it, seems to have the better tires and better pace. Why didn‚Äôt Ferrari swap them on lap 35? Well, by the back straight, Sainz is in Lewis‚Äôs DRS and Lewis is 0.6 behind Charles at the point where DRS would open. No question that they could not risk a swap then.

What about lap 36? Well back straight, Lewis is almost 0.8 behind and Carlos is still within DRS. No question that they couldn‚Äôt do the swap that lap.

What about lap 37? On this lap, Lewis does manage to lose DRS to Sainz but by the back straight? Again over 7 tenths back with Sainz less than 1.2 back. Still way too risky.

What about lap 38? Starting to look more viable as Sainz fell back a bit in the lap but by the back straight he caught up a bit and it‚Äôs Lewis 0.6 back and Sainz 1.2 behind again. That‚Äôs still a very uncomfortable margin for Ferrari to mess with, considering that Sainz proved that the Williams has the pace to keep a Ferrari behind it. Last thing they want to do is risk losing p8.

What about lap 39? Well that‚Äôs when they finally did swap.
Lewis 0.7 behind at the point where DRS opens and Sainz now over 1.6 behind.

By the start of the pit straight Sainz is 0.9 behind Charles. If that‚Äôs done a lap earlier that‚Äôs 0.5 by the start of the pit straight at least, leaving Charles incredibly vulnerable. 

So I truly don‚Äôt think there was an opportunity to swap the cars before the lap they did it on. They maybe could‚Äôve done it, but it‚Äôs an unnecessary risk. It‚Äôs one thing to tell Charles not to fight if Lewis has the pace to overtake. But this required Charles to slowdown and they did not have enough of a margin behind for that to be comfortable.

I want to add that i‚Äôm not an expert, i‚Äôm just a fan giving my insight and all my information is from youtube live timing not any official source. Also the lap is based on where the leader is so when it‚Äôs lap 36 but i‚Äôm talking about the back straight then the drivers are probably actually on lap 35  ","['This is the debate topic of the week sorted.', 'Imagine being paid to be a strategist and the most obvious scenario wasn‚Äôt planned out.

1kf905o,"Vasseur is a peoples-person, but is it Loic Serra why Ferrari is failing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kf905o/vasseur_is_a_peoplesperson_but_is_it_loic_serra/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"I think that Ferrari‚Äôs current struggles might be related to simply technical leadership (or lack thereof). Fred Vasseur is a people-oriented team principal and I love him and of course he is getting a lot of heat (rightfully so), but the true problems of Ferrari lie in technology. Their current technical lead is Loic Serra, who joined from Mercedes, but let‚Äôs be honest, Serra was never the lead technical architect at Mercedes as far as I know. He was head of vehicle performance, not aero or chassis concept, and not responsible for top-level technical direction. At Ferrari, he holds a critical role without a proven record of leading any of this.

The result? Ferrari is heading in the wrong direction, their car concept feels like a patchwork. They messed up their progress from last year which gave me way too much hope, but SF-24 was still spearheaded by Enrico Cardile.

Serra is just not up to the job.","['The SF-25 was pretty much done by the time Serra joined the team in October. The car was made with Fred in the interim TD role.', 'No, because he joined in october 1st and by the time he joined the SF-25 had already been designed. His focus is on the 2026 car and some of the upgrades this year.', 'I don‚Äôt know how many times it has to be said: Ferrari‚Äôs problems stem from Ferrari‚Äôs upper management and the culture within the organisation. It is not one individual‚Äôs fault, it is the overall way the team is run by people above Vasseur‚Äôs pay grade. \n\nMcLaren is the most obvious example. McLaren with Ron Dennis was successful and the way he worked paid dividends until one day it stopped working and it was doing more harm than good. McLaren did not persevere, they didn‚Äôt just replace him with someone from within the organisation, because those people were highly likely to do the same thing again. They knew they needed to break the team to the ground, oust those rigid people and rebuild it. It was an incredibly brutal decision to take  and it could have gone very wrong without the right person in charge, but it ended up being the correct one. They got rid of the traditionalists, the Dennis disciples and started from scratch. It took years for them to make it to a stable level as an organisation before they even started to fix their technical knowledge issues. \n\nWilliams is running the same plan. They were stagnant for years  because of tradition. The Williams family wanted to keep the team but it wasn‚Äôt the right decision for the team. Clare Williams was not the right choice to run that team and it cost them. They went outside of the family and made a decision to get outside influence into their organisation. Vowles is proving to be the right choice for Williams‚Äô revival and they‚Äôve changed the way they are working. \n\nFerrari meanwhile‚Ä¶promoting engineers and hiring Leclerc and Hamilton‚Äôs old team principal from years ago. They hired what fit into their structure as it is. They didn‚Äôt go outside of that box, they didn‚Äôt take risks and they‚Äôll keep doing it over and over again. Ferrari would never make the kinds of decisions that McLaren made, they‚Äôd never be able to take the leap of faith that Williams are taking. Ferrari cannot afford to spend years struggling, hiring and firing and scrabbling like those two. It‚Äôs not in their DNA. That‚Äôs why Ferrari is stuck.', ""Serra joined the team too late to have any large impact on this current cars state at the beginning of the year. He came in October, well after the development and critical decisions for this car would've been taken."", ""As someone mentioned, Ferrari needs to be broken and rebuilt, like what Vowles did with Williams. What is happening on the track is just a snapshot of how the company runs. Ferrari is relying on it's prestige and national pride, and it won't succeed until the culture and it's philosophy is reimagined."", 'It\'s because of politics, not bc of an individual. Also, not sure they are ""failing"". Ofc, on the sporting side, they are. Massively. But their objective isn\'t necessarily that.', ""See this post sums up why Ferrari are where they are. It must always be an individual's fault never the team.\xa0\n\n\nYou would think with how McLaren and seemingly Williams have turned it around it, more people would realise that sometimes there are core issues that need to be dealt with but nah.\n\n\nSame old, same old. If we just replace this one guy, next year will be our year‚Ñ¢."", ""This isn't WEC, or MotoGP or some other category. All the talent needed to win is in the UK and only a very small fraction of that talent is willing to move to Italy. Ferrari is the only team without a base in the UK and that makes it impossible to win. \n\nOf course, this makes sense if you understand that Ferrari only cares about selling shirts and hats and other merchandise to make money and not actually winning.\n\nThe people who care about winning at Ferrari are probably in the GT and Hypercar departments."", 'Next Year, then?']",0,21,0.22,0,19,19,0,0,0.0,0

However that applies to every team in any situation involving penalties. Also, from a racing point of view, getting penalties sorted out sooner rather than later is generally considered to be a good thing.
