Hulkenberg completely lost the rear on seemingly normal acceleration on the exit of T3/4, having to save multiple severe oversteer moments that put him into the gravel, damaging his floor and effectively ending his race. Later on in the lap, Bortoleto was in a battle with Bearman, and turned in relatively normally into T8 and instantly lost the rear in a basically unsavable moment that put him into the gravel, taking him out of race contention as well.

Both of these moments can be viewed here:¬†[https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z\_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68](https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68)

If one of these drivers had experienced this alone, it would be easy to put it down to driver error. However, the appearance of a similar issue on both cars in the first lap in seemingly innocuous moments when the drivers weren't even trying to make a move, leads me to believe that there was potentially some sort of issue on the car, or more specifically, the tyre preparation plan that the team had in place during the formation lap (ie number of burnouts, target tyre temp). It seems likely that the team made a miscalculation that resulted in the rear tyres being out of the window on both cars to start the race.
