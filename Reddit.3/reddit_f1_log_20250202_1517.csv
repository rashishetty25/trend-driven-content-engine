1ifgf8d,Mark Hughes: The key reason Honda's engine 'struggles' are lost in translation,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ifgf8d/mark_hughes_the_key_reason_hondas_engine/,2025-02-01, News,,"['I thought this was worth a post, given how [quite a few people here interpreted Watanabe\'s ""we are struggling"" quote as an admission that Honda were behind.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ich0xz/planetf1_honda_issue_important_update_on_f1_2026/)\n\nIn short (emphasis mine):\n\n> But these comments are probably best viewed through a ‘Lost in Translation’ lens. What Watanabe seems to be describing is just how technically challenging the new PU formula is, especially around the electrical motor and battery which have been conceived to deliver around double the power of the existing F1 electrical motors.\n>\n>...\n>\n> So, based on decades of observing this sort of thing, I’d say those comments do not mean what they are being interpreted as meaning. **I’d say, it’s Watanabe’s second language and he’s striving to get across the inherent extent of the ‘challenge’ of the whole process.** In the early stages of any tough challenge, it will by definition be a struggle. Similar ‘struggles’ you can be sure will be taking place at Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull to greater or lesser degrees. \n>\n>...\n>\n> So Watanabe’s comments will for certain have generated headlines suggesting that Honda is deep in trouble with the programme, maybe even manifesting the ghost of the company’s initially disastrous hybrid motor of 2015 and perhaps how this is potentially awful news for Aston Martin’s future prospects with its ’26 Adrian Newey wonder car potentially stymied by a feeble motor.\n> \n> Forget it all.
