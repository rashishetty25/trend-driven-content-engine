In the past days we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating Hulkenberg's podium.

So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance.

(Twelve because that's what the newest rookies have done so far.)

**Sprints are not included.**

**Race Head-to-Head:** Only includes races where both drivers finished. If a driver completed enough of the race to be classified but retired due to a crash or mechanical issue, that is treated as a DNF.

**Qualifying Head-to-Head:** Only includes qualifying sessions in which both drivers set a valid qualifying time. If a driver didn’t participate in qualifying at all, didn’t set a time, or their time was dropped for a violation of the technical regulations, that weekend wasn’t included and is listed as a DNQ in the table.

**Qualifying Time Differential:** Uses the time from the last qualifying session in which both drivers participated. For example, if one driver made it to Q2 and the other was knocked out in Q1, the Q1 time is used for both.

**Use of Average (Mean) for Qualifying Gap to Teammate:** Because the chart for qualifying gaps uses an average, some drivers were helped or hurt by a single bad qualifying session. The two most extreme examples in each direction are:

* Oscar Piastri crashed during Q3 of the 2023 Canadian GP due to weather, which meant that his lap for that session was 3.303 seconds slower than Lando Norris. If that qualifying session was dropped, he would only be 0.174 slower than Norris instead of 0.434.
*  Pierre Gasly’s teammate Brendon Hartley set a time that was 12.858 seconds slower during Q1 of the 2018 Azerbaijan GP.

1lvbg6m,Safety Car Restart Procedure,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvbg6m/safety_car_restart_procedure/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"The SC restart procedure has always been a bugbear of mine. I feel there are so many better ways to do it that don't involve slowing down significantly to allow the SC to 'escape' - possibly losing tyre temps and just causing general havoc.

Surely there are better ways to restart?

Option 1 - Send the SC into the pit a lap early - at which point, all vehicles are under a Virtual Safety Car. Paint a new line towards the end of the lap, at which point the VSC ends - and the front driver is now the SC and can restart at any point as they do now, with no overtaking until the SC line. They no longer need to completely slow down to allow the SC to 'escape' to a safe distance. Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap. (Maybe not VSC - maybe speed limited is the better wording)

Option 2 - Move the SC line further into the track rather than at the pit lane exit - meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap.

Probably many other ways to do it.","[""I think better communication would be enough. The problem at Silverstone was:\n\n* The call for the SC to come in was made late.\n* The teams didn't have any advanced knowledge the SC was going to be in that lap - the first the drivers knew was the lights going off.\n* Because they choose to bring the SC late they turned the lights off at a high speed part of the circuit, only Oscar could see the lights had gone out. Max didn't expect Oscar to slow to restart speeds (because he was unaware the SC was coming in).\n\nHad race control put the SC in notice out in the complex or - at worst- maggots and Becketts there would have been no issues. The SC would have had more time to escape, Oscar wouldn't have had to slow down to such a low speed to build a gap."", ""Option 1. The point of the VSC is that cars are to maintain the time gaps. This is obviously impossible at the end of the SC period when everyone is bunched together. The problem is track layout dependent. Any track with a substantial front straight tends to benefit the cars following the leader if the front car doesn't game the situation somewhat. You'd end up with the situation that many race leaders going into a SC lose their lead when SC ends and this is what the SC shouldn't really do.\n\nOption 2 is just confusing."", ""> Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap.\n\nIt may? Mate, SC gets called in once it's safe to bring it in. Once that's happened, it'll almost always be safe to restart as well. You'd be delaying things by a lap in almost all cases of this.\n\n> meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap. \n\nAlso, this frankly hasn't been a valid concern since they disallowed overtaking before the start finish line. Before that, you need to create a gap to ensure cars wouldn't be racing past a safety car that's still out on track. Nowadays, creating gaps and whatnot is purely done for gamesmanship.\n\nIf that bites someone in the ass, it's genuinely their own fault."", 'I like your options but I disagree that it solves the fundamental issue.\n\nThe problem is not that the SC has to “escape” because they really don’t have to. Under the current rules, once the SC light goes out the leader becomes the SC, so he can theoretically be chasing down the SC, so long he doesn’t overtake SC. \n\nThe problem is that the leader “feels the need” to get as much advantage as they can at restart, which means gaming the car(s) behind. I believe this is the thing to solve. At the moment, the way to do this (consistently) is to slow down and start at your own pace.\n\nThe problem this race is a combination of 2 things: safety car coming in message late (meaning leader cannot anticipate the SC light going out), plus Oscar continue accelerating and then slow down so abruptly AFTER SC lights go out. He could have coasted or follow SC closely, but that will diminish the advantage he could gain at restart.\n\nTLDR: there is no rule demanding the leader to “slow to restart speed” or let the SC escape. They do that to game the cars behind. That’s the real problem to solve.', ""I don't get all the fuss about the safety car procedure just because Piastri did some dumb shit.\n\nThe safety car turned off the lights at the start of sector 3 as it is normal.\n\nPiastri doesn't have to restart into the first corner of sector 3. He doesn't need such a big gap.

1lvto64,"The Verstappen phenomena - what makes a ""generational talent""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvto64/the_verstappen_phenomena_what_makes_a/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"Greetings, everyone.  With this post, I’m hoping to get some opinions/feedback from “higher-level” subscribers on the Max Verstappen phenomena. 

First of all, apologies regarding the “higher-level” categorization.   I don’t mean to denigrate more casual racing fans – I’m very grateful for you, guys and gals… the sport would not exist without your support.  I’ll try to explain what I mean below... 

I’m a racing instructor myself.  It’s not a job – it’s something I do as a hobby on a voluntary basis.  That said, I’m quite quick myself (well… I used to be), but I turned out even better as an instructor.  I’ve been an obsessive student of the art of racing myself for many years.  My specialty is the more “advanced” level of students.  I teach both classroom theory as well as spending time in the car with quite advanced students, many with competition licenses.   

So, the usual platitudes… i.e. “*Max is a generational talent*”… or “*he can drive cars nobody else can drive*” – those are mostly cliches lacking substance to an ear like mine.  So… I’m hoping to get a bit more substance from people who know more than me. 

Back to my question…

I’m struggling with the Verstappen phenomena.  Unquestionably, he’s a spectacularly talented shoe. But the part that’s really confusing me is the “second car” issue in Red Bull.  The simplistic explanation is something along the lines of “*that Red Bull is a tractor, and only Max can drive it due to his superhuman skill*”.  But I don’t buy that line of argument. 

Allow me to unpack…

All racing drivers naturally prefer a car that’s pointy and loose – clearly that’s Max’s preference as well.  This, of course, goes to karting days for most drivers (those who’ve competed in karting will understand).  Max is not unique in this preference – but, there is a spectrum.  At some point, a car becomes “too loose” for a driver.  Clearly, Max’s level of comfort is on the far extreme of that spectrum. 

But… does that make Max unquestionably the “best driver on the grid”?  I’m not saying that it doesn’t, but I’m not necessarily sure that it does either. 

For instance, there is a delta between older drivers (who learned to drive entirely by feel) and the new generation of talent – the ones who grew up driving simulators.  Drivers who are particularly good in a simulator will prioritize “*visual*” driving – with their eyeballs and the “*algorithm*” running in their heads overriding other physical senses.  This will then translate into a certain type of execution in a real car – provided that the sim replicates the car’s actual dynamics accurately.  Think Lando vs. Ricciardo.  I don’t think, for instance, that Lando is a better driver than Daniel.  In fact, throw both in a car they’re unfamiliar with – and my money would be on Daniel all day.  That’s because someone like Daniel drives the car by the “seat of his pants”.  Lando, in the meantime, (I suspect – this isn’t a statement of fact) is probably much better at translating the “*algorithm*” he learned in a sim into a more mechanical execution on the track.  In other words, he’d be less bothered by some peculiar characteristics of a car (because he simply notices them less) than an “old school” driver like Daniel (who would be much more sensitive to certain dynamic characteristics of a car than a good sim driver). 

Btw, I’m not denigrating sim drivers.  Being able to translate what you learned in a sim into real-world execution (while ignoring your own lizard brain) is a skill unto itself – it’s a skill I don’t personally have and I wish that I did. 

Another factor is the natural driver’s preference.  Like I said – all drivers like a car that’s (comparatively-speaking) loose and pointy.  But, again, it’s a spectrum.  Myself – on that spectrum, I prefer a car that pushes a little more.  It prompts me to rotate it more aggressively – and it’s something I can do quite well.  I have confused many 911 drivers by chasing them down through twisty bits in things that appear far too heavy and far too “front-engined” to make sense to them.  But put me in a rear-engine car and, suddenly, I’m out of my comfort zone.  I’ll be slower in something that’s supposed to be faster simply because the “sensations aren’t right”. 

Max is clearly genius at driving an extremely loose car (which also makes him spectacular in the rain).  It seems to fit his natural preference (informed by his days in karting).  He also, notoriously, spends countless hours in a sim.  That means his brain is well adapted to overriding and ignoring other physical characteristics and sensations based on the visually-tuned algorithm in his head.  Etc. etc. 

But then it leads me to a question – what would happen if Max had to drive Lando’s car?  Would he master it?  Or would Lando drive circles around him?  I suspect that he eventually would master it… after spending hundreds of hours in a sim.  But, does that truly make him a “generational talent” purely in terms of his driving talent?  Or does that make him exceptional at more mechanistic application of certain sim-learned parameters and being able to ignore other sensory inputs (which traditionally defined an “exceptional driver”)? 

Hence, I struggle with the idea of Max being a “generational talent”.   Strangely, it’s precisely the issue of the “*second car*” – the one that others point to as “proof” of his talent – that gives me pause. 

If the “*second ca*r” was routinely qualifying second and third, and then Max would still find a way to be consistently half-a-second faster -  then the “generational talent” thing would be much easier for me to accept. 

Anyways… I’m hoping for some thoughtful comments/opinions from well-informed Redditors that go beyond the usual platitudes. 

Thank you in advance for your thoughts.  ","['New copypasta just dropped', 'I think you\'re missing the other things max does. Like yes he drives sims but he is also mastering cars in there.\n\nAnd people on track have talked about how Max can go into a car (any car) irl, drive a lap or two, come in, look at the data, and find exactly where and why he lost time, and start putting up perfect/near perfect laps immediately.\n\nOr the fact that the other week he went to nurburgring, and reportedly drove a lap record with more fuel, and traffic (though it\'s not official because it was in a practice session).\n\nMax being an avid sim driver isn\'t why, he\'s so good at driving, it\'s a symptom of it.

He just, breaths racing.\n\nSo no, I don\'t think if he was in lando\'s car, he\'d need hundreds of hours in a sim to be on par with lando. I think, he\'d already be there, if not get there within a few sessions. Or far beyond him. And Max thinks so too (hence his, if he was in the Mclaren you wouldn\'t see him comment).\n\nYou don\'t get to F1 at 17 years old because of a sim.\n\n\nFound source from one site I mentioned\'\n\n>Max Verstappen’s rate of improvement in sportscar test stuns observers\n\n>One observer couldn’t believe what he was witnessing as Verstappen repeatedly shaved significant chunks off his lap time. He naturally had high expectations given the calibre of driver on display, but he was still surprised.\n\n>He said: “I know what to expect from this kind of guy. In this case, it was something really unexpected. He was improving the lap time at a level that normally doesn’t exist in real life. You are really surprised even if you expect it.”\n\n\nAnother quote, this is from sim racing (though the sims are almost identical to life, and talent in there is very impressive, and Max himself actually believes there\'s more talent there, because F1 is a rich person\'s sport and as such, so much talent is lost because they can\'t afford it)\n\n>Atze Kerkhof, a Redline driver/manager\n\n>""Sometimes you do a lap and you think it\'s perfect, but then Max enters the track and goes another three tenths faster,"" Kerkhof tells Autosport. ""Where he finds that time, is a mystery to everyone.\n\n>""It\'s about very small details. The steering angle, the slip angle of the car, the way of trail braking or downshifting. It\'s very small things where he makes the difference.\n\n>""What Max does, is almost impossible to imitate. His driving is so perfect.""\n\n\nMax is genuinely just that good\n\n\nEdit 1:\n\nIm having to do edits to reread your post. As for your bit about lando and Daniel, I disagree. The reason Daniel was kicked out of F1, is because in the current cars, he couldn\'t adapt. He, similar to how Lewis drives, has a way of driving, and couldn\'t change that way of driving / \'drive by his seat\' or the exact phase you used, and that\'s why he was so much slower in these regs. And you\'re wrong about Lando too, about the wouldn\'t notice small things.\n\nHe does. And he\'s affected by them. That\'s why Mclaren specifically designed a part for him, which wasn\'t an upgrade (a side grade, it made some parts worse, some parts better), which is was gave him his confidence back over the last couple of races. He was affected by the car, in ways he couldn\'t fully communicate (there\'s not enough to know how much specific F1 drivers are with their engineers, some are rumoured to be very good with their engineers, some more on feels), which is why he had such low confidence, because he couldn\'t \'just find it\'.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nAlso I believe you\'re wrong about sims / sim racing, personally of course. You refer to it as the drivers more learning an algorithm, but I don\'t think you understand how realistic and immersive they are. Yes, you can get butt kickers (which Max and pros don\'t like, they say it makes you slower which I believe) and all these fancy equipments, but it\'s not that. Alot of the sim is in your eyes, ears, and hands. What you\'d feel through your body, you\'re limited to only feel through your hands, however this doesn\'t mean you focus less on your body, it\'s just a slightly different sensation, that works the same. You still rely on your senses, and your hands to *feel* as you slide slightly, lock the rears, etc, but sim racing is an easier way to get access to F1 levels of information about your driving, without having the... You know, F1. Brake pressures, lines, everything. You can stick any pro F1 driver in the sim, and after a couple sessions, they\'d be good, because it\'s that similar. You can\'t feel the car as much, but your lines are the same, you can still feel it, only just through your hands, if anything, it\'s actually probably harder, because your spatial awareness may not be as good (fov of the screens etc).\n\nEdit 3:\n\nAs for the second seat of the RB.', 'Disclaimer: I’m not a racer, never have been, and I don’t understand the technical aspects of it, so I understand I’m not your intended audience, but it’s reddit so I’ll comment anyway.\n\nBut I just wanted to touch on your last point. When Checo was finishing second behind Max and they were running off into the distance with Max still beating him comfortably, people basically said they were driving a rocket ship and any driver would win in that car.\n\nSo I tend to think the fact that it’s now how many drivers (Checo, Albon, Gasly, Yuki, Liam) have also driven it and couldn’t beat him, or even get close. And they are generally great drivers. He wasn’t paired with De vries and Mazepin.\xa0\n\nOn the other hand, if all those drivers were second/third behind him, then the rocket ship claims probably run true, with Max just being a slightly better driver than each of his teammates.\n\nIn other words, I don’t know 😂\n\nIf he goes to Merc and they win next year, it’ll be probably be put down to the new regulations, otherwise that would have been a good benchmark!', 'Asking Max to outquaify the second car by half a second when it starts right behind him in terms of grid spots is absolutely ridiculous in this era of F1. The sport is too refined and the cars are too close for this to be a reasonable expectation.', 'Ever seen Whiplash?\n\nThat.', 'The helmet design', 'Just want to add something to your ‘seat of the pants’ theory about Ricciardo. There was an even crazier feel of the car type: Senna drove the car in some kind of subconscious trance once he got in the rhythm; completely zen and not even actively thinking anymore, just feeling every single part of the car with his brain and doing what’s needed to get it around a corner, faster than humanly possible with theory alone. I don’t think there’s a driver like that anymore and don’t think it’s even possible anymore with these days’ cars.', 'Interesting… thank you.  I didn’t know some of these things about Max (I don’t follow drivers outside of their F1 performance). \n\nP.S.   side note - being good in a sim isn’t really a “symptom” of being a good driver otherwise.  It’s a skill unto itself, really.  I know plenty of exceptional shoes who are absolute dogsh*t in a sim.  \n\nFor an older driver - getting into a sim requires a certain rewiring of the brain.  \n\nIt’s much easier to start in a sim and then make your way into live racing than the other way around.', 'Your comment is actually helpful - does remind me that Checo would occasionally find success in that car too.  Though he was very inconsistent.  And Checo has a history of being strangely successful on certain circuits no matter what’s he’s driving. \n\nMore importantly - Checo was a “last-gen” driver.  I think it was a similar situation to my Lando/Ricciardo example… where a more “instinctual” driver would actually be at a strange disadvantage to a younger, sim-trained driver when it comes to a really twitchy car.', 'I’m not asking Max to do anything.  I’m trying to figure out, in my own head, how good Max actually is.  And the fact that the second car is so far behind… in the hands of multiple drivers… is more confusing to me than helpful - in terms of gauging how exceptional Max actually is.']",0,18,0.25,0,16,16,0,18,0.25,0
