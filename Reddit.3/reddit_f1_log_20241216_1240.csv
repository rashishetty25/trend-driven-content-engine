Who to support now ?\n\nHello everyone! Well first of all, I am happy that 2024 was my first season watch F1. Have always been a car guy and finally decided to watch a sport related to it. Was initially a bit iffy about it. Thought what would happen if Max wins everything like the last 2 years but this was one heck of a season! Don\'t just want to watch for the fun of it but actually be a ""fan"" of a team and driver. Thought I will watch the whole season and then decide who I want to support. I love Football as well and am a Real Madrid fan, a club with history, prestige and above all, most trophies. I want something similar for the team I support in F1. Ferrari and McLaren come to mind for ""historical"" teams. Ferrari were good initially and in the end but fell off mid season. McLaren were shit to start off but were brilliant after Miami. And I know this is a sport with a lot of nuance. I mean Ferrari haven\'t won a championship for so long, Mercedes were well on to till 2021 and how they have fallen.\n\nSo I do understand that a team will have dominating season but also mid seasons. As for the driver, I\'ll be honest, Carlos was the reason I started watching because he himself is a Real Madrid supporter. He had a decent season, am sad that he is going to Williams but let\'s hope he has a Brawn x Button season. I will support Carlos but I want another guy who can win a championship. (Carlos can win but doesn\'t have the car)\n\nI have narrowed down to Charles and Oscar.

Kudos to F1 for doing a great job marketing to the teenagers living in my house.

We are headed to the race in 2025 .

Should we buy our tickets nice and early?  (This is my preference.)

Or will we find better deals if we wait and buy tickets closer to race day ?

Get nervous about rolling the dice and prefer to book something in advance.

My plan is to buy good tickets for race day only rather than a three day pass .

I would complete rookie in this category and I'm looking for any suggestions you might have .","[""There's no 'better deals' in Vegas. :)   \nIt's more than twice as expensive as Monaco.  \n\n\nMatter of fact, you could probably fly to Monaco for the whole weekend and still end up saving money compared to attending the Vegas GP."", 'My advice is to go to a different race!

I’m planning to attend Silverstone next year, traveling from the US, and I’ve got a few questions.

Where’s the best place to buy tickets? The F1 website, Silverstone’s site, or StubHub/Ticketmaster/etc?

From what I’ve seen, Silverstone’s site seems to be the best deal—it was about €200 cheaper than the F1 site. Plus, the F1 site only allowed me to purchase tickets for all three days, while Silverstone’s site offered single day tickets.

Would it be better to buy tickets for all three days, or just for the race itself?

How’s the general admission experience? Is it worth upgrading to a grandstand seat, or is GA good enough?

I’d love to hear any tips or tricks you might have for a first-time racegoer!
