1h2jk4a,Interesting snippet from Saward on the FIA ethics committee firings,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h2jk4a/interesting_snippet_from_saward_on_the_fia_ethics/,2024-11-29, Discussion,"https://joesaward.wordpress.com/2024/11/27/green-notebook-from-sisimiut/

there is now a proposal for the President and Deputy-Presidents to be paid salaries. While I think it is a good idea in principle ... the problem is that getting a salary is actually against the ... Association Loi of 1901 which exists for non-profit entities in France.

This is a problem that Max Mosley ran into years ago when he tried to move the FIA to Switzerland and subsequently received a tax demand from the French government  ... Today the FIA remains under French law because it does not want to settle a tax bill and leave. However, there is a Swiss version of the federation as well. The two FIAs have consolidated accounts, but they are run under different sets of laws.

This .. worked fine until the President tried to claim expenses for his own private jet from the French FIA. He does not need the money (he comes from a mega-wealthy family) but he wanted to use the money to establish a fund that would be distributed to small FIA clubs around the world which struggle to pay their bills. ... it was pointed out that this scheme might be misinterpreted when there was an election ... as a way to buy votes ... 

...the audit committee questioned the idea and since then several of them, including the president Bertrand Badre and Britain’s Tom Purves, are no longer involved. This may also be why there have been changes on the ethics committee as well, and the reason that the compliance officer has just departed.

so many FIA people have left during Ben Sulayem’s presidency that they could all get together and organise conferences to discuss their stories. The latest to go, I am told, are two stewards: Tim Mayer of the US and Singapore’s Janette Tan. They follow the recently despatched F1 Race Director Niels Wittich and a lot of others, some of which have been reported upon and others who have not.","['I was under the impression that the President was entitled to remuneration:\n\n7.4 The President of the Senate, the Deputy President for Automobile Mobility and Tourism and the Deputy President for Sport may be entitled to remuneration within the framework of the performance of their elected mandate.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3a8k8/what_level_are_the_f1_academy_drivers_actually_on/,2024-11-30, Discussion,"Basically the title, but aside from the cars which are obviously even slower than F4, how good or how bad are the drivers? Obviously, Pulling and Pin would probably survive in a higher series or an open one in general, given that pulling does have some experience in British F4 and Pin even managed a podium in WEC which is quite impressive, but what about the rest of the grid? I'm assuming the ones with no points would probably also flounder in F4 regional, but do the top 5 or top 10 have a good shot at podiums in weaker f4 regionals, or even F3/F2 for drivers such as pulling and pin.

Furthermore, how do they stack up to actual F1/F2 drivers. Does someone like Bianca Bustamante actually have the skill to backup mocking actual f1 drivers like Lance Stroll, or would Lance Stroll in a wig lap every single f1 academy driver comfortably without breaking a sweat in equivalent machinery over a full grand prix length. Would a talented F3 rookie, like Piastri in his F3 years be able to smoke the girls even?

","[""Some of them race in Formula regional Europe (category right below f3) and I don't think they are doing very well. So none of them have any decent chance to get to F1, F3 maybe someone could reach but I think F2 is still too far away. We like to meme about how bad Lance Stroll is but the whole F1A grid including Bianca is far worse. Stroll is not a bad racing driver just a bad f1 driver"", ""\n>but aside from the cars which are obviously even slower than F4,\n\nThey're just standard F4 cars aren't they?"", ""Based on Marta García, who won F1 Academy last year.

And i think she has a good chance of winning f1a next year.\n\n""\xa0Pulling and Pin would probably survive in a higher series or an open one in general,"" - short answer no\n\nPin and Garcia (last year\'s champion) raced this in year in FRECA and they scored 0 points with a best finish of 13th and 14th.

Scored points but again nothing crazy in terms of championship position. Also freca scored points but only finished 17 behind drivers that only copeted in half the races.\n\nThere is a reason why F1a exists and that is why i do not agree with Flörsch at all that they should just compete in the normal ONLY.
