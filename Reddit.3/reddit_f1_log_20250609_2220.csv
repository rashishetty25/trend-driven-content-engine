STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

In MotoGP, when they refer to a rider’s world championships, they seemed to count *all* of their world championships— even the ones from other classes like Moto2 or Moto3.

Like, is there a practical reason why F2/F3 are less prestigious than Moto2/Moto3?', 'Hi everyone! I really want to go to an F1 race this summer. I’m debating between Montreal and Silverstone— I think Silverstone is super iconic since it’s HOME race to tons of drivers plus it’s one of the best races to watch. But for me, it’s abroad so I would have to fly out. If I was to go to Montreal, I would see Lance stroll who is one of my favorite drivers (don’t clown me) and I could drive there. I am 18 so I would be going to both of these by myself. I’ve never flown abroad before so I don’t really know how to go about the Silverstone trip. For Montreal, I was hoping to sleep in my car LOL. Anyways I want to go to the race that is most fun and will be most memorable and a happy experience. Let me know! I have money to spend.

Now I'm aware Lauda's crash in Germany 1976 was filmed, but, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think it was on the official broadcast. Other crashes that came to my mind are Mick Schumacher's Saudi Arabia 2022, Kubica's Canada 2007, Alonso's Brazil 2003, but ultimately imo I believe only Canada 2007 can compare in that sense as it really came out of nowhere as the camera just caught Kubica flying into the wall. What surprised me is that I didn't think of a single fatal crash there; I don't think Senna's accident was that dramatic visually, and honestly I am fairly certain Barrichello's crash was more scary than that (I believe Ratzenberger's crash didm't make the live feed, but might be wrong).
