1lyb8mf,An unexpected upgrade has transformed F1's midfield fight,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lyb8mf/an_unexpected_upgrade_has_transformed_f1s/,2025-07-12, Technical,,"['For me, as well as stabilising the car it looks as though they have some of the best tyre management on the grid now', 'Sorry for having to repost this. \n\nI broke the rule that did not allow editorializing the title when posting an article, and the original post was duly removed.

Even in last race they screwed Nico’s strategy multiple times if it wasn’t for Nico standing strong and making right calls the story would’ve been quite different especially since Gabi was out.', 'Is this the real APX GP 😱😱', 'Now what Sauber need is improve their strategy department. See what happened to Bortoleto in Silverstone.', 'Plan C for Combat', '> Sauber sporting director Inaki Rueda\n\nAnyone know if he is related to Fran Rueda, the LMGT3 Mercedes #60 driver?', ""They've got that Combat upgrade"", ""I think we may be SLIGHTLY overreacting to the Hulk P3.\n\nSauber has improved over the season, absolutely. That's proven by Gabi's improved qualifying and overall performance. But Hulk's P3 doesn't suddenly mean this car is top of the midfield like I've seen some people try to claim (perhaps not this article). It was a wet race where certain teams made dumbass strategy choices (Ferrari/Leclerc, Red Bull, Mercedes) and Hulkenberg is excellent enough of a driver to have capitalised on that. This race didn't necessarily need the fastest car.\n\nThat said, I don't want to come off like I'm downplaying Hulkenberg. He drove amazing, and when I say the race didn't need the fastest car; that doesn't mean P3 in a Sauber ISN'T impressive. This would not have happened in the Sauber of years before. My stance is that they're finally competitive with the midfielders, which can not be said about the Bottas+Zhou era sadly (they deserved better). But they'll still need a bit of luck to get the car into the points on any consistent basis, wherein I feel Williams/VCARB can get there on the car's merit.\n\nMy opinion remains that Williams is probably the fastest car on raw pace (but clearly unreliable as hell at the moment), but VCARB is perhaps not quite as fast, but while having very few technical issues. The only one I remember was Hadjar's balls being strangled. But the fact they've got two rookie drivers and are doing as well as they are means their car has gotta be somewhat solid. After that, it's kinda hard. Aston Martin have flashes of pace especially with Alonso in qualifying, but the car drops like a rock in so many of the actual races. Hulkenberg is able to pull off excellence in his car,  but I think Gabi's performance tells a bit of a different story over the season considering how amazing he was in F2. Alpine is dead last - Gasly can pull magic out of nowhere, but that car is horrific. It's like Red Bull if Red Bull was never actually good.""]",947,83,0.97,947,2757,2757,10,0,0.0,10

1lyxadg,Hulk's journey to the podium in 27 chapters,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lyxadg/hulks_journey_to_the_podium_in_27_chapters/,2025-07-13, Featured,"It's been a really long journey to the first podium for Nico Hulkenberg so I decided to detail it all, especially for fans who weren't following his career from the start.

**1. Malaysia 2010** \- after spinning on his debut in Bahrain and being taken out straight away in Australia, Hulk showed his worth for the first time. Qualifying a magnificent fifth for Williams at wet Sepang before scoring his first point the next day. Race was difficult and he went backwards and needed a steering wheel change which led to a very slow stop.

**2. Hungary 2010** \- his first big points-scoring drive. The German needed time to acclimatise in F1 and was generally outperformed by Barrichello and luck was not his friend. But in Hungary, he reached Q3 again, outqualifying his team-mate and drove a faultless race to finish sixth. That set him up for a better second half and he became a regular contender for top-eight results. Hulk impressed at Monza, not only leaving Barrichello far behind but also frustrating championship contender Webber, who only got through in the final laps. He did beat Kubica (who was a beast back then) though and their small little battles would become a common sideshow to the title fight. Hulk also showed that rain + Korea is his friendly combination and he ran sixth towards the end before a puncture dropped him to 10th.

**3. Brazil 2010** \- everyone knows what happened, early pit for slicks in Q3, bringing his tyres up to temperature and flying to pole position, a second quicker than everyone. He was unable to keep much faster cars behind on race day but eighth was a good result and again managed to fend off Kubica. But despite those positive performances, money issues led to Williams replacing him with fast but crash-prone Maldonado for 2011 and Hulk spent a year as reserve before returning to full-time drive in 2012.

**4. Valencia 2012** \- this was Hulk's first flirt with a podium. He was quick all weekend and was fending off Alonso who was in god mode that day until his KERS failed. Still he avoided trouble and was running fifth with two laps to go when Maldonado and Hamilton crashed in front of him. But just then, both Schumacher and Webber overtook him on fresh tyres. Michael got his only comeback podium that day while Hulk had to made do with fifth.

**5. Belgium 2012** \- Nico was main beneficiary of the first-corner pile-up and then overtook Raikkonen for second and ran there until the stops. Kimi got the undercut, Vettel one-stopped and jumped them both and Nico eventually finished fourth not far behind Raikkonen.

**6. Korea 2012** \- this is a period when Hulk's stock already reached high level after some excellent performances and Korea was arguably even better. Coming after strong seventh in Japan, he executed a perfect weekend in Korea, making a double pass on Hamilton and Grosjean to finish sixth. Unfortunately for him, Ferrari and Mercedes seats eluded him and he eventually went to Sauber next year.

**7. Brazil 2012** \- this was as bittersweet as it get. Giantkilling at its finest, moving up to third in the rain, before a correct call to stay on slicks and overtaking Button for the lead. Very unlucky SC nullified a big advantage over third and fourth placed cars. Still, Hulk managed to somehow stay in the lead in the dry until half-spin dropped him behind Hamilton. The German counter-attacked but slid into Lewis and ended his race. Nico was still second with penalty pending but the team reacted too late in switching to inters late on and he lost further valuable seconds. Yes, he made a high-profile mistake, but other factors cost him on that day too. Still, he finished fifth and was one of the stars of the season.

**8. Italy 2013** \- Sauber was uncompetitive in the first half so there is little to write about that. He drove well in Malaysia and China in situational moments before inevitably falling back when the weather and strategies stabilised. But Sauber got up to speed after the summer-break and he immediately pounced on that, qualifying a sensational third at Monza. A slow start cost him places to the two Ferraris but he stayed in fifth to the finish, impressively fending off Rosberg and finishing within sight of the podium.

**9. Korea 2013** \- perhaps his greatest drive yet. He got up to fifth at the start and was fending off Alonso then overtook Hamilton on a safety car restart. He then went on to impressively hold off the two all-time greats with former and future champions in Rosberg and Button also in the train. He followed that with sixth in Japan, only losing fourth to Alonso and Raikkonen late on. Another impressive drive was in Austin, where he qualified on the second row and again finished sixth. He lost ground due to Austin's dirty side at the start and then came second-best in close battle with Alonso.

**10. Bahrain 2014** \- Hulk was fast and consistent at the beginning of the campaign - sixth in Australia, fifth in Malaysia (only losing out to Alonso late on) and fought for the podium in Bahrain along with his team-mate Perez. He qualified poorly but drove a great first stint, overtaking people and undercut Perez in the pits and was lining up third-placed Massa, who was struggling. But Perez used their fight to overtake Nico. Hulk attacked on the late restart but Checo fought him off and Nico found himself overtaken by Ricciardo as well in the final laps while the Mexican fended off the Aussie to score his first podium. The small consolation was a fact Hulkenberg appeared in the top 3 in the WDC (behind the dominant Mercedes) for the first and only time after that GP.

**11. Monaco 2014 -** Nico was a model of consistency in the first half of 2014, usually the quicker of the two Force Indias only without the peaks of Checo. His best race was arguably at Monaco, when he overtook Magnussen at Portier to finish fifth. Hulk finished in the top six in 6 out of 7 races to start the season and had a ten-race scoring streak that came to an end in Hungary when he was over-optimistic on the restart on the drying track, perhaps sensing a podium finish, and crashed out after colliding with his team-mate.

**12. Abu Dhabi 2014** \- the second half of the year was arguably the first time that Hulk's stock dropped a bit. Things weren't going his way until the final race of the season. There he put a very solid performance to finish sixth, beating his team-mate, Vettel and two Ferraris. Overall, he beat Perez by 37 points in the standings.

**(Le Mans 2015)** \- this is a special entry but it cannot be missed even though it happened outside of F1. As everyone know, competing in WEC and F1 in the same year is generally a thing of the past. But Hulk signed with Porsche, drove a preparatory race at Spa before coming to Le Mans in June. They were a third extra team alongside two full-season entries but in the night the race fell to them. Hulk was instrumental in that, driving a very impressive shift after sunset and got among the leaders before team-mate Tandy put them well in the lead and Bamber controlled them race from there. Hulk was given the honour of taking the chequered flag to achieve his biggest success to date.

**13. Austria 2015** \- Force India took a step back in the first half of 2015, but Nico continued to drive at a decent level even though just scoring points was sometimes difficult. Hulk's form peaked around Le Mans time and a week later he impressed by qualifying fifth and finishing sixth around Red Bull Ring. He did well by finishing seventh in uncompetitive car at Silverstone, even running fifth until quicker cars overtook him in the stops. And then at Hungaro, he was running strongly in sixth in highly-attritional race that could have given him that first podium until his front wing failed...

**14. Brazil 2015** \- And just like in 2014, his form dropped after the unsuccessful Hungary race. The car improved and Perez was going from strength to strength, including a podium in Russia when Hulk spun off on his own. That was two races after he caused a collision with Massa in Singapore, which were unusual errors for him. Perez was better than him after the break and it's only at Interlagos when Hulk rediscovered his mojo, again having one of those stellar midfield drives in uneventful race that were quickly forgotten as the end result was only mildly impressive. But that sixth place, way ahead of Perez and beaten only by much quicker cars was an important boost. However, Perez beat him by 20 points in the standings.

**15. Monaco 2016** \- this should have been Hulk's first podium. He drove a very strong fifth early on in the wet before premature switch to inters dropped him behind several cars including his team-mate. All he could do was use his wet-weather skills to make another memorable Monaco overtake, picking off sixth from Rosberg on the line. But Perez was again on the podium and he repeated that two races later at Baku when Hulk had only himself to blame that time, spinning in Q2 that doomed his race chances. He did better in Austria, channelling Brazil 2010 spirit to qualify in the top 3 but quickly dropped back in the race.

**16. Belgium 2016** \- fourth place, this would be his best result until last weekend but it could have been even better. He used chaos at the start to emerge in second and pulled a significant gap over third and fourth places when Magnussen crashed heavily. The red flag allowed Ricciardo to get free pitstop for tyres and jump him and Hamilton (who started from the back) gained a lot too and with his much-quicker car easily denied Hulk the podium. Hulk and Perez were closely-matched throughout the season but bad luck swung that battle towards the Mexican and meant he finished 29 points ahead. But Nico was unlucky to be taken out at the start from high positions in Singapore and Austin and perhaps most painfully - suffering from a puncture when running fourth at Interlagos (still finishing seventh). His team-mate was behind and only was overtaken for third on the penultimate lap. And when Rosberg retired from F1 after the season ended, he was just recently contracted by Renault so his chances of joining the best team were basically gone.

**17. Singapore 2017** \- Hulk acclimatised well to the Renault, destroying Palmer but didn't had a chance at a headline result until Singapore. A start-line chaos allowed him to rise to third but a wrong strategy to use wets instead of inters dropped him behind Bottas. Still he was running close to Valtteri and sensing the podium, closing onto his tail when switching to slicks. At worst, 12 points were his. But a disaster struck, a car failure forcing him to retire.

**18. Abu Dhabi 2017** \- with a battle between Renault and Toro Rosso over sixth, Hulk delivered. He qualified best of the rest in seventh and comfortably finished sixth to give his team extra bucks. He cheated a bit on the first lap though, passing Perez off the track and gaining a 5s penalty but he easily pulled away the required gap. That was a time in F1 when the top 3 teams (Mercedes, Ferrari and RBR) were on another planet and the rest were driving in de facto class B. Hulk quickly emerged as a frontrunner in that category, scoring three best-of-the rest results that underlined his value - sixth in Britain, Belgium and Abu Dhabi, along with another sixth in Spain. He finished in the top 10 as well.

**19. Germany 2018** \- again, with top three teams so far in front, there was few chances to score a headline result. But when that one underdog podium happened at Baku (Perez again), Hulk repeated his 2017 crash from good position. However this was a blip. Hulk actually appeared to reach the apex of his career in the first half of 2018. As I said, big results were hard to come by. Still, 7th, 6th, 6th to start the season, overtaking compromised Vettel at the latter, another best-of-the-rest in Canada and Silverstone before peaking with 5th in changeable conditions in Germany. That set him up for career-best seventh in the end and F1.5 champion, but the second half was really messy. He screwed up at Spa and caused a big pile-up and had further incidents like in Abu Dhabi that left him ""hanging like a cow"". There were few really strong performances which wasn't perfect with Ricciardo - an elite driver back then - coming in.

**20. Italy 2019** \- this was the worst season of Hulk's career and even that fifth place at Monza, that sounded good on paper, didn't truly reflect a great performance. with Ricciardo easily passed him for fourth that day. He was outperformed by the Australian in the vast majority of races and his stock was crashing. Germany was a chance to redeem himself but bottling a podium chance only made his situation worse. Luck deserted him in the fall as well, getting embroiled in collisions through no fault of his own, including two last-lap clashes with Kvyat. Nonetheless, Abu Dhabi summarised his season when both Sainz and Ricciardo got him on the last lap, pushing him outside the points. And worse, he lost his drive in F1.

**21. Silverstone 2020** \- Hulk was picked up by Racing Point (former Force India) as reserve and his services were quickly needed when covid struck Perez. At Silverstone, in his second outing with the team, he qualified a brilliant third behind the Mercedes pair. That was unsustainable but he still finished a respectful seventh. Interestingly, Hulk was running fifth and holding a steady gap to Stroll with equal tyre mileage before being brought in for an extra stop. That was quite suspicious. He had another super-sub outing at Nurburgring in October, this time deputising for Stroll. Rushing to the circuit on Saturday and qualifying last, he drove a brilliant race to finish eighth.

**22. Australia 2023** \- After two further years out of F1, Hulk came back full time to F1 to mixed reactions. Aged 35 and lack of podium his most recognisable sign to an average fan - he wasn't a fan favourite. But he quickly proved he is still a capable driver, outperforming Magnussen and semi-regularly reaching Q3. He did at in Australia and was set for rare points in a tyre-eating car when red flag came. A chaos ahead on the restart allowed him to rise to fourth with third-placed Sainz to be penalised. However, a shock podium didn't happen as the order was set based on pre-chaos order. Still, seventh place was a great result and showed that he belonged in F1.

**23. Canada 2023** \- that qualifying session exemplified his wet and qualifying skills as he finished a shocking second fastest. Unfortuantely, a grid penalty already dropped him to fifth on the grid and he only went backwards in the race, falling outside the points. Unfortunately, Haas's race pace was usually so bad he was unable to score any points in the GP. He only added to his tally in the wet Austria sprint, when he impressively held second until half-distance before finishing sixth.

**24. Austria 2024** \- now equipped with a car that allowed him to fight in races, Hulk showed he wasn't only a good driver on Saturdays. Nico already showed that in the early part of the season, scoring minor points in the flyaways but Haas-friendly Austria allowed him to fight for more. The German drove a stunning race and won a big battle with Perez's RBR on the last lap to finish sixth. He repeated that result next time at Silverstone.

**25. Abu Dhabi 2024** \- Hulk struggled to score points after the summer break but a late-season improvement allowed him to get regular top-10 results. He scored in five of the last six rounds, the most impressive of which was arguably Abu Dhabi. Hulk put one of those mega qualifying laps that was his trademark with Haas and qualified on the second row though a penalty pushed him back. Still, he finished eighth and just narrowly missed the top 10 in the standings. Magnussen was comprehensively outperformed by him during their two years together and the reward was a seat at Sauber's soon-to-be factory Audi team.

**26. Spain 2025** \- just like with Haas in 2024, Hulk was entering a season with a car that was slowest in the previous year. And initially it stayed that way though a good job in changeable conditions in Australia allowed him to score an impressive seventh place. But an upgrade in Spain allowed Sauber to fight in the midfield and Hulk, now almost 38 and 15 years after his debut, reached arguably his F1's purple patch. Out in Q1, he drove a stunning first lap, then passed Alonso and Hadjar and stunningly relieved Hamilton of fifth late on. With incidents ahead, there was even of possibility of 5s penalties giving him that elusive podium though that didn't happen. Still, that was a stunning drive. And he followed that with strong eighth in Canada and last-to-ninth in Austria.

**27. Britain 2025** \- I thought this day would never come and certainly not after qualifying on the last row. It showed how brilliant F1 can be sometimes.","['Germany 2019 hurt to see, that one always sticks out for me as it was the home crowd.\n\nEDIT: Year', 'Perfect read, i would add maybe brasil 2016, he was on course for a podium when a puncture forced him to pit and he recovered again from the back', ""Good read; a fair and balanced summary of his journey.
