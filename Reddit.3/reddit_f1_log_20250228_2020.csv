Strong, but it’s early”",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0akm5/leclerc_we_need_to_work_on_the_balance_mclaren/,2025-02-28, News,,"[""It may be early but that won't stop everyone deciding what this all means"", 'Translation \n\n\nCharles Leclerc\'s preseason activity concluded with the morning of the third day of testing . The Monegasque, who spoke to the press in the conference held inside Ferrari hospitality, summed up the sensations he felt at the wheel of the SF-25 during the three days of testing. The unusual conditions of the three days in Sakhir complicated the collection of realistic data, although it is clear to the entire paddock that McLaren appears to be the most competitive team at the moment. From Leclerc\'s point of view, what has been seen is only a preliminary picture, since there are many issues still to be resolved in view of Melbourne.\n\n\nLeclerc: “We struggled a bit with the balance, but we see the numbers we expected”\n\nOne of the aspects that makes it difficult to draw up analyses by the protagonists themselves is linked to the anomalous conditions that occurred in Bahrain , between temperatures and grip levels. “Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a Bahrain like this before,” commented Charles Leclerc in the press conference organised by Ferrari. “It was very cold, there was also rain, the temperatures are not what we are used to, so the reference compared to other years is very difficult. Usually we have much warmer conditions.” On the work with the SF-25 he then added: “we see all the numbers we expected . Today we struggled a bit more with the balance , even yesterday afternoon it was a bit more difficult to manage, so there is still a bit of work to do.”\n\nFinding the right balance was, from Leclerc\'s point of view, the theme on which the work in the Maranello garage focused. Only in Australia will it be possible to draw concrete conclusions. ""I would prefer to wait before making any predictions,"" Leclerc underlined. ""For now we are working hard to try to improve this balance , which we have struggled a bit to put in the right place in the last two days. After that we will only see in Melbourne when we will have everything in the best conditions to try to extract the best from the car, but basically we struggled a bit more in the balance, and that is where we are concentrating now.""\n\n\nOn McLaren\'s level: ""We use their performance to understand what we lack""\n\nThe Ferrari driver also maintained a moderate line in terms of comparison with McLaren , which at the moment seems to be the benchmark of the group. “McLaren seems like a very strong car for now,” said Leclerc . “But it’s very early to talk , so we have to focus on ourselves and not get caught up in the top ranks. There are still a lot of question marks, but we’ve learned a lot during these first tests and that will certainly help us hit the right window for the first race.” The very solid race simulations put on the track by the Woking team have certainly captured the attention of protagonists and insiders, but Leclerc didn’t say he was too scared, explaining how they could instead be useful for obtaining a yardstick. “Maybe it’s a first idea of what we can expect, but there are still a lot of unknowns, so we have to take these times with a pinch of salt. However, they have been very important for us to understand what we are missing compared to them . There is still a lot of work to do to prepare for Melbourne and that is what we are trying to do, also together with Lewis.”', 'Basically my conclusion after testing, McLaren look solid and the SF will need to refine its balance but beyond that I’m not concerned. Calling doom and gloom or WDC verdicts at this point is folly.', 'Even if McLaren is faster from the get go, Ferrari changed the concept with belief that the ceiling would be higher.\n\nRecall how Mclaren became champions even after Max won 7 in the start, the season is long, and if Ferrari can develop well then all is not lost..', ""Minor meaningless thought, but I've observed generally that over the last say five years whether it's testing or practice sessions McLaren are never *worse* than they look.

Piastri was missing apexes probably more often than what\'s habitual for pre-season testing. My biggest question mark is whether or not they have improved their aero efficiency on the straights, last season they were very often the worse of the Big 4 in the speed traps. Most people have them as pre-season favorites right now\n\n-Ferrari: Hamilton is happy with the feeling of the car and said he hasn\'t had this feeling in pre-season in 4 years. He hasn\'t clocked in a lot of laps though, which isn\'t ideal in his situation. Leclerc acknowledged that McLaren looked really strong but expects Ferrari to be thereabouts. The car looked more unstable today than the previous two days. Couple days ago it was revealed that Ferrari focused on **providing a strong front end to match Leclerc\'s driving style**, lengthened the wheelbase (pushing the front wheels further away from the sidepods inlets) and slightly moved the seat back.\n\n-Mercedes: as is usual for them in pre-season tests, they have a **lot of mileage** and virtually **no reliability issues**. Russell said the car felt **more compliant** than its predecessor but because of the cold weather in Bahrain, they\'re unable to tell if the W16 has inherited the W15\'s behavior in cooler temperatures. Merc are happy with Antonelli and Gwen Lagrue (Head of Young Driver Program) said that he is probably the best prepared of the 2025 rookies, having done **12 days of testing or a little more than 10,000km** in TPC (approx. 31-32 races worth of distance). Also said Russell is very well positioned to help him learn about F1 and fit in the team as he too was a Mercedes junior. Kimi is expected to be roughly 0.3s off George in race trim.\n\n-Haas: **best long runs of the midfield** and **very stable rear end**. Very high mileage today, Ocon alone did 100 laps, almost all focused on race sims.\xa0\n\n-Williams: **strong one lap pace** but as it stands a **lot of tyre degradation**\xa0 Very high mileage as well across 3 days for both drivers.\xa0\n\n-VCarb: Hadjar said the car felt **better in mid and high speed corners** than last year but he was struggling at times as it was **very stiff at low speed**. He also said they had to **improve traction and going over curbs**.\n\n-Alpine: Gasly said it was a **night and day difference** compared to last year, the car **responded well to setup changes** and felt like it did at the end of last season. He thinks they have a sound platform to build on.\xa0\n\n-Aston: a couple of **reliability issues** that cost them some valuable running time. Haven\'t heard anything specific regarding car behavior. Alonso was allegedly satisfied after the first two days.\n\n-Sauber: didn\'t hear anything about their car performance. According to a post made here on Day 1, they have implemented a new system for their pit stops, a light on the wheel that turns green when it\'s properly attached or something similar.']",28,85,0.77,28,82,82,7,1,0.040000000000000036,7

Both him and Mekies said that they\'re not leading the mid pack just yet, but that they\'re right up there.\n\n  \nI know the bottom 6 teams get less focus and coverage than the top 4 teams, but F1 outlets paint a way to simple picture in such instances.', 'the biggest doubt i have is the Mercedes, considering Bahrain this time around was a lot cooler and these are the temp where the Merc was shining last year\n\nwhat happens once we go to a place where the weather is hot and sunny? do they slump back to the 4th fastest car?', ""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGoIgMdtc6a/?igsh=MTZ6Z2szeGN3c3kzdQ==\n\nHaving been around for McLaren through some *very shit* preseasons, I'm...fine with this.\n\nI mind even 10+ years ago, Hamilton observed entirely accurately that McLaren are historically shit at starting seasons.
