1hxssxl,"Jack Doohan’s experience at Abu Dhabi, and why Alpine are concerned ",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hxssxl/jack_doohans_experience_at_abu_dhabi_and_why/,2025-01-10, Statistics,"There’s a lot of talk about the expectations being piled on Jack Doohan by Alpine, and whether they’re justified or not. But after another comment made me look up some numbers, I decided to look into Jack’s testing at Abu Dhabi alone, and why the result he had at Abu Dhabi may have been the nail in the coffin.

In Abu Dhabi, Jack finished second last. Kevin Magnussen was the only person who finished behind him, but remember that Kevin pitted for fastest lap. Jack was last when compared to people on the same strategy throughout the entirety of the race. Flavio Briatore seemed less than enthused with this in his post Abu Dhabi video.

You can put this down to rookies being rookies, but it should be noticed that Jack has extensive testing in Abu Dhabi prior to this race. He has done the young driver tests in 2022 and 2023 for Alpine, and also has done FP1 at Abu Dhabi in 2022 and 2023. Based on the official timing…

2022 FP1 - 25 laps completed
2022 YDT - 111 laps completed
2023 FP1 - 23 laps completed
2023 YDT - 107 laps completed.

In total, this is 266 laps done by Jack in an Alpine F1 car at Abu Dhabi alone. Abu Dhabi is 5.3km long, so this totals to **over 1400km of experience at this track alone.** That’s 17.5% of the entire testing Lewis Hamilton did before his McLaren debut which is often touted as extensive - and he’s done that at one singular track.

Was Alpine really asking too much for him to do an better job at a track he has this much experience on? Particularly when he has experience with the A424 through FP1 sessions and testing days. Add in the extensive TPC program - this year he’s had Paul Ricard, Qatar for 2 days, Zandvoort for 2 days, and is it a shock that Alpine current have doubts?","['I don’t think people are mad about his performance: we still don’t know how he will perform, there’s no WDC hopes, he is not super highly ranked.\n\nWhat people find a bit odd is that all of this was known to Alpine. Hiring him and then immediately trying to fire him is just another example of that teams amazing leadership…\n\nAs for Doohan true performance, we will see. Rookies are even more rookies than in older times so they deserve a bit of time to adjust.', 'He also did extensive TPC in Abu Dhabi in 2024 before the race. That’s one of the locations Alpine uses along with Qatar. Which means it was the best race for him to debut. He even won Abu Dhabi in F2. Still, it’s just one race. Everything can go wrong in one race. Colapinto in Brazil is an example.', 'I chalk it up to him being conservative and not wanting to bin it on debut, which would have been worse case possible. I don’t think he’s a top talent, but let’s wait and give him a proper run in testing and at Bahrain. If he’s still proper shit well we get Colapinto back early', 'Big difference between testing/practice and an actual race. It was his first race at any level in 378 days - compare that to Colapinto who had 28 races in that same period', ""Wasn't he using Ocon's shit box of a car with half the upgrades that Gasly had?"", ""I firmly believe that there was something fucky going on with Ocon's car ( Which Doohan also drove).\n\nOcon went from being the faster Alpine driver to nearly 1sec off territory after he announced his Haas deal.\n\n Gasly is good but he's shouldn't be 1sec faster than Ocon on merit.\n\nThis Franco to Alpine talk has been going on behind the scene by the time AD rolled around. Alpine doesn't want Doohan to succeed. Franco is a decent driver too and he brings in a shed load of money and exposure to the team."", ""Feels like another Sargeant deal -- promote from within the academy to show that you can actually get an Alpine seat from within the academy, proving its worth, until a better replacement comes along. Except this time, the better option isn't from their academy it's ironically from Williams', being the same driver who replaced Sargeant."", 'Is it a big surprise that alpine is already toxic towards their new driver? \n\nThe most toxic team. Honestly at this point I think Renault should just get out of f1', '[“Theres no expectation”](https://youtu.be/c4uPjl9OXQc?si=oSJG0dL1C8sT3Tlh) All he had to do was finish the race and he did. Alpine should be concerned about their car not the rookie with one race under his belt. Well see what happens after round 1.']",2223,239,0.93,2223,8503,8503,50,2,0.0,50
