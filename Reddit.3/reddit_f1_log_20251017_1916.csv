And the mod, the single mod is always posting referral links (which he gets money for) to P1 Travel. The issue is the prices P1 Travel askes.  Lets take Suzuka which is on sale now:

B1 stand, officially 63,000yen turns into 132,000yen on P1... More than double. Then looking at the C stand + hotel package. It comes to 852.90¬†Euro going by the Japanese prices for everything you get, but the price is **‚Ç¨2,084** on P1 Travel**.**  More than a 2x price increase certainly seems excessive and into scalper territory for me. 

The biggest issue I have with this is sometimes I see people recommending to buy tickets from that site over official sales sites.  Pay double.. why? 

Before paying anything to any site, check official pricing first and ask yourself if you want to pay such a markup. And on seeing links anywhere on social media, check if they are paid links and then ask if the info you are getting is unbiased. ","['Thanks for bringing up this issue. We (r/formula1) used to redirect ticket and travel related questions to r/GrandPrixTravel. This was added after the mod of GrandPrixTravel suggested this in 2021 via ModMail\n\nIn February of 2025 we noticed that GrandPrixTravel has been **seemingly** monetized. They were stating that P1 Travel is a ""*community verified ticket vendor*"" of GrandPrixTravel and their subreddit was full of what appeared to be affiliate links for P1 Travel.^(The links were via the domain of an affiliate marketing platform and P1 Travel offers an affiliate program.) We found these links in the following places on /r/GrandPrixTravel:\n\n* In the sidebar\n* At the top of their wiki page for official circuit websites\n* At the top of their monthly buy/sell threads\n* In standalone mod-made posts\n* In AutoModerator comments triggered by certain keywords\n\nSome of these links were paired with messages pointing out that some other ticket websites are not fully reliable. In addition we also noticed heavy promotion of FanAmp, an app.\n\nWhen we became aware of all of this in February **we stopped the r/formula1 AutoModerator from redirecting users with ticket & travel related questions to r/GrandPrixTravel and removed links to that subreddit from our sidebar.**\n\nWhile GrandPrixTravel can be a useful resource we considered that it would not be appropriate to continue recommending it given these issues, especially since [Reddit\'s Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct) clearly prohibits *""moderation actions (including actions taken using mod tools, bots, and other services) in exchange for any form of compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from or on behalf of third parties""*', 'I made it to my personal mission to downvote that stupid mod every time I see it and the ‚Äúhi here is X from P1travel‚Äù comments (this seemed to have stopped showing up)\n\nI will always recommend that people buy from the race tracks and only from the race tracks maybe F1 if they are desperate but the resellers are a no go imo‚Ä¶', 'Yeah I got my monza tickets there and felt they were not very up front with what the hospitality inclusion really was.', ""The question is, why hasn't somebody reported the subreddit for violating [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct), if this behavior has been occurring for awhile now.
