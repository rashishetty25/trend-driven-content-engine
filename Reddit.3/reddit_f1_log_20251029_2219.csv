With Interlagos on the calendar this weekend, I’ve been feeling a bit nostalgic. I went back through the history of Formula One season finales since 1990, and it reminded me how much the end of the year used to feel different.

1985 - 1995: Australia (Adelaide) closed the season

1996 - 1999: Japan (Suzuka or Jerez in ’97)

2000 - 2005: Mostly Japan or Malaysia/China

2004 - 2008: Brazil’s Interlagos - the golden run of finales

2009 - 2025: Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina Circuit has taken over ever since


For me, Interlagos just has something no other circuit can replicate. The atmosphere is electric, the weather unpredictable, and the fans make it feel like the whole sport’s heartbeat is right there in São Paulo. Those finales gave us so many iconic moments - Raikkonen’s 2007 title shock, Hamilton’s 2008 “Is that Glock?!” drama, Vettel’s 2012 charge through the field.

Abu Dhabi has its glamour, but Interlagos always delivered chaos, emotion and pure racing theatre. I sometimes wonder if my fondness for it is just nostalgia - because so many emotional memories are tied to it being the last race - or if it’s genuinely the perfect place to end a season. It's just such a great track in any case.  

What do you all think?
Do any of you miss Interlagos as the finale, or has Abu Dhabi earned its place?","['Absolutely: Interlagos is a great track with tremendous atmosphere, Yas Marina is a terrible circuit with no atmosphere. It reflects so badly on F1.', ""2016 would have been a lot more interesting with Hamilton slowing down in sector 3 and Rosberg having to pray Vettel of Verstappen didn't try any unconvential overtaking spots.\n\nInterlagos was the perfect ending and instead they replaced it with a track that perfectly represents the FIA."", 'I am biased but I would rather have the gran finale in a tradicional circuit rather than those petro ones.

It was a disastrous day for Williams as both drivers, David Coulthard and Damon Hill, spun out. Hill’s race went from bad to worse when he slid into the gravel while attempting to return to the pits to serve a stop-go penalty for speeding. Just recently, Hill had signed a £5 million contract with Williams for 1996, but rumours were already surfacing that Frank Williams was reconsidering. Reflecting on his season, Hill admitted, “I’ve never felt this bad. I’ve made mistakes this season, I can’t deny that. Just when you think it can’t get worse, it does.The McLaren of Mika Hakkinen came home in second, with Schumacher’s teammate, Johnny Herbert, finishing in third.

Lewis's record against Leclerc existed below Vettel's achievement against Leclerc in 2020.

His interviews are negative and resigned after every race. The SF25 has taken a step backward from the SF24, but it's still not as disastrous as the SF1000 had been when Vettel had been forced to spend his final season at Ferrari in 2020.
