1mpt6qf,What an Oscar Piastri WDC would mean for Australian Motorsport.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mpt6qf/what_an_oscar_piastri_wdc_would_mean_for/,2025-08-14, Discussion,"If Oscar Piastri maintains a lead over Lando Norris to secure the 2025 Formula One Driver's Championship:

* He becomes the first Australian since Alan Jones in 1980 (45 years of F1's 75) to win the WDC
* He becomes one of just 3 Australians to do it, alongside Jones and Jack Brabham
* He wins only Australia's fifth ever WDC
* He defies his manager's Mark Webber's ""almost seasons"" at Red Bull
* He achieves it as an Australian surrounded by a British team

While everyone wants to see a fair battle between Lando and Oscar this season, with the best driver getting the win, the signs seem to point to Oscar's potential championship being the more historically significant of the two, since we know Britain has a long, proud but highly decorated F1 history.

Even if he doesn't he is still the first Australian to:

* Lead an F1 Driver's Championship since Mark Webber in 2010
* Secure more than 10 podiums in one season (and counting)
* Secure more than 4 consecutive podiums (his 8 in 2025 matches Senna in equal P2 for Mclaren)
* Win more than 5 races within a single season

Post-race, I tried email – always got “undeliverable” after 24h. On WhatsApp, they instantly refused any refund, no apology.

My picks would be Max (no brainer) and Oscar. Max is a generational talent and one of the greatest drivers of all time. He is already at his peak level IMO and has practically no driving weaknesses except the occasional red mist which sometimes (although less than pre 2021) ends in crashes or large penalties. But other than that, perfect F1 driver. He looks like he may be able to carry on performing at this peak for maybe another 3-4 years and thereafter start performing below prime (although still good).

Oscar has shown what he’s capable of when given a good car, and within just 2.5 years levelling up to good drivers who have twice or more his experience. I’m not yet sure if he’s a generational talent like Max, Lewis, Seb, Nando etc but he is not likely to have reached his peak yet (hardly any driver peaks at 3rd year) and therefore, in all likelihood, will be even better in the coming years. Max and him are also on two different career timelines (Max on his 11th year vs Oscar on his 3rd), which means that as Max starts to move post prime, Oscar will be approaching prime and this makes him a perfect follow up to Max. No wonder Horner had been mentioning since last year that he would want Oscar in RB. 

I did not pick Charles, George and Lando mostly because their career timelines are a bit near to Max’s and (I could be wrong but I doubt it), none of the three have shown that they can reach Max’s level of 2021 and 2022 (this would be when Max was in his 7th and 8th year, so similar experience to Lando, George and Charles right now). Those three are probably very near or at their peak and so as Max begins to perform post prime, so will they - therefore, both the drivers in the team would start performing a bit worse and opening the door for other teams with drivers that are entering their prime to beat them","['Max Charles 100%', 'Max and Charles', 'The consideration I would make is how important it is, for the driver, that the car is predictable. As an example, George is great at wrestling shitboxes, while Lewis isn’t, but if the car is a stable platform, I still think Lewis the race pace edge, even now, and this is not a dig at George who is himself extremely quick on a stable car.\n\nConsidering the new regs and the possibility of a period of struggling with setups and cars behaving in an unpredictable way, I think the drivers that can deal better with this uncertainty would have the edge.\n\nTLDR: Best duo considering that scenario would be, for me, MAX and George.
