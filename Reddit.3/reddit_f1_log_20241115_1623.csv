1gruymp,Large electric battery necessary for 2026 F1 engine: Otherwise we would only have 2 manufacturers,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gruymp/large_electric_battery_necessary_for_2026_f1/,2024-11-15, News,"The share of the electric motor will grow to 50 percent in 2026. Without that, many manufacturers would have left F1. FIA Technical Director Nikolas Tombazis explains.

We had to work a lot on the regulations. Especially with regard to energy management, to ensure that the cars also behave like real racing cars and have no undesirable characteristics. ""We are very happy. I think we have done well,"" Tombazis reports.

""A motor without an electric component, for example V8 motors powered by e-fuels, was not an issue. ""We have to be able to do that. If we hadn't put the engine program together as it is now, we would probably have only had two engine manufacturers,"" says Tombazis.
For the premier class, this would hardly have been sustainable. ""We therefore think that it was necessary to install a large electrical component in the drive in order to also send a message in the interest of the environment.""","['“without that, many manufacturers would have left F1”\n\n\nRenault: this does not apply to us.', 'I still find it a bit disappointing that we don’t have front axle regen.
