1i1ej6z,Pierre Gasly is now the 5th oldest driver on the grid,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i1ej6z/pierre_gasly_is_now_the_5th_oldest_driver_on_the/,2025-01-14, Statistics,"F1’s most recent post on instagram made me realise that surprisingly, Pierre Gasly is now one of the oldest drivers on the grid. It really seems like yesterday when he stepped into the Red Bull after one season, so inexperienced, but now he’s done a hundred and so races.

Also notably, Carlos Sainz is the 4th oldest, Alex Albon the 6th oldest (by a month) and Esteban Ocon the 7th oldest.","['Yeah, it’s really interesting to see how much younger the grid is skewing.

It’s strange seeing the ‘younger’ drivers start to reach the verge of becoming the eldest. I know Alonso and Hamilton only have a handful of seasons left in them at that, and I reckon Nico is also tending that way too, so it won’t be too long now before Carlos (assuming he is still here) will be “the old guy”. And he’d only probably by 33-34ish or so at most when that happens too. So wild.', ""By dropping Perez, Magnussen, Bottas, and Riccardo, we've pretty much lost anyone over 30 with the exception of Alonso, Hamilton and Hulkenberg, each of whom won't have that many years left, and then Sainz, whose only recently crossed the threshold into his 30s.

1i1j3ll,Oscar Piastri is closer to Lando Norris than people are insinuating. Especially in a tight field.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i1j3ll/oscar_piastri_is_closer_to_lando_norris_than/,2025-01-14, Discussion,"I do admit that there have been times were Oscar Piastri has been overhyped, especially last year and I still believe Lando Norris has a genuine margin over him at the moment. However despite a poor run of form in the final races of the season, somewhat leaving a poor impression moving on to the next one, I would like to bring to attention two things. 

One of which is the actual pace gap between them in qualifying. Despite the picture told by the qualifying head to head which is something like 19-4 or so. The average gap is most often less than 2 tenths and they tend to start very close to eachother on the grid. A similar situation to Carlos Sainz who despite being outqualified every year next to Leclerc, is always just 1 or 2 cars behind on the starting grid. Gaps such as these can fluctuate between two drivers in a given year depending on their adaptability to car characteristics, especially a gap of just 2 tenths. See Ricciardo and Verstappen, separated probably by 2 tenths on average but by no means was it a one sided battle, with both taking wins and each having periods of finishing ahead of the other.

My second point is the more important one. It's how many races Piastri came close to winning or seemed that he was going to win. Everyone remembers the races lost by Norris, mostly because of his poor starts. However, Piastri has several races he came close to winning and most were lost due to team mistakes or unfortunate events. 

1. Miami: In the first few laps, Piastri appeared to have more pace than Norris and was on a charge. However he got affected by the safety car that gave Norris the win. He was ahead of Norris before it came out and had he pitted a lap later, he'd have been ahead of Norris and up till then had shown more pace

2. The stretch of races from Great Britain, Hungary (which he won), Belgium, Italy, Azerbaijan (which he also won) He was in contention for the win in all of these races, and Norris was not. Britain could have easily gone his way had he not been screwed over by Mclaren not wanting to double stack, while he was closing in on Norris. Belgium he almost won but Mclaren opted for a two stop, Norris lost positions off the start. Italy again, Mclaren opted for a two stop when a 1 stop would have been possible had they told both drivers to manage their gap.

I think it is true that Piastris best run of form coincided with Norris' worst. However, had things gone slightly different he could have been looking at 5 wins in 6 races. I think next year will be closer than people think, especially if the field is tight which is when Norris' weaknesses are highlighted and Piastris strengths are shown. But if the Mclarens are clearly the fastest car then I think Norris will have the bigger margin because racecraft and cool headed ness will count for less. ","[""While he has got better, Piastri still isn't as good at managing long stints as Norris. No doubt he is a great driver, and in other less tyre-sensitive regimes he would have been higher up the field.\n\nBut quick over five laps isn't the race."", ""These analysis lose their impact when you fail to accurately point where Piastri needs to improve. You're just talking about his highs, and while they are high, it's his lows you should focus on. If the field is very tight then him being 20-4 in qualy is not a good sign, it literally means that he is pretty much always on the back foot. Another point are the moments where McLaren was the dominant car of the weekend, Piastri struggled to fully maximize the results. There's no reason for Netherlands and Singapore not to be a McLaren 1-2, seeing the pace of Norris. \n\nI agree that the narrative changes too quick and too much at times, but that doesn't mean the narrative is 100% wrong. Piastri needs to improve a lot for his 3rd year and imho he didn't really improve as much as I thought he would from season 1 to season 2. To me that's worrying, but we shall see what happens next season."", 'He was not as close to Norris as Sainz was to Leclerc in 2024. \n\nA closer comparison would be Hamilton vs Bottas from 2017-2020.', ""I suggest you rewatch Miami again. Norris found himself behind Piastri because of Perez's chaotic start, but as soon as he had clean air in the first stint he was catching up big time on Sainz and Piastri."", 'Norris had him comfortably beaten in qualifying delta and race pace, moreso than the season before I believe.\n\nOscar is great, I watched his f2 season, but he will need quite a big jump to match Norris across this season.', "">Miami: In the first few laps, Piastri appeared to have more pace than Norris and was on a charge. However he got affected by the safety car that gave Norris the win. He was ahead of Norris before it came out and had he pitted a lap later, he'd have been ahead of Norris and up till then had shown more pace\n\nWasn't Norris behind Perez when Piastri was upfront and pushing to try and get Verstappen? Because iirc, the pace from Norris greatly increased once Norris got away from Perez (since Perez pit) and Norris was lapping much quicker than those in the front. Everyone but Norris was impacted by the safety car in Miami, which is why Norris says that his Miami win was lucky.\n\n>The stretch of races from Great Britain, Hungary (which he won), Belgium, Italy, Azerbaijan (which he also won) He was in contention for the win in all of these races, and Norris was not.\n\nThe two races in which Norris was not in contention for the win (you can argue Monza if you want but both were in contention for the win there IMO) was Belgium (Norris makes mistakes at the start) and Azerbaijan (Double yellow flag during qualifying means that Norris didnt make it out of Q3 -- Note: Norris charged back through the field and ended P4 after the incident between Sainz and Perez, Norris also held up Perez to help Piastri win here, that's how close he was to the front runners).\n\n>Britain could have easily gone his way had he not been screwed over by Mclaren not wanting to double stack, while he was closing in on Norris.\n\nAnd with another hypothetical scenario Norris could have won, or Verstappen.\n\nThe qualifying head-to-head is 20-4 in favor of Norris and it is important to note that the actual time gap isnt that big between them. However, the other arguments do not lend any favors for Piastri. In the European/summer session, Piastri and Norris were pretty even on points (despite Norris having 0 points at Austria). Both are good drivers. Life happens during the race and that means that drivers sometimes get horrible strategy calls by the team (both Norris and Piastri have experienced this). I hope that Piastri is a lot closer to Norris this season, however, we wont know until the season comes."", ""At the moment I think Norris is simply the better driver.\n\n\nHot take, but as long as Norris stays at McLaren, Piastri will be the 2nd driver.\n\n\nPiastri is good, don't get me wrong, Norris simply has more pace"", ""You forgot Zandvoort in the stretch of races between Silverstone and Baku... I wonder why.\n\nAlso I don't think it makes much sense to literally ignore 3 quarters of the season."", 'I love the little trends that reddit has\n\nPiastri is said to be better than Norris > Piastri is overrated > Piastri is not a good driver > Piastri is actually pretty good']",485,275,0.74,485,3205,3205,22,7,0.0,22

I believe the 2025 season might be epic for various reasons, of course the main one being the possibility of having 4 teams (McLaren, Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes) fighting for poles and wins every single weekend.

Another thing that hypes me a lot for this year is the driver pairings. 6 drivers will begin a F1 season for the first time ! As a result we have 8 new duos, only McLaren and Aston Martin kept both of their drivers from 2024.

I would like you to rank each pairing from most to least exciting in terms of performance dynamics : How exicted are you to find out which driver gets the upper hand ? How excited are you to find out about the gap between two teammates ?

Here is how I would rank the teams based on how much I'm looking forward to their teammate battle :

1 FERRARI -> Charles Leclerc vs Lewis Hamilton

2 WILLIAMS -> Carlos Sainz vs Alex Albon

3 MCLAREN -> Lando Norris vs Oscar Piastri

4 MERCEDES -> George Russell vs Kimi Antonelli

5 HAAS -> Esteban Ocon vs Oliver Bearman

6 RACING BULLS -> Yuki Tsunoda vs Isack Hadjar

7 RED BULL -> Max Verstappen vs Liam Lawson

8 SAUBER -> Nico Hulkenberg vs Gabriel Bortoleto

9 ALPINE -> Pierre Gasly vs Jack Doohan

10 ASTON MARTIN -> Fernando Alonso vs Lance Stroll","[""1. Leclerc-Hamilton - no explanation needed\n2. Albon-Sainz - a potential make or break battle for either driver's career\n3. Ocon-Bearman - a good battle of an experienced midfield driver and a highly rated rookie\n4. Hulkenberg-Bortoleto - a good battle of a veteran and a highly rated rookie\n5. Norris-Piastri - an overrated battle, Norris should win comfortably again\n6. Tsunoda-Hadjar - one Yuki should win but with some intrigue with Hadjar an unknown quantity\n7. Russell-Antonelli - likely to be a walkover with Antonelli too raw for a potentially race-winning seat, but a small chance it may turn out differently\n8. Verstappen-Lawson - won't be a contest\n9. Gasly-Doohan - won't be a contest\n10. Alonso-Stroll - no point even turning up for this one"", 'I would swap 4 and 6 as I believe that two hotheads paired against each other is far more fun than the landslide of a victory George Russell will enjoy over Antonelli.', '1. Ferrari\n\n2. Mercedes\n\n3. Haas\n\n4. Sauber\n\n5. Williams\n\n6. McLaren\n\n7. VCARB\n\n8. Alpine\n\n9. Aston Martin \n\n10. Red Bull', 'Ferrari most exciting obviously. Williams too.\n\nI’d rank McLaren lower than you have, I think it’ll be a bigger gap than this year. Racing Bulls a bit higher because it’ll be interesting to see how Hadjar fares.\n\nI’m going for Red Bull and Alpine as not exciting unless there’s a teammate swap - the replacements are also probably unexciting, but at least interesting.\n\nAgree Aston last. We know Alonso is better, and Stroll’s not getting swapped.', ""1: Ferrari\n\n2: Mercedes\n\n3: McLaren\n\n4: Williams\n\n5: Red Bull\n\n6: Sauber\n\n7: Haas\n\n8: Toro Rosso\n\n9: Renault\n\n10: Aston Martin\n\nI've rated Merc high because of the dynamic of George against a talented very young rookie, while also in a what should be race winning car.\n\nToro Rosso is on the lower side because I'm not that impressed with Hadjar (so far), and he most likely will be not going to the main team anyway. I'd suspect that the next young driver that will, is Lindblad. Therefore I'm not really that excited given the stakes are lower.\n\nSauber is a bit higher given unlike with Bearman, Bortoleto hasn't driven in F1 yet. So it will be interesting to see whether he will be right up there and challenge Hulk or not. He seemed like a very complete driver in F2, therefore I think he can surprise quite some people in his rookie year."", 'Ocon and Bearman should be higher imo, I actually think it’s one of the most underrated driver parings for next season as Ocon is a very capable midfield driver and Bearman looked probably the most exciting out of all the rookies last season \n\nI think Ocon will comfortable beat him but Bearman’s progress over the season will certainly be interesting to see.', ""I'd put red bull and mercedes above mclaren. Other than that same list"", 'Good list OP. I think I would just switch Red Bull and Racing Bulls, since I expect it to get spicy with Lawson in the seat.\n\nYuki and Hadjar will probably also get spicy to be fair, but it is a little more interesting when it is happening with a world champion closer to the front.', 'Ferrari for obvious reasons. Does the goat still have it? Can a new team and new car reignite him?\n\nWilliams - have the drivers or the car been holding them back more?
