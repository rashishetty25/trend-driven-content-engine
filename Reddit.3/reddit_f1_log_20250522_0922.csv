1krua3i,Two mandatory pitstop rule nuances,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1krua3i/two_mandatory_pitstop_rule_nuances/,2025-05-21, Discussion,"I'm wondering about the nuances and loopholes of the ""two pitstops"" rule for the Monaco GP. 

What I know is that teams are required to use 3 tyre sets during the GP, not two pitstops, but the effect is the same.

What if a driver heads to the pits, changes its tyres and at the end of the very next lap they do so again. Would that constitute as 3 tyre sets used? They would never have crossed the start-finish line on track in this case. 

What if a team changes tyres twice during the same pitstop? After the first tyre change the driver moves 1cm and then they do the next change. 

What are other loopholes that may be exploited and are they closed by the regulations?","['I imagine if there were to be a safety car for multiple laps cars would pit once complete the lap and then pit immediately again whilst the safety car is still out.\n\nIt’s going to look ridiculous when this happens and Charles Leclerc somehow gets shafted again by it.', 'tyres are considered used once the driver leaves the pit lane\n\n>30.5 c) Tyres fitted in the pit lane will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane with these tyres fitted. Tyres fitted on the grid will be deemed to have been used when the car leaves its grid position under its own power with these tyres fitted.\n\nthe rule only requires 3 sets to be ""used during the race"". stops on consecutive laps are possible, and that sometimes happens', ""Doing a single lap would be fine by the rules, but I'm unsure what benefit there would be as track position is key at Monaco.  I suppose you could arguably be able to put yourself in clear air if the timing is right and then slot back into the rest of the field later, but there's many things that can happen.\n\nPotentially, taking two early stops and then hoping for an SC could be beneficial."", '>What are other loopholes that may be exploited and are they closed by the regulations?\n\nIf you have your drivers next to each other, the 2nd one can easily lap 5-10 seconds slower, giving free pit stops to the one in front.

Will mess up track position though.', ""Think that something to consider is that despite the new rule, the teams do not get more tires from Pirelli whilst having to use an extra set.\n\nBut you could pit twice early on in the race if you're in the back, be in clean air to close to gap to the cars in front and gain places when they pit, you might leave yourself without new tires if an opportunity arises with an SC or VSC though, that's what happened with Piastri, although in Monaco that might not be as bad."", ""I'm very interested to see what happens if we get an early safety car.
