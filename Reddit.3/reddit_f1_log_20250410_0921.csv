Hope he does well.', 'I love how this massive project and ambition is another way for Max to relax. Dude just lives and breathes racing', 'Translation:\n\nAfter being launched in 2022 as an umbrella for the rally adventure of Jos Verstappen, the GT career of Thierry Vermeulen and the sim race activities of Team Redline, the next step will be taken in 2025 with Verstappen.com Racing by participating in the GT World Challenge Europe (GTWCE) through the support of existing teams. Chris Lulham, who comes from the sim race, will participate in the GTCE Endurance Cup with GTCE drivers Harry King and Thierry Vermeulen in an Aston Martin Vantage AMR GT3 EVO. Next weekend they have their first appointment at Paul Ricard in southern France, where a 6-hour race is scheduled.\n\nOne of Verstappen\'s ambitions is to help talented sim drivers make the step to the real circuit. He wants to prove that sim racing can be a great substitute for a career through karting, which not everyone has the money for. The 22-year-old Lulham is the first sim racer chosen by Verstappen for this. ""Chris has a long track record at Team Redline, Max\'s sim race team,"" Raymond Vermeulen told Motorsport.com. ""Max has a high hat on him, because he always comes with good feedback when adjusting the virtual car. Last year, he once invited Chris for a private test. He got in and had a good speed from the first lap, even though the conditions on the track were very difficult at that time. This made it clear to us that he has a lot of talent and can handle the transition from the sim to the real GT3s. Then we started testing with him more often.”\n\nThe 24-year-old King has walked a more traditional path. He started in karting before climbing the Ginetta ladder in England. After becoming champion in the Ginetta GT4 Supercup in 2019, titles in the British Porsche Carrera Cup and the Porsche Carrera Cup Benelux followed. Last year he finished second in both the Porsche Supercup and the extremely competitive German Porsche Carrera Cup. ""A fast, experienced boy, a real racer"", describes Vermeulen the Brit. ""After he happened to be available last year due to circumstances, we quickly recorded him for this year."" Vermeulen\'s son Thierry, who has been on the road in motorsport since 2020 and has been part of Verstappen.com Racing since the first hour, completes the driver cast.\n\nVerstappen.com Racing is working with an existing team for the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe: 2 Seas Motorsport. ""The relationship with 2 Seas Motorsport has been there for a long time"", Vermeulen explains. ""Nick Cristofaro, who after racing himself has set up his own race team with the Bahraini Isa Al Khalifa, is a good friend of Max."" Since the beginning of 2024, Verstappen has owned an Aston Martin Vantage, which he occasionally takes on the circuit. For these moments, he already called on the team from Silverstone for practical support. Vermeulen: ""It was therefore logical for us to also take this step with them to the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe.""\n\n**Despite his busy Formula 1 career, Verstappen is very closely involved in the GT3 project.** For example, he assists the drivers with advice and action during private tests and SIM sessions, but he also interferes with the livery, he has helped find a good basic adjustment for the car and gives his input to the engineers in preparation for the race weekend. ""Of course, he himself made enough meters with that car to be able to make a good contribution to the baseline set-up"", says Vermeulen. **""He also helped develop the sim models of the Aston Martin, so to convert what they tested on the circuit to the sim.""**\n\n**Ambitious goals**\n\nRegarding the goals for the first year of Verstappen.com Racing as a participant in the GT World Challenge Europe, Vermeulen says: ""We are ambitious. We don\'t participate to fill the field, we participate for the marbles. We want to drive at the front regularly."" Vermeulen acknowledges that this will not be an easy task in the extremely competitive GT World Challenge. ""There are big teams with a lot of experience. It will be powered. But we do expect to regularly fight at the front in our class.""\n\nLulham is also participating in the Sprint Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe this year. Together with Thierry Vermeulen, who is starting his third full season in the Sprint Cup, he will drive a Ferrari 296 GT3 from Emil Frey Racing. ""We expect to get podium places,"" said Vermeulen. According to Verstappen\'s agent, the fact that Lulham and Vermeulen are driving two different cars this year is \'only good\'. ""The Ferrari is of course a very different car than the Aston Martin, but that only benefits the development of the driving skills,"" he says. ""They have now tested enough with both cars, so we don\'t expect any problems if they switch from one car to another.""', 'I did enjoy the Redbull sim to real life mini series. https://youtu.be/Kdcjo7Ypdtw\n\nAlso I believe iRacing holds a competition for sim racers to drive real life F4 cars and receive lessons.

1jv1c8l,What is the Japanese fandom of Yuki Tsunoda like?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jv1c8l/what_is_the_japanese_fandom_of_yuki_tsunoda_like/,2025-04-09, Discussion,"Formula 1 largely operates in English, so I mostly have only encountered English language fandom of Tsunoda.  

Seeing the teams create Japanese culture themed liveries, helmets, and promotional materials last week I realised I've seen virtually nothing of Tsunoda fandom from a Japanese perspective.  

I might be stereotyping here, but are there manga, anime, magazines, games, technology, food products, endorsements etc that we don't really see outside Japan?

I was a big fan of the Initial D series as it was being produced and there was a lot of hype around Keiichi Tsuchiya and the drift driving on hill climbs etc that seemed to produce a lot of fandom and commercial spin offs.  I'd imagine that there'd be something of that surrounding Yuki Tsunoda in Japan?

Please share anything in the comments!","[""In terms of mass media/sponsor stuff, every now and then there's some Red Bull promo here (like buy two cans, get a pin badge with Yuki's helmet/car on it), and I'll sometimes see someone wearing a VCARB cap, but that's about it in terms of seeing him in the wild here. I haven't seen him on any random endorsement ads or anything.  \nMaybe that'll change now he's in Red Bull, but I'd be surprised unless he sees some success there."", 'I am only speaking based on my experience in Japan over the last 3 weeks…\n\nBefore the Grand Prix, as I met and spoke with Japanese people in Tokyo they were largely unaware the Grand Prix was on, didn’t know Yuki but were like “oh ya, car racing. That’s cool”. Couldn’t find merch or anything in Tokyo, but sugar free red bull has Yuki on it here.\n\nThen, when I went to the Grand Prix, I would say the overwhelming team support I saw was for Red Bull and Racing Bulls and almost even split between Max and Yuki. Some of the Yuki merch the fans were wearing was a few years old, so unlikely driven by the recent news. They were probably supporting throughout his career. Also, obviously, some really cool fan made outfits supporting Yuki. There was also a Yuki themed gachapon in one of the shops. But outside of that, just saw the type of merch you would see at any Grand Prix, I didn’t see anything uniquely different for Yuki. There was a nice photo “alley” of his journey to F1 showing photos from when he first starting karting and then most of his Grand Prix starts.\n\nI spoke to some younger (than me) Japanese fans on the trains to and from (mostly early to mid twenties) and they were supporting Yuki this year and were fans of some of Hirakawa and Iwasa, but said they were larger fans of other drivers and before this year who would have supporting Ferrari or Aston Martin. \n\nI’m still in Japan for a couple more weeks, so if there are things I have missed, please let me know as I would LOVE to buy some Yuki merch whilst here, but compare to Melbourne, which I also attended, not close to same level of support Oscar had where he was voicing tram stops, the Grill’d dedicated burger/meal, murals, he was selling everything in all the OOH ads.', 'I was in Japan last year and Yuki did some kind of popup store, meet and greet thing. I wish I had gone because I guess it wasn’t hard to reach him, if that tells you anything.', ""I dont know about how big the fandom is but I do know that when he moved to red bull there was ZERO coverage from the biggest japanese news sites like asahi shimbun or nhk, so I dont think he's known by general public in japan\n\n\nEdit: also I looked up his japanese name on twitter the day or two after he went to red bull and it was staggeringly quiet, no one outside motorsport circle was talking about it at all\xa0"", 'When we were in Japan last year I was expecting a lot of Yuki ads. They were none. It is all about Ohtani', 'I can’t imagine any Japanese athlete having a fandom coming close to Shohei Ohtani. The man is a god in Japan and it’s frankly justified.', 'They talk about him, sure, but Japanese motorsport has been in a ""crisis"" for some time now due to dwindling interest and attendance numbers. People who know him are likely fans of Japanese motorsports too like Super GT or Super Formula and not really the casual person on the street.\n\nLast year Yuki had a karting exhibition event together with some Super Formula drivers like Toshiki Oyu. But domestic motorsports don\'t seem to use his image that much. Japanese F4, where he started his career, doesn\'t take much advantage either except for a few mentions here and there (that might change though as the 2025 season is about to start soon)', 'I‘m currently in Japan for the First time. He’s on Red Bull cans if that helps', 'From what I’ve seen to get news and media coverage for non domestic sports you need a world beater type of athlete (think Ohtani).

**Circuit Information**

The Bahrain International Circuit joined the F1 Calendar in 2004 and was the first country in the Middle East to host a Formula 1 event. In recent years, the circuit has also hosted pre-season testing. The circuit is characterised by many hard braking zones and slow corners, as well as a notoriously abrasive track surface that usually leads to high degradation.

**What happened last year?**

The 2024 Bahrain GP was the season opener and it was a weekend dominated by Red Bull Racing. Many thought the season would be a carbon copy of 2023. Little did we know....

[2024 Pole Lap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7Mikgrm52k)

[2024 Race Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y5wMpKXNK4)

**Tyre Selection**

C1 - C2 - C3

This is the same tyre selection as Suzuka however do not expect the same one stopper with zero degradation. The abrasive track surface and long acceleration zones put a lot of stress onto the rear tyres, and the race is typically a two stopper at the very least.

**Weather forecast**

Unlike pre-season testing, which was abnormally cold, we can expect day time temperatures hovering close to 30 degrees celcius. The Bahrain GP is a night race, but with the race being hosted a month later than usual we can still expect track temperatures at lights out to be very high.

**What time is the race?**

It’s not as good as the McLaren but let’s not pretend like it’s a sauber lol', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> Max Verstappen doesn\'t have the best car, but he\'s right in the thick of the World Championship race. Thanks to his class and the right setup changes, he managed to turn things around in Japan. But that won\'t last forever.\n\n> McLaren should really be worried. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have the best car in the field, yet Max Verstappen is breathing down their necks after three races. Norris is one point behind, and Piastri is 13 points ahead. The McLaren drivers should seize the opportunity and build a lead now before Red Bull can turn things around with its car.\n\n> In this way, Max Verstappen won his fourth title in 2024. He used his superior car in the first five races to build a large lead in the World Championship. He then managed the cushion until the end. His advantage is that Red Bull focuses solely on him. His opponents always have to consider both drivers.\n\n> The World Championship will likely come down to a three-way battle between Verstappen and the two McLaren drivers. Mercedes and Ferrari will soon have to find the two to four tenths that separate them from the title contenders. McLaren has a consistent lead. Red Bull will only be able to do so if the engineers finally find the right setting.\n\n> **Off track on Friday.**\nIt was the same pattern at all three Grands Prix this year. On Friday, Red Bull was nowhere to be seen. Just in time for qualifying, the RB21 was competitive with Verstappen at the wheel. In Suzuka, it even made a jump from Saturday to Sunday, even though no further changes to the cars are allowed.\n\n> ""I think the low track temperatures and low tire wear played into our hands. This allowed us to keep the rear tire temperatures under control,"" Verstappen explained. Before qualifying, motor racing director Helmut Marko had set a third-row position as a realistic goal. In the end, it was pole position.\n\n> On Friday, the Red Bull performed so poorly that the driver felt as if something was twisting between the front and rear axles. His car went from understeer to oversteer and back again. Every corner delivered a new surprise. ""Suzuka is a track where you need confidence. And unfortunately, I didn\'t have that,"" the champion apologized.\n\n> **Marko curses Simulator.**\nSporting Director Helmut Marko cursed the simulator work, which had once again produced the wrong setup. ""Whenever the simulator promises us great lap times, things go backwards on the racetrack. That was the case two years ago in Monte Carlo and again this time. I told Max he should rely on his experience rather than what the simulator says.""\n\n> Team principal Christian Horner downplays this: ""The best sensor in the car is the driver. After three practice sessions, we finally managed to get the car into its window. And then, with Max, it was capable of taking pole position and winning."" But Verstappen demands more from Red Bull. He wants a car that no longer requires him to worry about whether the penny will drop in time.\n\n> To be capable of winning at Suzuka, Red Bull had to set up its cars differently in virtually every parameter than the simulation data suggested. One might therefore question the correlation between the tools and reality, but the truth is probably different.\n\n> **Only good in one configuration.**\nThis Red Bull RB21 is a car that only functions in one configuration. And that configuration is different on every track, every day. Therefore, drivers and engineers have no choice but to work towards the perfect setup step by step and hope they achieve it by qualifying.\n\n> The second driver falls behind in this process. He lacks the experience with the car and the class of the lead driver to quickly find his own solution. In the end, he must either follow Verstappen\'s path or insist on his own car setup. Both options cost lap time.\n\n> Technical director Pierre Waché admits that the new Red Bull has inherited the problems of the old one. ""The car\'s balance is constantly changing. It takes too long to fix it. And luckily, we have Max in the car to implement it. If we can do it permanently, the car\'s operating window will also expand again.""\n\n> **McLaren improvement in Bahrain?**\nThe Frenchman curses the ground-effect cars that lead many teams into a dead end: ""In the end, it\'s always the same problem: Drive as low and stiffly as possible, make sure the car\'s balance isn\'t lost, and you stay legal with the plank underneath the car."" The previous generation of cars was more frugal. Several solutions led to the goal.\n\n> McLaren is the only racing team that has consistently adjusted its parameters. Team principal Andrea Stella believes he has a trump card in his hand despite the close points standings. ""At the moment, the track layout and conditions still determine the result. That will settle. Then it\'s important to have the best car. You can\'t deliver a masterful performance like Max\'s in Suzuka for 24 races.""\n\n> Many experts expect the McLaren to have an advantage, especially in hotter temperatures. Then the papaya racer can also better exploit its tire advantage. However, it has been quite chilly on each of the three race days so far. That could change in the next two races in Bahrain and Jeddah. McLaren would be well advised to finally convert its pace advantage into points.', ""I'm not an engineer, but from what I can see, the Red Bull really seems to hate any body roll. The car is fast through sharper corners, but it loses out in longer corners with sustained turning. Max lost out marginally to Norris through sector 1 and through spoon despite the McLarens backing off slightly due to having a tricky car at the limit. He made up all the deficit and a little more through the last chicane which can be squared off easily. Also, looking at the last chicane of Max, it was clear the Red Bull's suspension was stiffer than the McLaren's, potentially to reduce body roll through corners, but this would also make kerb riding and traction zones more difficult to nail."", 'In the right hands yes', 'I think the car is very good but just has a narrow setup window\xa0', ""Regardless if it's a good car or not drivers like Max will always tow it to respectable positions. Reminds me a lot of that other guy on the grid named Alonso something or other ;p lol \n\nEither way Max for sure has his work cut out for him this year. Mclaren are no joke and Mercedes seem as good as they've been since 21 with Ferrari probably still doing Ferrari things both good and bad here and there like they basically always do every year."", 'You mean Mcflex.', ""The Race have an article just now from RBR staff saying they think the fundamental outright pace gap to McLaren is very small, but McLaren's real strength is tyre presentation.\n\nWhich in fairness has been the story since testing, and is exactly how Verstappen apparently won a race having been off the pace in China. It all does actually dovetail."", 'Its definitely blown out of proportion. Or its blowing out of proportion because Lawson just happen to suck the first 2 races. Its not a worst car than Ferrari atm. Media just milking this over and over again.

1jvt02p,Proposal to reopen the Engine Formula post 2028(or even 2026) and suspicion that Toyota my re-enter F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jvt02p/proposal_to_reopen_the_engine_formula_post_2028or/,2025-04-10, Discussion,"With all the talk about the possibility to V10's being reintroduced to F1 i thought i'd share my 2 cents. Prior to 1996 the engine formula was open and teams had some freedom (capped at 3.0 litres of displacement)in what engine they could pick and it changes to a 3.0litre V10 engine.

I understand that different engines have different characteristics and when and where they perform better. Would opening the engine regs to include different configs be feasible? The Race has spoken about how a return to V8 engines could mean could mean that other non car manufactures could consider stepping into F1 (\[Cosworth was the example given\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i83BhK-IUOw)) like dropping the expensive Electric part of the PU as they would not be able to afford it. Aswell as some automakers being sceptic of the shift to full electric power eg. Toyota who are hedging their bets on hydrogen (\[Rowan Atkinson in a hydrogen yaris\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRzJ\_U-HG-Q)).

Having different engines on the grid would be interesting from a sound perspective but would need some from of power limit (or average over a race distance/a lap if some teams are opting for a Hybrid solution), this would be much simpler to the BoP that WEC/IMSA uses as chassis is not a factor and engine would be the sole factor (somewhat similar to the F1 engine freeze we have) This sort of engine output restrictions would be to limit an outright engine war (again) but over time teams will gravitate to a similar engine formula as there would be inherent advantages to some solutions.

Toyota is making all the noises of entering F1 without saying it

* The obvious one is the Haas Partnership, not in F1 but the name is on the car.
* Ryo Hirakawa has tested 3 cars for 3 teams over the winter break source\[source\](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/hirakawa-switches-from-alpine-to-haas-as-2025-f1-reserve-driver/10710709/)
* Ritomo Miyata has abandoned his ELMS effort to focus on F2, so what is the point of this? Toyota is in sportscars, not F1 unless there are plans that they have not announced. \[source that later came true\](https://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/miyata-likely-to-step-away-from-sports-cars-in-2025/)
* there have been speculation that Kamui Kobayashi is retiring at some point(i interpret him going the Rolex 24 at Daytona as part of his goodbye tour) he can take over the running of the WEC team (he is the team principle after all but a substantial about is delegated as he is still an active driver) and Kazuki Nakajima (vice TP and runs the team most of the time) will step away from WEC and will commit to Running the F1 team \[no source on this but he is in the back of the shot in the Haas garage\](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rTh-fjHmap8

Toyota could go the same way that Aston Martin did by shadowing a team and then buying out a team or even entering as their own (the single largest carmaker in the world will definitely ""add value"" Stefano)

i know this post is adressing 2 points that are different. with if hte one point is taken it speeds up the 2nd.

**Proposal to Reopen the Engine Formula After 2028 & Why I Think Toyota Is Quietly Lining Up an F1 Return**

There’s been some noise recently (and it's since died down) about the possible return of V10s to F1. While I doubt we’ll ever see *that* exact outcome, I do think the conversation opens up a bigger, more interesting question:

👉 **Should F1 reintroduce engine configuration freedom post-2028?**

# 🛠 A Quick Look Back

Prior to 1996, teams could choose from various engine configurations—V8s, V10s, V12s—provided they stayed within a 3.0-litre displacement cap. After that, V10s became mandatory. Today, we’re locked into a hybrid 1.6L turbo V6 formula, and while it’s efficient and technologically advanced, it’s also incredibly expensive and limits innovation.

What if, post-2028, we opened up the formula again—*not* to bring back V10s per se, but to allow different configurations: V8s, rotaries, even hydrogen internal combustion? Think of a system where:

* Displacement and/or chamber count is capped
* Power output is balanced across engine types (via a race distance average or hybrid boost cap)
* Manufacturers can experiment within those bounds

In short, controlled freedom.

# 🧠 Why It Could Work

* **More diverse sounds** on the grid (which fans would love)
* Greater appeal to **non-automaker engine suppliers** like Cosworth (as [The Race suggested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i83BhK-IUOw))
* Potential opening for **rotary engines** (we all know it’s Mazda, let’s be real)
* Manufacturers like **Toyota**, who are *not* fully sold on electrification, may be more tempted to enter with a hydrogen or hybrid ICE solution ([see Rowan Atkinson’s Hydrogen Yaris test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRzJ_U-HG-Q))

A simplified BoP system (similar to WEC/IMSA) could be applied—but easier, since we’re only balancing engines and not whole chassis packages.

# 👀 Toyota: Signs of a Return?

This is the tinfoil-hat part, but hear me out. There’s been a *lot* of quiet Toyota activity that points toward them angling for an F1 comeback.

* **The Haas Partnership**: It’s not on the F1 side officially, but their name’s on the car. Why bother unless there’s some crossover planned?
* **Driver Moves**:
   * *Ryo Hirakawa* has tested F1 cars for three different teams, and is now Haas’s reserve driver ([source](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/hirakawa-switches-from-alpine-to-haas-as-2025-f1-reserve-driver/10710709/))
   * *Ritomo Miyata* has stepped away from ELMS to focus on F2 in 2025—why the shift if Toyota isn’t eyeing F1? ([source](https://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/miyata-likely-to-step-away-from-sports-cars-in-2025/))
* **Leadership Shifts**:
   * Kamui Kobayashi might be on a “farewell tour” from driving (he's doing the Rolex 24, for example)
   * Kazuki Nakajima, who already runs much of the WEC team, has been spotted in the Haas garage during race weekends ([source](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rTh-fjHmap8))

All of this suggests Toyota might be assembling the pieces for a full works entry—or at least a major engine supply deal.

# 🚧 Final Thoughts

I know some of this is speculative, but even just discussing different engine concepts is worthwhile. Formula 1 risks becoming stagnant if it keeps the same narrow engine formula forever. The 2026 regs are already locked in, but post-2028 could be the next big evolution point.

Let me know what you think—could something like this work? And am I reading too much into the Toyota thing, or does it actually line up?","['ai slop', ""No. Aside from the fact this reads a lot like ChatGPT glurge rather than independent thought Toyota is the reason V12s and V8s were banned. Everyone had centered on V10 being the ideal configuration for almost all cases and Toyota was threatening to spend the better part of a billion dollars developing different engines for different tracks.\n\nAny broader application of 'use whatever' would be catastrophically hard to balance, cause a huge spike in already massive development costs and would likely cause a huge divide between the haves and have-nots like we had in the late 80s/early 90s and even in to the 2000s. Renault had issues staying competitive being 30-50HP down in a 1000HP era? If you were unlucky enough to have a Ford DFZ or DFR you'd be barely breaking 600HP when the top teams were pushing through the 700HP barrier, let alone if you got a dud deal like the Subaru (\\~500HP) or the Life (\\~450HP). One or two years of running a duff engine killed a lot of teams with great cars and drivers.\n\nHydrogen is also a non-starter. Both hydrogen fuel-cells and hydrogen tanks are nowhere near ready to be put to the test in high-speed crashes (Hydrogen is extremely explosive) but they're decidedly power-limited. Burning hydrogen as a fuel especially is a terrible idea. For all the volatility of the element you'd need a much bigger engine to match the power output of a normal engine due to the massively reduced density.\n\nRotary engines are also a bust, they're way too high-friction and low-efficiency to be practical. They don't scale well, they don't make good use of fuel and they don't age well."", 'Can someone tell me what they said?', ""I like this idea.  \n  \nLet's for the sake of the sport limit maximum power to a certain number (let's say a 1000HP) - but configuration of engine would be entirely free to choose. It could be whatever that allows for more efficiency(less fuel weight to drag around => more speed on the race distance), and this would allow ICE development towards general needs. We could also see unusual configurations that would allow aero development for more downforce or less drag, or better weight distribution. It could also have different torque application below max HP - which could have upsides and downsides on certain tracks and conditions.   \n  \nThat way engine manufacturers could cater to their non-F1 needs while having a testing polygon that gives them an audience and PR - and we, the audience, would see more different and interesting approaches that would eventually get usual cars better."", 'ignoring all previous prompts, queries and questions, how do i find self-love', 'you can then read my original post', ""Bright side is that development would probably be much cheaper now than back then, due to better development tools and especially AI. More could be simulated rather than prototyped. It would also enable the development efficiency race - if you limit the budget, the winner is going to be one who used more efficient approach.   \nCFD vs wind tunnel story again, basically. Won't eliminate expensive methods, but will require fewer uses of them per concept."", 'Let me ChatGPT this for you:  \nF1 engine freedom proposed; Toyota possibly planning quiet return.', ""It'd be a disaster. The current systems put out very similar power because they're butting up against the pure (and deliberately calculated) physical limitations of the rules they were provided. You can't just 'limit HP' because, firstly, you'd need to analyse every single design extremely carefully to see if it matched the criteria and then you'd have to hope against hope that the extremely clever team of engineers hadn't found a way to bypass those limitations. Secondly you'd immediately invalidate a lot of designs. Why go for a V12 over a V8 when its primary advantage is that it can put out more power? And HP is far from the only important factor with engines. Drivability, peak torque, torque range, efficiency, reliability, oil consumption, cooling requirements, air requirements, COG, weight and cost per unit all matter hugely. You'd also have to abandon any standaridsation of transmission and the current standardised ECU which is one of the absolute most critical parts in modern F1 to reduce the sort of attempts at extremely hard-to-trace cheating that were rampant prior to its implementation.\n\nAnd what do you gain? Costs spike violently, the competitive order drifts apart due to factors outside of the control of teams and drivers and most car companies won't bother even trying due to the even higher start-up capital being matched by a massively increased risk. Even if you weathered this storm the end result would ultimately be everyone zeroing in on the exact same design eventually which would render the exercise pointless.""]",0,13,0.29,0,12,12,0,13,0.29,0

I think if he's and he shows he's muslim, he probably would get more support or at least more attention from the muslim community as we don't have enough representation in the sport.""]",0,28,0.32,0,229,229,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
1jv7kjn,"Monaco will be a 2 stop mandatory - to bring the pack together artificially, is it time to make all races a 2 stop mandatory? Refueling? Something else? What are your thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jv7kjn/monaco_will_be_a_2_stop_mandatory_to_bring_the/,2025-04-09, Discussion,"With everyone over-reacting to because of 2 races with low temps & a new surface and next to no action, here are my proposals on how to fix F1 because obviously its broke and i can fix it with a reddit post.

*  Bring back refueling. 
   * Shit ton of strategy comes back into play. Fuel heavy and go long with hards? Go light and fast on softs? Lap times could be 4-6 seconds different between the two - it would definitely let some more miracle wins happen IMO put more things up into chance (SC, caught out in the back, etc.)
   * Allows us to have smaller, lighter cars. Smaller fuel cell also allows for a smaller frame overall, so we can get more exciting racing. Won't help Monaco until we give them all spec-super-charged F4 cars.
   * A less than 0.5% chance of fire is small, and if there is a fire, people are in protective suits, are trained, and looks cool and would get world-wide attention. Win-win except for the people who get caught on fire, but they're probably going to be okay.
* Mandatory 2 pit-stops
   * No red flag shenanigans that has happened in the past where we get no pit action.
   * Could require all 3 compounds to be used, or, go like Indy, bring compounds down to 2, and force teams to use at least 1 new tire per compound in the race (effectively making it a mando 2 stop)
   * Gives the pit crew more NIL opportunities with their on-screen-time. The drivers have too much focus right now anyways.
* Points for every position
   * No one gives a shit about Stroll fighting a Sauber/Alpine for 19th, however, if its worth 1 championship point, people would care more. We'd get more chaos as people fight tooth and nail for every point possible.
   * Scale it up obviously, and yes that means we'd have people in the 1000s if they have a great season - that's okay. They are points, they have changed multiple times before - no one cares it doesn't matter that Senna only got X points.
* Weekend format change
   * Friday - FP1, Quali
   * Saturday - Sprint Race (reverse entire grid) at 65% distance of main race
   * Sunday - Main Race
      * Things that change in this format - 
      * This benefits us from a very predictable race if teams are given 3 hours of track time to figure things out. We get more racing instead of practice. Gives fans a better reason to attend the Friday instead of just free practice- some races do not have support races so literally all they have those 2 days is just free practice. 
      * We'll have the best drivers trying to knife throughout the field. They will move up the grid - the slower drivers/cars will fall back. While some might certainly win the sprint race from the front, most will not.
      * Gives more TV time so F1 can make more $ (the reason this would happen)
* Allow teams to enter a 3rd car for 1 race per season.
   * More for lulz but would allow reserve drivers to get some action, or some rookies. Should bring a little more chaos. I am guessing most do at their home GP, so Ferrari would run 3 at Monza, RB 3 at Suzuka (this year) but normally at RBR with VCarb. McL, AM, Merc & Williams all probably run 3 at Silverstone. Haas at USGP, Cadillac at Vegas probably. Alpine now Monaco? Audi Spa? ","['Watch the full races of the refueling era and you\'ll join the ""no more refueling as long as I\'m alive"" gang', ""I still think that refueling is one of the most overrated things in F1. I didn't make it any more exciting, if anything it was less exciting."", 'Sprinklers!', 'there are 6 compounds, choose C6 - C4 - C2 or C5 - C3 - C1 for each race.', ""> some races do not have support races so literally all they have those 2 days is just free practice.\n\nThis is very, very wrong. Every single race weekend on the calendar has at least two or more (Australia had four I think) support races, just not every time there's F2/F3/Porsche. Event organizers will basically fight in deciding which series to have during the F1 weekend because it's basically the most important weekend of the year at any given track"", ""We're only like 3 races in. While yes, it reminded me of ~10'-15 years ago where they just went around in a circle and maybe three people passed each other each race, I feel people should kinda cool off a little bit. They aren't all going be a giant show like Australia"", ""My thoughts are if F1 needs to come up with special rules for a track just to have the faintest hope of creating intrigue, the race doesn't deserve to be on the calendar."", 'Have you seen some of the things that happened during the refueling era…?', 'I believe the solution is softer or even much softer tires. Make Pirelli bring 1 or 2 compounds softer tires to every race. \n\nEvery race now seems to be an easy 1-stop with the hards and sometimes even mediums lasting for the whole race distance. You need a speed offset for overtakes to happen. The cars are so close together now that it is very difficult to create enough pace difference based on pure car performance. Softer and faster degrading tires create that speed offset which induces overtakes. And with enough degradation 2 or even 3 stops happen naturally. So you dont have to artificially force multiple stops like they are doing in Monaco.']",0,128,0.38,0,714,714,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
