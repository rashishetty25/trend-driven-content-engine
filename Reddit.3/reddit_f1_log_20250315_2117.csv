1jbrcyn,So is the Redbull that hard of a car to drive? Or is Max just Schumacher 1997-type level?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jbrcyn/so_is_the_redbull_that_hard_of_a_car_to_drive_or/,2025-03-15, Discussion,"Seriously, at this point I don’t even know what to believe anymore. There’s no way all his past teammates are this bad. Gasly, Albon, Perez, Lawson all over 6 tenths or more slower than Max in the same car. Hell, Perez was closer in the 2020 RP than he was in 2021 RB, meaning RP was probably the 2nd quickest car in 2020, but Max is just an alien.

It’s very early; but Albon will probably be at least equal or very very close to Sainz. Obvs it his first quali session, but rarely did drivers close such a deficit over a season and then gain it on top. 

I’m genuinely starting to think Max might have spoken the truth when he said in 2020 “I’m 2 tenths faster than anyone else”.  And that “everyone else” included the likes of prime or at least very close to prime Hamilton.

I haven’t seen this level of domination since Schumacher in the 90’s. Just levels above everyone. That generation was also made to look bad by him, because great drivers like Barrichello or Irvine who beat almost all of their other teammates, including legends of the 80’s but also future talents(hell, old Rubens was matching a prime Jensen Button; who wasn’t that far off Lewis) were absolutely demolished by Schumacher. And the media couldn’t accept Schumacher was that much better than everyone else, so the entire generation was just deemed weak.

I think Max at this point has the same effect, however this generation is more proven because we’ll have direct comparison between Leclerc-Vettel, Norris-Ricciardo, Russell-Lewis,  Leclerc-Lewis, Albon-Sainz etc.

","[""Probably a mix of both. Max is an all time great calibre of driver but also the car is very difficult to find a balance with that gives the driver confidence. Max can live with that, his teammates haven't been able to and it widens the gap between them.\n\nIf the car was more compliant his teammates would be closer. I remember an interview with Irvine talking about his time at Ferrari and he said every year the car got a little bit easier to drive and he'd get a little bit closer to Michael."", 'Max is Schumacher level. But to be honest, I was never that impressed by Lawson so I didn’t think he’d be any closer to Max than Checo was.', ""It's both. \n\nLike with Schumacher I think there is a gap between Verstappen and the rest of the field. \n\nThe Red Bull is also extremely sensitive and it's appears pretty much impossible for anyone but a driver as attuned to sensitivity as Verstappen to drive the car at 100%."", 'It has been one (1) qualifying session', 'No doubt Max is one of the most talented out there, but Lawson’s session wasn’t reflective at all - he made a lot of mistakes on a track that punishes. \n\nHe’s unlikely to beat max but the difference isn’t quite what we saw this weekend so far.', ""Lawson's last lap in quali was awful, full of mistakes. There's no way that he is that bad in the car, I've never seen him doing similar things in RB. I'm pretty sure the car is pretty much undrivable for everyone except for Max. \nThat said, Max is a beast and he would probably beat everyone as his teammate even with an easier car to drive."", 'There are still people who underestimate how great Max really is.', ""Max is one of the best drivers to ever do it.\n\nI have no doubts that you could put anyone in the 2nd seat currently and Max would come out ahead.\n\nHowever, drivers like Gasly, Albon, Perez and now Lawson? They're not top drivers, so it's not exactly a big surprise that they are lagging behind Max.

Puts in a great lap but Norris always seems able to just find that extra tenth every time', '> ""Yeah, I went a bit deep into Turn 11,” Piastri recalled to media including Motorsport Week.\n\n> “With these tyres, with the hot temperature, as soon as you slide them a little bit or get them dirty, they drop off a lot.\n\n> “I struggled a lot with the last sector and then went off at the second-last corner. That’s the fine line around here.\n\n> “I think that’s been a little bit of a struggle with our car so far – it’s been quick, but it bites at times. I’m pretty happy with the job I did, and I’ll go back and see where it could have been a little bit better.”\n\n> But Piastri becoming the debut Australian driver to claim an F1 pole on home soil was not to be as team-mate Norris usurped him right at the death to claim top spot.\n\n> “It was pretty good. I was happy with it,” Piastri reviewed.\n\n> “This weekend I’ve been happy with the laps we’ve been putting in and how I have been executing them apart from the first lap of Q3.\n\n> “But apart from that, I’ve been happy with how I’ve driven.\n\n> “I think the last lap, there’s nothing I’m majorly kicking myself about. The gap is very tight, obviously, and I just needed that little bit more.”\n\n> Piastri denied he was downbeat at having come up 0.084 seconds short, though, citing that he was pleased with his execution amid his troubles over one lap in 2024.\n\n> “I wouldn’t say I’m disappointed because I feel like I did a job I’m happy with,” he added.\n\n> “If I was sitting here thinking, ‘I had another two-tenths in hand, and I blew it’, then I’d be pretty upset.\n\n> “But I feel like I’ve executed well this weekend. That’s all I can ask of myself.\n\n> “There are always things to improve and do better, and I’ll try to look at those, but ultimately, I’m happy with how I’ve driven this weekend.”\n\n> Asked to give his take on McLaren’s race pace, Piastri said: “Pretty happy. Yesterday felt quite good. If it’s dry, then I think we’re in a good place.\n\n> “If it’s wet, it’s very difficult to tell. There are a lot of places that can catch you out here.\n\n> There are a few corners that in the dry are not corners, that are very much corners in the rain. It becomes a fair bit trickier.\n\n> “And then you’ve got white lines everywhere, with it obviously being a road circuit. We’re pretty confident for tomorrow.”\n\n> Piastri retorted the notion that the chance to become the first Australian since Alan Jones in 1980 to win their home race has enlarged the pressure on his shoulders.\n\n> “In terms of pressure, honestly, I said in the lead-up that I was using it as support and not pressure, and that’s genuinely been the case,” he said.\n\n> “Of course, you want to start the season well and do well at home, those things are obvious, but I think I’ve done a good job of being strong and not letting that get in my head.\n\n> I’m happy with how I’ve approached the weekend, how I’ve driven, and the support has been really special.

The greedy bastards want you to sign up for some Hulu or Disney bundle crap.
I’m pissed and feel blood pressure rising. They have no pity for seniors it seems.
Comcast / Xfinity are greedy enough on their own.
So I guess I’ll catch Q highlights on YouTube…

You can start it today, and they usually even have free trials. It's a lot cheaper than cable and you get a very cable-like experience. On youtubetv, quali is going to be on ESPN U. Best of luck.
