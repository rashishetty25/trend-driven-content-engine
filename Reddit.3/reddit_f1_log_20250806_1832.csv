It's somewhat remarkable consistency really. Looking at the Constructor's results since 2009, Ferrari's average finishing position is 2.88. 

Broken down by year:

* 2nd place ‚Äì 7 times (2012, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022, 2024)
* 3rd place ‚Äì 6 times (2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2021, 2023)
* 4th place ‚Äì 2 times (2009, 2014)
* 6th place ‚Äì 1 time (2020)

(Even the one 6th place finish is somewhat of an outlier, following on from the very cool and very legal engine in 2019. This is a factual description, there is no need to speculate on this).

Bear in mind that there have been numerous regulations changes over this period. 

The other teams fighting at the front (Red Bull, Mercedes and McLaren) have all had their championships and struggles, but Ferrari are just so consistently nearly men.

For reference, Red Bull is the next best runner-up, finishing second in the Constructors 5 times over the same period.

Comparing drivers across different teams is never straightforward, especially with all the mid-season shuffling that goes on. To keep things fair and avoid car-based bias, I‚Äôm only looking at how each rookie performed compared to their teammate on the exact weekends they both raced. So for cases like Doohan and Colapinto, each rookie gets matched against Gasly‚Äîbut only using Gasly‚Äôs stats from the races they shared. It‚Äôs basically like splitting Gasly into two drivers, one for each rookie stint.

On the flip side, with Lawson and Hadjar, who had different teammates during the season, each one‚Äôs ‚Äúteammate‚Äù is a blend of stats from whoever was alongside them at each race. This way, the comparisons always line up with who was actually on the other side of the garage at the time.

Also, since lap times can vary wildly from track to track, I compare lap time gaps as percentages, not raw numbers, where the baseline is the teammate's time. That way, the results reflect true performance differences, not just circuit quirks.

  
**Clarification on the third plot**

How can BOR be slower in average than his teammate and yet have a better average qualifying position? He outqualified HUL by 12 positions twice. If we ignore those two weekends, his mark would be very close to BEA's. However, those two amazing Q's pull him to the left *way more* than they pull him down.","[""Fun post and interesting data. For instance, I knew that COL was closer to GAS on race pace than DOO had been, but I didn't know he was also closer to his team mate on that metric than BOR (rookie of the season so far, IMO)."", ""Great post. The race pace delta kinda deals a blow to the idea that COL has not been better than Doohan. That's a very wide margin in favor of Colapinto."", 'Personally I would remove the first 2 races for Lawson. I would rather just see how he compared to Hadjar.', 'Damn, Kimi is really being left in the dust by Russel, specially on race pace.\n\nIt would also be nice to have the gaps in thents of a second to visualize it better I think.', 'The thing is that only Antonelli is up against a championship quality driver.

He either improves or is out of F1 in less than 3 years."", 'I think this comparison between Hadjar and Lawson is a bit unfair, since Lawson can be considered a ""rookie,"" and his time at Red Bull destroyed his confidence. If it were Hadjar and Yuki, Hadjar would probably be losing. I believe Hadjar, Bortoleto, and Bearman are the best this year. \n\nFor everything they\'ve sold about Antonelli so far, he\'s failing to deliver while driving the second- or third-best car on the grid.', 'Is sprint included into the qualifying gaps?']",105,94,0.91,105,86,86,36,18,0.020000000000000018,36

It was actually Lando Norris who pulled me into the sport. His social media presence, humor, and down-to-earth vibe really stood out to me and made F1 feel more accessible. From watching clips of him joking around with other drivers to getting a glimpse into his personality off the track, I got curious about the actual races, and now I‚Äôm completely hooked. I‚Äôve been diving deep into past seasons, race highlights, team rivalries, and everything in between.

That said, I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for Ferrari too. Growing up in the U.S., my exposure to F1 was limited, but I still knew about Michael Schumacher. He was a legend, and as someone with German heritage, I always admired him. Most of my motorsports background comes from watching NASCAR as a kid, since that was way more mainstream here in the States, but Schumacher and Ferrari still managed to break through that and grab my attention.

So now I find myself rooting for Lando first, but also hoping Ferrari can get back to being dominant. If Lando ever switches teams, I‚Äôd follow him without question. But there‚Äôs still that nostalgic pull toward Ferrari that keeps them as a secondary favorite for me.

Operationally they were appalling, slow pit stops, awful Strategy and poor reliability.\n\nIn 2023 the team slowly improved throughout the year\xa0and were second fastest by the end of it, they carried this through to 2024 and also fixed the main problem they had had in 2023, bad tyre wear. Suddenly in 2024 they had the best tyre wear on the gird bar maybe Haas. The first example of many of Vasseur identifying a poor area and improving it.\xa0\n\nAnd in 2024 Vasseur led them to what is in my opinion Ferrari‚Äôs best season since 2008! They looked like a different team and were the best on the grid operataionally.\xa0\n\nAnd now this season, while the car is not good enough to win, it is slowly improving, points became podiums and now they have a pole.\xa0\n\nBut also you can only blame the team principal so much for a disappointing car. He does not build the car, he hires the people who do, and Vasseur had made many high profile signings of successful designers up and down the grid.\xa0\n\nThe things the team principal is more responsible for, is how the team performs operationally. And Vasseur inherited a team that was woeful operationally and had not capitalised on a great car in 2022.\xa0\n\nAnd Vasseur has made this team amazing operationally, bar the outright pace, everything else about Ferrari is very good.\xa0\n\nIn the strategy department they were probably the best team in 2024, Japan, Netherlands, Monza, USA were all races where the strategy directly won places and Monza was the best example. At Ferrari‚Äôs home race everyone had rules out a Ferrari win after qulaifying, heck everyone had ruled them out by lap 30. But they rolled the dice, the Ferrari gambit. No one thought the one stop was on but Ferrari and Vasseur knew that it was the only way they could win. So they went for it and won at Monza!\xa0\n\nThe pit stops are another perfect example of Vasseur identifying a place where Ferrari were lacking, and improving it. It was ridiculous how often Ferrari from 2019-2022 would randomly have a long pit stop. But this year they have not only improved, but have probably been THE BEST team on the pit stop front, with the crew doing an incredible job under Vasseur‚Äôs leadership.\xa0\n\nAnd the bad reliability that plagued them and their customer teams throughout 2022 is all but eradicated. I don‚Äôt recall a Ferrari dropping out of a race due to reliability since Brazil 2023!\xa0\n\nFerrari have been a little disappointing this season, but they‚Äôre still second in the standings.\nAnd Ferrari are always firing their team principals and things dont change when they do.\xa0\n\nAnd let‚Äôs not forget that he masterminded the biggest and most dramatic driver transfer in the sports history. Even if Lewis is worse performing than Sainz (which id like to add looked unlikely after Lewis‚Äôs great season in 2023 that preceded Ferrari signimg him) this is an incredible move for Ferrari because Lewis brings so much good publicity to the team and has attracted the joint biggest sponsorship deal in F1 history, the HP deal. Like the blue or not this is gargantuan momey for Ferrari and Vasseur is again the guy that led the team to this deal. And I doubt Hamilton wouldve gone to Ferrari without Vasseur. Let‚Äôs not forget Vasseur worked directly with Hamilton in GP2 and they have always appeared to be friendly with each other.\xa0\n\nAnd Ferrari appears to be a much friendlier place than the cold team that it was before, shrouded in controversy every other year and now it seems very nice with a very fun man at the head. I think Ferrari is a very healthy medium exemplified by 2024 when they worked themselves into a title fight they shouldnt really have been in. But Red Bull had such a toxic environment and McLaren seemed to be trying to win the title by the power of friendship. Ferrari had a very healthy team.\n\nWhen I look at the team that Vasseur inherited, and then look at the team it is now, I think Vasseur should be proud of what he‚Äôs done and it deserves to be appreciated by both Ferrari themselves and the fans.', '[ Removed by Reddit ]', ""Elkann - ‚Äú*We‚Äôve had a rough season, and that is why it is really important to ensure that we end well and we start the second half very strong and full of energy,*‚Äù he expressed.\n\nThe seeds of the destruction are right here. It's every team's purpose to win, or at least do well, but wanting to do well for the sake of saving face isn't productive for them. They don't have enough time or resources to meaningfully turn the car around, but there's so much they need to do in terms of how they operate and communicate to set the foundation for the future. Ferrari is that runner who never does a proper long-slow-run day because they are always trying to beat the time on the stopwatch every run."", 'Fred is definitely the right TP for the new regulations especially with Loic Serra finally getting to show what he‚Äôs capable of in leading the chassis design going forward.', 'They want to keep the achievements of his last years there and continue not winning anything', 'Bro said:\n\n>  It doenst need much explaining\n\nAnd then wrote 14 paragraphs of text üíÄ', ""I'll add one thing to this: Firing Fred now would be the same as dooming the team when 2026 kicks in, because he is also overseeing the development of next year's car.

1mizfhc,Which team has the best driver pairing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mizfhc/which_team_has_the_best_driver_pairing/,2025-08-06, Discussion,"I've asked this question a couple of times in the past and it has always sparked some interesting discussions, so I thought the summer break would provide a good opportunity for another one: 

In the first half of the season, which team in your opinion had the best driver pairing? How you interpret ""best"" is completely up to you of course, consistency, potential (maybe if even unfulfilled), you name it. It just has to be for both drivers. No Max bailing the team out (spoilers).

I've only done this for the best four teams so far, but given that the field is so incredibly close, it's probably fair to include all teams. I'll go first (duh):

**1. McLaren** This is the only one where I'll outright disagree with you if you have a different opinion. I said it wasn't close when I asked this question after race 5 or so and a bunch of you disagreed and went for Ferrari instead, and fair enough, but I genuinely think at this point McLaren has had the best driver pairing by a mile. There's barely anything between them, they deliver what can be expected from this rocketship of a car, and while as a Piastri fan I'd love for him to win this, it'd be incredibly exciting to see their form continue after the summer break and ideally we get a titanic battle up to the last race.

**2. Ferrari** This is already where it gets tricky to judge. The car has gone up and down from race to race (you can basically copy paste this for every team bar McLaren). Chuck has been excellent, but Hamilton has struggled more than I think many people expected. His qualifying especially has been pretty rough lately, but his racecraft on Sunday has saved him a couple of times. We're not quite yet at Checo levels of ""bad saturday, good sunday"" yet, but he's probably happy about the summer break for a reset.

**3. Mercedes** Effectively the same as with Ferrari, but below them because I think Kimis lows have been lower than Hamiltons. He has shown that he has the speed and talent, but it's a tough place in the spotlight for a rookie, especially against such amazing drivers in the other top teams. He's a rookie after all, he'll learn, but now he needs to show that he has the resilience to bounce back. George has been amazing in a so-so car, just slightly below Chuck for me.

Positions 4 to 8 can really be put in any order and I'd agree. Not only the cars are incredibly close, so are the pairings in my opinion.

**4. Sauber** Probably a controversial one and very likely influenced by recency bias, but these two have genuinely impressed me. The car was arguably the worst one at the start of the season and the results show, but Nico was generally solid to good, has managed to pick up the occasional points and as soon as the car improved he was there (and even, finally, got the damn podium). But even more impressive in my opinion and why they are so high up: Bortoleto is making a very strong case for being the best rookie of the season. Was given a rough hand with the Sauber car in the beginning, but he kept his head down, improved steadily, gained his first points and is even ahead of Nico in qualifying. If he keeps this up, boy can we expect great things of him in the future. With the momentum he's gained lately, he probably wishes to skip the summer break entirely.

**5. Williams** These would probably be among the top 3 with 2 Albons, but unfortunately Sainz has been struggling quite a bit to adapt. I remember people saying he'd wipe the floor with Albon, but it's safe to say this hasn't happened. He has the occasional drive where he shows just how good he is, but in a field this close any small mistake gets punished harshly. Obligatory ""the car is up and down"".

**6. Aston Martin** Car up and down yada yada. Alonso is Alonso and has been on point whenever the car and luck allowed him to be, and Stroll has been quietly having a really solid season with some very strong drives.

**7. Racing Bulls** Very hard to judge with two rookies, and one of them even got his spirit broken very early in the season. These would likely be a lot higher had Yuki stayed there. Hadjar has been excellent and is here to stay I think, and Lawson has shown lately how fast he can be in the right environment. If the trend continues, these two have the potential to become a really scary midfield pairing imo.

**8. Haas** Essentially the same text as Sauber, just a bit lower in general. Ocon I think is on the same level as Hulk, but Ollie hasn't had the headturning moments that we've seen from Bortoleto (I'm just realising that I'm using the wildest mix of first and last names).

**9. Red Bull** Likely another controversial take to put them this low, but they effectively haven't been a **pairing** for the biggest part of the season. They've been an amazing Max and somewhere in the distance the second car. I'd put them even lower if the second car wasn't such a toxic spot that will almost by design crush any driver that isn't the highest quality. Also, Yuki has shown signs of improvement, even if it didn't result in any points. Red Bull can consider themselves so damn lucky that Max stays with them at least for 26.

**10. Alpine** Someone has to be last, and for me it's the team that manages to outmess even Red Bull (not that this is their driver's fault, I just wanted to mention how much of a mess this team is). Pierre has been as good as we know we can expect from him and puts a genuinely horrible car higher than it deserves, but they are the only team that hasn't scored any points with their second car. Doohan was being given a shit hand from the get go, and Colapinto hasn't lived up to the hype.

  
This was my take, what's your's? : )
