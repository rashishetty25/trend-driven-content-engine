What irritates me is when Jack was struggling all we heard about was how he is going to lose his seat the poor fella must of had pressure from everywhere, but now Franco is struggling and there doesn't seem to be anywhere near the pressure. Why is that? The media doesn't seem to even want to talk about him or even interview him. I saw at least 10 interviews with Jack before he stood down asking him the worst questions, and some of them were very rude. Why the different treatment?","['as an aussie it was pretty rough watching the treament of doohan. everything with him was a comparison to his dad (way more than they ever have with sainz/sainz)and then basic ""how did pace feel today?""\n\nthe narrative the whole time was essentially he wasnt good enough and waiting him out til he was replaced, which seemed to be a plan regardless of how he did', 'Because it was 90% Franco’s batshit fan base that raved about Doohan 24/7, and now ofc he’s not performing like they expected they’re all quiet', 'Because it doesn\'t really matter, in all honesty.

Colapinto seems to be pretty similar to Doohan in terms of pace which makes it looks like the millions Alpine spent to buy him out of the contract was pointless given they could have just kept Doohan in. \n\nHaving said that, Alpine are last in the constructors and the only way they improve on that is by giving Colapinto or Doohan some bloody stability. Time in the car is scarce and precious and you need to become an expert in how it handles to be able to extract the lap time and be able to give solid feedback regarding the set up. Just look at how Sainz and Hamilton aren’t fully up to speed yet despite how good they are. \n\nAs for the media, there are far more interesting stories on the grid and this one is just a B Tech version of the Tsunoda at Red Bull story.', 'Because the ""5 race contract"" isn\'t an actual thing and was most probably invented by the Alpine PR department.

Nobody is waiting in line right now, so there is not much drama to report on.', 'Similar situation to Liam vs Yuki I guess - everyone’s realised the car is garbage and have lowered their expectations accordingly.', ""My take on the\xa0Franco Colapinto and Jack Doohan situation is that F1 isn't usually a sport where you generally get a long runway.

This wasn’t the case at the start.\n\nIronically, it seems a bit like the Red Bull in a way - except Gasly’s the teammate somehow able to extract performance now, rather than the second driver who’s struggling big time.

The reason: How much revolutionary their brakes are. Tire conservation and the capability of keeping them on the right temperature window will still be key and this is not changing with the new regs. 

We have seen that when the temps are cooler they don’t dominate as much, but in so many circuits the temps are hard to control and they do it so much better than the rest. If other teams don’t find out how to replicate that technology, it’s going to take a much, much faster car to offset that advantage. 

I get that 2009 double-diffuser feeling, but in this case, much harder to copy. 

Thoughts? ","[""People will eventually figure out how McLaren's handling the brakes, and will get it copied sufficiently.

1l32qc7,What is Actually Going on With Lance Stroll?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l32qc7/what_is_actually_going_on_with_lance_stroll/,2025-06-04, Discussion,"**Sure, the official story is probably true... but where’s the fun in that? This is F1 — when has anything ever been that simple?**

The timing of Lance’s withdrawal from the Spanish Grand Prix was *weird*. We're told he’s been dealing with this wrist issue for six weeks, yet he’d already logged several hours in the car over the weekend. So why suddenly pull out right before the race? If it was just discomfort, surely he could’ve pushed through another 90 minutes — drivers (and Lance) have raced through worse.

Plus, the team couldn’t even field the car at all, suggesting the issue is more than just physical pain. That raises a flag, especially when we’ve seen (thanks to *Drive to Survive*) how much Lance was willing to endure just to make the grid after the initial injury.

Now, it looks like he might miss his *home race* — arguably the biggest event for him personally and a huge opportunity for Aston Martin in terms of marketing and merchandise. You’d think he and the team would do *anything* to delay treatment until after that weekend, unless there’s more going on.

And let’s be real: if the issue is serious enough to sideline him with only hours’ notice, there’s no way he’s fully recovered in two weeks.

Then there are those *rumors* — reports of a blow-up in the garage, later denied by team sources. Still, that kind of drama doesn’t fit neatly into an ""injury"" narrative. It starts to feel like something deeper is going on.

So, naturally, the speculation starts:

* Has the team finally run out of patience with Lance?
* Are they quietly testing the waters with potential replacements?
* Is this a face-saving way to move him aside — framed around health rather than performance?
* With Aston Martin targeting the front of the grid in 2026, with a Newey designed car, can they really afford to keep a ""passenger"" in that second seat?

Maybe — just maybe — they're finally getting serious about running a true two-car title challenge.

Thoughts and speculation welcome.","[""Might have aggravated his wrist and the pain wasn't tolerable anymore and now he's getting surgery.\xa0"", ""None of your speculation makes sense with the timing of the move.
