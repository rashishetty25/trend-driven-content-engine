1p0ubfl,Christmas 2025 book gifts,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p0ubfl/christmas_2025_book_gifts/,2025-11-19, Discussion,"Hello,

I'm looking for a book or books for my child that would be some kind of encyclopedia, but not too much.
I have seen Buxton's and JL Moncet's but I was wondering if there are other nice to have, even from previous years.
Having the possibility to get it in French is a plus.

Many thanks.","[""I can help! I'm a librarian and we have some F1 books in our kids section. What is the age range we're looking at?"", ""Since Jean-Louis Moncet's ~~memoir~~ (ETA: oops, didn't realize he had another book, but the sample of it looked reasonably similar) is on your list, perhaps you might consider the books from publisher Quarto's Ivy Press imprint's “Formula One” series, even though they might be on the pricier side.\n\nThey have an entire set of coffee table books covering different aspects of F1 historically up through modern-ish times, with lots of photographs. The level of English doesn't seem too complicated, and the mini-essay text pieces aren't that long, and accompanied by plenty of easy picture captions.\n\nThey're written by former F1 journalists including Maurice Hamilton (previously a motor racing correspondent for The Observer newspaper, and now a BBC Radio 5 commentator, according to his bioblurb), Tony Dodgins (previously with Autosport, now an occasional BBC TV commentator), and Frank Hopkinson (former deputy editor of F1 Racing magazine), and come with introductions by figures like Sir Jackie Stewart, Damon Hill, Mark Webber, etc., and include anecdotes as well as facts. There's something like 7 total so far on different topics such as circuits, controversies, and pivotal events. _Formula 1: The Pursuit of Speed_ which seems to be kind of an overview of the sport, but is from 2017 so it may be out of print in paper.\n\nI have the ones for _The Champions: 75 Years of Legendary F1 Drivers_ (also with quotes and vintage interviews; goes from Farina up to Verstappen) from 2025 and _The Rivals: F1's Greatest Duels_ from 2023 (16 chapters going from Fangio vs. Ascari up to Hamilton vs. Verstappen). I got them as ebooks bought during discount sales so I can't comment on the print quality of the paper editions, sorry, but they're pretty nice. You can see samples of the interior text/pictures over at the publisher's website catalogue at Quarto.com via the Google Play previews for the more recently published books.\n\nAlso, _Formula One Racing For Dummies_ by Jonathan Noble (journalist for Motorsport.com and The Race) is available in French translation as _La Formule 1 Pour Les Nuls_ and is reasonably up to date, informative, and easy to read. But very few pictures, mostly sort of line drawing diagrams.\n\nHope this helps!"", 'https://www.redracerbooks.com might be a little young but if they’re learning English it might work.', 'Maybe “Drive to Victory” by Karun Chandhok', ""Almost 11.

The books we have are a little older (I\'m guessing pre-2022) and are thin, but have great pictures. I\'ll grab them tomorrow when I\'m at the library and send you the ISBN. \n\nIt\'s likely that these same books are translated into other languages. I believe they come from a company that puts out a lot of ""About (insert sport here)"" kinds of books, so I\'d assume there is a good market for multiple languages.', ""I wouldn't shy away from a bit more technical books or for older kids, as I was aiming for the 2 books I mentioned earlier, unless better options are up for grabs.\nBut please, carry on with the ISBN. Thanks !"", 'Check out *How to Read F1* by Jennie Gow! I don’t think it’s in French, but the English version uses fairly simple vocabulary and grammar. I’d say it’s about an age 10+ reading level. \n\nEdit: Age 10+ reading level, but I’m 29 and enjoyed it - it’s really more of an all ages read. \n\nIt’s broken down in an A to Z format, covering drivers, technical terms, the history of the sport, different circuits, paddock drama and controversies, all with compelling anecdotes, an enthusiastic tone, and a good bit of humor. There are pictures, diagrams, and “fun fact” blurbs. Examples and metaphors are used to help explain the more technical aspects. \n\nI think it might be the kind of thing you’re looking for. Super informative, hits basically everything you need to know about modern F1 and how we got here, but doesn’t go so in-depth that it would turn off a young reader.']",34,11,0.91,34,9,9,5,0,0.050000000000000044,5
