1hmkuul,Trip to Modena and Maranello,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hmkuul/trip_to_modena_and_maranello/,2024-12-26, Discussion,"Hello, 
My wife and I are planning a trip to the Modena and Maranello museums soon. I know there have been many posts about visiting these museums, but I’m unsure how up-to-date the information is, and I still have a few questions.

1. How do we get from Modena to Maranello and back? We’ll be traveling by train from Bologna to Modena and back. I’ve seen that there’s a shuttle bus on the museum website, but the timetable seems a bit inconvenient. Are there any better options for getting between the two museums? And if there's a bus between them, how do we get the tickets?

2. Can we visit both museums in one day, or would you recommend dedicating a full day to each?

3. I read in another post that someone recommended taking a guide during the visit, but I didn’t see this option when booking tickets online. Is it possible to hire a guide on-site?

4. I’ve never used a simulator before—not even on a PC. Would the F1 simulator experience still be worth it, or would it likely be frustrating since I’m a complete beginner?

5. Are there any must-visit spots near the museums? This could be anything—great places to eat, nice walking areas, or other attractions in the vicinity.

6. Are there any must-buy souvenirs from either museum, or are there better shops nearby?
Is photography allowed in the museums, and are there any specific spots that are particularly great for photos?

Hey everyone,

I’m relatively new to F1 and still learning about the history and culture of the sport. Obviously I know Ferrari is a huge part of F1’s identity. It got me wondering: does driving for Ferrari at some point in a career is necessary for a driver being seen as a 'true"" F1 legend?

Of course, I know there are legendary drivers who never drove for Ferrari, like Ayrton Senna, but so many icons like Schumacher, Lauda, and Vettel and recently Hamilton. 

Id love to hear your thoughts ","['No', 'No, but it certainly helps.\n\nOut of the 10 winningest drivers, only Verstappen so far and Senna will not have driven for Ferrari, while others like Stewart, Clark, Hill, and Hakkinen also managed to have incredible careers and reach legend status without driving for Ferrari.', ""What team you drive for, doesn't dictate your status. What you achieve is the thing that matters most.\n\nI'd argue that a more impressive thing is to achieve success with multiple different teams while facing strong teammates.\n\nBut Ferrari does have an aura that is unmatched by any other team. It doesn't decide if you are a legend or whatever, but I do think driving for Ferrari adds an extra level of aura to your career, which of course isn't particularly important."", 'No, but driving for Ferrari is really special for the drivers themselves and it certainly helps to establish the “legend” status.\n\nEdit: For example, if Lewis never joined Ferrari, he would still be a legend.', 'You already answered your own question by mentioning legendary drivers who never drove for Ferrari.', 'No. Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart are two examples, but there are many others.', 'no', 'No', 'Obviously.

But it’s not about reactions – which is the physical asset which most obviously begins to decline with age.\n\n>We know this because there have been many tests done of F1 driver reactions – and the outcome is completely normal; a range from fast to slow, just as in any control group of non-racing drivers. One of the greatest racing drivers of all time, Michael Schumacher, had notoriously poor reactions when measured.\n\n>“About the same as mine,” related his then-boss Ross Brawn. Dr. Ricardo Ceccarelli, whose Formula Medicine establishment has worked with a high proportion of the F1 grid of the last three decades, has conducted this test as a matter of routine. He says: “The range is completely normal from fast to slow reactions with the group. My secretary actually had one of the best scores.”\n\n>It's not about reactions, it’s about feel. Reactions measure the response time of our central nervous system to a stimulus. Research conducted by defence contractor (and one-time Williams sponsor) QinetiQ to determine physical suitability of candidates for fighter pilot roles found that sensitivity to rotation and yaw (the very things a racing driver is using to feel and balance a car through a corner) came from receptors in our lower spine which pass messages sub-consciously (and therefore instantly, with zero delay) to our middle ear.\n\n>This would seem to suggest that the effectiveness of this neural pathway is what actually differentiates who can feel a car better than someone else and probably therefore how naturally quick they are.\n\nShame the people who only read headlines and smugly make conclusions will likely miss out on it."", ""This is a really great article. As always Mark is one of the few writers who can explain how a driver like Lewis can find lap time, and link that to why the current cars don't work for him. \n\nThe section about the medical tests for reaction time is fascinating. You only have to look at Alonso's performance to see that age won't be a factor for Lewis."", ""I always felt the mark of a great driver is their adaptability.\n\nHamilton has driven in F1 since 2007? That's 18 years by now of competition, regulation changes and team changes and he has been mighty competitive in almost all those years\n\nPerhaps his relative decline is really more a function of age and/or motivation since 2021. It's a bit hard to expect an athlete to remain at his peak forevermore"", '""So, another myth which needs to be put to bed: the ‘fastest driver’.\n\nThere is hardly ever such thing as a definitive ‘fastest driver’. That can be a different driver from one day to the next, depending upon what limitations the car is putting on their respective skill sets. Some drivers have a wider skill set than others – Fernando Alonso springs to mind. But sometimes only at the expense of the peak performance.\n\nBut when a super-skilled driver has a car which rewards his skillset fully, we can invariably see very special things from them and it is this which generally forms the perceptions. Max Verstappen is one such, Lewis Hamilton has been another, Charles Leclerc can do very special things with a car just as he likes it.""\n\nThis bit is so interesting.\n\nSo a potentially good way to ""rank"" drivers would be to see who can have the highest ceiling of performance in a range of car limitations.', 'With the 2026 cars going down a different route, especially with the move back to higher running cars, I do wonder if Lewis might end up being much stronger then, even if Leclerc does convincingly outperform him next year.', 'Yapping', 'It’s almost as though we need to see his times on the track in an actual qualifying session to know for certain..🤔']",0,29,0.43,0,26,26,0,6,0.0,0
