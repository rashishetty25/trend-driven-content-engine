Hey everyone,
I’m trying to find a Formula 1 video I saw on Instagram a while ago and can’t track down again.
It was a really slick edit, the cars were speeding by, and it kept freezing and switching between different teams (like McLaren -Alpine -Ferrari etc.) showing each car for just a moment in a freeze frame before changing to the next.
Then, after all the quick changes, one car breaks out of the freeze frame and drives away. I remember it being done by an ad agency (or maybe the F1 media team) and ending with something along the lines of: “We only had 90 seconds to show all the cars.”
(or something similar: that was the general idea).
​
I’ve tried searching but can’t find it anywhere. Does anyone recognize this video or know who made it?
Thanks in advance!",['https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQNH_EdkRj9/\n\nThis one ?'],0,2,0.29,0,1,1,0,2,0.29,0

1onqpgx,Proposal to make F1 Competitive,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1onqpgx/proposal_to_make_f1_competitive/,2025-11-03, Discussion,"My proposal to make F1 racing more competitive and more enjoyable weekends of racing:

1. Introduce refueling and reduce the tank size to about 1/4 of current size. If gasoline fires and being able to see them are a concern, there are plenty of additives we can put in the fuel to get it to show color. 

2. Offer only 2 tires options for a weekend if Pirelli continues as the main supplier. Those tires must be at least one level softer than previously used and the hard tire must be separated by at least 2 compounds. Have to choose life or deg. 

3. Pit stop crews reduced to 2 jackers, and 4-6 total wheel changers, plus one fuel person. 

4. Clean air aerodynamic drag needs to be reduced. No other racing series has aero issues where the lead car can just pull away. Need to either beef up cooling to avoid the trailing issue or minimize rear wake coming off the cars. It can be done. The teams just don’t want it. 

5. Add additional teams. More cars and more traffic yields more success and more folks in the way. 

6. Front and rear suspensions assemblies cannot be carbon fiber. They need to migrate back to aluminum, titanium, magnesium etc. we want to see wheel to wheel action and carbon is just too restrictive due its composition and being brittle in the wrong directions. 

7. Sprint at every race. What a great COTA weekend with the sprint versus the 3 practices. Quali and races are more enjoyable for fans. 

8. Sprint qualifying should not be based on lap timing. It should be fastest avg speed over 3 laps, or fastest speed on main straight, etc. this could lead to order shake up for the sprint. 

9. Sprints could use a rolling start rather than standing to add a change as well. 

10. Incentivize teams to finish the race by allowing points in all places that competitively finish the race. Try to avoid retirements. 

11. Pirelli needs to make wet weather tires that can race in the rain and f1 needs to solve the spray issues with aero or other tweaks. 

Ok that’s my 83 cents. Feel free to debate. ","['12. sprinkle tracks with water\n\n13. Whoever wins, loses.
