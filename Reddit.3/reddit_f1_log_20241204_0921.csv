A huge setback for the team of Max Verstappen that was still so extremely dominant in 2023. According to Pierre Wache, however, it is not right to point the finger at the team with regard to the difficult season.\n\n>*The winter is coming and so it is time to look back with several prominent figures in Formula 1. During the Qatari Grand Prix we spoke with Pierre Wache, the technical director behind the car of Max Verstappen. Last year the Frenchman was praised, this year he received a lot of criticism because Red Bull Racing suddenly had a dominant car during the 2024. How was it for Wache to suddenly rarely win and did the totally dominant season of 2023 actually work as a ‘nithi for’ in 2024?*\n\n>“We are here to do our job as best we can and it’s very annoying if we don’t win a race. Everyone in the paddock, I think, I have this vision in mind. We\'re all here to win. The last, successful season does not help us, since it is extremely difficult to win. Also internally it does not help that you win so much, since there are also many young people who also come into the team and they are actually only used to winning.""\n\n>“This will eliminate the sense of those people of how exceptional it is to win one race at all, let alone a championship. People forget that after such a season when we had in 2023 it is terribly difficult to continue to win races. Just ask Max Verstappen, he also knows how difficult it is to win in all those years. He won a number of races in 2016, but in 2021 came the title until 2021, which shows how difficult it is,” said Wache, who would like to clarify that after all these years in Formula 1 he still realizes how unique it is to win in the premier class of motorsport.\n\n>“Every good thing has to be right to win in Formula 1, everything has to be well tuned to make it possible. You also have to be a bit lucky and you also have to have a good police performance, haha (Wache refers to the stewards as being police, ed.). The problem of winning so much is that the police will pay even more attention to you, especially in relation to how much you look at the rest. That\'s how it works. It is like with brothers in a family, the smallest brother can do more because he is less followed"", laughs the always sympathetic Wache, but at the same time an important point seems to have been touched upon in his opinion. \n\n>Limit\n\n>*This year there was a lot of fuss about, shall we say, \'the gray area\' of the regulations. Do you think that will be the case again next year?*\n\n>""These cars are difficult to develop further. There are always gray areas, but that also appeals to you as an engineer. But if you look at McLaren\'s rear wing, sorry, but that is more than operating in a gray area. They have ""We also use that wing for several races, right? Without that rear wing earlier this season, they wouldn\'t win in Baku, for example, and if you put that together, the constructors\' championship would now look very different.""\n\n>*Is that just frustrating or also interesting, since you are also an engineer and are looking to improve the car?*\n\n>""I cannot deny the interestingness of it, but as an engineer you also have to respect the rules. The difference between the technical regulations and the sporting regulations is that with the technical regulations you have to prove that you are doing it according to the rules. With the sporting regulations it is the other way around. It is the reverse of, for example, a speed measurement by the police, where they can only estimate your speed at one point, but do not see the rest. With the technical regulations you have to show that you are fits well, because everything visible.""\n\n>*However, isn\'t the gray area also part of the game?*\n\n>""Yes, of course it\'s part of the game, but at the same time there are limits. If the police don\'t see it, it doesn\'t mean it\'s legal. Look at what happened in the past at Ferrari, for example, that\'s more than pushing the limits. It is therefore frustrating for us when the police do not do their work.""\n\n>*So you clearly have the feeling that other teams went over the limit too often this year?*\n\n>""Yes, quite a bit over the limit indeed. However, at a certain point it is what it is and that is the playing field on which it is played. If you have a good idea, you have a good idea, but when you go outside the playing field is simply not correct,"" Wache said clearly.\n\n>During the season the FIA \u200b\u200bintervened a number of times, for example by issuing new technical guidelines. However, given the competition between the four top teams that will undoubtedly continue in 2025, the FIA \u200b\u200bwill be able to prepare for an interesting 2025 season.\n\n>After the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the remaining articles of the interview with Pierre Wache will be online on RacingNews365.', ""Yes, Ferrari would be first.

It was a premature end to the relationship between the Enstone team and the Frenchman, who contested his final Grand Prix at Losail on Sunday. Although he had only just retired, the rumour was circulating before it was confirmed and then made official: Jack Doohan will take his place from next weekend at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the 2024 season.\n\nAccording to sources close to the team, everything happened very quickly, just a few hours before the start of the Qatar Grand Prix, when Flavio Briatore called Esteban Ocon into his office. The Alpine chief advisor told him that he would not release him for the season-ending test with Haas unless he gave up his seat early.\n\nHowever, the director of the Frenchman's future team, Ayao Komatsu, had already indicated at Interlagos that an agreement had been reached. However, Alpine never officially confirmed the news, postponing it until Esteban Ocon was presented with the conditions, he would have to accept to ratify it.\n\nWith preparations already underway for those tests, which will take place at Yas Marina next week following the final Grand Prix of the season, the Frenchman decided not to give up, even if it meant missing out on a proper farewell to Alpine, as was a priori planned for the final race of the championship.\n\nEsteban Ocon, for example, had planned to wear a special helmet at this final Grand Prix in honour of the team whose colours he has defended for the past five years. In the end, however, his relationship with the team ended abruptly in Losail on Sunday, in the very first corner, after a collision with Franco Colapinto that he could do nothing about.\n\nEsteban Ocon's early departure means that Alpine will be able to give Jack Doohan his racing debut before next season, against a backdrop of speculation that Flavio Briatore is genuinely interested in Franco Colapinto.\n\nWe know that the Australian rookie was evaluated in more detail a few weeks ago during a test session to which Pierre Gasly was invited to establish a benchmark. Sources in the paddock suggest that he was close to the times set by the Frenchman, who will be the natural leader of the Alpine in 2025.\n\n**“This is not the way I wanted it to end.”**\n\nThis evening, Esteban Ocon gave his first reaction to the issue, writing on social networks:\n\n>*First of all, I would like to thank the mechanics and engineers working on all the functions at the circuit, at Enstone and at Viry-Châtillon who have raced alongside me over the last five seasons. We have shared so much together, and I am proud to call many of you, my friends.*\n\n>*I leave Alpine/Renault with great memories and the pride of having been the driver with the team's best results since returning to the sport, taking the top two podium places in Bahrain, Hungary, and Brazil. It was also an honour to contribute to fourth place in the constructors' championship in 2022. I know how much all those moments meant to everyone and it is that sense of achievement and joy alongside the team that I take with me.*\n\n>*It has not been an easy year for the team and the second half of the season was particularly difficult.
