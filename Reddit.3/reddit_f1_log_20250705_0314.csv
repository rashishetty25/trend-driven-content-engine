Here‚Äôs a quick visual of how much things changed between the first and second practice sessions at Silverstone.

The track really came alive for FP2, leading to a massive shuffle in the competitive order. It looks like it could be anyone's guess who has the upper hand for qualifying tomorrow.

1lrzgz4,A take on what's happening with the Redbull car,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lrzgz4/a_take_on_whats_happening_with_the_redbull_car/,2025-07-05, Discussion,"Redbull has been suffering a lot for the past year now and problems starting emerging mid 2023.  
  
Thus the reason I believe this is happening in the first place is cos of the 2023 season itself(partially), because of how fast they were, it was a p1 p2 in the drivers standings and the most dominating season of all time by both driver and constructor. It gave them the idea that their car is awesome the way it is (wouldn't blame them) and they need to go further in that direction, little did they know they were almost on a threshold and reached that threshold by miami last year, right when mclaren took up.

Both Max and Checo apparently said that the car is hard to drive ig somewhere along the 23 season, and by mid 24 it was undriveable.

Now here's my take on what's happening with Max : 

Max is able to drive it cos he's a great driver ofcourse, but also because he's been through the entire development phase of it from decent to good, from driveable to undriveable, from soft to sharp whatever it is.

Like Albon once explained it, imagine there's a sensitivity setting and as the year goes on it gets sharper and sharper on the nose cos max loves it that way. Ofcourse that's not all but I believe its not just throughout a year. Let's say you set it at say 40 or something, then keep increasing it by 5 every year, by year 10 itll be fucking 90, and that's pretty much what i believe is what has happened here, people can drive it a bit at say 70 or 80, but 90+ is just too fucking much and sometimes even max will find it difficult cos it reaches 95+. This is all ofcourse from a layman's perspective but max really is the only driver in the world who can drive the car, max is completely used to this car and its antics, as he's spent his entire career here.

TL;DR : Redbull is going in a poor direction and max is the only driver who can drive it cos he's been through the entire development phase of the car apart from him being a great driver.","[""With all due respect, that's nothing that isn't said a thousand times every weekend here."", ""> TL;DR : Redbull is going in a poor direction and max is the only driver who can drive it cos he's been through the entire development phase of the car apart from him being a great driver.\n\nCool story bro"", ""let's just say a certain key engineer is now working at McLaren and is the Chief Designer of the McLaren MCL39"", 'This feels like every past story on the same topic just rewritten', 'Much also has to do with key talent leaving late 23- into 2024, such as Newey and Courtenay', ""Car was working a lot better up until China last year then it has had the chronic won't turn properly.""]",0,8,0.27,0,6,6,0,8,0.27,0
