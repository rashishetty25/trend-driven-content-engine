With Interlagos on the calendar this weekend, I’ve been feeling a bit nostalgic. I went back through the history of Formula One season finales since 1990, and it reminded me how much the end of the year used to feel different.

1985 - 1995: Australia (Adelaide) closed the season

1996 - 1999: Japan (Suzuka or Jerez in ’97)

2000 - 2005: Mostly Japan or Malaysia/China

2004 - 2008: Brazil’s Interlagos - the golden run of finales

2009 - 2025: Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina Circuit has taken over ever since


For me, Interlagos just has something no other circuit can replicate. The atmosphere is electric, the weather unpredictable, and the fans make it feel like the whole sport’s heartbeat is right there in São Paulo. Those finales gave us so many iconic moments - Raikkonen’s 2007 title shock, Hamilton’s 2008 “Is that Glock?!” drama, Vettel’s 2012 charge through the field.

Abu Dhabi has its glamour, but Interlagos always delivered chaos, emotion and pure racing theatre. I sometimes wonder if my fondness for it is just nostalgia - because so many emotional memories are tied to it being the last race - or if it’s genuinely the perfect place to end a season. It's just such a great track in any case.  

What do you all think?
Do any of you miss Interlagos as the finale, or has Abu Dhabi earned its place?","['Absolutely: Interlagos is a great track with tremendous atmosphere, Yas Marina is a terrible circuit with no atmosphere. It reflects so badly on F1.', ""2016 would have been a lot more interesting with Hamilton slowing down in sector 3 and Rosberg having to pray Vettel of Verstappen didn't try any unconvential overtaking spots.\n\nInterlagos was the perfect ending and instead they replaced it with a track that perfectly represents the FIA."", 'I am biased but I would rather have the gran finale in a tradicional circuit rather than those petro ones.

It was a disastrous day for Williams as both drivers, David Coulthard and Damon Hill, spun out. Hill’s race went from bad to worse when he slid into the gravel while attempting to return to the pits to serve a stop-go penalty for speeding. Just recently, Hill had signed a £5 million contract with Williams for 1996, but rumours were already surfacing that Frank Williams was reconsidering. Reflecting on his season, Hill admitted, “I’ve never felt this bad. I’ve made mistakes this season, I can’t deny that. Just when you think it can’t get worse, it does.The McLaren of Mika Hakkinen came home in second, with Schumacher’s teammate, Johnny Herbert, finishing in third.

This is the first season in at least a decade where two drivers on the same team were consistently in the running for the WDC.  In previous years, it was clear that either Max or Lewis was going to win, so even if their teammate could beat them in a race, it makes sense that the team would want to hold them back to avoid jeopardizing the title. 

In this case, in contrast, there isn't an obvious frontrunner - it's been relatively close all season, and they are now within one point of each other. 

I see a lot of talk about Papaya rules, so I am curious how Mercedes and Red Bull (and I guess Ferrari, not that they've been in contention recently) would handle this.

Something happened before or during the Baku weekend. After that he's just not been so competitive as he was as he's finishing in the top 5 but not on the podium.\n\nIt can't be confidence. Maybe it's the track but even this doesn't make sense as after Australia, he came across varying tracks. It has to do something about his comfort level in the McLaren but then McLaren haven't brought any big updates too.\n\nIt's baffling to see this slump because till Baku I thought Piastri will win it over easily over Norris due to his strong mind & cool temperament."", 'When Lando fucked up a few times earlier in the season, we called him a choker. \n\nOscar is doing the same now, he’s a choker.

1oiv4k6,Hamilton’s Ferrari Struggles Mirror Vettel’s 2020 Decline,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oiv4k6/hamiltons_ferrari_struggles_mirror_vettels_2020/,2025-10-29, Discussion,"No disrespect to Lewis, but his situation right now is like that of Vettel in 2020 and both battle to even get on the podium and Leclerc is out-qualifying and out-racing both. Lewis's record against Leclerc existed below Vettel's achievement against Leclerc in 2020.

His interviews are negative and resigned after every race. The SF25 has taken a step backward from the SF24, but it's still not as disastrous as the SF1000 had been when Vettel had been forced to spend his final season at Ferrari in 2020. And let us not forget, Leclerc is no easy teammate; Vettel's form went off a cliff after those two years, and he often fell behind Stroll.

Should Lewis choose to continue past 2026, the same attern may well unfold with the Britton","['I think Lewis suffered with overinflated expectations compared to what was realistic for him.\n\nCharles is a fantastic driver and in most people’s top 3 on the grid, and time waits for no man, even Lewis Hamilton, so there’s no shame in being slightly slower at this stage in his career.\n\nHe had a slump mid-season but early on and in the past few races he’s been right where Ferrari want him and where Carlos was last season, slightly slower than Leclerc but nowhere near the gap that Tsunoda or Antonelli have to their teammates.\n\nAnd Ferrari still could get P2 in the WDC which would reflect really well on the drivers considering the car they have to work with.', ""nah. lewis is slower but in qualy it's a tenth or two since the rear suspension came and in race it's like 2-3 tenths in clean air. not as bad as vettel for sure"", ""After wasting Kimi, Seb, years off Charles' career and now Lewis, it's absolutely bonkers to me that people still suggest that it isn't the team's fault.\n\nNone of these drivers forgot how to drive. The team refuses to listen to criticism because of dumb politics and egos. That is all."", 'Bad comparison.\n\nLewis is actually improving the gap between him and a prime Leclerc rather than declining as the season goes - you only need to look at the stats', ""I don't agree at all.\n\nHamilton's form has been steadily improving. He's also fresh into the team (although of course we are late into the season now) with his teammate in his 7th year with the team.\n\nVettel's form, I can't precisely recall. But 2020 was his 5th year at the team, with his teammate only on his 2nd year and his 3rd year in F1.\n\nSo I would say actually the situation is the polar opposite of Vettel vs Leclerc, although there may be similar results and attitudes."", 'I’ve been fairly impressed with Lewis if I’m honest. Like Sainz he seems to be progressively improving and getting closer his team mate as he gets to grips with the car. \n\nAlonso is still kicking around so no reason Lewis can’t still be very competitive. \n\nIf Ferrari has a dominant car next year. I think Lewis may even stand a chance of a championship as I’m not sure if Charles can stay consistent under the type of pressure a championship brings.', 'At least Vettel could get a podium.\n\nAnd that was in the 6th or 7th fastest car, not the 2nd or 3rd fastest car.', ""2020 Seb was a result of an awful divorce. His lack of performance was further fueled by Ferrari's incompetence and politics reaching the lowest ceiling of each parties. Lewis is still far from that."", 'i think if ferrari is fast enough in 2026 he will fight for wins\n\nmight as well compete for the wdc for some races\n\nbut winning it seems unlikely', ""I'll be interested to see how he goes next year when the regs are more similar to 2014-2021 than 2022-2025 in terms of aero. It'll be his second year with the team as well. He has enough credit in the bank as one of the all-time greats that I'm not writing him off yet.""]",0,41,0.26,0,37,37,0,1,0.020000000000000018,0
