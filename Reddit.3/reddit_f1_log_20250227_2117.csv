Martin gives clear reasoning behind his retirements and more detailed information about what his race plan was, whereas all the other drivers would barely give an answer. Instead of just saying, ""Gearbox"" for example, Martin would go in to more specifics and use a way of words that he does now I'm his commentary work; ""The gearbox had enough basically. First I lost 2nd and 3rd gear, then 5th and 6th so I had to stay in 4th and try and make the end, but unfortunately it turned in to a bag of nuts and bolts very quickly which sent me home early"".

Listening to him during this time it is clear he knows a lot about how grand prix cars worked and delivered that knowledge to those listening to him in a very approachable way.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.
