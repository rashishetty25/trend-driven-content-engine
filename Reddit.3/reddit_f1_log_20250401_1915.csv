The octogenarian uses this platform to discuss the latest news in motorsports, particularly concerning the Austrian Formula 1 team. His most recent column focused on Yuki Tsunoda’s promotion to the main Red Bull team and Liam Lawson’s demotion to Racing Bulls. However, the former F1 driver also took the opportunity to commend the team’s newcomer, French driver Isack Hadjar.\n\nDuring the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Marko’s comments about Hadjar’s mistake on the formation lap—which forced him to retire—sparked controversy in the media. ""Hadjar put on a show with his tears,"" the 81-year-old had remarked about the young French driver’s visible disappointment after his difficult F1 debut.\n\nMarko’s harsh words led to strong reactions, with many criticizing the Austrian for his lack of empathy. However, the situation has since calmed down, and Hadjar himself was quick to defend him. ""Even I found it embarrassing,"" the French driver admitted regarding his own reaction.

I know how he operates.""\n\nA Strong Comeback in China\n\nAt the second race of the season, the Chinese Grand Prix, the Parisian rookie quickly turned his disappointment into success. After an impressive qualifying performance, securing 7th place and beating his teammate by half a second on a track he had never raced on before, Hadjar demonstrated his potential. While his race pace was strong, his final result on Sunday was compromised by his team’s strategic choices.\n\nMarko acknowledged Hadjar’s impressive performance in his column, shifting from criticism to praise.\n\n""Isack Hadjar handled his Melbourne setback well, even though he was already surprisingly strong in qualifying. Without that failed strategy, he would have certainly scored his first points in China. For me, Isack is one of the surprises of this first part of the season,"" the Austrian leader admitted. ""He didn’t know the Shanghai circuit, yet he was driving at the same level as Yuki, which I find very impressive.""\n\nTo continue earning praise from the demanding Helmut Marko, Isack Hadjar will need to maintain his momentum at the third race of the season in Japan.
