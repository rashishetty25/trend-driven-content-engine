1j4trr4,The 'risky' McLaren F1 2025 choice that caught Red Bull's eye,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j4trr4/the_risky_mclaren_f1_2025_choice_that_caught_red/,2025-03-06, News,,"['Well this explains one reason for their improved slow corner performance compared to last year, at least during preseason testing. The front suspension of an F1 car is designed to keep the car stable under braking. One way teams achieve this is by using an “anti-dive” suspension layout (like in the MCL39), which reduces how much the car’s nose dips forward during braking. But this design choice comes with a trade-off. In a normal suspension setup, the forces from braking and cornering are spread out more evenly across the suspension components. Whereas with an anti-dive layout, certain parts of the suspension (higher-up) take on much greater forces because they are working harder to resist that forward movement of the car. This puts more stress on the components and the only way to make this design reliable is to use stronger materials potentially making it a bulkier setup.', '> In fact, Red Bull technical director Pierre Wache made an eyebrow-raising observation in Bahrain - in suggesting that McLaren may have taken a bit of a gamble with its front suspension.\n\n> Speaking to The Race, Wache said: “The suspension of the McLaren is very interesting – in terms of kinematics. And one aspect is the anti-dive. It is very high.\n\n> ""It is quite a risky kinematic for me. If they can make it work, it will be interesting.”\n\n> Asked what he meant by it being risky, Wache said: “In terms of the load on the suspension legs and everything.”\n\nThe Race then proceeds to explain what Pierre means in detail, key takeaway:\n\n> And it is this layout that Wache thinks could pose some risks – with the anti-dive layout perhaps exposing the individual suspension components to much greater structural forces than a more normal suspension layout would have.\n\n> This could pose headaches in terms of opening up potential reliability problems, but also perhaps require compromises in needing to bulk up individual components to make sure they are strong enough. That has weight consequences.', ""The question of suspension kinematics has something to do with structural integrity, but the biggest concern is driver feedback, wasn't it?"", 'So.... Something something car loses front wheels at the end of straight....\n\nPierre knows something about that I think.', 'I suppose I would trust the McLaren engineers who designed it and presumably tested it, over the Red Bull ones who simply got to look at it, but… we will see how it works out! The McLaren looked lightning fast in testing, hopefully reliability doesn’t take a step back.', 'That MCL38 vs MCL39 dissected comparison would make an amazing interactive compare view thing where you have the slider to drag back and forth over the car. Love the art they do every time.', ""If there's one team I'd put my money on understanding composites and their ability to take dynamic forces well, it would be the team that introduced the first carbon fiber F1 chassis and 'mini-DRS'. Even if it's risky, you don't win in F1 by playing safe."", 'Ngl the angle of that drawing makes it look like a tractor.', 'I feel like all of these suspension changes are to keep the ride height as predictable as possible. As soon as the floor gets out of whack that’s when you see all of the handling issues. I’d assume if you can keep the front of the car more level. You will generate more consistent downforce from the floor so whatever you lose by the aggressive anti-dive you benefit from the floor.

Lewis also worked well with a younger driver aka George. \n\nI think similar to George and Lewis this relationship will be drama free irrespective of who beats whom. Obviously if there is direct championship competition then all gloves go off.\n\n> Vasseur told Corriere della Sera: “In the last two years we have witnessed a competition between teammates from free practice, to qualifying [and] to the race. We have to make sure it is still like this – it is important to make progress. Be careful, I am not talking about fighting, but about competition.

In addition, the new regulations stipulate that the two official drivers can complete a maximum of 1,000 kilometers accumulated in four days of testing, while the rest of the days can be taken advantage of with reserve or dedicated simulator drivers.\n\nFor Zhou, who was previously part of the Ferrari Driver Academy from 2014 to 2018 before following a different path, this is an opportunity to accumulate kilometers in preparation for the work he will have to do in the simulator during the season. The Chinese driver has taken part in 3 seasons in F1 with Sauber, the last of which was completed last year: for the Rossa it represents a good solution to have a driver with some experience behind the scenes on the ground effect cars, while for Zhou it is a chance to remain linked to the paddock of the top series, which he did not want to leave despite offers from other categories.\n\nAlong with Zhou, Antonio Fuoco has also been running, with the Italian driver remaining active on the Cavallino simulator on the F1 front as well because of his qualities and experience, complementing his activities behind the wheel of the 499P Hypercar in the WEC, where he recently scored a splendid victory in the season's opening round in Qatar."", 'I’d take Zhou getting another chance in F1 over Mick', 'Only car to have ever beaten the RB19', 'Zhou - Holy shit the car actually turns and brakes when I want it to.', '""So this is what a *fast* car feels like"" - Zhou, probably', ""not sure it was Zhou not wanting to leave as much as Zhou's sponsors saying he couldn't leave""]",240,12,0.97,240,10,10,68,1,0.010000000000000009,68

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

I’m (M35) planning to attend the Japanese Grand Prix this year and looking for accommodation options. Does anyone have recommendations for hotels near Suzuka or in a convenient area with good transport links to the circuit?

Alternatively, if anyone has an Airbnb booked and is looking for someone to share costs, I’d be interested! Open to splitting a place if others are in the same situation.

Let me know if you have any tips or are looking for a roommate! Cheers!","['You should ask in r/GrandPrixTravel', ""Leaving booking a hotel/Airbnb/Ryokan pretty late - you're going to be hard pressed finding anything close to the circuit now.\n\nYou'd be best off staying in Nagoya and taking the train to Suzuka circuit each day."", 'Plenty of accomodation in Nagoya.
