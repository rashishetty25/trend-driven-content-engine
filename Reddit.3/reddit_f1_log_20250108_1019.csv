Bishop thinks the answer a very small core team working with him to keep him focused and so improve consistency. That‚Äôs potentially true, but Gasly‚Äôs always seemed to be lightning focused when the car is capable of achieving - like 2020, 2021, the end of 2024 - but doesn‚Äôt seem to focus as much during fallow periods like 2022 and early 2024. \n\n>I do not know Pierre Gasly at all well, but I have had a few short chats with him over the years, and I have enjoyed them all. In the Miami paddock in 2022, when I was Aston Martin‚Äôs comms chief, by mistake he entered our paddock hospitality building instead of AlphaTauri‚Äôs, which was next-door to ours.
