But I wonder what he means by distracted. Like, not paying attention to details while in the car, or distracted by focusing on competing with his teammate and not enough on his own progress, or by things completely outside of F1?\n\n>A senior F1 engineer who has worked with Gasly recently, but who has asked me not to name him in this column, tells me that Pierre “has always been likeable, has a good brain, cares about his role in the team and wants to play it well, is sometimes every bit as quick as the greats, but can be too easily distracted and therefore suffers from a surprising degree of inconsistency”.', '>A senior F1 engineer who has worked with Gasly recently, but who has asked me not to name him in this column, tells me that Pierre “has always been likeable, has a good brain, cares about his role in the team and wants to play it well, is sometimes every bit as quick as the greats, but can be too easily distracted and therefore suffers from a surprising degree of inconsistency”. \n\nFor anybody wondering. Bishop thinks the answer a very small core team working with him to keep him focused and so improve consistency. That’s potentially true, but Gasly’s always seemed to be lightning focused when the car is capable of achieving - like 2020, 2021, the end of 2024 - but doesn’t seem to focus as much during fallow periods like 2022 and early 2024. \n\n>I do not know Pierre Gasly at all well, but I have had a few short chats with him over the years, and I have enjoyed them all. In the Miami paddock in 2022, when I was Aston Martin’s comms chief, by mistake he entered our paddock hospitality building instead of AlphaTauri’s, which was next-door to ours. Realising his mistake, he stopped abruptly, performed an about-turn, smiled broadly, then apologised to me, since I was the Aston Martin team member standing closest to him at the time.\n\n\n>“Well, not yet, Pierre,” I said, “but maybe, yes, maybe, you might one day join our team?”\n\n\n>He beamed luminously and replied, “Yes, why not?”\n\nGuy wanted out of Alpha Tauri bad LMAO', 'Sitting in a good car 😅😂', ""TLDR: He has been very fast but not consistent, if he consistently beats Doohan, and Alpine gives him a podium level car, he might take Hamilton's or Alonso's\\* seat in future and have a proper tilt at the top.\n\nAlso has that marko quote about if he had tried to slowly close the gap to Verstappen instead of try everything possible to beat him, he'd not have lost his seat.\n\n\\*Writer assumes Newey will deliver a race winning car by the time Alonso is ready to leave. A few problems with that assumption in a few different directions."", 'TL;DR:  \nConsistency could help Gasly attract a big team offer.', 'Basically the article says once he becomes more predictable he will be sought after by big teams. Probably.\n\nHe’s looking better than a lot of the midfielders. I can see him being on par with Piastri or Sainz in a similar car. Lots of rookies coming in, and he is one of few who have a reputation of improving the team.', ""The article ends saying that maybe he'll end up in a Newey created Aston Martin one day after Fernando retires."", 'Have people seen his girlfriend, Kika? No wonder the guy is distracted with consistency issues, it\'s a miracle he shows up on Sundays.\n\nOn a more serious note, I think Gasly has more talent than he shows, not sure what it would take to bring it out of him, but I remember being a fan of his at Toro Rosso.\n\nI didn\'t love the way RedBull treated him when he got his shot, it felt like they weren\'t prepared to deal with a guy with potential who just needed more reassurance after Danny left, so they just ran him into the ground and he lacked confidence. \n\nJust keep remember his engineer yelling, ""Pierre, you\'ve got to speed up, you\'re going too slow!""']",0,37,0.4,0,32,32,0,2,-0.03999999999999998,0
