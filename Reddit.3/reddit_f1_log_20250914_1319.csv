1ng8aln,[OC] F1 Media Driver Ratings for the 2025 Italian Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ng8aln/oc_f1_media_driver_ratings_for_the_2025_italian/,2025-09-13, Discussion,"Here’s how major F1 media outlets have rated drivers throughout the season so far, up to the 2025 Italian Grand Prix, vs their current championship standings.

•⁠ ⁠Cumulative season ratings are calculated by averaging each outlet’s scores across all races.

•⁠ The last column compares the average rating position vs the championship standing (or the race result in the second table).

•⁠ ⁠Average finishing position excludes DNF, DNS, and DSQs.

•⁠ ⁠For ""P1 w/ Matt & Tommy"", the values are the average of Matt & Tommy’s individual scores.
