I don't remember much about the paddock discussions about him in the early 2010s, but it seems kinda strange that he only raced for midfield teams, even when he was having good races and moments (like Brazil 2010 or 2012), and he is a very solid driver even today","[""If I'm remembering correctly, he was under consideration at Mercedes in both 2012 and 2016/2017 (after Rosberg's retirement). Hamilton was snapped up instead of H√ºlkenberg for the first, and he had just signed a contract with Renault for the second and he wasn't able to escape it. He was also under consideration to replace Albon at Red Bull, but P√©rez's money and performance in 2020 was too good to pass up.\n\nI think he was also under consideration for a Ferrari seat in the early 2010s, but I can't remember why that fell through.\n\nIt's basically him being a victim of circumstance."", 'He almost signed for Mercedes in 2013 before Lewis went there.

He's proven *very* thoroughly that he's about as good as Perez all things considered, which means he could have been picked up to be a 2nd driver by a big team and done fine, but he missed out on it (with Mercedes) due to sheer bad luck.\n\nAnd after 2019 and his thorough beating by Ricciardo, which was somehow the very first time he's faced an established top driver as a teammate all hope to get picked up by a leading team was gone."", 'Because Danny Ric was faster.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nAnd Im not even picking on the Hulk here.

His best effort was Interlagos 2012, which he fucked up all by himself.\n\nIf you look down the grid, just about everyone has posted a huge result in a shitbox.

1kzdi10,[AMuS] The big wing quake doesn't happen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kzdi10/amus_the_big_wing_quake_doesnt_happen/,2025-05-30, News,,"[""Yeah, it hasn't shuffled the field that much, but long stint pace are not conclusive (as in article), race will give us better picture i think."", 'Translation:\n\n> **The race for the world championship title remains tight between Max Verstappen and the two McLaren drivers. The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t rocked the Formula 1 world. Mercedes and Ferrari have moved somewhat closer.**\n\n> We don\'t need to rewrite the Formula 1 World Championship. The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t upset the balance of power between the teams. McLaren is still ahead, both on a single lap and in the long run. Max Verstappen is close. This has to do with the fact that Barcelona is a Red Bull track. The hope that stiffer front wings would upset the balance of the papaya racers was not fulfilled.\n\n> Mercedes has rediscovered its form from the first six races. But only for one lap. During the long run, the tires overheated. Ferrari delivered a solid performance. The gap to the leaders was half a second, slightly less than last time.\n\n> In the midfield, Aston Martin performed well on a single lap and Alpine on the long run. Toro Rosso showed the most balance. Their speed is good both on a single lap and over the distance.\n\n> Sauber has made a noticeable leap forward with its new aero package. Nico H√ºlkenberg\'s strong endurance run underscores that the Sauber has become more predictable. Williams, as expected, is struggling. The car doesn\'t thrive in the long corners. Haas had the same problem and plummeted to the bottom of the standings.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n> **1) Has the new front wing rule shuffled the field?**\nNot at all. On one lap, McLaren is ahead of Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Alpine, Toro Rosso, Sauber, Williams, and Haas. That\'s almost normal. Aston Martin looks slightly better than recently, Williams slightly worse. That depends on the track. Sauber and Alpine have made a leap with their upgrades. Haas adjusted the setup in the wrong direction after a strong first practice. On one lap, Mercedes is a pole position contender. But the Silver Arrows suffered a setback in the long run.\n\n> **2) Who has the fastest car in the long run?**\nWhen comparing the long runs, much depends on the time in the second practice session they were completed and the distance they covered. George Russell drove the longest stint on soft tires with 16 laps. Piastri was the marathon man on the medium tires with 14 laps. We only count the fast laps without cool-down periods or time lost due to traffic. The length of the race simulation logically puts pressure on the lap times. This is why Russell and Norris are far down in the standings.\n\n> Max Verstappen and Lando Norris are difficult to compare. Both completed a long run on the soft and medium tires, but at different times. Verstappen started on the medium and then switched to the soft. Norris did the opposite. Therefore, the world champion was faster in the soft long run, while Norris was faster in the medium endurance run. The difference was three to four tenths per lap. Taking the weight factor into account, it\'s a close race. The second stint was obviously helped by the fact that there was less fuel in the tank at the end.\n\n> The Ferrari drivers split their time in sync. First medium, then soft. Lewis Hamilton leads the soft long runs. However, he only completed three hot laps on the set. Oscar Piastri took the fastest time of the day, but suffered a setback in the endurance run. In 14 laps on the medium tires, the Australian only managed an average of 1:20.966 minutes. ""Things didn\'t go well in the first practice session. It wasn\'t until the second that we slowly found our way back to form,"" he said.\n\n> **3) Ferrari: Good or Evil?\nAfter the first practice session, Ferrari\'s faces were relaxed. Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc finished third and fourth, surprising even themselves. Barcelona hasn\'t exactly been one of the red cars\' signature tracks in the past. In the afternoon, with temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius in the shade, the corners of their mouths drooped again. Leclerc slipped to fifth place, half a second off Piastri\'s fastest time.\n\n> Hamilton, finishing eleventh, didn\'t even make the top ten. The Englishman complained about the car\'s balance. ""It was a confusing day with good and bad moments. But I think the final setup changes on Saturday should help us."" Leclerc expressed his positive surprise: ""It was a positive day. In the heat, everyone has less grip. That\'s why it\'s difficult to assess the cars\' true potential. But I feel like we still have something up our sleeve with our car.""\n\n(1/2)', 'While I agree the flexi wing clampdown won‚Äôt have much impact on the overall running order, I do think it‚Äôs a bit premature to say ‚Äúnothings changed‚Äù when we‚Äôve only seen 2 practice sessions. We all know Friday practice sessions can be unrepresentative.', ""Mclaren won by 30-40 seconds in Miami, that advantage isn't just a front wing difference."", 'We‚Äôll see after the race how things play out, too early to draw any conclusions. Although really you‚Äôd need multiple race weekends.\xa0', ""I mean Friday isn't exactly a solid representation.  We gotta keep in mind most qualifying Saturdays have generally been decided by a thenth or less.  A front wing could very well be the difference in that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI understand qualifying isn't race trim, but who knows.  I will admit a front wing isn't going to be the sole decider in shaking up the grid, but if teams were using older-spec wings for the first 8 races it should show *some* impact."", 'Non flexible wings don\'t make cars slower over a couple of laps. \n\nThe cars will be as fast as usual for 1 or 5 laps. \n It will hurt their tyre usages on long stints as they have to choose between beeing fast in the straight or have more downforce in the corners. \n\nResulting in beeing slower on a straight to keep the cornering speed or using up more of your tyres in the corners to go fast on the straight. \n\nWe will find out if anything happened in the pecking order on Sunday during the race at the earliest. \n\nIn FP2 Norris drove 3 laps on the medium at average 1.18s while Verstappen was doing 1.20.0 avarage with the same tyre but more laps and Piastri was doing 1.20.8 avarage with more laps. \n\nPiastri and Verstappen (and others) are also capable of driving 1.18s a lap for 4 or 5 laps and then the tyres might be done and they would have to continue with 1.22 laps. And nobody knows how much fuel they had in the car and what the "" simulation"" setting for the long run where. \n\nIf we tell Piastri to drive 1.20.8 s for 10 laps because we expect during the race to do that for 31 laps and Verstappen was told to do 1.20.0 because they anticipate to use that tire for no more then 25 laps in the race. \n And then they come back in and look at the tyre degradation and see that drivers were going too fast to have the tyres last their anticipated length or they find out they could have gone even quicker. \n\n\nLong story short. It is practice, other then cars looking stable or unstable on track there is nothing serious that spectators can learn from it.', 'It was practice.

I'd understand if it was within the same reg cycle like ground effect but this spans wide body hybrids and ground effect. Surely the rule set changes enough so the cars have different characteristics which will suit different tracks? Or is it something about design philosophy like how the 2023 and 2024 williams prioritised top speed?","['It‚Äôs less about regulations and more about team design philosophy. \n\nFor the past‚Ä¶ 10 years or so, Williams main design philosophy has been ‚Äòtop speed‚Äô. They fell into that by default of their new Mercedes engines when the 2014 regs came in and saved Claire‚Äôs ass, and they kept philosophy since: Make the car stable and fast in a straight line at the expense of cornering and responsiveness. \n\nThis was especially prominent during the dark years between 2018-21 when Monza and Mexico were basically Williams‚Äô only legitimate chance at points barring something crazy happening like Germany 2019. \n\nNow with Dorilton as the owners and James as the TP, the design philosophy is changing with the culture.

All these cars made a big step with upgrades, but till then werent exactly remarkable', 'Im not too sure but I have a feel it has to do with the Williams design philosophy across all regs and they always make a car based to their expertise which they know best even if it makes them vulnerable and certain tracks', 'Watching an interview with Vowles at the moment - Rosberg pointed out that the Williams‚Äô weaknesses here are aerodynamics and prolonged corners.', 'just to add what was mentioned already in other comments, I remember James Allison talking about new rules and how teams go into working on them and he basically said that teams never start from scratch, they take their current car and say for example the new rule is changing the front wing width, so they take the current car with their latest data and simulation and change that car‚Äôs wing width then see how different the data is and it affected the car then identify the negatives and positives of that change and then start working on fixing the negative outcome but all is happening on the current car because basically they own so much of valuable data to throw it away. In that context, it‚Äôs understandable that cars can suffer from specific things over 10 years period because they never designed a completely new car and always adapted the new rules to the current car.', 'Barcelona is all about aerodynamic efficiency, how much usable high-speed downforce you can produce with the least amount of drag.

One way to eliminate this issue would be to move the timeline for practice and qualifying to somewhere before pit-in so cars coming off a flyer can just duck in the pits and get out of the way. 

IndyCar does this and it works well.
