The leak didn’t give full details, but the map suggested a tight course rather than the wide, open circuits fans are used to, raising questions about safety and overtaking opportunities. While no official confirmation has been made, the idea of a full Formula 1 event on these suburban roads is quite a debateble topic in my opinion.

Weird that they would also hold a race in a town of only 2,000 people out of anywhere, the might to the lower division races here instead.

Even with the challenges, the possibility of a street race through a normally quiet residential area is exciting. I can just imagine cars blasting through corners that I sometimes drive on.
