But the Qatar track has no character whatsoever, I've never been able to discern the layout as it all looks exactly the same. It is a sea of flat tarmac, floodlights, and high-speed corners going into medium-speed corners. No identifiable corners, no landmarks for reference. 

Miami, a fairly universally disliked track, has distinct parts and buildings like the stadium and intersection for reference, so you can tell where in the track the rivers are. Bahrain, a similarly situated track with a barrage of floodlights in the middle of a desert, has the large tower by the first corner and goes up & down a hill for some kind of reference point. China has the gigantic pit building great first corner complex and a thrilling final few corners. Abu Dhabi, known for it's lack of character, is fairly nicely split into thirds with the high speed first sector, double-straight, and 90° corners galore.

Is this just me? Are there any other tracks that have a distinct lack of character that I am missing?

Does someone like Bianca Bustamante actually have the skill to backup mocking actual f1 drivers like Lance Stroll, or would Lance Stroll in a wig lap every single f1 academy driver comfortably without breaking a sweat in equivalent machinery over a full grand prix length.

Also freca scored points but only finished 17 behind drivers that only copeted in half the races.\n\nThere is a reason why F1a exists and that is why i do not agree with Flörsch at all that they should just compete in the normal ONLY. F1A helps to get them some experience and exposure to sponsors (racing is expensive someone has to pay for it) and then join the normal series a year later or 2.', 'mediocre F4 level.', 'They have F4 cars, exactly the same model used in any F4 category out there\n\nSome of them race in EURO F4 or Formula Regional (between F4 and F3) but none of them achieved any important result. Maybe (with money) they can get to F3, in the same way Floersch did, but F2 is absolutely out of reach', ""\n>but aside from the cars which are obviously even slower than F4,\n\nThey're just standard F4 cars aren't they?"", ""FE did a women's test and that probably gave us some good insight where they are as it was same cars and track as the main drivers in that series. Also, a lot of F1 academy drivers took part.\n\nBasically compared to the guy's best time, Abbi Pulling set the fastest womens time that was 3 seconds slower. Now there's some caveats of course; the women only had 3 hours in the car vs the guys who had 3 days, the women had no sim time at the track and obviously a lot their first time driving a car as fast/powerful as the current FE car.\n\nTo make it sound better, if you compare Pullings time to the guy's 1st session, she was about 1.3 seconds off the ultimate pace. Also have to caveat that with the track was at it's best when the women went out. However, given the lack of experience and such probably can guess they are around 1.5 to 2 seconds slower compared to a grid of talented professional drivers that are around F1 level (lots of ex F1 drivers on the grid)"", 'The series is meant to give a woman a fair shot at a racing career, which I think is good. Does it work that way? Hmmm, maybe, it gave someone like Chadwick a push. Do any of the current academt drivers have what it takes to bet into F1? I doubt that. But I hope they do find a few raw talents. Can female racers have a career outside the academy. Of course, but a bit of help is okay.']",0,49,0.42,0,45,45,0,1,0.0,0

The 1980s and 1990s, however, were quite different. For instance, not many would have known about Ayrton Senna\'s beautiful friendship with Keith Sutton, had the latter not come out to shed light on it recently.\nAlthough Sutton never made it to the pinnacle of motorsports, he too, vied for a career in racing at the same time as Senna. Senna became successful, whereas Sutton started working as the Sao-Paolo native\'s personal photographer for a short period of time when he was in the lower ranks of open wheel racing (between 1981 and 1984).\nSenna first met Sutton when he took some pictures of him in his junior Formula car. Impressed, he asked Sutton to join his team and the two began working together, resulting in many prominent personalities getting to know the Brazilian driver, thanks to the clicks.\nEventually, Senna would meet the right people who would help accelerate his F1 dream, which not only did he realize, but also conquered. By winning three World Championships, he became one of the best and most beloved drivers of all time.\nSutton\'s role in shaping his career won\'t be forgotten and his time with Senna will be immortalized in the upcoming Netflix miniseries about the late great legend.\nSutton took to his own Instagram account to share his feelings about their friendship before the premiere. He wrote, ""Working closely with Ayrton during the early years of his racing career remains one of the most special periods of my life. Capturing the moments of a legend in the making was an honor I\'ll never forget.""', 'It was a B-minus for me! \n\nPositives: cinematography, cast (Prost’s perm was chef’s kiss)\n\nNegatives: too much drama with Senna-Prost and Senna-FIA', 'The racing scenes were pretty repetitive and so were the Brazilian celebration scenes at the end of some episodes.  Also feel like some of sennas mannerisms weren’t portrayed that accurately.  But overall not bad', 'Very educational, I didn’t know Alain Prost was the actual devil responsible for famine and genocide.', 'Is it worth watching?', 'Sadly Akin has always been pictured like this by movies or TV shows on Senna.
