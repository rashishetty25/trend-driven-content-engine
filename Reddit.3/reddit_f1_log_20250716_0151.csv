How do **you** pronounce rawe ceek? Is ""rawe""

* raw (silent e)
* RAH-we / rah-WE (long e)
* RAH-way / rah-WAY (italian e)
* RAW-eh (thanks u/WussssPoppinJimbo )
* RAW-uh (thanks u/AintNoUniqueUsername )
* rave (thanks u/Witchdemigoddess )
* reyw (thanks u/ln4thegreat and u/abraxasnl )
* RAY-weh (thanks u/achterkant )

Is ""ceek""

* seek (soft c)
* keek (hard c)
* cheek (italian ce)
* creek (thanks u/TheKennyAlmighty )
* chick (thanks u/PaddyTheMedic )
* sheek (thanks u/uucchhiihhaa )

As a native English speaker I've always only said ""raw seek"" but now that I think about it ""RAH-way cheek"" sounds more authentic.

I only started watching Formula 1 a few seasons ago because of the show. I still get excited and binge it as soon as it premiers.



That said, you need to take the show with a grain of salt. Some of the story lines are churched up for TV excitement. The biggest example that comes to mind from last season is Lando's first win at Miami. The show showed a frustrated Max, but in reality he was excited for Lando and gave us his famous ""If my mom had balls"" quote.","[""Redbull drama, Hulkenberg's podium, Ferrari doing Ferrari things, and manufactured McLaren driver squabbling.
