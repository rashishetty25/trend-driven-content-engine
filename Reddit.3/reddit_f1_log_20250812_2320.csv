1mochu4,[Thomas Maher] Confirmation of Sergio Perez making his F1 comeback (at Cadillac) is expected shortly after the summer break.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mochu4/thomas_maher_confirmation_of_sergio_perez_making/,2025-08-12, News,,"['Experienced driver to help get the wheels rolling, a fantastic short term candidate with lots of sponsorship. Makes a lot of sense.', 'I want the Checo and Bottas line up. Battle of the second drivers of Mercedes ans Red Bull', 'Somehow Checo has returned', 'Sergio “i fucking told you it was the car” Perez', ""Perfect signing for Cadillac. If they can get Bottas, they'll have a real solid lineup for a newcomer team."", ""Honestly, after seeing what he went through at Red Bull, I'm glad he's getting another shot.\n\nI was definitely one of the detractors last year, but no one has been to able to drive the second RB, and it would be a shame for his career to end that way."", 'How reliable do we think his info is?', 'I think he’ll be a good fit at Cadillac. He has the experience. Now all we need is to know who has the second seat.', 'As a mexican, great news if true. Even if it turns out Checo is actually washed, Cadillac is still gonna sell merch like hotcakes lmao.

The best skit gets an award apparently. I wish they would show that. They do zombies and things like that.

I wish they would highlight that more. \n\nEveryone always says the race cannot be run without the marshals, let the fans understand them a little more.', 'Did those marshalls stop pushing to give the other team an opportunity to do it?  \n  \nThats pretty damn wholesome', 'Puts me in mind of the old ""flying marshal"" clip from F3000.', ""There's a lizard sound?"", ""I honestly wish we'd get to see more of the people who make the races happen. It's similar to baseball, where if you're there in-person there's a lot of small events and fun going on between innings that you rarely see on TV because it's during commercial breaks. F1 is always commercial free, and with F1TV there's basically unlimited time for extra stuff like this. It's a motor race! It's supposed to be fun!
