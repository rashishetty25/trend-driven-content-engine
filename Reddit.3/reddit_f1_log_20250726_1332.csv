Said it was the first time it had ever happened in his career', 'Went from handing in manuscripts about where Ferrari needs to improve to win championships...to this within the space of a day.\n\nJust Ferrari things.', 'It was an odd mishap. Even at first view, the spin and loss of the rear was FAR earlier than usual for an F1 car. When I saw it, my immediate thought was ""the car broke"" because it seemed like it spun while mostly on straight line braking. If the car spun as it tried to turn into the apex or coming out of the apex, that would be a typical ""too aggressive"" driver move but this really didn\'t seem like it.', 'A key trend in F1 at the moment is for fairly extreme anti-squat and anti-dive geometry to keep the car ""flat"" under acceleration and braking and preserve a consistent ride height for optimal aero.\n\nAll of that theoretically makes the car faster, but it reduces the ""feel"" for the driver. As an accomplished sim racer, Verstappen is probably well placed to exploit this and drive fast without being able to feel the car as well - might explain why RedBull cannot seem to find a team mate able to consistently exploit the car\'s capabilities. Verstappen isn\'t a magician,  there is simply a performance ceiling where the car couldn\'t lap any faster that he can get close to. Piastri\'s McLaren has more front anti-dive than Norris is comfortable with and is therefore theoretically faster IF he can exploit it.\n\nEvery change to the suspension that impacts squat/dive is going to slightly change the optimal brake bias and how the downforce level changes under acceleration and braking. Lewis just found where the limit is. If you never come off the track, you aren\'t trying hard enough to go fast.\n\nOn a fast track like Spa, consistent ride height and the ability to deliver more consistent ground effect downforce is going to allow less top-down aero and a higher top speed. Ferrari haven\'t done the drivers any favours timing the new package for a sprint weekend on a high speed / hairy circuit like Spa - it has the most potential to make a difference here, but the drivers need to learn how the car now behaves.', 'Here we go‚Ä¶\n\nWhy can‚Äôt we just take anything at face value anymore.

The story follows up on Bearman‚Äôs previously celebrated kart lap record in Varberg, where he clocked 28.97 seconds after several days of dedicated practice and technical fine-tuning‚Äîlighter clothing, chassis tweaks, fuel adjustments, setting tire pressure lap-by-lap, and even using a leaf blower to cool the engine  Ôøº.

Zewenwacht, who previously had no competitive experience beyond rental karting, used the same kart‚Äîinitially even with the same worn tires‚Äîand gradually improved. He slipped to 28.99 seconds before switching to fresh tires. By the third or fourth lap, he hit 28.95  Ôøº.

1. Started in Max's shadow at Toro Rosso  both were rookies, but Max got all the attention and eventually Red Bull‚Äôs full support.


2. Never got a proper Red Bull seat, even though many felt he was just as consistent and arguably more polished early on.


3. Moved around a lot  Renault, McLaren, Ferrari  but never got the top tier  machinery at the right time but helped McLaren to rebuilt itself.


4. 2022-23 Ferrari drama When the car had potential, team strategy and inconsistency held him back.


5. 2024: Dropped for Hamilton even after outperforming Leclerc in multiple races.
