**Most Second Place WDC Finishes**

1. Stirling Moss **- 4**

\- Alain Prost **- 4**

3. Graham Hill **- 3**

\- Nigel Mansell **- 3**

\- Lewis Hamilton **- 3**

\- Sebastian Vettel **- 3**

\- Fernando Alonso **- 3**

8. Juan Manuel Fangio **- 2**

\- Jackie Stewart **- 2**

\- Jacky Ickx **- 2**

\- Ronnie Peterson **- 2**

\- Emerson Fittipaldi **- 2**

\- Ayrton Senna **- 2**

\- Damon Hill **- 2**

\- Michael Schumacher **- 2** (3 if he didn't get disqualified in 1997)

\- Rubens Barrichello **- 2**

\- Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen **- 2**

\- Nico Rosberg **- 2**

\- Valtteri Bottas **- 2**

19. Alberto Ascari, Nino Farina, Jos√© Froil√°n Gonz√°lez, Tony Brooks, Bruce McLaren, Wolfgang von Trips, Jim Clark, John Surtees, Jack Brabham, Clay Regazzoni, Niki Lauda, Gilles Villeneuve, Nelson Piquet, Carlos Reutemann, Didier Pironi, Michele Alboreto, Ricardo Patrese, Jacques Villeneuve, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Eddie Irvine, Mika H√§kkinen, David Coulthard, Felipe Massa, Jenson Button, Charles Leclerc, Sergio Perez, Lando Norris **- 1**

Most striking, of course, are the two drivers who finished second four times. Sir Stirling Moss is often said to be the best driver to never win a title and when looking at this you can see why. On the other hand though, Prost won four and finished second four times. He was 5.5 points away from being a 7 time champion and 12.5 away from being an 8 time champion. Another name that stood out to me was Ronnie Peterson, because while I had heard the name before, I didn't really know much about him, so finding out he finished second twice was a surprise. One last little thing I found interesting before moving to the next list is that Vettel actually finished second before Alonso did, with his 2009 second place. Alonso had already been in the sport for almost a decade and was a 2 time champion by then, but never did finish second up to that point. He came close in 2007 finishing tied on points with Hamilton for second but losing out to him on countback. This season, Hamilton and Alonso could in theory tie the record, or maybe Verstappen will finally join the list.

After seeing the stats about who came second the most I was curious about who took the title fight to the last race, but just couldn't get over that final hurdle and lost on the final day. For this list I included any driver that had a mathematical chance of winning the title going into the final race and lost. Multiple times this included more than two drivers, meaning that there were multiple who lost on the final day.

**Most Titles Lost in Last Race**

1. Lewis Hamilton **- 4**
2. Michael Schumacher **- 3**

\- Fernando Alonso **- 3**

4. Stirling Moss **- 2**

\- Jim Clark **- 2**

\- Alain Prost **- 2**

7. Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, Peter Collins, Jean Behra, Luigi Fagioli, Jos√© Froil√°n Gonz√°lez, Tony Brooks, Graham Hill, Jack Brabham, Jackie Stewart, Denny Hulme, Clay Regazzoni, Jody Scheckter, Niki Lauda, Jacques Laffite, Carlos Reutemann, John Watson, Ren√© Arnoux, Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet, Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve, Eddie Irvine, Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, Felipe Massa, Mark Webber, Nico Rosberg **- 1**

I suppose it sort of makes sense that the best driver ever statistically would have a lot of title fights go down to the last race, though to lose 4 like that must not feel great. As I'm sure many of you know, Lewis finished 2nd in his first season, losing out to R√§ikk√∂nen by only one point. His other losses at the final race come in 2010 when he was one of four drivers that could have won the title, 2016 when he was beat by a Monaco based YouTuber in equal machinery, and of course in the infamous 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix which I am not going to get in to here. Schumacher arguably had the largest amount of points dropped to an opponent in the final race, when he was disqualified after the 1997 European Grand Prix for trying to take out championship rival Jacques Villeneuve. Alonso got to share in the fun of losing out by only one point in 2007, tying on points with Lewis but finishing third on countback. His other two times losing on the last race came against Vettel in the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix when he couldn't get past Vitaly Petrov and the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix in one of the craziest races of all time. Speaking of titles lost in Brazil, we can't have this discussion without talking about the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, where Felipe Massa was WDC for all of 30 seconds before Hamilton was able to pass the slow Timo Glock on just about the last turn of the last lap. Going back to Alonso's good friend Vettel, despite finishing third three times, he never lost at the final race. One final thing that I found interesting while doing this was that despite their rivalry being arguably the most famous in the history of the sport, Senna and Prost never had a title decided between them on the final race. The three times they finished as 1-2 the title was decided in Japan, at the penultimate race. Like with the previous stat, Alonso could in theory tie the record this year, or Hamilton could extend his gap at the top, though I'm not sure if we want them to have to go through that again.

To finish this long post off, I have a little bonus stat. While I was finding titles lost in the last race, it only made sense to also record who won those titles on the last race.

**Most Titles Won in Last Race**

1. Fangio **- 2**

\- Graham Hill **- 2**

\- Nelson Piquet  **- 2**

\- Michael Schumacher  **- 2**

\- Mika H√§kkinen **- 2**

\- Lewis Hamilton **- 2**

\- Sebastian Vettel **- 2**

8. Nino Farina, Mike Hawthorn, Jack Brabham, John Surtees, Denny Hulme, Emerson Fittipaldi, James Hunt, Keke Rosberg, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve, Fernando Alonso, Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, Nico Rosberg, Max Verstappen **- 1**

Interestingly, no driver has won more than two title deciding races. This year Hamilton could be the first driver to ever win three title deciding races, or Alonso or Verstappen can tie the record. Maybe this is the next record Max will come after.

I hope anyone who made it this far enjoyed learning about all of this as much as I did. Thank you for reading to those who who did make it here. If anyone finds a mistake in my post please let me know, and if anyone has any other interesting stats related or not related to this I would love to hear them.

1iywct3,Changes to the 2025 Formula One Sporting Regulations as agreed by today WMSC Meeting,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iywct3/changes_to_the_2025_formula_one_sporting/,2025-02-26, Technical,"[The Sporting Regulations are linked here](https://www.fia.com/system/files/documents/fia_2025_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_4_-_2025-02-26.pdf)

This is a non-exhaustive list of all the changes to the Sporting Regulations that were published today following a meeting of the WMSC.
Note that due to more than 1 member of the WMSC being barred from attending said meeting and this seemingly being in violation of the FIA statutes, it remains to be seen if these changes are valid or not.

Either way:

* A clarification to the number of stewards at any weekend which will now be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 (Not including the local national steward)

* The regulations in regards to drivers with serious mechanical difficulties leaving the track has been updated to:         
 - > ""Any driver whose car has significant and obvious damage to a structural component which results in it being in a condition presenting an immediate risk of endangering the driver or others, or whose car has a significant failure or fault which means it cannot reasonably return to the pit lane without unnecessarily impeding another competitor or otherwise hindering the Competition must leave the track as soon as it is safe to do so.""

 - Under the sole discretion of the race director such a car can be instructed to leave the track as soon as it is safe to do so.

* The Heat Index required to trigger a Heat Hazard has been increased to 31¬∞C (Was 30.5). Once the heat hazard has been declared, all components of the driver cooling system must be fitted with the exception of the cooling media and the driver's personal equipment (i.e. Cooling vest). At the start of any sprint or race session for which the heat hazard has been declared, all components of the Driver Cooling System must be installed. If a driver wishes to not wear his personal cooling equipment, everything else must still be installed including the cooling medium. In addition an extra 0.5kg of ballast will be added into the cockpit for those drivers who don't wear their personal cooling equipment.

* The entire section of the Usage of Restricted Number Components has been made void.

* The usage of tyres has now been clarified. Tyres fitted in the pit lane will now be deemed to have been used once the car leaves the pitlane with those tyres fitted. Tyres fitted on the grid will be deemed used when the car leaves it's grid position under its own power with those tyres fitted.

* The additional regulations in regards to the Monaco specific tyre rules (Must use 3 sets of 2 different specs) have been added. If a race is suspended and does not restart and a driver has only used 1 set of tyres, they will have an additional 30s added on top of the usual 30s added on for not using 2 specifications of tyres.

* From 24h prior to the start of the competition, if it is requested by the technical delegate, any competitor must provide without delay any team specific items such as, but not limited to, adaptors, fixtures, lifting devices, tools, wiring looms or connectors defined in and required by the Appendices to the Technical Regulations to facilitate the undertaking of scrutineering checks

* For cars starting from pitlane, the time for work being allowed in the fast lane has changed from 90 seconds after the start of the formation lap to 15 seconds prior to the start of the formation lap. This is now equal to those cars starting on the grid.

* Once all cars on track have passed the end of pit lane on the formation lap, the pit exit will open and all cars starting from the pit lane must leave the pit lane and join the formation lap. All such cars must enter the pit lane and the end of the formation lap.

* The driver of any car immobilised on the grid at any time after the formation lap has started and before the start of a race must raise their hands above their head to signal they have a problem. These cars will then be pushed into the inner lane (Not the fast lane) where the team may attempt to restart it.

* Extra formation laps can now be brought into place at any point after the start of the formation lap and before the start of any race (Before it was technically only possible once all cars had returned to the grid after the formation lap).       
 - Once all cars have completed their formation lap returned to their grid position, orange lights will be illuminated on the gantry and a board saying **EXTRA FORMATION LAP** will be displayed. After 2 seconds the green lights will be illuminated on the gantry, signalling for the cars to complete an extra formation lap.

* For an aborted start (Which now can also be called at any point after the start of the formation lap and before the start of any race), once all cars have completed their formation lap and returned to their grid spots, the orange lights will be illuminated on the gantry and a board saying **ABORTED START** will be displayed. All cars should remain in their positions and team personnel and equipment will be permitted access to the grid. 

* The Sporting Regulations now include a full text version of the FIA Motorsport Privacy Notice in regards to Data Protection and what personal data they collect

As said, this was non-exhaustive and I have most likely missed something. 

The 2025 technical regulations, The 2025 Financial Regulations and the 2026 Technical Regulations were also updated today.","['The aborted start and new formation lap point is funny because the issue was that not all cars finished the formation lap. So the same case as it did happen is still not clarified?\xa0', ""Seems like this will really fuck over anyone starting from pit lane, there won't be enough time to get to pit exit before the start lights go out."", 'Wait all components? So all engine and gearbox number restriction is removed? Or still only gearbox?', ""For Monaco the F2 rule (no idea if it's still a thing) of tyre changes only count when in green flag would be better. Also would be nice to add the change doesn't count under red flag because the scenario someone bins it and causes a red flag is quite high in Monaco"", ""Great so we now have a train where everyone pits 2 times in Monaco... As of that's gonna change anything. The cars are just to big for it."", 'I wish they also allowed little bit of outside help from marshalls for the cars to get going. ala Hulkenberg at Brazil last year.', '""The additional regulations in regards to the Monaco specific tyre rules (Must use 3 sets of 2 different specs) have been added.

A novelty.', ""Why the fuck are they upping what constitutes hazardous heat, do they think drivers' bodies are evolving higher heat tolerance or what"", 'I simplified it down.\n\n> Once all cars starting from the grid, able to do so, have completed the formation lap and returned to their allocated starting position on the grid the orange lights on the start gantry will be illuminated are switched on, a board saying ‚ÄúEXTRA FORMATION LAP‚Äù will be displayed and all Competitors will be informed using the official messaging system.

Merc, Mclaren, RedBull at the sharp end, a small gap to Ferrari and Williams then a bigger gap to the rest.  The morning session produced slower times (no surprises there), so much much too early to make team mate comparisons. (except perhaps Aston Martin)

Sainz less than a 10th off his old team mate, maybe not such a bad move?  yeh yeh, day 1 of testing etc.  But a heck of a lot better for Williams than recent years.  (and yes I am biased)","['Anyone know why Aston did such a small ammount of lapso?', 'I read that as Brain Testing at first.', ""And as usual people are reading wayyyy too much into the timing sheets. What I've found much more reliable, is what teams/drivers say after a few days of testing.

This would be a performance benefit and would prevent cars leaving the box without wheels, or even flinging wheels into people.  (thinking of that cameraman hit by mark webbers loose wheel in 2013)","['Generally sensors that can prevent the car moving need to be very reliable and redundant multiple times, otherwise the risk of cars being stuck in pitlane due to a dodgy sensor reading goes up for a pretty small increase in safety.\n\nAs bad as loose wheels are, there are other ways to minimise the risk of them occurring without electronically stopping the car moving.', ""I like the idea of a sensor notifying the team of a potentially loose tire but I don't think it should stop the car from doing anything in particular, its just too big of a risk for it to malfunction and ruin someone's race.
