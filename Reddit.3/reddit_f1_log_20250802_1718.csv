1mfmqcq,Ferrari: Hamilton reverts and chooses more load compared to Leclerc,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mfmqcq/ferrari_hamilton_reverts_and_chooses_more_load/,2025-08-02, News,,"['""Lewis Hamilton loves big loads"" - The Race', 'Translation\n\n\nYesterday Ferrari dedicated FP1 to a collection of data and analysis of two different setups. Lewis Hamilton took to the track with the SF-25 set with the maximum downforce, then with the rear wing and the beam wing used in Monte Carlo. His teammate instead chose a minor step, focusing on the mid-high-load rear wing of Barcelona and a beam wing with the second unloading element. Charles Leclerc immediately found a good balance and feeling with the car, although the track is not one of his favorites, having to fight only with a bit of oversteer. The increasing grip of the track will certainly help, in addition to the refinements of setup between Friday and Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe choice was also confirmed in the second free practice session, with Lewis Hamilton converting to that of choice. Waxing and beam wing therefore for the seven-time world champion, who, however, did not find the same answers as the Monegasque. In the fast lap he paid a not indifferent gap. On the long run, carried out with the Soft (Leclerc with the average) he had a good pace and even a fair amount of consistency, but via radio he complained a lot about ‚Äúthe balance is dangerous‚Äù, he told his track engineer, Riccardo Adami. Looking at the onboards, beyond the times, we saw an SF-25 more nervous for him and that from understeer to center-curved ‚Äì mainly the wide-ranging slow curves ‚Äì turned into violent snaps of the outgoing rear. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a long way from being on the tracks,‚Äù Hamilton said at the end of the day. ‚ÄúCharles is fast, but I‚Äôm not and I don‚Äôt have a good balance yet.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAfter and during the FP1 the Englishman complained of lack of front load, with the car felt by the Englishman too understeer. For the second session of Friday, therefore, he had tried to align the choices between the two drivers with the grade 4 wing, a little more discharge, but which did not greatly improve the driving feeling of the Englishman. From the images collected by the pit-lane this morning the car number 44 is inside the garages with the maximum load configuration, which would suggest that the evening briefing has led the Ferrari technicians to take a step back and go back to a more loaded setup the number 44. So, except for last-minute trim changes, Hamilton will return to the track with the most loaded setup in the FP3, which could also help him in case of rain on Sunday. The front wing instead is of the same specification, with the riders who can then adjust the request of the setup, with the last flap to which a rather often and evident nolder remains integrated, to meet the technical requirements of the Hungaroring, with the need to have a lot of front load.', 'This is eother gonna be a Hamilton masterclass or disasterclass\n\nEdit:    :(', ""Feeling I've been reading different versions of the same headline almost every race since 2022."", ""His pace in FP2 was good, so this is all about the feel of the car.

I'd change the stupid rule that you can't get points from two series in a year if the second one starts before the other one ends, but you can get points from two if they don't overlap like that.

Is there a reason why this would be more prevalent? Conditions looked dry, most drivers know the track well, I don‚Äôt think it has been re-profiled. Is there something about the current regs/cars which makes it more likely?

","['They mentioned it on the broadcast -- not only is the corner tricky, but there is apparently a bump/is very bumpy and if you hit it incorrectly it can lead to lock ups.', ""It's a hard and tricky braking zone into the 1st turn. It's more common than you think."", ""It makes sense. Every event (even if same track) is different. Track isn't rubbered in, tire compounds change (year to year), changes in car suspension, different aero loads,  etc. This is exactly why there are practice sessions - so that drivers can explore the limits. FP1 is not about setting the fastest or cleanest laps. \n\nT1 has good run off w/o hazards (so very little risk going off) it is a heavy braking zone and pretty much every driver starts their run on the pit straight. Drivers don't have to play safe coming into it and tires are not always up to temp. This is where they would take risks as it gives a reference point for how much grip/braking the car handles for the rest of the lap."", 'Finding the limit, its a critical\xa0 corner aswell and technically hard', 'Ah!
