I left out the comparisons of AMR and Sauber because... not really much going on over there.

RBR is in a *bad* spot right now. Being slower than Alpine isn't any good. Comparing VER and GAS makes it visible, that Max absolutely had to give it all to overtake his old team mate. When looking over to the VER-TSU comparison: VER's Hard stint was absolutely awful. Which begs the question: Why did they not have enough Mediums left to go for a S-M-M strat? Many things going wrong right now at RBR.  
  
Piastri controlled the pace well enough to never be in any danger, but on paper, the Ferraris should have been in podium contention. Gasly told his RE, that Leclerc told him on the drivers parade, that they are looking at a one-stop. And LEC did ask to think about Plan Delta, when called to the box. Hülkenberg did a 30-lap-stint on Mediums, but I doubt, that would have been an option for the front-runners. Plus, the rather strange choice to put on Mediums again, which forces you to swap to a compound in the last stint, that you  might don't even want to put on.  
  
 Haas did everything right, with Bearman capitalizing on the SC-discounted pitstops, and having overall strong pace. Bearman was struggling at first, but then got his footing, being at times faster than his team mate.  
  
Antonelli got rather screwed over by the strategy department, with ditching the Mediums after just 15 laps and then having to pit again after just 5 laps. Turning a P5 into a P11 is not exactly spectacular.  
Russell was in serious trouble and, looking at the pace comparison between him and Norris, benefitted mostly by Norris' mistakes.","['Regarding the one stop.

1jzint0,The new “Radio Rewind” series on F1’s Youtube channel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jzint0/the_new_radio_rewind_series_on_f1s_youtube_channel/,2025-04-15, Discussion,"There’s been a noticeable change in F1’s video format on YouTube. In the past couple of years, F1 consistently uploaded “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 Onboards” for every race weekend. It was a very good format and fans for the most part are enjoying it. However, this year they’ve completely dropped these two series in favor of “Radio Rewind.”

Now, “Radio Rewind” isn’t exactly new — it was typically used for classic races like Malaysia 2012, Canada 2011, Australia 2010, and Hungary 2006. But it seems like they now plan to make one for every race weekend.

Normally, I wouldn’t complain about it. I mean, it’s basically a combination of “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 (or even more) Onboards” in a single video. However, after the first few races, I have to say I’m not a fan of this new format.

First of all, it only focuses on the race (or the sprint, if there is one), completely leaving out practice sessions and qualifying. That’s a huge shame, because there are often a lot of interesting or funny team radios — or even crashes — that get missed.

Secondly, there’s the issue many fans have pointed out: the lack of subtitles for the team radio. Personally, I find this absurd. Formula 1 team radio has never been known for its clarity, so without subtitles, it’s really hard to understand what’s being said — especially when it comes to technical terms.

I’m not sure why they’ve chosen this direction. Maybe it’s to push out more videos per race weekend, but so far, it seems fans and viewers aren’t happy with it. The comment section under the latest Bahrain GP “Radio Rewind” video was filled with people asking F1 to bring back the old format — separating the onboards and team radio into two separate videos, just like last year.

So what do you think of this new format? Do you like it, or do you also want to go back to the old one?","[""Yeah it's bad. Seems like a cost cutting measure to me.\n\nBut 90% of the comments on those videos are people complaining, so I'm sure they know."", '""maybe it\'s to push out more videos per race weekend"" \n\nbut theyre doing the opposite? 2023 we used to get radio rewind, top 10 onboards and post-race radio of every driver. now it\'s condensed in one video.', 'And the captions were not just for better understanding, they would add fun little effects to it like shaking when driver was shouting, or text bouncing when the car was porpoising', ""I watched one - I don't think I even watched it to the end.

Used to look forward to watching them a few days after the race.', 'I think if they add back captions it would improve the quality by quite a bit. I personally really like the new format, idk why, I guess it just has subversive element, but I miss the old format as well, so I am conflicted.']",95,23,0.88,95,20,20,15,3,0.0,15

Can you imagine Senna or MSC, let alone the guys today essentially encourage them to pass them for the LEAD??\n\nAnd yet Hockenheim 1970 was one of the best races of the 70s because they still battled for the lead so hard.\xa0\n\nR.I.P Jochen and all the others who lost their lives\xa0', 'F1tv premium family plan (2 slots).
