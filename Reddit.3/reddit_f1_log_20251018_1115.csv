Further, half of the drivers aren't having their sector times shown on the bottom of the screen. Even when all the slots for the times were empty. WTF?

There will be drivers on hotlaps, and ZERO sector timings being shown on the screen, while the camera is focused on a car doing an inlap or outlap.

If anyone from F1 production is somehow reading this: This is not difficult. You need to do two things.

1. Show the lap times for the entire session.
2. Show the sector times of the next 3 drivers to finish a hotlap.

Please for the love of god just do these two things. It doesn't even require interaction, it should all be automatic. I should not be required to pull up the timings on my phone just so I can see this BASIC information.

This isn't an isolated issue. It has been like this all season and it is driving me insane.

IF max wins all the remaining races he will end on 447 points.   
Even if this happens its in piastris hands, but just barely. With all 2nd places he wil end on 465 points - 18 points ahead of Max.  
This scenario would leave norris with a maximum of 422 points with all 3rd places.

In another scenario i wanted to see what would happen if piastri gets all 3rd places, and lando all 2nd places. This would make max the world champion with 447, Piastri with 444 and Lando with 443 - 4 points separating the top 3.   
In this scenario piastri would just need 1 2nd place finish to tie with max aswell with both on 447. This would still make max WDC with more race wins.

Ofcourse this will not happen, but the error margin for all drivers is so small at this point. One DSQ and the other 2 drivers are clear favorites. Piastri just needs to finish 3rd in every race except 2 where he needs to finish 2nd or better.

As of now they've abided by team orders, but I do think that the closer Max gets they'll both start driving more for themselves. Obviously maybe one of them will 'bow' out, but this might be your only shot ever to become a WDC, so it wouldn't surprise me to see some more shenanigans from now on.""]",0,26,0.39,0,24,24,0,6,-0.010000000000000009,0
1o9bj8o,Has F1’s identity shifted in the modern era?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o9bj8o/has_f1s_identity_shifted_in_the_modern_era/,2025-10-17, Discussion,"I’ve been watching F1 for a while now, and I’m curious what others think about the direction the sport has taken. There’s been a clear shift toward spectacle and entertainment alongside the racing and engineering.
The DRS, sprint races, Netflix effect, drivers doing media events around cities (like Austin), celebrity pop-ups, concerts—it’s all part of the modern F1 experience. The sport also feels more tech-driven and data-focused compared to previous eras.

Do you think these changes have made F1 better or worse? Is the balance right between entertainment and pure motorsport? Or is this just the natural evolution of the sport?

Genuinely curious to hear what people think!","[""Maybe it's because I'm from Melbourne but -\n\n>drivers doing media events around cities (like Austin), celebrity pop-ups, concerts—it’s all part of the modern F1 experience.\n\nHas been happening since the early 00s.\n\nDRS was a reaction to the aero getting too technical and was needed to get it back to where it was.\n\nSprint is definitely a shift though.\n\nI don't think it's that different."", ""This sport has always been tech driven.

1o9sgvh,Why is Lewis Hamilton performing so badly this season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o9sgvh/why_is_lewis_hamilton_performing_so_badly_this/,2025-10-18, Discussion,"I don’t really watch F1 that often, but I always knew Lewis Hamilton as the guy — like, basically unbeatable for years. I tuned in a bit this season and honestly… what’s happened? He just doesn’t look anywhere near the front anymore.

You’d think that with Ferrari being such a huge and prestigious name, he’d at least be fighting for podiums, but it even looks like his teammate is outpacing him most weekends. Is it just the car? Has he fallen off a bit? Or is there something else going on behind the scenes?

Genuinely curious because I remember when he used to dominate everything.","[""He's 40. He's in the first year with a new team. The car is pretty bad.\xa0\n\n\nHis teammate (who is considered by many the #2 driver in the sport currently) is only one place ahead of him in the standings.\xa0\n\n\nI really don't think he is doing that badly.\xa0"", 'Such a weird post after he outqualifed Charles yesterday', ""I do think Lewis always had periods where he just wasn't in the groove. Even in his dominant years he would often start a season with some pretty mediocre races. And then something switches and he became untouchable again.\n\nI do think having a dip like that, but without the familiar and very strong team behind him like he is used to, makes it harder to pop out of it. And of course he is also 40 years old now, it could also be that it is simply harder to fight back to that extreme level of focus, more so while also trying to fix a broken car and a team with functional issues.\n\nIf he was any regular driver I would say he simply should've retired. But it is Lewis, and I will never bet against him finding his groove and being properly fast again. But I'm also not sure enough it will happen to bet on it."", ""It's a tough pill to swallow for a lot fans, but he is past his prime."", ""I think he's just not good at the ground effect cars.
