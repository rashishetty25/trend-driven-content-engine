The two don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.**\n\n> In the first few races of the year, the communication problems between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer, Riccardo Adami, could still be attributed to the duo needing to get used to each other. But after their eighth Grand Prix together, the two still don\'t seem to be on the same wavelength.\n\n> Minor misunderstandings between drivers and engineers are nothing unusual in Formula 1. In the case of Hamilton and Adami, however, it\'s the tone that makes the difference. Normally, the partner at the pit stop should support the driver and provide clear instructions. At Ferrari, however, misunderstandings and questions arise again and again.\n\n> In the final part of the Monaco race, for example, Hamilton wanted to know if he was still a minute behind the leading four. The answer was no answer: ""Charles is on mediums, the McLarens are on hard tires. They\'re fighting very closely,"" Adami radioed to the driver.\n\n> **The sound makes the music.**\nHamilton reacted audibly annoyed to the useless information: ""You\'re not answering my question. Actually, it doesn\'t matter. I just asked if I was a minute behind."" Only then was Hamilton given the current gap, as requested.\n\n> After the race, a somewhat strange exchange also occurred. Hamilton radioed his engineer on the cool-down lap: ""It wasn\'t the easiest weekend. But we won\'t give up the fight."" He was met with silence, to which Hamilton followed up: ""Are you angry with me, or is something wrong?"" Again, there was no response.\n\n> During his press conference, team principal Frederic Vasseur once again had to answer questions about the somewhat confusing radio messages. The Frenchman attributed the communication problems to the special Monaco layout, where radio communication is only possible in certain sections of the track.\n\n> **Vasseur sees no tensions.**\nFurthermore, Hamilton\'s statements in the cockpit generally shouldn\'t be taken too seriously: ""There\'s no tension just because someone asks a question. He\'s under pressure, he\'s fighting, he\'s driving between the walls ‚Äì and he\'s doing that at 300 km/h. For me, that\'s all totally fine. I spoke to him after the race. He wasn\'t upset at all.""\n\n> But because this wasn\'t the first time Hamilton and Adami had talked past each other this season, frustration is growing among the record-breaking winner\'s fans. Their idol\'s poor results aren\'t helping to calm the situation, of course. The newcomer isn\'t looking for a chance against teammate Charles Leclerc.\n\n> Many fondly remember the times with Peter Bonnington at Mercedes. ""Bono"" and Hamilton formed a well-coordinated and close-knit team. While there were always a few questions about strategy, a certain respect was always expressed in their communication. The same couldn\'t always be said of Hamilton\'s radio messages in the first races of the year.\n\n> **Leclerc happy with new engineer.**\nEven his interactions with Sebastian Vettel and Carlos Sainz, whom Adami had previously coached at Ferrari, didn\'t always run smoothly. As a result, fans on social media are increasingly expressing their desire for Hamilton to be paired with a new man, preferably a British engineer, to avoid language barriers.\n\n> Ferrari demonstrated last year that it is willing to act in this position when necessary. Midway through the season, for the seventh race in Imola, Leclerc was given a new partner at the pit lane: Bryan Bozzi. The Italian replaced Spaniard Xavier Marcos. Since then, there have been clearer statements, something Leclerc repeatedly praises. Perhaps Ferrari should now try something new with Hamilton.', ""Answering your question: \n\nCharles on medium, Mclaren on hard. Lapping '16 very close to each other fighthing"", ""When the driver has to ask if the engineer is mad at him during the race, or when the engineer's mistake costs the driver 3 places on the racing grid, yeah, I think Hamilton needs a new engineer"", 'maybe Ferrari should just give the F1 team to their WEC crew?', 'Short answer: si\nLong answer: yes', ""Whole article about their Monaco communications but amus didn't mention the main miscommunication of the weekend which cost the driver 3 places"", 'It‚Äôs a relationship I don‚Äôt foresee getting any better.

1kxe5me,Grand Prix Plaza Las Vegas,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxe5me/grand_prix_plaza_las_vegas/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"Quick review of some components of the newly opened Grand Prix Plaza in Las Vegas, for those considering going.

Quickest background.  Netflix era F1 fan, watch every race, follow every social media account I can, etc.  I have a basic G29 steering wheel and pedal setup at home, and have played multiple seasons of all of the recent F1 games, although I have spent more time playing Gran Turismo 7 for the past two years.  Have never driven a proper racing sim setup with motion.

I arrived on a recent weekday morning around 1030am when the Plaza opened.  Talked to the Go Kart track employees for a few minutes about options for races, and decided to book a Mixed Race (~20mph or so) that is geared for all ages for $79.  Comes with two 15 minutes races, consisting of a qualifying session and then a grid start race.  Both sessions rankings are set by fastest lap only, to prevent the race session from being a block fest.  Blocking is easy to do as the track is pretty tight in most places, with a few decent opportunities to go 2 or maybe 3 wide and pass when needed.  Karts have functional DRS, which works by SLOWING the lead car, allowing the trailing car to pass.  Great concept in theory, but maddening when you're the lead car on a fast lap and you're artificially slowed down because someone is behind you.  Karts have functional ERS, which works great, is fun, but was not explained enough to the other drivers in my party who missed using it the entire first 15 minute session.  I used ERS to successfully get pole lap out of 10 drivers.   10 drivers on a grid made for 20 was pretty good, only a few bottlenecks during each session - the track workers are pretty good with telling people to move over, etc.   Overall, I enjoyed it for the price, my party members who are not F1 fans thought it was a blast, and I would do it again at the mixed race level or the nightly elite races which are 30 mph and I'm sure way more fun (I would have done the 30 mph race but did not have time in my schedule).

The arcade simulators was my most anticipated component of the event, as I'm an avid F1 game racer with a basic setup and hadn't ever used a Sim.  Cost is $40 for 9 time trial laps around the Vegas circuit.   The chair and wheel and pedal all seem to be pretty mid to high level in quality, but the game engine is a major fucking letdown.  All of the driver assists are on, and there is no way to turn them off.  The camera is halo, and can not be changed to cockpit for full immersion.  The game steers, brakes, and shifts for you around the circuit even if you try to override the shifts, or brake slightly earlier than the settings.  This setting is helpful for average tourists, but for anyone who has ever spent any time playing the F1 game or any other racing game, it is not worth the money.  If anyone from F1 or the GPP is reading this, theres got to be a way to change the settings for amateur or frequent players of racing games - your new F1 arcades across the world and this GPP will not bring in repeat customers otherwise.  As someone who loves F1 and racing games, I would not ever spend money on their Sim racing games again unless this was changed.  Just my $0.02.

There's a small store, restaurant, and museum on the second floor of the paddock.  I skipped the museum due to time, but walked into the empty restaurant at the northern end of the paddock  building at 11am just to see it and the menu.  Menu looked good and i would definitely try it once.  Restaurant decor was a bit sparse, but the views over T1 were very cool.  To get to the restaurant, you walk the entire length of the paddock and you can walk the exterior balcony and oversee the entire front stretch, which is very cool.  I had a drink at the bar near the store, which was high quality and around $21 (mid range price for Vegas cocktails).  Did not buy anything at the store, but they had a good selection and prices seemed cheaper than on race day (I'm not really a merch guy).

Overall, Go Karts were great, Sims were bad, restaurant incomplete but outlook positive, bar was good, atmosphere and access for a walk in patron were great.","['tbh sounds like a tourist trap and something to avoid as an F1 fan.\n\nKarting sounds very expensive and gimmicky and any local kart track would give a better experience. For example, my local track has loads of options, but at the top level is their ¬£75 package of a 5 lap practice/quali, 15 lap heat and 20 lap final race, on a wide flowing tarmac track with kerbing and karts of 40-50mph.\n\nAs you say, the sim is utterly pointless if every assist is on for every driver.', ""Holy shit, these US prices.

My question is: what aspect of track design lends to more overtakes? And why are many of these circuits being built this way?

This is probably fair- Haas had some dismal years from Bad Santa to Mazepin, and Williams during Claire's last years was in a sorry state.  

However, looking at Sauber's F1 results since *2008*, when they placed 3rd in the WCC, they've been quietly and consistently bad. Sauber has managed to place higher than 7th in only three seasons: 

2009: 6th 

2012: 6th 

2022: 6th  

Unlike both Williams and Haas, which are on an upward trajectory, Sauber seems to only be getting worse. So where is the uproar over their poor performance? Does Sauber not have a dedicated fanbase like the other teams?

As far as HAAS goes, they‚Äôve had too many seasons where they seemed incompetent (2021 comes to mind) and have had their fair share of drama.\n\nAs for Sauber, they‚Äôve always been an underdog team with lower funding and fewer fans, so of course lower expectations. People do love some of their drivers and moments (Kubica my goat), but they‚Äôve also gotten equal and well-earned criticism for pay drivers and now controversial sponsors.

All the drivers and all the cars are so good. Usually everyone is within a second in qualifying, and that definitely hasn't always been the case in F1. Honestly sometimes F1 qualifying is tighter in times than professional spec series qualifying, even when we all know that there's a general pattern that the better drivers are at the better teams, with some exceptions for most teams having a number one and number two driver, and some drivers not fitting in the driver market. With that taken into account, it's crazy how tight the whole F1 grid is. Sauber doesn't always have both cars out in Q1. They are bad, but there is usually a team this bad or worse.

Monaco is just *another* F1 race, much more beholden to the season surrounding it and given that it's really a qualifying session + a parade, it's arguably the easiest F1 race to win. I almost think the triple crown should be as simple as The Indy 500, The 24 hours of Le Mans and any F1 race win. It being two races + a championship would be silly."", ""If Monaco has to go, (Which it won't, and these constant posts are tiring) I assume (As much as people here look down on it) that the Monaco E Prix will take its place (In a similar vein to how in 1952 it was a Sportscar race) though it shouldn't."", 'There is an alternative definition with the world championship instead of Monaco', ""Personally couldn't care less about the Triple Crown. I would guess the majority of drivers don't either.\n\nHow many drivers in history have actually won it? Can't remember exactly but its single digits, right?\n\nYou could replace Monaco with the Nurburgring 24hr (held at the original Nordschliefe circuit).\n\n  \nPersonally, given all the money sloshing around Monaco, you would think someone would finance a project to reclaim a few square miles of land from the sea - still conveniently close to the town - and build a proper circuit.\n\nKeep the Triple Crown intact, keep the town centre accessible to pedestrians & traffic."", 'The Triple Crown feels like the same as the Double (Indy 500/Coke 600) does these days.  Yeah, there might be a few drivers interested in doing it,  but the logistics of it seem like a tough hill to climb/almost impossible.  JMO.\n\n  \nAnd that just kinda makes it uninteresting.']",0,85,0.28,0,80,80,0,0,0.0,0
