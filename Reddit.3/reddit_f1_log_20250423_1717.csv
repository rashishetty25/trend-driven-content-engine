1k5gu1b,Is Oscar Piastri's decision to snub Alpine for McLaren in 2022 one of the smartest career moves in F1 history?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k5gu1b/is_oscar_piastris_decision_to_snub_alpine_for/,2025-04-22, Discussion,"Aside from the obvious example of Hamilton’s gamble to join Mercedes, are there many career decisions in F1 that have worked out better than Piastri’s choice to ditch Alpine for McLaren?

Back in early July 2022, while still an Alpine reserve driver, it was already speculated that Piastri had signed a deal with McLaren — even though at the time, McLaren were behind Alpine in terms of car performance.

When Alonso made his shock move to Aston Martin, many expected Piastri to step up and partner Ocon at Alpine. Instead, he stuck with his McLaren move — a decision that completely altered his career path for the better. Rather than scrapping for the odd points finish at Alpine, Piastri now finds himself a championship contender in just his third F1 season.

For some perspective:

Points since Piastri joined F1:

Oscar Piastri — 488

Alpine F1 Team — 190

And just for fun: if Piastri had gone to Alpine as originally planned, who do you reckon would be Lando Norris’s teammate right now? I’d guess Gasly.","['Certainly, although Hamilton joining Mercedes in a shock move is probably better.', 'Lewis to Mercedes netted him 6 WDC. \n\nSchumacher to Ferrari netted him 5 WDC. \n\nNeither team on top when they moved. \n\nKimi to Lotus on a £50k per point contract is worth a mention too, if for different reasons.', 'I think the only better move I can think of to date was Hamilton to Mercedes in 2013, possibly Schumacher to Ferrari in 1996 but that took a few years to show championship level results', ""Piastri obviously made the right call but he definitely didn't snub Alpine. It seems Alpine's propaganda is hard to fight.\n\nHe never had a seat at Alpine. By the time they came calling, he was already committed to McLaren.\n\nAlpine ran a smear campaign and Piastri couldn't fight back because his deal with McLaren wasn't public yet, but Alpine certainly knew about it."", ""Also, Mark Webber's biggest achievement in F1."", ""Not really, it was a common sense move because at the time the deal was made it was a guaranteed seat vs a potential seat at one of either Alpine or Williams.\n\nIt's similar to the Verstappen situation where he was being courted by everyone, but only Red Bull had an F1 drive to give him immediately. There was not much risk, if anything the risk was staying with Alpine. It was an opportunity."", '100 race plan to win the title in full swing.

After the race, the engineers explained why fifth and sixth places were the best they could hope for.**\n\n> McLaren is slowly disappearing on the horizon. In the chasing pack, however, Mercedes remains the benchmark. Although the Silver Arrows had their weakest weekend of the year so far in Jeddah, George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli scored the same number of points as Red Bull and only three points less than Ferrari. Russell summarizes: ""If we still finish fifth on a bad day, I can accept that.""\n\n> On Saturday, everything still looked good. George Russell missed pole position by just 0.113 seconds. Andrea Kimi Antonelli placed the Mercedes in fifth place on one of the most difficult tracks. This seemed to indicate that the Silver Arrows were also on top of the game on the high-speed track.\n\n> But the tide turned in the race. In the very discipline in which Mercedes had been so consistent up to that point, Russell had finished on the podium in three of the four races. This time, he began to lose sight of the champagne positions after just 15 laps, even though he was still running in third place.\n\n> **Early pit stop takes its toll.**\nBut suddenly, the gap between Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri widened, and Charles Leclerc slowly made up ground behind him. The pit lane called Russell into the pits on lap 20 because the medium tires were showing clear signs of wear and there were fears that Ferrari might attempt an undercut with Leclerc.\n\n> Leclerc actually drove an extra nine laps, gaining more and more speed on the worn-out medium tires. It dawned on Mercedes that a podium finish might be difficult this time. Even though Leclerc was still 3.6 seconds behind Russell after his pit stop.\n\n> In the second stint, Russell quickly ran into tire problems as well. They overheated: ""I tried to keep up with Max, but it didn\'t work. After that, I wanted to save the tires, but they were much older than Charles and Lando\'s. When they passed me, my tires completely collapsed. I was losing a second per lap to them.""\n\n> **Weak point front tire.**\nThe engineers could see from the data why their chief pilot had his back against the wall. The front tires on the Mercedes were blistering, a sign of overheating. It was unusual, however, that the Mercedes was the one to take the lead.

We didn\'t want to risk that.""\n\n> Team principal Toto Wolff summed up with a slight frustration: ""We entered the race hoping to fight for a podium finish, but with the limitations of the tires, fifth and sixth places were the maximum for us.""

Ferrari found something in race pace, whether it was aided by track temps or characteristics or they managed to unlock something on the car, that put them a step ahead in the race.

To say that Ferrari is the slowest amongst the pack will be understandable, but difficult to affirm in sheer confidence. They clearly have strong aspects to capitalize on advantages that perhaps certain teams couldn't, similarly to Red Bull.\n\nAll it takes is for a DNF or two on McLaren's end, or any of their drivers dropping into the no-points zone for Mercedes to pounce on them. It is genuinely nowhere near over just yet. It sounds like copium on my end but if teams and drivers are still in the midst of pulling off great highs, then it is all game so far"", 'So is it a damping problem or general spring softness?

Oscar took too much speed into the corner as well, more than he would've liked if he was on a Quali lap, particularly in the second part completely deliberately in order to make sure he doesn't leave Max an inch of the track, even if that costed Oscar a lot of lap time quite obviously.

His 1st corner basically ended only in the middle of  the 2nd corner. Of course Palmer would not ever be talking about that.

You can carry more speed, brake late, and still make the corner but trade corner exit for better track position. \n\nI think anyone who plays sim racing or arcade game like F1 games or even Need for Speed games understands this concept. \n\nPalmer’s analysis is clearly biased to serve his opinion.', ""So Max could have made the corner. \n\nI guess throwing it up the inside and running your opponent off is now free game for Max for the rest of the season and he won't be penalized?"", 'How are we still talking about this?

Another weapon in Senna's armory was his utter ruthlessness.

""Senna's having a load, and Senna's hiding into the pit wall. Schumacher trying to take it and Senna. Now let's see if the Brazilian moved across. Indeed, he did."" (Murray Walker commentating on a battle between Ayrton and Michael)

""He often used to put us in a position where you were gonna have an accident, and he would leave it up to you to decide whether to have that accident or not."" (MB)

Martin experienced this psychological warfare, first of all, when racing against Senna in F3.  
""Well, look, I've got a great big lead here, and he launches in from nowhere and then parks his role on my shoulder. I couldn't get out of the car until they lifted his car off the top of mine."" (MB)

""So when he wants to overtake, he'd he'd go on the inside and put the car in a place. If you try to take the corner, you're going to hit him."" (JC)

""Yes. He would put you in a compromising position and then leave you to make the decision. And if you didn't run into him, then psychologically you were buried and finished.  
He would then know that every time after that he showed you a wheel, you jumped out of the way."" (MB)

1k5lnhi,Tension at Williams to come?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k5lnhi/tension_at_williams_to_come/,2025-04-23, Discussion,"This will get a lot of heat: Am I crazy, long time older Williams fan and I see having to put a “Blue Sky Rules” in place, similar to Papya. JV has gone out of his way to hype Carlos, encourage him thru transition and deservedly so but many making fun of it as if scrubbing Alex from website. Has gotten a lot better lately but noticed Carlos is getting most praise for single handedly providing double points. Then he pulls away during last lap for what he even calls “cheeky” lap. Alex radio stated “what is he…” like holding tongue and then he walked by Carlos’ car in parc ferma. His take on race vs Carlos’ left some fans with impression Carlos was the only one doing heavy lifting. Seems on any post specifically about Albon, albeit they aren’t numerous, the passionate Carlos fans come out. Just wonder if there’s tension to come. Realize there’s a newer fan base overall in F1, may not have the historical or driving knowledge and simply now fanatics for a particular driver. But see an issue for long term fans that remember Alex single handedly providing points, being loyal when had other suitors, and getting defensive as not equally appreciated by Carlos’ enormous and passionate fan base. Can see coming tension especially as truly believe we have a superior driver duo but cautious when remembering Carlos’ Silverstone, Vegas, and Spanish questionable team player clashes with Charles. Think Albons personality will be overly submissive. Hope JV remembers who helped to get them here and keeps in check. ","['They have a common goal in bringing Williams back to the front. I don’t think they’ll be that much tension', 'Hmm interesting question and well put together post.\xa0\n\nI think that Albon is closer to Sainz than Williams expected (as in he’s beating him). \xa0It is quite similar to Ricciardo and Norris as McLaren. Norris was immediately faster than Ricciardo and had a great start to the year in 2021. But over the season Ricciardo did come back and was even the better driver in a lot of races toward seasons end. Then there was a reg change in 2022 and Ricciardo’s form spiralled ginormously. Could the 2026 regs prove similar for Carlos?\xa0\n\nThere has been some worrying language coming from Sainz that he doesn’t know where he’s losing time, which is one of the most worrying that things to hear from an F1 driver. However he has been faster than Albon in the last two rounds.\xa0\n\nAnd there is also the question of what if Williams build a great car next year? It’s not out of the question and Vowles has been targeting 2026 ever since he took over in 2023. They have already shifted their development to it. If podiums and even wins are on the cards that relationship could become a lot less harmonious.\xa0\n\nHowever Vowles did make the mistake of hyping Carlos up too much. He’s a great driver but the way Vowles was talking youd think he’d signed Leclerc, not Sainz.\xa0\n\nBut in the end I think that the drivers themselves will not fall out. Why? Because they seem like the two most level headed guys on the grid. They both seem very intelligent and calm. Two chill guys that are experienced enough to know life is what it is and they’re lucky to be in the position they’re in.', 'Will there be tension between fanbases? Yes. Will it be necessary or earned? Doubtful.\n\nBetween drivers? Not unless their perspectives shift out of the blue. I could see similar ""tension"" that was at Ferrari with Charles and Carlos if Williams gets into the top 4 teams next year and can start challenging for wins. Some spicy radios, but in general, I\'d be surprised to see an actually toxic dynamic crop up.', 'No. At least for a while until the car can fight for victories.', 'Stop making non-existent dramas', ""Allegedly the 2026 regs are going to make the cars feel more like the 2017-2021 cars, and Carlos was arguably more comfortable in those cars than he is now (2017 and 2019 both being notably strong seasons for him). He also always says he doesn't understand where he's losing time, and then he goes into the data and figures it out. Common pattern with him, dating back to at least his Ferrari days. \n\nI do agree that I don't think there will be a falling out, they're too focused on the team's success. Carlos also never fell out with Charles for more than like a weekend, despite the high pressure of the Ferrari situation."", ""Strong analysis here, and from the OP. I think that everyone involved is most interested in the team progressing, and won't feel an urgent need to seriously scrap until they're doing it at the front.\n\n...And then we'll see what they've got.""]",0,10,0.34,0,7,7,0,0,-0.04999999999999999,0
1k5oyh5,Could Max have overcut Piastri in SA GP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k5oyh5/could_max_have_overcut_piastri_in_sa_gp/,2025-04-23, Discussion,"I was wondering if Max could have pitted later than he did and come out in front of Piastri. 

Pretty sure there are some people here a lot smarter than me that have looked into this already. Would be interesting to see if Max would have done a stint similar to Leclercs if he could have won. He seemed to have good pace on the mediums in the clean air.

","[""I don't think we really know how much extra pace Piastri had in hand. I feel as though he had enough in reserve to stay ahead of Max if Max had tried to overcut, what that might have meant for Piastri's tyre life at the end of the race is another matter."", ""He had good pace on old tyres but even that tyres can't hold for too long.\n\nFew more laps he will be even slower."", 'Oscar was doing purples pretty much immediately after he came out, so no.', ""He could probably have gotten in front of Hamilton but I don't think he could make enough gap to cover piastri as well, he was on old tyres after all"", "">I was wondering if Max could have pitted later than he did and come out in front of Piastri.\n\nImpossible. He gave everything he had (remember the, at least, two radio messages of his racing engineer to give it his all) in the mere two laps after Piastri pitted, and he STILL came around 2.5s behind PIA back on track. Piastri was already faster, so had max continued, he would've fallen even more behind. In fact, had he done even just a few more laps, let alone extend his stint like Leclerc did, he would've fallen behind Russell."", 'Fresh tires were much faster. Piastri took 3/4 of a lap to warm the tires during which time Delta increased by 0.5s or so. From that point on until Max pitted, delta was dropping 0.2 per sector.', 'Realistically, the way everything worked out, it went the best it could have.i was hoping for max to at least finish 2nd. That was good enough considering Mclarens pace,  Lando off the podium was necessary. Both those things happened. Not a bad weekend for Max. Still in the hunt.', 'Mathematical yes. But realisticly no. \n\nIt looks like it but factor in that oscar managed his tyres in case of a late safetycar or such. They all did. You wont find a good answer here because nobody can know', ""Am I the only one reading SA as South Africa?\n\nAnyway, the way it looked to me Max was only going to win if he'd had a better start and held off Piastri without overtaking off-track.""]",0,26,0.39,0,237,237,0,0,-0.019999999999999962,0
