1nx77fh,"FIA Presidential Election: Due to only 1 candidate for the WMSC being put forward by South American FIA Members, it is only possible for there to be 1 valid FIA Presidents list (MBS's) on the ballot.

The General Assembly is the gathering of all FIA Members for votes, discussions and what not.       \n\nThe procedures are well underway at this point with 4 candidates throwing their hat into the ring to take charge of the FIA.      \n\nMohammed Ben Sulayem - UAE - [FIA For Members](https://fiaformembers.com/)         \nTim Mayer - Canadian - [FIA Forward](https://www.fiaforward.com/)             \nLaura Villars - French-Swiss - No Formal Election Team        \nVirginie Philippot - Belgian - No Formal Election Team        \n\nHowever due to technical circumstances, **there can actually only be one eligible candidate on the ballot come December.** \n\nIn order to be an eligible candidate for the President of the FIA, the candidate must submit a **Presidential List** which is essentially their governing team.      \nThis Presidential List is made up of:     \n\n* The President of the FIA (The Leader of the List)     \n\n* The President of the Senate     \n\n* The Deputy President for Automobile Mobility And Tourism       \n\n* The Deputy President for Sport\n\n* 7 Vice-Presidents for Sport representing the various global regions\n\n * 2 for Europe          \n\n * 1 each for North America, South America, Asia-Pacific, MENA, Africa\n\n**No one may appear on multiple lists** and it is these last 7 which are so crucial as they must be candidates who have been put forward by FIA Members to be eligible for a World Motor Sport Council seat (The 7 who are made Vice-Presidents will be joined by 14 others who are voted on by the General Assembly).        \n\nOnly FIA Full Members who are not under suspension, who hold Sporting Power (There is only one per nation) and who have at least 1 competition entered onto the 2025 International Sporting Calendar are eligible to propose these candidates for the World Motor Sport Council.      \n\nThe Deadline for FIA Full Members to submit valid applicants passed on September 19th and [the list of Eligible Candidates for the WMSC can be seen here.](https://www.fia.com/file/386190/download)         \nAnd importantly the Geographical Distribution of [FIA Full Members with Sporting Power can be seen here.](https://www.fia.com/file/386191/download)\n\nIf you divide that list down on a region by region basis you get this distribution:      \n\n* 11 - Europe\n\n* 7 - Asia-Pacific     \n\n* 5 - MENA      \n\n* 3 - North America\n\n* 2 - Africa         \n\n* 1 - South America\n\nOf the 11 South American FIA Members, only Brazil submitted a valid candidate.       \nAnd because a Presidential List requires a valid South American Vice-President and you can't be on more than one Presidential List, there can only be 1 Valid FIA Presidential List come the Election.\n\nThe Candidate for Brazil is of course Fabiana Ecclestone (Yes, that Ecclestone). The current Vice-President for Sport for the South America Region and already declared on Mohammed Ben Sulayem Presidential List.\n\nAs such Mohammed Ben Sulayem has pretty much by default won the FIA Election before it has happened."", ""I don't know if it's because I've been awake for 24+ hours or if I'm just stupid, but I have no idea what exactly this image is showing lol."", 'What? What the actual fuck?', 'What?', ""From what I can see here;\n\nTop section shows the presidential structure of the FIA, which requires 7 vice presidents to represent the different continental regions across the globe.\n\nMiddle sections shows the vice presidential candidates for each nation, colour coded by region. \n\nBottom section shows MBS' ticket, which includes the sole candidate for South America (Brazil)"", ""I don't think that you make so many deliberate moves to gut and remove protections in the organisational structure of the FIA unless you're working to pretty much guarantee no one can usurp you through democratic means.\n\nMBS was always going to be reelected, because his unethical behaviour just doesn't matter to the apparent majority of the FIA member clubs."", 'Thanks I hate it', 'Kinda fucked system, one only has to bribe the continent with fewer members and then you win automatically.', 'What a ludicrous route to the voting system. \n\nEvery country should vote for president.
