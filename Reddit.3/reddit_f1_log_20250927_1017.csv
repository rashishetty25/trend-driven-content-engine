1nqxz31,Stronger Yuki Tsunoda showed why Red Bull won't rush F1 driver decision,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nqxz31/stronger_yuki_tsunoda_showed_why_red_bull_wont/,2025-09-26, News,,"[""Yuki,Hadjar and Lawson's performances aside, I think Lindblad has been extremely disappointing in a weak F2 field this year.

Good result for him, but a 6th place when his teammate completely dominated the entire weekend seems a bit pale.', 'I think that Red Bull always had the culture of ""You have to figure it out yourself or you are gone"" I think Albon or even Tsunoda said that they get little input on what might help with their struggles.\n\nI believe that this was a Horner policy and simce Mikkes took over it seems that Yuki gets a bit more help with setup adjustments that fit him better. At least he didnt looked that lost in the last 2 races.\n\nIts fair that they give him time and seems to make progress but man, you race against Hadjar, arguably the rookie of the year with very strong results. Its a tough call to let Yuki stay with the team at this point', ""He still lost almost 0.7sec a lap to a cruising Verstappen.  \nI don't expect anybody to be as fast as VER but I expect a good driver to be within 0.3sec/lap."", "">Stronger Yuki Tsunoda\n\nI have yet to see that in his Red Bull career.

He needs to be much closer to justify his spot in my opinion.']",1450,300,0.95,1450,4382,4382,5,1,0.0,5
