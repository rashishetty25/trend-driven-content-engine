Someone else has already taken the fall so even if Tsunoda comes in and generates the worst outcomes like crashing the car every outing, we won’t put it on him as we know:

a) the car is problematic. 
b) He has had a good season start in another car. 
c) another driver has failed in it. 
d) It’ll be awful PR for Redbull to shop for another driver, they’ll have to give him time. 
e.) even if they wanted to shop for a new driver, they’re out of options as far as car development experience goes unless they want to extend an invitation to Daniel Riccardio (very unlikely i think he is done with F1) 

In summary, there’s no performance level that he can exhibit from here on out that threatens his seat till the end of this season at least.

2.	⁠He has nothing to lose, his contract with Racing Bulls runs out this year with no clear potential to join any other team on the current grid.

Charles should have listened to those words of wisdom.', '(By Par Alexandre)\n\nScuderia Ferrari, struggling at the start of the season, suffered a particularly dramatic setback at the Chinese Grand Prix. After finishing in 5th place, Charles Leclerc was disqualified from the final standings due to a weight problem, a costly penalty for Ferrari in the championship race. But while the official reason was linked to a lack of weight under the regulation 800 kg, a new revelation from Fred Vasseur, Ferrari\'s main team, brings to light an additional and rather unusual cause for this disqualification.\n\nLeclerc had done everything right during the race, but once on the scales, Ferrari\'s SF-25 turned out to be slightly under the minimum required weight of 799.4 kg, after removing the two liters of fuel needed for post-race analysis. This missing kilo was enough to disqualify the Monegasque driver. At first glance, this might appear to be a purely mechanical infringement, but it seems there was more to it than that.\n\nRemember the exchange between Leclerc and his race engineer at the Australian Grand Prix? It should already have aroused suspicion: ""Is there a leakage? ... I have a full seat of water, like, full of water!"" What appeared to be an amusing exchange at the time of the race turned out to be the same reason why the single-seater lost weight at the Chinese Grand Prix. Indeed, according to Fred Vasseur, it wasn\'t just tire wear that contributed to the disqualification, but also the loss of a liter of water due to a failure in Charles Leclerc\'s drink supply.\n\n**In an interview with L\'Équipe newspaper, Fred Vasseur revealed that the situation was far more complex than a simple question of worn tires: ""Charles Leclerc\'s downgrading on Sunday is similar to what happened to Russell last year in Belgium,"" he explained. ""The tires are only part of the explanation... We also lost a liter of water when Charles\' drink supply leaked. Downgrading for weight is always an addition of small factors.""**\n\nFerrari being the limit of all parameters at the Chinese Grand Prix, it was this missing liter of water that played a key role in Leclerc\'s disqualification. A cause which might seem anecdotal, but which, combined with tire wear, cost Ferrari dearly. Frédéric Vasseur adds: ""The aim of the game in F1 is to get to the limit of all parameters, everywhere. To get to the last gram of weight, to get to the last tenth of a millimetre of skid, to get to the last millimetre of aileron deformation"". Let\'s hope that this water leak will be definitively repaired for the Japanese Grand Prix.', 'TL;DR: Must be the water.', 'Gotta say, lads\n\nI called it: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/r2hB5SK7Ha', 'Must be the water.', ""Leclerc really is Raikkonen's successor.

In terms of pure numbers, the 18-year-old hadn\'t really delivered a particularly outstanding performance. The Italian started in eighth place, and he crossed the finish line in eighth place as well. He was 53.7 seconds behind winner Piastri and 42.6 seconds behind George Russell in the sister car.\n\n> The disqualification of the two Ferraris subsequently pushed the youngster up to sixth place. After the race, the youngster revealed that he had sustained damage to the underbody somewhere, which was affecting his pace. Given this, the Silver Arrows driver\'s performance naturally had to be reassessed. The only question that remained was how and where the underbody was damaged.\n\n> After a detailed analysis of the TV images and an examination of the car, chief engineer Andrew Shovlin provided the solution a few days late: ""Leclerc had hit Lewis\'s right rear wheel. The end plate of his front wing broke off. Kimi saw this, but unfortunately he couldn\'t avoid it because other cars were next to him. He drove over the debris, which flew under the car and damaged the deflectors at the entrance to the underbody.""\n\n> Damage costs two to three tenths.\nThis sensitive area of \u200b\u200bthe car has a significant impact on aerodynamics and, consequently, performance. However, the loss of downforce was difficult to quantify, Shovlin regrets: ""It definitely cost a lot of performance. It would be easier to calculate how much it affected the lap time if we had already completed a few laps. But here it happened on the very first lap, so we can only estimate it. Based on the aerodynamic data, we estimate that the loss of downforce cost two to three tenths per lap.""\n\n> Another problem was that the damage affected only one side of the car. The loss of downforce was particularly noticeable on the rear axle. ""Kimi quickly got on the radio and complained that he had no grip at the rear. As a result, the tires started to slide, they overheated, and lost grip. He struggled with this problem for most of the race. During the pit stop, we were only able to alleviate it slightly with the front wing,"" said Shovlin.\n\n> There\'s more to come from Kimi. \nIn the end, the driver had to somehow deal with it himself: ""When you have that kind of damage to your car, it can result in inconsistent handling. Depending on the corner or wind direction, it\'s sometimes better or worse. The balance shifts in different directions. He really did a good job there. But of course, it was a bit frustrating when you saw his strong pace at the beginning of the weekend. He was battling with the two Ferraris and with Max.""\n\n> Overall, Shovlin gives his young protégé a glowing review for his start with the factory team: ""He\'s a brilliant fit for our team. It was quite difficult to succeed a driver as successful as Lewis. Everyone here in the team enjoys working with Kimi. And he\'s just having fun. Melbourne was particularly difficult with the rain in the first race. But he adapted well. I think there\'s a lot more to come from Kimi.""', 'So glad to let him play with puzzles.

Hulkeburg gets his first podiums at Mercedes.\n\n2014 - Hulkenburg (Merc)\xa0 Beats Rosberg by one point after going into double points finale 49 behind.\xa0\n\n2015 - Rosberg (Merc)\xa0 Is actually given a really close run by Ferrari’s drivers Alonso and Vettel but has strong end of the season to win.\xa0\n\n2016 - Rosberg (Merc)\xa0 Unlike 2015 this one is far less exciting than real life season. Rosberg wins pretty easily from team mate Hulkeburg. Vettel and Alonso take a couple wins for Ferrari and Ricciardo likewise for Red Bull. Highlight of season is Max winning the 2016 Brazilian Gp for Force India.\xa0\n\n2017 - Rosberg (Merc)\xa0 Very similar season to 2007 irl with just Ferrari’s Vettel and Alonso battling for championship and Rosberg somehow coming through to win it. Disillusioned Alonso leaves Ferrari and is replaced by Hamilton while Hulkenburg is replaced at Merc by Max. Carlos Sainz also gets his first win this year in dramatic race at COTA, he drives from Rrd Bull alongside Ricciardo in this timeline. Ferrari win constructors.\xa0\n\n2018 - Rosberg (Merc)\xa0 Undoubtedly one of the best seasons of all time. After race nine in Austria the top three in the championship are Vettel and the two Red Bulls (Ricciardo and Sainz). At seasons the championship is between three different drivers, (Hamilton and the Mercs) after the most insane Vettel bottlejob from like fifty points clear.\xa0 In last race Hamilton’s Ferrari breaks down (like Raikkonen’s irl) and though Max overtakes Rosberg he is left ruing his abysmal start to the year and Rosberg wins by a hair before announcing his retirement as a four time world champion and one of the greatest he sport has seen.\n\n2019 - Verstappen (Merc)\xa0 Verstappen wins for Merc this time after being given a run for his money by Hamilton at Ferrari. Max seals the title in Brazil. \xa0 Both their team mates (Vettel at Ferrari and Ocon at Merc) have poor seasons leaving the door open for Sainz to take third in standings for Red Bull. Vettel is replaced by Leclerc who spent 2019 at Haas.\xa0\n\n2020 - Verstappen (Merc)\xa0 Total domination akin to 2023 irl. Ocon is no match is he has a pretty poor season \xa0just like irl.\xa0 Also like irl, practically everyone aside from backmarkers gets podiums. Daniel Ricciardo is best of the rest for Red Bull. After Ocon’s poor season Russell is promoted to Mercedes. Hamilton and Leclerc get the best results possible out of THAT Ferrari.\xa0\n\n2021 - Verstappen (Merc)\xa0 Not as exciting as real life. Russell wins plenty of races and keeps championship interesting but towards end of season Max just streaks clear. Red Bull don’t have Max in this world so though Sainz and Ricciardo take some wins neither can beat Max in the Merc.\xa0\n\n2022- Leclerc (Ferrari) Take your pick who wins this 6 way championship battle.\xa0 You have Sainz and Ricciardo in Red Bull who both have pretty bad seasons particularly Ricciardo.\xa0 Then you have Leclerc and Hamilton at Ferrari. Hamilton struggles with Ferraris bad porpoising while Leclerc still has to deal with Ferrari reliability and strategy.\xa0 Then in Merc you have Max and Russell. Both have great seasons, particularly Max who is battling for the championship all the way to the end in THAT Mercedes. It comes down to Max, Leclerc and liaise shot for Sainz with Leclerc winning it in Abu Dhabi.\xa0\n\n2023 - Carlos Sainz (Red Bull) So Ricciardo is replaced by Norris at Red Bull and we get Carlando 2.0 as they have the best car.\xa0 Both have good years with Sainz only winning because he is more engrained in that Red Bull car after six seasons there.\xa0 They don’t make the Red Bull look quite as good as Max did and Leclerc, Hamilton and Verstappen all take the odd race wins with Oscar Piastri also winning in Qatar.\xa0\n\n2024 - Charles \xa0Leclerc (Ferrari) Again, take your pick who wins this one.\xa0 You have Lando and particularly Carlos dominating early season races for Red Bull before the convergence. Leclerc beats Hamilton at Ferrari and goes for his second title.\xa0 Piastri and Bottas are McLaren drivers and start winning when they get best car but neither has the outright speed of Norris. Max and Russell take plenty of wins but are kind of having their own little civil war.\xa0 Ultimately Leclerc actually wins the championship and the Constructors goes to Ferrari.\xa0 For 2025 season Bortoleto is promoted to McLaren to be Piastri’s team mate. Red Bull keeps Carlando. \xa0Verstappen is sick of Merc and jumps to Ferrari alongside Leclerc and Antonelli is promoted to be Russell’s new team mate at Merc.\xa0', 'https://preview.redd.it/b09sa076ydre1.jpeg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50195c179d247f055f46662b22651e0b2162d7e0']",0,28,0.5,0,28,28,-1,9,-0.16000000000000003,-1
