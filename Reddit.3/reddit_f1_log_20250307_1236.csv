Moving to more modern, future directed technology was a major strategic decision. Aside from the performance the hybrids are capable of, the biggest, most advanced series in Motorsport isn‚Äôt the place for technology everyone else has already moved on from.\nLooking into the future, there won‚Äôt be a car industry without EVs and hybrids. Even today barely anyone bothers to build anything bigger than a V8, so a series with V10 engines would be nothing more than a fun playground for people with money to burn.\nI know there is debate about how much ‚Äúroad relevancy‚Äù there is in F1 development, but in any case, none of the big car manufacturers are going to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on prestige Motorsport development for V10 engines, when all their other business is in smaller hybrids and EVs. It doesn‚Äôt make sense, and it‚Äôs not where the best and brightest minds in engineering want to go either. We have to keep in mind that F1 is the way it is, in part because it offers people the opportunity to work on cutting edge car technology, developing engines, batteries, etc. that are beyond what‚Äôs currently out there. These traditional engines are technologically less interesting to many of the people that will have to build them.\nIt‚Äôs really quite obvious when you listen to people who work with these cars, and it‚Äôs no surprise basically none of the proponents of going back to V10s are part of the technical community of F1. The main draw of them is better sound, with also some weight advantages. Going back would mostly mean deliberately choosing inferior, less advanced technology, for the sake of sound']",6,19,0.62,6,18,18,-2,0,-0.030000000000000027,-2
