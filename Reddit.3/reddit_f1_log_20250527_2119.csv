1kwoziz,Barcelona is not a bad circuit.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kwoziz/barcelona_is_not_a_bad_circuit/,2025-05-27, Discussion,"I have seen a lot of people on here and elsewhere commenting that the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix will likely not be great for overtaking and that this track is one of the most boring on the calendar. 

And that was right. Before they got rid of the last chicane. Since then it has actually been one of the very best tracks for overtaking. 

And in 2022 there were 50, the tenth highest total of the season. 

In 2023 there were 65 overtakes, the fifth highest total of the season.

And in 2024 there were 55 overtakes, the second highest tally of the whole season! 

And it's not slam dunk DRS overtakes either. The battles usually go right into the braking zone and last year Russell vs Norris even went through the whole of sector 1 and most of sector 2! That battle lasted over half a lap! https://youtu.be/6OpfnQFgvkw?si=WWkd6bLYIzYiCvsr

You can also defend but still have fun battles. A perfect example of this is Russell vs Verstappen in 2022 
https://youtu.be/XtT9tNfdAlM?si=1gvNKihBynCRMDqX

Furthermore there is fairly high tyrewear at this track and both 2023 and 2024 were two stoppers. 2022 was a three stopper. 

So I think we should be optimistic about this race because since the removal of that last chicane it has been a great circuit for racing!

Ferrari opted not to, even though they\'ve recently performed better on used tires than on new ones.\n\n> Vasseur didn\'t see this as a decisive disadvantage in the battle for the fastest time: ""If you want to do something like that, you have to adjust your entire program from Friday onwards. We were considering the medium tire as an alternative. McLaren was simply very fast. They did 1:10.1 minutes on the first push lap. And that was with fuel for three laps on board.""\n\n> **Bumps and curbs help.**\nThe rule that the Ferrari SF-25 doesn\'t perform well in slow corners suddenly seemed to no longer apply. And Ferrari had nothing in its luggage other than a larger rear wing that would have explained the miraculous transformation.\n\n> Leclerc concluded: ""With one exception, Monte Carlo has only slow corners. This allowed us to focus entirely on that during the setup without having to accept many disadvantages in other areas.""\n\n> In fact, the Ferrari drivers only lost time between the Tabak curve and the Schwimmbad section. Last year\'s Monaco winner offered a second explanation: ""The track has a lot of bumps, and you have to go over the curbs a lot. Our car can handle that. Perhaps that compensated for our other weaknesses.""\n\n> **Other slow curves.**\nVasseur\'s statement on the supposed miracle was interesting: ""We don\'t fully understand it either. It could have something to do with the fact that the slow curves of Monte Carlo are different from the slow curves elsewhere. They are very slow.""\n\n> Even more crucially, due to the relatively low speed, Ferrari had little to worry about excessive wear on the crash barrier, allowing them to run at the ground clearance they considered ideal. ""We have less contact with the ground here. That also helps,"" admitted Vasseur.\n\n> The Frenchman admits that, despite the upturn in form in Monte Carlo, the team fell far short of expectations in the first third of the season. It looks as if Ferrari has fallen into the same trap it fell into in 2023. In an effort to address last year\'s weaknesses, the engineers overreacted and turned their old strengths into weaknesses. Now they\'re good in fast corners, but they gain less time there than in slow ones.\n\n> **McLaren with the ground clearance up.**\nMcLaren did better. The Papaya races lost their time in the slow sections in 2024. These are now the car\'s strengths, but without giving up much at the other end. While they\'re not as fast as Red Bull in the fast corners and not better than Ferrari, they\'re better overall. Stella offers a deeper insight: ""We can now run maximum downforce with a bit more ground clearance than last year."" With these cars, that translates to more mechanical grip.\n\n> The McLarens are generally better balanced than their rivals. The competition attributes this to the front wing, which flexes in such a way that the aero balance shifts from front to rear with increasing load. If stiffer front wings are now mandatory in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bMcLaren would lose the most, their rivals hope.\n\n> McLaren shrugs off the dreamers: ""We\'re not afraid of the new endurance tests. Nothing will change for us,"" promises Stella. His colleague Vasseur, on the other hand, believes: ""The new rule can be a game changer."" Vasseur\'s calculations are as follows: Ferrari was the most conservative in developing these flexible wings. Therefore, they also have the least to lose. Toto Wolff doesn\'t want to dismiss Vasseur\'s theory. ""Perhaps the Ferrari actually loses less than the other cars.""', 'It will fuck Ferrari over the most, somehow', ""the change is from 15mm of flex to 10mm, and considering McLaren haven't bought any major updates yet, I imagine they're gonna bring big ones here to mitigate any problems the changes will cause, but I really don't think 5mm of difference will hurt McLaren at all"", ""Ok but what about an article about the Spain upgrade?

1kwyprr,Better racing options for Monaco circuit,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kwyprr/better_racing_options_for_monaco_circuit/,2025-05-27, Discussion,"I've been to Monte Carlo several times for the GP and to race in support series, and it is much tighter in reality than it looks on TV, esp. the run up from St. Devote to Massenet and Casino, which is tiny.

But there are areas where you could widen the track, or do something creative by extending the concrete into the harbour e.g. along Piscine, getting rid of / being more creative with an artificial chicane e.g. the Nouvelle Chicane after Tunnel.

Here are some areas where it could be improved to be more flowing: https://i.imgur.com/jkTRli2.jpg. There was also a suggestion yesterdaay to move the pit complex to the sea side, and use the current pitlane as part of the track.

Rascasse corner is named after a nightclub/bar/restaurant on that corner, called La Rascasse (https://www.montecarlosbm.com/en/bar-nightclub-monaco/la-rascasse), which is just parked there, obstructing the middle of the corner during the race: https://i.imgur.com/zxH6YwB.jpeg. If someone were to acquire that land you could create a different corner with a profile that encouraged hard braking and left enough room for an overtaking move, esp. if combined with removing the grandstand.

Also a nearby corner, Anthony Nogues, is only that tight because there is a pedestrian crossing there, with - literally - a bus shelter, which they block off (here it is: https://i.imgur.com/Nv40Ivn.jpg). If they put in a tunnel under the ground for pedestrians that area could be much, much wider.

Here are some of the options for improvement around that area [https://i.imgur.com/gV3hGC1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gV3hGC1.jpg) \- you can see Rascasse and Nogues are ridiculous islands. In the old days it was actually a flowing, wide hairpin called Gasométre: [https://i.imgur.com/TOZOHjV.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/TOZOHjV.jpeg)

Also although we see a classic layout at Monaco year after year, there are options to use different routes. For example, Portier, the right hander into Tunnel is actually part of a larger roundabout, the Rond Pont du Portier. You could extend that area and make a much, much nicer corner: [https://i.imgur.com/6ramjbZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6ramjbZ.jpg)

Finally, although we all know the Casino corner, there is another loop nearby that could be utilized to create some really nice flowing sweeps, and perhaps dramatic opportunities. Most people perhaps don't realize that the hill from St. Devote up past Hermitage normally deviates to the ***left*** as you climb the hill, up the Ave. Princesse Alice; the road up to Casino is a smaller, alternate route (see it here: [https://i.imgur.com/GyxWHhD.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GyxWHhD.jpg) \-  the current circuit takes the right hand street, Ave. de Monte-Carlo, not the broader left).

If you follow that main loop to the left, along the Ave. Princess Alice and Moulins, past the Monaco Pavilion, you get some really nice sweeping corners, and you can rejoin the old track back at Casino, just at the bump in the road that the cars deviate around on the hill down to Loews (now Gran Casino) - that bump is actually caused by Rue Madone joining.

That route would pass Chanel, Louis Vuitton, YSL, Armani etc, and has a natural chicane in that area as well as a short straight and a natural hairpin at the end of the straight, as you turn right into Rue Madone.
