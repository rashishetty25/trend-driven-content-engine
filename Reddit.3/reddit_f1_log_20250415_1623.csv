1jzint0,The new “Radio Rewind” series on F1’s Youtube channel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jzint0/the_new_radio_rewind_series_on_f1s_youtube_channel/,2025-04-15, Discussion,"There’s been a noticeable change in F1’s video format on YouTube. In the past couple of years, F1 consistently uploaded “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 Onboards” for every race weekend. It was a very good format and fans for the most part are enjoying it. However, this year they’ve completely dropped these two series in favor of “Radio Rewind.”

Now, “Radio Rewind” isn’t exactly new — it was typically used for classic races like Malaysia 2012, Canada 2011, Australia 2010, and Hungary 2006. But it seems like they now plan to make one for every race weekend.

Normally, I wouldn’t complain about it. I mean, it’s basically a combination of “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 (or even more) Onboards” in a single video. However, after the first few races, I have to say I’m not a fan of this new format.

First of all, it only focuses on the race (or the sprint, if there is one), completely leaving out practice sessions and qualifying. That’s a huge shame, because there are often a lot of interesting or funny team radios — or even crashes — that get missed.

Secondly, there’s the issue many fans have pointed out: the lack of subtitles for the team radio. Personally, I find this absurd. Formula 1 team radio has never been known for its clarity, so without subtitles, it’s really hard to understand what’s being said — especially when it comes to technical terms.

I’m not sure why they’ve chosen this direction. Maybe it’s to push out more videos per race weekend, but so far, it seems fans and viewers aren’t happy with it. The comment section under the latest Bahrain GP “Radio Rewind” video was filled with people asking F1 to bring back the old format — separating the onboards and team radio into two separate videos, just like last year.

So what do you think of this new format? Do you like it, or do you also want to go back to the old one?","[""Yeah it's bad. Seems like a cost cutting measure to me.\n\nBut 90% of the comments on those videos are people complaining, so I'm sure they know."", '""maybe it\'s to push out more videos per race weekend"" \n\nbut theyre doing the opposite? 2023 we used to get radio rewind, top 10 onboards and post-race radio of every driver. now it\'s condensed in one video.', 'And the captions were not just for better understanding, they would add fun little effects to it like shaking when driver was shouting, or text bouncing when the car was porpoising', 'I do miss the post-race radio of every driver.', ""I watched one - I don't think I even watched it to the end. The lack of captioning pretty much assured I never bothered with another.\n\n\nCombining the formats doesn't even make sense from an analytical view; YouTube is all about views and watch time.\xa0"", 'Radio rewind was there up to the 2022 season, there were some bangers in there', 'The Call of Duty lobby music in the background was a interesting choice', 'I miss top 10 onboards. Used to look forward to watching them a few days after the race.', ""Its only the race, they've cut the subs.

1jz4tzl,The 2025 Bahrain Grand Prix: In data,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jz4tzl/the_2025_bahrain_grand_prix_in_data/,2025-04-14, Technical,"Thought, I could do one of those after a GP.  
I left out the comparisons of AMR and Sauber because... not really much going on over there.

RBR is in a *bad* spot right now. Being slower than Alpine isn't any good. Comparing VER and GAS makes it visible, that Max absolutely had to give it all to overtake his old team mate. When looking over to the VER-TSU comparison: VER's Hard stint was absolutely awful. Which begs the question: Why did they not have enough Mediums left to go for a S-M-M strat? Many things going wrong right now at RBR.  
  
Piastri controlled the pace well enough to never be in any danger, but on paper, the Ferraris should have been in podium contention. Gasly told his RE, that Leclerc told him on the drivers parade, that they are looking at a one-stop. And LEC did ask to think about Plan Delta, when called to the box. Hülkenberg did a 30-lap-stint on Mediums, but I doubt, that would have been an option for the front-runners. Plus, the rather strange choice to put on Mediums again, which forces you to swap to a compound in the last stint, that you  might don't even want to put on.  
  
 Haas did everything right, with Bearman capitalizing on the SC-discounted pitstops, and having overall strong pace. Bearman was struggling at first, but then got his footing, being at times faster than his team mate.  
  
Antonelli got rather screwed over by the strategy department, with ditching the Mediums after just 15 laps and then having to pit again after just 5 laps. Turning a P5 into a P11 is not exactly spectacular.  
Russell was in serious trouble and, looking at the pace comparison between him and Norris, benefitted mostly by Norris' mistakes.","['Regarding the one stop. Those hards were so bad, they were probably the wrong option in any strategy.', ""If the hards weren't so bad I think the race could have been even better, best race so far tho"", 'Charles’ final stint pace was actually impressive comparing to Hamilton, considering he is also defending against Norris for most part of the stint.', 'The sc really screwed ferrari didnt it', ""Ferrari did an upgrade correctly. It just wasn't large enough.

Nothing against them or max but change is good, just like vettel, Schumacher and Hamilton's eras of dominance ending. Long may it continue."", 'Agree with Antonelli\'s strategy not being great, but I think the only really bad decision was pitting him under SC when he had already pitted a couple laps earlier. Only reason that could make sense is if he had a massive lock-up in the first laps in his 3rd stint, but I don\'t think that\'s what happened, they would\'ve shown a replay. Putting him on softs for the 25 or so final laps was risky but he didn\'t have a set of mediums left, and as we saw the hard tyre was absolutely putrid.\xa0\n\n\nBefore the restart Norris\' RE told him Russell was already worried about having a soft on but Norris replied that he shouldn\'t be because the soft was ""mega"" and was a good tyre.\xa0\n\n\nRegarding his stint on mediums, I think the reason they pitted him after only 15 laps may be because he cooked his tyres pretty bad. Russell did about 20 laps on the mediums and was lapping in the high 1:37s / low 1:38s. Antonelli only did a single lap in the 1:37s and every other lap was in the mid or high 1:38s and his last 2 laps were even in the low 1:39s.\xa0\n\n\nAlso the fact that he lost several places at the start probably made him push a bit more than he wanted in his first stint to try and get those positions back, which also damaged his tyres. His pace on the softs wasn\'t horrible but wasn\'t great either']",161,35,0.95,161,286,286,9,0,0.0,9

(And did they stop showing the ""live minibox"" during replays? Why?)  \n\\- They should stop switching to onboards during overtakes, it\'s incredibly annoying. (Use onboards for replays)   \n\\- The timing of replays is so bad, that with races like last weekend we are seeing more actions happening on replays than live.   \n\\- They switch away during an overtake/action, this has happened multiple times every weekend now, with the last examples being Hamilton overtaking Norris, Sainz/Antonelli, etc.   \n\\- Qualifying is incredible close and exciting, but they keep missing A LOT of drivers finishing their lap. If there\'s many drivers that are competitive, we really should not focus on 1 entire lap of a driver. \n\nI know it\'s an incredible hard job, and they also have some very good direction sometimes, but these are some very consistent annoyances that I think a lot of people share.
