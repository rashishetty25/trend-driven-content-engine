We\'ll see how true it is. As long as every team can still be profitable while matching the new budget cap, I have no issue tbh. But if one, or more, teams can\'t even reach the cap, then it is a problem.', 'Man a whole lot of people getting made without actually reading on here', ""Not really a reveal, as this was public before (for example [here](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-says-maternity-leave-will-definitely-fall-outside-f1-2026-cost-cap/10614621/)). Basically a result of moving things into the cap that were outside and adjusting for inflation, whilst the actual spending level stays the same.

Plus whatever uplift for 2026 plus increased costs for new PU's etc. it puts it back in line with where it should have been, because before you are effectively just crippling the wages of the workers because drivers and CEOcs were exempt from the cap.\n\n\nI have my own opinion about that, but I don't think increasing the cap is a bad thing.
