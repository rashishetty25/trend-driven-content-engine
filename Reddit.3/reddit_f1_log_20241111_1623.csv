1goti88,Humble Beginings,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1goti88/humble_beginings/,2024-11-11, Discussion,"I was watching the episodes of Comeback on [F1.tv](http://F1.tv) for Nigel Mansell and Robert Kubica.  In both the episodes it was called out that both the drivers came from working-class backgrounds and made sacrifices to become and stay an F1 driver and achieve what they had.

I wondered which of the 24 or so drivers this year come from humble backgrounds.  I know Lewis had a working-class family.  I think in Drive to Survive they mentioned that Ocon also was working-class.  I know Sargeant, Stroll and Norris come from wealth.  

Can anyone share info about the remaining drivers? ","[""Alonso's parents are firmly working class and didn't have any surplus wealth or anything. I think he's definitely got one of the more humble backgrounds."", ""I know he's no longer on the grid, but Grosjean was himself a bank employee in Geneva. So not poor, but definitely the most miserable."", ""Fernando came from a normal background. His father was a factory mechanic for mine explosives and his mother worked at a department store. His father built his six year old daughter a kart (beautiful kart, looked like a little McLaren F1 car), but she lost interest in it, so it became 3-year-old Fernando's. His sister is now a doctor. They cut some costs growing up like his mother making his racing suits and just not buying rain tires and using normal tires in the rain.\n\nOf recently retired big names that come to mind, Vettel and Raikkonen were from pretty normal backgrounds as well."", ""Ocon probably comes from the least wealthy background. Neither Hamilton or Alonso came from rich parents. Stroll's dad is obviously incredibly rich. Norris' dad is also very rich although much less than Stroll's. Zhou's parents are pretty rich. Ricciardo's own a large business. Sainz, Verstappen and Magnussen all come from racing stock."", ""Charles had a very rich grandfather... (though from Herve being a Leclerc, and his father and little brother being Manni's, I strongly suspect it was really step father and half brother) Charles's parents were more normal. His mother was and still is a hairdresser, his father died when Charles was in F2 after a long illness, but he worked for some business when he was healthy. I couldn't find evidence if it was the family business or not.\n\nThe grandfather would only gave a certain budget to the kids for racing. The much older brother (Jules Bianchi's best friend) stopped karting when Charles was young, so that Charles could have the whole budget, and their little brother Arthur barely got to do any competitive racing. Charles was so promising right away, it just kind of made sense for karting to be his thing, even though all the kids liked it. In 2010, Charles was going to have to stop karting anyway- seemingly the budget from the grandparents was going away for one reason or another. But Jules went to Nicolas Todt and said you have to sponsor this kid in karting. Jules was in GP2 (F2) at the time. Nicolas Todt is still Charles's manager to this day. Jules is the most recent Formula One death in 2015."", ""Kevin Magnussen's father was a racing driver who was able to pay for Kevin's karting career. He was briefly an F1 driver (25 entrees skattered over a few years, actually replaced by Jos Verstappen). But, apparently Jan Magnussen was quite bad with money. He was a young man- had Kevin at 19- and apparently spent what he made. He stopped financially supporting Kevin after single seaters. When Kevin was about 16 he had basically given up on motorsports from not being able to continue paying after one year of single seaters (in which he won Danish Formula Ford). He had gotten a job working at a factory, doing what sounded like dangerous work for a teenager- there was welding involved- when another sponsor came along and restarted his junior career.\n\nSo... not exactly humble beginnings, but also as a teenager he had basically resigned himself to being at most middle class himself as a factory worker."", 'It‚Äôs a true shame Nigel melted away while filming with the Grand Tour', ""Ocon is the obvious one, I think his family made some huge sacrifices for his racing. \n\nLiam Lawson I don't think was exactly wealthy and was lucky with being in the right place at the right time for Helmut to see him. \n\nBut it seems like it's going to be almost impossible now for kids who aren't rich or get lucky with sponsors to break into F1 now which I think is something that needs to be addressed."", 'I think you need to differentiate rich by ""normal person"" terms and rich by ""Formula 1 driver"" terms.\n\nThere are a lot of drivers on the grid who come from comfortable families yet still struggled to afford racing, because motorsport is insanely expensive. I\'d say the majority of drivers fall under this category: upper middle class by most standards, but required team backing or sponsorships to continue through the feeder series ladder.\n\nIt\'s a lot easier to pick out the drivers who come from truly rich families than the ones who don\'t, actually.

Logan Sargent joined F1 and I doubt he brought 40k new fans from the U.S. into F1. \n\nFranco shows up in the middle of the season driving for a midfield team, and he has brought in over hundreds of thousands of new fans, and is so popular that nearly 40,000 people who didn't know who he was at the begining of the year, went to go see only him and nobody else. \n\nSome of those that went probably don't know who veratappen is, or that red bull has a second team, and they definitely have no idea why the team is called Williams. There are news stories about putting together rule guides for your family. Some  couple got their 15 minutes of fame in the news because he made a quick guide for his girlfriend who wanted to start following F1.\n\nTN news somehow got my dad's number after the race in Austin and interviewed him live for like 40 minutes to talk about what it was like for an Argentine to be at the race.\n\nWilliams made a full line of merch for a driver that doesn't even have a contract. Why? Because they're raking in the cash on merch sales. My family has been a diehard Ferrari family for literally as long as I can remember, but you bet your ass my dad has a Williams hat now, and it's signed by Franco.\n\nIt's all for him and nobody else. This isn't just fans going to the races. This is something formula one has never seen before.""]",66,16,0.78,66,16,16,4,0,0.010000000000000009,4

ROARING with the delight that comes from knowing your own fiery demise could and probably would come at any moment.\n\nNew engines sound like they're just going to work, this is easy for them, they can chuck out over 1000 horses but it doesn't really require a huge amount of effort or kerfuffle, it's not interesting because they know they will survive to race again next week, they might even have to hold a little back for next week.\n\nMan.."", ""One of the best race tracks in the world.

I don't know if it's because it's old and grainy or if centre actually was just a complete beast but these older cars look infinitely faster.
