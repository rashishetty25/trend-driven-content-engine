Perhaps it has something to do with it?', ""I don't buy the argument that it's expected because the tire put a force in the suspension because it locked up or accelerated or reversed or whatever. It can't be, simply because the limit of the force applied is the limit of grip the tire has.\n\nIf the tire is slipping/locked up then that'll be the force exerted by the rubber in dynamic friction coefficient mode. If the tire is gripping the surface then it'll be static friction which is larger. Now, F1 cars operate normally in much higher grip situations than this particular spin; a dry track at high aero loads pushing the rubber against the track is the normal case. If the driver brakes hard, then the force will peak in static friction (i.e. not locked up) just before the limit is reached and then drop way down when the tire locks up and goes into dynamic friction i.e. sliding. The bottleneck will *always* be tire grip, and never braking pressure. This is true of any old car on the street, too. If you slam on the brakes then you'll always either slide (abs notwithstanding) or stop. It's just pretty easy to produce a higher force by pinching a brake disk than the force produced by friction in the short contact patch line/area of the tire with the road.\n\nEven in these high grip conditions, in a dry track with high downforce, going forwards, sideways, or backwards, suspensions don't just snap. They'd be very bad suspensions if they did because that's the standard environment they're expected to operate in. In a wet track, at a low speed, as in the incident, the grip is much lower. The maximum force that the tire puts on the suspension can't do more than tickle it. It doesn't matter if he accelerated or braked or reversed, the tire would start sliding way before the suspension flinched.\n\nIt seems much more likely there was a smaller defect there for a while, it grew larger as the track dried and Bortoletto started attacking kerbs more aggressively (and generally as fatigue added up), and the suspension snap is just an after-effect of the chain of failures that happened after the defect became a failure. \n\nHe had been getting brake failure messages on the dash pretty much the whole race too, and had to repeatedly do some settings on the wheel to reset the error message that came up. These messages became more and more common towards the failure. Brakes are right there close by the suspension, and if one were to speculate, perhaps the sensor errors were caused by a misalignment of something in that general area, and their becoming more frequent implies the misalignment could be increasing.

1jetdc4,Will the V10 come sooner ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jetdc4/will_the_v10_come_sooner/,2025-03-19, News,,"['Oh my absolute days. \n\nWill await OP to post full translation but seems like there are two suggestions going around:  \n\\- Cancel the 2026 PU changes and keep the current chassis rules for two more years, then introduce a V10 for 2028.\n\n\\- Keep the 2026 rules for 3 years only, then introduce V10 for 2029.', ""Let's be clear, abandoning the 2026 PU change at this point would mean effectively jettisoning Honda and Audi (who have little interest in V10's and don't have a 2025 PU to carry on with), and by doing so would jeopardise the PU supply contracts for at least 3 teams (Aston, Sauber, Alpine) and even puts Red Bull and Racing Bulls in a slightly strange position since they're effectively in limbo between RBPT and Honda at the moment. It would also be a colossal waste of resources for the suppliers who are already well into the later stages of R&D.\n\nThat's just completely unrealistic in my view."", ""Keeping the current rules wont happen. Sauber, Red Bull and Minardi wouldn't have an engine supplier. And also for the other manufactures like Ferrari and Mercedes it would be almost impossible to produce enough engines. They will have switched much of their production to the 2026 engines already"", ""V10 no fuel and no rpm limit. Let's go."", ""DeepL (1/2)  \n  \nIs the V10 coming sooner?\n\nFor several weeks now, Formula 1 has been discussing a complete U-turn on the technical rules that are to apply over the next five years. The aim is to introduce naturally aspirated engines with sustainable fuel before 2031.\n\nThe Formula 1 community has been discussing a contingency plan for the future for weeks. It sounds like a crazy idea, but it is becoming increasingly serious. The current regulations are to be extended by two years in order to switch directly to cheaper V10 engines that run on climate-neutral fuel. This would be a complete reversal of Formula 1's plans to make the sport even more attractive for car manufacturers.\n\nThe starting point was a song of praise for the V10 engine from Formula 1 boss Stefano Domenicali. Running on climate-neutral fuel, it would be a solution for the premier class, Domenicali mused aloud. It is cheaper and simpler than the current drive units and also than the hybrid drive planned from 2026. It allows for smaller and lighter cars.\n\nWhat initially sounded like dreams of the future suddenly gained momentum. The F1 management has other reasons to fear next year's major rule reform. It could jeopardize the balance in the field and thus the excitement. With new cars, new engines, new tires and the great unknown of e-fuels, there is a great danger that someone will interpret the new rules better than everyone else and then put on a show.\n\nA V10 would also be a lifeline if the manufacturers were to leave Formula 1 in droves at some point, as they once did in 2009. Private suppliers could also construct a ten-cylinder naturally aspirated engine.\n\nHelp for Cadillac?\n\n\n\nFIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem has belatedly jumped on the bandwagon. Even at an advanced stage of development, various teams report that the 2026 rules were too ambitious and express safety concerns about energy recuperation. This could lead to large differences in speed in the field, depending on whether one is in charging mode or not. Many are also worried that the show could suffer.\n\n\n\nThis has led to the idea of extending the current rules by two years and then switching directly to naturally aspirated engines in 2028. Some interpret the president's move as a way of preventing a flop. If the teams' concerns prove to be true, it will be the FIA's fault. They wrote the rules. Others accuse Ben Sulayem of wanting to help newcomer Cadillac. He is said to be emotionally close to the General Motors brand.\n\n\n\nThis scenario would be perfect for the Americans. They could drive with the proven Ferrari engines for two years and then launch their own V10. That would be a much easier task than building one of the 2026 horsepower monsters without any prior knowledge."", 'Both suggestions are INSANE.\n\nScrapping the 2026 PUs entirely not only royally fucks RBPT and Audi, but it\'s already way too late to force teams to scrap all the work they did on the 2026 chassis.\n\nShortening the 2026 PU cycle to 3 years is entirely unheard of, teams invested billions of dollars, and Cadillac would have to either delay again their engine or develop a V6 for a single year and then move to a V10.\n\nLastly, not a single one of the current manufacturer has expressed any interest in developing V10s, the opposite infact. Honda for example is only in F1 for the high-fuel efficiency engine development.\n\nThis smells of a political battle to take power away from the teams and give it back to the FIA hidden behind the ""#BringBackTheV10"" narrative.', 'Mmm... I don’t see them moving to V10 so soon, especially when some engine manufacturers (probably all) have been investing so much in the new 2026 engines. I guess they will stay 5 years with the new engines as planned and then switch to V10', 'I’ve enjoyed PU’s not being a talking point in F1 for a few years now because everyone is roughly on a par.', ""The problem with V10s is that none of the car manufacturers want this. The current manufacturers lobbied heavily for an inline 4 before agreeing on a V6. Honda and Audi joined the sport on the basis of a V6 formula.\n\nYes everyone gets nostalgic for the noise (myself included) but the manufacturers want compact, low cylinder count, engines because it's more road relevant. Gaining V10s will mean losing Honda, Audi, and probably another manufacturer.""]",219,252,0.83,219,1236,1236,-1,3,0.0,-1

1jesvbs,Would Sainz regret leaving for Ferrari if Norris wins WDC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jesvbs/would_sainz_regret_leaving_for_ferrari_if_norris/,2025-03-19, Discussion,"Sainz  moved from McLaren to Ferrari back in 2021, and at the time it seemed like a no brainer. Ferrari is Ferrari, and he did have some success there. Sadly for him, he got Hamiltoned. 

Now he is at Williams, and McLaren looks stronger than ever. If in 2025 Norris ends up winning WDC, you have to wonder… will Sainz feel even a tiny bit of regret?

Obviously, he and Norris are great friends, and I’m sure he’d be happy for him. But deep down, when you are an elite driver, you want that success for yourself. 

I think it was the right call at that time, but still watching his old teammate achieve what he left behind could sting a little.

What are your thoughts. 




","[""No matter how badly the team is performing, most drivers still willing to die to come to Ferrari. I mean, it's Ferrari."", ""Even now the relations between McLaren and Sainz are still pretty warm, you will see genuine congratulations from the team whenever he does well (and it doesn't inconvenience McLaren). I'm pretty confident that Sainz left for Ferrari on good terms, he wasn't forced out or left the team in the lurch. I don't think he regrets joining Ferrari, but he will be pretty gutted that he was replaced for Hamilton, despite doing pretty much anything you could expect for that team."", ""in another timeline:\n\nSainz didn't leave McLaren\n\nPiastri signed with Red Bull"", 'If he moved to any other team, he would. But it was fucking Ferrari.', 'At the time McLaren and Ferrari were basically at the same point in performance which was proven by the end of 2021. Whereas Sainz would have had to wait 3 years to get a 2022 Ferrari at McLaren, he only needed to wait 1 year to be in a race winning car at Ferrari. At the time it was the best decision he could have made. No doubt he felt vindicated seeing how far McLaren fell in 2022 after having had a decently successful 2021 season. Had McLaren continued on that upwards trajectory in 2022, would they have done better than Ferrari? I don’t think so. \n\nYou have to remember the people who are at McLaren now were not given the freedom to do what they’re doing now, plus the team was still lacking in resources and knowledge. It’s entirely possible that Sainz didn’t see the improvement in McLaren, or it wasn’t enough to convince him to give up a seat at Ferrari. Ultimately, if that was part of his decision process, then he was correct because McLaren did backslide, twice. It’s only after a huge restructuring operation that they started to move forwards and that restructure only happened at the end of 2022. The effects of it weren’t felt until mid-2023. \n\nWithout those vital parts at McLaren, Ferrari looked in 2022 and 2023 to be the better option. It’s only midway through 2023 that McLaren starts to show signs of improvement but because it’s done this before in 2021, there was no guarantee they’d be able to maintain it. It’s only because of drastic changes behind the scenes that McLaren ended up with the 2024 and 2025 cars. And I don’t think it would have been a good idea to turn down Ferrari at the time where Sainz had to make a decision whether to leave McLaren or not. \n\nMaybe now looking at it he could feel a bit like ‘slow and steady wins the race’ in terms of how Ferrari shot up in 2022 and slid down thereafter, or he could look at it is as ‘I got a chance to drive for Ferrari and I won races at Ferrari while McLaren were not in contention, and I won *when* McLaren were in contention’.

1jevaw8,Opinion: Red Bull needs to stop burning its bridges.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jevaw8/opinion_red_bull_needs_to_stop_burning_its_bridges/,2025-03-19, Discussion,"Albon, Gasly, Yuki, now Lawson and Hadjar.  Red Bull has made a habit of having an itchy trigger finger when young drivers make youthful errors, and to be very quick with the ""next man up"" rhetoric before young drivers really get a chance to show what they are. 

 It's the nature of the young to make mistakes, and it's apparently the nature of Red Bull Racing to fail to tolerate those mistakes and make knee jerk decisions that alter a young driver's entire career and ensure that whatever they produce later in life, won't be produced for Red Bull Racing..

Imagine if Red Bull had simply let Alex Albon learn and mature the position for a year or two back in the day.  They'd have saved themselves an awful lot of drama, and with a few years experience under his belt he would probably be a perfectly satisfactory driver for them by now.  They could definitely have used someone to put their second car into P5.

Red Bull has encountered a situation where they are a place veterans avoid going to.  There are literally multiple drivers not on the grid right now that are a better bet than Lawson to be productive in that second car, and there's no real belief that any of those drivers seriously considered, or were considered, for the open Red Bull seat, forcing one of the premium racing teams in the sport to throw a young replacement driver into what should be one of the most prestigious seats on the grid.

And the one driver they can find for that second seat who has even a small chance to stick there longterm?  He had one bad race in extremely adverse conditions and is suddenly on an ""improvement plan.""

One race...

Red Bull is reacting like they've got options for that second seat if Lawson fails.  In principle they do have Yuki Tsunoda at VCARB, but their established reluctance to actually bring the Japanese driver forward (and their repeated decisions that result in bringing white drivers forward over Asian ones at the drop of a hat despite an obvious quality and experience gap, Gasly over Albon, Lawson over Yuki), suggests that even if Yuki does wind up in the second Red Bull seat, Marko will learn nothing and continue to maintain his hair trigger. 

 And what's left in the Red Bull arsenal if they burn that last bridge?  Are they going to put Ayumu Iwasa in that seat?  Are they going to compound their bad habits by rushing Arvid Lindblad forward a full year before he's likely to be ready?  And likely STILL fail to realize that the reason the rookies aren't acclimatizing is substantially their own fault?

The bottom line for me is that while there is no ""curse"" on that seat in a superstitious sense, the attitudes at Red Bull, and Helmut Marko in particular, are cursing it plenty.  You can't just drop mandates on a rookie, and ratcheting up the pressure on a man like Lawson is more likely than not to make matters worse, not better.  you also can't wave a magic wand and make it so that young drivers don't make mistakes.  Especially if you insist on a car that is deliberately unstable with high oversteer and a super high skill floor.

this is a car that has eaten up every young driver not named Max who tried to take it on.  Once is a fluke, twice is coincidence, three times is a pattern.

Patience is required with any young driver , and simultaneously patience is anathema in the Red Bull inner circle.  And they are legitimately running out of drivers willing to risk their careers taking that car on","['`Albon, Gasly, Yuki, now Lawson and Hadjar.`\n\nLawson and Hadjar still have their seats btw.', 'Perhaps you need to actually check some facts and what Red Bull have actually said rather than relying on headlines and general comments on socials.\n\n>Imagine if Red Bull had simply let Alex Albon learn and mature the position for a year or two back in the day\n\nAlbon was in the Red Bull for a season and a half - exactly the 1-2 years you suggest they should have left him in.
